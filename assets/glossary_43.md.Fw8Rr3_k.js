Exceptional memory is also prevalent in those with savant syndrome and mnemonists.  Hyperthymesia  Hyperthymesia, or hyperthymesitic syndrome, is superior autobiographical memory, the type of memory that forms people's life stories. The term thymesia is derived from the Greek word thymesis, meaning \\"memory\\" and the Greek meaning of \\"hyper\\" means \\"over\\". The capabilities of the affected individuals are not limited to recalling specific events from their personal experience. Hyperthymesia has both enhanced autobiographical and episodic memory There is an important characteristic of hyperthymesia: People with the syndrome have an unusual form of eidetic memory to remember as well as recall any specific personal events or trivial details, including a date, the weather, what people wore on that day, from their past, almost in an organized manner. Unlike other people with advanced memory abilities, such as savant syndrome (who tend to use calendrical calculation), individuals with hyperthymestic syndrome rely heavily on their personal \\"mental calendar\\", which is an automatic and obsessive process. Moreover, individuals with hyperthymesia do not focus on practiced mnemonic strategies. For example, \\"AJ\\", who has the first documented case of hyperthymesia, has difficulty consciously applying her memory strategies to help her memorize new knowledge, making her rote memorization abilities below average. Importantly, having superior autobiographical memory does not translate to broadly superior memory; in fact across tests like a digit span, visual reproduction, and word- pair memorization, those with hyperthymesia have no statistically significant difference from a control group. = Neuroscience = Because it is a recently discovered memory capability, neuroscientific explanations of hyperthymesia are scarce. McGaugh, who coined the term, provides mostly speculation in \\"A Case of Unusual Autobiographical Remembering\\". He suggests that \\"AJ\\"'s superior autobiographical memory is largely the result of specific impairments rather than enhancements. Her sensitivity to cues that trigger her memories suggest that \\"AJ\\" has trouble inhibiting episodic-retrieval mode, which is the neurocognitive state required for present stimuli to be interpreted as memory cues. Because she is unable to \\"turn off\\" her retrieval mode, the smallest associations may bring on detailed recollections of \\"AJ\\"'s past. Inhibition in itself is a type of executive functioning, thought to be associated with the right inferior frontal cortex. Although \\"AJ\\" is not autistic, McGaugh and colleagues note that she shares some of the executive-functioning deficits that occur with autism. These deficits, along with anomalous lateralization and \\"AJ\\"'s obsessive‚Äìcompulsive tendencies, point to a neurodevelopmental frontostriatal disorder common in autism, OCD, ADHD, Tourette's syndrome, and schizophrenia. The frontostriatal system is made up of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate, supplementary motor area, and associated basal ganglia structures. = Cases = , there are an estimated 61 confirmed cases of hyperthymesia worldwide. Cases of hyperthymesia differ from related cases of savant memory in that savants have an extraordinary memory for specific hobbies, and events of a narrow basis, whereas cases of confirmed hyperthymesia show surprisingly detailed memory for specific and general events. One subject, who, given any date in history, can recall what the weather was like on said date, personal details of their life at the time, and other news events that occurred at that time. Details of what the subject recalls may be significant to them in some way, but they may not be. Personal meaning does not seem to affect the subject's memory ‚Äì they simply recall everything. In another confirmed case, the subject, when shown a photograph from his past, can recall the date it was taken, where it was taken, what they had done that day, and even more detailed information such as the temperature on said day. = Drawbacks = AJ describes her memory as a \\"running movie that never stops\\". She views the world in \\"split screen\\", with the past constantly playing at the same time as the present. She explains that although \\"most have called it a gift\\", she calls it a \\"burden\\". AJ's superior memory does not seem to be due to a desire to apply memorizing techniques; her memorization of autobiographical information is non-conscious. It is possible that AJ's memory could stem from the traumatic experience of having her family move when she was 8, at which point she began to \\"organize her memories\\" and think about the life she had left behind a great deal.  Eidetic memory  Eidetic memory‚Äîtotal recall memory‚Äîrefers to the ability of an individual who can accurately recall a large number of images, sounds and objects in a seemingly unlimited volume. Eidetic has a meaning of \\"related extraordinarily detailed and vivid recall of visual images\\" in Greek. The term eidetic memory can become more clinical when the memory experts use the picture elicitation method to detect the ability. In the picture elicitation method, children are asked to study an image for approximately twenty to thirty minutes, and then the researchers remove the picture, it has been found that children with such ability are able to recall the image with perfect accuracy after the picture has been removed. It has been suggested that children with eidetic memory can maintain the image in their memory as vividly as if it were still there. There are reports of different forms of eidetic memory as well as new case studies that suggest a difference between photographic and eidetic memory, although not enough scientific data exist currently from the medical community. Public documents from the APA, Yale, and Harvard suggest otherwise and that more studies are being done in order to properly stimulate the differences; all current noted forms of memory are open to the public but not meant to discriminate against the hypothesis of new types. Older studies have claimed to have observed a variety of drawbacks among those who have an apparent eidetic memory. Eidetic imagery can be so vivid as to mimic actual perception of stimuli, which can be much like a hallucination. Some researchers of eidetic imagery have proposed a link between this ability and psychosis, such as in schizophrenic populations. = Criticism = Marvin Minsky argued in his book The Society of Mind that the reported cases of eidetic memory should be considered as \\"unfounded myth[s]\\". This view was supported by an experimental study conducted by psychologist Adriaan de Groot. The experiment was intended to investigate chess grandmasters' ability to memorize positions of chess pieces on a chessboard. When those chess experts were provided with arrangements that were inconsistent with a real chess game, their performance was about the same as non-experts. These results indicate that the eidetic ability of those chess grandmasters were not innate, but a learned strategy with certain types of information. Wilding and Valentine searched for people claiming to have an eidetic or otherwise superior memory via public media. Out of the 31 people who called in, only three actually had a significantly above- average but not eidetic memory. Further cause for skepticism is given by a non-scientific event: The World Memory Championships. Held since 1991, this is an annual competition in different memory disciplines and is nearly totally based on visual tasks ‚Äì nine out of ten events are displayed visually, the tenth event is presented by audio. Since the champions can win interesting prizes, it should attract people who can beat those tests easily by reproducing visual images of the presented material during the recall. But indeed, not a single memory champion has ever been reported to have an eidetic memory. Instead, without a single exception, all winners consider themselves mnemonists (see below) and rely on using mnemonic strategies, mostly the method of loci. = Cases = John von Neumann possessed near-total recall Cases of eidetic memory have been reported for generations, with a 1970 study on a woman being called the most convincing documentation yet. Her memory was extraordinary in that she could see an image once and retain it in memory for years to come. The classic study of the subject's memory documents her writing out poetry in a foreign language, of which she had no prior knowledge, years after seeing the original text. This suggests that her memory retained the image of the foreign words vividly enough to recall years later. Reports also suggest that her memory was so vivid that she could obscure other parts of the present visual field with these past memories. However, this subject remains the only person to have passed such a test, and the credibility of the findings are highly questionable, given that the researcher married his subject, and the tests have never been repeated. The study fueled strong skepticism about studies of eidetic memory for several decades thereafter. Recently there has been a renewal of interest in the area, with more careful controls, and far less spectacular results. Supposedly Hungarian mathematician John von Neumann could recite exactly word for word any books he had read, including page numbers and footnotes ‚Äì even those of books he had read decades earlier. Franco Magnani is a memory artist. Magnani was born in Pontito in 1934. Pontito is a small town in the hills of Tuscany which had a population of 500 people before the second world war, which decreased to just 70 people, made up of the elderly and retirees, following the war. The small town fell into disarray when the agrarian economy had dwindled. In 1965, this prompted the thirty-one year old Magnani to leave his childhood home of Pontito, a decision which was deeply troubling as he had decided not to return. After making his decision, Magnani became very ill. It is unclear what this illness was exactly but, symptoms included high fever, weight loss, delirium, and possibly even seizures. For this, Magnani was placed into a sanatorium. Here he had vivid dreams of his hometown, not of his family or friends or even of events, but of the town itself. According to Magnani, the dreams were in a detail beyond anything he could consciously imagine. After getting released from the hospital, Franco Magnani considered, but ultimately rejected medical possibilities that were suggested. These possibilities included some sort of freudian splitting of the ego which could have resulted in hypermnesia hysteria. While Magnani rejected these notions, he never allowed them to be properly explored. Once relocating to San Francisco, Magnani picked up painting, which he had no formal training in. His first painting was of his childhood home in Pontito. Magnani painted the house in remarkable accuracy, so much so that he himself was amazed. This was especially surprising considering the fact that at this point, Magnani had not been to Pontito in over 25 years. Over time, he grew an obsession to painting the town in which he grew up in, famed psychologist Oliver Sacks noted in 1987, Magnini seemed \\"possessed.\\" That same year, photographer Susan Schwartzenberg went to Pontito to photograph the scenes of many of Magnani's paintings. This was done as part of a study to document the astonishing accuracy of the artists work. This study would be revealed in an art exhibit on memory in 1988. This garnered much attention by researchers such as Bob Miller who suggested that this work could reveal the accuracy, distortions, and inventions of Magnani's memory. These photographs showed something interesting about Magnani's work that was not previously evident. The Exploratorium, which hosted the exhibit for which Schwartzenberg took photos for, explains this observation while examining a drawing of a church. \\"This drawing, looking down from a point high above the path approaching the church, shows a view that Magnani could never have seen.\\" Work done by Baddley and Hitch in 1974 showed the importance of the visuospatial sketchpad in their model of working memory. The VSS stores visual and spatial information as part of Short Term Memory which is used in working memory for problem solving. This is miraculous due to the fact that Magnani imagined and painted with incredible accuracy, perspectives that he couldn't have possibly ever seen. His visual sensory information was stored long term which he was able to recall more than a quarter of a century later in intricate detail. This prompted praise from Sacks, stating that this rare phenomenon made him an eidetic artist. Sacks went on to say, \\"he could seemingly reproduce with almost photographic accuracy every building, every street, every stone of Pontito, far away, close up, from any possible angle.\\"  Savants  Savant syndrome, also known as savantism, is a condition in which individuals with a developmental disorder are exceptional in one or more areas. = Neuroscience = Autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by difficulties in reciprocal social behaviour and communication, stereotyped patterns of behaviour, and restricted interests. They are also associated with typical and atypical functioning in memory. Structural abnormalities have been found to affect the hippocampus, with the perirhinal, entorhinal, and parahippocampus less affected (these are areas in the medial temporal lobe outside of the hippocampus). The hippocampus is thought to be involved in domain-general relational processes, with surrounding areas mediating more domain and item-specific and contextual processing. This is consistent with observed memory effects of ASD which shows superior low-level and item-specific processing, at a cost of having impairments in higher level relational processes. One example found in the literature is J.S., with high functioning autism. J.S. has no episodic memory (which is highly associative or relational in nature) and must rely on memorizing facts. He will memorize entire conversations, so as to remember even general content later. He also remembers events by memorizing A-B-C predicates‚Äîitem-specific memory with a memorized (specific) association connecting them. = Cases = Kim Peek, diagnosed with Savant syndrome Savant syndrome is elaborate abilities (including memory) in specialized areas such as a hobby or event, or a certain type of information. One of the most well- known cases of savant memory is Kim Peek, the man on which the movie Rain Man was based. Peek had a reported savant memory for most information, not just specialized pieces, and was able to memorize large pieces of information from the age of 16 months. Tony DeBlois and Derek Paravicini also show superior memory for music. Deblois can play 8000 songs from memory on 20 different instruments, and Paravicini can play a piece of music after hearing it only once. Another case of savant memory is that of Richard Wawro. Wawro is known for his paintings of landscapes and seascapes, all done in elaborate detail. What is interesting about Wawro's art is that he paints from seeing a scene only once and does not use a model. His memory for the scene is so elaborate that he can also report where he drew the picture and when. Similarities across cases indicate that savant memory may be similar to eidetic memory. Daniel Tammet is a savant with an exceptional memory for numbers. He began to associate numbers with images after experiencing an epileptic seizure at the age of four.Daniel Tammet. (2014).

A. (2010). Islands of genius: The bountiful mind of the autistic, acquired, and sudden savant. Jessica Kingsley Publishers. Savant memory varies among different savants. Similar to DeBlois and Paravicini, an autistic savant named Leslie Lemke has displayed extraordinary musical talent. Lemke lacks the capacity for abstract reasoning, but he has several abilities that coincide with his exceptional memory. Like Paravicini, he is able to replicate music perfectly after hearing a piece only once.Treffert, D. A. (1989). An unlikely virtuoso: Leslie Lemke and the story of savant syndrome. The Sciences, 1, 28. Along with being mentally retarded, he has a disorder known as echolalia, a condition that involves the rote, often meaningless, repetition of words or sentences recited by others;Roberts, J. M. A. (2018). Echolalia. In E. Braaten (Ed.), The SAGE Encyclopedia of Intellectual and Developmental Disorders (Vol. 2, pp. 494-498). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Reference. Retrieved from https://link-gale- com.byui.idm.oclc.org/apps/doc/CX7423400158/GVRL?u=byuidaho&sid;=GVRL&xid;=f59e51ca however, when he does recite these words of whoever he hears throughout the day, his recall is almost always perfect. = Drawbacks = Individuals with autism are more likely to have savant skills so, for them, the most obvious drawback could be the drawbacks they link to autism itself. Most cases of calendrical calculation involve individuals with IQs that are below average. Autism spectrum disorders contain criteria for diagnosis based on difficulties with social behaviour and communicating with others, amongst other debilitating criteria. Researchers have proposed two hypotheses to explain how autistic individuals may develop advanced skills; the first is the obsession with constricted areas of interest (a common symptom of autism) and central coherence. Central coherence is a style of cognitive processing indicative of an autistic individual, which involves a focus on local features during processing. Researchers feel that this style of processing may aid in the increase of savant skills, but this style also sacrifices global processing in the process.  Mnemonists A mnemonic device is a memory aid that is used to help an individual remember and recall information. Mnemonic devices are usually verbal, such as a special phrase, word or a short poem that individuals are familiar with. Each individual has two types of memory, termed \\"natural memory\\" and \\"artificial memory\\". Mnemonic strategy is said to help develop artificial memory through learning and practicing memory techniques. Common mnemonics for memorizing lists of words is through the use of acronym, which is the abbreviation that consists of the initial letter in a phrase or word. For example, HOMES is often used to help remember the names of the Great Lakes of North America. Most techniques for memorizing numbers involve turning the numbers into visual images that are then placed along points of an imaginary memory journey. The mind has difficulty remembering abstract concepts like numbers but can easily remember visual images. The imaginary memory journey orders the images in the correct sequence. Two common techniques for converting numbers and playing cards into visual images are the Mnemonic major system and the Mnemonic dominic system. = Neuroscience = No structural differences have been found in the brains of accomplished mnemonists, who have achieved superior memory with the practiced use of mnemonic devices. One study that sought to locate the neural differences between these and people with typical memory abilities using fMRI, was unable to find any differences. For mnemonists, the right cingulate cortex, ventral fusiform cortex, and left posterior inferior frontal sulcus were more active for digit span memorization (a feat mnemonists are often very good at). However, all superior memory participants reported the use of mnemonics. = Cases = An interesting case of recall is of the subject S.F., who began testing with an average intelligence and average memory capabilities. With the use of mnemonic strategies (practice sessions in the laboratory) he was able to increase his digit span from 7 to 79. Specifically, S.F. was a long- distance runner and would form small groups of the digit span into meaningful and memorable numbers for a runner (ex. Qualifying times). Using mnemonics for memory recall may also have played a part in Akira Haraguchi's world record citation of mathematical pi. Cases such as these suggest that superior memory can be achieved with the proper mnemonic techniques. Also, all competitors of the annual World Memory Championships name mnemonic strategies the source for their performances, including performances like memorizing a list of more than 2000 digits in an hour, 280 words in 15 minutes or the order of a deck of cards in under 25 seconds. Chunking is another type of mnemonic device. This is a technique that involves grouping items together to improve sequential memory by having each item in mind generate a complete series of items. Many mnemonists credit chunking as their primary mnemonic device. One of the most well-known champions of memory who incorporates chunking as one of her primary memory techniques is Yanjaa Wintersoul. She was able to memorize all 328 pages of an Ikea catalogue in less than a week using mnemonics.Natasha Ann Zachariah. (16 October 2017). Memory champion Yanjaa Wintersoul memorised all 328 pages of the new catalogue in a week; Memory champion Yanjaa Wintersoul memorised all 328 pages of the new Ikea catalogue in a week. Straits Times, The (Singapore). These competitors demonstrate the power that mnemonics can have on enhancing recall and enabling the capacity for exceptional memory. = Drawbacks = Drawbacks are typically considered uncommon with the use of mnemonics since they are used as a tool to enhance memory ability, but there are qualities that can be considered negative. For example, it can take a significant amount of time to learn a mnemonic device, but this device may not be used often enough for it to be worth it. While mnemonics have been shown to increase recall capacity,Tawalare, K. K., & Tawalare, K. A. (2014). Use of Mnemonics to enhance learning in the BAMS Students. International Journal of Ayurvedic Medicine, 5(1), 55-62. the spatial context of mnemonics still contain the possibility of intrusion errors as well.Unsworth, N., & Brewer, G. A. (2010). Individual differences in false recall:A latent variable analysis.Journal of Memory and Language,62,19‚Äì34.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2009.08.002  Synesthesia  Synesthesia, a condition in which the stimulation of one sense causes an activation or reaction of one or more senses simultaneously, can be used as a mnemonic device to enable exceptional memory.Synesthesia. (2017). In D. Batten, P. Schummer, & H. Selden (Eds.), Human Diseases and Conditions (3rd ed., Vol. 4, pp. 1966-1970). Farmington Hills, MI: Charles Scribner's Sons.

Associating colors or words to letters or sounds can allow certain forms of synesthetes to learn new languages, lyrics, or detailed information quite easily.Shabir, Osman. (26 September 2019). Do Synesthetes Have Better Memory?. News-Medical. Retrieved on 1 July 2020 from https://www.news- medical.net/health/Do-Synesthetes-Have-Better-Memory.aspx. When seeking to learn novel categories, synesthetes tend to use their unusual experiences as mnemonic devices, aiding them in their memory process.Watson MR, Akins KA, Spiker C, Crawford L and Enns JT (2014) Synesthesia and learning: a critical review and novel theory. Front. Hum. Neurosci. 8:98. doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00098 Furthermore, synesthetic imagery can work as a cognitive tool in aiding those with synesthesia to memorize and store language through their own personal coding.Lvovich, Natasha, \\"The Gift: Synesthesia in Translingual Texts\\" (2012). CUNY Academic Works. https://academicworks.cuny.edu/kb_pubs/150 Those with more common forms of synesthesia may experience sounds as colors or words as having tastes; in these cases the sounds and words are considered the inducers, while the colors and tastes are considered concurrent.Grossenbacher, P. G., & Lovelace, C. T. (2001). Mechanisms of synesthesia: cognitive and physiological constraints. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 5(1), 36‚Äì41. https://doi.org/10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01571-0 It is important to note that not all people with synesthesia necessarily have exceptional memory, but it is most often based on how the condition is used in regard to learning. If someone has synesthesia, they are most often born with it, however, it is possible that it may develop later on in life.Ward, J. (2013). Synesthesia. Annual review of psychology, 64, 49-75. = Neuroscience = For grapheme- color synesthesia, studies display greater white matter connections happening between the fusiform gyrus (area responsible for processing the shape of numbers or letters) and color area V4 in brains of synesthetes.Rouw, R., & Scholte, H. S. (2007). Increased structural connectivity in grapheme-color synesthesia. Nature Neuroscience, 10, 792‚Äì797. These types of synesthetes display higher functioning in the ventral visual stream, and since graphemes and words have enhanced spatial frequency as well as contrast information, greater processing of these features leads to quicker access to lexical information.Rothen, N. ( 1,2,3 ), Seth, A. K. ( 1,5 ), Ward, J. ( 1,2 ), Oligschl√§ger, S. ( 2,6,7 ), & Berry, C. J. ( 4 ). (n.d.). A single system account of enhanced recognition memory in synaesthesia. Memory and Cognition, 48(2), 188‚Äì199. https://doi.org/10.3758/s13421-019-01001-8 = Cases = One well known case of superior recall ability through synesthesia is the case of Solomon Shereshevskii also known as \\"S\\". This ability was discovered during a work meeting where Shereshvskii was scolded for not taking notes until he was able to perfectly recite the conversation. Alexander Luria reported that \\"S\\" had the unique ability to recall almost everything he heard or saw though did not provide detailed evidence or clearly distinguish between \\"natural\\" abilities and his use of the method of loci. There are several anecdotal reports of \\"S\\" recalling a speech word for word without taking notes along with his peers. It is important to note that \\"S\\" is commonly considered a mnemonist as well, given that he applied his synesthesia as an aid toward acquiring exceptional memory. = Drawbacks = Solomon Shereshevskii, or 'S', was viewed by peers as disorganized and unintelligent. His extreme case of synesthesia, causing highly detailed and recallable memory traces, made understanding abstract concepts not based on sensory and perceptual qualities very difficult for him. His personal life is described as being lived in a \\"haze,\\" and eventually he was confined to a mental institution because of the burden of his exceptional abilities. But S is a rare exception and drawbacks are not normally associated with the acquisition of an exceptional memory by using synesthesia mnemonically.  Emotional memory  An emotional or flashbulb memory refers to the memory of a personal significant event with distinctly vivid and long-lasting detailed information. These events are usually shocking and with photographic quality. Brown and Kulik, who coined the term, found that many highly emotional memories can be recalled with very accurate details, even when there is a delay after the event. A Flashbulb memory is said to be less accurate and less permanent than photographic memories, but its forgetting curve is less affected by time in comparing to other types of memories. One important aspect of flashbulb memory is that it involves emotional arousal when the event is being remembered. Therefore, this kind of memory does not have to be accurate, and the accuracy usually decreases during the first 3 months and goes up again at about 12 months. An example of the errors and malleability of flashbulb memories is found in the El Al Flight 1862 crash. Despite widespread photos and videos of the effects of the crash, there is no video evidence of the crash itself. Despite this, when study participants were asked if they witnessed a video of the crash, over 60 percent claimed to have seen the video on television. Some participants were even willing to offer more information such as the angle of the crash or whether the plane was on fire, despite the lack of video. A study conducted by Sharot et al. (2006) showed that the rating of vividness of terrorist attack on 11 September 2001, by the participants is related to the physical location of the person when the event happened. = Neuroscience = The focus of the research on emotional memory is on the role of the amygdala. In one study participants watched either an emotionally arousing film or a neutral film. Results of a PET scan showed correlation between right Amygdaloid Complex (AC) activity and recall for emotional elements of the film when participants were asked to remember the film a few weeks later. Although this study demonstrates the involvement of the AC, it offers no insight as to the specific role of the amygdala. McGaugh and colleagues posit that although electrical and pharmaceutical stimulation directly to the amygdala can enhance or decrease memory, the amygdala is not the main site for any long-term memory storage. Rather, the amygdala acts as a modulator for storage processes occurring in other areas of the brain. Long-term memories are not created automatically, they must be consolidated over time. Research indicates that it is this consolidation process in which the AC plays an assisting role (there is no evidence that it aids in retrieval). Specifically, McGaugh suggests that emotional arousal activates the amygdala, which regulates the strength of a memory, lending to enhanced memory for emotionally charged events. The amygdala itself is a collection of nuclei with distinct functions, the basolateral AC the most involved with memory. The BL projects into the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex and stimulation of the AC functioning activates both of these areas. Further indication that the amygdala works to modulate other areas of the brain is supported by the fact that AC stimulation is mediated by the stria terminalis (ST), a major AC pathway. Lesions of the ST block AC stimulation effects. AC and ST lesions also appear to block hormonal and adrenaline enhancements. Stress hormones produced by emotional situations influence memory storage. Memory can also be selectively enhanced by post-training administration of drugs and hormones. It is also well known that emotional situations produce an \\"adrenaline rush\\". This adrenaline, as well as cortisol (adrenocortical hormone) serve to influence an organism's response to stress, but also may aid future responding by enhancing declarative memory of them. Negative emotional experiences may be remembered better than positive experiences. Goddard found that retention was disrupted with electrical stimulation of AC after aversive learning, but not with appetitively motivated learning. = Drawbacks = An experience must be very arousing to an individual for it to be consolidated as an emotional memory, and this arousal can be negative, thus causing a negative memory to be strongly retained. Having a long-lasting extremely vivid and detailed memory for negative events can cause a great deal of anxiety, as seen in post traumatic stress disorders. Individuals with PTSD endure flashbacks to traumatic events, with much clarity. Many forms of psychopathology show a tendency to maintain emotional experiences, especially negative emotional experiences, such as depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Patients with phobias are unable to cognitively control their emotional response to the feared stimuli. Although, not having the ability to use emotional memories for guiding future behaviours can be detrimental, as has been hypothesized as a potential cause to the lack of goal oriented behaviours in schizophrenic individuals.

Implicit measures of attitudes: Procedures and controversies. New York: Guillford Press. During four of the seven trial blocks in an IAT, categories and attributes share a response key (e.g. Bug or Bad, Flower or Good), with the underlying assumption being that participant response times will be quicker when the category and attribute are more closely associated. = Method/procedure = An Implicit Association Test: Participants must sort stimuli that appear in the middle of the screen into the appropriate group on the left or right The first two trial blocks have participants match stimuli only to categories or attributes, to allow participants to practice grouping the stimuli (Bug, Flower). The third and fourth trial blocks mark the first occurrence that a category and attribute share a response key, and during these blocks, categories and attributes are grouped in a congruently associative manner (e.g. Bug with Bad, Flower with Good). The fifth trial block has the category labels switch sides, and gives participants a chance to practice grouping stimuli from the category, with the new orientation of the labels (e.g. Flower, Bug). Finally, the sixth and seventh trial blocks have categories and attributes sharing a response key again, but now, because of the switching of sides for the category, labels are now presented in an incongruently associative manner (Flower and Bad, Bug and Good). but how do we know? Originally, a participant's performance during an IAT was scored in milliseconds, depending on how much time they took to respond each trial, but since then, an improved scoring algorithm has been created.Greenwald, A.G., Nosek, B.A., & Banaji, M.R. (2003). Understanding and using the Implicit Association Test: I. An improved scoring algorithm. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 85(2), 197-216 The resulting \\"D measure\\" was found to be superior in a variety of ways, such as creating larger correlations with explicit measures, and reducing the effects of prior IAT experience. Interpreting the D measure is also fairly straightforward, with high positive scores indicating a congruent implicit preference, high negative scores indicating an incongruent implicit preference, and scores around zero indicating a relatively neutral implicit preference. = Reliability and validity information = Implicit measures, especially latency-based ones, typically struggle to achieve a satisfactory level of internal consistency and test-retest reliability. However, the IAT possess acceptable levels of both, with one review finding that internal consistency values of IAT's typically ranged from .7 to .9.Greenwald, A.G., & Nosek, B.A. (2001). Health of the Implicit Association Test at age 3. Zeitschrift f√ºr Experimentelle Psychologie, 48, 85-93 In terms of test-retest reliability, the IAT has shown itself to be a relatively stable measure, however, little research has examined the test-retest reliability of the IAT with a gap in time larger than a month between administrations.Nosek, B.A., Greenwald, A.G., & Banaji, M.R. (2007). The Implicit Association Test at age 7: A methodological and conceptual review (Pp. 265-292). In J.A. Bargh (Ed.), Automatic processes in social thinking and behavior. Psychology Press. The IAT has also established itself to be an acceptably valid measure, and has demonstrated this through its convergent validity, discriminant validity, and predictive validity. The IAT's convergent and discriminant validity has been established through its comparison with explicit measures, whereby IAT's were found to relate to explicit measures targeting the traits, and not with explicit measures targeting unrelated traits. Additionally, multitrait-multimethod studies have demonstrated that although IATs and explicit measures may be related, they appear to be measuring different constructs. Overall, the IAT has been found to be an effective predictor of behavior, and is generally superior to self- report measures when dealing with topics of discrimination and stereotyping, especially when examining patterns of ingroup liking (e.g. preferring Canadians over Americans if one is Canadian, and vice versa if one is American). = Current research = The IAT is a procedure applied to a variety of research topics, including examinations of self-esteem, consumer studies, and human sexuality. Often, it is the IAT's ability to skirt socially desirable response biases that makes it an attractive method, and it is often used in lieu of, or alongside explicit self-report measures. Implicit self-esteem Implicit self-esteem IAT's utilize \\"self\\" and \\"other\\" as categories, and \\"positive\\" and \\"negative\\" as attributes.Greenwald, A.G., & Farnham, S.D.(2000). Using the Implicit Association Test to measure self- esteem and self-concept Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 79(6), 1022-1038 Participants who group \\"self\\" stimuli quicker when sharing a response with \\"positive\\" stimuli show positive implicit self-esteem. On the other hand, participants who group \\"self\\" stimuli quicker when sharing a response key with \\"negative\\" stimuli show low implicit self-esteem. In one implicit self-esteem IAT study, it was demonstrated that North American and Asian university students all have relatively high levels of implicit self- esteem.Yamaguchi, S., Greenwald, A.G., Banaji, M.R., Murakami, F., Chen, D., Shiomura, K., Kobayashi, C., Cai, H., & Krendl, A. (2007). Apparent universality of positive implicit self-esteem. Psychological Science, 18(6), 498-500 This is quite a difference when compared with explicit measures of self-esteem, as North American participants tended to have much higher levels of explicit self-esteem than their Asian counterparts, highlighting implicit self-esteem as a possibly universal phenomenon. Separate research examining the relationship of implicit and explicit self-esteem has determined that the two are separate, but weakly related constructs. Marketing and consumer studies The IAT has also been effectively used in the realm of marketing and consumer studies. In one such study, participant's attitudes towards Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows computers were compared using both an explicit measure and an IAT.Brunel, F.F., Tietje, B.C., & Greenwald, A.G. (2004). Is the Implicit Association Test a valid and valuable measure of implicit consumer social cognition? Journal of Consumer Psychology, 14(4), 385-404 The IAT used targets of \\"Windows\\" and \\"Mac\\" which were paired with attributes of \\"positive\\" and \\"negative\\". The researchers found that while correlations between explicit brand preference and implicit brand preference were high, that Mac users had stronger implicit preferences for their brand than Windows users. Other IAT research has also demonstrated that the IAT can reliably predict consumer behavior, including purchase intention, brand preference, and perceived brand superiority.Perkins, A., Forehand, M., Greenwald, A.G., & Maison, D. (2008). The influence of implicit social cognition on consumer behavior: Measuring the non-conscious. In C. Haugtvedt, P. Herr, & F. Kardes (Eds.), Handbook of Consumer Psychology (Pp. 461-475). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. Human sexuality Human sexuality research has been one area where the IAT has been slow to catch on as a procedure choice, as implicit sexual attitudes have not been investigated in earnestGeer, J.H. & Robertson, G.G. (2005). Implicit attitudes in sexuality: Gender differences. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 34(6), 671-677 and most of the research has focused on attitudes towards condom use, and attitudes towards gay and lesbian people. In one study, researchers found that while explicit attitudes towards gays and lesbians were generally positive, implicit attitudes towards gay men were negative, as were men's implicit attitudes towards lesbians.Steffens, M.C. (2005). Implicit and explicit attitudes towards lesbians and gay men. Journal of Homosexuality, 49(2), 39-66 Additionally, the IAT has been found to be extremely effective at predicting the sexual orientation of gay and heterosexual men.Snowden, R.J., Wichter, J., & Gray, N.S. (2008). Implicit and explicit measurements of sexual preferences in gay and heterosexual men: A comparison of Priming Techniques and the Implicit Association Test Archives of Sexual Behavior, 37, 558-565 Finally, research comparing heterosexual men and women found that heterosexual women harbor more negative explicit and implicit attitudes towards sex than males. = Criticisms = Previous criticisms of the IAT typically centered around the notion that IAT effects were a product of familiarity with stimulus items, rather than actual implicit attitudes. However, additional research seems to have addressed this concern as several studies have shown that IAT effects are not on account of familiarity.Dasgupta, N., McGhee, D.E., Greenwald, A.G., & Banaji, M.R. (2000). Automatic preference for white American: Eliminating the familiarity explanation. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, (36), 316-328. One such study found that implicit attitudes towards White Americans were much more positive compared to Black Americans, even when equally unfamiliar stimuli were used to represent these categories. Currently, most of the criticisms of the IAT center around the accuracy of its communicated purpose, as some have interpreted the IAT to act as a kind of lie detector to get at attitudes that are \\"more true\\". However, the creators of the IAT assert that participants' implicit attitudes may differ from self-report for a number of reasons, such as they are unaware of these implicit biases, are aware of the implicit biases but reject them as incongruent with their beliefs, or are aware of the implicit biases and simply attempt to hide them, and only in the third case does the IAT fit the description of detecting hidden beliefs. In conclusion the authors state that the difference between the IAT and self- report measures of attitudes is that self-report measures require introspection, while the IAT does not: they simply measure different things and one is not more associated with truth than the other.  Lexical decision task (LDT)  The first experimenters to use the lexical decision task (LDT) were Meyer and Schvaneveldt in 1971 who measured semantic decisions and showed that people are faster to respond to words when they have already been shown a prime that is semantically related, for example faster to confirm \\"nurse\\" as a word when it is preceded by \\"doctor\\" than when it is preceded by \\"butter\\".Meyer, D.E., & Schvaneveldt, R.W. (1971). Facilitation in Recognizing Pairs of Words: Evidence of a Dependence Between Retrieval Operations. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 90(2), 227-234 = Method/procedure = The lexical decision task is an implicit memory task in which participants are given a stimulus (a string of letters), and asked to decide whether this string is a word or a nonword. Nonwords are made by replacing at least one letter in a word with another letter (ex. mark becomes marb). Vowels are used to replace vowels and consonants are used to replace consonants. Response times are the main measure in these tasks and they are measured as a function of the string's meaning, familiarity, and the frequency of the word. Response times are also measured to see if they reflect what has occurred previously - like if the participant has been recently exposed to these words or if they relate to ideas that the participant has been recently thinking about.Duchek, J.M., & Neely, J.H. (1989). A Dissociate Word-Frequency X Levels-of-Processing Interaction in Episodic Recognition and Lexical Decision Tasks. Memory and Cognition, 17, 148-162 It has been found that people respond faster to words they have recently been exposed to as well as to words that relate to ideas that the person has recently been thinking about. The original task consisted of a stimulus that involved either a pair of words, a word and a nonword, or a pair of nonwords. The participants are asked to respond \\"yes\\" if both strings are words, and \\"no\\" in the other two conditions (if there is a word and a nonword, or if there are two nonwords). Another variation of this answering scheme is for participants to respond \\"same\\" if the strings are either both words or both nonwords, and \\"different\\" if one of the strings is a word and the other is a nonword. \\"The stimuli were generated on a Stromberg Carlson SC4060 graphics system, photographed on 16-mm movie film and presented on a rear-projection screen by a Perceptual Development Laboratories' Mark III Perceptoscope.\\" The participants were told to look at a fixation box which appeared on the screen for 1 second and after this the stimulus was displayed. The participants used a panel with finger keys for their right and left hands to respond. The right index finger pressed the \\"yes\\" (or \\"same\\") button and the left index finger pressed the \\"no\\" (or \\"different\\") button. By counting the cycles of a 1000 Hz oscillator, the participants' reaction times were measured to the nearest millisecond; the response times were measured from the time the stimulus was presented until the response was made by the participant. = On-line = The more recent version of the lexical decision task is on-line. In these experiments stimuli are usually words from a series of text, that are presented either visually or auditorially to participants one word at a time. Part way through the presentation of the text, a string of letters is presented visually to the participant and their task is to decide if this is a word or a nonword.McKoon, G., Ratcliff, R., & Ward, G. (1994). Testing Theories of Language Processing: An Empirical Investigation of the On- Line Lexical Decision Task. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 20(5), 1219-1228 Participants respond by pressing the corresponding key on their keyboard. This is commonly the \\"?\\" and \\"/\\" key for \\"yes\\" and \\"z\\" for \\"no\\". This technique measures reaction time and accuracy and has been used to examine our understanding of word meanings and syntactic structures. = Current research = Current LDT research has increased the knowledge of inter-hemispheric communication in people with and without reading disabilities.Rutherford, B.J. (2006). Reading Disability and hemispheric interaction on a lexical decision task. Brain and Cognition 60. 55-63. The left hemisphere of the brain uses a phonological, non-lexical strategy that changes graphemes into phonemes to sound out strings of letters. People with reading disabilities, specifically phonological dyslexia, and people without reading disabilities participated in a LDT task and it was found that experience in a task improves hemispheric asymmetry in the brain. Moreover, there is a transformation from no asymmetry in nonword conditions to a clear left hemisphere advantage in word conditions. It was also shown that the left hemisphere is enhanced by experience in familiar word conditions which results in the suppression of the right hemisphere in these conditions for both people with and without reading disabilities. This shows that hemispheric asymmetry for lexical processing is not altered by having a reading disability. Finally, responses in the pseudoword condition were slower when people with phonological dyslexia were only using their left hemisphere which suggests that there's more reliance on lexical processing by the right hemisphere than non-lexical processing by the left hemisphere. This research has furthered the knowledge of inter-hemispheric communication in people with reading disabilities so that now inter-hemispheric communication for the processing of unfamiliar and pseudowords is all that is needed to help people with phonological dyslexia develop a non-lexical strategy. The identification of a critical time period in which an intervention should take place is also needed. = Alternate theory and criticisms = In the standard LDT participants have to read the string of letters in front of them, decide if it is a word or not, and then make their response by pressing a key. This version of the LDT has been criticized for participants having more errors and longer response times due to the fact that they have to remember which key to press (yes key if it is a word and no key if it is not a word) after they have decided if the string is a word or not. The go/no-go taskNosek, B. A., & Banaji, M. R. (2001). The go/no-go association task. Social Cognition, 19(6), 161-176. is an alternate task that has been proposed to see if the response selection is actually resulting in slower response times and more errors for participants. A study was conducted to look at this, using both the yes/no LDT and the go/no-go LDT. In the go/no-go task the participants are asked to press the mouse with their dominant hand if the string of letters presented to them on the screen is a word, and do nothing if it is not a word. In comparing the two tasks it was found that the response times of the go/no-go task were faster and more accurate than those of the yes/no task. This result was also present in an associative priming experiment where the priming effect was found to be greater for the go/no-go task than for the yes/no task.Perea, M., Rosa, E., & Gomez, C. (2002). Is the go/no-go lexical decision task an alternative to the yes/no lexical decision task? Memory & Cognition, 30(1), 34-45. In both experiments there was also a dramatic decrease in the number of errors made for people in the go/no-go condition implying that the go/no-go task has an advantage over the yes/no task because there is no response selection to be made, therefore decreasing the response times and errors made.  Word stem completion (WSC) task  One of the first uses of the word stem completion (WSC) task was by Elizabeth K. Warrington and L. Weiskrantz in 1970.Warrington, E. K., & Weiskrantz L. (1970) Amnesic syndrome: Consolidation or retrieval?. Nature, 228, 628-630. These researchers used the WSC task to examine the memory of verbal material in amnesic patients. They asked amnesic participants to read a list of words three times and then tested them on recall, recognition, fragmented words or a WSC task (the first few initial letters were presented). They found the amnesic participants to be worse than controls on recall and recognition, but performed equally to control participants on fragmented words and WSC tasks. This suggested that long-term memory can be demonstrated in amnesic patients using the WSC task. = Method/procedure = The WSC task is a verbal test of perceptual implicit memory. In this task a participant is presented with the first few letters of a word and asked to complete the word stem with the first word that they can think of. The participants are usually unaware that they have to complete these tasks using words that they have previously seen. An example of a WSC task would be presenting the word \\"lettuce\\" in such a way that a participant was not aware that this word would be useful later. After a given time the participant would be given the word stem \\"LET____\\" and asked to complete it with the first word that comes to mind. Participants are using their implicit memory if they complete the word stem with the previously presented word, in this case lettuce. To construct a WSC task for a study, researchers will usually use a thesaurus to generate a large pool of words, including both general words and the words to be primed. With the use of a dictionary, this pool of words is slowly reduced to a smaller amount. Using information from pilot testing the smaller pool is shrunken to the desired number of word stems for the test. = Theory = Some researchers predict that when an individual is primed with a word a schema is activated in the brain, producing further activation of the components of that schema.Graf, P., & Mandler, G. (1984). Activation makes words more accessible, but not necessarily more retrievable. Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 23, 553-568 This activation strengthens the internal organization of the schema, making the word more accessible because it will come to mind more readily when only some of its components are presented. In the WSC task this is exactly what happens, the first few letters are shown, which activate the components of the schema. The processing of a word increases its accessibility and the probability that this word will be produced even when only some of its components are presented (i.e. the first few letters of the word). Since the WSC task is measuring implicit memory, all of this happens without the participant being aware of it. = Current research = The WSC task has been used in recent years to measure whether learning can occur when a patient is under anesthesia. In one study, 14 words were played, either before surgery or during surgery, through headphones to patients anesthetized with propofol.Deeprose, C., Andrade, J., Varma, S., & Edwards, N. (2004) Unconscious learning during surgery with propofol anesthesia. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 92(2), 171-177. Once patients had recovered, their memory was assessed using an auditory WSC test. This has the same procedure as a WSC task using images of the words, except the first part of the word is heard instead of seen during testing. The patients were also tested for explicit memory of the words using a recall test. The researchers found that none of the patients had explicit recall for the words listened to while being under anesthesia. Furthermore, patients under anesthesia who listened to the words before surgery did not show any implicit learning using the WSC task. However, patients under anesthesia who listened to the words during surgery showed implicit memory using the WSC task. Although, it is important to note that the amount of learning is quite small and the results of this study are weak. Researchers have also been using WSC tasks to investigate the implicit impact of exposure to appearance and weight related images in the media.Tiggemann, M., Hargreaves D., Polivy, J., & McFarlane, T. (2004). A word-stem completion task to access implicit processing of appearance-related information. Journal of Psychosomatic Research, 57, 73-78. In one study two groups of participants, a control group who watched a nonappearance related video and an experimental group who watched an appearance related video, were asked to complete twenty word stems with the first word that came to mind. The word stems were created with the possibility of being completed with an appearance related word or a nonappearance related word. For example, SLE___ could be completed with slender, an appearance related word or with sleep, a nonappearance related word. For both females and males, results showed that watching an appearance related video before completing a WSC task significantly increased the number of appearance related responses. This study shows that the WSC task can be successfully used to explore the implicit influences of the media. = Limitations = Researchers have compared the WSC task to the word identification test, the word fragment completion test, and the anagram solution test. They used four different types of presentation for the studying of words to test and compare these implicit memory tasks. The four types of presentation studied were: visual where the font was the same on the test, visual that was a different font from the test, auditory and picture. Conclusions from this study are that the WSC task has better results when participants are primed visually and worse results when participants are primed using the auditory and picture conditions. Furthermore, research has shown that priming effects for the WSC task usually disappear within two hours.Graf, P., Mandler, G., & Haden P. (1982). Simulating amnesic symptoms in normal subjects. Science, 218, 1243-1244.  Artificial grammar learning (AGL) = Method/procedure = An example of a finite state language. Each time an arrow is chosen, a letter is added, until the OUT arrow is chosen. An example of a grammatical string produced using this grammar is ZGGF. An example of an ungrammatical string is ZGFG. Artificial grammar learning (AGL) is a task designed to test the process of implicit learning, which is the unconscious acquisition of knowledge and the use of this knowledge without consciously activating it.Pothos, E. (2007). Theories of artificial grammar learning. Psychological Bulletin, 133(2), 227-244. It involves the use of a \\"finite state language\\", which is a potentially infinite set of items made up of symbols following a finite set of rules, which constitutes a grammar.Chomsky, N, & Miller, G. (1958). Finite state languages. Information and Control, 1, 91-112. It was first introduced in 1967 by Arthur S. Reber.Reber, A. S. (1967). Implicit learning of artificial grammars. Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 6, 855-863. In the standard AGL paradigm based on Reber's work, a \\"language\\" that consists of a vocabulary of letters (for example, Z, K, F, G and B) and grammatical rules for putting these letters into sentences is constructed. The grammar consists of a number of states, where the addition of a letter causes the transition from one state to another, until the end state is achieved. In the learning phase of the AGL task, the experimental group is given a number of sentences created using the artificial grammar. The control group is given a number of random strings made up of the same letters, but not following the rules of the artificial grammar. Both groups are told that they are doing a memory task, and must memorize the letter strings and then reproduce them. In the test phase, both groups are told that each letter string was actually a sentence created using a complex set of grammatical rules. They are each given a number of new sentences, some grammatically correct and some not, and are asked to judge the grammaticality of each. The results show that most participants can consistently make accurate grammatical/non-grammatical assessments of the new sentences, even though few can correctly articulate the rules that they are using to make those assessments. = Current research = AGL is used in many studies as a measure of implicit learning or memory along with a separate test for explicit learning or memory in response to a certain variable. One study investigated the relationship between age and learning style, i.e. explicit versus implicit.Midford, R., & Kirsner, K. (2005). Implicit and explicit learning in aged and young adults. Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition, 12, 359-387. An AGL task was used because of its ability to measure both implicit and explicit learning. One group of participants was given strings made from a complex grammar, with no mention in the instructions about the underlying rules. This was thought to increase the amount of implicit learning, as more complex rules are harder to perceive and participants were not attempting to find them. Another group was given strings made from a simple grammar, with instructions to try to figure out the rules. This was thought to increase the amount of explicit learning, as participants were consciously attempting to find rules that were easy to perceive. The results showed that aged adults performed poorly on the task that emphasized explicit learning compared to young adults; however, both groups performed similarly on the task that emphasized implicit learning. This demonstrates that the aging effects seen with explicit memory do not have an effect on implicit memory. A 2002 study was done investigating the neural correlates of AGL.Skosnik, P. D., Mirza, D., Gitelman, D. R., Parrish, T. B., Mesulam, M-M., & Reber, P. J. (2002). Neural correlates of artificial grammar learning. NeuroImage, 17, 1306-1314. Data from amnesic patients with medial temporal damage whose performance on AGL tasks is no different from controls show that this area is not implicated with AGL.Knowlton, B. J., & Squire, L. R. (1996). Artificial grammar learning depends on implicit acquisition of both abstract and exemplar-specific information. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition. 22(1), 169-181. The learning phase was conducted as usual for the participants, and the test phase was conducted with the participants inside an fMRI scanner. The results showed a greater activity in the left superior occipital cortex and right fusiform gyrus for grammatical stimuli, and greater activity in the left angular gyrus during grammaticality judgments, as compared to a matched recognition control task. = Alternate theories and criticisms = Reber's original AGL theory is rule-based; participants learn and apply the formal rules of the artificial grammar through viewing grammatical strings. However, there are many alternate theories to describe the knowledge that is obtained through learning an artificial grammar. Microrules This theory states that participants do not acquire the abstract rules exactly as stated by the artificial grammar. Instead, participants develop their own rules based on small sections of each letter string. For example, they may notice that an F always comes after an M. The existing AGL paradigm is criticized for having only two responses: grammatical or non-grammatical. In one study, participants were asked to indicate why they felt a certain sentence was grammatical or non-grammatical. In the test phase, the participants were told to either cross out the part of each string that made it non-grammatical, or underline the part that made it grammatical. This indicated the microrules that each participant was consciously applying. The results showed that participants acquired a large number of imperfect and limited rules, however, they do lead to consistently correct judgments of grammaticality and non-grammaticality.Dulany, D. E., Carlson, R. A., & Dewey, G. I. (1984). A case of syntactical learning and judgment: How conscious and how abstract? Journal of Experimental Psychology, 113(4), 541-555. Similarity The specific similarity theory states that learning occurs by encoding each letter string in the learning phase as a whole. Grammaticality judgments in the test phase are made by comparing novel letter string to the ones already in memory. The more similar a string is to the remembered strings, the more grammatical it is reported to be. A variant of this theory suggests that the representation of each letter string is pooled into a larger representation of multiple strings, and grammaticality is assessed by comparing the similarity of novel items to this pooled representation.Vokey, J. R., & Brooks, L. R. (1992). Salience of item knowledge in learning artificial grammars. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 18, 2, 328-344. Another similarity model suggests that smaller surface features of each string are stored as well as the string as a whole. Each novel letter string is compared to the collection of features in memory and their similarity is used to determine grammaticality.Kinder, A., & Assmann, A. (2000). Learning artificial grammars: No evidence for the acquisition of rules. Memory & Cognition, 28(8), 1321-1332. Similarity can also be called familiarity in some theories.Scott, R. B., & Dienes, Z. (2008). The conscious, the unconscious, and familiarity. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 34(5), 1264-1288. Chunking In the competitive chunking hypothesis, knowledge of a letter string develops along a hierarchy of \\"chunks\\", beginning with bigrams (two letters), leading to trigrams, four-grams, and so on.Servan- Schreiber, E., & Anderson, J. R. (1990). Learning artificial grammars with competitive chunking. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 16 (4), 592-608. \\"Chunk strength\\" refers to the frequency of occurrence of any given chunk during the learning phase. The higher the chunk strength of an item, the more likely it is to be determined grammatical.Robinson, P. (2005). Cognitive abilities, chunk-strength, and frequency effects in implicit artificial grammar and incidental L2 learning: Replications of Reber, Walkenfeld, and Hernstadt (1991) and Knowlton and Squire (1996) and their relevance for SLA. Studies in Second Language Acquisition, 27, 235-268. Hybrid theory Some researchers don't believe that AGL can be explained using only one of the theories mentioned above. A hybrid theory claims that a knowledge of the abstract grammar rules as well as of the surface features of the letter strings are obtained while learning the artificial grammar, and that both are used to determine the grammaticality of novel letter strings. A study investigating a hybrid theory showed that not only did participants use both of these types of knowledge in their grammaticality judgments, but amnesic patients who had lost use of their explicit memory were also able to make grammaticality judgments using both types of knowledge. This shows that both the abstract grammar rules and the surface features of the strings are implicitly learned and implemented.  Word fragment completion (WFC)  The word fragment completion test (WFC) is a test designed to measure memory of words presented to participants. Words that were previously shown to participants are presented again in a fragmented form (i.e. missing letters) with the task of retrieving the missing letters from memory to complete it. This task calls on implicit memory because at the time of word presentation, participants have not consciously stored the items in memory; they have merely been exposed to them.MacLeod, C. M., Kampe, K. E. (1996). Word frequency effects on recall, recognition, and word fragment completion tests. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition. 22(1), 132-142 To avoid participants consciously trying to retain the items presented, which would result in a test of explicit memory, they are often mislead about the purpose of the study through irrelevant tasks that are given which require their conscious attention. Implicit memory can then be observed when participants perform better on the WFC test for words that have been presented than for words that have not.Schacter, D. L. (1987). Implicit memory: History and current status. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition. 13(3), 501-518 This effect is known as priming and is the key demonstration of this test. = Method/procedure= Since the main objective of this implicit test is to assess priming effects,Tulving, E., Schacter, D. L. & Stark, H. A. (1982). Priming effects in word-fragment completion are independent of recognition memory. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition. 8(4), 336-342 the WFC assessment is typically administered after a presentation period of the to-be-tested words. Subjects are typically presented with the items as read directly from a list by a test administrator or by the participants themselves. To ensure that implicit memory is being measured rather than explicit memory, participants can be given irrelevant tasks in this stage to distract them from attempting to memorize the to-be-tested words (E.g. Sort various squares by size). Participants in research studies often try to determine the experimenters' goals and respond in ways which would support their hypotheses, which makes distracter tasks crucial to the validity of studies. Another step to ensure participants are not relying on explicit memory is to place a time delay between the learning phase and the test phase. This interferes with primacy and recency effects because it interrupts the active rehearsal of the listed items. After being exposed to the items (learning phase), the participants enter the test phase. They are presented with fragments of the words that were shown in the learning phase, in addition to new words that serve as a baseline of performance (i.e. performance on non-primed words). Participants are then instructed to complete the fragments with the first word that comes to mind.Nelson, D. L., Canas, J. J., Bajo, M. T, & Keelean, P. D. (1987). Comparing word fragment completion and cued recall with letter cues. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition. 13(4), 542-552 Priming effects are evident when performance on the originally presented words exceeds performance on the new words. The types of words that are presented are typically ones that are used infrequently in everyday language. Words that are lower in frequency are more likely to be identified correctly in the WFC test because they are more distinct, which makes them easier to recall. Presented words also tend to be longer (7 or 8 characters) than words presented in other implicit memory tests and the fragments are presented in such a way that only 1 or 2 possibilities for completion exist. An example of a WFC test is as follows: Participants are presented with a list of words including ASSASSIN, EMISSARY, MYSTERY, PENDULUM, and THEOREM, among others. A distracter task is utilized to redirect the participant's attention; they are asked to sort paint chips into their respective colour categories (red, blue, green, etc.). Participants are then presented with a fragment of a previously exposed word, A_ _A_ _IN, along with other fragments of primed words and new words. = Current research = One of the findings of this test is the distinction between performance on high and low frequency words. It is already understood that a distinction exists for word frequency with respect to recall and recognition memory, but this test in particular helped build evidence for this distinction in implicit memory rather than explicit memory alone. For both direct and indirect tests (explicit and implicit, respectively), performance is better for the free recall of high frequency words and better for the recognition of low frequency words. Low frequency words are more distinct and stand out, so when one is presented, it is easier to determine if it has been seen before (i.e. if the item is recognized) because of its distinctiveness in memory. Recall and recognition tests have different performance rates for different types of tests because they involve different levels of processing (LOP).Challis, B. H., & Brodbeck, D. R. (1992). Level of processing affects priming in word fragment completion. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 18(3), 595-607 Recall tests require one to generate the information in its entirety, a deeper LOP, while recognition tests require one to determine if a stimulus has been previously presented, a shallow LOP. Research on LOP has further supported the finding that priming effects last longer for WFC than that of other implicit memory tests. WFC performance remains high for words presented in a learning phase of an experiment for up to a week before dropping down to baseline levels, while performance on other tests, such as Artificial Grammar Learning, dropped down after only a few hours. An interesting finding through the use of this test is that the first letter of a word is particularly important in participants' ability to correctly determine its identity. One study presented fragments of words with the first letter deleted (e.g. _urse) and found that performance rates were significantly lower than words that had the first letter intact (e.g. p_rse). This may be because the first letter is the first cue for what the word to follow may be. WFC is a test of the unconscious retention of information and so the majority of the new research associated with this test is geared towards implicit memory. One application of tests such as this one is with patients who have amnesia. When the distinction between explicit and implicit memory was first determined, it was hypothesized that amnesiacs may not have lost all of their memory after all. In fact, when tests that measure implicit memory are administered to people who suffer from amnesia, they show tendencies of responding to stimuli in ways which correlate with information previously presented but not explicitly remembered.

It can have both positive and negative effects on different aspects of memory. Caffeine molecule Short-term memory The effects of caffeine on short-term memory (STM) are controversial. Findings are inconsistent, as many effects of caffeine sometimes impair short-term and working memory, whereas the other studies indicate enhancing effects. Increasing our capacities of STM and working memory only seem to have beneficial impacts upon our daily lives. Increasing our memory capacities would result in retaining more information for extended periods of time and encoding information from STM to long-term memory. However, the research consensus indicates an inhibitory effect, reducing the capacity of our short- term memory and working memory. =Auditory effects within short-term memory= Caffeine‚Äôs effects in memory were also investigated in the auditory system. The Auditory-Verbal Learning Test is a memory test that assesses recall of lists of words on single and multiple trials given through the subjects' auditory system. Caffeine subjects recalled fewer words than did control subjects, and caffeine subjects showed a greater deficit in recalling the middle- to end-portions of the lists. =Working memory effects= Caffeine has been thought to have some benefits when testing working memory by investigating the tip of the tongue effect, the idea being that, if caffeine were present in one's system, then one would be less likely to experience tip of the tongue effect, or the feeling of knowing a familiar word but not being able to immediately recall it. Previous research suggested that the tip of the tongue phenomena can be corrected for with the use of caffeine, and that caffeine could help one to more quickly retrieve the word they are looking for. Current research refutes previous research accrediting evidence to priming a phonological loop within the working memory opposed to caffeine enhancing STM capacity. A study has found that there are more correct tip of the tongue answers with a caffeine group than those of the control group. The finding is not that caffeine improves performance; it was finding the priming of the phonological-system-effecting responses. When attempting to comprise tip of the tongue effects, subjects were primed with similar-sounding words to the target word; as a result, priming the target word was reached faster regardless of caffeine intake. A test also studied the effects of caffeine on working memory by administering word lists to subjects. Ultimately, the study found that there was a difference in the results for male and female subjects. Male subjects saw no change in their ability to recall the word lists, thus caffeine showed no effect on their working memory, while females under the effects of the caffeine supplement saw their ability to recall the word lists negatively effected and thus their working memories slightly impaired by the drug =Time-of-day effects= Short-term memory has been thought to be influenced differently throughout the day when caffeine has been ingested; in the morning, STM performance will be different from at the end of the day. As the effects of caffeine wear off, there would be some effect on STM. Three groups of caffeine intake (low, medium, and high) were compared during four daytime hours (01:00, 07:00, 13:00, 19:00). People with low caffeine intake have a decreased performance later in the day, compared to moderate and a high-level caffeine intake. Thus the effect of caffeine on short term memory can differ due to many other factors and thus cannot be instantly generalized. = State Dependent Memory = Caffeine users are subject to state dependent memory effects when under the effects of caffeine. For example, a study tasked two groups of subjects to remember word lists; half of them had caffeine while the other half were given placebos. When brought back the next day, each original group was now split in half, half of them given the same treatment they were encoded under, the other half given the opposite treatment. Ultimately the study showed that subjects that were under the same treatment in both encoding and retrieval out performed the other groups. This study does not support a decline or enhancement in working memory due to caffeine but rather a state dependent effect instead. Long-term memory Caffeine has been shown to have positive, negative, and no effects on long-term memory. When studying the effects of this and any drug, potential ethical restraints on human study procedures may lead researchers to conduct studies involving animal subjects in addition to human subjects. =Positive effects of caffeine on long-term memory= Positive effects of caffeine on long-term memory have been shown in a study analyzing habitual caffeine intake of coffee or tea in addition to consuming other substances. Their effect on cognitive processes was observed by performing numerous cognitive tasks. Words were presented and delayed recall was measured. Increased delayed recall was demonstrated by individuals with moderate to high habitual caffeine intake (mean 710 mg/week) as more words were successfully recalled compared to those with low habitual caffeine intake (mean 178 mg/week). Therefore, improved performance in long- term memory was shown with increased habitual caffeine intake due to better storage or retrieval. A similar study assessing effects of caffeine on cognition and mood resulted in improved delayed recall with caffeine intake. A dose-response relationship was seen as individuals were able to recall more words after a period of time with increased caffeine. Improvement of long-term memory with caffeine intake was also seen in a study using rats and a water maze. In this study, completion of training sessions prior to performing numerous trials in finding a platform in the water maze was observed. Caffeine was consumed by the rats before and after the training sessions. There was no effect of caffeine consumption before the training sessions; however, a greater effect was seen at a low dosage immediately afterward. In other words, the rats were able to find the platform faster when caffeine was consumed after the training sessions rather than before. This implies that memory acquisition was not affected, while increases in memory retention were. =Negative effects of caffeine on long-term memory= Researchers have found that long-term consumption of low dose caffeine slowed hippocampus-dependent learning and impaired long-term memory in mice. Caffeine consumption for 4 weeks also significantly reduced hippocampal neurogenesis, a process by which the brain creates new neurons to assist in memory retention, compared to controls during the experiment. The conclusion was that long-term consumption of caffeine could inhibit hippocampus-dependent learning and memory partially through inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis. Caffeine has been shown to have negative effects on long-term memory. In a study with mice, a step- through passive-avoidance task was used, and the ability to remember the task was assessed. Caffeine was given before the task in varying doses, with low doses to start (11.55 mg/kg) and higher doses in the end (92.4 mg/kg). (To put that in perspective, one 8 oz cup of coffee contains 95‚Äì200 mg of caffeine.) An apparatus including a box with a light was connected to a dark box with an electric floor. When the mice entered the dark box, a shock was released from the floor. The next day, the mice entered the apparatus again and completed the same task. Subjects that did not enter the dark box for 180 seconds were thought to have put the task in long-term memory, remembering the assignment from the previous day. However, caffeine administered at higher doses resulted in decreased retention time of the task from 180 seconds to 105 seconds. Lower doses of caffeine had little to no effect on retention time. Therefore, in this study, linear regression analysis showed that higher doses of caffeine impaired long-term memory, suggesting a dose-response relationship between caffeine intake and retention time. Ultimately, long-term memory and caffeine intake display varying results, in human as well as animal subjects. =No effect of caffeine on long-term memory= Alternatively, other studies have shown that caffeine intake has no effect on long-term memory. This was expressed in a study whereby either caffeine or a placebo was assigned to several subjects at two different times. Some subjects received caffeine first, while others received a placebo. All participants were shown a word list which would eventually be tested. Two days later, the same process was repeated, with random distribution of the two substances. This was also observed in a study involving the assessment of delayed recall using a verbal memory test. Two studies were completed using different control drinks containing caffeine. Age differences=Effects on young adults= The effects for this age group (15-25) were the most variable and conflicting. On the one hand, caffeine effects appear to be detrimental to short-term memory, working memory included, whereas the effects are somewhat positive for memory over the long term (for example, you remember something better many days later if you drank caffeine during encoding as well as retrieval, as opposed to no caffeine). Many of the effects reported were for subjects who were not regular caffeine consumers. Regular consumers of caffeine, on the other hand, showed only positive effects when it came to memory tasks. An important factor to consider is that there was fairly wide-range daily caffeine consumption previous to the study, and this could have had a significant effect on performance of the task because not everyone is at the same baseline. Another study used a much larger subject pool and found that age-related differences were quite minimal for attentional memory, but that over the long term, regular caffeine consumption was fairly beneficial to younger subjects. =Effects on the middle aged= As previously stated, the most pronounced effect of caffeine on memory appears to be on middle-aged subjects (26-64). None of the studies provide reasoning for why this group would be most affected, but one could hypothesize that because of cognitive decline due to age, caffeine has a powerful effect on brain chemistry (although this would suggest the older the person, the stronger the effect of caffeine). Furthermore, this age group is most likely to be the largest consumer of caffeine. The main studies reporting this finding show that at low, acute doses of caffeine consumption, working memory only slightly affects those in this age group, while no effect is observed for younger or older subjects. The authors conclude that larger doses may be needed to produce results that are supported by previous literature, and this is an avenue for further research. Furthermore, it is argued that consumption of caffeine generally aids cognitive performance for this age group, as long one does not exceed the recommended dose of 300 mg per day. =Effects on the elderly= In older adults, memory is typically best in the morning and gradually declines over the day. Those who consumed caffeine in the morning showed much better memory, both short-term and long-term than those who consumed a placebo, especially in late afternoon, where memory and attention may be most crucial to daily functioning for the elderly. This is further supported by a study which showed that adults over the age of 65 who regularly consume caffeine in the morning are much more alert and function at a higher cognitive level throughout the day. The authors conclude that it is beneficial for older adults to regularly consume average doses of caffeine in the morning to boost cognitive performance and alertness in the afternoon. Again, one should not exceed the recommended dose of about 300 mg per day, otherwise memory performance declines due to over-consumption. =Conclusion= The literature shows mixed results. Overall regular caffeine consumption has a positive effect on one's short- and long-term memory only when consumed on a regular basis. Consumption should be daily, in moderate doses, and at around the same time, regardless of age. Sex differences Many studies provide support for the idea that caffeine has different effect on males versus females when related to memory. These differences can be seen through a number of memory types (short-term, long-term, etc.), with various theories accounting for these differing effects. =Short-term memory= Caffeine has been shown to have an impairing effect on females (but not males) in a word-list test of short-term memory. One prevailing theory which aims to explain this sex difference identifies estrogen levels in the body as an important factor relating to caffeine‚Äôs effect on memory performance As a result, the female menstrual cycle (which influences overall estrogen levels in the body) may play a role in modifying the effect of caffeine on memory. Following this theory, researchers tested females within the first 5 days of their menstrual cycle and found that caffeine had a facilitative effect on female performance on a short-term memory test. A particular finding in this study relating to male memory performance revealed that at a lower dose, caffeine had an impairing effect; but at higher doses, no impairment was shown. Differing speeds of testing (words delivered slowly or quickly) in males served as a modifying factor on the effect of caffeine: higher doses aided in recall with faster presentation of words, and lower doses aided in recall with slower presentation of words. These findings are only based on a small set of data collected from selective studies on this topic, so further research in this area would be needed to gain a more clear understanding of caffeine's differing effects on male and female short-term memory. =Long-term memory= Limited research on long-term memory and sex differences indicates no notable difference in the effect of caffeine between males and females. Sex differences have not been thoroughly covered in the literature concerning caffeine‚Äôs effect on memory. Since most studies do not report significant sex differences in this area of memory study, it is reasonable to assume that there is not strong evidence to support sex differences in caffeine‚Äôs effect on memory. Further specific research into sex differences would be needed to fully understand the impacts of this popular drug on its users. Withdrawal Caffeine withdrawal has been known about for over a hundred years. However, there are still many unknowns that exist because only within the last decade has it been researched scientifically. Currently, there is no known correlation between caffeine withdrawal and an effect on memory. There are many potential reasons for the lack of conclusions made about this issue. The main speculation is that since caffeine affects many parts of the central nervous system, this would imply that there is more than one mechanism that is activated by caffeine. It would thus require the examination of multiple activation pathways in order to determine caffeine‚Äôs specific effect on the nervous system and consequently memory. =Caffeine withdrawal's physiological effects= Even though there is no direct evidence that caffeine withdrawal impacts memory, there are many other connections made that provide some insight into what memory effects are possible. For example, there is evidence to show that attention decreases when experiencing caffeine withdrawal. A study had school-age children, who were regular caffeine users, go 24 hours without caffeine consumption, and the results showed a decrease in performance on reaction time of a task that required attention. Studies have also shown that regular caffeine users experience headaches and fatigue during withdrawal. One study had a group of regular caffeine users divided into three groups. Each group was designated an amount of time to avoid caffeinated products, for either 1.5 hours, 13 hours, or 7 days. The study found that, to varying degrees, all participants experienced an increase in fatigue, drowsiness, and headaches. A third study also found that among a group of participants receiving a placebo, anxiety was experienced by participants who had prior caffeine use. This would imply that participants would also experience a deficit in memory capabilities because attention and alertness positively impact the amount of information that can be stored in both short- and long-term memory, and anxiety would be a detriment to memory retention. =Duration of caffeine avoidance= There is also existing evidence that reflects on the duration of the caffeine avoidance period in relation to the significance of the withdrawal symptoms. In the study previously mentioned, the strongest withdrawal effects were seen among participants who underwent a 13-hour avoidance period, followed by the 7-day avoidance group. This would imply that memory effects would be at their strongest around the 13-hour mark and would continue to be affected for the following days. Memory would not be affected, however, within the first few hours. This appears valid considering most daily caffeine users need to consume caffeine shortly after awaking from sleep. For example, coffee drinkers were given either caffeine or a placebo after overnight caffeine abstinence. The study showed that regular coffee drinkers became less alert and more anxious than non-coffee drinkers when receiving the placebo. To coincide with this finding, another study in 2001 found a dose-related improvement in cognitive performance for daily caffeine users. This means that coffee drinkers experience the same positive effects every day they consume coffee. References Memory Caffeine ","title":"Effect of caffeine on memory"},{"id":"21312297","text":"Memory consolidation is a category of processes that stabilize a memory trace after its initial acquisition. A memory trace is a change in the nervous system caused by memorizing something. Consolidation is distinguished into two specific processes. The first, synaptic consolidation, which is synonymous with late-phase long-term potentiation, occurs on a small scale in the synaptic connections and neural circuits within the first few hours after learning. The second process is systems consolidation, where hippocampus- dependent memories become independent of the hippocampus over a period of weeks to years, and it occurs on a much larger scale in the brain. Recently, a third process has become the focus of research, reconsolidation, in which previously consolidated memories can be made labile again through reactivation of the memory trace. The line processes to make information memory  History  Memory consolidation was first referred to in the writings of the renowned Roman teacher of rhetoric Quintillian. He noted the \\"curious fact... that the interval of a single night will greatly increase the strength of the memory,\\" and presented the possibility that \\"... the power of recollection .. undergoes a process of ripening and maturing during the time which intervenes.\\" The process of consolidation was later proposed based on clinical data illustrated in 1882 by Ribot's Law of Regression, \\"progressive destruction advances progressively from the unstable to the stable\\". This idea was elaborated on by William H. Burnham a few years later in a paper on amnesia integrating findings from experimental psychology and neurology. Coining of the term \\"consolidation\\" is credited to the German researchers M√ºller and Alfons Pilzecker who rediscovered the concept that memory takes time to fixate or undergo \\"Konsolidierung\\" in their studies conducted between 1892 and 1900. The two proposed the perseveration-consolidation hypothesis after they found that new information learned could disrupt information previously learnt if not enough time had passed to allow the old information to be consolidated. This led to the suggestion that new memories are fragile in nature but as time passes they become solidified. 309x309pxSystematic studies of anterograde amnesia started to emerge in the 1960s and 1970s. The case of Henry Molaison, formerly known as patient H.M., became a landmark in studies of memory as it relates to amnesia and the removal of the hippocampal zone and sparked massive interest in the study of brain lesions and their effect on memory. After Molaison underwent a bilateral medial temporal lobe resection to alleviate epileptic symptoms the patient began to suffer from memory impairments. Molaison lost the ability to encode and consolidate newly learned information leading researchers to conclude the medial temporal lobe (MTL) was an important structure involved in this process. Molaison also showed signs of retrograde amnesia spanning a period of about 3 years prior to the surgery suggesting that recently acquired memories of as long as a couple years could remain in the MTL prior to consolidation into other brain areas. Research into other patients with resections of the MTL have shown a positive relationship between the degree of memory impairment and the extent of MTL removal which points to a temporal gradient in the consolidating nature of the MTL. These studies were accompanied by the creation of animal models of human amnesia in an effort to identify brain substrates critical for slow consolidation. Meanwhile, neuropharmacological studies of selected brain areas began to shed light on the molecules possibly responsible for fast consolidation. In recent decades, advancements in cellular preparations, molecular biology, and neurogenetics have revolutionized the study of consolidation. Providing additional support is the study of functional brain activity in humans which has revealed that the activity of brain regions changes over time after a new memory is acquired. This change can occur as quickly as a couple hours after the memory has been encoded suggesting that there is a temporal dimension to the reorganization of the memory as it is represented in the brain.  Synaptic consolidation  Synaptic consolidation, or late-phase LTP, is one form of memory consolidation seen across all species and long-term memory tasks. Long-term memory, when discussed in the context of synaptic consolidation, is memory that lasts for at least 24 hours. An exception to this 24-hour rule is long-term potentiation, or LTP, a model of synaptic plasticity related to learning, in which an hour is thought to be sufficient. Synaptic consolidation is achieved faster than systems consolidation, within only minutes to hours of learning in goldfish. LTP, one of the best understood forms of synaptic plasticity, is thought to be a possible underlying process in synaptic consolidation. = Standard model = The standard model of synaptic consolidation suggests that alterations of synaptic protein synthesis and changes in membrane potential are achieved through activating intracellular transduction cascades. These molecular cascades trigger transcription factors that lead to changes in gene expression. The result of the gene expression is the lasting alteration of synaptic proteins, as well as synaptic remodeling and growth. In a short time-frame immediately following learning, the molecular cascade, expression and process of both transcription factors and immediate early genes, are susceptible to disruptions. Disruptions caused by specific drugs, antibodies and gross physical trauma can block the effects of synaptic consolidation. = Long-term potentiation = LTP can be thought of as the prolonged strengthening of synaptic transmission, and is known to produce increases in the neurotransmitter production and receptor sensitivity, lasting minutes to even days. The process of LTP is regarded as a contributing factor to synaptic plasticity and in the growth of synaptic strength, which are suggested to underlie memory formation. LTP is also considered to be an important mechanism in terms of maintaining memories within brain regions, and therefore is thought to be involved in learning. There is compelling evidence that LTP is critical for Pavlovian fear conditioning in rats suggesting that it mediates learning and memory in mammals. Specifically, NMDA-receptor antagonists appear to block the induction of both LTP and fear conditioning and that fear conditioning increases amygdaloidal synaptic transmission that would result in LTP. = Timeline of consolidation = Synaptic consolidation, when compared to systems consolidation (which is said to take weeks to months to years to be accomplished), is considerably faster. There is evidence to suggest that synaptic consolidation takes place within minutes to hours of memory encoding or learning, and as such is considered the 'fast' type of consolidation. As soon as six hours after training, memories become impervious to interferences that disrupt synaptic consolidation and the formation of long-term memory. = Spacing effect = See also: Spacing effect Distributed learning has been found to enhance memory consolidation, specifically for relational memory. Experimental results suggest that distributing learning over the course of 24 hours decreases the rate of forgetting compared to massed learning, and enhances relational memory consolidation. When interpreted in the context of synaptic consolidation, mechanisms of synaptic strengthening may depend on the spacing of memory reactivation to allow sufficient time for protein synthesis to occur, and thereby strengthen long-term memory. One study that demonstrates this effect was conducted in 1984 by Smith and Rothkopf.Smith, S. M., & Rothkopf, E. Z. (1984). Contextual enrichment and distribution of practice in the classroom. Cognition and Instruction, 1(3), 341-358. In this experiment, subjects were sorted into three groups to test retention and learning. \\"Each group was taught the same 8 hour statistics class, but one group was taught the class in one day, the next over the course of four days in one room, and the last was taught the class over the course of four days in different rooms. The subjects were tested five days later in a completely new setting. The results of the experiment were that taking the class over a period of four days was much more effective than taking it in one single mass. Interestingly, the group that took the course over four days and in different rooms performed the best in the final retention test out of all the groups.\\"Smith, S. M., & Rothkopf, E. Z. (1984). Contextual enrichment and distribution of practice in the classroom. Cognition and Instruction, 1(3), 341-358. This shows that spacing out study sessions and studying in different environments helps with retention as it provides time for the brain to consolidate the information without being interrupted by new information. The benefits of spacing were also demonstrated in an earlier study by Reder and Anderson (1982) which yielded similar results, confirming the spacing effect‚Äôs relevance and effects on learning.Reder, L. M., & Anderson, J. R. (1982). Effects of spacing and embellishment on memory for the main points of a text. Memory & Cognition, 10(2), 97-102 Goldstein, E. Bruce, 1941- (2015). Cognitive psychology : connecting mind, research and everyday experience (4th edition ed.). New york: Cengage learning. = Protein synthesis = Protein synthesis plays an important role in the formation of new memories. Studies have shown that protein synthesis inhibitors administered after learning, weaken memory, suggesting that protein synthesis is required for memory consolidation. Additionally, reports have suggested that the effects of protein synthesis inhibitors also inhibit LTP. However, other results have shown that protein synthesis may not in fact be necessary for memory consolidation, as it has been found that the formation of memories can withstand vast amounts of protein synthesis inhibition, suggesting that this criterion of protein synthesis as necessary for memory consolidation is not unconditional.  Systems consolidation  Systems consolidation is the second form of memory consolidation. It is a reorganization process in which memories from the hippocampal region, where memories are first encoded, are moved to the neo-cortex in a more permanent form of storage.Roediger, H. L., Dudai, Y., & Fitzpatrick, S. M. (2007). Science of memory: concepts. New York, NY: Oxford University Press. Systems consolidation is a slow dynamic process that can take anywhere from one to two decades to be fully formed in humans, unlike synaptic consolidation that only takes minutes to hours for new information to stabilize into memories. = Standard model = The standard model of systems consolidation has been summarized by Squire and Alvarez (1995); it states that when novel information is originally encoded and registered, memory of these new stimuli becomes retained in both the hippocampus and cortical regions. Later the hippocampus' representations of this information become active in explicit (conscious) recall or implicit (unconscious) recall like in sleep and 'offline' processes. Memory is retained in the hippocampus for up to one week after initial learning, representing the hippocampus-dependent stage. During this stage the hippocampus is 'teaching' the cortex more and more about the information and when the information is recalled it strengthens the cortico-cortical connection thus making the memory hippocampus-independent. Therefore, from one week and beyond the initial training experience, the memory is slowly transferred to the neo-cortex where it becomes permanently stored. In this view the hippocampus can perform the task of storing memories temporarily because the synapses are able to change quickly whereas the neocortical synapses change over time. Consolidation is thus the process whereby the hippocampus activates the neocortex continually leading to strong connections between the two. Since the hippocampus can only support memories temporarily the remaining activation will be seen only in the neocortex which is able to support memory indefinitely. Squire and Alvarez took the temporally graded nature of patients with retrograde amnesia as support for the notion that once a connection has been established within the neocortex the hippocampus is no longer required, but this process is dynamic and extends for several years. Squire and Alvarez also proposed the idea that MTL structures play a role in the consolidation of memories within the neocortex by providing a binding area for multiple cortical regions involved in the initial encoding of the memory. In this sense the MTL would act as a relay station for the various perceptual input that make up a memory and stores it as a whole event. After this has occurred the MTL directs information towards the neocortex to provide a permanent representation of the memory. =Multiple trace theory= Multiple trace theory (MTT) builds on the distinction between semantic memory and episodic memory and addresses perceived shortcomings of the standard model with respect to the dependency of the hippocampus. MTT argues that the hippocampus is always involved in the retrieval and storage of episodic memories. It is thought that semantic memories, including basic information encoded during the storage of episodic memories, can be established in structures apart from the hippocampal system such as the neo-cortex in the process of consolidation. Hence, while proper hippocampal functioning is necessary for the retention and retrieval of episodic memories, it is less necessary during the encoding and use of semantic memories. As memories age there are long-term interactions between the hippocampus and neo-cortex and this leads to the establishment of aspects of memory within structures aside from the hippocampus. MTT thus states that both episodic and semantic memories rely on the hippocampus and the latter becomes somewhat independent of the hippocampus during consolidation. An important distinction between MTT and the standard model is that the standard model proposes that all memories become independent of the hippocampus after several years. However, Nadel and Moscovitch have shown that the hippocampus was involved in memory recall for all remote autobiographical memories no matter of their age. An important point they make while interpreting the results is that activation in the hippocampus was equally as strong regardless of the fact that the memories recalled were as old as 45 years prior to the date of the experiment. This is complicated by the fact that the hippocampus is constantly involved in the encoding of new events and activation due to this fact is hard to separate using baseline measures. Because of this, activation of the hippocampus during retrieval of distant memories may simply be a by-product of the subject encoding the study as an event. Criticisms Haist, Gore, and Mao, sought to examine the temporal nature of consolidation within the hippocampus to test MTT against the standard view. They found that the hippocampus does not substantially contribute to the recollection of remote memories after a period of a few years. They claim that advances in the functional magnetic resonance imaging have allowed them to improve their distinction between the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex which they claim is more enduring in its activation from remote memory retrieval. They also criticize the use of memories during testing which cannot be confirmed as accurate. Finally, they state that the initial interview in the scanner acted as an encoding event as such differences between recent and remote memories would be obscured. = Semantic vs. episodic memory = Nadel and Moscovitch argued that when studying the structures and systems involved in memory consolidation, semantic memory and episodic memory need to be distinguished as relying on two different memory systems. When episodic information is encoded there are semantic aspects of the memory that are encoded as well and this is proposed as an explanation of the varying gradients of memory loss seen in amnesic patients. Amnesic patients with hippocampal damage show traces of memories and this has been used as support for the standard model because it suggests that memories are retained apart from the hippocampal system. Nadel and Moscovitch argue that these retained memories have lost the richness of experience and exist as depersonalized events that have been semanticized over time. They suggest that this instead provides support for their notion that episodic memories rely significantly on the hippocampal system but semantic memories can be established elsewhere in the brain and survive hippocampal damage. = Declarative vs. procedural knowledge consolidation= Learning can be distinguished by two forms of knowledge: declarative and procedural. Declarative information includes the conscious recall of facts, episodes, and lists, and its storage typically connected with the mediotemporal lobe and the hippocampal systems as it includes the encoding of both semantic and episodic information of events. Procedural knowledge however has been said to function separate from this system as it relies primarily on motor areas of the brain. The implicit nature of procedural knowledge allows it to exist absent from the conscious awareness that the information is there. Amnesic patients have shown retained ability to be trained on tasks and exhibit learning without the subject being aware that the training had ever taken place. This introduces a dissociation between the two forms of memory and the fact that one form can exist absent the other suggests separate mechanisms are involved in consolidation. Squire has proposed the procedural knowledge is consolidated in some cases by the extrapyramidal motor system. Squire demonstrated that intact learning of certain motor, perceptual, and cognitive skills can be retained in patients with amnesia. They also retain the ability to be influenced by priming effects without the patients being able to consciously recall any training session occurring. =Emotional and stressful memory consolidation= The amygdala, specifically the basolateral region (BLA) is involved in the encoding of significant experiences and has been directly linked to memorable events. Extensive evidence suggests that stress hormones such as epinephrine play a critical role in consolidating new memories and this is why stressful memories are recalled vividly. Studies by Gold and van Buskirk provided initial evidence for this relationship when they showed that injections of epinephrine into subjects following a training period resulted in greater long-term retention of task related memories. This study also provided evidence that the level of epinephrine injected was related to the level of retention suggesting that the level of stress or emotionality of the memory plays a role on the level of retention. It is suggested that epinephrine affects memory consolidation by activating the amygdala and studies have shown that antagonism of beta-andrenoreceptors prior to injection of epinephrine will block the retention of memory effects seen previously. This is supported by the fact that beta-adrenoreceptor agonists have the opposite effect on the enhancement of memory consolidation. The BLA is thought to be actively involved in memory consolidation and is influenced strongly by stress hormones resulting in increased activation and as such increased memory retention. The BLA then projects to the hippocampus resulting in a strengthened memory. This relationship was studied by Packard and Chen who found that when glutamate was administered to the hippocampus, enhanced consolidation was seen during food- rewarded maze tasks. The opposite effect was also seen when the amygdala was inactivated using lidocaine. Studies appear to suggest that the amygdala effects the consolidation of memories through its influence with stress hormones and the projections to other brain areas implicated in memory consolidation. = Sleep consolidation = Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep has been thought of to be an important concept in the overnight learning in humans by establishing information in the hippocampal and cortical regions of the brain. REM sleep elicits an increase in neuronal activity following an enriched or novel waking experience, thus increasing neuronal plasticity and therefore playing an essential role in the consolidation of memories. This has come into question in recent years however and studies on sleep deprivation have shown that animals and humans who are denied REM sleep do not show deficits in task learning. It has been proposed that since the brain is in a non-memory encoding state during sleep, consolidation would be unlikely to occur. More recent studies, however, have looked at the relationship between slow-wave sleep and memory consolidation, rather than REM sleep. One study found that low levels of acetylcholine found in the central nervous system, which are present during slow-wave sleep, aid in the consolidation of memories and therefore assist in the learning process. Recent studies have examined the relationship between REM sleep and procedural learning consolidation. In particular studies have been done on sensory and motor related tasks. In one study testing finger-tapping, people were split into two groups and tested post-training with or without intervening sleep; results concluded that sleep post-training increases both speed and accuracy in this particular task, while increasing the activation of both cortical and hippocampal regions; whereas the post-training awake group had no such improvements. It has been theorized that this may be related more-so to a process of synaptic consolidation rather than systems consolidation because of the short-term nature of the process involved. Researchers examining the effect of sleep on motor learning have noted that while consolidation occurs over a period of 4‚Äì6 hours during sleep, this is also true during waking hours, which may negate any role of sleep in learning. In this sense sleep would serve no special purpose to enhance consolidation of memories because it occurs independently of sleep. Other studies have examined the process of replay which has been described as a reactivation of patterns that were stimulated during a learning phase. Replay has been demonstrated in the hippocampus and this has lent support to the notion that it serves a consolidation purpose. However, replay is not specific to sleep and both rats and primates show signs during restful-awake periods. Also, replay may simply be residual activation in areas that were involved previously in the learning phase and may have no actual effect on consolidation. This reactivation of the memory traces has also been seen in non-REM sleep specifically for hippocampus-dependant memories. Researchers have noted strong reactivation of the hippocampus during sleep immediately after a learning task. This reactivation led to enhanced performance on the learned task. One such experiment had participants learn word pair associations (declarative memories) before either retention periods of sleep or periods of wakefulness. Researchers found that retrieval expectancy played a role as to whether participants were able to retain the information, as the participants that had been told about the delayed retrieval test performed better. However, their research showed that sleep was more likely to benefit the consolidation of memories if the information was relevant to future events or behaviors. Researchers following this line of work have come to assume that dreams are a by-product of the reactivation of the brain areas and this can explain why dreams may be unrelated to the information being consolidated. The dream experience itself is not what enhances memory performance but rather it is the reactivation of the neural circuits that causes this. Other researchers have looked at the role growth hormones play in the consolidation of memories, particularly those of procedural and declarative memories. They found that although growth hormones support general brain systems and memory functioning, it is still unclear if growth hormones play a role in the formation and processing of particular memories during sleep periods.  Zif268 & REM sleep  Zif268 is an Immediate early gene (IEG) thought to be involved in neuroplasticity by an up-regulation of the transcription factor during REM sleep after pre-exposure to an enriched environment. Results from studies testing the effects of zif268 on mice brains postmortem, suggest that a waking experience prior to sleep can have an enduring effect in the brain, due to an increase of neuroplasticity.  Reconsolidation  Memory reconsolidation is the process of previously consolidated memories being recalled and actively consolidated. It is a distinct process that serves to maintain, strengthen and modify memories that are already stored in the long-term memory. Once memories undergo the process of consolidation and become part of long-term memory, they are thought of as stable. However, the retrieval of a memory trace can cause another labile phase that then requires an active process to make the memory stable after retrieval is complete. It is believed that post-retrieval stabilization is different and distinct from consolidation, despite its overlap in function (e.g. storage) and its mechanisms (e.g. protein synthesis). Memory modification needs to be demonstrated in the retrieval in order for this independent process to be valid. = History = The theory of reconsolidation has been debated for many years and is still controversial. Reconsolidation was first conceptualized in light of the discovery that phobias could often be eliminated by means of electroconvulsive shock therapy (ECT). This seemed to indicate the involvement of a re-consolidation process for excited memories, and that the operation active in ECT was the disruption of that process; here, of the reconsolidation of retrieved fear memories by shock administration. Further studies investigated the concept, using ECT to test for reconsolidation; ECT was already known as an amnesic agent (leads to memory loss). These studies found it to be effective on retrieved memories when administered directly after the retrieval of a memory. Later research, wherein fear memories had been established in rats through Pavlovian fear conditioning, found that a consolidated fear memory can be brought to a labile state, by means of immediate amygdala infusions of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin, but not by infusions made six hours afterwards. It was concluded that consolidated fear memory, when reactivated, enters a changeable state that requires de novo protein synthesis for new consolidation, i.e., re- consolidation of the old memory. Nader, Schafe, and Le Doux (2000) demonstrated that the reconsolidation process may make memories more malleable than previously believed.Nader, K., Schafe, G. & LeDoux, J. The labile nature of consolidation theory. Nat Rev Neurosci 1, 216‚Äì219 (2000). https://doi.org/10.1038/35044580Goldstein, E. Bruce, 1941- (2015). Cognitive psychology : connecting mind, research and everyday experience (4th edition ed.). New york: Cengage learning. Nader and his colleagues trained rats to be afraid of a tone by pairing the tone with a small shock. Groups of rats were then injected with anisomycin, an antibiotic that restricts protein synthesis, at different points in time. The rats that were injected with anisomycin after consolidation had taken place, retained the fear reaction to the tone. However, the rats that were injected before consolidation and reconsolidation could take place, did not retain the fear response when they heard the tone again later. It seems that interference that is made before memories are consolidated affect the way they are remembered later. Brunet and colleagues (2008) studied patients that had been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Brunet, A., Orr, S. P., Tremblay, J., Robertson, K., Nader, K., & Pitman, R. K. (2008). Effect of post-retrieval propranolol on psychophysiologic responding during subsequent script-driven traumatic imagery in post-traumatic stress disorder. Journal of psychiatric research, 42(6), 503-506. Following the same method that Nader and his associates used, Brunet induced anxiety responses in the patients by having them listen to a 30 second recording describing the circumstances of their traumatic experiences. The patients were shortly thereafter injected with propranolol, a drug that blocks stress hormone receptors in the amygdala which is implicated in neurologically representing the emotional content of memories. These patients experienced a significant reduction in PTSD symptoms months after treatment. These findings were confirmed in later studies done in 2009 by Kindt and colleagues and in 2010 by Schiller and colleagues . Kindt, M., Soeter, M., & Vervliet, B. (2009). Beyond extinction: erasing human fear responses and preventing the return of fear. Nature neuroscience, 12(3), 256.Schiller, D., Monfils, M. H., Raio, C. M., Johnson, D. C., LeDoux, J. E., & Phelps, E. A. (2010). Preventing the return of fear in humans using reconsolidation update mechanisms. Nature, 463(7277), 49-53. These studies done by Nader and others seem to suggest that as memories are being remembered, they are fragile, as if experiencing them for the first time. In addition to fear memories, appetitive memories are also prone to reconsolidation episodes, which can likewise be disrupted; namely, after local administration of a protein activity inhibitor. Since those breakthrough studies were done, there have been several others to probe the theory of memory reconsolidation. Subjects in these studies, along with humans, have included crabs, chicks, honeybees, medaka fish, lymnaea, and various rodents. Further studies have demonstrated an analogue of memory reconsolidation in spinal cord pain processing pathways, suggesting a general role for reconsolidation in the central nervous system. = Criticisms = Some studies have supported this theory, while others have failed to demonstrate disruption of consolidated memory after retrieval. It is important to note that negative results may be examples of conditions where memories are not susceptible to a permanent disruption, thus a determining factor of reconsolidation. After much debate and a detailed review of this field it had been concluded that reconsolidation was a real phenomenon. Tronson and Taylor compiled a lengthy summary of multiple reconsolidation studies, noting a number of studies were unable to show memory impairments due to blocked reconsolidation. However the need for standardized methods was underscored as in some learning tasks such as fear conditioning, certain forms of memory reactivation could actually represent new extinction learning rather than activation of an old memory trace. Under this possibility, traditional disruptions of reconsolidation might actually maintain the original memory trace but preventing the consolidation of extinction learning. Recent work has suggested that epigenetic modifications may also prevent reconsolidation in some cases. The removal of these epigenetic modifications with inhibitors of histone deacetylase enabled the erasure of remote memories after recall. Reconsolidation experiments are more difficult to run than typical consolidation experiments as disruption of a previously consolidated memory must be shown to be specific to the reactivation of the original memory trace. Furthermore, it is important to demonstrate that the vulnerability of reactivation occurs in a limited time frame, which can be assessed by delaying infusion till six hours after reactivation. It is also useful to show that the behavioral measure used to assess disruption of memory is not just due to task impairment caused by the procedure, which can be demonstrated by testing control groups in absence of the original learning. Finally, it is important to rule out alternative explanations, such as extinction learning by lengthening the reactivation phase. There have also been concerns about the use of reconsolidation research to justify psychotherapy treatments, and the generalizability of basic reconsolidation research into the therapy roomPatihis, L. (2015). Let's be skeptical about reconsolidation and emotional arousal in therapy. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 38. = Distinctions from consolidation = Questions arose if reconsolidation was a unique process or merely another phase of consolidation. Both consolidation and reconsolidation can be disrupted by pharmacological agents (e.g. the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin) and both require the transcription factor CREB. However, recent amygdala research suggests that BDNF is required for consolidation (but not reconsolidation) whereas the transcription factor and immediate early gene Zif268 is required for reconsolidation but not consolidation. A similar double dissociation between Zif268 for reconsolidation and BDNF for consolidation was found in the hippocampus for fear conditioning. However, not all memory tasks show this double dissociation, such as object recognition memory. = Reconsolidation in psychotherapy = In the decade between 2005 and 2015, at least five groups argued the notion that memory reconsolidation can be used to treat psychological problems. Three of these groups have proposed that the wide variety of different psychotherapies produce permanent change in clients to the extent that they manage to activate this same neurobiological mechanism of reconsolidation in a way that leads to deconsolidation. But for a more hesitant view of the role of memory reconsolidation in psychotherapy that criticizes some of the claims of Ecker et al., see: Memory reconsolidation may be a common factor in many forms of psychotherapy.

L., Conway, M. A., & Cohen, G. (2008). Autobiographical memory. In G. Cohen & M. A. Conway (Eds.), Memory in the Real World (3rd ed., pp. 21-90). Hove, UK: Psychology Press. It is thus a type of explicit memory. Formation Conway and Pleydell-Pearce (2000) proposed that autobiographical memory is constructed within a self-memory system (SMS), a conceptual model composed of an autobiographical knowledge base and the working self. =Autobiographical knowledge base= The autobiographical knowledge base contains knowledge of the self, used to provide information on what the self is, what the self was, and what the self can be. This information is categorized into three broad areas: lifetime periods, general events, and event-specific knowledge. Lifetime periods are composed of general knowledge about a distinguishable and themed time in an individual's life. For example, the period spent at school (school theme), or entering the workforce (work theme). Lifetime periods have a distinct beginning and ending, but they are often fuzzy and overlap. Lifetime periods contain thematic knowledge about the features of that period, such as the activities, relationships, and locations involved, as well as temporal knowledge about the duration of the period. The thematic information in these periods can be used to group them together under broader themes, which can reflect personal attitudes or goals. As an example, a lifetime period with the theme of \\"when I lost my job\\" could fall under the broader category of either \\"when everything went downhill for me\\" or \\"minor setbacks in my life.\\" General events are more specific than lifetime periods and encompass single representations of repeated events or a sequence of related events. General events group into clusters with a common theme, so that when one memory of a general event is recalled, it cues the recall of other related events in memory. These clusters of memories often form around the theme of either achieving or failing to achieve personal goals. Clusters of general events that fall under the category of \\"first-time\\" achievements or occasions seem to have a particular vividness, such as the first time kissing a romantic partner, or the first time going to a ball game.Robinson, J. A. (1992). First experience memories: Contexts and function in personal histories. In M. A. Conway, D. C. Rubin, H. Spinnler, & W. A. Wager (Eds.), Theoretical perspectives on autobiographical memory (pp. 223-239). Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers. These memories of goal-attainment pass on important information about the self, such as how easily a skill can be acquired, or an individual's success and failure rates for certain tasks. Event-specific knowledge (ESK) is vividly detailed information about individual events, often in the form of visual images and sensory-perceptual features. The high levels of detail in ESK fade very quickly, though certain memories for specific events tend to endure longer. Originating events (events that mark the beginning of a path towards long-term goals), turning points (events that re-direct plans from original goals), anchoring events (events that affirm an individuals beliefs and goals) and analogous events (past events that direct behaviour in the present) are all event specific memories that will resist memory decay. The sensory-perceptual details held in ESK, though short-lived, are a key component in distinguishing memory for experienced events from imagined events. In the majority of cases, it is found that the more ESK a memory contains, the more likely the recalled event has actually been experienced. Unlike lifetime periods and general events, ESK are not organized in their grouping or recall. Instead, they tend to simply 'pop' into the mind. ESK is also thought to be a summary of the content of episodic memories, which are contained in a separate memory system from the autobiographical knowledge base. This way of thinking could explain the rapid loss of event-specific detail, as the links between episodic memory and the autobiographical knowledge base are likewise quickly lost. Hierarchical structure of the autobiographical knowledge base These three areas are organized in a hierarchy within the autobiographical knowledge base and together make up the overall life story of an individual. Knowledge stored in lifetime periods contain cues for general events, and knowledge at the level of general events calls upon event-specific knowledge. When a cue evenly activates the autobiographical knowledge base hierarchy, all levels of knowledge become available and an autobiographical memory is formed. When the pattern of activation encompasses episodic memory, then autonoetic consciousness may result. Autonoetic consciousness or recollective experience is the sense of \\"mental time travel\\" that is experienced when recalling autobiographical memories. These recollections consist of a sense of self in the past and some imagery and sensory-perceptual details. Autonoetic consciousness reflects the integration of parts of the autobiographical knowledge base and the working self. =Working self= The working self, often referred to as just the 'self', is a set of active personal goals or self-images organized into goal hierarchies. These personal goals and self- images work together to modify cognition and the resulting behavior so an individual can operate effectively in the world. The working self is similar to working memory: it acts as a central control process, controlling access to the autobiographical knowledge base. The working self manipulates the cues used to activate the knowledge structure of the autobiographical knowledge base and in this way can control both the encoding and recalling of specific autobiographical memories. The relationship between the working self and the autobiographical knowledge base is reciprocal. While the working self can control the accessibility of autobiographical knowledge, the autobiographical knowledge base constrains the goals and self-images of the working self within who the individual actually is and what they can do. Types There are four main categories for the types of autobiographical memories: #Biographical or Personal: These autobiographical memories often contain biographical information, such as where one was born or the names of one's parents. #Copies vs. Reconstructions: Copies are vivid autobiographical memories of an experience with a considerable amount of visual and sensory-perceptual detail. Such autobiographical memories have different levels of authenticity. Reconstructions are autobiographical memories that are not reflections of raw experiences, but are rebuilt to incorporate new information or interpretations made in hind-sight. #Specific vs. Generic: Specific autobiographical memories contain a detailed memory of a certain event (event-specific knowledge); generic autobiographical memories are vague and hold little detail other than the type of event that occurred. Repisodic autobiographical memories can also be categorized into generic memories, where one memory of an event is representative of a series of similar events. #Field vs. Observer: Autobiographical memories can be experienced from different perspectives. Field memories are memories recollected in the original perspective, from a first-person point of view. Observer memories are memories recollected from a perspective outside ourselves, a third-person point of view. Typically, older memories are recollected through an observer perspective, and observer memories are more often reconstructions while field memories are more vivid like copies. Autobiographical memories can also be differentiated into Remember vs. Know categories. The source of a remembered memory is attributed to personal experience. The source of a known memory is attributed to an external source, not personal memory. This can often lead to source-monitoring error, wherein a person may believe that a memory is theirs when the information actually came from an external source. Functions Autobiographical memory serves three broad functions: directive, social, and self-representative. A fourth function, adaptive, was proposed by Williams, Conway and Cohen (2008). The directive function of autobiographical memory uses past experiences as a reference for solving current problems and a guide for our actions in the present and the future. Memories of personal experiences and the rewards and losses associated with them can be used to create successful models, or schemas, of behavior. which can be applied over many scenarios. In instances where a problem cannot be solved by a generic schema, a more specific memory of an event can be accessed in autobiographical memory to give some idea of how to confront the new challenge. The social function of autobiographical memory develops and maintains social bonds by providing material for people to converse about. Sharing personal memories with others is a way to facilitate social interaction. Disclosing personal experiences can increase the intimacy level between people and reminiscing of shared past events strengthens pre-existing bonds. The importance of this function can easily be seen in individuals with impaired episodic or autobiographical memory, where their social relationships suffer greatly as a result. Autobiographical memory performs a self-representative function by using personal memories to create and maintain a coherent self-identity over time. This self-continuity is the most commonly referred to self- representative function of autobiographical memory. A stable self-identity allows for evaluation of past experiences, known as life reflection, which leads to self-insight and often self-growth. Finally, autobiographical memory serves an adaptive function. Recalling positive personal experiences can be used to maintain desirable moods or alter undesirable moods. This internal regulation of mood through autobiographical memory recall can be used to cope with negative situations and impart an emotional resilience. The effects of mood on memory are explained in better detail under the Emotion section.  Memory Disorder  There are many sorts of amnesia, and by studying their different forms, it has become possible to observe apparent defects in individual subsystems of the brain's memory systems, and thus hypothesize their function in the normally working brain. Other neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease can also affect memory and cognition. Hyperthymesia, or hyperthymestic syndrome, is a disorder that affects an individual's autobiographical memory, essentially meaning that they cannot forget small details that otherwise would not be stored. Memory perspectives People often re-experience visual images when remembering events. One aspect of these images is their perspective. Basically, there are two types of perspective: * The field perspective is the type of autobiographical memory recalled from the field of perspective that occurred when the memory was encoded. That is, the remembering person doesn't \\"see\\" themselves, they see the situation just as they saw it when it happened, through their own eyes. The field of view in such memories corresponds to that of the original situation. *The observer perspective is an autobiographical memory recalled from an observer position, i.e. viewing the action as an outsider. In other words, the remembering person \\"sees\\" the whole situation, with themselves in it. The event is viewed from an external vantage point. There is a wide variation in the spatial locations of this external vantage point, with the location of these perspectives depending on the event being recalled. The field and observer perspectives have also been described as \\"pre-reflective\\" and \\"reflective,\\" respectively. Different brain regions are activated by the pre-reflective and reflective perspectives. =Moderators of perspective= Studies tested the prevalence of field and observer memories to determine which kind of memories occur at which times. Some of the moderators that change individuals' recalled perspectives are memory age, emotionality, and self-awareness. Additionally, emotion and affect are associated with the field perspective's brain region, while complex cognitive processing is associated with the observer perspective's brain region. The many factors that contribute to determining memory perspective are not affected by whether the recall of the memory was voluntary or involuntary. * Memory age is the amount of time that has passed since the event. Memory age appears to be one of the most important determinants of perspective type. Recent memories are often experienced in the field perspective; as memory age increases, there is also an increase in the number of observer memories. Perspective is most difficult to change in older memories, especially childhood memories. * Emotionality refers to the emotional state of the individual at the time that the memory is encoded. Events that were relatively low in emotional experience are often remembered from a field perspective. Events higher in emotion are more likely to be remembered from an observer perspective. When participants were asked to focus on feelings at retrieval of memories, they more often classified their memories as the field perspective. *Self-awareness refers to the reported amount of consciousness an individual had of themselves at the time of the event. A higher level of self-awareness is often associated with observer memories instead of field memories. =Cultural effects= Studies have shown that culture can affect the point of view autobiographical memory is recalled in. People living in Eastern cultures are more likely to recall memories through an observer point of view than those living in Western cultures. Also, in Eastern cultures, situation plays a larger role in determining the perspective of memory recall than in Western cultures. For example, Easterners are more likely than Westerners to use observer perspective when remembering events where they are at the center of attention (like giving a presentation, having a birthday party, etc.). There are many reasons for these differences in autobiographical perspectives across cultures. Each culture has its own unique set of factors that affect the way people perceive the world around them, such as uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, and power distance. While these various cultural factors contribute to shaping one's memory perspective, the biggest factor in shaping memory perspective is individualism. One's sense of self is important in influencing whether autobiographical memories are recalled in the observer or field point of view. Western society has been found to be more individualistic, with people being more independent and stressing less importance on familial ties or the approval of others. On the other hand, Eastern cultures are thought of as less individualistic, focusing more on acceptance and maintaining family relationships while focusing less on the individual self. The way people in different cultures perceive the emotions of the people around them also play a role in shaping the recall perspective of memories. Westerners are said to have a more \\"inside-out view\\" of the world, and unknowingly project their current emotions onto the world around them. This practice is called egocentric projection. For example, when a person is feeling guilty about something he did earlier, he will perceive the people around him as also feeling guilty. On the other hand, Easterners have a more \\"outside-in view\\" of the world, perceiving the people around them as having complementary emotions to their own. With an outside-in view, someone who was feeling guilt would imagine the people around them looking upon them with scorn or disgust. These different perceptions across cultures of how one is viewed by others lead to different amounts of field or observer recall. =Effects of gender= Women on average report more memories in the observer perspective than men. A theory for this phenomenon is that women are more conscious about their personal appearance than men. According to objectification theory, social and cultural expectations have created a society where women are far more objectified than men. In situations where one's physical appearance and actions are important (for example, giving a speech in front of an audience), the memory of that situation will likely be remembered in the observer perspective. This is due to the general trend that when the focus of attention in a person's memory is on themselves, they will likely see themselves from someone else's point of view. This is because, in \\"center-of-attention\\" memories, the person is conscious about the way they are presenting themselves and instinctively try to envision how others were perceiving them. Since women feel more objectified than men, they tend to be put in center-of-attention situations more often, which results in recalling more memories from the observer perspective. Studies also show that events with greater social interaction and significance produce more observer memories in women than events with low or no social interaction or significance. Observer perspective in men was generally unaffected by the type of event. =Effects of personal identity= Another theory of the visual perspective deals with the continuity or discontinuity of the self. Continuity is seen as a way to connect and strengthen the past self to the current self and discontinuity is distanced from the self. This theory breaks down the observer method (i.e. when an individual recalls memories as an observer) into two possibilities: the \\"dispassionate observer\\" and the \\"salient self\\". *In the dispassionate observer's view, the field perspective is used when an individual has continuity with the self (their present idea of their self matches the self they were in the past) whereas the observer perspective is used for discontinuity or inauthenticity of the self (when the remembered self is not the same as the present self). :People who picture their past self as different or conflicting with their current self often recall memories of their old self using the observer perspective. People who have undergone some kind of change often look upon their past self (before the change) as if they were a completely different person. These drastic personal changes include things like graduating, getting over an addiction, entering or leaving prison, getting diagnosed with cancer, losing weight, and any other major life events. There is a split between the present self that is remembering and the past self that is remembered. *In the salient self's view the observer has the opposite pattern: if an individual perceives continuity with the self (old self matches new self), they would approach this with an observer perspective, contrasted to having discontinuity or incongruence (old self does not match new self) that would be approached with the field perspective. Thus, the visual perspective employed for continuous and discontinuous memories is the opposite for each view. People who use observer perspective to remember their old self tend to believe that they are less likely to revert to their old self. When a person recalls memories from the observer perspective, it helps preserve their self-image and self-esteem. Remembering a traumatic or embarrassing event from an observer perspective helps detach that person from that negative event, as if they were not the one experiencing it, but rather someone else. Given the distancing nature of observer perspective, it also results in a worse sense of self-continuity. =Effects of trauma= Events high in emotional content, such as stressful situations (ex: fighting in the Vietnam War), are likely to be recalled using observer perspective, while memories low in emotional content (ex: driving to work) are likely to be recalled using field perspective. The main reason for this is probably that the observer perspective distances the person from the traumatic event, allowing them to recall the specifics and details of the event without having to relive the feelings and emotions. The observer perspective tends to focus more on one's physical appearance, along with the spatial relations and peripheral details of the scene, which allows people to remember the specifics and important facts of their traumatic experience, without reliving most of the pain. The field perspective, on the other hand, focuses on the physical and psychological feelings experienced at the time of the event. For many people, it can be too difficult to use this perspective to recall the event. Clinical psychologists have found that the observer perspective acts like a psychological \\"buffer\\" to decrease the stress an individual feels when recalling a difficult memory. This is especially seen in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). When patients with PTSD were asked to recall their traumatic experience, 89 percent of those who used observer perspective to recall the traumatic event said they did so because it was emotionally easier and spared them from reliving the horror of their traumatic event. Although this is a useful coping mechanism, some argue that effective treatment of PTSD requires the patient to re-experience the emotions and fear from that traumatic event so that it can be processed into something less distressing. Peter Lang and other researchers have hypothesized that the short-term relief the observer perspective provides may actually impede long- term recovery from PTSD. Methods of study=Diaries= Writing in a diary Memory can be inaccurate and critical details of a raw experience can be forgotten or re-imagined. The diary method of study circumvents these issues by having groups of participants keep a diary over a period of weeks or months, during which they record the details of everyday events that they judge to be memorable. In this way a record of true autobiographical memories can be collected. These true autobiographical memories can then be presented to the participants at a later date in a recognition test, often in comparison to falsified diary entries or 'foils'. The results from these studies can give us information about the level of detail retained in autobiographical memory over time, and if certain features of an event are more salient and memorable in autobiographical memory. A study performed by Barclay and Wellman (1986) included two types of foils in their recognition task: ones that were entirely false and ones that were the original diary entry with a few details altered. Against the false foils, participants were found to be highly accurate at recognizing their true entries (at an average rate of 95%) and false foils were only judged as true 25% of the time. However, when judging between true diary entries and the altered foils, the altered foils were incorrectly judged as true 50% of the time. Barclay and Wellman theorized this was due to the tendency to group similar or repeated autobiographical memories into generic memories or schemas, and thus diary entries that seemed familiar enough to fit into these schemas would be judged as true. =Memory probe= Originally devised by Galton (1879), the memory probe method uses a list of words as cues to bring to mind autobiographical memories, which the participant then tries to describe in as much detail as possible.Rubin, D. C. (Ed.). (1986) Autobiographical memory. New York: Cambridge University Press. The answers can then be analyzed in order to gain a better understanding as to how recall of autobiographical memory works, especially in cases dealing with brain damage or amnesia. Recent studies have used non-verbal cues for memory, such as visual images, music or odours. Chu and Downes (2002) found ample evidence that odour cues are particularly good at cueing autobiographical memories. Odour-cued memories for specific events were more detailed and more emotionally loaded than those for verbal, visual, or non-related odour cues. Emotion Happy emotions will strengthen a memory of an Olympic goal Emotion affects the way autobiographical memories are encoded and retrieved. Emotional memories are reactivated more, they are remembered better and have more attention devoted to them. Through remembering our past achievements and failures, autobiographical memories affect how we perceive and feel about ourselves. =Positive= Positive autobiographical memories contain more sensory and contextual details than negative and neutral memories. People high in self-esteem recall more details for memories where the individual displayed positive personality traits than memories dealing with negative personality traits. People with high self-esteem also devoted more resources to encoding these positive memories over negative memories. In addition, it was found that people high in self-esteem reactivate positive memories more often than people with low self-esteem, and reactivate memories about other people's negative personality traits more often to maintain their positive self-image. Positive memories appear to be more resistant to forgetting. All memories fade, and the emotions linked with them become less intense over time. However, this fading effect is seen less with positive memories than with negative memories, leading to a better remembrance of positive memories. As well, recall of autobiographical memories that are important in defining ourselves differs depending on the associated emotion. Past failures seem farther away than past achievements, regardless if the actual length of time is the same. =Negative= Negative memories generally fade faster than positive memories of similar emotional importance and encoding period. This difference in retention period and vividness for positive memories is known as the fading affect bias. In addition, coping mechanisms in the mind are activated in response to a negative event, which minimizes the stress and negative events experienced. While it seems adaptive to have negative memories fade faster, sometimes it may not be the case. Remembering negative events can prevent us from acting overconfident or repeating the same mistake, and we can learn from them in order to make better decisions in the future. However, increased remembering of negative memories can lead to the development of maladaptive conditions. The effect of mood-congruent memory, wherein the mood of an individual can influence the mood of the memories they recall, is a key factor in the development of depressive symptoms for conditions such as dysphoria or major depressive disorder. Dysphoria: Individuals with mild to moderate Dysphoria show an abnormal trend of the fading effect bias. The negative memories of dysphoric individuals did not fade as quickly relative to control groups, and positive memories faded slightly faster. In severely dysphoric individuals the fading affect bias was exacerbated; negative memories faded more slowly and positive memories faded more quickly than non-dysphoria individuals. Unfortunately, this effect is not well understood. One possible explanation suggests that, in relation to mood-congruent memory theory, the mood of the individual at the time of recall rather than the time of encoding has a stronger effect on the longevity of negative memories. If this is the case, further studies should hopefully show that changes in mood state will produce changes in the strength of the fading affect bias. Depression: Depression impacts the retrieval of autobiographical memories. Adolescents with depression tend to rate their memories as more accurate and vivid than never-depressed adolescents, and the content of recollection is different. Individuals with depression encounter trouble remembering specific personal past events, and instead recall more general events (repeated or recurring events). Specific memory recall can further be inhibited by significant psychological trauma occurring in comorbidity. When a specific episodic memory is recalled by an individual with depression, details for the event are almost non-existent and instead purely semantic knowledge is reported. The lack of remembered detail especially affects positive memories; generally people remember positive events with more detail than negative events, but the reverse is seen in those with depression. Negative memories will seem more complex and the time of occurrence will be more easily remembered than positive and neutral events. This may be explained by mood congruence theory, as depressed individuals remember negatively charged memories during frequent negative moods. Depressed adults also tend to actively rehearse negative memories, which increases their retention period and vividness. Another explanation may be the tendency for individuals suffering from depression to separate themselves from their positive memories and focus more on evidence that supports their current negative self-image to keep it intact. Depressed adults also recall positive memories from an observer perspective rather than a field perspective, where they appear as a spectator rather than a participant in their own memory. Finally, the autobiographical memory differences may be attributed to a smaller posterior hippocampal volume in any individuals going through cumulative stress. Effects of age=Temporal components= Memory changes with age; the temporal distribution of autobiographical memories across the lifespan, as modelled by Rubin, Wetzler, and Nebes (1986), is separated into three components: # Childhood or infantile amnesia # The retention function (recency effect) # The reminiscence bump Infantile amnesia concerns memories from very early childhood, before age 6; very few memories before age 3 are available. The retention function is the recollection of events in the first 20 to 30 most recent years of an individual's life. This results in more memories for events closest to the present, a recency effect. Finally, there is the reminiscence bump occurring after around age 40, marked by an increase in the retrieval of memories from ages 10 to 30. For adolescents and young adults the reminiscence bump and the recency effect coincide. =Age effects= Autobiographical memory demonstrates only minor age differences, but distinctions between semantic versus episodic memories in older adults compared with younger people have been found. Episodic to semantic shift Piolino, Desgranges, Benali, and Eustache (2002) investigated age effects on autobiographical memory using an autobiographical questionnaire that distinguished between the recall of semantic and episodic memory. They proposed a transition from episodic to semantic memory in autobiographical memory recollection with increased age. Using four groups of adults aged 40‚Äì79, Piolino and colleagues found evidence for a greater decline in episodic memories with longer retention intervals and a more substantial age-related decline in recall of episodic memory than semantic memory. They also found support for the three components of autobiographical memory, as modeled by David Rubin and colleagues. Semanticizing memories, generalizing episodic memories by removing the specific temporal and spatial contexts, makes memories more persistent than age-sensitive episodic memories. Recent memories (retention interval) are episodic. Older memories are semanticized, becoming more resilient (reminiscence bump). Semantic memories are less sensitive to age effects. Over time, autobiographical memories may consist more of general information than specific details of a particular event or time. In one study where participants recalled events from five life periods, older adults concentrated more on semantic details which were not tied to a distinct temporal or spatial context. Younger participants reported more episodic details such as activities, locations, perceptions, and thoughts. Even when probed for contextual details, older adults still reported more semantic details compared with younger adults. Voluntary versus involuntary memories Research on autobiographical memory has focused on voluntary memories, memories that are deliberately recalled; nevertheless, research has evidenced differential effects of age on involuntary and voluntary autobiographical memory. One study found that fewer involuntary and voluntary memories were reported by older adults compared with younger adults. The voluntary memories of older adults were not as specific and were not recalled as quickly as those of younger adults. There was no consistent distinction between involuntary memories for younger and older adults. Positivity effect Several studies have shown a positivity effect for autobiographical memories in older adults. One study found a positivity bias for involuntary memories, where younger adults did not rate their involuntary memories as positively as did older adults. Voluntary memories did not show this difference. Another study found a reminiscence bump for adults in their 20s for happy involuntary memories but not for unhappy involuntary memories. Happy involuntary memories were also more than twice as frequent as unhappy involuntary memories. In older participants, a bump for memories reported as most important and happy was found. The saddest and most traumatic memories showed a declining retention function. The positivity bias could reflect an emphasis on emotional-regulation goals in older adults. Accuracy Judging the veracity of autobiographical memories can be a source of difficulty. However, it is important to be able to verify the accurateness of autobiographical memories in order to study them. =Vividness= The vividness of the memory can increase one's belief in the veracity of the memory but not as strongly as spatial context. Some memories are extremely vivid. For the person recalling vivid memories of personal significance, these memories appear to be more accurate than everyday memories. These memories have been termed flashbulb memories. However, flashbulb memories may not be any more accurate than everyday memories when evaluated objectively. In one study, both flash bulb memories of 9/11 and everyday memories deteriorated over time; however, reported vividness, recollection and belief in accuracy of flashbulb memories remained high. =False memories= False memories often do not have as much visual imagery as true memories. In one study comparing the characteristics of true and false autobiographical memories, true memories were reported to be wealthier in \\"recollective experience\\" or providing many details of the originally encoded event, by participants and observers. The participants engaging in recall reported true memories as being more important, emotionally intense, less typical, and having clearer imagery. True memories were generally reported to have a field perspective versus an observer perspective. An observer perspective was more prominent in false memories. True memories provided more information, including details about the consequences following the recalled event. However, with repeated recollection, false memories may become more like true memories and acquire greater detail. False memory syndrome is a controversial condition in which people demonstrate conviction for vivid but false personal memories. False memories and confabulation, reporting events that did not occur, may reflect errors in source-monitoring. Confabulation can be a result of brain damage, but it can also be provoked by methods employed in memory exploration. Professionals such as therapists, police and lawyers must be aware of the malleability of memory and be wary of techniques that might promote false memory generation. Neuroanatomy=Neural networks= Diagram of the different lobes of the brain The autobiographical memory knowledge base is distributed through neural networks in the frontal, temporal and occipital lobes. The most abstract or conceptual knowledge is represented in frontal and anterior temporal networks, possibly bilaterally. Sensory and perceptual details of specific events are represented in posterior temporal and occipital networks, predominantly in the right cortex. A \\"core\\" neural network composed of the left medial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices, medial and lateral temporal cortices, temporoparietal junction, posterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum are consistently identified as activated regions in at least half of the current imaging studies on autobiographical memory. A \\"secondary\\" neural network composed of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, superior medial cortex, superior lateral cortex, anterior cingulate, medial orbitofrontal, temporopolar and occipital cortices, thalamus and amygdala can be identified as active regions in a quarter to a third of imaging studies on autobiographical memory. Regions of the brain that are reported infrequently, in less than a quarter of autobiographical memory imaging studies, include the frontal eye fields, motor cortex, medial and lateral parietal cortices, fusiform gyrus, superior and inferior lateral temporal cortices, insula, basal ganglia and brain stem. These widespread activation patterns suggest that a number of varying domain-specific processes unique to re-experiencing phenomena, such as emotional and perceptual processes, and domain-general processes, such as attention and memory, are necessary for successful autobiographical memory retrieval. =Construction and retrieval= Autobiographical memories are initially constructed in left prefrontal neural networks. As a memory forms over time, activation then transitions to right posterior networks where it remains at a high level while the memory is held in the mind. Networks in the left frontal lobe in the dorsolateral cortex and bilaterally in the prefrontal cortex become active during autobiographical memory retrieval. These regions are involved with reconstructive mnemonic processes and self-referential processes, both integral to autobiographical memory retrieval. There is a complex pattern of activation over time of retrieval of detailed autobiographical memories that stimulates brain regions used not only in autobiographical memory, but feature in other memory tasks and other forms of cognition as well. It is the specific pattern in its totality that distinguishes autobiographical cognition from other forms of cognition. =Maintenance of a detailed memory= Autobiographical memory maintenance is predominantly observed as changing patterns of activity within posterior sensory regions; more specifically, occipitotemporal regions of the right hemisphere. Individual differences Autobiographical memory may differ greatly between individuals. A condition named highly superior autobiographical memory is one extreme, in which a person might recall vividly almost every day of their life (usually from around the age of 10). On the other extreme is severely deficient autobiographical memory where a person cannot relive memories from their lives, although this does not affect their everyday functioning.nscinews.wordpress.com/2018/06/17/highly-superior-and- severely-deficient-autobiographical-memory/ ReferencesExternal links Memory processes Memory ","title":"Autobiographical memory"},{"id":"21312301","text":"In psychology, context-dependent memory is the improved recall of specific episodes or information when the context present at encoding and retrieval are the same. In a simpler manner, \\"when events are represented in memory, contextual information is stored along with memory targets; the context can therefore cue memories containing that contextual information\\". One particularly common example of context-dependence at work occurs when an individual has lost an item (e.g. lost car keys) in an unknown location. Typically, people try to systematically \\"retrace their steps\\" to determine all of the possible places where the item might be located. Based on the role that context plays in determining recall, it is not at all surprising that individuals often quite easily discover the lost item upon returning to the correct context. This concept is heavily related to the encoding specificity principle. This example best describes the concept of context-dependent forgetting. However, the research literature on context-dependent memory describes a number of different types of contextual information that may affect recall such as environmental context-dependent memory, state-dependent learning, cognitive context-dependent memory and mood-congruent memory.Baddeley, A., M. W. Eysenck, and M. C. Anderson. 2009. Memory. Psychology Press, New York, NY, US. Research has also shown that context- dependence may play an important role in numerous situations, such as memory for studied material, or events that have occurred following the consumption of alcohol or other drugs. History=Early research= Some of the earliest research on this topic was conducted by researchers in the 1930s who analyzed how changes in context affect an individual's memory for nonsense syllables. These early studies were unable to demonstrate an effect of context-dependent memory. Such non-significant results encouraged the development of new methods, such as a retroactive interference paradigm, to analyze the effect of context on memory. By the 1950s, this technique was used to demonstrate an effect of contextual information on memory recall. However, the validity of using this particular paradigm has been questioned. Indeed, much of the early literature on this topic failed to provide conclusive evidence of any context-dependent effects on memory. By the end of the 1970s, numerous successful demonstrations of a context-dependent effect appear in the literature. As early as 1971, Jensen et al. found evidence that contradicted previous findings by demonstrating a context-dependent effect on memory for nonsense syllables. In a similar timeframe, Endel Tulving and Donald Thompson proposed their highly influential 'encoding specificity principle', which provided the first framework for understanding how contextual information affects memory and recall. In 1975, the question of whether contextual information influences memory recall was famously investigated with the publication of Godden and Baddeley's paper detailing the well-known 'diving study'. A few years prior to the publication of this study, researchers demonstrated that the memory of deep sea divers for events witnessed underwater was reduced after resurfacing.Egstrom, G.G., Weltman, G., Baddeley, A.D., Cuccaro, W.J., and Willis, M.A. (1972). Underwater work performance and work tolerance. Report no. 51, Bio-Technology Laboratory, University of California, Los Angeles. The authors note in their 1975 paper that this incidental result immediately suggested a possible influence of the contextual environment (being underwater) on recall. To test this hypothesis, Godden and Baddeley had divers learn and recall word lists in two separate environments; under water and on dry land. Their results demonstrated that memory for word lists learned under water was better when recall sessions occurred under water as well, and that a congruent effect existed for words learned and recalled on land. In simplified form: changing the context between encoding and retrieval reduced the divers' ability to recall learned words. The publication of this study likely initiated the current synthesis of context-dependent memory as it is studied by psychologists today. =Theoretical background= A number of factors are thought to affect how contextual information interacts with memory recall. For example, a meta-analysis of the literature on environmental context-dependent memory by Smith and Vela has suggested that in cases where contextual information is not particularly salient, context-dependent effects on memory are reduced. Similarly, this meta-analysis suggests that reinstatement of context can be achieved not only by physically returning to the encoding environment, but also by mentally visualizing that environment. This study considered only environmental context-dependence. Additionally, other psychological constructs suggest further limits on how context can affect memory. For example, Johnson et al.'s source monitoring framework proposes that the ability of an individual to remember the source of an episode will affect the likelihood of that memory being recalled. Hence, in the case of context-dependent memory, this framework suggests that the effects of context on memory may also be limited by cognitive factors such as the ability of individuals to differentiate between individual contexts. Context can refer to internal context, referring to state of mind at the time of memory encoding, or temporal context, which refers to the time when a memory was encoded, in addition to external context, or physical and situational surroundings. All of these types of context are incorporated as values into what are known as context vectors, vector representations of multiple context attributes, used in many theories of recall and recognition memory. In summed similarity theory, the use of a memory matrix includes the context as an attribute in a memory vector. Other attributes of a memory make up the remainder of the memory matrix representation of a particular memory item, in an array model for association. Summed Similarity Theory explains that the theoretical memory matrix is searched and the memory representation with the highest summed similarity of all memory vectors to the probe item is selected. Context plays a large role in this search, especially as more recent items in a memory matrix have closer matching contexts. The absolute-similarity framework also uses context as an important factor in determining how closely a probe vector and a memory vector match. Contextual drift can be thought of as a random walk, with one unit or step, in a random walk for each item stored in memory. The random walk can be in any direction and is representative of the gradually shifting physical or mental context of encoding. Absolute similarity framework determines whether a probe item is similar enough to a stored memory vector by the use of a threshold. Only those with similarities above threshold, C, are judged to be similar. Context plays a large role in this judgment because of the possibility that a probe item could be matched to a memory vector with a highly similar context rather than the corresponding item itself. Context effects do differ when it comes to what sort of task is being performed. According to a study by Godden & Baddeley, the effects of context change on memory retrieval are much greater in recall tasks than in recognition tasks. Meaning that a similar context associates with greater recall than recognition. Neuroanatomy The hippocampus is a brain structure shown to be involved in context-dependent memory'The prefrontal cortex is thought to play an important role in context-dependent memory A number of neuroanatomical structures are thought to play a role in context-dependent memory, These include the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. For example, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to demonstrate elevated activation in the hippocampus when contextual information matches from encoding to retrieval, suggesting that the hippocampus may be important in mediating context-dependent memory processes. Kalisch et al. provide further support for this role by demonstrating that context-dependent extinction memory is correlated with activation in both the hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Similarly, an experiment by Wagner et al. using fMRI demonstrated that activation of the right prefrontal cortex depended on contextual information. The authors of this study suggest that differential activation of the prefrontal cortex occurs because the different contexts require unique attempt processes for retrieval. In other words, depending on the retrieval context, participants used different strategies to recall information. Overall, the patterns of activation in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex following changes in contextual information suggest that these brain regions play an important role in context-dependent memory. Environmental Environmental context-dependent memory, as defined by Smith, refers to a phenomenon whereby environmental context influences cognitive processing. As mentioned earlier, pioneering work on environmental context- dependent memory was performed by Godden and Baddeley in 1975. Their work looked at the memory recall of deep-sea divers on land and under water. Baddeley's earlier research had indicated that the cold environment underwater could create a strong context dependency in deep sea divers. They conducted an experiment where divers were placed under water or on the beach and listened to a prerecorded list of 36 unrelated, two-and-three syllable words. After listening to the list of words they were tested on their recall of the words either in the same environment they were tested in or in the alternative environment. The results clearly showed that words learned underwater were best recalled underwater, and words learned on land were best recalled on land. =Environmental reinstatement effect= The most commonly researched area of environmental context-dependent memory is the phenomenon of the environmental reinstatement effect. This effect occurs when the reinstatement (i.e. revisiting) of an environmental context acts as a cue for past memories related to that particular environmental context.Smith, S.M. (1988) Environmental context-dependent memory. In G. Davies (Ed.), Memory in Context (pp. 13-31). John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Commonly, memories recalled in this situation are ones a subject believed they had forgotten, and it is only when an individual revisits this environmental context that they recall these memories. How much this effect occurs varies depending on a number of factors, and may be classified under two types of reinstatement effects: long-term and short-term. Long-term reinstatement effects The effects of environmental context-dependent memory are positively correlated with the length of time between initial encoding and retrieval of a memory, such that these effects increase with duration between encoding and retrieval. This correlation may help to explain the \\"flood\\" of memories an individual experiences after returning to a previous residence or school following a long period of absence. This common example of long-term reinstatement effects may occur for a number of reasons. For instance, a long duration of residence in a particular location is likely to increase the amount of environmental contextual information that is encoded to memory. When an individual moves to a new location with different contextual information, remembering and recalling information from this new environment may interfere with the old memories and result in \\"forgetting\\". However, when returning to the former location, the presence of contextual information \\"reactivates\\" these old memories, allowing them to be recalled, even after many years of absence. Another example of a long-term reinstatement effect is the revival of wartime memories by veterans and prisoners of war. Upon return to old battlefields, many of these individuals have been known to reconstruct tragic memories of life during wartime. A similar effect may occur when such individuals watch television war documentaries and broadcasts of battles, an effect attributed to generalization of the contextual cues associated with war. Importantly, due to the trauma associated with some of their experiences, recall of these past memories of war has been reported to lead many veterans to seek mental health care following exposure to this contextual information. Short-term reinstatement effects Momentary forgetting, such as forgetting what you wanted to get from the kitchen after getting up from your desk, is frequently experienced in day-to-day life. Usually what was forgotten can be remembered again by returning to the context where the event began. For example, imagine sitting at your desk and deciding you want to get a drink from the kitchen. Once you get to the kitchen, you completely forget what you wanted there. If you return to your desk, you will most likely remember what you wanted from the kitchen. There is also evidence to support that our lives and memories may be compartmentalized by our environmental surroundings. Different environments, such as home, the workplace, a restaurant or a theatre, are associated with different memories and incidentally, different roles. This implies that surroundings cue memories, situations and even personal roles specific to the context a person is in at any given time. =The outshining hypothesis= The outshining hypothesis is the phenomenon by which context effects are absent as a result of a different cue (item cue) suppressing the weaker cue at retrieval. This \\"outshining\\" can also occur for item cues by stronger context cues. It is based on the idea that a heavenly body is more difficult to see when it is obscured by a full moon. Similarly, incidental encoding of environmental context-dependent cues can be completely \\"outshone\\" when there are better cues available. However, these incidentally encoded environmental cues can be used to prompt memory recall if stronger cues are not present at encoding. A cue may be considered \\"better\\" simply because it has been more deeply processed, repeated more often, or has fewer items associated with it. As an example, a study by Steuck and Levy showed that environmental context-dependent memory has a decreased effect in word recall tests if the words are embedded into meaningful text. This is because meaningful texts are stored better in memory and are more deeply processed. State-dependent learning State-dependent learning refers to the finding that people recall more information when their physiological state is the same at encoding and retrieval. For example, people that undergo alcohol intoxication while encoding information recall significantly more when they are also intoxicated during retrieval, compared to those whose alcoholic states differ from encoding to retrieval. This state-dependent learning effect has been shown in both human and animal research., The state-dependent effect has also been generalized to a variety of drugs, including morphine, cigarettes, scopolamine, and nitric oxide. It is important to note, however, that certain drug states impair learning. For example, a study done by Harry demonstrated that despite the state-dependent effect associated with light marijuana use, people smoking marijuana showed slower learning than people in a placebo group.Rickles, W., Cohen, M.J., Whitaker, C.A., & McIntyre, K.E. (1973) Marijuana induced state-dependent verbal learning More precisely, people who consumed marijuana during both the encoding and retrieval phases managed to learn the material in an average of 10 trials, whereas people who were in the placebo condition for both phases learned the same material in only 5.6 trials, on average. =State as a contextual cue= A tentative explanation for state-dependent recall is the use of the physiological state as a contextual cue.Eich, J.M. (1980) The cue-dependent nature of state- dependent retrieval. Memory & Cognition, 157-173. Results of converging studies have shown that in tasks where no contextual cue is provided, internal states may serve as contextual cues. Therefore, people who are in a certain drug state at the time of encoding may utilize this state as a cue for retrieval. In contrast, when information is encoded and retrieved in different states, individuals have no cues available to aid them in recalling information, leading to a decline performance. Eich provides further evidence for this theory, demonstrating that the introduction of additional contextual cues abolishes the state-dependent effect. If a cue such as a sound or an image is provided to remind people of what they encoded, they no longer require the state to prompt retrieval. In this instance, participants perform equally, regardless of the states at encoding and retrieval. According to Eich, the complete absence of any other observable reminders is critical for showing state-dependent cueing effects. Cognitive=Language of discourse= Cognitive context-dependent memory is the improved memory recall for information that is both encoded and retrieved in the same cognitive state. The clearest example of a cognitive context-dependent effect has been demonstrated in studies of proficient bilingual speakers, as it has been hypothesized that different languages provide a different cognitive context. It has been shown that both autobiographical and semantic memories could be better recalled when the same language was used for both encoding and retrieval. In particular, Marian and Neisser studied this effect in Russian immigrants to the United States by looking at autobiographical memory. For this study, participants were asked to recall specific autobiographical memories in response to word cues. By varying both the language of the interview (either Russian or English) and the language word cues were presented in, it was possible to alter which autobiographical memories were recalled. Importantly, interviewing and word-cueing in Russian biased participants towards recalling memories that had occurred in that language. Matsumoto and Stanley found a similar effect for Japanese-American students. In particular, they demonstrated that cues words written in Japanese were more likely than English cue words to induce memories from participants' past experiences in Japan. Other studies have suggested similar results for bilinguals in Spanish and English, and in Polish and Danish. However, these studies used a different experimental design that does not demonstrate a causal effect. Additionally, Marian and Fausey found an effect of language on recall of semantic information in studies of Spanish-English bilinguals. In particular, they show that accuracy and reaction times are improved for recall of academic information when the language of encoding and retrieval are similar. However, they also suggest that this effect partially depends on participants' language proficiency (i.e., poor English speakers did not show an improvement in scores when English was used for both encoding and retrieval). =\\"Motivational state\\"= It has also been suggested that changes in \\"motivational state\\" between encoding and retrieval may affect memory recall for events. In a study by Woike et al. participants were asked to read stories of differing motivational contexts and to recall specific information from these stories. The authors found that recall was biased towards stories containing information that matched participants' own motivational state. Another study by Woike et al. provides a more direct examination of context- dependence by testing the effect of motivational contextual cues on recall of specific word pairs. Specifically, the authors demonstrated that associating word pairs with achievement cues produced a motivational context that increased memory for these word pairs. This study in particular uses neutral motivational cues as a control. These neutral cues did not produce similar improvements in recall for word pairs. Mood-congruent and mood-dependent memory One commonly reported phenomenon is that when individuals are in a \\"bad mood\\", they typically recall more bad things having happened to them and evaluate episodes in their lives in a more negative way than usual. It has been suggested that this effect occurs because a person's mood at any given time has a strong influence on which aspects of their environment seem most salient. This affects what they remember about the past, and what they encode about the present.Lewis, P. & Critchley, H. (2003). Mood-dependent memory. Trends in Cognitive Sciences. This particular effect is referred to as mood- congruent and mood-dependent memory. =Mood-congruent memory= Mood- congruent memory has been demonstrated by the finding that emotional material is remembered more reliably in moods that match the emotional content of these memories. For example, when feeling depressed, it is quite typical for an individual to remember more of the negative events their past than of the positive events. Hence, the mood-congruence memory effect refers to better recall for information contained in experiences that match an individual's current emotional state. This effect has been found to occur for both happy and sad memories. Specifically, happy people will remember more happy than sad information, whereas sad people will better remember sad than happy information. Mood-congruent memory bias has been found for explicit but not implicit memory tasks, which suggests that mood-congruent memory requires an awareness of one's own mood state. There also seems to be a higher occurrence of mood-congruent memory in females, possibly due to a purportedly greater amount of mood awareness. Further evidence for the existence of mood-congruent memory comes from studies demonstrating altered memory recall following experimentally-induced changes in mood using drugs. Additionally, mood- congruent memory bias in explicit memory has been found to be specific to information congruent with negative moods rather than to all negative information. Studies of clinical depression have demonstrated congruent findings. =Mood-dependent memory= Mood dependence is the facilitation of memory when mood at retrieval is matched to mood at encoding. Thus, the likelihood of recalling an event is higher when encoding and recall moods match than when they are mismatched. However, it seems that only authentic moods have the power to produce these mood-dependent effects. It has also been found that events that originate through internal mental operations‚Äîsuch as reasoning, imagination, and thought‚Äîare more connected to one's current mood than are those that emanate from external sources. This makes the former less likely than external events to be recalled after a shift in mood state. Importantly, this role of emotional state in memory recall suggests a potential mechanism for enhancing retrieval of past memories. Context- dependent forgetting A large body of research has shown that memory performance is reduced when an individual's environment differs from encoding to retrieval than if the two environments were the same. This effect is known as context-dependent forgetting. As a result, a number of techniques have been created for the purpose of reducing context-dependent forgetting associated with environmental cues. =Context recall technique= One strategy for overcoming context-dependent forgetting is the context recall technique. This technique involves consciously generating old environmental cues from memory rather than physically reinstating the cued environment. For example, if an individual learned material in a classroom where the desks were organized in rows, that person could visualize that specific arrangement at a later testing date in a new environment (i.e. with the desks arranged in a circle). In a study conducted by Smith in 1979, participants who used this technique while being tested in a new room were able to recall as many words as participants who were tested in the original learning room. Participants who were tested in a new room that did not use this technique showed typical context-dependent forgetting, recalling only two-thirds of the words recalled by the other groups. Therefore, the effects of context-dependent forgetting can be reduced by visualization of the learning environment without full reinstatement. However, this technique is only useful and successful when the learning context is easy to remember. =Multiple learning context technique= The multiple-learning-context-technique is another strategy proposed by Smith to combat context-dependent forgetting. This technique involves presenting subsets of the learning material in multiple contexts rather than presenting them all in the same environment. When given a free recall test in a new room, participants who studied in multiple rooms recalled more words than participants who only studied in one room. Smith suggests that when individuals have additional environmental cues their performance will be sustained because it will be less likely that all of the cues will be forgotten. Along with the multiple learning context technique, other research has demonstrated that increasing the number of environmental cues will increase an individual's recall performance. The cue-overload theory proposed by Watkins and Watkins in 1975 explains that the effectiveness of an environmental cue will decline when there is an increase in the number of items that it is associated with. Therefore, when given a fixed number of items to recall, performance will increase if the number of cues also increases. This theory focuses on one of the two factors that must be considered when determining the effectiveness of multiple learning environments: the variety of contextual cues. However, research conducted by Jones in 1976 demonstrates that for this technique to be useful, the cues must use different senses. For example, there is no recall advantage when only the number of visual cues is increased. On the other hand, there is a recall advantage when different sensory media such as sight, sound, and smell were added together. Hence, this suggests that using multiple sensory media as sources for cues during encoding will provide an advantage in different testing environments where the number of contextual cues has been reduced. =Attention= The second factor to be considered when determining the effectiveness of multiple learning environments is the likelihood that an individual will even use environmental cues when recalling. Instructing subjects to use self-generated cues (i.e. the context recall technique) will increase recall for participants tested in a different environment. However, individuals do not automatically do this when learning occurs in a single location. Therefore, by moving individuals from room to room, they may pay more attention to the environmental cues. Smith claims that both the context recall technique and the multiple learning context technique work similarly, in that both methods force individuals to pay attention to and remember environmental information. In 2003, Chu et al. demonstrated that conscious effort and attention is important to overcome context-dependent forgetting. Their research has shown that active processing of the context during the encoding phase is an important factor of successful performance. When actively attending to environmental cues with the goal of using a technique such as the context recall technique, stronger associations are created between the material and the environment. However, if an individual does not actively attend to environmental cues during the encoding phase, such cues may not be easily visualized in the recall phase if a new context is present. =Ambient and transferable cues= The word ambient is defined as completely surrounding and encompassing.Music is considered an ambient cue in that it is all encompassing and aids in recall when learning context and recall context are different Some researchers have suggested that ambient cues, such as odour and sound, aid in recall when the learning context and recall context are different. In addition, these cues are useful in recall because they can also be transferable. For example, if music is played in a room where material is learned, it is sometimes possible to transfer that musical source to a different room where material will be tested. This phenomenon, which occurs when a memory or emotion is reactivated by a song that is associated to a specific event, demonstrates the effectiveness of sound (and odour) as useful cues in the absence of the original context. Using transferable cues may be useful for individuals who have difficulty using the context recall technique because they have trouble creating a mental image of the original environment. For example, this technique has been proven useful for patients at home who are trying to reproduce skills that they learned in a hospital environment. Context-dependent extinction Extinction refers to the loss of performance after a conditioned stimulus is no longer paired with an unconditioned stimulus. It can also refer to the loss of an operant response when it is no longer reinforced. Research done by Bouton (2002) has shown that extinction is not an example of unlearning, but a new type of learning where the performance of the individual depends on the context. The renewal effect is seen when a participant is first conditioned in a context (context A) and then shows extinction in another context (B). Returning to context A may renew the conditioned response. This evidence demonstrates that appropriate responses underlying extinction may be linked to contextual information. Hence, someone who is in the context in which they initially learned the material is likely to be cued to act as they were initially conditioned to act. If they are in the extinction context, then that context will likely prompt them not to respond. After the extinction of learned fear, Maren and colleagues have shown that the context-dependence of extinction is mediated by hippocampal and prefrontal cortical neurons projecting to the amygdala. =Clinical applications= Extinction is often used in a type of clinical therapy called exposure therapy to treat disorders such as phobias and anxiety and is also used to treat drug dependence. For example, a person who learns to associate snakes with a traumatic event such as being bitten may develop a phobia. As a treatment, a therapist may choose to expose the person to snakes in the absence of any traumatic event, leading to extinction of maladaptive behaviours related to fear. However, due to the fact that extinction is a context-dependent process, it may lead to relapse once the patient is no longer in the extinction context. In a study by Crombag and Shaham, rats were taught to self-administer a heroin and cocaine mixture followed by twenty days of extinction. Half of the rats experienced extinction in the same context as the original self-administration and the other half in a new context. The rats that underwent extinction in a new context renewed drug self-administration significantly more than the other rats when they were put back in the original context. A similar effect was shown in human exposure therapy for severe fear of spiders. The participants who were treated through extinction and later tested in the same context were significantly less afraid than the participants who were treated and tested in different contexts. This shows the lack of generalizability of one context to another in exposure therapy. Hence, it should be taken into consideration that context-dependence of extinction is critical for successful treatments. To acquire stable and effective extinction of phobias, anxiety, or drug-seeking, the context of extinction must be as similar as possible to the day-to-day encounters with emotion-arousing cues that patients may experience. Tips for studying Students are advised to prepare for tests under similar contexts as they expect to be tested in‚Äîfor example, under silent conditions According to the literature cited above, information is better recalled when the context matches from encoding to retrieval. Therefore, when a person is studying, he/she should match the studying context as best as possible to the testing context to optimize the amount of material that will be recalled. This idea was made apparent in a study done by Grant et al. In this study, participants were asked to study meaningful information under either quiet or noisy conditions. Afterwards, they were asked short-answer and multiple choice questions on the previously learned material, which prompted both recognition and recall. Half of them were tested under silent conditions and the other half under noisy conditions. The participants whose noise-level matched during studying and testing conditions remembered significantly more information than those whose noise- level was mismatched. Grant et al. conclude that students should take into consideration the context of testing, such as the noise level, while studying, in order to maximize their performance on both recall and recognition tasks. Further, in cases where it is not possible to have similar learning and testing contexts, individuals who pay conscious attention to cues in the learning environment may produce better results when recalling this information. By doing so, individuals are better able to create a mental image of the original context when trying to recall information in the new testing context‚Äîallowing for improved memory retrieval. Further, several contextual cues should be attended to, using more than one sensory system to maximize the number of cues that can help remember information. References Memory processes ","title":"Context-dependent memory"},{"id":"21312304","text":"Olfactory memory refers to the recollection of odors. Studies have found various characteristics of common memories of odor memory including persistence and high resistance to interference. Explicit memory is typically the form focused on in the studies of olfactory memory, though implicit forms of memory certainly supply distinct contributions to the understanding of odors and memories of them. Research has demonstrated that the changes to the olfactory bulb and main olfactory system following birth are extremely important and influential for maternal behavior. Mammalian olfactory cues play an important role in the coordination of the mother infant bond, and the following normal development of the offspring. Maternal breast odors are individually distinctive, and provide a basis for recognition of the mother by her offspring. Throughout evolutionary history, olfaction has served various purposes related to the survival of the species, such as the development of communication. Even in humans and other animals today, these survival and communication aspects are still functioning. There is also evidence suggesting that there are deficits in olfactory memory in individuals with brain degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia. These individuals lose the ability to distinguish smells as their disease worsens. There is also research showing that deficits in olfactory memory can act as a base in assessing certain types of mental disorders such as depression as each mental disorder has its own distinct pattern of olfactory deficits. Mechanism=Physiology=Odorant An odorant is a physiochemical molecule that binds to a specific receptor protein. In mammals, each olfactory receptor protein has one type of molecule that it responds to, known as the one-olfactory-one-neuron rule, and approximately one thousand kinds of which have been identified.Pinel, J.P. (2006). Biopsychology. 6th ed. Boston, MA, US: Pearson Education Inc. Structure and complexity constitute an odorant's features, with changes resulting in altered odorant quality. An odorant's features are detected by the olfactory system's glomeruli and mitral cells which can be found in the olfactory bulb, a cortical structure involved in the perceptual differentiation of odorants.Guerin, D. (2008). Norepinephrine neuromodulation in the olfactory bulb modulates odor habituation and spontaneous discrimination. Behavioral neuroscience, 122(4), 816. The olfactory bulb itself affects how odors come to be encoded through its temporal structure and firing rate, which in turn influences the likelihood of an odorant being remembered. Neuromodulators Neuromodulation exists in the olfactory system and is responsible for neural plasticity and behavioural change in both mammals and insects.Wilson, DA. (2006). Learning to smell: Olfactory perception from neurobiology to behavior.. Baltimore, MD, US: Johns Hopkins University Press. In the context of olfactory memory, neuromodulators regulate storage of information in a way that maintains the significance of the olfactory experience. These systems are highly dependent on norepinephrine and acetylcholine, which affect both implicit and explicit memory. Studies involving the noradrenergic system of mice demonstrate elimination of habitual learning when areas involving this system are lesioned, and subsequent restoration of habitual learning abilities when noradrenaline is injected into the olfactory bulb.Guerin, D. (2008). Noradrenergic neuromodulation in the olfactory bulb modulates odor habituation and spontaneous discrimination. Behavioral neuroscience, 122(4), 824. The importance of cholinergic systems has been demonstrated in studies of rats and the effects of scopolamine, with acetylcholine being involved in initial learning stages and more specifically in the reduction of interference between stored memories.De Rosa, Eve. (2000). Muscarinic Cholinergic Neuromodulation Reduces Proactive Interference Between Stored Odor Memories During Associative Learning in Rats. Beahvioural Neuroscience, 114(1), 29-40. =Implicit odor memory= Implicit memories of stimuli do not require conscious recollection of the initial encounter of the stimulus.Rouby, C., Schaal, B., Dubois, D., Gervais, R., & Holley, A., (Eds.). (2002). Olfaction, taste and cognition. New York: Cambridge University Press. In regards to olfactory memory, deliberate recollection of an odor experience is not necessary in order for implicit memories of odors to form in the brain. Techniques used to study implicit olfactory memory are considered to be applicable to both humans and animals.Schab, F., & Crowder, R. G. (Eds.). (1995). Memory for odors. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. In tests of implicit memory, memory of a stimulus is shown to be aided by previous exposure to that same stimulus. Evidence of the formation of implicit memory is found in tests of habituation, sensitization, perceptual learning and classical conditioning. In olfaction there exists a strong tendency for habituation, which is discussed further in the following paragraph. By evaluating memory performance of tasks involving one of these ‚Äòsubsets‚Äô of implicit memory, the effect of previous odor stimulus experience not involving conscious recollection can be measured. Further knowledge can be gained about implicit memory of odor through the study of the implications of cognitive deficits. The effects of brain injury on odor memory can be investigated through the use of these implicit memory measures leading to further overall understanding of the brain. Habituation Habituation involves decreased levels of attention and responsiveness to a stimulus that is no longer perceived as being novel. In the realm of olfactory memory, habituation refers to a decrease in responsiveness to an odor as a result of prolonged exposure (restricted to a certain repeated stimulus), which involves adaptation of cells in the olfactory system. Receptor neurons and mitral cells located in the olfactory system adapt in response to odors. This includes the involvement of piriform cortical neurons which adapt rapidly, more completely and selectively to novel odors and are also thought to play a very important role in the habituation of odors. Norepinephrine is considered to have an effect on the functioning of the mitral cells by increasing their responsiveness. Acetylcholine is also regarded as an important neurotransmitter involved in the habituation of olfactory stimulus, though the exact means through which it operates are not yet clear. =Explicit memory= Explicit, unlike implicit memory for odors, is thought by some to be a phenomenon that is exclusive to humans. Explicit memory refers to memories that are remembered with conscious awareness of doing so.Radvansky, G., (2006). Human Memory. Boston, MA: Pearson Education Group, Inc. In olfaction, explicit memory refers to attributing associative meaning to odors. Through the assignment of associations to odors as well as non-odor stimuli, olfactory stimuli can gain meaning. Explicit memories of odors include information which can be used to process and compare other encountered odors. Attention focused on odors aids in the functioning of everyday life as well as the engagement of proper responses to experienced events.Olsson, MJ. (2003). Implicit and explicit memory for odors: Hemispheric differences. Memory & cognition, 31(1), 44-50. Evidence of explicit olfaction memory is seen through behaviours in tasks involving a working memory component. The two most commonly used tests for explicit odor memory are odor identification and odor recognition, which are discussed in greater detail below. Odor recognition Odor recognition is the most common and direct means used to measure odor memory. In an odor recognition test participants are asked whether or not they recognize an odor. More specifically, a participant is subjected to a certain olfactory-related stimulus, and after a delay period is asked to decide if a probe (a stimulus that could or could not be the same as the initial stimulus) is the same as the one he/she initially encountered. Memory accuracy is assessed by the amount of correct recognition decisions that are made. A potential problem with this measure involves the generation of verbal labels that may enhance memory for olfactory stimuli. There are various ways of measuring the effect of verbal labeling, which include comparison of odors and odor names, as well as the speed and accuracy with which lexical decisions are made regarding odor names. It has been suggested that odor recognition testing should be considered as a measure that involves both memory for perceptual information as well as potentially confounding memory due to the generation of verbal labels. Odor identification Odor identification requires the specific labeling of presented olfactory stimuli, unlike odor recognition. Neural coding refers to the way that the identity, concentration, and pleasurable value of olfactory stimuli are represented in the pattern of action potentials relayed to the brain from the olfactory bulb.Purves, D. Augustine, G. Fitzpatrick, D. Hall, W. LaMantia, A.S. White, L. (2012). Neuroscience 5th Edition. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Identification begins with an odorant binding to specific odorant receptor proteins. Olfactory receptor molecules are very similar to G-protein- linked receptors and belong to the odorant receptor gene family. The specificity of odor recognition is the result of the molecular variety of odorant receptor proteins and their interaction with the odorant molecules. However, the specific mechanism of certain receptors binding with certain odorant molecules is not well understood. Odorant receptor genes also play a major role in odor identification. Expression in olfactory receptor neurons has been confirmed for a limited subset of the huge number of odorant receptor genes. Genetic analysis shows that odorant receptor neurons express only one type of odorant receptor gene. It is hypothesized that different odors activate different receptors, and genetic regulation of odorant receptors results in the diversity for olfactory receptor neurons and this allows the capacity of olfactory systems to detect and encode a wide range of complex and novel odors in the environment. =Hemispheric differences= Although bilateral activation of the brain has been seen with unilateral stimulation (accomplished by placing a stimulus under one nostril only), the activation seen is not exactly equal in both hemispheres. Different parts of the brain are involved in olfactory memory, depending on what type of memory is being processed (e.g. implicit memory-habituation or explicit memory-recognition) and this is evident in the results of explicit and implicit tasks of memory. Studies have shown that the left hemisphere is activated during verbal semantic retrieval of odor-related memories, while the right hemisphere shows activation during non-verbal retrieval of semantic odor-related information. Much overlap does occur between regions, however. Information of odors of a semantic nature is distributed across both sides of the brain, although the right hemisphere is more involved in the processing of odor quality and previous encounter of the stimulus than the left. Neural plasticity is also an important part of olfaction, as different experiences may result in alterations of both cortical and subcortical circuitry in the brain. =Role of the amygdala= The amygdala is a complex set of nuclei situated in the anterior temporal lobe and lies beneath the primary olfactory cortex. The amygdala is involved in the formation of memories of emotional experiences, particularly those associated with fear, flight, and defense. It is connected by various pathways to other parts of the brain, but most notably to the basal forebrain which contains magnocellular cells which provide extensive input into the neocortex and hippocampus. There are also direct projections to the hippocampus from the amygdala, which are involved in the integration of various sensations into memory. Neuropsychological research has suggested that this pathway is vital for the development of olfactory memories. The primary olfactory cortex and the hippocampus have extensive connections with the amygdala through both indirect and direct pathways. It is important for an animal to create memories of olfactory stimuli which threaten its survival. Without a properly functioning amygdala, olfactory memories would not be able to form which could put an animal at risk of dangerous stimuli in its environment due its lack of memory of such stimuli.Buchanan, TW. (2003). A specific role for the human amygdala in olfactory memory. Learning & memory, 10(5), P 319. Behavioural effects Odors can evoke positive autobiographical memories and increase positive emotions, decrease negative mood states, disrupt cravings, and reduce physiological indices of stress, including systemic markers of inflammation. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.Herz, R.S., Eliassen, J., Beland, S. and Souza, T. (2004). evidence for the emotional potency of odor-evoked memory, 42(3), pp.371‚Äì378. =Neurological and structural development= Studies demonstrate that the changes to the olfactory bulb and main olfactory system following birth are extremely important and influential for maternal behavior.L√©vy, F., Locatelli, A., Piketty, V., Tillet, Y., & Poindron, P. (1994). Involvement of the main but not the accessory olfactory system in maternal behavior of primiparous and multiparous ewes. Physiology and Behavior (57) 1: 97-104. Pregnancy and childbirth result in a high state of plasticity of the olfactory system that may facilitate olfactory learning within the mother. Neurogenesis likely facilitates the formation of olfactory memory in the mother, as well as the infant. A significant change takes place in the regulation of olfaction just after birth so that odors related with the offspring are no longer aversive, allowing the female to positively respond to her babies. Research with a variety of animals suggest the role of norepinephrine in olfactory learning, in which norepinephrine neurons in the locus coeruleus send projections to neurons in the main and accessory olfactory bulbs. This is significant in the formation of olfactory memory and learning. The main olfactory bulb is one of the neural structures that experiences profound change when exposed to offspring odors at the time of childbirth. Human neuroimaging studies suggest that activation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) occurs during tests of olfactory memory.Broad, K.D., Hinton, M.R., Keverne, B., & Kendrick, K.M. (2002). Involvement of the medial prefrontal cortex in mediating behavioral responses to odor cues rather than olfactory recognition memory. Neuroscience (114) 5: 715-729. The medial prefrontal cortex receives extensive olfactory projections, which are activated immediately after birth in correspondence with primary olfactory processing regions. Although there is no functional specificity for the main or accessory olfactory systems in the development of maternal behaviors, it has been shown that the main olfactory system is affected when individual odor discrimination of the offspring is required; this system experiences significant change following exposure to offspring odors after giving birth. Changes in synaptic circuitry also contribute to the level of maternal responsiveness and memorization to these odors. =Olfactory cues=Mammalian studies Mammalian olfactory cues play an important role in the coordination of the mother infant bond, and the following normal development of the offspring. The offspring of several different mammals are attracted to the odor of amniotic fluid, which helps to calm and adapt the infant to the novel environment outside of the womb. Sheep form olfactory recognition memory for their lambs within 2‚Äì4 hours of giving birth, which causes the mother to subsequently reject advances from unfamiliar lambs and scents. This bond is thought to be enhanced by olfactory cues that cause enhanced transmission across synapses of the olfactory bulb. After the birth of the offspring, there is a shift in the value of the infant's odors to the mother, which causes change in neural structures such as the olfactory bulb. These changes contribute to maternal responsiveness and memorization of these odors. Olfactory cues from the baby lamb are important in establishing maternal behavior and bonding. After birth, the smell of amniotic fluid (which was previously disgusting) becomes attractive for ewes. Amniotic fluid is one of the primary olfactory cues that the ewe is exposed to after birth, allowing her to be attracted to any newborn lamb associated with that amniotic fluid. The amniotic fluid produces olfactory cues, and a response from the ewe that cause her to be attracted to the newborn lamb. When newborn lambs were washed with soap (or even water) it greatly reduced the degree of licking behavior by the maternal ewe, and consequently prevented her from displaying acceptance behavior towards the newborn. The main olfactory system in sheep is quite significant in the developing appropriate maternal behaviors in sheep. Physiological, behavioral and anatomical evidence show that some species may have a functioning olfactory system in utero. Newborn infants respond positively to the smell of their own amniotic fluid, which may serve as evidence for intrauterine olfactory learning. Mammals‚Äô sense of smell becomes mature at an early stage of development. Fetal olfactory memory has been demonstrated in rats, for example. This is shown by rat pups, who avoid odors that they experienced in association with a noxious stimulus prior to birth. While animal studies play an important role in helping discover and learn olfaction memory of humans, it is important to pay attention to the specifics of each study, as they cannot always be generalized across all species. Human studies Research studies provide evidence that the fetus becomes familiar with chemical cues in the intrauterine environment. Intrauterine olfactory learning may be demonstrated by behavioral evidence that newborn infants respond positively to the smell of their own amniotic fluid. Infants are responsive to the olfactory cues associated with maternal breast odors. They are able to recognize and react favorably to scents emitted from their own mother's breasts, despite the fact that they also may be attracted to breast odors from unfamiliar nursing females in a different context. The unique scent of the mother (to the infant) is referred to as her olfactory signature. While breasts are a source of the unique olfactory cue of the mother, infants are also able to recognize and respond with familiarity and preference to their mother's underarm scent. Olfactory cues are widespread within parental care to assist in the dynamic of the mother-infant relationship, and later development of the offspring. In support of fetal olfactory learning, newborn infants display behavioral attraction to the odor of amniotic fluid. For example, babies would more often suck from a breast treated with an amount of their own amniotic fluid, rather than the alternative untreated breast. Newborns are initially attracted to their own amniotic fluid because that odor is familiar. Although exposure to amniotic fluid is eliminated after birth, breast fed babies have continued contact with cues from the mother's nipple and areola area. This causes breast odors to become more familiar and attractive, while amniotic fluid loses its positive value. Maternal breast odors are individually distinctive, and provide a basis for recognition of the mother by her offspring. =Role of olfaction in maternal bonding and subsequent development= As demonstrated by animals in the wild (the great apes, for example), the offspring is held by the mother immediately after birth without cleaning and is continually exposed to the familiar odor of the amniotic fluid (making the transition from the intrauterine to extrauterine environment less overwhelming). In newborn mammals, the nipple area of the mother is significant as the sole source of necessary nutrients. The maternal olfactory scent that is unique to the mother becomes associated with food intake, and newborns who do not gain access to the mother's breasts would die shortly after birth. As a result, it seems natural selection should favor the development of a means to help in maintain and establish effective breast feeding. Maternal breast odors signal the presence of a food source for the newborn. These breast odors bring forth positive responses in neonates from as young as 1 hour or less through to several weeks postpartum. The mother's olfactory signature is experienced with reinforcing stimuli such as food, warmth and tactile stimulation; enhancing further learning of that cue. While infants are generally attracted to the odors produced by lactating women, infants are particularly responsive to their mother's unique scent. These olfactory cues are used in mammals during maternal care for coordination of mother-infant interaction. Familiarization with odors that will be encountered after birth may help the baby adapt to the otherwise unfamiliar environment. Neural structures such as the olfactory bulb undergo extensive changes when exposed to infantile odors; providing a starting point for individual recognition by the mother. odors from the breasts of lactating women serve as attractants for neonates, regardless of feeding history of the infant. Maternal olfactory learning occurs due to the high state of plasticity and flux within the olfactory system during pregnancy and childbirth. Evolution=Search for food= Studies of the mammalian brain have discovered that the excess of cerebral neurons is a phenomenon of mainly animals which had to seek and capture food. These neurons have become a large part of the olfactory system throughout evolution to allow higher mammals such as primates to have a better chance for survival through more advanced methods of hunting and finding food.Magill, Frank Northern. 1998. Psychology Basics. Pasadena, CA: Salem Press. P 418-419. For example, the vulture has a large part of its brain committed to olfactory senses. This allows for it to be able to detect food at long ranges without being able to see it.Gazzaniga, Michael S. 1998. The Mind‚Äôs Past. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press. P 105. Having memory for various types of food aids in survival by allowing the animals to remember which scent is edible and which is not. =Communication and identification= Olfactory memory has also been developed throughout evolution to help animals recognize other animals.Goldstein, Bruce E. 2002. Sensation and Perception: 6th Edition. Pacific Grove CA: Wadsworth Group. P 477. It is suggested that smell allows for young infants to identify with their mothers or for humans to identify between males and females. Olfaction cues were also used, and are still used, by many animals to mark territory, protecting themselves from other threats to their survival.Goldstein, Bruce E. 2002. Sensation and Perception: 6th Edition. Pacific Grove CA: Wadsworth Group. P 475. While the development of other sensory systems, such as the visual system and auditory systems, has decreased how reliant some animals are on the olfactory system, there is still evidence that shows these animals‚Äô olfactory systems still have a strong influence on their social interactions. The memory for specific odorants gives the animal an opportunity to communicate with members of the same species and allows for lack of communication between species that do not have the proper receptor systems for the odor. These chemical signals can also be sensed in the dark or even under water. =Sexual reproduction= Olfaction is a very important aspect in sexual reproduction throughout evolution because it triggers mating behaviour in many species. Pheromones as olfactory chemical signals allow for members of the same species to perceive when other members are ready for reproduction. It can also lead to the synchronization of menstrual cycles in females within the species and influence sexual attraction between members within the species. Having an unconscious memory for such processes has allowed for species to survive. =Warning stimulus= The development of a sense of smell is also thought to have arisen to function as an arousal system. Once an odor enters into conscious memory, it can signal the presence of a threat, like the smell of gas or smoke. However, odor memory can also be an implicit or unconscious process. This ability to respond automatically to a warning stimulus is much like pre-attentive processes in other sensory systems which involve the use of automatic forms of memory. These response patterns have evolved over time and involve a wide variety of motor and autonomic responses which are integrated into the behaviour pattern of reacting to a warning stimulus. odor-induced anxiety can be caused when an animal senses a predator. A study conducted on rats showed that when a rat was exposed to cat odors, there was increased anxiety-related behaviour in the rat. The cat odor induced an inhibition of the endocannabinoid system in the amygdala which has been suggested to induce anxiety-related responses. Deficits=Olfactory deficits in the brain= Olfactory memory deficits can be significant indicators of brain damage and pathology. There is evidence to suggest that certain mental disorders not only produce olfactory deficits but also predict them. Evidence has been found for a number of disorders, including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, alcoholic Korsakoff's syndrome, and Alzheimer's disease. In animal research certain brain altering drugs such as anti-depressants produce deficits in olfactory memory.Lamboin. S et all. 2007. Effects of anti-depressents on olfactory sensitivity in mice. Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry 32 (2008) 629‚Äì632. In testing the effects of anti-depressants on olfactory sensitivity in mice, the ‚Äúmice were tested in a Y-maze with a choice between an odorant (butanol) or distilled water before and during 3 weeks of dailyintra-peritoneal injection of either citalopram or clomipramine. Their performance was compared with those of a control group injected with a saline solution‚Äù and the results were that significant olfactory deficits were found during the three-week period of testing. =Olfactory deficits and testing= Many tests have been developed to test olfactory memory in patients with mental disorders. The 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) and the 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test, that was developed from the UPSIT, both test olfactory identification using a scratch and sniff booklet. The Sniffin' Sticks olfactory test consists of several pens that hold different scents and different dilutions, and this test provides scores for three olfactory domains: identification, threshold and discrimination. =Olfactory deficits and prediction of mental illness or disease= Olfactory deficits have been found in patients suffering from mental disorders and there is evidence suggesting that olfactory deficits can be a predictor of mental illness and disease. Research suggests that olfactory memory deficits can be good predictors of several mental disorders such as depression, dementia and neurodegeneration, as each disorder has its own distinct features leading to specific predictions about what type of mental disorder a person may have.

For example, the word \`NURSE\` is recognized more quickly following the word \`DOCTOR\` than following the word \`BREAD\`. Priming can be perceptual, associative, repetitive, positive, negative, affective, semantic, or conceptual. Research, however, has yet to firmly establish the duration of priming effects, yet their onset can be almost instantaneous. Priming works most effectively when the two stimuli are in the same modality. For example, visual priming works best with visual cues and verbal priming works best with verbal cues. But priming also occurs between modalities,Several researchers, for example, have used cross-modal priming to investigate syntactic deficits in individuals with damage to Broca's area of the brain. See the following: }} *For an overview, see also or between semantically related words such as \\"doctor\\" and \\"nurse\\". Types=Positive and negative priming= The terms positive and negative priming refer to when priming affects the speed of processing. A positive prime speeds up processing, while a negative prime lowers the speed to slower than un-primed levels. Positive priming is caused by simply experiencing the stimulus,Reisberg, Daniel: Cognition: Exploring the Science of the Mind (2007), page 255, 517. while negative priming is caused by experiencing the stimulus, and then ignoring it. Positive priming effects happen even if the prime is not consciously seen. The effects of positive and negative priming are visible in event-related potential (ERP) readings. Positive priming is thought to be caused by spreading activation. This means that the first stimulus activates parts of a particular representation or association in memory just before carrying out an action or task. The representation is already partially activated when the second stimulus is encountered, so less additional activation is needed for one to become consciously aware of it. Negative priming is more difficult to explain. Many models have been hypothesized, but currently the most widely accepted are the distractor inhibition and episodic retrieval models. In the distractor inhibition model, the activation of ignored stimuli is inhibited by the brain. The episodic retrieval model hypothesizes that ignored items are flagged 'do- not-respond' by the brain. Later, when the brain acts to retrieve this information, the tag causes a conflict. The time taken to resolve this conflict causes negative priming. Although both models are still valid, recent scientific research has led scientists to lean away from the distractor inhibitor model. =Perceptual and conceptual priming= The difference between perceptual and conceptual primes is whether items with a similar form or items with a similar meaning are primed, respectively. Perceptual priming is based on the form of the stimulus and is enhanced by the match between the early and later stimuli. Perceptual priming is sensitive to the modality and exact format of the stimulus. An example of perceptual priming is the identification of an incomplete word in a word-stem completion test. The presentation of the visual prime does not have to be perfectly consistent with later testing presentations in order to work. Studies have shown that, for example, the absolute size of the stimuli can vary and still provide significant evidence of priming. Conceptual priming is based on the meaning of a stimulus and is enhanced by semantic tasks. For example, table, will show priming effects on chair, because table and chair belong to the same category. =Repetition= Repetition priming, also called direct priming, is a form of positive priming. When a stimulus is experienced, it is also primed. This means that later experiences of the stimulus will be processed more quickly by the brain. This effect has been found on words in the lexical decision task. =Semantic= This image shows a priming web built from different types of priming. The lines in this web indicate associations that an individual might have. If two words are more closely linked in the web, then they are more likely to be more quickly recognized when primed with a nearby word. The dotted lines indicate morpheme primes, or primes from words that sound similar to each other, while the straight lines indicate semantic primes or words that have meanings or associations that relate to each other. In semantic priming, the prime and the target are from the same semantic category and share features.Ludovic Ferrand and Boris New: Semantic and associative priming in the mental lexicon, found on: boris.new.googlepages.com/Semantic- final-2003.pdf For example, the word dog is a semantic prime for wolf, because the two are similar animals. Semantic priming is theorized to work because of spreading activation within associative networks. When a person thinks of one item in a category, similar items are stimulated by the brain. Even if they are not words, morphemes can prime for complete words that include them. An example of this would be that the morpheme 'psych' can prime for the word 'psychology'. In support with further detail, when an individual processes a word sometimes that word can be affected when the prior word is linked semantically. Previous studies have been conducted, focusing on priming effects having a rapid rise time and a hasty decay time. For example, an experiment by Donald Frost researched the decay time of semantic facilitation in lists and sentences. Three experiments were conducted and it was found that semantic relationships within words differs when words occur in sentences rather than lists. Thus, supporting the ongoing discourse model. =Associative priming= In associative priming, the target is a word that has a high probability of appearing with the prime, and is \\"associated\\" with it but not necessarily related in semantic features. dog is an associative prime for cat, since the words are closely associated and frequently appear together (in phrases like \\"raining cats and dogs\\"). A similar effect is known as context priming. Context priming works by using a context to speed up processing for stimuli that are likely to occur in that context. A useful application of this effect is reading written text. The grammar and vocabulary of the sentence provide contextual clues for words that will occur later in the sentence. These later words are processed more quickly than if they had been read alone, and the effect is greater for more difficult or uncommon words. =Response priming= In the psychology of visual perception and motor control, the term response priming denotes a special form of visuomotor priming effect. The distinctive feature of response priming is that prime and target are presented in quick succession (typically, less than 100 milliseconds apart) and are coupled to identical or alternative motor responses. When a speeded motor response is performed to classify the target stimulus, a prime immediately preceding the target can thus induce response conflicts when assigned to a different response as the target. These response conflicts have observable effects on motor behavior, leading to priming effects, e.g., in response times and error rates. A special property of response priming is its independence from visual awareness of the prime: For example, response priming effects can increase under conditions where visual awareness of the prime is decreasing.Vorberg, D., Mattler, U., Heinecke, A., Schmidt, T., & Schwarzbach, J. Different time courses for visual perception and action priming. In: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 100, 2003, p. 6275-6280.Schmidt, T., & Vorberg, D. Criteria for unconscious cognition: Three types of dissociation. In: Perception & Psychophysics, 68, 2006, p. 489-504. =Masked priming= The masked priming paradigm has been widely used in the last two decades in order to investigate both orthographic and phonological activations during visual word recognition. The term \\"masked\\" refers to the fact that the prime word or pseudoword is masked by symbols such as ###### that can be presented in a forward manner (before the prime) or a backward manner (after the prime). These masks enable to diminish the visibility of the prime. The prime is usually presented less than 80 ms (but typically between 40-60 ms) in this paradigm. In all, the short SOA (Stimuli Onset Asynchrony, i.e. the time delay between the onset of the mask and the prime) associated with the masking make the masked priming paradigm a good tool to investigate automatic and irrepressive activations during visual word recognition. Forster has argued that masked priming is a purer form of priming, as any conscious appreciation of the relationship between the prime and the target is effectively eliminated, and thus removes the subject's ability to use the prime strategically to make decisions. Results from numerous experiments show that certain forms of priming occur that are very difficult to occur with visible primes. One such example is form-priming, where the prime is similar to, but not identical to the target (e.g., nature- mature). =Kindness priming= Kindness priming is a specific form of priming that occurs when a subject experiences an act of kindness and subsequently experiences a lower threshold of activation when subsequently encountering positive stimuli. A unique feature of kindness priming is that it causes a temporarily increased resistance to negative stimuli in addition to the increased activation of positive associative networks.Carlson, Charlin, Norman, http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/55/2/211/, Positive mood and helping behavior: A test of six hypotheses, 1989 This form of priming is closely related to affect priming. = Affective priming = Affective or affect priming entails the evaluation of people, ideas, objects, goods, etc., not only based on the physical features of those things, but also on affective context. Most research and concepts about affective priming derive from the affective priming paradigm where people are asked to evaluate or respond to a stimuli following positive, neutral, or negative primes. Some research suggests that valence (positive vs. negative) has a stronger effect than arousal (low vs. high) on lexical-decision tasks. Affective priming might also be more diffuse and stronger when the prime barely enters conscious awareness. = Cultural priming = Cultural priming is a technique employed in the field of cross-cultural psychology and social psychology to understand how people interpret events and other concepts, like cultural frame switching and self- concept. For example, Hung and his associate display participants a different set of culture related images, like U.S. Capitol building vs Chinese temple, and then watch a clip of fish swimming ahead of a group of fishes. }} When exposed to the latter one, Hong Kong participants are more likely to reason in a collectivistic way. In contrast, their counterparts who view western images are more likely to give a reverse response and focus more on that individual fish. People from bi-culture society when primed with different cultural icons, they are inclined to make cultural activated attribution. One method is the Pronoun circling task, a type of cultural priming task, which involves asking participants to consciously circle pronouns like \\"We\\", \\"us\\", \\"I\\", and \\"me\\" during paragraph reading. = Anti-priming = Anti-priming is a measurable impairment in processing information owing to recent processing of other information when the representations of information overlap and compete. Strengthening one representation after its usage causes priming for that item but also anti-priming for some other, non-repeated items. For example, in one study, identification accuracy of old Chinese characters was significantly higher than baseline measurements (i.e., the priming effect), while identification accuracy of novel characters was significantly lower than baseline measurements (i.e., the antipriming effect). Anti-priming is said to be the natural antithesis of repetition priming, and it manifests when two objects share component features, thereby having overlapping representations. However, one study failed to find anti-priming effects in a picture-naming task even though repetition priming effects were observed. Researchers argue that anti-priming effects may not be observed in a small time-frame. Measuring the effects of priming Priming effects can be found with many of the tests of implicit memory. Tests such as the word-stem completion task, and the word fragment completion task measure perceptual priming. In the word-stem completion task, participants are given a list of study words, and then asked to complete word \\"stems\\" consisting of 3 letters with the first word that comes to mind. A priming effect is observed when participants complete stems with words on the study list more often than with novel words. The word fragment completion task is similar, but instead of being given the stem of a word, participants are given a word with some letters missing. The lexical decision task can be used to demonstrate conceptual priming. In this task, participants are asked to determine if a given string is a word or a nonword. Priming is demonstrated when participants are quicker to respond to words that have been primed with semantically-related words, e.g., faster to confirm \\"nurse\\" as a word when it is preceded by \\"doctor\\" than when it is preceded by \\"butter\\". Other evidence has been found through brain imaging and studies from brain injured patients. Another example of priming in healthcare research was studying if safety behaviors of nurses could be primed by structuring change of shift report. A pilot simulation study found that there is early evidence to show that safety behaviors can be primed by including safety language into report. Effects of brain injuries=Amnesia= Amnesic patients are described as those who have suffered damage to their medial temporal lobe, resulting in the impairment of explicit recollection of everyday facts and events. Priming studies on amnesic patients have varying results, depending on both the type of priming test done, as well as the phrasing of the instructions. Amnesic patients do as well on perceptual priming tasks as healthy patients, however they show some difficulties completing conceptual priming tasks, depending on the specific test. For example, they perform normally on category instance production tasks, but show impaired priming on any task that involves answering general knowledge questions. Phrasing of the instructions associated with the test has had a dramatic impact on an amnesic's ability to complete the task successfully. When performing a word- stem completion test, patients were able to successfully complete the task when asked to complete the stem using the first word that came to mind, but when explicitly asked to recall a word to complete the stem that was on the study list, patients performed at below-average levels. Overall, studies from amnesic patients indicate that priming is controlled by a brain system separate from the medial temporal system that supports explicit memory. =Aphasia= Perhaps the first use of semantic priming in neurological patients was with stroke patients with aphasia. In one study, patients with Wernicke's aphasia who were unable to make semantic judgments showed evidence of semantic priming, while patient with Broca's aphasia who were able to make semantic judgments showed less consistent priming than Wernicke's aphasics or normal controls (Milberg and Blumstein 1981). This dissociation was extended to other linguistic categories such phonology and syntactic processing by Blumstein, Milberg and their colleagues. =Dementia= Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, have been studied extensively as far as priming goes. Results are conflicting in some cases, but overall, AD patients show decreased priming effects on word-stem completion and free association tasks, while retaining normal performance on lexical decision tasks. These results suggest that AD patients are impaired in any sort of priming task that requires semantic processing of the stimuli, while priming tasks that require visuoperceptual interpretation of stimuli are unaffected by Alzheimers. =Focal cortical lesions= Patient J.P., who suffered a stroke in the left medial/temporal gyrus, resulting in auditory verbal agnosia ‚Äì the inability to comprehend spoken words, but maintaining the ability to read and write, and with no effects to hearing ability. J.P. showed normal perceptual priming, but his conceptual priming ability for spoken words was, expectedly, impaired. Another patient, N.G., who suffered from prosopanomia (the inability to retrieve proper names) following damage to his left temporal lobe, was unable to spontaneously provide names of persons or cities, but was able to successfully complete a word-fragment completion exercise following priming with these names. This demonstrated intact perceptual priming abilities. Cognitive neuroscience=Perceptual priming= The extrastriate cortex (shown in orange and red) is believed to be involved in perceptual priming Priming while improving performance decreases neural processing in the cerebral cortex of sensory stimuli with stimulus repetition. This has been found in single-cell recordings and in electroencephalography (EEG) upon gamma waves, with PET and functional MRI. This reduction is due to representational sharpening in the early sensory areas which reduces the number of neurons representing the stimulus. This leads to a more selective activation of neurons representing objects in higher cognitive areas. =Conceptual priming= Conceptual priming has been linked to reduced blood flow in the left prefrontal cortex. The left prefrontal cortex is believed to be involved in the semantic processing of words, among other tasks. The view that perceptual priming is controlled by the extrastriate cortex while conceptual priming is controlled by the left prefrontal cortex is undoubtedly an oversimplified view of the process, and current work is focused on elucidating the brain regions involved in priming in more detail. In daily life Priming is thought to play a large part in the systems of stereotyping. This is because attention to a response increases the frequency of that response, even if the attended response is undesired. (see Ironic process theory for a more in-depth discussion of this phenomenon) The attention given to these response or behaviors primes them for later activation. Another way to explain this process is automaticity. If trait descriptions, for instance \\"stupid\\" or \\"friendly\\", have been frequently or recently used, these descriptions can be automatically used to interpret someone's behavior. An individual is unaware of this, and this may lead to behavior that may not agree with their personal beliefs. This can occur even if the subject is not conscious of the priming stimulus. An example of this was done by Bargh et al. in 1996. Subjects were implicitly primed with words related to the stereotype of elderly people (example: Florida, forgetful, wrinkle). While the words did not explicitly mention speed or slowness, those who were primed with these words walked more slowly upon exiting the testing booth than those who were primed with neutral stimuli. Similar effects were found with rude and polite stimuli: those primed with rude words were more likely to interrupt an investigator than those primed with neutral words, and those primed with polite words were the least likely to interrupt. A Yale study showed that something as simple as holding a hot or cold beverage before an interview could result in pleasant or negative opinion of the interviewer. These findings have been extended to therapeutic interventions. For example, Cox et al. (2012) suggest that presented with a depressed patient who \\"self- stereotypes herself as incompetent, a therapist can find ways to prime her with specific situations in which she had been competent in the past... Making memories of her competence more salient should reduce her self-stereotype of incompetence.\\" The replicability and interpretation of goal-priming findings has become controversial.B. Bower. (2012). The hot and cold of priming: Psychologists are divided on whether unnoticed cues can influence behavior. Science News, 181, The Hot and Cold of Priming Recent studies have failed to replicate findings, including age priming, with additional reports of failure to replicate this and other findings such as social-distance also reported.PsychFileDrawer, (2013). Replicability of Social and goal priming findings. Priming is often considered to play a part in the success of sensory branding of products and connected to ideas like crossmodal correspondencies and sensation transference. Known effects are e.g. consumers perceiving lemonade suddenly as sweeter when the logo of the drink is more saturated towards yellow. Although semantic, associative, and form priming are well established, some longer-term priming effects were not replicated in further studies, casting doubt on their effectiveness or even existence. Nobel laureate and psychologist Daniel Kahneman has called on priming researchers to check the robustness of their findings in an open letter to the community, claiming that priming has become a \\"poster child for doubts about the integrity of psychological research.\\" Other critics have asserted that priming studies suffer from major publication bias, experimenter effect and that criticism of the field is not dealt with constructively.

(2008). Emotional valence influences the neural correlates associated with remembering and knowing. Cognition, affective & behavioural neuroscience, 8(2), 143-152. It appears that \\"remembering\\" and \\"knowing\\" represent relatively different characteristics of memory as well as reflect different ways of using memory. To remember is the conscious recollection of many vivid contextual details, such as \\"when\\" and \\"how\\" the information was learned. Remembering utilizes episodic memory and requires a deeper level of processing (e.g. undivided attention) than knowing. Errors in recollection may be due to source-monitoring errors that prevent an individual from remembering where exactly a piece of information was received. On the other hand, source monitoring may be very effective in aiding the retrieval of episodic memories. Remembering is a knowledge-based and conceptually-driven form of processing that can be influenced by many things. It is relevant to note that under this view both kinds of judgments are characteristics of individuals and thus any distinctions between the two are correlational, not causal, events. To know is a feeling (unconscious) of familiarity. It is the sensation that the item has been seen before, but not being able to pin down the reason why. Knowing simply reflects the familiarity of an item without recollection. Knowing utilizes semantic memory that requires perceptually based, data-driven processing. Knowing is the result of shallow maintenance rehearsal that can be influenced by many of the same aspects as semantic memory. Remember and know responses are quite often differentiated by their functional correlates in specific areas in the brain. For instance, during \\"remember\\" situations it is found that there is greater EEG activity than \\"knowing\\", specifically, due to an interaction between frontal and posterior regions of the brain.Gardiner, J.M., Gregg, V.H., Karayianni, I. (2006). Recognition memory and awareness: occurrence of perceptual effects in remembering or in knowing depends on concscious resources at encoding, but not at retrieval. Memory & cognition, 34(2), 227-239. It is also found that the hippocampus is differently activated during recall of \\"remembered\\" (vs. familiar) stimuli.Eldridge, L. L., Knowlton, B. J., Furmanski, C. S., Bookheimer, S. Y., & Engel, S. A. (2000). Remembering episodes: A selective role for the hippocampus during retrieval. Nature Neuroscience, 3. 1149‚Äì1152. On the other hand, items that are only \\"known\\", or seem familiar, are associated with activity in the rhinal cortex. Origins The remember-know paradigm began its journey in 1985 from the mind of Endel Tulving. He suggested that there are only two ways in which an individual can access their past. For instance, we can recall what we did last night by simply traveling back in time through memory and episodically imagining what we did (remember) or we can know something about our past such as a phone number, but have no specific memory of where the specific memory came from (know).Tulving, E. (1999). Memory, Consciousness, and the Brain: The Tallinn Conference. (pp. 66-68). Psychology Press. Recollection is based on the episodic memory system, and familiarity is based on the semantic memory system. Tulving argued that the remember-know paradigm could be applied to all aspects of recollection. In 1988 the application of the paradigm was refined to a set of instructions that could elicit reliable judgments from subjects that can be found using many variables. The remember-know paradigm has changed the way in which researchers can study memory tasks and has had implications on what were originally considered purely \\"episodic\\" memories, which can now be thought of as a combination of both remembering and knowing or episodic and semantic. Possible theories Remembering and knowing have been linked to dual-component theories, as well as unitary trace-strength/signal detection models. =Tulving's theory= Episodic and semantic memory give rise to two different states of consciousness, autonoetic and noetic, which influence two kinds of subjective experience, remembering and knowing, respectively. Autonoetic consciousness refers to the ability of recovering the episode in which an item originally occurred. In noetic consciousness, an item is familiar but the episode in which it was first encountered is absent and cannot be recollected. Remembering involves retrieval from episodic memory and knowing involves retrieval from semantic memory. In his SPI model, Tulving stated that encoding into episodic and semantic memory is serial, storage is parallel, and retrieval is independent. By this model, events are first encoded in semantic memory before being encoded in episodic memory; thus, both systems may have an influence on the recognition of the event. =High threshold model= The original high-threshold model held that recognition is a probabilistic process. It is assumed that there is some probability that previously studied items will exceed a memory threshold. If an item exceeds the threshold then it is in a discrete memory state. If an item does not exceed the threshold then it is not remembered, but it may still be endorsed as old on the basis of a random guess. According to this model, a test item is either recognized (i.e., it falls above a threshold) or it is not (i.e., it falls below a threshold), with no degrees of recognition occurring between these extremes. Only target items can generate an above-threshold recognition response because only they appeared on the list. The lures, along with any targets that are forgotten, fall below threshold, which means that they generate no memory signal whatsoever. For these items, the participant has the option of declaring them to be new (as a conservative participant might do) or guessing that some of them are old (as a more liberal participant might do). False alarms in this model reflect memory-free guesses that are made to some of the lures. This simple and intuitively appealing model yields the once widely used correction for guessing formula, and it predicts a linear receiver operating characteristic (ROC). An ROC is simply a plot of the hit rate versus the false alarm rate for different levels of bias. A typical ROC is obtained by asking participants to supply confidence ratings for their recognition memory decisions. Several pairs of hit and false alarm rates can then be computed by accumulating ratings from different points on the confidence scale (beginning with the most confident responses). The high-threshold model of recognition memory predicts that a plot of the hit rate versus the false alarm rate (i.e., the ROC) will be linear it also predicts that the z-ROC will be curvilinear. =Dual-process accounts= The dual-process account states that recognition decisions are based on the processes of recollection and familiarity.Wixted, J.T. (2007). Dual-Process Theory and Signal-Detection Theory of Recognition Memory. Psychological Review, 114(1), 152-176. Recollection is a conscious, effortful process in which specific details of the context in which an item was encountered are retrieved. Familiarity is a relatively fast, automatic process in which one gets the feeling the item has been encountered before, but the context in which it was encountered is not retrieved. According to this view, remember responses reflect recollections of past experiences and know responses are associated with recognition on the basis of familiarity. =Signal-detection theory= According to this theory, recognition decisions are based on the strength of a memory trace in reference to a certain decision threshold. A memory that exceeds this threshold is perceived as old, and trace that does not exceed the threshold is perceived as new. According to this theory, remember and know responses are products of different degrees of memory strength. There are two criteria on a decision axis; a point low on the axis is associated with a know decision, and a point high on the axis is associated with a remember decision. If memory strength is high, individuals make a \\"remember\\" response, and if memory strength is low, individuals make a \\"know\\" response. Probably the strongest support for the use of signal detection theory in recognition memory came from the analysis of ROCs. An ROC is the function that relates the proportion of correct recognitions (hit rate) to the proportion of incorrect recognitions (false- alarm rate). Signal-detection theory assumed a preeminent position in the field of recognition memory in large part because its predictions about the shape of the ROC were almost always shown to be more accurate than the predictions of the intuitively plausible high-threshold model. More specifically, the signal-detection model, which assumes that memory strength is a graded phenomenon (not a discrete, probabilistic phenomenon) predicts that the ROC will be curvilinear, and because every recognition memory ROC analyzed between 1958 and 1997 was curvilinear, the high-threshold model was abandoned in favor of signal-detection theory. Although signal-detection theory predicts a curvilinear ROC when the hit rate is plotted against the false alarm rate, it predicts a linear ROC when the hit and false alarm rates are converted to z scores (yielding a z-ROC). ‚ÄúThe predictive power of the signal detection modem seems to rely on know responses being related to transient feelings of familiarity without conscious recollection, rather than Tulving‚Äôs (1985) original definition of know awareness. =Dual-process signal-detection/high-threshold theory= The dual-process signal- detection/high-threshold theory tries to reconcile dual-process theory and signal-detection theory into one main theory. This theory states that recollection is governed by a threshold process, while familiarity is not. Recollection is a high-threshold process (i.e., recollection either occurs or does not occur), whereas familiarity is a continuous variable that is governed by an equal-variance detection model. On a recognition test, item recognition is based on recollection if the target item has exceeded threshold, producing an \\"old\\" response. If the target item does not reach threshold, the individual must make an item recognition decision based on familiarity. According to this theory, an individual makes a \\"remember\\" response when recollection has occurred. A know response is made when recollection has not occurred, and the individual must decide whether they recognize the target item solely on familiarity. Thus, in this model, the participant is thought to resort to familiarity as a backup process whenever recollection fails to occur. =Distinctiveness/fluency model= In the past, it was suggested that remembering is associated with conceptual processing and knowing is associated with perceptual processing. However, recent studies have reported that there are some conceptual factors that influence knowing and some perceptual factors that influence remembering. Findings suggest that regardless of perceptual or conceptual factors, distinctiveness of processing at encoding is what affects remembering, and fluency of processing is what affects knowing. Remembering is associated with distinctiveness because it is seen as an effortful, consciously controlled process. Knowing, on the other hand, depends on fluency as it is more automatic and reflexive and requires much less effort. Influences on remembering and knowing=Factors that influence remember responses but not know responses are=Frequency Items of low- frequency are generally better recognized and receive more remember responses than high-frequency items.Jones, T.D., & Roediger, H.L. (1995). The experiential basis of serial position effects. European Journal of Cognitive Psychology, 7(1), 65-80. In a study, 96 words consisting of 48 low-frequency words and 48 high-frequency words were chosen by a psycholinguistic database.Gardiner, J.M. & Java, R.I. (1990). Recollective experience in word and nonword recognition. Memory & Cognition, 18(1), 23-30. There were two alternate study lists, each consisting of 24 low-frequency words and 24 high- frequency words. Half of the subjects received one study list, while the other half of the participants received the other. The recognition test, which involved all 96 words, required participants to first acknowledge whether the target item was old or new; if the item was considered old, participants were further asked to distinguish whether the item was remembered (they could recollect the context in which it had been studied) or known (the item seemed familiar but they couldn't recollect contextual details). The results of this experiment were that low-frequency words received many more remember responses than high-frequency words. Since remember words are affected by distinctiveness, this makes sense; low-frequency words are experienced less than high-frequency words which makes them more distinctive. Also, there seemed to be no significant difference in the number of know responses made for low-frequency words and high-frequency words. Generation effects Items which are generated by a person receive more remember responses than items which are read, seen, or heard by a person. In addition, the generation of images to words enhances remember responses.Knott, L.M. & Dewhurst, S.A. (2007). Divided attention at retrieval disrupts knowing but not remembering. Memory, 15(6), 664-674. In one study, all participants were asked to study a list of 24 common pairs of opposites, 12 had to be generated and 12 were read.Gardiner, J.M. (1988). Functional aspects of recollective experience. Memory & Cognition, 16(4), 309-313. The generated pairs required participants to generate them in the context of a given rule. The recognition test consisted of 48 words, 24 targets and 24 distractors. Participants were asked if items were old or new; if participants replied \\"old\\", they were then asked whether they remembered (could recollect contextual details of when it was studied) the pair or if they knew (recognized it but recollection was absent) the pair. Generation effects were seen in remember responses; items which were generated received more remember responses than read items. However, generation effects were not seen in know responses. Divided attention Remember responses depend on the amount of attention available during learning. Divided attention at learning has a negative impact on remember responses.Gardiner, J.M., & Parkin, A.J. (1990). Attention and recollective experience in recognition memory. Memory & Cognition, 18(6), 579-583. A study was done which consisted of 72 target words which were divided into two study lists. Half of the participants were required to study the list in an undivided attention condition and half of the subjects studied the list in a divided attention condition. In the divided attention condition, subjects had to study the list while listening to and reporting high, low, or medium tone sequences. The recognition test consisted of participants deciding whether items were old or new; if items were deemed old, participants were then required to say whether items were remembered or known. It was found that the divided attention condition impaired the level of correct remember responses; however, the know responses seemed unaffected. Depth of processing When more detailed, elaborate encoding and associations are made, more remember responses are reported than know responses.Mantyla, T. (1993). Knowing but not remembering: Adult age differences in recollective experience. Memory & Cognition, 21(3), 379. The opposite occurs with shallow, surface encoding which results in fewer remember responses. Serial position The primacy effect is related to enhanced remembering. In a study, a free recall test was conducted on some lists of words and no test on other lists of words prior to a recognition test. They found that testing led to positive recency effects for remembered items; on the other hand, with no prior test, negative recency effects occurred for remembered items. Thus, both primary and recency effects can be seen in remember responses. =Factors that influence know responses but not remember responses are=Masked recognition priming Masked recognition priming is a manipulation which is known to increase perceptual fluency. Since know responses increase with increased fluency of processing, masked recognition priming enhances know responses.Rajaram, S. & Geraci, L. (2000). Conceptual fluency selectively influences knowing. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 26(4), 1070-1074. Repetition priming Briefly presenting a prime prior to test causes an increase in fluency of processing and an associated increase in feeling of familiarity. Short duration primes tend to enhance know responses. In contrast to briefly presented primes, primes which are presented for long durations are said to disrupt processing fluency as the prime saturates the representation of the target word.Huber, D.E., Clark, T.F., Curran, T., Winkielman, P. (2008). Effects of repetition priming on recognition memory: testing a perceptual fluency-disfluency model. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 34(6), 1305-1324. Thus, longer duration primes tend to have a negative impact on know responses. Stimulus modality Know responses are enhanced when stimuli modality match during study and test; therefore, shifting the modality of a stimulus has been found to negatively impact know responses. =Factors that influence both remember and know responses are=Perceptual fluency tests Knowing is influenced by the fluency in which an item is processed, regardless of whether information is conceptual or perceptual. Know responses are enhanced by manipulations which increase perceptual and conceptual fluency. For example, masked repetition priming, modality match during study and test, and the use of easy word-fragments in word-fragment recall are all perceptual manipulations which increase know responses. An example of a conceptual manipulation which enhances know responses is when a prime item is semantically related to a target item. Manipulations which increase processing fluency do not seem to affect remember responses. Aging Normal aging tends to disrupt remember responses to a greater extent than know responses. This decrease in remember responses is associated with poor encoding and frontal lobe dysfunction.Yonelinas, A.P. (2002). The Nature of Recollection and Familiarity: A Review of 30 Years of Research. Journal of Memory and Language, 46(3), 441-517. It has been found that older individuals fail to use elaborative encoding in comparison to younger individuals. In addition to poor encoding, older individuals tend to have problems with retrieving information that is highly specific because they are less effective at controlling their retrieval processes.Luo, L. & Craik, F.I.M. (2009). Age differences in recollection: specificity effects at retrieval. Journal of Memory and Language, 60, 421-436. It is difficult for older individuals to constrain retrieval processes to the context of the specific item that is to be retrieved. Word vs. non-word memory When words are used as stimuli, more remember responses and fewer know responses are produced in comparison to when nonwords are used as stimuli. Gradual vs. rapid presentation Gradual presentation of stimuli causes an increase in familiarity and thus an increase in associated know responses; however, gradual presentation causes a decrease in remember responses.LeCompte, D.C. (1995). Recollective experience in the revelation effect: Separating the contributions of recollection and familiarity. Memory & Cognition, 23(3), 324-334. =Role of emotion= The amygdala plays an important role during encoding and retrieval of emotional information. It has been found that although negative and positive items are remembered or known to the same extent, the processes involved in remembering and knowing differs with emotional valence. Remembering Activity in the orbitofrontal and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex are associated with remembering for both positive and negative items. When it comes to remembering, it has been suggested that negative items may be remembered with more detail in comparison to positive or neutral items; support for this has been found in the temporo-occipital regions, which showed activity specific to negative items that were \\"remembered\\". A study found that in addition to being remembered in more detail, negative items also tended to be remembered for longer durations than positive items. Knowing Activity in the mid- cingulate gyrus, the inferior parietal lobe, and the superior frontal lobe are all associated with knowing for both positive and negative items. These regions are said to be involved in the retrieval of both semantic and episodic information. It has been suggested that the encoding of items which people forget details for or items which are forgotten as a whole are associated with these regions. This forgetting has to do with retrieval-related processes being active at the same time as encoding-related processes. Thus, the process of retrieval may come at the expense of encoding vivid details of the item. In addition, disproportionate activity along the cingulate gyrus, within the parietal lobe, and in the prefrontal cortex is associated with the encoding of \\"known\\" positive items. This increased activity may cause the trade-off between retrieval-related processes and encoding-related processes to occur more significantly for positive items. This supports the idea that when people are in a positive mood, they have a more holistic, general thought process and disregard details. =Role of context= The functional account of remembering states that remember responses are determined by the context in which they're made; in general, recollection is based on the type of info that was encouraged by the deeper level processing task.McCabe, D.P., Balota, D.A. (2007). Context effects on remembering and knowing: the expectancy heuristic. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 33(3), 536-549. Remember responses occur when retrieved information allow subjects to finish a memory test. The same item may elicit a remember response or a know response, depending on the context in which it is found. In the expectancy heuristic, items that reach beyond a level of distinctiveness (the likelihood an item would later be recognized in a recognition test) elicit a remember response. Items that do not reach this level of distinctiveness elicit a know response. The level of distinctiveness is determined by the context in which items are studied and/or tested. In a given context, there is an expected level of distinctiveness; in contexts where subjects expect many distinct items, participants give fewer remember responses than when they expect few distinct items. Therefore, remember responses are affected by the expected strength of distinctiveness of items in a given context. In addition, context can affect remember and know responses while not affecting recollection and familiarity processes. Remember and know responses are subjective decisions that can be affected by underlying memory processes. While changing recollection and familiarity processes can influence remember and know judgments, context can affect how items are weighted for remember-know decisions. According to the distinctiveness-fluency model, items are seen as distinct when they exceed a level of memorability and items are seen as fluent when they do not reach this level but give a feeling of familiarity. Distinct items are usually unusual in comparison to the context in which they're found. Therefore, distinct items generally elicit a remember response, and fluent items elicit a know response. Testing methods and models=Judgments and retrieval of contextual details= In this study, the presence of source memory was utilized to estimate the extent to which episodic details were recalled; feelings of familiarity were accompanied by retrieval of partial contextual details, which are considered sufficient for an accurate source decision but not for a recollection response.Dudukovic, N.M., Knowlton, B.J. (2005). Remember-Know Judgments and Retrieval of Contextual Details. Acta Psychologica, 122(2), 160-173 Subjects that remembered the stimuli were able to differentiate the corresponding source correctly. The findings were consistent with the idea that \\"remember\\" responses, unlike \\"know\\" responses, are accompanied by memory for episodic detail, and that the loss of memory for episodic detail over time parallels the conversion of \\"remember\\" responses to \\"know\\" responses. =Yes/no recognition models= In the preceding task, participants are given a list of items to study in the primary learning phase. Subsequently, during the recognition stage, participants are asked to make a decision about whether presented test items existed in the previously studied list. If the participant responds \\"yes\\", they are asked why they recognized the specified item. From this, a conclusion was obtained based on whether the item was remembered or simply known. =Eye movement method= Primarily, experimenters recorded eye movements while participants studied a series of photos. Individuals were then involved in a recognition task in which their eye movements were recorded for the second time. From the previous tasks, it was discovered that eye fixations, maintaining a visual gaze on a single location, were more clustered for remembering rather than knowing tasks. This suggests that remembering is associated with encoding a specific salient component of an item whereas recognition is activated by an augmented memory for this part of the stimulus.Sharot, T., Davidson, M.L., Carson, M.M., Phelps, E.A. (2008). Eye movements predict recollective experience. PLoS ONE, 3(8), e2884. =Decision processes in a remember and know model= In the above experiment, participants were presented with a list of 100 familiar words and were asked to read them aloud while simultaneously trying to remember each one. Subsequent to this, participants were asked to make a recognition decision based on the number of \\"yes\\" responses that were accompanied by some recollective experience.Donaldson, W. (1996). The Role of Decision Processes in Remembering and Knowing. Memory and Cognition, 24, 523-533 The results demonstrate the differing relationships between the \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\" conditions and \\"remember\\" and \\"know\\" memory performance. The outcome confirms that although familiarity and recollection may involve different processes, the remember/know exemplar does not probe them directly. =Remember-know models as decision strategies in two experimental paradigms= In the previous study, two different remember-know paradigms are explored. The first is the \\"remember-first method\\"Rotello, C.M., Macmillan, N.A. (2006). Remember-Know Models as Decision Strategies in Two Experimental Paradigms. Journal of Memory and Language, 55(4), 479-494. in which a remember response is solicited prior to a know response for non-remembered items. Secondly, a trinary paradigm, in which a single response judges the \\"remember vs. know\\" and \\"new\\" alternatives is investigated. Participants are asked to subjectively decide whether their response within these studies is attributed to a recollection of specific details, \\"remembering\\", or familiarity \\"knowing\\". In the presently discussed experiment, \\"remember\\" and \\"know\\" responses generally depend on a single strength variable. =Multinomial memory model= Remembering (recollection) accesses memory for separate contextual details (e.g. screen location and font size); i.e. involves retrieval of a particular context configuration.Meiser, T., & Br√∂der, A. (2002). Memory for multidimensional source information. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 28, 116-137. =Signal detection model= This model uses the idea that remembering and knowing each represent different levels of confidence. In this sense remember/know judgments are viewed as quantitatively different judgments that vary along the same continuum. Subjects place their \\"know\\" and \\"remember\\" judgments on a continuum of strength.Zelazo, P. D., Moscovitch, M., & Evan, T. (2007). The Cambridge Handbook of Consciousness. New York: Cambridge University Press. When people are very confident about recognizing an item, they assign it a \\"remember\\" response, and when they are less confident about a response it is labelled as a \\"know\\" response. A potential problem with this model is that it lacks explanatory power; it may be difficult to determine where the criteria should be placed on the continuum. Role in understanding psychological disorders The remember-know paradigm has had great usage in clinical studies. Using this paradigm, researchers can look into the mechanisms of neuro-biological functions as well as social aspects of disorders and illnesses that plague humans. Recognition memory has been linked to advancements in the understanding of schizophrenia, epilepsy and even explaining simple autobiographical memory loss as we grow older. =Epilepsy= The remember-know paradigm has been used to settle the debate over whether the hippocampus plays a critical role in familiarity of objects. Studies done with patients suffering from epilepsy suggest that the hippocampus plays a critical role in the familiarity of objects.Bengner, T., & Malina, T. (2008). Remembering versus knowing during face recognition in unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy patients with or without hippocampal sclerosis. Brain and Cognition, 68(2), 148-156. A study was conducted using the remember-know distinction to understand this idea of familiarity and whether it is in fact the hippocampus that plays this critical role. This study found that the hippocampus is essentially a system based on familiarity. The hippocampus actually suppresses any sort of arousal response that would normally occur if the stimuli were novel. It is almost as though familiarity is a qualitative characteristic just as is colour or loudness. The remember- know paradigm with epilepsy patients to distinguish whether a stimulus (picture of a face) was familiar. Patients that were found to have right temporal lobe epilepsy showed relatively lower face recognition response than those with left temporal lobe epilepsy due to damage of secondary sensory regions (including fusiform gyrus) in the brain's right hemisphere, which is responsible for perception and encoding (esp. face memory). =Schizophrenia= A remember-know paradigm was used to test whether patients with schizophrenia would exhibit abnormalities in conscious recollection due to a deterioration of frontal memory processes that are involved in encoding/retrieval of memories as well as executive functions linked to reality monitoring and decision making.Drakeford, J. L., Edelstyn, N. M., Oyebode, F., Srivastava, S., Calthorpe, W. R., & Mukherjee, T. (2006). Auditory recognition memory, conscious recollection, and executive function in patients with schizophrenia. Psychopathology, 39(4), 199-208. Using the \\"remember-know\\" paradigm, participants first identify stimuli that they previously studied. If an item is identified as a known stimulus, the participants are asked to distinguish whether they can remember aspects of the original presentation of the identified item (remember response) or whether they know that the item was on the study list, but have no episodic memory of specifically learning it. Results showed that patients with schizophrenia exhibit a deficit in conscious recollection for auditory stimuli. These findings, when considered together with remember/know data collected from the same set of patients for olfactory and visual recognition memory,Drakeford J, Edelstyn NM, Oyebode F, Srivastava S, Mukherjee T: Contextual recollection and olfactory recognition memory in schizophrenia. Royal College of Psychiatrists Annual General Meeting, Edinburgh 2003.Edelstyn N.M., Drakeford J., Oyebode F., Findlay C.D. (2003). An investigation of conscious recollection, false recognition and delusional misidentify cation in patients with schizophrenia. Psychopathology, 36, 312‚Äì319. support proposals that the abnormalities in conscious recollection stem from a breakdown in central processes rather than domain-specific processes. This study depended greatly on the remember-know paradigm to test for conscious recollection differences in these patients. =Autobiographical memory loss= The remember-know paradigm has been used in studies that focus on the idea of a reminiscence bump and the age effects on autobiographical memory. Previous studies suggested old people had more \\"know\\" than \\"remember\\" and it was also found that younger individuals often excelled in the \\"remember\\" category but lacked in the \\"know\\".Rybash, J. (1999). Aging and the Autobiographical Memory: The Long and Bumpy Road. Journal of Adult Development, 1-10. A specific study used the remember-know paradigm while asking elderly people about their episodic memories from their university graduation. They were asked to determine whether their self reported memories were \\"remembered\\" or \\"known\\". It was hypothesized that reminiscence component of elderly adults' autobiographical recall would be strong for \\"remember\\" responses, but less so for \\"know\\" responses. It was also expected that recent memories would hold the opposite effect, that those individuals would be better at \\"know\\" responses than with \\"remember\\" responses. Results showed that there was good retention after reminiscence bump and equal \\"remember\\" to \\"know\\" responses were reported. It was concluded that autobiographical memories were tied to both episodic and semantic memories. These results are important to demonstrate that aging is not accompanied by a decline in episodic memory due to a reliance on semantic memory as previously thought. The remember-know distinction was integral in achieving these results as well as understanding the ways in which autobiographical memory works and the prevalence of the reminiscence bump. The findings of Rybash are supported by other research.Janssen, S. M. J., Rubin, D. C., & St. Jacques, P. L. (2011). The temporal distribution of autobiographical memory: Changes in reliving and vividness over the life span do not explain the reminiscence bump. Memory & Cognition, 39, 1-11. Related phenomena=Tip-of-the-tongue= The tip-of- the-tongue state is the phenomenon that occurs when people fail to recall information but still feel as if they are close to retrieving it from memory. In this sense an individual feels as if they \\"know\\" but cannot \\"remember\\" the actual information desired. It is a frustrating but common problem that typically occurs for individuals about once a week, is frequent among nouns and is typically resolved on its own.Rastle, K. (1996). Priming the tip of the tongue: effects of prior processing on word retrieval in young and older adults. Journal of Memory and Language, 35(4), 585. The occurrence of the tip- of-the-tongue state increases with age throughout adulthood.Shafto, M. A., Burke, D. M., Stamatakis, E. A., Tam, P. P., & Tyler, L. K. (2007). On the tip-of-the-tongue: neural correlates of increased word-finding failures in normal aging. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 2060-2070. Such a feeling is indication that remembering will occur or is about to occur. =Knew-it-all- along effect= The knew-it-all-along effect is a variant of the hindsight bias. It is the tendency for people to misremember and think that they knew more in the past than they actually did.Arnold, M. (2007). \\"I remember/know/guess that I knew it all along!\\": subjective experience versus objective measures of the knew-it-all-along effect. Memory Cognition, 35(8), 1854. In such situations it is difficult for us to remember what it was like when we did not have an understanding of something. For example, one might have a hard time teaching a concept to another individual because they can not remember what it is like to not understand the material. =Hindsight bias= Hindsight bias is the phenomenon where people tend to view events as more predictable than they really are. This occurs because one's current knowledge influences the recollection of previous beliefs.Bernstein, D. (2007). Hindsight bias and developing theories of mind. Child Development, 78(4), 1374. In this phenomenon, what someone \\"knows\\" is affecting what they \\"remember\\". This inaccurate assessment of reality after it has occurred is also referred to as \\"creeping determinism\\". The hindsight bias has been found among a number of domains such as historical events, political elections and the outcome of sporting events.Nestler, S., Blank, H., & Von Collani, G. (2008). Hindsight bias does not always come easy: casual models, cognitive effort and creeping determinism. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 1043-1054. The hindsight bias is a common phenomenon that occurs regularly among individuals in everyday life and can be generated in a laboratory setting to help increase the understanding of memory and specifically memory distortions.

Subcortical structures= Hippocampus = The thumb The hippocampus is a structure in the brain that has been associated with various memory functions. It is part of the limbic system, and lies next to the medial temporal lobe. It is made up of two structures, the Ammon's Horn, and the Dentate gyrus, each containing different types of cells.  Cognitive maps  There is evidence that the hippocampus contains cognitive maps in humans. In one study, single-cell recordings were taken from electrodes implanted in a rat's hippocampus, and it was found that certain neurons responded strongly only when the rat was in certain locations. These cells are called place cells, and collections of these cells can be considered to be mental maps. Individual place cells do not only respond to one unique area only however, the patterns of activation of these cells overlap to form layered mental maps within the hippocampus. A good analogy is the example of the same television or computer screen pixels being used to light up any trillions of possible combinations to produce images, just as the place cells can be used in any multiple possible combinations to represent mental maps. The hippocampus' right side is more oriented towards responding to spatial aspects, whereas the left side is associated with other context information. Also, there is evidence that experience in building extensive mental maps, such as driving a city taxi for a long time (since this requires considerable memorization of routes), can increase the volume of one's hippocampus.  Encoding  Damage to the hippocampus and surrounding area can cause anterograde amnesia, the inability to form new memories. This implies that the hippocampus is important not only for storing cognitive maps, but for encoding memories. The hippocampus is also involved in memory consolidation, the slow process by which memories are converted from short to long term memory. This is supported by studies in which lesions are applied to rat hippocampi at different times after learning. The process of consolidation may take up to a couple years. It has also been found that it is possible to form new semantic memories without the hippocampus, but not episodic memories, which means that explicit descriptions of actual events (episodic) cannot be learned, but some meaning and knowledge is gained from experiences (semantic). = Cerebellum = The thumb The cerebellum (\\"little brain\\") is a structure located at the rear of the brain, near the spinal cord. It looks like a miniature version of the cerebral cortex, in that it has a wavy, or convoluted surface. Unlike the hippocampus which is involved in the encoding of complex memories, the cerebellum plays a role in the learning of procedural memory, and motor learning, such as skills requiring co-ordination and fine motor control. An example of a skill requiring procedural memory would be playing a musical instrument, or driving a car or riding a bike. Individuals with transient global amnesia that have difficulty forming new memories and/or remembering old events may sometimes retain the ability to perform complex musical pieces, suggesting that procedural memory is completely dissociated from conscious memory, also known as explicit memory. This separation makes sense if the cerebellum, which is far removed from the hippocampus, is responsible for procedural learning. The cerebellum is more generally involved in motor learning, and damage to it can result in problems with movement, specifically it is considered to co-ordinate timing and accuracy of movements, and to make long-term changes (learning) to improve these skills. = Amygdala = The amygdala. Located above the hippocampus in the medial temporal lobes are two amygdalae (singular \\"amygdala\\"). The amygdalae are associated with both emotional learning and memory, as it responds strongly to emotional stimuli, especially fear. These neurons assist in encoding emotional memories and enhancing them. This process results in emotional events being more deeply and accurately encoded into memory. Lesions to the amygdalae in monkeys have been shown to impair motivation, as well as the processing of emotions.  Memory of fear conditioning  Pavlovian conditioning tests have shown the active role of the amygdala in fear conditioning in rats. Research involving lesions to the basolateral nucleus have shown a strong association with memories involving fear. The central nucleus is linked with the behavioral responses that are dependent on the basolateral's reaction to fear. The central nucleus of the amygdala is also linked to emotions and behaviors motivated by food and sex.  Memory consolidation  Emotional experiences and events are somewhat fragile and take a while to be completely set into memory. This slow process, referred to as consolidation, allows emotions to influence the way the memory is stored. The amygdala is involved in memory consolidation, which is the process of transferring information that is currently in working memory into ones long-term memory. This process is also known as memory modulation. The amygdala works to encode recent emotional information into memory. Memory research has shown that the greater ones emotional arousal level at the time of the event, the greater the chance that the event will be remembered. This may be due to the amygdala enhancing the emotional aspect of the information during encoding, causing the memory to be processed at a deeper level and therefore, more likely to withstand forgetting. = Basal ganglia and motor memory = Basal ganglia (red) and related structures (blue) The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei which are located in the medial temporal lobe, above the thalamus and connected to the cerebral cortex. Specifically, the basal ganglia includes the subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, the globus pallidus, the ventral striatum and the dorsal striatum, which consists of the putamen and the caudate nucleus. The basic functions of these nuclei deal with cognition, learning, and motor control and activities. The basal ganglia are also associated with learning, memory, and unconscious memory processes, such as motor skills and implicit memory. Particularly, one division within the ventral striatum, the nucleus accumbens core, is involved in the consolidation, retrieval and reconsolidation of drug memory. The caudate nucleus is thought to assist in learning and memory of associations taught during operant conditioning. Specifically, research has shown that this part of the basal ganglia plays a role in acquiring stimulus-response habits, as well as in solving sequence tasks. Damage to the basal ganglia has been linked to dysfunctional learning of motor and perceptual-motor skills. Most disorders that are associated with damage to these areas of the brain involve some type of motor dysfunction, as well as trouble with mental switching between tasks in working memory. Such symptoms are often present in those who suffer from dystonia, athymhormic syndrome, Fahr's syndrome, Huntington's disease or Parkinson's disease. Huntington's and Parkinson's disease involve both motor deficits and cognitive impairment.  Cortical structures  thumb = Frontal lobe = The frontal lobes are located at the front of each cerebral hemisphere and positioned anterior to the parietal lobes. It is separated from the parietal lobe by the primary motor cortex, which controls voluntary movements of specific body parts associated with the precentral gyrus.Kuypers, H. (1981). Anatomy of the descending pathways. V. Brooks, ed. The Nervous System, Handbook of Physiology, vol. 2. Baltimore: Williams and Wilkins. The cortex here serves our ability to plan the day, organize work, type a letter, pay attention to details and control the movements of your arms and legs. It also contributed to your personality and behaviour. When considering the frontal lobes in regards to memory, we see that it is very important in the coordination of information. Therefore, the frontal lobes are important in working memory. For example, when you are thinking about how to get to a mall you have never been to before, you combine various bits of knowledge you already have: the layout of the city the mall is in, information from a map, knowledge of traffic patterns in that area and conversations with your friends about the location of the mall. By actively using all of this information, you can determine the best route for you to take. This action involves the controlled use of information in working memory, coordinated by the frontal lobes. The frontal lobes help a person select out memories that are most relevant on a given occasion. It can coordinate various types of information into a coherent memory trace.Frankland P.W., Bontempi B. (2005). The organization of recent and remote memories. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 119‚Äì130. For example, the knowledge of the information itself, as well as knowing where information came from must be put together into a single memory representation; this is called source monitoring. Sometimes we experience situations where information becomes separated, such as when we recall something, but cannot remember where we remember it from; this is referred to as a source monitoring error. The frontal lobes are also involved in the ability to remember what we need to do in the future; this is called prospective memory.Winograd, E. (1988). Some observations on prospective remembering. In M. M. Gruneberg, P. E. Morris & R. N. Sykes (Eds.), Practical Aspects of Memory: Current Research and Issues. Vol. 2, pp. 348-353. = Temporal lobe = The temporal lobes are a region of the cerebral cortex that is located beneath the Sylvian fissure on both the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Lobes in this cortex are more closely associated with memory and in particular autobiographical memory. The temporal lobes are also concerned with recognition memory. This is the capacity to identify an item as one that was recently encountered. Recognition memory is widely viewed as consisting of two components, a familiarity component (i.e. Do I know this person waving at me?) and a recollective component (i.e. That is my friend Julia, from evolutionary psychology class). Damage to the temporal lobe can affect an individual in a litany of ways ranging from: disturbance of auditory sensation and perception, disturbance of selective attention of auditory and visual input, disorders of visual perception, impaired organization and categorization of verbal material, disturbance of language comprehension, and altered personality. In regard to memory, temporal lobe damage can impair long-term memory.Kolb, B., & Whishaw, I. (1990). Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology. W.H. Freeman and Co., New York. Thus, general semantic knowledge or more personal episodic memories of one's childhood could be affected. = Parietal lobe = The parietal lobe is located directly behind the central sulcus, superior to the occipital lobe and posterior to the frontal lobe, visually at the top of the back of the head.Blakemore & Frith (2005). The Learning Brain. Blackwell Publishing. The make up of the parietal lobe is defined by four anatomical boundaries in the brain, providing a division of all the four lobes. The parietal lobe has many functions and duties in the brain and its main functioning can be divided down into two main areas: (1) sensation and perception (2) constructing a spatial coordinate system to represent the world around us.Kandel, E., Schwartz, J., & Jessell, T. (1991). Principles of Neural Science. 3rd edition. New York: NY. Elsevier. The parietal lobe helps us to mediate attention when necessary and provides spatial awareness and navigational skills. Also, it integrates all of our sensory information (touch, sight, pain etc.) to form a single perception. Parietal lobe gives the ability to focus our attention on different stimuli at the same time, PET scans show high activity in the parietal lobe when participates being studied were asked to focus their attention at two separate areas of attention. Parietal lobe also assists with verbal short term memory and damage to the supramarginal gyrus cause short term memory loss.Cowan, Nelson. (2005). Working Memory Capacity. Psychology Press. New York. Damage to the parietal lobe results in the syndrome ‚Äòneglect' which is when patients treat part of their body or objects in their visual field as though it never existed. Damage to the left side of the parietal lobe can result in what is called Gerstmann syndrome. It includes right-left confusion, difficulty with writing (agraphia) and difficulty with mathematics (acalculia). It can also produce disorders of language (aphasia) and the inability to perceive objects. Damage to the right parietal lobe can result in neglecting part of the body or space (contralateral neglect), which can impair many self-care skills such as dressing and washing. Right side damage can also cause difficulty in making things (constructional apraxia), denial of deficits (anosognosia) and drawing ability. Neglect syndrome tends to be more prevalent on the right side of the parietal lobe, because the right mediates attention to both the left and right fields.Warrington, E., & Weiskrantz, L. (1973). An analysis of short-term and long-term memory defects in man. In J.A. Deutsch, ed. The Physiological Basis of Memory. New York: Academic Press. Damage in the somatic sensory cortex results in loss of perception of bodily sensations, namely sense of touch. = Occipital lobe = The occipital lobe is the smallest of all four lobes in the human cerebral cortex and located in the rearmost part of the skull and considered to be part of the forebrain.Westmoreland, B. et al. (1994). Medical Neurosciences: An Approach to Anatomy, Pathology, and Physiology by Systems and Levels. New York: NY. Little, Brown and Company. The occipital lobe sits directly above the cerebellum and is situated posterior to the Parieto- occipital sulcus, or parieto-occipital sulcus. This lobe is known as the centre of the visual perception system, the main function of the occipital lobe is that of vision. Retinal sensors send signals through the optic tract to the Lateral geniculate nucleus. Once the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus receives the information it is sent down the primary visual cortex where it is organized and sent down one of two possible path ways; dorsal or ventral stream. The ventral stream is responsible for object representation and recognition and is also commonly known as the \\"what\\" stream. The dorsal stream is responsible for guiding our actions and recognizing where objects are in space, commonly known as the \\"where\\" or \\"how\\" stream. Once in the information is organized and sent through the pathways it continues to the other areas of the brain responsible for visual processing. The most important function of the Occipital lobe is vision. Due to the positioning of this lobe at the back of the head it is not susceptible to much injury but any significant damage to the brain can cause a variety of damage to our visual perception system. Common problems in the occipital lobe are field defects and scotomas, movement and colour discrimination, hallucinations, illusions, inability to recognize words and inability to recognize movement. A study was done in which patients suffered from a tumour on the occipital lobe and the results shows that the most frequent consequence was contralateral damage to the visual field. When damage occurs in the occipital lobe it is most common to see the effects on the opposite side of the brain. Since the brain regions are so specialized in their functioning, damages done to specific areas of the brain can cause specific type of damage. Damage to the left side of the brain can lead to language discrepancies, i.e. difficulty in properly identifying letters, numbers and words, inability to incorporate visual stimuli to comprehend multiple ways an object can be found. Right side damage causes non-verbal problems, i.e. identifying geometric shapes, perception of figures and faces. In almost all regions of the brain left side damage leads to general language problems whereas right side damage leads to general perception and problem solving skills. = Damage to the cortex = Many studies of different disease and disorders that have symptoms of memory loss have provided reinforcing evidence to the study of the anatomy of the brain and which parts are more utilized in memory.  Frontotemporal lobar degeneration and memory  Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a common form of dementia due to the degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes. Studies have found significant decreases in the essential needs for proper functioning in these lobes. The autobiographical domain in memory is largely affected by this disease. In one study, FTLD patients were interviewed and asked to describe a significant event from five different periods of their lives. Using the interview and different methods of imaging, the experimenters hoped to find links between patterns of brain volume loss and performance in the interview. Through image processing, patterns of significant reduced parenchymal volumes that encompass the frontal and temporal lobes were found. Through comparison to a control group of patients it was found that parenchymal volumes increased during episodic recall, and decreased during semantic recall. The experimenters discussed that lifespan autobiographical episodic recall was largely damaged in FTLD patients and semantic autobiographical memory seemed to be spared.  Parkinson's disease and memory  Parkinson's disease involves both damage to the basal ganglia and certain memory dysfunctions, suggesting that the basal ganglia are involved in specific types of memory. Those who have this disease have problems with both their working memory and spatial memory.Montomery, P. Siverstein, P., et al. (1993). Spatial updating in Parkinson's disease, Brain and Cognition, 23, 113-126. Most people can instantly and easily use visual-spatial memory to remember locations and pictures, but a person with Parkinson's disease would find this difficult. He or she would also have trouble encoding this visual and spatial information into long-term memory. This suggests that the basal ganglia work in both encoding and recalling spatial information. People with Parkinson's disease display working memory impairment during sequence tasks and tasks involving events in time. They also have difficulty in knowing how to use their memory, such as when to change strategies or maintain a train of thought.

Procedural memory guides the processes we perform, and most frequently resides below the level of conscious awareness. When needed, procedural memories are automatically retrieved and utilized for execution of the integrated procedures involved in both cognitive and motor skills, from tying shoes, to reading, to flying an airplane. Procedural memories are accessed and used without the need for conscious control or attention. Procedural memory is created through procedural learning, or repeating a complex activity over and over again until all of the relevant neural systems work together to automatically produce the activity. Implicit procedural learning is essential for the development of any motor skill or cognitive activity. History The difference between procedural and declarative memory systems were first explored and understood with simple semantics. Psychologists and philosophers began writing about memory over two centuries ago. \\"Mechanical memory\\" was first noted in 1804 by Maine de Biran. William James, within his famous book: The Principles of Psychology (1890), suggested that there was a difference between memory and habit. Cognitive psychology disregarded the influence of learning on memory systems in its early years, and this greatly limited the research conducted in procedural learning up until the 20th century. The turn of the century brought a clearer understanding of the functions and structures involved in procedural memory acquisition, storage, and retrieval processes. McDougall (1923) first made the distinction between explicit and implicit memory. In the 1970s procedural and declarative knowledge was distinguished in literature on artificial intelligence. Studies in the 1970s divided and moved towards two areas of work: one focusing on animal studies and the other to amnesic patients. The first convincing experimental evidence for a dissociation between declarative memory (\\"knowing what\\") and non-declarative or procedural (\\"knowing how\\") memory was from Milner (1962), by demonstrating that a severely amnesic patient, Henry Molaison, formerly known as patient H.M., could learn a hand‚Äìeye coordination skill (mirror drawing) in the absence of any memory of having practiced the task before. Although this finding indicated that memory was not made up of a single system positioned in one place in the brain, at the time, others agreed that motor skills are likely a special case that represented a less cognitive form of memory. However, by refining and improving experimental measures, there has been extensive research using amnesic patients with varying locations and degrees of structural damage. Increased work with amnesic patients led to the finding that they were able to retain and learn tasks other than motor skills. However, these findings had shortcomings in how they were perceived as amnesic patients sometimes fell short on normal levels of performance and therefore amnesia was viewed as strictly a retrieval deficit. Further studies with amnesic patients found a larger domain of normally functioning memory for skill abilities. For example, using a mirror reading task, amnesic patients showed performance at a normal rate, even though they are unable to remember some of the words that they were reading. In the 1980s much was discovered about the anatomy physiology of the mechanisms involved in procedural memory. The cerebellum, hippocampus, neostriatum, and basal ganglia were identified as being involved in memory acquisition tasks.  Working memory  Models of working memory primarily focused on declarative until Oberauer suggested that declarative and procedural memory may be processed differently in working memory. The working memory model is thought to be divided into two subcomponents; one is responsible for declarative, while the other represents procedural memory. These two subsections are considered to be largely independent of each other. It has also been determined that the process for selection may be very similar in nature when considering either modality of working memory . Acquisition of skill The acquisition of skill requires practice. Merely repeating a task alone, however, does not ensure the acquisition of a skill. Skill acquisition is achieved when an observed behaviour has changed due to experience or practice. This is known as learning and is not directly observable.Zimbardo, P. G., and Gerring, R. J. (1999). Psychology and life. (15th ed.). New York: Longman. The information processing model, which incorporates this idea of experience, proposes that skills develop from the interaction of four components central to information processing. These components include: processing speed, the rate at which information is processed in our processing system; breadth of declarative knowledge, the size of an individual's factual information store; breadth of procedural skill, the ability to perform the actual skill; and processing capacity, synonymous with working memory. The processing capacity is of importance to procedural memory because through the process of proceduralization an individual stores procedural memory. This improves skill usage by linking environmental cues with appropriate responses. One model for understanding skill acquisition was proposed by Fitts (1954) and his colleagues. This model proposed the idea that learning was possible through the completion of various stages. The stages involved include: * Cognitive phaseFitts, P. M., Posner, M. I. (1967). Human Performance. Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole * Associative phase * Autonomous phase (also called the procedural phase) =Cognitive phase= A countless number of potential procedures At this point in Fitts' (1954) model of skill acquisition individuals come to understand what an observed skill is composed of. Attention at this point in the process is significant for the acquisition of skill. This process involves breaking down the desired skill to be learned into parts and understanding how these parts come together as a whole for the correct performance of the task. The way an individual organizes these parts is known as schemas. Schemas are important in directing the acquisition process and the way an individual comes to choose schemas is described by metacognition. =Associative phase= The associative phase of the Fitts (1954) model involves individuals repeated practice until patterns of responding emerge. At this part in the model, actions of the skill become learned (or automated) as ineffective actions are dropped. An individual's sensory system acquires the accurate spatial and symbolic data required for the completion of the skill. The ability to differentiate important from unimportant stimuli is crucial at this stage of the model. It is held that the greater the amount of important stimuli associated with a task, the longer it will take to complete this phase of the model. =Autonomous phase= This is the final phase in Fitts' (1954) model, and it involves perfecting skill acquisition. The ability to discriminate important from unimportant stimuli are made quicker and less thought process is required because the skill has become automated. Important to this phase of the model is experience and factual knowledge store for the observed skill. =Alternative view: the \\"predictive cycle\\"= Another model for understanding skill acquisition through procedural memory has been proposed by Tadlock (2005).Tadlock, D.: Read Right! Coaching Your Child to Excellence in Reading by Dee Tadlock, Ph.D. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2005 The model is significantly different from Fitts' 1954 view in that it does not require conscious understanding of a skill's components. Rather, the learner is only required to maintain in conscious awareness a concept of the desired end result. Tadlock has applied the view successfully to reading remediation (Scott et al., 2010Scott, C. et al.: Evaluation of Read Right in Omaha Middle and High Schools 2009‚Äì2010 by C. Scott, K. Nelsestuen, E. Autio, T. Deussen, M. Hanita). The stages involved include: * Attempt * Fail * Implicitly analyze the result * Implicitly decide how to change the next attempt so that success is achieved The stages are repeated over and over until the learner builds or remodels the neural network to guide an activity appropriately and accurately without conscious thought. The context for this view is similar to how physical therapy works to help brain-injured patients recover lost functions. The patient maintains the desired end result (e.g., control over hand movement) while making repeated attempts, without conscious awareness of the neural activity required to make the hand move. The patient continues to make attempts until movement is achieved. In the case of brain injury, how much progress is made depends upon the extent of the injury and the \\"mental force\\" or \\"will power\\" applied by the individual. Most individuals with reading problems have brains unaffected by brain injury, but negatively affected by an undefined problem with early learning in the area of reading. Because the brain is otherwise healthy, Tadlock has used highly structured methods associated with the Predictive Cycle to successfully remediate individuals with mild to severe reading problems (including dyslexia). = Practice and the power law of learning = Practice can be an effective way to learn new skills if knowledge of the result, more commonly known as feedback, is involved. There is an observed phenomenon known as the power law of learning, which predicts the rate of skill acquisition over practice time. The power law of learning says that learning occurs at the fastest rate in the beginning then drastically tapers off. The rate at which practice loses its ability to sharpen execution is independent from the skill being practiced and the type of animal learning the skill. For example, participants in a reading speed study made the greatest leap in the first days of the experiment, while additional days of practice saw only slight improvement. The power law of learning can be overcome if the subject is shown a more effective way to accomplish the task. A study subject was shown a film comparing his task performance, kicking a target as rapidly as possible, with that of a known way of minimizing kicking time. Though the subject had reached the limit of his ability to improve through practice as predicted by the power law of learning, viewing the film resulted in a breakthrough in his ability that defied the power law of learning. Viewing the film is an example of observational learning, which effectively gives the viewer new memories of a technique to draw upon for his or her future performances of the task. Tests=Pursuit rotor task= A device used to study visual-motor tracking skills and hand‚Äìeye coordination by requiring the participant to follow a moving object with a cursor or use a stylus to follow the target on a computer screen or a turntable. With the computer screen version, the participant follows a dot on a circular path like the one shown below. Screenshot of a computerized version of the pursuit rotor task. The pursuit rotor task is a simple pure visual-motor tracking test that has consistent results within age groups. This displays a measurement of procedural memory as well as demonstrates the participant's fine motor skills. The pursuit rotor task tests the fine-motor skills which are controlled by the motor cortex illustrated by the green section below. thumb The results are then calculated by the participant's time-on and time-off the object. Amnesic participants show no impairment in this motor task when tested at later trials. It does however seem to be affected by lack of sleep and drug use. =Serial reaction time task= This task involves having participants retain and learn procedural skills that assess specific memory for procedural-motor skill. These skills are measured by observing the speed and accuracy of the participant's ability to retain and acquire new skills. The reaction time is the time it takes for the participant to respond to the designated cue presented to them. Participants with Alzheimer's disease and amnesia demonstrate a long retention time which indicates that they are able to retain the skill and demonstrate effective performance of the task at a later point in time. =Mirror tracing task= This task looks at the integration of the senses more specifically as it is a visual motor test where the participants learn a new motor skill involving hand‚Äìeye coordination. Evidence is shown for procedural memory as amnesic participants are able to learn and retain this task. Drawing the image is the work of your procedural memory; once you figure out how to draw the image in the mirror you have little difficulty the second time. Individuals with Alzheimer's disease are not able to recall the skills acquired in a mirror tracing task, but they acquire the procedural performance ability regardless. =Weather prediction task= Specifically, this task uses experimental analysis of weather prediction. As a probability learning task, the participant is required to indicate what strategy they are using to solve the task. It is a cognitively-oriented task that is learned in a procedural manner. It's designed using multidimensional stimuli, so participants are given a set of cards with shapes and then asked to predict the outcome. After the prediction is made participants receive feedback and make a classification based on that feedback. For example, the participant can be shown one pattern and then asked to predict whether the pattern indicates good or bad weather. The actual weather outcome will be determined by a probabilistic rule based on each individual card. Amnesic participants learn this task in training but are impaired in later training control. = Choice reaction task = Choice reaction tasks have been used to assess working memory. It has been determined to be useful in gauging procedural working memory by asking participants to follow stimulus-reaction rules. Expertise=Divided attention= There are several factors that contribute to the exceptional performance of a skill: memory capacities,Starkes, J. L., & Deakin, J. (1984). Perception in sport: A cognitive approach to skilled performance. In W. F. Straub & J. M. Williams (Eds.), Cognitive sport psychology (pp. 115‚Äì128). Lansing, MI: Sport Science Associates. knowledge structures, problem-solving abilities,Tenenbaum, G., & Bar-Eli, M. (1993). Decision-making in sport: A cognitive perspective. In R. N. Singer, M. Murphey, & L. K. Tennant (Eds.), Handbook of research on sport psychology (pp. 171‚Äì192). New York: Macmillan. and attentional abilities. They all play key roles, each with its own degree of importance based on the procedures and skills required, the context, and the intended goals of the performance. Using these individualized abilities to compare how experts and novices differ regarding both cognitive and sensorimotor skills has provided a wealth of insight into what makes an expert excellent, and conversely, what sorts of mechanisms novices lack. Evidence suggests that an often overlooked condition for skill excellence is attentional mechanisms involved in the effective utilization and deployment of procedural memory during the real-time execution of skills. Research suggests that early in skill learning, execution is controlled by a set of unintegrated procedural steps that are held in working memory and attended to one-by-one in a step-by-step fashion.Anderson, J. R. (1983). The architecture of cognition. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.Anderson, J. R. (1993). Rules of mind. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.Proctor, R. W., & Dutta, A. (1995). Skill acquisition and human performance. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. The problem with this is that attention is a limited resource. Therefore, this step-by-step process of controlling task performance occupies attentional capacity which in turn reduces the performer's ability to focus on other aspects of the performance, such as decision making, fine motor-skills, self-monitoring of energy level and \\"seeing the field or ice or court\\". However, with practice, procedural knowledge develops, which operates largely outside of working memory, and thus allows for skills to be executed more automatically. This, of course, has a very positive effect on overall performance by freeing the mind of the need to closely monitor and attend to the more basic, mechanical skills, so that attention can be paid to other processes. =Choking under pressure= It is well established that highly practiced, over-learned skills are performed automatically; they are controlled in real time, supported by procedural memory, require little attention, and operate largely outside of working memory. However, sometimes even experienced and highly skilled performers falter under conditions of stress. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as choking, and serves as a very interesting exception to the general rule that well-learned skills are robust and resistant to deterioration across a wide range of conditions. Although not well understood, it is widely accepted that the underlying cause of choking is performance pressure, which has been defined as an anxious desire to perform very well in a given situation. Choking is most often associated with motor skills, and the most common real-life instances are in sports. It is common for professional athletes who are highly trained to choke in the moment and perform poorly. However, choking can occur within any domain that demands a high level of performance involving complex cognitive, verbal or motor skills. \\"Self-focus\\" theories suggest that pressure increases anxiety and self-consciousness about performing correctly, which in turn causes an increase in attention paid to the processes directly involved in the execution of the skill. This attention to the step-by-step procedure disrupts the well- learned, automatic (proceduralized) performance. What was once an effortless and unconscious retrieval execution of a procedural memory becomes slow and deliberate. Evidence suggests that the more automated a skill is the more resistant it is to distractions, performance pressure, and subsequent choking. This serves as a good example of the relative durability of procedural memory over episodic memory. In addition to deliberate practice and automization of skills, self-consciousness training has been shown to help with reducing the effect of choking under pressure. Rising to the occasion If choking on skill-based or co-ordination oriented tasks requires the pressure of the situation to cause the performer's increased conscious attention to his or her process of performance, then the reverse can also be true. A relatively unexplored area of scientific research is the concept of \\"rising to the occasion.\\" One common misconception is that a person must be an expert in order to have consistent success under pressure. On the contrary, implicit knowledge has been hypothesized to only partially mediate the relationship between expertise and performance. It works closely with a perceived control of the task, and can often trump expertise if the performer embodies procedural comfort within the domain. Traditionally, \\"rising to the occasion\\" or being \\"clutch\\" has been used in reference to sporting feats of particular excellence given the magnitude of the event, however there is increasing awareness to the phenomenon in our everyday life. How one performs under circumstances that do not necessarily present immediate or grave consequence, but do require the performer to actively access a conscious mechanism to perform in unfamiliar or uncomfortable settings, is a concept that may prove educationally beneficial across a variety of disciplines and activities. Famous examples of choking * 1996 Masters golf tournament, Greg Norman lost to Nick Faldo * 1993 Wimbledon women's final, Jana Novotn√° lost to Steffi Graf * 2011 Masters golf tournament, Rory McIlroy started the final day first, but dropped 8 shots in 3 holes at the turn. * 2019 President's Trophy winning Tampa Bay Lightning swept by 8th seed Columbus Blue Jackets in round 1 of the NHL playoffs. =Expertise-induced amnesia= Sidney Crosby in Vancouver, playing for Team Canada This phenomenon is based on the assumption that reducing or diverting the amount of attention paid to material being encoded and stored will reduce the quality and quantity of the later retrieval of that material in a form that is explicit and reportable. So, if a well learned skill is stored as a procedural memory, and its retrieval and subsequent performance is mostly unconscious and automatic, there is evidence showing that the explicit recollection of what happened during the performance will be reduced. A recent example illustrates this concept nicely. Immediately following Sidney Crosby's overtime goal against the USA, winning the 2010 Olympic Gold Medal for Canada in men's ice hockey, a reporter with TSN did an on-ice interview with Crosby: \\"Sid, if you can, just take us through how that goal went in?\\" Crosby replied: \\"I don't really remember, I just shot it ‚Äì I think from around here. That's all I really remember. I think it went 5-hole, but, um, I didn't really see it to be honest.\\"  Genetic influence  Genetic makeup has been found to impact skill learning and performance, and therefore plays a role in achieving expertise. Using the pursuit rotor task, one study examined the effects of practice in identical and fraternal twins raised in separate homes. Because identical twins share 100% of their genes while fraternal twins share 50%, the impact of genetic makeup on skill learning could be examined. The results of the pursuit rotor task test became more identical with practice over time for the identical twins, whereas the results for the fraternal twins became more disparate with practice. In other words, the performance of the skill by the identical twins became closer to 100% identical, while the fraternal twins' skill performance became less identical, suggesting the 50% difference in genetic makeup is responsible for the difference in skill performance. The study shows that more practice leads to a closer representation of a person's innate capability, also known as talent. Therefore, some of the differences people show after extended practice increasingly reflects their genetics. The study also confirmed the idea that practice improves skill learning by showing that, in both the identical and fraternal groups, more practice aided in shedding ineffective tendencies in order to improve execution of a given skill. Currently, the link between learning and genetics has been limited to simple task learning, while a link to more complex forms of learning, such as the learning of cognitive skills, has not been confirmed. Anatomical structures=Striatum and basal ganglia= Basal ganglia (red) and related structures (blue) shown within the brain The dorsolateral striatum is associated with the acquisition of habits and is the main neuronal cell nucleus linked to procedural memory. Connecting excitatory afferent nerve fibers help in the regulation of activity in the basal ganglia circuit. Essentially, two parallel information processing pathways diverge from the striatum. Both acting in opposition to each other in the control of movement, they allow for association with other needed functional structures One pathway is direct while the other is indirect and all pathways work together to allow for a functional neural feedback loop. Many looping circuits connect back at the striatum from other areas of the brain; including those from the emotion-center linked limbic cortex, the reward-center linked ventral striatum and other important motor regions related to movement. The main looping circuit involved in the motor skill part of procedural memory is usually called the cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus- cortex loop. The striatum is unique because it lacks the glutamate-related neurons found throughout most of the brain. Instead, it is categorized by a high concentration of a special type of GABA related inhibiting cell known as the medium spiny neuron. The two parallel pathways previously mentioned travel to and from the striatum and are made up of these same special medium spiny neurons. These neurons are all sensitive to different neurotransmitters and contain a variety of corresponding receptors including dopamine receptors (DRD1, DRD2), muscarinic receptors (M4) and adenosine receptors (A2A). Separate interneurons are known to communicate with striatal spiny neurons in the presence of the somatic nervous system neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Current understanding of brain anatomy and physiology suggests that striatal neural plasticity is what allows basal ganglia circuits to communicate between structures and to functionally operate in procedural memory processing. =Cerebellum= The cerebellum is highlighted red The cerebellum is known to play a part in correcting movement and in fine-tuning the motor agility found in procedural skills such as painting, instrument playing and in sports such as golf. Damage to this area may prevent the proper relearning of motor skills and through associated research it has more recently been linked to having a role in automating the unconscious process used when learning a procedural skill. New thoughts in the scientific community suggest that the cerebellar cortex holds the holy grail of memory, what is known to researchers as \\"the engram\\" or the biological place where memory lives. The initial memory trace is thought to form here between parallel fibers and Purkinje cell and then travel outwards to other cerebellar nuclei for consolidation. =Limbic system= The limbic system is a group of unique brain areas that work together in many interrelated processes involved in emotion, motivation, learning and memory. Current thinking indicates that the limbic system shares anatomy with a component of the neostriatum already credited with the major task of controlling procedural memory. Once thought to be functionally separate, this vital section of the brain found on the striatum's back border has only recently been linked to memory and is now being called the marginal division zone (MrD). A special membrane protein associated with the limbic system is said to concentrate in related structures and to travel towards the basal nuclei. To put things simply, the activation of brain regions that work together during procedural memory can be followed because of this limbic system associated membrane protein and its application in molecular and immunohistochemistry research. Physiology=Dopamine= Dopamine Pathways in the brain highlighted in Blue Dopamine is one of the more known neuromodulators involved in procedural memory. Evidence suggests that it may influence neural plasticity in memory systems by adapting brain processing when the environment is changing and an individual is then forced to make a behavioural choice or series of rapid decisions. It is very important in the process of \\"adaptive navigation\\", which serves to help different brain areas respond together during a new situation that has many unknown stimuli and features. Dopamine pathways are dispersed all over the brain and this allows for parallel processing in many structures all at the same time. Currently most research points to the mesocorticolimbic dopamine pathway as the system most related to reward learning and psychological conditioning. =At the synapse= Recent findings could help explain the relationship between procedural memory, learning and synaptic plasticity at the level of the molecule. One study used small animals lacking normal levels of CREB family transcription factors to look at the processing of information in the striatum during various tasks. Although poorly understood, results show that CREB function is needed at the synapse for linking the acquisition and storage of procedural memory. Disorders Disorders have been important for the understanding of memory systems. The memory abilities and inhibitions of patients suffering from various diseases played a major role in establishing the distinction that long term memory consists of different types of memory, more specifically declarative memory and procedural memory. Furthermore, they have been important for illuminating the structures of the brain that comprise the neural network of procedural memory. =Alzheimer's disease and dementia= Current Research indicates that procedural memory problems in Alzheimer's may be caused by changes in enzyme activity in memory-integrating brain regions such as the hippocampus. The specific enzyme linked to these changes is called acetylcholinesterase (AchE) which may be affected by a genetic predisposition in an immune-system brain receptor called the histamine H1 receptor. The same current scientific information also looks at how dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine neurotransmitter levels vary in the cerebellum of patients that have this disease. Modern findings advance the idea that the histamine system may be responsible for the cognitive deficits found in Alzheimer's and for the potential procedural memory problems that may develop as a result of the psychopathology. =Tourette syndrome= This disease of the central nervous system, like many other procedural-memory related disorders, involves changes in the associated subcortical brain area known as the striatum. This area and the brain circuits closely interacting with it from the basal ganglia are affected both structurally and at a more functional level in the people affected by Tourette's syndrome. Current literature on this topic provides evidence for there being many unique forms of procedural memory. The one most relevant to procedural memory and most common in Tourette's is related to the skill-acquisition process that ties stimuli to response during the learning part of procedural memory. One study has found that those with Tourette syndrome have enhanced procedural learning. Subjects with Tourette's syndrome were found to have more quickly processed procedural knowledge and more accurately learned procedural skills than their typically developed counterparts. Another study found that subjects with Tourette's syndrome displayed faster processing of rule-based grammar than typically developed subjects. Two possible explanations exist for these results. One explanation is that once a person with Tourette's syndrome has learned a procedure, there is a mechanism that supports more accelerated processing. Second, because procedural memory subserves sequencing, and grammar recruits sequencing, an enhancement of grammatical processing was seen in those with Tourette's syndrome due to their improved procedural memories. =Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)= Neural systems used by procedural memory are commonly targeted by Human Immunodeficiency Virus; the striatum being the structure most notably affected. MRI studies have even shown white matter irregularity and basal ganglia subcortical atrophy in these vital areas necessary for both procedural memory and motor-skill. Applied research using various procedural memory tasks such as the Rotary pursuit, Mirror star tracing and Weather prediction tasks have shown that HIV positive individuals perform worse than HIV negative participants suggesting that poorer overall performance on tasks is due to the specific changes in the brain caused by the disease. =Huntington's disease= Coronal FSPGR through the brain of Huntington's patient Despite being a disorder that directly affects striatal areas of the brain used in procedural memory, most individuals with Huntington's disease don't display the same memory problems as other people with striatum related brain diseases. In more advanced stages of the disease, however, procedural memory is affected by damage to the important brain pathways that help the inner subcortical and prefrontal cortex parts of the brain to communicate.Saint-Cyr JA, Taylor AE, Lang AE. (1988) \\"Procedural learning and neostriatal dysfunction in man\\" Brain 1988 Aug;111 ( Pt 4):941-59. =Obsessive compulsive disorder= Neuroimaging studies show that OCD patients perform considerably better on procedural memory tasks because of noticeable over-activation of the striatum brain structures, specifically the frontostriatal circuit. These studies suggest that procedural memory in OCD patients is unusually improved in the early learning stages of procedural memory. Individuals with OCD do not perform significantly different on procedural working memory tasks than healthy controls. =Parkinson's disease= Parkinson's disease is known to affect selective areas in the frontal lobe area of the brain. Current scientific information suggests that the memory performance problems notably shown in patients are controlled by unusual frontostriatal circuits. Parkinson's patients often have difficulty with the sequence-specific knowledge that is needed in the acquisition step of procedural memory. Further evidence suggests that the frontal lobe networks relate to executive function and only act when specific tasks are presented to the patient. This tells us that the frontostriatal circuits are independent but able to work collaboratively with other areas of the brain to help with various things such as paying attention or focusing. =Schizophrenia= MRI studies have shown that schizophrenic patients not currently taking related medication have a smaller putamen; part of the striatum that plays a very important role in procedural memory. Further studies on the brain reveal that schizophrenics have improper basal ganglia communication with the surrounding extrapyramidal system that is known to be closely involved with the motor system and in the coordination of movement.A Chatterjee, M Chakos, A Koreen, S Geisler, B Sheitman, M Woerner, JM Kane J Alvir and Ja (1995). \\"Prevalence and clinical correlates of extrapyramidal signs and spontaneous dyskinesia in never-medicated schizophrenic patients\\" Am J Psychiatry 1995 Dec; 152 (12); 1724-9. The most recent belief is that functional problems in the striatum of schizophrenic patients are not significant enough to seriously impair procedural learning, however, research shows that the impairment will be significant enough to cause problems improving performance on a task between practice intervals. Drugs Overall, research concerning the effects of drugs on procedural memory is still limited. This limitation stems from the fact that procedural memory is implicit and thus more difficult to test, as opposed to declarative memory which is more pronounced and thus easier memory system to use for determining the effects of an observed drug. =Alcohol= While the effects of Alcohol have been studied immensely, even with respect to memory, there is limited research examining the effects of alcohol on procedural memory. Research conducted by Pitel A. L. et al. suggests that alcoholism impairs the ability to acquire semantic concepts. In this study, while semantic concepts were understood, procedural memory was often not automated. A potential reason for this finding is that poor learning strategies are used by alcoholics compared to non-alcoholics. =Cocaine= It is evident that long-term Cocaine abuse alters brain structures. Research has shown that the brain structures that are immediately affected by long-term cocaine abuse include: cerebral hypoperfusion in the frontal, periventricular and temporal-parietal. These structures play a role in various memory systems. Furthermore, the drug cocaine elicits its desirable effects by blocking the DRD1 dopamine receptors in the striatum, resulting in increased dopamine levels in the brain. These receptors are important for the consolidation of procedural memory. These increased dopamine levels in the brain resultant of cocaine use is similar to the increased dopamine levels in the brain found in schizophrenics. Studies have compared the common memory deficits caused by both cases to further understand the neural networks of procedural memory. To learn more about the effects of dopamine and its role in schizophrenia see: dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. Studies using rats have shown that when rats are administered trace amounts of cocaine, their procedural memory systems are negatively impacted. Specifically, the rats are unable to effectively consolidate motor-skill learning.Willuhn I, Steiner H. (2008) Motor-skill learning in a novel running-wheel task is dependent on D1 dopamine receptors in the striatum. Neuroscience, 22 April; 153 (1); 249-58. Epub 2008 Feb 6. With cocaine abuse being associated with poor procedural learning, research has shown that abstinence from cocaine is associated with sustained improvement of motor-skill learning (Wilfred et al.). =Psychostimulants= Most psychostimulants work by activating dopamine receptors causing increased focus or pleasure. The usage of psychostimulants has become more widespread in the medical world for treating conditions like ADHD. Psychostimulants have been shown to be used more frequently today amongst students and other social demographics as a means to study more efficiently or have been abused for their pleasurable side effects.McCabe, S. E., Knight, J. R., Teter, C. J., Wechsler, H. (2004). Non-medical use of prescription stimulants among US college students: prevalence and correlates from anational survey. Research Report. Research suggests that when not abused, psychostimulants aid in the acquisition of procedural learning. Studies have shown that psychostimulants like d-amphetamine facilitates lower response times and increased procedural learning when compared to control participants and participants who have been administered the antipsychotic haloperidol on procedural learning tasks.Kumari, V., Gray, J.A., Corr, P.J., Mulligan, O.F., Cotter, P.A., Checkley, S.A. (1997). Effects of acute administration of d-amphetamine and haloperidol on procedural learning in man. Journal of Psychopharmacology 129(3); 271‚Äì276 While improvements in procedural memory were evident when participants were administered traces of psychostimulants, many researchers have found that procedural memory is hampered when psychostimulants are abused. This introduces the idea that for optimal procedural learning, dopamine levels must be balanced. Sleep Practice is clearly an important process for learning and perfecting a new skill. With over 40 years of research, it is well established in both humans and animals that the formation of all forms of memory are greatly enhanced during the brain-state of sleep. Furthermore, with humans, sleep has been consistently shown to aid in the development of procedural knowledge by the ongoing process of memory consolidation, especially when sleep soon follows the initial phase of memory acquisition. Memory consolidation is a process that transforms novel memories from a relatively fragile state to a more robust and stable condition. For a long time it was believed that the consolidation of procedural memories took place solely as a function of time, but more recent studies suggest, that for certain forms of learning, the consolidation process is exclusively enhanced during periods of sleep. However, it is important to note that not just any type of sleep is sufficient to improve procedural memory and performance on subsequent procedural tasks. In fact, within the domain of motor skill, there is evidence showing that no improvement on tasks is shown following a short, non-rapid eye movement (NREM; stages 2‚Äì4) sleep, such as a nap. REM sleep following a period of slow-wave sleep (SWS; combined stage 3 and 4 and the deepest form of NREM sleep), has shown to be the most beneficial type of sleep for procedural memory enhancement, especially when it takes place immediately after the initial acquisition of a skill. So essentially, a full night (or day) of uninterrupted sleep soon after learning a skill will allow for the most memory consolidation possible. Furthermore, if REM sleep is disrupted, there is no gain in procedural performance shown. However, equal improvement will take place whether the sleep after practice was at night or during the daytime, as long as SWS is followed by REM sleep. It has also been shown that the enhancement in memory is specific to the learned stimulus (i.e., learning a running technique will not cross over to improvements in biking performance). Subject performance in the Wff 'n Proof Task,Smith C. REM sleep and learning: some recent findings. In: Moffit A, Kramer M, Hoffman H, editors. The functions of dreaming. Albany:SUNY; 1993. the Tower of Hanoi, and the Mirror Tracing TaskConway J, Smith C. REM sleep and learning in humans: a sensitivity to specific types of learning tasks. In: Proceedings of the 12th Congress of the European Sleep Research Society. 1994. has been found to improve following REM sleep periods. Whether a skill is learned explicitly (with attention) or implicitly, each plays a role in the offline consolidation effect. Research suggests that explicit awareness and understanding of the skill being learned during the acquisition process greatly improves the consolidation of procedural memories during sleep. This finding is not surprising, as it is widely accepted that intention and awareness at time of learning enhances the acquisition of most forms of memory. Language Language works because of the brain‚Äôs ability to retrieve pieces of information from memory and then combine those pieces into a larger, more complex unit based on context. The latter part of this process is called unification. Results of several studies provide evidence that suggests procedural memory is not only responsible for sequential unification, but for syntactic priming and grammatical processing as well. One study used patients with Korsakoff‚Äôs syndrome to show that procedural memory subserves syntactic priming. Although Korsakoff‚Äôs patients have deficits in declarative memory, their nondeclarative memory is preserved, allowing them to successfully complete syntactic priming tasks, as in the study. This result proves syntactic priming is a nondeclarative memory function. These patients were also capable of forming proper grammatical sentences, suggesting that procedural memory is responsible for grammatical processing in addition to syntactic priming. Another study‚Äôs results support the hypothesis that procedural memory subserves grammar. The study involved a series of tests for two groups: one typically developing (TD) group and one group with developmental language disorder (DLD). Those with DLD have difficulty with proper grammar usage, due to deficits in procedural memory function. Overall, the TD group performed better on each task and displayed better speed in grammatical processing than the DLD group. Therefore, this study shows that grammatical processing is a function of procedural memory. According to a study carried out in 2010 by Dalhousie University researchers, spoken languages which require the use of helping words or suffixes, rather than word order, to explain subject-object relationships rely on procedural memory. Word-order dependent languages rely on short-term memory for equivalent tasks.Languages use different parts of brain See also   Footnotes Memory Memory processes Skills Technical communication ","title":"Procedural memory"},{"id":"21312317","text":"Emotion can have a powerful effect on humans and animals. Numerous studies have shown that the most vivid autobiographical memories tend to be of emotional events, which are likely to be recalled more often and with more clarity and detail than neutral events. The activity of emotionally enhanced memory retention can be linked to human evolution; during early development, responsive behavior to environmental events would have progressed as a process of trial and error. Survival depended on behavioral patterns that were repeated or reinforced through life and death situations. Through evolution, this process of learning became genetically embedded in humans and all animal species in what is known as flight or fight instinct. Artificially inducing this instinct through traumatic physical or emotional stimuli essentially creates the same physiological condition that heightens memory retention by exciting neuro-chemical activity affecting areas of the brain responsible for encoding and recalling memory.Schacter, D. L. (1996). Searching for memory. New York: Basic Books. This memory-enhancing effect of emotion has been demonstrated in many laboratory studies, using stimuli ranging from words to pictures to narrated slide shows, as well as autobiographical memory studies. However, as described below, emotion does not always enhance memory. Arousal and valence in memory One of the most common frameworks in the emotions field proposes that affective experiences are best characterized by two main dimensions: arousal and valence. The dimension of valence ranges from highly positive to highly negative, whereas the dimension of arousal ranges from calming or soothing to exciting or agitating. The majority of studies to date have focused on the arousal dimension of emotion as the critical factor contributing to the emotional enhancement effect on memory. Different explanations have been offered for this effect, according to the different stages of memory formation and reconstruction. However, a growing body of research is dedicated to the emotional valence dimension and its effects on memory. It has been claimed that this is an essential step towards a more complete understanding of emotion effects on memory. The studies that did investigate this dimension have found that emotional valence alone can enhance memory; that is, nonarousing items with positive or negative valence can be better remembered than neutral items. =Emotion and encoding= From an information processing perspective, encoding refers to the process of interpreting incoming stimuli and combining the processed information. At the encoding level the following mechanisms have been suggested as mediators of emotion effects on memory: Selectivity of attention Easterbrook's (1959) cue utilization theory predicted that high levels of arousal will lead to attention narrowing, defined as a decrease in the range of cues from the stimulus and its environment to which the organism is sensitive. According to this hypothesis, attention will be focused primarily on the arousing details (cues) of the stimulus, so that information central to the source of the emotional arousal will be encoded while peripheral details will not. Accordingly, several studies have demonstrated that the presentation of emotionally arousing stimuli (compared to neutral stimuli) results in enhanced memory for central details (details central to the appearance or meaning of the emotional stimuli) and impaired memory for peripheral details. Also consistent with this hypothesis are findings of weapon focus effect, in which witnesses to a crime remember the gun or knife in great detail but not other details such as the perpetrator's clothing or vehicle. In laboratory replications it was found that participants spend a disproportionate amount of time looking at a weapon in a scene, and this looking time is inversely related to the likelihood that individuals will subsequently identify the perpetrator of the crime. Other researchers have suggested arousal may also increase the duration of attentional focusing on the arousing stimuli, thus delaying the disengagement of attention from it. Ochsner (2000) summarized the different findings and suggested that by influencing attention selectivity and dwell time, arousing stimuli are more distinctively encoded, resulting in more accurate memory of those stimuli. While these previous studies focused on how emotion affects memory for emotionally arousing stimuli, in their arousal- biased competition theory, Mather and Sutherland (2011) argue that how arousal influences memory for non-emotional stimuli depends on the priority of those stimuli at the time of the arousal. Arousal enhances perception and memory of high priority stimuli but impairs perception and memory of low priority stimuli. Priority can be determined by bottom-up salience or by top-down goals. Prioritized processing Emotional items also appear more likely to be processed when attention is limited, suggesting a facilitated or prioritized processing of emotional information. This effect was demonstrated using the attentional blink paradigm in which 2 target items are presented in close temporal proximity within a stream of rapidly presented stimuli. The typical finding is that participants often miss the second target item, as if there were a \\"blink\\" of attention following the first target's presentation, reducing the likelihood that the second target stimulus is attended. However, when the second target stimulus elicits emotional arousal (a \\"taboo\\" word), participants are less likely to miss the target's presentation, which suggests that under conditions of limited attention, arousing items are more likely to be processed than neutral items. Additional support for the Prioritized processing hypothesis was provided by studies investigating the visual extinction deficit. People suffering from this deficit can perceive a single stimulus in either side visual field if it is presented alone but are unaware of the same stimulus in the visual field opposed to the lesional side, if another stimulus is presented simultaneously on the lesional side. Emotion has been found to modulate the magnitude of the visual extinction deficit, so that items that signal emotional relevance (e.g., spiders) are more likely to be processed in the presence of competing distractors than nonemotional items (e.g., flowers). =Emotion and storage= In addition to its effects during the encoding phase, emotional arousal appears to increase the likelihood of memory consolidation during the retention (storage) stage of memory (the process of creating a permanent record of the encoded information). A number of studies show that over time, memories for neutral stimuli decrease but memories for arousing stimuli remain the same or improve. Others have discovered that memory enhancements for emotional information tend to be greater after longer delays than after relatively short ones. This delayed effect is consistent with the proposal that emotionally arousing memories are more likely to be converted into a relatively permanent trace, whereas memories for nonarousing events are more vulnerable to disruption. A few studies have even found that emotionally arousing stimuli enhance memory only after a delay. The most famous of these was a study by Kleinsmith and Kaplan (1963) that found an advantage for numbers paired with arousing words over those paired with neutral words only at delayed test, but not at immediate test. As outlined by Mather (2007), the Kleinsmith and Kaplan effects were most likely due to a methodological confound. However, Sharot and Phelps (2004) found better recognition of arousing words over neutral words at a delayed test but not at an immediate test, supporting the notion that there is enhanced memory consolidation for arousing stimuli.McGaugh, J. L. (1992). Affect, neuromodulatory systems and memory storage. In S. Christianson (Ed.), The handbook of emotion and memory: Research and theory (pp. 269-288). According to these theories, different physiological systems, including those involved in the discharge of hormones believed to affect memory consolidation, become active during, and closely following, the occurrence of arousing events. Another possible explanation for the findings of the emotional arousal delayed effect is post-event processing regarding the cause of the arousal. According to the post stimulus elaboration (PSE) hypothesis, an arousing emotional experience may cause more effort to be invested in elaboration of the experience, which would subsequently be processed at a deeper level than a neutral experience. Elaboration refers to the process of establishing links between newly encountered information and previously stored information. It has long been known that when individuals process items in an elaborative fashion, such that meaning is extracted from items and inter-item associations are formed, memory is enhanced. Thus, if a person gives more thought to central details in an arousing event, memory for such information is likely to be enhanced. However, these processes could also disrupt consolidation of memories for peripheral details. Christianson (1992) suggested that the combined action of perceptual, attentional, and elaborative processing, triggered by an emotionally arousing experience, produces memory enhancements of details related to the emotion laden stimulus, at the cost of less elaboration and consolidation of memory for the peripheral details. Emotion and elaboration The processes involved in this enhancement may be distinct from those mediating the enhanced memory for arousing items. It has been suggested that in contrast to the relatively automatic attentional modulation of memory for arousing information, memory for non-arousing positive or negative stimuli may benefit instead from conscious encoding strategies, such as elaboration. This elaborative processing can be autobiographical or semantic. Autobiographical elaboration is known to benefit memory by creating links between the processed stimuli, and the self, for example, deciding whether a word would describe the personal self. Memory formed through autobiographical elaboration is enhanced as compared to items processed for meaning, but not in relation to the self. Since words such as \\"sorrow\\" or \\"comfort\\" may be more likely to be associated with autobiographical experiences or self-introspection than neutral words such as \\"shadow\\", autobiographical elaboration may explain the memory enhancement of non-arousing positive or negative items. Studies have shown that dividing attention at encoding decreases an individual's ability to utilize controlled encoding processes, such as autobiographical or semantic elaboration. Thus, findings that participants' memory for negative non-arousing words suffers with divided attention, and that the memory advantage for negative, non- arousing words can be eliminated when participants encode items while simultaneously performing a secondary task, has supported the elaborative processing hypothesis as the mechanism responsible for memory enhancement for negative non-arousing words. = Emotion and retrieval = Retrieval is a process of reconstructing past experiences; this phenomenon of reconstruction is influenced by a number of different variables described below.  Trade- off between details  Kensinger argues there are two trade-offs: central/peripheral trade-off of details and a specific/general trade-off. Emotional memories may include increased emotional details often with the trade-off of excluding background information. Research has shown that this trade-off effect cannot be explained exclusively by overt attention (measured by eye-tracking directed to emotional items during encoding) (Steinmetz & Kensinger, 2013). Contextual effects of emotion on memory Contextual effects occur as a result of the degree of similarity between the encoding context and the retrieval context of an emotional dimension. The main findings are that the current mood we are in affects what is attended, encoded and ultimately retrieved, as reflected in two similar but subtly different effects: the mood congruence effect and mood-state dependent retrieval. Positive encoding contexts have been connected to activity in the right fusiform gyrus. Negative encoding contexts have been correlated to activity in the right amygdala (Lewis & Critchley, 2003). However, Lewis and Critchley (2003) claim that it is not clear whether involvement of the emotional system in encoding memory differs for positive or negative emotions, or whether moods at recall lead to activity in the corresponding positive or negative neural networks. =The mood congruence effect= The mood congruence effect refers to the tendency of individuals to retrieve information more easily when it has the same emotional content as their current emotional state. For instance, being in a depressed mood increases the tendency to remember negative events (Drace, 2013). This effect has been demonstrated for explicit retrieval as well as implicit retrieval. =Mood-state dependent retrieval= Another documented phenomenon is the mood-state dependent retrieval, a type of context-dependent memory. The retrieval of information is more effective when the emotional state at the time of retrieval is similar to the emotional state at the time of encoding. Thus, the probability of remembering an event can be enhanced by evoking the emotional state experienced during its initial processing. These two phenomena, the mood congruity effect and mood-state dependent retrieval, are similar to the context effects which have been traditionally observed in memory research (Baddeley, 1993). It may also relate to the phenomena of state-dependent memory in neuropsychopharmacology. When recalling a memory, if someone is recalling an event by themselves or within a group of people, the emotions that they remember may change as well recall of specific details. Individuals recall events with stronger negative emotions than when a group is recalling the same event. Collaborative recall, as it can be referred to, causes strong emotions to fade. Emotional tone changes as well, with a difference of individual or collaborative recall so much that an individual will keep the tone of what was previously felt, but the group will have a more neutral tone. For example, if someone is recalling the negative experience of taking a difficult exam, then they will talk in a negative tone. However, when the group is recalling taking the exam, they will most likely recount it in a positive tone as the negative emotions and tones fade. Detail recount is also something that changed based on the emotion state a person is in when they are remembering an event. If an event is being collaboratively recalled the specific detail count is higher than if an individual is doing it. Detail recall is also more accurate when someone is experiencing negative emotion; Xie and Zhang (2016) conducted a study in which participants saw a screen with five colors on it and when presented with the next screen were asked which color was missing. Those who were experiencing negative emotions were more precise than those in the positive and neutral conditions. Aside from emotional state, mental illness like depression relates to people's ability to recall specific details. Those who are depressed tend to overgeneralize their memories and are not able to remember as many specific details of any events as compared to those without depression. Thematic vs. sudden appearance of emotional stimuli A somewhat different contextual effect stemmed from the recently made distinction between thematical and sudden appearance of an emotionally arousing event, suggesting that the occurrence of memory impairments depends on the way the emotional stimuli are induced. Laney et al. (2003) argued that when arousal is induced thematically (i.e., not through the sudden appearance of a discrete shocking stimulus such as a weapon but rather through involvement in an unfolding event plot and empathy with the victim as his or her plight becomes increasingly apparent), memory enhancements of details central to the emotional stimulus need not come at the expense of memory impairment of peripheral details. Laney et al. (2004) demonstrated this by using an audio narrative to give the presented slides either neutral or emotional meaning, instead of presenting shockingly salient visual stimuli. In one of the experiments, participants in both the neutral and emotional conditions viewed slides of a date scenario of a woman and man at a dinner date. The couple engaged in conversation, then, at the end of the evening, embraced. The event concluded with the man leaving and the woman phoning a friend. The accompanying audio recording informed participants in the neutral condition that the date went reasonably well, while participants in the emotional condition heard that, as the evening wore on, the man displayed some increasingly unpleasant traits of a type that was derogatory to women, and the embrace at the end of the evening was described as an attempt to sexually assault the woman. As expected, the results revealed that details central to the event were remembered more accurately when that event was emotional than when neutral, However, this was not at the expense of memory for peripheral (in this case, spatially peripheral or plot-irrelevant) details, which were also remembered more accurately when the event was emotional. Based on these findings it has been suggested that the dual enhancing and impairing effects on memory are not an inevitable consequence of emotional arousal. Memory of felt emotion  Many researchers use self-report measures of felt emotion as a manipulation check. This raises an interesting question and a possible methodological weakness: are people always accurate when they recall how they felt in the past? Several findings suggest this is not the case. For instance, in a study of memory for emotions in supporters of former U.S. presidential candidate Ross Perot, supporters were asked to describe their initial emotional reactions after Perot's unexpected withdrawal in July 1992 and again after the presidential election that November. Between the two assessment periods, the views of many supporters changed dramatically as Perot re-entered the race in October and received nearly a fifth of the popular vote. The results showed that supporters recalled their past emotions as having been more consistent with their current appraisals of Perot than they actually were. Another study found that people's memories for how distressed they felt when they learned of the 9/11 terrorist attacks changed over time and moreover, were predicted by their current appraisals of the impact of the attacks (Levine et al., 2004). It appears that memories of past emotional responses are not always accurate, and can even be partially reconstructed based on their current appraisal of events. Studies have shown that as episodic memory becomes less accessible over time, the reliance on semantic memory to remember past emotions increases. In one study Levine et al. (2009) primes of the cultural belief of women being more emotional than men had a greater effect on responses for older memories compared to new memories. The long term recall of emotions was more in line with the primed opinions, showing that long term recall of emotions was heavily influenced by current opinions. Emotion regulation effects on memory An interesting issue in the study of the emotion-memory relationship is whether our emotions are influenced by our behavioral reaction to them, and whether this reaction‚Äîin the form of expression or suppression of the emotion‚Äîmight affect what we remember about an event. Researchers have begun to examine whether concealing feelings influences our ability to perform common cognitive tasks, such as forming memories, and found that the emotion regulation efforts do have cognitive consequences. In the seminal work on negative affect arousal and white noise, Seidner found support for the existence of a negative affect arousal mechanism through observations regarding the devaluation of speakers from other ethnic origins.\\" In a study of Richards and Gross (1999) and Tiwari (2013), participants viewed slides of injured men that produced increases in negative emotions, while information concerning each man was presented orally with his slide. The participants were assigned to either an expressive suppression group (where they were asked to refrain from showing emotion while watching the slides) or to a control group (where they were not given regulatory instructions at all). As predicted by the researchers, suppressors showed significantly worse performance on a memory test for the orally presented information. In another study, it was investigated whether expressive suppression (i.e., keeping one's emotions subdued) comes with a cognitive price. They measured expressive suppression when it spontaneously occurred while watching a movie of surgeries. After the movie, memory was tested and was found to be worse with a higher usage of suppression. In a second study, another movie was shown of people arguing. Memory of the conversation was then measured. When gauging the magnitude of cognitive cost, expressive suppression was compared with self-distraction, which was described as simply not trying to think about something. It was concluded that experimentally-induced suppression was associated with worse memory. There is evidence that emotion enhances memory but is more specific towards arousal and valence factors. To test this theory, arousal and valence were assessed for over 2,820 words. Both negative and positive stimuli were remembered higher than neutral stimuli. Arousal also did not predict recognition memory. In this study, the importance of stimulus controls and experimental designs in research memory was highlighted. Arousal-related activities when affiliated with heightened heart rate (HR) stimulate prediction of memory enhancement. It was hypothesized that tonic elevations in HR (meaning revitalization in HR) and phasic HR (meaning quick reaction) declaration to help the memory. Fifty- three men's heart rates were measured while looking at unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant pictures and their memory tested two days later. It was concluded that tonic elevations created more accurate memory recall. Several related studies have reached similar results. It was demonstrated that the effects of expressive suppression on memory generalize to emotionally positive experiences and to socially relevant contexts. One possible answer to the question \\"why does emotion suppression impair memory?\\" might lay in the self monitoring efforts invested in order to suppress emotion (thinking about the behavior one is trying to control). A recent study found heightened self- monitoring efforts among suppressors relative to control participants. That is, suppressors were more likely to report thinking about their behavior and the need to control it during a conversation. Increases in self-monitoring predicted decreases in memory for what was said, that is, people who reported thinking a lot about controlling their behavior had particularly impoverished memories. However, additional research is needed to confirm whether self- monitoring actually exerts a causal effect on memory Emotion-induced forgetting Emotionally arousing stimuli can lead to retrograde amnesia for preceding events and anterograde amnesia for subsequent events. This has been demonstrated in lab studies with lists of words or pictures, in which people show impaired memory for stimuli appearing before or after arousing stimuli. Depression and memory Memory recall tends to be congruent with one's current mood, with depressed people more likely to recall negative events from the past. In addition, depression is often associated with poor memory in general, as outlined here. Dementia and emotional memory Several studies have demonstrated emotional memory enhancement in Alzheimer's patients suggesting that emotional memory enhancement might be used in the daily management of Alzheimer's patients. One study found that objects are recalled significantly better in Alzheimer's patients if they were presented as birthday presents to AD patients. Aging and emotional memory The enhancing effects of emotional arousal on later memory recall tend to be maintained among older adults and the amygdala shows relatively less decline than many other brain regions.Mather, M. (2004). Aging and emotional memory. In D. Reisberg and P. Hertel, (Eds.) Memory and Emotion. NY: Oxford University Press, 272-307. PDF However, older adults also show somewhat of a shift towards favoring positive over negative information in memory, leading to a positivity effect. Emotional memory and sleep Emotional memory and sleep has been a well-researched association. Emotional memories are consolidated greater during sleep, rather than neutral memories. Studies have investigated high valence and arousing words, in comparison to neutral words. Sleep enhances the consolidation of the high valence and arousing words and therefore these are remembered more post-sleep. This concept has been demonstrated in many studies using a variety of media such as pictures, film clips and words. Memories of 'future relevance' are also consolidated greater during sleep. In a study by Wilhelm et al., 2011, memories of items that participants knew were needed for the future (for the testing session) were remembered more after sleep. Sleep consolidated these memories of future relevance to a greater extent. Memories that are emotionally significant and relevant for the future are therefore preferentially consolidated during sleep. This can translate to mean that memories that are more meaningful or valuable to a person are consolidated more. The concept of emotional memory and sleep can be applied to real-life situations e.g. by developing more effective learning strategies. One could integrate the memorization of information that possesses high emotional significance (highly salient) with information that holds little emotional significance (low salience), prior to a period of sleep.

J. (2008). The biology of recognition memory. Psychiatric Times. When the previously experienced event is reexperienced, this environmental content is matched to stored memory representations, eliciting matching signals.(Norman & O'Reilly, 2003) As first established by psychology experiments in the 1970s, recognition memory for pictures is quite remarkable: humans can remember thousands of images at high accuracy after seeing each only once and only for a few seconds.Standing, L. (1973). \\"Learning 10,000 pictures\\". The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 25(2), 207‚Äì222. Retrieved Jan 20 2020, from . Recognition memory can be subdivided into two component processes: recollection and familiarity, sometimes referred to as \\"remembering\\" and \\"knowing\\", respectively. Recollection is the retrieval of details associated with the previously experienced event. In contrast, familiarity is the feeling that the event was previously experienced, without recollection. Thus, the fundamental distinction between the two processes is that recollection is a slow, controlled search process, whereas familiarity is a fast, automatic process. Mandler's \\"Butcher-on-the-bus\\" example: Imagine taking a seat on a crowded bus. You look to your left and notice a man. Immediately, you are overcome with this sense that you've seen this man before, but you cannot remember who he is. This automatically elicited feeling is familiarity. While trying to remember who this man is, you begin retrieving specific details about your previous encounter. For example, you might remember that this man handed you a fine chop of meat in the grocery store. Or perhaps you remember him wearing an apron. This search process is recollection.  Historical overview  The phenomenon of familiarity and recognition has long been described in books and poems. Within the field of Psychology, recognition memory was first alluded to by Wilhelm Wundt in his concept of know-againness or assimilation of a former memory image to a new one. The first formal attempt to describe recognition was by the English Doctor Arthur Wigan in his book Duality of the Mind. Here he describes the feelings of familiarity we experience as being due to the brain being a double organ. In essence we perceive things with one half of our brain and if they somehow get lost in translation to the other side of the brain this causes the feeling of recognition when we again see said object, person etc. However, he incorrectly assumed that these feelings occur only when the mind is exhausted (from hunger, lack of sleep etc.). His description, though elementary compared to current knowledge, set the groundwork and sparked interest in this topic for subsequent researchers. Arthur Allin (1896) was the first person to publish an article attempting to explicitly define and differentiate between subjective and objective definitions of the experience of recognition although his findings are based mostly on introspections. Allin corrects Wigan's notion of the exhausted mind by asserting that this half-dream state is not the process of recognition. He rather briefly refers to the physiological correlates of this mechanism as having to do with the cortex but does not go into detail as to where these substrates are located. His objective explanation of the lack of recognition is when a person observes an object for a second time and experiences the feeling of familiarity that they experienced this object at a previous time. Woodsworth (1913) and Margaret and Edward Strong (1916) were the first people to experimentally use and record findings employing the delayed matching to sample task to analyze recognition memory. Following this Benton Underwood was the first person to analyze the concept of recognition errors in relation to words in 1969. He deciphered that these recognition errors occur when words have similar attributes.Dr. Dewey. \\"Recognition Errors\\" in Introduction to Psychology. intropsych.com Next came attempts to determine the upper limits of recognition memory, a task that Standing (1973) endeavored. He determined that the capacity for pictures is almost limitless.Dr. Dewey. The Almost Limitless Capacity of Recognition Memory. in Introduction to Psychology. intropsych.com In 1980 George Mandler introduced the recollection-familiarity distinction, more formally known as the dual process theory =Dual-process versus single-process theories= It is debatable whether familiarity and recollection should be considered as separate categories of recognition memory. This familiarity-recollection distinction is what is called a dual-process model/theory. \\"Despite the popularity and influence of dual-process theories [for recognition memory], they are controversial because of the difficulty in obtaining separate empirical estimates of recollection and familiarity and the greater parsimony associated with single-process theories.\\" A common criticism of dual process models of recognition is that recollection is simply a stronger (i.e. more detailed or vivid) version of familiarity. Thus, rather than consisting of two separate categories, single-process models regard recognition memory as a continuum ranging from weak memories to strong memories. An account of the history of dual process models since the late 1960s also includes techniques for the measurement of the two processes. Evidence for the single-process view comes from an electrode recording study done on epileptic patients who took an item-recognition task. This study found that hippocampal neurons, regardless of successful recollection, responded to the familiarity of objects. Thus, the hippocampus may not exclusively subserve the recollection process. However, they also found that successful item recognition was not related to whether or not 'familiarity' neurons fired. Therefore, it's not entirely clear which responses relate to successful item recognition. However, one study suggested that hippocampal activation does not necessarily mean that conscious recollection will occur. In this object-scene associative recognition study, hippocampal activation was not related to successful associative recollection; it was only when the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus was activated that successful performance was observed. Further, eye tracking evidence revealed that participants looked longer at the correct stimulus, and this was related to increases in hippocampal activity. Therefore, the hippocampus may play a role in the recovery of relational information, but it requires concomitant activation with the prefrontal cortex for conscious recollection. Studies with amnesics, do not seem to support the single-process notion. A number of reports feature patients with selective damage to the hippocampus who are impaired only in recollection but not in familiarity, which provides tentative support for dual-process models. Further, a double dissociation between recollection and familiarity has been observed. Patient N.B. had regions of her medial temporal lobes removed, including the perirhinal cortex and entorhinal cortex, but her hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex were spared. She exhibited impaired familiarity but intact recollection processes relative to controls in a yes-no recognition paradigm, and this was elucidated using ROC, RK, and response-deadline procedures. In another study, even when performance between patient N.B. was matched to one amnesic patient who had their hippocampus removed, the double dissociation was still present. While performance was matched post hoc and replication is needed, this evidence rules out the idea that these brain regions are part of a unitary memory strength system. Instead, this double dissociation strongly suggests that distinct brain regions and systems underlie both recollection and familiarity processes. The dual process theories make it possible to distinguish two types of recognition: first, recognizing THAT one has encountered some object/event before; and second recognizing WHAT that object/event was. Thus one may recognize a face, but only later recollect whose face it was. Delayed recognition also shows differences between fast familiarity and slow recollection processes In addition, in the ‚Äúfamiliarity‚Äù system of recognizing memory two functional subsystems are distinguished: the first one is responsible for recognition of previously presented stimuli and the second one supports recognition of objects as new. At present, neuroscientific research has not provided a definitive answer to this controversy, although it heavily favors dual-process models. While many studies provide evidence that recollection and familiarity are represented in separate regions of the brain, other studies show that this is not always the case; there may be a great deal of neuroanatomical overlap between the two processes. Despite the fact that familiarity and recollection sometimes activate the same brain regions, they are typically quite distinct functionally. The question of whether recollection and familiarity exist as two independent categories or along a continuum may ultimately be irrelevant; the bottom line is that the recollection-familiarity distinction has been extremely useful in understanding how recognition memory works. Measurement and methods=Old-new recognition= Used to assess recognition memory based on the pattern of yes-no responses.Radvansky, G. (2006) Human Memory. Boston, MA: Pearson Education Group, Inc. This is one of the simplest forms of testing for recognition, and is done so by giving a participant an item and having them indicate 'yes' if it is old or 'no' if it is a new item. This method of recognition testing makes the retrieval process easy to record and analyze. =Forced choice recognition= Participants are asked to identify which of several items (two to four) is correct. One of the presented items is the target‚Äîa previously presented item. The other items are similar, and act as distractors. This allows the experimenter a degree of manipulation and control in item similarity or item resemblance. This helps provide a better understanding of retrieval, and what kinds of existing knowledge people use to decide based on memory. =Use of mental chronometry= When response time is recorded (in milliseconds or seconds), a faster speed is thought to reflect a simpler process, whereas slower times reflect more complex physiological processes. Hermann von Helmholtz was the first psychologist to inquire whether the velocity of a nerve impulse could be a speed that is measurable. He devised an experimental set-up for measuring psychological processes with a very precise and critical time-scale. The birth of mental chronometry is attributed to an experiment by Helmholtz's colleague, Franciscus Donders. In the experiment, he attached electrodes to both feet of the subject. He then administered a mild shock to either the left or right foot, and told the subject to move the hand on the same side‚Äîwhich turned the stimulus (the shock) off. In a different condition, the subject was not told which foot the stimulus would act on. The time difference between these conditions was measured as one-fifteenth of a second. This was a significant finding in early experimental psychology, because researchers previously thought that psychological processes were too fast to measure. =Dual process models= An early model of dual process theories was suggested by Atkinson and Juola's (1973) model. In this theory, the familiarity process would be the first activated as a fast search for recognition. If that is unsuccessful in retrieving the memory trace, then there is a more forced search into the long- term memory store. The \\"horse-race\\" model is a more recent view of dual process theories. This view suggests that the two processes of familiarity and recollection occur simultaneously, but that familiarity, being the faster process, completes the search before recollection. This view holds true the idea that familiarity is an unconscious process whereas recollection is more conscious, thoughtful. Factors in recognition accuracy=Decision- making= In circumstances of uncertainty, identification of a prior occurrence depends on decision-making processes. The available information must be compared with some internal criteria that provide guidance on which decision is more advantageous. Signal detection theory has been applied to recognition memory as a method of estimating the effect of the application of these internal criteria, referred to as bias. Critical to the dual process model is the assumption that recognition memory reflects a signal detection process in which old and new items each have a distinct distribution along a dimension, such as familiarity.Yonelinas, A. (2001). \\"Components of episodic memory: the contribution of recollection and familiarity\\", pp. 31‚Äì52 in A. Baddeley, J. Aggleton, & M. Conway (Eds.), Episodic memory. New York: Oxford University Press. The application of Signal Detection Theory (SDT) to memory depends on conceiving of a memory trace as a signal that the subject must detect in order to perform in a retention task. Given this conception of memory performance, it is reasonable to assume that percentage correct scores may be biased indicators of retention‚Äîjust as thresholds may be biased indicators of sensory performance‚Äîand, in addition, that SDT techniques should be used where possible to separate the truly retention-based aspects of memory performance from the decision aspects. In particular, we assume that the subject compares the trace strength of the test item with a criterion, responding \\"yes\\" if the strength exceeds the criterion and \\"no\\"otherwise. There are two types of test items, \\"old\\" (a test item that appeared in the list for that trial) and new\\" (one that did not appear in the list). Strength theory assumes that there may be noise in the value of the trace strength, the location of the criterion, or both. We assume that this noise is normally distributed. The reporting criterion can shift along the continuum in the direction of more false hits, or more misses. The momentary memory strength of a test item is compared with the decision criteria and if the strength of the item falls within the judgment category, Jt, defined by the placement of the criteria, S makes judgment. The strength of an item is assumed to decline monotonically (with some error variance) as a continuous function of time or number of intervening items. False hits are 'new' words incorrectly recognized as old, and a greater proportion of these represents a liberal bias. Misses are 'old' words mistakenly not recognized as old, and a greater proportion of these represents a conservative bias. The relative distributions of false hits and misses can be used to interpret recognition task performance and correct for guessing. Only target items can generate an above-threshold recognition response because only they appeared on the list. The lures, along with any targets that are forgotten, fall below threshold, which means that they generate no memory signal whatsoever. False alarms in this model reflect memory-free guesses that are made to some of the lures. =Level of processing= The level of cognitive processing performed on a given stimuli has an effect on recognition memory performance, with more elaborate, associative processing resulting in better memory performance.Adams, J. (1967). Human memory. New York: McGraw Hill. For example, recognition performance is improved through the use of semantic associations over feature associations. However, this process is mediated by other features of the stimuli, for example, the relatedness of the items to one another. If the items are highly interrelated, lower-depth item-specific processing (such as rating the pleasantness of each item) helps to distinguish them from one another, and improves recognition memory performance over relational processing. This unusual phenomenon is explained by the automatic tendency to perform relational processing on highly interrelated items. Recognition performance is improved by additional processing, even of a lower level of associativeness, but not by a task that duplicates the automated processing already performed on the list of items.Roediger, H., & Guynn, M. (1996). \\"Retrieval Processes\\". pp. 197‚Äì236 in E. Bjork & R. Bjork (Eds.), Memory. California: Academic Press. =Context= There are a variety of ways that context can influence memory. Encoding specificity describes how memory performance is enhanced if testing conditions match learning (encoding) conditions. Certain aspects during the learning period, whether it be the environment, your current physical state, or even your mood, become encoded in the memory trace. Later during retrieval, any of these aspects can serve as cues to aid in recognition. For example, research by Godden and Baddeley tested this concept on scuba divers. Some groups learned their scuba lessons on land, and others learned in the water. Likewise, some groups were tested for their knowledge on land, and others in the water. Not surprisingly, test results were highest when retrieval conditions matched encoding conditions (those who learned on land performed best on land, and vice versa for water). There have also been studies that show similar effects regarding an individual's physical state. This is known as state-dependent learning. Another type of encoding specificity is mood congruent memory, where individuals are more likely to remember material if the emotional content of the material and the prevailing mood at recall matched. The presence of other individuals can also have an effect on recognition. Two opposing effects, collaborative inhibition and collaborative facilitation impact memory performance in groups. Specifically, collaborative facilitation refers to the increased performance on recognition tasks in groups. The opposite, collaborative inhibition, refers to a decreased memory performance on recall tasks in groups. This is because in a recall task, a specific memory trace must be activated, and outside ideas could produce a kind of interference. Recognition, on the other hand does not utilize the same manner of retrieval plan as recall and is therefore not affected. =Recognition errors= The two basic categories of recognition memory errors are false hits (or false alarms) and misses. A false hit is the identification of an occurrence as old when it is in fact new. A miss is the failure to identify a previous occurrence as old. Two specific types of false hits emerge when elicited through the use of a recognition lure. The first is a feature error, in which a part of an old stimulus is presented in combination with a new element. For example, if the original list contained \\"blackbird, jailbait, buckwheat\\", a feature error may be elicited through the presentation of \\"buckshot\\" or \\"blackmail\\" at test, as each of these lures has an old and a new component. The second type of error is a conjunction error, in which parts of multiple old stimuli are combined. Using the same example, \\"jailbird\\" could elicit a conjunction error, as it is a conjunction of two old stimuli. Both types of errors can be elicited through both auditory and visual modalities, suggesting that the processes that produce these errors are not modality-specific. A third false hit error can be induced through the use of the Deese‚ÄìRoediger‚ÄìMcDermott paradigm. If all items studied are highly related to one word that does not appear on the list, the subject is highly likely to recognize that word as old in the test. An example of this would be a list containing the following words: nap, drowsy, bed, duvet, night, relax. The lure in this case is the word 'sleep'. It is highly likely that 'sleep' would be falsely recognized as appearing on that list due to the level of activation received from the list words. This phenomenon is so pervasive that the rate of false generated in this manner can even surpass the rate of correct responsesRoediger, H., McDermott, K., & Robinson, K. (1998). \\"The role of associative processes in creating false memories\\", pp. 187‚Äì245 in M. Conway, S. Gathercole, & C. Cornoldi (Eds.), Theories of memory II. Sussex: Psychological Press. =Mirror effect= According to Robert L. Green (1996), the mirror effect occurs when stimuli that are easy to recognize as old when old are also easy to recognize as new when new in recognition. The mirror effect refers to the consistency of the recognition of the stimuli in memory. In other words, they are easier to remember when you have previously studied the stimuli i.e., old, and easier to reject when you have not seen them before, i.e. new. Murray Glanzer and John K. Adams first described the mirror effect in 1985. The mirror effect has been effective in tests of associative recognition, measures of latency responses, discriminations of order, and others (Glanzer & Adams, 1985). Neural underpinnings On the whole, research concerning the neural substrates of familiarity and recollection demonstrates that these processes typically involve different brain regions, thereby supporting a dual-process theory of recognition memory. However, due to the complexity and inherent interconnectivity of the neural networks of the brain, and given the close proximity of regions involved in familiarity to regions involved in recollection, it is difficult to pinpoint the structures that are specifically related to recollection or to familiarity. What is known at present is that most of a number of neuroanatomical regions involved in recognition memory are primarily associated with one subcomponent over the other. Medial sagittal view of human brain =Normal brains= Recognition memory is critically dependent on a hierarchically organized network of brain areas including the visual ventral stream, medial temporal lobe structures, frontal lobe and parietal cortices along with the hippocampus. As mentioned previously, the processes of recollection and familiarity are represented differently in the brain. As such, each of the regions listed above can be further subdivided according to which part is primarily involved in recollection or in familiarity. In the temporal cortex, for instance, the medial region is related to recollection whereas the anterior region is related to familiarity. Similarly, in the parietal cortex, the lateral region is related to recollection whereas the superior region is related to familiarity. An even more specific account divides the medial parietal region, relating the posterior cingulate to recollection and the precuneus to familiarity. The hippocampus plays a prominent role in recollection whereas familiarity depends heavily on the surrounding medial-temporal regions, especially the perirhinal cortex. Finally, it is not yet clear what specific regions of the prefrontal lobes are associated with recollection versus familiarity, although there is evidence that the left prefrontal cortex is correlated more strongly with recollection whereas the right prefrontal cortex is involved more in familiarity. Though left-side activation involved in recollection was originally hypothesized to result from semantic processing of words (many of these earlier studies used written words for stimuli) subsequent studies using nonverbal stimuli produced the same finding‚Äîsuggesting that prefrontal activation in the left hemisphere results from any kind of detailed remembering. As previously mentioned, recognition memory is not a stand-alone concept; rather it is a highly interconnected and integrated sub-system of memory. Perhaps misleadingly, the regions of the brain listed above correspond to an abstract and highly generalized understanding of recognition memory, in which the stimuli or items-to-be- recognized are not specified. In reality, however, the location of brain activation involved in recognition is highly dependent on the nature of the stimulus itself. Consider the conceptual differences in recognizing written words compared to recognizing human faces. These are two qualitatively different tasks and as such it is not surprising that they involve additional, distinct regions of the brain. Recognizing words, for example, involves the visual word form area, a region in the left fusiform gyrus, which is believed to specialized in recognizing written words. Similarly, the fusiform face area, located in the right hemisphere, is linked specifically to the recognition of faces. Encoding Strictly speaking, recognition is a process of memory retrieval. But how a memory is formed in the first place affects how it is retrieved. An interesting area of study related to recognition memory deals with how memories are initially learned or encoded in the brain. This encoding process is an important aspect of recognition memory because it determines not only whether or not a previously introduced item is recognized, but how that item is retrieved through memory. Depending on the strength of the memory, the item may either be 'remembered' (i.e. a recollection judgment) or simply 'known' (i.e. a familiarity judgment). Of course, the strength of the memory depends on many factors, including whether or not the person was giving their full attention to memorizing the information or whether they were distracted, whether they are actively attempting to learn (intentional learning) or only learning passively, whether they were allowed to rehearse the information or not, etc., although these contextual details are beyond the scope of this entry. Several studies have shown that when an individual is devoting his/her full attention to the memorization process, the strength of the successful memory is related to the magnitude of bilateral activation in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus. The greater the activation in these areas during learning, the better the memory. Thus, these areas are involved in the formation of detailed, recollective memories. In contrast, when subjects are distracted during the memory-encoding process, only the right prefrontal cortex and left parahippocampal gyrus are activated. These regions are associated with \\"a sense of knowing\\" or familiarity. Given that the areas involved in familiarity are also involved in recollection, this conforms to a single-process theory of recognition, at least insofar as the encoding of memories is concerned. In other senses Recognition memory is not confined to the visual domain; we can recognize things in each of the five traditional sensory modalities (i.e. sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste). Although most neuroscientific research has focused on visual recognition, there have also been studies related to audition (hearing), olfaction (smell), gustation (taste), and tactition (touch). = Audition = Auditory recognition memory is primarily dependent on the medial temporal lobe as displayed by studies on lesioned patients and amnesics. Moreover, studies conducted on monkeys and dogs have confirmed that perinhinal and entorhinal cortex lesions fail to affect auditory recognition memory as they do in vision. Further research needs must be done on the role of the hippocampus in auditory recognition memory, as studies in lesioned patients suggest that the hippocampus does play a small role in auditory recognition memory while studies with lesioned dogs directly conflict this finding. It has also been proposed that area TH is vital for auditory recognition memory but further research must be done in this area as well. Studies comparing visual and auditory recognition memory conclude the auditory modality is inferior. =Olfaction= Research on human olfaction is scant in comparison to other senses such as vision and hearing, and studies specifically devoted to olfactory recognition are even rarer. Thus, what little information there is on this subject is gleaned through animal studies. Rodents such as mice or rats are suitable subjects for odor recognition research given that smell is their primary sense.The Humane Society of the United States. (2007). Mouse . \\"[For these species], recognition of individual body odors is analogous to human face recognition in that it provides information about identity.\\" In mice, individual body odors are represented at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In a study performed with rats, the orbitofrontal cortex (OF) was found to play an important role in odor recognition. The OF is reciprocally connected with the perirhinal and entorhinal areas of the medial temporal lobe, which have also been implicated in recognition memory. =Gustation= Gustatory recognition memory, or the recognition of taste, is correlated with activity in the anterior temporal lobe (ATL). In addition to brain imaging techniques, the role of the ATL in gustatory recognition is evidenced by the fact that lesions to this area result in an increased threshold for taste recognition for humans. Cholinergic neurotransmission in the perirhinal cortex is essential for the acquisition of taste recognition memory and conditioned taste aversion in humans. =Tactition= Monkeys with lesions in the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices also show impairment on tactual recognition. =Lesioned brains= The concept of domain specificity is one that has helped researchers probe deeper into the neural substrates of recognition memory. Domain specificity is the notion that some areas of the brain are responsible almost exclusively for the processing of particular categories. For example, it is well documented that the fusiform gyrus (FFA) in the inferior temporal lobe is heavily involved in face recognition. A specific region in this gyrus is even named the fusiform face area due to its heightened neurological activity during face perception. Similarly there is also a region of the brain known as the parahippocampal place area on the parahippocampal gyrus. As the name implies, this area is sensitive to environmental context, places. Damage to these areas of the brain can lead to very specific deficits. For example, damage to the FFA often leads to prosopagnosia, an inability to recognize faces. Lesions to various brain regions such as these serve as case study data that help researchers understand the neural correlates of recognition. The Four Basic Lobes of the Human Brain Medial temporal lobe The medial temporal lobes and their surrounding structures are of immense importance to memory in general. The hippocampus is of particular interest. It has been well documented that damage here can result in severe retrograde or anterograde amnesia, the patient is unable to recollect certain events from their past or create new memories respectively. However, the hippocampus does not seem to be the \\"storehouse\\" of memory. Rather, it may function more as a relay station. Research suggests that it is through the hippocampus that short term memory engages in the process of consolidation (the transfer to long term storage). The memories are transferred from the hippocampus to the broader lateral neocortex via the entorhinal cortex. This helps explain why many amnesics have spared cognitive abilities. They may have a normal short term memory, but are unable to consolidate that memory and it is lost rapidly. Lesions in the medial temporal lobe often leave the subject with the capacity to learn new skills, also known as procedural memory. If experiencing anterograde amnesia, the subject cannot recall any of the learning trials, yet consistently improves with each trial. This highlights the distinctiveness of recognition as a particular and separate type of memory, falling into the domain of declarative memory. The hippocampus is also useful in the familiarity vs. recollection distinction in recognition as mentioned above. A familiar memory is a context free memory in which the person has a feeling of \\"know\\", as in, \\"I know I put my car keys here somewhere\\". It can sometimes be likened to a tip of the tongue feeling. Recollection on the other hand is a much more specific, deliberate, and conscious process, also termed remembering. The hippocampus is believed heavily involved in recollection, whereas familiarity is attributed to the perirhinal cortex and broader temporal cortex in general, however, there is debate over the validity of these neural substrates and even the familiarity/recollection separation itself. Damage to the temporal lobes can also result in visual agnosia, a deficit in which patients are unable to properly recognize objects, either due to a perceptive deficit, or a deficit in semantic memory.Humphreys, G. W., & Riddoch, M. J. (1987). To see but not to see: A case of visual agnosia. Hove, Uk: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, . In the process of object recognition, visual information from the occipital lobes (such as lines, movement, colour etc.) must at some point be actively interpreted by the brain and attributed meaning. This is commonly referred to in terms of the ventral, or \\"what\\" pathway, which leads to the temporal lobes. People with visual agnosia are often able to identify features of an object (it is small, cylindrical, has a handle etc.), but are unable to recognize the object as a whole (a tea cup).Ellis, R., & Humphreys, G. (1999). Connectionist Psychology. Psychology Press. p. 548‚Äì549, . This has been termed specifically as integrative agnosia. Parietal lobe Recognition memory was long thought to involve only the structures of the medial temporal lobe. More recent neuroimaging research has begun to demonstrate that the parietal lobe plays an important, though often subtle role in recognition memory as well. Early PET and fMRI studies demonstrated activation of the posterior parietal cortex during recognition tasks, however, this was initially attributed to retrieval activation of precuneus, which was thought involved in reinstating visual content in memory. New evidence from studies of patients with right posterior parietal lobe damage indicates very specific recognition deficits. This damage causes impaired performance on object recognition tasks with a variety of visual stimuli, including colours, familiar objects, and new shapes. This performance deficit is not a result of source monitoring errors, and accurate performance on recall tasks indicates that the information has been encoded. Damage to the posterior parietal lobe therefore does not cause global memory retrieval errors, only errors on recognition tasks. Lateral parietal cortex damage (either dextral or sinistral) impairs performance on recognition memory tasks, but does not affect source memories. What is remembered is more likely to be of the 'familiar', or 'know' type, rather than 'recollect' or 'remember', indicating that damage to the parietal cortex impairs the conscious experience of memory. There are several hypotheses that seek to explain the involvement of the posterior parietal lobe in recognition memory. The attention to memory model (AtoM) posits that the posterior parietal lobe could play the same role in memory as it does in attention: mediating top-down versus bottom-up processes. Memory goals can either be deliberate (top-down) or in response to an external memory cue (bottom-up). The superior parietal lobe sustains top-down goals, those provided by explicit directions. The inferior parietal lobe can cause the superior parietal lobe to redirect attention to bottom-up driven memory in the presence of an environmental cue. This is the spontaneous, non-deliberate memory process involved in recognition. This hypothesis explains many findings related to episodic memory, but fails to explain the finding that diminishing the top- down memory cues given to patients with bilateral posterior parietal lobe damage had little effect on memory performance. A new hypothesis explains a greater range of parietal lobe lesion findings by proposing that the role of the parietal lobe is in the subjective experience of vividness and confidence in memories. This hypothesis is supported by findings that lesions on the parietal lobe cause the perception that memories lack vividness, and give patients the feeling that their confidence in their memories is compromised. The output-buffer hypothesis of the parietal cortex postulates that parietal regions help hold the qualitative content of memories for retrieval, and make them accessible to decision-making processes. Qualitative content in memories helps to distinguish those recollected, so impairment of this function reduces confidence in recognition judgments, as in parietal lobe lesion patients. Several other hypotheses attempt to explain the role of the parietal lobe in recognition memory. The mnemonic-accumulator hypothesis postulates that the parietal lobe holds a memory strength signal, which is compared with internal criteria to make old/new recognition judgments. This relates to signal- detection theory, and accounts for recollected items being perceived as 'older' than familiar items. The attention to internal representation hypothesis posits that parietal regions shift and maintain attention to memory representations. This hypothesis relates to the AtoM model, and suggests that parietal regions are involved in deliberate, top-down intention to remember. A possible mechanism of the parietal lobe's involvement in recognition memory may be differential activation for recollected versus familiar memories, and old versus new stimuli. This region of the brain shows greater activation during segments of recognition tasks containing primarily old stimuli, versus primarily new stimuli. A dissociation between the dorsal and ventral parietal regions has been demonstrated, with the ventral region experiencing more activation for recollected items, and the dorsal region experiencing more activation for familiar items. Anatomy provides further clues to the role of the parietal lobe in recognition memory. The lateral parietal cortex shares connections with several regions of the medial temporal lobe, including its hippocampal, parahippocampal, and entorhinal regions. These connections may facilitate the influence of the medial temporal lobe in cortical information processing. Frontal lobe Evidence from amnesic patients have shown that lesions in the right frontal lobe are a direct cause of false recognition errors. Some suggest this is due to a variety of factors including defective monitoring, retrieval and decision processes. Patients with frontal lobe lesions also showed evidence of marked anterograde and relatively mild retrograde face memory impairment. =Evolutionary basis= The ability to recognize stimuli as old or new has significant evolutionary advantages for humans. Discerning between familiar and unfamiliar stimuli allows for rapid threat appraisals in often hostile environments. The speed and accuracy of an old/new recognition judgment are two components in a series of cognitive processes that allow humans to identify and respond to potential dangers in their environments. Recognition of a prior occurrence is one adaptation that provides a cue of the utility of information to decision-making processes. The perirhinal cortex is notably involved in both the fear response and recognition memory. Neurons in this region activate strongly in response to new stimuli, and activate less frequently as familiarity with the stimulus increases. Information regarding stimulus identity arrives at the hippocampus via the perirhinal cortex, with the perirhinal system contributing a rapid, automatic appraisal of the familiarity of the stimuli and the recency of its presentation. This recognition response has the distinct evolutionary advantage of providing information for decision-making processes in an automated, expedient, and non-effortful manner, allowing for faster responses to threats. Applications A practical application of recognition memory is in relation to developing multiple choice tests in an academic setting. A good test does not tap recognition memory, it wants to discern how well a person encoded and can recall a concept. If people rely on recognition for use on a memory test (such as multiple choice) they may recognize one of the options but this does not necessarily mean it is the correct answer.University of Waterloo. Writing Multiple Choice Tests .  References Memory processes ","title":"Recognition memory"},{"id":"21312324","text":"In psychology, implicit memory is one of the two main types of long-term human memory. It is acquired and used unconsciously, and can affect thoughts and behaviours. One of its most common forms is procedural memory, which allows people to perform certain tasks without conscious awareness of these previous experiences; for example, remembering how to tie one's shoes or ride a bicycle without consciously thinking about those activities. Implicit memory's counterpart is known as explicit memory or declarative memory, which refers to the conscious, intentional recollection of factual information, previous experiences and concepts. Evidence for implicit memory arises in priming, a process whereby subjects are measured by how they have improved their performance on tasks for which they have been subconsciously prepared. Implicit memory also leads to the illusory truth effect, which suggests that subjects are more likely to rate as true those statements that they have already heard, regardless of their truthfulness.  Evidence and current research =Early research= Advanced studies of implicit memory began only in the 1980s. In early research, subjects were presented with words under different conditions and were given two types of tests: recognition memory tests and perceptual identification tests. These studies provided evidence that effects of memory on perceptual identification was independent of recognition memory. Jacoby & Brooks argued that perceptual identity effects reflect very rapid, context-specific learning. Unconscious influences of memory were found to alter the subjective experiences of participants. In one such study, participants judged that the white background noise was lower when they read words they had already been presented, thus misattributing their ease of perceiving the word to less noisy environment. This provided evidence for specific and long-living influences of past memory even when participants were unaware of its influence. Similar effects have been found with studies where participants made judgments about difficulty of anagrams and recognized famous names. =Priming studies= The effect of implicit memory was tested employing priming procedures. Several studies confirm implicit memory as a separate entity. In one such experiment, participants were asked to listen to several songs and decide if they were familiar with the song or not. Half of the participants were presented with familiar American folk songs and the other half were presented with songs made using the tunes of the same songs from group 1 but mixed with new lyrics. Results show that participants in group 1 had a much higher chance of recalling the songs as being familiar, even though in both groups, the tunes of the songs were the same. This study shows that people are even implicitly making connections amongst their memories. Much memory study focuses on associative memory, or memories formed between two entities, linking them together in the brain. This study shows that people implicitly make a strong associative connection between a song's tune and its lyrics that they can't separate later. Some clues as to the anatomical basis of implicit memory have emanated from recent studies comparing different forms of dementia. Patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) have been reported to be severely impaired on both lexical and semantic priming tasks, while patients with Huntington's disease (HD) were able to demonstrate normal priming ability (Shimamura et al., 1987; Salmon et al., 1988). In contrast, HD patients evidenced little learning on a pursuit- rotor task that was easily mastered by both amnesic and DAT patients (Eslinger and Damasio, 1986; Heindel et al., 1988). This possible double dissociation involving HD and DAT patients suggests that different implicit memory tasks are mediated by distinct neural systems and that these tasks can be used to differentiate some of the so-called \\"cortical\\" (e.g., DAT) from \\"subcortical\\" (e.g., HD) dementias (Cummings and Benson, 1984). A more recent contribution to the study of implicit memory comes from the experiments with a spatial organization computer game on amnesic patients (Stickgold et al., 2000). Damage to the bilateral temporal lobe and hippocampus had caused the loss of explicit memory. However, despite being unable to recall the game, these patients were able to dream of it at sleep onset. This observation is interesting as it shows that learning can be memorized without the contribution of explicit memory, which requires the activation of the hippocampus and of the temporal and basal cortex. In the cases observed by Stickgold et al., the explicit memory was definitely impaired, but a non- explicit and non-conscious kind of memory was left and could emerge in dreams. This observation shows that an experience can be stored in the implicit memory and can be represented symbolically in dreams. =Current research= According to Daniel L. Schacter, \\"The question of whether implicit and explicit memory depend on a single underlying system or on multiple underlying systems is not yet resolved.\\" The findings display such a variety of phenomena that there has not yet been a theory to account for all of the observations. Instead, two theories have been presented to explain different subsets of the data. Modern discoveries in neuropsychology concerning the organization of memory allow us to hypothesize that some synaptical cortical and subcortical circuits form the seat of unconscious mental functions. The possibility of identifying, in the explicit and implicit memory respectively, the repressed and unrepressed unconscious opens new and stimulating perspectives for an integration of neuroscience with psychoanalysis, and for a possible anatomic localization of the functions of these two different forms of unconscious. This depends on a presupposition: that the experiences, emotions, phantasies, and defences that help organize an individual's unconscious psychic reality, from birth throughout life, are stored in the nervous structures concerning memory, both implicit and explicit. This is, after all, in line with Freud's conviction: 'latent conceptions, if we have any reason to suppose that they exist in the mind‚Äîas we had in the case of memory‚Äîlet them be denoted by the term \\"unconscious\\"' (1912, p. 260). There are usually two approaches to studying implicit memory. The first is to define a characteristic associated with explicit memory. If a person with a normal working memory can solve the task (e.g. remembering a list of words), then they are consciously recalling a memory. The second approach invokes neither a conscious nor an unconscious response. This approach is dependent on many independent variables that affect the response of a person's implicit and explicit memory. Development Empirical evidence suggests infants are only capable of implicit memory because they are unable to intentionally draw knowledge from pre-existing memories. As people mature, they are usually capable of intentional recollection of memory, or explicit memory. However, amnesic patients are usually the exception to developing memory, but are still capable of undergoing priming, to some extent. Since procedural memory is based on automatic responses to certain stimuli, amnesic patients are not affected by their disability when behaving habitually. Some of the child's primary experiences are positive and essential for the physical and mental growth of the child. Others may be traumatic: neglect, parental inadequacy or possible mental illness, physical or psychological violence, child abuse, even of a sexual nature, as well as the constant frustrations and disillusionments that lead the child to organize their defences and boost their phantasies. All these experiences cannot be repressed because the hippocampus, necessary for the explicit memory, which is in turn indispensable for repression, is not mature in early infancy (R. Joseph, 1996; Siegel, 1999). On the contrary, the amygdala, which promotes the organization of the implicit memory, undergoes an earlier maturation (R. Joseph, 1996). Therefore, these early experiences, including those that concern the organization of language, can only be deposited in this latter form of memory and they contribute to the formation of an early unrepressed unconscious nucleus of the self (Mancia, 2003a, in press). Although the explicit‚Äìimplicit distinction was introduced during the 1980s, the sort of contrast that it captures is not new; related distinctions between conscious and unconscious memories, to take just one example, have been around for more than a century (for historical considerations, see Roediger, 1990b; Schacter, 1987). The critical development during the past decade has been the systematic demonstration, exploration, and attempted explanation of dissociations between explicit and implicit memory. Some of these dissociations have been provided by experiments demonstrating that brain-damaged amnesic patients with severe impairments of explicit memory can exhibit intact implicit memory; others come from studies showing that specific experimental variables produce different and even opposite effects on explicit and implicit memory tasks. The discovery of implicit memory was made by Warrington and Weiskrantz (1974) who studied with priming experiments patients affected by Korsakov's amnesia, in which the structures of explicit memory are damaged. Subsequently, the procedural dimension of implicit memory has been confirmed. As well as this, the emotional and affective dimension of implicit memory is of particular interest for psychoanalysis. It is linked to the earliest, most significant experiences of the infant with the mother and the surrounding environment. =Activation processing= Activation processing is one of two parts in Mandler's dual processing theory. According to Mandler, there are two processes that operate on mental representations. The first is activation, where increased activity causes a memory to be more distinctive. This increases the familiarity component of the memory, which explains results from priming effects. The second is elaboration, which is a conscious memory used to encode explicit memories that involves activation, but also creating new relationships amongst existing memories. =Multiple memory system= The multiple memory system theory ascribes the differences in implicit and explicit memory to the differences in the underlying structures. The theory says that explicit memories are associated with a declarative memory system responsible for the formation of new representations or data structures. In contrast, implicit memories are associated with a procedural memory system where memories are just modifications of existing procedures or processing operations. Progress in identifying the structures and connections that make up the medial temporal lobe memory system has been paralleled by gains in understanding how this system participates in memory functions. An important step in this achievement was the insight that the hippocampal formation is important for only a particular kind of memory. The implication was that memory is not a single entity but consists of multiple processes or systems. Converging evidence about the selective role of the hippocampal formation in memory is now available from rats, monkeys, and humans. It took time for the idea of multiple memory systems to become firmly established. In 1962, the severely impaired amnesic patient H. M. was reported to be capable of day-to- day improvement in a hand‚Äìeye coordination skill, despite having no memory for the practice sessions (Milner, 1962). Nevertheless, subsequent discussions of memory in general and amnesia in particular tended to set aside motor skill learning and to focus on the unitary nature of the rest of memory. Amnesia was considered to impair memory globally, with the recognition that an exception should be made for motor skills. Memory as tool vs. memory as object Jacoby and Kelly posited that memory could serve as both an object and a tool. Memory is treated as an object in recall or recognition; it can be inspected and described to others. In this case, the focus is on the past. However, memory (from the past) can be used as a tool to perceive and interpret present events. When riding a bicycle, one's focus is on travelling down the road, rather than the specifics of keeping balance. A bicyclist may not even be able to specify the particulars of balancing. In this case, the past memory of keeping one's balance serves as a tool rather than an object. When used as a tool, the use of a memory is unconscious because the focus is not on the past, but on the present that is being aided by the past memory. Memory can serve as a tool even when one is unable to recall or recognize the influence of the past memory. This distinction between the two functions of memory set the stage for understanding the role of unconscious (or implicit) memory.  Illusion-of-truth effect  The illusion-of-truth effect states that a person is more likely to believe a familiar statement than an unfamiliar one. In a 1977 experiment participants were asked to read 60 plausible statements every two weeks and to rate them based on their validity. A few of those statements (some of them true, others false) were presented more than once in different sessions. Results showed that participants were more likely to rate as true statements the ones they had previously heard (even if they didn't consciously remember having heard them), regardless of the actual validity of the statement. As the illusion-of-truth effect occurs even without explicit knowledge, it is a direct result of implicit memory. Some participants rated previously heard sentences as true even when they were previously told that they were false. The illusion-of-truth effect shows in some ways the potential dangers of implicit memory as it can lead to unconscious decisions about a statement's veracity.  Procedural memory  A form of implicit memory used every day is called procedural memory. Procedural memory lets us perform some actions (such as writing or riding a bike) even if we are not consciously thinking about it. In one experiment two groups of people, one composed of amnesic patients with heavily impaired long-term memory, and the other composed by healthy subjects, were asked several times to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle (a complex problem-solving game that requires thirty-one steps to complete). The first group showed the same improvements over time as the second group, even if some participants claimed that they didn't even remember having seen the puzzle before. These findings strongly suggest that procedural memory is completely independent from declarative memory. In another experiment two groups of people were given a flavored carbonated drink. The first group was later exposed to motion sickness, and these participants developed a taste aversion against the carbonated drink, even if they were made aware that the drink didn't lead to the motion sickness. This shows that there appears to be an implicit, procedural memory that subconsciously links the sickness and the drink flavor. It is debated whether implicit attitudes (that is, attitudes people have without being consciously aware of them) belong under the category of implicit memory or if this merely involves a pragmatic approach to asserting knowledge. In some ways, implicit attitudes resemble procedural memory as they rely on an implicit, unconscious piece of knowledge that was previously learned. = Declarative and Procedural memory on language acquisition = Given the potential implication of declarative and procedural memory on language acquisition present on individuals; researchers believe that learning by experience and representations (factual) of the surrounding world is often accompanied by motor and cognitive skills individuals may do in their habit learning area. These types of memory are contained in specific structures that range from neocortical regions to temporal lobe structures. In order to understand the individual references on learning a language on individual adults Morgan-Short et al (2014) designed a study that included seven test sessions in which ‚Äúcognitive, measures of declarative and procedural learning, intelligence, language training, practice (grammar), artificial language practice, and assessment sessions‚Äù. In this experiment all participants knew only one language (English). Further results on the experiment demonstrated that language learning ability are potentially present on declarative and procedural learning. The study showed that ‚Äúdeclarative memory was more associated with the rules and syntactic meaning of the words in the early language acquisition process‚Äù whereas, procedural memory was associated with the latter stages. This experiment can show new light about the different outcomes of language acquisition and grammatical development in learners.  Evidence for the separation of implicit and explicit memory  Evidence strongly suggests that implicit memory is largely distinct from explicit memory and operates through a different process in the brain. Recently, interest has been directed towards studying these differences, most notably by studying amnesic patients and the effect of priming. = Implicit memory in amnesic patients = The strongest evidence that suggests a separation of implicit and explicit memory focuses on studies of amnesic patients. As was previously discussed in the section on procedural memory, amnesic patients showed unimpaired ability to learn tasks and procedures that do not rely on explicit memory. In one study, amnesic patients showed a severely impaired ability in verbal long-term memory, but no impairment in their memory for learning how to solve a certain motor task called a pursuit rotor. Patients showed this improvement over time even while claiming on each occasion to have never seen the puzzle before. This result indicates that the mechanism for long-term declarative memory does not have a similar effect on implicit memory. Furthermore, studies on priming in amnesic patients also reveal the possibility of an intact implicit memory despite a severely impaired explicit memory. For example, amnesic patients and a control group showed similar improvements in word completion as a result of priming, even if they had no memory of being involved in a previous test. That priming occurs without the involvement of explicit memory again suggests that the two types of memory have different functions in the brain. In amnesia, damage has occurred to the hippocampus, or related structures, and the capacity is lost for one kind of neuroplasticity (LTP in hippocampus) and for one kind of memory. The fact that residual learning abilities are accomplished implicitly could be taken to mean that nothing at all has been lost except the ability to engage in conscious remembering. However, by analogy to the loss of form vision in blindsight, it is suggested here that a specific ability has also been lost in amnesia. What has been lost is the ability to store a particular kind of memory, a kind of memory that is flexible and available to conscious recollection. The tradition of work with amnesic patients explains why the idea of multiple memory systems led naturally to a consideration of what kind of memory depends on the integrity of the brain structures, including hippocampus, that are damaged in amnesia. In addition, the idea that the hippocampus might be involved in only one kind of memory appeared independently in the animal literature, on the basis of the selective effects of limbic lesions (Gaffan, 1974; Hirsch, 1974; O'Keefe & Nadel, 1978; Olton et al., 1979). The sections that follow suggest that the findings from humans and experimental animals, including rats and monkeys, are now in substantial agreement about the kind of memory that depends specifically on the hippocampus and related structures. = Process dissociation method = Process dissociation is a framework proposed by L. L. Jacoby as a procedure to separate the contributions of different types of processes to performance of a task. This method uses the 'dissociation' paradigm of comparing performance on two tasks. Jacoby employed this technique in his false fame experiment. Participants in this experiment were provided a list of names in the first session. In the second session, participants were given one of the two kinds of tasks. In the 'exclusion task', participants were told that none of the names they read in session one belonged to famous people and they should respond \\"no\\" when judging fame in the second session. In the 'inclusion task' condition, participants were informed that the names from the first session were famous but obscure and they should respond \\"yes\\" for famous if they remember a name from the first session or otherwise know it to be famous. Theoretically, the probability of saying \\"yes\\" in the exclusion condition is the probability of the name being remembered only unconsciously. The probability of saying \\"yes\\" in the inclusion condition was the probability of a name being remembered either consciously or unconsciously. Comparison of these two yields an estimate of conscious influences. The process dissociation procedure provides a general framework for separating the influences of automatic processes from the intentional processes and can be applied to a variety of domains. Later, Visser & Merikle also employed the process dissociation method to demonstrate the effects of motivation on conscious and unconscious processes. = Double Dissociation on Explicit and Implicit memory = The neural components of memory have demonstrated to be extensive in its operating characteristics. In order to obtain more information on the different memory systems that exist within the brain, research done by Gabrieli et al (1995) used the cases of patients with brain injuries associated with the recollection of explicit and implicit memories. This premise led investigators to create different functional neural components that seek to explain the activation of memory (explicit and implicit) in the human brain. (#) (1) The existent possibility of one homogeneous system in the brain in matters of memory performance and that explicit memory has more representability in terms of neural resources than implicit memory. (2) The implicit memory process constitutes a different subsystem from explicit memory, however as these processes differ in the internal organization of its functions, they both share relation on how interrelated they are. Results on patients with traumatic brain injuries demonstrated that the neural architecture of the brain can be separated at the time of studying how the memory systems differ at the time of using ‚Äúmemory recalling visual implicit memory‚Äù , ‚Äúexplicit memory for words‚Äù and ‚Äúconceptual implicit memory for words‚Äù = Other evidence for differences between implicit and explicit memory = Besides the study of amnesic patients, other evidence also indicates a separation between implicit and explicit memory. Basic patterns that exist for explicit memory development do not apply to implicit memory, implying that the two are two different processes. Children tested at various increasing ages, in different stages of development, do not exhibit the same increase in performance in implicit memory tasks the way they always do with explicit memory tasks. The same is true for elderly people. Studies show that as people grow older, their performance on explicit memory tasks declines, however their performance on implicit memory tasks does not decline at all. Neuropsychology has used imaging techniques such as PET (positron emission tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) to study brain-injured patients, and has shown that explicit memory relies on the integrity of the medial temporal lobe (rhinal, perirhinal and parahippocampal cortex), the frontal‚Äìbasal areas and the bilateral functionality of the hippocampus. The amygdala is mainly responsible for the emotional component in the process of information storage (see Gazzaniga, 1999; Mancia, 2000b, 2004, in press), and can modulate both the encoding and the storage of hippocampal-dependent memories (Phelps, 2004). Implicit memory, by contrast, is not conscious and concerns data that can be neither remembered nor verbalized. It presides over the learning of various skills: a) priming, which is the ability of an individual to choose an object to which he has previously been exposed subliminally; b) procedural memory, which concerns cognitive and sensorimotor experiences such as motor skills learning, everyday activities, playing instruments or playing certain sports: c) emotive and affective memory, which concerns emotional experiences, as well as the phantasies and defences linked to the first relations of the child with the environment and in particular with the mother. Implicit memory does not depend on explicit memory. Notions of unconscious memory are related to the concept of implicit memory (J. Breuer, Z. Freud The Study of Hysteria).Jacoby, L. L., & Witherspoon. D. Remembering without awareness. Canadian Journal of Psychology. (1982) Many experiments have been performed to demonstrate the differences between implicit and explicit memory. One such method of differentiation is revealed through the depth-of-processing effect. In a 1981 study by Jacoby and Dallas, subjects were first given a list of words and asked to engage with them in some way. For some of these words, subjects were asked to interact with the words in a relatively superficial way, such as counting the number of letters in each given word. For one set of words, subjects performed tasks that required elaborative processing (denotation), such as answering questions about a word's meaning. They were then given a test that assessed their ability to recognize whether they had seen the word in the studying part of the experiment. Because depth of processing aids in the explicit memory of a word, subjects showed better memory for the words that required elaborative processing on this test. When implicit memory was tested through flashing words on a screen and asking subjects to identify them, however, the priming effect was extremely similar for the words that involved elaborative processing as compared to the words that did not. This suggests that implicit memory does not rely on depth of processing as explicit memory does. The same study also tested the effect on memory by priming the words via an auditory test and then testing through visual stimuli. In this case, there was little decline in the priming effect when patients were tested explicitly by merely being asked whether they recognized hearing the word in the first part of the experiment. On the word identification test of implicit memory, however, the priming effect was severely reduced by the change in modality from the studying part to the testing part. Both implicit and explicit memory experiences can be present in transference, influencing each other just as they do in the normal development of the infantile mind (Siegel, 1999). If the work on implicit memory can facilitate the emergence of phantasies and memories stored in the explicit memory, so the work of reconstruction, which relies on the autobiographic memory, can facilitate the emergence in the transference and in the dreams of the most archaic experiences, with their relevant phantasies and defences, stored in the implicit memory of the patient. This corresponds to Davis's (2001) description of declarative and non-declarative processes in the psychoanalytic perspective. A later study showed that attempts to interfere with the memory of a list of words significantly impacted subjects' ability to recognize the words in a test of explicit recognition, but the interference did not have a similar effect on the subject's implicit memory of the words. Also, there seems to be no statistical correlation between a person's ability to explicitly remember a list of words and their ability to subconsciously use the priming effect to aid performance in identifying previously seen words in tests of word completion. All of these results strongly indicate that implicit memory not only exists, but exists as its own entity, with its own processes that significantly differ from explicit memory. One of the key findings from the foregoing research that implies a fundamental difference between implicit and explicit memory is provided by studies that have examined the effects of elaborative processing on these two forms of memory. It is well known that explicit recall and recognition benefit substantially from semantic elaboration during study (e.g., Craik & Tulving, 1975; Jacoby & Craik, 1979). In contrast, the results of several experiments suggest that performance on implicit memory tests does not benefit from elaborative processing relative to nonelaborative processing. This finding was observed initially with a word- identification task, which requires subjects to identify words from extremely brief presentations (Jacoby & Dallas, 1981), and has since been demonstrated with various other implicit memory tests. For example, on a word-completion task, which requires completing fragments of recently presented words and new words (e.g., rea___ for reason), the magnitude of priming effects is comparable after an elaborative study task (e.g., rating the pleasantness of a word) and a nonelaborative study task (e.g., counting the number of vowels in a word; Graf et al., 1982). Similarly, when subjects study linguistic idioms (e.g., sour grapes) and are then given a free association test (e.g., sour‚Äî?), they show similar amounts of priming following elaborative and nonelaborative study tasks (Schacter, 1985b). Finally, it has also been demonstrated that elaborative versus nonelaborative processing activities have little or no influence on priming effects in a lexical decision task (Carroll & Kirsner, 1982).

Real 'unsecured' offshore credit cards with credit lines are very difficult for the average person to obtain because banks refuse to issue them. Most banks will need possession of reliable credit histories and a means of getting their money back. If a customer is somewhere 'offshore' the risk of extending a credit line is too great and so as a result these cards are only issued to clients that have long standing relationships with the bank in question. Therefore, an 'unsecured' offshore credit card advertised online may be a scam.http://www.quatloos.com/offscams/uncards.htm Secured cards Since most banks will not offer credit lines without some kind of security, they offer 'secured' offshore credit cards as an alternative. Secured offshore credit cards involve depositing a certain amount (usually 125-150% of the credit line) to cover what you borrow. For a credit line of 20,000 USD for example, a deposit of 25,000-30,000 USD may be required. This aside, the card operates to all intents and purposes like a normal credit card, and most carry a major label such as Visa or Mastercard. Debit cards Another type of card often marketed as a credit card is an offshore debit card. Offshore debit cards are linked to an offshore bank account and do not involve any extensions of credit whatsoever.

Dwindling endowments from wealthy patrons forced some museums to make difficult and controversial decisions to deaccession artwork from their collections to gain funds, or in the case of the Rose Art Museum, to close the institution and sell the entire collection. Such actions have prompted censure from Museum organizations such as the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council in the UK and the Association of Art Museum Directors in the US. These organizations charge that the actions of their members were in violation of not only their ethics code but also the core of their mission- to provide access to a fund of cultural heritage for future scholarship- by selling works to private buyers for purposes other than funding new acquisitions. Consideration of the dire financial state of these institutions, and the intensifying effect that any punitive action by an ethics organization will have on the finances of an individual museum, has fostered debate on the merits of deaccessioning.

The Ensemble Musikfabrik (music factory ensemble) is an ensemble for contemporary classical music located in Cologne. Their official name is Ensemble Musikfabrik Landesensemble NRW e.V. (Ensemble Musikfabrik of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, registered association). Overview Ensemble Musikfabrik was founded in 1990, and is regarded as one of the leading ensembles for contemporary music. As the name suggests, musikFabrik is especially dedicated to artistic innovation. New and in their medial form unknown works that they have often commissioned are their actual production area. The results of this work, frequently in a close collaboration with the composers, are presented by the ensemble of international soloists in 80 to 100 concerts a year in Germany and abroad in festivals and in their own world Premi√®re series \\"Musikfabrik in WDR\\" along with regular radio and CD productions. The Ensemble Musikfabrik is supported by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. History They gave their debut under the name ‚ÄûEnsemble Neue Musik Nordrhein-Westfalen‚Äú, 28 April 1991, at the Wittener Tage f√ºr neue Kammermusik (Witten Days for new chamber music). The formation of the ensemble took place at the end of 1990. The founders of the ensemble, Bernhard Wambach, Nicolaus A. Huber, and Gerhard St√§bler and the designated conductor and artistic director Johannes Kalitzke selected and summoned almost 20 musicians and presented the proposed project. Most of the musicians present were excited about the idea of forming a full-time professional ensemble that would be working on contemporary music and programs in close collaboration with composers.Interview mit Thomas Oesterdiekhoff (in German) Since 1997, the ensemble has organised itself and made all important artistic decisions within its own ranks. The emphasis shifted then from North Rhine-Westphalian composers to a more international focus.Wieschollek, Dirk: Erfolgreich als Kollektiv, in: FonoForum 08/06, pages 59, 60. Founded after the Amsterdam Asko Ensemble (formed 1965), the London Sinfonietta (1968), the Schoenberg Ensemble (Den Haag, 1974), Ensemble InterContemporain (Paris, 1976), Ensemble Modern (Frankfurt, 1980), Klangforum Wien (Vienna) and Freiburg's ensemble recherche (both 1985), Ensemble Musikfabrik is one of the youngest leading New Music ensembles in the world.Mosch, Ulrich: Ensemble - zusammen, in: Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde Donaueschingen e.V. (eds.), Donaueschinger Musiktage 2008, pages 44, 48 f. In 2003, Ensemble Musikfabrik moved from D√ºsseldorf to Cologne. Thanks to generous support from the Kunststiftung NRW, WDR (West German Radio) and K√∂lnMusik, musikFabrik has now a highly successful world Premi√®re concert series \\"musikFabrik in WDR‚Äú. MusikFabrik prepares for these concerts and for other projects in their new domicile in the KOMED building in MediaPark (Cologne), where they moved in the summer of 2008. Profile The musicians of Ensemble Musikfabrik have collaborated with both the younger generation of conductors, composers, directors and choreographers as well as the more renowned ones. The guest list of the ensemble includes Mark Andre, Louis Andriessen, Stefan Asbury, Oscar Bettison, Sir Harrison Birtwistle, Unsuk Chin, P√©ter E√∂tv√∂s, Brian Ferneyhough, Heiner Goebbels, Toshio Hosokawa, Michael Jarrell, Mauricio Kagel, Helmut Lachenmann, David Lang, Liza Lim, Benedict Mason, Mouse on Mars, Carlus Padrissa (La Fura dels Baus), Emilio Pom√†rico, Enno Poppe, Wolfgang Rihm, Peter Rundel, Rebecca Saunders, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Ilan Volkov and Sasha Waltz. The experimentation and implementation with modern forms of communication, experimental electronics, dance, theatre, film, literature, and creative arts broaden the conventional form of a conducted ensemble concert along with chamber music and the frequent confrontation with works that have an open form and include improvisation. Lecture discussion concerts and experimenting with a concert form that allows the integration of audience participation belong to these ideas.

Recorded mainly at guitarist and producer Chad I Ginsburg's Studio CIG Pennsylvania in New Hope, Pennsylvania, it was released on May 19, 2009 by Roadrunner Records. The album reached number 46 on the US Billboard 200, number four on the Hard Rock Albums chart, and number 14 on the Rock Albums chart. Written by vocalist and guitarist Deron Miller with Ginsburg, Carver City is often billed as a concept album about the fictional eponymous town, which is said to be a holiday resort plagued by crime. This has been compared to the band's own fictional storyline of \\"Hellview\\". It is the first CKY album to feature bassist Matt Deis, who joined the band shortly after the release of 2005's An Answer Can Be Found, and the last to feature vocalist and guitarist Deron Miller, who left the band in 2011. The writing and recording of the album took over two years to complete, with internal tensions between band members slowing progress at various points in the process. Carver City was a success both commercially and critically, with reviewers praising the high production values and experimental nature of the songs on the album. \\"Hellions on Parade\\" and \\"A#1 Roller Rager\\" were released as singles. Recording and production Most of the recording for Carver City took place at guitarist and producer Chad I Ginsburg's Studio CIG Pennsylvania in New Hope, Pennsylvania, with additional parts recorded at Studio 4 in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania and 4th Street Recording in Santa Monica, California. The album was mixed at Studio 4 and Studio CIG by Ginsburg and Phil Nicolo, and mastered at Masterdisk in New York City by Howie Weinberg. According to the album's liner notes, recording started in January 2007 and was completed by December 2008. The production of Carver City was plagued by a number of problems, including disagreements between band members. In October 2007, Ginsburg claimed that Miller had left the band after it was reported that a \\"physical altercation\\" had broken about. Miller explained that he had confronted Ginsburg and Margera after he heard them say some \\"extremely personal, painful things\\" about him, and that he was considering returning to the group after dealing with his increasing problems with alcohol abuse. After almost a year of inactivity, it was reported in October 2008 that CKY was back together, with Miller claiming that the band was \\"98% done tracking\\" Carver City. Miller reflected on the production process of the album prior to its release, stating that \\"Sobriety, hard work, patching up inner turmoil and a love for what we do has undoubtedly made this the most collaborative and focused CKY effort to date\\". He attributed many of the problems to \\"alcohol and shit talking\\" and explained that much of the album was recorded by individual band members in isolation, with the group sharing recordings by email. \\"Hellions on Parade\\" was originally titled \\"Hellview III: Hellions on Parade\\", \\"Karmaworks\\" was originally known as \\"Karma Works Its Way\\", \\"Stripped Your Speech\\" was originally named \\"Underappreciated\\", and other track titles included \\"Making Contact\\" and \\"There's Two of Me\\". \\"Plagued by Images\\" is a reworked version of the song \\"Dropped\\", which was recorded back when CKY was still called oiL. In a 2015 interview, Miller claimed that he and Ginsburg began working on an early version of \\"Afterworld\\" during sessions for Carver City, but didn't complete the track in time. Additionally, he claimed that bassist Matt Deis wrote at least one song for the album, but that Ginsburg opposed its inclusion as he had not contributed a song as well. Promotion and release The title and release date of Carver City were confirmed in January 2009, with Ginsburg describing the album as \\"more inventive and more layered than our past releases, with the most melodies, textures and riffs of any CKY album ... by far the most inspired album we have ever made\\". The album cover artwork, designed by Travis Smith, was revealed in March. The first song released from the album was lead single \\"Hellions on Parade\\", which the band made available for free download in April 2009, before its release later in the month. The full album was streamed exclusively on the website Noisecreep ahead of its release. \\"A#1 Roller Rager\\" was released as the second single from the album on May 4. In promotion of the album CKY toured extensively, beginning with a North American headline tour in June 2009. The group was supported by ASG and Graveyard on the tour, which ran until August and ended with a \\"hometown show\\" in Philadelphia. The band continued touring throughout the rest of the year, visiting a number of countries in Europe in November, and later played their first two shows in Japan as part of the Taste of Chaos tour alongside In Flames and Atreyu. Carver City is the band's first and only album to be released by Roadrunner Records, with whom they signed in December 2006. Composition=Lyrics= The lyrics of the songs on Carver City are largely focused around the story of a fictional town of the same name. Speaking at the time of the album's announcement, primary songwriter Miller offered the following description of the concept: \\"The fabled town of Carver City has a history of bad luck and misfortune, all the while giving the impression that it's a pleasant family getaway. Much like CKY's town of Hellview, Carver City's events are depicted in the songs, with story lines coming from real-life events.\\" Adding more detail to the concept, it was noted in an interview with the website Noisecreep that the city is named after a fisherman who killed his crew and later returns to \\"curse the city\\", leaving residents trapped; Miller has revealed that this is intended to be \\"pretty symbolic of where we are today with the economy\\". The album opens with \\"Hellions on Parade\\", which is the third entry in the band's own \\"Hellview\\" storyline, which started with Volume 1's \\"96 Quite Bitter Beings\\" and Infiltrate‚Ä¢Destroy‚Ä¢Rebuild's \\"Escape from Hellview\\". Miller describes Hellview as \\"a town that doesn't take kindly to outsiders\\", explaining that \\"[Hellions on Parade] is about Hellview destroying its rival city\\". One of the focal tracks of the Carver City story is said to be \\"The Boardwalk Body\\", which was written by Miller based on a true story wherein a dead body was discovered during one of his family holidays in Wildwood, New Jersey. Speaking about the story, the vocalist and guitarist noted that it happened when he was \\"11 or 12\\" years old and described it as \\"a really bizarre period of learning for me\\". Lana Cooper of the website PopMatters has proposed that the song is a sequel to an earlier track on the album, \\"...And She Never Returned\\", in which a young woman goes missing and is never found, presumed to be murdered. =Music= Musically, Carver City has been noted for its experimental nature and difference from the band's previous releases. In his review of the album, AllMusic's Phil Freeman noted the prominence of synthesizers on many of the songs, which with other elements he claimed made the band sound \\"bizarre ... weird ... [and] unique\\". Similarly, Cooper of PopMatters claimed that \\"Carver City finds CKY miles away from the sophomoric sounds of their demos ... as well as that of their last disc, 2005's An Answer Can Be Found. She also highlighted the use of synthesizers on the album, describing that they \\"add to the eerie atmosphere and sound almost like a second guitar\\". Other critics, however, compared Carver City to preceding CKY albums. Blabbermouth.net's review claimed that \\"this is classic CKY, to the point that most of these songs would fit seamlessly on the band's previous albums\\", highlighting \\"Plagued by Images\\" and \\"Karmaworks\\" in particular as reminiscent of the band's older material. Reception=Commercial= Carver City was the third album released by CKY to register on a music chart, reaching number 46 on the US Billboard 200. The album was also the band's first to chart on the Billboard Hard Rock Albums chart, on which it reached number four, and the Billboard Rock Albums chart, on which it reached number 14. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album sold approximately 11,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release. According to Miller, as of August 2015 the album has sold over 37,000 copies, making it the lowest-selling CKY studio album. =Critical= Media response to Carver City was generally positive. Freeman of AllMusic applauded the band for being \\"smart and unique\\" on the album, praising elements such as the use of synthesizers and \\"seriously heavy\\" guitar riffs, especially on the tracks \\"Rats in the Infirmary\\", \\"Woe Is Me\\" and \\"A#1 Roller Rager\\". Cooper of PopMatters praised the release in comparison to its predecessor, An Answer Can Be Found, by claiming that it \\"strikes the right mix of theme and variety while offering a much more polished version of the sound that brought them to the dance\\". She went on to describe the style of the album as akin to \\"grandiose ‚Äò80s thrash- and power-metal with a modern sensibility\\", praising the contribution of bassist Matt Deis. Amy Sciarretto of Ultimate Guitar Archive praised the genre-defying and \\"twist[ing] and turn[ing]\\" nature of the songs. Some reviewers did, however, criticise the lack of variety on the album. Blabbermouth.net's review criticised Carver City for featuring many songs which are similar to those released on previous albums, concluding that it has \\"just a couple too many uninspired songs\\". Similarly, Rock Sound noted that the album's style was \\"a familiar realm\\", but continued by describing it as \\"better focused, clearer sounding rock\\".

Her parents were Alexandre Jean Baptiste Philippart and Marie Travers. When Georgette was six years old, her father died fighting off the German Army in the Battle of the Marne World War I on 7 September 1914. Before his passing, he sent a letter home, where he recognized Georgette Marie as his daughter. Because of the war, she was sent to Brittany where she completed her elementary education in Vitr√©. She continued her secondary education in the Sevign√© School in Vitr√©, and graduated in 1922. Upon the completion of her studies, she moved to Par√≠s to work in a seamstress shop with her mother. In 1925, she began one of the most interesting moments of her life: A fortune-teller read her destiny and announced that a \\"Prince Charming would come from afar. He has crossed the seas. He is ugly, but is a luminary being. You will always be the first person on his mind.\\". The famous and long-awaited \\"Prince Charming\\" was no one less than a man, who with the passage of time would become a leader in world literature: C√©sar Abraham Vallejo Mendoza. The 31-year-old poet had come to Paris on 13 July 1923, and was writing in the \\"Grands journaux Ibero- Americaines,\\" living on Moli√®re Street, where he would first see Georgette from a window in the front of his room. Although she was only 17, she made a huge impression on him. In 1927 when Cesar Vallejo eventually talked to her he was much older and lived in her neighborhood. This was also the year of his first trip to Russia. The two eventually became lovers, much to the dismay of her mother. Georgette traveled with Vallejo to Spain the end of December 1930 and returned in January 1932, when she became very ill and required an operation. Back in Paris Vallejo married Georgette Philippart in 1934.

Note: The date indicated is that of the official announcement by the department or the public agency in charge of the measurement of the economic activity of the country. Thus, because of possible lags in the collection of statistics, it is possible that the chronological order of reports may not correspond to the actual order of events in recession. Definition of recession A recession is a period of two quarters of negative GDP growth. The countries listed are those that officially announced that they were in recession. It is worth noting that some developed countries such as South Korea and Australia did not enter recession (indeed Australia contracted for the last quarter of 2008 only to grow 1% for the first half of 2009). Poland, then considered to be an emerging market country, also avoided the recession as a result of their strong domestic market, low private debt and flexible currency. Timeline overview2008=July= *July 1, 2008: Denmark Denmark becomes the first European economy to confirm it is in recession since the global credit crunch began. Its GDP shrinks 0.6% in the first quarter after a 0.2% contraction in the fourth quarter of 2007. =August= *August 13, 2008: Estonia The Baltic state slides into recession with a 0.9% fall in second- quarter GDP after a drop of 0.5% in the first quarter. It falls deeper into recession in the third quarter when the economy contracted 3.3%. =September= *September 8, 2008: Latvia Latvia joins its northern neighbor Estonia in recession as GDP falls 0.2% in the second quarter from the first quarter, when it fell 0.3%. Property markets and construction have suffered in both Baltic states. *September 25, 2008: Ireland The \\"Celtic Tiger\\" slides into recession for the first time in over two decades, recording a 0.5% fall in second quarter GDP, following a 0.3% decline in the first quarter. Its last recession in 1983 saw thousands of people leave Ireland to seek work overseas. =October= *October 10, 2008: Singapore First Asian country to slip into a recession since the credit crisis began. Singapore's export-dependent economy shrank an annualized 6.3% in the third quarter after a revised 5.7% contraction in the second quarter; its first recession since 2002. Growth has faltered in Singapore as a result of less demand for exports, a reduction in tourism, and the end of the real-estate boom. Singapore's manufacturing sector had declined 4.9% in the previous quarter. *October 24, 2008: Iceland Iceland receives a ¬£1.3 billion (US$2.06 billion, ‚Ç¨1.63 billion) bailout package from the International Monetary Fund as the first European country to require an emergency loan with the aim of stabilising the collapsed currency and strengthening the tax system as well as the nationalised banks. *October 27, 2008: Australia The banking group BNP Paribas states that Australia is in a risky position with regards to the global financial crisis as foreign liabilities accounted for 60% of the nation's GDP. *October 28, 2008 United Kingdom 500,000 mortgage holders are left in negative equity after house prices dropped 15% since the previous summer, with another 700,000 mortgage holders facing the same risk if prices continue to fall. =November= *November 13, 2008: Germany Europe's largest economy contracted by 0.5% in the third quarter after GDP fell 0.4% in the second quarter, putting it in recession for the first time in five years. *November 13, 2008: Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, The Philippines Equity research by Deutsche Bank states that Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines should not experience a recession, despite potential harm to economic growth from falling commodity prices and possible weaker exports. *November 14, 2008: Italy Italy plunges into recession, its first since the start of 2005, after GDP contracts a steeper-than-expected 0.5% in the third quarter. Second quarter GDP dropped 0.3%. *November 14, 2008: Hong Kong Hong Kong becomes the second Asian economy to tip into recession, its exports hit by weakening global demand. Third- quarter GDP drops a seasonally adjusted 0.5% after a 1.4% fall in the previous quarter. *November 14, 2008: Eurozone Taken as a whole the Eurozone officially slips under, pushed down by recessions in Germany and Italy for its first recession since its creation in 1999. These 15 countries are: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain. On January 1, 2009, Slovakia adopted the euro, and so is now part of the Eurozone. Though the Eurozone suffers from recession as a whole, Belgium, France, Greece, and Slovakia still have better growth. *November 17, 2008: Japan The world's second-biggest economy slides into recession, its first in seven years. Its GDP contracts 0.1% in the July‚ÄìSeptember quarter, as the financial crisis curbs demand for its exports. It shrank 0.9% in the previous quarter. *November 23, 2008: Hawaii Economists at the University of Hawaii reported that the state entered the recession in the previous quarter based on the drop in tourist figures and growing unemployment, with 8,800 jobs expected to be cut in 2009. *November 28, 2008: Canada In 2008, Canada had positive GDP growth in Q2 and Q3 but GDP fell by a sharp 3.4% annualized in Q4.

Canada is the only OECD country out of the recession at this time. *November 28, 2008: Sweden Sweden technically enters the recession after experiencing contraction of 0.1% in the second and third quarter. =December= *December 1, 2008: United States The US economy has been in recession since December 2007, the National Bureau of Economic Research announced in December 2008. The bureau is a private research institute widely regarded as the official arbiter of US economic cycles. It said a 73-month economic expansion had come to an end. The Bureau stated that the deteriorating labour market throughout 2008 provided reason to state the commencement of the recession as December 2007. *December 12, 2008: Russia Andrei Klepach, a deputy economics minister of Russia, states that Russia has entered the recession, with two quarters of contraction expected, meaning Russia will fall short of reaching the 6.8% growth forecast for 2008. 2009=January= *January 13, 2009: South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, United States Global shipping experiences a drop in trade, as exports from South Korea dropping an annualised 30%, with Taiwan and Japan experiencing a 42% and 27% drop respectively.

The growth slowed down already in early 2008 and in the third quarter output diminished by 0.3% from the previous quarter. =March= *March 4, 2009: Canada U.S. Steel announced the closure of the Stelco Lake Erie Works in Nanticoke, Ontario due to the increasingly worse effects of the global economic slowdown. While it may have decreased the local pollution levels, it also has affected 12000 jobs both at the Lake Erie Works and in the Haldimand-Norfolk area. *March 4, 2009: Malaysia Malaysia has a 50% chance of slipping into the recession as growth is expected to reach just 0.5% for the year, said the executive director Datuk Mohamed Ariff Abdul Kareem of the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research. =May= *May 15, 2009: France, Austria, Belgium, Romania, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Hungary The French Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies announced that French gross domestic product shrank 1.2% in the first quarter of 2009 after falling by 1.5% in the final quarter of 2008. The French economy had avoided narrowly a recession in 2008. The GDP is expected to keep shrinking in 2009. Eurostat also reported at this time that Austria, Belgium, and Romania had all entered recession in the first quarter of 2009, with two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP, while Lithuania, Luxembourg, and Portugal had already done so in the last quarter of 2008 and Hungary in the quarter before that. *May 19, 2009: Norway Norway's mainland GDP, which excludes the oil and gas sectors and the shipping industry, shrank 1.0% in the three months to March after a 0.8% decline in the final quarter of 2008, with recession counted as two consecutive quarterly figures showing a contraction. Mainland GDP is considered a better indicator of the Scandinavian country's economic health, since the oil and gas sector represents 25% of its economic growth but employs only about one% of its working-age population. Still, Norway's total GDP, which includes the oil, gas and shipping sectors, shrank 0.4% in the first quarter of 2009 after 0.8% growth in the fourth quarter of 2008. *May 20, 2009: Mexico Mexico becomes the first Latin American country to officially enter recession, having its GDP shrink 8.22% in the first quarter of 2009, after falling 1.6% in the final quarter of 2008 and Swine flu concerns. To this date, it is estimated that the Mexican domestic product will shrink 5.5% in 2009. Ministry of Finances Agustin Carstens declared the country in recession on May 7, 2009, based on estimates, which were confirmed when the actual, real data was released on May 20 by INEGI. *May 25, 2009: Thailand Thailand‚Äôs economy shrank more than expected in the first quarter, contracting the most in a decade, plunging the nation into recession. GDP shrank 7.1% in the last quarter of 2008, followed by another shrinking of 4.2% in the first quarter of 2009. According to the Singapore branch of Macquarie Group, the Thai economy is expected to recover in the fourth quarter of 2009. *May 27, 2009: South Africa South Africa entered recession as the global crisis pounded demand for its main exports; GDP shrank 6.4% in the first quarter of 2009 after falling 1.8% in the last quarter of 2008. This is the first recession for South Africa in 17 years. According to forecasts, the South African domestic product is likely to shrink between 1% and 1.5% in 2009. =June= *June 2, 2009: Switzerland Switzerland officially entered a recession in the first quarter of 2009 when its economy shrank by 0.8%, after contracting 0.3% in the last quarter of 2008. The contraction was caused mainly by weakness in exports, which fell 5.4% in the quarter. Meanwhile, the Swiss watch industry had been reporting double-digit declines in watch exports for the past four months. *June 5, 2009: Chile First South American country to enter the recession. *June 9, 2009: Brazil Brazil slipped into a recession in the first quarter of 2009. *June 11, 2009: Bulgaria Bulgarian authorities declare the country is officially in recession after dropping 1.6% in the last quarter of 2008, followed by a 5% drop in the first quarter of 2009. Unemployment is rising rapidly and by September 500,000 people are expected to lose their jobs. Exports are down 50%. For the first three months of 2009 GDP has shrunk by 2%. Households and small businesses are heavily in debt. *June 25, 2009: Colombia Colombia enters into recession after witnessing 0.7% contraction in the last quarter of 2008 and 0.6% in the following quarter. *June 30, 2009: Turkey Turkey recorded its fastest contraction of 13.8% in the first quarter of 2009 compared to 2008, leading the country into recession after a contraction of 6.2% in the last quarter of 2008. This is Turkey's biggest economic slump since 1945. =July= *July 14, 2009: Singapore Singapore experienced a seasonally adjusted and annualised growth of 20.4% in the second quarter as a result of increased pharmaceuticals production and construction, bringing the country out of the recession. *July 23, 2009: Canada On 23 July, the Bank of Canada made comments that most media interpreted as an effective statement predicting with strong certainty that the recession is over with expected growth in GDP beginning the current quarter.Recession in Canada is Over The Bank of Canada announced the end of the recession even though it was nascent and still dependent on government stimulus money. =August= *August 13, 2009: France, Germany The French and German GDP both grew 0.3% in the second quarter of 2009; analysts had not anticipated such a quick recovery. *August 14, 2009: Hong Kong After shrinking 4.3% during January‚ÄìMarch, Hong Kong's GDP grew 3.3% between April and June, improving its GDP forecasts, which went from negative growth between 5.5 and 6.5% to negative growth between 4.5 and 5.5%. Still, comparing the second quarter of 2009 to the second quarter of 2008, Hong Kong's GDP shrank 3.8% in the former. *August 15, 2009: Portugal Portugal leaves recession after three consecutive quarters of negative growth having its GDP recover by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2009. According to the latest estimates by the Bank of Portugal, Portuguese GDP should fall around 3.5% in 2009, which is the worst figure for the country since 1975. *August 15, 2009: Argentina Even though official government sources state that Argentina's GDP will actually grow this year (and have only recognized a GDP shrinking in June of 0.4% and in July, of 0.3%; both compared to last year's same months), private consulting firms state that Argentine economy has actually been in recession since October 2008. According to them, Argentine GDP shrank 2.9% in the last quarter of 2008, 1.6% in the first quarter of 2009, and 0.6% in the second one. It's widely known in Argentina that the official statistics office in charge of producing this information, INDEC, is not very reliable for trustworthy statistical information, due to the government's mismanagement of the office. *August 17, 2009: Japan The Japanese Government informed that after fifteen continuous months of shrinking, and after the most disastrous fall since World War II of 4% between January and March, its GDP grew 3.7% in the second quarter of 2009 in comparison with the same quarter of 2008. In annual terms, Japanese GDP grew 0.9% between April and June. Recovery was mostly contributed to recovering demand in the manufacturing sector with exports growing 6.3%. Consumer spending had only increased by 0.8% in the same period. *August 24, 2009: Thailand Thai GDP grew 2.3% in 2009's second quarter, technically leaving the recession. =September= *September 9, 2009: Cyprus Cyprus enters recession after 0.6% contraction in the first quarter, followed by 0.4% in the second quarter. *September 11, 2009: Brazil The Brazilian economy technically left the recession when GDP grew 1.9% in the second quarter of 2009 after having fallen in the first quarter of 2009 and last quarter of 2008.

The Mexican government also approved a $244 billion budget for 2010, a slight increase from 2009. *November 22, 2009: Venezuela Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez states that the country has entered the recession as the economy contracted 4.5% in the third quarter. *November 24, 2009: South Africa The economy grew an annualised 0.9% in the third-quarter after dropping 7.4% in the second-quarter. The recovery was attributed to government spending and the construction industry. *November 30, 2009: Canada Canada begins its recovery from the recession. Economic growth is at 0.4% after 14 months of economic stagnation. 2010=January= The late-2000s recession has entered its second full year of existence. While many nations have managed to climb out of the recession, employment is still sparse and promises to remain so throughout 2010. *January 10, 2010: Canada Canada continues its long and laborious recovery over its recession. However, people are starting to lose optimism due to the continued job losses. Only Manitoba has managed to create 2000 new jobs while the rest of the nation loses approximately 105,000. The previous month brought in 36,000 new part-time jobs at the expense of 71,000 full-time jobs. *January 10, 2010: United States The US economy is expected to get worse with more job cuts. This will expect to have some ramification with their northern neighbor Canada. *January 12, 2010: Colombia Colombia officially leaves the recession after achieving 2% economic growth in the last quarter of 2009. *January 26, 2010: United Kingdom After 6 consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, the UK economy finally came out of recession with a GDP growth of 0.1%. =February= *February 5, 2010: Canada Employment increased by 43,000 in January, all in part-time, pushing the unemployment rate down 0.1 percentage points to 8.3%. January marks the fourth employment gain in six months. Despite the recent increases, employment still remains 280,000 below the level of October 2008. Employment gains in January were driven by women aged 25 to 54 and youths. This was the first notable increase for youths since the start of the employment downturn in the fall of 2008. There were large increases in part-time employment in January, bringing it back to the level of six months earlier. Full-time employment was little changed in January, but has trended up over the last six months. January's increase was among private sector employees, while self-employment declined. Over the last six months, the number of private and public sector employees has been rising while self-employment has been little changed. The largest employment increases in January occurred in business, building and other support services, and retail and wholesale trade. These were partially offset by losses in professional, scientific, and technical services, as well as agriculture. *February 22, 2010: Taiwan Taiwan's economy exits from the recession with 9.22% growth in the last quarter of 2009 after increased demand from China and other key markets in the region. *February 24, 2010: Eurozone Europe risks a double-dip recession after bad results emerged from France, Germany and Italy. The Eurozone only grew by 0.1% in the last quarter of 2009. =March= *March 2, 2010: Canada The economy is rocketing further away from recession, increasing the chances that the Bank of Canada will lift borrowing costs more aggressively than expected later this year. Economic growth surged an annualized 5% in the fourth quarter, providing the clearest sign yet that a broad-based recovery is taking firm hold. It was the fastest annualized quarterly growth since 2000, and the first solidly positive quarter since the economy entered recession in 2008 amid a global pullback brought on by the financial crisis. The fourth-quarter surge was fuelled by everything from a strong housing sector and healthy consumer spending to a surprise turnaround for net trade as the country's exports grew at almost double the pace of imports, according to Statistics Canada. *March 12, 2010: Canada 21,000 jobs were created in Canada as of February 2010. However, employers are still not hiring people in most places including Stelco and other jobs that are in rural areas like Norfolk County, Ontario. *March 24, 2010: Macedonia Last quarter expansion of 1.2% in 2009 officially brought Macedonia out of the recession. Overall, Macedonia's GDP contracted by 0.7% last year. =April= *April 2, 2010: United States 162,000 jobs were created in the United States, unemployment rate held steady at 9.7%. *April 9, 2010: Canada 17,900 new jobs were created in Canada in the previous month. The trend is moving towards job creation instead of layoffs as seen in late 2008 and most of 2009. Jobs are being created in the private sector while public sector jobs are losing ground. Employment increased marginally in Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. *April 15, 2010: Canada The union vote ratification for Stelco Lake Erie Works was confirmed with 88.5% voting in favor of the three-year deal; keeping the place open for industry. As a result, numerous jobs in the local area were saved by this \\"eleventh hour\\" action. =May= *May 31, 2010: Canada Canadian factories hummed, consumers bought more houses, governments spent more money, prices increased and the economy posted its best quarter of growth in more than 10 years. The Canadian economy expanded at an annualized rate of 6.1% in the first quarter, surpassing analyst expectations and marking the best growth rate since 1999. Economists had expected annualized GDP growth of 5.9% in the last quarter, up from 5% in last year's fourth quarter. The growth in the first quarter is the third straight quarter of economic expansion in Canada, coming on the heels of three consecutive quarters of contraction. March growth came in at 0.6%, ahead of the 0.5% estimate.Canadian economic growth best in 10 years - May 31, 2010 =June= *June 9, 2010: Hungary Hungary leaves the recession after experiencing 0.9% growth in the first quarter as a result of growing exports and effective government spending measures. *June 9, 2010: Finland Finland falls back into a state of recession after GDP contracted 0.4% in Q1 2010 and 0.2% in Q4 2009. The country witnessed negative growth of 7.8% in 2009, being the worst result since 1918. Apart from Luxembourg, Finland maintained EU fiscal policy by keeping debt at 44% of GDP, under the 60% limit. =July= *July 2, 2010: Canada Twenty thousand new jobs were added to Canada's economy. The unemployment rate is expected to have stayed at 8.1%. Economists expect initiated home building was at an annual rate of 192,000 last month, up from 189,100 in May. *July 23, 2010: United Kingdom The ONS released preliminary figures showing that economic growth had accelerated from 0.3% in Q1 2010 to 1.1% in Q2. This is almost double the original forecast of 0.6% growth, and the news is a welcome surprise. In late August, this figure was revised up to 1.2% growth as a result of greater construction output. However, large budget cuts are being put into action by the new coalition government to tackle the ¬£163bn budget deficit that the country faces. =August= *August 6, 2010: Canada From April to June, Canada added a massive 225,000 jobs, over half of all of the year-over-year gains since July 2009, which has nearly brought Canada‚Äôs employment to pre-recession levels. Now that growth is beginning to normalize, employment and gross domestic product growth paused in July. Canada‚Äôs economy shed 9,000 jobs, pushing the employment rate up slightly to 8.0%. The 139,000 full-time jobs lost were largely offset by the 130,000 gained in part-time employment. =September= *September 8, 2010: Egypt Egypt's Minister of Finance, Dr. Youssef Butros Ghali, states that Egypt emerged from the recession as indicated by increased total revenue from sales taxes and customs revenues. *September 10, 2010: Canada Statistics Canada said an additional 36,000 people got jobs in August, but the unemployment rate rose 0.1 percentage points, to 8.1%, as a larger number of people sought work. That raised the number of unemployed by 17,800, to slightly more than 1.5 million. Excluding the bounce in education jobs, employment actually fell by about 32,000, economists at BMO Capital Markets and CIBC said. *September 20, 2010: United States The National Bureau of Economic Research state that the US left the recession in June 2009, with managing director Lakshman Achuthan of the Economic Cycle Research Institute saying GDP recovered to 70% of the pre-recession level. =October= *October 31, 2010: Belgium Belgium leaves the recession with 0.5% growth in the third quarter. =December= * December 7, 2010: Iceland Iceland officially leaves the recession with growth of 1.2% in the third quarter. 2011=January= *January 25, 2011 United Kingdom It was announced the UK economy suffered a shock contraction of 0.5% in the fourth quarter of 2010, which has been widely blamed on the severe winter weather in December and austere budget cuts implemented by the coalition government increasing fears that the UK is heading for a double-dip recession. However, overall economic growth for 2010 was 1.4%. =February= *February 9, 2011 Latvia Latvia leaves deep recession with an annualised growth of 3.7% in the last quarter of 2010, meaning the Latvian economy only shrank by 0.2% in 2010, compared to 18% in 2009. *February 21, 2011 Thailand Thailand's GDP rose 3.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010 after a minor recession caused by GDP contractions of 0.4% in the second quarter and 0.3% in the third quarter of 2010. The growth of the fourth quarter was attributed to a strengthening global economy, along with increasing income levels in the nation and greater liquidity by financial institutions to help the private sector. Full-year growth was recorded at 7.8%. *February 23, 2011 Venezuela Venezuela's economy grew 0.6% in the last quarter of 2010, technically leaving the recession after six quarters. Concern has been expressed by economists with regards to the economy improving due to instability in the private sector pressured by the socialist government, as Jos√© Guerra, former manager at the Central Bank of Venezuela, stated that private investment, accounting for half of Venezuela's GDP, dropped 2.2% in 2010. =March= *March 30, 2011: Wales The global credit information group Experian highlighted in a report that the economic recovery for Wales is slower than the rest of the UK, stating a forecasted growth of 1.6% per year over the next decade as compared to 2.2% for the rest of the United Kingdom. Issues for Wales were attributed to low export rates, an unskilled workforce and low entrepreneurism, leading to less opportunities for growth. =May= *May 5, 2011: Portugal Portugal's Minister of Finance Teixeira dos Santos warns that the upcoming bail-out package of ‚Ç¨78 billion is expected to shift Portugal into recession for at least 2 years. * May 6, 2011: United States The US Department of Labor stated 244,000 jobs were created in April, with 235,000 added in February and 221,000 in March, but unemployment continued to grow, reaching 9%. For unemployment to be reduced to 6%, 13 million private sector jobs must be added over 3 years, meaning annual growth of 4-5% required. * May 13, 2011: Portugal Portugal slips into double-dip recession after the economy contracted by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2011, with a 0.6% contraction in the last quarter of 2010. The European Commission forecast Portugal's GDP will drop 2.2% in 2011, followed by a 1.8% drop in 2012, along with public debt to reach 101.7% of GDP in 2011 and 107.4% of GDP in 2012. *May 13, 2011: Romania Romania officially leaves the recession after 2 years following economic growth of an annualised 1.6% in the first quarter. =June= * June 24, 2011: Canada, China, European Union, United States As house prices remain low in the US housing market, significant foreign purchases have been made by the Canadians, Chinese and Europeans (mainly French, Spanish and Italian), seeing total spending around US$16 billion. Housing prices fell 3% in the first quarter of the year, seeing housing sales increase 5.1% in March. *June 24, 2011: Scotland Recovery for Scotland from the recession is stifled by the risk of stagnation from a weak rate of recovery in exports and business investments. =July= *July 27, 2011: United Kingdom After figures showed that the 0.5% contraction in Q4 2010 was cancelled out by a 0.5% rise in Q1 2011, growth estimates from the ONS suggest that the growth in the UK is slowing down, after figures of 0.2% GDP increase was posted.

Emperor Ojin, who was deified as Hachiman-jin (the tutelary god of warriors), is said to be enshrined in all the sites dedicated to him; and the first and earliest of these was at Usa in the early 8th century.Japan National Tourist Organization (JNTO): Usa-jing≈´ shrine The Usa Jing≈´ has long been the recipient of Imperial patronage; and its prestige is considered second only to that of Ise.Hardacre, Helen. (1989). Shinto and the State, 1868-1988, p. 12. History The shrine was founded in Kyushu during the Nara period. Ancient records place the foundation of Usa Jing≈´ in the Wad≈ç era (708-714).Ponsonby- Fane, Richard. (1962). Studies in Shinto and Shrines, p. 195. A temple called Miroku-ji was built next to it in 779, making it what is believed to be the first shrine-temple (jing≈´-ji) ever. The resulting mixed complex, called , lasted over a millennium until 1868, when the Buddhist part was removed to comply with the Kami and Buddhas Separation Act. It is today the center from which over 40,000 branch Hachiman shrines have grown.Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MLIT): Usa Jinju Shrine Usa's Hachiman shrine first appears in the chronicles of Imperial history during the reign of Empress Sh≈çtoku. The empress allegedly had an affair with a Buddhist monk named D≈çky≈ç. An oracle was said to have proclaimed that the monk should be made emperor; and the kami Hachiman at Usa was consulted for verification. The empress died before anything further could develop.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). Annales des empereurs du japon, pp. 78-81; Brown, Delmer etal. (1993).

In the 16th century, the temple was razed to the ground and repeatedly attacked by the Christian-sympathizing lord of Funai ≈åtomo Yoshishige. The wife of Yoshishige, ≈åtomo-Nata Jezebel was the High Priestess alongside Nara Clan and resisted against her former husband's attacks..

The Imperial House of Japan, pp. 124-126. =Mikoshi= The earliest recorded use of a mikoshi was in the 8th century. In 749, the shrine's mikoshi was used to carry the spirit of Hachiman from Kyushu to Nara, where the deity was to guard construction of the great Daibutsu at T≈çdai-ji. By the 10th century, carrying mikoshi into the community during shrine festivals had become a conventional practice.Tsubaki Grand Shrine of America: Omikoshi procession =Branch shrines= Over the course of centuries, a vast number of Hachiman shrines have extended the reach of the kami at Usa: In 859, a branch offshoot was established to spread Hachiman's protective influence over Kyoto; and this Iwashimizu Hachimang≈´ still draws worshipers and tourists today. In 923, the Hakozaki-g≈´ was established at Fukuoka as a branch of the Usa Shrine.Fukuoka/Hakata Tourist Information website: Hakozaki Shrine In 1063, Tsurugaoka Hachimang≈´ was established by Minamoto no Yoriyoshi to extend Hachiman's protective influence over Kamakura; and today this branch shrine attracts more visitors than any other shrine in Japan.

The ceremony is accompanied by sacred kagura dances meant to commemorate the souls of fish killed by fishermen during the previous year. This syncretic rite fusing Buddhism and Shinto, now performed in many shrines all over the country, first took place here. Architecture The main hall and the Kujaku Monkei are designated amongst Japan's National Treasures. The structures which comprise the current shrine complex were built in the middle of the 19th century. Their characteristic configuration, called Hachiman-zukuri, consists of two parallel structures with gabled roofs interconnected on the non-gabled side to form what internally is a single building.

Common names include Texas guaiacum, Texas lignum-vitae, soapbush and huayac√°n. It is native to southern and western Texas in the United States and northern Mexico. The specific name is derived from the Latin angustus, meaning \\"narrow,\\" and -folius, meaning \\"-leaved\\". Location This tree can be found in the area around the Rio Grande river including Austin, Matagorda Bay, New Braunfels, San Antonio, Brownsville and Fort McIntosh westward to the Rio Pecos. In the 19th century trees growing along the outskirts of this region were so small they were described by the United States Department of Interior as \\"low shrub(s)\\". The largest examples could be found on the hillsides near the Guadalupe river valley. Description Texas lignum-vitae is a many branched shrub or small tree, reaching a height of . This evergreen has a dense canopy and short lateral branches. =Leaves= Leaves are long, opposite and pinnately compound, with four to eight pairs of leaflets. The dark green, leathery, linear to linear-spatulate leaflets are long and wide. Leaflets fold themselves at night and when exposed to hot sunlight. =Flowers= The small blue to purple flowers are in diameter. They have five sepals, five petals around in length, and ten stamens. The blooming period lasts from March until September, with flowers appearing after rain. =Fruit= The fruit is a flat, leathery capsule in diameter with one to two lobes, sometimes as many as four. Dehiscent locules contain a single shiny, bean-like seed that is usually bright red. Uses Like other species in its genus, the wood of G. angustifolium has extreme hardness and density and will sink in water. The sapwood is creamy yellow, while the heartwood is dark purple-brown. The wood is used for fence posts, tool handles, and firewood. Root extracts are used to treat rheumatism and sexually transmitted diseases. Soap can be made from the root bark, as it contains saponin; historically soap made in this way would be used to wash wool, since it does not fade the dyed- colors. The bark of the roots is also used as a disinfectant. The flowers are valued by beekeepers for their consistent nectar production. Texas lignum- vitae is cultivated as an ornamental because of its drought tolerance, dense foliage, compact size, gnarled branches, and fragrant flowers. It is used in hedges, rock gardens, and xeriscaping. Ecology Guaiacum angustifolium is a host plant for the caterpillars of the lyside sulphur (Kricogonia lyside). The leaves contain 16-18% crude protein and are browsed by White-tailed deer. Conservation Like other members of its genus, the international trade of Texas lignum-vitae is restricted by CITES Appendix II. Only seeds, pollen, and finished products ready for retail sale may be legally exported.

It is located at the northern intersection of Maryland routes 413 and 667. After the arrival of the Pennsylvania Railroad arm known as the \\"Eastern Shore Railroad\\" toward Crisfield in 1866, Marion was locally hailed as the \\"strawberry capital of the world\\". After the trains stopped coming it went into decline, with some sources even hailing it as a ghost town. History Marion Station was once known as Coulbourne Creek until the Pennsylvania Railroad line known as the Crisfield Secondary Branch of the Eastern Shore Railroad reached Crisfield. A train station was built in the town thanks to John C. Horsey, who paid for the right-of-way for the train and the station house. The town was then renamed Marion; the name was taken from Horsey's daughter. Because of the railroad, Marion Station experienced an economic boom and became the world's leader in strawberry production, utilizing the railroad to ship strawberries across the country. Large trains came to Marion's train station every day to collect strawberries, pulling loaded ice-refrigeration cars out to sell them in large cities. The town saw the construction of several businesses along its Main Street (now Maryland Route 667) corridor: a movie house, grocery store, blacksmith shop, pharmacy, a school. A garage was also built, as was a bar and a pharmacy. Marion Station also possessed the first hospital ever built in Somerset County, and the town grew to the point where it needed its own police force. After several decades, however, the town began to slip into decline. This occurred in the 1950s, when the trains stopped coming to Marion for strawberries. The railroad line was officially abandoned on April 1, 1976 when Conrail was established, and the steel rails were removed from the railroad bed later; however, the railroad was supplanted earlier by the construction of Maryland Route 413's current alignment. Many of the old buildings have been torn down or are now vacant. The train station still stands in the town. In 1997, a revitalization project began to restore the building. It was reopened in the early 2000s as the new Accohannock Indian Museum, containing various relics from the time when Marion Station was a bustling city. The fire department was moved across MD 667 to where it currently stands; the old building is now a store. The former pharmacy is located on the short stub of Charles Cannon Road between MD 413 and 667, and has been boarded up for decades. Even the two gas stations located in the town have both closed; the last one closed in the early 2000s. The train station building, which is now the Accohannock Indian Museum. The lack of trains coming for the strawberries prompted the collapse of Marion's strawberry industry. The fields are now dominated by other food crops, such as soybeans and corn; other fields remain completely vacant, such as the field directly east of the center of the community (between Hudson's Corner Road and Tulls Corner Road). Additionally, Marion Station is home to a very large organic vegetable farm, which was started by sociologists from New Jersey. In the 2000s, housing development began to arise in Marion Station, along the Charles Cannon Road corridor west of the community, making the community a retirement destination. The Lankford House, Pomfret Plantation, Quindocqua United Methodist Church, Watkins Point Farm, and Williams' Conquest are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Education Marion Sarah Peyton School, as of November 2012 The building for Marion Sarah Peyton and Elementary School is located on MD 667: Hudson Corner Road, and once served grades 3-5 for the southern half of Somerset County. After the consolidation of schools which occurred in 2004, however, those grades were moved to Crisfield, and the school closed down. It was reopened in 2007 for adult GED classes. Transportation=Main roads= Maryland Route 667 is the main road of the community, housing most of the important facilities in years past and today, such as the volunteer fire department, the train station, the school, and the post office. The road crosses Tulls Corner and Charles Cannon Road; MD 667 is also known as Hudson Corner Road north of and Crisfield-Marion Road south of this intersection. At the turn of the 20th century, Crisfield-Marion Road was known as Main Street. MD 667 also links the town to Pocomoke and U.S. Route 13 southbound to Virginia. The speed limit on the road in town is 30 mph. Tulls Corner Road leads east out of the town, to the ghost town of Tulls Corner. It passes by a facility for the elderly. Between this facility and Marion, the road was Maryland Route 357 until the early 1990s.MD Roads: Routes 340-359. 02/12/2009. Charles Cannon Road is a continuation of Tulls Corner Road after it intersects both MD 413 and MD 667, and eventually leads north to Kingston, also granting access to the boat dock. A small portion of this road, between MD 413 and the subtransmission power line crossing, was also MD 357. Both Tulls Corner Road and Charles Cannon Road largely serve residences in the community. Also important to the community is Maryland Route 413, the main highway between Crisfield and points north on US 13. It is paralleled closely by MD 667 through the community and carries a speed limit of . =Navigable rivers= The Big Annemessex River passes by the town, with a small local arm known as Coulbourne's Creek. The convergence of these two bodies of water is accessible by Coulbourne Creek Road, off Charles Cannon Road, where a public boat dock is located. The activity in Marion was centered around this area before the economic boom brought about by the Eastern Shore Railroad and the shift to strawberry farming. =Public transportation= Shore Transit has two routes which serve the community: Route 706 North and Route 706 South. The bus is accessible from two stops within the area: Marion Volunteer Fire Department and the former Marion Sarah Peyton Elementary School, and both operate along the MD 667 corridor within the business area before returning to MD 413.

He had earlier designed the Alexander & Baldwin Building in downtown Honolulu, but felt that the somewhat similar design of the Immigration building \\"summed up his work.\\" Similar renditions of the tiled, double-pitched, hipped \\"Dickey roof\\" with wide eaves can be found all over the islands, especially after its revival on many new buildings during the 1980s and 1990s. Other elements of the Dickey style include balanced proportions, open areas designed to provide natural light and ventilation, and decorative details such as the inlaid compass on the waiting room floor and floral patterns on the terra cotta ceiling tiles.

Description The cylindrical blazing star grows from rounded or sometimes elongated corms, which produce hairless stems tall. At the top of the stem is a single flower head or a loose to dense cluster (raceme, spike, or panicle) of 2 to 28 flower heads. Each flower head has 10‚Äì35 florets, and is stemless or has a stem long that orients the head upwards. The flowers bloom in mid to late summer, starting at the top of the cluster. The basal and cauline leaves usually have three nerves, though sometimes up to five. They are long and thin, ranging from long and wide. The leaves are mostly hairless or may have some hairs on the margins. Some plants in Kentucky and Missouri are hairy; this may indicate hybridization with Liatris hirsuta.

It includes army aviation, construction engineers, field artillery and medical asset units. It was reorganized in 1996, consolidating its two field artillery battalions into a single battalion. A ribbon bridge company and rear operations center for an infantry division were added to the Guard. It is administered by the Wyoming Military Department, part of the Wyoming state government.http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/arng-wy.htm The Wyoming Military Department's goal is to provide a trained, quality-based force, supported by appropriate equipment, facilities and real property, technology, and services to successfully execute state and federal missions. History The Wyoming Army National Guard was established in 1870, during the Wyoming Territory period, when territorial Governor John A. Campbell authorized the division of the Wyoming Territory into three military districts. On December 31, 1871, a law passed by the Wyoming Territorial Assembly gave legal sanction to volunteer militia companies of not less than 40 men. The first federally recognized Wyoming unit was Company A, 1st Wyoming Regiment: The Laramie Grays, organized in 1888. The Laramie Grays were followed by the organization of Company B: The Cheyenne Guard the same year. Several other units including the Cheyenne Rangers, the 1st Regiment, the Wyoming Home Guard, and the Wyoming Rangers were formed because of concerns over conflicts with Native American tribes but were short-lived. When Wyoming became a state in 1890, constitutional provisions allowed for the formation of units in Buffalo, Evanston, Douglas, Green River, Rock Springs, Rawlins and Sheridan. Wyoming's first artillery unit, Battery A, and a regimental band were formed in May, 1894. The artillery unit was equipped with two three-inch Hotchkiss guns, drawn by horse. The Wyoming National Guard was first federally mobilized during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898. Since then, the Guard has seen active service in the Mexican Punitive Campaign, World War I, World War II, the Berlin Crisis and Korea. Wyoming Guard units have also served in Desert Storm, the Bosnia peacekeeping force, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom and Hurricane Katrina response. The Wyoming National Guard 300th Armored Field Artillery Battalion was commemorated in 1983 as part of the National Guard Heritage Painting series at the Pentagon for their combat action during the Battle of Soyang during the Korean War.http://www.wy.ngb.army.mil/history/ Units * Joint Forces Headquarters (JFHQ)  WY ARNG Medical Detachment  Recruiting and Retention Battalion  25px Training Site Command  197th Public Affairs Detachment (197th PAD)  Detachment 53, Operational Support Airlift Command * 94th Troop Command  67th Army Band  133rd Engineer Company 25px G Company, 2nd Battalion, 211th Aviation Regiment 25px C Company, 1st Battalion, 297th Infantry Regiment, 25px 29th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (29th IBCT), 25px 40th Infantry Division *25px 115th Field Artillery Brigade (115th FAB)  2nd Battalion, 300th Field Artillery Regiment (2-300th FAR)  148th Signal Company  920th Forward Support Company (920th FSC)  960th Brigade Support Battalion (960th BSB) * 213th Regional Training Institute (213th RTI) ReferencesExternal links *Official website United States Army National Guard by state Military units and formations established in 1870 ","title":"Wyoming Army National Guard"},{"id":"21313024","text":"Jele≈Ñcz () is a village in Gmina Parchowo, Byt√≥w County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northern Poland.

It dramatically depicts the life of a geisha in the Red Light District and the lives she touches. Narration The story heavily uses heterodiegetic narration, a style of narration where the narrator describes what the characters experience in the story. This particular narration is partially omniscient as it tells the readers everything the characters are feeling and thinking but doesn‚Äôt go too far into the future. It also seems slightly critical of the characters but uses a fairly judicious balance. Several times throughout the story the narrator disagrees with the opinions presented about the characters. Synopsis The novel centers around the Kikunoi, a popular geisha house in the red light district of an unspecified town, and its most popular geisha, Oriki („ÅäÂäõ). During the story Oriki‚Äôs previous relationships are learned from the point of view of her wealthy patron: Tamonosuke Yuki (ÁµêÂüéÊúù‰πãÂä©). Although Oriki attends to Tamonosuke whenever he calls, he is more interested in learning of her previous ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù whom the other Geisha constantly tease Oriki about. Prior to the story, Oriki was engaged in a longstanding patronage with Genshichi (Ê∫ê‰∏É), a futon salesman of moderate affluence who was reduced to the hard labor of a construction worker. Despite being married with a child, Genshichi spends all his money and time patronizing Oriki at the Kikunoi. Due to his heavy spending, Genshichi and his family are forced to live in a dilapidated shack at the end of a merchant alley. The story‚Äôs end isn‚Äôt told from any of the characters‚Äô points of view, instead jumping ahead to several passersby discussing a recent love suicide implied to be Genshichi and Oriki. The gossipers are conflicted, though, as to whether it was a true love suicide or if the woman was attacked. It‚Äôs left to the reader to determine the true circumstance of the characters‚Äô deaths. Themes Risshin Shusse (Á´ãË∫´Âá∫‰∏ñ) Success in Life This was a mentality that the Japanese held during the Meiji Restoration that if one works hard enough, one would be a ‚Äúsuccess in life‚Äù. It can be compared to the ‚ÄúAmerican Dream‚Äù. Higuchi takes this ideal and shows that it is not as easy to accomplish, as one would believe. Women were excluded, as the only way to reach a higher position in life for a woman at that time was to marry a man of wealth. Tamonosuke seemingly gives Oriki this opportunity to leave behind her geisha life and become his wife but whether she wants to or not is ambiguous. She encourages Tamonosuke to get ahead with his life, and almost seems disappointed with Tamonosuke‚Äôs increasing interest in her. Shinj≈´ (ÂøÉ‰∏≠) Love Suicide The love suicide was a popular theme used by the Japanese particularly in the puppet theatre, otherwise known as bunraku (ÊñáÊ•Ω). The scene usually depicted two lovers separated by societal expectations or familial obligations. It was believed that when lovers committed suicide together, they would be reunited in heaven where they could love each other the way they never could on Earth. Higuchi makes a reference to this in Nigorie as she takes the stereotype and adds a surprising twist to it. Love suicides often end with a small poetic journey, otherwise known as a michiyuki, in which the audience is given foresight as to what the characters will choose to do. The news about the supposed love suicide in Ichiy≈ç‚Äôs Nigorie is given by gossipers on the street who aren‚Äôt sure of what really happened and who desecrate Oriki‚Äôs name. Yamato Kotoba (Â§ßÂíåË®ÄËëâ) ‚ÄúJapanese Words Nigorie is written in yamato-kotoba, a style of classical Japanese writing written completely in the native hiragana[link] and purified of any Sino- Japanese words. These two traits give the writing an air of femininity, as Chinese-influenced writing was considered the domain of men; women were therefore barred from using this type of language. Translations Nigorie was translated into English in 1958 by Hisako Tanaka under the title Muddy Bay and again in 1981 by Robert Lyons Danly under the title Troubled Waters. It was also translated into modern Japanese in 1996 by Hiromi Ito. Adaptations A film, An Inlet of Muddy Water, was made in 1953 by Tadashi Imai and entered into the 1954 Cannes Film Festival. It won the 1953 Blue Ribbon Award and the 1953 Mainichi film.

Google Books preview of Tsaruk publication; pp. 20-21, preview in Ukrainian. According to Tsaruk, Siemaszkos included in the number of Polish citizens also those who emigrated before the commencement of hostilities according to him, and included population points which were not administrative units, thus enlarging the number of Polish victims of ethnic cleansing while minimizing the Ukrainian casualties. Tsaruk claims that although according to Siemaszkos 1,915 Poles died in the hands of Ukrainian Nationalists in the area of Volodymyr, according to him ‚Äì only 430. Siemaszkos in their own monograph replied to this kind of criticism by stating that claims made by Tsaruk are based on statements made by Ukrainian villagers half a century after the war ended, therefore the discrepancies in what is being said by the locals can be \\"explained by psychological defense mechanisms\\".W≈Çadys≈Çaw Siemaszko with J√≥zef Turowski; Zbrodnie nacjonalist√≥w ukrai≈Ñskich dokonane na ludno≈õci polskiej na Wo≈Çyniu, 1939‚Äì1945.

Another Ukrainian historian, Ihor Ilyushin, echoed Tsaruk's observations and questioned whether Siemaszkos approach, based on testimony from one side, can be truly objective ‚Äì wrote Canadian historian David R. Marples in Heroes and villains. Marples quoted Ilyushin as saying that because W≈Çadys≈Çaw Siemaszko was a participant in the conflict he is not a credible witness. However, Marples also noted that Ilyushin failed to reach a reasonable conclusion in his article and made no distinction between Ukrainian atrocities committed against officials and innocent civilians; men, women and children.David R.

The sword's name could either be a reference to the similarity of its shape to the leaves of rice or to local green snakes \\"dahong palay\\", purported to be extremely venomous.[ Dahong Palay by Arturo B. Rotor] The snake is probably green specimens of the Philippine Pit Viper, Trimeresurus flavomaculatus, though it is sometimes identified as various relatively harmless green snakes, like vine snakes. The dahong palay was originally used as a farmer's tool, for clearing thick grass growths. However, during the Philippine revolution of 1896, farmers from Batangas soon came to favor it for its slashing and thrusting \\"feel\\".  Physical description  The dahong palay's size is about the same as most Filipino swords such as the kalis, golok, or ginunting, measuring about twenty to thirty inches. = Blade = The blade is single-edged and has what is classified as a normal blade pattern - that is, it has a curved cutting edge, and a back which is virtually flat at the tip. The width of the blade is at its fullest at the hand guard, and from there the sharp edge tapers smoothly, with only the slightest curve or \\"belly\\" as it moves towards the tip of the sword. In contrast, the back of the blade only begins to curve downward as it nears the hilt, which in turn also curves downwards, completing the \\"rice leaf\\" tapering profile of the sword. The tip of this \\"rice leaf\\" profile is an acute and very sharp point, which gives the blade its penetrating capability when used in a thrusting motion. The balance and steep profile of the sword, in turn, gives it its cutting ability when used in a slashing motion. = Hilt = The sword's full tang is embedded in a long hilt, traditionally made of Kamagong wood. As previously explained, this hilt tilts downwards, contributing to the sword's unique profile. Aside from that, however, the exact shape of the hilt, varies significantly from piece to piece, with the pommel and grip not always distinct parts of the hilt, and a crossguard that isn't present in all pieces. In addition, the dahong palay's origins as an agricultural tool means that the hilts are often simple and practical, rather than ornate as is often the case in the kalis or kampilan.  In history  The dahong palay was initially used for agricultural work since pre-colonial times, and later on, was used for dambana practices as well. As a weapon, the dahong palay was a mainstay during the many conflicts that have plagued the Southern Tagalog region since its first use during the Philippine revolution against the Spanish - used by farmer-warriors whenever they could not acquire firearms. It is noted for having been used by Filipino soldiers under the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary units and the recognized guerrillas in the region during World War II.

Langanes is a peninsula in northeast Iceland. The name literally means \\"long peninsula\\". It is long from southwest to northeast, ending in a thin strip of land called Fontur. It is bounded by √ûistilfj√∂r√∞ur to the northwest and Bakkafl√≥i to the southeast, while the terrain inland reaches elevations of 200‚Äì450 metres (600‚Äì1200 feet). The highest point is Gunn√≥lfsv√≠kurfjall in the southeast of the peninsula, at 719 m. The peninsula is composed of late Pliocene-early Pleistocene lavas. Kistufjall (444 m) is the distinctive tuya (table mountain) volcano that resulted from subglacial eruptions. Administratively, Langanes forms part of the Langanesbygg√∞ municipality (population 480 in 2008). Virtually all of the population live in the village of √û√≥rsh√∂fn (Thorshofn) on the northwestern coast, which has a small airport. Sau√∞anes, just to the north of √û√≥rsh√∂fn, has an ancient church which has been converted into a museum. The fishing village of Sk√°lar, on the southeastern coast near the tip of the peninsula, had a population of over a hundred in the early 20th century, but was abandoned by 1946. Other abandoned settlements include Hei√∞arh√∂fn, L√¶knista√∞ir, Skoruv√≠k, Fagranes and Saurb√¶r. A NATO radar station was operated on Hei√∞arfjall from 1954 to 1968.

History  There has probably been a dwelling of some sort on or near the site of the present house since Saxon times. The site was recorded in the Domesday book as 'Lestington', meaning \\"the farm of the followers of Lest\\". In 1805 Reverend John Dampier knocked down most of the farmhouse and built a new home, calling it Leeson house. He later sold it to the wealthy Garland family from Poole to use as a second home. In 1903, it was sold again and became a boarding school for girls. In 1940, the girls were sent home during World War II. The house was taken over by the Air Ministry and was used for top secret Radar research. From Leeson they completed the world's first successful tracking of a submarine, in Swanage Bay. Due to concerns about the safety of the project it was moved inland after only 18 months. Several air raid shelters still exist on site. There is a project to convert a bomb shelter to attract the Greater Horseshoe Bat to roost. After the war it became a boy's boarding pre-prep school which closed in 1966. In 1967 Leeson House was officially opened as a Field Studies Centre.Leeson House history  Facilities  The main house is Grade II listed and dates back to the early 19th century.

Frequency  The Brookings Register publishes daily Monday through Friday afternoon and Saturday morning with a focus on local news and sports in an effort to keep area residents and visitors informed. History The rich history of the Brookings Register dates back to March 30, 1882, when the paper's forerunner, the weekly Brookings County Sentinel, began accounting the events of the Brookings region. That first edition numbered six pages and featured on the first Page One, the death of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, food recipes, and the battle against \\"beer drinking in a civilized society.\\" George N. Breed and Charles D'A Wright, editors and publishers, gave their thanks on the editorial page \\"to all upright citizens\\" and to them the publishers extended the \\"hand of mutual friendship.\\" It was their desire, the men said, to present the news of the day, discussions of topics of interest, and to help build up Brookings County. Under the leadership of George Breed and Paul Dutcher, the first issue of the Brookings Register--eight pages‚Äîwas printed on June 13, 1890. At that time the city boasted a population of 1,700 people and the price of a subscription was $1.50 for a one-year subscription. On January 6, 1891, the Register bought out the Sentinel. Initially, the publication came out twice weekly, only to return to a weekly schedule in 1898. Local pictures appeared in print in 1910 and the first advertisements for automobiles followed in 1911. The Register resumed its twice-weekly publication schedule in 1948, under the ownership of the Mitchell family. The paper turned daily in January 1970, publishing five days per week, Monday through Friday. Later that year, the paper was sold to Stauffer Communications of Topeka, Kansas. Stauffer held onto the Register until 1990, when Omaha World-Herald of Omaha, Nebraska purchased the paper. The newspaper added a sixth day of publication‚ÄîSaturday‚Äîin March 1995. The current owners, News Media Corporation, of Rochelle, Illinois, bought the Register on February 1, 1999. Today, the Register prints over 5,000 copies daily.

He was born in 1808, the son of Robert Stiff, a workhouse master and farmer in Rougham, Suffolk. In 1831 he married Sarah Faulkner Philpott, and Lucy Potter in 1878. Stiff worked his way up from a mould maker in 1830 at Doulton and Watts' Lambeth Pottery in London to owning his own pottery works in Lambeth in 1843. He brought his sons William and Ebenezer into the family business, taking on the name James Stiff and Sons. They were part of a vibrant collection of potters in Lambeth at the time, including Doulton and Watts Pottery in Lambeth High Street (later Doulton & Company) and Stephen Green's Imperial Pottery. This group of Lambeth potteries were famous for their varied types of stoneware pottery; Stiff & Sons also produced effervescent, colourful pottery. Career In 1826, Stiff left his job as a plasterer's assistant in Rougham; he went to London, beginning an apprenticeship at the Coade Stone manufactory. Four years later, he began work at Doulton and Watt's Lambeth Pottery as a mould maker. In 1842, he commenced working as a potter at his own premises in Ferry Street, Lambeth (previously the premises of T. Higgins). Directories of the time record him making water filters. The following year, Stiff leased the first portion of his 39 High Street, Lambeth premises; however, he is still listed in trade directories at Ferry Street until 1844. From 1845 on, he is listed at 39 High Street. In 1863 Stiff brought his sons, William and Ebenezer, into partnership with him as James Stiff and Sons. An 1895 article in The British Clayworker described Stiff as \\"now retired\\"; he died in Swanage in 1897. Following his death, in 1903 a new partnership of Sydney James Stiff (1867‚Äì1948), James Arthur Stiff and William Frederick Stiff (born 1874, another son of Ebenezer) was formed. This partnership was dissolved on 31 December 1912, and the following year the firm was sold to Royal Doulton. He died at Swanage on 18 May 1897 and, like his contemporaries Doulton and Green, Stiff was buried at West Norwood Cemetery.

The Codex Eyckensis is the oldest book in Belgium.Coenen, J., Het oudste boek van Belgi√´, Het Boek 10, 1921, S. 189‚Äì194 Since the eighth century it has been kept and preserved on the territory of the present-day municipality of Maaseik, in Belgium (hence the name \\"Eyckensis\\"). The book was probably produced in the scriptorium in the Abbey of Echternach. It is housed in the church of St Catherine in Maaseik.  Descriptions of manuscript A and manuscript B  Full-page evangelist portrait and canon tables in the Codex Eyckensis A. The Codex Eyckensis consists of two evangelistaries on 133 parchment folios measuring 244 by 183 mm each. The first manuscript (Codex A) is incomplete. It consists of five folios, opening with a full-page Evangelist portrait (presumably depicting Saint Matthew), followed by an incomplete set of eight Canon Tables. The Evangelist portrait is rendered in Italian- Byzantine style, which is clearly related to that of the Barberini Gospels currently kept in the Vatican Library (Barberini Lat. 570). The portrait is framed in a border of Anglo-Saxon knotwork, comparable to the decoration elements in the Lindisfarne Gospels. The Canon Tables provide an overview of corresponding passages in the four Gospels. In this way, the Canon Tables serve as table of contents and index to ease access to the texts. The Canon Tables in manuscript A are decorated with columns and arcades, the symbols of the four Evangelists and portraits of saints. The second manuscript (Codex B) contains a full set of twelve Canon Tables and all four Gospel texts in Latin. The Canon Tables are embellished with columns and arcades, depictions of Apostles and the Evangelists‚Äô symbols. The Gospel texts are written in a rounded form of the insular minuscule, which was characteristic of British and Irish manuscripts from the seventh and eighth centuries, but was also used in mainland Europe. The initial capital of each paragraph is outlined with red and yellow dots. The text was copied by a single scribe. The Gospel text is a version of the Vulgate, mostly as translated by Saint Jerome (Hieronymus of Stridon, 347‚Äì420 CE), with a number of additions and transpositions. Comparable versions of the Gospel texts can be found in the Book of Kells (Dublin, Trinity College, ms 58), the Book of Armagh (Dublin, Trinity College, ms 52) and the Echternach Gospels (Paris, Bnf, ms Lat.9389).  History (origin to 20th century)  The Codex Eyckensis displayed in the St Catherine's Church in Maaseik The Codex dates from the eighth century and was first kept at the former Benedictine abbey of Aldeneik, which was consecrated in 728 CE. The Merovingian nobles Adelard, Lord of Denain, and his wife Grinuara founded this abbey for their daughters Harlindis and Relindis in ‚Äúa small and useless wood\\"Acta Sanctorum, Martii, unter Leitung von J. Carnandet, 3. Teil, Paris-Rom, 1865, S. 383‚Äì390, Abs. 7. near the river Meuse. The convent was named Eyke (‚Äúoak‚Äù), for the oak trees that grew there. Later, as the neighbouring village of Nieuw-Eyke (‚Äúnew oak‚Äù‚Äîpresent-day Maaseik) grew and became more important, the name of the original village became Aldeneik (‚Äúold oak‚Äù). Saint Willibrord consecrated Harlindis as the first abbess of this religious community. After her demise, Saint-Boniface consecrated her sister Relindis as her successor. The Codex Eyckensis was used at the convent to study and also to promulgate the teachings of Christ. Both evangelistaries that now constitute the Codex Eyckensis were presumably brought from the Abbey of Echternach to Aldeneik by Saint Willibrord. The two manuscripts were merged into one binding, most likely in the course of the twelfth century. In 1571 the abbey of Aldeneik was abandoned. From the middle of the tenth century, the Benedictine nuns had been replaced by a collegiate chapter of male canons. With the increasing threat of religious war, the canons took refuge in the walled town of Maaseik. They brought the church treasures from Aldeneik‚Äîincluding the Codex Eyckensis‚Äîto Saint Catherine‚Äôs church. Text folio in the Codex B  Authorship  For centuries, people were convinced the Codex Eyckensis had been written by Harlindis and Relindis, the first abbesses of the abbey of Aldeneik, who were later canonized. Their hagiography was written down in the course of the ninth century by a local priest.Abbaye d‚ÄôAldeneik, √† Maaseik, in Monasticon belge, 6, Province de Limbourg, L√ºttich, 1976, S. 87. This text mentions that Harlindis and Relindis had also written an evangelistary. In the course of the ninth century the cult of the relics of the saintly sisters became increasingly important and included the veneration of the Codex Eyckensis, which inspired deep reverence as a work produced by Harlindis and Relindis themselves. However, the final lines of the second manuscript refute this explicitly: Finito volumine deposco ut quicumque ista legerint pro laboratore huius operis depraecentur (At the completion of this volume, I ask all who read this to pray for the worker who made this manuscript). The male form laborator (‚Äúworker‚Äù) clearly indicates that the person who wrote the manuscript was a man. A comparative analysis performed in 1994 by Albert Derolez (University of Ghent) and Nancy Netzer (Boston College) has revealed that manuscript A and manuscript B both date from the same period, that it is highly probable that both were created at the scriptorium of the abbey of Echternach and that they may even have been produced by the same scribe.Netzer, N.(1994) Cultural Interplay in the Eighth Century. The Trier Gospels and the Making of a Scriptorium at Echternach, Cambridge-New York.  Conservation and restoration attempt of 1957  Detail from the Codex B In 1957 an attempt to conserve and restore the Codex Eyckensis was made by Karl Sievers, a restorer from D√ºsseldorf. He removed and destroyed the 18th- century red velvet binding and then proceeded to laminate all folios of the manuscript with Mipofolie. Mipofolie is a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) foil, externally plasticized with dioctyl phthalate. With the passing of time, this foil produced hydrochloric acid which attacked the parchment and had a yellowing effect on the foil itself. The transparency and colour of the parchment were affected, and polymers present in the foil could migrate to the parchment and render it brittle. After the lamination, Sievers rebound the codex. To be able to do so, he cut the edges of the folios, which resulted in fragments of the illumination being lost. In a new extensive restoration effort between 1987 and 1993 the Mipofolie lamination was meticulously removed by a team of the Belgian Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage, led by the chemist Dr Jan Wouters. For the restoration of the folios after the removal of the laminate, an innovative parchment leafcasting technique was developed. To complete the restoration, the two constituent manuscripts of the Codex were bound separately.Wouters, J., Gancedo, G., Peckstadt, A., Watteeuw, L. (1992). The conservation of the Codex Eyckensis: the evolution of the project and the assessment of materials and adhesives for the repair of parchment. The Paper Conservator 16, 67-77.  Documentation and digitisation  The oldest photographic documentation of the Codex Eyckensis dates from approximately 1916 (Bildarchiv Marburg). On the occasion of the restoration, the manuscript was photographed at the Belgian Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage (KIK‚ÄìIRPA). A facsimile was published in 1994.Coppens, C. , A.

In 2015, the Codex Eyckensis was digitised on site in Saint Catherine‚Äôs church by the Imaging Lab and Illuminare ‚Äì Centre for the Study of Medieval Art  KU Leuven. This project was led by Prof. Lieve Watteeuw. The high-resolution images were made available on line in cooperation with LIBIS (KU Leuven). The Codex Eyckensis was recognised and protected as immovable heritage in 1986. In 2003 the Codex Eyckensis was recognised as a Flemish Masterpiece.  Current research  In the course of 2016‚Äì2017 a team of researchers from Illuminare ‚Äì Centre for the Study of Medieval Art  KU Leuven (Prof. Lieve Watteeuw) and the Belgian Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage (Dr. Marina Van Bos) will again study the Codex Eyckensis.

Richard von Helmholtz was born on 28 September 1852 in K√∂nigsberg, Prussia, the son of the physicist Hermann von Helmholtz and his first wife Olga, n√©e von Velten. Career After studying in Stuttgart and Munich, in 1873 he began his career as a design engineer at the Krauss locomotive works in Munich, where he soon rose to become head of the design bureau. In this capacity, he had a considerable influence on the destiny of the company for decades, especially after the retirement of Georg Krauss from the management in 1885. =Innovations= In the course of his career he worked on all the components making up a locomotive, including less conspicuous parts such as his development of a new type of sander. In 1887 he conducted ground-breaking research into the behaviour of locomotives on curves. From this theoretical work a practical result ensued in 1888: the design of the Krauss-Helmholtz bogie, which saw widespread use on locomotives with carrying wheels - and not only on steam locomotives. The Austrian designer, Karl G√∂lsdorf, drew even wider-ranging conclusions from the work of Helmholtz and created a radially- sliding coupled axle, the so-called G√∂lsdorf axle, which became a standard in the construction of locomotives. =Locomotive designs= Of the many locomotive classes designed under his direction, a few examples are given here: * In 1888 the Bavarian D VIII, the last one of which was still in service in 1958. * In 1896 the Bavarian AA I, of which only one was built. * In 1897 the Bavarian D XII (Pt2/5), and virtually identical Palatine P2.II, of which a total of 174 engines were built. * In 1908 the Palatine P 5 and Bavarian Pt3/6, which ran for almost 50 years. =Criticism= In such a long and innovative career, the occasional mistake was to be expected. For example, the Palatine P 3.II which was built in 1900 and displayed at the 1900 World Exhibition in Paris was an express train locomotive with a dolly axle. This design did not acquit itself well; as early as 1902 the dolly axle was removed and the engine converted into a normal 2'B1' locomotive. Retirement and death After his retirement, he remained connected to the world of locomotives. Blessed with an excellent memory well into old age, he occupied himself, partly as an author and partly as a publisher, with recording the historical development of the steam locomotive. He died on 10 September 1934 in Munich.  Publications  * Richard von Helmholtz, Wilhelm Staby: Die Entwicklung der Lokomotive im Gebiete des Vereins deutscher Eisenbahnverwaltungen.

It is administratively divided into five academies, but all classes are available to all students. The school was first established in 1911, then divided into two separate high schools, North and South, in 1960. SHS was re-established in 2008 at a new facility after enrollment declines necessitated combining the two high schools into a single body.  History  Original Springfield High School that later served as South High School, 1960‚Äì2008 The school was founded in 1911, then split into two high schools (North and South) in the fall of 1960. South High kept the original Springfield High School building, located at 700 South Limestone Street near the city's downtown, which was modeled after the Library of Congress and renowned for its large white dome. South also kept Springfield High's nickname, \\"Wildcats,\\" and school colors of navy and gold. North High, was nicknamed \\"Panthers\\" and used red, blue, and white as its school colors. The two high schools shared Evans Stadium, which was used by Springfield High, until North High built its own stadium on the campus of its school. In 2008, North and South merged back into \\"Springfield High School.\\" A new high school building and campus was built at the location of the old North High. The new Springfield High took the \\"Wildcats\\" nickname, adopted blue, gold and white as its colors and continues to use Evans Stadium for football. It also uses the on-campus stadium North High built for other sporting events. The school district uses the old Springfield High/South High building for administrative purposes, but is no longer allowed to be used for teaching or classroom purposes per state guidelines. In the second year of Springfield High School's opening, a decision was made to change the names of the four small schools. Starting the 2010‚Äì2011 school year, instead of having the four small schools Problem Based Learning, Humanities, Leadership and Global Perspectives, the fall of 2010 marked those four small school's transformation into five separate academies. These academies are meant to allow each student to join with students and staff with similar interests and needs. The five academies are called Preparatory Academy, Exploratory Academy, STEM Academy, International Arts & Communications Academy, and Health & Human Services Academy.

Definition A field is an algebraic structure composed of a set of elements, F, two binary operations, addition (+) such that F forms an abelian group with identity 0F and multiplication (¬∑), such that F excluding 0F forms an abelian group under multiplication with identity 1F, and such that multiplication is distributive over addition, that is for any elements a, b, c in F, one has . If there is also a function E that maps F into F, and such that for every a and b in F one has :begin{align}&E;(a+b)=E(a)cdot E(b),&E;(0_F)=1_F end{align} then F is called an exponential field, and the function E is called an exponential function on F.Helmut Wolter, Some results about exponential fields (survey), M√©moires de la S.M.F. 2e s√©rie, 16, (1984), pp.85-94. Thus an exponential function on a field is a homomorphism between the additive group of F and its multiplicative group.  Trivial exponential function  There is a trivial exponential function on any field, namely the map that sends every element to the identity element of the field under multiplication. Thus every field is trivially also an exponential field, so the cases of interest to mathematicians occur when the exponential function is non-trivial. Exponential fields are sometimes required to have characteristic zero as the only exponential function on a field with nonzero characteristic is the trivial one.Lou van den Dries, Exponential rings, exponential polynomials and exponential functions, Pacific Journal of Mathematics, 113, no.1 (1984), pp.51-66. To see this first note that for any element x in a field with characteristic p > 0, :1=E(0)=E(underbrace{x+x+ldots+x}_{ptext{ of these}})=E(x)E(x)cdots E(x)=E(x)^p. Hence, taking into account the Frobenius endomorphism, :(E(x)-1)^p=E(x)^p-1^p=E(x)^p-1=0., And so E(x) = 1 for every x.Martin Bays, Jonathan Kirby, A.J. Wilkie, A Schanuel property for exponentially transcendental powers, (2008), Examples * The field of real numbers R, or as it may be written to highlight that we are considering it purely as a field with addition, multiplication, and special constants zero and one, has infinitely many exponential functions. One such function is the usual exponential function, that is , since we have and , as required. Considering the ordered field R equipped with this function gives the ordered real exponential field, denoted . * Any real number gives an exponential function on R, where the map satisfies the required properties. * Analogously to the real exponential field, there is the complex exponential field, . * Boris Zilber constructed an exponential field Kexp that, crucially, satisfies the equivalent formulation of Schanuel's conjecture with the field's exponential function.Boris Zilber, Pseudo-exponentiation on algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero, Ann. Pure Appl. Logic, 132, no.1 (2005), pp.67‚Äì95. It is conjectured that this exponential field is actually Cexp, and a proof of this fact would thus prove Schanuel's conjecture. Exponential rings The underlying set F may not be required to be a field but instead allowed to simply be a ring, R, and concurrently the exponential function is relaxed to be a homomorphism from the additive group in R to the multiplicative group of units in R. The resulting object is called an exponential ring. An example of an exponential ring with a nontrivial exponential function is the ring of integers Z equipped with the function E which takes the value +1 at even integers and ‚àí1 at odd integers, i.e., the function n mapsto (-1)^n. This exponential function, and the trivial one, are the only two functions on Z that satisfy the conditions.Giuseppina Terzo, Some Consequences of Schanuel's Conjecture in Exponential Rings, Communications in Algebra, Volume 36, Issue 3 (2008), pp.1171-1189. Open problems Exponential fields are much-studied objects in model theory, occasionally providing a link between it and number theory as in the case of Zilber's work on Schanuel's conjecture. It was proved in the 1990s that Rexp is model complete, a result known as Wilkie's theorem. This result, when combined with Khovanskiƒ≠'s theorem on pfaffian functions, proves that Rexp is also o-minimal.A.J. Wilkie, Model completeness results for expansions of the ordered field of real numbers by restricted Pfaffian functions and the exponential function, J. Amer. Math. Soc., 9 (1996), pp. 1051‚Äì1094. On the other hand, it is known that Cexp is not model complete.David Marker, A remark on Zilber's pseudoexponentiation, The Journal of Symbolic Logic, 71, no.3 (2006), pp. 791‚Äì798. The question of decidability is still unresolved. Alfred Tarski posed the question of the decidability of Rexp and hence it is now known as Tarski's exponential function problem. It is known that if the real version of Schanuel's conjecture is true then Rexp is decidable.A.J. Macintyre, A.J.

History Founded by Arthur John Wheaton, (known as Jack) in 1926, using his initials AJW, the company began production in the workshop of the family printing works in Friernhay Street Exeter. Initially using 496 cc single-cylinder engines from MAG of Switzerland and a 996 cc V-twin British Anzani engine, as well as more traditional and well-proven overhead-valve JAP engines. The frames were from Brough Superior. Launched at the Olympia Show in 1928 the AJW Super Four had an Anzani water- cooled engine but was never produced. The best-known AJW motorcycles were the Grey Fox and the Red Panther but the company also produced a range of bikes with names including the Silver Fox, Silver Vixen, the Vixen, Flying Vixen, Flying Fox (with a Rudge Ulster engine) and the Speed Fox. AJW motorcycles were well-made but expensive \\"top of the range\\" machines; the 996 cc AJW Summit was capable of . With a torpedo-shaped fuel tank and full duplex tubular loop frame, the engine had twin-port heads and double exhaust pipes down each side. Enthusiast owners included Brooklands racing champions such as Claude Temple and Joe Wright. Production was limited so they became fairly exclusive, with just 250 motorcycles produced in their best year. The company survived the Great Depression of the 1930s but the Anzani powered V-twin was discontinued in 1931. Three JAP-engined models were produced in 1934 and 1935 but in 1937 the business was sold and production stopped completely for the duration of the Second World War. After the war it changed hands again, firstly to Jack Ball of Bournemouth and then to a dealer in Wimborne, Dorset. The last AJW motorcycle produced was the 125 cc Fox Cub in 1953, after which JAP engines were no longer available. The 48 cc Fox Cub was sold until 1964, when AJW became an importer of 500 cc and 125 cc Italian two-stroke Wolfhound motorcycles with AJW branding. The company ceased trading in 1981.

SOMAIR is owned by Areva at 63.4% and the government of Niger at 36.6% and employed about 600 people. In 1978, the second uranium mining project began production in Akokan near Arlit and operated by COMINAK, a national company, like SOMAIR with Areva and the government of Niger as shareholders. COMINAK is owned by Areva NC at 34%, the government of Niger at 31%, Overseas uranium resources development Company of Japan at 25%, and Enusa industrias avanzadas, S.a. of Spain at 10% and employed about 1,100 people. The underground mine of Akokan is the largest underground uranium mine in the world. COMINAK, The largest underground uranium mine The mining activities created an economic boom in the country, as Nigerien budgets flourished in the 1970s due to record uranium prices. Extracted uranium from SOMAIR and COMINAK was initially sold entirely by French concessionary corporations, with contracts later revised to give Niger both an overall contract payment, rent, and a smaller amount of ore it could sell on world markets. In addition to the mines of SOMAIR and COMINAK, the Azelik mine at of Arlit was opened in 2011 and operated by SOMINA. The stakeholders in SOMINA are: China National Nuclear Corporation at 37.2%, the government of Niger through the national mining company (SOPAMIN) at 33%, ZXJOY, a Chinese, at 24.8% and KORES, a Korean national company, at 5%.

Imouraren mine opening delayed = Coal = The history of coal exploration and mining dates back to 1968 when coal reserves were discovered in Anou Araren by an exploration team led by the French Atomic Commission Commissariat √† l‚Äô√©nergie atomique. This discovery and the parallel discovery and exploitation of uranium mines in the same region of Niger lead to the creation of SONICHAR in 1975. The goal was to mine coal which will be used as a fuel to power the thermal power plants in order to supply power to uranium mining activities in Arlit. In 1980, coal mining began at Anou Araren and a year later, the thermal power plant was in operation. Since then, coal mining projects have stagnated. In 2008, coal reserves . In 2014, construction for the second coal mine began in Salkadamna in Takanamatt, Tahoua Region. The coal extracted from the mine will supply a 600 MW power plant and coal briquette plant adjacent to the mine. Beginning of construction for the Salkadamna coal and power plant complex The Anou Araren coal reserves are estimated at 15 million tonnes and in 2011, 246,016 tonnes of coal were extracted from the mine. Drivers and Impediments Regional Cooperation on the Way to Sustainable Nuclear Energy Systems La production du charbon au Niger - Annuaire statistique du Niger 2011 The coal reserves at Salkadamna are estimated at 70 million tonnes. = Gold = Exploitable deposits of gold have long been known to exist in south western region of Niger and more recently in northern region of Agadez. Artisanal gold mining was already conducted between the Niger River and the border with Burkina Faso.Background Note:Niger, United States State Department, Bureau of Public Affairs: Electronic Information and Publications Office. Bureau of African Affairs. September 2008. This article incorporates text from this U.S. government source, which is in the public domain. In 2004, the Samira Hill Gold Mine, operated by Mining company of Liptako, began production. The mining company of Liptako owned by two Canadian companies at 40% each and the government of Niger at 20%. The gold production in 2011 is 1,564 kg from this mine and has decreased steadily since 2008. Production de produit mineraux Table 27.02 In 2014, two gold deposits have been found in the Agadez Region in Djado and Mount Ibl, 700 and 360 km from Agadez city, respectively.Discovery of Gold Deposit in Djado in Agadez.Last accessed on 9/20/2014Discovery of a new Gold Deposit around Mount Ibl in Agadez.Last accessed 9/20/2014 The site in Djado was discovered in April 2014 and resulted in a gold rush that attracted local inhabitants of Agadez as well as prospectors from neighboring countries like Chad, Sudan and Burkina Faso. Activities at the Djado site were temporarily ceased in order to organize exploration and artisanal extraction activities, to improve infrastructures, principally water supply and to improve the security presence. The site near Mount Ibl was discovered in September 2014. Exploration permits are required for all prospectors prior to accessing the sites. = Cement = The cement extraction industry exist in Niger since 1964 when the Malbaza cement plant was opened. Awaiting for the cement plant of Malbaza Located in the Tahoua Region, the cement plant has been the only such project until 2014. In 2011, work for expanding the cement plant of Malbaza began with the expectation to increase its production capacity by 13 folds. In 2014, work began for a new cement plant in Keita in the Tahoua Region. Launching of construction work for the second cement plant in Niger in Keita, Tahoua The Malbaza cement plant presently produces 40,000 tonnes per year and, upon expansion, is expected to reach 540,000 tonnes per year. The Keita cement under construction is expected to produce 1 million tonnes per year at startup and 1.5 million tonnes per year afterwards. Labor issues According to the U.S. Department of Labor, 47.8% of children aged 5 to 14 are working children and 4.3% of them are engaged in hazardous activities in the industrial sector, mining for trona, salt, gypsum and gold.Niger, 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor The Department's 2014 List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor reported that Niger's mining industry still resorts to such practices in the production of these goods.

Palaeographically it has been assigned to the 11th century.K. Aland, M. Welte, B. K√∂ster, K. Junack, \\"Kurzgefasste Liste der griechischen Handschriften des Neues Testaments\\", Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, New York 1994, p. 57. It has marginalia.  Description  The codex contains a complete text of the four Gospels on 252 parchment leaves (size ). The text is written in one column per page, in 19 lines per page, in light-brown ink. The large initial letters are written in gold. The text is divided according to the (chapters), whose numbers are given at the margin, and the (titles of chapters) at the top of the pages. There is also the Ammonian Sections (in Mark 233 sections, the last section in 16:8), with references to the Eusebian Canons (written below Ammonian Section mnumbers). It contains Prolegomena, tables of the (tables of contents) before each Gospel, subscriptions at the end of each Gospel, synaxaria, Menologion, and pictures.  Text  The Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type. According to Hermann von Soden it is related to the Byzantine commentated text (Ak). Aland placed it in Category V. According to the Claremont Profile Method it represents the textual family Kx in Luke 1 and Luke 20, with some relationship to cluster 1442. In Luke 10 no profile was made. The pericope Pericope Adulterae (John 7:53-8:11) is omitted.  History  The manuscript was once in the property of Achilles Statius, as also was minuscule 171. It was examined by Bianchini, Birch (about 1782), and Scholz (1794-1852). C. R. Gregory saw it in 1886. It is currently housed at the Biblioteca Vallicelliana (B. 133), at Rome.

This helps in minimizing intersymbol interference (ISI). The combined response of two such filters is that of the raised-cosine filter. It obtains its name from the fact that its frequency response, H_{rrc}(f), is the square root of the frequency response of the raised-cosine filter, H_{rc}(f): :H_{rc}(f) = H_{rrc}(f)cdot H_{rrc}(f) or: :H_{rrc}(f) = sqrt{H_{rc}(f)}  Why it is required  To have minimum ISI (Intersymbol interference), the overall response of transmit filter, channel response and receive filter has to satisfy Nyquist ISI criterion. Raised-cosine filter is the most popular filter response satisfying this criterion. Half of this filtering is done on the transmit side and half is done on the receive side. On the receive side, the channel response, if it can be accurately estimated, can also be taken into account so that the overall response is Raised-cosine filter.  Mathematical Description  The impulse response of a root-raised cosine filter multiplied by Ts, for three values of Œ≤: 1.0 (blue), 0.5 (red) and 0 (green). The RRC filter is characterised by two values; Œ≤, the roll-off factor, and Ts the reciprocal of the symbol-rate. The impulse response of such a filter can be given as: :h(t) = begin{cases} dfrac{1}{T_s} left( 1 + beta(dfrac{4}{pi}-1) right), & t = 0  dfrac{beta}{T_s sqrt{2}} left[ left(1+dfrac{2}{pi}right)sinleft(dfrac{pi}{4beta}right) + left(1-dfrac{2}{pi}right)cosleft(dfrac{pi}{4beta}right) right], & t = pm dfrac{T_s}{4beta}  dfrac{1}{T_s} dfrac{sinleft[pi dfrac{t}{T_s}left(1-betaright)right] + 4betadfrac{t}{T_s}cosleft[pidfrac{t}{T_s}left(1+betaright)right]}{pi dfrac{t}{T_s}left[1-left(4betadfrac{t}{T_s} right)^2 right]}, & mbox{otherwise} end{cases}, though there are other forms as well. Unlike the raised-cosine filter, the impulse response is not zero at the intervals of ¬±Ts. However, the combined transmit and receive filters form a raised-cosine filter which does have zero at the intervals of ¬±Ts. Only in the case of Œ≤=0 does the root raised-cosine have zeros at ¬±Ts.

It may refer to a language, religion/ritual, social value and/or social custom. These features are often a norm for an entire society. It achieves dominance by being perceived as pertaining to a majority of the population and having a significant presence in institutions relating to communication, education, artistic expression, law, government and business. The concept of \\"dominant culture\\" is generally used in academic discourse in fields such as sociology, anthropology and cultural studies. The culture that is dominant within a particular geopolitical entity can change over time in response to internal or external factors, but one is usually very resilient and able to reproduce itself effectively from generation to generation. In a polycultural society, various cultures are celebrated and respected equally. A dominant culture can be promoted deliberately and by the suppression of minority cultures or subcultures. Examples and applications=Native American studies= In the United States, a distinction is often made between the indigenous culture of Native Americans, and a dominant culture that may be described as \\"WASP\\", \\"Anglo\\", \\"white\\", \\"middle class\\", and so on. Some Native Americans are seen as being part of the culture of their own tribe, community, or family, while simultaneously participating in the dominant culture of America as a whole. =Other American groups= Ethnic groups are said to exist in the United States in relation to a dominant culture, generally seen as English-speaking, of European ancestry, and Protestant Christian faith. Asian Americans, Jews, African Americans, Latinos, and Deaf people, among others, are seen as facing a choice to oppose, be opposed by, assimilate into, acculturate (i.e. exist alongside), or otherwise react to the dominant culture.

Their focus during these events is to dissolve the perception of Africans' inferiority in society. Other \\"hot topics\\" in the Black community during the Day of Black Awareness are the assimilation of African-Brazilian laborers with Caucasian-Brazilian and other laborers, ethnic identity, and black pride.

Later that year, Aiken was succeeded by Dr Patrick Hillery and then the event took place that was to shape Gallagher's life: the North erupted into violence. On Saturday, 16 August 1969, Gallagher, as weekend duty officer for the department, encountered a group of nationalist MPs from the North, including Paddy Devlin, who arrived at Iveagh House demanding to meet Taoiseach Jack Lynch to obtain arms for the beleaguered Catholics of the Falls Road in Belfast. He told them he would convey their request for a meeting to his superiors in the department. Foreign service His first foreign posting was to the Irish consulate in San Francisco in August 1971 ‚Äì he and his college sweetheart, Maeve Farrell, from Ratoath, Co Meath, had just been married the previous month. After a few sojourns at the United Nations in New York City, Gallagher found himself at the Irish Embassy in London serving from 1973 to 1977 as press officer. He was present at the Sunningdale negotiations in 1973, leading to the ill-fated powersharing deal. He was sent to Brussels in the early 1980s as a deputy chef de cabinet with the European Commission. He got his first ambassadorial posting in 1985 ‚Äì in Lagos, Nigeria, where his contacts with Irish missionaries in particular taught him \\"a great deal about what matters in life\\". He returned to Dublin to take charge of the Anglo-Irish division, with responsibility for Northern Ireland policy. That was the time of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which Charles Haughey had vehemently opposed in opposition. But when Haughey took over as Taoiseach in 1987 he told Gallagher he wanted the agreement implemented \\"fully and imaginatively\\". He was appointed Ambassador to the US in 1991 where, as usual, he quickly developed a wide range of friendships and contacts. One of these was Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas. His White House contacts proved advantageous when the nascent Irish peace process faced its first major challenge: securing a US visa for Sinn F√©in leader Gerry Adams. After his posting in Washington DC he returned home in 1997 with the title of Second Secretary General. Bertie Ahern was Taoiseach and eager to make a contribution to peace in the North. Gallagher put together a team of officials for the negotiations at Stormont, including David Cooney, who succeeded him as Secretary General. After the success of the Good Friday Agreement, Gallagher moved to the Department of the Taoiseach as Secretary General of that department. After his departure, this post was combined with the position of Secretary-General to the Government, under Dermot McCarthy. Then it was back to Iveagh House as that department's Secretary-General. Academic career The Governing Authority of University College Dublin approved the appointment of Gallagher as chairman on Tuesday, 24 February 2009, to replace Kieran McGowan, who chaired the Governing Authority since February 2004.

Formerly, it was a small, separate hamlet, and became fully absorbed into Wombourne only in the 20th century.See the 1899-1904 series OS maps at Staffordshire Past Track Population details for the 2011 census can be found under Wombourne. Etymology The name is derived from the Anglian dialect of Old English, in which the word brƒìc signifies newly broken-in land.Margaret Gelling, Place-names in the Landscape, Dent, London, 1984, , p.233 There are a number of Bratches in Staffordshire, e.g. near Enville and Norton Canes. In each case, they are near the edges of ancient forests, so a bratch was a new clearing in the waste.W. H. Duignan, Notes on Staffordshire Place Names, Henry Frowde, London, 1902. Bratch Locks The Bratch Locks are a noted feature of the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, planned by James Brindley, and opened in 1772 as a three lock staircase. They were later re-engineered as three separate locks. They are served by two bridges, a toll house, and a keeper's cottage. The whole forms a well-preserved example of vernacular Georgian architecture and design, built of mellow local brick. Bird's Eye View of Bratch Locks in Wombourne Bratch Pumping Station A notable example of Victorian architecture and engineering, the Bratch Pumping Station was built in 1895. It was the result of a dispute over water pricing between Bilston Urban District Council and the Borough of Wolverhampton, which had supplied Bilston's water hitherto. Bilston's council decided to secure an independent water supply for the town. After some debate, it was decided to build a water works about seven miles from Bilston, at the Bratch. The pumping station tower was built with ornate brickwork and extravagant pinnacles: it is clearly visible from the canal. Originally, there was also a tall, Italianate chimney stack, but this was demolished after the works became obsolete. Two steam engines pumped water from the underlying sandstone for more than six decades. They were generally used in turn, rather than simultaneously, and raised the water about 50 metres from the underlying Bunter sandstone. It was then pumped to a reservoir on the then border between Wolverhampton and Bilston, at Goldthorn Hill, about 100 metres higher. The site is still used for water extraction by Severn Trent, although the pumping station became redundant in 1960. The building and one of the engines were restored from 1991. With the support of Severn Trent and Friends of the Bratch, Chief Engineer Len Crane and a local group of enthusiasts hold steamings at public holidays. The former Wombourn railway station Wombourn railway station (the correct spelling, as the final 'e' became common only later) was located at the Bratch, about 200 metres from the locks. It served the Wombourne Branch Line of the Great Western Railway, which was built between 1913 and 1925. The line was never heavily used by passengers, and ceased to function as a peacetime passenger line as early as 1932, although it proved important for the transport of strategic materials and troops during World War II. After 1945, its decline continued and it was closed in 1965 as part of the Beeching cuts. The line runs roughly parallel to the canal and to the Smestow Brook. The former railway land has become the South Staffordshire Railway Walk Local Nature Reserve and the Smestow Valley Local Nature Reserve. The track bed has become a bridle path, giving walkers, cyclists and riders views of, and access to, a large area of Staffordshire countryside. The station, meanwhile, has become an information point and caf√©. It has a car park for visitors, and the site is also the base for a number of community groups.

It is a hybrid, based on an enlarged M113 chassis equipped with the complete two-man power- operated turret of the M2 Bradley IFV. The EIFV never entered production for Egyptian Army. History The EIFV was originally developed by BAE Systems, Ground Systems Division under contract to the Egyptian Ministry of Defense. It was developed to be a conversion of the M113, of which the Egyptian Army has a total of 2,650, as well as an additional 1,200 AIFVs (modified M113s), but it can also be produced as new vehicles. Design activities first commenced in 1995, and the first prototype was assembled in the Egyptian Military Plant 200 where assembly of the M1 Abrams is carried out for the Egyptian Army. The first prototype was completed by Egyptian Military Plant 200 in 1996 and performance validation trials were completed in mid-1997. The EIFV has not entered production. Description The EIFV has three crewman, and can carry six soldiers, who enter the vehicle via a rear drop ramp. The driver is seated at the left front of the hull with the engine compartment to his right. The driver has a single-piece pop-up hatch cover which rotates over the engine cooling air intake grill when open, and is provided with four, day periscopes for observation. The commander and the gunner are both positioned in the turret itself, and a hatch is provided for the commander on the turret roof. =Armor= The M113 chassis is enlarged to accommodate several modifications and to allow for more armor to be added. The hull of the EIFV is of all-welded 5083 aluminum armour which provides protection from small arms fire and shell splinters, able to defeat armour-piercing projectiles up to 14.5 mm in calibre over a 360¬∞ arc of attack. Aluminum provides protection similar to that of steel armor while keeping the vehicle lightweight. An armor upgrade package produced by the AOI can significantly enhance the armor on the EIFV even further, allowing it to withstand armor-piercing 23 mm rounds, without sacrificing the vehicle's mobility. Optional upgrades for the vehicle include air conditioning, NBC protection and firing ports. =Maneuverability= To cope with the increased size and armor of the vehicle, a more powerful 400 hp Detroit Diesel 6V53TIA turbocharged/aftercooled diesel engine is installed in place of the original 275 hp engine on the M113, giving a power-to-weight ratio of 20 hp/ton. This is coupled to an Allison X200 cross-drive, four-speed Hydrokinetic transmission. As a result of the longer chassis and improved engine a sixth road wheel is added (the M113 only has five). As an option the vehicle can be of 350 hp only. The modifications allows the EIFV to keep up in terms of speed and mobility with modern tanks such as the M1A1/A2 Abrams, which are used by the Egyptian Army, despite the added weight. The vehicle can traverse slopes up to 80%, side slopes of 40%, trenches 2200 mm wide, and vertical obstacles with a height of 710 mm. =Armament= The M2 Bradley turret provides the EIFV with considerable firepower on a cheap M113 chassis, and allows it to engage personnel, armored vehicles and tanks, as well as low flying targets and helicopters. It has the same fire control and stabilization features on the M2 Bradley. The armament consists of the 25 mm M242 chain gun with 800 rounds and an effective range of 3000 m, and a coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun with 2,100 rounds. Using armor-piercing rounds, the chain gun can engage armored vehicles and tanks. The turret also has a two-tube TOW launcher, capable of launching TOW II ATGM missiles, which can destroy most tanks at a maximum range of 3750 m, enabling the vehicle to be used in an anti tank role. The only major drawback is that the missiles can only be launched when the vehicle is stationary. In addition to the two missiles in the launcher are four more missiles, stowed away inside the vehicle. The turret is standard equipped with passive IR and thermal imaging equipment.

History Francisco I. Madero, who called on Mexicans to rise up on November 20, 1910 The Mexican Revolution brought the overthrow of liberal Army general Porfirio D√≠az after 35 years as president of Mexico (1876-1911). In the 1910 presidential election, wealthy landowner Francisco I. Madero opposed D√≠az. D√≠az jailed Madero, who then escaped, issuing the Plan of San Luis Potos√≠ on October 6, 1910. In that plan, Madero declared the results of the 1910 election fraudulent, nullified them, asserted that he was provisional president, and called for Mexicans to rise up against D√≠az on November 20, 1910.Stuart F. Voss, \\"Plan of San Luis Potos√≠\\". Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture vol. 4, p. 421. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. He wrote \\"Throw the usurpers from power, recover your rights as free men, and remember that our ancestors left us a heritage of glory which we are not able to stain. Be as they were: invincible in war, magnanimous in victory.\\" Republic Square. The commemoration is celebrated in Mexico as an official holiday. Until 2006 and again from 2009 to 2013 the national celebrations were located at the Zocalo in Mexico City. Given the recent political and national tragedies that happened in 2014 the parades were called off at the aftermath of the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping, (this was the case also in 2015), and the celebrations happened in the Campo Marte in the capital, thus pushing the national parade up to November 23, Navy Day, with only Mexican Navy personnel in attendance. Thus the national November 20 parades, during the remaining years of the Enrique Pe√±a Nieto presidency, had now been replaced by state level ones, which have been held in major cities all over the nation as per tradition, but in a reduced basis, given recent cancellations due to protest actions on the said date in several state capitals. During the presidency of Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, the traditional civil-military-athletic parade was finally reinstated in 2019. The first crucial revolution during the 20th century was the Mexican Revolution.Green, Susan Marie. \\"Mexican Revolution.\\" Multicultural America: A Multimedia Encyclopedia, edited by Carlos E.

Around 1 million legal migrants entered the United States throughout the revolution along with many other undocumented migrants. This occurred four years before the introduction of a patrol between the borders. The constitution created in 1917, in response to the revolution, established limits on the period of time politicians could be in power.\\"Mexican Revolution.\\" Worldmark Modern Conflict and Diplomacy, edited by Elizabeth P.

The Constitution also included labor reform laws that covered 8 hour workdays, abolished child labor, and established equal pay.  Effect of revolution on gender  On the Commemoration of the Centenary of the Mexican Revolution the Federal District Government carried out the rehabilitation and restoration of Republic Square, Monumento a la Revoluci√≥n (Monument to the Revolution) and National Museum of the Revolution. The revolution that occurred during 1910 greatly affected gender roles present in Mexico. However, it continued to create a strict separation between genders although both men and women were involved in the revolution. Women were involved by promoting political reform as well as enlisting in the military. Women who were involved in political reform would create reports that outlined the changes people wanted to see in their area. That type of activism was seen inside and outside of the cities. Women not only took political action but also enlisted in the military and became teachers to contribute to the change that they wanted to see after the revolution. Women were seen as prizes by many men involved in the military. Being involved in the military gave men a greater sense of superiority over women, which gave women the connotation of being a prize.Cano, Gabriela. \\"Mexican Revolution and Sexuality.\\" Global Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) History, edited by Howard Chiang, et al., vol. 2, Charles Scribner's Sons, 2019, pp. 1035-1039.

That idea often lead to violence against women, which meanwhile increased. After the revolution, the ideas women contributed to the revolution were put on hold for many years. Women would oftentimes promote the ideas of establishing a greater justice system and creating ideals surrounded by democracy. The revolution caused many people to further reinstate the idea that women were meant to be taking care of the household. Women were also put in the lower part of the social class because of this idea. = Female soldiers during the Revolution = Oftentimes women who had been discarded by their families would join the military. Being involved in the military would lead to scrutiny amongst some male participants. In order to avoid sexual abuse many women would make themselves appear more masculine. They would also dress more masculine in order to gain more experience with handling weapons, and learning more about military jobs.  Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s Gonz√°lez  An example of this is presented by Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s Gonz√°lez who was a secret agent involved in Carranza's army. She would, oftentimes, present herself as a man in order to complete certain tasks assigned to her. After she completed these tasks she would return to her feminine appearance.  Rosa Bobadilla  Rosa Bodilla, however, maintained her feminine appearance throughout her military career. She joined the Zapata's military with her husband. When he died, she was given his title, which became \\"Colonel Rosa Bobadila widow of Casas.\\" She gave orders to men while continuing to dress as a female.  Amelio Robles  After the revolution, Amelio Robles continued to look like and identify as a male for the rest of his life. Robles abandoned his home in order to join the Zapata military. Throughout the war, Robles began to assume a more masculine identity. After the war, he did not return to his former appearance like other females had. Robles carried on with his life as Amelio, and remained to look as well as act masculine. He reestablished himself into the community as a male, and was recognized as a male on his military documents. Date Article 74 of the Mexican labor law (Ley Federal del Trabajo) provides that the third Monday of November (regardless the date) will be the official Day of the Revolution holiday in Mexico. This was a modification of the law made in 2005, effective since 2006; before then, it was November 20 regardless of the day, and all schools gave extended holidays if the day was a Tuesday or Thursday.

It was part of a global outcry by the Tamil diaspora to end the Sri Lankan Civil War, investigate acts of war crimes by the Government of Sri Lanka, and restore civil rights for Tamils in Sri Lanka. The aim was also to create awareness and appeal to leaders, notably the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, the President of the United States, Barack Obama and the Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Canada, Bandula Jayasekara, to take action in ending the conflict. Several Tamil Canadian citizens and business-owners from different parts of Canada and the United States took part in major protests set up in Toronto and Ottawa, while smaller scale demonstrations took place in Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary. The first notable demonstration took place on 28 January 2009 in front of the Sri Lankan Consulate in Toronto involving a few hundred people. The following day, several thousands gathered in front of the Consulate of the United States in Toronto to appeal to the Government of the United States to take action on ending the civil war. A human chain of several thousands of citizens took place the next day along major streets in Downtown Toronto. There after, demonstrations began to escalate in size and occurred on Parliament Hill in Ottawa for sometime, until returning to continue in Toronto. Other tactics by protesters included, sit-ins, hunger strikes, Internet activism and occupation of major streets. Major events=Early demonstrations= Tamil students conduct a hunger strike at the University of Toronto Scarborough on 27 January 2009 In the Greater Toronto Area, local Tamil communities and organizations began to set up demonstrations by January 2009, following similar movements in the United Kingdom and India regarding the large civilian casualties from the Sri Lankan Civil War. Tamil Student Associations at the University of Toronto and Ryerson University staged demonstrations on campus to promote awareness of the ethnic conflict to fellow students. During the week of 25 January, several Tamil media outlets announced a strike, requesting all Tamils to not attend work or school during the week and take part in the protests that would happen in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary. On 28 January, several Tamils gathered in front of the Consulate of Sri Lanka in Toronto to protest, with hopes to meet the consulate general. However, the consulate general, Bandula Jayasekara, reportedly termed the protesters as \\"terrorists\\" and refused to admit them. The protest resumed until the evening. The following day, 29 January, several protesters gathered in front of the Consulate of the United States throughout the day, appealing to the consulate general of the United States to pressure its government to take an action on ending the war. The next demonstration took the form of a human chain on 30 January in Downtown Toronto, comprising thousands of protesters along parts of Yonge Street, Front Street and University Avenue. Slogans such as \\"We want justice\\", \\"Sri Lanka, end the war\\" and \\"Canada help us\\" were chanted by the protesters across the streets. According to a Toronto Police Service spokesperson, \\"the protest took place in a very peaceful and orderly manner.\\" =Parliament Hill protests= The first major protest in Ottawa, the capital city of Canada, took place on 4 February 2009 at Parliament Hill in an effort to attract the attention of Canada's parliament members. Thousands of Tamils gathered in front of the Peace Tower, subsequently drawing out a few politicians from inside, notably Bev Oda and New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jack Layton. Layton announced that he would call parliament to an emergency debate at the House of Commons. Oda announced that the government would provide financial aid to the affected civilians, with the help of World Vision and M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res. On 6 April 2009, a non-stop, continuous demonstration began at Parliament Hill, organized by Tamil Student Associations and the Canadian Tamil Congress. The protest, similar to non-stop demonstrations that were contemporaneously held elsewhere in the world, such as London and Sydney, saw bus-loads of protesters joining. Ottawa Police Service, Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) oversaw the protests, which were deemed \\"peaceful.\\" On 7 April 2009, Albert Street was blocked when Tamil demonstrators surrounded a Soci√©t√© de transport de l'Outaouais bus in the intersection at Elgin Street, which caused major detours of transit buses.https://ottawacitizen.com/Tamil+Traffic/1477251/story.html As of 20 April, the non-stop protest took its fourteenth consecutive day. A few streets in the vicinity of Parliament Hill had closed down to make way for demonstrators. The protest was the decision by several Tamil organizations after the Government of Sri Lanka ruled out a ceasefire and allegedly forced an attack in Northern Sri Lanka with an unknown chemical warfare substance, claiming the lives of nearly 2,000 civilians. Five protesters of varying ages also began fast-unto-death hunger strikes, but were forced to end ten days later due to deteriorating health. The protest was expected to continue until the Government of Canada forced negotiations with the Government of Sri Lanka. After a climactic protest with an estimated 30,000 protesters at Parliament Hill on 21 April, the \\"non-stop protest\\" in Ottawa came to an end. Ottawa City Councillor Eli El-Chantiry announced the policing costs for the protest to be nearly C$800,000 which the federal government was expected to pay. =University Avenue sit-ins= Protesters occupying University Avenue in Toronto on 29 April 2009 A week after the non-stop protests in Ottawa ended, non-stop protests began on the evening of 26 April in front of the Consulate of the United States in Toronto, urging Barack Obama to call for an immediate permanent ceasefire. Protesters sat down on University Avenue, occupying a large portion of the street. On the third day of the non-stop protest (29 April), fifteen arrests were made while one woman was injured after a brief scuffle with police. This incident was the first one to happen among these protests in Canada. The protests later shifted to Queen's Park with a diminished number of protesters. Another major human chain, which was expected to occur 5 May, was abruptly postponed the previous night by organizers because of the impact of previous demonstrations. The cancellation was reported throughout Facebook, Twitter, Tamil television and radio stations and word of mouth. Some thought the cancellation was because of the recent swine flu outbreak. The postponed human chain demonstration instead took place on 9 May through Downtown Toronto, reminiscent of the one that occurred on 30 January. =Gardiner Expressway blockade= Protesters blocking vehicular traffic on the Gardiner Expressway on 10 May 2009 On 10 May, an immediate vigil and protest was launched in light of international reports of the shelling of Tamil civilians in the Sri Lanka Army-declared safe zone in which 378 civilians had been killed, while protesters claimed it to be nearly 3,000. The protest began on Spadina Avenue but abruptly spread past police cordons onto the Gardiner Expressway, a busy freeway in the city, bringing all vehicular traffic to a halt. The protesters, including women and children in strollers, said they would not stop blocking the Gardiner Expressway until they met with a representative from Premier Dalton McGuinty's office and got a promise for a clear course of action to stop the civil war in Sri Lanka. Police subsequently shut-down the Gardiner Expressway and Toronto's Don Valley Parkway, causing heavy traffic congestions throughout other Toronto streets and highways. York Regional Police, Peel Regional Police and the OPP were called in for back up policing. It was the first time a major highway was unlawfully occupied in the city. CP24 aired the protest live as breaking news coverage throughout the evening. The protest continued throughout the night, demanding an immediate response to the latest casualties in Sri Lanka. The highway was cleared and reopened after a message from the Liberal Party of Canada stated that they would make a statement on the issue soon. Three individuals were arrested during the protest for assaulting a police officer while on duty. The next day, peaceful protests continued in front of the Consulate of Sri Lanka on the sidewalk of Spadina Avenue and at Queen's Park simultaneously. York Regional Police, Peel Regional Police, the OPP and the RCMP continued to help Toronto Police Service to prevent civil disobedience as what had happened the previous night. Toronto Mayor David Miller urged that such tactics as blockading the Gardiner Expressway not be used again. Police officials decried the use of children during such dangerous tactics. =Queen's Park rally= On 13 May several thousands of protesters crowded in front of Queen's Park protesting another offensive by the Sri Lanka Army, resulting in a situation which was termed by the United Nations as a \\"bloodbath.\\" Traffic was blocked and police forces with riot control mounted on horses were present. After demonstrations took place at Queen's Park, the protesters flooded portions of College Street, Yonge Street, Queen Street and University Avenue for a march. The immediate demands of the protest were to call for an immediate permanent ceasefire, allow media and journalists into the warzone and to place diplomatic sanctions on Sri Lanka. The protesters also ran a food-drive, asking for non-perishable food items. David Miller attended the protest and remarked, \\"some people would probably be offended by the flag and afraid to show their support for these people, but I'm not here about politics.\\" The very same day, Barack Obama made a statement on the Sri Lankan Civil War, calling upon the Sri Lanka Army and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to stop the \\"bloodbath\\" and to stop the use of human- shields Toronto's Sinhalese community set up a counter-demonstration, condemning the Tamil protesters. The anti-Tamil protests blamed the Tamils to be \\"terrorists\\" and flew a private airplane with a banner attached to it reading \\"Protect Canada ‚Äì Stop the Tamil Tigers\\", circling Queen's Park for some time. Post-civil war After the march from Queen's Park, protests continued in front of the Consulate of the United States in Toronto, even after Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapakse declared a victory over the LTTE on 17 May, which officially marked the end of the Sri Lankan Civil War. Post- civil war, the goal of the protests were to ensure peace and better treatment of Tamil civilians and investigate war crimes by the Government of Sri Lanka. Protests also continuously happened in front of the Consulate of the United States in Montreal. Protesters held non-stop protests, urging Stephen Harper, who had not yet given any remarks on protests, to make a statement on the issue and request immediate humanitarian aid to be sent to the island nation. The Canadian Tamil Congress urged the European Union for a unanimous investigation of war crimes. Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs Lawrence Cannon reflected by announcing that \\"Canada would work with the United States helping the United Nations deliver humanitarian aid to Sri Lanka.\\" In the meantime, Toronto's Sinhalese community continued to hold counter-Tamil protests, claiming that they were in danger by the LTTE. Throughout the remainder of 2009, the protests continued but became smaller as attendance decreased to about two dozen at most, happening only in front of the Consulate of the United States on University Avenue, and only during the daytime. On the 150th day, petitions were given out to protesters to sign, as they were in many other Tamil diaspora demonstrations around the world, and given to a guard at the Consulate of the United States. As of 13 October, the protest had reached its 173rd day. Impact=Government response= During the first Parliament Hill protest in Ottawa, Jack Layton had called for an emergency debate on 4 February, gathering all members of parliament at the House of Commons. It had occurred despite the absence of Prime Minister Stephen Harper. A few members of parliament, such as John McCallum and Robert Oliphant, brought up concerns of whether the aid the government sends, which was announced to be C$3 million, would successfully reach the affected civilians or not. Canada's Minister of State for the Americas Peter Kent, in an argument, suggested that extortions and funds underlying of the LTTE may still be present in Toronto. Immediately, Liberal member of parliament Jim Karygiannis assured that there were no cases of such extortions in recent times after phoning a few national security agencies. Kent reflected back, saying that both the LTTE and the Sri Lanka Army must drop their weapons in order for the war to end. Karygiannis stated that the wish of his constituency, Scarborough‚ÄîAgincourt, was that the ceasefire should not be initiated by the Government of Sri Lanka or by the Government of India but should be a United Nations-initiated, internationally sponsored ceasefire. Liberal member of parliament Irwin Cotler condemned Sri Lanka's restrictions on international humanitarian aid, journalists and media to reach the affected areas of northern Sri Lanka, which has been in place for several years. He suggested to bring forth an immediate ceasefire and begin negotiation talks. The United Nations, too, were condemned for not taking an active part in ending the civil war. Deepak Obhrai, a Conservative member of parliament, was the only member to label the LTTE at fault, referring to the assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. A final report from the debate outlined four recommendations of action: # The Government of Canada should continue to call upon all parties in Sri Lanka to immediately cease fire and end hostilities. # The Government of Canada should redouble its efforts in cooperation with other states to meet the humanitarian needs of all civilians in northeastern Sri Lanka, including those still in the combat zone and those in IDP camps, by securing a sufficient humanitarian pause and through international supervision of assistance. # The Government of Canada should stand ready to increase Canadian assistance to Sri Lanka in collaboration with other partners, as on-the-ground assessments and capacity to absorb warrant, not only for relief purposes but also for development and reconstruction. In addition to ensuring that assistance reaches those who need it most, the government should pursue a whole-of-government strategy to ensure that Canadian assistance of all sorts encourages longer-term reconciliation among communities in Sri Lanka. # The Government of Canada should call on the United Nations Security Council to seriously engage itself in the resolution of the conflict in Sri Lanka, and to investigate the conduct of both parties during the conflict with respect to international law. The Government of Canada should also initiate a dialogue with the Government of Sri Lanka, in conjunction with the international community, aimed at laying the groundwork for a political reconciliation between the communities. If these efforts fail, the Government of Canada should consider financial and diplomatic sanctions, including, but not limited to, advocating for Sri Lanka's suspension from the Commonwealth, as well as incentives. =Other political remarks= Police officers prepare to confront protesters on the Gardiner Expressway During the non-stop protests in Ottawa, Lawrence Cannon requested the Government of Sri Lanka for an immediate ceasefire. He also rejected calls from the High Commissioner of Sri Lanka in Canada to stop all protests in Ottawa. Cannon condemned the LTTE for preventing civilians from leaving areas being attacked and using them as human shields. Bev Oda and the Conservative Party of Canada both condemned the use of LTTE flags, insisting that they symbolize connection with a terrorist organization. David Miller and Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty also condemned the Gardiner Expressway blockade. Liberal Party of Canada leader Michael Ignatieff had made statements on the protests in a few occasions. Ignatieff urged the Harper government to break its silence and take initiative in condemning the violence. He stated that there are no military solutions to the conflict and that the war must stop under a worldwide initiative and internationally coordinated diplomatic strategy. On 21 April, Ignatieff met with a few Tamil leaders in Ottawa to discuss the humanitarian crisis. On the occasion, he said the following: > I am deeply concerned about escalating violence in Sri Lanka, and the > resulting deaths of thousands of civilians. It was important for me to hear > from Tamil Canadians, whose family and friends in Sri Lanka are suffering > first hand from this crisis. We cannot sit back and watch as thousands of > innocent lives are lost in the cross-fire, and we condemn any attempt to use > civilians as human shields. On 13 May in Washington, D.C., Barack Obama condemned the civil war in Sri Lanka and the army's continuous shelling of safe-zones and shelters. He also condemned the use of civilians as human shields by the LTTE. Obama insisted that the civil war, which became a humanitarian crisis, could result in a \\"full-blown catastrophe.\\" According to him, \\"the United States is ready to work towards ending the conflict.\\" On 9 June, Bob Rae was denied entry into Sri Lanka by Sri Lankan immigration officials at Bandaranaike International Airport in Colombo. Although reasons for rejection were generally found unclear, the Government of Sri Lanka cited Rae was \\"a threat to national security and sympathetic to the Tamil Tigers rebel group\\". On the issue, Rae stated: \\"Sri Lanka is afraid of dialogue, afraid of discussion, afraid of engagement. If this is how they treat me, imagine how they treat people who can't speak out.\\" Rae described Sri Lanka as \\"a very dangerous place to be a journalist\\" and that it is \\"a very dangerous place to be any kind of Tamil right now\\". The news sparked controversy for both Rae and Sri Lanka in Canada and made it to the headlines of newspapers in other countries. =Public reception and criticism= The protests have drawn criticism from some observers of the Sri Lankan Civil War. In an opinion piece titled \\"Misguided Tamil protesters\\" published by the National Post, Martin Collacott, a former High Commissioner of Canada to Sri Lanka, questioned the objectives of the protesters. In the editorial, he insisted that if the primary concern of the protesters was the safety of Tamil civilians, they would have asked the LTTE to free those trapped in the war zone instead of using them as human shields. However, by asking for a ceasefire, he said, the protesters want to \\"bring about a situation that would allow the Tigers to preserve their fighting capability and prolong the insurgency.\\" The article goes on to question why children who were born in Canada to native Sri Lankan parents were brought out to protests among others who were waving the flag of an organisation Canada has labelled a terrorist organization.

At one time it was a busy, flourishing, self- sustaining center of activity with numerous homes and places of business. Tulls Corner started originally from a crossroads store prior to the Revolutionary War and expanded gradually until it reached its height shortly after the end of the American Civil War. It is named after the Tull family, who evidently came to Somerset County circa 1666 from Northampton County, Virginia. Thomas Tull IV (1750-1818) created the settlement, which became known as Tulls Corner. He owned a grist mill and became an extensive farmer and ship owner. At that time, the settlement consisted of several homes, three or four stores, a post office, shoe shop, blacksmith shop, tannery, grist mill, and a nearby school and church. Later a saloon, millinery shop, barrel factory, tomato cannery and other businesses were added. After its heyday, it declined into obscurity.

The original building burned and the current building was erected in 1854. By 1855 the church had a congregation of 550 members, making it one of the most successful African American churches in Alabama. Following the Civil War, the congregation joined the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. The Methodist Episcopal Church South then challenged the right of the congregation to occupy the building. Under the leadership of their second minister, Wilbur G.

Early life and education De Raey was born in 1622 in the Dutch town of Wageningen as son to Jan Jansz van Ray and Hendersken van Lennep. In 1645 he married his cousin Cunera van Lennep. He died in Amsterdam on 30 November 1702. De Raey studied in Utrecht with Henricus Regius and from 1643 at the university of Leiden. He read philosophy with Prof. Adriaan Heereboord and on 16 July 1647 obtained his doctorate in medicine with Adolphus Vorstius. The previous day he had obtained the title of magister artium. Career From 1653 to 1668 De Raey was professor of philosophy in Leiden. He made such an excellent name for himself, that the Athenaeum Illustre in 1668 offered him a professorate in Amsterdam. His salary there was 3000 guilders per year, making him the best paid Amsterdam professor of his time. In Leiden De Raey lectured in medicine as well, and in Amsterdam in physics. As a medical doctor, he was very interested in anatomy. In Amsterdam he became a member of the informal society \\"Collegium privatum Amstelodamense\\", of which the members (among whom were Jan Swammerdam and Gerard Blasius) practised the comparative anatomical research of man and animal. Philosophy De Raey was a dedicated follower of Ren√© Descartes, whom he knew personally, and who called him the best teacher of his doctrines. Yet De Raey did not entirely discount Aristotle, but rather regarded Descartes as the one who completed Aristotle's ideas. Through his lectures and publications De Raey became one of the pioneers of the cartesian doctrine, influencing among others Leibniz. But since in those days Descartes's ideas were too radical for many, De Raey moderated them somewhat and stated that the writings of Descartes were not entirely opposed to aristotelian philosophy. De Raey felt that philosophy depended wholly on reason, and was detached from sensory perception and taught knowledge. Doubt was the foundation of true philosophy. According to De Raey philosophy had nothing to do with daily life and theology. The importance of De Raey for philosophy lies in the fact that he propagated Descartes's ideas, a.o. by smoothing the edges.

Before releasing Ace Trumps, Ace also released many Quartet games. These packs had 32 cards in each as opposed to Winning Moves' Top Trumps which usually had 30 cards. There was also Special Trump Cards versions of Ace Trumps. These were a yellow and red card. If the yellow card was the next card for a player, everyone must give the owner of that card their next card. If they get the red card, everyone has to give them the top card from their pile.http://www.ultimate-top- trumps.co.uk/ace_trumps.htm Gameplay Each pack of Ace Trumps is based on a theme, such as cars, aircraft, animals or boats. Unlike the modern Top Trumps, Ace Trumps didn't release any packs requiring a license, such as TV and Film shows. One exception though is a pack of Muppet Show Quartets. Each card in the pack shows a list of numerical data about the item. For example, in a pack based on cars, each card shows a different model of car, and the stats and data may include its engine size, its weight, its length, and its top speed. All the cards are dealt among the players. There must be at least two players, and at least one card for each player. The starting player (normally the player sitting on the dealer's left) selects a category from his or her topmost card and reads out its value. Each other player then reads out the value of the same category from their cards. The best (usually the largest) value wins the \\"trick\\", and the winner takes all the cards of the trick and places them at the bottom of his or her pile. That player then looks at their new topmost card, and chooses the category for the next round. Ace introduced the Super Trump, a card that beats all other cards except ‚ÄúA‚Äù cards regardless of its data. In the event of a draw, the cards are placed in the centre and a new category is chosen from the next card by the same person as in the previous round. The winner of that round obtains all of the cards in the centre as well as the top card from each player. The game ends when one player has won all of the card off the other players. Variations Many different variations of Ace have been released. These include: *Ace Quartet *Rummy *Top Ace *Ace Maxi Mini Quartets *Ace Fact Pack *NFL Fact Pack *Ace Trump Game *Power Trumps *Ace Maxi Mini Trumps *Ace Trumps *Ace Sporting Aces *Ace Supertrump http://www.ultimate-top-trumps.co.uk/ace_index.html Promotions Ace held some competitions, where cards were collected and then redeemed. They were: *In 1976 a competition to win a flight on Concorde (offer expired 31 January 1977) and/or an offer to receive a 60 X 80 cm colour poster of Concorde in exchange for 4 Credit Cards (10 points each, one per pack) and 18p to cover post and packing. *In 1977 a competition to see the 1977 Italian Grand Prix live in Monza (offer expired 1 August 1977) by answering 5 multiple choice questions and then design a space age Formula One race car on a sheet of paper no bigger than 25 X 20 cm and/or an offer to receive one of 3 80 X 60 cm posters (Great Formula One Cars, Great Formula One Drivers, Great Formula One Races) in exchange for 4 Credit Cards (10 points each, one per pack) and 18p to cover post and packing. *In 1978 an offer to receive 1 of 8 60 X 80 cm posters (Concorde, Great Formula One Cars, Great Formula One Drivers, Great Formula One Races, Famous Tanks, Famous Warships of World War II, Famous Planes of World War II and Famous British Steam Locomotives).

The Tribune was a member of the New York Press Association. From 1989 to 2002, the paper was owned by News Communications, parent of The Hill. Ackerman then repurchased the paper. The paper's main offices moved to Whitestone from Fresh Meadows, Queens in November 2010. The paper was sold to Phoenix Media in 2013. The Tribune is published in nine different sections, eight specific to different neighborhoods or regions of the borough, which are mostly the same except for the \\"This Week\\" section that includes one or two stories from that specific neighborhoods. The eight different sections are Astoria, Jackson Heights, Western Queens, South Queens, Forest Hills, Flushing, Bayside, and East Queens. The ninth edition is a \\"Queens Edition\\" which does not have any specific \\"This Week\\" page and is given out to subscribers. Every month, the newspaper issues a special edition, called \\"glossy\\" issues, that focuses on a given topic. Recurring examples include the \\"Blue Book\\", or the annual Guide to Queens every January, Best of Queens, Arts & Culture, Gay Pride, and Community Characters editions. The Tribune is also home to a newspaper called The PRESS of Southeast Queens, a separate paper that covers Jamaica, Queens and other Southeast Queens neighborhoods like Rosedale, Saint Albans, Hollis, Springfield Gardens, Cambria Heights, Queens Village, Addisleigh Park and Laurelton. The PRESS occasionally runs the same stories as the Tribune and vice versa. In 2018, the paper was sold to Ocean Gold Media and moved its headquarters from Whitestone to Long Island City. The format changed from a tabloid to a broadsheet and it ceased to publish separate local \\"This Week\\" editions. Ocean Gold also stopped the publication of The Press of Southeast Queens, as they relaunched The Press  a new city-wide magazine focused on people of color and immigrant communities. On December 17, 2018, much of the staff of the Tribune was laid off and Ocean Gold announced the paper would discontinue publishing while seeking new financial backing. Ocean Gold told other reporters that they were seeking buyers for the cash-strapped paper. Ocean Gold took over \\"a million dollars in debt\\" when it purchased the Tribune earlier in the year, and consolidated much of the debt during their ownership.

The second series premiered in the United Kingdom and New Zealand on 17 January 2011 and the final episode aired on 7 February 2011. Production In March 2008, the BBC announced a new 13-part drama series set in New Zealand. The series was filmed in Rarotonga, Cook Islands in mid-2008 and was directed by Danny Mulheron. The BBC announced in May 2010 that they were currently filming the second series.http://gibson.co.nz/our-projects/show/282 The character Chloe, played by Amelia Reynolds was written out in the first episode of the second series and a new character, Natasha played by Georgia Fabbish was subsequently introduced. Georgia Fabish had previously played a minor character in the first series. The second series started airing on 17 January 2011 in the United Kingdom and in New Zealand.http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00xn7bv Plot In the ancient times, on Paradise Island, an ancient hero named the Sea Born imprisoned an evil sea ghost called Ragnar in an underwater coral prison along with many other sea ghosts. Ragnar swore revenge against the Sea Born. The sea ghosts are at the core of the story, and appear in almost every episode. They can be from any country, or period of history, but are the ghosts of people that have died at sea (or near to it, such as an aviator whose plane crashed on the island). They can be invisible, appear as human, or be in their \\"true sea ghost form\\" with grey skin covered in black blotches, wearing black and white ragged versions of their human clothes. If seen through water their sea ghost form is revealed. This usually happens when they are seen from behind the fish tank in the Paradise Cafe. Any item, such as money or clothes, given away by a sea ghost will turn into sand after a short time away from the ghost. Centuries later, Megan and Robbo move to Paradise Island along with their father to open up a caf√© there. Robbo quickly befriends Tai, a kind but very clumsy character whilst Megan eventually gets along with a spoilt, rich girl named Abi. A strange girl named Chloe is eager to get to know everyone on the island and it later discovered by the audience that she is a sea ghost spy working for Ragnar. The five kids discover that either Robbo, Tai or Megan is the reincarnation of the Sea Born and Ragnar is looking for them since he needs the Sea Born to escape from the coral prison. Eventually Megan finds out that Chloe is a sea ghost and this infuriates Chloe so she attempts to kill Megan. However, Megan promises not to tell the others (Megan still does not know that she is a spy) and they become best friends making Abi jealous. When Robbo is kidnapped by Ragnar, Chloe is forced to tell everyone that she has been spying for Ragnar all this time. The gang lose all trust in her and it soon transpires that Tai is the reincarnation of the Sea Born. The gang along with Chloe defeat Ragnar. In the second series, there is no longer any threat to the inhabitants of the caf√©. Although in the series 1 finale Ragnar said he would return, at the start of series 2 it was announced that he had gone. Each episode follows the same pattern: a sea ghost with a problem appears in the caf√©, the kids help him or her, there are some comedic complications, and the ghost returns to the sea. New character Natasha is mistaken for a sea ghost in the first episode of series two, due to her awkward behaviour and unfashionable clothes, so each of the children in turn contrive to \\"accidentally\\" throw water at her. Cast and characters * Holly Bodimeade as Megan (series 1‚Äì2, 26 episodes) ‚Äì Megan is the younger sister to Robbo and most kind and considerate of the group. She is most concerned about the welfare of the caf√© and often runs it on her own. She often enjoys tidying things up and unlike her friend Abi, she is not really into fashion. She was thought to be the Sea Born until it was revealed to be Tai. She later becomes Chloe's best friend halfway through series one and is the first to find out that she was a sea ghost. During series two, Megan is the most affected when Chloe leaves but later becomes more laid-back after she promises Chloe that she would enjoy herself more. * Pax Baldwin as Robbo (series 1‚Äì2, 26 episodes) ‚Äì Robbo is Megan's older brother, he always tries to squeeze his way out of trouble, but eventually reforms and becomes more thoughtful towards his hard working sister Megan.

Near the end of series one, Robbo becomes selfish and big headed and is eventually kidnapped by Ragnar but is saved by Tai after he was revealed to be the Sea Born. Robbo is more considerate and kind throughout series two and he now takes care of the caf√© instead of sister along with Tai. In series 2 he seems to have a stronger relationship with Abi. * Halaifonua Finau as Tai (series 1‚Äì2, 26 episodes) ‚Äì Tai has lived on the island all his life and lives with his grandmother, who believes in all kinds of stories and superstitions about sea ghosts. Tai is very gullible and can be easily led at times but is also to be very strong-willed especially when his friends are in need of help. He is best friends with Robbo. Tai is revealed to be the Sea Born and eventually seals Ragnar away at the end of series one. Tai somehow loses his powers at the start of series two but unknowingly regains them after the seal holding the sea ghosts breaks again. * Lara Custance as Abi (series 1‚Äì2, 26 episodes) ‚Äì Abi has a flair for fashion, always on some sort of shopping spree, money comes easy to this chick. She lives in her mother's hotel on the island. Abi can sometimes be selfish and unkind, but she has a good heart. At first, she disliked Megan for the way she dressed however she learned from her mistakes and they later became good friends. Throughout series one she seemed to have a one sided rivalry between Chloe and was the first to believe her as a traitor. During series two, Abi is not as spoilt as she was in the first series after the hotel loses most of its guests due to the pollution. In series 2 she seems to have a stronger relationship with Robbo. *Amelia Reynolds as Chloe (series 1‚Äì2, 15 episodes) ‚Äì Chloe is a 1950s babe, she is introduced as a quirky but fun character eager to make friends on the island. Her fashion style is true 1950s as is her personality and it is not until later in the series that Chloe is revealed to be a sea ghost who is working for Ragnar to find the Sea Born and kill him or her. Megan is first to find out her secret but they later become best friends. At the end of the first series Chloe betrays Ragnar and reunites with the gang. At the start of series two, she reverts to her sea ghost form and it forced to leave the island. Before leaving, she made Megan promise that she enjoy herself a lot more. *Georgia Fabish as Natasha (series 2, 13 episodes) ‚Äì Natasha is introduced in series two as Peter's assistant and an amateur reporter searching for a story. She appears to be quite clumsy and often luck is not on her side but she is also quite friendly. She knows that the rest of the gang are hiding a secret from her and she is determined to find out. At the start of series two, Natasha, whilst exploring accidentally breaks the seal holding all the sea ghosts and causes all the pollution to return to the island.

His most prestigious victories include Elitloppet (1994, 1995), Oslo Grand Prix (1994, 1995), Finlandia-Ajo (1994) and Olympiatravet (1995, 1996). At the end of his career, the stallion had earned US$2,416,093.Copiad won 15,861,650 Swedish Kronor (SEK). In the conversion to USD, the rates of 1996-07-23, the date of Copiad's last race, have been used. The trainer and driver (in all but one race) during Copiad's racing career was Swedish Erik Bergl√∂f. Background Copiad was sired by Texas (1974-2005), an American stallion by Triple Crown winner Super Bowl and out of Elitloppet champion Elma. As a colt, Texas competed with great results in USA. He won Kentucky Futurity and finished second in Hambletonian. Texas started his breeding career in USA, where he sired top racers Grades Singing (1982-2007, winner of Breeders Crown, Maple Leaf Trotting, Gran Premio della Lotteria, Gran Premio delle Nazioni and Olympiatravet), Southern Newton (b. 1985, winner of Yonkers Trot) and Nordin Hanover (b. 1985, winner of Preis der Besten and Oslo Grand Prix). 1982 was the year with the largest quantity of born foals by Texas in USA, 102. The amount decreased the following years, and later in the 1980s, Texas was brought to Sweden. In 1989, his first sizeable Swedish crop was born. Among its members were future superstar Copiad and top trotter Bolets Igor (winner of Preis der Besten, Copenhagen Cup and Jubileumspokalen). None of the later Swedish trotters sired by Texas would be able to match the success of these two stallions. In 1994, Texas was appointed Swedish Elite Stallion. The dam of Copiad, Swedish mare Bibbi Girl (b. 1978), was awarded Swedish Elite Mare title in 1995. The second most successful among her offspring is Eko Succe (b. 1988), a gelding that earned SEK372,630, to be compared with Copiad's SEK15,861,650.  Career as a racing horse =1992-1993 - 3 and 4 years old= Copiad entered his first race in September 1992, at age 3. The debut ended in a disqualification, but he won five out of seven following races that year. As a 4-year-old, he competed in a number of big events. He finished fifth in Konung Gustaf V:s Pokal and second in Sprinterm√§staren, before he claimed Italian Gran Premio Unire Consiglio and Swedish Breeders Crown (despite going off-stride) in the fall of 1993. =1994 - 5 years old= When Copiad started 1994 by adding seven to the five consecutive wins ending the 1993 campaign, he reached the longest winning streak of his career, 12 wins in a row. Among the wins in the spring of 1994 was Sweden's biggest event Elitloppet at Solvalla, as well as Finnish major race Finlandia-Ajo and Norway's Oslo Grand Prix. In Elitloppet on 29 May, Copiad faced first and foremost American star Pine Chip, winner of previous year's Kentucky Futurity, World Trotting Derby and Breeders Crown, as well as runner-up in Hambletonian. The two stallions won their elimination heats. In the final, Copiad grabbed the lead and favourite Pine Chip was parked outside. Together, they opened up a large gap to the pack before the stretch. When Pine Chip broke stride just before the finish line, Copiad had already beaten his opponent. Elitloppet 1994 is considered a huge moment in Swedish trotting history. Copiad claimed Momarken Grand Prix, √Örj√§ngs Stora Sprinterlopp and Gran Premio Vittorio Di Capua during the rest of the year. =1995 - 6 years old= In April 1995, Copiad won Olympiatravet at √Öby and Forus Open in Norway, before repeating the previous year's victories in Oslo Grand Prix and Elitloppet. Copiad won Preis der Besten and finished runner-up in big races like Elite-Rennen, √Öby Stora Pris and Gran Premio delle Nazione. =1996 - 7 years old= In the campaign of 1996, Olympiatravet was once more the first major target. Copiad defended the title, but that was to be the last big win in his career. In Finlandia- Ajo, the stallion was disqualified, and in Elitloppet, the two-time champion failed to reach the final after going off-stride in the elimination race. After winning a small race in early July, Copiad galloped in √Örj√§ngs Stora Sprinterlopp. On 23 July, in Hugo √Öbergs Memorial, Copiad was parked outside leader Triple T. Storm by driver Bergl√∂f. The two trotters kept a staggering pace and Copiad gave up before the stretch. Copiad was later confirmed to be unwell, and his connections decided to end the racing career.  Career as a breeding stallion  After Copiad had quit racing, he started a new career as a breeding stallion at Aleb√§cks stuteri. During the first four years, he sired in average more than 100 foals per year. In 2002, he became father of only 39 foals and the following year meant an ever-smaller amount of foals. In late 2003, Copiad lost the permission to cover brooding mares in Sweden. As a consequence, Copiad moved abroad, and has since 2004 been acting as a stud horse in both Hungary and Germany. In September 2009, it was reported that Copiad had retired from his career as a breeding stallion. As a consequence, he was moved from Germany to breeder Trygve Kraft in V√§rmland, Sweden. When Copiad lost the covering permission in 2003, it was due to a lack of successful offspring. The richest of his offspring are geldings Lukas Lupin (winner of ‚âàUS$450,000In the conversion to USD, the rates of 2009-03-11 have been used) and Even Who (5th in the Swedish Trotting Derby) together with stallions The Big Blue World and Sun Protection.

Its original enrollment was seven students. As part of the curriculum each student was required to work two hours per day at a manual task. It was thought that this manual labor was beneficial to the student. While at some schools students engaged in mechanical tasks, the Academy was not able to build shops or buy the tools necessary. The students, therefore, engaged in farming. Some time around 1832, through an act of the legislature, the academy became Jackson College. During this time, the manual labor aspect of the academy was maintained. In 1837 the College moved to Columbia. At this point, the manual labor aspect of the curriculum that began with the original academy was abolished. During the American Civil War the college was burned, along with much of Columbia, by the Union Army. It is likely that it was at this time that the college ceased to exist, but the references available are not clear.

This includes using a medium which involves text messaging over a mobile device and can be done from a mobile phone or in bulk using an SMS Aggregator and distributor online. Some businesses provide the entire service including creating the messages and sending them via an aggregator on behalf of a business. Today, direct text marketing has been subsumed under mobile marketing, which includes rich media embedded into the marketing messages as well as those messages sent via mobile applications besides SMS.  Advantages  Companies and businesses can benefit from using this form of modern marketing by sending either promotional content, reminders, event announcements, discount coupons or any other informational content via text format directly to individuals via their personal mobile phones or PDAs, which is beneficial because of the relatively low cost entailed. Some observers have commented that it allows companies to reduce their impact on the environment because they are no longer using paper for their direct mails. The fundamental value is that the target audience is often compelled to open the text messages that arrive in their inbox. In a study in the United Kingdom, 81 percent opened and read text messages sent for the purpose of direct marketing. There are numerous possibilities for direct text marketing, including customer services, alerts, CRM, communication via a two-way direct response mechanism, brand bonding, and event ticketing.  Disadvantages  Mobile phones and PDAs are personal technologies, but \\"57% of adults with cell phones have received unwanted or spam text messages on their phones\\". Services of sending promotional or coupon discounts are usually an opt-in service, which means a business cannot send any content to an individual's mobile device unless requested by the owner of the mobile device. Nevertheless, interference is still considered as a disadvantage, particularly with respect to the impact of timeliness, relevance, and appropriateness of the messages in addition to information overload.Information Resources Management Association, p. 10.

Pinƒçiukas and Baltaragis conclude a pact: the devil will help the miller in his work and will get him a spectacular wife, Marcelƒó (Vaiva Mainelytƒó).

The daughter, Jurga (played by the same actress interpreting her mother, Vaiva Mainelytƒó), grows up to become a beautiful woman, and the handsome Girdvainis (Regimantas Adomaitis) falls in love with her. Pinƒçiukas plays all sort of tricks to separate Jurga from Girdvainis, while Baltaragis regrets his pact with the devil and tries to persuade him to marry instead his not-so-beautiful sister Ur≈°ulƒó (Regina Varnaitƒó). In the end, the whole village realizes Pinƒçiukas is a devil and tries to kill him by drowning him in a nearby river, but he is saved by Ur≈°ulƒó, who is secretly in love with him.

A single-seat, single-engined biplane, the B.1 was built by the Sopwith Aviation Company for the Royal Navy. Although only two were built, one was used for bombing raids over France. Development and design In late 1916, Sopwith, whose earlier 1¬Ω Strutter had proved successful as a light bomber (particularly when operated as a single seater), designed a new, single-engined bomber aircraft. The new bomber was developed in parallel with the Cuckoo carrier-based torpedo bomber and closely resembled the Cuckoo. It, like the Cuckoo, was a compact tractor biplane, powered by a 200 hp (149 kW) Hispano-Suiza water-cooled engine. Unlike the Cuckoo, the bomber's two-bay wings did not fold. It was designed as a single-seat aircraft, with the pilot sitting in a cockpit under the wing centre section to give a good view forwards and downwards for bombing. The aircraft bombload of up to 560 lb (255 kg) was carried vertically within the fuselage, in cells behind the pilot.Bruce 1957, pp. 593‚Äì596.Mason 1994, pp. 80‚Äì81. While no orders followed from either the Admiralty, whose needs for a single-engined bomber had been met by the Airco DH.4 or the Royal Flying Corps, Sopwith obtained a license to build a prototype of the new bomber, designated Sopwith B.1 as a private venture, probably hoping for orders from the French A√©ronautique Militaire.Bruce (2001), p. 1. This prototype first flew in early April 1917, being tested officially later that month, where it demonstrated good performance, but was tail heavy when carrying a bomb load and nose heavy without, and was tiring to fly. It was sent to France following these tests, in the mistaken belief that the French wanted to test the aircraft. Once in France, the unwanted B.1 was acquired by the British Royal Naval Air Service, given the serial number N.50 and issued to 5 Squadron, RNAS, on 16 May 1917 for operational evaluation.Bruce 2001, p. 4. Fitted with a single forward- firing Lewis gun, the B.1 was flown on a number of bombing raids against targets in German-occupied Belgium. While its performance was praised, it was again noted that the B.1 was tiring to fly, and that the lack of manoeuvrability or any useful defensive armament meant that it was vulnerable to hostile fighters.Bruce 2001, pp. 5‚Äì6. The prototype B.1 was sent to the Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot on the Isle of Grain in autumn 1917 for reconstruction as a two-seat carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft with folding wings. The initial attempts at modifying the aircraft were not successful, but the B.1 formed the basis of the Port Victoria Grain Griffin, a major redesign of the B.1 with new wings and a wider fuselage.

The school's main claim to fame lies in being the alma mater of former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Harold Wilson, who was a member of the sixth form from 1932 to 1934 and was the school's first Head Boy.  History  On 23 March 1925, Cheshire County Council passed a resolution to build a new secondary school in Bebington. Designed by the County architect, F Anstead Browne, the new school was opened by the Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire, Brigadier-General Sir William Bromley-Davenport on 26 September 1931. The school was administered by Cheshire County Council until the council was dissolved in 1974; since then it has been administered by Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council, which maintains use of the 11+ for senior school admission. In 2008 the borough council resolved to replace mobile classrooms with a brick building for the mathematics department, business studies facilities, some history and geography rooms, an extra Modern Foreign Languages room, additional science laboratories, a new music centre and several ICT suites. There is now an exterior science area (including a greenhouse), and refurbishment of the main building included two sixth form history and politics classrooms. An entrance atrium, where exhibitions of pupils' work are held, is part of the new development.http://www.wirralgrammarboys.com/uploads/docs/1433508713-School%20Map%20(Map)%20June%2015.png The school was designated as a Business and Enterprise School in 2006 and became a Business and Enterprise College in 2008. This provided a grant for development of ICT facilities and for the business studies department to benefit both pupils and the wider community, including summer classes in ICT, photography and basic business skills. ICT suites and business studies classrooms were also developed in the new building. Although special funding for such colleges ended in 2010, the schools has chosen to retain its focus on business and enterprise. In 2008 a school radio station was established, called Livewire Radio, broadcasting daily at lunchtimes. Students and teachers host the shows, featuring various musical genres and discussions regarding issues relevant to pupils. Over the course of summer 2013, further development included a new multi-purpose activity hall, refurbished conference hall, new cookery classrooms and refurbished changing rooms. During the summer of 2012, an outdoor classroom was built as part of the art department on land previously occupied by music rooms. The landscaped area is used by the department for observational work and the displaying of 3-d pieces. It came into use in September 2012.  Curriculum  Lunch Break on the playing fields Subjects taught include the core subjects of English, mathematics, chemistry, biology and physics, plus French, history, geography, DT, art, music, IT, RS, Spanish and P.E. Previously Latin, Greek and Russian were options. At the beginning of the school's life, French was taught along with Latin. Pupils were later given a choice between French and German. Greek was provided for pupils who showed strength in languages. GCSE and/or 'A'-Level courses include business studies, economics, computer science, law, politics, psychology and general studies.  Extracurricular activities = Sport = The school has been commended for its sporting commitment, with particular efforts in Rugby union, with a tradition of the sport at the school. School rugby teams often tour, including to Australia and the United States. The most notable achiever in recent years is the rugby player Matt Cairns of Saracens & England. Other sports promoted in the school include association football, athletics, badminton, basketball, cross country running, handball and volleyball. Other outdoor activities (developed at the school's outdoor centres on Anglesey and near Mold) include abseiling, caving, climbing, raft building and various high level rope activities. = Drama and music = View of Wirral Grammar School for Boys The school's drama society has produced a number of plays and musicals jointly with the neighbouring Wirral Grammar School for Girls. The music society provides tours for the concert band and the choir, having performed in the Black Forest, Canada, Italy, Spain, Austria and France, including performances in both the South of France and Paris. Prior to the music tours, the two ensembles occasionally perform at local venues in order to raise funds for the tours. The choir, concert band and orchestra, in addition to several smaller musical groups, perform three concerts a year held in the school hall, as well as a carol service in the nearby St Andrew's Church, Bebington, at Christmas.

He is best known for being the father of Anne Hutchinson, considered the most famous English woman in colonial America, and Katherine Marbury Scott, the first known woman to convert to Quakerism in the United States. Born in 1555, Marbury was the son of William Marbury, a lawyer from Lincolnshire, and Agnes Lenton. Young Marbury attended Christ's College, Cambridge, but is not known to have graduated, though he was ordained as a deacon in the Church of England in January 1578. He was given a ministry position in Northampton and almost immediately came into conflict with the bishop. Taking a position commonly used by Puritans, he criticised the church leadership for staffing the parish churches with poorly trained clergy and for tolerating poorly trained bishops. After serving two short jail terms, he was ordered not to return to Northampton, but disregarded the mandate and was subsequently brought before the Bishop of London, John Aylmer, for trial in November 1578. During the examination, Aylmer called Marbury an ass, an idiot and a fool, and sentenced him to Marshalsea prison for his impudence. After two years in prison Marbury was considered sufficiently reformed to preach again and was sent to Alford in Lincolnshire, close to his ancestral home. Here he married and began a family, but again felt emboldened to speak out against the church leadership and was put under house arrest. Following a time without employment, he became desperate, writing letters to prominent officials, and was eventually allowed to resume preaching. Making good on his promise to curb his tongue, he preached uneventfully in Alford and with a growing prominence was rewarded with a position in London in 1605. He was given a second parish in 1608, which was exchanged for another closer to home a year later. He died unexpectedly in 1611 at the age of 55. With two wives Marbury had 18 children, three of whom matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, and one of whom, Anne, became a puritan dissident in the Massachusetts Bay Colony who had a leading role in the colony's Antinomian Controversy.  Early life  Francis Marbury, born in London and baptised on 27 October 1555, was one of six children of William Marbury (1524‚Äì1581), and the youngest of three sons. His father, who possibly attended Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1544, was a lawyer in Lincolnshire, a member of the Middle Temple, where he was admitted \\"specially ... at the instance of Mr. Francis Barnades\\" in May 1551, and still active until 1573; he was elected Member of Parliament for Newport Iuxta Launceston in 1572. His mother was Agnes, the daughter of John Lenton of Old Wynkill, Staffordshire according to historian John Champlin, but genealogist Meredith Colket suggests that Lenton was from Aldwinkle in Northamptonshire, which is much closer to where the Marburys lived. Marbury was likely educated in London, perhaps at St Paul's School, and he became well grounded in Latin as well as learning some Greek. Though he was born and raised in London, his family maintained close ties with Lincolnshire. His older brother, Edward, was knighted there in 1603, and died in 1605 as the High Sheriff of Lincolnshire. Marbury matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge in 1571, but is not known to have graduated. He was ordained deacon by Edmund Scambler, Bishop of Peterborough, on 7 January 1578. Though he was young when he became a deacon, he was not ordained as priest until 1605. While Marbury was of the Church of England, he had decidedly Puritan views. Not all English subjects thought that Queen Elizabeth had gone far enough to cleanse the English Church of Catholic rites and governance, or to ensure that its ministers were capable of saving souls through powerful preaching. The most vocal of these critics were the Puritans, and Marbury was among the most radical of the non-conforming Puritans, the Presbyterians. These more extreme non-conformists wanted to \\"abolish all the pomp and ceremony of the Church of England and remodel its government according to what they thought was the Bible's simple, consensual pattern.\\" To do this, they would eliminate bishops appointed by the monarchs, and introduce sincere Christians to choose the church's elders (or governors). The church leadership would then consist of two ministers, one a teacher in charge of doctrine, and the other a pastor in charge of people's souls, and also include a ruling lay leader.  1578 trial  Marshalsea Prison where Marbury spent two years for heresy As a young man Marbury was considered to be a \\"hothead\\" and felt strongly that the clergy should be well educated, and clashed with his superiors on this issue. He spent time preaching at Northampton, but soon came into conflict with the bishop's chancellor, Dr James Ellis, who was on a mission to suppress any nonconforming clergy. After two short imprisonments, Marbury was directed to leave Northampton and not return. He disregarded this order, and was then brought to trial in the consistory court of St Paul's in London before the high commission on 5 November 1578. Here he was examined by the Bishop of London, John Aylmer, and by Sir Owen Hopton, Dr Lewis, and Archdeacon John Mullins. Marbury made a transcript of this trial from memory and used it to educate and amuse his children, he being the hero, and the Bishop being portrayed as somewhat of a buffoon, and the transcript can be found in Benjamin Brook's study of notable Puritans. Historian Lennam finds nothing in this transcript that is either \\"improbable or inconsistent with the Bishop's testy reputation.\\" In the trial, Aylmer began the accusations of Marbury, saying \\"you had rattled the Bishop of Peterborough,\\" to which Marbury accused the bishop of placing poorly trained ministers in the parish churches, adding that the bishops were poorly supervised. Aylmer then retorted, \\"The Bishop of Peterborough was never more overseen in his life than when he admitted thee to be a preacher in Northampton.\\" Marbury warned that for every soul damned by the lack of adequate preaching, the guilt \\"is on the bishops' hands.\\" To this Aylmer replied, \\"Thou takest upon thee to be a preacher, but there is nothing in thee. Thou art a very ass, an idiot, and a fool.\\" As the examination continued, Aylmer considered the ability of the Church of England to put trained ministers in every parish. He barked, \\"This fellow would have a preacher in every parish church!\\" to which Marbury replied, \\"so would St. Paul.\\" Then Aylmer asked, \\"But where is the living for them?\\" To this Marbury answered, \\"A man might cut a large thong out of your hide, and that of the other prelates, and it would never be missed.\\" Having lost his patience, the bishop retorted, \\"Thou are an overthwart, proud, puritan knave.\\" Marbury answered, \\"I am no puritan. I beseech you to be good to me. I have been twice in prison already, but I know not why. To this, Aylmer was unsympathetic, and he rendered the sentence, \\"Have him to the Marshalsea. There he shall cope with the papists.\\" Marbury then threatened divine retribution upon the bishop by warning him to beware the judgements of God. His daughter Anne Hutchinson would make a similar threat towards the magistrates and ministers at her civil trial before the Massachusetts Court, nearly 60 years later.  Later life  For his conviction of heresy, Marbury spent two years in Marshalsea Prison, on the south side of the River Thames, across from London. In 1580, at the age of 25, he was released and was considered sufficiently reformed to preach and teach, and moved to the market town of Alford in Lincolnshire, about north of London, near his ancestral home. He was soon appointed curate (deputy vicar) of St Wilfrid's Church, Alford. His father died in 1581, leaving Marbury with some welcome income as well as \\"lawe bookes and a ring of gold.\\" Sometime about 1582 he married his first wife, Elizabeth Moore, and in 1585 he became the schoolmaster at Alford Grammar School, free to the poor and founded under Queen Elizabeth. Marbury is thought to have been the teacher or tutor of young John Smith, who became an early explorer and leader in the Jamestown Colony in Virginia. After bearing three daughters, Marbury's first wife died about 1586, and within a year of her death he married Bridget Dryden, about ten years younger than he, from a prominent Northamptonshire family. Bridget was born in the Canons Ashby House in Northamptonshire, the daughter of John Dryden and Elizabeth Cope. Her brother, Erasmus Dryden, was the grandfather of the playwright and Poet Laureate John Dryden. Canons Ashby House, Northamptonshire, birthplace of Marbury's wife, Bridget In 1590 Marbury once again felt emboldened to speak out against his superiors, denouncing the Church of England for selecting poorly educated bishops and poorly trained ministers. The Bishop of Lincoln, calling him an \\"impudent Puritan,\\" removed him from preaching and teaching, and put him under house arrest. On 15 October 1590 Marbury wrote a letter to the statesman William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, who was the uncle of Marbury's acquaintance, Francis Bacon. In the letter he explained his religious creed and claimed that he was deprived of his preaching licence \\"for causes unknown to him.\\" Without employment, he tended his gardens and tutored his children, reading to them from his own writings, the Bible, and John Foxe's Book of Martyrs. Somehow the family was able to survive, perhaps from borrowing from the Drydens. While this suspension from preaching was thought to be short by historian Lennam, his daughter's biographer, Eve LaPlante, wrote that it lasted nearly four years. Whichever the case, by 1594 he was once again preaching, and from this point forward, Marbury resolved to curb his tongue and not openly question those in positions of authority. Following this final suspension, both his fame and fortune rose, and at one point Marbury became lecturer at St Saviour, Southwark. In 1602 he was given the honour of delivering the \\"Spittle sermon\\" in London on Easter Tuesday, and again at St Paul's Cross in London in June. The following year he had the distinction of delivering a special sermon on the accession of James I to the throne, and at this point several of his sermons were finding their way into print. With the support of Richard Vaughan, the Bishop of London, he was moved to London in 1605, finding a residence in the heart of the city where he was given the position of vicar of St Martin Vintry. Here his Puritan views, though somewhat muffled, were nevertheless present and tolerated, since there was a shortage of pastors. London was a vibrant and cosmopolitan city, and active playwrights of the time were William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, and Ben Jonson, whose plays were performed just across the river. The Marburys managed to avoid the bubonic plague that occasionally worked its way through the city. Marbury took on additional work in 1608, preaching in the parish of St Pancras, Soper Lane, travelling there by horse twice a week. In 1610 he was able to replace that position with one much closer to home, and became rector of St Margaret, New Fish Street, a short walk from St Martin Vintry. Marbury died unexpectedly in February 1611, at the age of 55. He had written his will in January 1611, and its brevity suggests that it was written in a hurry following a sudden and serious illness. The will mentions his wife by name and 12 living children, but only his daughter Susan, from his first marriage, is mentioned by name. His widow resided for a time at St Peter, Paul's Wharf, London, but about December 1620 she married Reverend Thomas Newman of Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, and died in 1645.  Works and legacy  Marbury's most noted work, The Contract of Marriage between Wit and Wisdom was written in 1579 while he was in prison. It was a moral interlude or \\"wit play\\", following The Play of Wit and Science by John Redford, and an adaptation of its sequel The Marriage of Wit and Science. The play was noted in 1590 as one of the \\"current plays of the time.\\" Author T. N. S. Lennam described the work as a \\"lusty, occasionally very coarse, short interlude in which the morality material is dominated by rather imitative farcical episodes more elementally entertaining than didactic.\\" Marbury also helped write the preface to the works of other religious writers. One of these prefaces was written for Robert Rollock's A Treatise on God's Effectual Calling (1603), and another was for Richard Rogers' seminal work, Seven Treatises (1604). In the latter, Marbury praised Rogers \\"for having delivered a crushing blow against the Catholics and thereby vindicating the Church of England.\\" This prefatory material summed up the puritan unitary vision for England: \\"one godly ruler, one godly church, and one godly path to heaven, with puritan ministers writing the guidebooks.\\" While Marbury was not considered one of the great Puritan ministers of his day, he was nevertheless well known. Sir Francis Bacon called him \\"The Preacher,\\" and recognised him as such in his 1624 work Apothegm. A leading minister of the time, Reverend Robert Bolton, expressed a considerable respect for Marbury's teachings. One negative aspect of Marbury's later career involved his time in Alford when he was the governor of the free grammar school there between 1595 and 1605. A 1618 court case pointed to Marbury's improper handling of the school's endowments, and following an inquisition, the surviving executors to Marbury's will were ordered to pay \\"certain sums unto the Governors\\" of the school as compensation. Family Marbury's daughter Anne Hutchinson figured prominently in New England's Antinomian Controversy. Marbury was said to have 20 children, but only 18 have been identified, three with his first wife, Elizabeth Moore, and 15 with his second wife, Bridget Dryden. The three children from his first marriage were all girls, Mary (c. 1584‚Äì1585), Susan (baptised 12 September 1585; married a Mr Twyford) and Elizabeth (c. 1587‚Äì1601). His children with Bridget Dryden were Mary (born c. 1588), John (baptised 15 February 1589/90), Anne (baptised 20 July 1591), Bridget (baptised 8 May 1593; buried 15 October 1598), Francis (baptised 20 October 1594), Emme (baptised 21 December 1595), Erasmus (baptised 15 February 1596/7), Anthony (baptised 11 September 1598; buried 9 April 1601), Bridget (baptised 25 November 1599), Jeremuth (or Jeremoth, baptised 31 March 1601), Daniel (baptised 14 September 1602), Elizabeth (baptised 20 January 1604/5), Thomas (born c. 1606?), Anthony (born c. 1608), and Katherine (born c. 1610). Three of Marbury's sons, Erasmus, Jeremuth, and the second Anthony, all matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford. His daughter Anne married William Hutchinson and sailed to New England in 1634, becoming a dissident Puritan minister at the centre of the Antinomian Controversy, and was, according to historian Michael Winship, \\"the most famous, or infamous, English woman in colonial American history.\\" His only other child to emigrate was his youngest child, Katherine, who married Richard Scott and settled in Providence in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Katherine and her husband were at times Puritans, Baptists, and Quakers, and Katherine was whipped in Boston for confronting Governor John Endecott over his persecution of Quakers and supporting her future son-in-law Christopher Holder who had his right ear cut off for his Quaker evangelism. Marbury's sister, Catherine, married in 1583 Christopher Wentworth, and they became grandparents of William Wentworth who followed Reverend John Wheelwright to New England, and eventually settled in Dover, New Hampshire, becoming the ancestor of many men of prominence. = Ancestry = In 1914, John Champlin published the bulk of the currently known ancestry of Francis Marbury.

The axle system comprises a combination of fixed axles and axles that can slide transversely, all within a single, rigid locomotive frame. The system was invented by a young Austrian locomotive builder, Karl G√∂lsdorf, around the end of the 19th century. The first locomotive to use this principle entered service in 1897. Overview In the early days of the railway, locomotives were built with more and more axles in order the meet the increasingly heavy loads of goods trains. In order not to overstress the tracks, axle loads were often restricted, initially to 16 tonnes, occasionally to 18 tonnes and later usually to 20 tonnes. A ten- coupled locomotive had to weigh no more than 100 tonnes plus whatever tonnage the leading and trailing wheels could support. The heavier a locomotive is, the more surface pressure it places on the wheels and the more it can haul. But as more and more axles are added, curve running becomes increasingly difficult. So early on, work began to develop multi-part frames and bogies which linked sets of axles to their own drive. However driving wheels within bogies using steam was a difficult task due to the moving seals that were required. As a result, a different avenue of development was pursued, whereby a degree of smooth curve running could be achieved using a long, rigid frame through the use, for example, of axles that had sufficient sideways play. The G√∂lsdorf axle system avoided the need for complicated construction methods like that of Mallet locomotives. It was in effect an artifice enabling locomotives to retain a long, rigid frame (without articulation or bogies), yet whose individual axles could be better aligned when curve running. It has been alleged that the Goelsdorf system was developed by the Henschel company to avoid the patents and royalties of the LMA system.Narrow Gauge Down Under October 2008, p44 (Issue 31) Operation G√∂lsdorf axles work in this way. Two of the five axles cannot move sideways relative to the frame because their axle boxes fix them rigidly to the frame. The other axles, however, are fitted into their bearings and attached to their drives in such a way that they can be moved sideways during curve running, depending on the sideways forces acting on them. In addition the connecting and coupling rods, through which the steam pressure and linear forces from the steam pistons are translated into the rotation of the wheels via the crank pins, also have to be able to move sideways. Use The G√∂lsdorf system was a standard for decades in the construction of, usually ten-coupled, occasionally twelve-coupled goods train locomotives. One of the first companies in Germany to introduce G√∂lsdorf axles was the privately run Westphalian State Railway (Westf√§lische Landeseisenbahn), whose heavy goods trains between Belecke and Erwitte needed powerful, but nevertheless agile, locomotives in order to cross the Haarstrang hills. From about 1910 the WLE procured and used second-hand ten-coupled engines for hauling freight trains and improved their curve running by having their running gear converted to the G√∂lsdorf system. Three such locomotives were sold to the Ledesma sugar cane refinery.

It was a silver mining town approximately south-southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah. This area was considered part of the Tintic Mining District and also produced bismuth, copper, gold, and lead. Settlement began with the first mining strikes here in 1869. Silver City was inhabited until 1930 after the mines ran out. Jesse Knight, known as the \\"Mormon Wizard\\" for his ability to find ore easily, decided to build a smelter in Silver City because it had the flattest ground in all of the Tintic Mining District. Silver City had several mines in 1890, but the mines hit water and were abandoned. Now there is little left other than a few holes where mines were, and a number of tailings piles. The Silver City Cemetery, however, survives and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History In 1869, a cowboy prospector named George Rust discovered the remains of old Native American mines in Dragon Canyon. By December a large claim known as the Sunbeam Mine was located here, and a new mining camp went up quickly as the rich mines multiplied. Growth soon slowed, however, as miners were drawn away by tales of spectacular strikes in Alta and Park City. Lacking the placer deposits of many Utah mines, extracting Silver City's riches required labor- intensive hard rock mining. Early on, mine owners lacked capital and could develop the mines only slowly. Gradually the town grew from a mere tent city with a saloon and a blacksmith shop, to include a claims recorder and assay office, a telegraph branch, stagecoach line, and post office, and eventually numerous stores, hotels, and restaurants. There were even two railroad depots, as both the Salt Lake & Western Railroad and the Tintic Range Railroad ran lines into town. Economic conditions improved, and by 1899 Silver City's population reached 800. In the 1890s, just as the mine companies seemed to be locating the richest ore bodies, a new difficulty stood in their way: the mine shafts started filling with water. While the richest mines continued operating with the help of expensive pumps, Silver City began to dwindle as the more marginal mines flooded and closed. Miners left in even greater numbers after the town was devastated by fire in 1902. In 1904 Silver City had a total of 18 businesses. In 1907 Jesse Knight, already a successful mine owner in the Tintic area, revitalized Silver City by establishing the Utah Ore Sampling Company and the Tintic smelter here. He nearly transformed Silver City into a company town, but for the fact that he didn't own the land. Knight built a power plant, some 100 new homes, and yet another railroad, called the Eureka Hill Railroad. By 1908 Silver City's population surged to its peak of 1500, most of them Knight employees. That year the town held a special celebration called \\"Smelter Day\\" in conjunction with Utah's annual Pioneer Day holiday. Silver City's resurgence was short-lived. Due to dropping freight rates, Knight's smelter proved unable to compete with those in the Salt Lake Valley. Records show that by 1912 the population was already down to 300, and there were only 8 businesses left.Wilson, p.137. In 1915 the smelter was shut down and moved to Murray. Silver City's decline is often considered to have been complete by 1930, but it was still a separate precinct in the 1940 census,Wilson, p.222. which recorded a population of 111. Today it is uninhabited.

This second novel follows the adventures of telepathic waitress Sookie Stackhouse of Bon Temps, Louisiana, as she is employed by Dallas vampires to use her telepathy to help find their lost companion. Sookie agrees to help investigate the whereabouts of the missing vampire on one condition: any humans found to be involved must be turned over to human law enforcement rather than subjected to vampire justice. In Dallas Sookie Stackhouse has her first encounter with the anti-vampire organization \\"The Fellowship of the Sun,\\" as well as meeting and learning of the existence of werewolves. Plot summary This book opens with Sookie Stackhouse finding the dead body of Lafayette in the backseat of Andy Bellefleur's car, which had been left at Merlotte's the night before. Sookie learns that her friend had recently attended a local sex party. She thinks the members of that group might know something about her friend's murder so she starts \\"listening\\" to people's thoughts by using her special mind reading talent while working at the local bar. In the meantime, Bill Compton, Sookie's vampire boyfriend, informs her that they have been summoned by Eric Northman. As a way to get Eric's attention, a maenad known as Callisto attacks Sookie on their way to Fangtasia, Eric's vampire bar. Sookie's wounds are poisoned, and she is healed by a combination of Dr. Ludwig's special treatment, and blood drainings by Eric, Pam, Chow, and Bill. Sookie is later given a fresh transfusion of human blood. Eric informs Bill and Sookie that they need to go to Dallas to help the local vampire leader, Stan Davis, to find his missing \\"brother,\\" Farrell, who has not returned to Davis' nest for five days. The Dallas vampires, Sookie, and Bill learn that The Fellowship of the Sun (FotS) as well as a \\"renouncer\\" vampire named Godfrey might be behind the disappearance. Sookie decides to go to the FotS church with Hugo, Stan's human dish washer (although he is a lawyer in his regular human life) and the lover of Stan's \\"sister,\\" Isabel, in an undercover mission. Sookie discovers that Hugo is a traitor, but her cover is quickly exposed when they meet Steve and Sarah Newlin, and she is badly hurt while trying to escape from the church. She does escape with the help of Luna, a shapeshifter, and Godfrey (who turns out to be a remorseful child molester and killer). After a run-in with more Supes, including an undercover doctor at a local hospital and some werewolves, Sookie ends up back at the FotS to be with Godfrey as he \\"meets the sun.\\" That night at the welcome home party for Farrell, Stan's house is attacked by the FotS and many humans die. Sookie, unable to locate Bill, helps Eric remove a bullet that he took protecting her from the gunfire; he insists the only safe way to remove it is to suck the bullet out. In doing so, she ingests a few drops of his blood inadvertently. Bill returns soon after; he had chased down members of the FotS. He reveals to Sookie that Eric's insistence on sucking out the bullets was just a ruse to get her to ingest some of his blood--now he will have a connection with her. Sookie is furious at Eric. She is also angry at Bill because he killed someone and did not check on her before beginning his pursuit of the FotS. Sookie leaves the house and immediately flies back to Bon Temps. Back in Bon Temps, Sookie avoids Bill for several weeks during which Bill \\"dates\\" Portia Bellefleur, who is trying to find out more about the sex club in an effort to clear her brother Andy of any connection to the murder. After seeing Sookie at a football game with Tara, Benedict \\"Eggs\\" Talley (Tara's fianc√©), and JB du Rone (another male friend), Bill follows Sookie home and they passionately (and violently) reconcile. The next day, Sookie is invited to a secret sex party organized by Mike Spencer. Afraid to go alone, Sookie asks Eric to accompany her as Bill is out of town. At the sex party, Sookie is surprised to see her friend Tara and Eggs and learns that Mike and Tom Hardaway murdered Lafayette. The party is interrupted when Bill, Andy Bellefleur, Sam (in collie form), and the maenad Callisto gather in front of the house. The maenad enjoys the drunkenness and lust of the party participants and eventually kills Mike, Tom and his wife, and another local named Jan. Eggs & Andy, under the maenad's spell, recall nothing of the incident - Tara is the only non-supernatural present with any recollection of the events (she was hidden and thus did not fall under the maenad's spell). Bill and Eric burn the house, and Eric glamours Tara so that she will not be able to remember what happened at the sex party.

There is a village called Saddington in Leicestershire. Spiritual journey John Saddington was popularly known as Saddington the Tallhe features as such in one of the Muggletonian songs. Divine songs of the Muggletonians Clerkenwell: Joseph Frost 1829 and was noted for his striking good looks. He saysJohn Saddington A Prospective-glass for Saints and Sinners first published 1673. Reprinted Deal: J. May (1823) General Epistle (first introduction of two, not paginated) that as a child he delved into books at every opportunity. His family were of the Presbyterian faith. He became unsettled when, as an eighteen-year-old, he read a book called A sword troubled, or, The Terror of Tythes in which ministers who took tithes were criticised as \\"oppressors of the poor and robbers of God.\\" He says, \\"I was lost in myself as these ministers in whom I put my trust were such as took tythes.\\" After that, \\"the assurance of my salvation was all I looked after.\\" Yet neither Presbyterian, Independent nor Baptist satisfied him. He admits he would have been persuaded by the Quakers if he had heard of them first but he later rejected them because \\"they will not acknowledge the resurrection of the body of Christ.\\" He first heard of John Reeve and Lodowicke Muggleton from an apprentice friend who had met the pair in Bridewell gaol.This would have been 1653 or 1654. John Reeve and Lodowicke Muggleton were serving six months under the Blasphemy Act 1650. He borrowed a copy of John Reeve's A Transcendent Spirituall Treatise and was convinced. He seems to have been one of the first adherents to the Muggletonian faith and, as a consequence, liked to style himself \\"the eldest son of the Commission of the Spirit\\" and \\"An Ancient Believer\\". Certainly, he was one of the most loyal of believers and spoke out on behalf of Muggleton's point of view during the rebellion of 'The Nine Assertions', engineered by William Medgate, a London scrivener, from January 1671. Muggleton was unable to defend himself as he was on the run from an arrest warrant and living in hiding amongst the watermen of Wapping. The revolt was about Nine Assertions, said by William Medgate to have been made by Lodowicke Muggleton, and which were thought to deviate from the true prophecy revealed to John Reeve. Reeve and Muggleton were believed to be the Two Last Witnesses mentioned in the Book of Revelation 11:3 but only Reeve had received his commission from the voice of God. So it was always arguable whether there were two equal prophets or only one fully commissioned prophet, John Reeve. The nine assertions might be thought to boil down to only one (that's certainly the way Muggleton looked at it) which concerned Muggleton's insistence that God takes no notice of everyday goings-on in this world. This idea is not found explicitly in any of John Reeve's writings. In fact, everything John Reeve said pointed in the opposite direction. \\"Nothing comes by chance or fortune, but all through or by the providential choice of the most high.\\"William Lamont The Last Witnesses Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing (2006) p. 131 Muggleton was quite candid about the situation. He said that although John Reeve was generally infallible in matters of doctrine, he was only human and could sometimes get things confused. This was one of those things and John Reeve had accepted Muggleton's correction. But we only have Muggleton's word for that. The idea about immediate notice (or the lack of it) was not originally Muggleton's. It was first written about by Laurence Clarkson. It perhaps strengthened Muggleton's hand that someone who might have been expected to follow John Reeve was so emphatically in-line with Muggleton on the issue. And it is why John Saddington started to write books. \\"The Articles of True Faith\\" John Saddington wrote six works in all; four circulated in manuscript and two were printed. The Articles of True Faith is just a pamphlet, first published in 1675, said to have been printed anew in 1830no copies of the 1830 edition seem to be known but, since the 1880 version is said to be a reprint and the text is in modern English, it seems likely that an edition was at least prepared for the press in 1830. and definitely reprinted in 1880.John Saddington The Articles of True Faith Walthamstow: Isaac Frost Jnr and Mrs Sarah Ann Huntley (1880) It is also reproduced in T.

Underwood The Acts of the Witnesses New York: Oxford University Press (1999) at p. 171 John Saddington's seventeenth century text must have been highly valued by late-Victorian Muggletonians if they wanted to have it in print in preference to their own collective effort The Faith and Practice of the Muggletonians written in 1870 but not, as yet, published.Professor Lamont attributes the 1870 text to the work of John Dimock Aspland (1816‚Äì1877). Lamont Last Witnesses p. 2 The work is written in the style of a personal credo with each of 48 articles beginning \\"I do believe that ... \\" The dedication to the work says it is written to confound and disprove all despisers that say, firstly, \\"We do not know what we believe\\" and secondly, that the Muggletonians \\"do own neither God nor devil.\\" The first charge, that of lacking internal consistency, was a commonplace of sectarian disputes. Quakers taunted Muggletonians with it and Lodowicke Muggleton threw it back at any \\"ignorant spatter-brained Quaker\\" who crossed pens with him.Lodowicke Muggleton An answer to William Penn (1673) reprinted Clerkenwell: E. Brown (1835) The hugely abusive style of the exchange of pamphlets seems to derive entirely from a personal trait of Lodowicke Muggleton, not emulated by his followers. It is fair to say that Quakers such as Isaac Pennington, William Penn and George Fox, paid him back as good as he gave. John Reeve's correspondence with Isaac Pennington is far more measured and persuasive and, from a Muggletonian perspective, the last word had already been written long before in Laurence Clarkson's definitive The Quakers Downfall (1659). The charge of not acknowledging God or devil was really an attempt to smear Muggletonians as unreconstructed Ranters. It is true Muggletonians do not accept the idea of the devil as a distinct personality but as a 'seed' present, to a greater or lesser extent, in all human beings. Muggletonians could only be said not to own a God in the sense that they regarded the man Christ Jesus as being the Holy One of Israel. Again, this formula was not original to Muggleton. It had appeared in Tobias Crisp's Christ alone exalted (1643). For the most part, John Saddington does not say anything in forty eight articles which Lodowicke Muggleton had not said in six principles.These six principles are 1) that there is no God but the glorified Man Christ Jesus, 2) there is no devil but the unclean Reason of men, 3) Heaven is an infinite abode of light above and beyond the stars, 4) the place of Hell will be this earth when sun, moon and stars are extinguished, 5) Angels are the only beings of Pure Reason, 6) the Soul dies with the body and will be raised with it. George Charles Williamson Lodowick Muggleton London: Chiswick Press (1919) A God exists beyond the stars. He is a glorious body, in form like a man from all eternity. He created the angels from stardust, like to himself in form but not in nature. Angelic satisfaction was withheld from one angel who fell to earth as the serpent tempter. Dust and water existed for eternity and creation gave them form. Thus was Adam created by breath of life and by the word. Yet, John Saddington comes into his own in two places. In articles 33 to 38, he sets out the Muggletonian belief that all human bodies and all souls are mortal and must die, eventually to face either a glorious resurrection or a second death when time is brought to an end. As a result, the body and soul of the man Christ Jesus died and lay in the grave just like any other man except that his flesh was incorruptible for the man had been sinless. Article 36 says, \\"I do believe that Christ was a quickening spirit and that He did quicken out of death to life by His own power.\\" As a result, says article 34, \\"I do believe that no other blood but the blood of the eternal God could wash away the sins of the elect.\\" But only the elect. At the end of time, the candidates for resurrection will be separated as the sheep and the goats. In articles 19 to 25, John Saddington discusses the doctrine of the two seeds; the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent. Article 22 says, \\"I do believe that the seed of the woman is the generation of faithful people, which proceed from the loins of the blessed Seth, who was the son of Adam, who was the son of God.\\" Thus, article 25 concludes, \\"I do believe that the difference and opposition which ariseth between believers and unbelievers concerning their faith in God is that enmity which God said he would put between the serpent and the woman and between his seed and her seed.\\" But was Saddington's contribution really helpful? It is only his personal statement of belief. To the extent that these beliefs are co-extensive with the six principles of Muggletonian belief, then they are redundant. To the extent they go beyond them, they are controversial and any believer is free to accept or reject as he or she pleases. This issue becomes important in his other, much more substantial, published work, A Prospective-glass for Saints and Sinners where he enlarges upon the status of John Reeve and Lodowicke Muggleton. \\"A Prospective-glass for Saints and Sinners\\"=Purposes of the book= This book can be seen in two ways which are by no means mutually exclusive. Firstly, it is one of the few Muggletonian books addressed to non-believers. (If one accepts the view that Muggletonians had principled objections to evangelism, then Saddington's book should never have existed at all.) Saddington is well equipped to write a popular book. He has a bright, journalistic style which is appealing and, above all, he couches his comments in the everyday experience of urban tradesmen and housewives and does not begin from bible doctrine. The main text is preceded by two introductions, one to his fellow believers and one, a 'General Epistle', addressed to the 'Courteous Reader'. Secondly, it is in the address to the believers that he puts the frequently asked question 'why did I write this book?' but he never truly answers himself. It is as if he wants the Muggletonian reader to stop, consider, then tease out a deeper meaning of his or her own. When he does finally answer a question, it is the different one of why he has not written the book earlier. His reasons are that he saw little need to write whilst there was still a live prophet amongst them and because, if he wrote, he had to make reference to his own experience which he felt reluctant to do. Just what this experience was that might make his fellow believers question if he were a fit and proper person to exhort them to righteousness, he naturally doesn't say. Clearly, if we don't know, we don't need to know. And we don't. So time has healed his wound. But the prophet Muggleton was still alive when Saddington wrote his book, so what had really changed? =Context of the book= The choice of content for the book is partially influenced by events that were recent to its time of writing, notably the rebellion led by William Medgate over whether God took any notice of everyday affairs on earth. Those who championed a positive response tended to privilege John Reeve and to allege that it was Lodowicke Muggleton who was introducing new and erroneous ideas of his own fancy. They drew attention to the consequences of the dispute, especially that if God took no notice there was no court of appeal against Muggleton's supreme authority. The prophet was all-powerful and he was misusing his powers in antinomian ways. They criticised the idea that the prophet's favour could uphold a man even though he sins.William Medgate's assertions are set out in T. L. Underwood The Acts of the Witnesses p. 113/4 Muggleton said eight of the assertions were merely misreadings of his position and only one, the immediate notice argument, had to be confronted. To that, Muggleton's simple answer was that if people only obey the law from fear of being caught and punished then there is no honesty in the matter. The law is not written externally in books but inside everyone's own heart. \\"Compliance based upon fear is no moral position at all,\\" says Professor Lamont, who believes, \\"It is no exaggeration to say that his answer anticipates the Kantian doctrine of the autonomy of ethics.\\"William Lamont The Last Witnesses p.69 Many critics of the Muggletonian faith did think it inconsistent to say that God takes no notice of the world yet a sentence of God's eternal damnation could be pronounced by the prophet in the expectation of some rapid confirmation of the effects of the cursing for all to see. Edward Delamaine, the Baptist brother of the Muggletonian tobacco merchant Alexander Delamaine, made exactly this point. Muggleton cursed him. But does Muggleton's answer mean that people can be saved by their own efforts? Not at all. Those in whom the seed of the serpent predominates will find that all their well-meaning efforts will prove ineffectual. This is the seed-corn falling on stony ground. But this defence, in its turn, brings back all the old charges of Ranterism ‚Äì that a sin is no sin if the intentions are pure, which is not what Muggleton wanted to say at all. These problems are what Saddington had to cope with. It was not simply a matter of summarising uncontested principles. How does he go about it? =Saddington's new synthesis= John Saddington grounds his book, not in theology, but in the everyday concerns of urban life. He describes the mistakes people make: by alternating fits of hard work with spells of lethargy, of failing to put something by for hard times, of becoming a burden to others in old age, of working so hard whilst young that they decay before their time, and of working flat-out during the week so they are fit only to waste their money down the pub at weekends. Few tradesmen or their families would fail to recognise something in this sad catalogue. On page 42, John Saddington reminisces his own ups and downs. \\"Again, it is not the earning of a great deal of money in a day, or a week, that causes a man and his family to live comfortably, but the well managing of what he getteth, this I know by experience.\\" The choice is no stylistic quirk. It is central to his understanding of the Muggletonian message. On this earth, the elect are far from perfect. They sin and sin again. This frailty is because the seed of the serpent is always mixed in with the seed of faith. What is amiss with all this sin is not that it infringes a written law but that it disturbs the inner peace of the believer. Good conduct, then, does matter. And or this reason, Muggletonian beliefs can never fairly be called antinomian. All sin is not equal; the elect sinner differs from the reprobate sinner. According to Saddington, Jesus died so that the sins of the elect should not permanently count against them. (p. 59) The believer's inner peace, although disturbed by sin and possibly rocked to the core by its misery, is never destroyed by it. What is present in Saddington's work, and which passed John Reeve by, is that the Jesus who shared our human predicament did so as redeemer. Man and redeemer are not two aspects of the same divine activity. The one is precisely the other. This redemption makes each elect person a free-born man or woman. This right is undeniable and irrevocable. This is not a complacent consolation. It is a right to see reality differently once superficiality has been shrugged off. What is revealed, only believers can see. As for the remnant; the heart of this people is fat. They have eyes, not that they may see, but they may be lulled into never questioning. For Muggletonians, faith is never grounded in reason. Right conduct preserves a middle way of inner harmony and psychic balance. The pleasures of the world are not to be avoided and condemned but they are to be seen for what they are: here \\"but for a season\\". (p. 38) Inner harmony is a foretaste of paradise to come. (p. 35) When \\"the peace of a man's mind is broken and he hath no more liberty and freedom in his mind to mind the glorious things of eternity,\\" (p. 46) then, \\"to steal he is afraid, to beg he is ashamed, his credit is so bad nobody will trust him and in this condition there can be no peace.\\" (p. 47) \\"I know it is the heart God mindeth, not the outward appearance.\\" (p. 58) Distractions from inner peace are poverty, wealth and position. Anyone who seeks honour in this world cannot remain committed to the faith because the great and good will insist upon a change of ways. (p. 33) He quotes the example of Nicodemus, who must come by night. (p. 41) And those who strive for greatness will draw down upon themselves the causes of their undoing in the form of the envy and malice of others who seek their place. (p. 35) Hence, the Witnesses are not accepted by the people because the people see they are not accepted by the rulers. (p. 41) But poverty is naturally an even greater distraction. Saddington rejects the instruction to \\"take no care for tomorrow but let the day bring forth for itself\\" as being suitable only to the Apostles. (p. 45) John Saddington deals extensively with the matter of God's appearances on this earth. He maintains these give clear evidence that God is not an infinite spirit capable of being in all earthly places at once. (p. 88) He gives supporting examples of God's appearing in the garden and asking, \\"where art thou, Adam?\\", God putting Moses in the cleft of the rock as he passes by, and God's appearance to Moses in the 'burning bush'. \\"Always where God is, that place is holy.\\" (p. 89) He also answers, he believes, an objection of Psalm 139, \\"Whither shall I go from thy spirit or whither shall I fly from thy presence?\\" by saying this refers to 'God's watchman' (the law written in our hearts) which no one can escape. (p. 91) Conversely, the singular appearances of God on this earth show that there is not a divine presence other than at extraordinary times. He cites Melchizedek as one such divine appearance and the third 'angel' to come to Abraham when only two go on to Sodom. (p. 98) Lastly, with reference to events that had only recently preceded his book, he says it is not enough to believe the doctrines, we have to believe in the prophets' commission, too.

A French army besieging Landau surprised and defeated a German relief army near Speyer.  Prelude  In mid October 1703, the allied armies prepared to go into winter camp along the Moselle, when Tallard by surprise closed in on Landau and started the siege on 17 October. On 28 October the allies ordered Crown Prince Frederick of Hesse-Kassel, the future King Frederick I of Sweden, to move south to lift the siege of Landau. Hesse- Kassel would have to cooperate with the Count John Ernst of Nassau-Weilburg, who was on the right bank of the Rhine with 24 battalions and 18 squadrons. Both armies met on 13 November near Speyer and made camp south of the brook Speyerbach, where Nassau-Weilburg and Hesse-Kassel waited for reinforcements to march to Landau on 16 November. Tallard had meanwhile decided not to wait for the enemy at Landau, but to march towards them and deliver battle. He ordered troops under Armand, marquis de Pracomtal at Saarbrucken, to join him at Essingen.  Battle  The German troops were not expecting a French attack and their camp was not planned for defence. Furthermore, the command, including both Hesse-Kassel and Nassau-Weilburg, was gathered in Speyer on 15 November, in order to celebrate the Emperor's name day. At 07:00 the united French armies marched towards Speyer, where they arrived at 12:00 and deployed until 13:00. The German troops, in absence of their leaders reacted slowly and in confusion. General Vehlen did his best to position the army, but large gaps were left in the left wing. Tallard ordered 14 squadrons of his right wing to attack. This attack failed to destroy the allied left wing but succeeded in passing through the gaps in their line. At about this moment Nassau-Weilburg arrived on the field and intervened with his cavalry. This led to a defeat of the French cavalry. Instead of disengaging his troops and reforming a line, Nassau-Weilburg pursued the French with his Palatine cavalry on a terrain which was not suitable for horses. About 14:00 the whole French army attacked. On the left wing the French cavalry was decisively beaten by the allied cavalry. The French lost 19 standards and Pracomtal was killed. In the center the allies held, but on their right wing the French were successful. On the utter right six battalions started by driving Vehlen's cavalry back. It lost its cohesion and fled. The French infantry attacked the Palatine infantry and this fled too. The French then started to envelop the enemy center. This caused an enormous number of casualties amongst these troops. The remaining German troops retreated in good order and the battle ended when they started to recross the Speyerbach at about 17:00. The French did not hinder them in this operation.  Aftermath  Tallard achieved one of the biggest French victories of the war. Landau capitulated the same day. This French victory has been overshadowed in history by their colossal defeat in the Battle of Blenheim nine months later.

He is venerated as a saint in the Orthodox Church with his feast day on May 1, ·Ωâ ·ΩçœÉŒπŒøœÇ Œ£œÖŒºŒµ·ΩºŒΩ ·ΩÅ Œ†ŒµŒΩœÑŒ¨Œ≥ŒªœâœÉœÉŒøœÇ ·ΩÅ Œ£ŒπŒΩŒ±ŒêœÑŒ∑œÇ. 1 ŒúŒ±ŒêŒøœÖ.

Life Simeon was born in the late 10th century in Syracuse, Sicily, to a Greek father and a Calabrian mother, during the period of Arab rule of the island. His father, who had been a soldier of the Byzantine army, sent him to Constantinople when he was seven years old to learn to read and write their native Greek language. As he grew older, Symeon decided to lead a life of religion, so he set out on a pilgrimage to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Afterwards, for seven years, he became a guide, leading pilgrims to the holy places, before tiring of this life and preferring instead to live as a recluse. Having heard of a holy recluse who lived in a tower on the bank of the Jordan River, Simeon went to work as his servant, living in the lower room of the tower, while learning from his new master how to practise the life of a recluse. Forced to depart, he realised after reading and re-reading the Lives of the Fathers (Vitae patrum), that in order to become a recluse he should train for a time in a monastery. As a result, he entered the Monastery of the Virgin Mary in Bethlehem and became a monk. After two years there, he transferred to the famed Saint Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt. While he was a member of that community, he was ordained as a deacon. After serving the brethren for some years there, Simeon gained the abbot's permission to depart to live as a hermit, settling alone in a small cave on the shore of the Red Sea. A monk from the monastery brought him bread every Sunday, but after two years, being disturbed by passing sailors and seeing how worn out the monk who brought his food had become, he decided to return to the monastery. On the orders of his abbot he then restored a ruined monastery on the peak of Mount Sinai, but upon his return he still conceived a desire to live as a hermit, so he absconded and found a spot in the desert. The abbot soon discovered him, called him back to the monastery. In 1026 the abbot sent Simeon to Rouen in France on monastery business with Richard II, Duke of Normandy. He duly set out, but while travelling down the Nile his boat was attacked by pirates, who butchered the crew. Simeon barely escaped with his life, diving into the water. When he swam ashore he had no idea whether the people in the little village he reached were Christian or not, because he was unable to communicate with them in any of the languages he spoke (namely Coptic, Syrian, Arabic, Greek and Latin). Eventually Simeon made his way to Antioch, where he joined a group of some 700 pilgrims returning from Jerusalem, among whom was the German abbot, Eberwin, of the Abbey of Tholey. Simeon joined the group, but when they reached Belgrade the Hungarian officials barred them from going any farther, so they returned via Rome to France. Simeon finally reached Rouen, only to find that Duke Richard was dead. He fulfilled his mission and then traveled around France and Germany, visiting Abbot Eberwin in Tholey and going to Trier. In the meantime Poppo, Archbishop of Trier, (1016‚Äì1047) was planning a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and, after meeting Simeon, invited him to accompany him on the journey. They set out and reached Jerusalem. Simeon, however, chose not to return to his own monastery in Egypt, instead accompanying Poppo back to Trier, a trip which lasted from 1028-1030. After their return, Simeon asked Poppo if he could live as a recluse in the great Roman gate of the city, the Porta Nigra. Poppo agreed and conducted a ceremony on 29 November 1030, the feast day of St. Andrew, before all the clergy and people in which Symeon was enclosed in a cell, high in the gate tower. St. Simeon, in the vestments of a deacon, being attacked by demons Shortly after he was enclosed, 'dead and buried to the world' for his love of God, a great flood ravaged the city and country round about. The people now thought that Symeon was a sorcerer whose devilry had caused the flood, so they pelted his cell with stones, breaking the window. Even so, Symeon persisted with his prayers and fasts, allegedly beating off demonic attacks, eating a sparse diet of bread, water and beans, and praying upright with his arms outstretched, lest in lying down he fall asleep. He died on 1 June 1035, and was buried in his cell, just as he had insisted. Veneration Within a month miracles were being reported at his tomb, and a ladder was set up so that sick and needy pilgrims could climb up to his shrine. At the urging of Poppo, Abbot Eberwin wrote an account of his life and early miracles in the very same year he died - as Maurice Coens has shown.Maurice Coens, ‚ÄòUn document in√©dit sur le culte de S. Sym√©on, moine d‚Äôorient et reclus a Tr√®ves‚Äô, Analecta Bollandiana 68 (1950), 181-96, pp. 184-6. Archbishop Poppo swiftly sent this to Pope Benedict IX, who responded with an official bull of canonization. Poppo then founded a monastery at the site of Symeon's life and tomb. When Poppo died in 1047, he was buried there. He was canonized on 5 January 1047 by Pope Clement II. Many more miracles were recorded subsequently, and the fame of St Symeon spread far and wide.Eberwin, ‚ÄòDe sancto Symeone, recluso in porta Trevirensi‚Äô, AASS, Jun 1, cols 0089A-0101E See also * Saints canonized by Pope Benedict IX ReferencesSources * Eberwin, ‚ÄòDe sancto Symeone, recluso in porta Trevirensi‚Äô, Acta Sanctorum, Jun 1, cols 0089A-0101E. * Maurice Coens, ‚ÄòUn document in√©dit sur le culte de S.

The game was invented in the Netherlands where it is known as kwartet. The game was originally created by Austrian card game company Piatnik during the 1960s,Top Trumps History and Game Rules but later began being released by Dubreq, Ace, Waddingtons and other companies. Quartets, like Ace Trumps, were usually non- licensed. Each pack originally contained 32 cards, divided into 8 groups of 4 cards, unlike a normal 52 pack of playing cards, but the number of groups changed from company to company. The game went on to inspire Top Trumps. In the Netherlands the game is now frequently used as an educational tool. Gameplay Quartets is played with three or more players, with the aim to win all the quartets (sets of four). Each card usually has a number and letter (1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 2A, 2B etc. ) in the top right or left corner of the card. The cards are shuffled and dealt evenly between all the players and the cards get held face up in a players hand. The player to the dealer's left starts by asking another player if they had a certain card (example, card 4C) which would help the player create a quartet. If the player does have the card, then they hand it over. If the player doesn't, then it becomes her or his turn to ask. When a quartet is created, or a complete quartet was dealt, then the cards creating the quartet are placed in front of the player. The game ends when all the quartets have been created. The winner is the person with the most quartets.

He was the commander of the defense group III (Berlin) and had a role in ensuring the failure of the attempted coup after the 20 July Plot attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler, which was led by Kortzfleisch's distant cousin, Claus von Stauffenberg. Biography Joachim von Kortzfleisch was born into an aristocratic Westphalian family in Braunschweig, Duchy of Brunswick, the son of the Prussian Major General Gustav von Kortzfleisch (1854 ‚Äì 1910) and Elsbeth Oppermann (1862 ‚Äì 1937). He joined the army in 1907 and after service in World War I in a machine gun battalion he was an officer in the Reichswehr, reaching the rank of Generalmajor by 1937. He was a generalleutnant and commander of the 1st Infantry Division at the outbreak of World War II and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 1 September 1940 as commander of the XI Army Corps of the Wehrmacht. On 20 July 1944 as the commander of the defense group III (Berlin) he was summoned to the Bendlerstrasse by General Friedrich Fromm. When he arrived, he was perplexed to see that Fromm was no longer in command, that Ludwig Beck was now in control. He angrily refused to obey Operation Valkyrie orders issued by one of the leading conspirators General Friedrich Olbricht and kept shouting ‚Äòthe F√ºhrer is not dead‚Äô and referring to the oath of loyalty to Hitler. He was arrested and put under guard by the plotters and said that he was not willing to take part in a coup as he was just a soldier interested only in going home and pulling weeds in his garden. He was replaced in his command by General Karl Freiherr von Th√ºngen and was later allowed to leave the Bendlerblock. He subsequently interrogated Major Hans-Ulrich von Oertzen who was a supporter of the plot. Kortzfleisch was later shocked to learn that the officer leading the plot was his distant cousin Claus von Stauffenberg, who had recently attended a wedding with Kortzfleisch the previous year. In March 1945 he was the commander of the Rhine Bridgehead in Army Group B under Field Marshal Walter Model. He was shot dead by soldiers of the 737th Tank Battalion of the United States Army on 20 April 1945. Kortzfleisch and a handful of soldiers had tried to get to Berleburg, moving behind the enemy lines. A US patrol encountered them at Schmallenberg-Wulwesort, Sauerland. The general defended himself with a machine pistol as he was surrounded by US soldiers, and was told to put his hands up. After he refused to do this, he was instantly shot by a US soldier.

The thrust fault was discovered in 1999 and runs about in three discrete sections from the Puente Hills region in the southeast to just south of Griffith Park in the northwest. The fault is known as a blind thrust fault, as the fault plane does not extend to the surface. Large earthquakes on the fault are relatively infrequent but computer modeling has indicated that a major event could have substantial impact in the Los Angeles area. The fault is now thought to be responsible for one moderate earthquake in 1987 (the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake) and another light event that took place in 2010, with the former causing considerable damage and deaths. Geology The Los Angeles Basin is situated along the coast of Southern California at the confluence of the Transverse Ranges and the Peninsular Ranges. The basin is under the influence of several strike-slip and blind thrust faults with geodetic studies providing evidence of the northern basin being shortened in the north-south or northeast-southwest directions at a rate of per year. Some of the shortening can be attributed to several known fault systems and two models have been proposed to account for the excess. The Puente Hills Fault thrust system runs across the northern Los Angeles Basin from Downtown Los Angeles to near Brea and the Chino Hills in northern Orange County. It may account for some of the shortening in the northern Los Angeles Basin. The Puente Hills thrust system was identified on a collection of seismic reflection profiles that were acquired for the petroleum industry. The data were made available to seismologists John Shaw and others for a comprehensive study of the region that was published in the bulletin of the Seismological Society of America in 2002. The thrust system is visually distinct as north dipping reflections in many of these representations. Stacking velocity measurements and sonic logging in the area helped to determine that the fault plane slopes at 25‚Äì30¬∞. The system comprises three sections that strike generally east-west and are labeled the Los Angeles, Sante Fe, and Coyote Hills segments. Seismic risk The frequency of a major rupture in the Puente Hills Fault is on the order of once per several thousand years. This frequency of occurrence is relatively low compared to the San Andreas Fault, which is a transform fault. More specifically, geologists have determined that the fault has ruptured at least four times in the past 11,000 years. The magnitudes of such earthquakes are considered to have been 7.2 ‚Äì 7.5 . The highest magnitude in that range would be about fifteen times stronger than the 1994 Northridge earthquake in terms of energy release. That event was the strongest in recorded history for the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The location of the fault directly below metropolitan Los Angeles leads it to be of great concern for the public, with various predicted scenarios in the event of an earthquake. If a similar earthquake were to happen today, the projected losses (determined from computer modeling) could be about $250 billion in property damage along with 3,000 to 18,000 deaths. Two simulations were produced that helped emergency planners and engineers visualize what may occur when a large earthquake takes place. The Southern California Earthquake Center developed a model that approximates the shaking from earthquakes of varying sizes, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency ran a simulation that translates the intensity of shaking into real-world property damage and loss of life. Earthquakes The source of the October 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake was determined to be the Puente Hills thrust system (unknown at the time) and could be identified by the fault-plane solution of the mainshock and aftershocks, fault-plane reflections (up to 8 km deep), and by high resolution seismic profiles at shallower depths. According to a Caltech seismologist the magnitude 4.4 Pico Rivera earthquake of March 2010, which was weaker than both the 2008 Chino Hills earthquake and the 2009 Inglewood quake, was caused by movement on the Puente Hills fault. A magnitude 5.1 earthquake occurred on 3/28/2014 on the Puente Hills Fault and was centered 1 mile east of La Habra, California.

He was born Robert Joseph Prignano on July 16, 1934 in Forest Hills, Queens. He adopted the surname Palmer when he started working as he felt people found it too hard to spell. He went to school in Queens Village, Queens and attended Chaminade High School in Mineola, New York. He did not attend college and started employment in the advertising industry in his early teens. By 1970, he was president and chief executive of Kelly Nason, growing its billings from $14 million to $140 million by the time he left the position in 1978. He started a media buying service, called RJ Palmer, in 1979, which he sold in the 1990s but remained active in the business until two years before his death.Weber, Bruce. \\"Robert Palmer, Ad Executive Turned Vintner, Dies at 74\\", The New York Times, January 24, 2009. Accessed January 29, 2009. After selling his interest in Kelly Nason, he bought land for his vineyard in 1983 in Aquebogue, in Suffolk County, New York, despite knowing almost nothing about the wine business. The winery he opened in 1986 was one of the most modern in the nascent wine- growing business on the North Fork of Long Island, and he made his business one of the most friendly to visitors. One of the first major investors in the area, Palmer Vineyards produces up to 16,000 cases of wine annually, specializing in Cabernet Franc and sauvignon blanc. His company was one of the first to export wine grown on Long Island internationally. His wines have been served on American Airlines and at restaurants from California to Walt Disney World to Gallagher's Steak House in Manhattan, where it is served as the house wine.Harrington, Mark. \\"Bob Palmer, owner of Palmer Vineyards, dies at 74\\", Newsday, January 17, 2009. Accessed January 29, 2009. Despite a personal preference for martinis, Palmer would taste all of his own wines and exercise final approval on his products, but did not otherwise prefer to drink wine. He had been impressed with people who could accurately identify wines while blindfolded by vineyard and a vintage, which led him to pursue wine tasting as a hobby. Palmer died at age 74 on January 16, 2009 of a blood infection. He was survived by the former Lorraine Wittmer, his wife of 50 years, four daughters and three grandsons.

On retiring from rugby union, Parfitt switched to bowls and also represented Wales in this sport. Rugby career Parfitt first played rugby for local club team Pontnewydd, before switching to first class club, Newport. At Newport, Parfitt was partnered at scrum-half with Percy Phillips, and played behind a formidable pack filled with Wales internationals Arthur Gould, Bob Gould and Charlie Thomas.Smith (1980), pg 72. Parfitt was first selected to represent Wales as part of the 1893 Home Nations Championship in the opening game against England. Under the captaincy of Arthur Gould, Parfitt was chosen to partner Phillips, who although was recognised as an elusive attacker was seen as a weak proposition in defence and poor at spot kicking.Smith (1980), pg 81. Where Phillips was an asset was in his link-up play with Gould, the team mates would break together in attack using inter-passing and feints to confuse their opponents. Parfitt's role was to cover Phillips and make sure that his offensive play did not cause defensive weaknesses. Parfitt and Phillips partnered each other in all three games of the 1893 Championship, which saw Wales win all matches and raise the Triple Crown for the first time in the country's history. Parfitt was reselected for Wales for the 1894 Championship, but Welsh campaign had a terrible start when England beat them 24-3. Parfitt gained his only international points during this game when he scored a try, though the Welsh pack squabbled throughout the game, with Frank Hill working against the wishes of his captain Gould. After a win against Scotland, Parfitt saw his partnership at scrum-half change, when in the final game of the tournament against Ireland, Phillips was replaced by Cardiff's Ralph Sweet- Escott. Parfitt played just a single game of the 1895 Home Nations Championship, alongside Selwyn Biggs, in a loss to Scotland. He was reunited with Biggs in 1896, this time in a win over Scotland. His final game was the last game of the 1896 tournament away to Ireland. On this occasion he was partnered with new cap Llewellyn Lloyd, who would become a strong player for Wales and a groundbreaking captain for Newport. =International matches played= WalesSmith (1980), pg 470. * 1893, 1894 * 1893, 1894, 1896 * 1893, 1894, 1895, 1896 External links * Newport RFC player profiles Bibliography  References 1869 births 1953 deaths Welsh rugby union players Wales international rugby union players Rugby union scrum-halves Newport RFC players Welsh male bowls players People from Cwmbran ","title":"Fred Parfitt"},{"id":"21315896","text":"Croom is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Prince George's County, Maryland, United States.

History Sippar-Amnanum was the sister city (or suburb in some eyes) of Sippar. Little is known of its history, if any, before the Old Babylonian period The chief deity of Sippar- Amnanum was Annunitum (or Anunit) a warlike aspect of Ishtar favored by the Akkadians. She is the daughter of Enlil. According to the Cylinder of Nabonidus the temple Eulmash of Anunitu (Amnanum) was rebuilt by that Neo- Babylonian king. The cylinder also reports that the temple had earlier been built by Shagarakti-Shuriash, a king of the Kassite dynasty of Babylon. Presumably the temple had been destroyed in the interim by Shutruk-Nakhkhunte of Elam when he destroyed Sippar. Note that there is some confusion on the city's name since Sinkashid, a king of Uruk, refers to himself in an inscription as \\"King of the Amnanum\\", where Amnanum is thought to be a tribal group. Archaeology The site of Tell ed-Der, along with Sippar, was excavated by Hormuzd Rassam in the early 1880s. Most of the tablets ended up in the British Museum. As was often the case in the early days of archaeology, excavation records were not made, particularly find spots. This makes it difficult to tell which tablets came from Sippar-Amnanum as opposed to Sippar.Anne Goddeeris, Economy and Society in Northern Babylonia in the Early Old Babylonian Period, Peeters Publishers, 2002, More Tell ed-Der tablets were purchased from locals by E. A. Wallis Budge while he was in the region after brief attempts to dig there. Since the site is relatively close to Baghdad, it was a popular target for illegal excavations.E. A. Budge, By Nile and Tigris: A Narrative of Journeys in Egypt and Mesopotamia on Behalf of the British Museum Between the Years 1886 and 1913, John Murray, 1920 More recently, Tell ed-Der was excavated between 1970 and 1985 by the Belgian Archaeological Expedition to Iraq.

Two express routes run through this line and it is supplemented by a limited route (\\"Direct Line\\") that serves only certain stops. It is part of Curitiba's Rede Integrada de Transporte transportation system. } History In 1974 the first express route began operations, linking Santa C√¢ndida in north side Curitiba to Generoso Marques Square, in downtown.A Hist√≥ria do Transporte Coletivo de Curitiba A dedicated bus lane was built for this route, with bus stops 400 meters (1/4 mile) apart from each other. Special amenities, such as newsstands, payphones, maps and exclusive bus shelters were introduced to each bus stop. 20 buses operated the line when it first opened and they had their own color-scheme, so people would recognize them as being express buses, rather than local. Nowadays, red is still the color for the express buses, the same way it was when they were first introduced. Throughout the years, the line was extended (first to Port√£o Transit Center and later to Cap√£o Raso and Pinheirinho transit centers) and received upgrades, like articulated buses and \\"tube-stations\\". In the early '90s, the first double-articulated buses (\\"biarticulados\\") were developed in partnership between URBS and Volvo and later started operating on this line. Still in the '90s, a point-to-point route (\\"Direct Line\\" or \\"Linha Direta\\") was introduced, with limited stops and serving only its dedicated tube- stations, linking both ends of the line, Santa C√¢ndida in the north and Pinheirinho in the south. Route description The line, between Santa C√¢ndida and Pinheiro transit centers is long. One express route links Santa C√¢ndida and Cap√£o Raso (route 203) and the other express route (603) connects Pinheirinho to Rui Barbosa Square, in downtown Curitiba. The two routes overlap between Oswaldo Cruz Square station and Cap√£o Raso Transit Center. During peak hours, buses run every 3 minutes on route 203 every 4 minutes on route 603. On weekdays non-peak hours, buses run every 5‚Äì9 minutes on both routes. On weekends, buses run every 9 minutes on route 203 and every 14 minutes on route 603. Double-articulated buses with 5 doors on the right side operate on this route. A \\"Direct Line\\" service (route 204) connects Santa C√¢ndida and Pinheirinho transit centers. It stops in a limited number of stations and transfers to the express routes are available at 5 transit centers (Santa C√¢ndida, Boa Vista, Cabral, Port√£o and Pinheirinho). Other routes connect to 203 at the all tube-stations along the way. Standard size buses with doors on the left side operate on this route. In downtown, Universidade Federal do Paran√° and XV de Novembro street pedestrian mall's east end are accessible from routes 203 (at Esta√ß√£o Central) and 204 (at C√≠rculo Militar), although these stations are about 300m (1/5 mile) apart from each other. Transfer Points Six transit centers are served by the North‚ÄìSouth Trunk Line, which allow riders to connect to other routes for free. Pra√ßa Eufr√°sio Correia station allows free transfer to the East‚ÄìWest Trunk Line, but it is restricted by the direction of travel (i.e. northbound connects only to eastbound buses and westbound buses only connect to southbound and vice versa). Other important RIT routes connect to the North‚ÄìSouth Trunk Line, such as, Interbairros II, the Direct Line Inter 2 (at Cabral, Port√£o and Cap√£o Raso transit centers). Other municipalities in the metro area have routes that are fed directly into this trunk line, like some from Colombo (at Santa C√¢ndida, Cabral and Cap√£o Raso transit centers), Almirante Tamandar√© (at Cabral transit center), Arauc√°ria (at Port√£o, Cap√£o Raso and Pinheirinho transit centers) and Fazenda Rio Grande (at Pinheirinho Transit Center).

He also discusses Stonehenge, which he believes was also a calendar. The archeological site This structure is known by archaeologists as a medicine wheel dated to 3200 BCE (5200 years ago) by careful stratification of known artifact types. Medicine wheels are sited throughout the northern United States and southern Canada, specifically South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. Most medicine wheels follow the basic pattern of having a center of stone, and surrounding that is an outer ring of stones with \\"spokes\\" (lines of rocks) radiating from the center to the four directions (East, South, West, and North). Some medicine wheels have many additional spokes inbetween the cardinal-aligned spokes. Freeman's interpretation Gordon Freeman challenged the conventional interpretation in his book, stating that it is actually a 26 square-kilometer stone calendar that marks the changing seasons better than our modern calendar. Freeman argues that the 28 rays of the medicine wheel show that it is a lunar calendar. Unlike Stonehenge, which is constructed of extremely large stones (megaliths), the Majorville site is constructed of small piles of rocks (cairns) which Freeman says are patterned over an extremely large area. He describes it as a complex, spider-web‚Äêlike pattern of stones extending over an area of about thirty square kilometres. He views the hilltop centrepiece of the site as a sunburst image made of stones. Freeman believed that those rocks and rock piles were \\"highly engineered,\\" and could not be natural. He spent 28 years photographing the site at different times of year and looking for astronomical alignments. Academic reaction It has been noted, however, that the author engages in \\"speculation that treads close to fiction\\", often using conditional phrases \\"such as perhaps, presumably, seems to be, and might have been\\". University of Alberta archaeologist Jack Ives is cautious about accepting Freeman's ideas. He notes that as the area is an ancient glacial moraine \\"[y]ou have to be very careful about what you line up\\". However, he did agree that the radial lines \\"may certainly reflect solstices and equinoxes. How much more sophisticated beyond that has been a subject of debate\\".

History Roberson was born in Bradenton, and attended Manatee Junior College, graduating with his associate degree in 1963. Following this, he attended the Dallas Institute of Mortuary Science, receiving a bachelor's degree in mortuary science in 1965 and graduating as the salutatorian. Returning to Florida, he studied personnel management and business administration at the University of South Florida from 1966 to 1969. Roberson founded his own business, Roberson Funeral Home & Crematory, Inc., in 1976, and continues to serve as the President. From 1998 to 2004, he served as the Chairman of the Florida State Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers. Florida House of Representatives When incumbent State Representative Lindsay M. Harrington was unable to seek re-election in 2004, Roberson ran to succeed him in the Republican primary in the 72nd District, which included parts of Charlotte County, Desoto County, and Lee County, facing Paige Kreegel, Louis Kirschner, and Gary M. Miller. Roberson ended up losing, receiving 29% of the vote to Kreegel's 40%. In 2008, when State Representative Michael J. Grant opted to run for the Florida Senate rather than seeking re- election, Roberson ran in the 71st District, which neighbored the 72nd District and was based in Charlotte County, Lee County, and Sarasota County, to fill the open seat. In the Republican primary, Roberson defeated Christopher Constance and Richard J. Santons, winning with 53% of the vote. In the general election, he faced Democratic nominee Betty Gissendanner, a retired insurance agent, whom he was able to easily defeat, receiving 54% of the vote to her 46%. Running for re-election in 2010, Roberson faced Democrat Andrew Saltman, who criticized Roberson for being \\"old,\\" \\"creepy,\\" and a \\"zombie,\\" arguing that he was \\"mentally more competent, physically more competent than\\" the incumbent.

It is one of twelve games in the Art Style series of video games available for WiiWare and DSiWare. It is a remake of a Japan-only Game Boy Advance video game titled Orbital, released for the bit Generations series of video games. The objective of Orbient is to control a white star which grows larger by absorbing blue stars and collecting smaller gray stars to form orbiting satellites. While the original bit Generations version was met with mixed reactions, The WiiWare version of Orbient was very well-received, holding an average score of 82.3% and 82/100 from GameRankings and Metacritic respectively. Gameplay In Orbient, players control a white star. The game starts with the white star able to take 5 hits before it is destroyed. To make it grow, the player must collide their star with a similar-sized, blue star. Stars smaller than the player's star are gray-colored. Colliding with these stars does not change the white star's size, but if the player positions the white star just right, the gray star will orbit the white star and become a satellite. Red stars are bigger than the white. The white star is able to orbit red stars to help travel through space. Whenever the white star grows large enough, the target star glows orange, and is able to be a satellite; as soon as that happens, a small crescent star appears, and having it successfully orbit the white star will give the player bonus points, (collecting all different crescent stars unlocks new galaxies and are also the goal to complete the game 100%). Colliding with the orange star will take away a hit, but having it orbit the white star will clear the round. The player guides the star by pressing the A and B buttons on the Wii Remote to utilize gravity and anti-gravity, respectively, and attract it towards or repel (also respectively) the gravitational wells of celestial objects. Players must be careful not to crash their star into the red stars or floating objects like asteroids, or be sucked into black holes, which take away a hit (and in the case of black holes, restart the entire stage). =Scoring= At the end of each round, the player gets scored on the number of stars consumed or collected as satellites, bonus points for clearing the stage with a time faster than the set \\"official time\\", and bonus points for collecting the crescent star as a satellite, and adds it to the total. Times or total scores that show in red are new records. Satellites, including the orange and crescent stars, are then converted into extra hits for the next stage. Development Orbient was originally released for the Game Boy Advance as Orbital under the bit Generations label on July 27, 2006 exclusively in Japan. This version was announced on June 1, 2006. Nintendo announced that they would be giving free copies of the games in the series to 700 members of the Club Nintendo website in exchange to feedback on them, though only to people who own a Game Boy Advance or Nintendo DS. Nintendo filed for an ESRB rating for this title in the US. It was later remade for the Wii's WiiWare service in the Art Style series. Both versions were developed and published by Skip Ltd. and Nintendo respectively. Reception Orbient received positive reviews from critics upon release. On Metacritic, the game holds a score of 82/100 based on 11 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" On GameRankings, the game holds a score of 83.17% based on 12 reviews. The bit Generations version of Orbient received mixed scores from Famitsu, receiving a 7/9/6/7 from them. IGN praised the simplicity of the gameplay and the improvements made to the original, and called it \\"an incredibly mellow, relaxing experience\\", yet at the same time \\"one of the most challenging games you'll ever play\\". GameSpot found the physics-based puzzles to be clever, but criticized it for lacking that \\"must-play, addictive appeal\\" and for its lackluster presentation. Eurogamer called it a quietly brilliant game, and called it the most interesting and rewarding of the three WiiWare games released so far. It was nominated for multiple Wii-specific awards from IGN in its 2008 video game awards, including Best Action Game and Most Innovative Design.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 8, 1976, due to its architectural and historic significance. History St. Louis Street Missionary Baptist Church began as a part of Mobile's African Baptist Church, located near the intersection of Springhill Avenue and Ann Street. The congregation was active by 1836, constructed its own building by 1839, and eventually became known as the Stone Street Baptist Church. A rift in this earlier church, over the sponsorship of a statewide missionary program, lead some members to establish what would become the St. Louis Street Missionary Baptist Church. The new congregation initially met near the intersection of Springhill Avenue and Broad Street, but by 1859 they had purchased the property on Dearborn Street. The first pastor for the church was the Reverend Joshua Hawthorn, a white Baptist minister. Hawthorn left in 1860. He was followed by the Reverend Charles Leavens, the congregation's first African American minister. The congregation sent organizers all over the state, with the result of bringing in many new churches and pastors. The congregation built the current building in 1872, with the design by C. L. Hutchinsson, a local architect. The new building was host to the seventh Colored Baptist Convention of Alabama in 1874, a meeting that lead to the formation of Selma University in 1878. The present edifice religious was restored much time after in 1897.

Later the plane took part in some competitions in Poland, without much success, among others it took the 10th place in the 3rd Polish Light Aircraft Contest in 1930. In 1931 during repair, a radial engine Genet was replaced with a radial engine Walter Vega NZ (from PWS-8 aircraft) with a Townend ring. It was used then by an Aviation Club of the PWS factory. In June 1933 the plane was damaged. During repair it was fitted with a straight engine Cirrus III (from broken up PWS-50 aircraft).

These models are linear, sequential models built on an assumption that consumers move through a series of cognitive (thinking) and affective (feeling) stages culminating in a behavioural stage (doing e.g. purchase or trial) stage.Demetrios Vakratsas and Tim Ambler, \\"How Advertising Works: What Do We Really Know?\\" Journal of MarketingVol. 63, No. 1, 1999, pp. 26-43 DOI: 10.2307/1251999 URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1251999 The steps proposed by the AIDA model are as follows:Priyanka, R., \\"AIDA Marketing Communication Model: Stimulating a purchase decision in the minds of the consumers through a linear progression of steps,\\" International Journal of Multidisciplinary Research in Social Management, Vol. 1 , 2013, pp 37-44.E. St Elmo Lewis, Financial Advertising. (The History of Advertising), USA, Levey Brothers, 1908 ::* Attention ‚Äì The consumer becomes aware of a category, product or brand (usually through advertising) :::::::‚Üì ::* Interest ‚Äì The consumer becomes interested by learning about brand benefits & how the brand fits with lifestyle :::::::‚Üì ::* Desire ‚Äì The consumer develops a favorable disposition towards the brand :::::::‚Üì ::* Action ‚Äì The consumer forms a purchase intention, shops around, engages in trial or makes a purchase Some of the contemporary variants of the model replace attention with awareness. The common thread among all hierarchical models is that advertising operates as a stimulus (S) and the purchase decision is a response (R). In other words, the AIDA model is an applied stimulus-response model. A number of hierarchical models can be found in the literature including Lavidge's hierarchy of effects, DAGMAR and variants of AIDA. Hierarchical models have dominated advertising theory,O'Shaughnessy, J., Explaining Buyer Behavior, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1992 and, of these models, the AIDA model is one of the most widely applied.Diehl, D. and Terlutter, R., \\"The Role of Lifestyle and Personality in Explaining Attitude to the Ad,\\" in Branding and Advertising, Flemming Hansen, Lars Bech Christensen (eds), p. 307 As consumers move through the hierarchy of effects they pass through both a cognitive processing stage and an affective processing stage before any action occurs. Thus the hierarchy of effects models all include Cognition (C)- Affect (A)- Behaviour (B) as the core steps in the underlying behavioral sequence.Howard, J.A. Marketing Management, Homewood, Ill. 1963 Some texts refer to this sequence as Learning ‚Üí Feeling ‚Üí Doing or C-A-B (cognitive -affective-behavioral) models. : Cognition (Awareness/learning) ‚Üí Affect (Feeling/ interest/ desire) ‚Üí Behavior (Action e.g. purchase/ trial/ consumption/ usage/ sharing information)Howard, J. A.\\" in: P. E. Earl and S. Kemp (eds.), The Elgar Companion to Consumer Research and Economic Psychology, Cheltenham 1999, pp 310-314. The purchase funnel illustrates the relative number of prospective purchasers over time The basic AIDA model is one of the longest serving hierarchical models, having been in use for more than a century. Using a hierarchical system, such as AIDA, provides the marketer with a detailed understanding of how target audiences change over time, and provides insights as to which types of advertising messages are likely to be more effective at different junctures. Moving from step to step, the total number of prospects diminishes. This phenomenon is sometimes described as a \\"purchase funnel\\". A relatively large number of potential purchasers become aware of a product or brand, then a smaller subset becomes interested, with only a relatively small proportion moving through to the actual purchase. This effect is also known as a \\"customer funnel\\", \\"marketing funnel\\", or \\"sales funnel\\". The model is also used extensively in selling and advertising. According to the original model, \\"the steps to be taken by the seller at each stage are as follows: : Stage I. Secure attention. : Stage II. Hold attention Through Interest. : Stage III. Arouse Desire. : Stage IV. Create Confidence and Belief. : Stage V. Secure Decision and Action. : Stage VI. Create Satisfaction.\\"Kitson, H.S., Manual for the Study of the Psychology of Advertising and Selling, Philadelphia 1920, p. 21 =Criticisms= A major deficiency of the AIDA model and other hierarchical models is the absence of post-purchase effects such as satisfaction, consumption, repeat patronage behaviour and other post-purchase behavioural intentions such as referrals or participating in the preparation of online product reviews.Egan, J., Marketing Communications, London, Thomson Learning, pp 42-43 Other criticisms include the model's reliance on a linear nature, hierarchical sequence. In empirical studies, the model has been found to be a poor predictor of actual consumer behaviour.Bendizlen, M.T., ‚ÄúAdvertising Effects and Effectiveness,‚Äù European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 27, No. 10, pp 19-32. In addition, an extensive review of the literature surrounding advertising effects, carried out by Vakratsas and Ambler found little empirical support for the hierarchical models.Vakratsas, D. and Ambler, T., \\"How Advertising Works: What Do We Really Know?\\" Journal of Marketing, Vol. 63, No. 1 (Jan., 1999), pp. 26-43 DOI: 10.2307/1251999 URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1251999 Another important criticism of the hierarchical models include their reliance on the concept of a linear, hierarchical response process.Huey, B., \\"Advertising's Double Helix: A Proposed New Process Model\\" Journal of Advertising Research, May/June, 1999, pp 43-51; Belch, G. E. and Belch, M.A., \\"Evaluating The Effectiveness of Elements of Integrated Marketing Communications: A Review of Research,\\" Occasional Paper, Indeed, some research suggests that consumers process promotional information via dual pathways, namely both cognitive (thinking) and affective (feeling) simultaneously.Yoon,K., Laczniak, R.N., Muehling, D.D. and Reece, B.B., \\"A Revised Model of Advertising Processing: Extending the Dual Mediation Hypothesis,\\" Journal of Current Issues & Research in Advertising, Vol. 17, no. 2, 1995, pp 53-67 This insight has led to the development of a class of alternative models, known as integrative models.Yoon,K., Laczniak, R.N., Muehling, D.D. and Reece, B.B., \\"A Revised Model of Advertising Processing: Extending the Dual Mediation Hypothesis,\\" Journal of Current Issues & Research in Advertising, Vol. 17, no. 2, 1995, pp 53-67 =Variants = In order to redress some of the model's deficiencies, a number of contemporary hierarchical models have modified or expanded the basic AIDA model.

However, all follow the basic sequence which includes Cognition- Affect- Behaviour.Barry, T.E., \\"The Development of the Hierarchy of Effects: An Historical Perspective,\\" Current Issues and Research in Advertising, vol. 10, no. 2, 1987, pp. 251‚Äì295 Selected variants of AIDA: :: Basic AIDA Model: Awareness ‚Üí Interest ‚Üí Desire ‚Üí ActionPriyanka, R., \\"AIDA Marketing Communication Model: Stimulating a Purchase Decision in the Minds of the Consumers through a Linear Progression of Steps,\\" International Journal of Multidisciplinary Research in Social Management, Vol. 1 , 2013, pp 37-44. :: Lavidge et al's Hierarchy of Effects: Awareness ‚Üí Knowledge ‚Üí Liking ‚Üí Preference ‚Üí Conviction ‚Üí PurchaseLavidge,R.J. and Steiner, G.A., \\"A Model for Predictive Measures of Advertising Effectiveness,\\" Journal of Marketing, October, 1961, pp 59-62 :: McGuire's model: Presentation ‚Üí Attention ‚Üí Comprehension ‚Üí Yielding ‚Üí Retention ‚Üí Behavior.McGuire, W. \\"An Information Processing Model of Advertising Effectiveness,\\" in Behavioral and Management Science in Marketing, Harry L.

St. Elmo Lewis.Barry, T.E. ,The development of the hierarchy of effects: an historical perspective, USA, 1987 In one of his publications on advertising, Lewis postulated at least three principles to which an advertisement should conform: According to F. G. Coolsen, \\"Lewis developed his discussion of copy principles on the formula that good copy should attract attention, awaken interest, and create conviction.\\"\\"Pioneers in the Development of Advertising,\\" Journal of Marketing 12(1), 1947, p. 82 In fact, the formula with three steps appeared anonymously in the February 9, 1898, issue of Printers' Ink: \\"The mission of an advertisement is to sell goods. To do this, it must attract attention, of course; but attracting attention is only an auxiliary detail. The announcement should contain matter which will interest and convince after the attention has been attracted\\" (p. 50). On January 6, 1910 Lewis gave a talk in Rochester on the topic \\"Is there a science back of advertising?\\" in which he said: The importance of attracting the attention of the reader as the first step in copy writing was recognized early in the advertising literature as is shown by the Handbook for Advertisers and Guide to Advertising: A precursor to Lewis was Joseph Addison Richards (1859‚Äì1928), an advertising agent from New York City who succeeded his father in the direction of one of the oldest advertising agencies in the United States. In 1893, Richards wrote an advertisement for his business containing virtually all steps from the AIDA model, but without hierarchically ordering the individual elements: Between December 1899 and February 1900, the Bissell Carpet Sweeper Company organized a contest for the best written advertisement. Fred Macey, chairman of the Fred Macey Co. in Grand Rapids (Michigan), who was considered an advertising expert at that time, was assigned the task to examine the submissions to the company. In arriving at a decision, he considered inter alia each advertisement in the following respect: The first published instance of the general concept, however, was in an article by Frank Hutchinson Dukesmith (1866‚Äì1935) in 1904. Dukesmith's four steps were attention, interest, desire, and conviction.\\"Three Natural Fields of Salesmanship,\\" Salesmanship 2(1), January 1904, p. 14. The first instance of the AIDA acronym was in an article by C. P. Russell in 1921 where he wrote: The model's usefulness was not confined solely to advertising. The basic principles of the AIDA model were widely adopted by sales representatives who used the steps to prepare effective sales presentations following the publication, in 1911, of Arthur Sheldon's book, Successful Selling.Sheldon, A., Successful Selling, (Part 1), USA, Kessinger Publishing [Rare Reprint Series], 1911 To the original model, Sheldon added satisfaction to stress the importance of repeat patronage. AIDA is a linchpin of the Promotional part of the 4Ps of the Marketing mix, the mix itself being a key component of the model connecting customer needs through the organisation to the marketing decisions. Theoretical developments in hierarchy of effects models The marketing and advertising literature has spawned a number of hierarchical models.Diehl, D. and Terlutter, R., \\"The Role of Lifestyle and Personality in Explaining Attitude to the Ad,\\" in Branding and Advertising, Flemming Hansen, Lars Bech Christensen (eds), p. 307 In a survey of more than 250 papers, Vakratsas and Ambler (1999) found little empirical support for any of the hierarchies of effects.Demetrios Vakratsas and Tim Ambler, \\"How Advertising Works: What Do We Really Know?\\" Journal of Marketing, Vol. 63, No. 1, 1999, pp. 26-43, DOI: 10.2307/1251999 URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1251999 In spite of that criticism, some authors have argued that hierarchical models continue to dominate theory, especially in the area of marketing communications and advertising.O‚ÄôShaughnessy, J., Explaining Buyer Behavior, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1992 All hierarchy of effects models exhibit several common characteristics. Firstly, they are all linear, sequential models built on an assumption that consumers move through a series of steps or stages involving cognitive, affective and behavioral responses that culminate in a purchase.Egan, J., Marketing Communications, London, Thomson Learning, pp 42-43 Secondly, all hierarchy of effects models can be reduced to three broad stages - Cognitive‚Üí Affective (emotions)‚ÜíBehavioral (CAB).Barry, T.E., \\"The Development of the Hierarchy of Effects: An Historical Perspective,\\" Current Issues and Research in Advertising vol. 10, no. 2, 1987, pp. 251‚Äì295 Three broad stages implicit in all hierarchy of effects models:J. A. Howard, Marketing Management, Homewood 1963; cf. M. B. Holbrook, \\"Howard, John A.\\" in: P. E. Earl, S. Kemp (eds.), The Elgar Companion to Consumer Research and Economic Psychology, Cheltenham 1999, pp 310-314. * Cognition (Awareness or learning) :::::::‚Üì * Affect (Feeling, interest or desire) :::::::‚Üì * Behavior (Action) Recent modifications of the AIDA model have expanded the number of steps.Barry, T.E., \\"The Development of the Hierarchy of Effects: An Historical Perspective,\\" Current Issues and Research in Advertising Vol. 10, no. 2, 1987, pp. 251‚Äì295. Some of these modifications have been designed to accommodate theoretical developments, by including customer satisfaction (e.g. the AIDAS model)Barry, T.E. and Howard, D.J., \\"A Review and Critique of the Hierarchy of Effects in Advertising,\\" International Journal of Advertising, Vol. 9, no. 2, 1990, pp 121-135 while other alternative models seek to accommodate changes in the external environment such as the rise of social media (e.g. the AISDALSLove model).Wijaya, Bambang Sukma (2012). ‚ÄúThe Development of Hierarchy of Effects Model in Advertising‚Äù, International Research Journal of Business Studies, Vol. 5, no 1, 2012, pp 73-85 In the AISDALSLove model,Wijaya, Bambang Sukma (2012). \\"The Development of Hierarchy of Effects Model in Advertising\\", International Research Journal of Business Studies, 5 (1), April‚ÄìJuly 2012, p. 73-85 new phases are 'Search' (after Interest), the phase when consumers actively searching information about brand/ product, 'Like/dislike' (after Action) as one of elements in the post-purchase phase, then continued with 'Share' (consumers will share their experiences about brand to other consumers) and the last is 'Love/hate' (a deep feeling towards branded product, that can become the long-term effect of advertising) which new elements such as Search, Like/dislike (evaluation), Share and Love/hate as long-term effects have also been added. Finally, S ‚Äì 'Satisfaction' ‚Äì is added to suggest the likelihood that a customer might become a repeat customer, provide positive referrals or engage in other brand advocacy behaviors following purchase. Other theorists, including Christian Betancur (2014)Christian Betancur, El vendedor Halc√≥n: sus estrategias. El poder de la venta consultiva para ganar m√°s clientes satisfechos, Medell√≠n, Colombia, 2nd ed., 2014, ICONTEC International, www.elvendedorhalcon.com and Rossiter and Percy (1985)Rossiter, J.R. and Percy, L.,\\"Advertising Communication Models\\", in: Advances in Consumer Research, Volume 12, Elizabeth C. Hirschman and Moris B. Holbrook (eds), Provo, UT : Association for Consumer Research, 1985, pp 510-524., Online: http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/6443/volumes/v12/NA-12 or http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=6443 have proposed that need recognition should be included as the initial stage of any hierarchical model. Betancur, for example, has proposed a more complete process: NAITDASE model (in Spanish: NAICDASE). Betancur's model begins with the identification of a Need (the consumer's perception of an opportunity or a problem). Following the Attention and Interest stages, consumers form feelings of Trust (i.e., Confidence). Without trust, customers are unlikely to move forward towards the Desire and Action stages of the process. Purchase is not the end stage in this model, as this is not the goal of the client; therefore, the final two stages are the Satisfaction of previously identified and agreed needs and the Evaluation by the customer about the whole process. If positive, it will repurchase and recommend to others (Customer's loyalty). In Betancur's model, trust is a key element in the purchase process, and must be achieved through important elements including: # Business and personal image (including superior brand support). # Empathy with this customer. # Professionalism (knowledge of the product and master of the whole process from the point of view of the customer). # Ethics without exceptions. # Competitive Superiority (to solve the needs and requirements of this customer). # Commitment during the process and toward the customer satisfaction. Trust (or Confidence) is the glue that bonds society and makes solid and reliable relations of each one other. Cultural references In the film Glengarry Glen Ross by David Mamet, the character Blake (played by Alec Baldwin) makes a speech where the AIDA model is visible on a chalkboard in the scene. A minor difference between the fictional account of the model and the model as it is commonly used is that the \\"A\\" in Blake's motivational talk is defined as attention rather than awareness and the \\"D\\" as decision rather than desire. The song 7 Rings by Ariana Grande includes the line \\"I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it.\\" Though this is consistent with the AIDA framework, there is not evidence to suggest this was a deliberate reference.

Williams is also in favor of reducing the power of local government to establish impact fees related to development. In February 2009, as chair of the House Agriculture and Natural Resources Policy Committee, Representative Williams initiated a legislative effort to deregulate land development. Her proposals to make permits easier to get, and to require officials to issue permits in less time than allowed under existing law, have drawn support from Associated Industries of Florida, the Florida Home Builders Association, and the Florida Association of Community Developers.

Initially its membership was restricted only for Bulgarians. It was active not only in Macedonia but also in Thrace (the Vilayet of Adrianople). Since its early name emphasized the Bulgarian nature of the organization by linking the inhabitants of Thrace and Macedonia to Bulgaria, these facts are still difficult to be explained from the Macedonian historiography. They suggest that IMRO revolutionaries in the Ottoman period did not differentiate between ‚ÄòMacedonians‚Äô and ‚ÄòBulgarians‚Äô.

Between January 1902 and March 1903 he was re-imprisoned in the Bitola jail. He actively took part in the Ilinden Uprising in 1903. After the Bulgarian Army officer Toma Davidov was killed by the Turks in March 1903, Uzunov took over the leadership of the revolutionary organization in Ohrid area.–ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–æ–≤, –ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å –ô. –í—ä—Ç—Ä–µ—à–Ω–∞ –º–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–æ-–æ–¥—Ä–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞ —Ä–µ–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω–∞ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—è. –í–æ–π–≤–æ–¥–∏ –∏ —Ä—ä–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏ (1893 ‚Äì 1934). –ë–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–Ω–æ-–±–∏–±–ª–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ—Å–∫–∏ —Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 2001, —Å—Ç—Ä. 40.

She was the largest vessel ever built on freshwater at that time. She sailed the Great Lakes for twenty-two years until she sank after a collision in 1920 with the steamer Willis L. King in Whitefish Bay of Lake Superior that resulted in the loss of 29 lives. Controversy was immediate over the collision. It was subsequently ruled that the captains of both ships failed to follow the ‚Äúrules-of-the-road‚Äù. Controversy started again in 1988 when the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society produced a video called \\"Graveyard of the Great Lakes\\" that included extensive footage of the skeletons of the Superior City crew. The controversy continued as late as 1996 over artifacts removed from her wreck. She is now a protected shipwreck in the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve. History The Superior City launched 13 April 1898 in the yards of the Cleveland Ship Building Company (later named the American Ship Building Company) at Lorain, Ohio.Bowen, Dana Thomas, (1940, 1975,. Lore of the Great Lakes, pp. 223, 226 ‚Äì 227., Freshwater Press, Cleveland, Ohio, USA. LCCN 40-33309. The Superior City was a pioneer vessel representing the steady progression of bigger, longer, and stronger craft from the days of ships powered by sails.Havighurst, Walter, (1942, 1975). The Longs Ships Passing: The story of the Great Lakes, p. 221. MacMillan Publishing, Inc., New York, New York, USA. . At her launching, she was the largest vessel ever built on freshwater. The whole town of Lorain crowded the river front to watch her launch. On April 26, 1909, Dr. Griffin, the local health officer at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan received reports that boats tied up at the Soo Locks had been quarantined and a couple of the lockmen said that they heard that the Superior City had displayed a smallpox sign for a few hours on the previous night. Dr. Griffin boarded the Superior City and had a heated conference in which everyone denied any knowledge of a smallpox sign. Dr. Griffin issued a warning that any misuse of a contagious disease sign would be immediately reported to the Michigan Secretary of State. Shipwreck historian Wes Oleszewski reported, \\"In the ensuing days, there were far fewer uninvited guests aboard any of the boats tied up at the Soo Locks, especially the Superior City.\\" Oleszewsik, Wes, (1993). Ice Water Museum, pp. 21 -22, Avery Color Studios, Marquette, Michigan, USA. . The Superior City sailed the lakes for twenty-two years before she came to an untimely end in the worst collision ever occurring on Lake Superior.Stonehouse, Frederick (1973). The Great Wrecks of the Great lake: A directory of the shipwrecks of Lake Superior, p. 110. The Book Concern, Printers, Hancock, Michigan, USA. LCCN 73-75623. Collision At 9:10 PM on 20 August 1920, the steamers Superior City and Willis L. King collided in Whitefish Bay on Lake Superior. The Superior City was downbound and heavy with 7600 tons of iron ore loaded at Two Harbors, Minnesota. The steamer Willis L. King was upbound and light after unloading ore at Ashtabula, Ohio. Maritime historian Boyer wrote that the Superior City was, \\"[R]ammed on her port side, aft of midships ‚Ä¶ [causing] ‚Ä¶ a tremendous explosion when the terrible inrushing wall of cold water burst her aft bulkheads and hit the boilers. The vessel‚Äôs stern was literally blown off‚Ä¶. [and she] was nearly halved in the collision.\\" Boyer, Dwight (1977). Ships and Men of the Great Lakes, pp. 103 ‚Äì 104. Freshwater Press, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio, USA. . Immediately following the collision, the crew was struggling to lower the lifeboats that were located over the boilers and this concentrated them precisely over the explosion, resulting in the loss of life of most of the crew.Wolff, Julius F. (1979). The Shipwrecks of Lake Superior, p. 1920. Lake Superior Marine Museum Association, Inc., Duluth, Minnesota, USA. . Casualties and survivors The Superior City sank rapidly with the loss of lives of 28 men and one woman, the worst loss of life in the history of the Pittsburg Steamship Company. Of the four survivors, Captain Sawyer, second mate G.G. Lehnt, and watchman Peter Jacobsen were forward and jumped for their lives. Captain Sawyer was found clinging to a life preserver that he never had time to put on. Second mate Lehnt was found clinging to the bottom of a capsized lifeboat. Watchman Jacobson fought his way back to the surface after being dragged down with the ship and swam for about 20 minutes until the King's lifeboat picked him up. Boatswain Walter Richter was sleeping in his bunk wearing only long underwear when alarm bells sounded. When he raced to the deck, the explosion blew him overboard, blowing off his underwear. The steamer J.J. Turner picked him up clinging to a hatch cover that he rode as a raft. Crewmembers on the Turner reported that wooden ports in the interior of the ship had been blown through her steel sides. Most of the crewmembers were likely blown to pieces by the boiler explosion or were trapped in the suction of the powerful whirlpool when the Superior City sank. No bodies were ever recovered. , 76-77. Investigation The vessels sighted each other about ten minutes before the collision and exchanged steam whistle signals. Captain Sawyer of the Superior City and Captain Nelson of the Willis L. King offered conflicting statements about the weather and the whistle signals prior to the collision. Captain Sawyer said that the weather was clear at the time of the accident while Captain Nelson said that the night had been foggy and hazy. Captain Sawyer maintained that the two vessels exchanged one blast signals indicating the conventional port-to-port passing signal. Captain Nelson asserted that the vessels exchanged two blast signals for a starboard-to- starboard passing. At the time impact, the Superior City was swinging across the King's bow while Captain Nelson swung his bow hard aport and rang the telegraph to stop and then full astern. The estimated speed at the time of impact was per hour for the King, and per hour for the Superior City. The accident was investigated by U.S. Steamboat Inspectors Gooding and Hanson of Marquette, Michigan. After their initial statements, both captains communicated only in depositions to the proctors-in-admiralty representatives of the owners of the vessels. Officers and crew of the nearby J.J. Turner and the Midvale witnessed the collision and heard the exchange of passing signals. It was determined that although very early in the night there had been haze and some fog, at the time of the collision the night was crystal clear with unlimited visibility. When the Willis L. King made to the Superior Shipbuilding Company‚Äôs drydock for repairs of a twisted, broken stern, seventeen shell plates and frames destroyed, interior forward decks buckled, and numerous angles and stringers that required replacement, Captain Nelson ordered that no member of the crew was to discuss the accident with anyone but representatives of the vessel‚Äôs owner or agents. Rulings After many months of investigation and litigation, United States District Court, the Western District of Wisconsin Judge C. Z. Luce ruled that both masters were guilty of failing to follow the ‚ÄúRules of the Road‚Äù regulations that if there is doubt about the course or intention of the other, the pilot is required give the danger signal and slow to a speed barely sufficient for passageway and/or stop and reverse course. After more haggling by underwriters and proctors, the Superior City was valued at $300,000 and her tonnage was valued at $42,922.95. The King's damage was $42,520. The loss-of-life claims were not paid until late in 1923. The lawyers of victim‚Äôs estates had little muscle against the legal maneuverings of the admiralty proctors and they settled for $5000 to the families of deckhands and porters, $3,700 for the wife of the second engineer, $11,205 for the second engineer, and $25,000 for the chief engineer. Wreck controversy The wreck of the Superior City was initially discovered in 1972 by diver John Steele. The wreck was rediscovered in 1980 by Tom Farnquist and Gary Shumbarger of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society who extensively photographed the wreck.Stonehouse, Frederick (1985, 1998). Lake Superior's Shipwreck Coast: Maritime accidents from Whitefish Bay to Grand Marais, Michigan, p. 18, Avery Color Studios, Gwinn, Michigan, USA. . The Shipwreck Society produced a video in 1988 about the wreck of the Superior City called \\"Graveyard of the Great Lakes\\" that showed extensive footage of skeletons of the crew and the removal of a wedding ring from a skeleton. The Shipwreck Society still claims accolades for the \\"Graveyard of the Great Lakes\\" video but they no longer sell it to the public. The Evening News reported a Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment raid on the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum and its offices that found evidence of 150 artifacts illegally removed from the state-claimed bottomlands. Artifacts from the Superior City and other shipwrecks are on display at the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum as a loan from the state following a 1993 settlement agreement with the Michigan Department of State and Department of Natural Resources.Storey, Jack, (4 December 1992). ‚ÄúShipwreck artifact dispute simmers‚Äù. Evening News, p. A1.Harrington, Steve (1990, 1998). Divers Guide to Michigan, p.320, Maritime Press & Great Lakes Diving Council, Inc., St. Ignace, Michigan, U.S.A. . The controversy surrounding artifacts from the Superior City continued in 1996 over the ownership of her telegraph. The telegraph was on loan to the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. When the owner‚Äôs representative, Great Lakes shipwreck diver Steve Harrington, removed the telegraph from the museum, the museum‚Äôs director, Tom Farnquist, notified the Michigan State Police who held the telegraph until ownership was determined. Both men admitted that the controversy really stemmed from proposed legislation over the photography of dead bodies in Michigan waters that included the wrecks of the Superior City and the SS Edmund Fitzgerald.Brand, Scott, (11 September 1996). ‚ÄúArtifact removal raises debate‚Äù. Evening News, pp. 1, 2. For a number of years the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society used a wedding ring from a skeleton on the Superior City to promote its museum. In a 2000 interview Farnquist likened the identity of the skeleton and the owner of the wedding ring to a shipwreck mystery that may never be solved. The ring and other artifacts from the Superior City are still on display in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. Wreck diving Scuba diving to the Superior City wreck requires advanced technical diving skills as it is among the most dangerous and difficult dives among the many wrecks in Whitefish Bay. Twenty-six-year-old Scott Michael Snow lost his life while exploring the Superior City wreck in 2001. His body was retrieved from the wreck in 230 feet of water by the robotic arm of a remote vehicle.Elmira (AP), (27 June 2001). ‚ÄúDiver surfaced too quickly from shipwreck, authorities say‚Äù.

In Club Dead, Sookie's boyfriend Bill disappears while working on a secret project, and Sookie heads out to Jackson, Mississippi in hopes of retrieving him alive. In this quest, she enlists the aid of a werewolf, Alcide Herveaux, and a vampire Eric. The novel was adapted as the third season of True Blood, the HBO series based on the novels, however with a few notable differences. The season was broadcast from June 13 to September 12, 2010. Plot summary The novel takes place in December. Sookie discovers Bill working secretively on his computer. Bill closes a file but not before Sookie sees the screen. Bill informs Sookie he has to leave to complete a task ordered by the Queen of Louisiana Vampires. Days later, a werewolf targeting Sookie comes into her workplace, Merlotte's, but he is eliminated by Bubba, sent on Eric's orders, before he can harm Sookie. As night falls, Eric and his employees tell Sookie that Bill had actually been in Mississippi, where his former lover and maker Lorena had summoned him. They continue to tell Sookie that Bill has since then gone missing, and Eric speaks of his suspicions on Lorena's involvement. He also states that the vampire queen of Louisiana will need to receive Bill's secret project on its due date, if Eric wishes not to compromise his life. Since Eric is unable to interrogate humans or vampires in the territory of Mississippi vampire king Russell Edgington without provoking a war, he invites Sookie to come along to Mississippi and utilize her telepathy to locate Bill. Sookie agrees, but is shocked at Bill's possible betrayal of her. The next day, Sookie is introduced to Alcide Herveaux, a werewolf sent by Eric to help Sookie circulate in the supernatural community of Jackson, Mississippi. Sookie takes a liking to Alcide's physique and personality. In Jackson, Alcide escorts her to a local vampire bar, Josephine's, generally known as Club Dead. In this club, Sookie learns by telepathy that Bill is being held captive and that Russell Edgington is possibly involved. She meets Edgington when he aids her after a confrontation with a were patron angered at Sookie rebuffing his sexual advances. Edgington insists they come in the next night as well. In the same night, Sookie is confronted by Alcide's jealous ex-girlfriend Debbie Pelt, a shapeshifter who, despite being at her own engagement party, is furious with Sookie presenting herself as Alcide's escort. The next day, Sookie and Alcide discover in their closet the dead body of the Club Dead patron who had been making unwanted advances at Sookie. After disposing of the body, that is later revealed to have been an assailant aiming for Sookie killed by Bubba, the duo head out for another night in Club Dead, where Sookie meets her friend Tara Thornton as another vampire's escort. However, she discovers the Fellowship of the Sun, an anti-vampire organization prominently featured in Living Dead in Dallas, has come in Club Dead intent on killing vampires. While preventing the Fellowship from staking one of Russell Edgington's employees, she herself is staked, then rescued by Eric and taken to the King of Mississippi's compound and receives medical attention at Edgington's mansion. Sookie shares an intimate moment with Eric, but Bubba informs them Bill is being tortured in one of Edgington's poolhouses. At dawn, Sookie heads out to the poolhouse. She frees Bill and manages to stake Lorena as she attacks, but is locked into the trunk of her own car alongside the sleeping Bill when she returns to Alcide's apartment building. When Bill, deprived of blood and sleep for a week, wakes up, he attacks and feeds on Sookie and rapes her in the trunk. Sookie asks Eric to drive her home, fed up with the whole ordeal. While on their way home, two robbers raid a gas station alongside their route looking for Sookie and Eric and in Sookie's home, several werewolves wait for her and attack her. Eric and Bill eliminate all werewolves, but Sookie angrily breaks up with Bill and rescinds both Bill and Eric's invitation to her house. The novel ends with Sookie realizing Bill's special project is inside her house, and no vampire will be physically able to retrieve it. Television adaptation The Southern Vampire Mysteries have been adapted by HBO into a television series called True Blood. The storyline of Club Dead forms the basis of True Blood's third season. Its first episode aired on June 13, 2010. Although the main characters and story lines are the same, there are significant differences between the book and the series, most notably: *In the series, themes and characters from novels following Club Dead are already introduced, such as Sookie's fairy background. *In the book, Tara Thornton is merely an escort to a vampire friend, Franklin Mott. In the series, she is abducted and raped by him, and he is a spy to Russell Edgington investigating Bill's project. *Debbie Pelt is introduced as a werewolf in the series, rather than a shapeshifter. *In the series, Russell Edgington has Bill abducted by werewolves and tries to have him shift his loyalty - he treats him as a guest and orders for his execution, resulting in Lorena torturing him, later on. *Russell Edgington has a main vampire consort in the series. In the novel, vampire relationships are described as unusual and Russell is accompanied by a human consort. *In the series, Lou Pine's is a werewolf/shifter exclusive bar, rather than a vampire bar that accustomed to all of the supernatural community.

It is a structured as a semantic wiki, using Semantic MediaWiki. NeuroLex is supported by the Neuroscience Information Framework project.  Overview  The NeuroLex is intended to help improve the way that neuroscientists communicate about their data, so that information systems like the NIF can find data more easily and provide more powerful means of integrating data that occur across distributed resources. One of the big roadblocks to data integration in neuroscience is the inconsistent use of terminology in databases and other resources like the literature. When one uses the same terms to mean different things, one cannot easily ask questions that span across multiple resources. For example, if three databases have information about what genes are expressed in cortex, but they all use different definitions of cerebral cortex, then one cannot compare them easily.  Utilization within the Neuroscience Information Framework  The NIF enables discovery and access to public research data and tools worldwide through an open source, networked environment. Funded by the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research,The NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research is a cooperative effort among the 16 NIH Institutes, Centers and Offices that support neuroscience research. By pooling resources and expertise, the Blueprint supports the development of new tools, training opportunities, and other resources to assist neuroscientists in both basic and clinical research. Read more about the Blueprint . the NIF enables scientists and students to discover global neuroscience web resources that cut across traditional boundaries ‚Äì from experimental, clinical and translational neuroscience databases, to knowledge bases, atlases, and genetic/genomic resources. Unlike general search engines, NIF provides deeper access to a more focused set of resources that are relevant to neuroscience, search strategies tailored to neuroscience, and access to content that is traditionally ‚Äúhidden‚Äù from web search engines. The Framework is a dynamic inventory of neuroscience databases, annotated and integrated with a unified system of biomedical terminology (i.e. NeuroLex). NIF supports concept-based queries across multiple scales of biological structure and multiple levels of biological function, making it easier to search for and understand the results. As part of the NIF, a search interface to many different sources of neuroscience information and data is provided. To make this search more effective, the NIF is constructing ontologies to help organize neuroscience concepts into category hierarchies, e.g. stating that a neuron is a cell. This allows users to perform more effective searches and also to organize and understand the information that is returned. But an important adjunct to this activity is to clearly define all of the terms that are used to describe data, e.g., anatomical terms, techniques, organism names.  Content  The initial entries in the NeuroLex were built from the NIFSTD ontologies which subsumed an earlier vocabulary BIRNLex. It currently contains concepts that span gross anatomy, cells of the nervous system, subcellular structures, diseases, functions and techniques. NIF is soliciting community input to add more content and correct what is there.

In 1970, it was merged with the communes of Ascq and Flers-lez-Lille to form the new commune of Villeneuve d'Ascq.INSEE It is still a district of the commune today.  Etymology of the name  The origin of the name Annappes is very turbid. Theodore Leuridan :fr:Th√©odore Leuridan, in a historical note on Annappes, considers several solutions * asnapis formed of the radical goth ap, ahva = water (aqua in Latin) * word meaning into Celtic \\"with a curve of rivi√®re\\" * contraction of \\"AD Menapios\\": Annappes was located at the end of the territory of Nerviens towards the country of M√©napiens. Dauzat and Rostaing, in the Etymological dictionary of the place names in France, think that the name comes from Germanic the hanap, hemp. History=Origins= In 1980, a fragment of polished flint axe was found in the park of the current Saint-Adrien School. It is estimated to date from approximately 2000 BC. Other axes of this kind were discovered in the area of Lille, in particular in the alluvia of De√ªle. The historians allot them to populations using cut stone tools, but already devoted to cattle breeding and agriculture. However, it is no proof that man was sedentary there; indeed archaeologists have now found traces of human occupation at the end of the independent Gallic era, in particular of sling stones, on the level of the Center Marc-Sautelet. However, it is probable, that this place was not a place of residence, but simply one of the folds in the forest (as described by Julius Caesar), where the Gallic people of the area took refuge from the Roman legions. =The royal field of Asnapio=Age of Charlemagne Annappes and its surroundings are with the Middle Ages the site of a royal field, as indicated on a text from the reign of Charlemagne. He must certainly have passed by the field of Asnapio to go to inaugurate the battle of Saint-Riquier in the year 800. At the time of the arrival of Charlemagne for the inauguration of the battle of Saint-Riquier in 800, his royal envoys drew up an inventory at Annappes. The description was so meticulous, that it was recopied as an example, in a handbook of management of the imperial farms, the Capitulary of Villis. Asnapio (its name at the time) was a very rich Carolingian field. About a hundred people lived there in the farm, surrounded by orchards. The peasants cultivated cereals on M√©lantois. The outputs were raised enough, and five mills and four breweries, which manufactured the barley beer of the tenants, were installed close to the Mark river. The field had been built close to the marshes, and Asnapio was also a stud farm, which supplied the imperial cavalry. Here the composition of its livestock in 799: *51 mares, 3 standards, 10 foals, 2 asses, *16 oxen, 50 cows having calved, 20 heifers, 3 bulls, 38 calves, *260 pigs, 100 piglets, 5 boars, *150 ewe, 120 sheep, 200 lambs, *30 goats, 3 goats, 30 kids; 30 geese, 80 chickens, 22 peacocks. In 836, emperor Louis the Pious gave the royal field to his daughter Gisele, wife of Eberhard of Friuli. This noble couple founded the abbey of Cysoing. The first marquis Berenger, one of their sons, inherited Annappes; he was the King of Lombards thereafter, and then Emperor of the Romans. Viking Age The royal field described at the time of Charlemagne was much the same at time of the invasion of the continent by the Vikings. In 881, the Norman plunder of their camp of Courtrai, its field; Annappes, and no text mentions it any more. =Comt√© of Flanders= During the 10th century, the count de Flander, installed with Lille, and monopolized the territory of Annappes. All the villagers from then on were subject to the authority of Counts of Comtal. The count appointed a mayor, an officer comtal, to manage the fields, Annappes. In 1066, Baudouin V of Flanders gives, by the charter of equipment Saint-Pierre of Lille, two-thirds of the incomes of the church of Annappes. However, it is not known, if there is a bond between this church and the current church Saint-Sebastien of Annappes. At that time, Annappes maintains the close relationships with its neighbors, the villages of Ascq and of Flers-lez-Lille. The count Baudouin IX demolished part of this field of the town hall of Annappes, to build a stronghold to Gilbert de Bourghelles. About 1200 he creates its manor, the strong house of Quiquempois. Gilbert, married with the widow of the lord of the manor of Lille, provides this military function at the beginning of the 13th century. At the time of the departure of the count for the crusades, Gilbert de Bourghelles, lord of Quiquempois is one of the four baillif-procurateurs of the county of Flanders. After the disappearance of Baudouin IX, who become emperor of Constantinople, in 1205, the lord of Quiquempois plays an eminent role, near the heiresses of the county. In 1214, it is he, who advises the new count de Flanders, Ferrand of Portugal. The alliance with Jean sans Terre, and Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor, will be fatal for him, at the time of Battle of Bouvines, on 27 July 1214. The count equips the religious establishments with some of his grounds. For example, the hospital Saint-Saver, which has a large farm with corn with Annappes in the 13th century. It is at that time that Preudhomme, middle-class inhabitant of Lille, recovers the town hall comtale of Annappes, and that the √©chevinage (municipal council) is given the responsibility to define payments common to the three villages of Annappes, Ascq, and Flers-lez-Lille. Although the territory is rich, the country population is very precarious, and must undergo several famines, from the 14th to the 15th centuries. In particular there was famine during the year 1316, following bad harvests the year before. Another misfortune, that cuts down on the area, is the war of 1297 and 1304, when French troops of Philip IV of France and those of Flemings devastate the cultures and burn the village. In 1340, at the beginning of the Hundred Years' War, the village is militarily occupied. In 1349, it is the black death, which cuts down on the area, and the population of Annappes decreases considerably. During the 14th century, the economy of the village is growing gently, in spite of the periodic plagues, bad harvests, and the almost constant presence of soldiers. After being burned by the troops of Louis XI, the church is rebuilt. The oldest parts of the church of Annappes go back to that time. =The Burgundians= In 1369, the county of Flanders was attached to Duchy of Burgundy after the marriage of Marguerite III, Countess of Flanders, and Philip the Bold, duke of Burgundy. The population started to grow again very quickly, even if Annappes remains smaller than Ascq, and Flers-lez-Lille. In 1449, tax investigations counted 78 inhabitants within Annappes. After the confrontations between Charles the Bold of Burgundy and Louis XI of France in 1498, the population was 410 inhabitants. In 1505, 500 people lived in the village, and the livestock was 34 horses, 20 foals, 284 cows, 408 sheep. In 1477, when the last duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold died, the title passed to Mary of Burgundy wife of Habsburg Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, who then took the title of count of Flanders. At the end of the reign of the Germanic Roman Emperor Charles V, Spanish Flanders fell to his oldest son. Annappes thus passes under the supervision of Philip II, king of Spain and remained under Spanish authority until the reign of Philip IV of Spain. In 1605 The archdukes create the county of Annapes for don Juan de Robl√®s. =Starting in France= In 1667, Louis XIV reached Lille and took the city. In 1668, Annappes then became a French village by the treaty of Aachen. The village was constantly beset by the effects of the war: housing the troops, requisition of all kinds, devastation, and exaction of the soldiers. From 1708 until 1713, the area was occupied by the Britannico-Dutchmen of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, who returned in 1744. In 1737, the priest of Annappes supported a lengthy lawsuit to obtain the catch of load of a vicar by the Saint-Pierre chapter. Thanks to him, it is known that the cantons of Marchenelles, Hempempont, and the Collection were called small Hollande because the inhabitants very seldom attended church. The same year, one index of Annappes, shows 180 households and 1021 inhabitants. In 1774, the king allowed the division of the marshes between the three villages and their neighbours, which were drained in 1781. The elimination of illiteracy progressed: between 1737 and 1789, 50% of the men and 32% of the women could sign their marriage certificate in Annappes. Cultural life also developed, with ducasse (a traditional village festival), twice a year in the village. People also celebrated Midsummer's Day, Saint Martin's day and Saint-√âloi. In Annappes, as in Flers-lez-Lille, shooting contests were organized. =R√©volution and Napoleonic Wars= As in Lille, there is not a popular revolution by the peasants in 1789. The peasants are occupied with the distribution of their communal marsh. In January 1790, Jean-Baptiste Fancy is elected mayor of Annappes. A. Boussemart will succeed him. In April 1792, at the time of the declaration of war against Austria, the regiments gather between Lille and Baisieux, to be directed towards the enemy. But with the approach of the enemy near Baisieux, as of the first cannonades, they beat a retreat towards Lille, where the crowd killed the general Th√©obald Dillon, believing him to be guilty of collusion with the Austrians. Austrians directed by Prince Albert of Saxony, Duke of Teschen occupy the area after having taken Roubaix, Tourcoing and Lannoy. However, they raise the Siege of Lille on 8 October, vis-a-vis the impossibility of seizing the city. The Mark River separated the republican troops stationed in Flers, Annappes and Ascq, and the Austrians at the end of 1792 until the beginning of 1794. The coalition formed against France invaded the village in 1794, but the victory in the Battle of Tourcoing, on 18 May 1794, push back the enemy. Under the Reign of Terror, the goods of the emigrants are confiscated. In the same way, silverware and objects of worship of Saint-Sebastien church are inventoried, sent to Lille and are recovered by the State. The church will even be sold on 29 September 1798 with the bidding at the same time as those of Ascq and of Flers-lez- Lille, but will not be demolished. After a Legal settlement, it will be taken again by the monks. From 1800, the mayors are named by prefect. The first will be P.J. Mahieu for Annappes. =Nineteenth century= Annappes remained primarily artisanal and agricultural during the 19th century . Great landowners remained with the authority of the borough, like the baron of Worsen Romain Joseph baron de Brigode - deputy of Northern (department) during 19 years between 1805 and 1837 and mayor of the commune from 1814 until 1848, and his friends De Clercy, and the Count de Montalembert, who dominated the village. Still at that time, the villages suffer from the epidemics and difficult work conditions (Sunday rest not respected, enforced child labor). Annappes remained very rural, and was slow to accept progress. The motorists of Annappes are seen being advised in 1903 to yield to horses. In 1875, Louis Spriet, a farmer from Annappes, decided to develop the family business and built in 1876 an agricultural distilling of grains. Its successor, another farmer (of Bouvines), who became owner of the building in 1898, transformed the activity, and built a brewery that he baptizes with first name of his wife Holy-Marie brewery. The farm continued to function, while the brewery became a very flourishing company. In 1971, with the construction of the new city, expropriation was decided upon, and the brewery shut down in 1973. =Twentieth century= In October 1914, the Germans occupied the area, up to the liberation by British in October 1918. With the population increase due, in part, to the influx of townsmen from the periphery of Lille, the population of the village increased considerably. In 1939, Annappes counted approximately 4000 inhabitants. In the first half of the 20th century, Annappes was made up of 75% workmen, and guarded the village character with few liberal professions or industrial middle-class. During World War, Annappes was controlled by the German command in Brussels, and was not part of Vichy France. The German occupation lasted from May 1940 until September 1944, and the zone was once again liberated by the British. In 1958 the Association of the paralysed :fr:Association des Paralys√©s de France the created the Marc-Sautelet Center of functional rehabilitation, which continued to develop. From 1964 until 1967, a scientific university campus was created on grounds mainly at the south of the commune of Annappes. The Faculty of Science of Lille, today Lille University of Science and Technology is there. In 1967, it Urban Community of Lille M√©tropole was created and gathers 89 communes, including Annappes, Ascq and Flers. On 4 February 1970, at the time of a press conference, the town halls of Annappes, of Ascq and of Flers announce that their communes will amalgamate. On 25 February, Annappes no longer exists as a commune, and became a simple district of the new city of Villeneuve d'Ascq. In 1974, Annappes numbered 13,800 inhabitants.

He became vicar of Aghaboe in 1772, which he must have resigned in 1797, as his successor was then appointed. Ledwich died at his house in York Street, Dublin, on 8 August 1823. Works In 1790, Ledwich published his Antiquities of Ireland. It was later discounted, because of the imperfect information on Irish history current in his day, and his theories were effectually set aside by George Petrie and later writers. In the index to John Lanigan's Ecclesiastical History there are errata to Ledwich. His article on the History and Antiquities of Irishtown and Kilkenny, published in 1781, was appended to the second edition of his Antiquities of Ireland, 1804. In 1791, Ledwich completed the editing and publication of his friend Francis Grose's Antiquities of Ireland. ;Publications , with Francis Grose  Family A daughter married the barrister William Ridgeway.

She is best known for her role as Tomoko in Cape No. 7, the second top-selling film in Taiwanese cinematic history. Career Born as the daughter of the wealthy Japanese cosmetics tycoon Tony Tanaka, Chie Tanaka debuted at age 17 when she appeared in the television series Bishyoujou H, although she did not garner much attention at the time. Her career in the entertainment industry was rather disappointing until she appeared in the movie Initial D, a 2005 Hong Kong movie based on the popular Japanese manga and anime series of the same name, which gained her some popularity in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Jay Chou, who played the lead role Takumi Fujiwara in the movie, later invited her to appear in his music video Common Jasmin Orange. In June 2006 Tanaka went to Taiwan to study Standard Mandarin at Mandarin Training Center, National Taiwan Normal University in anticipation to expand her career. Just before her scheduled return to Japan in February 2007, director Wei Te-sheng invited her to take the leading actress role Tomoko in his upcoming Cape No. 7 and subsequently prolonged her stay in Taiwan. The movie was a success, and Tanaka soon became a popular figure in Taiwan, and had concentrated her career there since. A poll conducted by Yahoo! Taiwan in 2008 named her the third most visible person on the news, after former president Chen Shui-bien and late businessman Wang Yung-ching.2008ÂçÅÂ§ßÁôºÁáíÊñ∞ËÅû‰∫∫Áâ©Á¨¨‰∏âÂêçÔºöÁî∞‰∏≠ÂçÉÁπ™ She followed up her success with the leading role in director Yu-Hsien Lin's 2009 film Sumimasen, Love as a fictionalised version of herself. In the film, Tanaka attempts to reconcile with her sense of identity after starring in Cape No.7 by travelling to sightsee in Kaohsiung, during which she finds unexpected love. In 2010, she played a model turned singer in the idol drama Because of You, about the struggles to succeed in the entertainment industry. Since then she has also worked in Mainland China in various television series. In 2011, Tanaka appeared in the Taiwanese epic film Warriors of the Rainbow: Seedik Bale, as Matsuno Kojima, the wife of officer Genji Kojima. The film was her second collaboration with director Wei Te-sheng. 2012 saw Tanaka playing the dual role of Asuka and Ke Ke in the Taiwanese drama The Last Night Shop, about a late night diner and the colourful patrons it attracts. It is a remake of the Japanese series Shinya Shokodo. She appeared in the 2013 Chinese film The Chef, the Actor, the Scoundrel, as a Japanese officer and fellow alumni of the main characters from Yenching University. In 2015 she starred in the Taiwanese horror film The Bride produced by Takashige Ichise, notable for producing other Japanese horror films such as The Ring and Ju-on franchise.

Future Earth The International Project Office is hosted at Utrecht University, The Netherlands. Earth System Governance International Project Office  Aims  The Earth System Governance Project aims to contribute to science on the large, complex challenges of governance in an era of rapid and large-scale environmental change. The project seeks to create a better understanding of the role of institutions, organizations and governance mechanisms by which humans regulate their relationship with the natural environment. The Earth System Governance Project aims to integrate governance research at all levels. The project aims to examine problems of the ‚Äòglobal commons‚Äô, but also local problems from air pollution to the preservation of waters, waste treatment or desertification and soil degradation. However, due to natural interdependencies local environmental pollution can be transformed into changes of the global system that affect other localities. Therefore, the Earth System Governance Project looks at institutions and governance processes both local and globally. What is Earth System Governance? The Earth System Governance Project is a scientific effort, but also aims to assist policy responses to the pressing problems of earth system transformation. The Broker OnlineNobel Laureates Hand in Recommendations to UN Panel on Global Sustainability  Conceptual framework  The concept of Earth System Governance is defined as: > ... the interrelated and increasingly integrated system of formal and > informal rules, rule-making systems, and actor-networks at all levels of > human society (from local to global) that are set up to steer societies > towards preventing, mitigating, and adapting to global and local > environmental change and, in particular, earth system transformation, within > the normative context of sustainable development. The Earth System Governance Project organizes its research according to a conceptual framework guided by five sets of research lenses according to their 2018 Science and Implementation Plan: Earth System Governance Project. 2018.

Utrecht, the Netherlands. *Architecture and agency *Democracy and power *Justice and allocation *Anticipation and imagination *Adaptiveness and reflexivity These centre around four contextual conditions: *Transformations *Inequality *Anthropocene *Diversity  Origin and history  In 2001, the four then active global change research programmes (DIVERSITAS, International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, World Climate Research Programme, and International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change) agreed to intensify co-operation through setting up an overarching Earth System Science Partnership. The research communities represented in this Partnership contend in the 2001 Amsterdam Declaration on Global Change The Amsterdam Declaration on Global Change that the earth system now operates ‚Äòwell outside the normal state exhibited over the past 500,000 years‚Äô and that ‚Äòhuman activity is generating change that extends well beyond natural variability‚Äîin some cases, alarmingly so‚Äî and at rates that continue to accelerate.‚Äô To cope with this challenge, the four global change research programmes have called ‚Äòurgently‚Äô for strategies for Earth System management‚Äô. In March 2007, in response to the 2001 Amsterdam Declaration, the Scientific Committee of the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP), the overarching social science programme in the field, mandated the drafting of the Science Plan of the Earth System Governance Project by a newly appointed Scientific Planning Committee. The Earth System Governance Project builds on the results of an earlier long-term research programme, the IHDP core project Institutional Dimensions of Global Environmental Change (IDGEC).

In 2008, the Earth System Governance Project was officially launched. In 2009, the Science and Implementation Plan of the Earth System Governance Project was published. In the science and implementation plan, the conceptual problems, cross-cutting themes, flagship projects, and its policy relevance are outlined in detail. The Science Plan was written by an international, interdisciplinary Scientific Planning Committee chaired by Prof. Frank Biermann, which drew on a consultative process that started in 2004. Several working drafts of this Science Plan have been presented and discussed at a series of international events and conferences, and numerous scholars in the field, as well as practitioners, have offered suggestions, advice, and critique. Since then, the project has evolved into a broader research alliance that builds on an international network of research centers, lead faculty and research fellows. After the termination of the IHDP in 2014, the activities of the Earth System Governance research alliance are supported by an international steering group of representatives of the main Earth System Governance Research Centres and the global group of lead faculty and research fellows. Since 2014 first discussions were held at the Conferences around new directions and a new Science and Implementation Plan. In 2016 lead authors were selected and invited. After reviewing by the Earth System Governance community, the final plan was launched at the 2018 Utrecht Conference. In 2015 the Earth system governance Project is part of the overarching international research platform Future Earth.  Global research network  For its activities and implementation, the Earth System Governance Project relies on a global network of experts from different academic and cultural backgrounds. The research network consists of different groups of scientific experts. The Earth System Governance Project operates under the direction of a Scientific Steering Committee. The role of the Scientific Steering Committee is to guide the implementation of the Earth System Governance Science Plan. Scientific Steering Committee, Earth System Governance Project An important element in the project organisation is the global alliance of research centres that brings together the University of Ghana; the University of Bras√≠lia; Utrecht University; the German Development Institute; the CETIP Network; VU University Amsterdam; the University of Amsterdam; the Australian National University; Chiang Mai University; Colorado State University; Lund University; the University of East Anglia; the University of Oldenburg; the Stockholm Resilience Centre; the University of Toronto; the Tokyo Institute of Technology and Yale University. In addition, strong networks on earth system governance research exist in China, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, and Russia.

Policy influence  In 2011, the Earth System Governance Project launched an initiative on International Environmental Governance. This initiative aims to provide a forum for discussion of current and ongoing research on international environmental governance and the institutional framework for sustainable development, in the period leading up to the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro, also known as ‚ÄòRio + 20‚Äô. In addition, the initiative aims to target decision-makers and to contribute not just to a better understanding but also to actual improvements in international environmental governance towards an institutional framework that enables sustainable development. In 2012, 33 leading scholars from the Project wrote a blueprint for reform of strengthening earth system governance, which was published in Science.

Earth System Governance TV  Context  There is widespread support for the Earth System Governance Project in the scientific community, which is reflected in the size of the research network and in various publications by experts.

Climate in Asia and the Pacific: Security, Society and Sustainability. Springer Science & Business Media. However, criticisms of the Earth System Governance Project have also been made. In an internal report of the International Human Dimensions Programme it is stated that the steering group of the Earth System Governance Project is too much dominated by experts from OECD countries. Since then, the Earth System Governance Project has actively sought ways to involve experts from different regions of the world. 1st Earth System Governance Scientific Steering Committee Meeting The idea of earth system governance has also been criticized for being too top-down, for placing too much emphasis on global governance structures. According to Mike Hulme, earth system governance represents an attempt to ‚Äògeopolitically engineer‚Äô our way out of the climate crisis. Mike Hulme. 2008. The Conquering of Climate: Discourses of Fear and Their Dissolution. The Geographical Journal. Vol. 174, No. 1 He questions whether the climate is governable and argues that it is way too optimistic and even hubristic to attempt to control the global climate by universal governance regimes.

He also renovated the Elgin Dairy Company building into luxury condominiums. Illinois House of Representatives In November 2008, he defeated two-term Republican Ruth Munson in the heavily Republican 43rd representative district of the Illinois House of Representatives, winning by 322 votes. Farnham was in the Illinois House from January 2009 to March 2014. The district included portions of Elgin, Carpentersville, East Dundee and South Elgin. His House committee assignments included Aging, Appropriations (Human Services), Consumer Protection, Education Reform, State Government Administration, and Veterans' Affairs starting with the 96th General Assembly; Disability Services, Elementary & Secondary Education (and its Mandate Subcommittee), and Environment & Energy starting with the 97th General Assembly. He co-sponsored two bills to increase penalties for child pornography. On March 13, 2014, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations raided Farnham's home and his district office in Elgin to execute federal search warrants.

Typical examples include such forms as subjunctives and irrealis moods. In the Eskimo‚ÄìAleut languages, there are special \\"dependent moods\\" used only in subordinate clauses. # There are verb forms that have the same distinctions of person, tense and aspect as are found in main-clause verbs, but which indicate them using special forms distinct from those of main clause verbs.Croft, William; Typology and Universals; pp. 216-217. # There are verb forms that do not have the distinctions of person, tense and aspect found in main-clause verbs, such as participles. These are used for certain types of subordinate clauses in English like \\"Being so busy, I couldn't come home.\\" # There are verb forms that add extra morphemes never found on main clause verbs. Often these are adpositions or case suffixes. Subordination deranking hierarchy Languages that use deranking for their subordinate-clause verb forms do so according to a definite pattern. There are relatively few languages that use deranked verb forms for all subordinate clauses (examples are found amongst the Tungusic and Salishan languagesCristofaro, Sonia; Subordination; pp. 298-300. ), but most languages with significant verb inflection use deranking for at least some of their subordinate clauses. Exceptions can be found only amongst certain rigidly head-marking languages such as Ainu and Lakhota. Languages with deranking far down (rightward) on the hierarchy are most typically those with extensive nominal case systems. This is because in their presence information expressed by person marking on the verb is already expressed on nouns. If relations of core noun phrases are marked only on the verb, it is less uneconomic to express them in a dependent clause. The distribution of balancing and deranking in languages that do not belong to one of the two polar types briefly discussed in the previous page follows a definite hierarchy. If balancing is used at any point, it is used for all points below it on the following list (\\"to the right\\" in traditional wording of the deranking hierarchy)Croft; Typology and Universals; p. 217 Relevant clauses for each example are italicised. # Modals and phasals (e.g. \\"I begin to run\\") # Purpose clauses (e.g. \\"I went into the phone booth in order to ring up my friend\\") # Desideratives (e.g. \\"I want to write a letter\\") and manipulatives (e.g. \\"I made John fight\\") # Perception (e.g. \\"I see the bus passing\\") # \\"Before\\", \\"when\\" and \\"after\\", plus nominative or absolutive relativisation. # Reason (e.g. \\"I cannot leave him alone, because he's gone mad\\") and reality condition (e.g. \\"If capitalism did not cause the Great Depression, government was responsible\\"), plus accusative or ergative relativisation. # Knowledge (e.g. \\"I know that the weather will be very hot\\") and propositional attitude (e.g. \\"I think that we should stay at home today\\"), plus oblique and indirect object relativisation. # Utterance (e.g. \\"He said that he was tired\\"). =Explanations for the deranking hierarchy= The commonly accepted explanation for the hierarchy outlined in the previous section is that the types of relation at the top of the deranking hierarchy are much more semantically integrated than those at the bottom. Being semantically integrated means that the events in the main and subordinate clauses are linked, which is true of purpose, perception, \\"before\\", \\"when\\" and \\"after\\" clauses, but not of those further rightward in the hierarchy. This integration leads to the use of verb forms not marked for tense, person or aspect, since they are much simpler than verb forms with these markers. Relations that are temporal and imply that the dependent event takes place within a particular time reference relative to the main event favour verb forms that are unmarked for tense or aspect for the same reason. This is why temporal relations like \\"before\\", \\"when\\" and \\"after\\" come above relationships that have no temporal implication of this type like conditionals. Another factor influencing use of deranking is lack of realisation of the dependent event, which often leads in purpose, desiderative and manipulative clauses to the use of moods that cannot be used in independent clauses.

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange. Formerly involved in house- building, it sold its housing businesses to Bovis Homes - subsequently renamed Vistry Group - in January 2020, and Galliford Try is today focused on the building, highways and environment markets. History The company was created in 2000 through a merger of Try Group plc, founded in 1908 in London, and Galliford plc, founded in 1916. =Try Group= Try was founded by William S Try, a carpenter, in 1908 in Uxbridge, west London. W. S. Try Ltd operated as a general contractor until the beginning of the 1970s, when Try Homes was formed. Despite acquisitions, housing remained on a relatively small scale, peaking at around 200 units a year in the beginning of the 1990s. =Galliford= Thomas Galliford established a steamroller hire business in Wolvey, Warwickshire in 1916, but this closed during World War II after which his sons re-formed the company, incorporated as a civil engineering business, Galliford & Sons, on 2 April 1952. Galliford became a public company in 1965. It then entered the private housing market in 1973 with the acquisition of Crabb Curtis. The housing contribution was late extended through Stamford Homes and, in 1998, the acquisition of Midas Homes, by which time the group was building around 500 houses a year.Wellings, Fred: Dictionary of British Housebuilders (2006) Troubador. =Galliford Try plc= Between 2005 and 2015 the company was led by chief executive Greg Fitzgerald. The company expanded its construction business acquiring Morrison Construction from AWG plc in March 2006AWG sells building arm to Galliford The Daily Telegraph, 2 March 2006 and Miller Construction from Miller Homes in July 2014. It expanded its housebuilding business acquiring Gerald Wood Homes in 2001, Chartdale in January 2006,Galliford buys Chartdale for ¬£67m Contract Journal, 19 January 2006 Kendall Cross in November 2007,Galliford Try buys Kendall Cross for ¬£9.3m Building, 15 November 2007 Linden Homes in February 2008,Galliford Try buys Linden Homes for ¬£244.5m Building, 8 February 2008 Rosemullion Homes in December 2009 and Shepherd Homes in May 2015. All the individual house building divisions were rebranded as Linden Homes in 2011. In February 2018, following the January collapse of Carillion (Galliford Try's joint venture partner, with Balfour Beatty, on the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route, AWPR), Galliford Try said it would need to raise ¬£150m to pay for cost overruns on the project; in November 2018, the company said delays would cost an extra ¬£20m, taking its total project hit to ¬£143m. CEO Peter Truscott said the company's construction division would no longer undertake fixed price major projects of this kind. On 27 March 2018, the company confirmed it had successfully raised ¬£158m in a rights issue. Truscott left Galliford Try in March 2019 with Graham Prothero appointed as new CEO. In April 2019, the company announced it would reduce its construction operation as part of a strategic review undertaken in light of additional costs from the AWPR project, and from Morrison Construction's role on the ¬£1.35bn Queensferry Crossing project. The announcement caused Galliford Try's share price to drop 19%. The company subsequently announced 350 jobs were likely to be cut ‚Äì mostly in Galliford Try's Scottish infrastructure operations ‚Äì as the company focused on core strengths in buildings, water and highways. Restructuring the construction business cost the group ¬£10m. On 24 May 2019, Galliford Try's board rejected a ¬£950m offer from Bovis Homes (led by former CEO Fitzgerald) for the Linden Homes and Partnerships & Regeneration businesses. In July, the group was said to be considering a possible demerger of construction from the more profitable housing and partnerships business, potentially in 2020/21. In July 2019, Galliford Try was suspended from the Prompt Payment Code for failing to pay suppliers on time. Following improvements in its payment performance, it was restored to the Prompt Payment Code in January 2020. On 11 September 2019, the group reported revenues for the year to June 2019 of ¬£2.863bn (down 8% from 2018); pre-tax profit was down 27% at ¬£104.7m. Galliford Try reported a ¬£61.5m operating loss on its construction activities, with revenues down 18%, affected also by the losses incurred on the AWPR project. Talks with Bovis Homes about a possible sale reopened in September 2019, with a preliminary deal, valued at ¬£1.075bn, reportedly agreed. Sale of the housing business would recapitalise Galliford Try's construction business, which, following restructuring, would employ some 3,400 staff generating revenues of around ¬£1.4bn. On 7 November, it was reported that Bovis Homes had agreed a share and cash deal that valued Galliford Try's housing business at ¬£1.1bn. The sale of Galliford Try's housing interests to Bovis Homes - later renamed Vistry Group - was completed on 3 January 2020. Galliford Try received shares plus ¬£300m cash in the deal, making it a well-capitalised standalone contractor. As expected, Bill Hocking, formerly head of Galliford Try's construction arm, was appointed CEO of Galliford Try Holdings. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Galliford Try furloughed staff and suspended a previously announced dividend. It said it could not quantify the pandemic's impacts on its operations and supply chain, and on its financial performance. In a July 2020 trading update, Galliford Try reported an operating loss of 5% due to the pandemic. Operations Galliford Try is focused on the building, highways and environment markets.

The houses in question were the new Breaking New Ground (BNG) houses in the Symphony section of Delft near the main road Symphony Way. This was the largest occupation of houses in South Africa's history. Occupation The BNG houses were originally promised to backyard dwellers in the area. After the January 2005 fire in Joe Slovo Informal Settlement, 1000 Joe Slovo families were moved to Transit Camps in Delft and promised priority in the allocation of N2 Gateway housing in Delft. The houses were occupied by backyard dwellers and other mostly poor residents in and around Delft on the 19th of December 2007. After the occupation, it emerged that a local DA councillor, Frank Martin, had encouraged local families to occupy the houses. Though the charges against Martin were later dropped, what ensued was a high- profile political fight between the ANC and DA, each accusing the other of racism, playing party politics, and using the poor for their own gain. Police and a private security company began evicting residents on the 24th of December but were ordered to stop after the Cape High Court said that the evictions were illegal because the sheriff was using an eviction order granted to the City of Cape Town in October 2006 against other people. Legal Litigation resumed in January 2008 and on the 5th of February, the Cape High Court granted an eviction order. The judge ignored the section of the 1999 PIE Act which requires reasonable alternative accommodation to be provided to people who are evicted with nowhere else to go on the basis that they could find accommodation where they came from. As part of the order, the judge also faulted Frank Martin for instigating the occupation and who pledge no contest to allegations during the trial. Residents attempted to appeal the eviction order on the 15th of February and their appeal was rejected without a hearing. Eviction The eviction order went into effect at 5am, 19 February 2008, the next day after Judge Van Zyl refused to hear the residents' appeal. During the evictions, police used stun grenades and rubber bullets against crowds protesting their eviction orders. At least 20 residents were injured. After the evictions, about 1000 families slept in the open. They eventually chose to either occupy Symphony Way or set up camp in a nearby open space. The latter group eventually were moved to a newly built Temporary Relocation Area (TRA) nicknamed Blikkiesdorp which was built by the City of Cape Town. The families living on Symphony Way have refused to be moved to any TRA and continue to occupy the road. On February 18, 2009, a City of Cape Town disciplinary committee found Martin guilty of encouraging people to invade homes at Delft.DA councillor found guilty IOL As punishment, Martin was suspended for one month, while former supporters of the councillor expressed outrage and called for him to be fired.

W. Eger (12 December 1880 ‚Äì 2 December 1966) was a Norwegian businessperson. An associate of Sam Eyde, Eger was the chief executive officer of Elkem from 1912 to 1950, and later played a role in building the Norwegian iron industry. Early life He was born in Kristiania as a son of barrister Nicolai Andresen Eger (1849‚Äì1910) and his wife Marie Frimann Dietrichson (1853‚Äì1946). He was a brother of barrister Adolf Eger. In October 1911 he married Dikke Smith Housken (1890‚Äì1938), a daughter of dentist Ole Smith Housken. Business career He took his examen artium in 1899 and engineer education in Dresden. After graduation in 1906 he became affiliated with industrialist Sam Eyde. From 1907 to 1908, Eger headed Eyde's engineer office in Kristiania. Between 1908 and 1910, he oversaw the construction of the power plant at Lienfoss in Telemark. In 1911 Eger took over as chief executive officer of the company Arendals Fossekompani. The next year, he became chief executive of Elektrokemisk, later renamed Elkem. He had been a board member of Elektrokemisk since 1910. In 1912, he was also named as chair of the silicon carbide production company Arendal Smelteverk. He was also the chairman of the Norwegian Lawn Tennis Federation from 1913 to 1920. In 1924 he published the book Lawn-tennis; reissued in 1930 under the name Tennis. World War II On 9 April 1940, Norway had been invaded by Germany as a part of World War II. The ruling cabinet Nygaardsvold and the Royal Family fled the capital Oslo, and Fascist politician Vidkun Quisling took advantage of the situation to perform a coup d'etat. However, this was highly unpopular among the Norwegian people, and the newly arrived German occupants did not support such a government either. The Supreme Court of Norway, with support by directors in business life and civil administration, were given the green light by German envoy Curt Br√§uer to establish the so-called Administrative Council. On 3 May 1940, the Administrative Council established the Committee for Industry and Trade (Nemnda for industri og omsetning), to maintain industrial production in Norway throughout the hardships of the war. Conrad Wilhelm Eger had a central role in this committee, together with Carl B√∏yesen, Einar Schjelderup, Elias Volan and chairman Einar Sunde. Eger was also a member of a committee which reviewed the potential for building more aluminium plants. The German occupants eventually tightened their control over Norway, spearheaded by Reichskommissar Josef Terboven. The Administrative Council was abolished on 25 September 1940, and the Committee for Industry and Trade was abolished in February 1941. The Committee for Industry and Trade was scrutinized after the war, as a part of the legal purge in Norway after World War II. In the autumn of 1941, Eger was behind a resistance to the German- friendly working committee in the Federation of Norwegian Industries. Together with Gunnar Schjelderup he created the industrial development group Studieselskapet for Norsk Industri. From 1944 it was coordinated with the industrial planning for the post-war age, conducted out of London and New York by Norwegian authorities-in-exile. Eger was also a central figure in Hjemmefrontens Ledelse. He had to flee to the neutral Sweden in 1944. Post- war Eger was instrumental in the establishment of Norsk Jernverk in Mo i Rana in 1946, having been appointed as chairman of the national Ironworks Commission in August 1945 by the Gerhardsen's First Cabinet. He was chair of Elkem after stepping down as chief executive; from 1950 to 1959. He chaired Forsikringsselskapet Norden from 1950 to 1955, and chaired the supervisory council of Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse from 1946 to 1953. He was also involved in academia, as a council member of NTNF and from 1951 as a fellow of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. He was decorated as a Commander of the Order of St. Olav in 1954.

If no underlying disorder can be identified (idiopathic RS3PE), this entity has an excellent prognosis and responds well to treatment. RS3PE typically involves the joints of the extremities, specifically the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints, wrists, shoulders, elbows, knees and ankles. It is more common in older adults, with the mean age between 70 and 80 years in most studies. It occurs more often in men than in women with a 2:1 ratio. It is unknown how common this condition is. Signs and symptoms Individuals affected by RS3PE typically have repeated episodes of inflammation of the lining of their synovial joints and swelling of the end portion of the limbs. The arms and hands are more commonly affected than the legs and feet. Both sides are usually involved though RS3PE can affect only one side in certain cases. Causes RS3PE is a constellation of symptoms that can be caused by many other conditions. Since there is no definitive diagnostic test, other conditions have to be ruled out before this rare condition can be diagnosed. The main differential diagnosis is polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), although pain, stiffness and weakness at the level of the shoulders and pelvic girdle with associated systemic symptoms (fever, malaise, fatigue, weight loss) is more typical of PMR. Prospective studies have found a subgroup of PMR patients with hand edema, as well as other similarities. Thus, RS3PE has been proposed as a condition related to PMR or even that they are both part of the same disorder. However, PMR typically requires protracted courses of steroids, whereas corticosteroids can be tapered more quickly with persisting remission in RS3PE. Other rheumatological disorders that can cause the features typical for RS3PE include late onset (seronegative) rheumatoid arthritis, acute sarcoidosis, ankylosing spondylitis and other spondyloarthropathies such as psoriatic arthropathy, mixed connective tissue disease, chondrocalcinosis and arthropathy due to amyloidosis. RS3PE has been documented in patients with cancers (Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer and bladder cancer, among others), in whom it might represent a paraneoplastic manifestation. Other underlying disorders include vasculitides such as polyarteritis nodosa. Other causes of edema include heart failure, hypoalbuminemia, nephrotic syndrome and venous stasis. The key distinguishing feature is that these conditions don't tend to manifest with pitting edema at the back of the hands. Pathogenesis The disease mechanism (pathophysiology) of RS3PE remains unknown. One study suggested a possible role for vascular endothelial growth factor. A study using magnetic resonance imaging found that tenosynovitis of the extensors of the hands and feet is the major contributor to edema. Diagnosis Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging of the hands and/or feet have been proposed as useful diagnostic investigations in RS3PE. Some studies linked RS3PE to HLA-B27 whereas others have not. Treatment RS3PE responds excellently to low dose corticosteroids, with sustained and often complete remission. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have also been used. Hydroxychloroquine has proven effective in some cases. History In a 1985 paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, McCarty and colleagues first described a case series of patients with this disorder, for which they coined the abbreviation RS3PE. RS3PE was initially thought to represent a form of seronegative rheumatoid arthritis but is now believed to be a separate syndrome.

For the first several decades of disc record manufacturing, sound was recorded directly on to the master disc (also called the matrix, sometimes just the master) at the recording studio. From about 1950 on (earlier for some large record companies, later for some small ones) it became usual to have the performance first recorded on audio tape, which could then be processed and/or edited, and then dubbed on to the master disc. A record cutter would engrave the grooves into the master disc. Early versions of these master discs were soft wax, and later a harder lacquer was used. The mastering process was originally something of an art as the operator had to manually allow for the changes in sound which affected how wide the space for the groove needed to be on each rotation. Sometimes the engineer would sign his work, or leave humorous or cryptic comments in the lead-out groove area, where it was normal to scratch or stamp identifying codes to distinguish each master.  Mass producing  Production of phonograph records The original soft master, known as a \\"lacquer\\", was silvered using the same process as the silvering of mirrors. To prepare the master for making copies, soft masters made of wax were coated with fine graphite. Later masters made of lacquer were sprayed with a saponin mix, rinsed, and then sprayed with stannous chloride, which sensitized the surface. After another rinse, they were sprayed with a mix of the silver solution and dextrose reducer to create a silver coating. This coating provided the conductive layer to carry the current for the subsequent electroplating, commonly with a nickel alloy. In the early days of microgroove records (1940‚Äì1960), nickel plating was only brief, just an hour or less. This was followed by copper plating, which was both quicker and simpler to manage at that time. Later with advent of nickel sulfamate plating solutions, all matrices were plated with solid nickel. Most factories transferred the master matrix after an initial flash of nickel from a slow warm nickel electroplating bath at around 15 amperes to a hot 130 degree nickel plating bath. In this, the current would be raised at regular intervals until it reached between 110 A and 200 A, depending on the standard of the equipment and the skill of the operators. This and all subsequent metal copies were known as matrices. When this metal master was removed from the lacquer (master), it would be a negative master or master matrix, since it was a negative copy of the lacquer. (In the UK, this was called the master; note the difference from soft master/lacquer disc above). In the earliest days the negative master was used as a mold to press records sold to the public, but as demand for mass production of records grew, another step was added to the process. After removing the silver deposit and passifying (see below), the metal master was then electroplated (electroformed) to create metal positive matrices, or \\"mothers\\". From these positives, stampers (negatives) would be formed. Producing mothers was similar to electroforming Masters, except the time allowed to turn-up to full current was much shorter and the heavier Mothers could be produced in as little as one hour and stampers (145 grams) could be made in 45 minutes. Prior to plating either the nickel master or nickel mother, it needed to be passified to prevent the next matrix from adhering to the mother. There were several methods used; EMI favoured the fairly difficult albumin soaking method whereas CBS Records and Philips used the electrolytic method. Soaking in a dichromate solution was another popular method, however, this method risked contaminating the nickel solution with chrome. The electrolytic method was similar to the standard electrolytic cleaning method except the cycles were reversed finishing the process with the matrix as the anode. This also cleaned the surface of the matrix about to be copied. After separating from the master, a new mother was polished with a fine abrasive to remove (or at least round-off) the microscopic \\"horns\\" at the top of the grooves, produced by the cutting lathe. This allowed the vinyl to flow better in the pressing stage and reduced the non-fill problem. Stampers produced from the mothers after separating were chrome plated to provide a hard stain-free surface. Each stamper was next centre punched for the pin on the playback turntable. Methods used included aligning the final locked groove over three pins, or tapping the edge while rotating under the punch until the grooves could be seen (through a microscope) to move constantly towards the centre. Either method was quite skilled and took much effort to learn. The centre punch not only punched a hole, but formed a lip which would be used to secure the stamper into the press. The stamper was next trimmed to size, and the back sanded smooth, to ensure a smooth finish to the mouldings, and improve contact between the stamper and the press die. The edge was then pressed hydraulically to form another lip to clamp the edge down on the press. The stampers would be used in hydraulic presses to mould the LP discs. The advantages of this system over the earlier more-direct system included ability to make a large number of records quickly by using multiple stampers. Also, more records could be produced from each master since stampers would eventually get damaged, but rarely wear out. Since the master was the unique source of the positive, made to produce the stampers, it was considered a library item. Accordingly, copy positives, required to replace worn positives, were made from unused early stampers. These were known as copy shells, and were the physical equivalent of the first positive. The \\"pedigree\\" of any record can be traced through the positive/stamper identities used, by reading the lettering found on the record run-out area.  Packaging and distribution  Singles are typically sold in plain or label-logo paper sleeves, though EPs are often treated to a cover in similar style to an LP. LPs are universally packaged in paperboard covers with a paper (usually additional artwork, photography, and/or lyrics) or plastic liner (or \\"poly-lined\\" paper) protecting the delicate surface of the record. Few albums have had records packaged inside with a 3 mil polyethylene plastic sleeve, either square or round-bottomed (also called \\"U\\" shaped), and an accompanying 11√ó11 paper insert with the additional artwork, photography, and/or lyrics as described above. The insert could be single- or double-sided, in color or grayscale, and glossy or matte. Packaging methods have changed since the introduction of the LP record. The 'wrap-around' or 'flipback' sleeve initially became the standard packaging method for LPs during the 1950s. In this packaging method the front cover is able to be printed in colour and is laminated, whereas the back cover features only black text on a white background and is usually unlaminated. These sleeves are constructed in two parts: a laminated front section is wrapped around a separate back panel. Three 'flaps' are used to fix the front and back panels together on the outside. As the unlaminated cardboard back cover section is prone to discolouration due to exposure to natural light, in some instances a single printed sheet containing the back cover information is pasted over the entire back panel, covering the 'wrap- around' flaps but not reaching the outer edge of the sleeve, thus allowing some of the laminated 'flaps' to be exposed. While discolouration still occurs with this method, it is often less evident than when the cardboard back cover alone is exposed. A common feature of flipback sleeves in the 1960s was for information specific to either monaural or stereo versions of the record (typically a format-specific catalogue number and a \\"MONO\\" or \\"STEREO\\" disclaimer) would be printed on the same front cover artwork, and the whole front panel shifted up or down to expose the appropriate \\"version\\" on the front while the unused one would be covered up (but often not very well) by the back cover panel. Towards the end of the 1960s advances in printing and packaging technology led to the introduction of the 'fully laminated' sleeve. Rather than the two-part construction of the 'wrap-around' sleeve, this method consists of a single component part, which is printed in full colour and is completely laminated with the 'flaps' tucked inside the back sleeve section. This is the method generally used for all subsequent releases in the vinyl age and is considered superior not only because of the additional ease allowed in the use of a single component, but also because the fully laminated finish offers far better protection from discolouration caused by exposure to natural light. With the advent of long-playing records, the album cover became more than just packaging and protection, and album cover art became an important part of the music marketing and consuming experience. In the 1970s it became more common to have picture covers on singles. Many singles with picture sleeves (especially from the 1960s) are sought out by collectors, and the sleeves alone can go for a high price. LPs can have embossed cover art (with some sections being raised), an effect rarely seen on CD covers. The label area on the disc itself may contain themed or custom artwork rather than the standard record company's logo layout. An array of albums pressed in varying presentations Records are made at large manufacturing plants, either owned by the major labels, or run by independent operators to whom smaller operations and independent labels could go for smaller runs. A band starting out might get a few hundred disks stamped, whereas big selling artists need the presses running full-time to manufacture the hundreds of thousands of copies needed for the launch of a big album. For most bands today, using any of the large manufacturing plants, it is not cost-effective to produce less than one thousand records. To do raises the cost of production, almost prohibitively. The reason for this is that the start up costs for making a record, as discussed prior in this article, are high when compared to the start up costs for making, say, a compact disc. Sometimes bands might make a picture jacket for their record. Again, usually it is cost prohibitive to make less than one thousand jackets. The average cost for manufacturing a 7\\" record with a picture jacket is approximately $2.50, at a run of one thousand records and jackets - if one uses any of the large manufacturing plants. Records are generally sold through specialist shops, although some big chain stores also have record departments. Many records are sold from stock, but it is normal to place special orders for less common records. Stock is expensive, so only large city center stores can afford to have several copies of a record. While records are generally pressed on plain black vinyl, the album itself is given a much more ornamental appearance. This can include a solid color (other than black), splatter art, a marble look, or transparency (either tinged with a color or clear). Some examples of this can be seen to the right. One of the most well known examples of this technique is the white vinyl repressing of The Beatles' White Album. Labels Victor (later RCA Victor) logo featuring Nipper the dog Record companies organised their products into labels. These could either be subsidiary companies, or they could simply be just a brand name. For example, EMI published records under the His Master's Voice (HMV) label which was their classical recording brand, Harvest for their progressive rock brand, home to Pink Floyd. They also had Music for Pleasure and Classics for Pleasure as their economy labels. EMI also used the Parlophone brand in the UK for Beatles records in the early 1960s. In the 1970s successful musicians sought greater control, and one way they achieved this was with their own labels, though normally they were still operated by the large music corporations. Two of the most famous early examples of this were the Beatles' Apple Records and Led Zeppelin's Swan Song Records In the late 1970s the anarchic punk rock movement gave rise to the independent record labels. These were not owned or even distributed by the major corporations. In the UK, examples were Stiff Records, who published Ian Dury and the Blockheads, and 2 Tone Records, a label for the Specials. These allowed smaller bands to step onto the ladder without having to conform to the rigid rules of the large corporations.  Home recording  One example of an \\"instantaneous recording\\" machine, available to the home recording enthusiast by about 1929 or 1930, was the \\"Sentinel Chromatron\\" machine.The \\"Sentinel Chromatron\\" machine for recording on uncoated aluminum is described as part of a History Detectives 2007 investigation of an Amos 'n' Andy Recording (Official PBS transcript here). The Amos 'n' Andy radio episode recorded was called \\"Breach of Promise\\"; it was broadcast on March 5, 1931, by the Woodmen of the World on WOW radio in Omaha, Nebraska. The Sentinel Chromatron recorded on a single side of uncoated aluminum; its records were read with a fibre needle. It was \\"rather unstable technology\\" which produced poor sound quality in comparison to shellac records and was rarely used after 1935. RCA Victor introduced home phonograph disk recorders in October 1930. These phonographs featured a large counterbalanced tone arm with horseshoe magnet pick-up. These types of pick- ups could also be \\"driven\\" to actually move the needle and RCA took advantage of that by designing a system of home recording that used \\"pre-grooved\\" records. The material that the records were made from (advertised as \\"Victrolac\\") was soft and it was possible to somewhat modulate the grooves using the pick-up with proper recording needle and a fairly heavy weight placed on the pick-up. The discs were only six inches in diameter so recording time at 78rpm was brief. Larger size Victor blanks were introduced late in 1931, when RCA-Victor introduced the Radiola-Electrola RE-57. These machines were capable of recording at 33 rpm as well as 78 rpm. One could select to record something from the radio or one could record using the hand-held microphone. The RAE-59 sold for a hefty $350.00 at a time when many manufacturers had trouble finding buyers for $50.00 radios. The home phonograph disk recorders of the 1930s were expensive machines that few could afford. Cheaper machines, such as the Wilcox-Gay Recordio line, were sold during the late 1930s through the early 1950s. They operated at 78 rpm only and were similar in appearance to (and not much larger than) a portable phonograph of the era. One 1941 model that included a radio sold for $39.95, approximately equivalent to $500 in 2005 dollars. The fidelity was adequate for clear voice recordings. In the past (approximately from the 1940s through the 1970s), there were booths called Voice-O-Graphs, that let the user record their own voice onto a record when money was inserted. These were often found at arcades and tourist attractions alongside other vending and game machines. The Empire State Building's 86th floor observatory in New York City, Coney Island, NY and Conneaut Lake Park, PA are some of the locations which had such machines. Gem Razors also created thousands of free Voice-O-Graph records during wartime for the troops to send home to their families. In the former USSR, records were commonly homemade using discarded medical x-rays. These records, which were usually made under the nation's samizdat movement, were nicknamed \\"Bones\\" or \\"Ribs\\", were usually inscribed with illegal copies of popular music banned by the government. They also became a popular means of distribution among Soviet punk bands; in addition to the high cost and low availability of vinyl, punk music was politically suppressed, and publishing outlets were limited. Home-made \\"Bone\\" record. Currently, two companies (Vestax and Vinylrecorder) offer disk recorders priced in the high four figures which enable \\"experienced professional users\\" and enthusiasts to produce high-fidelity stereo vinyl recordings. The Gakken Company in Japan also offers the Emile Berliner Gramophone Kit, and while it does not record actual records, it enables the user to physically inscribe sounds onto a CD (or any flat, smooth surface) with a needle and replay them back on any similar machine. Home recording equipment made a cameo appearance in the 1941 Marx Brothers film, The Big Store. A custom recording was also the original surprise Christmas present in the 1931 version of The Bobbsey Twins' Wonderful Secret (when the book was rewritten in 1962 as The Bobbsey Twins' Wonderful Winter Secret, it became an 8 mm movie).

Life He was born in Ljubljana as the only son of the renowned geographer Anton Melik. After finishing the Ljubljana Classical Lyceum, he enrolled at the University of Ljubljana, where he studied under the supervision of the historian Fran Zwitter. During World War Two, he was sent to the Gonars concentration camp by the Fascist Italian occupation authorities, and then to a labour camp near Postojna. After the Italian armistice in September 1943, he was released and returned to Ljubljana, where he graduated from history in 1944. In 1945, he worked shortly as a correspondent for the Yugoslav press agency Tanjug, and then continued the academic career. Work Melik's research was focused on the Slovene history of the 19th century. He first dedicated to the economic history, but then shifted to political history, especially history of legal and political institutions. Particularly important is his study on the elections in the Slovene Lands between 1861 and 1918. He also researched history of everyday life, especially of the period of modernization and industrialization of the Slovene countryside in Carniola and Lower Styria. In the 1980s, he collaborated with the publishing house Slovenska matica in the critical editions of memoirs by prominent Slovene politicians of the 19th century, including Ivan Hribar and Josip Vo≈°njak. He died in Ljubljana.  Controversy  Melik was frequently accused, especially after the democratisation of Slovenia in 1990, that he was too cooperative with the Communist regime. One of the main accusations against Melik was that he was involved in the removal of the Catholic conservative literary historian Anton Slodnjak from the University of Ljubljana because of his alternative interpretations of the history of Slovenian literature. In March 1959, in fact, in midst of an instigated massive denigration campaign against the distinguished scholar, Melik published a long negative critique of Slodnjak's historical interpretations, accusing him of non-scientific and metaphysical approach to literary history.Ale≈° Gabriƒç, Socialistiƒçna kulturna revolucija (Ljubljana: Cankarjeva zalo≈æba, 1995), 286.

As a young woman, she dated Ian Fleming and is believed to be one of the three or four women whose attributes were used by him for the character of Miss Moneypenny. Joan Bright Astley was born in Monte Caseros, Corrientes, Argentina. Her father was an English accountant; her mother, a Scottish governess. Described as a difficult teenager, she attended a number of schools, learning shorthand and typing and working as a secretary at the British legation in Mexico. In the 1930s, she was offered a job, which she declined, in Nazi Germany, teaching English to the family of Rudolf Hess. In 1939, she was told by a friend that she might have a chance of work if she went to a certain London Underground station one day, wearing a pink carnation. She did so and was guided to an office in Whitehall where she was met by a colonel, who had her sign the Official Secrets Act and warned her not to be seen by a certain person standing outside the building when she left. She was hired by D/MI(R), a section of the War Office concerned, among other things, with disrupting the flow of Romanian oil to the Third Reich. Later in the war, she was employed by the Joint Planning Committee and given the job of running the Secret Intelligence Centre, which was in fact a single room in the Cabinet War Rooms. She had custody of secret papers and reports and, on instructions, would show a given report to a senior officer and allow him to read it in her office, under top secret conditions. By all accounts, she made the officers welcome with her informal manner. Subsequently, she became personal assistant to General Sir Hastings Ismay, a close associate of Winston Churchill's. During the war, she dated Ian Fleming, and said of him, \\"I thought he was awfully attractive and fun, but elusive. I think he was a ruthless man ‚Äì he would drop somebody if he didn't want them any more. That would be it.\\" She added, \\"No torrid love affair.\\" She served as an administrative officer at several wartime and postwar conferences. She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1946 New Year Honours, when she was described as \\"Principal, Offices of the Cabinet and Minister of Defence.\\" In 1949, she married Colonel Philip Astley, first husband of Madeleine Carroll, whom he had divorced in 1940. Colonel Astley died in 1958. In 1971, Joan Astley wrote of her wartime life in a memoir, The Inner Circle: a View of War at the Top, and in 1993 co-authored a book on Sir Colin Gubbins. She died on Christmas Eve 2008. According to Samantha Weinberg, author of The Moneypenny Diaries, which she published under the name Kate Westbrook, Astley is one of three or four women used by Fleming as the basis of Miss Moneypenny.

The CEO, chairman and de facto managing director of Brayhead Ltd, Mr Richards, had guaranteed repayment of money, and had indemnified losses of Lord Suirdale in return for injection of money into Lord Suirdale's company Perdio Electronics Ltd. Perdio Ltd was then taken over by Brayhead Ltd and Lord Suirdale gained a place on Brayhead Ltd's board, but Perdio Ltd's business did not recover. It went into liquidation, Lord Suirdale resigned from Brayhead Ltd‚Äôs board and sued for the losses he had incurred. Brayhead Ltd refused to pay on the basis that Mr Richards had no authority to make the guarantee and indemnity contract in the first place. Roskill J held Mr Richards had apparent authority to bind Brayhead Ltd, and the company appealed. Judgment Lord Denning MR held that he did have authority, but it was actual authority because (like a \\"course of dealing\\" in contract law) the fact that the board had let Mr Richards continue to act had in fact created actual authority.

Perry, 570. U.S. (2013), also known as the legal fight against Proposition 8. He was first elected as City Attorney in 2001, and re-elected without opposition in 2005, 2009, 2013, 2015 and 2019.San Francisco Municipal Election Nov. 3, 2009 - Results He ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of San Francisco in the 2011 election, finishing third in the City's ranked-choice voting system. Early life and education Born November 6, 1962 in Bay Shore, Long Island, New York, Herrera grew up in the nearby middle class community of Glen Cove. His father was a psychiatrist who immigrated from Colombia after serving as part of a UN Peacekeeping force during the Suez War of 1956. His mother is the child of Italian immigrants and worked as a nurse in Glen Cove. Herrera earned his bachelor's degree from Villanova University in Pennsylvania, and his Juris Doctor from the George Washington University School of Law in Washington, D.C. Herrera worked various jobs to support himself during his education, from his newspaper route as a young boy, to restocking shelves at the local grocery store, to serving as a short order cook in a local diner. Upon graduating from law school in 1987, Herrera was offered an associate position at a maritime law firm in San Francisco and moved to the city.http://www.smartvoter.org/2001/11/06/ca/sf/vote/herrera_d/bio.html Political career After his move to San Francisco, Herrera became an active member of the community, joining his local Democratic club and helping to get Democratic candidates elected in the city. In 1990, he was appointed to the Waterfront Plan Advisory Board, and later served on the Finance Committee for the California Democratic Party. In 1993 Herrera was appointed to the U.S. Maritime Administration in Washington, D.C. during President Clinton's Administration. He returned to private practice in San Francisco as a partner in the maritime law firm of Kelly, Gill, Sherburne & Herrera. Then-Mayor Willie Brown appointed Herrera to the SF Transportation Commission, and later to the San Francisco Police Commission. Herrera was voted the President of the Police Commission after just one year of service. San Francisco City Attorney In December 2001, Herrera was elected San Francisco City Attorney, becoming the first Latino to hold the office. He was re-elected in 2005, 2009, 2013, 2015 and 2019. =Sanctuary Cities= On January 31, 2017 Herrera brought the first lawsuit in the nation against President Donald Trump over his executive order threatening to withhold billions of dollars in federal funding from sanctuary cities and other local and state governments. Herrera's federal lawsuit alleges that the executive order is unconstitutional and exceeds the president's power. The trial court ruled in San Francisco's favor, finding Trump's executive order unconstitutional and ordering a nationwide halt to enforcement of it. The federal government appealed that ruling. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on August 1, 2018 upheld the district court's ruling on the merits in favor of San Francisco, finding that the executive order violates the Constitution's separation-of-powers guarantee, which reserves legislative and spending authority to Congress, not the president. Herrera on August 11, 2017 filed a second lawsuit against the Trump administration, this one seeking to invalidate new grant conditions that U.S. Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions III sought to place on a group of U.S. Department of Justice grants for local law enforcement. Those grant conditions were issued after the district court had issued a preliminary injunction in April 2017 that halted enforcement of the sanctuary executive order as the case proceeded. =Climate change= Herrera on September 19, 2017 sued the top five investor-owned fossil fuel companies seeking billions of dollars for infrastructure needed to protect San Francisco against sea-level rise caused by global warming from their products. At a March 2018 climate change tutorial requested by the judge, the fossil fuel companies were compelled to acknowledge that the science of global warming is no longer in dispute. =Uber and Lyft= In 2017 and 2018, Herrera launched investigations into Uber and Lyft over driver pay and benefits, accessibility, discrimination, public safety issues and potential violations of other state and local laws. = Equifax = On September 26, 2017, San Francisco became the first city in the country to sue Equifax for failing to protect the personal data of more than 15 million Californians, part of a data breach that compromised the personal information of 143 million U.S. consumers. = Hertz = Herrera sued the rental car company and its affiliate on March 2, 2017 for charging drivers hidden fees when they cross the Golden Gate Bridge. = Airbnb and HomeAway = Herrera successfully defended San Francisco's short-term rental regulations from legal challenge by Airbnb and HomeAway and secured a settlement in May 2017 that requires the companies to ensure that listings on their site comply with San Francisco law, protecting rent-controlled apartments from being used as de facto hotels. =Bail reform= Herrera declared in November 2016 that the state's current cash bail system is unconstitutional and refused to defend it in a federal class-action lawsuit brought by a national civil rights group against San Francisco's sheriff. This led to a legislative drive to reform the state's system where the only factor in deciding whether an inmate is freed prior to appearing before a judge is if they can pay the amount on the bail schedule. = Academy of Art University = In December 2016, Herrera reached a settlement with Academy of Art University valued at more than $60 million in cash and property to house low- income seniors. The for-profit academy for years had violated state and local laws in its aggressive acquisition and use of vast real estate holdings in San Francisco. = Tenant Protections = In May 2017, Herrera secured a court victory that got tenant evictions voided and $5.4 million in court awards against abusive landlord Anne Kihagi, had worked to force tenants from their rent-controlled homes so she could charge more money. =Gun control litigation= Herrera has been involved in a number of high-profile cases against the National Rifle Association and other gun rights advocates, both to defend San Francisco's gun control measures and to challenge gun industry practices. He also filed lawsuits in 2013 and 2017 against several companies for flouting state and local law by selling complete but disassembled large- capacity gun magazines as \\"repair kits.\\" He secured settlements ending sales to customers in California of these devices. = City College of San Francisco = Herrera sued the accrediting agency that was unlawfully trying to close City College of San Francisco on August 22, 2013. He won preliminary injunction motion that halted the termination action and secured injunctions to protect City College's rights in the evaluation process. = Art Institute of California = Herrera investigated the Art Institute of California's deceptive marketing practices that underestimated student costs and inflated job placement figures, resulting in a settlement in 2014 that included a $1.95 million payment to San Francisco, endowing a $1.6 million scholarship fund for students who wished to return to finish their studies and offering $850,000 in general scholarships to new students. = Blue Cross = Herrera sued Blue Cross and Health Net in 2011, alleging that these insurance companies systematically underpaid San Francisco General Hospital and other public hospitals for emergency services provided to their policy-holders. He reached a $6.25 million settlement for past claims and an agreement to reimburse at a higher rate for at least three years going forward. = Citi Apartments = On August 16, 2006, Herrera sued CitiApartments for unlawful business and tenant harassment practices, which forced out rent-controlled tenants to allow higher rents to be charged for the same units. The subsequent settlement, with penalties up to $10 million, put the company out of business. =Nevada \\"patient dumping\\"= After The Sacramento Bee discovered that mental patients in Nevada were being bused to various California cities without any supervision or plan for what they would do upon arrival, Herrera opened an investigation that found that dozens of these patients had been shipped to San Francisco. Herrera brought a class-action lawsuit against Nevada in 2013 that was settled in 2015 with Nevada agreeing to provide travel assistance to California only for patients who meet appropriate criteria, ensuring that the patients are returning to a home address or to a medical facility or program, and that they will be received or accompanied by a responsible individual. Nevada also agreed to provide San Francisco with semi-annual reports about these patients with information that includes the date of discharge, destination city, and name of individuals at any medical facility that has agreed to receive the patient. Nevada also agreed to pay San Francisco $400,000. =Marriage equality for same-sex couples= Herrera has been involved in every phase of the legal fight for marriage equality for same-sex couples in California. In 2009, he joined the City of San Francisco as a plaintiff in the case of Perry v. Schwarzenegger, seeking to overturn the state's ban on same-sex marriage, the first time any government entity had sued to challenge marriage laws discriminating against gay and lesbian couples. Los Angeles City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo and Santa Clara County Counsel Ann M. Ravel would also join their jurisdictions as plaintiffs in the suit. In San Francisco's petition to the California Supreme Court, Herrera said: \\"The issue before the court today is of far greater consequence than marriage equality alone ... Equal protection of the laws is not merely the cornerstone of the California Constitution, it is what separates constitutional democracy from mob rule tyranny. If allowed to stand, Prop 8 so devastates the principle of equal protection that it endangers the fundamental rights of any potential electoral minority‚Äîeven for protected classes based on race, religion, national origin and gender. The proponents of Prop 8 waged a ruthless campaign of falsehood and fear, funded by millions of dollars from out-of-state interest groups. Make no mistake that their success in California has dramatically raised the stakes. What began as a struggle for marriage equality is today a fight for equality itself. I am confident that our high court will again demonstrate its principled independence in recognizing this danger, and in reasserting our constitution's promise of equality under the law.\\" Proposition 8 was eventually held to violate the United States Constitution by federal district court judge Vaughn R. Walker on August 4, 2010, a decision that was left intact by the United States Supreme Court on June 26, 2013. Same-sex marriages began again in California two days later. = Payday Lenders = After filing litigation against predatory payday lenders Money Mart and Check 'n Go on April 26, 2007, Herrera forced them to repay 10,000 California consumers $7.7 million and forgive another $8 million in debt. =Healthy San Francisco= When the Healthy San Francisco Initiative became law in 2006, establishing universal health care in the City, Herrera successfully defended the law's constitutionality against legal challenge. When some of the fees earmarked for the initiative were misappropriated by San Francisco restaurants, he convinced some of the restaurants to participate in a voluntary settlement program that recovered $844,000 for their employees. =Arbitration providers= On March 24, 2008, Herrera filed a lawsuit against the National Arbitration Forum and two other arbitration providers, alleging that the defendants were not neutral as they claimed in arbitration disputes between credit card companies and their customers, but were instead heavily biased in favor of lenders, calling NAF \\"little more than a collection agent masquerading as a neutral party.\\" He alleged that NAF's records showed that consumers prevailed in just 0.2% of arbitration cases that went to a hearing. Run for mayor In August 2010, Herrera announced that he would run in the 2011 San Francisco Mayoral Election. He ultimately finished third. Personal life Dennis and his wife Anne first met in 1999, and were married 10 months later.

Theory behind the metaphor There are many theories that explain the evolution of identity. The identity is something that is not set in stone, but rather it is something that is constantly re-purposing itself and changing. According to the skeptical post-modern theories, the self cannot be based on a foundation of mere experiences because a constant flow of information is streaming through the mind and changing the very way people identify with themselves and their environment. To remedy this, post- structuralist theorists expanded on this because of the infinite way significance can be perceived by way of knowledge in language.Williams, J. (2014). Understanding Poststructuralism. Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge. The relationship between words and what they symbolize is constantly evolving which creates the notion that identity and the self is \\"a product and effect of competing, fragmentary and contradictory discourses.\\" This leads to the comparison of the self to a crystal. Crystals are multidimensional much like identity. No matter the condition, crystals are still able to exist in different states, sizes, and colors. The more the crystal endures throughout its existence, the more complex and unique it becomes. Identity, on the other hand, becomes more complex and unique by way of discourse and language-base, thus leading to the metaphor known as the \\"crystallized self\\". Alternative metaphor An alternative metaphor is the \\"crystallized self\\", a notion that pulls from Laurel Richardson‚Äôs (2001) epistemological notion of \\"crystallization\\". The \\"crystallized self\\" is considered a positive term that helps people to experience and talk about the self in more appropriately politicized and layered ways. Tracy and Tretheway say: \\"The crystallized self is neither real nor fake.... The crystallized self is multidimensional; the more facets, the more beautiful and complex. Certainly crystals may feel solid, stable, and fixed. But just as crystals have differing forms, depending upon whether they grow rapidly or slowly, under constant or fluctuating conditions, or from highly variable or remarkably uniform fluids or gasses, crystallized selves have different shapes depending on the various discourses through which they are constructed and constrained\\".Tracy & Trethewey, 2005, p. 186 Viewing the self as crystallized moves away from ideas of which parts of the self are more \\"authentic\\" and rather suggests that the self is constructed through context and communication. Multiple facets can be \\"real\\" and competing simultaneously. See also *Identity (social science) *True self and false self References *Deetz, S. (1998).

Since 2012, the playoffs for each league‚ÄîAmerican and National‚Äîconsist of a one-game wild- card playoff between two wild card teams, four best-of-five Division Series (LDS) featuring the wild-card winner and the winner of each division, and finally the best-of-seven League Championship Series (LCS). The winners of the American League Championship Series (ALCS) and the National League Championship Series (NLCS) play each other in the best-of-seven World Series. The current system allows for a maximum of 43 postseason games and a minimum of 26 games. Format history=Before 1969: World Series only= Major League Baseball is the oldest of America's major professional sports organizations, steeped in tradition with roots dating back to the 1870s. The final series to determine its champion has been called the \\"World Series\\" (originally \\"World's Championship Series\\" and then \\"World's Series\\") as far back as the National League's contests with the American Association starting at the beginning of the 1880s. From 1901 to 1968, the American and National League teams with the best win-loss records in their respective leagues would win their league's championship, or pennant. In 1903, modern annual postseason play began with a one-round system, in which the American League champion would play the National League champion in a best-of-seven series (in 1903, 1919, 1920, and 1921 it was best-of-nine) called the World Series; however, there was no 1904 Series because the National League champion New York Giants refused to play. This single-tiered approach persisted through 1968, even with the expansions of 1961‚Äì1962 that expanded both leagues to 10 teams. =1969‚Äì1993: Two rounds= In 1969, both leagues expanded to twelve teams, which made it more difficult to compete for a league championship because there were more teams competing for the AL and NL pennants. In addition, a team would play other clubs in its own region of the country more than clubs in the rest of the country, creating an unbalanced schedule that in some years could give a team from one region an advantage in fighting for a single pennant. To remedy this, and imitating the other major sports' long-standing playoff traditions, Major League Baseball split each league into Eastern and Western divisions, creating four divisions overall and no worse than a sixth- place finish for any team in any division until later expansions in 1977 and 1993. This created a new postseason round called the League Championship Series (LCS), in which the Eastern and Western division champions of each league would play a best-of-five series to determine the league champion. In 1985 the LCS was expanded to a best-of-seven series. Under this system, it was possible for one of the best teams in a league to be left out of the postseason if it failed to win its division. Most notably, in , the Atlanta Braves and San Francisco Giants finished with the two best records in the majors, with 104 and 103 wins, respectively. However, since both teams played in the National League West division, the Giants missed the postseason by a single game. The baseball players' strike of 1981 uniquely‚Äîfor this era‚Äîadded another round to the postseason. Because the strike split the season into two roughly equal halves, the division winners of each half of the 1981 season first met in a best-of-five Division Series. The winners of the division series then progressed to the league championship series, with the remainder of the postseason following a similar format to other years in this era. =1994‚Äì2011: Three rounds= Major League Baseball went through a realignment in 1994, when both the American and National Leagues expanded to three divisions: Eastern, Central, and Western. To avoid a playoff with an odd number of divisional winners, the league added a wild card playoff spot to each league, imitating the original post-merger NFL system. The wild-card for each league would be the team with the best record that did not win its division, eliminating a circumstance where a team with the second-best record in the entire league would miss the playoff because of not winning its division. This new format doubled the postseason contenders in each league from two to four, and from four teams overall to eight. The addition of a second wild card spot occurred in 2012. The additional teams meant another elimination round was necessary. This new round would become the new first round of the postseason, the best-of-five Division Series. This term had first been used for the extra round required in 1981 due to the \\"split-season\\" scheduling anomaly following the midseason baseball players strike. This format was in place for the 1994 season, but that year's players' strike canceled the postseason. The format was realized on the field in 1995. Under this format, in the two Divisional Series, the wild card team played the divisional champion outside its own division that had the better record, with the remaining two teams playing each other in the second Division Series for each league. The two Division Series winners from each league go on to play each other in the League Championship Series. As with the previous postseason format, the winners of each League Championship Series met in the World Series. =2012‚Äìpresent: Expanded wild card= With the adoption of the new collective bargaining agreement in November 2011, baseball commissioner Bud Selig announced that a new playoff system would begin within two years; the change was ultimately put into place in 2012. The format chosen was the one- game wild-card playoff. Under this format, a second wild card team has been added to each league, i.e., the team with the second-highest win total in each league among non-division winners. The two wild card teams play in a one-game playoff after the end of the regular season, with the winner advancing to the Division Series. The divisional champions qualify for the Division Series just as in the previous format; however, under the expanded wild card format the winner of the one-game wild card playoff faces the top-seeded divisional champion in the Division Series, regardless of whether the two teams are in the same division, while the second- and third-seeded divisional champions play each other in the other Division Series. The format for placement in the League Championship Series and World Series remains. =Expansion proposals and 2020 format= MLB is proposing to expand the playoffs to 14 teams; once the current collective bargaining agreement expires in 2021, the change may happen in 2022. There could be four wild card teams & three division winners per league. Only the division winner with the best record gets a first-round bye into the Division Series. The proposed first-round format will be best-of- three series, with the higher seeds hosting every game. The second seed may choose to play the fifth, sixth or seventh-seeded team; then the third seed from remaining two; with the fourth playing the remaining team. No changes will be made for the rest of the playoffs. By default, the second hosts the seventh, the third hosts the sixth & the fourth the fifth. During the suspension of the 2020 MLB season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all proposals put forward during negotiations between the MLB and Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) included a temporarily expanded postseason. The various proposals included 16-team formats and included the 2020 and (in some proposals) 2021 seasons. However, the eventual lack of a negotiated season structure initially resulted in the 2020 season being intended to use with the 10-team format. On July 23, 2020, MLBPA and the owners agreed to expand to a 16 team playoff structure for the 2020 season. The round will be called the Wild Card Series. The format will consist of eight teams from each league, seeded in the following order: division winners by record (1-3), runner-up teams by record (4-6), and the two best teams remaining (7-8). All games in this format will be best of three, and will be played at the home ballparks of the higher seeds. All other series (LDS, LCS, and World Series) will remain as is. The WCS pairings will be as follows: top seed vs. eighth, second vs. seventh, third vs. sixth, and fourth vs. fifth. The DS will have the 1-8 winner play the 4-5 winner, while the 2-7 winner plays the 3-6 winner. Home- field advantage=World Series= The World Series used several different formats in its early years. Initially it generally followed an alternating home-and-away pattern, except that if a seventh game was possible, its site was determined by coin toss prior to the sixth game. In 1924 the Series began using a 2-3-2 format, presumably to save on travel costs, a pattern that has continued to this day with the exception of a couple of the World War II years when wartime travel restrictions compelled a 3-4 format (used in 1943 and 1945, but not in the 1944 series, which was contested between crosstown rivals the St. Louis Browns and St. Louis Cardinals; all games were held in the same stadium in St. Louis). From the start of the 2-3-2 format through the 2002 season, home-field advantage generally alternated between leagues each year. Prior to the 1994 strike, the National League champion received home-field advantage in even-numbered years and the American League champion in odd- numbered years; these were reversed for 1995‚Äì2002 (because 1994 would have been the NL's turn to have home-field, but the World Series was cancelled by the aforementioned strike). That changed starting in 2003. The 2002 All-Star Game had ended in a tie, much to the displeasure of both fans and sportswriters who complained about a lack of intensity and competitiveness on the part of the players. This hit especially close to home for Commissioner Bud Selig, as the game had been played in his home city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In response, to give some real meaning to the game, in 2003 MLB began assigning home-field advantage in the World Series to the winner of that year's All-Star Game, which is typically held in mid-July. Following the acceptance of a new collective bargaining agreement after the 2016 season, home-field advantage in the World Series is no longer tied to the outcome of the All-Star Game, but instead goes to the team with the better regular-season record. One exception is 2020, when it will be played at a neutral site for all those games. =League Championship Series= Until 1998, the LCS alternated home-field advantage with a 2-3 format in the best-of-5 era (1969‚Äì84) and a 2-3-2 format when it went to best-of-7 (1985‚Äìpresent). Since 1998, the team with the better record has had home field advantage, but a wild card team can never secure the extra home game, regardless of regular-season records. =Division Series= Until 1997, the Division Series rotated in which one of the three division-winning teams did not have home field- advantage, with the wild card team never having it. Since 1998, the two division winners with the best records in each league have home field, with the least-winning divisional winner and the wild card do not have home field. The Division Series used a 2‚Äì3 format until 1998 and now uses a 2‚Äì2‚Äì1 format. This is seen as a more fair distribution of home-field advantage because previously under the 2-3 format, the team hosting the first two games had absolutely no chance of winning the series at home. With the current 2-2-1 format however, both teams have the home-field advantage in a sense. While one team gets to host three games (including the critical first and last game), the other team does get two chances out of three (games 3 and 4) of winning the series on its home field. With the adoption of the expanded playoff format in 2012, the five-game Division Series began with two home games for the lower seeds, followed by up to three home games for the higher seeds. This one-year change eliminated a travel day prior to a decisive Game 5 of a Division Series and was necessary because the 2012 regular-season schedule was announced before the agreement on the new postseason was reached. Since 2013, the Division Series restored the 2-2-1 format. = Wild Card Game = Before 2012, the Wild Card team played the team with the best record that was not from their division. With the addition of a second Wild Card team the Wild Card Game was created. The Wild Card Game is a one game playoff to determine who advances to the next round of the playoffs to take on the team with the best overall record in their respective league. The 4th seeded team or 1st Wild Card hosts the 5th seeded or 2nd Wild Card. This has caused some controversy in that some people want a three game series to determine a winner instead of an elimination game to make the playoffs more fair. The 2020 implementation of the Wild Card Series will have all three games hosted at the higher seed, to reduce travel and to reward regular season performance. Postseason bonuses There are three factors that determine the actual amount of bonus money paid to any individual player: (1) the size of the bonus pool; (2) their team's success in the season/post-season; and (3) the share of the pool assigned to the individual player. =How the bonus pool is determined= There is a separate pool for each series ‚Äì the Wild Card games, the Division Series, the League Championship Series, and the World Series. The players' bonus pool is funded with 60% of the gate receipts for each of the Wild Card games, the first three games of each Division Series, the first four games of each LCS and the first four games of the World Series; limiting the funding for the pool to these games, the minimum number in each series, removes incentive to extend the series for merely fiscal sake. The value of the gate is determined by the size of the venues, the amount of high-priced premium seating in the venues, the number of games played in the series and whether the games sell out. Ticket prices for each series are set by MLB, not the home teams, so they are relatively uniform across baseball. =How much the winner and loser receives from each pool= The World Series winner gets 36%, the World Series loser gets 24%, both League Championship Series losers get 12%, the four Division Series losers get 3.25%, and the two Wild Card playoff losers get 1.5%. In 2020, the eight Wild Card Series losers got 0.375%. =How the team's share of the pool is divided= The division of the team's share of the pool is voted upon by the players who have been on the team during the entire regular season, in a meeting chaired by their union representative. This meeting follows the trade deadline on July 31. Players who have been with the team for the full season automatically receive a full share. At the meeting, the full-season players vote on whether anyone else‚Äîincluding players who have not been with the team for the full season, coaches, and trainers‚Äîis to be granted a full share, less than a full share, a cash award, or no share. After the World Series, the pool of money is split according to the shares determined in the vote. There is no limit to the number of shares that may be granted, but a greater number of shares dilutes the value of each share, and consequently the amount each player is awarded. As an example, playoff-pool full-share holders for the St. Louis Cardinals received each when the team won the World Series in 2006.

History  The monastery, dedicated to Saint Vitus, was established as Pr√ºll Abbey, a Benedictine foundation, in 997 by Gebhard I, Bishop of Regensburg, and his brother Rapoto. In about 1100 the Ottonian church building was replaced by a Romanesque hall church, the first of the sort in Bavaria. In 1484 Pr√ºll became a Carthusian monastery, with the support of Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria, and later his son William IV. Substantial additions were made to the buildings to adapt them for Carthusian use. In the church additional choirs were built, stained glass from which is now in the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum in Munich. It was dissolved in 1803 in the secularisation of Bavaria. The monastery church fell into decay. Half of the monks' cells, the chapter room, the refectory and the library were demolished. What remained of the premises was acquired in 1835 by the Bavarian state. In 1852 a lunatic asylum was accommodated here. Today the buildings are the home of the Regensburg District Clinic (Bezirksklinikum Regensburg).

The Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge Tunnel runs along a strip of I-664 to I-64 across the James River. To the west of the harbor, are the mouths of the James River (upper left) and the Nansemond River (lower left). Crossing the James River, the -long James River Bridge is also clearly visible, connecting Newport News with Isle of Wight County. NASA photograph Historically, the harbor was the key to the Hampton Roads area's growth, both on land and in water-related activities and events. Ironically, the harbor and its tributary waterways were (and still are) both important transportation conduits and obstacles to other land-based commerce and travel. For hundreds of years, state and community leaders have worked to develop solutions to accommodate both. Many early bridges were constructed and funded privately through the collection of tolls. Later, state-sponsorship was required to fund larger projects. The best example of many was in 1957, when the world's first continuous bridge-tunnel complex was successfully completed across the mouth of the Hampton Roads harbor, innovatively designed and funded with toll revenue bonds. Soon, another even larger one was built across the entire mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, exceeding many expectations. In modern times, the region has faced increasing transportation challenges as it has become largely urbanized, with additional traffic needs. In the 21st century, the conflicts between traffic on vital waterways and land-based travel continue to present the area's leaders with extraordinary transportation challenges, both for additional capacity, and as the existing infrastructure, much of it originally built with toll revenues, has aged without an adequate source of funding to repair or build replacements. The now-closed Kings Highway Bridge in Suffolk and the Jordan Bridge in neighboring Chesapeake, each built in the 1920s, are considered locally prime examples of this situation. Public opinion polls seem to indicate that many citizens feel the accomplishments with the historic bridge- tunnels across the harbor and nearby Chesapeake Bay and the many other improvements since, such as the completion of the Hampton Roads Beltway and a third bridge-tunnel (second across the harbor) in 1992 are indicative that the region's leaders will be capable of seeking and employing new transportation and funding solutions for the future, and that they will receive the necessary public support to do so. In 2007, the new Hampton Roads Transportation Authority (HRTA) was formed under a controversial state law to levy various additional taxes to generate funding for major regional transportation projects, including a long-sought and costly so-called third crossing of the harbor of Hampton Roads. As of March 2008, although its projects were considered to be needed, the agency's future was in some question while its controversial sources of funding were being reconsidered in light of a Virginia Supreme Court decision. In the time since, a shift to facilities to be developed and maintained by public-private partnerships collecting tolls has come into greater focus. One such project, a replacement for the Jordan Bridge, is already under construction. Highways, bridges, tunnels, bridge- tunnels, ferry system right The Hampton Roads area has an extensive network of Interstate Highways, including the Interstate 64, the major east-west route to and from the area, and its spurs and bypasses of I-264, I-464, I-564, and I-664. Long-term plans being pushed by the Raleigh-Durham area's Regional Transportation Alliance call for extension of I-495 northeastward to the Hampton Roads area. RTA's plan envisions the entirety of the corridor from Raleigh to Norfolk receiving a new two-digit interstate designation such as I-44. This interstate would connect two of the United States' largest metropolitan areas still lacking direct interstate access between each other. The Hampton Roads Beltway extends on a long loop through the region, crossing the harbor on two toll-free bridge-tunnel facilities. These crossings are the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel between Phoebus in Hampton and Willoughby Spit in Norfolk and the Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel between Newport News and Suffolk. The Beltway connects with another Interstate highway and three arterial U.S. Highways at Bower's Hill near the northeastern edge of the Great Dismal Swamp. Other major east-west routes are U.S. Route 58, U.S. Route 60, and U.S. Route 460. The major north-south routes are U.S. Route 13 and U.S. Route 17. Another major crossing of waterways is the James River Bridge, carrying US 17, US 258, and SR 32 from Newport News to Isle of Wight County. There are also two other tunnels in the area, the Midtown Tunnel, and the Downtown Tunnel joining Portsmouth and Norfolk, as well as the -long Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, a toll facility which links the region with Virginia's Eastern Shore which carries US 13. The original Downtown Tunnel in conjunction with the Berkley Bridge were considered a single bridge and tunnel complex when completed in 1952, perhaps stimulating the innovative bridge- tunnel design using man-made islands when the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel was planned, first opening in 1957. The George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge is a major toll bridge connecting U.S. Highway 17 on the Peninsula at Yorktown with Virginia's Middle Peninsula region. Although earlier ferry services across the Bay, the harbor, and various rivers were eventually supplanted in the 20th century by bridges, tunnels, and bridge-tunnels, a passenger ferry continues to operate between Norfolk and Portsmouth, and one major automobile ferry service also remains. The Jamestown Ferry (also known as the Jamestown- Scotland Ferry) is an automobile ferry system on the James River connecting Jamestown in James City County with Scotland in Surry County. It carries State Route 31. Operated by VDOT, it is the only 24-hour state-run ferry operation in Virginia and has over 90 employees. It operates four ferryboats, the Pocahontas, the Williamsburg, the Surry, and the Virginia. The facility is toll-free. Local public transportation Ferry Between Norfolk and Portsmouth Local public transit is provided by a bus network operated by the Hampton Roads Transit (HRT) and Williamsburg Area Transit Authority (WATA), both of which are operations of government agencies. HRT's The Tide light rail system has completed construction and opened in early 2011. In Virginia, the region is notable in that it has 2 types of public transport services via ferrys. A passenger ferry is operated on the Elizabeth River between downtown areas of Norfolk and Portsmouth by HRT. A commuter bus route across the James River between Williamsburg and rural Surry County is provided via the vehicle- carrying Jamestown Ferry system. =Hampton Roads Transit= A regional transit bus system and paratransit services and the future Tide light rail system are provided by Hampton Roads Transit (HRT), a regional public transport system headquartered in Hampton. The HRT service area include the major population centers of Hampton Roads which are linked to each other by the Hampton Roads Beltway. Commuter service is provided through both major bridge-tunnels across the harbor helps reduce congestion in many other high traffic corridors. Many areas in adjoining communities are also served. As the largest transit operator, Hampton Roads Transit is southeastern Virginia's most reliable mobility source, serving over 17 million annual passengers in the Hampton Roads metropolitan area. HRT currently serves 1.2 million people within its service area. =Williamsburg Area Transit Authority= A line of WAT transit buses equipped with 2-way radios, wheelchair lifts and bike racks are seen ready for service at the Williamsburg Bus Facility on U.S. Route 60 in James City County, Virginia. Williamsburg Transportation Center is an intermodal facility located in a restored Chesapeake and Ohio Railway station located within walking distance of Colonial Williamsburg's Historic Area, the College of William and Mary, and the downtown area. In the upper (western) Peninsula area known as the Historic Triangle, a transit bus system and paratransit services are provided by Williamsburg Area Transit Authority (WATA), based in the Williamsburg area, which serves Williamsburg, James City County, and a portion of York County. The system offers a connection with the much larger Hampton Roads Transit system at Lee Hall, Virginia and at the Williamsburg Transportation Center. The Williamsburg Transportation Center is located in a restored building which was formerly a Chesapeake and Ohio Railway station. Along the railroad line built to connect the Ohio River Valley with the new city of Newport News and the port of Hampton Roads by Collis P. Huntington in 1881, the station was originally built in 1935 with funding from John D. Rockefeller Jr. as part of the restoration of the colonial capital which became known worldwide as Colonial Williamsburg. During the heyday of the railroads, dozens of dignitaries arrived there, including Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower and Winston Churchill. In modern times, the center offers good non-automobile driving alternatives for visitors and citizens, both getting there, and moving around locally, with rail service, intercity and local transit bus services. =Light rail, bus rapid transit, maglev projects= A light rail service known as The Tide was opened in Norfolk on August 19, 2011 and extends 7.4 miles from the Eastern Virginia Medical Center complex east through downtown Norfolk and adjacent to I-264 to Newtown Road. Operated by Hampton Roads Transit, it is the first major light rail service in the state. As of April 17, 2012, the daily ridership was estimated to be 4,900.\\"One Million Tide Rides\\", Hampton Roads Transit April 16, 2012 The Virginia Beach Transit Extension Study is examining the best transit options for possibly extending The Tide or adding bus rapid transit from Newtown Road to the Virginia Beach Oceanfront. There has also been a light rail study in the Hampton - Newport News areas. There is a small very experimental Magnetic levitation project under development on campus at Old Dominion University in Norfolk. Using a new experimental technology, it was not yet operational as of 2011. Intercity bus Intercity bus service is provided by Greyhound Lines and Carolina Trailways. Passenger rail The area is served by passenger rail service provided by Amtrak, with stations in Williamsburg, Newport News, and Norfolk, and connecting bus service to Virginia Beach. The Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation has studies underway for extending high speed passenger rail to the Virginia Peninsula and South Hampton Roads areas with a rail connection at Richmond to the Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor. Air The Hampton Roads is served by two major commercial airports: Norfolk International Airport and the smaller Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport. Alternatively, some travelers from the Peninsula and Williamsburg area also sometimes use Richmond International Airport, located west of Williamsburg and east of Richmond in Henrico County, Virginia. =Norfolk International Airport= Norfolk International Airport (ORF) is the main air passenger and cargo transport hub in the region. Offering nearly 160 arrivals and departures daily to major cities throughout the US, Norfolk International presently ranks in the country's top 65 airports in terms of passengers served annually, with an average of 3.5 million. The airport is served by five airlines, with flights to 25 nonstop destinations: *Allegiant Air - Nonstop flights to Fort Lauderdale, Jacksonville (seasonal service), Orlando/Sanford, and St. Petersburg/Clearwater *American Airlines - Nonstop flights to Charlotte and Dallas-Fort Worth *American Eagle - Nonstop flights to Charlotte, Chicago- O'Hare, Miami, New York-JFK, New York-LaGuardia, Philadelphia, and Washington-Reagan *Delta Air Lines - Nonstop flights to Atlanta *Delta Connection - Nonstop flights to Boston, Detroit, Minneapolis- St.Paul, New York-JFK, and New York-LaGuardia *Frontier Airlines - Nonstop flights to Denver (seasonal service), Las Vegas, and Orlando (seasonal service) *Southwest Airlines - Nonstop flights to Baltimore-Washington, Chicago-Midway, Denver (seasonal service), and Orlando *United Airlines - Nonstop flights to Chicago-O'Hare (seasonal service), Denver, and Washington- Dulles (seasonal service) *United Express - Nonstop flights to Chicago-O'Hare, Houston-Intercontinental, Newark, and Washington-Dulles =Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport= Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport (PHF) (formerly known as Patrick Henry Field) is a regional air passenger transport hub in southeastern Virginia. The airport, which is among the fastest growing airports in the country (by passenger volume), serves an average of 1.5 million annual passengers, and is served by four (4) airlines, with flights to twelve nonstop destinations. It is the hub for up-start low-cost carrier People Express Airlines, which takes its name from the famous 1970s airline of the same name.

There are several sets of axioms which give rise to Euclidean geometry or to non- Euclidean geometries. These are fundamental to the study and of historical importance, but there are a great many modern geometries that are not Euclidean which can be studied from this viewpoint. The term axiomatic geometry can be applied to any geometry that is developed from an axiom system, but is often used to mean Euclidean geometry studied from this point of view. The completeness and independence of general axiomatic systems are important mathematical considerations, but there are also issues to do with the teaching of geometry which come into play. Axiomatic systems Based on ancient Greek methods, an axiomatic system is a formal description of a way to establish the mathematical truth that flows from a fixed set of assumptions. Although applicable to any area of mathematics, geometry is the branch of elementary mathematics in which this method has most extensively been successfully applied. There are several components of an axiomatic system. # Primitives (undefined terms) are the most basic ideas. Typically they include objects and relationships. In geometry, the objects are things like points, lines and planes while a fundamental relationship is that of incidence ‚Äì of one object meeting or joining with another. The terms themselves are undefined. Hilbert once remarked that instead of points, lines and planes one might just as well talk of tables, chairs and beer mugs. His point being that the primitive terms are just empty shells, place holders if you will, and have no intrinsic properties. # Axioms (or postulates) are statements about these primitives; for example, any two points are together incident with just one line (i.e. that for any two points, there is just one line which passes through both of them). Axioms are assumed true, and not proven. They are the building blocks of geometric concepts, since they specify the properties that the primitives have. # The laws of logic. # The theoremsIn this context no distinction is made between different categories of theorems. Propositions, lemmas, corollaries, etc. are all treated the same. are the logical consequences of the axioms, that is, the statements that can be obtained from the axioms by using the laws of deductive logic. An interpretation of an axiomatic system is some particular way of giving concrete meaning to the primitives of that system. If this association of meanings makes the axioms of the system true statements, then the interpretation is called a model of the system. In a model, all the theorems of the system are automatically true statements. =Properties of axiomatic systems= In discussing axiomatic systems several properties are often focused on: * The axioms of an axiomatic system are said to be consistent if no logical contradiction can be derived from them. Except in the simplest systems, consistency is a difficult property to establish in an axiomatic system. On the other hand, if a model exists for the axiomatic system, then any contradiction derivable in the system is also derivable in the model, and the axiomatic system is as consistent as any system in which the model belongs. This property (having a model) is referred to as relative consistency or model consistency. * An axiom is called independent if it can not be proved or disproved from the other axioms of the axiomatic system. An axiomatic system is said to be independent if each of its axioms is independent. If a true statement is a logical consequence of an axiomatic system, then it will be a true statement in every model of that system. To prove that an axiom is independent of the remaining axioms of the system, it is sufficient to find two models of the remaining axioms, for which the axiom is a true statement in one and a false statement in the other. Independence is not always a desirable property from a pedagogical viewpoint. * An axiomatic system is called complete if every statement expressible in the terms of the system is either provable or has a provable negation. Another way to state this is that no independent statement can be added to a complete axiomatic system which is consistent with axioms of that system. * An axiomatic system is categorical if any two models of the system are isomorphic (essentially, there is only one model for the system). A categorical system is necessarily complete, but completeness does not imply categoricity. In some situations categoricity is not a desirable property, since categorical axiomatic systems can not be generalized. For instance, the value of the axiomatic system for group theory is that it is not categorical, so proving a result in group theory means that the result is valid in all the different models for group theory and one doesn't have to reprove the result in each of the non-isomorphic models. Euclidean geometry Euclidean geometry is a mathematical system attributed to the Alexandrian Greek mathematician Euclid, which he described (although non-rigorously by modern standards) in his textbook on geometry: the Elements. Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms, and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians, Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and logical system. The Elements begins with plane geometry, still taught in secondary school as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of formal proof. It goes on to the solid geometry of three dimensions. Much of the Elements states results of what are now called algebra and number theory, explained in geometrical language. For over two thousand years, the adjective \\"Euclidean\\" was unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived. Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious (with the possible exception of the parallel postulate) that any theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute, often metaphysical, sense. Today, however, many other geometries which are not Euclidean are known, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century. =Euclid's Elements= Euclid's Elements is a mathematical and geometric treatise consisting of 13 books written by the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid in Alexandria c. 300 BC. It is a collection of definitions, postulates (axioms), propositions (theorems and constructions), and mathematical proofs of the propositions. The thirteen books cover Euclidean geometry and the ancient Greek version of elementary number theory. With the exception of Autolycus' On the Moving Sphere, the Elements is one of the oldest extant Greek mathematical treatises, and it is the oldest extant axiomatic deductive treatment of mathematics. It has proven instrumental in the development of logic and modern science. Euclid's Elements has been referred to as the most successfulEncyclopedia of Ancient Greece (2006) by Nigel Guy Wilson, page 278. Published by Routledge Taylor and Francis Group. Quote:\\"Euclid's Elements subsequently became the basis of all mathematical education, not only in the Romand and Byzantine periods, but right down to the mid-20th century, and it could be argued that it is the most successful textbook ever written.\\" and influential textbook ever written. Being first set in type in Venice in 1482, it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by Carl Benjamin Boyer to be second only to the Bible in the number of editions published, with the number reaching well over one thousand.The Historical Roots of Elementary Mathematics by Lucas Nicolaas Hendrik Bunt, Phillip S. Jones, Jack D. Bedient (1988), page 142. Dover publications. Quote:\\"the Elements became known to Western Europe via the Arabs and the Moors. There the Elements became the foundation of mathematical education. More than 1000 editions of the Elements are known. In all probability it is, next to the Bible, the most widely spread book in the civilization of the Western world.\\" For centuries, when the quadrivium was included in the curriculum of all university students, knowledge of at least part of Euclid's Elements was required of all students. Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.From the introduction by Amit Hagar to Euclid and His Modern Rivals by Lewis Carroll (2009, Barnes & Noble) pg. xxviii: > Geometry emerged as an indispensable part of the standard education of the > English gentleman in the eighteenth century; by the Victorian period it was > also becoming an important part of the education of artisans, children at > Board Schools, colonial subjects and, to a rather lesser degree, women. ... > The standard textbook for this purpose was none other than Euclid's The > Elements. The Elements are mainly a systematization of earlier knowledge of geometry. It is assumed that its superiority over earlier treatments was recognized, with the consequence that there was little interest in preserving the earlier ones, and they are now nearly all lost. Books I‚ÄìIV and VI discuss plane geometry. Many results about plane figures are proved, e.g., If a triangle has two equal angles, then the sides subtended by the angles are equal. The Pythagorean theorem is proved.Euclid, book I, proposition 47 Books V and VII‚ÄìX deal with number theory, with numbers treated geometrically via their representation as line segments with various lengths. Notions such as prime numbers and rational and irrational numbers are introduced. The infinitude of prime numbers is proved. Books XI‚ÄìXIII concern solid geometry. A typical result is the 1:3 ratio between the volume of a cone and a cylinder with the same height and base. The parallel postulate: If two lines intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough. Near the beginning of the first book of the Elements, Euclid gives five postulates (axioms) for plane geometry, stated in terms of constructions (as translated by Thomas Heath): \\"Let the following be postulated\\": # \\"To draw a straight line from any point to any point.\\" # \\"To produce [extend] a finite straight line continuously in a straight line.\\" # \\"To describe a circle with any centre and distance [radius].\\" # \\"That all right angles are equal to one another.\\" # The parallel postulate: \\"That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.\\" Although Euclid's statement of the postulates only explicitly asserts the existence of the constructions, they are also assumed to produce unique objects. The success of the Elements is due primarily to its logical presentation of most of the mathematical knowledge available to Euclid. Much of the material is not original to him, although many of the proofs are supposedly his. Euclid's systematic development of his subject, from a small set of axioms to deep results, and the consistency of his approach throughout the Elements, encouraged its use as a textbook for about 2,000 years. The Elements still influences modern geometry books. Further, its logical axiomatic approach and rigorous proofs remain the cornerstone of mathematics. =A critique of Euclid= The standards of mathematical rigor have changed since Euclid wrote the Elements. Modern attitudes towards, and viewpoints of, an axiomatic system can make it appear that Euclid was in some way sloppy or careless in his approach to the subject, but this is an ahistorical illusion. It is only after the foundations were being carefully examined in response to the introduction of non-Euclidean geometry that what we now consider flaws began to emerge. Mathematician and historian W. W. Rouse Ball put these criticisms in perspective, remarking that \\"the fact that for two thousand years [the Elements] was the usual text-book on the subject raises a strong presumption that it is not unsuitable for that purpose.\\" Some of the main issues with Euclid's presentation are: * Lack of recognition of the concept of primitive terms, objects and notions that must be left undefined in the development of an axiomatic system. * The use of superposition in some proofs without there being an axiomatic justification of this method. * Lack of a concept of continuity which is needed to prove the existence of some points and lines that Euclid constructs. * Lack of clarity on whether a straight line is infinite or boundary-less in the second postulate. * Lack of the concept of betweeness used, among other things, for distinguishing between the inside and outside of various figures. Euclid's list of axioms in the Elements was not exhaustive, but represented the principles that seemed the most important. His proofs often invoke axiomatic notions which were not originally presented in his list of axioms. He does not go astray and prove erroneous things because of this since he is actually making use of implicit assumptions whose validity appears to be justified by the diagrams which accompany his proofs. Later mathematicians have incorporated Euclid's implicit axiomatic assumptions in the list of formal axioms, thereby greatly extending that list. For example, in the first construction of Book 1, Euclid used a premise that was neither postulated nor proved: that two circles with centers at the distance of their radius will intersect in two points. Later, in the fourth construction, he used superposition (moving the triangles on top of each other) to prove that if two sides and their angles are equal then they are congruent; during these considerations he uses some properties of superposition, but these properties are not described explicitly in the treatise. If superposition is to be considered a valid method of geometric proof, all of geometry would be full of such proofs. For example, propositions I.1 - I.3 can be proved trivially by using superposition. To address these issues in Euclid's work, later authors have either attempted to fill in the holes in Euclid's presentation-the most notable of these attempts is due to D. Hilbert-or to organize the axiom system around different concepts, as G.D. Birkhoff has done. =Pasch and Peano= The German mathematician Moritz Pasch (1843-1930) was the first to accomplish the task of putting Euclidean geometry on a firm axiomatic footing. In his book, Vorlesungen √ºber neuere Geometrie published in 1882, Pasch laid the foundations of the modern axiomatic method. He originated the concept of primitive notion (which he called Kernbegriffe) and together with the axioms (Kerns√§tzen) he constructs a formal system which is free from any intuitive influences. According to Pasch, the only place where intuition should play a role is in deciding what the primitive notions and axioms should be. Thus, for Pasch, point is a primitive notion but line (straight line) is not, since we have good intuition about points but no one has ever seen or had experience with an infinite line. The primitive notion that Pasch uses in its place is line segment. Pasch observed that the ordering of points on a line (or equivalently containment properties of line segments) is not properly resolved by Euclid's axioms; thus, Pasch's theorem, stating that if two line segment containment relations hold then a third one also holds, cannot be proven from Euclid's axioms. The related Pasch's axiom concerns the intersection properties of lines and triangles. Pasch's work on the foundations set the standard for rigor, not only in geometry but also in the wider context of mathematics. His breakthrough ideas are now so commonplace that it is difficult to remember that they had a single originator. Pasch's work directly influenced many other mathematicians, in particular D. Hilbert and the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano (1858-1932). Peano's 1889 work on geometry, largely a translation of Pasch's treatise into the notation of symbolic logic (which Peano invented), uses the primitive notions of point and betweeness. Peano breaks the empirical tie in the choice of primitive notions and axioms that Pasch required. For Peano, the entire system is purely formal, divorced from any empirical input. =Pieri and the Italian school of geometers= The Italian mathematician Mario Pieri (1860-1913) took a different approach and considered a system in which there were only two primitive notions, that of point and of motion. Pasch had used four primitives and Peano had reduced this to three, but both of these approaches relied on some concept of betweeness which Pieri replaced by his formulation of motion. In 1905 Pieri gave the first axiomatic treatment of complex projective geometry which did not start by building real projective geometry. Pieri was a member of a group of Italian geometers and logicians that Peano had gathered around himself in Turin. This group of assistants, junior colleagues and others were dedicated to carrying out Peano's logico-geometrical program of putting the foundations of geometry on firm axiomatic footing based on Peano's logical symbolism. Besides Pieri, Burali-Forti, Padoa and Fano were in this group. In 1900 there were two international conferences held back-to-back in Paris, the International Congress of Philosophy and the Second International Congress of Mathematicians. This group of Italian mathematicians was very much in evidence at these congresses, pushing their axiomatic agenda.Pieri did not attend since he had recently moved to Sicily, but he did have a paper of his read at the Congress of Philosophy. Padoa gave a well regarded talk and Peano, in the question period after David Hilbert's famous address on unsolved problems, remarked that his colleagues had already solved Hilbert's second problem. =Hilbert's axioms= David Hilbert At the University of G√∂ttingen, during the 1898-1899 winter term, the eminent German mathematician David Hilbert (1862-1943) presented a course of lectures on the foundations of geometry. At the request of Felix Klein, Professor Hilbert was asked to write up the lecture notes for this course in time for the summer 1899 dedication ceremony of a monument to C.F. Gauss and Wilhelm Weber to be held at the university. The rearranged lectures were published in June 1899 under the title Grundlagen der Geometrie (Foundations of Geometry). The influence of the book was immediate. According to : > By developing a postulate set for Euclidean geometry that does not depart > too greatly in spirit from Euclid's own, and by employing a minimum of > symbolism, Hilbert succeeded in convincing mathematicians to a far greater > extent than had Pasch and Peano, of the purely hypothetico-deductive nature > of geometry. But the influence of Hilbert's work went far beyond this, for, > backed by the author's great mathematical authority, it firmly implanted the > postulational method, not only in the field of geometry, but also in > essentially every other branch of mathematics. The stimulus to the > development of the foundations of mathematics provided by Hilbert's little > book is difficult to overestimate. Lacking the strange symbolism of the > works of Pasch and Peano, Hilbert's work can be read, in great part, by any > intelligent student of high school geometry. It is difficult to specify the axioms used by Hilbert without referring to the publication history of the Grundlagen since Hilbert changed and modified them several times. The original monograph was quickly followed by a French translation, in which Hilbert added V.2, the Completeness Axiom. An English translation, authorized by Hilbert, was made by E.J. Townsend and copyrighted in 1902. This translation incorporated the changes made in the French translation and so is considered to be a translation of the 2nd edition. Hilbert continued to make changes in the text and several editions appeared in German. The 7th edition was the last to appear in Hilbert's lifetime. New editions followed the 7th, but the main text was essentially not revised. The modifications in these editions occur in the appendices and in supplements. The changes in the text were large when compared to the original and a new English translation was commissioned by Open Court Publishers, who had published the Townsend translation. So, the 2nd English Edition was translated by Leo Unger from the 10th German edition in 1971. This translation incorporates several revisions and enlargements of the later German editions by Paul Bernays. The differences between the two English translations are due not only to Hilbert, but also to differing choices made by the two translators. What follows will be based on the Unger translation. Hilbert's axiom system is constructed with six primitive notions: point, line, plane, betweenness, lies on (containment), and congruence. All points, lines, and planes in the following axioms are distinct unless otherwise stated. :I. Incidence # For every two points A and B there exists a line a that contains them both. We write AB = a or BA = a. Instead of ‚Äúcontains,‚Äù we may also employ other forms of expression; for example, we may say ‚ÄúA lies upon a‚Äù, ‚ÄúA is a point of a‚Äù, ‚Äúa goes through A and through B‚Äù, ‚Äúa joins A to B‚Äù, etc. If A lies upon a and at the same time upon another line b, we make use also of the expression: ‚ÄúThe lines a and b have the point A in common,‚Äù etc. # For every two points there exists no more than one line that contains them both; consequently, if AB = a and AC = a, where B ‚â† C, then also BC = a. # There exist at least two points on a line. There exist at least three points that do not lie on a line. # For every three points A, B, C not situated on the same line there exists a plane Œ± that contains all of them. For every plane there exists a point which lies on it. We write ABC = Œ±. We employ also the expressions: ‚ÄúA, B, C, lie in Œ±‚Äù; ‚ÄúA, B, C are points of Œ±‚Äù, etc. # For every three points A, B, C which do not lie in the same line, there exists no more than one plane that contains them all. # If two points A, B of a line a lie in a plane Œ±, then every point of a lies in Œ±. In this case we say: ‚ÄúThe line a lies in the plane Œ±,‚Äù etc. # If two planes Œ±, Œ≤ have a point A in common, then they have at least a second point B in common. # There exist at least four points not lying in a plane. :II. Order # If a point B lies between points A and C, B is also between C and A, and there exists a line containing the distinct points A,B,C. # If A and C are two points of a line, then there exists at least one point B lying between A and C. # Of any three points situated on a line, there is no more than one which lies between the other two. # Pasch's Axiom: Let A, B, C be three points not lying in the same line and let a be a line lying in the plane ABC and not passing through any of the points A, B, C. Then, if the line a passes through a point of the segment AB, it will also pass through either a point of the segment BC or a point of the segment AC. :III. Congruence # If A, B are two points on a line a, and if A‚Ä≤ is a point upon the same or another line a‚Ä≤ , then, upon a given side of A‚Ä≤ on the straight line a‚Ä≤ , we can always find a point B‚Ä≤ so that the segment AB is congruent to the segment A‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤ . We indicate this relation by writing AB ‚âÖ A‚Ä≤ B‚Ä≤. Every segment is congruent to itself; that is, we always have AB ‚âÖ AB. We can state the above axiom briefly by saying that every segment can be laid off upon a given side of a given point of a given straight line in at least one way. # If a segment AB is congruent to the segment A‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤ and also to the segment A‚Ä≥B‚Ä≥, then the segment A‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤ is congruent to the segment A‚Ä≥B‚Ä≥; that is, if AB ‚âÖ A‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤ and AB ‚âÖ A‚Ä≥B‚Ä≥, then A‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤ ‚âÖ A‚Ä≥B‚Ä≥. # Let AB and BC be two segments of a line a which have no points in common aside from the point B, and, furthermore, let A‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤ and B‚Ä≤C‚Ä≤ be two segments of the same or of another line a‚Ä≤ having, likewise, no point other than B‚Ä≤ in common. Then, if AB ‚âÖ A‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤ and BC ‚âÖ B‚Ä≤C‚Ä≤, we have AC ‚âÖ A‚Ä≤C‚Ä≤. # Let an angle ‚à† (h,k) be given in the plane Œ± and let a line a‚Ä≤ be given in a plane Œ±‚Ä≤. Suppose also that, in the plane Œ±‚Ä≤, a definite side of the straight line a‚Ä≤ be assigned. Denote by h‚Ä≤ a ray of the straight line a‚Ä≤ emanating from a point O‚Ä≤ of this line. Then in the plane Œ±‚Ä≤ there is one and only one ray k‚Ä≤ such that the angle ‚à† (h, k), or ‚à† (k, h), is congruent to the angle ‚à† (h‚Ä≤, k‚Ä≤) and at the same time all interior points of the angle ‚à† (h‚Ä≤, k‚Ä≤) lie upon the given side of a‚Ä≤. We express this relation by means of the notation ‚à† (h, k) ‚âÖ ‚à† (h‚Ä≤, k‚Ä≤). # If the angle ‚à† (h, k) is congruent to the angle ‚à† (h‚Ä≤, k‚Ä≤) and to the angle ‚à† (h‚Ä≥, k‚Ä≥), then the angle ‚à† (h‚Ä≤, k‚Ä≤) is congruent to the angle ‚à† (h‚Ä≥, k‚Ä≥); that is to say, if ‚à† (h, k) ‚âÖ ‚à† (h‚Ä≤, k‚Ä≤) and ‚à† (h, k) ‚âÖ ‚à† (h‚Ä≥, k‚Ä≥), then ‚à† (h‚Ä≤, k‚Ä≤) ‚âÖ ‚à† (h‚Ä≥, k‚Ä≥). :IV. Parallels # (Euclid's Axiom):This is Hilbert's terminology. This statement is more familiarly known as Playfair's axiom. Let a be any line and A a point not on it. Then there is at most one line in the plane, determined by a and A, that passes through A and does not intersect a. :V. Continuity # Axiom of Archimedes. If AB and CD are any segments then there exists a number n such that n segments CD constructed contiguously from A, along the ray from A through B, will pass beyond the point B. # Axiom of line completeness. An extension of a set of points on a line with its order and congruence relations that would preserve the relations existing among the original elements as well as the fundamental properties of line order and congruence that follows from Axioms I‚ÄìIII and from V-1 is impossible. Changes in Hilbert's axioms When the monograph of 1899 was translated into French, Hilbert added: :: V.2 Axiom of completeness. To a system of points, straight lines, and planes, it is impossible to add other elements in such a manner that the system thus generalized shall form a new geometry obeying all of the five groups of axioms. In other words, the elements of geometry form a system which is not susceptible of extension, if we regard the five groups of axioms as valid. This axiom is not needed for the development of Euclidean geometry, but is needed to establish a bijection between the real numbers and the points on a line. This was an essential ingredient in Hilbert's proof of the consistency of his axiom system. By the 7th edition of the Grundlagen, this axiom had been replaced by the axiom of line completeness given above and the old axiom V.2 became Theorem 32. Also to be found in the 1899 monograph (and appearing in the Townsend translation) is: :II.4. Any four points A, B, C, D of a line can always be labeled so that B shall lie between A and C and also between A and D, and, furthermore, that C shall lie between A and D and also between B and D. However, E.H. Moore and R.L. Moore independently proved that this axiom is redundant, and the former published this result in an article appearing in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society in 1902. Hilbert moved the axiom to Theorem 5 and renumbered the axioms accordingly (old axiom II-5 (Pasch's axiom) now became II-4). While not as dramatic as these changes, most of the remaining axioms were also modified in form and/or function over the course of the first seven editions. Consistency and Independence Going beyond the establishment of a satisfactory set of axioms, Hilbert also proved the consistency of his system relative to the theory of real numbers by constructing a model of his axiom system from the real numbers. He proved the independence of some of his axioms by constructing models of geometries which satisfy all except the one axiom under consideration. Thus, there are examples of geometries satisfying all except the Archimedean axiom V.1 (non-Archimedean geometries), all except the parallel axiom IV.1 (non-Euclidean geometries) and so on. Using the same technique he also showed how some important theorems depended on certain axioms and were independent of others. Some of his models were very complex and other mathematicians tried to simplify them. For instance, Hilbert's model for showing the independence of Desargues theorem from certain axioms ultimately led Ray Moulton to discover the non- Desarguesian Moulton plane. These investigations by Hilbert virtually inaugurated the modern study of abstract geometry in the twentieth century. =Birkhoff's axioms= George David Birkhoff In 1932, G. D. Birkhoff created a set of four postulates of Euclidean geometry sometimes referred to as Birkhoff's axioms. These postulates are all based on basic geometry that can be experimentally verified with a scale and protractor. In a radical departure from the synthetic approach of Hilbert, Birkhoff was the first to build the foundations of geometry on the real number system. It is this powerful assumption that permits the small number of axioms in this system. Postulates Birkhoff uses four undefined terms: point, line, distance and angle. His postulates are: Postulate I: Postulate of Line Measure. The points A, B, ... of any line can be put into 1:1 correspondence with the real numbers x so that xB ‚àíx A = d(A, B) for all points A and B. Postulate II: Point-Line Postulate. There is one and only one straight line, ‚Ñì, that contains any two given distinct points P and Q. Postulate III: Postulate of Angle Measure. The rays {‚Ñì, m, n, ...} through any point O can be put into 1:1 correspondence with the real numbers a (mod 2œÄ) so that if A and B are points (not equal to O) of ‚Ñì and m, respectively, the difference am ‚àí a‚Ñì (mod 2œÄ) of the numbers associated with the lines ‚Ñì and m is angleAOB. Furthermore, if the point B on m varies continuously in a line r not containing the vertex O, the number am varies continuously also. Postulate IV: Postulate of Similarity. If in two triangles ABC and A'B'C' and for some constant k > 0, d(A', B' ) = kd(A, B), d(A', C' ) = kd(A, C) and angleB'A'C' = ¬±angleBAC, then d(B', C' ) = kd(B, C), angle C'B'A' = ¬±angleCBA, and angleA'C'B' = ¬±angleACB. =School geometry= George Bruce Halsted Whether or not it is wise to teach Euclidean geometry from an axiomatic viewpoint at the high school level has been a matter of debate. There have been many attempts to do so and not all of them have been successful. In 1904, George Bruce Halsted published a high school geometry text based on Hilbert's axiom set. Logical criticisms of this text led to a highly revised second edition. In reaction to the launching of the Russian satellite Sputnik there was a call to revise the school mathematics curriculum. From this effort there arose the New Math program of the 1960s. With this as a background, many individuals and groups set about to provide textual material for geometry classes based on an axiomatic approach. Mac Lane's axioms Saunders Mac Lane Saunders Mac Lane (1909-2005), a mathematician,among his several achievements, he is the cofounder (with Samuel Eilenberg) of Category theory. wrote a paper in 1959 in which he proposed a set of axioms for Euclidean geometry in the spirit of Birkhoff's treatment using a distance function to associate real numbers with line segments. This was not the first attempt to base a school level treatment on Birkhoff's system, in fact, Birkhoff and Ralph Beatley had written a high school text in 1940 [Reprint of 3rd edition: American Mathematical Society, 2000. ] which developed Euclidean geometry from five axioms and the ability to measure line segments and angles. However, in order to gear the treatment to a high school audience, some mathematical and logical arguments were either ignored or slurred over. In Mac Lane's system there are four primitive notions (undefined terms): point, distance, line and angle measure. There are also 14 axioms, four giving the properties of the distance function, four describing properties of lines, four discussing angles (which are directed angles in this treatment), a similarity axiom (essentially the same as Birkhoff's) and a continuity axiom which can be used to derive the Crossbar theorem and its converse. The increased number of axioms has the pedagogical advantage of making early proofs in the development easier to follow and the use of a familiar metric permits a rapid advancement through basic material so that the more \\"interesting\\" aspects of the subject can be gotten to sooner. SMSG (School Mathematics Study Group) axioms In the 1960s a new set of axioms for Euclidean geometry, suitable for high school geometry courses, was introduced by the School Mathematics Study Group (SMSG), as a part of the New math curricula. This set of axioms follows the Birkhoff model of using the real numbers to gain quick entry into the geometric fundamentals. However, whereas Birkhoff tried to minimize the number of axioms used, and most authors were concerned with the independence of the axioms in their treatments, the SMSG axiom list was intentionally made large and redundant for pedagogical reasons. The SMSG only produced a mimeographed text using these axioms, but Edwin E. Moise, a member of the SMSG, wrote a high school text based on this system, and a college level text, , with some of the redundancy removed and modifications made to the axioms for a more sophisticated audience. There are eight undefined terms: point, line, plane, lie on, distance, angle measure, area and volume. The 22 axioms of this system are given individual names for ease of reference. Amongst these are to be found: the Ruler Postulate, the Ruler Placement Postulate, the Plane Separation Postulate, the Angle Addition Postulate, the Side angle side (SAS) Postulate, the Parallel Postulate (in Playfair's form), and Cavalieri's principle. UCSMP (University of Chicago School Mathematics Project) axioms Although much of the New math curriculum has been drastically modified or abandoned, the geometry portion has remained relatively stable. Modern high school textbooks use axiom systems that are very similar to those of the SMSG. For example, the texts produced by the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project (UCSMP) use a system which, besides some updating of language, differs mainly from the SMSG system in that it includes some transformation concepts under its \\"Reflection Postulate\\". There are only three undefined terms: point, line and plane. There are eight \\"postulates\\", but most of these have several parts (which are generally called assumptions in this system). Counting these parts, there are 32 axioms in this system. Amongst the postulates can be found the point-line- plane postulate, the Triangle inequality postulate, postulates for distance, angle measurement, corresponding angles, area and volume, and the Reflection postulate. The reflection postulate is used as a replacement for the SAS postulate of SMSG system. =Other systems= Oswald Veblen (1880 - 1960) provided a new axiom system in 1904 when he replaced the concept of \\"betweeness\\", as used by Hilbert and Pasch, with a new primitive, order. This permitted several primitive terms used by Hilbert to become defined entities, reducing the number of primitive notions to two, point and order. Many other axiomatic systems for Euclidean geometry have been proposed over the years. A comparison of many of these can be found in a 1927 monograph by Henry George Forder. (reprinted by Dover, 1958) Forder also gives, by combining axioms from different systems, his own treatment based on the two primitive notions of point and order. He also provides a more abstract treatment of one of Pieri's systems (from 1909) based on the primitives point and congruence. Starting with Peano, there has been a parallel thread of interest amongst logicians concerning the axiomatic foundations of Euclidean geometry. This can be seen, in part, in the notation used to describe the axioms. Pieri claimed that even though he wrote in the traditional language of geometry, he was always thinking in terms of the logical notation introduced by Peano, and used that formalism to see how to prove things. A typical example of this type of notation can be found in the work of E. V. Huntington (1874 - 1952) who, in 1913, produced an axiomatic treatment of three-dimensional Euclidean geometry based upon the primitive notions of sphere and inclusion (one sphere lying within another). Beyond notation there is also interest in the logical structure of the theory of geometry. Alfred Tarski proved that a portion of geometry, which he called elementary geometry, is a first order logical theory (see Tarski's axioms). Modern text treatments of the axiomatic foundations of Euclidean geometry follow the pattern of H.G. Forder and Gilbert de B. Robinson who mix and match axioms from different systems to produce different emphases. is a modern example of this approach. Non-Euclidean geometry > In view of the role which mathematics plays in science and implications of > scientific knowledge for all of our beliefs, revolutionary changes in man's > understanding of the nature of mathematics could not but mean revolutionary > changes in his understanding of science, doctrines of philosophy, religious > and ethical beliefs, and, in fact, all intellectual disciplines. In the first half of the nineteenth century a revolution took place in the field of geometry that was as scientifically important as the Copernican revolution in astronomy and as philosophically profound as the Darwinian theory of evolution in its impact on the way we think. This was the consequence of the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry. For over two thousand years, starting in the time of Euclid, the postulates which grounded geometry were considered self-evident truths about physical space. Geometers thought that they were deducing other, more obscure truths from them, without the possibility of error. This view became untenable with the development of hyperbolic geometry. There were now two incompatible systems of geometry (and more came later) that were self-consistent and compatible with the observable physical world. \\"From this point on, the whole discussion of the relation between geometry and physical space was carried on in quite different terms.\\" To obtain a non-Euclidean geometry, the parallel postulate (or its equivalent) must be replaced by its negation. Negating the Playfair's axiom form, since it is a compound statement (... there exists one and only one ...), can be done in two ways. Either there will exist more than one line through the point parallel to the given line or there will exist no lines through the point parallel to the given line. In the first case, replacing the parallel postulate (or its equivalent) with the statement \\"In a plane, given a point P and a line ‚Ñì not passing through P, there exist two lines through P which do not meet ‚Ñì\\" and keeping all the other axioms, yields hyperbolic geometry.while only two lines are postulated, it is easily shown that there must be an infinite number of such lines. The second case is not dealt with as easily. Simply replacing the parallel postulate with the statement, \\"In a plane, given a point P and a line ‚Ñì not passing through P, all the lines through P meet ‚Ñì\\", does not give a consistent set of axioms. This follows since parallel lines exist in absolute geometry,Book I Proposition 27 of Euclid's Elements but this statement would say that there are no parallel lines. This problem was known (in a different guise) to Khayyam, Saccheri and Lambert and was the basis for their rejecting what was known as the \\"obtuse angle case\\". In order to obtain a consistent set of axioms which includes this axiom about having no parallel lines, some of the other axioms must be tweaked. The adjustments to be made depend upon the axiom system being used. Amongst others these tweaks will have the effect of modifying Euclid's second postulate from the statement that line segments can be extended indefinitely to the statement that lines are unbounded. Riemann's elliptic geometry emerges as the most natural geometry satisfying this axiom. It was Gauss who coined the term \\"non-Euclidean geometry\\".Felix Klein, Elementary Mathematics from an Advanced Standpoint: Geometry, Dover, 1948 (reprint of English translation of 3rd Edition, 1940. First edition in German, 1908) pg. 176 He was referring to his own, unpublished work, which today we call hyperbolic geometry. Several authors still consider \\"non-Euclidean geometry\\" and \\"hyperbolic geometry\\" to be synonyms. In 1871, Felix Klein, by adapting a metric discussed by Arthur Cayley in 1852, was able to bring metric properties into a projective setting and was thus able to unify the treatments of hyperbolic, euclidean and elliptic geometry under the umbrella of projective geometry.F. Klein, √úber die sogenannte nichteuklidische Geometrie, Mathematische Annalen, 4(1871). Klein is responsible for the terms \\"hyperbolic\\" and \\"elliptic\\" (in his system he called Euclidean geometry \\"parabolic\\", a term which has not survived the test of time and is used today only in a few disciplines.) His influence has led to the common usage of the term \\"non-Euclidean geometry\\" to mean either \\"hyperbolic\\" or \\"elliptic\\" geometry. There are some mathematicians who would extend the list of geometries that should be called \\"non-Euclidean\\" in various ways. In other disciplines, most notably mathematical physics, where Klein's influence was not as strong, the term \\"non-Euclidean\\" is often taken to mean not Euclidean. =Euclid's parallel postulate= For two thousand years, many attempts were made to prove the parallel postulate using Euclid's first four postulates. A possible reason that such a proof was so highly sought after was that, unlike the first four postulates, the parallel postulate isn't self- evident. If the order the postulates were listed in the Elements is significant, it indicates that Euclid included this postulate only when he realised he could not prove it or proceed without it. Many attempts were made to prove the fifth postulate from the other four, many of them being accepted as proofs for long periods of time until the mistake was found. Invariably the mistake was assuming some 'obvious' property which turned out to be equivalent to the fifth postulate. Eventually it was realized that this postulate may not be provable from the other four. According to this opinion about the parallel postulate (Postulate 5) does appear in print: > Apparently the first to do so was G. S. Kl√ºgel (1739-1812), a doctoral > student at the University of Gottingen, with the support of his teacher A. > G. K√§stner, in the former's 1763 dissertation Conatuum praecipuorum theoriam > parallelarum demonstrandi recensio (Review of the Most Celebrated Attempts > at Demonstrating the Theory of Parallels). In this work Kl√ºgel examined 28 > attempts to prove Postulate 5 (including Saccheri's), found them all > deficient, and offered the opinion that Postulate 5 is unprovable and is > supported solely by the judgment of our senses. The beginning of the 19th century would finally witness decisive steps in the creation of non-Euclidean geometry. Circa 1813, Carl Friedrich Gauss and independently around 1818, the German professor of law Ferdinand Karl SchweikartIn a letter of December 1818, Ferdinand Karl Schweikart (1780‚Äì1859) sketched a few insights into non-Euclidean geometry. The letter was forwarded to Gauss in 1819 by Gauss's former student Gerling. In his reply to Gerling, Gauss praised Schweikart and mentioned his own, earlier research into non- Euclidean geometry. had the germinal ideas of non-Euclidean geometry worked out, but neither published any results. Then, around 1830, the Hungarian mathematician J√°nos Bolyai and the Russian mathematician Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky separately published treatises on what we today call hyperbolic geometry. Consequently, hyperbolic geometry has been called Bolyai- Lobachevskian geometry, as both mathematicians, independent of each other, are the basic authors of non-Euclidean geometry. Gauss mentioned to Bolyai's father, when shown the younger Bolyai's work, that he had developed such a geometry several years before,In the letter to Wolfgang (Farkas) Bolyai of March 6, 1832 Gauss claims to have worked on the problem for thirty or thirty- five years . In his 1824 letter to Taurinus he claimed that he had been working on the problem for over 30 years and provided enough detail to show that he actually had worked out the details. According to it wasn't until around 1813 that Gauss had come to accept the existence of a new geometry. though he did not publish. While Lobachevsky created a non-Euclidean geometry by negating the parallel postulate, Bolyai worked out a geometry where both the Euclidean and the hyperbolic geometry are possible depending on a parameter k. Bolyai ends his work by mentioning that it is not possible to decide through mathematical reasoning alone if the geometry of the physical universe is Euclidean or non-Euclidean; this is a task for the physical sciences. The independence of the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms was finally demonstrated by Eugenio Beltrami in 1868.Beltrami, Eugenio Teoria fondamentale degli spaz√Æ di curvatura costante, Annali. di Mat., ser II 2 (1868), 232-255 The various attempted proofs of the parallel postulate produced a long list of theorems that are equivalent to the parallel postulate. Equivalence here means that in the presence of the other axioms of the geometry each of these theorems can be assumed to be true and the parallel postulate can be proved from this altered set of axioms. This is not the same as logical equivalence.An appropriate example of logical equivalence is given by Playfair's axiom and Euclid I.30 (see Playfair's axiom#Transitivity of parallelism). In different sets of axioms for Euclidean geometry, any of these can replace the Euclidean parallel postulate.For instance, Hilbert uses Playfair's axiom while Birkhoff uses the theorem about similar but not congruent triangles. The following partial list indicates some of these theorems that are of historical interest.attributions are due to # Parallel straight lines are equidistant. (Poseidonios, 1st century B.C.) # All the points equidistant from a given straight line, on a given side of it, constitute a straight line. (Christoph Clavius, 1574) # Playfair's axiom. In a plane, there is at most one line that can be drawn parallel to another given one through an external point. (Proclus, 5th century, but popularized by John Playfair, late 18th century) # The sum of the angles in every triangle is 180¬∞ (Gerolamo Saccheri, 1733; Adrien-Marie Legendre, early 19th century) # There exists a triangle whose angles add up to 180¬∞. (Gerolamo Saccheri, 1733; Adrien-Marie Legendre, early 19th century) # There exists a pair of similar, but not congruent, triangles. (Gerolamo Saccheri, 1733) # Every triangle can be circumscribed. (Adrien-Marie Legendre, Farkas Bolyai, early 19th century) # If three angles of a quadrilateral are right angles, then the fourth angle is also a right angle. (Alexis-Claude Clairaut, 1741; Johann Heinrich Lambert, 1766) # There exists a quadrilateral in which all angles are right angles. (Geralamo Saccheri, 1733) # Wallis' postulate. On a given finite straight line it is always possible to construct a triangle similar to a given triangle. (John Wallis, 1663; Lazare-Nicholas-Marguerite Carnot, 1803; Adrien-Marie Legendre, 1824) # There is no upper limit to the area of a triangle. (Carl Friedrich Gauss, 1799) # The summit angles of the Saccheri quadrilateral are 90¬∞. (Geralamo Saccheri, 1733) # Proclus' axiom. If a line intersects one of two parallel lines, both of which are coplanar with the original line, then it also intersects the other. (Proclus, 5th century) =Neutral (or Absolute) geometry= Absolute geometry is a geometry based on an axiom system consisting of all the axioms giving Euclidean geometry except for the parallel postulate or any of its alternatives.Use a complete set of axioms for Euclidean geometry such as Hilbert's axioms or another modern equivalent . Euclid's original set of axioms is ambiguous and not complete, it does not form a basis for Euclidean geometry. The term was introduced by J√°nos Bolyai in 1832.In \\"Appendix exhibiting the absolute science of space: independent of the truth or falsity of Euclid's Axiom XI (by no means previously decided)\\" It is sometimes referred to as neutral geometry,Greenberg cites W. Prenowitz and M. Jordan (Greenberg, p. xvi) for having used the term neutral geometry to refer to that part of Euclidean geometry that does not depend on Euclid's parallel postulate. He says that the word absolute in absolute geometry misleadingly implies that all other geometries depend on it. as it is neutral with respect to the parallel postulate. Relation to other geometries In Euclid's Elements, the first 28 propositions and Proposition I.31 avoid using the parallel postulate, and therefore are valid theorems in absolute geometry. Proposition I.31 proves the existence of parallel lines (by construction). Also, the Saccheri‚ÄìLegendre theorem, which states that the sum of the angles in a triangle is at most 180¬∞, can be proved. The theorems of absolute geometry hold in hyperbolic geometry as well as in Euclidean geometry.Absolute geometry is, in fact, the intersection of hyperbolic geometry and Euclidean geometry when these are regarded as sets of propositions. Absolute geometry is inconsistent with elliptic geometry: in elliptic geometry there are no parallel lines at all, but in absolute geometry parallel lines do exist. Also, in elliptic geometry, the sum of the angles in any triangle is greater than 180¬∞. Incompleteness Logically, the axioms do not form a complete theory since one can add extra independent axioms without making the axiom system inconsistent. One can extend absolute geometry by adding different axioms about parallelism and get incompatible but consistent axiom systems, giving rise to Euclidean or hyperbolic geometry. Thus every theorem of absolute geometry is a theorem of hyperbolic geometry and Euclidean geometry. However the converse is not true. Also, absolute geometry is not a categorical theory, since it has models that are not isomorphic. =Hyperbolic geometry= In the axiomatic approach to hyperbolic geometry (also referred to as Lobachevskian geometry or Bolyai‚ÄìLobachevskian geometry), one additional axiom is added to the axioms giving absolute geometry. The new axiom is Lobachevsky's parallel postulate (also known as the characteristic postulate of hyperbolic geometry): :Through a point not on a given line there exists (in the plane determined by this point and line) at least two lines which do not meet the given line. With this addition, the axiom system is now complete. Although the new axiom asserts only the existence of two lines, it is readily established that there are an infinite number of lines through the given point which do not meet the given line. Given this plenitude, one must be careful with terminology in this setting, as the term parallel line no longer has the unique meaning that it has in Euclidean geometry. Specifically, let P be a point not on a given line ell. Let PA be the perpendicular drawn from P to ell (meeting at point A). The lines through P fall into two classes, those that meet ell and those that don't. The characteristic postulate of hyperbolic geometry says that there are at least two lines of the latter type. Of the lines which don't meet ell, there will be (on each side of PA) a line making the smallest angle with PA. Sometimes these lines are referred to as the first lines through P which don't meet ell and are variously called limiting, asymptotic or parallel lines (when this last term is used, these are the _only_ parallel lines). All other lines through P which do not meet ell are called non-intersecting or ultraparallel lines. Since hyperbolic geometry and Euclidean geometry are both built on the axioms of absolute geometry, they share many properties and propositions. However, the consequences of replacing the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry with the characteristic postulate of hyperbolic geometry can be dramatic. To mention a few of these: Lambert quadrilateral in hyperbolic geometry * A Lambert quadrilateral is a quadrilateral which has three right angles. The fourth angle of a Lambert quadrilateral is acute if the geometry is hyperbolic, and a right angle if the geometry is Euclidean. Furthermore, rectangles can exist (a statement equivalent to the parallel postulate) only in Euclidean geometry. * A Saccheri quadrilateral is a quadrilateral which has two sides of equal length, both perpendicular to a side called the base. The other two angles of a Saccheri quadrilateral are called the summit angles and they have equal measure. The summit angles of a Saccheri quadrilateral are acute if the geometry is hyperbolic, and right angles if the geometry is Euclidean. * The sum of the measures of the angles of any triangle is less than 180¬∞ if the geometry is hyperbolic, and equal to 180¬∞ if the geometry is Euclidean. The defect of a triangle is the numerical value (180¬∞ ‚Äì sum of the measures of the angles of the triangle). This result may also be stated as: the defect of triangles in hyperbolic geometry is positive, and the defect of triangles in Euclidean geometry is zero. * The area of a triangle in hyperbolic geometry is bounded while triangles exist with arbitrarily large areas in Euclidean geometry. * The set of points on the same side and equally far from a given straight line themselves form a line in Euclidean geometry, but don't in hyperbolic geometry (they form a hypercycle.) Advocates of the position that Euclidean geometry is the one and only \\"true\\" geometry received a setback when, in a memoir published in 1868, \\"Fundamental theory of spaces of constant curvature\\", Eugenio Beltrami gave an abstract proof of equiconsistency of hyperbolic and Euclidean geometry for any dimension. He accomplished this by introducing several models of non-Euclidean geometry that are now known as the Beltrami‚ÄìKlein model, the Poincar√© disk model, and the Poincar√© half-plane model, together with transformations that relate them. For the half-plane model, Beltrami cited a note by Liouville in the treatise of Monge on differential geometry. Beltrami also showed that n-dimensional Euclidean geometry is realized on a horosphere of the (n + 1)-dimensional hyperbolic space, so the logical relation between consistency of the Euclidean and the non-Euclidean geometries is symmetric. =Elliptic geometry= Another way to modify the Euclidean parallel postulate is to assume that there are no parallel lines in a plane. Unlike the situation with hyperbolic geometry, where we just add one new axiom, we can not obtain a consistent system by adding this statement as a new axiom to the axioms of absolute geometry. This follows since parallel lines provably exist in absolute geometry. Other axioms must be changed. Starting with Hilbert's axioms the necessary changes involve removing Hilbert's four axioms of order and replacing them with these seven axioms of separation concerned with a new undefined relation. There is an undefined (primitive) relation between four points, A, B, C and D denoted by (A,CB,D) and read as \\"A and C separate B and D\\",Visualize four points on a circle which in counter-clockwise order are A, B, C and D. satisfying these axioms: # If (A,BC,D), then the points A, B, C and D are collinear and distinct. # If (A,BC,D), then (C,DA,B) and (B,AD,C). # If (A,BC,D), then not (A,CB,D). # If points A, B, C and D are collinear and distinct then (A,BC,D) or (A,CB,D) or (A,DB,C). # If points A, B, and C are collinear and distinct, then there exists a point D such that (A,BC,D). # For any five distinct collinear points A, B, C, D and E, if (A,BD,E), then either (A,BC,D) or (A,BC,E). # Perspectivities preserve separation. Since the Hilbert notion of \\"betweeness\\" has been removed, terms which were defined using that concept need to be redefined.This reenforces the futility of attempting to \\"fix\\" Euclid's axioms to obtain this geometry. Changes need to be made in the unstated assumptions of Euclid. Thus, a line segment AB defined as the points A and B and all the points between A and B in absolute geometry, needs to be reformulated. A line segment in this new geometry is determined by three collinear points A, B and C and consists of those three points and all the points not separated from B by A and C. There are further consequences. Since two points do not determine a line segment uniquely, three noncollinear points do not determine a unique triangle, and the definition of triangle has to be reformulated. Once these notions have been redefined, the other axioms of absolute geometry (incidence, congruence and continuity) all make sense and are left alone. Together with the new axiom on the nonexistence of parallel lines we have a consistent system of axioms giving a new geometry. The geometry that results is called (plane) Elliptic geometry. Saccheri quadrilaterals in Euclidean, Elliptic and Hyperbolic geometry Even though elliptic geometry is not an extension of absolute geometry (as Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry are), there is a certain \\"symmetry\\" in the propositions of the three geometries that reflects a deeper connection which was observed by Felix Klein. Some of the propositions which exhibit this property are: * The fourth angle of a Lambert quadrilateral is an obtuse angle in elliptic geometry. * The summit angles of a Saccheri quadrilateral are obtuse in elliptic geometry. * The sum of the measures of the angles of any triangle is greater than 180¬∞ if the geometry is elliptic. That is, the defect of a triangle is negative.Negative defect is called the excess, so this may also be phrased as- triangles have a positive excess in elliptic geometry. * All the lines perpendicular to a given line meet at a common point in elliptic geometry, called the pole of the line. In hyperbolic geometry these lines are mutually non-intersecting, while in Euclidean geometry they are mutually parallel. Other results, such as the exterior angle theorem, clearly emphasize the difference between elliptic and the geometries that are extensions of absolute geometry. Spherical geometryOther geometries=Projective geometryAffine geometryOrdered geometry= Absolute geometry is an extension of ordered geometry, and thus, all theorems in ordered geometry hold in absolute geometry. The converse is not true. Absolute geometry assumes the first four of Euclid's Axioms (or their equivalents), to be contrasted with affine geometry, which does not assume Euclid's third and fourth axioms. Ordered geometry is a common foundation of both absolute and affine geometry.Coxeter, pgs. 175‚Äì176 =Finite geometry=See also * Coordinate-free * Synthetic geometry NotesReferences  : (3 vols.): (vol. 1), (vol. 2), (vol. 3).

He went on to capture the French privateer Tigre on 18 October 1778; but the Ceres was herself engaged and captured by the 36-gun French frigate Iphig√©nie off St Lucia on 17 December 1778. The Ceres was escorting a troop convoy at the time, and Dacres acted to decoy the French frigate away from the convoy, eventually forcing the French to pursue the Ceres for 48 hours, allowing the convoy to escape. Dacres was subsequently exchanged and returned to England, whereupon he was made acting-captain of the 74-gun , afterwards being transferred to the 28-gun . He was not confirmed as post-captain however until 13 September 1780, when he was given command of the 20-gun , stationed in the Downs. He transferred to the frigates and towards the end of the war. French Revolutionary Wars The outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793 led to Dacres returning to sea aboard the 64-gun and taking part in the bombardment and capture of Fort Bizothen at Port-au-Prince. His crew however suffered from high levels of sickness and Dacres was despatched back to Britain as a convoy escort. After his arrival he was appointed to command the 90-gun as part of the Channel Fleet under Lord Bridport. He was present at the Battle of Groix on 23 June 1795, but was not actively engaged. Vice-Admiral William Waldegrave went on to hoist his flag on the Barfleur, retaining Dacres as his flag captain. He and the Barfleur sailed to join Sir John Jervis's fleet in the Mediterranean. Dacres was involved in the recapture of from the French in early 1796, and was still in command when the Battle of Cape St Vincent took place on 14 February 1797. Dacres subsequently returned to Britain aboard the hired cutter Flora and received command of the 80-gun , sailing her to the Mediterranean. Dacres remained aboard the Foudroyant until February 1799. Flag rank Dacres was promoted to Rear-Admiral of the Blue on 14 February 1799, two years to the day after the battle of Cape St Vincent. He was further advanced to Rear-Admiral of the White on 1 January 1801, and was then appointed as second in command of the Plymouth command. With the Peace of Amiens he became Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth. With the resumption of the war he was appointed second in command on the Jamaica Station, serving under Sir John Thomas Duckworth and flying his flag in the 36-gun Franchise. He soon became considerably wealthy from the spoils of prize warfare, being appointed commander of the station in late 1804, promoted to vice admiral on 9 November 1805 and remaining in the post until 1808.Cundall, p. xx Family and later life Dacres had married Eleanor Blandford Pearce, of Cambridge, on 1 August 1777 during a period in Britain while in command of the Ceres. The marriage took place at Totnes, Devon and subsequently produced two sons. Both had substantial naval careers, the elder, Barrington Dacres became post-captain, the younger, James Richard Dacres rose to be a Vice-Admiral. Dacres retired from active service in 1809 having amassed considerable wealth from his time in Jamaica. He did not live long to enjoy it though, dying on 6 January 1810 at the age of 60 after a fall from his horse.

It often occurs to defective mitochondria following damage or stress. The process of mitophagy was first described over a hundred years ago by Margaret Reed Lewis and Warren Harmon Lewis. Ashford and Porter used electron microscopy to observe mitochondrial fragments in liver lysosomes by 1962, and a 1977 report suggested that \\"mitochondria develop functional alterations which would activate autophagy.\\" The term \\"mitophagy\\" was in use by 1998. Mitophagy is key in keeping the cell healthy. It promotes turnover of mitochondria and prevents accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria which can lead to cellular degeneration. It is mediated by Atg32 (in yeast) and NIX and its regulator BNIP3 in mammals. Mitophagy is regulated by PINK1 and parkin proteins. In addition to the selective removal of damaged mitochondria, mitophagy is also required to adjust mitochondrial numbers to changing cellular metabolic needs, for steady-state mitochondrial turnover, and during certain cellular developmental stages, such as during cellular differentiation of red blood cells.  Role  Organelles and bits of cytoplasm are sequestered and targeted for degradation by the lysosome for hydrolytic digestion by a process known as autophagy. Mitochondria metabolism leads to the creation of by- products that lead to DNA damage and mutations. Therefore, a healthy population of mitochondria is critical for the well-being of cells. Previously it was thought that targeted degradation of mitochondria was a stochastic event, but accumulating evidence suggest that mitophagy is a selective process. Generation of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation leads to the production of various reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondria, and submitochondrial particles. Formation of ROS as a mitochondrial waste product will eventually lead to cytotoxicity and cell death. Because of their role in metabolism, mitochondria are very susceptible to ROS damage. Damaged mitochondria cause a depletion in ATP and a release of cytochrome c, which leads to activation of caspases and onset of apoptosis. Mitochondrial damage is not caused solely by oxidative stress or disease processes; normal mitochondria will eventually accumulate oxidative damage hallmarks overtime, which can be deleterious to mitochondria as well as to the cell. These faulty mitochondria can further deplete the cell of ATP, increase production of ROS, and release proapoptopic proteins such as caspases. Because of the danger of having damaged mitochondria in the cell, the timely elimination of damaged and aged mitochondria is essential for maintaining the integrity of the cell. This turnover process consists of the sequestration and hydrolytic degradation by the lysosome, a process also known as mitophagy. Mitochondrial depletion reduces a spectrum of senescence effectors and phenotypes while preserving ATP production via enhanced glycolysis.  Pathways = In mammals = There are several pathways by which mitophagy is induced in mammalian cells. The PINK1 and Parkin pathway is, so far, the best characterized. This pathway starts by deciphering the difference between healthy mitochondria and damaged mitochondria. A 64-kDa protein, PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), has been implicated to detect mitochondrial quality. PINK1 contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) and is recruited to the mitochondria. In healthy mitochondria, PINK1 is imported through the outer membrane via the TOM complex, and partially through the inner mitochondrial membrane via the TIM complex, so it then spans the inner mitochondrial membrane. The process of import into the inner membrane is associated with the cleavage of PINK1 from 64-kDa into a 60-kDa form. PINK1 is then cleaved by PARL into a 52-kDa form. This new form of PINK1 is degraded by proteases within the mitochondria. This keeps the concentration of PINK1 in check in healthy mitochondria. In unhealthy mitochondria, the inner mitochondrial membrane becomes depolarized. This membrane potential is necessary for the TIM-mediated protein import. In depolarized mitochondria, PINK1 is no longer imported into the inner membrane, is not cleaved by PARL and PINK1 concentration increases in the outer mitochondrial membrane. PINK1 can then recruit Parkin, a cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase.. It is thought that PINK1 phosphorylates Parkin ubiquitin ligase at S65 which initiates Parkin recruitment at the mitochondria.Lazarou M. \\"Keeping the immune system in check: a role for mitophagy. Immunol Cell Biol. 2014; The phosphorylation site of Parkin, at S65, is homologous to the site where ubiquitin is phosphorylated. This phosphorylation activates Parkin by inducing dimerization, an active state. This allows for Parkin-mediated ubiquitination on other proteins. Because of its PINK1-mediated recruitment to the mitochondrial surface, Parkin can ubiquitylate proteins in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Some of these proteins include Mfn1/Mfn2 and mitoNEET. The ubiquitylation of mitochondrial surface proteins brings in mitophagy initiating factors. Parkin promotes ubiquitin chain linkages on both K63 and K48. K48 ubiquitination initiates degradation of the proteins, and could allow for passive mitochondrial degradation. K63 ubiquitination is thought to recruit autophagy adaptors LC3/GABARAP which will then lead to mitophagy. It is still unclear which proteins are necessary and sufficient for mitophagy, and how these proteins, once ubiquitylated, initiate mitophagy. Other pathways that can induce mitophagy includes mitophagy receptors on the outer mitochondrial membrane surface. These receptors include NIX1, BNIP3 and FUNDC1. All of these receptors contain LIR consensus sequences that bind LC3/GABARAP which can lead to the degradation of the mitochondria. In hypoxic conditions BNIP3 is upregulated by HIF1Œ±. BNIP3 is then phosphorylated at its serine residues near the LIR sequence which promotes LC3 binding. FUNDCI is also hypoxia sensitive, although it is constitutively present at the outer mitochondrial membrane during normal conditions In neurons, mitochondria are distributed unequally throughout the cell to areas where energy demand is high, like at synapses and Nodes of Ranvier. This distribution is maintained largely by motor protein-mediated mitochondrial transport along the axon. While neuronal mitophagy is thought to occur primarily in the cell body, it also occurs locally in the axon at sites distant from the cell body; in both the cell body and the axon, neuronal mitophagy occurs via the PINK1-Parkin pathway. Mitophagy in the nervous system may also occur transcellularly, where damaged mitochondria in retinal ganglion cell axons can be passed to neighboring astrocytes for degradation. This process is known as transmitophagy. = In yeast = Mitophagy in yeast was first presumed after the discovery of Yeast Mitochondrial Escape genes (yme), specifically yme1. Yme1 like other genes in the family showed increase escape of mtDNA, but was the only one that showed an increase in mitochondrial degradation. Through work on this gene which mediates the escape of mtDNA, researchers discovered that mitochondrial turnover is triggered by proteins. More was discovered about genetic control of mitophagy after studies on the protien UTH1. After performing a screen for genes that regulate longevity, it was found in ŒîUTH1 strains that there was an inhibition of mitophagy, which occurred without affecting autophagy mechanisms. This study also showed that the Uth1p protein is necessary to move mitochondria to the vacuole. This suggested there is a specialized system for mitophagy. Other studies looked at AUP1, a mitochondrial phosphatase, and found Aup1 marks mitochondria for elimination. Another yeast protein associated with mitophagy is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein, Mdm38p/Mkh1p. This protein is part of the complex that exchanges K+/H+ ions across the inner membrane. Deletions in this protein causes swelling, a loss of membrane potential, and mitochondrial fragmentation. Recently, it has been shown that ATG32 (autophagy related gene 32) plays a crucial role in yeast mitophagy. It is localized to the mitochondria. Once mitophagy is initiated, Atg32 binds to Atg11 and the Atg32-associated mitochondria are transported to the vacuole. Atg32 silencing stops recruitment of autophagy machinery and mitochondrial degradation. Atg32 is not necessary for other forms of autophagy. All of these proteins likely play a role in maintaining healthy mitochondria, but mutations have shown that dysregulation can lead to a selective degradation of mitochondria. Whether these proteins work in concert, are main players in mitophagy, or members in a larger network to control autophagy still remains to be elucidated.  Relation to disease =Cancer= As of 2020, the role of mitophagy in cancer is not fully understood. Some models of mitophagy, such as PINK1 or BNIP3-mediated mitophagy, have been associated with tumor suppression in humans and mice. Mitophagy associated with NIX, in contrast, is associated with tumor promotion. In 1920 Otto Warburg observed that certain cancerous tumors display a metabolic shift towards glycolysis. This is referred to as the \\"Warburg effect\\", in which cancer cells produce energy via the conversion of glucose into lactate, even in the presence of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis). Despite nearly a century since it was first described, a lot of questions remained unanswered regarding the Warburg effect. Initially, Warburg attributed this metabolic shift to mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer cells. Further studies in tumor biology have shown that the increased growth rate in cancer cells is due to an overdrive in glycolysis (glycolytic shift), which leads to a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial density. As a consequence of the Warburg effect, cancer cells would produce large amounts of lactate. The excess lactate is then released to the extracellular environment which results in a decrease in extracellular pH. This micro- environment acidification can lead to cellular stress, which would lead to autophagy. Autophagy is activated in response to a range of stimuli, including nutrient depletion, hypoxia, and activated oncogenes. However, it appears that autophagy can help in cancer cell survival under conditions of metabolic stress and it may confer resistance to anti-cancer therapies such as radiation and chemotherapy. Additionally, in the microenvironment of cancer cells, there is an increase in hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1-alpha (HIF1A), which promotes expression of BNIP3, an essential factor for mitophagy. =Parkinson's disease= Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder pathologically characterized by death of the dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra. There are several genetic mutations implicated in Parkinson's disease, including loss of function PINK1 and Parkin. Loss of function in either of these genes results in accumulation of damaged mitochondria and aggregation of proteins ‚Äì eventually leading to neuronal death. Mitochondria dysfunction is thought to be involved in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. In spontaneous, usually aging related Parkinson's disease (non-genetically linked), the disease is commonly caused by dysfunctional mitochondria, cellular oxidative stress, autophagic alterations and the aggregation of proteins. These can lead to mitochondrial swelling and depolarization. It is important to keep the dysfunctional mitochondria regulated, because all of these traits could be induced by mitochondrial dysfunction and can induce cell death. Disorders in energy creation by mitochondria can cause cellular degeneration, like those seen in the substantia nigra.

Morse, 56 U.S. (15 How.) 62 (1853),. also known as The Telegraph Patent Case, is an 1854 decision of the United States Supreme Court that has been highly influential in the development of the law of patent-eligibility in regard to claimed inventions in the field of computer-software related art. It holds, essentially, that an abstract idea, apart from its implementation, is not patent-eligible. Background The figure illustrates the problem that Morse addressed: signal amplitude decreases with distance traversed until noise (jagged red) overcomes signal ‚Äì plot showing signal voltage vs. distance from source. The problem that would-be telegraphers faced in the early 19th century is explained in the Court's opinion:\\"The great difficulty in their way was the fact that the galvanic current, however strong in the beginning, became gradually weaker as it advanced on the wire; and was not strong enough to produce a mechanical effect, after a certain distance had been traversed.‚Äù (See figure at right illustrating problem Court describes.) To send a signal from Baltimore to Washington would require thousands of volts and high currents ‚Äì not feasible at a time when managing to make a pickled frog‚Äôs legs twitch, as Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta did, was the major achievement of the electro-galvanic force. The figure illustrates the great question, \\"What did Morse invent?\\" Did he invent the depicted apparatus and no more? Did he invent the more generic and abstract formulation of claim 8 ‚Äî the use of electromagnetism, however developed, for marking intelligible characters at any distance? Samuel Morse‚Äôs ‚Äúplan [was] combining two or more electric or galvanic circuits, with independent batteries for the purpose of overcoming the diminished force of electromagnetism in long circuits.‚Äù The concept is illustrated in the figure shown at the right. Morse inserted the relays (or ‚Äúrepeaters‚Äù as the opinion terms them) at sufficiently short intervals (say, every 15 to 20 miles) so that the signal was regularly restored to its initial level before noise could swamp it out. Effect of repeaters The effect of Morse's use of \\"repeaters\\" is shown in the figure at the left, a graph of signal amplitude (with noise) vs. distance. The signal decays between repeaters, but Morse restores the signal to a predetermined level before it falls into the noise. That permits the message to be sent to great distances, which was previously not feasible. Daniel Broadbent (Jun. 30, 1811 in Dukinfield, England - Apr. 11, 1879 in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania), a prominent Philadelphia Patent Attorney represented Morse, and William McConnell (Apr. 17, 1812 in Louisville, Kentucky - Jun. 28, 1870 in New Orleans, Louisiana), a prominent Louisville Patent Attorney represented O'Reilly. Broadbent was a graduate of Princeton University and the University of Pennsylvania, and later became a Colonel in the Union Army during the American Civil War, being wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg. McConnell was a graduate of Georgetown University, in addition to being a lawyer, McConnell also owned a large plantation near Glasgow, Kentucky, which led to him being financially ruined by the Civil War, this led to McConnell killing himself in his New Orleans Hotel Room on June 28, 1870. Supreme Court opinion Samuel Morse =Majority opinion=Morse's claim 8 While the case concerned a number of other issues, such as whether Morse was indeed first to invent the telegraph, the issue of lasting importance concerned Morse's eighth claim, which was directed to a method of communicating intelligible information to any distance by means of exploiting the electro-magnetic force: > Eighth. I do not propose to limit myself to the specific machinery or parts > of machinery described in the foregoing specification and claims; the > essence of my invention being the use of the motive power of the electric or > galvanic current, which I call electro-magnetism, however developed for > marking or printing intelligible characters, signs, or letters, at any > distances, being a new application of that power of which I claim to be the > first inventor or discoverer. What did Morse invent? As Justice Taney, speaking for the majority of the Court, explained it, \\"He claims the exclusive right to every improvement where the motive power is the electric or galvanic current, and the result is the marking or printing intelligible characters, signs, or letters at a distance.\\" Although \\"it required the highest order of mechanical skill to execute and adjust the nice and delicate work necessary to put the telegraph into operation,\\" Morse did not \\"invent\\" what he claimed: \\"Professor Morse has not discovered that the electric or galvanic current will always print at a distance, no matter what may be the form of the machinery or mechanical contrivances through which it passes.\\" Morse did not enable others to do more than make the repeater system that he described. Other persons may discover and disclose to the public other ways to use electromagnetic force to transmit messages, and the other ways may be cheaper or work better. \\"In fine, he claims an exclusive right to use a manner and process which he has not described and indeed had not invented, and therefore could not describe when he obtained his patent. The court is of opinion that the claim is too broad, and not warranted by law.\\" Enablement and \\"abstract idea\\" In reaching the conclusion that Morse's claim 8 was too broad and thus not subject to patent protection, the Court considered not only the fact that Morse did not teach and enable other ways to communicate information at a great distance by using the electromagnetic force,See 35 U.S.C. sec. 112(a), which requires patentees to disclose their inventions in sufficient detail that others are enabled to practice the invention without undue experimentation. but also whether the claim was at such a high level of generality and abstraction that it claimed an \\"idea\\" rather than a practical application and implementation of an idea. In analyzing this aspect of the case, the Court looked to a recent English decision, Neilson v. Harford.151 Eng. Rep. 1266, 8 M & W 806, Web. Pat. Cases 295 (Exch. 1841). Neilson upheld a patent on using heated air to oxidize carbon in cast iron in a Bessemer Converter against the claim that it was just a patent on the idea or principle that heating the injected air makes a blast furnace work better. The court pointed to the apparatus that Neilson used to preheat the air, which made the patent one on an implementation of the principle, not one on the principle itself. Morse, of course, disclosed apparatus only for the repeater system and no other. The language of the English court, picked up by the Supreme Court, was important in 20th century computer software cases:See, for example, Parker v. Flook. > We think the case must be considered as if, the principle being well known, > the plaintiff had first invented a mode of applying it by a mechanical > apparatus to furnaces; and his invention then consists in this ‚Äì the > interposing a receptacle for heated air between the blowing apparatus and > the furnace. In this receptacle he directs the air to be heated, by the > application of heat externally to the receptacle, and thus he accomplishes > the object of applying the blast, which before was of cold air, in a heated > state to the furnace. =Dissent= Justice Grier, dissenting in Morse, asked, \\"What is meant by a claim [specifically, Morse's claim 8] being too broad?\\" Grier said, \\"It is only when he claims something before known and used, something as new which is not new, either by mistake or intentionally.\\" That is, a claim is overbroad only if it encroaches beyond the frontiers of the prior art (covers prior art devices). Of course, that completely ignores the enablement requirement of what is now section 112 of the patent code.35 U.S.C. sec. 112.

He was chairman of Farepak. Early and private life Johnson was born in St Giles's Hospital in Camberwell, England, United Kingdom, the youngest child and only son of Bert Johnson and his wife Lily (n√©e Good). His father worked as a clerk at a meat depot. He and his mother were evacuated to Torbay during the Blitz. His father stayed in London to work, and his parents later separated and were divorced in 1948. Johnson was educated in Devon. He converted to Roman Catholicism aged 12, and studied at a Catholic boarding school, St Mary's, at Clyst St Mary in Devon. He married Bruna Gilodi, a native of Italy, in 1971. They have two children, Nicholas and Chiara. Business career Johnson left school aged 18 with no formal qualifications, and went to work in Rooksby's butcher's shops in Peckham, owned by John Manson Ltd. Together with William Knapman and another partner, his father was co-owner of Manson, a chain of around 110 butcher's shops based in and around south London. Despite being the son of one of the company's owners, he was shown no favouritism, and left after 3 years to study theology and philosophy with the White Fathers in Ireland with thoughts of becoming a missionary. After 2 years in Ireland, Johnson became a novice in England and then spent a year in France, but he left the Order aged 26 before taking vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Johnson returned to John Manson Ltd in 1966, becoming a trainee meat buyer at Smithfield Market, and then becoming the manager of the company's butcher's shop on the King's Road. Shortly afterwards, Johnson took charge of the company's new acquisition, the Farepak hamper business, which operated through local agents offering hampers through a Christmas saving club. The company was able to secure an increasing market share due to the decline of the high street butchers that offers a similar service. The butchers were facing stiff competition for their regular trade from the expanding supermarkets, but the supermarkets did not enter the hamper business. The Farepak operations moved to Swindon in 1979. Johnson became managing director of Mansons in 1980. He wanted the company to move away from high street butchery and to concentrate on selling mail order hampers, but his father and the other directors did not agree. The dispute was resolved in 1984 by Farepak demerging from Mansons. Johnson left with the demerged Farepak and grew the business rapidly, but the rump of Manson's butcher's business stagnated under Knapman's control. Farepak expanded its mail-order hamper business to include frozen food, drinks, Christmas gifts, and shopping vouchers. The company became a plc in 1989, and was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1993, with an annual turnover exceeding ¬£30 million. Farepak acquired Kleeneze in 1995, adding door-to-door sales of household cleaning products to the mail-order hamper business. Farepak was renamed as Kleeneze plc in 1999. By 2001, the group had an annual turnover of over ¬£200 million with a market capitalisation exceeding ¬£85 million. Johnson and his family continued to hold over half of its shares. Philanthropy In later life, Johnson spent time on philanthric activities. He funded expeditions to Malawi, Ghana and Indonesia by orthopaedic surgeon Hein Raat, and became a funder and trustee of the Impact Foundation which operates hospitals in Africa, India and Bangladesh. He also funded a Chair of European Thought at Oxford University in 1997, and donated money to the Refugee Studies Centre in Oxford which studies forced migration. Johnson was also a member of the Worshipful Company of Butchers, and a freeman of the City of London. Johnson became a director of (and investor in) Prospect magazine, sponsored Garsington Opera, collected works of art, and advised the Ashmolean Museum and Bodleian Library. He died of a heart attack on 10 August 2001, while on holiday at Olbia in Sardinia. He was survived by his wife and two children.

The show was hosted by George Lewis until 1969 and by Jule Huffman until 1995. The show ended its run in May 1995 when Huffman retired. Format The program consisted of cartoons for a studio audience of children. While cartoons and commercials aired, the children would play off-camera games such as musical chairs. One of show's daily segments featured a selected audience member attempting to answer a riddle as read by Mr. Cartoon. Production Jule Huffman conceived the idea of cartoons for a studio audience after George Lewis left the program. Huffman's \\"Mr. Cartoon\\" was accompanied by an animal sidekick, known as \\"Beeper\\" who joined the show in 1974. Before that, Mr. Cartoon was generally accompanied by one of Hanna-Barbera's Banana Splits, which ended in December 1969. Beeper was known as Mr. Cartoon's \\"friend,\\" and got the name Beeper following a contest in which kids sent in their suggestions for the creature's name. Broadcast history The show aired at 4 p.m. on weekdays for one hour until September 1988, when the show was replaced in its daily time slot by The Oprah Winfrey Show. From then until May 1995, Mr. Cartoon was shown on Saturday mornings. Legacy WSAZ brought back Beeper as a mascot.

Controversy In 2007, the MOPH Service Foundation was rated \\"F\\" by the American Institute of Philanthropy (AIP) because only 32% of money raised for the organization went to charity programs. Later that year, executive director Richard Esau was fired from the Service Foundation after an audit showed money spent on possible conflict of interest projects. Money was donated to the Intrepid Museum in New York City shortly before the museum hired the daughter of a member of the Foundation's board of directors. The Foundation gave $100,000 to the Marine Corps Reserve Officers Association, where Esau had once worked and his wife still worked. In 2010, Ret. Col. Henry Cook III sued the MOPH, saying he was wrongfully dismissed from his post as National Commander. In an affidavit submitted, Cook says his removal was \\"for my exposing of the mismanagement of funds and grants of \\"Purple Heart Dollars\\" on national television.\\" The MOPH responded, \\"We absolutely disagree with Mr. Cook's allegations in the lawsuit, and we also disagree with Mr. Cook's effort to 'try' his case in the media. We will not otherwise comment on pending litigation, but rather will let this matter run its course through the court system.\\" The case was dismissed in June 2011.

He also wrote for publications such as the New York Times and Chicago Tribune as well as the Paris Metro (now defunct). In 1995 he co-wrote a travel guidebook for the San Francisco area called Our Town. After the near shutdown of the Oakland Tribune in 1991 and observing changes in the media landscape in the early years of the Internet, De Wolk moved into television and online journalism. =TV and online journalism= De Wolk moved to television journalism and worked at KTVU from 1991 until he left in 2013, on the eve of FOX News buying and taking over the once independent station.

Murrow Award for Investigative Journalism. He was part of the 16-member Oakland Tribune team that was awarded a 1990 Pulitzer Prize for its spot news photography coverage of the World Series earthquake in 1989. De Wolk and Leslie Griffith won a Casey Award from the Journalism Center on Children & Families at the University of Maryland for their 1998 KTVU investigative news story called \\"Candy Kids\\", about the exploitation of children in violation of labor laws in selling candy. The citation called it a \\"provocative report on a subject rarely examined. It showed true enterprise and initiative and followed up with additional reporting.

De Wolk won a James Madison Award in 2008 for digging into public records about the Metropolitan Transportation Commission's loss of income from drivers who obstruct the collection of fees for using its FasTrak system on bridges. KTVU-TV In July 2013, De Wolk was employed as a producer with KTVU-TV, when the station's news team broadcast false and racially insensitive names of pilots involved in the July 2013 Asiana airplane crash at San Francisco International Airport. Anchor Tori Campbell read all four fake names on air. The names had reportedly been emailed to De Wolk by a trusted source, and he forwarded them to the newsroom with the warning \\"you'd better check these out.\\" The names were confirmed by the National Transportation Safety Board before they were aired; the NTSB later apologized and said the mistaken confirmation had been given by a summer intern \\"acting outside the scope of his authority\\". Three other producers were fired by KTVU after the incident. De Wolk retained legal counsel and took action against KTVU. The station quickly settled, issuing a statement that De Wolk and KTVU had \\"reached an amicable agreement;\\" details were not released. Earlier in 2013, Electronic Frontier Foundation technologist Micah Lee claimed that De Wolk interviewed him for KTVU on the subject of doxing and its free speech implications, but inserted quotes from that interview in a story that aired on the subject of swatting, which Lee says was not discussed during the interview. The story was routinely removed from KTVU's website as were all such stories on KTVU servers as company policy for server space. The Executive Producer issued a statement to the EFF stating that after reviewing the raw tapes of the interview the station \\"unequivocally stands by its story.\\" Publications * Gary Kauf and Roland De Wolk, Our Town: 50 Terrific Bay Area Escapes (Chronicle, 1995) * Roland De Wolk (text) and John Swain (photographs), Northern California's Best Family Campgrounds: 50 Fun, Affordable, Kid-Friendly Sites (Chronicle, 1997) * Roland De Wolk, Introduction to Online Journalism: Publishing News and Information (Pearson, 2000). * Roland De Wolk, American Disruptor: The Scandalous Life of Leland Stanford, 2019.

During World War II he served as the Manhattan Project's California Area Engineer, where he worked with Ernest O. Lawrence's Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, which was developing calutrons for electromagnetic isotope separation. As such, he was responsible for the administration of contracts between the Army and the University of California.  Early life  Harold Alvin Fidler was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on August 2, 1910. He studied civil engineering, earning a Bachelor of Science degree from Drexel Institute of Technology in 1932. He then went to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), from which he earned a Master of Science in civil engineering in 1934, writing his thesis on \\"A precise determination of stresses in bridges due to wind loads\\", and a Doctor of Science in civil engineering in 1940, writing his thesis on \\"Investigation of stress-strain relationships of granular soils by a new cylindrical compression apparatus\\". While he was at MIT, he joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC). He also met Lillian E. Saari. They were married in 1939, and had three children, Marjorie, Donald and Richard.  Manhattan Project  After his graduation from MIT, he became Engineer-in- charge of the Foundation Investigation Section at the United States Army Corps of Engineers in Ithaca, New York. In this capacity, he worked as a civilian, but in 1942, with the United States at war during World War II, was called to active duty as a first lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers. He was one of the first officers assigned to the Manhattan District. He was posted to California, where Ernest O. Lawrence was developing an electromagnetic isotope separation process using devices known as calutrons at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Major Thomas T. Crenshaw, Jr., became California Area Engineer in August 1942, with Fidler as his assistant. Crenshaw established his office in the Donner Laboratory at the University of California. Crenshaw soon left, and Fidler replaced him as California Area Engineer. The Army formally took over the contracts with the University of California from the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) on May 1, 1943, and it became Fidler's task to administer them. He worked closely with Kenneth Priestly, the Radiation Laboratory's business manager, and Robert M. Underbill, the secretary and treasurer of the University Board of Regents. Fidler worked to expedite the procurement and delivery of materials, particularly those that were scarce and in short supply. For security reasons, he wore civilian clothes rather than a uniform. Among his duties was to keep the University's President, Robert Gordon Sproul informed of the physical needs of the Manhattan Project. Fidler also submitted regular reports on the activity of the Radiation Laboratory to the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., and briefed him, on his visits to Berkeley, which were made about once a month between October 1942 and November 1943. As part of his role in coordinating the electromagnetic process, Fidler occasionally visited Chicago, which was more convenient for contractors like Westinghouse, General Electric, and Allis Chalmers; Boston, where the offices of Stone & Webster, the main engineering contractor were located; and the production facilities at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. He attained the rank of major. After World War II ended in August 1945, Fidler was transferred to Tennessee, where he worked on the declassification of Manhattan Project documents. He was awarded the Legion of Merit for his work on the Manhattan Project, which was presented by Groves at a ceremony at Lawrence's home on October 21, 1945.  Later life  Fidler left the Army, but continued to work on declassification in Washington, D.C., for the Atomic Energy Commission, which replaced the Manhattan Project on January 1, 1947. In 1949, he returned to Berkeley as the Atomic Energy Commission's Area Manager on the West Coast. In this capacity he was responsible for research activities on the West Coast, and was involved in the selection of the site for the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, the Atomic Energy Commission's second weapons laboratory. On December 1, 1958, at the request of Ernest Lawrence, Fidler joined the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory as Associate Director. He remained in the role until 1974, when he and the director, Edwin McMillan, both retired. He also served on the Atomic Energy Commission's Management Advisory Committee from 1962 to 1972. He died at his Piedmont Gardens Retirement Community home in Oakland, California, on April 2, 2004. He was survived by his three children, his wife having predeceased him in 1991.

Later, he was in charge of special duties at the Presidency of the Republic and headed the diplomatic affairs division at the Presidency. Sadi was Technical Adviser to the Cabinet of the President from 1983 to 1985. After working for three months as Director of Studies and Information at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he was appointed as Deputy Director of the Civil Cabinet of the Presidency. He was then appointed again as Technical Adviser to the Presidency; subsequently he was Technical Adviser at the head of the Secretariat-General of the Presidency's diplomatic affairs division from 1995 to 2004.

Sadi succeeded Joseph Charles Doumba, whose health was reportedly poor, as Secretary-General. Speaking to The Post prior to the July 2007 parliamentary election, Sadi expressed satisfaction with his party's mobilization and explained that he was delivering Biya's message, which \\"dwells on hope and encouragement\\", on the campaign trail. He said that the RDPC's priorities included electoral reform, decentralization of decision-making to the local level, measures to promote good governance and fight corruption, the development of the economy and cooperation with the private sector, and improvements in education and public health.\\"CPDM militants are upbeat, united - CPDM SG\\", The Post, 20 July 2007. Following the election, in which the RDPC won an overwhelming majority of seats, Sadi denied the opposition's accusations of fraud; according to Sadi, the opposition displayed an undemocratic mindset by refusing to acknowledge legitimate defeat and blaming the RDPC instead of engaging in self-criticism. Sadi said that the RDPC won because it had delivered real results to the people and engaged in grassroots campaigning.\\"Cameroon‚Äôs ruling party calls on opposition to play fair\\", African Press Agency, 26 July 2007. By 2008, there was speculation that Sadi, who held a key post at the Presidency and was also the RDPC's Secretary-General, could potentially succeed the aging Biya as President of the Republic, possibly at the time of the 2011 presidential election or the subsequent election.Mohamadou Houmfa, \\"Cameroun : Ren√© Emmanuel Sadi, futur Pr√©sident de la R√©publique ?\\", Afriquechos, 29 May 2008 .

According to one analysis, Sadi was Biya's most likely successor. It was surmised that the RDPC leadership would prefer a successor who was not associated with Biya's own native region in the south, and Sadi's status as a northerner of Christian faith could enable him to appeal broadly across both the largely Muslim north and the largely Christian south. Biya moved Sadi to the post of Minister for Special Duties on 30 June 2009.Jean-Bruno Tagne, \\"Breaking news: Paul Biya modifie son Gouvernement !\\", Cameroon-info.net, 30 June 2009 .

It was initially based in Calcutta, but moved to New Delhi in 1956, and then Singapore in 1988. In 1984 it changed its name to the ICFTU-Asia Pacific Regional Organisation. In 2007, following the merger of the ICFTU and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the organisation merged with the WCL's Brotherhood of Asian Trade Unions, to form the ITUC Regional Organisation for Asia and Pacific. In 2006, the organisation described its aims thus: :The organisation seeks to bring about a just, welfare society with a higher standard of living. It believes that promoting a higher wage policy and the dignity and status of workers through a stronger trade union movement will help achieve this. Equipping workers with the skills to fight for fundamental rights, including the setting up of bona fide trade unions is perhaps its major undertaking.

The game was played on January 16, 1966, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles in front of a crowd of 60,124. The coach of the Eastern Conference, Blanton Collier of the Cleveland Browns, used the domination of the West that year as a rallying cry for the Eastern team as they prepared to take the field against the Western Conference stars coached by Vince Lombardi of the Green Bay Packers. During the 1965 season, the Western Conference had dominated the Eastern Conference ‚Äî Western teams had won the league championship as well as 13 of the 14 regular season inter-conference games. This apparent domination extended to the college ranks as well with the West team winning the East-West college all-star game and the Rose Bowl. At the same time, Lombardi felt his West squad was at an unfair disadvantage in the game due to a denial by the league of a last minute appeal to use his own team's quarterback, Bart Starr, in the game. Starr had previously been scratched due to injury, but had recovered sufficiently to play. Dale Meinert of the St. Louis Cardinals was named the \\"lineman of the game\\" while the Cleveland Browns' fullback Jim Brown was awarded \\"back of the game\\" honors for the third time in his career.

Cuirasses and helmets were manufactured in Japan as early as the 4th century CE. Tank≈ç, worn by foot soldiers and keik≈ç, worn by horsemen were both pre-samurai types of early Japanese cuirass constructed from iron plates connected together by leather thongs. During the Heian period (794-1185), the unique Japanese samurai armour ≈ç-yoroi and d≈ç-maru appeared. Luxurious and heavily armed ≈ç-yoroi were worn by senior mounted samurai, while the lighter d≈ç-maru were worn by lower-class infantry samurai.ÂºèÊ≠£„ÅÆÈéß„ÉªÂ§ßÈéß Costume Museum The Japanese cuirass evolved into the more familiar style of armour worn by the samurai known as the dou or d≈ç. Japanese armour makers started to use leather (nerigawa), and lacquer was used to weatherproof the armour parts. Leather and or iron scales were used to construct samurai armour, with leather and eventually silk lace used to connect the individual scales (kozane) from which these cuirasses were now being made. The artistic decoration of ≈ç-yoroi reached its peak around the time of the Genpei War at the end of the Heian period. At the end of the 14th century, towards the end of the Kamakura period, even senior samurai often used lightweight d≈ç-maru. In the 16th century, Japan began trading with Europe during what would become known as the Nanban trade. Matchlock muskets were first introduced to Japan by the Portuguese in 1543. The matchlock muskets were named \\"Tanegashima\\" after the first island they arrived on. Soon after, when Japanese swordsmiths began to mass-produce matchlock muskets in Japan, the war in Japan changed completely. The samurai needed armour that was lighter and more protective. In addition, large-scale battles required armor that could be mass-produced. As a result, a new style of armour called tosei-gusoku (gusoku), which means modern armour, appeared. Gusoku evolved from the d≈ç-maru lineage. Kozane has changed to itazane, which is made of relatively large iron plate or platy leather, and has improved its defenses. Itazane can also be said to replace a row of individual kozanes with a single steel plate or platy of leather. Since the armour is no longer flexible, gusoku has changed its method to make it easier to put on and take off by opening and closing the armour with a hinge. The simplified structure of the armour makes it easier to manufacture, allowing armor makers to focus on design and increasing the variety of armour looks. For example, the iron plate was designed to imitate the chest of an old man, and d≈ç-maru style gusoku was made by attaching colored threads to the surface of the iron plate. The type of gusoku, like the plate armour, in which the front and back dou are made from a single iron plate with a raised center and a V-shaped bottom, was called Nanban dou gusoku (Western type gusoku). Bullet resistant armours were developed called tameshi gusoku (\\"bullet tested\\"), allowing samurai to continue wearing their armour despite the use of firearms. Samurai in this period, especially high ranking samurai such as daimyo, owned a lot of armor. For example, it has been confirmed that Tokugawa Ieyasu owned dozens of armor, and they are now owned by Kun≈çzan T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´, Nikk≈ç T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´, Kish≈´ T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´, Tokugawa Art Museum, The Tokugawa Museum, Tokyo National Museum, etc.‰πÖËÉΩÂ±±Êù±ÁÖßÂÆÆ ‰∏ª„Å™ÂèéËîµÂìÅÂ§ßÂæ≥Â∑ùÂ±ï ‰ΩúÂìÅ„É™„Çπ„Éà Êù±‰∫¨ÂõΩÁ´ãÂçöÁâ©È§®Ëâ≤„ÄÖÁ≥∏Â®Å‰∫åÊûöËÉ¥ÂÖ∑Ë∂≥ The era of warfare called the Sengoku period ended around 1600, when a united Japan entered the peaceful Edo period. Although samurai continued to use both plate and lamellar armour as a symbol of their status, traditional armours were no longer necessary for battles. For this reason, in the Edo period, armour in the style of the revival of the medieval period, incorporating gorgeous ≈ç-yoroi and d≈ç-maru designs, became popular.Áî≤ÂÜë„Å´Ë¶ã„ÇãÊ±üÊà∏ÊôÇ‰ª£Â±ï5 Ê≠¶Â£´„Å®Ê≠¶‰∫∫„ÅÆÁî≤ÂÜëÂÉè Fukuoka City Museum During the Edo period lightweight, portable, and secret hidden armours became popular, since personal protection was still needed. Civil strife, duels, assassinations, and peasant revolts all required the use of armours such as the kusari katabira (chain armour jacket) and armoured sleeves, as well as other types of armour which could be worn under ordinary clothing. Edo period samurai were in charge of internal security and would wear various types of kusari gusoku (chain armour) and shin and arm protection as well as forehead protectors (hachi-gane). Armour continued to be worn and used in Japan until the end of the samurai era (Meiji period) in the 1860s, with the last use of samurai armour happening in 1877 during the Satsuma Rebellion.

Bevor - yodare-kake (Ë•üÂªª) Japanese armour was generally constructed from many small iron (tetsu) and/or leather (nerigawa) scales (kozane) and/or plates (ita-mono), connected to each other by rivets and macram√© cords (odoshi) made from leather and/or braided silk, and/or chain armour (kusari). Noble families had silk cords made in specific patterns and colors of silk thread. Many of these cords were constructed of well over 100 strands of silk. Making these special silk cords could take many months of steady work, just to complete enough for one suit of armour. These armour plates were usually attached to a cloth or leather backing. Japanese armour was designed to be as lightweight as possible as the samurai had many tasks including riding a horse and archery in addition to swordsmanship. The armour was usually brightly lacquered to protect against the harsh Japanese climate. Chain armour (kusari) was also used to construct individual armour pieces and full suits of kusari were even used. Individual armour parts The itazane-structured dou (cuirass), the quirky designs of kabuto (helmet) and mengu (face guard), are typical features of the gusoku armour. Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period, 16th-17th century, Suntory Museum of Art A full suit of traditional Samurai armour could include the following items: *Dou or d≈ç, a chest armour made up of iron and or leather plates of various sizes and shapes with pendents *Kusazuri made from iron or leather plates hanging from the front and back of the dou (d≈ç) to protect the lower body and upper leg. *Sode, large rectangular shoulder protection made from iron and or leather plates. *Kote, armoured glove like sleeves which extended to the shoulder or han kote (kote gauntlets) which covered the forearms. Kote were made from cloth covered with iron plates of various size and shape, connected by chain armour (kusari). *Kabuto, a helmet made from iron or leather plates (from 3 to over 100 plates) riveted together. A neck guard shikoro made from several layers of curved iron or leather strips was suspended from the bottom edge of the kabuto. *Mengu, various types of lacquered metal and or leather facial armour designed in a way that the top heavy helmet kabuto could be tied and secured to them by various metal posts. Mengu had throat guards yodare-kake made from several rows of iron or leather plates or kusari (chain armour) sewn to a cloth backing, suspended from the bottom edge. *Haidate, thigh guards which tied around the waist and covered the thighs. These were made from cloth with small iron and or leather plates of various size and shape, usually connected to each other by chain armour (kusari) and sewn to the cloth. *Suneate, shin guards made from iron splints connected together by chain armour (kusari) and sewn to cloth and tied around the calf. Auxiliary armours * Guruwa, a type of throat and neck protector. * Nodowa, a type of throat and neck guard. * Tate-eri, the tate-eri is a small padded pillow like piece with a standing armored collar that sits on the shoulder to protect from the weight of the dou (d≈ç). The standing collar would be lined with kikko armour to protect the neck. * Manju no wa, the manju no wa, (also manjunowa or manju nowa) is a combination of shoulder pads, collar and armpit guards in one that protected the upper chest area. Manju no wa were covered with kusari (chain armour), karuta (small armour plates), or kikko (brigandine), these armours or a combination of them were sewn to a cloth backing. The armour could be exposed or hidden between a layer of cloth. When worn the manju no wa looked like a small tight fitting vest. Manju no wa have small wings that would pass under the arm pit area from the back and attach to the front of the manju no wa. * Manchira, the manchira is a type of armoured- vest covered with kusari (chain armour), karuta (small armour plates) or kikko (brigandine), these armours or a combination of them were sewn to a cloth backing. The armour could be exposed or hidden between a layer of cloth. Manchira are larger than manju no wa and protected the chest area and sometimes the neck and arm pit. Some manchira could be worn over the dou (d≈ç). * Wakibiki, the wakibiki is a simple rectangle of cloth covered with kusari (chain armour), karuta (small iron plates), or kikko (brigandine) these armorus or a combination of them were sewn to the cloth backing.

The term, a play on hat trick, was coined by Panthers goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck after teammate Scott Mellanby killed a rat in the locker room prior to the team's home opener with his stick, then scored two goals with the same stick. By the time the Panthers reached the 1996 playoffs, thousands of rats hit the ice after every Panthers goal, resulting in an off-season rule change by the NHL that allowed for referees to penalize the home team if fans disrupted the game by throwing objects onto the ice. Origin The 1995‚Äì96 season was the third in the NHL for the Panthers, who had been awarded as an expansion franchise in 1992. The team was composed of journeymen veterans and rookies and led by all-star goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck. As the team prepared for its home opener against the Calgary Flames on October 8, 1995, a rat entered the dressing room, startling several players. Scott Mellanby reacted by shooting the rat across the locker room with his stick, killing it. He then went out and scored two goals in a 4‚Äì3 victory over the Flames, leading the Panthers to their first win of the season. Vanbiesbrouck described the incident to reporters after the game, stating that while Mellanby failed to score a hat trick (three goals in one game), he did manage a \\"rat trick\\". During the next game, a fan threw a plastic rat onto the ice following a Panthers goal. The following game, a few more rats hit the ice. Eventually, over 100 rats were tossed to the ice following Panthers goals, as the Panthers emerged as a top team in the league by mid-November. Eventually, Florida finished the regular season in third place in the Atlantic Division, and qualified for the playoffs for the first time. Additionally, this Panthers' playoff appearance coincided with the Year of the Rat in the Chinese zodiac. This led fans to believe that the Panthers would have great luck in the playoffs. 1996 Stanley Cup playoffs In the first round of the 1996 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Panthers defeated the Boston Bruins in five games, then the Philadelphia Flyers in six games, to reach the Eastern Conference Finals. Then, they defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins in seven games to win the Prince of Wales Trophy as the rat-tossing craze reached its peak as 3,000 rats rained onto the ice following goals. While officially frowning on the practice of throwing rats, the team nonetheless brought on Orkin as a sponsor and employed a crew of 40 rink attendants dressed up as exterminators to clear the ice after each Florida goal. The \\"year of the rat\\" in south Florida reached a fever pitch as the Panthers made their only trip to the Stanley Cup Finals. Area supermarkets sold \\"rat cakes\\" (cupcakes with rats drawn in icing), while baseball's Florida Marlins showed the Panthers' game seven victory against the Penguins, in Pittsburgh, on the Jumbotron between innings on June 1 and had the Panthers' arena announcer on hand to announce when the team scored a goal. The Panthers, who had sold out only 15 of 41 home games during the regular season, sold out their first two playoff games against Philadelphia and Pittsburgh in seven minutes. They were set to face the Colorado Avalanche in the 1996 Stanley Cup Finals. In Game 1, a 3‚Äì1 Colorado victory, Colorado fans responded by throwing rat traps onto the ice in Denver following Avalanche goals. Colorado won Game 2 8‚Äì1 to lead the series 2‚Äì0 as the teams returned to Miami for Games 3 and 4. In the first period of Game 3, Colorado goaltender Patrick Roy famously refused to duck under his net, as other goalies had, to hide from the barrage of rats after Rob Niedermayer's goal at 11:19 put the Panthers up 2‚Äì1. During the intermission, Roy promised his teammates that there would be \\"no more rats\\". True to his word, Roy did not surrender another goal in that series as the Avalanche came back to win Game 3 3‚Äì2 in regulation time, then shut out the Panthers 1‚Äì0 in triple overtime in Game 4 to sweep the series and win Colorado's first Stanley Cup. Legacy Directly as a result of the rat trick craze, the NHL amended its rules prior to the season to prevent a recurrence of this phenomenon and delays to the game that followed. Per the rule, if fans throw debris onto the ice, the referee can have the public address announcer warn the fans to stop. After a warning, the referee can then issue a delay of game penalty to the home team. The league, however, created a special exemption for articles \\"thrown onto the ice following a special occasion\\", specifically excluding the traditional tossing of hats onto the ice following a hat trick goal from subjection to the penalty. The Panthers held a \\"Year of the Rat\\" alumni reunion in 2007 to celebrate the 1996 team and raise money for the Florida Panthers Foundation. As part of the event, the Panthers sold plastic rats for fans to toss onto the ice during the exhibition game, which saw the participation of at least nineteen members of the 1996 team. Mellanby, who retired in 2007, was always remembered for spawning the rat trick. \\"It became the motto of our team that season. When I played in the all-star game, a kid came up to me and said, 'You're the rat guy.' He didn't even know my name; he just knew I killed the rat.\\" With the Panthers' success in the 2011‚Äì12 NHL season, fans revived the rat tossing by throwing plastic rats onto the ice following home victories. On April 15, 2012, the Florida Panthers threw plastic rats on the ice after a 4‚Äì2 playoff victory over the New Jersey Devils. It was the first playoff victory for the Panthers since 1997. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, fans threw hundreds of rats onto the ice, making it the most since the run to the Cup. After victories at the BankAtlantic Center, workers would pick up the rats and return them to the Pantherland gift shop for resale. The Panthers organization alleged that Devils fans bought rats at Pantherland to throw them prematurely in an attempt to spur a penalty against the Panthers. Unwilling to assume the risk, the team decided to discontinue sales of toy rats at Pantherland. It remains unknown whether any other measures would be applied to discourage rat-throwing. In early 2013, sales of plastic rats resumed at Pantherland. As the Panthers neared the playoffs in March 2016, rats again started to appear on home ice, sometimes after Panther goals and more abundantly after home wins. Twenty years since the fateful playoff run, several members of the 1995‚Äì96 team returned to South Florida to be honored on March 12, 2016, including John Vanbiesbrouck, Brian Skrudland and Scott Mellanby.

They were introduced to the industry in the 1990s, and are important in interconnecting fiber optic cabling-based systems with existing copper-based, structured cabling systems. They are also used in metropolitan area network (MAN) access and data transport services to enterprise customers. Media conversion types Fiber media converters support many different data communication protocols including Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, T1/E1/J1, DS3/E3, as well as multiple cabling types such as coax, twisted pair, multi-mode and single-mode fiber optics. Media converter types range from small standalone devices and PC card converters to high port-density chassis systems that offer many advanced features for network management. On some devices, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) enables proactive management of link status, monitoring chassis environmental statistics and sending traps to network managers in the event of a fiber break or even link loss on the copper port. Fiber media converters can connect different local area network (LAN) media, modifying duplex and speed settings. Switching media converters can connect different speed network segments. For example, existing half-duplex hubs can be connected to 100BASE-TX Fast Ethernet network segments over 100BASE-FX fiber. When expanding the reach of the LAN to span multiple locations, media converters are useful in connecting multiple LANs to form one large campus area network that spans over a limited geographic area. As premises networks are primarily copper-based, media converters can extend the reach of the LAN over single-mode fiber up to 160 kilometers with 1550 nm optics. Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) technology in the LAN is especially beneficial in situations where fiber is in limited supply or expensive to provision. As well as conventional dual strand fiber converters, with separate receive and transmit ports, there are also single strand fiber converters, which can extend full-duplex data transmission up to 120 kilometers over one optical fiber. Other benefits of media conversion include providing a gradual migration path from copper to fiber. Fiber connections can greatly extend the reach and reduce electromagnetic interference. Also fiber media converters pose as an alternative solution for switches not supporting fiber; ordinary switches can use fiber media converters to connect to a fiber network. Converter types Opened case of a switching Fast Ethernet media converter (100BASE-TX to 100BASE-FX(SC)) Simple converters ‚Äì when the speed and duplex settings on both media is identical ‚Äì consist of two pairs of transmitters/receivers, each with their medium-dependent interfaces (when no data recoding is necessary) or their media-independent interfaces joined together back-to-back in a dual-simplex fashion. They can transport either half-duplex or full-duplex traffic but both sides must match. Switching converters contain a network bridge and can connect two half-duplex segments without joining their collision domains. Managed converters are usually of the switching kind and can additionally be managed by a network connection or a local console. However, most often pluggable transceivers are used instead when appropriate equipment already exists.

The screenplay by Willy Russell is based on his 1986 one- character play of the same title, which follows middle-aged Shirley Valentine in an unexpected discovery of herself, and rekindling of her childhood dreams and youthful love of life. Pauline Collins reprises the titular lead role as middle-aged housewife Shirley, which she had previously played in the stage production in London's West End and on Broadway, and Tom Conti plays Costas Dimitriades, the owner of a Greek tavern with whom she has a holiday romance. Plot Shirley Valentine is a 42-year-old Liverpudlian bored housewifeBloomsbury Publishing: Shirley Valentine & One For The Road Linked 1 January 2014 whose life and initially enriching marriage has settled into a narrow and unsatisfying rut, leaving few real friends and her childhood dreams unaccomplished. When her flamboyant friend Jane (Alison Steadman) wins a trip for two to Greece, Shirley uncharacteristically puts herself first and accepts Jane's invitation. Shirley feels considerable self-doubt, and ultimately only goes because of unexpected encouragement from her neighbour Gillian (Julia McKenzie), who drops her air of superiority to reveal her respect and emotional support of Shirley's plans, and former school enemy Marjorie Majors (Joanna Lumley), who reveals she had in fact been envious of Shirley's rebellious role at school, and had become a high class prostitute rather than a prestigious air hostess. Upon arrival, Jane immediately abandons Shirley for a holiday romance with a fellow passenger from their flight, leaving Shirley to set out on her own. She begins to see her fellow holidaymakers through new eyes, as she genuinely enjoys Greece while they want British food and stereotypical entertainment. She remains contentedly alone until she meets Costas Dimitriades (Conti), the owner of a nearby tavern, who helps her fulfil a dream of drinking wine by the seashore in the country where the grapes were grown, and later invites her to travel around the nearby islands for a day on his brother's boat. Costas promises not to try to seduce her, while nonetheless bolstering her self-confidence in her own attractiveness. As Shirley prepares for the trip, Jane returns and begs for forgiveness for abandoning her; Jane is then stunned to find that Shirley has made plans on her own and will be going out with Costas imminently. Enjoying the day out, Shirley decides to swim in the sea; lacking a swimsuit, she swims naked instead with Costas joining her in the water. She realises that she does not want Costas to keep his promise. They kiss and later on the boat have very intense sex. On her return, Jane believes that Shirley has fallen in love with Costas, but Shirley reveals to the audience that she has fallen in love with the idea of living. She spends more time with Costas, and at the airport turns back, and walks to Costas's tavern to find him attempting to seduce another tourist the same way. Costas is shocked to see Shirley after her departure, but she says she wants a job and is not upset at catching him in the act. Shirley's husband Joe (Bernard Hill), who was angry and confused at her departure, waits for her return with a large armful of flowers. He is shocked and embarrassed to find Shirley chose to stay and is not on the plane, and repeatedly calls her, pleading and arguing for her to return, saying that it is her place and she is embarrassing him, or telling her that her actions result from a midlife crisis or menopause. Shirley becomes more content with her new life. She also becomes a great success with narrow-minded holiday makers who want the same food as in Britain. Finally, their son tells Joe to go and get her instead of just phoning. Receiving a telegram about Joe's arrival, Costas makes excuses and leaves for the day, while Shirley is unperturbed. Joe walks from the airport. Shirley, wearing sunglasses and now feeling like a different person, is sipping wine by the sea in the sunset. Joe does not recognise her and walks past until she calls him back. The film ends with the two drinking wine by the sea, leaving open the question of how the matter resolved.

The film's theme song, \\"The Girl Who Used to Be Me\\", was written by Marvin Hamlisch and Alan and Marilyn Bergman, and performed by Patti Austin. In various versions of the film, as modified for distribution, child viewing, and television, the line spoken by Costas has been changed to avoid the use of adult language. Release The film opened the Montreal Film Festival at the Th√©√¢tre Maisonneuve on 24 August 1989. Unlike most openers of the festival in French-speaking Quebec, it was shown without French subtitles. The film opened in North America on 30 August and in the UK on 27 October 1989. =Critical reception= The film was generally received favourably, and went on to win a number of awards; criticisms generally focused on the transition from one- person play to screen in which Collins's acting provided the strength of the film and much of the rest was seen as weak. Jow Brown of the Washington Post called the film \\"an uncommonly warm, relaxed little movie . . . without a cloying artificially sweetened aftertaste.\\" He continued, \\"The story's a bit of romantic whimsy, but it affords a great many comfortable and comforting laughs, and may even serve as a wake-up call for some.\\"Washington Post review Variety called the film \\"uneven but generally delightful\\" and Pauline Collins \\"irresistible.\\"Variety review Radio Times rated the film four out of five stars and added, \\"Lewis Gilbert manages to retain the best of Willy Russell's theatrical devices . . . while opening out the action to embrace a big-screen atmosphere. The supporting cast, particularly Bernard Hill as Collins's Neanderthal husband, is equally convincing, with only the hammy Conti (glistening teeth and appalling accent) striking a momentary false note.\\"Radio Times review Among reviewers who found the film banal and hollow, Caryn James of The New York Times observed, \\"By adding all the characters and settings that Shirley only talks about on stage, the film reveals the weakness of Mr. Russell's script as surely as if a magician's clumsy assistant had pointed a finger at a secret trapdoor. Ms. Collins brings as much energy and warmth to the role as ever, but on screen the strength of her performance is shattered by being chopped into tiny, disconnected bits.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times likewise rated the film one star, calling it \\"a realistic drama of appalling banality.\\" He added, \\"There were moments during the movie when I cringed at the manipulative dialogue as the heroine recited warmed-over philosophy and inane one-liners when she should have been allowed to speak for herself. . . . Many of the sentiments in this film seem recycled directly from greeting cards . . . If there is a shred of plausibility in the film, it comes from Bernard Hill's performance as Shirley Valentine's husband. He isn't a bad bloke, just a tired and indifferent one, and when he follows his wife to Greece at the end of the film, there are a few moments so truthful that they show up the artifice of the rest.\\"Chicago Sun-Times review =Box office= The film grossed $6.1 million in the United States and Canada.

In 1865 he received his habilitation at the University of Heidelberg, where in 1867 he became an associate professor. From 1871 to 1884, he was a professor of church history at the University of Bern, afterwards moving to Jena, as a successor to Karl von Hase. In 1907 he took his retirement in Oberursel, where he died on August 4, 1918. Nippold's primary interest involved modern church history, and he was associated with a number of current church policy concerns. He was co-founder of the Evangelischer Bund (Protestant Federation), a movement for preservation of German Protestant interests.  Written works  He was a prolific author, his best work being the highly acclaimed, multi-volume \\"Handbuch der neuesten Kirchengeschichte\\" (Textbook of the latest church history).

During World War II, he served on the , the most damaged ship in the history of the U.S. Navy to return to port. He survived a devastating attack on March 19, 1945, but suffered injuries, earning the Purple Heart. Later in life, he worked as the art director for the Sporting News, the \\"Bible of Baseball.\\"  Early life  Franklin Gritts at the age of five years Gritts was born in Vian, Oklahoma, in 1915. His father, George Gritts, a full-blood Cherokee whose name is on the Dawes Roll, was a traditionalist and attended Cherokee religious ceremonies in the Cookson Hills . His mother was Rachel Gritts (n√©e Duck), a full-blood Cherokee who is also listed in the Dawes Roll. George's father, Anderson (A.W.) Gritts, was an officer of the Eastern Emigrant and Western Cherokee Association and supported lobbying efforts in Washington D.C. for the Cherokees regarding land and oil rights early in the 20th century. This association was a divergent of the Original Keetoowah Society, a religious and cultural traditionist group with roots going back to the 1850s. The Eastern Emigrant and Western Cherokee Association held one of its meetings at George Gritts‚Äô farm over several days in August 1920, with people arriving on foot, horseback, in wagons, and a few in cars. They set up a camp in his fields. Gritts‚Äô first memory is of this event as he thought all these people had come for his fifth birthday on August 8. Rachel and George were not eager to send their only child to school in Vian, as they had lost several children through miscarriages and early childhood death. They kept Gritts at home until he was eight years old. School authorities finally insisted that he attend school and his parents reluctantly agreed. Although he could speak little English and was older than the other first-graders, he loved school from the beginning. Thanks to capable and caring teachers, he was able to catch up with his age group after a couple of years. The majority of the students were non-Indian but they quickly made friends with the shy newcomer. Gritts showed an early talent for art and this ability added to his popularity. By the time he reached high school, Gritts was active in sports and had bridged the gap between his home and his school life.  College  Senior class Vian High School (Gritts is fourth from left, back row) When Gritts was a high school senior, officials from the Bureau of Indian Affairs interviewed him and offered to recommend him to Bacone College, at that time a Baptist junior college for qualified Indian students located in nearby Muskogee, Oklahoma. He readily accepted and spent two years at Bacone College, where Indian art was an important part of the curriculum. He advanced so well in his artwork and other studies that the Bureau of Indian Affairs offered him a loan to attend the University of Oklahoma at Norman, Oklahoma. This was a big leap to contemplate, from being part of a small, comfortable college close to home to tackling the huge and overwhelming state university. He did not hesitate, however, because he realized what a great opportunity it was. The country was in the grip of the Great Depression and money was very scarce, almost non-existent in rural Oklahoma. He could never have aspired to enroll at the university without the government loan and the encouragement of the recruiters from the Indian Service. The dean of the School of Fine Arts at the university, Dr. O. B. Jacobson, was a Swedish man who appreciated Indian art and valued his students of Indian descent. Nevertheless, he held them to the high standards of the Fine Arts curriculum and granted them no special concessions. He encouraged them to develop their Indian art as an independent assignment. Thus, Gritts took portrait painting, figure painting, art appreciation and other facets of fine art as well as the required general courses.  Teaching  Upon his graduation, Gritts was offered a teaching position at the Fort Sill Indian School in Anadarko, Oklahoma. After a year there, he transferred to Haskell Institute in Lawrence, Kansas, where he taught Indian art in the high school and two-year post-high school divisions. This was quite an advancement for Gritts, as Haskell was the premier Indian school in the nation, drawing students from many different tribes and from almost every state. He had small classes and was able to give individual attention to his students. In June 1940, he married Geraldine Monroe whom he had met as a student at the University of Oklahoma. Along with teaching, he also painted murals in various buildings on the campus. He was commissioned to do an oil portrait of Peter Graves, a noted Chippewa chief, to be placed in a Navy ship.  World War II  Movie star, Rita Hayworth, visiting Gritts' hospital ward during World War II (Gritts is on the left) This tranquil part of his career did not last long. The United States entered World War II and in 1943 Gritts left sheltered campus life, entered the Navy, and experienced a whole new world. First, he was sent to the great inland training base at Farragut, Idaho, for rigorous basic training and then to Pensacola, Florida, for aerial photography school, a fascinating new field for him, but one that separated him from his Indian art. Never again did he pursue Indian art as a full-time occupation in spite of his recognized talent in this area. After Pensacola, he was assigned to the , an aircraft carrier operating in the Pacific theater of the war. He boarded ship at Oakland, California, and it slowly made its way toward the shore of Japan. En route, he took pictures and developed them in the darkroom. He also did occasional artwork such as lettering, illustrations, sign painting and airbrush work. The USS Franklin served at the Bonin and Mariana Islands; Peleliu; and Leyte. Then on March 19, 1945, fifty miles off the shore of Japan, the ship was preparing for the attack on the Japanese homeland. The deck was covered with fully fueled aircraft and the already bombs loaded on them. Suddenly, a Japanese plane appeared and dropped two bombs. One bomb struck the flight deck centerline, penetrating to the hangar deck, effecting destruction and igniting fires through the second and third decks, and knocking out the Combat Information Center and air plot. The second hit aft, tearing through two decks. 798 sailors and Marines were killed. It was the worst disaster the U.S. Navy had ever sustained. Miraculously, the ship did not sink, although it was heavily damaged and thought to be destroyed. Because of its service in the previous \\"hot spots\\" and this attack, the crew of the USS Franklin became the most decorated crew in the history of the US Navy. Gritts was in a passageway near the deck when the ship was hit and was wounded in the left leg and foot by shrapnel. He managed to climb out of a porthole into the sea below and was picked up by a life raft of other survivors. They spent a cold night on the raft, drifting away from the stricken ship and, as the sun set, saw it disappear on the horizon, listing badly. Shortly after daylight, they were rescued by a destroyer and Gritts received some basic first aid. He also began his long \\"hitch-hike\\" across the Pacific, being transferred to any ship heading home to the United States. Unfortunately, some of these ships were ordered back into the fighting zone and he had to be re- routed when a ship going out of the area appeared. His transfers from ship to ship on the turbulent seas were accomplished by heavy cable anchored on each ship. His stretcher was attached to the cables and he was pulled over the water. Finally arriving in Hawaii, Gritts was able to call home just as the news of the Franklin disaster was announced, after a long period of censorship. In Hawaii, he received his first extensive medical treatment, which revealed that an infection had set in the tibia bone of his left leg, and he had lost a toe on that foot. After a couple of weeks, he set sail again, this time on a hospital ship headed for Oakland, where he was transferred to a hospital train for Farragut, Idaho, the training camp which had been turned into a hospital. He was a patient in this hospital for more than a year, during which time the war ended. Gritts faced more medical treatment at the Great Lakes Hospital in Chicago as the infection in the tibia continued to drain and would not heal. To pass the time during his hospital stay, he developed a style of modern illustration and cartoons for the amusement of his fellow patients. Some of his work was published in service publications. Upon his recovery and release from Great Lakes, he returned to Haskell in 1947. He was released from service on September 19, 1947, after it was deemed he had recovered enough from his wounds. The nation was still in the process of rebuilding after WWII, when home construction and civilian manufacturing had been converted to the production of war materials of all kinds. The waves of returning veterans were being retrained for civilian life, many of them attending college under the G.I. Bill.  Return to teaching  At Haskell, the atmosphere was charged with the excitement of the times. The traditional Academic Department remained much the same, but the Business and Vocational Departments were responding to the demands of the modern world. The Indian students flocking in from around the nation needed to \\"Learn to Earn.\\" Gritts could see the need for commercial art training for talented students and transformed his classes accordingly. He did, however, continue to help and encourage serious students of Indian art to pursue this interest. He also continued his own passion for photography. With no blueprint to follow, he developed a commercial art curriculum. He spent one summer at the Art Institute of Chicago and took after-school classes at the University of Kansas to attain state teaching certification. Haskell was upgrading its status to become a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. One of Gritts‚Äô students after the war was Adam Fortunate Eagle Nordwall. He said it was a turning point when Gritts returned after the war and began teaching commercial art. Adam Fortunate Eagle was able to find employment as a commercial artist with the skills he learned at Haskel. Years later in 1968, Adam Fortunate Eagle was named by the FBI as the principal organizer of the Indian occupation of Alcatraz after it ceased being used as a prison by the federal government.  Sporting News  After five years at Haskell, Gritts decided to try his own hand at commercial art. Housing was tight on campus, where employees were required to live, and he felt the possibilities inadequate for his growing family which would eventually include a daughter, Dara Stillman, and two sons, Bob Gritts and Galen Gritts. He resigned his position and moved his family to St. Louis, Missouri. He answered a newspaper advertisement for the position of art director of The Sporting News in 1955. Established in 1886, The Sporting News was a newspaper distributed nationwide and was the outstanding baseball weekly of enthusiastic fans. Full of baseball news, stories, and statistics, it became known as the \\"Baseball Bible.\\" It was still going strong in 1955 and had added a monthly magazine, The Sporting Goods Dealer, a glossy, full-color trade magazine for sporting goods stores carrying many lucrative ads. Gritts‚Äô work on the paper involved pasting up articles, photographs and ads for each page, and original artwork on the front page. The weekly deadlines were crucial, but he always managed to get the paper out on time. He also prepared The Sporting Goods Dealer for publication each month. He died in November 1996 and is buried at Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery.  Legacy  Among others, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt bought one of Gritts‚Äô paintings. Gritts‚Äô art is displayed at the Gilcrease Museum and the Philbrook Museum of Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It is also in the collection of at the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art, University of Oklahoma, National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum, Oklahoma City, and the Muskogee Public Library, Muskogee, Oklahoma. Gritts painted a large mural on four walls gracing the entrance to the auditorium at Haskell Indian Nations University. His oil painting of the great Sequoyah, who invented the Cherokee syllabary, is located there as well. The appreciation of Native American art which Gritts help to establish continues at Haskell to this day. Currently, Haskell Indian Art Market, a festival of two days, draws 30,000 people. He illustrated the back cover of Grant Foreman's The Five Civilized Tribes: a Brief History and a Century of Progress, published in 1948. Some of Gritts‚Äô work resides in private collections. The Cherokee, A New True Book, by Emilie U. Lepthien, published in 1985, calls Gritts a famous Cherokee. His 1950, \\"Stomp Dance\\" was included in C. Szwedzicki's \\"The North American Indian Works\\" which is a collection of 364 images and six texts. Between 1929 and 1952 C. Szwedzicki, a publisher in Nice, France, produced six portfolios of North American Indian art. The publications were edited by American scholars Oscar Brousse Jacobson, Hartley Burr Alexander and Kenneth Milton Chapman. Many of the images were published as pochoir prints which are similar in appearance to silk screen prints. These works represent original works by 20th Century American Indian artists. In 2009, Gritts' Indian Woman Grinding Corn (1936, Tempera, Coutesy of Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art, the University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma: Museum purchase, 1937) was on display in Cotonou, Benin in West Africa as part of the program Art in Embassies. For five decades, Art in Embassies (AIE) has played a leading role in U.S. public diplomacy through a focused mission of vital cross-cultural dialogue and understanding through the visual arts and dynamic artist exchange.

(Their son Pierre Billon had some success as a singer in the 1970s and wrote J'ai oubli√© de vivre for Johnny Hallyday.) She began to sing in the bistro, and journalists began to call her Patachou after the name of her cabaret (p√¢te-√†-choux means cream puff dough). Georges Brassens sang there, and together they sang the duet \\"Maman, papa\\". She was the first to interpret other songs he composed such as \\"Le bricoleur\\", \\"La chasse aux papillons\\", etc. The evening she sang them for the first time, she suggested her audience stay to the end of the show and meet the writer of these songs, and Brassens went up on to the Patachou stage for the first time and sang Le Gorille and P..de toi. Sometimes she would collect half-ties (she would snip the neckties of customers reluctant to join in the singing and immediately staple them to the ceiling, a habit which has created a very original decor of the place - hundreds of neckties hanging above) ‚Äì Thomas Dewey and Errol Flynn were among her victims.Sleeve notes from the Philips release 'Les Grandes Chansons/Patachou =First recordings= Her first records were released in 1952.

All passes are right hand tramline. There is always one feeder, but the feeder changes throughout. When feeding, jugglers begin passing to feedee B and making 5 passes in a windshield wiper fashion. After the first pass, feedee B and C begin to switch places in a clockwise motion. After the places have been exchanged and the feeder has given their 4th pass, B takes one additional step forward and turns counter clockwise (see: \\"turn left\\"), such that D will be the new feeder. Once A finishes their 5th pass, D immediately begins their feed cycle starting on their left. A has no break between A's 5th pass and D's first pass.

For statistical purposes, it is considered part of the Chillum census-designated place (CDP). Lewisdale is a neighborhood contained between the Northwest Branch Anacostia River to the east, East West Highway to the south, University Boulevard to the north, and Riggs Road to the west. Neighborhood Character The Lewisdale neighborhood generally consists of medium, one to two story red-brick houses. In addition to this, the Lewisdale neighborhood consists of two main apartment complexes; the Newbury Square Apartment Complex and University City Apartment Complex. Education 1. Lewisdale Elementary School (Grades Pre-K through 6) Parks and Recreation # Riggs Manor Neighborhood Park This park is located on the far south side of Lewisdale, at the corner of where West Park Drive and Sheridan Street end. In addition to these streets, The Riggs Manor Neighborhood park is also surrounded by the Northwest Branch Anacostia River to the east and East West Highway to the south. The Northwest Branch Trail, also notably, passes by this park. The Riggs Manor Park is a small, quiet park that consists of nothing more than a basketball court and bench. # Lewisdale Neighborhood Park This park is located slightly north of the Riggs Manor Neighborhood Park on West Park Drive. West Park Drive gets split apart by a small area of woods after going through this park. West Park Drive; however, does continue to University Boulevard after the woods ends at Banning Place. Similarly to the Riggs Manor Park, the Lewisdale Neighborhood Park is surrounded by the Northwest Branch Anacostia River to the east. The Northwest Branch Trail also passes by this park. The Lewisdale Neighborhood Park is also a quiet park, like the Riggs Manor Neighborhood Park, except the only difference, is that the park has a little more features. The Lewisdale Neighborhood Park features a small playground area and kickball field in addition to the basketball court it offers. # Lane Manor Community Park/ Recreation Center This park is located on the far north side of Lewisdale, at the intersection of University Boulevard and West Park Drive. Similarly to the Riggs Manor Neighborhood Park and Lewisdale Neighborhood Parks, the Lane Manor Community Park is surrounded by the Northwest Branch Anacostia River. Unlike the other two parks; however, this park is much more busy and full of a lot more action/ park facilities. The Lane Manor Community Park consists of a huge soccer field, a medium-sized playground area, a basketball court, tennis court, a small kickball field, a picnic/ pavilion area, an indoor recreational center facility with a bathroom, and a swimming pool with a small slide. Ice Cream Vending Trucks tend to frequently stop by this park in the spring and summer, since many children and adults buy ice cream at this park when the weather is hot. Additionally, the Lane Manor Community Park is a hot spot for soccer games. Many people play soccer games at this park for leisure, while others join soccer leagues that play competitive soccer games at this park.

Value Village has been operating in Toys R' Us' former location since late 1996. (The Lewisdale Toys R' Us moved to a bigger location in the Langley Park Plaza Shopping Center, where it operated until January 31, 2007.) Further west on University Boulevard, the Lewisdale neighborhood features University Gas station, University Mart convenience store, Bestway supermarket, Maxim Nasia Beauty Supply, Hair Cuttery, Coco Cabana Bar & Grill restaurant, Dunkin' Donuts, Baskin-Robbins, Don Pollo restaurant, and Arby's (formerly KFC). The Don Pollo restaurant was built on the former Checkers restaurant location following its closure in mid-2007. In addition to these stores, the Lewisdale neighborhood features the \\"Riggs Building,\\" an office building that contains a few retail businesses. There used to be a bowling alley in this building. Lewisdale also contains the Green Meadows Shopping Center, which is located near the intersection of East West Highway and Riggs Road. It consists of the Riggs seafood store, Jerk Hill Cafe, Western Union, Crown liquor store, Cricket Wireless store, Dulce Vida bakery, China Sub shop, Mi Pais Latin American market, Spring laundromat and dry cleaners, Los Laurales Mexican/Salvadoran restaurant, and Chicken Loco Peruvian restaurant (which opened in June 2009, replacing the former Mi Jamaica grocery store, which closed around the beginning of 2009).

The result establishes a deep and fundamental connection between the theory of graph minors and topological embeddings. The theorem is stated in the seventeenth of a series of 23 papers by Neil Robertson and Paul Seymour. Its proof is very long and involved. and are surveys accessible to nonspecialists, describing the theorem and its consequences.  Setup and motivation for the theorem  A minor of a graph G is any graph H that is isomorphic to a graph that can be obtained from a subgraph of G by contracting some edges. If G does not have a graph H as a minor, then we say that G is H-free. Let H be a fixed graph. Intuitively, if G is a huge H-free graph, then there ought to be a \\"good reason\\" for this. The graph structure theorem provides such a \\"good reason\\" in the form of a rough description of the structure of G. In essence, every H-free graph G suffers from one of two structural deficiencies: either G is \\"too thin\\" to have H as a minor, or G can be (almost) topologically embedded on a surface that is too simple to embed H upon. The first reason applies if H is a planar graph, and both reasons apply if H is not planar. We first make precise these notions. = Tree width = The tree width of a graph G is a positive integer that specifies the \\"thinness\\" of G. For example, a connected graph G has tree width one if and only if it is a tree, and G has tree width two if and only if it is a series- parallel graph. Intuitively, a huge graph G has small tree width if and only if G takes the structure of a huge tree whose nodes and edges have been replaced by small graphs. We give a precise definition of tree width in the subsection regarding clique-sums. It is a theorem that if H is a minor of G, then the tree width of H is not greater than that of G. Therefore, one \\"good reason\\" for G to be H-free is that the tree width of G is not very large. The graph structure theorem implies that this reason always applies in case H is planar. Corollary 1. For every planar graph H, there exists a positive integer k such that every H-free graph has tree width less than k. It is unfortunate that the value of k in Corollary 1 is generally much larger than the tree width of H (a notable exception is when H = K4, the complete graph on four vertices, for which k=3). This is one reason that the graph structure theorem is said to describe the \\"rough structure\\" of H-free graphs. = Surface embeddings = Roughly, a surface is a set of points with a local topological structure of a disc. Surfaces fall into two infinite families: the orientable surfaces include the sphere, the torus, the double torus and so on; the nonorientable surfaces include the real projective plane, the Klein bottle and so on. A graph embeds on a surface if the graph can be drawn on the surface as a set of points (vertices) and arcs (edges) that do not cross or touch each other, except where edges and vertices are incident or adjacent. A graph is planar if it embeds on the sphere. If a graph G embeds on a particular surface then every minor of G also embeds on that same surface. Therefore, a \\"good reason\\" for G to be H-free is that G embeds on a surface that H does not embed on. When H is not planar, the graph structure theorem may be looked at as a vast generalization of the Kuratowski theorem. A version of this theorem proved by states that if a graph G is both K5-free and K3,3-free, then G is planar. This theorem provides a \\"good reason\\" for a graph G not to have K5 or K3,3 as minors; specifically, G embeds on the sphere, whereas neither K5 nor K3,3 embed on the sphere. Unfortunately, this notion of \\"good reason\\" is not sophisticated enough for the graph structure theorem. Two more notions are required: clique-sums and vortices. = Clique-sums = A clique in a graph G is any set of vertices that are pairwise adjacent in G. For a non-negative integer k, a k-clique-sum of two graphs G and K is any graph obtained by selecting a non-negative integer m ‚â§ k, selecting clique of size m in each of G and K, identifying the two cliques into a single clique of size m, then deleting zero or more of the edges that join vertices in the new clique. If G1, G2, ..., Gn is a list of graphs, then we may produce a new graph by joining the list of graphs via k-clique-sums. That is, we take a k-clique-sum of G1 and G2, then take a k-clique-sum of G3 with the resulting graph, and so on. A graph has tree width at most k if it can be obtained via k-clique-sums from a list of graphs, where each graph in the list has at most k + 1 vertices. Corollary 1 indicates to us that k-clique-sums of small graphs describe the rough structure H-free graphs when H is planar. When H is nonplanar, we also need to consider k-clique-sums of a list of graphs, each of which is embedded on a surface. The following example with H = K5 illustrates this point. The graph K5 embeds on every surface except for the sphere. However there exist K5-free graphs that are far from planar. In particular, the 3-clique-sum of any list of planar graphs results in a K5-free graph. determined the precise structure of K5-free graphs, as part of a cluster of results known as Wagner's theorem: Theorem 2. If G is K5-free, then G can be obtained via 3-clique-sums from a list of planar graphs, and copies of one special non-planar graph having 8-vertices. We point out that Theorem 2 is an exact structure theorem since the precise structure of K5-free graphs is determined. Such results are rare within graph theory. The graph structure theorem is not precise in this sense because, for most graphs H, the structural description of H-free graphs includes some graphs that are not H-free. = Vortices (rough description) = One might be tempted to conjecture that an analog of Theorem 2 holds for graphs H other than K5. Perhaps it is true that: for any non-planar graph H, there exists a positive integer k such that every H-free graph can be obtained via k-clique-sums from a list of graphs, each of which either has at most k vertices or embeds on some surface that H does not embed on. Unfortunately, this statement is not yet sophisticated enough to be true. We must allow each embedded graph Gi to \\"cheat\\" in two limited ways. First, we must allow a bounded number of locations on the surface at which we may add some new vertices and edges that are permitted to cross each other in a manner of limited complexity. Such locations are called vortices. The \\"complexity\\" of a vortex is limited by a parameter called its depth, closely related to pathwidth. The reader may prefer to defer reading the following precise description of a vortex of depth k. Second, we must allow a limited number of new vertices to add to each of the embedded graphs with vortices. = Vortices (precise definition) = A face of an embedded graph is an open 2-cell in the surface that is disjoint from the graph, but whose boundary is the union of some of the edges of the embedded graph. Let F be a face of an embedded graph G and let v0, v1, ..., vn‚àí1,vn = v0 be the vertices lying on the boundary of F (in that circular order). A circular interval for F is a set of vertices of the form {va, va+1, ..., va+s} where a and s are integers and where subscripts are reduced modulo n. Let Œõ be a finite list of circular intervals for F. We construct a new graph as follows. For each circular interval L in Œõ we add a new vertex vL that joins to zero or more of the vertices in L. Finally, for each pair {L, M} of intervals in Œõ, we may add an edge joining vL to vM provided that L and M have nonempty intersection. The resulting graph is said to be obtained from G by adding a vortex of depth at most k (to the face F) provided that no vertex on the boundary of F appears in more than k of the intervals in Œõ.  Statement of the graph structure theorem  Graph structure theorem. For any graph H, there exists a positive integer k such that every H-free graph can be obtained as follows: # We start with a list of graphs, where each graph in the list is embedded on a surface on which H does not embed # to each embedded graph in the list, we add at most k vortices, where each vortex has depth at most k # to each resulting graph we add at most k new vertices (called apexes) and add any number of edges, each having at least one of its endpoints among the apexes. # finally, we join via k-clique-sums the resulting list of graphs. Note that steps 1. and 2. result in an empty graph if H is planar, but the bounded number of vertices added in step 3. makes the statement consistent with Corollary 1. Refinements Strengthened versions of the graph structure theorem are possible depending on the set H of forbidden minors. For instance, when one of the graphs in H is planar, then every H-minor-free graph has a tree decomposition of bounded width; equivalently, it can be represented as a clique-sum of graphs of constant sizeGraph Minors V. When one of the graphs in H can be drawn in the plane with only a single crossing, then the H-minor-free graphs admit a decomposition as a clique-sum of graphs of constant size and graphs of bounded genus, without vortices.; ). A different strengthening is also known when one of the graphs in H is an apex graph..

Rock Formation by Jennifer Steinkamp, Denver Art Museum, Colorado. Life and career Born in Denver, Colorado in 1958, Steinkamp is the eldest of five children, three girls and two boys. Her family lived in a number of areas before settling in Edina, Minnesota. In 1979, Steinkamp moved to Los Angeles to attend Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, studying with Mike Kelley, Gene Youngblood, and Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe. She then transferred to the California Institute of the Arts, where she studied experimental animation. Steinkamp returned to Art Center to earn her BFA in 1989 and her MFA in 1991. In 2011, Art Center recognized Steinkamp with an Honorary Doctorate. She is currently a professor in the department of Design Media Arts at UCLA. Steinkamp uses digital projection to transform architectural space, providing the viewer with a synaesthetic experience, often working in collaboration with musicians Jimmy Johnson and Andrew Bucksbarg to integrate sound into her work. While her career began with brightly colored abstract projections, since 2003 she has increasingly incorporated nature-based imagery into her work ‚Äî gnarled trees that twist, turn, and change seasons; rooms filled with undulating strands of flowers. In doing so she has brought digital art into the mainstream of contemporary art. Her use of vernacular imagery and embrace of beauty result in environments that reference the sublime, as did the Hudson River School painters. Like her art historical precedents, Steinkamp conveys the magnitude and power of nature‚Äîa nature that is not always benign. Premature, a series first displayed in 2010, shifts the focus of Steinkamp's subject to life and death. She explores this topic with projections of slithering veins and arteries that evoke the eerie inspiration of her work.Lehmann Maupin Press Release. (2010.) Her work has the power to communicate to a broader public, to ‚Äúconvert‚Äù a more traditional art audience, familiar with the use of computer graphics for video games but unaware of other creative applications. Steinkamp has exhibited her work internationally in a variety of venues and contexts, but her work is still difficult to categorize. She is often described as a video artist although her work is not photo or video-based; her recent inclusion in the California Video exhibition at the Getty Museum suggests that her connection to the genre is unlikely to change. The media art world has a two-sided relation with Steinkamp, since her work is not technically interactive and she uses the computer not as a tool to comment on technology, but rather one to create imagery. In 2008, Steinkamp was selected as the United States representative in the 11th International Cairo Biennale. In 2009, she was commissioned to make Hollywood and Vine, a permanent outdoor installation in Hollywood, California. The Valentino 2010 Spring/Summer couture show featured projections of Steinkamp's trees against the walls of the runway.Gordon, Amanda. (April 2010.) 'Branching into Couture',ARTnews.

It was the first Carthusian monastery in Franconia and in today's Bavaria. Geography The charterhouse is located in the valley of the , a tributary of the Haslochbach. It is surrounded by the wooded hills of the Spessart. It lies in the municipal territory of Schollbrunn, part of the Main-Spessart district of Bavaria.  History  Ruined buildings of the former Carthusian monastery In 1216, a chapel was consecrated in the Kropfbachtal, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint Lawrence and Saint Nicholas. In the early 14th century, this chapel became the destination of pilgrims. At the chapel's location, Elisabeth von Hohenlohe, daughter of the Count of Wertheim, donated a Kartause or charterhouse in 1328. In 1333, Carthusians from Mainz, led by the first prior Heinrich Spiegel, settled here, making this the order's first monastery in Franconia and in what is modern-day Bavaria. The initial Kartause was replaced in the early 15th century by a larger building, housing up to 24 monks. In 1446, a new church for the monastery was consecrated. The Counts of Wertheim were the V√∂gte of the monastery and its church served as their burial place. It is possible that monks from Gr√ºnau settled in the 14th century at the charterhouses at Erfurt and Koblenz. A Canonical visitation in 1523 discovered a state of affairs that led to the temporary dismissal of prior Michael Lemlein. During the German Peasants' War, the monastery was sacked by peasants in 1525. That year, Count Georg von Wertheim joined the Reformation, and thus the monastery's Vogt now was a Lutheran. In 1545, the Wertheim family took over administration of the monastery's lands. The last three monks left Gr√ºnau in 1557. However, the order fought a prolonged legal battle against the counts at the Reichskammergericht and the Hofkammergericht for restitution of the Kartause. An Imperial edict of 1629 restored property to Catholic owners and Gr√ºnau returned to the order. Only two years later, they had to flee from Swedish troops during the chaos of the Thirty Years' War. In 1635, Count Johann Dietrich von L√∂wenstein-Wertheim restored the buildings and half the original land. Four monks settled there. The monastery was dissolved in 1803 in the secularisation of Bavaria and the property fell to the Counts of . The monastery, which had been rebuilt in the early 18th century by the monks, was turned into a Hofgut, an estate owned by the Counts, in 1820. Today All that remains of the monastic structures is the prior's lodging, now used for guests, the ruins of the church and the perimeter wall with its archway.

Its operations are now a part of Hitachi Vantara. It was a wholly owned subsidiary of Hitachi Ltd. and part of the Hitachi Information Systems & Telecommunications Division. In 2017 its operations were merged with Pentaho and Hitachi Insight Group to form Hitachi Vantara. In 2010 Hitachi Data Systems sold through direct and indirect channels in more than 170 countries and regions. Its customers included over half of the Fortune 100 companies at the time. History Hitachi Data Systems (HDS) was founded in 1989 when Hitachi and Electronic Data Systems (EDS) acquired National Advanced Systems (NAS) from National Semiconductor and renamed it Hitachi Data Systems. But prior to that, the origins of the company had a history that stretched back to Itel, an early player in the mainframe market. Itel's Computer Products Group sold National Semiconductors' IBM- compatible mainframes, and in 1979 National Semiconductor took it over and formed National Advanced Systems (NAS). NAS shifted from manufacturing mainframes and began marketing systems from Hitachi. In 1999, Hitachi bought out EDS's share, and HDS became a wholly owned subsidiary of Hitachi. For many years, HDS sold both Hitachi IBM-compatible mainframes and storage systems, but in 2000, it exited the mainframe business and shifted its focus to enterprise storage. =Origins as Itel= Itel was an equipment leasing company founded in 1967 by Peter Redfield and Gary Friedman, initially focusing on leasing IBM mainframes. Through creative financial arrangements and investments, Itel was able to lease IBM mainframes to customers at costs below what customers would have paid IBM, making them second to IBM itself in revenues. A joint venture between National Semiconductor and Hitachi formed in 1977 was contracted by Itel to manufacture IBM-compatible mainframes branded as Advanced Systems. In the face of initial success of having shipped 200 such systems and netting profits of $73 million, Itel had increased their investments and personnel to market their Advanced Systems brand and hence committed themselves to long-term contracts with National Semiconductor and Hitachi. While Itel had not expected quick change in semiconductor technologies, Charlie Sporck, CEO of National Semiconductor, saw opportunities by tempting Itel to longer-term commitments in response to request by Itel for lower prices in order to compete with IBM. Itel agreed. =National Semiconductor takes over Advanced Systems = Thereafter, news was abound that IBM was releasing a new technologically superior line of computers, to which customers responded by holding back purchases causing Itel's inventory to build up drastically. Even though Hitachi had agreed to Itel's request to cut back on shipment, National Semiconductor was adamant in implementing what the industry had termed as National's blackmailing of Itel. In 1979, Redfield was forced to resign as CEO, and National Semiconductor took over Itel Advanced Systems, including its sales and marketing team. National renamed the division to National Advanced Systems (NAS), assembling and selling IBM-compatibles where the CPU was imported from Hitachi. National and Hitachi quite often depended on IBM's gradual and restrained roll-out of newer models to feed on IBM's technology and market share and hence NAS enjoyed occasional successes. However, IBM had invested and obtained significant success in semiconductor technologies which enabled them to build more powerful computers at lower costs. Meanwhile, the mainframe market itself was in decline as mini- and microcomputers, and the UNIX operating system gained popularity. Mainframe makers such as Sperry, Honeywell, Burroughs, NCR and Control Data were gradually being forced out of the mainframe market. NAS, as well as Amdahl (the other IBM-compatible mainframe maker), was no exception to facing the technological and sales pressure from IBM. In fact, National Semiconductor and its subsidiary NAS were sued in 1983 by IBM for $2.5 billion on charges of using computer technology secrets stolen from IBM, as result of an investigation by the United States Government into National's collaboration with Hitachi in engaging in industrial espionage to obtain technology secrets from IBM. Hitachi settled with IBM and licensed the mainframe operating system software from IBM. In 1983, NAS ceased the manufacture of its own line of mainframes (which had Hitachi processors) and became a reseller of Hitachi's mainframe and data storage products. = Joint venture of Hitachi and EDS= On February 28, 1989, National Semiconductor and Hitachi announced their agreement that Hitachi and Electronic Data Systems (EDS) would jointly acquire NAS for $398 million in cash, of which Hitachi would own 80%. Memorex Telex and National had earlier, on January 10, 1989, announced plans on a joint venture \\"under which each company would own half of the unit and National would get $250 million plus four million shares of Memorex Telex\\". However, National proceeded to negotiate with Hitachi after Memorex's offer expired as National had felt that the Hitachi-EDS offer was a better deal as it entailed no further financial obligation or commitment on the part of National after the sale besides reaping a pre-tax profit of $200 million from the sale. By that time, Memorex Telex was able to arrange financing for the deal, but National had already accepted the Hitachi-EDS deal. The acquisition was envisaged to provide Hitachi a better presence in the United States to compete with IBM. The entity was renamed Hitachi Data Systems (HDS). = EDS stake= On January 29, 1999, Hitachi announced it would take over EDS' stake in HDS, appointing Jun Naruse as CEO of its new subsidiary. Naruse had been an engineer with the RAID Systems Division involved in storage systems development. Having total control of the company, Hitachi was able to infuse Hitachi Data Systems with its corporate culture, ethics and practices. = Storage = On April 6, 2000, Hitachi Data Systems announced a re-organization to focus on storage systems rather than mainframes. Shortly thereafter (June 26, 2000), the first HDS storage product was unveiled, the Freedom Storage Lightning 9900, featuring the Hi-Star crossbar switched architecture to interconnect memory, disks, servers and other external devices instead of the traditional bus architecture. In addition to HDS sales, HP OEM‚Äôd and Sun resold the Lightning 9900 and succeeding generations, which featured additional advanced capabilities such as virtualization of external Hitachi and third-party storage systems to form storage pools. In January 2001, HDS announced the Thunder 9200, a mid-range modular storage system aimed at the small and medium business market, sold mainly through resellers. Hitachi Data Systems high-end and mid-range modular storage systems were complemented by software for storage management, content management, business continuity, replication, data protection, and IT operations. In 2002, Hitachi acquired Comstock Systems Corp, and analysts estimated 35% market share. =Cloud= On February 6, 2007, Hitachi Data Systems acquired Archivas, provider digital archiving and content management products. On August 20, 2010, Hitachi Data Systems acquired the intellectual property and core engineering team of ParaScale, developer of storage software which uses a clustered file system on multiple Linux servers to present a single file-storage appliance. On September 7, 2011, Hitachi Data Systems acquired BlueArc which developed a clustered network attached storage product. It was estimated HDS had been responsible for about half of BlueArc's sales in 2010. HDS moved to marketing using the term cloud computing, culminating with an announcement on October 25, 2011. In August 2014, in partnership with Avnet, HDS announced cloud partners. =Acquisitions= *On February 13, 2012, Hitachi Data Systems acquired Shoden Data Systems, a provider of data center technology in South Africa and across the sub-Saharan African continent. *On September 26, 2012, Hitachi Data Systems acquired Cofio Software a provider of unified data protection and orchestration workflow software in San Diego, CA, with engineering in Broadstone, England. *On August 10, 2014, Hitachi Data Systems acquired Sepaton, a provider of computer appliances using data deduplication. *On May 31, 2015, Hitachi Data Systems acquired oXya, a provider of services for SAP HANA from SAP SE. *On June 4, 2015, Hitachi Data Systems completed the acquisition of Pentaho, marketing big data and data analytics. Pentaho is part of a company wide movement of HDS towards responsible Social Innovation utilizing emerging technologies, including the Internet of things. *On September 17, 2019, it was announced that Hitachi will integrate Hitachi Vantara and Hitachi Consulting to accelerate global expansion of Hitachi's Social Innovation Business and Digital Growth. In January 2020, the integrated companies began operating under the brand Hitachi Vantara and were led by Toshiaki Tokunaga. [11] Though not technically an acquisition, Hitachi Vantara absorbed Hitachi Consulting.

She is a young African- American woman who first appeared in Young X-Men #8 (Nov. 2008) and was created by Marc Guggenheim and Rafa Sandoval. Publication history Cipher's first appearance was in Young X-Men #8 by writer Marc Guggenheim and artist Rafa Sandoval. However, references to her character began in Young X-Men #3 and were initially written to deceptively reference long-deceased New Mutants character Cypher. Through retcons, Cipher is depicted as having been present during events prior to her character's creation, including Grant Morrison's 2001 run on New X-Men and Joss Whedon's 2004 tenure on Astonishing X-Men. She became a featured character in the series Young X-Men, and after that series ended, she appeared in Uncanny X-Men and Wolverine and the X-Men as part of the student cast. Fictional character biography A new character in the ongoing series Young X-Men, Graymalkin, mentions a \\"Cypher\\" twice. The first is when he is alone in the air ducts inside of the Danger Cave. He mentions that he is \\"not the only one that can help them. There is Cypher\\".Young X-Men #3 The second time is when he tells Donald Pierce, who was disguised as Cyclops, that \\"Cypher told [him] everything\\".Young X-Men #4 The new \\"Cypher,\\" an African-American girl named Alisa Tager, reveals herself at the end of Young X-Men #8, however her codename is spelled \\"Cipher\\" rather than \\"Cypher\\" (as it is spelled in earlier mentions).Young X-Men #8 She had come to warn Ink that his teammates were in trouble and he is needed to come with her to save them. Although Ink is very skeptical about this young girl's motivations or intentions, she is shown wearing the standard uniform of the Young X-Men, and has a jet from the X-Men's headquarters to transport him to his team as well, to show that her information is legitimate, even though she refuses to give any more information, about herself or the team, other than that. However, she also gives into his demand to take him to his tattooist to give him some new abilities, even though she voices that she feels he is wasting his time while his friends are \\"dead or dying.\\" She is still able to get him to the battle with the Y-Men in time, though, where Ink is able to turn the tide and save his teammates.Young X-Men #9 Revealing herself in order to save the Young X-Men causes several members of the team and X-Men faculty to question who she is and why they had never been aware of her. Cyclops reveals that Cipher was first discovered during events depicted in New X-Men vol. 2. During a riot in Mutant Town, Jean Grey was able to detect Alisa's presence. Jean and Cyclops chose to keep Alisa's presence a secret per her request, giving her the codename \\"Cipher,\\" an act made easier by Alisa's mutant ability to become completely undetectable either psychically or physically. In the meantime, Cipher developed a friendship with Blindfold, secretly communicating with her during past events in Astonishing X-Men vol. 3, explaining Ruth's behavior of seemingly talking to herself. Cipher was also present to greet Graymalkin when he awoke during the events of X-Men: Messiah Complex and present for various other events in Young X-Men, always secretly assisting the team. Her newly revealed presence generated feelings of uneasiness and anger over their seeming lack of privacy and Cipher's ability to go about undetected in their lives.Young X-Men #10 In a conversation with Alisa, Cyclops theorizes that she had chosen to reveal herself out of a subconscious desire to make herself known to those around her. Regardless, Alisa remains uneasy of her \\"outing\\" as she fears an individual only referred to as \\"he\\" will now know where to find her and will come for her. Cyclops assures her that \\"he\\" will have to get through the X-Men to reach her, reassuring Alisa enough for her to decide to drop her stealth mode. She is next seen helping containing the riots in San Francisco alongside Colossus.Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Utopia #1 Following the split between Wolverine and Cyclops in Schism, Cipher decides to return to Westchester with Wolverine and become a student at the newly renamed \\"Jean Grey School for Higher Learning\\".Wolverine and the X-men #1 Powers and abilities Cipher's abilities include full spectrum invisibility and complete stealth, able to mask even her psychic imprint from most telepaths with the exception of particularly high-level telepaths like Jean Grey. She is also able to enter a phased state making her capable of passing through solid objects and levitating through the air. She also exhibits the ability to mask her voice to only those she chooses. Coupled with her invisibility, this makes her a highly adept spy, and she was employed as such by Cyclops. She is also able to pilot the X-Men's jets.

It is on Mount Tronador, a mountain that held a special fascination for Meiling. Otto Meiling (1902-1989) was a German-born mountaineer who achieved many first ascents in Nahuel Huapi National Park and the surrounding area. Meiling left Bavaria for Buenos Aires in his early twenties, working as a labourer, learning the skills of carpentry and construction. He gained a taste for adventure, then moved to San Carlos de Bariloche, at the time a small village, in the Lakes District, near Cerro Catedral. There, he begin exploring the nearby peaks with friends, mainly other German immigrants. He soon founded the Club Andino de Bariloche with them, a highly successful mountaineering club that still exists. After making a number of first ascents in the area, he was introduced to the new sport of skiing, which he became passionate about, making many long ski trips, and beginning to teach skiing, and manufacturing skis and bindings. At one point he returned to his home land, visiting his family, but also receiving further training in skiing, mountaineering, and bringing back a large supply of ski bindings. Over the years, his exploits with the club grew bolder, including ascents of Mount Tronador, Cerro San Lorenzo, Cerro San Valentino, and later, thwarted attempts on Cerro Paine in Chile's Torres del Paine national park. However, Tronador would be his favourite mountain, with more than 15 recorded summit ascents, including a one-day ascent from and return to Pampa Linda at the age of 78.Un Pionero de Bariloche, Otto Meiling: Conquistador de Cumbres y Filosofo del Cerro Otto, Vojko Arko. Other adventures included descending the treacherous Rio Manso, and a phenomenal 96 kilometre walk home from the end of a hike in one night. As an active member of the club, Meiling used his construction skills to build a number of huts or \\"refugios\\" in the mountains, including the \\"Berghof\\" ski school near Cerro Otto (named after a different explorer) where he would live for most of his life. He also built a hut high up on Mount Tronador, nestled between two glaciers, which would later be renamed Refugio Otto Meiling. Mount Tronador, summited by Meiling 15 times. Later life As Meiling grew older, he became something of a hermit, and gained a reputation for his uncompromising frugal ways and distaste for modern mountaineering. He was vehemently opposed to the construction of the Cerro Catedral ski resort, and when the club he founded started to orient its activities there, he became somewhat estranged from it. As a result, his lift- less ski school at Cerro Otto began to lose students, as they were attracted by the less arduous conditions at Catedral. Throughout his life he remained in astonishing physical condition, walking huge distances at high speed. One friend and later biographer remarked that it was only when hiking with Otto in his 80s that he was able to keep up with him for the first time. Meiling died in 1989, finally succumbing to a number of health problems. Sources *Un Pionero de Bariloche, Otto Meiling: Conquistador de Cumbres y Filosofo del Cerro Otto, Vojko Arko.

He was a respected and powerful landowner in the Fier region of Albania. Biography Prince Wied with family and members of the Court, Durr√´s, Albania, 1914. Sami Vrioni second from right. Sami Vrioni was a member of the prominent landowning Vrioni family of Berat, Fier and Myzeqe, formerly cities and regions of the Ottoman Province of Yannina, presently in Albania. His father was Omar Pasha Vrioni II (1839‚Äì1928). Sami Vrioni himself was owner of around 5,000 Hectares in the agricultural region of southern Myzeqe. He was one of the delegates of the Albanian Declaration of Independence in 1912, representing Berat region. According to some sources, Ismail Qemali wanted him as part of his cabinet, but his father Omer Pasha was skeptical regarding the Qemali's government. Having served as parliamentary Deputy for Berat in 1912, under Prince Wied he served as a seneschal (Court Chamberlain). He was part of the Albanian delegation in Vienna of April 1917 representing the districts of Skrapar and Berat. Sami Vrioni had graduated as agronomist and engineer. He spoke Turkish, Arabic, Italian, and French. He was a participant of the Congress of Durr√´s and was elected Minister of Agriculture of the provisional government that came out of it, switching to Minister of Public Works in 1919‚Äì1920. According to Sejfi Vllamasi's (1883‚Äì1975) memories, Vrioni together with Mustafa Kruja, Fejzi Alizoti, and Myfid Libohova joined the camp of the pro-Italian opponents of the Congress of Lushnj√´, with the three others actively trying to persuade or force the delegates not to join the Lushnj√´ event. Served as Assemblyman (1924‚Äì1925, 1928‚Äì1932) and Senator (1925‚Äì1928) of the Albanian parliament. Regardless of the fact that he descended from a landowning feudal cast, Sami Vrioni had credibility between the Nolist opposition of early 20s. In February 1924, the opposition was hoping on bringing him up as Prime Minister, which was disregarded by the most powerful group of Ahmet Zogu, who elected Shefqet V√´rlaci instead of him. Vrioni was arrested by the communist dictatorship that took power in 1944, he died under torture in 1947 or 1952. Sami Vrioni was married to the daughter of Essad Pasha Toptani.

The coaches were Norm Van Brocklin of the Minnesota Vikings for the West and Allie Sherman of the New York Giants for the East. This Pro Bowl is considered one of the best, most- competitive games in history. After a Jim Brown fumble in the fourth quarter, Johnny Unitas drove the West to the East's 12-yard line. On the final play of the game, Unitas found halfback Jon Arnett alone in the end zone for the game- tying touchdown. The West kicked the winning point-after with time expired, making the final score 31-30. Cleveland Browns fullback Jim Brown was voted the game's outstanding back and Henry Jordan of the Green Bay Packers was the selected as the lineman of the game. Detroit Lions linebacker Joe Schmidt had his helmet wired for sound and to measure the shock of tackles in conjunction with a study by Northwestern University to help establish performance standards for headgear.

Military career He joined the Rhodesian Bush War in 1967 and went for military training in Chunya Camp in Tanzania in 1968. In 1977, he was elected as a ZANU-PF Central Committee member and deputy chief of national security and intelligence. He was appointed commander of Three Brigade in Mutare at independence in 1980 before becoming the country‚Äôs Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) commander in July 1994 assuming overall command over the army and the Air Force under a new military structure. He oversaw various peacekeeping missions in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region. In the Second Congo War, he was in charge of the SADC allied task force troops led by Zimbabwe which fought rebels backed by Uganda and Rwanda to topple the now slain DRC leader Laurent Kabila. The deployment of the Zimbabwean troops later led to the allegations of plunder of natural resources, especially diamonds, in which Zvinavashe was implicated. Following his retirement in December 2003, General Constantino Chiwenga succeeded him to the post.

He told other ZANU-PF candidates on April 23 that they needed to \\"accept the reality\\" that the MDC had won, and he stressed that the importance of preserving peace.

Unlike the appointment of High Sheriff, which is for one year, the term of office of a Deputy Lieutenant normally lasts until they reach the age of 75. The Wiltshire Lieutenancy has an establishment of up to 36 Deputy Lieutenants. They are chosen to reflect a wide range of interests and backgrounds, and can be appointed at any age but tend to be aged over 60; they are normally expected to serve for at least five years before they must retire on reaching the age of 75. Deputy Lieutenants can be appointed for a set period of time, but this approach has never been adopted in Wiltshire. New Deputy Lieutenants are nominated by the Lord Lieutenant and follow a formal process to confirm their appointment. The Lord-Lieutenant is not obliged to appoint a new Deputy Lieutenant immediately after a current Deputy Lieutenant retires and thus may hold several vacancies. Retired Deputy Lieutenants can continue to use the post-nominal letters 'DL' after the date of their retirement. 16th century appointments *Sir Henry Knyvet of Charlton (died 1598) *Sir Matthew Arundell of Wardour Castle (1589‚Äì1598)Matthew Arundell Howard at tudorplace.com.ar, accessed 19 November 2012 17th century appointments *Sir Walter Long (c. 1565 ‚Äì 1610) *Thomas Penruddocke (c. 1648 ‚Äì 1695), commissioned 1683Wiltshire and Swindon Archives, accession 549/48 *Sir Gilbert Talbot (c. 1606‚Äì1695), in office 1688‚Äì1689 18th century appointments *John Baskerville, of Turleigh, Bradford-on-Avon (died 1800) 19th century appointments Lord Arthur Somerset DL, 1887 *Walter Long (1793‚Äì1867) *Robert Parry Nisbet (1793‚Äì1882) *William Heald Ludlow Bruges (1796‚Äì1855) *Sir Alexander Malet, 2nd Baronet, KCB (1800‚Äì1886) *George Brudenell-Bruce, 2nd Marquess of Ailesbury (1804‚Äì1878) *Lord Henry Frederick Thynne (1832‚Äì1904) *Sir F.

Launched in 1919 as SS Lake Galva, it served under the names Ripon, Malsah and Commercial Quaker between 1920 and 1938, when it was renamed Indigirka.Entry in Plimsoll Ship Data On its final voyage in 1939 over 700 prisoners perished. Pre-Soviet career The ship was built at the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company in Manitowoc, Wisconsin as one of the Lake series cargo ships. It was launched on 29 December 1919 as Lake Galva and completed in May 1920 as Ripon. It served as an American merchant ship under various owners as SS Ripon (1920‚Äì26), SS Malsah (1926‚Äì28), and SS Commercial Quaker (1928‚Äì38). In 1938 it was sold to the government of the Soviet Union. Prison ship of the Dalstroi With some modifications the ship was placed in service by the Dalstroi as the Indigirka (–ò–Ω–¥–∏–≥–∏ÃÅ—Ä–∫–∞) ‚Äì named after the river in Siberia ‚Äì for the transport of prisoners. With a tonnage of 2,689 and a length 77.3 m it was the smallest ship of the Dalstroi fleet and had a cargo hold of 4,700 m¬≥; Bollinger estimated that it could hold 1,500 captives, while Tzouliades indicates that up to 5,000 prisoners might have been transported. That seems to conflict with evidence that the ship was fully loaded when it departed on its final journey with less than 1,500 crew, passengers and prisoners, forcing Soviet authorities to leave behind many others who were supposed to have made the trip. The Indigirka belonged to a fleet of steamships operated by Dalstroi to transport prisoners from Vladivostok, endpoint of the Transsiberian railway, to Magadan and Kolyma across the Sea of Okhotsk. Travel time was about six days to two weeks to Magadan. A steamer would make about ten trips a year. Conditions were horrendous and many people did not survive. Prisoners were held in the cargo holds where criminals ruled; the guards stayed outside and above and would spray the holds with ice-cold ocean water if things became too unruly. Women prisoners were abused. Final voyage On 8 December 1939 the Indigirka left Magadan to return to Vladivostok under Captain Nikolai Lavrentevich Lapshin. It contained 39 crew, 249 fishermen and their families, 50 prisoners under guard, and 835 prisoners with technical skills who had been released to work for the war effort. On 13 December 1939 at 2:20 am (other reports place the event on 12 December 1939Maritimequest) the ship ran aground in a blizzard off the Japanese coast near Sarufutsu while trying to enter the La Perouse Strait. As the ship turned over, the guards prevented the escape of the prisoners from the holds, and the ship came to rest in shallow water on its side. The Japanese rescued the captain and most of the crew, guards, and fishermen, but it took three days for any rescue of the trapped prisoners to begin. 16 December, when the Japanese rescue team then opened the hull with acetylene torches, only 28 survivors (one of whom later died) were found among more than 700 dead prisoners. Overall 741 people perished. According to Sergey Korolyov's oral statements, he missed the Indigirka convoy and was sent from Kolyma to Vladivostok on the next ship on 23 December. Captain Lapshin was tried and executed for abandoning the ship; chief of NKVD convoy who locked the prisoners in a sinking ship was sentenced to eight years., chapter 32 A cenotaph at Sarufutsu commemorates the tragic end of the Indigirka.Monument to the victims of the Indigirka at Sarufutsu ReferencesSee also *SS Dzhurma Design 1074 ships Lake ships Ships built in Wisconsin 1919 ships Passenger ships of the Soviet Union Maritime incidents in December 1939 1939 in the Soviet Union Ships of the Gulag Prison ships Soviet Union‚ÄìUnited States relations Maritime incidents in the Soviet Union ","title":"SS Indigirka"},{"id":"21318890","text":"Edward Raradza is a Zimbabwean politician and tobacco farmer.

Abayudaya The small Abayudaya tribe converted to Judaism. Their population is estimated at approximately 2,500 having once been as large as 3,000 prior to the persecutions of the Idi Amin regime. Like their neighbors, they are subsistence farmers. Most Abayudaya are of Bagwere origin, except for those from Namutumba who are Basoga. They speak Luganda, Lusoga or Lugwere, although some have learned Hebrew as well.Parfitt, Tudor ( Black Jews in Africa and the Americas, Harvard University Press 2013 British Uganda Programme The British Uganda Programme was a plan to give a portion of British East Africa to the Jewish people as a homeland. The offer was first made by British Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to Theodore Herzl's Zionist group in 1903. He offered of the Mau Plateau in what is today Kenya and Uganda. The offer was a response to pogroms against the Jews in Russia, and it was hoped the area could be a refuge from persecution for the Jewish people.Theodor Herzl's biography at Jewish Virtual Library Modern relations with Israel In 1972 relations with Israel soured. Although Israel had previously supplied Uganda with arms, in 1972 Idi Amin, enraged over Israel's refusal to supply Uganda with jets for a war with neighboring Tanzania, expelled Israeli military advisers and turned to Libya and the Soviet Union for support. Amin became an outspoken critic of Israel.Jamison, M. Idi Amin and Uganda: An Annotated Bibliography, Greenwood Press, 1992, pp.155‚Äì6 In the documentary film General Idi Amin Dada: A Self Portrait, he discussed his plans for war against Israel, using paratroops, bombers and suicide squadrons. Amin later stated that Hitler \\"was right to burn six million Jews\\".End for Amin the executioner The Sun-Herald August 17, 2003 In June 1976, Amin allowed an Air France airliner hijacked by two members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - External Operations (PFLP-EO) and two members of the German Revolution√§re Zellen to land at Entebbe Airport. There, the hijackers were joined by three more. Soon after, 156 non-Jewish hostages who did not hold Israeli passports were released and flown to safety, while 83 Jews and Israeli citizens, as well as 20 others who refused to abandon them (among whom were the captain and crew of the hijacked Air France jet), continued to be held hostage. In the subsequent Israeli rescue operation, codenamed Operation Thunderbolt (popularly known as Operation Entebbe), nearly all the hostages were freed. Three hostages died during the operation and 10 were wounded; seven hijackers, 45 Ugandan soldiers, and one Israeli soldier, Yoni Netanyahu, were killed. A fourth hostage, 75-year-old Dora Bloch, who had been taken to Mulago Hospital in Kampala prior to the rescue operation, was subsequently murdered in reprisal. The incident further soured Uganda's international relations, leading Britain to close its High Commission in Uganda. =Operation Entebbe= Operation Entebbe was a hostage-rescue mission carried out by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) at Entebbe Airport in Uganda on July 4, 1976. A week earlier, on June 27, an Air France plane with 248 passengers was hijacked by Palestinian terrorists and supporters and flown to Entebbe, near Kampala, the capital of Uganda. Shortly after landing, all non-Jewish passengers were released. The operation took place at night, as Israeli transport planes carried 100 elite commandos over to Uganda for the rescue operation. The operation, which took a week of planning, lasted 90 minutes and 103 hostages were rescued. Five Israeli commandos were wounded and one, the commander, Lt Col Yonatan Netanyahu, was killed. All the hijackers, three hostages and 45 Ugandan soldiers were killed, and 11 Soviet-built MiG-17's of Uganda's air force were destroyed. A fourth hostage was murdered Middle Eastern terrorism, Mark Ensalaco p. 101 University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007 by Ugandan army officers at a nearby hospital.\\"Body of Amin Victim Is Flown Back to Israel\\". New York Times. 4 June 1979, Monday, p. A3. Reactions Dora Bloch, a 75-year-old British Jewish immigrant, was taken to Mulago Hospital in Kampala, and was murdered by the Ugandan government, as were some of her doctors and nurses for apparently trying to intervene. In April 1987, Henry Kyemba, Uganda's Attorney General and Minister of Justice at the time, told the Uganda Human Rights Commission that Bloch had been dragged from her hospital bed and murdered by two army officers on Idi Amin's orders. Mrs Bloch had been shot and her body dumped in the trunk of a car which had Ugandan intelligence services number plates. Bloch's remains were recovered near a sugar plantation 20 miles (32 km) east of Kampala in 1979, after the Ugandan‚ÄìTanzanian War led to the end of Amin's rule. The government of Uganda, led by Juma Oris, the Ugandan Foreign Minister at the time, later convened a session of the United Nations Security Council to seek official condemnation of the Israeli raid,Teltsch, Kathleen. \\"Uganda Bids U.N. Condemn Israel for Airport Raid.\\" New York Times. 10 July 1976. (Section: The Week In Review) as a violation of Ugandan sovereignty. The Security Council ultimately declined to pass any resolution on the matter, condemning neither Israel, nor Uganda. In his address to the Council, Israeli ambassador Chaim Herzog said: Israel received support from the Western World for its operation. West Germany called the raid \\"an act of self defense\\". Switzerland and France also praised Israel for the operation. Significant praise was received from representatives of the United Kingdom and the US both of whom called it \\"an impossible operation\\". Some in the United States noted that the hostages were freed on July 4, 1976 which was 200 years since the signing of the US declaration of independence.http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3525616,00.html◊û◊ë◊¶◊¢ ◊ê◊†◊ò◊ë◊î UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim described the raid as \\"a serious violation of the national sovereignty of a United Nations member state\\". Dozens of Ugandan soldiers were killed in the raid. The Arab and Communist world condemned the operation calling it an act of aggression. For refusing to depart (and subsequently leave some of his passengers as hostages) when given leave to do so by the hijackers, Captain Bacos was reprimanded by his superiors at Air France and suspended from duty for a period. He was awarded by Israel for his heroism in refusing to leave the Jewish hostages behind.Kaplan, David E. \\"A historic hostage-taking revisited.\\" Jerusalem Post. 3 August 2006.

Personal life  Geisler was a graduate of Tenafly High School in Tenafly, New Jersey. He received his bachelor's degree in food technology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He served as an officer in the Quartermaster Corps of the US Army during the Korean War. Geisler resided in Mahwah, New Jersey, for 45 years. He was an ardent stamp collector and dealer, and an original member of the Apple Ridge Golf and Country Club of Mahwah, NJ. An avid golfer with a 4 handicap at one time, he won the Club Championship in all four flights, and throughout his career eagled all 18 holes. He played the bagpipes with the Fairleigh Dickinson University Pipe Band and the Kearny Caledonian Pipe Band for several years, even performing in the St. Patrick Day Parade in NYC.  Career  Geisler founded a company that manufactured shortenings, emulsifiers and other ingredients for the baking and baked goods industry in 1960. One of his customers was Gregory Papalexis, who manufactured both hot dogs and hot dog buns. Papalexis's customers included hot dog street vendors, who often made a popular homemade, but time laborious, onion sauce as a topping. Papalexis asked Geisler to come up with a factory-made onion sauce for the hot dog vendors to sell at their carts in New York City. Geisler, with input from Papalexis, created a new, mass-produced onion sauce for hot dogs. The main formula and spice blends of the sauce consisted predominantly of onions, olive oil and tomato paste, which gives the sauce its distinctive red coloring. The sauce proved to be a hit with both the street vendors, who no longer had to make their own time-consuming sauces, and hot dog consumers. Geisler and Papalexis partnered to form their own company, called Tremont Foods, to market and make the new red onion sauce. The sauce was initially sold to New York City hot dogs vendors under the brand names Tremont Foods or House of Weenies. Papalexis acquired Sabrett Food Products in 1989. As a result of the acquisition, Geisler's onion sauce became the only onion sauce served on Sabrett hot dogs by vendors in New York City. The red onion condiment also became available for purchase in supermarkets under the Sabrett's brand. It is marketed nationwide as \\"Sabrett's Prepared Onions.\\" As of 2009, Geisler's red onion sauce enjoys \\"a couple of million dollars a year in sales,\\" according to Papalexis. Geisler's and Papalexis's original company, Tremont Foods, is currently a division of Marathon Enterprises, Inc., which owns the Sabrett trademark. (Marathon Enterprises is owned by Papalexis.) The only product made by Tremont Foods is the popular red onion sauce. The sauce is manufactured in The Bronx, but production is scheduled to shift to a new facility, in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, in 2009. Geisler remained active with the company until his death in 2009.  Death  Geisler died at his winter home in Hernando, Florida, on January 6, 2009, at the age of 78. Geisler had been suffering from a protein disorder called amyloidosis. He was survived by his wife, Jean Geisler, his daughter, Martha Geisler, his son, Glenn Geisler, his brother and a grandson.

History  The charterhouse was founded on June 2, 1409, by Erkinger von SeinsheimErkinger (1362-1437) acquired Schwarzenberg in 1420, became baron of Schwarzenberg in 1429 and bought Hohenlandsberg in 1435. All later Schwarzenbergs descend from Erkinger and his two wives and his first wife, Anna von Bibra, as a place of burial for their family, a function which the monastery served for several centuries for Erkinger's descendants, the Barons and later Princes von Schwarzenberg. Erkinger, his second wife Barbara von Abensberg, and Anna's sons Michael and Hermann renewed and confirmed the charterhouse in 1434. It was settled by Carthusian monks from Cologne Charterhouse. It was dissolved in 1803 in the secularisation of Bavaria. In 1804 the buildings passed into the ownership of the Princes of Schwarzenberg, descendants of the founder. Although most buildings were demolished, the church, built 1603-09, and the prior's lodging with a chapel of St. John (1583) remain extant. The church contains a Late Baroque high altar of 1723-24 with an altarpiece depicting Saint Bruno of Cologne (founder of the Carthusian Order) and the Virgin Mary by Oswald Onghers, and choir stalls of 1606, with Baroque fittings added in 1724. Today the surviving buildings on the site accommodate the archives of the town of Volkach and from 1999 a museum, the Kartausenmuseum Astheim, run by the Diocese of W√ºrzburg, specialising in Christian graphic art, on which theme it has about 600 exhibits.

It is classified as part of the Plioplatecarpinae subfamily alongside genera like Angolasaurus and Platecarpus. Ectenosaurus is known from the Santonian and Campanian of Kansas, Alabama, and Texas. The generic name means \\"Drawn-out lizard\\", from Greek ectenes (\\"drawn-out\\") and Greek sauros (\\"lizard\\") referencing the elongated muzzle.  Description  Partial skeleton (A) and soft tissues (B) of Ectenosaurus clidastoides. Based on the size of the preserved skull, about 74 centimeters in length, Ectenosaurus would have reached sizes of 5,7 meters in length. It was a rare genus of mosasaur with several unique characteristics that clearly separate it from other mosasaur genera. The most prominent of these features is its elongated jaws, elongated in a similar vein to other mosasaurs with elongated jaws, such as Plotosaurus and Pluridens. Russell (1967) considered the form of the teeth, the shape of the frontal and the large suprastapedial process of the quadrate as evidence of a close relation between Ectenosaurus and Platecarpus. He separated Ectenosaurus from Platecarpus based on the elongated snout, the exclusion of the prefrontals from the narial borders and the fusion of the supra- and infrastepedial processes. = Scales and locomotion = The specimen FHSM VP-401 preserve significantly comprehensive skin impressions from Ectenosaurus, which makes it possible to draw conclusions not only about mosasaur integument at large but also about mosasaur movement and propulsion. The scales are considerably smaller in size (2.7√ó2.0 mm) than those found in the famed LACM 128319 specimen of Platecarpus (3.8√ó4.4 mm), despite the animals being of similar sizes. The combination of small and firmly anchored body scales as well as a complex meshwork of alternating crossed-helical and longitudinal fiber bundles suggest that the anterior torso of Ectenosaurus was reasonably stiff. This also suggests that this section of the body was quite rigid during locomotion, and that the main form of propulsion would have to have been done by the tail (likely possessing a tail fin like other mosasaur species), and that it could not move by undulating its entire body like snakes do, a previously popular view of mosasaur locomotion.  History of discovery  Ectenosaurus was originally described as a species of Platecarpus, P. clidastoides, in 1894. The type specimen was collected by C.H. Sternberg or G. Bauer from Logan County in Kansas and was housed in the Bayerische Staatssammlung fur Palaontologie in Munich, where it was likely destroyed during the Second World War. A second specimen (which was also much better preserved) was discovered by George Sternberg in 1953, which he initially identified as a Clidastes velox. The specimen, GFS 109-53, was about 3 meters in length and largely articulated, though the tail and rear limbs were missing due to erosion. This specimen was then exhibited at the Sternberg Memorial Museum on the campus of Fort Hays State University from its discovery until 1999 when the museum was closed and moved. Since the museum moved, the specimen remains in storage. It was examined in 1963 by Dale A. Russell who determined that it represented a Platecarpus clidastoides and not a Clidastes velox. In his Systematics and Morphology of American Mosasaurs (1967) he re- described the species as part of a new genus, Ectenosaurus.  Classification  Ectenosaurus has been seen as a plioplatecarpine for most of the time since its discovery, partly due to long having been classified as a species of Platecarpus. Some analyses recover it as a mosasaurine however, sharing close relations with Prognathodon. The cladogram below follows Sim√µes et al. (2017), collapsed to only display the Plioplatecarpinae, and shows Ectenosaurus in relation to other plioplatecarpines.

The first fossils remains of this animal suggested a cranial length of and a total length of ; an additional skull that measures long implies a larger size.

Phylogeny  In the initial descriptions of Yaguarasaurus, it was classified as a member of the subfamily Plioplatecarpinae; the analysis of Polcyn and Bell (2005) showed that it was a distant relative of the advanced mosasaurids and were a close relative of Russellosaurus coheni and Tethysaurus nopscai, a group that could be a basal clade to the division between Tylosaurinae and Plioplatecarpinae subfamilies, called Russellosaurina. After the discovery of the basal mosasauroid of Hungary Pannoniasaurus by Mak√°di et al. 2012 it became clear that Yaguarasaurus and the rest of the \\"russellosaurines\\" form a clade of basal amphibian mosasaurs related with the aigialosaurs, a grouping called the subfamily Tethysaurinae; the cladogram below follow the analysis of Mak√°di et al. de 2012: Palci et al.

Most of the sculptural artifacts have been studied as looted pieces appearing in art collections. The area is better known for its Xochipala-style figurines and stone bowls, which have been dated to the Formative (or Preclassic) Period 1500 to 200 BCE. The site is particularly notable for the discovery of a corbelled arch, an innovation generally attributed the Maya. Whether the corbelled arch was independently developed in Guerrero or was imported from the Maya regions is still unsettled.

Gillett Griffin =Olmec?= In his seminal 1972 book, Carlo Gay attributed the sophisticated artistry of the Xochipala figurines to a precocious culture that was the predecessor of the Gulf coast Olmecs.See Gay's Xochipala: The Beginnings of Olmec Art. According to Gay, the naturalistic \\"Early Xochipala\\" figurines led over centuries to the stylised \\"Late Xochipala\\" style which in turn led to what archaeologist Gillett Griffin has called \\"abstracted, . . . ideal,\\" and \\"contrived\\" Olmec art.Griffin, pp. 306 & 309. Despite what Griffin describes as a \\"pure Olmec stratum\\", others have found few similarities between Xochipala figurines and Olmec art. David Grove, for example, finds that minor quantities of some Olmec attributes appear in Gay's \\"Middle Xochipala\\" sequence and in the stone bowls, but these attributes are otherwise missing from Xochipala art.Grove. Michael Coe, however, sees \\"nothing [in the Xochipala figurines or stone bowls] which would lead into the Olmec pattern\\".Coe, p. 81. Gay's proposal is \\"now widely regarded as untenable\\".Pool, p. 57. Trigger refers to the hypothesis as \\"outdated\\", p. 154. By way of an alternate explanation of Xochipala precociousness, David Grove suggests that the earliest figurines were influenced by the \\"already developed and sophisticated ceramic traditions of northern South America\\", an idea that is not widely accepted in the archaeological community. ballplayer 10th - 9th century BCESnite Museum of Art. or 15th - 10th century.Parsons et al., p. 176.

The crisis reached its climax on 21 March 2009 when Andry Rajoelina was declared the president of the High Transitional Authority of Madagascar, five days after Ravalomanana transferred his power to a military council and fled to South Africa. The international community immediately condemned the leader and his ascension as unconstitutional. Financial support and foreign investments stopped, and the country fell into one of the worst economic crises in its history. The SADC and the African Union have been designated to supervise Madagascar's political reinstatement. Though the objective of the transitional government was to run presidential elections as soon as possible to relieve the tensions (despite regular delays), its major challenge has been to establish an agreement among Madagascar's four key political factions (Rajoelina, Ravalomanana, Zafy and Ratsiraka), some of which were and still are unfriendly to the transitional government. On 11 December 2010 a new constitution was formally approved, launching the Fourth Republic. On 28 October 2011 a consensus Prime Minister, Omer Beriziky, was appointed. Presidential and parliamentary elections were scheduled for 8 May and 3 July 2013.  Origins of the conflict  Map of Madagascar in Africa In December 2007, Andry Rajoelina was elected mayor of Antananarivo. Tensions quickly grew between president Ravalomanana and the young mayor over the course of 2008 as Rajoelina became a vocal critic of a series of unpopular policies enacted by the president. He condemned what he called the \\"restriction of freedom\\" on the island, and criticized the president's plans to lease large parts of land to the Korean industrial company Daewoo. On 13 December 2008, the Ravalomanana administration decided to shutter Viva TV, a television channel belonging to Rajoelina after broadcasting an interview with the former exiled president Didier Ratsiraka. Other television and radio stations that also aired the interview were not sanctioned. Andry Rajoelina organized a series of rallies in January 2009 that took aim at the Ravalomanana administration and gave voice to growing popular resentment toward the president's increasingly authoritarian policies and a widespread perception that national development had only benefitted an elite minority of which the president was the most visible figurehead. As anti- government frustration transformed into civil unrest, two state television stations were burned by anti-government protesters. At least 130 people were killed in Madagascar during the crisis. The protests were seen as the gravest challenge faced by the Ravalomanana government since he came to office in 2002. President Ravalomanana vowed to restore order \\"whatever the cost\\", according to a government statement.  Protests  The protests took place in Antananarivo, the capital and largest city in Madagascar. Rajoelina called a general strike during the weekend of 24‚Äì25 January 2009, in the capital city, Antananarivo, against Ravalomanana, whom he has called a dictator. Ravalomanana, who was in South Africa, cut short his trip to a regional summit in Pretoria, and flew back to Madagascar. In a statement Ravalomanana accused the mayor of attempting a coup saying, \\"The call for revolt and civil disobedience... corresponds to a coup d'√©tat...tramples on the values of the constitution and the republic's institutions.\\" On 26 January 2009, the protests turned increasingly violent. Demonstrators set fire to the Madagascar state-owned radio building, attacked a private television station owned by Ravalomanana and looted shops and businesses throughout the city. That same day, armed government security agents reportedly disabled the transmitter of Viva Radio, a private radio station owned by Rajoelina. Protesters ransacked two pro-government television stations in Antananarivo. Thousands of protesters raided and looted the headquarters of the Radio Nationale Malgache and T√©l√©vision Nationale Malgache building around 1 pm local time on 26 January 2009. About an hour later demonstrators burned down the Malagasy Broadcasting System, a private station owned by President Ravalomanana. A policeman and a fourteen-year-old protester were reportedly killed in the clashes at the Malagasy Broadcasting System attacks. Firefighters found the bodies of at least 25 people in the ruins of a burned out, looted department store in downtown Antananarivo. The bodies were thought to be those of looters who became trapped in the burning shop when the roof caved in. In total, 44 people died. Their bodies were taken to a morgue, and all but ten of them were found to be severely burned. In a show of defiance against the government, Rajoelina called for all Antananarivo residents to stay home on 29 January 2009. This \\"ghost town\\" (ville morte) protest basically closed all stores and businesses in the capital city. The Roman Catholic Cardinal emeritus of Antananarivo Armand Razafindratandra appealed for calm as the protests spread outside of the capital. All state and private radio stations in the country reportedly ceased broadcasting, with the exception of Radio Don Bosco, which is run by the Salesian religious institute. Rajoelina said on 31 January that he was taking control of the country due to the failure of Ravalomanana and the government to fulfil their responsibilities. He said that a request for Ravalomanana's \\"immediate resignation\\" would be submitted to Parliament \\"in order to comply with the legal procedure\\". Furthermore, he asked that the central bank withhold money from the government, that all government ministries close, and that the security forces join him. Rajoelina said that he wanted the constitution to be respected and that it was Ravalomanana who had violated the constitution. According to Rajoelina, a new transitional government would soon be appointed under his leadership and a new presidential election would be held within two years. Speaking on the same day, Ravalomanana stated that he was \\"still the president of this country\\" and that he would \\"do what is necessary to develop this nation\\". The African Union (AU) immediately warned Rajoelina that it would not accept an unconstitutional power grab in Madagascar: \\"It's totally forbidden to take power by non- constitutional means.\\" Opposition leaders allied to Rajoelina filed a petition with the High Constitutional Court on 2 February, asking it to remove Ravalomanana from office. By that point, attendance at Rajoelina's rallies had reportedly decreased. On 3 February, Rajoelina said at a rally that he would announce his new government on 7 February. On the same day, the High Constitutional Court ruled that it had no power to remove the President from office, as that power belonged to Parliament. Also on 3 February, Rajoelina was dismissed as Mayor and a special delegation, headed by Guy Randrianarisoa, was appointed instead. Rajoelina denounced the decision, saying that there was \\"no valid reason\\" for it and that he was prepared to face arrest if necessary; he warned that the city would \\"not accept this decision\\". Rajoelina held another rally on 4 February, with about 1,500 people in attendance. On that occasion he described the appointment of Randrianarisoa as \\"an insult to the people of Madagascar\\"; he instead designated Michele Ratsivalaka to succeed him as Mayor and gave her his mayoral scarf. = Shooting at opposition rally = On 7 February, an opposition rally was held with twenty-thousand in attendance. The demonstrators marched towards Ambohitsorohitra Palace and crossed the \\"ligne rouge\\" (red line), the perimeter line around the palace gates that demarcates the zone off-limits to the public. The palace guards responded by firing live ammunition to disperse the crowd. Initial reports counted 83 wounded and 28 people killed, including a local reporter. Some looting was reported afterward. Ambulances took the wounded to hospitals or private clinics, and bodies were seen piled up on the streets before they were taken to the morgue. The National Police warned that the death toll could rise, as many of the wounded were in critical condition. The following day it was reported that the death toll had increased to at least 50, with doctors estimating that 180 people had arrived at the city's main Ravoahangy Andrianavalona Hospital. Antananarivo journalist Fanja Saholiarisoa said: \\"The mortuary is full and the hospital is full. On TV there is a special announcement calling on people who have cars to come and pick up the injured people from the hospitals\\". This brought the number of people killed since the start of the political violence to 130, with 80 people killed before the shooting of the demonstrators, including the people who died in the burned department store. Also on 7 February, Rajoelina said that Roindefo Monja would be prime minister under his transitional authority. According to Rajoelina, each of Madagascar's regions would have representation in the transitional authority. Regarding Ambohitsorohitra Palace, Rajoelina alluded to its history as a mayoral residence prior to 2002 and said that it \\"belongs to the people and to the city\\", while declaring that he had decided to give the palace to Monja for his use as prime minister. On the same day, Ravalomanana urged \\"calm and order\\", accusing Rajoelina of \\"cross[ing] all limits\\", while Prime Minister Charles Rabemananjara announced a one-week extension of the curfew. While visiting hospitalized victims of the shooting on 8 February, Rajoelina vowed to continue his struggle and argued that Ravalomanana's answer to the popular call for change was gunfire. He called for a national day of mourning on 9 February. On 9 February, Defence Minister C√©cile Manorohanta announced her resignation, saying, \\"After all that has happened, I decide as of now to no longer remain part of this government.\\" Chief of military staff Mamy Ranaivoniarivo was appointed to replace Manorohanta on the same day. 7 February shooting was thought to have reversed the opposition's declining momentum. Newspapers published on 9 February, strongly denounced the shooting. On 10 February, speaking before a rally of about 5,000 supporters, Rajoelina urged the people to observe a general strike on the next day; he asked that everyone stay indoors and that no one go to work or attend school. Roindefo announced the appointment of four ministers to serve in his transitional government, and he said that the remainder of them would be appointed by the end of the week. Meanwhile, both Ravalomanana and Rajoelina accepted dialogue in principle; Rajoelina said that dialogue would be conditional on the holding of a new presidential election or the formation of a transitional government. At a 35,000-strong rally in Antananarivo on 14 February, Ravalomanana said that he would serve out his full term as president, that he was listening to the people, and that he regretted the deaths that had occurred during the protests. On the same day, Rajoelina held a rally nearby, with about 10,000 in attendance. At a rally on 17 February, Rajoelina vowed to continue the struggle, and later in the day several thousand of his supporters engaged in sit-ins near key ministries. Representing the government, Defense Minister Ranaivoniarivo invited Roindefo to participate in talks. Rajoelina's supporters took over several important ministries on 19 February, changing the locks and installing Rajoelina's own ministers to work in them. Meanwhile, Ravalomanana appointed a new Minister of the Interior, Rabenja Sehenoarisoa (who had previously served as chief of police in the capital). His predecessor as Interior Minister, Gervais Rakotonirina, was said to have departed the government due to poor health. Only hours after the opposition took over the government ministries, they were removed from the ministries by security forces early on 20 February; about 50 of Rajoelina's supporters were arrested. Ravalomanana and Rajoelina met on 21 February; this meeting, which lasted about 45 minutes, was organized by the Council of Christian Churches in Madagascar. Both Ravalomanana and Rajoelina agreed to five points intended to calm the situation. This was intended as a prelude to more comprehensive dialogue. On 23 February the two met again for about an hour, and they held a third meeting, also lasting an hour, on 24 February. However, Ravalomanana failed to appear for a planned meeting on 25 February, and Rajoelina then announced that he was withdrawing from the talks. Rajoelina criticized Ravalomanana for his absence and furthermore stated that the meetings he had held with Ravalomanana prior to that were disappointing. Odon Razanakolona, who had been mediating the talks, abandoned his role shortly before Rajoelina withdrew from the talks; according to Razanakolona, the talks were fruitless and deadlocked. = Post-talks = A protest in Antananarivo was broken up by the security forces on 26 February. Another protest in Fianarantsoa on 27 February, was also broken up; two deaths and 13 serious injuries were reported in the latter incident. At a 10,000-strong rally in Antananarivo on 28 February, Rajoelina vowed to continue his struggle \\"until we end this dictatorship\\". He said that, beginning on 2 March, protests would be held in the 13 May Plaza on a daily basis; he also called for the army to support him. A protest in Ambositra was broken up by police on 4 March, and two people were killed. Also on 4 March, President Ravalomanana declared his intention to \\"restore order\\" on Radio Mada. In Antananarivo, police blocked roads on 5 March to prevent protests in the 13 May Plaza. The security forces unsuccessfully attempted to arrest Rajoelina at his compound late on 5 March; they also raided his Viva media network. Initially they surrounded Viva, and after 30 minutes the staff attempted to evacuate equipment, at which point the security forces stormed the building and confiscated equipment. Rajoelina told Agence France-Presse on 7 March that he was \\"now hiding in a safe location where I cannot be attacked\\"; it was later acknowledged that he had gone to the residence of the French ambassador on 6 March. = Mutiny and military leadership change = Soldiers at a military base in Soanierana district, near Antananarivo, mutinied on 8 March; they objected to the use of force against the opposition. United Nations envoy Tiebil√© Dram√© said on 9 March that the UN was placing Rajoelina \\"under its protection in a diplomatic residence\\". The French Foreign Ministry said on 10 March that Rajoelina had left the French ambassador's residence. On 10 March, the chief of staff of the Malagasy army, General Edmond Rasolomahandry, gave political leaders 72 hours to solve the country's problems and return peace, threatening to take over if this did not occur. The same day, Defence Minister Ranaivoniarivo announced his resignation shortly after a number of army officers visited his office to threaten a switch of allegiances to Rajoelina. On 11 March, pro-opposition soldiers from the CAPSAT (Army Corps of Personnel and Administrative and Technical Services) stormed the army headquarters and forced Edmond Rasolomahandry to resign. Analysts stated that civil war seemed a distinct possibility. Andre Andriarijaona replaced Rasolomahandry, apparently as a result of internal army deliberations and not a presidential appointment, and Andriarijaona said that the military would remain neutral and not seize power, thus revoking the 72-hour ultimatum. A spokesman for Rajoelina said on 11 March that Rajoelina would not participate in talks planned to begin the next day; subsequently the Christian Council of Churches announced that the talks would be delayed. On 12 March, the opposition took over the Ministry of Finance and Budget with the support of the armed forces while the president's prime minister held a ten- minute meeting with the opposition-designated prime minister, who later stated that Rabemananjara had agreed to give up his job to him. The next day, the chief of the military police stated he was taking orders from Andre Andriarijaona and not from the general appointed by Ravalomanana; this was followed by the sending of army tanks against the Iavoloha Palace of the president, while some 3,000‚Äì5,000 civilian supporters of Ravalomanana surrounded the palace to counter opposition protests further away from the area. The Ravalomanana supporters, however, were told to clear the road in case the army neared the area. On 14 March, Monja occupied the prime minister's office while the opposition forces controlled the building. Monja announced that the opposition forces, called the High Authority of Transition, \\"is presiding over the destiny of Madagascar\\". Rajoelina gave the president four hours, until 6 pm (1500 GMT), to voluntarily resign, after which a mass civilian march would take place on the presidential palace to put Ravalomanana out of office; he explicitly ruled out a violent overthrow through military means. However, Ravalomanana later emerged from the guarded palace after the deadline had passed, asserting that he was still the legal president and calling for a national conference. On 15 March, Ravalomanana offered to hold a referendum on whether he should stay in power or not, which was seen as a sign of the intense pressure placed on his presidency. The following day, Rajoelina rejected this proposal and called on the security forces to arrest Ravalomanana.  Capture of palace and Ravalomanana's resignation  On 16 March 2009, one of the palaces of President Ravalomanana, the Ambohitsorohitra Palace, was stormed and taken by soldiers of the Malagasy Army. Reports also indicate the capture of the country's central bank. The president was not in the stormed palace at the time. The African Union condemned the action, calling it an \\"attempted coup d'√©tat\\". The actions followed an earlier call from opposition leader Andry Rajoelina for the President's arrest; Rajoelina insisted that the palace seizure was not a coup, although he immediately installed himself in the presidential offices of the captured palace. Hours later, the BBC stated that Ravalomanana was to resign and hand over the powers of both the president and prime minister to a military board headed by Vice Admiral Hyppolite Ramaroson. Ravalomanana later said, \\"I never resigned. I was forced to hand power over, at gun point, on March the 17th.\\" At the time, Ravalomanana had already moved out of the Iavoloha Palace to an undisclosed location; as of 24 March, he was reportedly in Swaziland. The military junta, consisting of senior military personnel, would have been charged with organizing elections within 24 months and re-writing the constitution for the \\"Fourth Republic\\". However, Vice Admiral Ramaroson announced on 18 March that it would transfer power directly to Rajoelina, making him president of the opposition-dominated High Transitional Authority that he had appointed weeks earlier. With the military's backing, the authority was charged with taking up the task previously accorded to Ravalomanana's proposed military directorate. Madagascar's constitutional court deemed the transfer of power, from Ravalomanana to the military board and then to Rajoelina, to be legal. The court's statement did not include any justifications for its decision. Rajoelina said that Ravalomanana should be prosecuted for allegedly using lethal force against unarmed opposition demonstrators earlier in the year. Rajoelina is prohibiting Ravalomanana's ministers from leaving the country. On 19 March, Rajoelina suspended both chambers of Parliament. Roindefo responded to international criticism on 20 March, saying that the government will \\"explain the real situation. Maybe the way Madagascar acts is not very clear. Things can be a bit specific which may be difficult to follow in every detail.\\" According to Roindefo, the transfer of power was not a coup d'√©tat but instead \\"the direct expression of democracy, when representative democracy does not express itself through the institutions\\". Rajoelina was sworn in as President on 21 March before a crowd of 40,000 supporters. No foreign diplomats were in attendance; Rajoelina's foreign minister said none were invited.  Backlash  On the same day, Malagasy navy troops called for Rajoelina's resignation by 25 March, threatening to use force otherwise to protect the constitution of Madagascar. According to their statement, the navy troops \\"condemn all violence against civilians\\" committed by the army corps in March and denounce Rajoelina for the \\"civil war occurring in Madagascar\\". The navy troops claimed that there was \\"irrefutable\\" evidence that Rajoelina had paid the army corps hundreds of millions of ariaries and that they should face trials in accordance with military law. The navy troops called for other nations not to get involved in what they considered a purely domestic affair. In a recorded message from Ravalomanana played to around 10,000 of supporters on 25 March, Ravalomanana encouraged people to \\"save the nation, defend the union and our national unity\\" because Rajoelina's government was \\"destroying our country with their coup.\\" Also on 25 March, Rajoelina invited Ravalomanana's political party to join other political parties, unions, and business leaders to discuss reconciliation on 2 and 3 April. Rajoelina said the meeting would also include planning for the next elections. Rajoelina said he would appoint the members of the group who would organize the meeting. Ravalomanana's political party, Tiako I Madagasikara (TIM), did not immediately comment on whether it would participate in those meetings. On 26 March, Rajoelina's justice minister said that Rajoelina had given a presidential pardon to 28 \\"political prisoners\\" and that more would be pardoned in the future. Members of TIM spoke to the crowd. The names of the pardoned individuals were not made public. About 6,000 people who supported Ravalomanana assembled in a park in downtown Antananarivo on 26 March, the fourth consecutive of such protests. Members of TIM spoke to the crowd. Referring to the reconciliation meeting proposed by Rajoelina, the speakers said that Ravalomanana would be involved only if he were recognized at the meeting as Madagascar's elected president and only if the United Nations, Southern African Development Community, or another neutral, international body organized the meeting. The speakers urged Ravalomanana to leave Swaziland, return to Madagascar, and call the bicameral parliament back in session. One speaker said that elections should only be held after Ravalomanana was reinstated as president. Following the speeches, security forces fired tear gas and shot bullets into the air to disperse the crowd. The following day, about 6,000 people who supported Ravalomanana assembled again, the fifth such demonstration in five consecutive days. Police used tear gas on the assembled individuals at the end of the event, as they did at the end of the previous day's demonstration. On 28 March, between 15,000 and 20,000 protesters assembled for the sixth consecutive day. In a recorded message played to the assembled crowd, Ravalomanana encouraged his supporters to continue protesting and gave assurance that he would return to Madagascar soon. While marching towards the 13 May Plaza, the same location that Rajoelina's supporters had assembled earlier in the year, police fired their weapons into the air and used tear gas to disperse the crowds, resulting in a stampede that injured 34 people. A young protester named \\"Razily\\", who was seen in a video of 28 March protests carrying the Malagasy flag at the head of the protests before being publicly beaten and carted off by police, became a cause c√©l√®bre when the video was distributed online; he has not been seen since his arrest. Police said they were trying to keep Ravalomanana's supporters from confronting Rajoelina's supporters. In response to the police actions, Ravalomanana's supporters encouraged a general strike on 30 March, saying, \\"Students should not go to school, office workers should stop their work and the private sector should stop paying taxes so as not to support an illegal regime.\\" Protests continued nearly every day thereafter. On 31 March, Rajoelina announced the individuals who would constitute the cabinet of his transitional administration for 24 months until elections are held. Rajoelina compared himself to Ravalomanana, saying that Ravalomanana was not immediately accepted by world leaders when he came to power in 2002. Rajoelina reiterated his previous statements that other countries should not \\"interfere\\" with his rise to the presidency of Madagascar. Rajoelina also announced a freeze of all mining contracts with foreign companies, saying that the foreign companies are not paying the fees and royalties that are legally due to Madagascar. Still asserting that he was the legitimate president, Ravalomanana announced from exile that he was appointing Manandafy Rakotonirina as Prime Minister on 16 April. Ravalomanana made this announcement by telephone at a rally of his supporters in Antananarivo, with Rakotonirina in attendance. On 20 April, people gathered in Antananarivo to listen to Ravalomanana speak by telephone and protest the closure of two radio stations, Radio Fahazavana and Radio Mada, the latter of which is owned by Ravalomanana. When the protesters began marching to a courthouse in the center of the city, police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and then fired their guns. A BBC reporter witnessed a protester killed after being shot in the back at close range. Another protester was also killed and twenty people went to the hospital for injuries sustained during the protests. The following day, thousands of people assembled to mourn the two deaths. Prime Minister Roindefo Monja announced that \\"all demonstrations are banned, including those in support of Andry Rajoelina, in order to restore law and order.\\" Despite the ban, a demonstration was held the following day. Over a thousand people assembled to protest, fewer in number and shorter in duration as compared in previous days. Cars and trucks were set on fire and people were looting in Antananarivo on 23 April. Police used tear gas, detonators, and gun fire to break up protests. Six protesters were arrested. After Ravalomanana appointed him as Prime Minister, Rakotonirina began working out of the Carlton hotel in Antananarivo, and he appointed ministers to occupy the key government portfolios on 28 April. Soldiers with a warrant for Rakotonirina's arrest stormed the Carlton and arrested him on 29 April; they found him hiding in a bathroom after searching for about an hour. A spokesperson for Rajoelina described Rakotonirina as \\"the mastermind of last week's violence\\". Also in late April, Rajoelina's government informed the AU that it was prepared to hold an election by the end of 2009, earlier than it had previously stated. = Reconciliation meeting = At a reconciliation meeting that included four former presidents of Madagascar and United Nations negotiators, it was announced on 3 April that a constitutional referendum would be held in September 2009, parliamentary elections in March 2010 and presidential elections in October 2010. On 11 April, Ravalomanana's supporters ended their participation in meetings with Rajoelina's supporters. Ravalomanana's supporters saying that the meetings were not worthwhile because their condition of the Ravalomanana's return to power was not met, nor was the United Nations' special envoy to Madagascar, Ti√©bil√© Dram√©, acting as an impartial mediator. In response, Dram√© said he was \\"seeking a consensus\\" rather than an \\"imposed solution\\". On the same day, more than 10,000 people assembled in Antananarivo to protest Rajoelina's government. At a meeting on 23 May 2009 a breakthrough was reached; a transitional government and a truth and reconciliation commission was agreed to be formed, and all former presidents would be allowed to stand in the presidential elections; this last point was seen as controversial, as it might increase instability. However, on 25 May 2009 the party of Didier Ratsiraka withdrew from the talks. = Mediation crisis talks = Former exiled president of Madagascar Marc Ravalomanana, President of the High Authority of Transition of Madagascar Andry Rajoelina, former exiled Madagascar president Didier Ratsiraka and former president of the Malagasy Republic Albert Zafy met on Tuesday 4 August 2009 in Maputo, Mozambican capital, for four-day-long mediation crisis talks with the former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano acting as mediator. Representatives came from the African Union (AU), United Nations (UN), the International Organisation of the Francophonie and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The mediation talks hoped to arrive at a way for Ravalomanana to return to Madagascar from his exile in South Africa. The talks were also a trade meeting to begin negotiations on the transition charter to seek new elections in Madagascar. Ratsiraka, who had been exiled in France, saw his amnesty issue resolved at the talks. The four leaders sought to again become a customs union (SADC), and representatives of the United Nations.  Unity government deal  On 7 November 2009, the leaders agreed to a power- sharing deal in which Rajoelina stays as president, creation of two co- presidents, Fetison Rakoto Andrianirina, aide to former President Ravalomanana and Emmanuel Rakotovahiny, aide to former President Zafy. Prime Minister Eugene Mangalaza who was appointed on 10 October will be retained heading the 31-member cabinet. The deal also creates a 65-member council of transitional advisers and a transitional parliament composed of 258 members.  Other effects = Environmental = During the transition in the government, people have been illegally hunting and logging in Marojejy National Park and other conservation areas in Madagascar. While the new Malagasy government is otherwise preoccupied and some park rangers have left their posts, armed groups are cutting down valuable rosewood trees. Laws prohibiting the export of rosewood were repealed in January 2009, so the illegally acquired logs can be sold and exported for profit. Thousands of local people were involved in cutting a documented 123,000 rosewood logs representing an estimated 45,000 rosewood trees from Marojejy, Masoala and Makira National Parks between January‚ÄìOctober 2009, with at least 871 containers already exported to China between March‚ÄìApril 2009 alone from the Vohemar and Toamasina ports. Floating the rosewood logs down rivers also requires cutting of 4‚Äì5 lighter trees, and several rosewood species are endangered or occur at low densities below 1‚Äì5 trees per hectare. Numerous new access paths are created and some individuals built a 6-kilometer-long road into a remote northern park to transport the logs. Some ships land directly on the coast to pick up the logs, rather than at government-controlled ports. Bribery of customs officials has been reported. Radio commercials have been aired seeking workers to help in the process. Extracting resources from these conservation areas is likely to threaten already critically endangered species such as the silky sifaka lemur, one of the top 25 most endangered primates in the world. A statement jointly released by several non-governmental organizations criticized the logging and hunting occurring in national parks, illegal mining, and slash-and-burn farming occurring in Madagascar. The joint statement said that \\"These deplorable acts will only further impoverish the country and deprive future generations of the Malagasy people from their unique natural heritage.\\" The groups who issued the statement were World Wide Fund for Nature, Conservation International, Wildlife Conservation Society, Missouri Botanical Garden, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Institute for the Conservation of Tropical Environment, The Peregrine Fund, ONG Fanamby, Madagascar Fauna Group, L'Homme et l'Environnement, and Plant Resources for Tropical Africa. = Contracts = In 2009, Rajoelina canceled a contract with South Korean company Daewoo. Under the contract, Daewoo would have leased of land, almost half of Madagascar's arable land, for 99 years to grow corn and palm oil for export to South Korea, a project that might have created as many as 45,000 jobs. On 10 April 2009, Madagascar's Minister of Land Reform confirmed that the contract with Daewoo had been canceled because its \\"approach was wrong\\", even though \\"the project by itself wasn't bad and such a project is welcome\\". As of 10 April, Daewoo said it had not been informed of the contract's cancellation and would proceed with the project regardless. On 17 March 2009, Canadian energy company Sherritt International said its 27-year $4.5-billion nickel-mining project would still begin in 2010 and reach full production in 2013, as scheduled. On 19 March 2009, it said it was likely the project's start date would be delayed. = Economic = Finance Minister Benja Razafimahaleo reported a decrease in government revenue of 15 to 20 percent. Ravalomanana owns Tiko, the largest dairy farm in Madagascar. After Rajoelina became president, Rajoelina's supporters looted Tiko dairy farms, resulting in a milk shortage in Madagascar. Revenue from foreign tourists has decreased by 70 percent, in part because some foreign countries are cautioning their citizens against visiting the country About 70 percent of hotels have closed due to the sharp drop in business. One large hotel that has remained open temporarily laid off 150 of its 400 employees and cut the hours and wages of its other 250 employees. Strikes, wage shortages, and cuts in foreign aid are also causing economic problems for the country. = Sports = On 28 January 2009, the Confederation of African Football canceled a match between Madagascar's Academie Ny Antsika and R√©union's Union Sportive Stade Tamponnaise, which was set to be played in Antananarivo.  International reactions  * Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs Lawrence Cannon said that Madagascar's recent political actions are illegal and \\"anti-democratic\\". Canada supports a peaceful and democratic resolution with help from the international community. * Czech Republic's Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg called the removal of Ravalomanana a \\"coup d'√©tat\\". * France's President Nicolas Sarkozy urged Madagascar to hold elections \\"as soon as possible\\" to end the \\"coup d'√©tat\\". Sarkozy criticized the decision to dismiss Madagascar's parliament. Asserting that Ravalomanana should be kept safe, Sarkozy offered that \\"if he needs to be put on trial, he should be.\\" * Germany condemned the violent transfer of power, urging democracy to return immediately. Germany said that street protests are not a democratic method of changing the government. * Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement expressing \\"concern\\" that the governmental transition is \\"inconsistent with the ordinary constitutional procedures amid the political turmoil that has involved civilians\\". Japan \\"strongly expects\\" that democracy and constitutional order returns \\"at the earliest opportunity\\". Japan also urges that peace and the safety of civilians be upheld. * Libya's president Muammar al-Gaddafi telephoned Rajoelina immediately after Rajoelina took power to say that Libya would recognize Rajoelina's government. * Mexico's ambassador to the United Nations, Claude Heller, said that it was \\"very clear that there was an unconstitutional coup\\" and said that elections were the only way to move Madagascar forward. * Nigeria's Foreign Minister Ojo Maduekwe said that Nigeria urges \\"a restoration of constitutional order\\", calling the opposition forces \\"illegal and unconstitutional\\" and their actions \\"unacceptable\\". * Norway's Minister of the Environment and International Development Erik Solheim said that \\"there is an urgent need for a democratic solution to the current situation in Madagascar. The country is moving towards an economic disaster. I am deeply concerned about the people of the country\\". * Russia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov stated that Russia is \\"concerned by the increased frequency of attempts on the African continent to resort to non-constitutional methods of solving internal political problems.\\" He went on to say that, in addition to increasing economic and social problems, the use of force is of concern and runs counter to democratic principles, whilst affirming Russia's support of the African Union's position. * South African Minister of Foreign Affairs Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said that South Africa would support \\"pressure\\", possibly including sanctions, and the \\"non-recognition\\" of Rajoelina's government by the Southern African Development Community. * Swaziland's King Mswati said that Rajoelina's rise to power was unconstitutional and \\"violates basic principles, protocols and treaties\\". * United Kingdom's Foreign Office Minister Mark Malloch Brown said he \\"condemn[s] unreservedly the unconstitutional, undemocratic and apparently coerced transfer of power from President Ravalomanana to Andry Rajoelina. These events are tantamount to a coup d'√©tat.\\" He urges a peaceful, constitutional, and democratic resolution. * United States State Department spokesman Robert Wood said \\"The United States is deeply concerned by the recent political violence in Madagascar\\". He advised the Malagasy people to use restraint and sort out differences by process of dialogue. Wood later confirmed that the State Department believes that \\"recent political developments in Madagascar constitute an undemocratic transfer of power\\". On 20 March, Wood said that the United States \\"condemns the process\\" of Ravalomanana's removal and Rajoelina's takeover, calling it \\"undemocratic and contrary to the rule of law\\". United States Ambassador to Madagascar R. Niels Marquardt described a \\"climate of insecurity\\" in Madagascar. Marquardt said that Madagascar would be likely be deemed ineligible for the trade preferences under the African Growth and Opportunity Act if it did not hold elections by the end of 2009. * Zambia's Foreign Affairs Minister Kabinga Pande called Andry Rajoelina's coming to power in Madagascar \\"a setback and danger to the entrenchment of democracy and constitutional rule on the continent which should not be allowed to take root. \\" Zambia has also led the call for economic sanctions against Madagascar and suspension of the country from the SADC and AU. * African Union issued a statement regarding the events of 16 March, stating \\"The situation in Madagascar is an internal conflict. It is an attempted coup d'√©tat. We condemn the attempted coup d'√©tat. We ask the people of Madagascar to do everything consistent with their constitution.\\" Madagascar's membership in the African Union was later suspended. The African Union threatened to expel Madagascar from the organization, and warned of the possibility of sanctions. * European Commission issued a statement that it was \\"seriously concerned about the situation of instability and uncertainty currently prevailing in Madagascar. The European Commission calls on all parties in Madagascar to ensure calm and invites them to participate immediately in a broader dialogue.\\" * Inter- Parliamentary Union President Theo-Ben Gurirab said he strongly condemns the \\"coup d'√©tat\\" in Madagascar, saying that any unconstitutional action overthrowing a government is fundamentally flawed and completely unacceptable. The Inter-Parliamentary Union suspended the membership of the parliament of Madagascar. * South African Development Community refused to recognize Rajoelina's presidency because \\"his appointment does not only violate the constitution of Madagascar, but also international principles, like the SADC, AU and United Nations protocols.\\" The SADC \\"strongly condemns in the strongest terms the circumstances that led to the ousting of a democratically elected president of Madagascar.\\" The SADC says that elections should be held within six months, rather than twenty-four months as proposed by Rajoelina. The SADC suspended Madagascar's membership until it restores constitutional order, and it urged Rajoelina to step down so that Ravalomanana could be reinstated as president. If Rajoelina does not comply with its decisions, the \\"SADC shall in collaboration with the African Union and the United Nations consider other options to restore constitutional normalcy.\\" On 1 April, Madagascar withdrew its membership in the SADC. A delegation from the SADC visited Madagascar on 20 April, and another delegation visited on 23 April. * United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon called on the Malagasy Government to give absolute priority to protection of the general population. He expressed concern about \\"the serious unrest\\" and the deaths. Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs Haile Menkerios said that the United Nations urges \\"quick and inclusive elections\\" to return to a constitutional government in a process decided upon by the current and former governments. = Sanctions and suspensions of aid = Since 16 March, Norway has instituted sanctions, mostly consisting of a freeze of economic aid, primarily due to the unstable atmosphere in the country prior to the resignation of Ravalomanana, and it has retained such sanctions for the time being. On 20 March, U.S. State Department spokesman Robert Wood said the United States will suspend all non-humanitarian assistance to Madagascar. The African Union suspended Madagascar's membership in the organization. The Peace and Security Council of the African Union announced that it would impose sanctions on the Madagascar government if an \\"unconstitutional\\" transfer of power were to take place, including total expulsion from the African Union. The African Union can enact sanctions if Madagascar does not restore constitutional order within six months. The African Union's stance was corroborated by Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, who stated that the European Union may impose sanctions on Madagascar and not recognize the transfer of power, and the United States Department of State, which indicated a similar response to any \\"extra- constitutional\\" regime change. The Southern African Development Community will meet in late March to consider sanctions. On 31 March, the European Union said it had not suspended its aid to Madagascar, which will continue for the next three years as previously agreed, but it also had no plans for new aid. US President Barack Obama decided to remove Madagascar from the beneficiary of the AGOA African Growth and Opportunity Act. On 23 December of the year 2009, President Obama also terminated the program for Guinea, Niger and Madagascar because of their undemocratic changes of power. The AGOA program has helped created ten of thousands of jobs for middle class Malagasy especially in apparel manufacturing factories, it is feared that most of these jobs will be lost in the near future. Considering the important number of business affected by this decision, the economy of the capital city Antananarivo and Antsirabe will be deeply affected fearing further social tension. = Government response = Most of the government response has been channeled through opposition prime minister Monja Roindefo, who denied that the events leading to Rajoelina's gaining of the presidency was a coup, but rather a \\"direct expression of democracy, when representative democracy does not express itself through the institutions\\", and called on the European Union to reconsider its reaction to the events. Rajoelina dismissed the condemnations, stating that \\"if they haven't understood the process, they may well react. But if they stick to their line after we have spoken, it will be annoying\\". Rajoelina has promised that the high cost of living would decrease because merchants had agreed to decrease the price of bread and cooking oil as of 30 March, and the cost of rice soon thereafter. In response to the Southern African Development Community's view that Rajoelina's rise to power was unconstitutional and its urging for elections within six months, Rajoelina said that membership in the SADC is \\"not in the interests of Madagascar\\". He said he would confer with others to decide whether Madagascar would continue to be a member of the SADC. \\"The prospect of an SADC intervention is unacceptable. Other states cannot interfere with the decision of (Madagascar's) High Constitutional Court\\" that the transfer of power to Rajoelina was constitutional.

He was an associate of the Tammany Hall political organization in the city. Early life William Copeland Dodge was born on September 6, 1880 Manchester, New Hampshire to Arthur Pillsbury Dodge (1849‚Äì1915) and Elizabeth Ann Day (1854‚Äì1927). The family moved to Chicago in 1891, and then to New York City in 1897. Dodge graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology, and from New York University School of Law. He was admitted to the bar in 1906. He later entered politics as a member of Tammany Hall; his patron was James Joseph Hines. Political career He was elected in 1918 as a member of the New York State Senate (20th D.), serving in 1919 and 1920. As a State Senator he was active in urging an investigation of William Hamilton Anderson of the New York Anti-Saloon League. In December 1924, he was appointed by D.A. Joab H. Banton as an Assistant D.A. of New York County. In 1927, he was appointed by Mayor Jimmy Walker as a city magistrate to fill the vacancy caused by the retirement of Norman J. Marsh. In November 1933, Dodge was elected New York County District Attorney with promises to clean up the office by eliminating leaks. Leaks in the prosecution of racketeering cases had earlier led to intimidation of witnesses, thereby allowing more notable criminals to escape prosecution. His plan was to provide to the grand jury only the minimum information required to receive an indictment. =Runaway grand jury= In 1934, a grand jury was convened to investigate gambling in the city. The grand jury sat for 11 months, but resulted in only a few prosecutions. Charges were made that politicians were regularly fixing gambling cases. A memo by Mayor Fiorello La Guardia's office showed that between February 1 and September 30, 1934, 91% of the gambling cases brought by police never even came to trial, and of those that did come to trial, one third ended in fines usually under $50. On March 4, 1935, Dodge convened a grand jury to investigate gambling, and in particular the actions of Dutch Schultz. The grand jury spent its time with other cases and information on witnesses was being leaked. Grand jurors complained that only junior investigators were assigned to them. Gambling kingpins were quoted in the newspapers boasting that they would never be indicted. The jurors complained in open court about the problems on May 7, 1935, which was widely reported by the city newspapers. On May 22, 1935, Dodge agreed to appoint a special prosecutor from a list prepared by the New York County Lawyers Association. He balked at appointing any of the Republicans on the list because he considered them political opponents of Democrats. Instead, he selected H. H. Corbin, a compromise candidate proposed by former Republican Governor Nathan L. Miller, despite objections by the grand jurors. When the juror objections were made public, Corbin refused the appointment. The \\"runaway\\" grand jury disbanded in June, still complaining that the cases were not adequately being investigated. On June 24, 1935 Governor Herbert H. Lehman said a new investigation would occur. Of the four names that were put forth, only Thomas E. Dewey accepted the task; he brought a series of successful prosecutions. Dodge chose not to run for re-election in 1937, and he left office at the end of his term in December 1937. Republican Thomas Dewey was elected in November to succeed him as New York County Attorney. It remains unclear whether Dodge criminally profited from the events. It was revealed that gangster Dutch Schultz paid $15,000 for his election. His patron Hines was quoted in his own trial as saying Dodge was \\"stupid, respectable, and my man.\\" Dodge was never formally charged with any wrongdoing. Death and legacy Dodge died on August 4, 1973 in Lee, Florida. Dodge kept scrapbooks throughout his life documenting his career and personal interests. These scrapbooks are housed in the Special Collections of the Lloyd Sealy Library at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Included in the Dodge Collection are materials related to his campaign and clippings from New York City newspapers that documented local crime at the time.

It is based upon the true story of Helmuth H√ºbener, the youngest person to be sentenced to death by the Nazis during World War II. He was arrested and killed on October 27, 1942 sent to a death penalty by guillotine. Bartoletti fleshed out one episode from her non-fiction Newbery Honor Book, Hitler Youth: Growing Up in Hitler's Shadow (2006), into this novel. Plot The majority of the story is told through flashbacks, as Helmuth H√ºbener, charged with treason, waits in a Berlin prison for his execution. Starting with his memories as a young boy, Helmuth recounts his childhood growing up in Nazi Germany with his mother Mutti (German for \\"Mom\\"), grandparents, two brothers, his best friends Rudi and Karl and his future stepfather Hugo, a Nazi soldier. As a young boy, Helmuth plans to become a soldier and fight for Germany but that changes when he grows up, and Helmuth stands out as a very intelligent young man. He becomes very opinionated about the Nazi government when he sees his Jewish classmate's father mercilessly murdered by the SA. Helmuth's brothers like Gerhard are separated as Gerhard goes to serve the country in marine work. He begins to secretly listen to forbidden enemy radio broadcasts, and enlists the help of two of his closest friends in distributing anti-Nazi material. Helmuth uses pamphlets to tell the truth about Hitler and the Nazis but ends up getting caught, because of his mistake, and he is executed by guillotine in Berlin, Germany. Background After Bartoletti finished her non-fiction Newbery Honor Book, Hitler Youth: Growing Up in Hitler's Shadow (2006), she wanted to expand on Helmuth H√ºbener's \\"amazing story\\" and \\"heroic actions\\" into another book. She chose fiction to explore deeper what his thoughts may have been and raise \\"questions about moral courage, nationalism, and the responsibility of the individual.\\" This story about Helmuth H√ºbener chronicles his years in school and his first job after graduation. Helmuth took an apprenticeship in the Bieberhaus, which is at the Social Welfare Department at City Hall. Although originally proud of the Fatherland and an enthusiastic participant in the Jungvolk, the Hitler Youth group, Helmuth became disillusioned as Nazi power and policies spread in Germany. Helmuth and a group of friends including Karl-Heinz Schnibbe, Rudolf Wobbe, and Gerhard Duwer, monitored banned radio broadcasts, in which the Allied Powers gave an accurate portrayal of the war in Europe rather than the version told through Axis propaganda. The friends printed pamphlets that were critical of Nazi Germany and distributed them to the public. Their activities were discovered by a co-worker of Helmuth's at the Bieberhaus and they were turned in to the Gestapo, where Helmuth was interrogated, beaten, and arrested for what was considered treason. Helmuth's friends received lighter sentences for their crimes. A brief trial for \\"show\\" was held at the People's Court or Volksgerichtshof, and at age seventeen, Helmuth H√ºbener was executed at Plotzensee Prison in Berlin, becoming the youngest person in history executed for opposing the Third Reich. Contents The book includes author's note, pictures, copy of poster announcing Helmuth H√ºbener's execution, 1936 map of Europe, and a Third Reich timeline, 1918-1945.

The name Kho-Bwa was originally proposed by George van Driem (2001). It is based on the reconstructed words *kho (\\"water\\") and *bwa (\\"fire\\"). Blench (2011) suggests the name Kamengic, from the Kameng area of Arunachal Pradesh, or alternatively Bugun‚ÄìMey, after its two main members. Alternatively, Anderson (2014)Anderson, Gregory D.S. 2014. On the classification of the Hruso (Aka) language. Paper presented at the 20th Himalayan Languages Symposium, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. refers to Kho-Bwa as Northeast Kamengic. Both Van Driem and Blench group the Bugun (or Khowa), the Mey (or Sherdukpen), and the Lishpa (or Lish) languages. The Puroik (or Sulung) language is included in the group by Van Driem but treated as a language isolate with no genetic relation to Kamengic by Blench. These languages have traditionally been placed in the Tibeto-Burman group by the Linguistic Survey of India, but the justification of this is open to question. The languages have certainly been strongly influenced by the neighboring Sino-Tibetan languages, but this does not necessarily imply genetic unity and may possibly be a purely areal effect. Blench (2011): \\"Certainly, the phonology and morphology of Arunachali languages looks superficially like Tibeto-Burman, which explains their placing in the Linguistic Survey of India. Unfortunately, this is rather where matters have remained [... this paper] proposes we should take seriously the underlying presumption probably implied in Konow's statement in Linguistic Survey of India. Volume III, 1, Tibeto-Burman family, Calcutta (1909:572)], that these languages may not be Sino-Tibetan but simply have been influenced by it; that they are language isolates.\\" The entire language family has about 15,000 speakers (including Puroik) or about 10,000 speakers (excluding Puroik), according to estimates made during the 2000s. Word lists and sociolinguistic surveys of Kho-Bwa languages have also been conducted by Abraham, et al. (2018).

It aired from 1997 to 2001 and was initially directed by Bernie Zelvis and was hosted by Jade Gatt (who was dropped from the show in controversial circumstances), Ugly Phil and Jackie O. By 1999 the program was no longer filmed in a studio and was instead shot on various locations across Sydney and Melbourne. With the structural change also came a change of host with Nick Benett, Fiona Horne and Rod Cuddihy presenting the show during 1999 and 2000. Damian Harland was editor 1999 & 2000. Although ill-fated, it is remembered as being one of the early television programs in Australia to feature an internet presence during its early years.
