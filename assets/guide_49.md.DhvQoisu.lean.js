In May 1991, CPPE was created as a direct response to the perceived lack of continuing professional development support given to community pharmacists, as outlined in Section 63 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968.Grimes, L, Shaw M and Cutts C. 2013. Patient and public involvement in the design of education for pharmacists; is this an untapped resource? Currents in Pharmacy Teaching and Learning (5) pp. 632-636 History The CPPE was originally part of the North West Regional Health Authority and its funding came directly from the National Health Service. The original head office was based at Gateway House in Manchester. it began with a mandate to provide free access to continuing professional development resources for community pharmacists. It later included all pharmacists providing services in the NHS in England. It became a part of the University of Manchester in August 1995, operating under an agreement with the NHS Executive: Office of the Chief Pharmacist. The original management had members from the Regional Health Authority, the University of Manchester and the Department of Health. The first director was Alison Blenkinsopp, who went on to be Professor of the Practice Pharmacy at Bradford University. The current director is Matthew Shaw. The CPPE is now commissioned to provide continuing professional development for community pharmacists. This took the form of workshops and distance learning materials. Workshops, first launched in 1992, were run on a national basis using a network of tutors. By March 1992 65 tutors were employed, later growing to 99. The learning offered in workshops covers a number of platforms including online learning, workshops, e-courses and independent study. In 2006, 15 years after the CPPE was established, the Department of Health embarked on a review which found that it was an effective provider of high-quality learning resources to pharmacists and pharmacy technicians across England, and it considered the CPPE a centre of excellence.

The city has grown into Northern areas and the transport system is focused on the southern areas. In the south, however, it is badly degraded and in need of upgrade. The city of Johannesburg invested a large percentage of its budget to this problem.  Heavy rail/Metrorail system  Johannesburgs metrorail system is run by PRASA. However, due to years of underinvestment it has degraded badly with most of the fleet being over 50 years old, also multiple concerns have been raised about its safety. PRASA and the government have acknowledged these issues and have invested R172 billion (the equivalent of $1.1 billion) towards modernization of the entire system including the fleet. Over the next 25 years this plan will be implemented with 60% of the units manufactured locally. The routes cover only the southern area of Johannesburg. File:South Africa-Metrorail-001.jpgCurrent fleet from the 1950s  Suburban rail/Rapid rail  Johannesburg unlike the common misconception doesn't have a light rail system rather it has a rapid rail system known as the Gautrain. Built in 2010 to provide a reliable and efficient rail to the northern suburbs that do not have a heavy rail/ metro system and to alleviate traffic on the N1 Ben schoeman highway, the highway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, it is said to be the busiest highway in the Southern Hemisphere. Seeing completion in 2012 the Gautrain has grown to become a huge success, transporting so many people a day it had to expand its fleet. The Gautrain works on a smartcard system, the passenger taps in at the first/starting station and taps out at the next station. However some believe that the R24 billion ( the equivalent of $1.7 billion) could have been spent on other more essential projects, such as housing, water etc. A 200 km, 18 station expansion is underway with 3 new lines being built, this could take a total of 12 years to complete. Bringing the total amount of stations to 28 and the amount of track to 280 km in total. The system also runs a feeder bus system that uses the same smartcard system as the trains with your average trip costing about $0.65 however the routes only cover a 5‚Äì8 km radius neglecting many areas, mist notably the areas around Rosebank.

A new Eco-Friendly fleet have been purchased recently, some of the features include tinted windows to save fuel on air conditioning, Eco-Friendly fuel, plush seats etc. A fleet purchased even more recently is co-branded with the Rea Vaya showing the city's efforts to integrate public transport.  Bus Rapid Transit/ Rea Vaya  Rea Vaya station Johannesburg is known is South Africa and Africa for having bumper to bumper traffic, taking this into consideration, the city designed a cheap affordable to build and efficient system in 2010 to get people from far away to the city center to work and to the stadiums without the notorious taxi industry, the best option was a BRTS, the first in Africa, named the Rea Vaya which means \\"we are going\\". The goal of the project is to make the entire city accessible to at least 80% of residents. At the time of writing the system is safe, cheap and effective. The trunk and complementary routes run on their own lanes avoiding the infamous j'oburg traffic jams and the feeder routes run on roads like normal buses. = Fee/payment system, Rea Vaya = The system works on a smartcard system with the passenger \\"taping in\\"( touching the smartcard onto the reader at the station or bus, depending on the route, Feeder routes have no stations instead they have buses and trunk and complementary routes have large stations) and taping out at the destination station/ bus stop. The fee is determined according to distance traveled, approximately R5/ $0.4 per kilometer. This is a cheap and affordable option competing with the minibus taxi industry. = Safety and effectiveness = The system is safe and clean, with CCTV cameras at all stations along with security guards, this not only keeps the stations and system safe but also the area around it.

He is also believed to have assisted planning the Charlie Hebdo shooting. He was arrested in Djibouti on December 16, 2018 and extradited to France on charges of terrorism. Early life He was born sometime in 1982 near the Parc des Buttes Chaumont in the 19th arrondissement of Paris, France. Cherif's father, who died when his son was 14, was a Catholic Afro-Caribbean immigrant. His mother, Myriam, was born in Tunisia. Radicalization He converted to Islam in 2003 and was radicalised by the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Farid Benyettou was his mentor. In early 2004, Cherif took part in protests against a French law banning Islamic head scarves in public schools. He was filmed by news crews and police intelligence officers next to Farid Benyettou. He left for Damascus in May 2004, saying he was going to join friends studying at a Koranic school. The school was known as a way station for European fighters on their way to Iraq. U.S. troops in Iraq captured Cherif and another Frenchman near Fallujah on 2 December 2004. He was wounded twice fighting in the First Battle of Fallujah and the Second Battle of Fallujah. Cherif was detained, unarmed, at a checkpoint and imprisoned at Camp Bucca. In August 2005, he was transferred to Abu Ghraib prison. He was convicted in Baghdad in July 2006 for illegally crossing the border, and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He escaped in March 2007 in a prison break by the Islamic State of Iraq. He traveled to Syria, where he was arrested, extradited, and served 18 months in jail in France. He was released pending trial and fled the country to Yemen. He was sentenced to five years in prison, in absentia, for being a member of a terrorist organization on 16 August 2012. In the summer of 2011, he was present at a meeting with Ch√©rif Kouachi in Yemen to plan the Charlie Hebdo shooting. Peter Cherif helped provide Kouachi with cash and a few days of al Qaeda training, according to French and U.S. intelligence officials. In May 2011, he was involved in interpreting for AQAP in the case of three French aid workers kidnapped in Yemen by the group. According to his United Nations listing, he has been involved in the recruitment of foreign fighters and facilitated their travel to Yemen from Tunisia, via Oman.

The species is found in the deserts of Namibia and southern Angola. It is the type species and most common member of the genus Rhoptropus. Description The Namib day gecko has a maximum snout-to-vent length of about . The dorsal surface is a well-camouflaged, dappled greyish-brown with small, rounded scales. The throat and the undersides of the tail and the limbs are bright yellow, the tail being \\"flashed\\" at other geckos as a signal. This gecko has long legs and long digits, apart from the abbreviated inner toe. The tips of the digits are flared, and the underside of the central digit has five or six scansors (specialist structures that help a gecko's feet to adhere to almost any surface). Distribution and habitat This gecko is endemic to southwestern Africa, where its range includes southern Angola and northern Namibia. It is adapted to desert life and is found in a range of habitats both on the Atlantic coast and many kilometres inland. Ecology The Namib day gecko is a diurnal species and feeds mostly on ants and beetles. On hot but breezy days, it may cool itself by climbing onto an elevated perch and raising itself high off the hot rock surface, orientating itself in such a way as to minimize its exposure to the sun. Geckos have highly sensitive colour night- vision capabilities. Geckos in the genus Rhoptropus are diurnal; their ancestors were nocturnal, but they have secondarily returned to daytime activity. Compared to the other members of its genus, the Namib day gecko is a runner rather than a climber. It uses its speed to escape from potential predators, being able to sprint at up to per second in bright light. However, in dim light, such as experienced on foggy days on this coast, its maximum speed is significantly lower.

Toulorge was beatified on 29 April 2012 after Pope Benedict XVI confirmed that the late priest was killed \\"in odium fidei\\" ('in hatred of the faith'). Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the celebration on the pope's behalf in the Coutances Cathedral. Life Childhood and priesthood Pierre-Adrien Toulorge was born in the Kingdom of France on 4 May 1757 as the third child to Julien Toulorge and Julienne Hamel; his parents married on 9 November 1747. He was baptized mere hours after his birth by the parish curate Le Royer. He had at least one brother and one sister. His mother died on 8 May 1757 (and was buried in a church the next day) and in 1861 his father remarried to the widowed Marie Duprey. His father died on 31 March 1782. The assistant parish priest noticed his aspirations to enter the priesthood and took Toulorge under his wing and instructed him in Latin. He was later sent to school for his initial education. Toulorge was admitted to his studies for the priesthood - that the Eudists oversaw - where his superior was Jacques- Fran√ßois Lefranc. He underwent philosophical studies in 1777 and theological studies from 1778 until 1782. Toulorge received the tonsure and the minor orders on 12 June 1778 while being made a subdeacon on 23 September 1780 and being elevated to the diaconate on 8 May 1871. He was ordained as a priest in June 1782 and was made an assistant curate in Doville at the beginning of 1783. He often went to the Norbertine convent in Blanchelande and asked the prior to be admitted into the Premonstratensians; he commenced his novitiate in Beuport and in June 1788 returned to Blanchelande where he made his profession. The Revolution In 1790 officials during the French Revolution suppressed their branch of the order and he left on 11 October to live in a neighboring farm belonging to the Le Sens in La Cour until 1791. But he made a grave error in judgment: the banishment law affected him but he nevertheless obtained travelling papers and on 12 September 1791 travelled to the island of Jersey where he joined over 500 priests from the Coutances diocese where he lived a precarious existence of a penniless exile for five weeks. The error in judgment materialized when a confrere pointed out to him that leaving for the island painted him as a traitor to the revolution. Upon hearing this he rushed back to the mainland as soon as he could and hoped that his absence would not be noticed - he landed in secret at a beach in Cotentin and went underground from November 1792 until September 1783. He spent three weeks after his immediate return with his pastor cousin Jean-Nicolas Toulorge. He spent that time in hiding from place to place in disguise and he both administered the sacraments in secret and celebrated Mass in homes in private. Masses were celebrated with makeshift vestments while he copied from the Roman Missal in order to celebrate Mass. Arrest and trial On the evening of 2 September 1793 - close to the village of Saint-Nicolas-de-Pierrepont - a woman saw a man emerge from a thicket and invited him into her home and lit a fire for him; Toulorge revealed himself to the woman who then revealed herself to be the Benedictine nun Sister Saint-Paul and Toulorge accepted her invitation to spend the night at the house. The nun - the next morning - led Toulorge out in disguise as a woman to the home of her friend Marotte Fosse thinking he would be much safer there. But workers along the path - seeing an unfamiliar woman - noticed his men's stockings and shoes and so followed the two to Marotte's door and went to inform the authorities. Toulorge rested in the attic of the home when three guards knocked on the door so hard the door itself shook: \\"Open in the name of the law!\\" Toulorge froze as a guard bought Fosse from work to open the door. The house was ransacked as the priest hid under bundles of flax and he managed to elude bayonets that stabbed the piles. The soldiers were about to leave muttering to themselves when one went back and noticed the priest coming out of his hiding place. Toulorge was arrested on the spot and all he had with him - such as his vestments - were seized. On 4 September 1793 he was taken to the director of the Carentan district to be put on trial and hid the fact that he had left the mainland in order to avoid the death sentence. Commissioner Le Canut for the prosecution hoped to get Toulorge to contradict himself and asked him: \\"Have you ever - at this time or at any other - gone to Jersey or to any other foreign land?\\" to which the priest replied: \\"No\\". Le Canut instead fabricated the fact that a priest he interrogated had said he had seen Toulorge on the island which prompted Toulorge to state: \\"I have never left French soil and if others have told you I have they are either mistaken or crazy. Instead the prosecution showed him the seized objects from the Fosse home and the priest admitted to them belonging to him; the uncertain judges decided to send him to the departmental court in Coutances. In order to save his own life he continued to refuse mentioning that he left the mainland though when he returned to prison he felt a sense of guilt which prompted in him the desire to tell the truth. At dawn on 8 September 1793 he confessed the truth and - despite great exhaustion - appeared on 22 September before an administrative commission where he was interrogated on his trip to the island. The priest was then sent to a criminal court that the Jacobin judge Gilbert-Fran√ßois Loisel presided over and the judge tried to save Toulorge's life after suggesting that the priest retract his confession and allude to mentioning he spent time someplace in France. Records of 12 October 1793 - when the death sentence was handed down - described aspects of the trial. Toulorge exclaimed \\"Deo Gratias\\" when the verdict was handed down and people around him as he was escorted back to prison believe he had been acquitted. When the evening came he dined and then went to make a confession and later wrote three letters - one to his brother. He returned to the cell he shared with fellow prisoners when one asked: \\"So what's the news?\\" and he said: \\"Good news - my case was decided in my favor!\\" leading to his companions believing he was acquitted and would soon be set free. However he was quick to reveal that the death sentence without appeal was the decision made and the happiness turned to sadness as Sister Saint-Paul - who was also arrested around the same time he was - wept which prompted the priest to tell her: \\"Madame - the tears you are shedding are unworthy of me ... Let us show that faith is victorious over torture and open a path of Heaven amidst the final efforts of hell\\". Death Toulorge asked for his hair to be cut and his beard to be shaved for his execution. He was present with his companions and stopped before the canticle for compline and said: \\"Soon I will sing this thanksgiving canticle in Heaven\\". He blessed his companions when the authorities arrived and he travelled to the guillotine on foot and spoke for the last time: \\"My God I place my soul in Your hands. I ask that You reestablish and preserve Your Holy Church. I beg You to forgive my enemies.\\" He was executed at 2:00pm and the executioner grabbed the head by the hair and showed it to the crowds. Sister Saint-Paul was acquitted and survived the Terror. His remains were dumped in a mass grave. His face was uncovered and faced west. He was reburied in 1804. He is a relative of Father Adrien Toulorge (1882-1916). Beatification The beatification process opened in an informative process in 1922 that halted in 1928 due to interruptions that rendered the cause inactive until he was made a Servant of God under Pope John Paul II on 24 April 1995 when the Congregation for the Causes of Saints gave the \\"nihil obstat\\" ('nothing against') to the cause; the diocesan process spanned from 1 December 1995 until 29 July 1996 and received C.C.S. validation on 8 May 1998. The Positio dossier was sent to the C.C.S. in Rome in 1999 and a board of historians met and approved the cause on 5 December 2000 while deeming no historical obstacles existed in opposition to the cause; theologians voiced their approval on 13 July 2010 while the C.C.S. also voted in favor of the cause on 1 March 2011. Pope Benedict XVI confirmed that Toulorge died in hatred of his faith on 2 April 2011 which would pave the path for his beatification. Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the beatification on the behalf of Benedict XVI on 29 April 2012 in the Coutances Cathedral. The current postulator for this cause is the Rev. Gabriel Wolf.

In oil on canvas, it measures . Since the 1620s it has been in the Royal Collection of the United Kingdom, and in 2019 it hung in the King's Gallery in Kensington Palace, London.RC The degree of finish varies considerably between different parts of the painting, which with the intense colours and dramatic contrasts in lighting, is characteristic of Venetian painting. The orange-yellow pigment orpiment in the robe of the king has altered; it would originally have matched the biblical description of his splendid gold robe.Whitaker and Clayton, 224‚Äì226; RC The painting is dated, largely on stylistic grounds, to about 1546‚Äì47, relatively early in Tintoretto's career, when he was still in his late twenties. It comes shortly before his first major commission, Saint Mark Rescuing the Slave, now in the Accademia, Venice.Whitaker and Clayton, 224 The incident The account of the episode including Esther's fainting comes only from the Greek additions to the Book of Esther, or \\"Rest of Esther\\",The Anglican title in the Thirty-Nine Articles and Authorized Version. which are Deuterocanonical books, regarded as canonical by the Catholic Church, though relegated to the Biblical apocrypha by Protestant churches. In the Hebrew Bible and Protestant bibles there is no fainting in the Book of Esther; in the latter the additions made in the Septuagint are relegated to the Rest of Esther placed at the end of the book. The decree at the Catholic Council of Trent confirming their canonical status was passed in April 1546, around the time this painting is thought to have been made, which may have a bearing on the choice of subject. The painting shows the moment from Chapter 9:6‚Äì8, when Esther goes to see her husband, King Ahasuerus of Persia (often identified as the historical Xerxes I), to intercede for the Jewish people; going into the inner royal court uninvited is punishable by death:Authorized Version > 6 Then having passed through all the doors, she stood before the king, who > sat upon his royal throne, and was clothed with all his robes of majesty, > all glittering with gold and precious stones; and he was very dreadful. 7 > Then lifting up his countenance that shone with majesty, he looked very > fiercely upon her: and the queen fell down, and was pale, and fainted, and > bowed herself upon the head of the maid that went before her. 8 Then God > changed the spirit of the king into mildness, who in a fear leaped from his > throne, and took her in his arms, till she came to herself again, and > comforted her with loving words.... Tintoretto self-portrait, c. 1548, Victoria & Albert Museum. Esther's faint had not often been depicted in art before Tintoretto, although for example it is shown in the series of cassone scenes of the Life of Esther by Sandro Botticelli, from the 1470s. Esther was regarded in Catholic theology as a typological forerunner of the Virgin Mary; among other reasons,Baskins gives a long account, partly disputed here. because both acted as intercessors,Bergsma, John, Pitre, Brant, A Catholic Introduction to the Bible: The Old Testament, Ignatius Press, 2018, , 9781642290486 Google Books and because Esther being allowed an exception to the strict Persian law on uninvited entry to the king's presence was seen as paralleling the unique Immaculate Conception of Mary. Contemporary viewers would probably have recognised a similarity between the faint and the motif of the Swoon of the Virgin, which was very common in depictions of the Crucifixion of Jesus.Whitaker and Clayton, 224 The fainting became a much more popular subject in the Baroque painting of the following century, with examples including the Esther before Ahasuerus by Artemisia Gentileschi. Changes to the composition The composition has seen a number of changes, the earliest by Tintoretto himself, to the figures behind the king. What appears now probably represents Tintoretto's initial intention, but in the course of painting he abandoned the two figures standing behind the king, a tall twisting one with a long scarf who was presumably Haman, and what is now a very dim outline of a turbaned companion. Instead Tintoretto overpainted these with a boy in armour. This stage can be seen in a workshop copy in El Escorial,image and a print made in 1712 after the Royal Collection painting. The Escorial version also extends the composition to both sides, and very slightly at the top and bottom, adding one and a half figures at the right, and showing the full leg and foot of the boy with a dog at left.Whitaker and Clayton, 224; RC It appears that at this stage the group of rather distant background figures to the right of the king were added; these appear to be Haman and his companion, with similar scarf and turban to their overpainted figures, standing with soldiers carrying banners.Whitaker and Clayton, 224; RC At some point after this a restorer removed the boy in armour, probably damaging the turbaned man. The figures revealed were perhaps thought unsatisfactory, so either this or another restorer re-added the boy in armour, though the new figure was \\"clearly of inferior quality\\". This stage can be seen in old photographs. In 1950 a proposal by the restorer Sebastian Isepp to remove the new boy in armour was agreed, leaving the figures as they now appear. Haman is therefore depicted twice in the painting as it appears now.Whitaker and Clayton, 224; RC Provenance The painting's original owner is unknown. It would probably have been made for a secular setting, despite the religious subject. It is recorded in the inventory of the collection of Guglielmo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua in 1627 as hanging alongside The Muses in a passage in the Palazzo Ducale in Mantua. It was acquired from the Gonzaga collection by Charles I of Great Britain. On his execution it was valued at ¬£120 and sold, before being reacquired by the royal family on the Restoration.RC Notes References *Baskins, Cristelle L., \\"Typology, sexuality and the Renaissance Esther\\", Chapter 2 in Sexuality and Gender in Early Modern Europe: Institutions, Texts, Images, Ed.

Life Osoro was born in Casta√±eda in northern Spain on in 1945. He studied at the Escuela Normal and taught in Santander where its bishop Juan Antonio de Val Gallo ordained him in 1973. He was the vicar general for Santander from 1976 until 1994. He received his episcopal consecration in 1997 when he was named the Bishop of Orense. Osoro became the Archbishop of Oviedo in 2002 and Archbishop of Valencia in 2009. Pope Francis named him as the Archbishop of Madrid in August 2014. Osoro Sierra is considered to be an orthodox prelate known for his pastoral sensitivities. Pope Francis announced that he would elevate Osoro Sierra to the rank of cardinal on 19 November 2016, where he was made Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Trastevere. Francis made him a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education on 23 December 2017. Pope Francis has referred to Osoro Sierra as \\"Don Carlos the pilgrim\\", alluding to the cardinal's frequent walks around his archdiocese during which he mingles with the people to get to know them better. He has made religious vocations one of his chief priorities and in Valencia the number of seminarians grew from 51 in 2012 to 61 in 2013 due to his efforts. Upon his arrival in Madrid he planned to launch a diocesan plan for evangelization in order to reach out to those cut off from the Church and to renew vigor in the Christian faith. He invites adolescents to join him at the start of each month for a vigil in which to dialogue with them to understand their needs and concerns and he often celebrates Mass in prisons. Osoro Sierra also visited cloistered convents when he arrived in Madrid. Osoro Sierra was once asked whether he would define himself as a liberal or conservative prelate. But he insisted that he was \\"a man of the Church\\" and not one of labels which seek to distract the Church's work. Despite some news reports in April 2016 that Osoro had prohibited Cardinal Gerhard M√ºller from discussing his book at a Madrid college because Osoro deemed it \\"against the pope\\", Osoro welcomed M√ºller to a discussion of the book on 3 May at the Universidad Francisco de Vitoria, a Roman Catholic university in Madrid.

Germany was the first country to provide free legal aid representation for the poor in 1919, and represents the archetype of the so-called judicare system. Legal aid in civil and other non-criminal cases Legal aid can be provided in civil (which includes family law), administrative, labour, social welfare and even constitutional disputes before courts if a party is not in a position to pay court and counsel fees.See sec. 114 of the German civil procedure code (ZPO) Legal aid is provided by exemption from court costs and payment of counsel fees from the state budget upon decision by the court. The amount provided in legal aid cases paid to the lawyer is regulated in a statutory fee schedule but considerably lower than counsel could normally claim pursuant to the regular fee table from a client who is not entitled to legal aid. The German Code of Civil Procedure provided a subsection entitled \\"the right of the poor\\" (in German: (Armenrecht) to which on 1st January 1980 it was added the first German law of the public funding for the coverage of legal expenses related the access to the judicial protection and the conducting of the process. The granting of legal aid by the court requires that the applicant proves that the claimant is (a) economically not able to bear the costs of the procedures, and (b) that his lawsuit has reasonable prospects of success, and (c) that the cause of action is not frivolous.Sec. 114 para. 1 ZPO The application for legal aid is typically lodged together with the draft of the complaint with the bench of the competent court. This has the advantage for the legal aid applicant that he is provisionally relieved of the payment of the court costs while the bench not only reviews his economic status but also determines the merits of the case, i.e. as to whether the lawsuit appears to have reasonable prospect of success, based merely on the facts and arguments as presented in the draft complaint. Thus, a summary review of the cause of action is carried out by the court. Only if all conditions are met and legal aid thus granted will the court communicate the complaint to the other party and the judicial dispute thereby commences with the costs borne by the court. However, the legal aid seeking litigant can also lodge effectively the complaint together with auxiliary legal aid request but without making the pendency of the case dependent on the court granting legal aid; or the litigant requests legal aid support at a later stage but before completion of case procedures. In the latter scenarios, if legal aid is rejected by the court the litigant, who sought legal aid, will bear the counsel and court fees if he loses the lawsuit (or bears the costs partially if he loses partially). Defence cases are treated equivalently. The German judicare system leads to the review of legal aid cases on indigence and their merits first by the lawyers in private practice, then the courts, while averting dependence on external legal aid institutions removed from the judicial process. Another element of strength lies in the system‚Äôs low cost.Schlesinger, The German Alternative, p. 215 Altogether smaller amounts of state budgets are provided for legal aid per capita compared with other European countries.Barendrecht, Legal Aid in Europe, p. 49-54 To secure receiving their fees through legal aid, lawyers‚Äô drafted briefs must have arguable merit thereby ensuring the high quality of representation of indigents. Substandard performance of lawyers is therefore not an option. The German model is also considered to put the indigent litigant on genuine equality with a wealthy litigant.Schlesinger, The German Alternative, p. 217 The indigent has the same right to choose her lawyer as a more affluent person. The lawyer representing the indigent is naturally motivated to win the case since as a victorious party he is entitled to recover the full lawyer‚Äôs fees, i.e. not just the reduced legal aid fees, from the party that loses the case.Schlesinger, The German Alternative, p. 216 The loser-pays-all system constitutes an incentive for lawyers to represent indigent clients. The recovery of the legal costs represent the assumption of a significant risk and an incentive to give away any access to the judicial protecton. It happens for parties that don't have liquid properties to be valued and even for those who have a prevalent likelihood to win the proceedings. Legal aid in criminal procedures In criminal procedures, the court assigns an accused with a defence counsel in so-called ‚Äúnecessary defence‚ÄùSee section 140 (1) of the German Code of Criminal Procedure cases if the accused has not already retained a lawyer. In practice, however, usually the court appoints the lawyer which the accused had already chosen for his mandatory representation. Necessary defence means that the accused is charged with a felony that is punishable by a minimum sentence of one year‚Äôs imprisonment, is tried before a higher court, already is detained on remand or otherwise not considered able to defend himself.Section 140 (1) CCP The entitlement of an accused to have counsel assigned to him in cases of mandatory legal representation is irrespective of indigence.Brodowski et al., Effective Criminal Defence in Europe, p. 11 The court-assigned defence lawyer is entitled to claim his fees from the state budget. Like in civil proceedings, however, the legal aid fees are lower than fees the lawyer could otherwise claim from the client. Every lawyer can be appointed by the court as a public defender scheme does not exist in Germany.Brodowski et al., Effective Criminal Defence in Europe, p. 10 If the accused loses the case, i.e. he becomes a convict, the court imposes the court fees and the costs of defence on the defendant. After conviction, the court-appointed lawyer can choose whether to execute his claim against his convicted client or against the treasury. Normally, if his client is indigent, the lawyer will seek payment from the solvent debtor, the state.Brodowski et al., Effective Criminal Defence in Europe, p. 12 If a case does not require ‚Äúnecessary defence‚Äù, an accused, who cannot pay a lawyer, is not entitled to be provided with counsel paid by the state but must defend himself.

It refers to the court case itself, and the circumstances surrounding abortion for fatal foetal abnormalities in Ireland. In 2002 Deirdre Conroy discovered her pregnancy was non-viable and had a termination in Northern Ireland. A public letter, written using a pseudonym, asking for it to be legal was credited with influencing the 2002 abortion referendum. She lost a court case in the ECHR in 2006 because she had not exhausted all domestic remedies. In 2013 after the death of Savita Halappanavar, she came forward, revealed her identity and again asked for this sort of termination to be legal. Initial letter In January 2002, Deirdre Conroy was 39, the mother of two boys aged 10 and 12, and expecting twins. At 14 weeks pregnant, the initial results of an amniocentesis test revealed one of the twins had died. Three weeks later, full test results revealed the second twin had Edwards syndrome, a condition which usually ends in miscarriage or death shortly after birth because of heart abnormalities, kidney malformations, and other internal organ disorders. In the run up to the Twenty-fifth Amendment Referendum, in February 2002, she wrote an open letter to The Irish Times newspaper, using the pseudonym Deirdre de Barra, telling of her case, and asking for termination for fatal foetal abnormalities to be legalised in Ireland. David Norris supported termination for FFA in that case. Terminations for fatal foetal abnormalities were not covered by the Twenty-fifth Amendment referendum, and would have remained illegal regardless of the outcome of that vote. The letter was credited with playing a part in the defeat of the Twenty- fifth Amendment referendum. She later travelled to Northern Ireland for a termination. The Irish hospital would not give her a referral letter, and her doctors were very guarded when discussing abortion with her. Court Case D's claim D complained about the need to travel abroad to have an abortion in the case of a lethal foetal abnormality and about the restrictions for which the 1995 Act provided. She expressly confined her complaint to the situation of a fatal foetal diagnosis, considering that her tragic situation was exacerbated by the above-noted limitations. She invoked Articles 3, 8 and 10 of the Convention. She further complained under Article 14 that she was discriminated against as a pregnant woman or as a pregnant woman with a lethal foetal abnormality: a person with a serious medical problem would never have encountered such difficulties in obtaining medical care and advice. Ireland's claim =Domestic Remedies= The Government maintained that, as soon as the diagnosis of Trisomy 18 was confirmed, the applicant should have initiated an action in the High Court, pursued if unsuccessful to the Supreme Court, to obtain a declaration that Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution allowed an abortion in Ireland in the case of a fatal foetal abnormality together with the necessary ancillary mandatory order. =Possibly not illegal in Ireland= The Irish government maintained that termination for fatal foetal abnormalities might not be illegal, pointing to the X Case as proof that the Supreme Court could develop what \\"unborn\\" means Judgement The court dismissed the case, since D did not comply with the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies as regards the availability of abortion in Ireland in the case of fatal foetal abnormality. Later developments In 2013 after the death of Savita Halappanavar, Deirdre Conroy revealed herself as Deirdre de Barra of the original letter, and the D in D. v Ireland, and spoke publicly about her case, and her experiences. She requested to address the Oireachtas committee that was debating the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.

He has represented Britain at the Invictus Games, World and European Championships and in 2016 he was selected for the Summer Paralympics in Rio, winning a bronze medal in the 200m sprint (T42). Personal history Henson was born in Southampton, England in 1984. He was educated at St George Catholic College in Southampton before going to University of Hertfordshire to study mechanical engineering. After leaving university he joined the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst to undertake his initial training as an Army officer. He passed out of Sandhurst in 2008, joining the 22 Engineer Regiment as Second Lieutenant. In February 2010 Henson was moved to the bomb disposal unit of the Royal Engineers, before being deployed to Afghanistan in October. In Afghanistan part of his duties included the leadership of a detachment force clearing improvised explosive devices (IED). On 13 February 2011, Henson and his unit were clearing two compounds in the Nad-e Ali South area of Helmand Province when he stood on a hidden IED. Within 37 minutes of the incident he was on the operating table in Camp Bastion, before being flown back to England to receive treatment in Birmingham the following day. Following these life saving operations, Henson had his right leg amputated above the knee and his left leg amputated through the knee. This was followed by further operations and an extensive rehabilitation program at Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court, but within eight months he had been fitted with prosthetic legs and was walking again. Henson returned to education after his injuries and took a master's degree in Biomedical Engineering at Imperial College London, focusing on amputee biomechanics for the improvement of prosthetic limbs. Henson and his wife, Hayley, have a daughter. In 2014 he was awarded the MBE. Sports career During his rehabilitation, Henson found a passion for sport. He began taking part in open swim events for charity, he also participated in Wheelchair basketball and sitting volleyball. In 2012 he was selected to be captain of the British team in the inaugural Invictus Games. He entered three events, the sitting volleyball and the 100m and 200m ambulant IT2 sprints, winning gold in the 200m. After the Invictus Games, Henson continued to train as a parasport athlete under the guidance of Roger Keller. In 2015 he was selected to represent the Great Britain team at the IPC Athletics European Championships in Doha, competing in the 200 metres sprint. Although he did not medal at the games he was given the honour of being the flag bearer for the opening ceremony. The following year, in the build-up to the Rio Paralympics Henson travelled to Grosseto in Italy to compete for Britain at the 2016 IPC Athletics European Championships. He competed in both the 100m and 200m T42 events, taking the silver in the 200m, behind teammate Richard Whitehead, in a time of 25.89s. In July 2016 Henson again faced Whitehead at the London Grand Prix, finishing third with a new personal best of 25.05. A few days later, on 26 July, it was confirmed that he has made the Great Britain team for the 2016 Summer Paralympics. At the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio, Henson entered both the 100m and 200m sprints. In the heats of the 200m sprint he temporarily lost balance on his running blades, slipping into an outside track. Fortunately for Henson he did not impeded the other competitors and was able to recover and qualify for the final. The final saw Henson win a Paralympic bronze, after coming from the back of the field in the final 50 metres to power through the field to finish behind fellow British teammate Whitehead and South Africa's Ntando Mahlangu. In the 100 metres, as a double amputee, Henson was unable to hit his full pace, and finished fifth in the heats, failing to make the final.

The Anglo-French Financial Commission was a special delegation to the United States from the governments of the United Kingdom and France in 1915 during the First World War. The Commission, led by Lord Reading, secured the single largest loan from private US banks prior to American entry into World War I in 1917. History In February 1915, France, Britain and Russia held the first joint financial conference of the First World War.Kathleen Burk, Britain, America and the Sinews of War, 1914-1918 (G. Allen & Unwin, 1985), p.45. Thereafter, the Allied Powers agreed to cooperate closely in financial matters to help finance the ongoing war with Germany. In September 1915 France and the United Kingdom signed an agreement to establish the Inter-Allied Munitions Bureau, which was to coordinate purchasing in all neutral countries, principally the United States. That same month Lord Reading lead a delegation from the two countries to secure a huge loan from private American banks, the source of the greatest amount of private capital outside Europe. The Commission included Basil Blackett, Sir Edward Holden and Sir Henry Babington Smith from Britain, and Octave Homberg and Ernest Mallet from France. In addition to the financial support, it was hoped that a large investment by Americans in the Allied war effort would encourage Woodrow Wilson's administration to abandon neutrality.T. Cushing Daniel, Real Money Versus False Money - Bank Credits (The Minerva Group, Inc., 2004), p.272-3 The group arrived in New York on 10 September, and were met by J. P. Morgan Jr., who had been designated as Britain's sole purchasing agent in the United States in January 1915, and Britain's ambassador, Sir Cecil Spring Rice. Over the course of the following weeks, the Commission had meetings with approximately one hundred prominent American financiers and bankers, including Charles G. Dawes. Several Jewish financial houses stated they would not participate if Russia, the location of recent anti-Jewish pogroms, was included in the agreement.Richard Drake, The Education of an Anti-Imperialist: Robert La Follette and U.S. Expansion (University of Wisconsin Press, 2013), p.149. On 28 September 1915 it was announced that the syndicate, led by J.P. Morgan & Co., had reached a credit agreement with the British and French governments. The loan was for $500,000,000, at that point by far the largest single loan in financial history. The loan was issued on five-year, 5 per cent joint British and French bonds, and was entirely controlled by banking corporations for private gain. Prior to the loan being secured, German agents and sympathisers in the United States endeavoured to prevent an agreement. On 16 September American press reported that the lives of the Commission's delegates had been threatened by German plots, and that pro-Germans were threatening to \\"cause a run on the banks throughout the United States if any support is accorded to the Allies\\".Anglo-French Financial Commission, Hawera & Normanby Star, Volume LXIX, ISSUE 0, 16 September 1915 (Retrieved 27 July 2016). On 18 September The Spectator reported that the Germans were attempting to influence American depositors and the directors of major banks, and were trying to arrange a counter-loan of $100,000,000 to Germany to embarrass the negotiations. The US government, under pressure from Spring Rice and still officially neutral, stated that it regarded the loan as an ordinary financial transaction and that it would not interfere in the process. American press generally supported the loan, and The New York Times decried opponents of the agreement as \\"anti-American\\".Richard Drake, The Education of an Anti- Imperialist: Robert La Follette and U.S. Expansion (University of Wisconsin Press, 2013), p.147. Financier James J. Hill hailed the loan as marking the moment that America changed \\"from being a debtor to a creditor nation\\". German efforts to influence the proceedings proved to be fruitless. In May 1916 the British had to take over the financing of French purchases in the United States as a result of the weakness of the French wartime economy.Kathleen Burk, Britain, America and the Sinews of War, 1914-1918 (G.

She was damaged and sunk by soldiers of the United Colonies during the Siege of Fort St. Jean and later raised and repaired after the fort was captured. Design Royal Savage was estimated to be long and wide and measured 70 tons. She was armed with eight 4-pounder guns, four 6-pounder guns, and ten swivel guns. Royal Savage had a crew of 40 to 50 men. Service history Siege of Fort St. Jean Royal Savage, a two-masted schooner, was damaged and sunk by American forces under Richard Montgomery during the siege of St. Johns (St. Jean-Iberville), Quebec, in the fall of 1775. Raised and repaired after the capture of that fort on 2 November, she, with the small schooner and the sloop (ex-HMS George III), formed the nucleus of the American Lake Champlain squadron. That squadron, under Benedict Arnold, denied the British the use of the lake during the fall of 1776 and thus contributed to Burgoyne's defeat at Saratoga. Summer 1776 In June 1776, the American force, pushed from Canada, fell back to Crown Point, Skenesborough, and Fort Ticonderoga. There Arnold pressed his force to complete a shipbuilding program before the British completed their squadron. In late August, 10 of his ships were finished and he moved north with Royal Savage as his flagship. Into September he scouted the lakeshore. On 23 September he moved his fleet into an anchorage at Valcour Island, separated from the western shore by a half-mile channel, to await the remainder of his squadron, and the British. With the arrival of the galley , Arnold shifted his headquarters to that boat, and continued to wait. Battle of Valcour Island On 11 October the north wind carried the British past the island. American ships, including Royal Savage, appeared; fired on the enemy, and beat back into the southern entrance to the channel, where the remainder of Arnold's force was positioned to meet the enemy, beat him if possible, but, at all cost, to delay him. Coming in from the south, the British force was handicapped by the wind. Arnold's planning and the British acceptance of the bait had given the Americans a chance to carry out their mission. Royal Savage, however, ran aground on the southwest point of Valcour Island around 11 am when attempting to return to the American line, and, undefendable, was abandoned. Despite attempts to reboard her, she was taken by a British boarding party which turned her guns against the American fleet. They too, however, soon found themselves under considerable fire and had to abandon Royal Savage. The British didn't want to give the Americans an opportunity to retake Royal Savage so they set fire to her sometime after dark. This, though, led to unintentionally helping the American fleet escape in the night. With the fire burning all night she was able to provided for a magnificent distraction. Combined with a moonless night, the ammunition blowing up and staring at the fire, the British were unable to see the American fleet slip away. Preservation The ship remained in the lake until it was raised in 1934 by marine salvor and amateur archaeologist Lorenzo Hagglund. According to Art Cohn, Hagglund's family held onto the remains of the ship and associated artifacts until being purchased by the city of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in 1995. The remains were sold to Harrisburg for $42,500 with the plan of five museums being created in the city. The ship had no connections to either the city of Harrisburg or the state of Pennsylvania, but with plans of revolving displays that would cover different periods of history the then mayor, Stephen R. Reed was able to rationale the purchase. However, only two of the planned six museums opened and the plans to display Royal Savage stalled with the remains being pilled up in the corner of one of the city garages. In October 2013 the city council tried to recoup some of the city's money by auctioning off the remains of Royal Savage. They had already auctioned off some other artefacts in 2006 that had an American West connection in Dallas, Texas. The pre-auction estimates for Royal Savage ranged between $20,000 and $30,000. This fell well below the $42,500 that had been paid for her in 1995. The starting bid was set at $10,000 but she was only able to bring $5,000. However, in the end the bidder decided not to take possession of Royal Savage and Harrisburg retained ownership. In July 2015 the city of Harrisburg was formally presented with the remains of Royal Savage. Mayor Eric Papenfuse presided over the event in which Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC) Director Sam Cox accepted the artefacts on behalf of the Navy: > This ship, and its artifacts are now going to be preserved and cherished for > the public for generations to come as they should be. For the last 20 years, > the artifacts have stayed in storage, out of public viewing, and we are > pleased today to bring them to the light of day and to make sure they are > being given the proper care.

D. Kumaraswamy under his banner Channambika Films and directed by Mahadev. It features Nikhil Gowda, who is the son of the producer H. D. Kumaraswamy, and Deepti Sati in the lead roles, while Tamannaah made a debut in Kannada- language and was seen in an Item number. The music was composed by S. Thaman, and the fight scenes were choreographed by Ram-Lakshman masters. The film was released worldwide on 6 October 2016 and was dubbed into Hindi under the same title.  Plot  The movie opens with a lawyer suggesting his friend over the phone to watch \\"SS News Channel\\" to watch a live murder being shown. He cuts the call, saying that he will call after watching the murder and switches to that channel, when the power is cut. He commands a computer repairman who had come to repair his PC to check out what happened to the power and tells him to turn it on when lightning strikes and the repairman's face is shown. The repairman (Nikhil Kumar) then reveals that he is the one who hacked the channel and put that notification there and tells the lawyer that he is the one who is going to die and eventually manages to kill him while broadcasting it through a drone camera and escapes after defeating all of the security guards. The next day, a CBI officer (Jagapathi Babu) arrives to solve the case and names the case and the killer as Jaguar. The next day, there is an speech ceremony by SS Medical College's topper Arya (Aadarsh Balakrishna), who gets elected as the student leader and vows that there will be no ragging in the college hereafter and proceeds to welcome the first years. One of the first years happens to be Krishna (Nikhil Kumar) or \\"SS Krishna\\", as he likes to call himself, and stages a drama saying that ragging is essential to a college since it bridges the senior-junior gap and provides a platform for juniors to display their talents, to which the rest of the first years agree. Krishna then walks towards Arya and tells him that he will go after his sister Priya (Deepti Sati) next and bets that he will make her fall in love with him to which Arya's friend, who is apparently in love with Priya, gets enraged and is about to attack Krishna when Arya prevents him, saying that his sister is not that innocent. The next day, Krishna follows Priya, gets a pizza, and proposes to her friend (Vidyullekha Raman), to which Priya gets enraged and tells that she knows his techniques and that she will not fall for him. Krishna then acts like crying and leaves the place while the other girls tell Priya to apologize. The next day, Krishna makes fun of Priya in class and also teases Arya. Priya later reciprocates his love after he treats a poor man, which was impossible, and gives the credit to Arya. Later, Krishna murders a police officer in same way. It is later revealed that Krishna is the son of Dr. Ramachandra (Rao Ramesh), a person who cared for poors and was cheated in the name of sexual harassment by Sreekar Prasad and Somnath Prasad (Sampath Raj and Adithya Menon), for which he committed suicide. His mother (Ramya Krishna) then looked after him. Finally, Krishna kills both the villains (Sreekar and Somnath) and reconciles with his mother, Priya (who had left him thinking that he will leave her for money), and Arya, who now accepts to give Priya to him.

It is the most well-known of a number of former local practises, such as the Ulster CustomJournal of Proceedings of the Agricultural Economics Society, v1-10, 122 and North Lincolnshire Custom.Currie, The Economic Theory of Agricultural Land Tenure, p.77 The underlying principle of such customs was that the tenant could be granted compensation for any improvements they made to the land they leased, since the common law did not provide any such protection. Principles Greenhouses near Bretforton. The Vale of Evesham is noted for a long history of market gardening. Local customs supplementary to the usual law of leases, such as the Evesham Custom, were seen as having existed over generations in particular areas, being defined as something \\"to which the memory of man runneth not to the contrary\\". In the case of Evesham, the custom provided not only a lifetime security of tenure (in a period when market garden leases were generally from year to year, traditionally renewable at Michaelmas) and allowed certain improvements to be made without the landlord's permission, but also ensured that a tenant could be compensated through a system of personal bargaining. A tenant of a market garden, or other land, under the Evesham Custom has the right to sell their tenancy if the landlord gives their approval, including the right to nominate the new tenant. The payment (known as the \\"ingoing\\")Sparrow, T. The Evesham Custom, accessed 27-07-16 made by the incoming tenant includes compensation for any improvements the outgoing tenant has made, such as the planting of fruit trees. The payment also includes a premium for receiving a tenancy offering lifetime security. The entire transaction is made between the outgoing and incoming tenant, with the landlord not involved beyond giving their approval. Furthermore, if the landlord does not accept the new tenant, they are obliged to compensate the outgoing tenant to ensure they did not suffer any financial loss. This \\"added value\\" had the effect of encouraging tenants to further improve their land, by ensuring that they could still realise the full value of the improvements they made if they ended their tenancy. Through this compensation payment and by giving security of tenure, the Custom also gave tenants confidence to invest in crops, like asparagus, that took several years to reach maturity. From the larger landowner's perspective, the Custom removed from the landlord the trouble and expense of making improvements themselves and the need to negotiate the tenancies of many small garden plots. The Custom helped ensure that Evesham developed a flourishing market gardening industry by the late 19th century, with the price of the tenantright under the Custom often exceeding the freehold value of the land itself.Sidwell, R. \\"A Short History of Commercial Agriculture in the Vale of Evesham\\", Vale of Evesham Historical Society Research Papers, 1969, 2, 43-51 History Evesham has a long history of market gardening activity, with some evidence that it was first popularised in the mid 17th century by the activities of a local landowner, Francis Bernadi (former Resident for the Republic of Genoa). By the early 19th century there were a number of gardeners and fruit growers in the Vale. The Custom first appeared in this period, though it was initially understood to be of the nature of a gentlemen's agreement and the landlord had no legal obligation to accept it. Pressure to formalise the customary rights of Evesham's market gardeners increased after an 1870s legal dispute between the owner of land near Evesham Abbey and his tenants, and the basic principles of the Custom were first set down by a special committee of the Vale of Evesham Agricultural Society in 1880.Robinson, G. Late Victorian Agriculture in the Vale of Evesham, 1976, p.18 Although definite records of the Evesham Custom first appear in the early-mid 19th century, some commentators in the past have assumed that the rights originated from \\"some earlier epoch\\".Martin, J. M. \\"The Social and Economic Origins of the Vale of Evesham Market Gardening Industry\\", The Agricultural History Review, v.33 (1985), 46 The ruralist writer H. J. Massingham, who was familiar with the operation of the Custom, expressed a belief that the tenant rights of Evesham were a direct descendant of those of the \\"small masters\\" who from the early mediaeval period practised cultivation in open fields owned by the Abbey.Massingham, H. J. \\"Cottagers\\" in Distributist Perspectives, vII, 2008 Massingham commented that after the 1874 agricultural depression, the area's large landlords split their farms up and let smaller parcels of land to labourers who were protected by the survival of ancient customary rights and by the local influence of Joseph Arch. J. M. Martin has noted that an \\"archaic\\" form of life leasehold was practised in Pershore by the estates of the Duke of Westminster, where wills of the 18th century spoke of a \\"tenant right of renewing\\", and that a similarly archaic form of copyhold tenure was found in Shipston-on-Stour on land belonging to the Dean and Chapter of Worcester. Both had survived in areas where large estates had to manage many small tenancies, as in Evesham, and it is possible that a similar local tradition was the source of the rights enjoyed by the Vale of Evesham's market gardeners. Another view states that the Custom originated on a single small estate at the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and subsequently spread throughout the district.Robinson, Agricultural Change, 1988, p.108 A certain amount of recognition was given by the Small Holdings and Allotments Act 1908, but the Evesham Custom was eventually given statutory expression in s.68 of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948, which granted tenant farmers security of tenure for life. There were proposals to abolish it in 1949, which generated protest from fruit growers and market gardeners, and which were not eventually followed through.The Fruit-Grower, Nov 3 1949, 761 The rights continued under the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986, but on the introduction of the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995, it was required to create a special exclusion to ensure the continued working of the Evesham Custom, as otherwise an outgoing tenant would not be able to offer a tenancy to an incomer on equivalent terms and security.Rodgers, C. Agricultural Law, Bloomsbury, 2015, p. 67 Present day Although the number of market gardens in the Vale of Evesham has declined sharply since the mid 20th century, the Evesham Custom is still observed in tenancies. In 1995, at the reading of the Agricultural Tenancies Bill, the local MP Michael Spicer observed that there were still around 420 tenants potentially affected, and noted that they could expect to realise \\"ingoing\\" payments of ¬£200-¬£300 an acre (at that time, 50% of the land's freehold value).Agricultural Tenancies Bill As market gardening has further declined it has become more common for landlords to take over the land at the end of tenancies, and by the mid 2000s, there was evidence that solicitors employed by some landlords were attempting to avoid the traditional operation of the Custom by making minimal compensation payments to outgoing tenants.Barnett, G. \\"Richard delves into threatened Custom\\", Evesham Journal, 15 Jan 2004 See also *Market garden *Allotment (gardening) *Smallholding *History of English land law References English property law Land tenure Urban agriculture Horticulture and gardening ","title":"Evesham Custom"},{"id":"51176559","title":"Mand Sangojla"},{"id":"51176570","text":"The Fellowship of the British Academy consists of world-leading scholars and researchers in the humanities and social sciences, A varying number of fellows are elected each year in July at the Academy's annual general meeting. 2019 The 2019 annual general meeting was held on 19 July 2019.

He is an investment banker and entrepreneur and was the co-founder of online food ordering platform Foodpanda. He is also the founder of omni-channel payments platform PayLo.  Education and early career  Chadda graduated from Delhi Technological University (formerly Delhi College of Engineering) with a degree in computer engineering and worked as a software engineer for Computer Sciences Corporation. In 2007 he joined Indian Institute of Management Calcutta to do his MBA after which he worked at Merrill Lynch as an Investment Banker in United Kingdom. He took an internal transfer to India in 2011. Career  Foodpanda Chadda began his career in 2012 when he co-founded foodpanda. foodpanda expanded to around 40 countries before being bought by Delivery Hero. Before foodpanda got popular, he joked that he delivered pizza for a living. foodpanda had raised a total investment of over US$100 million till August 2014. Chadda in the middle of 2015 stepped down from day-to-day responsibilities at Foodpanda and was no longer a managing director. Foodpanda was acquired by its global competitor Delivery Hero in 2016. Paylo In 2015, he launched a multi-channel offline payments platform PayLo which acquired the in-restaurant payments app Ruplee in March 2016 for an undisclosed sum. PayLo was successful in the wake of demonetisation in India and expanded pan-India before being acquired by Immortal Technologies. Chadda believes that execution is more important than the idea to make a startup successful and the key challenge for experienced professionals to work in a startup environment is to unlearn what they have previously learned. PayLo acquired Ruplee before being itself acquired by Immortal Technologies. Zee Group On July 2, 2019, he was named CEO of digital publishing of Zee Group. Since 2017, he had led global product and strategy for Zee Group launching ZEE5, the flagship OTT of Zee Entertainment, across 170+ countries. Since June 2019, Zee Digital, the online arm of the Zee group, has registered the highest growth year-on-year among the top media publishers in India. Times Internet Limited, Network 18 Group, and India Today Group have grown by 45%, 21%, and 22% respectively from June 2020 over June 2019 while Zee Digital witnessed a growth of 123% over the same period. Zee Digital achieved its first milestone in September 2019 by crossing 100 million unique monthly visitors and was ranked 6th in the news and information category on ComScore India rankings at the time. Later in the month of March 2020 it crossed 150 million unique monthly visitors mark moving to 4th position. Further in May 2020 Zee Digital moved to 3rd position by crossing 185 million unique monthly visitors mark before finally ranking 2nd position in June 2020 in the ComScore rankings among all digital media groups in India. Chadda attributes the growth from rank 9 to rank 2 in one year to the data and technology driven approach to content and the focus on vernacular languages. Investing and speaking Chadda is a mentor at Esselerator, a Startup accelerator by Subhash Chandra Foundation. Esselerator is an initiative by Subhash Chandra, a billionaire Media baron, to promote and support tech entrepreneurs in domains like Media, Fintech and Education. Its powered by TiE Mumbai.

It was discovered in September 2015 along with other kinds of POS malware, such as NewPOSThings, BlackPOS, and Alina. There are two versions which have been released by the developer responsible: version 1.7 and version 2.0. CenterPOS 2.0 has similar functionality to CenterPOS version 1.7. The 2.0 variant of CenterPOS malware added some more effective features, such as the addition of a configuration file for storing information in its command and control server. Overview CenterPOS has been used to target retailers in order to illegally obtain payment card information using a memory scraper. It uses two distinct modes to scrape and store information: a \\"smart scan\\" and a \\"normal scan\\". At the normal scan mode, the malware looks at all of the processes on a device and determines which ones are not currently running processes, are not named \\"system\\", \\"system idle process\\" or \\"idle\\", and do not contain keywords such as Microsoft or Mozilla. If the process meets the criteria list, the malware will search all memory regions within the process, searching for credit card data with regular expressions in the regular expression list. In smart scan mode, the malware starts by performing a normal scan, and any process that has a regular expression match will be added to the smart scan list. After the first pass, the malware will only search the processes that are in the smart scan list. The malware contains functionality that allows cybercriminals to create a configuration file. Process Details CenterPOS malware searches for the configuration file that contains the C&C; information. If unable to find the configuration file, it asks for a password. If the password entered is correct, then it payloads the functions to create a configuration file. This malware is very different from other point of sale system malware in that it has a separate component called builder to create a payload. The CenterPOS malware looks for the credit and debit card information through smart scan mode and then encrypts all the scraped data using Triple DES encryption. Then the memory scraped data is sent to the operator of the malware through a separate HTTP POST request.

It is the seventh main entry in the Professor Layton series and follows a new protagonist, Katrielle Layton. It was released for Android, iOS, and the Nintendo 3DS, in 2017, and for the Nintendo Switch in Japan in 2018, and worldwide in 2019. A manga adaptation of the game drawn by Hori Oritoka began serialization on March 20, 2018, in Sh≈çgakukan's Ciao magazine, and an anime adaptation, Layton Mystery Tanteisha: Katori no Nazotoki File, began airing on Fuji TV and other channels in April 2018. The game centers on Katrielle Layton, the daughter of famous archaeologist and puzzle-solver Professor Hershel Layton. With the help of her assistant Ernest Greeves, she solves cases in and around London, alongside a talking dog that, for reasons unknown, only the two of them can understand. Unlike prior Layton games, Mystery Journey has no definitive overarching narrative, with most of its main narrative's premises existing as a basis for a set-up, and being left hanging by the game's conclusion. Overview Layton's Mystery Journey follows Professor Hershel Layton's daughter, Katrielle \\"Kat\\" Layton, who solves puzzles in her father's place alongside her talking dog Sherl and her friends Emiliana Perfetti and Ernest Greeves. When her father vanishes, Katrielle goes off in search of him, coming across various puzzles and mysteries along the way. Like previous games in the series, the game features various puzzles for the player to solve using the touchscreen as they explore the environment and progress through the game's story. Unlike previous Layton games, the game is split up into twelve distinct cases, with one overall theme, rather than one continuous story separated by chapters. Plot Private detective Katrielle Layton, daughter of the famous Professor Hershel Layton, awakens from a nightmare about her missing father, on the day of her detective agency's opening. The same day Katrielle and her assistant Ernest Greeves meet a talking dog that, for reasons unknown, cannot be understood by anyone else but them. The dog explains that he has amnesia, and that he wishes for them to solve the mystery of who he really is, and Katrielle creates the name Sherl O.C Kholmes for him. After solving the case of the disappearance of one of Big Ben's hour hands at the request of Inspector Hastings of Scotland Yard, Katrielle, Ernest and Sherl investigate and solve several other cases, most of them related to the \\"Seven Dragons\\", seven of the most rich and influential figures of London, with assistance of Hastings and Emiliana Perfetti, one of the Yard's profilers. Other cases include Hastings' request to look for a present to his wife on a holiday and solve a murder that Katrielle was wrongly accused of committing. In one occasion, Ernest also tells Sherl the story of how he and Katrielle met, when he was falsely accused of theft and she helped clear his name as well. In the final case of the game, Layton and the Seven Dragons are invited by the mysterious Lord Adamas to the abandoned mansion of Maximilian Richmond, a millionaire who died 10 years before. In the occasion, Adamas forces the Seven Dragons to sign a contract where they relinquish all their fortunes to him should they fail to solve a series of puzzles, or he will reveal a grave secret about them. Attending the event at Layton's stead, Katrielle accepts Adamas' request to oversee the dispute. All of the Dragons fail to solve the puzzles and accept defeat, until Katrielle discovers that Lord Adamas is no other than Ernest, whose true identity is Miles Richmond, Maximilian's grandson, who grew up with the false assumption that the Dragons betrayed and ruined their family, swearing to enact revenge on them. After the misunderstanding is cleared, Ernest reconciles with the Dragons and accepts Katrielle's request to keep working as her assistant. In the post-credits, Katrielle renews her vow to unlock the mystery of Sherl's true identity and discover the whereabouts of her father. Although she is no closer with the latter, she proclaims that she has solved the puzzle that her father left behind when he disappeared: \\"If you're not really my child, then who exactly are you?\\". Development Layton's Mystery Journey was developed by Level-5 and directed by Akihiro Hino, with character designs by Takuz≈ç Nagano and music by Tomohito Nishiura. The puzzles are designed by Kuniaki Iwanami, who replaced previous designer Akira Tago following his death in March 2016. The game's animated cutscenes were produced by A-1 Pictures. The game's more episodic and casual style came about due to the belief that the Layton series had strayed from its roots in recent entries, which featured \\"overblown\\" stories like saving the world, and the desire to bring the series back to its core principles. This resulted in the shift in protagonist from Hershel Layton to his daughter, Katrielle, as the development team felt that they \\"can't bring back a guy who's saved the world and have him go do things like find a missing cat\\". Additionally, Hino stated that because half of all the Professor Layton players are female, a female protagonist was chosen to appeal to them. The decision to release the game on both 3DS and mobile devices was in part due to a desire to appeal to a wider demographic that may not own game consoles, while at the same time not wanting to turn their backs on the \\"dedicated 3DS fans\\" of series. Rather than the mobile version being a port, or vice versa, the game was specifically developed for play on both the 3DS and mobile. The game was announced in July 2016 under the title Lady Layton: The Millionaire Ariadone's Conspiracy, but was renamed Layton's Mystery Journey in April 2017, as the developers wanted to give the game a grander image. It was released worldwide for iOS and Android devices on July 20, 2017, and for the Nintendo 3DS on the same date in Japan. The Nintendo 3DS version was released in North America and Europe on October 6, 2017. A Nintendo Switch version was released in Japan on August 9, 2018, and in North America and Europe on November 8, 2019.  Reception  The game received mixed reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Shaun Musgrave of TouchArcade gave the game five out of five stars, praising the series's smooth transition to mobile platforms, the \\"outstanding\\" presentation, the story and the puzzles. Game Informers Kyle Hilliard considered Katrielle a more enjoyable a protagonist over her father. However, he had issue with the game's narrative structure, considering the standalone nature of the cases to cause the finale to \\"fall flat\\", as well as the puzzles, which he considered to overall be mediocre, and to have some \\"frankly stupid solutions\\". Daan Koopman of Nintendo World Report gave the 3DS version of the game a 7.5 out of 10. He praised the game's colorful presentation, as well as the gameplay being as \\"entertaining as ever\\", although he felt that the puzzles were too easy compared to the prior entries. He also noted that the ability for the player to return to prior cases offered much extra content to players and helped the world of the game feel alive. He, however, was underwhelmed by the game's story due to its overarching plot being \\"sorely lacking\\", and felt that the \\"conclusion came out of left field\\". Adventure Gamers's Jack Allin felt as though the case structure made for accessible mobile and casual gaming, and was positive towards the \\"pitch-perfect voice acting\\", as well as the visuals, and the high quantity of puzzles. However, he considered there to be \\"too many duds in the puzzle pile\\", and that the backgrounds, characters, and music got repetitive and tiresome. He also felt that the \\"simplified case focus makes the story entirely forgettable\\". He gave the game 3 out of 5 stars. On the other hand, despite the simplified narrative style, GameCentral for Metro still considered there to be little fundamental change compared to the prior titles in the series, which offered very few new ideas. They also felt as though, \\"despite being its natural home, the 3DS offers no real advantage\\", pointing out the lack of 3D effects, which were present in previous titles. They also noted the prices for both versions, specifically that an ¬£18 price tag was something that \\"never worked\\" for mobile games, although they considered it to be \\"good value for money\\", especially given that free daily puzzles are being promised as downloadable content for up to a year after release. On the other hand, they considered the 3DS version being more than twice as expensive as the mobile version to be a negative, even with the costume sets, which were paid for DLC in the mobile version, being bundled into the retail release. Layton's Mystery Journey was the 29th best selling video game in the United Kingdom during the Nintendo 3DS version's European debut week, and the second best selling Nintendo 3DS game in the region after Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions. The game was nominated for \\"Game, Franchise Family\\" at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards.

Her investigation focused on computational astrophysics, stellar astrophysics and exoplanets and brown dwarfs, and the physical dynamics of interacting binary stars systems. However, her pioneering research in the tomography of interacting binary star systems and cataclysmic variable stars to predict magnetic activity and simulate gas flow is her most known work. In 1977, she graduated with the degree of BSc in Physics from the University of the West Indies. She then moved to Toronto, where two years later, in 1979, she received the MS in Space Science at York University, Toronto, and in 1986 she earned her PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics from the University of Toronto. She worked as president of Commission 42 of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) which deals with Close Binary Stars, was a member of the Board of Advisers of the Caribbean Institute of Astronomy and a councilor of the American Astronomical Society. She also cooperated with some projects to encourage people's engagement with science, one of them was the Summer Experience in the Eberly College of Science in 2006, a six-week summer programme that was designed to engage low-income high-school students in science research.  Biography   Early years  She was born in Kingston, Jamaica, on 14 May 1955. In one of the city's suburbs, she was raised by her father, Frank Davis, a police detective who stressed to her the importance of observation and deduction, and her mother, Phyllis Davis, an accountant who instilled in her the idea of doing her work with precision. Richards and her father would go to a botanical garden after dawn and observe the nature around them. He taught her to identify the colour varieties, training that would be useful in her career for the examination of stars. \\"What I do is definitely detective work,\\" she explains. \\"Astronomers want to know what happened. We look for evidence. We have to piece it all together like forensic scientists of the sky.\\" She attended Providence Primary School and graduated in 1966. Then, she studied in St. Hugh's High School, an all- girls high school. The fact of only having female teachers inspired her because she used them as role models. She graduated in 1973.  Academic beginnings  Richards graduated with the degree of BSc with Special Honors in Physics from the University of the West Indies in 1977 and in 1979 she earned a MS in Space Science at York University in Toronto. Persistence during her studies in Toronto helped her in a time where teachers were really tough with female students. She received her PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics in 1986 at the University of Toronto.  Personal life  She married Donald Richards in 1980, a professor of Statistics at Pennsylvania State University. They had two daughters, Chandra and Suzanne. Even though she had little free time, she enjoyed reading detective novels and writing poetry. She liked playing the violin and she passed some exams of the British Royal School of Music. Richards spoke French fluently and had a working knowledge of Spanish, Slovak, Czech and German. Along with her many refined hobbies, she maintained a concern with the most vulnerable part and cooperated with food banks.  Professional career  During the 1986‚Äì87 scholar year, she worked as a visiting scholar at the University of North Carolina. In 1987, she joined the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where she started as an assistant professor in the Department of Astronomy. At this university she moved up to associate professor in 1993 and became a professor of astronomy in 1999. During that year she worked at the Vatican Observatory in Castel Gandolfo. One year later, in 2000, she visited the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, as an invited scientist. In 2002, she was hired as professor of astronomy and astrophysics in the Pennsylvania State University, where she worked until she retired. During her tenure, she was appointed assistant department chair. However, she visited some universities during that period, among them, the University of Heidelberg, Germany, in 2013. She was involved in one of the most important decisions of recent years while she was a member of the IAU in Prague where, in 2006, it was decided that Pluto would not be a planet anymore. In 2011, Richards organized the IAU symposium in Slovakia, the first joint international meeting between binary star specialists. She also participated in programs of math and science enrichment for high-school students in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Vermont, Virginia and Toronto. Richards served as an officer in some astronomical organizations, for example, as president of Commission 42 of the IAU, member of the Board of Advisers of the Caribbean Institute of Astronomy or councilor of the American Astronomical Society. Additionally, she was part of the Eberly College of Science‚Äôs Climate and Diversity Committee, an organization whose aim was to create a good environment for all members of the college. On the other hand, she led multiple research studies in different parts of the world: at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, at the Skalnat√© Pleso Observatory and the one in Lomnick√Ω ≈°t√≠t, Slovakia, the South African Astronomical Observatory in Cape Town, the Spanish National Observatory in Madrid and the Teide Observatory in Tenerife. Apart from that, she was committed to science, so she was involved in some programs to encourage people's engagement with it. In 2006, she and Jacqueline Bortiatynski, a chemistry lecturer, co-founded the Summer Experience in the Eberly College of Science. This six-week summer program was designed to engage low-income high school students in science research. She also participated in Exploration Day, a local event emphasizing practical science learning for families, and Penn State Astronomy's Astrofest and Astronight, annual events held to promote astronomy and science to families in the Central Pennsylvania area. As a black woman astrophysicist, she was a strong figure in the fight for the visibility of racial minority groups and women in the fields of physics and astronomy.  Research  Her main research interests can be divided into three groups: computational astrophysics, stellar astrophysics, and exoplanets and brown dwarfs. Among the investigations she carried out, the speciality of Richards‚Äô research are binary stars. A binary star is a system formed by two stars that were born at the same time which orbit around a common center. The stars, however, mature at different rates. She was the first to use tomography in astronomy. At first, it was widely used in medicine or archeology, but Richards found the utility of this to test the gas-flow model that she created for her doctoral thesis. She used tomography to observe the binary system as it moves in relation to the Earth. This proves how the gas flows between the stars. As well as verifying the accuracy of her model, she could demonstrate that the gravity force acts in binary stars as the physical laws predicted. Richards also worked with a team of Russian scientists in order to continue with her studies about the gas flows between binary stars. She was also a pioneer in making theoretical hydrodynamic simulations of the Algol binary stars, where the gas flows from one star and hits the surface of the other one. Additionally, she developed distance correlation methods to discover associations in large astrophysical databases. Within the field of stellar astrophysics, she created three-dimensional \\"movies\\" of mass-exchange systems by scrutinizing spectroscopic and photometric time series of stars and compact objects in close orbit. This work could give important clues to the way mass transfer happens. Moreover, she researched the magnetic activity in cool stars and in the Sun, and the effects of nearby interacting binary stars on optical interferometry.  Awards and honors  In 2005, she was elected Honorary Member of the National Honor Society of Phi Eta Sigma in the Pennsylvania State University. In 2008 the Institute of Jamaica bestowed on her the Musgrave Medal in Gold, its most important academic prize. This one, however, is not only an award given to scientists, but also to artists and writers. Richards was the 14th scientist who received this medal. In 2009, she received the Award for Outstanding Achievement in Astronomy & Astrophysics on St. Hugh's High School 110th Anniversary. Three years later, in 2011, she received a Fulbright Distinguished Chair Research award from the Council for International Exchange of Scholars and the Slovak Fulbright Commission, which allowed her to conduct research on interacting binary stars at the Astronomical Institute of Slovakia in that same year. In 2012, she was elected again as an Honorary Member of the Physics Honor Society, Sigma Pi Sigma in the Quadrennial Congress, Orlando. In 2013 she was awarded the American Physical Society Woman Physicist of the Month Award.

The city of Qamishli has been the site of multiple car bombings since 2015. The bombings On 27 July 2016, a livestock truck carrying explosives and a motorcycle headed toward the western part of the city on the road between an Asayish conscription center and a crowded farmers' market and exploded. The blasts leveled several buildings, destroyed several cars, and sent a mushroom cloud of smoke into the air which were seen by residents of the Turkish city of Nusaybin across the border, and the blast was heard by residents a few miles away. The first explosion caused a gas cylinder and an electric generator to explode. At least 44 people were killed and more than 171 wounded. Dozens were trapped under rubble and the hospitals in the city were immediately calling for donations of blood of all types. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for the bombings, saying that they are in retaliation for the recent coalition bombings against their forces in Manbij City. The bombings included a suicide car bomb and a motorcycle bomb. They occurred near the border with Turkey. The targets of the bombing were the local Kurdish police force and a government building.

The island is the site of a radioactive waste repository left by the United States after it conducted a series of nuclear tests on Enewetak Atoll between 1946 and 1958. There are ongoing concerns around deterioration of the waste site and a potential radioactive spill. Runit Dome Cactus\\" nuclear weapons test in 1958. The Runit Dome, also called Cactus Dome or locally , is a diameter, thick dome of concrete at sea level, encapsulating an estimated of radioactive debris, including some plutonium-239. The debris stems from nuclear tests conducted in the Enewetak Atoll by the United States between 1946 and 1958.Emma Reynolds. \\"Deadly dome of gorgeous Pacific island leaking radioactive waste\\", news.com.au, 7 July 2015. Retrieved 12 May 2017. From 1977 to 1980, loose waste and topsoil debris scraped off from six different islands in the Enewetak Atoll was transported here, mixed with concrete, and stored in the nuclear blast crater of the Cactus test from May 6, 1958. Four thousand US servicemen were involved in the cleanup and it took three years to complete. The waste-filled crater was finally entombed in concrete. In 1982, a US government task force raised concern about a probable breach if a severe typhoon were to hit the island. In 2013, a report by the US Department of EnergyVisual Description of the Concrete Exterior of the Cactus Crater Containment Structure LLNL-TR-648143 found that the concrete dome had weathered with minor cracking of the structure.Jan Hendrik Hinzel, Coleen Jose and Kim Wall. \\"This dome in the Pacific houses tons of radioactive waste ‚Äì and it's leaking\\", The Guardian, 3 July 2015. Retrieved 4 February 2018. However, the soil around the dome was found to be more contaminated than its contents, so a breach could not increase the radiation levels by any means. Because the cleaning operation in the 1970s only removed an estimated 0.8 percent of the total transuranic waste in the Enewetak atoll, the soil and the lagoon water surrounding the structure now contain a higher level of radioactivity than the debris of the dome itself, so even in the event of a total collapse, the radiation dose delivered to the local resident population or marine environment should not change significantly. Concern primarily lies in the rapid tidal response to the height of the water beneath the debris pile, with the potential for contamination of the groundwater supply with radionuclides. One particular concern is that, in order to save costs, the original plan to line the porous bottom crater with concrete was abandoned. Since the bottom of the crater consists of permeable soil, there is seawater inside the dome. However, as the Department of Energy report stated, the released radionuclides will be very rapidly diluted and should not cause any elevated radioactive risk for the marine environment, compared to what is already experienced. Leaking and breaching of the dome could however disperse plutonium, a radioactive element that is also a toxic heavy metal.* An investigative report by the Los Angeles Times in November 2019 reignited fears of the Dome cracking and releasing radioactive material into the soil and surrounding water.A Pacific isle radioactive and forgotten, The New York Times, Michael B.

The bill ceased to be considered by Parliament after January 2014 and did not become law. However, a subsequent bill with the same objective, the European Union Referendum Act 2015, was later introduced to the House of Commons by the newly elected Conservative government in May 2015 was passed and received royal assent on 17 December 2015. Origins The issue of the United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union had been ongoing for many years before the 2010 general election, arguably since the 1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum. In 2013 David Cameron pledged to renegotiate the United Kingdom's terms of membership with the European Union. In May 2013, the Conservative Party published a draft EU referendum bill and outlined their plans for renegotiation and then an in-out vote if returned to office in 2015. The draft bill stated that the referendum must be held no later than 31 December 2017. The draft was taken forward as a private member's bill in the House of Commons by the Conservative member James Wharton who had come top of a ballot of backbench MPs, entitling him to introduce a bill during the 2013‚Äì14 parliamentary session. His bill attempted to enshrine the Conservative Party Position into law before the 2015 general election. A spokesman for prime minister and Leader of the Conservative Party, David Cameron, said he was \\"very pleased\\" and would ensure the bill was given \\"the full support of the Conservative Party\\".  Details of the Bill  The Bill set out the foundations for the timetable and question (Section 1), the electorate (Section 2), and the cost (Section 5).Text of the Bill Parliament.uk Referendum question Originally the bill gave the question to appear on ballot papers: and in Welsh: permitting a simple YES/NO answer (to be marked with a single (X)). Revised question recommendations In the autumn of 2013 the Electoral Commission published a report which studied and tested the wording of the proposed question contained within the bill and presented two possible revised options. Recommendation One The first recommendation was an amended question which kept the yes/no response options: and in Welsh: permitting a simple YES/NO answer (to be marked with a single (X)). This option was presented as the original proposed question within the European Union Referendum Act 2015. Recommendation Two The second recommendation was an amended question which changed the responses from the yes/no options: with the responses to the question (to be marked with a single (X)): and in Welsh: with the responses (to be marked with a single (X)): The Electoral Commission tested this option but were unable to fully able to explore its full viability in the time available however it would be this exact wording and responses that would later be used and appeared on ballot papers for the 2016 EU Referendum under the European Union Referendum Act 2015.Advice of the Electoral Commission on the referendum question included in the European Union (Referendum) Bill Concerns regarding the possibility of a Hung Parliament Regarding the ability of the bill to force the next parliament into holding a referendum, a parliamentary research paper noted that: :\\"The Bill simply provides for a referendum on continued EU membership by the end of December 2017 and does not otherwise specify the timing, other than requiring the Secretary of State to bring forward orders by the end of 2016. These orders would need both Houses to agree to the detailed rules for the poll and the date. If no party obtained a majority at the next general election due in 2015, there might be some uncertainty about the passage of the orders in the next Parliament. Unless the orders are passed, it would not appear possible to hold the referendum, since the day and the conduct of the poll would not have received parliamentary assent.\\"  Progress through Parliament  The bill's first reading in the House of Commons was made on 19 June 2013. It received its second reading on 5 July 2013 by 304 votes to none after almost all Labour MPs and all Liberal Democrat MPs abstained. It then progressed through its Committee and Report Stages between July and November 2013 and finally cleared the Commons in November 2013. In late 2013, Conservative MP Adam Afriyie tabled an amendment to the bill bring forward the date of the referendum to 2014 but his amendment was defeated in the House of Commons. The bill was introduced to the House of Lords in December 2013 and had its Second Reading there on 10 January 2014.Stages of Bill Parliament.uk At the time it was suggested that the Bill would not 'make it through the Lords alive'.EU referendum bill is not a done deal BBC News The last consideration of the bill was its examination by committee on 31 January 2014 and the debate ended at that committee stage. Peers voted by 180 to 130 not to allow more time for a debate in the Lords and no further days were scheduled. The rejection by the House of Lords effectively blocked the bill and killed off the proposed legislation. After the bill failed to pass the House of Lords, James Wharton blamed Labour and Liberal Democrat obstructionism; however the Liberal Democrats argued that the Conservatives themselves had not assigned the bill enough time whilst Labour responded by stating that the bill was in the Conservative Party's interest rather than the national one. Wharton has since argued that his Private Member's Bill was designed to put the issue to rest.EU referendum bill to be put forward by Tory MP  Politics. theguardian.com.  Criticism  The Bill received numerous opposition particularly from the House of Lords where the bill was blocked as well as from Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats. Former EU commissioner Lord Mandelson criticised the bill at the time by describing it as government \\"grandstanding to the UKIP gathering\\" and also said \\"We need to concentrate on using all of our influence and energy in building up Britain's influence in Europe, not driving Britain out of Europe.\\" Liberal Democrats peer Baroness Falkner of Margravine told peers that the legislation was too \\"important to rush through\\" and although she trusted the public to make the right decision accused the government of picking the proposed 2017 date as \\"arbitrarily plucked out of the air\\". Labour peer Baroness Quinn also criticised the bill by describing the proposed commitment as \\"alarming\\" and was \\"highly irregular in singling out a date\\".Peers clash over EU referendum Bill BBC News The Bill was also described as \\"economically devastating\\",EU Referendum Bill clears first Lords hurdle amid delay warnings BBC News and \\"biased and vague\\".The EU referendum question included in the Conservatives‚Äô private members‚Äô Bill is both highly biased and vague: it would actively misinform UK voters LSE Outcome In May 2015 the Conservative Party led by then Prime Minister David Cameron won a small but unexpected overall majority in the 2015 UK general election which contained a manifesto promise to hold a renegotiation of the UK's membership of the EU to be followed by a in-out referendum. It was fulfilled when the Referendum Bill was contained in the Queens speech three weeks after the election with both Labour and the Liberal Democrats dropping their previous opposition. The renegotiation was completed in February 2016 and the referendum was held on 23 June of the same year in which 51.9% of voters chose to Leave the European Union compared with 48.1% of voters who chose to Remain a member of the European Union.

The parish is administered by the Anglican Diocese of Tasmania. The building was designed by the Tasmanian government civil engineer and architect, Dublin-born John Lee Archer who had been appointed in 1826 and arrived in Hobart Town in August 1827.Brown, G et al. 2007, The Penitentiary Chapel historic site, National Trust of Australia (Tasmania), Kings Meadows, Tasmania. The church was built by labourers and tradespeople from amongst the convicts on the island. Since it is more than 180 years old the church contains many features that reflect the life and times of Hobart as it developed in the 19th and 20th centuries.  History  In 1830 there were plans for the construction in New Town of an orphanage and chapel (also known as the Orphan School or the Asylum). The \\"orphans\\" were children of convicts or aboriginals and also young offenders. The Tasmanian governor George Arthur upgraded the plan for a chapel to a parish church for the surrounding area, to be funded by donations.Walters, R 1994, Parish of St. John New Town Tasmania: aspects of history, Parish booklet Unpublished, p. 1-2. As O'Neill recounts, the pleasing exterior belied the grim conditions within: \\"From the beginning, the Orphan School seems to have been a bleak place.\\" > The Orphan School, designed by John Lee Archer, was situated in St John's > Avenue, New Town. The parish church of St John's stood between the buildings > for boys and for girls. In God's Own Country, Boyce describes this as a > 'parish partnership' between the Church and government with the church > designed specifically for the needs of the Asylum, convicts and free > settlers. The children sat in one gallery and the convicts in the other with > the settlers in the main body. Barriers and separate entrances prevented the > children from seeing the convicts. Church of England clergy dominated the > committee that managed the Asylum. It was convicts who built the church, after making the raw materials such as hand-made bricks for the walls, hand-hewn stone for the tower, and timber beams cut from trees on nearby Mount Wellington.Church of St John, New Town 2012, Parish leaflet Unpublished, p. 1. The work was sufficiently complete for the first service to be conducted 20 December 1835.  Features  The exterior and interior features of the building are of architectural and historical interest. For instance, by the 1850s whale oil was burned in all the lamps that lit the church. This was modern and progressive at that time, but would be out of the question in the twenty-first century, when whales are protected under Australian Law  Pipe organ  The Hill & Son Organ seen from the console, in St John's New Town The church's organ has evolved over time, as described by John Maidment: > The first organ was built by Gray & Davison, London.

Clock and bell  St John's Church clock, seen from Creek Road As described by Archer's biographer, Roy Smith: \\"The tower of St. John's Church, New Town is carried out in freestone in a simple pointed Gothic style, with a battlemented top and with octagonal buttresses finishing as pinnacles. It is an attractive tower\\" (Smith, 1962, p. 14).Smith, R 1962, John Lee Archer: Tasmanian architect and engineer, Tasmanian Historical Research Association, Sandy Bay, Tasmania. On all four sides, the tower exhibits a clock that still chimes the hours, although it is \\"older than Big Ben\\" according to Walters, who records that it was made in London in 1818 by Thwaites & Reed and that the clock's bell was donated as a royal gift from the English king, William IV in 1834. The original bell had to be decommissioned in 1916 because of safety considerations. It was melted down and formed into commemorative medallions. A replacement bell was installed in 1929, jointly funded by all the churches in the district, whatever their denomination.Church of St John, New Town 2012, Parish leaflet Unpublished, p. 10.

Only the top deck remains today, but a drawing of the original can be seen in the church pamphlet.Church of St John, New Town 2012, Parish leaflet Unpublished, p. 8.  Pews and galleries  The first pews, like the pulpit, were made from imported cedar wood. They were of the high box style, arranged to face a central aisle rather than all facing the altar as the modern bench- pews do. These seats were reserved for members of the congregation who were neither orphans nor convicts. The orphans and convicts were restricted to the North Gallery and South Gallery respectively, both of which were entirely devoid of comforts, and rigorously segregated.Walters, R 1994, Parish of St. John New Town Tasmania: aspects of history, Parish booklet Unpublished, p. 5.

Biography He was born into a Zagreb Jewish family that came from Nagykanizsa in Hungary. His father Ljudevit, a lawyer and politician (Zagreb, 1858 ‚Äì Zagreb, 1943) was the first Jewish representative in the Croatian parliament (1887 ‚Äì 1906 and 1910 ‚Äì 1913), a representative in the Croatian-Hungarian parliament in Budapest (1892 ‚Äì 1913) and a city councillor in the Zagreb city assembly (1892 ‚Äì 1904). Rikard's mother Irda (Sida) n√©e Kraus, 1870, died in Zagreb on February 6, 1904, leaving four motherless children: Rikard and his brother Vilim, and daughters Nada and Anamarija. Rikard acquired his elementary and high school education in Zagreb. At the same time he received his musical training at the school of the Croatian Music Institute in Zagreb, where he studied violin in the class of V√†clav Huml, piano in the class of Ernest Krauth and theory with Franjo Dugan and Fran Lhotka. Just before matriculation, he started composing, and wrote his first pieces, devoted to the piano: Little Prelude (April 20, 1916) and Andante (August 18, 1916). In the same year, inspired by the verses of the Croatian poet Dragutin Domjaniƒá, Rikard Schwarz composed two solo songs entitled In the Mystic Night and Dead Lake. His early composing activity was brought to a sudden stop by the war and his mobilisation. At that time, Schwarz composed All in Vain (June 17, 1917), another solo song, for soprano and piano, to verses of Vladimir Nazor. On his return from the army in 1918, at his father's wish, he started a course of chemistry at the Engineering Faculty in Zagreb (1918/1919), soon transferring to the Technical High School in Vienna. The rich musical life of Vienna and the firm belief that he had a musical vocation headed him in the direction of art, however, and in 1919 he enrolled as a full-time student at the Staatsakademie f√ºr Musik und darstellende Kunst in Vienna. In Vienna Rikard attended the lectures of Arnold Sch√∂nberg, Alban Berg and Joseph Marx and studied piano with Franz Joseph Moser, as well as conducting at Ludwig Kaiser's. In the bosom of the then contemporary school of Arnold Sch√∂nberg, and tutored by Alban Berg, in his Viennese period, Schwarz composed eight pieces: Sonata for Violin and Piano in C Minor, Variationen und Fugato √ºber ein Menuetto von Mozart f√ºr Klavier 2hdg, F√ºnf Lieder nach Gedichten aus ‚ÄúArabischen N√§chten‚Äù von Hans Bethge, String Quartet in B Flat Major, the solo songs Sometimes Happens from a cycle by Rainer Maria Rilke Die fr√ºhen Gedichte (1919), Prelude for piano (1921), two choral pieces for Yiddish texts Inser rebenju and Kinder kimt and the orchestral ballad Under the Deck (for baritone and orchestra) after Nazor's miniature cycle of Galley Slaves. Also to be found in the Schwarz papers is a fragment of a Lullaby for violin and orchestra, or perhaps piano and the score of a Romantic Symphony composed in Novi Sad in 1938. Completing his studies, in 1922 Rikard went back to Zagreb where, wishing to show his Viennese works, on September 28, 1922, he put on a composer's evening in the Croatian Music Institute. The reviewing acknowledged his skill as a composer. He found a market for the Violin Sonata in C Minor and the String Quartet in B Flat Major (which is not now in existence) in Vienna and Southampton. Schwarz, as he writes himself gave up studying in Vienna ‚Äúfor financial reasons‚Äù, and continued his musical career, mainly teaching, conducting and journalism, in Osijek and Split. Along with Maks Unger, in Osijek was one of the creators of the idea that the Music School should be turned into the City Conservatory. He drew up the curriculum of the conservatory and created its library on the model of the scientific plan of the Zagreb Conservatory. From 1924 he worked as opera conductor in the National Theatre, as choir master of the Kuhaƒç Singing Association, as teacher in the City Conservatory, and music critic in the papers Die Drau, Kazali≈°ni list, Jugoslovenski muziƒçar and Hrvatski list. Very often, along with Lav Mirski, he conducted the Osijek Philharmonic Orchestra and operetta performances. Financial difficulties in the music department of the Osijek Theatre and the Philharmonic resulted in his looking to Split, where at the end of 1926 he was at work in the Opera. In Split, on April 1, 1927, in collaboration with the violinist Mary ≈Ωe≈æelj and the pianist Jelka Karlovac he founded a private school. The short stay in Split was very fruitful for Schwarz, for as well as teaching, he also directed the orchestra and choir of the Zvonimir Singing Association and put on symphony concert with the Split Philharmonic Orchestra. He went on working as a music reviewer in Novo doba and Jutarnji list. Since during his stay in Split, Schwarz was still under contract to Osijek and its theatre, whose operetta ensemble moved to Belgrade, Schwarz had to change homes again, which, rather against his wishes, determined his further career. From 1927 he continued his work in teaching as piano and theory teacher at the Stankoviƒá Music School in Belgrade, where from November 12, 1929 to 1937 he was assistant director. He wrote for Glasnik Muziƒçkog dru≈°tva Stankoviƒá. In 1929, with the composers Miloje Milojeviƒá and Kosta Manojloviƒá, he started off the periodical Muzika. He developed his writing career providing material for Zvuk, Radio Beograd, Muziƒçar and the papers Morgenblatt, ≈Ωidov and Sportsko-turistiƒçki Lloyd. As well as reviews, he often wrote on topics from the history of music. It was with lectures in musical history that he worked in the Kolarac People's University from 1934 to 1938, and as conductor of the orchestra of the Stankoviƒá School, he prepared an opera class, which he took to the National Theatre, performing Gluck, Pergolesi and Mozart. The last phase of his career as composer and conductor is related to Novi Sad. The Isidor Bajiƒá Music School underwent a ‚Äúperiod of invaluable revival‚Äù when Rikard Schwarz was its director, from 1936 to 1940, undertaking numerous activities and reaping considerable success. He ran the music school under the title People's Conservatory, and put on ‚Äúpopular concerts with lectures and the participation of soloists, a school choir and orchestra.‚Äù In Novi Sad in 1938, Rikard Schwarz became a father, to Lujo (Ludvig-Milorad), but his wife Verica, n√©e Jovanoviƒá, died after the delivery. In 1940 he was mobilised and sent to Sarajevo and Macedonia. After the April War, in 1941 he fled from Novi Sad to Zagreb, where his father, sister and son were. On June 30, 1941, he was arrested and taken to the Zagreb Fair, whence on July 2 or 3 he was sent to Gospiƒá, then to the Slana Camp in Pag, and finally to Krapje (Jasenovac I), where according to the available information he died of starvation and exhaustion before the end of 1941. Oeuvre The composition oeuvre of Rikard Schwarz can be analysed from the 27 existing works. His earlier works were created in Vienna between 1918 and 1921, and they show harmonic audacity and an aspiration to a more modern music expression on the model of the composers of the 2nd Viennese School, but at the same time a divergence in the direction of neo-Classicism can be seen (Sonata for Violin and Piano in C Minor, 1921). Particularly interesting for music in Croatia are the first solo songs to texts by Domjaniƒá and Nazor, because of the relationship between textural original and the vocal and instrumental part. In his manner of treating the piano part as against the vocal part and the manner in which the text is declaimed in some parts he shows a contemporary idiom and an affinity for the modern. Schwarz's most radical advance came in the 2nd String Quartet and in the piano composition Albumblatt where he abandoned the prop of tonality. He returned to neo- Classicism with his last opus, Romantic Symphony of 1938. Instrumental works comprehend piano works created between 1915 and 1938. In manuscript there is the composition Untitled (Zagreb, 1915), Small Prelude (Zagreb, 1916), Prelude (Vienna, 1921), Variationen und Fugato √ºber ein Menuetto von Mozart f√ºr Klavier 2hdg (Beƒç, 1922), Albumblatt (Zagreb, 1923?) as well as Piano Sketch for an Unknown Stage Piece (about 1937 ‚Äì 1938?).

He also founded the eponymous publishing house in Milan in 1946 and was a mentor-like figure for the most famous Indro Montanelli, journalist and historian, founder of Il Giornale, one of the Italian biggest newspaper. Between 1927 and 1950, he published several magazines including L'Italiano (1927), Omnibus (1937), and Il Borghese (1950), a cultural and satirical weekly, conservative-oriented. A self-described \\"cultural anarchist\\", after the Second World War Longanesi headed a right-wing popular sentiment that embraced conservatism, agrarian virtues, anti-democracy and nostalgic post- fascism. Longanesi was also an elegant and refined cartoonist and wrote several books of memoirs, characterised by a ruthless streak and Fascist nostalgic accents (In piedi e seduti, Una vita, Ci salveranno le vecchie zie?). Biography Early life and career Born in Bagnacavallo, Leo was son of Paolo Longanesi, director of a gunpowder factory in Lugo, and Angela Marangoni, member of a wealthy landowner family of Bagnacavallo. In 1911, when Leo was aged 6, the Longanesi family moved to Bologna, where according to the family wealth, Leo attended the most prestigious schools and learned French language, studying at the Galvani High School. In 1920, Leo wrote his first printed sheet, Il Marchese, at the age of 15. Following he wrote the monthly magazine Zibaldone dei giovani (1921), Il Toro (1923) and Il Dominio (1924), arousing attention for his young age and the style of writing. After the high school, Longanesi attended the University of Bologna, gaining a bachelor's decree of law. After University, Longanesi became member of the worldly elite of the city, attending social circles, literary caf√©s and nighthawk pubs, becoming friend to leading intellectual such as Galvano Della Volpe, Giorgio Morandi and Vincenzo Cardarelli, and young rising politicians like Leandro Arpinati, Dino Grandi and Italo Balbo, all future Fascist leading figures. During this time Longanesi became interested to politics, and in 1924 started a collaboration with L'Assalto (\\"The Assault\\"), a Fascist newspaper in Bologna. In the same year, he knew Mino Maccari, a famous painter, who introduced him in the socialite circles of Rome. With Maccari and famous writer Curzio Malaparte, Longanesi started a cultural movement called Strapaese (literally \\"great country\\"), who saw the Italian Fascism as bearer of rural traditions and countrymen virtues. Living between Rome and Bologna, Longanesi with the magazine Il Selvaggio (\\"The Savage\\") from 1925 to 1929, and founded the weekly magazine L'Italiano (\\"The Italian\\"), from 1926 to 1942, headsquartered in Bologna, along with Maccari, American playwright Henry Furst and writer Giovanni Comisso, former legionnaire of Fiume with Gabriele D'Annunzio. In this moment, Benito Mussolini was establishing his police state, banning the opposition parties and imposing a cult of personality based on his figure (The Duce, the leader) and the National Fascist Party, now the only legal party. Longanesi and his collaborators grew near to the new regime, and started a cultural debate on the relationship between arts and fascism. In 1926, he wrote his first great work, the \\"Vade-mecum of the perfect Fascist\\". The book express, in the motto \\"Mussolini is always right\\" (Mussolini ha sempre ragione), a mix of adoration and caricature of Mussolini's dictatorship. For all the dictatorship of Mussolini (19261943), Longanesi was both loyal to the Fascism but also a critical of it, being ironic about the Battle for Grain (marshes' recovery policy), the mistification of the Ancient Rome and the imperialist dreams on Africa. Under Fascism In 1927, Longanesi started his first publishing house, L'Italiano Editions (property of L'Italiano magazine, who directed), and published works of Fascist writers critical on the regime, such as Malaparte, Riccardo Bacchelli, Vincenzo Cardarelli and Antonio Baldini, Telesio Interlandi, who was later one of the major supporter of the racial laws (1938) against the Jews. The follow year, he purchased by Malaparte the publishing house and magazine La Voce (\\"The Voice\\"), founded by the conservative journalist Giuseppe Prezzolini in 1919. In 1929, Longanesi became a candidate for the general election (which presented only the Fascist Party), without being elected. On July of the same year, Longanesi is chosen to direct L'Assalto, who managed before 1931, when he resigned. The cause of his dismissal was strong and irriverent piece on Senator Giuseppe Tanari, financer of the squadrismo (literally \\"squadronism\\"), a radical tendency inside Fascism, which members attacked, assaulted and sometimes killed political dissidents. His article was motivated by a fact happened in May 1931: Longanesi attended an displaying of conductor Arturo Toscanini at the Bologna Communal Theatre, attended also by Galeazzo Ciano, son-in-law of Mussolini, and Arpinati, Longanesi's old friend. At the end of the piece, Ciano and Arpinati called Toscanini to play Giovinezza (\\"Youth\\"), a popular song among the Fascists. Due to Toscanini refusal, Ciano and Arpinati left the theatre disappointed, and at the exit Toscanini was assaulted and slapped by radical Fascists for his dissent. Erroneusly, Longanesi was believed to be the first slapper, mainly because one article against conductor's refusal the following day. In May 1932, Longanesi moved with his parents and grandparents in Rome, buying an elegant house in Corso Vittorio Emanuele II. He also moved L'Italiano and Il Selvaggio magazines in the capital, nevertheless both magazines were in decline and Longanesi directed them almost alone. Despite his criticisms, Longanesi was chosen by the regime to organize a literary exhibition on Mussolini for the 10th anniversary of the March on Rome, opened on 28 October 1932. After the began of the Second Italo- Ethiopian War in 1935, Longanesi gained the role of chief of the propaganda. For his services to the Fascism, Longanesi requested the direction of any big newspaper, gaining a refuse by the regime, that feared that new magazines and papers, espacially under the direction of critics of the dictatorship, would undermined the Fascist's strict control over the press. However, thanks to his connection with Mussolini's son Vittorio, Longanesi gained an employment for Cinema, a magazine of film criticism, in September 1936. After a month, however, Longanesi was fired for an unpleasanted photographical service on the regime. On 3 April 1937, Longanesi created a new magazine: Omnibus, an illsutrated news magazine on literature and arts, later described as the \\"father of the Italian magazines\\", especially for his use of photographs and images. The magazine was published by Angelo Rizzoli (for the first 6 months by Arnoldo Mondadori), and presented notable and rising journalists and artists such as Indro Montanelli, Alberto Moravia, Vitaliano Brancati, Ennio Flaiano, Mario Soldati, Mario Pannunzio, Arrigo Benedetti and Alberto Savinio. Despite the immediate success of the magazine, Omnibus was forced to close on 2 February 1939 by the Ministry of Popular Culture (Minculpop), apparently without reason but probably for the collaborations to the magazine by Jewish intellectuals like Moravia and anti-fascists like Pannunzio. However, thanks again to his high livel connections, in 1940 Longanesi was appointed by the Minculpop itself as its technical-artistic consultant. In the same period he was also chosen by Rizzoli as director of a book series, Il sof√† delle Muse (\\"The Muses' sofa\\"), publishing successful works like The Tartar Steppe (1940), Don Giovanni in Sicily (1941) and The Truth about Motta affair (1937, reedited in 1941). Second World War On 10 June 1940, Italy declared war to France and United Kingdom, in alliance with Nazi Germany and other Fascist- inspired nations of the Axis Powers. Longanesi was skeptical, despite the initial popular enthusiasm, of the Italian entrance in the Second World War, thought that will be the ruin of Italy. Despite his personal beliefs, and faithful to his controversial and ecleptic nature, Longanesi chose to stay loyal to the Fascist regime, also working for Primato magazine, directed by former Public Education Minister Giuseppe Bottai, and inventing war slogan such as \\"Taci! Il nemico ti ascolta\\" (Shut up! Enemy is listening you), \\"La patria si serve anche facendo la sentinella ad un bidone di benzina\\" (The fatherland could be served also keeping watch on an petrol barrel) and \\"Una pistola puntata contro l'Italia\\" (A gun aimed on Italy). After the failure of the Greco-Italian War in 1941 and Tunisian Campaign in 1942, Italy fell in crisis and grew always more subjected to Germany. On 25 July 1943, a coup d'√©tat against Mussolini overthrow the Fascism, and Longanesi, along with Pannunzio and Benedetti wrote a piece that celebrate the apparent return of freedom and hope for the Italian retreat from war. However, the new Prime Minister Pietro Badoglio secretly sign the armistice of Cassibile with Allied Powers on 3 September 1943, while all Italy is under German direct military influences, and on 8 September with a proclamation, announce the switch of side from Axis to Allies, after which he fled to Brindisi with the royal family and the government, left military and public authorities without orders. Like Italy broke up in a German-occupied north and an Allied-occupied south, on 16 September Longanesi fled from Rome to south, with his friends Mario Soldati, Steno and Riccardo Freda, arriving in the Molisian town of Vinchiaturo on 29 September. On 1 October, Longanesi moved to Naples, where along with Steno and Soldati, collaborated with Allied authorities with an anti-fascist propaganda radio FM named White Star. However, also in this case, Longanesi rapidly grew critical on the new anti-fascist political class, composed by old opportunists and new ambitious figures, united in a climate of political chameleontism. On 5 June 1944, Rome was finally liberated, and Longanesi moved again to the capital on 1 July, writing the comedy Il suo cavallo (\\"His horse\\"), a mockery of Mussolini depicted similar to Shakepseare's Richard III. Post-war, political activism and death In January 1946, with the end of the war, Longanesi moved to Milan with his family, while his parents moved to Imola, in the native Romagna. Shortly after, Longanesi accepted the offer of the industrialist Giovanni Monti, and founded the publishing house Longanesi & C.. on 1 February 1946. Simultaneously, he started the publishing of Il Libraio (\\"The Bookseller\\"), a bibliographic magazine, active from 1946 to 1949. Politically, Longanesi became a prominent opponent to the new republican democracy that substituted the Fascism, stating that: In his pieces, he jokes on both anti-fascists (\\"There is who believe to be an anti-fascist only because Fascism never noticed him\\") and ex-fascists reused in the new system (\\"There is a question that we must never do: 'Where we have met before?'\\"). Longanesi was also a staunch anti-communist. During the 1948 election, fearing a victor of the Soviet-sponsored Popular Democratic Front, Longanesi and his favourite Indro Montanelli campaigned for the \\"less worse\\" Christian Democracy (DC), printing and publishing pamphlets, fliers, posters and hosting Radio Garibaldi, an illegal FM in Milan. After the defeat of the Front, Longanesi left Il Libraio, and in 1950 Longanesi founded the magazine Il Borghese, collaborating with Montanelli, Giovanni Ansaldo, Giuseppe Prezzolini, Giovanni Spadolini, Alberto Savinio, Mario Tedeschi, Ennio Flaiano, Colette Rosselli, Irene Brin, Goffredo Parise, Mario Missiroli and Piero Buscaroli. In the mind of Longanesi, Il Borghese should will be expression of a new right-wing anti-communist movement, who he named \\"Brothers of Italy's League\\", organizing political circles in several cities. The movement rapidly grew, attracting both unsatisfied electors and excluded ones (especially farmers) by the 1950s economic miracle. Longanesi and his followers thought that the new media culture and consumerism would destroying the traditions, disfiguring Italian landscapes and barbarising culture, also criticized the nullification of classes. He was hardly critical on the government, calling him unable to balance old traditions and modernity, and on democratic policy of universal suffrage, stating: In early 1950s, Longanesi tried to transform his movement in a large right-wing party, formed by former Fascists, monarchists, Catholics, liberals and conservatives. He also visited the mayor of Naples Achille Lauro, exponent of the monarchist PNM, to convince him to join and finance the movement, but his refusal and the lack of political ambitions of Longanesi caused the failure of the project. However, Longanesi still supported the idea of national party, and in 1955 he organized a conference with the title \\"What is the right[-wing] in Italy?\\". Soon, his criticisms both on government and neo-fascists caused his isolation. In 1956, his patron Giovanni Monti purposed a separation between Il Borghese and Longanesi & Co., and the refusal of Longanesi was used a justification for oust him out the administration council. Thanks to some unknown connection in Confindustria, as reported by his friend Giovanni Ansaldo, Longanesi was able to maintain Il Borghese for himself paying ‚Ç§5,000,000. Always Ansaldo later told that Monti's operation was forced by governative pressures, especially from President Giovanni Gronchi, a left-leaning Christian Democrat who personally disdained Longanesi and Il Borghese, and hoped that without money it will be closed and Longanesi ruined. On 27 September 1957, while in his office, Longanesi suffered a heart attack. It was reported that his last words were: Transported to clinic, he died here soon after. His death was griefed by his few living friends, including Arrigo Benedetti (director of L'Espresso), Indro Montanelli, future founder of Il Giornale, and Giovanni Spadolini, future first non-Christian Democrat Prime Minister of the Italian Republic. Personal life On 18 February 1939, few days after the closure of Omnibus, Longanesi married Maria Spadini, daughter of the painter Armando Spadini, knew thanks to the common friend Vincenzo Cardarelli, former journalist for L'Italiano. By the marriage Longanesi had three children: Virginia (born 19 December 1939), Caterina (born 25 December 1941) and Paolo (born 6 April 1945). While at home, Longanesi performed his painting passion, causing some arguments with the wife for the style of his works, characterized by surrealism. He also believed in traditional and superstitious cures, such as using rabbit skin to handle sciatica. He also owned a collections of guns, passion inherited by his father, who was director of a gunpowder factory. He loved Risorgimento history and, in spite of his conservative trend, libertarian-like figures like 17th century pirates and 19th century Carbonari.

She suffered as much as Darcy, and tells her she didn't know everything about her son. Darcy continues to New Orleans alone. Once there, Darcy poses as an interested buyer of a Hot Dawg franchise. She quizzes Mark about how he started the business. Eventually, she quotes her son's business plan and reveals her real name to Mark. Then she pulls out Walker's gun as Mark begs for his life. She puts the gun under her own chin but Mark wrestles it free. He asks her how much money does she want, but she only wants to know how her son died. He explains what he knows, confesses he was always the lonely rich kid and jealous of the love Walker got from Darcy. He stole Walker's plan to prove his worth to his father. As Darcy drives home, she throws Walker's gun in a river. She buries in her backyard the clothes he died in, which had been collected by the police in an evidence bag. As she cries, she wishes she could hold his hand just one last time. The next day she goes to find Clayton and embraces him in the street.

He is the party's national president and one of its eight federal deputies in the LXIII Legislature of the Mexican Congress. Early life Flores obtained a law degree from National Autonomous University of Mexico in 1992 and two degrees from Harvard University: a master's degree in public, economic and gubernatorial law in 1996, as well as a J.D. in 2001. In addition to becoming a partner at the law firm of Dur√°n, Flores and Soria, he was the pastor of Casa sobre la Roca (House on the Rock), a Neo-Pentecostal church which supported Felipe Calder√≥n in the 2006 presidential elections. Social Encounter In 2006, Social Encounter was founded as a national political group, which unlike a party, is not federally funded; it also organized as a party in Baja California. That same year, after Calder√≥n's election, he obtained a civil service position in the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT). After six months in the post, he was accused by the secretariat's internal oversight agency for disobeying orders from the secretary and altering a document, prompting his removal and barring him from a public service position until 2020. Additionally, for the LX and LXI Legislatures, Flores was an unused alternate senator for the National Action Party; he had previously been an alternate federal deputy for the Institutional Revolutionary Party. In 2014, concurrent with Social Encounter's transition to a national political party, Flores was named President of the National Directive Committee of the party, its highest position. Federal deputy The PES placed Flores Cervantes at the top of its list of candidates for proportional representation seats in the Chamber of Deputies from the fourth electoral region (representing Mexico City), guaranteeing him a seat in the Chamber of Deputies for the LXIII Legislature of the Mexican Congress.

The school was founded in 1982 by Dr Joe Madiath. GVRS is affiliated to the Board of Secondary Education, Odisha.There are 4 branches of GVRS in Odisha.Gram Vikas High School was established in 1982 at Kankia village in Ganjam district. Mahendra Tanaya Ashram School was established in Koinpur village in Gajapati District of Odisha in 1992. Two more schools, Gram Vikas Shiksa Niketan and Gram Vikas Vidya Vihar were established in 1998 and 2002 in Kalahandi district and Ganjam district respectively. History Origins In 1971, Joe Madiath led 400 volunteers from the University of Madras' Young Students' Movement for Development to West Bengal to manage relief camps for refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War. Witnessing the devastation of the 1971 Orissa cyclone, and realising the comparatively little attention received by the disaster victims, Madiath and a small group of 40 volunteers shifted their attention there. The group decided that the best way to help the cyclone victims was to provide irrigation facilities. Once these efforts were completed, the group handed over the facilities to the villagers and left. But Madiath and a small group of YSMD volunteers came to the realisation that the irrigation facilities benefited mostly the landlords, and decided to stay in Orissa to become social activists. Joe Madiath and remaining volunteers moved to Ganjam district at the invitation of the local authorities, and established Gram Vikas in 1979 and Gram Vikas Resdeintial School Kankia in 1982. Campuses The campuses of the school are spread over 3 districts of Odisha. The campuses include: * Gram Vikas High School Campus,Kankia * Mahendra Tanaya Ashram Campus,Koinpur * Gram Vikas Shiksha Niketan Campus,Th.Rampur * Gram Vikas Vidya Vihar Campur,Rudhapadar Gram Vikas Residential School, Kankia Robotics Workshop in Atal Tinkering Lab Students at Gram Vikas Residential School, Kankia, are encouraged to be self-reliant and participate in various daily activities of the school campus.

Life Johann Lorenz Schiedmayer was born in Erlangen in 1786, the son of the piano maker Johann David Schiedmayer. He learned his trade in his father‚Äôs workshop, and continued operating the enterprise after his father‚Äôs death in 1805. In 1806 he moved to Vienna, continuing his training under Andreas and Nannette Streicher. There he met Carl Friedrich Dieudonn√©, with whom he opened a workshop after moving in 1809 to 4 Charlottenstrasse in Stuttgart. When Friedrich Silcher moved to Stuttgart for a two-year sojourn, he lived in the house of the piano maker. This friendship lasted for many decades. In 1821, master builder Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret erected a new plant on 14-16 Neckarstrasse, today the site of the House of History and the State High School for Music and Representative Arts. After the death of Carl Friedrich Dieudonn√© in 1825, Johann Lorenz Schiedmayer continued to operate the plant by himself. He was the first piano manufacturer in Germany to use the English action. He was also one of the first employers in Stuttgart to introduce social benefits in industrial production. Together with his older sons Adolf and Hermann, Johann Lorenz founded the firm of Schiedmayer & Soehne (Schiedmayer & Sons) in 1845. He also sent his two younger sons, Julius and Paul, to Paris, where they learned the trade of harmonium manufacture from Alexandre-Fran√ßois Debain. There, they met Victor Mustel, who some years later invented the celesta. Returning to Stuttgart, they founded ‚Äì next to Schiedmayer & Soehne on 12 Neckarstrasse ‚Äì J & P Schiedmayer (later Schiedmayer Pianofortefabrik), the first harmonium manufacturing company in Germany. Upon his death in 1860, Johann Lorenz left his sons two major industrial enterprises. In 1896, at the construction of the Royal Center for Industry and Commerce ‚Äì today House of the Economy ‚Äì a plaque was installed in honor of his contributions to the economy of Southern Germany. His grave is in the Fangelsbach Cemetery and is a graced with a protected monument.

It is very concise in structure and effort than their later looser psychedelic-based material they released in the late 1960s. Background In 1965, the Sons of Champlin were a garage band but forceful band. After re- investing earnings from a Kingston trio's success into a small domain of properties and music-related corporations in the San Francisco Bay Area, one of which became known as Trident Productions, Frank Werber signed the Sons of Champlin in 1966 hoping they would be a promising success. Werber sent the band into Trident's own Columbus Recorders with crew producer Randy Steirling in late 1966 to conditionally work on a full album via a lease deal with MGM Verve. Due to a variety of difficulties, it never happened and the Sons left Trident with antipathy in June 1967. The split resulted in only two songs on Fat City that were previously released which were Sing Me a Rainbow and Fat City, which they still perform today.

His name is also given as Soffredo Errico Gaetani, whilst his Christian name is also spelled Soffrido or Goffredo in some sources. Life Born in Pistoia, he was made cardinal deacon of Santa Maria in Via Lata in the 1182 consistory. He took part in the 1185 conclave which elected pope Urban III. In 1187 he and cardinal Andrea Bobone were made papal legates to France to mediate between Philip II of France and Henry II of England - the two legates succeeded in sealing a two-year truce between the two kings. He took part in the October and December 1187 conclaves which elected pope Gregory VIII and pope Clement III. He and cardinal Pietro Diana were sent to mediate between Genoa and Pisa. He also took part in the 1191 conclave which elected pope Celestine III and that of 1198. During summer 1198 he and cardinal Pietro Capuano were chosen as papal legates to follow the crusader army which was about to set out on a new crusade. Despite this Soffredo remained in the curia and Capuano went to Venice to prepare to make the crossing. In 1201 the chapter of the metropolitan cathedral of Ravenna requested him as their archbishop, but the pope chose not to ratify this since he wished to keep the cardinal in his court in Rome. Until the end of May 1202, when he finally set out for the Holy Land, Soffredo remained in the curia and represented the prosecution in several trials. Arriving in Acre, he moved to Tripoli to end the succession dispute between Bohemond IV of Antioch and Leo II of Armenia - a conflict which had held back the crusader forces. The papal delegates spent months trying to resolve the conflict but to no avail. On 16 August 1203 the pope made Soffredo patriarch of Jerusalem, but dismissed him from the post the following year. In autumn 1204 he and Capuano moved to Constantinople, which had been in crusader hands since April the same year. Capuano remained there but Soffredo travelled on to the kingdom of Thessalonica, ruled over by Boniface I of Monferrato, to thank him for his assistance in establishing the Latin clergy in the new empire. In August 1205 Soffredo returned to the curia and on the following 5 December signed a papal privilege for the first time after his time in the Holy Land. He spent his final years in retirement, probably in Pistoia, performing minor tasks. In 1208 he was made cardinal protopresbyter.

Music of Cold Therapy is known for its dark and atmospheric sound - \\"A soundtrack to the dark side of your mind‚Äù.  History  Wola≈Ñski began releasing music in 2009, releasing several albums with two different bands before founding Cold Therapy. At first, he started making Dark Ambient music (never officially released) with his two-man group Unsinn, where he was the composer and vocalist. Finally, they ended up making Aggrotech / EBM music and released one official album in 2010. Shortly after that, his work on Unsinn ended in a controversial manner: \\"[H]e removed me from the band, took all rights, without mentioning about it. He said and wrote everywhere that I left the band by myself. And that was the end of our cooperation.\\" The second band in which Wola≈Ñski was involved was Traumatize. Another Aggrotech / EBM project, which concentrated more on making music suitable for dancefloors and DJ sets. As Traumatize, from 2010 to the end of 2012 he released 3 full albums, 1 EP and 1 single, mostly with the Spanish record label Mutant-E Records. After few years of album releases, Wola≈Ñski felt tired of the aggressive, club-oriented style of music and in need of a change, founded Cold Therapy. This was the moment he decided to make more old-school Dark Electronic music. He stated in an interview: \\"This time I wanted to make something different, something more 'personal', more into my own musical tastes, to express myself.\\" After the first album Embrace the Silence, the band was joined by a new main vocalist, Jan R., and female secondary vocalist Jen. They then released the EP Carnival of Lies and the full album Masquerade Infinite. But on March 10, 2016, both left Cold Therapy and Wola≈Ñski returned to working solo. On November 14, 2016, he released another full-length album, Figures and Faces. Masquerade Infinite is currently the most successful release of Cold Therapy has received many positive reviews, for example from Side-Line Magazine, which stated: \\"Cold Therapy clearly strives to compose a personal sound. The haunting atmospheres hanging over the songs is poignant and definitely the main force and characteristic of this work\\" and Brutal Resonance: \\"Here, Cold Therapy have created a sound that spans across quite a few eras of electro-industrial evolution.\\" Masquerade Infinite reached 4th position on the German Electronic Charts (GEWC) and entered the TOP 50 Bestsellers ranking on POPoNAUT, being in 43rd place. Cold Therapy appeared on various compilations and is well known for collaborations and remixes done for other artists, such as Suicide Commando, Wumpscut, Acylum, Shiv-r, A7ie, Die Braut, nolongerhuman, and Hydroxie.  Record label  Cold Therapy has been signed to Advoxya Records since March 22, 2015.

He completed his primary education and gained admission into St Augustine‚Äôs College Kabba in 1959.{I think there is a mistake in his secondary school. I remember vividly that Michael Olobayo was at Government College Keffi. Keffi is now in Nassarawa State but at that time it was part of Benue Province of Northern Region of Nigeria. That was how I got to know Michael Olobayo. Government College Keffi was then one of three model secondary schools of Northern Nigeria to which children from all the province were sent. I was admitted to the school in 1962 and met Michael Olobayo in form four. I do not think he attended St. Augustine's College Kabba as claimed in this write-up.) He had his higher school certificate (HSC) at St John‚Äôs College Kaduna. He was very athletic while in school and participated in several sports. He was the fastest runner in St John's College Kaduna and was named VC-10 after the fastest time in those days. He graduated from the prestigious Ahmadu Bello University with B.A Hons in History in 1970. Oba Michael Olobayo started his career in the civil service as Press Secretary in the Ministry of Information in Kwara State. From there he moved onto Government House and became the Chief of Protocol to the then Governor of Kwara State Colonel David Bamigboye. He later moved to the Ministry of Transport and Lands. It was at the Ministry of Transport and Lands he was called to ascend the throne of his forefathers in 1985 as the Obaro of Kabba. He was only forty (40) years old. His grandfather was the Obaro Ero I of Kabba, the reason why Oba Michael Olobayo is the Obaro Ero II. Oba Michael Olobayo was a man of peace and his reign witnessed a lot of progress and development in telecommunication, education and commercial sectors. Many sons and daughters of the land felt free come back home and invest.

British Parliament Library Tipu Sultan After Hyder Ali, his son Tipu Sultan took control over the territory. British rule When Wayanad was under Tipu Sultan's rule British invasion started. Tussle and turbulent times followed. The British claimed Wayanad under 1792 treaty of Srirangapatna citing it was part of Malabar. Tipu Sultan went in appeal before the Governor General. Considering his arguments, relying on the successive Karnatic rule for centuries in Wayanad and its geographical detachment from Malabar, in 1798, Governor General Lord Mornington declared by proclamationProclamation No:CLXXXLL , A. Collection of treaties and engagements , By W.Logan, Calicut 1879 that Wayanad had not been ceded to the East India Company by the treaty of 1792. Consequently, the British troops withdrew from Wayanad conceding to Tipu's rule. In 1799, after the fall of Sultan, the British handed over Wayanad by treaty of 1799 to the Raja of Mysore. But by a supplementary treaty dated 29 December 1803 the East India Company repossessed South Wayanad and thereafter administrated by Col. Arthur Wellesley from Srirangapatna. Etymology The Jain temple located at Wayanad was used as a battery (ammunition store) for Tipu Sulthan's marching armies and hence the town got its name \\"Sultan's Battery\\". Sultan Bathery was originally called as Hannaredu veethiwynad and it's peoples c gopalan nair a kannada word means twelve streets. The name was changed in the 18th century, when Tipu Sultan used the Jain Temple for his armoury (Battery). And thus the town became known as Sultan's Battery, which in Portuguese Malayalam was batheria and late became bathery. But before having the name Sulthan's Bathery, It was called \\"Ganapathi vattam\\", Which is derived from the presence of the Mahaganapathi temple of the town. 'Vattam' here means area.Accounts_and_papers_of_the_House_of_Comm see page 335 wayand report People One important characteristic feature of the Sulthan Bathery is the large adivasi population, consisting mainly of Paniyas, Kurumas, Ooralis, Kadans, Kattunaikkans are the different aboriginal tribes. The Kurmas is the most developed among them. They are small land owners, whereas the members of other tribes are mostly labourers. Wayanad district stands first in the case of adivasi population (about 36%) among other districts in the state. Sulthan Bathery has a large settler population. There are people from almost all parts of Kerala who migrated to this fertile land for building up their lives. One Third population of Sulthan bathery is constituted by Muslims. Christians constitute One fifth population, and rest of the population belongs to Hindus. Their hard work and sacrifice helped them to prosper. On the other hand, the last few decades have seen the complete marginalization of the indigenous people.

This district is divided into three towns, Kalpetta, Sultan Bathery and Mananthavady.  Religious sites  # Thirunelli Temple is an ancient temple dedicated to Lord Maha Vishnu. It is situated on the side of Brahmagiri hill in Kerala, which is about 30 kilometers away from Mananthavady (Wayanad district). The name Thirunelli derived from the nelli, the Tamil/Malayalam and Kannada word for Indian gooseberry of the Amla tree. According to tradition, Lord Brahma was traveling round the Universe on his hamsa, when he became attracted by the beauty of the area now known as Brahmagiri Hill. Descending on that spot, Brahma noticed an idol, set in an Amla tree. Brahma recognized the idol as Lord Vishnu Himself and the place as Vaikuntha (Vishnuloka) itself. With the help of the Devas, Brahma installed the idol and called it Sahyamalak Kshetra. At Brahma‚Äôs request Vishnu promised that the waters of the area would wash away all sins. (Thus, the spring and river near the temple is called Papanasini: \\"washes away all sins\\"). Even today the head priest of the temple leaves a portion of the worship materials in the belief that Lord Brahma Himself will come and perform pooja rites deep in the holy hours of morning. The famous incarnation of Lord Vishnu Parasurama is reputed to have visited Thirunelli and performed last rites of his father sage Jamadagni.

Plot Jim Henderson returns to his hometown in California with the intention of renovating and selling his late mother's house. While shopping at a supermarket, he bumps into his former high school girlfriend Amanda. The two greet each other, but Jim says he doesn't want to stop her from whatever she was up to. He bumps into her again in the parking lot and the two decide to go for coffee at a place called Blue Jay. The two discuss what has happened in their lives since they last saw each other. Amanda got married and became the stepmother to two children. Jim is working on building houses with his uncle and thinking about renovating his late mother's house. While walking Amanda to her car, the two pass a liquor store they went to frequently in their younger days. Amanda bets that the store owner will recognize them from when they were younger, although Jim disagrees. To Amanda's satisfaction, the store owner does remember the two. He remarks about how the two \\"famous lovebirds\\" are still together after two decades and gives them free beers and jelly beans, while Amanda and Jim jokingly play along about how they are still a couple after all this time. The two further discuss their current lives in depth by a lake, leaving Jim crying and feeling discontented about his life when he hears of how impressive Amanda's life sounds. The two visit his mother's house, leaving them nostalgic over the memories they shared. While rummaging through old memorabilia, Amanda discovers a letter addressed to her written years ago, and she decides to keep it. Amanda then finds tape recordings of Jim and her roleplaying their middle-aged lives. They play the recordings and laugh about how uncool they were. Jim proposes they have some \\"fun\\" and they decide to recreate the tape, pretending to be a married couple celebrating their 20th anniversary. At the end of the night, Amanda confesses to Jim she is on anti- depressants and that she has not cried in years. The two eventually share a kiss that leads to making out in the bedroom. But things are stopped when Jim reveals his residual love for her. It is then revealed dramatically that Amanda had an abortion back in high school and that was the cause of their separation. They lash out at each other, ending it with Jim breaking down and crying on the floor. Jim walks Amanda to her car the next morning, and Amanda explains her decision. Jim asks her to read the letter he didn't send her, saying he wanted to keep the baby. Amanda begins to cry, for the first time in 5 years, and then they laugh about it together. Jim and Amanda then sigh at one another and the screen cuts to black.

New York: Broadway Music Corp. and online through the Digital Collection of the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign University Library. Lyrics The song is about a dream, set in the then future year of 1953, where a veteran of World War I reflects on the year 1917 when various military troops defeated Wilhelm II of Germany. It turns out this was the dream of a school boy, day dreaming in class, who learns that Germany now no longer exists because it was wiped out during World War I (a conflict which still had to end at the time this song was recorded). LYRICS: I dreamed of a scene in an old soldier's home, The year was nineteen fifty three. With medals galore that he'd won in this war, He sat smoking peacefully. Tell me of the war of nineteen seventeen, Said his grandson who stood by his side. How did they fix up that terrible mix up? And proudly the old man replied: My dream quickly changed to a schoolroom that day, The lesson was geography. A child raised her hand, said, \\"I don't understand, This map looks all wrong to me. What is this strange place that is marked Germany?\\" And the teacher replied with a roar. \\"Why, that's an old map, dear since we had that scrap, dear, There ain't no such place anymore. The Russians were rushin' the Prussians, The Prussians were crushin' the Russians. The Balkins were balkin' and Turkey was squawkin' Rasputin disputtin' and Italy scootin' The Boches all bulled bolshevikis The British were skittish at sea. But the good Lord I'm thankin' The Yanks started yankin', And yanked Kaiser Bill up a tree. The Russians were rushin' the Prussians, The Prussians were crushin' the Russians. The good old Italians were hurling battalions Canadians raidin' and Frenchmen invadin' The Bulgars were bulgin' the Belgians But Yanks started yankin' you see. And when Peace was conceded, Some new maps were needed, They ruined the geography.  References  ;Bibliography *Parker, Bernard S. World War I Sheet Music 1.

The term includes solar, laser, and welder's retinopathy and is synonymous with retinal phototoxicity.Mainster, Martin A; Turner, Patricia L. (2006). \\"Retinal Injuries from Light: Mechanisms, Hazards, and Prevention\\". Retina (4 ed.). Elsevier Mosby. pp. 1857-70. It usually occurs due to staring at the Sun, watching a solar eclipse, or viewing an ultraviolet, Illuminant D65, or other bright light.[1]  Signs and symptoms  * Long-term reduced eyesightSefic-Kasumovic S, Firdus H, Alimanovic E, Ljaljevic S, Sefic M. \\"[Eye injuries caused by an eclipse of the sun].\\" Med Arh. 2000;54(1):41-4. Kallmark FP, Ygge J. \\"Photo-induced foveal injury after viewing a solar eclipse.\\" Acta Ophthalmol Scand. 2005 Oct;83(5):586-9. * Central or paracentral scotoma Vision loss due to solar retinopathy is typically reversible, lasting for as short as one month to over one year. The fundus changes are variable and usually bilateral, mild cases often show no alteration and moderate to severe cases show a foveal yellow spot on the first days after exposure. After a few days it is replaced by a reddish dot often surrounded by pigment. Permanent holes and lesions are possible; prognosis worsens with dilated pupils or prolonged exposure.  Pathophysiology  Although it is frequently claimed that the retina is burned by looking at the Sun, retinal damage appears to occur primarily due to photochemical injury rather than thermal injury. The temperature rise from looking at the Sun with a 3-mm pupil only causes a 4 ¬∞C increase in temperature, insufficient to photocoagulate. The energy is still phototoxic: since light promotes oxidation, chemical reactions occur in the exposed tissues with unbonded oxygen molecules. It also appears that central serous retinopathy can be a result of a depression in a treated solar damaged eye.Chen JC, Lee LR. \\"Solar retinopathy and associated optical coherence tomography findings.\\" Clin Exp Optom. 2004 Nov;87(6):390-3.

The duration of exposure necessary to cause injury varies with the intensity of light, and also affects the possibility and length of recovery Diagnosis A person with photic retinopathy may notice an impairment in their vision, for example a spot that does not go away after a reasonable recovery time, or blurring. They may also have eye pain or headaches. Vision impairment is usually in both eyes, but can be in just one. Impairment of a person with 20/20 vision usually ends up being about 20/40 or 20/60, but can be better or far worse.Solar Retinopathy: Etiology, Diagnosis, and Treatment A doctor examining an eye with retinopathy may be able to see no signs at all, or a slight macular edema, which is a sort of blister on or under the macula, an oval colored spot normally visible to an eye doctor on each person's retina. But while even that edema goes away, within a few days the patient will generally develop a discoloration of the retina at the injured point, often yellow or white, turning red over the next few weeks. Treatment Photic retinopathy generally goes away on its own over time, but there is no specific treatment known to be reliable for speeding recovery. One path sometimes attempted, which has unclear results, is to treat the initial macular edema with corticosteroids. Prognosis Generally speaking, people diagnosed with photic retinopathy recover visual acuity completely within two months,Solar Retinopathy ‚Äî American Academy of Ophthalmology though more severe cases may take longer, or not see complete recovery at all.

While she was a younger woman, modest family circumstances ruled out an academic career. During the 1920s she worked for the post office in Hamburg as a telegrapher and became a political activist (KPD), serving at least three prison terms during the twelve Nazi years because of her resistance to the r√©gime. Life Hedwig Therese Dorothea Henriette Voegt was born in the central Hamburg quarter of St. Pauli. Her father was a plumber. Despite her obvious intelligence, she received only basic schooling before moving on to train for clerical work in the dispatches department of the Hamburg Telegraph Union. She moved on again, in 1920, to work for the post office. In 1925 Hedwig Voegt joined the Communist Party. She took up journalism, writing as Labour Correspondent for the :de:Hamburger Volkszeitung, a local communist party newspaper. She also produced the illegal works newspaper of the Hamburg telephone office. By the later 1920s she had found a clear purpose in the need to resist the seemingly unstoppable rise of populist demagoguery, which her journalistic contributions enabled her to fulfill. In the Autumn of 1931, as Germany's political crisis intensified, Hedwig Voegt was arrested in connection with her political activity for the first time. In January 1933 the political backdrop was transformed when the Nazi Party took power and converted Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Political activity - except in support of the Nazi Party - became illegal. At the end of February the Reichstag fire was instantly blamed on the Communists, and in March 1933 leading Communists began to be arrested or fled into exile. On 12 September 1933 Voegt was released from her job with the post office as a consequence of the recently enacted \\"Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service\\" (\\"Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums\\"), a law designed to remove from public service those individuals whom the r√©gime deemed unreliable for reasons of race and / or politics. This gave her more time for her (now illegal) work for the Communist Party. She was arrested again in December 1934 and sentenced a few months later, to a two-year jail term for \\"preparing high treason\\" (Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat). She served her sentence initially at the Fuhlsb√ºttel concentration camp, and then at the women's prison on the east side of L√ºbeck. It was here that she got to know Lucie Suhling when the two of them worked together in the prison library. Many years later Lucie Suhling's daughter published a biography of Voegt.Ursula Suhling: Rebellische Literatur ‚Äì Quelle moralischer Kraft: Hedwig Voegt (1903‚Äì1988). Hamburg: Willi-Bredel- Gesellschaft, 2007 Voegt was released in 1937 and, despite being kept under close surveillance, was able to resume her resistance work. She was re- arrested in December 1938, and held in Fuhlsb√ºttel concentration camp till the end of March 1939. A further period of detention followed in the summer of 1941. War ended in May 1945 and with it the Nazi r√©gime and its ban on the Communist Party. Voegt resumed her political work and became a member of the party leadership team in the Wasserkante (Waterside) region (which included Hamburg). She took work with the Hamburg regional Labour Exchange. In 1946 she resumed her contributions for the :de:Hamburger Volkszeitung (newspaper). A longstanding desire to undertake university level studies was addressed at the end of 1948 when the party sent her to study in the Soviet occupation zone in the central portion of what had been Germany till 1945. In 1949 she began a new life at the Goethe-Schiller Archive in Weimar where she became a research assistant for the newly appointed director of the archive, Professor Gerhard Scholz. She went on to enroll at Jena University also finding time along the way to undertake a course in journalism at Leipzig University. In 1949 she also joined the recently formed Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED) which by now was well on the way to becoming the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. In 1952 Hedwig Voegt received her doctorate from the University of Jena for a dissertation entitled \\"Democratic Patriotism in German Jacobin literature (1790-1800)\\" (\\"Der demokratische Patriotismus in der deutschen jakobinischen Literatur (1790-1800)\\"). The choice of subject would have a defining effect on the rest of her career. Her doctorate, for which she was supervised by Gerhard Scholz, earned her a \\"Cum Laude\\" commendation.Ursula Suhling, S. 30; Ralph Jessen: Akademische Elite und kommunistische Diktatur. Die ostdeutsche Hochschullehrerschaft in der Ulbricht-√Ñra. Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, G√∂ttingen 1999, p. 343. In 1953 she received a contract at Leipzig University to teach on German Literature. Literature and history fell within the Philosophy faculty, but in 1955 she was switched to the university's political important Journalism Faculty, which was the country's principal university level university faculty for journalists and, because of this, the focus of constant attention from the powerful Party Central Committee. Between 1959 and 1963 Hedwig Voegt was the Teaching Professor for Literary Journalism and Stylistics at the Leipzig University Journalism Faculty. Here she also served, between 1961 and 1963, as the Pro-dean for Academic Succession (\\"f√ºr den wissenschaftlichen Nachwuchs\\"). Having come to her academic career relatively late in life, Voegt was bewildered that when she reached her sixtieth birthday in 1963 she was nevertheless required to retire from her university teaching post. An idea existed that she might return to Hamburg where she had spent her early decades, but by this times the political and philosophical division of Germany (reinforced by a formidable set of physical barriers) was at its most profound, and there was never any serious doubt that now, spiritually and politically, her true home was in the German Democratic Republic, in Leipzig. From here she continued to publish on her literary areas of expertise: late eighteenth century authors on whom she published books included Johann Heinrich Vo√ü, , Johann Heinrich Merck, and Adolph Freiherr Knigge. A prolific letter writer, she also sustained scholarly friendships with academics and other comrades in Hamburg. After her retirement from her teaching post Dr Hedwig Voegt continued to work intensively for another 25 years. She died in Leipzig on 14 March 1988.

Later, he joined Giorgi Saakadze's (Murav Beg) anti-Persian uprising in 1625‚Äì26, switched sides to join Teimuraz I of Kakheti (Tahmuras Khan) against Saakadze, but was eventually murdered by his new ally. Biography Zurab Erietavi was amongst the highest ranking Georgian nobles at the time. He was the son of Nugzar I (1600-1611) and had one older brother named Baadur (Bahadur). In 1619, with the help of the Safavid troops and the Safavid-appointed ruler in Tiflis, Semayun Khan (Simon II), Zurab managed to drive his elder brother Bahadur out of Bazaleti. Receiving further aid from them, he started to conduct raids against the people of Mtiuleti and the Khevi; he managed to submit these countries, and became notoriously powerful. Through the marriage of his daughter to Giorgi Saakadze, Saakadze had become the son-in-law of Zurab Eristavi. Zurab himself was the son-in-law of Teimuraz I, through his marriage to Darejan in 1623. When in 1624 Safavid king Abbas I (r. 1588‚Äî1629) decided to marry his granddaughter to Semayun Khan, the Safavid ruler of Kartli, Sohrab Eristavi and Abd-ol-Ghaffar Amilakhori entertained the guests in the third term of the wedding party on the order of Murav Beg. During the Battle of Martqopi, Zurab and Giorgi Saakadze led the Georgian troops. Zurab led a charge with his main forces after Qarachaqay Khan and the other Safavid Iranian commanders had been killed by Saakadze and his son Avtandil (supported by his Georgian escorts), which resulted in the virtual annihilation of the leaderless Iranian troops. When in the summer of 1626 the final \\"rupture\\" between Teimuraz I and Giorgi Saakadze occurred, Zurab Eristavi joined the side of the Teimuraz. However, in 1630 Zurab was killed on the orders of Teimuraz I, shortly after the king had instigated the duke to murder the Safavid-sponsored ruler of Kartli, Semayun Khan. Zurab was succeeded as duke (eristavi) of Aragvi by his younger brother, known by his dynastic name of David I.

She was also an accomplished cellist. In the 1930s, she won two federal commissions to complete post office murals for the Public Works Art Project of the Treasury Department. Her work is representative of the Ashcan school and Social Realism art movements of American Art. Early life Marian Jordan Gilmore was born on May 7, 1909 in Ottumwa, Iowa to Ethel (n√©e Jordan) and Merrill C. Gilmore. She grew up in Ottumwa, where her father was a prominent attorney. Gilmore was an accomplished cellist and throughout her life played in concerts and trios around Ottumwa, as well as playing in the Parsons College Symphony Orchestra and the Southeast Iowa Symphony Orchestra. She studied cello in Des Moines at Drake University and also later in New York. After completing high school, Gilmore attended the University of Kentucky in 1927, studying art under Carol Sax. She then studied at the School of Fine Arts and Crafts in Boston and the Rochester Athenaeum and Mechanics Institute. Gilmore moved to New York City and studied simultaneously at the Phoenix Art Institute under Franklin Booth and Norman Rockwell and at the Art Students League of New York. In 1932, she studied during the summer at the Stone City Art Colony under Grant Wood. In 1937, Gilmore studied at the American Academy of Art in Chicago and subsequently enrolled at the Art Institute of Chicago. Career In 1938, Gilmore produced a work, featuring Chief Wapello, to commemorate Air-mail Week for the Ottumwa post office. The cachet was used on all mail sent from the Ottumwa post office during the 20th anniversary of the launch of air mail service in the U.S. In 1939, Gilmore was teaching art to children at the Ottumwa Community Art Center with Robert Hulse, who she would marry in 1943. She won the commission to produce a mural for the town of Corning, Iowa in 1939. The painting was featured in Life as part of an article on 48 murals to be produced for each of the contiguous U.S. States. Gilmore's mural featured a scene she had sketched at a band concert in Hedrick, Iowa. Though she won the competition for Band Concert with a cannon and an obelisk included in the sketch, residents of Corning complained that the design did not accurately reflect their town. Gilmore was forced to alter her mural to remove the cannon and obelisk, though she did add decorative landscaping, rather than the buildings which could actually be seen behind the bandstand. In 1941, Gilmore won the competition to complete the post office mural in Corydon, Iowa. The mural, Volunteer Fire Department, was completed in 1942 and features a 1928 Continental fire engine, which was the actual truck used by the town's fire department. While the original mural remains in the post office, a replica of the mural and the original truck are part of an exhibit found in the Prairie Trails Museum of Wayne County. After her marriage, Gilmore began using the professional gender-neutral name Mion Hulse. In 1943, her husband, Robert, worked on an exhibit at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and the following year was hired as an instructor at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. The couple lived there until moving to Long Island, New York in 1952. Gilmore worked in both fine arts, painting and sculpting, and in illustration and design. Her paintings fall into the Ashcan and Social Realism schools and often depict their images in a humorous way. Her work was widely exhibited and included in collections and galleries. Some of the best representations of her work include \\"Children in Washington Park\\", \\"Fischer's Tavern\\", \\"Ham & Eggs - 45¬¢\\" and \\"Yard Sale\\", all of which were included in a posthumous exhibit hosted by the Seiderman Gallery in Lynbrook, New York in 1995.

It was released on July 25, 2016. Background The song was first released on July 25, 2016, as a means of capitalizing on the band's nationwide publicity the week prior from their comments regarding the Republican Party. On July 19, 2016, the band had played a benefit concert for \\"Musicians on Call\\", a charity organization, in close proximity to the Republican National Convention. Band frontman Stephan Jenkins took the opportunity to speak out against the Republican Party, criticizing their views on science and LGBT rights between songs, and performing songs with the band that were specifically critical of their stances, including \\"Jumper\\", and \\"Non-Dairy Creamer\\". The video of the event went viral, inspiring the band to release a political single as a response. Writing and recording  The song was written and recorded as part of their We Are Drugs EP, where the band locked themselves in a studio for a week in Texas in mid 2016. The song was one of many that went from inception to finish in that week, in stark contrast to the band's usual approach of recording albums over the course of 4‚Äì6 years. The sessions were not particularly politically or socially charged on a whole, but rather, the only theme to the sessions was that there were no boundaries or preconceived notions about the direction of the music. Themes and composition The song's lyrics touch on the topics of social justice, police brutality, Black Lives Matter, and racism. The song makes many allusions to a 2015 incident at South Carolina's Spring Valley High School, where a police officer violently removed an African American student from class. Specifically, the song takes a pro-Black Lives Matter stance, with lyrics of \\"On the classroom floor, there's a little blood splatter / Why's it so hard to say Black Lives Matter? / Doesn't mean that you're anti-white / Take it from me, I'm super fucking white.\\" Jenkins, the band's principal lyricist, stated that the incident had hit him particularly hard due his time prior to being in Third Eye Blind, when he held a job caring for mentally disturbed children at a school. The Spring Valley incident horrified him, because he was always instructed to be cautious and calm with students, even during violent outbursts, in stark contrast to the events at Spring Valley. Despite this, Jenkins still asserts that the song is not meant to be \\"anti-police\\", also citing the lines \\"I am all for the good fight / And if the cops roll by, throw a peace sign.\\" \\"Cop vs. Phone Girl\\" is a mid-tempo, rhythmic singalong-type song. Reception The music website Stereogum was critical of style of the lyrics, calling them as \\"handled so bluntly that what should be a meaningful declaration of support ends up sounding like a joke\\", but ended up conceding that the song's lyrics were a net positive \\"if it convinces one person to forsake their willfully ignorant and/or racist All Lives Matter rhetoric in favor of empathy.\\" New Noise Magazine described the track as the most \\"incendiary\\" song of the summer, calling the lyrics both \\"nightmarish and uplifting\\", concluding that it was \\"a testament to Jenkins' songwriting mastery, he still finds a way to chide hope into a dark narrative, and creates something anthemic out of viscously specific details.\\" Personnel ;Band *Stephan Jenkins ‚Äì lead vocals, rhythm guitar *Kryz Reid ‚Äì lead guitar, backing vocals *Alex LeCavalier ‚Äì bass *Alex Kopp ‚Äì keyboard *Brad Hargreaves ‚Äì drums References 2016 singles 2016 songs Third Eye Blind songs Songs written by Stephan Jenkins Megaforce Records singles ","title":"Cop vs. Phone Girl"},{"id":"51178593","text":"Farnworth is a town in Greater Manchester, England.

Kurtz Thomas G. Kurtz (born 14 July 1941 in Kansas City, Missouri, USA) is an emeritus professor of Mathematics and Statistics at University of Wisconsin-Madison known for his research contributions to many areas of probability theory and stochastic processes. In particular, Prof. Kurtz‚Äôs research focuses on convergence, approximation and representation of several important classes of Markov processes. His findings appear in scientific disciplines such as systems biology, population genetics, telecommunications networks and mathematical finance.  Education  Kurtz obtained his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1967 under the supervision of James L. McGregor. As an undergraduate student he attended University of Missouri where he graduated in 1963 with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics. Prof. Kurtz is also an alumnus of La Plata High School in La Plata, Missouri.  Academic career  After completing his Ph.D. in 1967, Prof. Kurtz joined the Department of Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison where he remained for his entire career. He received a joint appointment in the Statistics department in 1985. In 1996, he was awarded the WARF-University Houses Professorship, which he chose to identify as the Paul L√©vy Professorship to honor one of the founders of modern probability theory. At UW Madison, Prof. Kurtz served as the Mathematics Department Chair from 1985 to 1988 and as the Director of the Center for Mathematical Sciences from 1990 to 1996. He retired from active teaching in 2008 but he continues to work as an emeritus professor. During his academic career Prof. Kurtz has supervised twenty-nine Ph.D. students and lectured extensively at UW Madison and elsewhere. For almost a decade, he organized a Summer Internship Program in Madison, which helped in grooming the next generation of Probabilists. Prof. Kurtz has given several invited seminars and tutorials around the world. Over the years he has also held many visiting positions, which include: * Nelder Visiting Fellow, Imperial College, London, U.K. April‚ÄìMay 2016. * Guest Professor, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany, May‚ÄìJune, 2013. * Visiting Fellow, Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Cambridge, U.K, February‚ÄìMay, 2010. * Very Important Visitor (VIV), Institute for Mathematics and its Applications, Minneapolis, 2003‚Äì2004. * Visiting Professor, Stanford University, April‚ÄìJune, 1989 * Visiting Professor, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, January‚ÄìMarch, 1989 * Visiting Professor, Universit√© de Strasbourg, France, 1977‚Äì1978. * Visiting Fellow, Australian National University, Canberra, 1973. Prof. Kurtz has served in many scientific committees and Editorial boards of academic journals. He is currently a trustee of the Mathematical Biosciences Institute in Columbus, Ohio.  Awards and honors  Prof. Kurtz is a former President of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (2005‚Äì2006) and a former editor of the Annals of Probability (2000‚Äì2002). He is a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS) and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was chosen to give the Wald Memorial Lectures in 2014 at the IMS Annual Meeting in Sydney, Australia. He was elected as a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in the 2020 Class, for \\"research in probability and its applications, especially for contributions to the study of Markov processes\\".  Publications  In his five decades of research, Prof. Kurtz has published more than 100 peer- reviewed articles in prominent mathematical journals. He has also authored four books, which are as follows: # Markov Processes: Characterization and Convergence (John Wiley & Sons Inc. 1986): This book with his former Ph.D. student Prof. Stewart Ethier is one of Prof. Kurtz‚Äôs most well-known work and it is a standard reference for advanced theory of Markov processes. This book develops an intricate, yet elegant mathematical framework for establishing the convergence of Markov processes and characterising the limiting process. # Stochastic Analysis of Biochemical Systems (Springer 2015): This book with Prof. David Anderson provides a timely survey of the wide array of methods and techniques that can be employed to analyze stochastic models of chemical reaction networks. Such models are frequently encountered in the rapidly growing field of Systems Biology. Mindful of the interdisciplinary nature of the research community in this field, the authors present the material in such a way that it is accessible to anyone who is familiar with the standard undergraduate mathematics curriculum. # Large Deviations for Stochastic Processes (American Mathematical Society 2006): This book with his former Ph.D. student Prof. Jin Feng, presents a general theory for obtaining large deviation results for a large class of stochastic processes. This theory is based on the idea that the large deviation principle for a sequence of Markov processes can be obtained by proving the convergence of an associated family of nonlinear semigroups. To overcome the formidable theoretical challenge of proving this convergence of nonlinear semigroups, the authors employ tools from the modern theory of viscosity solutions that has been developed for solving partial differential equation. With these viscosity methods, the authors demonstrate that large deviation results can be readily derived using their approach for a range of interesting examples. # Approximation of Population Processes (Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics 1981): This book provides a self-contained treatment of the limiting behavior of a wide class of population processes as the population-size approaches infinity. Diffusion approximation results are developed for population processes on a very general state-space, thereby allowing the results to be applied in a variety of examples from Branching Processes, Population Genetics, Epidemics and Chemical Reaction Networks. Furthermore, random time-change formulas are introduced that provide sample path representations of complicated stochastic processes in terms of its simpler counterparts such as Poisson processes or Brownian motions. These formulas are used to derive approximation results and also examine the relationship between the stochastic process and the corresponding deterministic process in the ‚Äúlaw of large numbers‚Äù limit.

Biography Christel Dillbohner was born in Cologne, Germany, where she studied art at the Cologne Art School (K√∂lner Werkschulen), receiving her degree in 1984. Since the mid 1980s, she has lived principally in the United States, first in Los Angeles, California (1986‚Äì96), and subsequently in the San Francisco Bay Area. Dillbohner's principal media are painting, installation, and assemblage. Field research is a central part of her artistic process and has taken her to Japan, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Great Britain, New Zealand, and Australia. Her emphasis on art as a transformational undertaking, as well as her use of highly tactile materials such as wax, tar, silk cocoons, and old wood, show the influence on her work of Joseph Beuys. Other influences include the German artists Gerhard Richter, Rebecca Horn and Wolfgang Laib. Dillbohner's thematic, site-specific installations generally meld painting, various forms of assemblage, and works on and made of paper to create what one curator has termed \\"landscapes of the psyche\\". An installation inspired by Nepalese honey hunters, The Honey Gatherers (1993), featured large suspended conical forms, sheets of beeswax-impregnated rice paper covering the windows, and assemblages of burlap, felt, coal, rusted metal, and other materials. A series of installations entitled Sippwells in the early 2000s, inspired by Australian Aboriginal culture, featured encaustic paintings and large hanging sheets of perforated waxed paper, while the titular sip wells (depressions scraped in damp sand) were represented by shallow clay bowls set out in a row in a layer of crushed charcoal. A central element of her 2005 installation Histologies was 365 paper filter cones suspended just above the floor with monofilament, creating a sea of shapes that swayed in response to the gallery's slightest air movements. In her assemblages, Dillbohner subjects discarded objects and natural material like seeds and bones to transformations that highlight their function as carriers of memory and sources of renewal. In her 2007 assemblage Timekeeper, for example, she offers a composition of used teabags and silkworm cocoons as a meditation on the passage of time. Dillbohner's paintings adhere loosely to the genre of landscape but \\"oscillate between abstraction and representation.\\" Often painted using encaustic techniques, they evoke flowing water, massed clouds, ice fields, sedimentary rock, and other natural forms. Recent series of paintings include Lost Coast (2014) and Glacial Sea (2011-12). Projecting a sense of being both depthless and expansive, they hearken back to the spirit of German Romanticism. She has exhibited at numerous museums and galleries in the United States, Germany, and Japan, including the Monterey Museum of Art, San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art, Fresno Art Museum, and Berkeley Art Center (all in California), the Boise (Idaho) Art Museum, Galerie Zeitzone (Berlin), Hafenmuseum (Bremen), Gallery Hirawata (Tokyo), and many others. She is a longtime Associate of the Los Angeles‚Äìbased Institute of Cultural Inquiry and co-author of the ICI Press's 2007 book Searching for Sebald: Photography after W.G. Sebald. Her work is featured in several books on encaustic painting.

Duignan (1934), \\"The Ui Bri√∫in Br√©ifni genealogies\\", pp. 90‚Äì137, in JRSAI Vol. LXIV His mother was May M√≥r O‚ÄôRuairc, the daughter of Amla√≠b O'Ruairc, king of West Breifne from 1257‚Äì1258. His brothers included Brian ‚ÄòBreaghach‚Äô M√°g Samhradh√°in (whom he succeeded as chieftain) and Macraith M√°g Samhradh√°in, the ancestor of two McGovern bishops (Cormac M√°c Shamhradh√°in of Ardagh and Cormac M√°g Shamhradh√°in of Kilmore). Chieftainship On the death of his brother Brian ‚ÄòBreaghach‚Äô M√°g Samhradh√°in on 3 May 1294, Maghnus took the chieftaincy and moved to Coologe castle. He must have been involved in a conflict five years later as he was killed in 1299. The Book of Magauran The castle of Maghnus at Coologe was one of the stops on the medieval Irish poetic circuit. It attracted poets from all over Ireland and even as far away as Scotland. A poet would leave his own house, where he often ran a poet's school, and set off on circuit. When arriving at a lord's castle he would be given free food and board in exchange for entertaining the lord and his guests. If the lord agreed, then the poet would compose a praise poem in the chief's honour which would then be recited in front of the assembled guests and afterwards transcribed into the chief's family poem book or Duanaire, along with the poems of previous poets. In return the chief would pay the poet with cattle or a horse or gold. The poet would then leave and visit another lord's castle on the circuit, eventually returning to his own home laden with gifts. The McGovern Duanaire or Book of Magauran is the oldest such Duanaire still surviving. The earliest poem in the book was composed in honour of Brian ‚ÄòBreaghach‚Äô M√°g Samhradh√°in c.1290 and the latest poem is in honour of Niall M√°g Samhradh√°in, the son of Tom√°s, composed about 1362. Poem number 11 in the book is dedicated to Maghnus. It was composed by Raghnall √ì'hUiginn (d.1325) from the noted poetic O'Higgins family. Personal appearance According to poem number 11 in the Book of Magauran, Maghnus had hyacinth-blue eyes. He wore a purple cloak and a gold ring on his finger. He bought his wine from a wine merchant who sailed up to Lough MacNean at the northern extremity of the territory of Maghnus. He drank the wine from a gold cup decorated with filigree-work. He suffered from many wounds which he had received in battles. When fighting he wore a long sword carried in a dark leather sheath. He also fought with axes and with spears made of ash-wood and tipped with blued-steed points. There were satin tapestries in his castle which were decorated with golden-tailed birds. His favourite poem was Eire Ard Inis na Riogh by Giolla Coemhain. Maghnus liked to go to sleep to the sound of music from brass- stringed harps and lyres. He loved his pack of hounds. Death Maghnus was killed in 1299 but some annals give a later date. The Annals of Ulster for the year 1299 state- Maghnus Mag Shamhradhain, chief of TellachEathach, died. The Annals of the Four Masters under the year 1303 state- Manus Magauran, Chief of Teallach Eachdhach Tullyhaw, in the county of Cavan died. The Annals of Loch C√© under the year 1303 state- Maghnus Mac Shamhradhain, dux of Tellach-Echach, occisus est. The Annals of Connacht for 1303 state- Magnus Mag Samradain, chieftain of Tullyhaw, was killed. Family Maghnus was married to Orlaidh, the daughter of Muireadhach of the M√°igh, but there is no mention of any children in the genealogies.

He gained recognition after winning a gold medal at the Youth Commonwealth Games in 2008.  Early life  Parveen, son of Udaybhan Rana and Rajbala, was born in the village Qutubgarh, Delhi. His father identified his skills at an early age . He started wrestling at the age of five, under the guidance of his elder brother, Naveen Rana, who is a civil engineer. He currently trains in Philadelphia in United States under the guidance of Olympian medalist Yogeshwarr Dutt. Yogeshwar Dutt is role model of Parveen Rana . His wrestling relies primarily on swift counter-attacks.  Wrestling career  Rana first gained international attention when he won a gold medal at the 3rd Youth Commonwealth Games in 2008. He went on to win a bronze medal in the 2011 Junior Wrestling World Championship in Bucharest, followed by the 66 kg freestyle title at the 2012 Hari Ram Indian Grand Prix Wrestling Championships, when he was 20 years old. In 2013, he won gold medals at the Senior National Wrestling Championship in Kolkata and the Commonwealth Wrestling Championship in Johannesburg. In June 2014, Rana sustained a career- threatening neck injury, but made a remarkable comeback to win the gold medal at the Senior National Games and represent India in the 70 kg category at the 2014 Asian Games. The following year, he was the first Indian male wrestler acquired by the Punjab Royals franchise of the Pro Wrestling League. Rana was chosen to represent India at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro after the earlier qualifier, Narsingh Pancham, failed a doping test. However, the decision was reversed after Pancham was cleared by the National Anti-Doping Agency.

Description In 2015, the Caledonian Sleeper service, which had formed part of the ScotRail franchise, was split into a separate operation, with Serco as the new franchise operator. As part of the franchise agreement, Serco was committed to procuring new rolling stock to replace the operation's existing fleet of Mark 2 and Mark 3 passenger coaches. In February 2015, Serco signed a ‚Ç¨200m deal with CAF to purchase 75 coaches of five different types. These will be formed into a total of four 16-coach trains (London Euston to Fort William, Inverness and Aberdeen, London Euston to Edinburgh and Glasgow, plus the two respective return services), plus two coaches for Fort Willam-Edinburgh-Fort William, with nine coaches as spares, and will be hauled by locomotives between London and Glasgow/Edinburgh, and s on unelectrified routes. The new vehicles will be the first new locomotive-hauled passenger coaches introduced onto the British network since the Mark 4 vehicles on the East Coast Main Line as part of the InterCity 225 sets in 1989-1992. The first five cars began testing on the Velim railway test circuit in the Czech Republic in August 2017, before being delivered to Polmadie TRSMD in January 2018.

These included a separate lounge car, seated car, hybrid 'POD' / sleeper car, Pod car, PRM Sleeper car, and regular Sleeper car. However, due to safety concerns later arising over POD seating (air-craft style first class compartments) being incompatible with railway crash worthiness regulations, Serco opted to modify the Mk5 order by requesting that both POD dedicated and POD hybrid coaches instead be constructed as regular sleeping vehicles. Lounge Car (RLO) There are a total of 11 lounge vehicles. Each has the following features: *Dining space for up to 30 passengers, including two wheelchair spaces *Seven restaurant-style dining booths; two of which include 180 degree seating for five passengers, two with a capacity for four passengers, three for two passengers each including one for wheelchair users. *Seven stools for solo travellers, with swivel function to face diagonally into the direction of travel. *One galley with fully operational kitchen Seated Car (FO) There are a total of 11 seated vehicles.

Greenwood, 'Discovering Some of the Roots of Taylor's Shop Management: Taylor's Secret Six-Year Study of the Building Trades' Proceedings of the Midwest Academy of Management (1981)'Stopwatch: Frederick Winslow Taylor and the 'Taylorization' of America (1999) on IMDb entry these studies' influence on subsequent workplaces have long been harder to determine.George Soule, Economic Forces in American History (1952) argues that 'As a separate movement it (Taylorism) virtually disappeared in the great depression of the 1930s, but by that time knowledge of it had become widespread in industry and its methods and philosophy were commonplaces in many schools of engineering and business management'. argues that 'A comprehensive and detailed outline of the principles of Taylorism is essential to our narrative, not because of the things for which it is popularly known - stopwatch, speed-up, etc. - but because behind these commonplaces there lies a theory which is nothing less than the explicit verbalization of the capitalist mode of production ... It is impossible to overestimate the importance of the scientific management movement in the shaping of the modern corporation and indeed all institutions of capitalist society which carry on labor processes ... Taylorism dominates the world of production.'Michael Rowlinson, 'The early application of scientific management by Cadbury' Business History (1988) concludes that 'It is hard to say whether Cadbury was applying scientific management at Bournville because it is hard to identify exactly what scientific management is. If time-study symbolised scientific management, then Cadbury was implementing it.'Daniel Nelson, A Mental Revolution: Scientific Management Since Taylor (1992) Recent research has revealed that the core purpose of Taylor's time studies was to produce Unit-Times data, as espoused in his Shop Management (1903)See F.

Life and work Dick Wilson (he used the familiar form of his name throughout his professional life) was born in Epsom, Surrey the son of Ernest Garratt Wilson and Eileen Olive Ruscoe. The family lived at nearby Sutton but in 1939 moved to Guildford where Dick entered the Royal Grammar School, Guildford. In 1942 he was sent to Cranleigh School where he remained until 1947 when he was called up for National Service and this was followed by his degree course at Oxford. In 1952 he entered International House, Berkeley California studying law. In 1953 he followed this with extensive travels in Southeast Asia before returning to live in London.Mills, John, Which Yet Survive: Impressions of Friends, Family and Encounters, Quartet Books, London, 2017 He worked for the Financial Times for four years before joining the Far Eastern Economic Review in Hong Kong as Editor in 1958.

With his wife Sally he moved into a detached Georgian house in Grove Lane, Camberwell and they adopted two children, Emma and Ben. The first of his many books on China, A Quarter of Mankind, was published in 1966. In 1975 he also took on the editorship of The China Quarterly, continuing until 1980. Wilson had suffered a serious illness during his early travelling years and in later life this led to his posture becoming more and more stooped. However he continued writing well into the 2000s, turning his attention mostly to the Indian subcontinent, but this work appears to remain unpublished. He died in hospital in January 2011.

Sinemia advertises a variety of subscription types, including those allowing users to watch movies in every format available (2D ‚Äì 3D ‚Äì IMAX ‚Äì 4DX ‚Äì DBOX ‚Äì ScreenX) at any movie theater with no limitation on the dates or movie showtimes, however the service has been plagued with problems. Sinemia is the only international movie-ticket subscription service that operated in the UK, Canada, Turkey and Australia alongside the US. Sinemia ceased operations in the US on April 26, 2019.https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/25/sinemia/ https://www.sinemia.com/ (archived) The company stated it was the subject of a pending FTC investigation in its US bankruptcy filing, and a class-action lawsuit was filed against Sinemia over fees. Sinemia also came under fire for requiring its users to provide photo identification, social security numbers and other personal information, termination of subscriber accounts without apparent cause as well as app errors which many believed were intentionally designed to slow use of the app, and that the company was able to selectively \\"fix\\" on a subscriber-by-subscriber basis depending upon how widely and frequently such customer complained on Twitter and other platforms. Service The Sinemia app could be downloaded on iPhone, Android and Windows Phone devices. Upon purchase of a plan, a user's Sinemia membership began. However an activation period of ten days applied before users could use the service by choosing their preferred movie and theater in the Sinemia app, unless users paid an additional fee to start using the service right away. The app provided virtual credit card numbers members could use to purchase movie tickets online, however convenience fees charged by services like Atom and Fandango would be charged to the member's credit card separately. Sinemia's ‚ÄúRollover‚Äù feature allowed users to roll over unused movie ticket credits to the next month. The feature was applicable for both one-person plans and family plans. In March 2019, Sinemia introduced and heavily promoted the ‚ÄúSinemia Limitless‚Äù feature, which claimed to allow users to purchase tickets with a one-time payment at the location of their choosing without using the Sinemia app. This feature promised an option for movie goers who prefer not getting involved in subscriptions but charged a hefty $49.95 initiation fee, and up to a $19.95 card activation fee, and many users claimed their memberships were not activated until many weeks after their purchase. Despite Sinemia formerly calling Moviepass's \\"Unlimited plan\\" unsustainable, Sinemia nonetheless introduced its own Unlimited plan in the US, UK, Canada and Australia in 2018, which claimed to allow users to watch a movie every day with their membership. Additional Features Advance Ticket Feature Sinemia developed a feature allowing customers to buy movie tickets online in advance of the show date, however its service fees (above and beyond the monthly cost advertised) became the source of much controversy (see section below). Sinemia Social Sinemia Social was a content platform for movie-related content such as news, specially curated movie lists, and had planned to offer a database for actors, actresses, trailers, and movies. History * In 2014, Sinemia was founded by entrepreneur Rƒ±fat Oƒüuz. * In 2016, Sinemia received an investment from 500 Startups and raised $1.5M for its initial US expansion led by Revo Capital. * In 2018, Sinemia announced the Unlimited plan in the UK, US, Canada and Australia, allowing the users to watch a movie every day. * In October 2018, movie-ticket subscription company Sinemia announced it would begin to offer its tech to movie theaters so they could craft their own personalized subscription plans through its software platform, Sinemia Enterprise. * In January 2019, Sinemia introduced the Rollover feature. * In March 2019, Sinemia introduced the ‚ÄúLimitless‚Äù feature. *On April 19, 2019, Sinemia faced a second class action lawsuit. This lawsuit claimed the company terminated user accounts for no reason and did not offer any type of refund. * On April 24, 2019, Bloomberg reported that Sinemia was considering closing down its subscription service to focus more attention on creating similar programs for theater chains, according to sources familiar with the matter. * On April 26, 2019 the company posted a letter on its website indicating that it will be \\"closing its doors and ending operations in the US effective immediately.\\" * On April 27, 2019 the company declared bankruptcy and confirmed that it is under FTC investigation.  Controversy  Error message commonly experienced by Sinemia app users. FTC Investigation On April 27, 2019, Sinemia confirmed that it was under \\"pending\\" Federal Trade Commission investigation. While the FTC would neither confirm nor deny the investigation, the FTC's role in \\"stopping unfair, deceptive or fraudulent practices in the marketplace\\" matches many of the complaints logged by users. Class-Action Lawsuit In November 2018, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Sinemia alleging a \\"bait and switch\\" scheme over a new $1.80 per ticket processing fee charged to customers who had prepaid annual memberships. \\"[Sinemia] lures consumers in by convincing them to purchase a purportedly cheaper movie subscription, and then adds undisclosed fees that make such purchases no bargain at all,\\" the lawsuit claims. \\"Sinemia fleeces consumers with an undisclosed, unexpected, and not- bargained-for processing fee each time a plan subscriber goes to the movies using Sinemia's service.\\" The lawsuit was amended in February 2019 to include more plaintiffs across 10 states. Photo ID Demands, \\"Exit Scam\\" Behavior and Privacy Concerns Beginning late February 2019, customers found themselves unable to use the Sinemia app along with a message that Sinemia needed a copy of a driver's license, passport or other photo ID to \\"prevent fraud.\\" In some cases, Sinemia required two forms of ID leading to speculation about the company's motivation. In many cases, once the company obtained the photo ID, passport, etc. the accounts were soon terminated. Those who refused to provide photo identification were barred from using the service with no refund, thus leaving many compelled to provide their personal identification documents as unusual and invasive as the demand is. Some have noted that Sinemia at the time was acting as an \\"exit scam\\" in which they collect private information for sale on the dark web, and quickly cease operations and disappear. Within 60 days Sinemia announced that they were ceasing US operations, leaving customers exceptionally concerned about the fate of their photo ID, credit card information, and other personal information included date of birth, and in some cases social security numbers. Account Terminations In early March 2019, customers began reporting that their accounts were being terminated with no reason being given for the terminations. Despite outcry from many of those terminated that there was no misuse or fraud on their part, Sinemia claimed that it \\"has uncovered more than a thousand variations of fraud and has improved its fraud detection systems accordingly\\" and that it \\"detected fraudulent activities by a number of users whose memberships have been subsequently terminated due to violation of the Terms of Service.\\" Many noted that they were terminated after the company updated their app to request \\"tips\\" when customers attempted to purchase movie tickets and once they refused to tip, their service was terminated. Sinemia subsequently offered partial refunds to customers \\"based on the difference between what you‚Äôve paid to Sinemia and your spending which also includes the cost of the tickets you have received through your Sinemia membership,\\" which for most users who were terminated ended up being zero, leading some users to speculate that the company terminated users that it was beginning to lose money on. The company claims that it has only removed 3% of user accounts since early March due to fraudulent activity, though it has provided no hard data to back up this claim. Publications such as Business Insider noted that they alone had received hundreds of complaints from customers on Sinemia problems, and many other sites reporting the \\"fraud\\" claims have dozens or hundreds of comments from irate terminated users, suggesting that the \\"3%\\" claim is highly understated. A survey conducted in the private Sinemia Chatter Facebook group (with 284 members total) showed that fully 80% effectively had their accounts or service effectively terminated, whether through outright account termination, account termination followed by reinstatement quickly followed by error messages, or unusual error message completely preventing the ability to use the app. One user termed this latter condition, \\"soft termination,\\" a way to kick off users and stop them from seeing their allotted movies without the affront of a \\"fraud\\" accusation that was yielding Sinemia so much bad press. Account Reinstatements Following the outcry of users who claim they were terminated despite following all of the rules, Sinemia began selectively reinstating those accounts of the most vocal complainers, particular those posting about Sinemia's business practices on social media. This was very quickly followed by unusual and never-before-seen app errors (see \\"Sinemia App Issues, below) Sinemia App Issues In March 2019, Sinemia users began reporting problems with the company's app. Complaints ranged from the inability to purchase tickets due to error messages within the app, to not being able to check in via the app when seeing the movie as required under the company's terms of service. One common error message was termed the \\"Error OK\\" message due to the placement of a single \\"Error\\" word and the OK button beneath it (see photo). Many reported this problem had been happening for days and weeks, and that the response to customer service inquiries was either slow, unhelpful, or non-existent, with some cancelling their subscriptions due to the lack of assistance with the app's problems. The app currently holds a 2.5/5 rating on Google Play and 1.1/5 on iTunes. Terms-of-Service Changes In April 2019, it was reported that Sinemia had changed its terms of service to prevent users from bringing or participating in any class-action lawsuit against the company. IndieWire Interview On April 2, 2019, IndieWire published an interview with Sinemia CEO Rifat Oguz which the interviewer described as \\"at times, contentious.\\" When asked about the problems users experience with the app, Oguz stated, \\"The technology is always updated, currently we are updating almost every two days‚Ä¶ so people always need to update and not use the outdated version,\\" while also theorizing about some of the users who were unable to purchase tickets, \\"If you were a terminated user, you can‚Äôt use your app... Maybe they‚Äôre terminated but they don‚Äôt know that.\\" Responding to reports of poor customer service, Oguz claimed, \\"We also increased our employee number maybe 30 percent this year, maybe 40 percent, so we‚Äôre growing and we‚Äôre advancing with increasing our customer support, increasing our team.\\" When asked about the issue of requiring photo IDs from its users, he stated that this information \\"only stays 24 hours in our system\\" and promised that this information would not be shared, while also attributing the need for photo IDs to \\"the fraud that we are facing.\\" When asked about the termination of user accounts with no reason offered for the terminations, Oguz stated, \\"We can of course try to do more, but right now, we need to fight the frauds to actually maintain the business.\\" See also * MoviePass References Ticket sales companies Digital marketing companies of the United States Defunct subscription services 2019 disestablishments in California ","title":"Sinemia"},{"id":"51178995","text":"Walije Gondwe (born 1936) is a writer who was the first Malawian woman novelist to have her work published.

Fortive was spun off from Danaher in July 2016. Mitchell Rales and Steven M. Rales, Danaher's founders, retained board seats with Fortive after the separation. At the point of its independent incorporation, Fortive immediately became a component of the S&P; 500. In 2016, Fortive controlled over 20 businesses in the areas of field instrumentation, transportation, sensing, product realization, automation, and franchise distribution. Later the transportation, automation and franchise distribution businesses would be spun off. In 2018 and 2019, Fortune named Fortive as a Future 50 company. In 2020, Fortune named Fortive one of the worlds most admired companies along with other major tech companies like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. 2020 also marked the third year in a row Fortive has been named to the Fortune 500.  Acquisitions   2016  In September 2016, Fluke acquired eMaint, a leading CMMS IIoT system. In October 2016, Gilbarco Veeder-Root purchased Global Transportation Technologies (GTT), a leading provider in traffic management. These marked two early moves by Fortive subsidiaries in pursuit of Fortive's vision of building on their legacy heavy asset manufacturing businesses with software-enabled workflow technologies.  2017  In July of 2017 Fortive acquired Pittsburgh-based Industrial Scientific, a global leader in gas detection and safety-as-a- service. Over time Fortive would establish their second quarters in the Industrial Scientific building. Currently, many of their data science and analytics team sit here. In September 2017, Fortive purchased Landuaer for $770 million. Landauer is a leading global provider of subscription-based technical and analytical services to determine occupational and environmental radiation exposure, as well as a leading domestic provider of outsourced medical physics services. They are headquartered in Glenwood, Illinois. Fortive subsidiary Gilbarco Veeder Root acquired Orpak Systems which delivers comprehensive solutions to oil companies and commercial fleets, improving profitability and optimizing performance from the forecourt to the head office.  2018  In July 2018, Fortive announced it was buying software firm Accruent for about $2 billion. Accruent makes software to track real estate and facilities. Also in July 2018, Fortive announced it would buy construction software company Gordian for $775 million from private equity firm Warburg Pincus. Gordian, based in Greenville, South Carolina, makes software that tracks costs of construction projects, manages facility operations and generally gives building companies more insight into big projects.  2019  In June 2018, Fortive made a binding offer to buy Johnson & Johnson's Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP) business. The deal was valued at $2.8 billion, made up of $2.7 billion in cash from Fortive and $0.1 billion of retained net receivables, and closed in April 2019. Furthering their investment in healthcare, in November 2019 Fortive acquired Censis Technologies, a SaaS-based provider of inventory management in the surgical field, headquartered in Franklin, Tenn., from Riverside, a global private equity firm headquartered in Cleveland Ohio. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. In July 2019, Fluke acquired Germany based Pruftechnik, a market leader in precision laser shaft alignment, condition monitoring, and non- destructive testing, to further their reliability business unit. In addition to previous acquisitions, like Predictive Solutions (Jan 2017) and ActiveBlu (2017), Industrial Scientific has made multiple acquisitions as part of Fortive. In June 2019 Industrial Scientific entered in a definitive agreement to buy Canadian based Intelex, a leading global provider of SaaS-based Environmental, Health, Safety and Quality (EHSQ) management software. The following month (July 2019), Industrial Scientific entered a definitive agreement to acquire SAFER Systems, a global leader in real-time plume modeling and mitigation solutions for the chemical, oil & gas, and transportation industries.  Divestitures  In October 2018, Fortive spun off their automation businesses, namely, Kollmorgen, Thomson, Portescap, Jacobs Vehicle Systems, and associated subsidiaries to Altra Industrial Motion for an estimated $3 billion. In September 2019, Fortive announced its intention to split into two separate publicly traded companies. In January of 2020, the name of the new company was announced as Vontier. Vontier would comprise the transportation and franchises businesses. Specifically, the spin off would included Gilbarco Veeder Root, Matco Tools, Hennessey, GTT, Teletrac Navman, and associated subsidiaries. An IPO was estimated to yield $1 billion, but was postponed in April 2020 due to uncertainty in the market stemming from the COVID pandemic. Instead, Fortive chose to spin the business off to shareholders in October 2020 without first having the IPO. Upon separation, Vontier replaced Noble Energy as a member of the S&P; 500.  Innovation  Historically, growth in Fortive's portfolio companies had primarily come from M&A; activity and operational excellence under the vaunted Danaher Business System. Fortive has sought to achieve organic growth through establishing a culture of experimentation and innovation. Early on, this meant working with Innovators DNA to incorporate best practices. Fortive's approach has proved successful. Notable new product introductions have included Tektronix MS05X \\"Elemental\\", Fluke's T6, Invetech's Formulate and Fill platform, Anderson- Negele's paperless recorder, and Fluke's ii900. In the middle of the COVID pandemic, when there was a shortage of N-95 masks, ASP quickly innovated on existing technology to allow hospitals to clean masks. In May 2020, Fortive partnered with Pioneer Square Labs (PSL) to launch tech startups. In June 2020, Fortive, in partnership with PSL, launched Team Sense.  Culture  Fortive's culture is founded on two key principles: continuous improvement and integrity & compliance. Fortive's continuous improvement culture dates back to the Toyota Production System adopted by Danaher. At Fortive it has been branded as the Fortive Business System or FBS for short. FBS has evolved to fit the needs of Fortive's operating companies and strategic focus on innovation. FBS has been referenced on multiple earnings calls as a key driver for sustained growth and operational excellence within the various operating companies. Fortive's culture around integrity and compliance has led to several initiatives around Inclusion and Diversity. In 2018, 2019 and 2020 Fortive was named among the best places to work for LGBTQ Equality by the Human Rights Campaign. Fortive has been a long standing partner with the Consortium, an organization committed to enhance diversity and inclusion in global business leadership by striving to reduce the significant under- representation of African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native Americans. Fortive allows each of its associates a paid day of leave each year to volunteer in their local community. In 2020, Newsweek named Fortive as one of their top 500 most responsible companies.

From there the eastern branch leads to Macap√° in Amap√° and the western branch leads to Manaus in Amazonas. The towers supporting the span across the Amazon River are nearly as high as the Eiffel Tower. Work to extend the line from Manaus north to Boa Vista, Roraima, is due to complete in 2018. There were delays in issuing the environmental permits and then legal challenges since the line crosses the territory of indigenous people who had not been consulted. Although efforts have been made to avoid environmental damage, there has been controversy about the impact of construction and of the tower maintenance corridor. Background Until recently the areas of Brazil north of the Amazon, including all of the states of Amap√° and Roraima, and parts of the states of Par√° and Amazonas, were not connected to the Brazilian national electrical power grid. These areas mainly depended on subsidised thermal power generation. The Balbina Dam fails to provide more than 20% of Manaus's electricity. The Linh√£o de Tucuru√≠, or the Tucuru√≠-Macap√°-Manaus Interconnection, was built to link the northern communities to the grid to meet growth in power demand, particularly in the Manaus region. Hydroelectric power from the grid could replace most of the expensive and polluting power generation from oil and gas. The project would provide cheaper, cleaner and more reliable electricity and would eliminate the costly thermal generation subsidy. Technical The project involved construction of seven double- circuit power lines with a total length of about connecting eight substations. Seven of the substations were built from scratch. The grid uses 3,600 transmission towers, with an average span of between towers. The Amazon River span is . The project built a double circuit with a voltage of 500 kV between the Tucuru√≠ hydroelectric plant, the second largest in the country, and the Manaus region. It runs through intermediate substations in the municipalities of Anapu, Almeirim, Oriximin√° and Silves. A line connecting Amap√° to the national grid, a double circuit of 230 kV, runs from the Jurupari substation in Almeirim to substations in Laranjal do Jari and Macap√°. The Tucuru√≠ Hydroelectric Dam has an installed capacity of 8,370 MW. The total transport capacity of the high tension lines is 2,400 MW. Optical fiber cable was run along the transmission lines for use in broadband internet and telephony. The optical network with multiple 100 gigabit per second carriers was installed by TIM Brasil, designed with 17 optical spans. The spans were as long as possible due to the cost and difficulty of maintenance of regeneration sites. Construction The project was divided into three construction, operation and maintenance segments. The Spanish company Isolux Cors√°n won the concessions for lots A and B, and a consortium of Eletronorte, Abengoa and Chesf won lot C. A company was formed for each concession. The lot A section from Tucuru√≠ to Jurupari operated by LXTE is long. The lot B section operated by LMTE from Oriximin√° via Jurupari to Macap√° is long. The lot C section from Oriximin√° to Manaus operated by MTE (Manaus Transmissora de Energia) is long. The estimated cost was about R$3 billion. The project was financed by the Banco de la Amazon√≠a. Due to the environmental importance of the Amazon region the project had to minimise impact. For this reason the transmission lines mainly run beside existing highways. In many sections unusually high towers had to be built to carry the lines above treetops to avoid cuts. The Isolux Cors√°n part of the project involved 4,000 workers living in fourteen camps. It included a section of swamp. In the Alagados region between the Xingu and Amazon rivers the land is flooded in the rainy season and has deep mud in the \\"dry\\" season. Use of large barges proved impossible without causing unacceptable environmental damage. The solution was to use specially-built light barges propelled by a hydraulic excavator. The excavator, placed at the front of the barge, would pull it forward using its scoop. Buffalo trails showed where the deepest channels were. The crossings of the Amazon, Trombetas and Uatum√£ rivers required huge towers. The line crosses the Amazon at Jurupari island with a span between towers and a span between towers. By comparison, the Eiffel Tower in Paris is high. Zhejiang Electric Power Transmission & Transformation Corporation of China, with the China Cable Corporation and Zhejiang Shengda Steel tower company, built the two largest towers and the main span across the Amazon River. The main span is , and the strain section is . Four stranded aluminium lines with a steel core were used for the conductors. The pylons weigh 2,500 tonnes each. Power lines at the Tucuru√≠ Dam Pylon for a river crossing Completion was planned for the end of 2011. In April 2011 it was reported that the first tower had been completed, a , 24 ton structure on the Oriximin√° ‚Äì Manaus section. The work was now scheduled for completion in December 2012, or at latest in July 2013. The line reached Manaus in 2013. Total investment was US$2.29 billion. According to the government the project would reduce power generation costs by R$2 billion annually. The next phase was a extension from Manaus to Boa Vista, Roraima. Roraima extension The concession to build and operate the line from Manaus north to Boa Vista, Roraima, was auctioned in September 2011 and the agreement with the Transnorte consortium was signed in January 2012. Completion was scheduled for January 2015 at an estimated cost of about R$890 million. Alupar has 51% equity in the consortium and Eletronorte, a subsidiary of Eletrobras, has 49%. The project was stalled due to delays in the licensing process. In the interim, the state remained dependent on the Linh√£o de Guri from Venezuela, an ageing and unreliable line with steadily less power provided by Venezuela. Boa Vista, a city of over 320,000 people, suffers from constant power outages and blackouts. The route chosen by Transnorte Energia, the concessionary company, would follow the BR-174 federal highway and was identified as alternative 1 in the 2014 Environmental Impact Assessment, which included studies of the indigenous component. Of the four routes considered, the alternative 1 had the least environmental impact. of the line would cross the Waimiri Atroari Indigenous Territory. 250 support towers would be built in the indigenous territory. The only route that completely avoided the territory, long, would involve opening roads in a better preserved region of the Amazon rainforest, and would cause great pressure to occupy that region. By following the BR-174 infrastructure corridor the chosen alternative would avoid further fragmentation of the forest. The Funda√ß√£o Nacional do √çndio (FUNAI ‚Äì National Indian Foundation) issued a letter of consent in November 2015. President Dilma Rousseff announced that a provisional licence would be granted early in December 2015. The preliminary licence was granted to Transnorte Energia by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) on 9 December 2015. In January 2016 the Roraima Secretary for Planning said the connection to the Linh√£o de Tucuru√≠ should reach Boa Vista in 2018. However, the state was still considering installing another thermoelectric power station to meet immediate demand and was looking into a hydroelectric installation in Caracara√≠. BR-174 in the Waimiri Atroari Indigenous Territory In February 2016 a federal judge issued an injunction that prohibited work on the 500 kV line until the Waimiri-Atroari indigenous people had been consulted. He said IBAMA had ignored the requests of the indigenous people and forced through the project without consultation, as required by the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989. Although public hearings had been held in the cities of Presidente Figueiredo, Manaus, Rorain√≥polis and Boa Vista, none had been held in the Waimiri Atroari Indigenous Territory. A leader of the indigenous people said FUNAI could not speak on their behalf concerning the project. The Convention required free and informed prior consultation. The Waimiri Atroari had already suffered from a history of \\"violent pacification\\", illegal mining and flooding of sacred territories, as with the Balbina Dam. Construction would involve hundreds of workers entering the territory, where FUNAI considers that more than 1,600 Indians are \\"recent contact\\". The Indian leaders said that there were already problems in the community and conflicts since BR-174 was opened. In March 2016 a federal judge responded to a request by the attorney general and suspended the injunction that was preventing construction of the line. He said there had been undue judicial interference in the licensing process for the project, which was of a national strategic nature and would be undertaken entirely on federal land along the BR-174. Environmental impacts An environmental assessment document was issued in 2005 that discussed ways to minimise impacts. It covered topics such as the impact on protected areas, land degradation, water pollution, damage to flora and fauna, archaeological and historical sites and community involvement. Given the sensitivity of the Amazon rainforest the environmental impact of the project was the subject of considerable scrutiny. For example, the effect of reduced plant mass in the transmission corridor had to be offset against the savings in greenhouse gas emitted when generating power. However, the estimated net effect is to avoid emissions of 1,460,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent annually. In March 2013 it was reported that the government was launching an inquiry into the environmental impact of the project in the Manaus region. A public prosecutor asserted that trees had been removed in the Mindu Park in Manaus, violating the environment license. On 7 April 2015 a sum of R$450,000 was allocated to the Uatum√£ Sustainable Development Reserve to offset the irreversible negative environmental impacts from implementation and operation of the Linh√£o de Tucuru√≠. The section to Boa Vista would run through the Adolfo Ducke Forest Reserve, an important research site. A path up to wide would be cleared below the power lines to allow for tower maintenance. Many wildlife species would have difficulty crossing such a gap. In 2014 scientists from the National Institute for Amazonian Research expressed concern that the reserve would be isolated and would lose many species.

History Until the mid-19th century Mount Carmel was largely uninhabited, except for temporary accommodation of shepherds and hermits, because it was far from the coast ‚Äì and the walled Old Haifa. Ownership of the land was divided between the state, the Carmelite Order, and residents of the Arab village of Al Tira (which is today the city of Tirat Carmel). The mountain became famous for its uneven road, known as the \\"High Road\\" (as opposed to the \\"Lower Road\\" now called \\"Derekh Hahagana\\"). During the 19th century the Carmelite Order acquired estates in Stella Maris and Wadi Siach.◊ô◊¢◊ß◊ë ◊©◊ï◊®◊®, ◊ú◊ò◊ô◊ô◊ú ◊ë◊ó◊ô◊§◊î ◊ë◊ô◊ü ◊õ◊®◊û◊ú ◊ú◊ô◊ù, ◊û◊©◊®◊ì ◊î◊ë◊ô◊ò◊ó◊ï◊ü - ◊î◊î◊ï◊¶◊ê◊î ◊ú◊ê◊ï◊®, ◊¢◊û◊ï◊ì 73 The German Templer settlement on Mount Carmel at the end of the 19th century marked the beginning of the development of the area. The purchase of land in the area by the ILD just after the First World War, led to the development of the area as a Jewish neighborhood surrounded by gardens, as it remains today. Merkaz HaCarmel today Since the establishment of the State of Israel, the Merkaz HaCarmel neighborhood has become a prestigious residential area, with shopping centers and local businesses including many European-style cafes, and several hotels and museums. Haifa Zoo was established in the early 1950s, near to the Gan HaEm garden. The station Gan HaEm is the upper terminus of the Carmelit funicular subway system. The Carmelit was built in the late 1950s and runs down Mount Carmel from Merkaz HaCarmel to Paris Square in downtown Haifa. The Haifa Auditorium and the Haifa Cinematheque. were built in the 1970s. The Louis Promenade, built in 1992, runs adjacent with Yefe Nof Street and offers striking views over the city of Haifa. Hotels Gardens Museums The Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art in Merkaz HaCarmel The city of Haifa, led by Abba Hushi, purchased the former home of Frederick Kisch (who lived there 1934‚Äì1939) on HaNassi Avenue and established the Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art there in 1959. The Mane-Katz Museum houses the work of Emmanuel Mane-Katz. Katz had lived and worked in Merkaz HaCarmel in his later years after being offered a building by mayor Abba Hushi. After his death, he left his work and extensive collection of personal Jewish ethnography to the city of Haifa. In February 1962, the Moshe Shteklis Museum of Prehistory was founded as a municipal museum. The museum displays prehistoric finds from archaeological excavations in Carmel, mostly from Nahal Oren and Kebara Cave, and finds from underwater excavations of the neolithic village of Atlit Yam, off the coast of Atlit. In 2012 the Munio Gitai Weinraub Architecture Museum opened in the studio in HaNassi Avenue (near the Cinematheque) where architect Munio Weinraub lived and worked. Other buildings In 1952 Haifa Zoo was established. In 1974 Haifa Auditorium was established in Merkaz HaCarmel, and in 1975, Haifa Cinematheque was established there. Louis Promenade View of the city of Haifa from Louis Promenade in Merkaz HaCarmel In 1992, the Louis Promenade was built along Yefe Nof Street, and runs from Hotel Nof to the Emperor's Monument, near to the entrance to the upper Terraces of the Shrine of the B√°b. The promenade was donated by Paul and May Goldschmidt, Haifa residents originally from South Africa, in memory of their son Louis (Ariel) who was killed in a car accident. The promenade is about in length and includes Gan Yefe Nof and \\"◊ë◊®◊ô◊õ◊™ ◊î◊ê◊ô◊ô◊ú◊î\\".

The episode was written by series creators Jim Kouf and David Greenwalt, and was directed by Terrence O'Hara. Plot Opening quote: \\"The will to conquer is the first condition of victory.\\" Nick (David Giuntoli) has just found that Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) and Renard (Sasha Roiz) were kissing in the spice shop. He is then called to investigate the deaths of the Hundj√§gers he and Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) killed. Renard enters the trailer to find the key, but he can't find it. In the station, they find footage of the hotel where Monroe (face unseen) is followed by the Hundj√§gers. Monroe calls Rosalee (Bree Turner) so they can work on a cure for Juliette and Renard. Renard visits Juliette and they continue kissing, something Nick is watching from distance. He gets out of the car, planning on confronting them but receives a call from Monroe, who claims that Rosalee can find a way to cure them. In the house, they begin agreeing or disagreeing about having sex, so Juliette takes Renard's gun and begins shooting in the house so he is forced to leave. Adalind (Claire Coffee) is freed from the jail but is forced by Renard to come with him to a lake. He tells her to \\"fix\\" him but she states that although she can't, she can make it \\"better\\" and they have sex. In the station, Renard finally finds the key in Nick's desk and takes it. In the spice shop, Monroe finally deduces that Renard is the boss, or called \\"Royal\\" in Portland for the purification spell and that they need Juliette and Renard to take it. However, another ingredient required is Adalind's cat and as it died, Nick will be forced to drink the antidote. Renard lies to Adalind that he didn't find the key and calls Nick to meet in a specific place. They meet at the Postman's house where Nick attacks Renard and he finally finds out that he is a Wesen. Renard explains that he came to give him the key and he knew Nick was a Grimm even before Nick and he is on his side. In the spice shop, Nick takes the antidote and passes through the same pain process Renard went through. In Vienna, Adalind has a pregnancy test and smiles when it shows positive. Reception Viewers The episode was viewed by 4.90 million people, earning a 1.5/5 in the 18-49 rating demographics on the Nielson ratings scale, ranking second on its timeslot and third for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Last Man Standing, 20/20, and Shark Tank. This was a 3% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 5.03 million viewers with a 1.6/5. This means that 1.5 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 5 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With DVR factoring in, the episode was watched by 7.71 million viewers with a 2.7 ratings share in the 18-49 demographics.Live+7 DVR Ratings: 'The Big Bang Theory' Leads Adults 18‚Äì49 Ratings & Total Viewership Gains; 'Smash' Earns Biggest Percentage Increase in Week 24 Critical reviews \\"Face Off\\" received positive reviews. The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade and wrote, \\"Grimm has shown that when the serialized pieces click into place, it becomes far more compelling. The best case-of-the-week episodes ‚Äî last season's 'Organ Grinder,' last Halloween's 'La Llorona' ‚Äî are good examples of how to keep the wheels spinning without losing interest. But the little tidbits of information that expand the Wesen world‚Äîthe conflict between the rebels, the Verrat, the royals, and the Grimms they traditionally employ ‚Äî is the most fascinating and important part of a supernatural/fantasy show like this. It's taken quite a while for the mythology and characterization to catch up, but as the characters have been filled in and a clearer picture of what's going on in this world is revealed, Grimm has improved more often than it has stumbled.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.0 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"'Face Off' was really a culmination of payoffs all of us have been waiting over a year for. Juliette and Renard's actions are beginning to make some sense, Adalind continues to be a great villain, and, most importantly, Nick and Renard finally tip their hands to each other.\\" Shilo Adams from TV Overmind, wrote: \\"After hearing that his (ex-?)almost-fiancee had been cheating on him with his boss, Nick is ready to get violent on somebody, preferably Renard. Monroe intervenes before anything could happen, delaying his friend long enough that a call comes in about a quadruple homicide ‚Äì the quadruple homicide that Nick committed in the fall finale. The four dead bodies ‚Äì all Verrat, three of them men ‚Äì were never disposed of nor were they hidden, although taking their ids and doing the act in an area not beholden to surveillance cameras keeps Nick's secret under wraps. For now.\\" Josie Campbell from TV.com wrote, \\"But what really made 'Face Off' great was that it got right back to the fast-paced info-dump from the beginning of Season 2. Secrets were revealed in a way that felt satisfying and also gave rise to more questions; characters were thinking as fast as they were reacting, crashing headfirst into the changing status quo. Though I'd be happier if Monroe and Nick had more gradually pieced together the Hexenbiest/Juliette's Memory Loss puzzle over a few episodes instead of figuring it out all at once, once things started to dawn on them, a lot of fun was had.\\" References External links Grimm (season 2) episodes 2013 American television episodes ","title":"Face Off (Grimm)"},{"id":"51179173","text":"The Aftermath is an Ingush singer-songwriter duo formed in 2004 by sisters Fatima Matieva and Taita Matieva, based in Moscow, Russia.

They were unveiled during Mobile World Congress in February 2016, and are a successor to the Idol 3. The Idol 4 and 4S are positioned as mid-range devices, with the 4S serving as a higher-end model with a faster processor, a larger 1440p display, and a bundled virtual reality headset which serves as the device's packaging. The Idol 4 was re- branded by BlackBerry Limited as the BlackBerry DTEK50, as unveiled in July 2016.  Specifications  The Idol 4 series is constructed with a metal and glass chassis. It features a dual-sided speaker system developed in collaboration with JBL, with speakers on the top and bottom edges of both sides of the device. The Idol 4 is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 system-on-chip with 3 GB of RAM, and features a 5.2-inch 1080p IPS LCD display. The Idol 4S uses a Snapdragon 652, and has a larger, 5.5-inch 1440p Super AMOLED display. Both models have 3 GB of RAM, and the 4 and 4S have 16 and 32 GB of internal storage respectively, expandable via microSD card. They feature 2610 and 3000 mAh batteries respectively. The Idol 4 and 4S both feature 8-megapixel front-facing cameras, and have 13 and 16-megapixel rear- facing cameras respectively. The 4S includes a rear-mounted fingerprint reader. The Idol 4 series ships with Android 6.0 \\"Marshmallow\\". Alcatel plans to provide an update to Android 7.0 \\"Nougat\\" in the future. The \\"Boom Key\\" on the side of the device can be used to activate certain functions in the software, such as waking the phone directly to the camera, music audio enhancement, and activating nitro in the Asphalt driving game series. The retail packaging of the Idol 4S doubles as a virtual reality headset which the phone can be inserted into.  Reception  The Verge considered the Idol 4S to be an attempt by Alcatel to progress towards a higher-end market, replacing the plastic used on previous Idol models with higher-quality materials and a \\"well-constructed\\" chassis. The quad HD display was praised for being better than that of the Nexus 6P, although not as \\"blindingly bright\\" in direct sunlight as Samsung displays. The speaker system was also considered \\"powerful\\", stating that it \\"[put the] Galaxy S7 Edge to shame and actually did justice to the new Justice single.\\" The Boom Key's features were panned as being \\"not particularly useful\\" and \\"certainty not important enough\\" to require a dedicated key. The performance of the Idol 4S was considered good, explaining that \\"it may not be as impressive on the spec sheet, but in the real world, I've been struggling to find a difference in performance between the 4S and phones with the more powerful [Qualcomm Snapdragon 820].\\" The camera was panned for not featuring optical image stabilization, and having a lower quality in comparison to its competitors. In conclusion, The Verge felt that the Idol 4S \\"didn't disappoint\\", but did not have enough distinctive functionality to make it stand out against major competitors at its price point. VentureBeat considered the VR headset box to be a \\"clever value-add\\" that could be \\"a good way to move virtual reality downmarket from its lofty Oculus heights\\". The Verge considered the headset to be comfortable, but limited in comparison to the Samsung Gear VR because of its low level of functionality, lack of lens adjustment, and lack of content partnerships (as with Oculus and the Gear VR) beyond Google Cardboard-compatible content.  Windows 10 version  On November 10, 2016, Alcatel unveiled a version of the Idol 4S running Windows 10 Mobile, with T-Mobile US as a launch partner. The Windows 10 version of the Idol 4S contains changes from the Android version, including a change in system-on-chip to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 and 4 GB of RAM, 21-megapixel rear camera, and the replacement of the 1440p display with a 1080p display.  BlackBerry version  In July 2016, BlackBerry Limited unveiled a re-branded version of the Idol 4 in partnership with TCL known as the BlackBerry DTEK50. It is similar in specifications and design to the Idol 4, although with minor design changes such as the replacement of its glass backing with a rubber coating. The device runs a BlackBerry-developed distribution of Android similar to its first Android device, the Priv, which is modified with security and enterprise-oriented features.

The siege was part of Maurice's famous campaign of 1591. Background In early 1591 Maurice with his army had launched a campaign against the cities of Zutphen, Deventer, and Delfzijl having forced the Spanish garrisons there to surrender. The army included sixteen English ensigns under Sir Francis Vere and ten Scots ensigns under Colonel Balfour.Knight, Charles Raleigh: Historical records of The Buffs, East Kent Regiment (3rd Foot) formerly designated the Holland Regiment and Prince George of Denmark's Regiment. Vol I. London, Gale & Polden, 1905, p. 51 The combined army then faced the Spanish of the Duke of Parma at the fort of Knodsenburg just north of Nijmegen and defeated them during the siege there. Afterwards Maurice gave the appearance he was going into winter quarters by late September 1591 Maurice however landed with his army at Kreverwille, and from there marched to Hulst. The ruse worked; nearly half of the Spanish garrison that normally would have been stationed there had been sent elsewhere, leaving only 400 troops in the city. Siege & Aftermath Maurice arrived at Hulst as planned on 19 September, and took advantage of the situation and went ahead with the siege. Maurice was hoping for a quick siege and therefore ordered a massive continual bombardment.Tucker p. 545 The Spanish garrison commander Colonel Castillo was completely surprised by the Anglo-Dutch force that surrounded him and could offer only slight resistance. After five days of a continuous bombardment, Castillo and with no help from outside coming, asked for terms which was accepted.(French) The Spanish garrison was given the honours of war and marched out with their arms. Close by in Antwerp, which was honouring the Duke of Parma's son Ranuccio, the surrender of Hulst was totally unexpected and shocked the Spanish high command. Parma was angered and ordered that Castillo be immediately beheaded for his negligence. Maurice put up defences around the region to consolidate his hold and then made secret plans to besiege Nijmegen rather than Geertruidenberg which was expected from the Spanish point of view to be the next target. After a weeks siege, Maurice captured Nijmegen and thus ended the victorious campaign for him in 1591. After five years in Dutch hands, the city was retaken by Spanish forces under Archduke of Austria and remained in their hands until 1645 in one of the last sieges of the war.van Nimwegen p. 277  References  ;Citations ;Bibliography Sieges of the Eighty Years' War 1591 in Europe Conflicts in 1591 Sieges involving the Dutch Republic Sieges involving England Sieges involving Spain 1591 in the Dutch Republic Hulst History of Zeeland 16th-century military history of the Kingdom of England ","title":"Siege of Hulst (1591)"},{"id":"51179197","text":"Uncle Sam and His Battering Ram is a World War I song written by Robert P.

Pinney's photographs have won the photographer numerous fellowships and awards, including Guggenheim and NEA Fellowships, and found their way into the collections of the major museums in the US and abroad. Melissa Ann Pinney's work first garnered attention when it was included in the Museum of Modern Art's major 1991 exhibition, Pleasures and Terrors of Domestic Comfort. Her evocative and sharply attentive photographs of the stages of life in American women earned her a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1999, enabling her to develop the work that resulted in her first major monograph, Regarding Emma: Photographs of American Women and Girls (Center for American Places, 2003). Since that time, Pinney has continued to follow those narratives, and the themes contained within them. This is an extensive body of work, some of which was shown at the Art Institute of Chicago in 2008 and at Alan Klotz Gallery in 2007 and 2009. Girl Ascending, the full span of this second phase in Pinney's project, was published by the Columbia College Press in January 2010. Biography  Early life and education  Melissa Ann Pinney was born in St Louis, Missouri, the fourth of William Thomas Pinney and Mary Ann Hilburn Pinney's eight children. A year after her birth the Pinneys moved to Scarsdale, New York. Six years later they moved to Palo Alto, California and then in 1961 to Evanston, Illinois. Pinney was brought up as a Catholic and attended high school at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, a private academy for girls in Chicago. She went on to attend Manhattanville College‚Äì also a Sacred Heart school‚Äì in Purchase, NY, and then earned a BFA in Photography from Columbia College Chicago in 1977. Pinney earned her MFA in Photography from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1988.  Influences  Early on, Pinney was inspired by the photographs of Dorothea Lange and Robert Frank, by the portraits of Julia Margaret Cameron and the street photography of Garry Winogrand and Helen Levitt. In addition to these 20th century artists, the iconography of the Christian religious paintings from Pinney's Catholic girlhood are the foundational images of her art.  Early portraits  Pinney's first work to gain attention was a series of costumed black and white portraits of her female friends, made in locations around Chicago. These pictures were first exhibited in Breath of Vision: Portfolios of Women Photographers, at Fashion Institute of Technology Galleries in New York City in 1975. In 1978 Pinney exhibited her Portraits of Evanston Artists at the Evanston Art Center, followed by series of large black and white portraits of family and friends, \\"Remembrances.\\" The exhibition opened at the Chicago Cultural Center in 1982 and travelled to the Illinois State Museum in Springfield, Illinois, in 1983.  1980s street work  In graduate school, Pinney moved on from the medium-format portraits that had characterized her work, to pictures made in the flux of life on the streets of Chicago. Her first project in this manner were pictures made during the summer of 1983 at the Hamlin Park swimming pool, followed by a series of street carnivals shot mostly at night, images of her parents and siblings in Florida, and the beaches of Sarasota and Miami. By the mid-1980s Pinney had acquired her first Leica Camera.  The Feminine Identity Series (1985‚Äì95)  Throughout the 1980s, Pinney supported herself by working as a photo-assistant and stylist for commercial still and motion photographers. She accepted commissions photographing weddings and parties, and started shooting in color for these jobs. Photographs of brides, their mothers and attendants made during these wedding assignments signaled the beginning of the \\"Feminine Identity Series\\". Images from this series were included in Museum of Modern Art's 1991 exhibition curated by Peter Galassi, Pleasures & Terrors of Domestic Comfort.  Regarding Emma (2003)  In 2003, Pinney's first monograph, Regarding Emma: Photographs of American Women & Girls, (With a Foreword by Ann Patchett), was published by The Center for American Places. For nearly twenty years, Melissa Ann Pinney had photographed girls and women, from infancy to old age, to portray how feminine identity is constructed, taught, and communicated. Her work depicted the rites of American womanhood-- a prom, a wedding, a baby shower, a tea party, and the informal passages of girlhood: combing a doll's hair, doing laundry with a mother, smoking a cigarette at a state fair. With each view, we gain a greater understanding of the connections between mother and daughter, and by extension the larger world of family, friends, and society. Pinney's approach to interpreting girlhood became more complicated and complex when her daughter, Emma, was born in 1995. Emma's childhood evoked in Pinney her own girlhood and gave her work new meaning and purpose. Ultimately, Regarding Emma shares with all of us the incremental and the ritualistic changes that take place in a woman's life over time.  Ballroom Dance Series (2007‚Äì10)  These pictures of young people negotiating their first formal events were made during Ballroom Dance Class at the Woman's Athletic Club, a graduation dance at the Hilton Chicago and B'nai Mitzvah parties in Chicago and Evanston.  Girl Ascending (2010)  Girl Ascending (With a Foreword by David Travis) was published by The Center for American Places at Columbia College Chicago in 2010. The work in Girl Ascending focuses on a touchstone moment in the lives of American girls and women: their emergence from protected youth to public maturity. In these pictures Pinney portrays the uneasiness of that emergence in the struggle to fit ideal dresses to real bodies, proper etiquette to ebullient energies and appetites, natural companionship to formal conversation as the girls prepare themselves for the rest of their lives. Girl Ascending can be seen as a continuation of Pinney's widely praised first book, Regarding Emma: Photographs of American Women and Girls. \\"The strength of Pinney's work has always lain in her ability to sympathetically inhabit the lives of her subjects, while understanding their place in the larger ebb and flow of social life around them,\\" photographic and cultural historian Peter Bacon Hales has written. \\"The pictures are so often gorgeous in their manner, and heartbreaking in their implications; rarely do we see photographs that can imply so much without intruding or announcing their intentions. A major contribution to neo-documentary photography, Melissa Ann Pinney's Girl Ascending confirms her place among the top rank of photographers working in the new century.\\" As David Travis writes in his introduction, \\"Pinney has regained that sense of wonder, making her view of girls ascending into young women both believable and enchanting\\".  Cellar Door Series (2001-Present)  Pinney made the first picture in the Cellar Door Series in May, 2001. After celebrating her daughter Emma's sixth birthday with a backyard party, Emma climbed up on the old cellar door. Pinney was inspired by Alfred Stieglitz's 1921 portrait of Georgia Engelhard to make a picture. Afterward, Pinney decided to continue the project, at first once a year and then once every season or so. Emma is now twenty one years old; the photographs span over a decade from 2001 to 2016 and continuing.  TWO (2015)  TWO, edited and introduced by Ann Patchett demonstrates the duality in our relationships and in the world that surrounds us. The photographs are of pairs‚Äîmostly, but not always human‚Äîthat display or imply elusive connections of mind, of spirit, or of simply of the act of being. Photographs include children at play, aging friends, parent and child, couples in love, two nesting tea cups, twin teen- age boys, two chairs in autumn, among many others. The photographs are laid out in short sequences, with an essay placed between each sequence. The essays by the contemporary writers, Billy Collins, Edwidge Danticat, Elizabeth Gilbert, Allan Gurganus, Jane Hamilton, Barbara Kingsolver, Elizabeth McCracken, Maile Meloy, Susan Orlean, and Richard Russo.

History On 1 February 1758, the lighthouse was ordered constructed by regal charter. Cabo Carvoeiro is a prominent cape along the southern Portuguese coast, with a coastal beacon operating for four centuries from the promontory, first from the chapel of Nossa Senhora de Vit√≥ria (before it was demolished). The first purpose-built structure was a tall lighthouse that started to operate in 1790, but identified as inadequate by an 1881 commission. In 1865, the lighthouse was described in this form: :...it is found at an elevation of 55.52 metres. The light is white and fixed, produced by sixteen Argand with parabolic reflectors. The range exceeds about 9 miles. The lantern where this mechanism was installed has a 8.24 metre height and eight faces with a width of 1.67 metre...The building where the lantern is a rectangular tower, is constructed of masonry with cornerstones. Alongside the tower are lodgings for lighthouse keepers, offices and pantries e, linking theses buildings is a church in ruins (called the Church of Nossa Senhora da Vit√≥ria, over which there used to be a light, to guide navigators before the lighthouse existed). The power source was olive oil. But, by 1886, it was completely remodelled, under the direction and project of Polycarpo Lima. This included the installation of a petrol lamp to illuminate the beacon. In 1923 the fixture was substituted for a giant fourth-order optical lens, and operated by clockwork mechanical system, resulting in a system of four red flashes, separated in 10 seconds intervals. The light was substituted in 1947 by gas lamp. Between 1947 and 1949, the Comiss√£o Administrativa das Novas Instala√ß√µes para a Marinha (Navy New Installations Administrative Commission), later the Direc√ß√£o de Far√≥is (Directorate for Lighthouses) constructed the lighthouse keepers residences. By 1952, the beacon began to operate by electricity. The lighthouse required large modifications by 1981, in order to receive a new lens, as indicated by reports of the Comiss√£o de Far√≥is e Balizas (Lighthouse and Beacons Commission). The General Plan projected had a white third-order light that could illuminate a 315¬∫ range and support a range. A red beacon was substituted when the lighthouse along Cabo Mondego was not changed, maintaining a fixed white lamp, then groups of two clarions. By 1988, the lighthouse was automated, with the optics removed and its place replaced by a PRB46 rotating panel, that emitted three, red flashes, with 15 second interval and range. Its contemporary role is much less important, with the red beacon being used to guide ships on their approach to the nearby fishing port of Peniche. Architecture Building constructed to assist maritime navigation that included a permanent residence for the lighthouse keeper, the lighthouse is situated from the Peniche waterfront over a promontory. The high square tower is constructed with cornerstones and parapets painted in white, alongside a rectangular annex building. The tower with lantern and gallery rises from the base of a U-shaped one-story keeper's complex. The buildings are painted white with unpainted stone trim, while the lantern is painted red. The illumination system consists of a rotating optical lens over a pedestal, using a white light with range at overall height. There is also a fog horn sounding one 10 second blast every 35 seconds.

Life and career Ernst Berliner was born in Berlin to Albrecht Berliner and Hedwig (n√©e Koppen). He attended the Humboldt Gymnasium, which he left in 1901 with his Abitur. From 1900 to 1904 he studied engineering at the Royal Technical Institute Charlottenburg following which he studied natural sciences at the Frederick William University (now the Humboldt University of Berlin) until 1908, with Oscar Hertwig, Rudolf Virchow (?), Ludwig Plate, Warburg, Fritz Schaudinn, Max Hartmann, Franz Eilhard Schulze, and Wilhelm von Branca. Afterwards he was active scientifically at the Zoological Institute of the University and the Robert Koch Institute. On 8 May 1909 he received a Dr. phil. with a thesis on flagellates. From 1909 to 1912 he worked at the Research Institute for Cereal Processing in Berlin as an assistant to Johannes Buchwald and later as department director. Here he studied an infectious disease of flour moth caterpillars, which he named Bacillus thuringiensis. In the summer of 1909, a shipment arrived from a Thuringian mill containing diseased caterpillars, after which an epidemic spread in the institute. In 1911, he first reported their findings in the Zeitschrift f√ºr Getreidewesen (Journal of Cereal) which he followed in 1915 with the detailed publication \\"√úber die Schlaffsucht der Mehlmottenraupe (Ephestia k√ºhniella Zell.) und ihren Erreger Bacillus thuringiensis\\" (\\"On the Somnolence of flour moth caterpillars (Ephestia k√ºhniella sp.) and their pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis\\") in the Zeitschrift f√ºr angewandte Entomologie (Journal of Applied Entomology). From 1912 to 1914 he was head of the agrochemical control station of the chamber of agriculture for Halle, Saxony-Anhalt. He volunteered after the outbreak of the First World War and served as a lieutenant and company commander in France and Russia, for which he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd and 1st class. From 1920 he was senior chemist at the Swedish milling company Malm√∂ Stora Walskvarn and from 1927 Director of the Research Institute for Cereal Chemistry at MIAG in Frankfurt. In 1921, he married Helene Martha Ast (died 1954). They had two children: Kurt Albrecht (1921-1944) and Hildur Hedwig (born 1928). In 1931 he founded the independent Research Institute for Cereal Chemistry in Darmstadt-Eberstadt. From 1927 to 1933, he was Associate Professor of Cereal Chemistry at the Technical University of Darmstadt. During the Nazi era, Berliner was subject to racial and political persecution, including restrictions on his work and prohibitions on publication. From 1936 to 1938, he was able to conduct scientific training courses in Vienna, Prague, Zurich and Paris. In 1944, he and his wife were temporarily detained by the Gestapo. From 1949 to 1957 with Kurt Neitzert (born 1911) he organized a working group within the Research Institute for Cereal Chemistry in Darmstadt-Eberstadt. In 1950 he initiated the annual Jugenheimer discussion session of the Association of Cereal Chemistry. In 1955, he was awarded the Cross of the Order of Merit (Verdienstkreuz am Bande).

The player controls a spaceship which can be moved and rotated independently to fend off angry planets and moons attacking from all directions. It was designed and programmed by Kan Yabumoto, with art by Jeff Lee and sound by David D. Thiel. Lee and Thiel previously worked on Q*bert for Gottlieb, a game that was inspired by a pattern of hexagons implemented by Yabumoto. Kan Yabumoto died in 2017 of a degenerative lung disease. Gameplay Fighting three planets with moons while an astronaut floats by The player uses a flight-style joystick to move a spaceship around a dark starfield, a rotary knob to orient the ship, and a trigger on the stick to fire. At the beginning of a level, planets appear and begin growing. They can be destroyed prior to their reaching full size and sprouting moons. If a wave is completed by destroying all planets before they reach full size, a substantial bonus is awarded. Once a planet has moons, it is shielded until all its moons have been destroyed or launched at the player's ship, at which point the planet becomes angry and charges the player. Floating astronauts appear in mini bonus rounds after every third level (every fourth after level twelve). They can be collected by flying over them. Orbiting comets accelerate the longer they go without being shot. Comets increase in value by 100 points, to a maximum of 1000, until a comet leaves the screen or the level ends. Reception Writing for Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games, Steve Arrants chose Mad Planets as one of the top ten games of the 1983 American Amusement Operators Expo. He praised the \\"beautiful graphics\\", \\"extremely responsive\\" controls, and concluded \\"I would rank Mad Planets right up there with other high-tension favorites such as Robotron and Tempest.\\" In a 1983 review for Video Games, John Holmstrom wrote: \\"it's the frenetic game play and rock-oriented soundtrack that make Mad Planets worth playing.\\" He found the player's ship to be ovely large for the screen, and the lack of new elements in later levels reduced his interest in sticking with the game.

It was released as a single on 4 March 2014 and re-released on 17 February 2016 alongside a bonus featuring vocals from rapper Talib Kweli, through Polydor Records. It eventually became the lead single of Shura's debut studio album, Nothing's Real (2016). Background The concept for the song came around just after Shura broke away from recording with Hiatus, a music producer called Cyrus Shahrad. She broke away from the band on a temporary basis so that she could be able to build up her songwriting skills as well as studying at university. A year later, Shura decided to take a totally different approach and, therefore, never really returned to record with Hiatus, as such Shura went to pursue her career as an independent artist. In 2014, Shura was experimenting a lot with different artists as well as beginning to experiment as a music producer. She spoke out, saying that, whilst she was on the verge of making her own stuff, she was \\"crushing hard on analogue synths. There's a fuzziness to analogue synths that I love.\\"https://genius.com/Shura-touch-lyrics During that time out of the music scene, Shura had a few rather rough social times and decided to make a song about it. She began to meet up with musician Joel Pott, who is famously known for being a member of indie rock band Athlete and participating in co-writing and producing songs for artists such as London Grammar, George Ezra and Gabrielle Aplin. Shura and Pott both produced and wrote the track and, afterwards, named it \\"Touch\\". The song was released on 4 March 2014 on YouTube and SoundCloud. Its upload to both digital streaming sites began to earn acclaim from various internet blogs and critics alike, reinforced by its powerful music video which features Shura and her friends kissing each other, regardless of gender. The music video for the song was released on the same day, which starred Shura's twin brother Nicholas Denton. The video later went viral and its views on YouTube stand at nearly 31 million as of 17 June 2019. It was also reviewed by critics as having \\"a little bit of '90s R&B;, a little bit '80s pop, with fragments of early Madonna and Janet Jackson, in addition to more contemporary artists such as Dev Hynes and Blood Orange.\\"http://theverse.co.uk/music-2/review-shura-touch/ After she released the song, Shura was signed onto Polydor Records. However, after the song's original release and the release of many songs after, she re-released the song officially on 17 February 2016 through her signed record label as a promotional release, leading up to the announcement of Shura's debut album, Nothing's Real. Also released was a bonus version with featured vocals from rapper Talib Kweli, who has been known for working with top famous artists such as Kendrick Lamar, Pharrell Williams and Mary J. Blige. Another video was re-released on the same day with stop-motion animation footage from the original music video released two years before. As well as the song being re- released digitally, it was also released on vinyl. Some remixes included were from artists such as Four Tet, CANVAS and Sorrow. The remix from CANVAS was released officially onto YouTube. The song's lyrics are about Shura attempting to remain friends with an ex-girlfriend.

It was founded in 1986 and is one of the six networks with national coverage.  History  The channel 13 frequency ranging between 210 and 216 MHz (NTSC-M system) in Lima was initially operated by Panamericana Televisi√≥n that remained at that frequency until 1965, when it changed to frequency of channel 5 (76-82 MHz). Later that frequency was assigned to the University of Lima and donation of equipment by Panamericana Televisi√≥n, \\"Panamericana de Teleducaci√≥n - Canal 13\\" is founded, which operated the frequency until 1974, when the military government of Juan Velasco Alvarado decided to close. In 1983, with a discrete advertising campaign in Lima, Favorita de Televisi√≥n - Canal 13 announced the start of its operations for 1984 but never materialized. By late 1985 and early 1986, Compa√±√≠a Radiodifusora Univisi√≥n S.A. (unrelated to US Hispanic network Univisi√≥n), which was then known as SIN) launched a test signal for a few months. Due to problems in importing their equipment, the Peruvian government withdraws the operating license to the nascent corporation in 1989 to finally assign it to Empresa Radiodifusora 1160 S.A. who initially operated UHF channel 33 (Stereo 33) and moved it to 13 (now Red TV). On July 1, 1986, it started broadcasting on UHF channel 33 as Stereo 33 Televisi√≥n, using the then-new stereo technology. The switch to VHF 13 happened at the start of 1989 and, in 1990, it was sold to Vittorio de Ferrari. During this transitory phase, it was known as Canal 13. The name Global Televisi√≥n was adopted in 1991 in time for the launch of their satellite connections in order to cover the whole country. It wasn't considered a \\"hot\\" channel and most of their programming was imported content. In 1995, Vittorio de Ferrari signs a deal with Antena 3 and started to show their productions as well as imported films and cartoons. Following the death the channel's owner, his son, Roberto de Ferrari, revokes the contract with Antena 3 and sold it to Genaro Delgado Parker. The name changed to Red Global. At this stage, it showed programming from his production company, Astros. Said production company and Julio Vera Abad entered a dispute over the ownership of the channel over payment issues. In July of that year, Genaro and Vera Abad confronted each other at the entrance of Astros, suspending all newscasts on the channel. Cesar Hildebrandt briefly involved with the channel in 2001, but after discovering a Vladivideo (home videos where Vladimiro Montesinos bribed politicians and owners of companies) where Genaro negotiated Hildebrandt's maintenance with Montesinos, he quickly left. The channel was sold in 2006 to CORPECON, a company associated with ATV, under the intention to revert the channel's crisis. Genaro Delgado Parker left Red Global by selling the remaining 50% to Albavisi√≥n-owned Grupo ATV. Having assumed complete control of the channel, their headquarters move to a location adjacent to the main headquarters of ATV, and rebranded it in November 2010 as Global TV. In April 2015, the channel teased a rebrand, revealed on April 13, where the channel became known as Red TV. On March 27, 2017, the channel was replaced by NexTV. Due to Grupo ATV‚Äôs brand license with Am√©rica Televisi√≥n being expired. The network which was currently known as America Next became Global Televisi√≥n on December 1, 2019. However, America and ATV‚Äôs syndication deal (which included Televisa programs licensed to channel 4) expired one year later.  Programming  Red TV's programming is mostly imported.

He is best known for his early contributions to San Francisco's conceptual and environmental art movements of the 1960s and 70s. His works include conceptual and mixed media pieces, as well as paintings and drawings.  Biography  Alfred Young was born in 1936 in Lambeth, London. After completing a printing apprenticeship at the age of twenty-one, he quit his job to become a student at the London School of Printing (now the London College of Communication). After studying painting intensely for a year, he was allowed to join the Royal College of Art and continue painting as a postgraduate student. While studying at the Royal College, Young became intensely interested in the works of cubist Jacques Villon which featured bright prismatic colors. This led to an early fascination with Additive color. Three years after becoming an art teacher at the Kingston School of Art (now Kingston University), Young left for the United States. He spent the next three years teaching art at University of New Mexico before moving to San Francisco, California.  Conceptual work  Young arrived in San Francisco and began teaching at University of San Francisco shortly before the Third World Liberation Front strikes of 1968, with which he became involved. Drawing inspiration from the non-violent demonstrations and creative forms of protest of the 1968 strikes, Young became interested in producing works that would be experienced outside of the art gallery, in a democratic and indeterminate way. In 1969, he began a series of collaborations with fellow USF art faculty Mel Henderson and Joe Hawley. In September 1969, the three created a public environmental art piece, using a non-toxic yellow dye to spell out the word \\"OIL\\" in large capital letters in the San Francisco bay. The work was created after the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, and anticipated the devastating 1971 San Francisco Bay oil spill, which occurred near the location of the art piece. The work was revisited in the 2013 exhibition 'State of Mind: New California Art Circa 1970' at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, alongside works of other conceptual artists such as Ant Farm and Chris Burden. In November 1969, the three began another piece that attempted to utilize both a participating public and a civic space. Organizing with friends and students, they produced a traffic jam of a hundred yellow cabs in San Francisco's Castro district. The initial confusion and annoyance caused by the disruption of street traffic evolved into amusement as the ridiculousness of the situation became clear to commuters and onlookers. A partial record of the event exists as a short film compiled from both aerial and ground footage of the intersection. The final collaboration planned to again employ dye to draw alongside the Golden Gate Bridge. Young, improvising the work, drew a spiral large enough to be viewed from the bridge, allowing the image to be pulled and distorted by the current. Young later stated \\"We can't predict what the visual experience will be for people ‚Äî the scene depends on their taking part in it.\\"  Contact Drawing  In 1980 Young discovered Contact Drawing. By having the subject stand against a screen of transparent material upon which he drew, and, after repeating the process a number of times, superimposed the drawings he created into a composite which melded different statements into a complete whole. By collapsing the distance between the subject and the picture plane he was able to overcome the restrictions of Renaissance perspective - predicated on one unmoving viewpoint - and use both eyes and move as he drew. Apparently and unprecedented innovation. The method was immediately lauded by both Richard Serra and John Chamberlain and other artists. As he said at the time: Contact drawing operates in the margin between the subject and the camera's nearest focus. Drawings of many downtown New Yorkers followed. In 1994, back in California, he made a freeze-like group-portrait of one hundred ten citizens of Pacific Grove. Called PAINTING THE TOWN the work measured two hundred and thirty-seven feet long and is believed to be the largest group portrait made by a single artist in the world. The work now resides in the Monterey Art Museum.  Later Work  Circa 2007, Young began creating digitally edited Stereographic images and collages to be viewed through a lorgnette. This resulted in bound collection of works titled \\"The Optimix Suite\\", which now appears in the collections of several universities. A later collection became publicly available in the form of a Google Cardboard application.

Johnson (born 1977, Birmingham, n√©e Garner) is a geologist and Antarctic scientist, who has worked for British Antarctic Survey (BAS) since 2002. She works in the palaeoenvironments, ice sheets and climate change team and is best known for her work on glacial retreat. The Johnson Mesa in James Ross Island, Antarctica is named in her honour. Early life and education Johnson decided to follow a science career after enjoying studying science at King Edward VI High School for Girls during her teenage years. In 1998, Johnson obtained a BSc degree in Geology (1st class) from Durham University (Hatfield College). She then went on to complete a PhD in 2002, supervised by at Clare College, Cambridge, with a thesis on Magmatism of the Vitim Volcanic Field, Baikal Rift Zone, Siberia. The research consisted of using geochemical characteristics of lavas to study the composition and thickness of the lithosphere in the Baikal Rift Zone of Siberia, and to improve understanding of the melting regime beneath the region during the Cenozoic. Career and research After her PhD, Johnson began work at British Antarctic Survey (BAS). The first project she worked on (2002‚Äì2005) was an analysis of the origin and implications of authigenic alteration minerals in volcaniclastic rocks from James Ross Island. In 2005‚Äì2009, she worked in the QWAD (Quaternary West Antarctic Deglaciation project), within the GRADES (Glacial Retreat in Antarctica and Deglaciation of the Earth System) programme at BAS, reconstructing Quaternary thinning history of Pine Island Glacier. Her work showed that Pine Island Glacier thinned as rapidly 8000 years ago as it is at the present day. From 2015 to 2020, Johnson is working on a Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) funded project \\"Reconstructing millennial- scale ice sheet change in the western Amundsen Sea Embayment, Antarctica, using high-precision exposure dating\\", with a team from BAS, Imperial College London, Durham University, Columbia University (USA) and Pennsylvania State University (USA). She is also working on other projects including * Exploring feedbacks between glaciation, volcanism and climate in Antarctica: studying carbon dioxide outgassing from the James Ross Island lavas using melt inclusions in olivines * Determining Quaternary glacial history of the Lassiter Coast, Antarctica * Comminution dating boundary conditions: A study of (234U/238U) disequilibrium along the Antarctic Peninsula * Antarctic Peninsula exhumation and landscape development investigated by low-temperature detrital thermochronometry Some of her research has taken place in remote parts of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Publications Her publicationsJoanne Johnson's include: *Collaborating On Glacial Research *Rapid thinning of Pine Island Glacier in the early Holocene *Zeolite compositions as proxies for eruptive palaeoenvironment *Volcanism in the Vitim Volcanic Field, Siberia: Geochemical Evidence for a Mantle Plume Beneath the Baikal Rift Zone Awards and honours Johnson was awarded the Laws Prize by BAS in 2008 and the Columbia University, Marie Tharp Fellowship for 2010‚Äì2011. The three-month fellowship allowed Johnson to collaborate with scientists at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory with the results published in the journal Science. In January 2007, due to the impact of Johnson's work (which also led to a completely novel proxy for recognising past ice sheets using alteration mineral chemistry), the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee named a feature on James Ross Island, Antarctica after her. Johnson Mesa, James Ross Island, Antarctica (63¬∞ 49'40\\"S, 57¬∞ 55'22\\"W) is a large flat- topped volcanic mountain north of Abernethy Flats, between Crame Col and Bibby Point on Ulu Peninsula, James Ross Island. Personal life Johnson is married with two children (2008 and 2013): She has spoken about the challenges of doubling as a scientist and mother: \\"The hardest thing is being torn between your personal and professional ambitions‚Ä¶Wanting to go to conferences, but not wanting to leave your children. Having to leave work early or drop everything if you get a phone call that she's sick.

Definition Let mathcal A be a pre-abelian category. A morphism f is a kernel (a cokernel) if there exists a morphism g such that f is a kernel (cokernel) of g. The category mathcal A is quasi-abelian if for every kernel f: Xrightarrow Y and every morphism h: Xrightarrow Z in the pushout diagram begin{array}{ccc} X & xrightarrow{f} & Y  downarrow_{h} & & downarrow_{h'} Z & xrightarrow{f'} & Q end{array} the morphism f' is again a kernel and, dually, for every cokernel g: Xrightarrow Y and every morphism h: Zrightarrow Y in the pullback diagram begin{array}{ccc} P & xrightarrow{g'} & Z  downarrow_{h'} & & downarrow_{h} X & xrightarrow{g} & Y end{array} the morphism g' is again a cokernel. Equivalently, a quasi-abelian category is a pre-abelian category in which the system of all kernel-cokernel pairs forms an exact structure. Given a pre-abelian category, those kernels, which are stable under arbitrary pushouts, are sometimes called the semi-stable kernels. Dually, cokernels, which are stable under arbitrary pullbacks, are called semi-stable cokernels.Richman and Walker, 1977. Properties Let f be a morphism in a quasi-abelian category. Then the induced morphism overline{f}:operatorname{cok}operatorname{ker}frightarrowoperatorname{ker}operatorname{cok}f is always a bimorphism, i.e., a monomorphism and an epimorphism. A quasi- abelian category is therefore always semi-abelian. Examples Every abelian category is quasi-abelian. Typical non-abelian examples arise in functional analysis.Prosmans, 2000. * The category of Banach spaces is quasi-abelian. * The category of Fr√©chet spaces is quasi-abelian. * The category of (Hausdorff) locally convex spaces is quasi-abelian. History The concept of quasi- abelian category was developed in the 1960s. The history is involved.Rump, 2008, p. 986f. This is in particular due to Raikov's conjecture, which stated that the notion of a semi-abelian category is equivalent to that of a quasi- abelian category. Around 2005 it turned out that the conjecture is false.Rump, 2011, p. 44f. Left and right quasi-abelian categories By dividing the two conditions in the definition, one can define left quasi-abelian categories by requiring that cokernels are stable under pullbacks and right quasi-abelian categories by requiring that kernels stable under pushouts.Rump, 2001.

Chosen from the ranks of the darogha administrators of the zenana, the mahaldar was responsible for maintaining order in this large community of women. Niccolao Manucci writes that \\"the way in which these kings are waited on deserves mention. For just as the king has his officers outside, he has the same among the fair sex within the Mahal\\". Duties Already having been honored by selection for duties within the women's quarters, a mahaldar was exalted above the others for her special services to the emperor. These special services included the management of the other ranking administrators, and reporting conflicts and intrigues from the zenana directly to the Emperor. In that way, she served as a kind of spy on behalf of the Emperor. She was also given the task of reading out daily reports from the public and secret news court writers to the emperor.  The emperor's spy  Often, princes in the royal entourage would avoid the mahaldar, or have ongoing conflicts with her, fearing her reports. One example of this is Hamida Banu, mahaldar in the mahal of Mohammad Muazzam, who complained to the Emperor, Aurangzeb that his son was undermining her authority by confiscating her pen-case and memorandum- book, when he retired to his room with his women. Court custom dictated that she and her deputy could not follow him into the room to retrieve her items during this business. This kept her from documenting whatever he was doing, and prevented her from reporting to the Emperor. Aurangzeb ordered her to keep her pen-case away from the reach of the prince at all times. In another instance, Nur-un-Nisa, mahaldar to the prince Muhammad Azam, was prohibited from joining the prince on his visits to the garden at Ahmedabad. In response, she sent a letter to his Nazir, forbidding the prince from leaving. Muhammad Azam retaliated by banishing her from his presence. The chief eunuch then alerted the emperor to the situation, and Aurangzeb supported the mahaldar and nazir. His son was forced to beg for forgiveness, and paid a fine of 50,000 Rupees. Notable Mahaldars During Jahangir's reign this post was held by a certain lady named Dilaram, who had nursed Empress Nur Jahan in her childhood. Previously this post was held by Haji Koka.

It was opened in 1795 during the reign of Selim III and continued functioning until 1928, until the opening of the High Engineering School (). It was formed as an important institution in the Nizam-I Cedid reforms and was formed with the expansion of the Imperial Naval Engineering School (M√ºhendish√¢ne-i Bahr√Æ-i H√ºm√¢yun), which had been the first modern engineering school of the Ottoman Empire and the only one to precede the Imperial School of Military Engineering. The location was chosen its Hask√∂y due to its remoteness at the time to prevent students, along with humbaracƒ±s and laƒüƒ±mcƒ±s that were to be located adjacent to the school from coming into contact with the Janissaries in Constantinople. The construction work began on 14 July 1793 and ended in September 1795. The initial policy had been not to include any foreigners in the staff, which led to the four scholars, H√ºseyin Rƒ±fkƒ± Tamani, ƒ∞br√¢him K√¢mi, H√¢fƒ±z Seyyid ƒ∞br√¢him Edhem and Elhac H√¢fƒ±z Abdullah be the only ones to teach at the institution under Abdurrahman Efendi, a scholar of geometry and algebra until 1801, when a scholar of English origin was employed. Later, under head instructor (Ba≈ühoca) Ishak Efendi, who was an 1815 graduate of the school and had been appointed the deputy principal of the then-principal H√ºseyin Rƒ±fkƒ± Tamani in 1816, and who oversaw the school between 1830 until his death in 1836, the school saw great improvement and an attempt to apply the curriculum of French schools of engineering. Despite its being a military school, civilians were also allowed to enroll. Selim III worked to provide all necessary facilities to the school, including the import of equipment from Europe and the establishment of a printing press. The school consisted of four years. In the first year, the students studied calligraphy, spelling, painting, Arabic, French, numbers and an introduction to geometry. In the second year, they studied arithmetic, advanced geometry, Arabic, French and geography. In the third year, they studied geography, planar trigonometry, algebra, surveying and military history. In the fourth year, they studied cross-sections of cones, differentiation, integration, mechanics, ballistics, astronomy, fortifications and shooting practice. The fourth year curriculum required knowledge of advanced mathematics. Mining as a part of the military (laƒüƒ±mcƒ±lƒ±k), map drawing and artillery were among other areas studied.

Its history goes back to Deutsche Annington, which merged with GAGFAH and was subsequently renamed Vonovia. The company currently owns around 400,000 apartments in Germany, Sweden, and Austria, making it a significant market player in these countries. Vonovia is a member of the DAX 30 and STOXX Europe 600 blue-chip indexes, and is one of the largest listed companies in Germany and Europe. History Early years At the end of the 1990s, the German government decided to privatize railway workers' homes as part of the railway reform. The Japanese financial group Nomura Holdings and its subsidiary Deutsche Annington (named after Annington Homes from Great Britain) sought to acquire them. After years of negotiations, the company finally received a significant share in 2000. The company responded to criticism of the sale with extensive exclusive rights, such as a lifetime right of residence and a restriction on rent increases. Besides, tenants were allowed to purchase their property. In the following years, Deutsche Annington invested in further smaller stocks of railway workers' apartments, which had previously remained in the ownership of the federal government. Acquisitions Deutsche Annington took over several smaller holdings, for example, from Allianz and RWE. In 2003, the E.ON energy group also put its real estate business up for sale under the name Viterra. With the acquisition of over 150,000 apartments, Deutsche Annington became the market leader in Germany. It was the largest transaction of its kind in the country's history, which met with criticism from unions and tenant protection associations alike. In the course of this, Terra Firma Capital Partner's majority shareholding in Deutsche Annington was repeatedly brought up as a central theme. Deutsche Annington achieved its returns with a combination of renting and selling apartments. It was instrumental in shaping the concept of socially responsible tenant privatization. In this way, the company wanted to raise funds to expand its portfolio to half a million and later even to one million apartments. In 2007, Deutsche Annington announced that it would again turn away from tenant privatization. From then on, the company concentrated on smaller acquisitions, such as the Sparkasse savings bank subsidiary Corpus. Going public In 2010, the profit of Deutsche Annington exceeded the 500 million euro mark for the first time. Nevertheless, the global economic and financial crisis made access to cheap debt capital more difficult. Refinancing became one of the main problems of the entire real estate industry. For this reason, an IPO was back on the agenda. To this end, the company hired Rolf Buch, a former member of the Bertelsmann executive board, as CEO. He emphasized above all the size of the company as a distinguishing feature. The rise in key interest rates dampened the interest of potential investors so that the IPO had to be postponed several times. In 2013, Deutsche Annington finally placed its shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange with a lower volume and a reduced issue price. Two years later, the company became the first representative of the real estate industry to be included in the DAX, the index of the largest listed stock corporations in Germany. Vonovia origins The media had already reported on Deutsche Annington's interest in GAGFAH in 2003. At the end of 2014, Deutsche Annington then officially offered to take over the competitor for around 3.9 billion euros to create a leading residential property group in Europe. Following the approval of the shareholders and the antitrust authorities, the transaction was completed ahead of schedule in March 2015. In 2015, the annual General Meeting voted to rename the company Vonovia to modernize its external image. The administrative and statutory headquarters were moved to the new offices in Bochum. European expansion In contrast, Vonovia failed with its offer for Deutsche Wohnen, but at least prevented the planned merger with LEG Immobilien. The company then turned to the neighboring states: A strategic partnership was agreed with the French housing company Soci√©t√© Nationale Immobili√®re (now CNC Habitat) in 2017. The acquisition of Conwert Immobilien and BUWOG made Vonovia the leading real estate group in Austria in 2018. In the same year, the company exceeded the threshold of 50% of the shares in the Swedish housing company Victoria Park, which has been 100% owned by Vonovia since 2019. Vonovia expanded its position there by acquiring its Swedish rival Hembla. Company Vonovia is a European stock company (Societas Europaea, SE for short). Its shares are traded on the regulated market (Prime Standard) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. They are part of the DAX and listed in the STOXX Europe, MSCI Germany, and EPRA, for example. According to the Deutsche B√∂rse definition, more than 90 % are in free float. Vonovia's largest shareholders include the American fund company BlackRock (7.5 %) and the Norwegian central bank Norges Bank (6.6 %). The majority of investors are pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, international asset managers, and other long-term investors. There are also individual shareholders. The company's constitution follows the dualistic system of an executive board (\\"Vorstand\\") and a controlling body board (\\"Aufsichtsrat\\"). Currently, Vonovia is managed by Rolf Buch (Chairman and Chief Executive Officer), Arnd Fittkau, Helene von Roeder, and Daniel Riedl. The supervisory board of Vonovia has twelve members, led by J√ºrgen Fitschen, former Co- Chairman of the management board of Deutsche Bank. Portfolio According to the annual report 2019, Vonovia owned 416,236 residential units, 138,176 garages and parking spaces, as well as 6,748 commercial units. These extended to 653 domestic and foreign cities and municipalities. Based on a total fair market value of more than 52 billion euros, the vast majority of the portfolio was located in Germany (84%), with the remainder in and Sweden (11%), and Austria (5%). Also, 78,691 apartments were managed by Vonovia on behalf of third parties.

The facility offers a range of services for the treatment of horses. They have cared for many famous Thoroughbreds both at the racetrack and on the farm. They also provide support for other equine sporting events such as the 2010 FEI World Equestrian Games held in Lexington. Rood & Riddle operates branches in Saratoga Springs, New York and Wellington, Florida. Background William (\\"Bill\\") Rood, DVM, is the Chief Executive Officer and President of Rood & Riddle. He graduated from the University of Louisville Equine Industry Program. W. Thomas Riddle, DVM, whose father was also a veterinarian, grew up in South Carolina and graduated from the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine in 1978. His specialty is reproductive veterinary medicine and he still frequently travels to the horse farms around Lexington. Riddle joined Rood's practice in 1981 and became a partner in 1984. They founded Rood & Riddle Equine Hospital in 1986. Larry Bramlage, DVM, is another partner at Rood & Riddle, specializing in equine orthopedic surgery. \\"For many orthopedic injuries, when I first started doing surgery, it was somewhat of a last-ditch effort,\\" he said in 2002. \\"Now orthopedic surgery has changed to where surgery is the first line of defense. Previously, the concern about doing surgery was that the surgery would do as much harm as the injury did.\\" Rood & Riddle has been called the \\"Mayo Clinic for horses\\" and is a full-service equine referral center. In a 2002 interview, Rood said the hospital treated about 10,000 cases each year, which included 4,600 surgeries and 1,293 arthroscopies. Their most common cases were colic and pneumonia. At that time, the hospital had 36 vets and 135 support staff. By 2013, the hospital had grown to a 24-acre facility with 50 vets and nine barns capable of holding 150 equine patients. The Lexington property includes surgical centers, a podiatry unit, a reproductive center, a colic intensive care unit, a neonatal unit and advanced diagnostic technology. In 2013, Rood & Riddle expanded to Saratoga Springs, New York after purchasing Saratoga Equine Veterinary Services. In 2016, they purchased a hospital facility in Wellington, Florida, a center of sport horse activities such as show jumping. Notable cases In the spring of 2001, Riddle was the first to report on a number of cases of in utero foal deaths, referred to as mare reproductive loss syndrome (MRLS). Thousands of mares in central Kentucky were affected, resulting in an economic loss estimated to be as high $500 million. Rood & Riddle participated in a number of studies and helped determine that eastern tent caterpillars were responsible for the outbreak. By 2002, MRLS had decreased to only 30% of the previous year and was virtually eliminated by 2003. Other notable cases include: * In 2008, Chelokee suffered a catastrophic injury while racing that was surgically repaired by Bramlage by fusing the fetlock joint. * Kip Deville was treated for colic in 2009 but then developed laminitis, leading to his death in 2010 after months of treatment at Rood & Riddle. * In February 2013, Rachel Alexandra underwent a six-hour surgery performed by Dr. Brett Woodie at Rood & Riddle after she suffered a life-threatening colon injury during foaling. * In 2014, Wise Dan, who was treated throughout his career by Bramlage for orthopedic conditions, underwent colic surgery at Rood & Riddle and was later able to return to racing. * In October 2014, Cigar died at age 24 after being surgically treated for severe osteoarthritis in his neck. * In March 2015, Groupie Doll delivered a premature colt, who was nursed back to health at Rood & Riddle. * In April 2016, Zenyatta's four-day-old colt died after being treated at Rood & Riddle for meconium aspiration syndrome. Although best known for their treatment of Thoroughbreds, Rood & Riddle is involved in all types of equine sports. They were named the Official Equine Hospital and Veterinary Partner for the 2010 FEI World Equestrian Games, and provided veterinary support at a series of test events starting in 2009. Since then, they have been associated with the annual Alltech National Horse Show in Lexington.

Late in March 1797 Vice-Admiral Lord Kingsmill received intelligence that a French cruiser had been seen off the Skellocks on the coast of Ireland. Kingsmill dispatched on 28 March, and on 1 April Hazard found the French vessel. After a chase of seven hours, Hazard caught her quarry, but only because the privateer had lost both topmasts. The privateer was the brig Hardi, of 18 guns and 130 men. (Another source gives her complement as 164 men.Norman (1887), p.432.)

It began when the Kazan khan looted Russian merchants at the annual Kazan trade fair. Russia sent an army which was defeated. The matter was settled by treaty in 1507 and peace lasted until 1521. In 1502 Russia placed on the Kazan throne its prot√©g√© Mohammad Amin (r1502-18). He married the widow of his half-brother khan Ilham Ghali of Kazan (r 1479-87) who had been deposed by the Russians and exiled to Vologda. It is said that she turned her husband against the Russians. One of his first acts was to put to death Kel Akhmed, the leader of the pro-Russian faction. In June 1505 Mohammad Amin arrested the Russian ambassador and plundered the Russian merchants who had gathered for the annual trade fair. Those merchants who were not killed were held either for ransom or for sale as slaves. Expecting vengeance, Mohammad sent 40000 Tartars and 20000 Nogais against Nizhny Novgorod and Murom. The Murom force seems to have been driven away. Nizhny Novgorod was short of troops so the commander freed and armed 300 prisoners from the Lithuanian war. This was enough to save the fort. The Nogai chief, who was Mohammad‚Äôs brother-in-law, was killed. The two groups quarreled and the Nogais withdrew. The Tartars withdrew with their booty and the Russians chose not to follow. In 1506 Vasili III of Russia, who had just come to the throne, sent two armies against Kazan. One army went down the Volga. On the 22nd of May they attacked, not waiting for the second army. The Tartars cut off them off from their ships and defeated them. On the 22nd of June the second army unexpectedly appeared and made a great slaughter. The Russians fell to looting, the Tartars counterattacked and most of the Russians were killed. (?Howorth, who seems to be following Karamzin, has the June attack occur during the Kazan fair with the Russians looting its goods. It is difficult to see why merchants would come to a fair when the previous year‚Äôs fair had been looted. He also reports a story from Herberstein, who has the Tartars deliberately abandon their camp and counter attack when the Russians began looting. The Russian Wikipedia says nothing about looting and has the two armies sequential rather than simultaneous.) In March 1507 Mohammad sent an ambassador to Moscow offering to give up the prisoners and make peace. Vasili, being more concerned with Lithuania, accepted. The treaty was signed on September 8 in Moscow and December 23 in Kazan. Early in the following year the captives were released except for those who had already been sold to Crimea or central Asia.

Early life and education A native of Virginia's Northern Neck, from a long-established family, Murphy was born to Virginia lawyer and 10-term delegate William Tayloe Murphy Sr. and his wife Katherine Bradford Griffith. The younger Murphy attended Warsaw High School and the Virginia Episcopal School, then Hampden-Sydney College. He graduated in 1953. In 1954 he was commissioned an ensign in the United States Naval Reserve and served aboard the USS Newport News and on the staff of the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO. Returning to civilian life, Murphy received a LLB degree from the University of Virginia in 1960. While at UVA, Murphy was on the editorial board of the Law Review and was a member of the Raven Society. He married Helen Murphy. Career Murphy was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1960, the year his father retired from the General Assembly. The younger Murphy began practicing law with Hunton & Williams in Richmond, then resigned in 1964, two years after his father's death, to practice with Smith, Murphy and Taliaferro in Warsaw, Virginia. From 1970 until 1982, he served on the Westmoreland County Planning Commission, including some years as chairman, and on the county's Zoning Board of Appeals. From 1980 until 1986, he served on the Virginia State Bar's Executive Council. Murphy first ran to become the Democratic delegate for what was then called the 47th Virginia House district and included parts of King George, Lancaster, Northumberland and Westmoreland Counties in 1977, but lost to seven-term Republican delegate Calvin G. Sanford, who won 54% of the vote.Richmond Times Dispatch, Nov. 9, 1977 p. A-4 When Sanford declined to seek election in 1981, Murphy won with 64% of the vote against Republican Lawrence M. Traylor. The following year (1982) the district was renumbered the 99th after the reapportionment due to the 1980 census, and gained parts of Stafford County. In 1982, 1983, 1985, 1987 and 1989, Murphy ran unopposed for re-election, and handily defeated Independent Edwin B. Garland in 1991. After the 1990 census reapportionment (1992), the 99th district lost its Stafford County portion but gained parts of Essex County. Murphy defeated Republican Sidney M. Peterson in 1993 with 61% of the vote, Republican Henry Lane Hull in 1995 with 57% of the vote, and again ran unopposed in 1997. He announced his legislative retirement in 1999 at age 66, and his legislative assistant Albert C. Pollard Jr. won election to that seat (and last won re-election in 2011). Murphy's main legislative accomplishment during those 18 years was passage of the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act in 1986 and its renewal in 1996, despite the political peril of imposing state authority on local land use decisions in his conservative district. He also sponsored legislation regulating nutrient runoff from agricultural feedlots and boat paint pesticides into Chesapeake Bay. Murphy served on the Chesapeake Bay Commission (1980-1999), including his time as chairman.

It is based on the 2012 graphic novel of the same name by cartoonist John \\"Derf\\" Backderf, who had been friends with Dahmer in high school in the 1970s, until the time Dahmer began his killing spree. The film stars Ross Lynch as Dahmer, and also stars Alex Wolff, Dallas Roberts, and Anne Heche. The film premiered at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival and was released in the United States on November 3, 2017. Plot In 1974, Jeffrey Dahmer is a high school freshman living in Bath, Ohio, with his parents, Lionel and Joyce, and his little brother, Dave. Jeffrey develops an obsession with a male jogger whom he sees every day from his school bus. For a hobby, Jeffrey collects dead animals that he dissolves to the bones using chemicals provided by his father, who is a chemist. This hobby is initiated by his obsessive interest in how animals are \\"fitted together\\". In 1978, Lionel trashes Jeffrey's collection of bones and orders him to make friends at school. During school, Jeffrey imitates spasms, clears his backpack, and makes loud noises, catching the attention of aspiring artist John \\"Derf\\" Backderf and his friends. Jeffrey inspires Derf to draw him in various situations; drawings that would later be incorporated into Derf's graphic novel My Friend Dahmer. Derf and his friends form the \\"Dahmer Fan Club,\\" using Jeffrey for a variety of pranks such as sneaking him in every club yearbook photo, and conning their way to a meeting with then Vice President Walter Mondale during a school field trip to Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, Joyce starts relapsing into chronic mental illness, leading to increasingly bitter fights between her and Lionel. To cope, Jeffrey turns to drinking heavily, and begins killing animals himself. The jogger with whom Jeffrey is obsessed turns out to be Dr. Matthews, the physician of one of Derf's friends. Jeffrey fakes a cold so that he can get an appointment with him, and he can examine Jeffrey naked. Dr. Matthews becomes uncomfortable during the hernia exam when he notices that Jeffrey has an erection. When Jeffrey returns home, he retires to his room and masturbates to the incident. The following night, Jeffrey fantasizes about being with Dr. Matthews' corpse. He starts stalking Dr. Matthews with a baseball bat but never goes through with attacking him. Jeffrey's father moves out while Jeffrey is away on the field trip. After the trip, Jeffrey makes some attempts to stay connected to his friends such as bringing a date to the prom but ultimately drifts away from them. At graduation, Lionel hands Jeffrey the keys to the family Volkswagen Beetle which he would later use to commit his first murder. Unbeknownst to Lionel, Joyce leaves Ohio to live with relatives in Wisconsin, taking Dave with her and leaving Jeffrey completely alone. That evening, Derf spots Jeffrey walking home alone, with blood on his fingernails. Derf offers a ride to Jeffrey, finding him living alone with no plans for the future. Derf tells him that he is leaving for college the following day and offers him his drawings of Jeffrey, which he declines. He menacingly invites Derf inside for a beer, but Derf turns him down. As Derf walks back to his car, Jeffrey picks up a baseball bat and is about to strike him with it, although he later puts it down. As Derf gets in the car and drives home, he notices the bat. Jeffrey never has contact with his high school friends again. The next morning, Jeffrey drives around and picks up hitchhiker Steven Hicks from a concert. The closing credits note that Hicks was never seen again and that Jeffrey Dahmer admitted to killing 17 men when he was finally arrested. Cast *Ross Lynch as Jeffrey Dahmer, Lionel and Joyce's son, who has obsessive fantasies of rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. *Alex Wolff as John \\"Derf\\" Backderf, Dahmer's closest friend and an aspiring graphic artist *Vincent Kartheiser as Dr. Matthews *Anne Heche as Joyce Dahmer, Lionel's wife and Jeffrey's mother *Dallas Roberts as Lionel Dahmer, Joyce's husband and Jeffrey's father *Tommy Nelson as Neil Davis, one of Dahmer and Backderf's friends *Harrison Holzer as Mike, one of Dahmer and Backderf's friends Production The script appeared on 2014's Black List. Ross Lynch was cast as the teenage Dahmer in 2016. Lynch had previously been employed as a teen actor by the Disney Channel, most notably starring in the show Austin & Ally. John Backderf, the author of the graphic novel, was enthusiastic about this casting against type, stating that Lynch's performance would make viewers \\"uncomfortable because it's so familiar\\". Later in the month Alex Wolff, Vincent Kartheiser and Anne Heche joined the cast, with Heche playing Dahmer's mother. Filming took place in Bath, Ohio and Middleburg Heights, Ohio. Scenes depicting Dahmer‚Äôs home life were filmed in Dahmer‚Äôs actual childhood home in Ohio. Actors in the movie said that it was very strange to be in the home where the serial killer lived. They also mentioned that the house is where Dahmer's pathology began. In comparison to the comic, Derf is added into scenes in the movie that he was not actually present at including the fishing scene, the DC trip, and the prom. It was also Derf, not Neil, who felt bad about the mall incident. Most prominently, it was Neil who gave Dahmer the final ride home, not Derf, and it was likely right after Hicks‚Äô murder, not before. Release My Friend Dahmer premiered at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival on April 21, 2017. On May 15, 2017, FilmRise acquired distribution rights to the film, planning to release it in the fall. The film was released in limited theaters on November 3, 2017, with a wider release the following month. Critical response On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 86% rating based on 88 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"My Friend Dahmer opens a window into the making of a serial killer whose conclusions are as empathetic as they are deeply troubling.\\" Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".

It owned several companies in the North and the City of London - including Hawks and Co., Hawks, Crawshay, and Stanley, and Hawks, Crawshay and Sons - all of which featured the Hawks name in the company name and had iron manufacture and engineering as their main enterprises. The Hawks company reached the apogee of its power in the early Victorian period, during which it employed over 2000 persons, and its reputation for engineering and bridge building was worldwide. Its Gateshead factories were termed New Deptford and New Woolwich after the location of two of its warehouses on the River Thames, Deptford and Woolwich. The company owned its own ships, which it used to transport its manufacture. It built the striking High Level Bridge across the River Tyne that was opened by Queen Victoria in 1849, bridges as far afield as Constantinople and India, and lighthouses in France. It produced ironclad warships and other materials for the Royal Navy to exponential profits during the Napoleonic Wars and completed several large contracts for the East India Company. It also produced the first iron boat, the Vulcan, in 1821. Several members of the Hawks family were involved in merchant banking, several in Freemasonry, and several in the advocacy of Whig free-trade politics. Notable members included Sir Robert Shafto Hawks (1768-1840); Joseph Hawks (1791-1873), merchant banker and Sheriff of Newcastle; George Hawks (1801-1863), Freemason and Grand Master of the Grand Cross Chapter of the Holy Temple of Jerusalem (Knights Templar), and Mayor of Gateshead; Mary Hawks (b.1829), who was the wife of Richard Clement Moody, the founder of British Columbia; and Colonel Richard Stanley Hawks Moody (1854-1930). The family developed areas of West London, including Pembroke Square, Kensington. The High Level Bridge (left) built by the Hawks dynasty The poet Joseph Skipsey worked for the Hawks company, at their Gateshead ironworks, from 1859 to 1863, until one of his children was killed in an accident at the works in 1863. The job was obtained for Skipsey by James Thomas Clephan, the editor of the Gateshead Observer. Foundation The Hawks company was established by William Hawks (1708‚Äì1755), who worked for Sir Ambrose Crowley, Sheriff of London. In the late 1740s, Hawks established a set of workshops on waste ground along the river at Gateshead. When Hawks died - at Gateshead on 23 February 1755 - the works passed to the eldest son, William Hawks (bap. 1730, d. 1810), who, with his first wife, Elizabeth Dixon, established the Hawks' industrial empire. William (d.1810) formed a partnership with Thomas Longridge (bap. 1751, d. 1803), in 1770, and shortly afterwards acquired a plating forge at Beamish, County Durham, which was the first of four separate metalworking sites operated by Hawks and Longridge along Beamish Burn. In the 1780s, a forge at Lumley, in County Durham, and slitting and rolling mills, on the River Blyth in Northumberland, were acquired by the company.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Hawks familyThe inauguration of the High Level Bridge by HM Queen Victoria on 28 September 1849 By 1790, the works at Gateshead consisted of a substantial industrial complex that produced steel, anchors, heavy chains, steam-engine components, and a great diversity of smaller iron wares. The supply of ironware to the Board of Admiralty became a speciality. The firm's products were transported by the Gordon and Stanley families, the latter of whom had links to the old ordnance industry of the Weald and the naval yards of the River Thames and the Medway. The family also owned the Bedlington Ironworks during this period. Height: 1810 - 1880 On 4 December 1810, the estate and works of William Hawks passed to his surviving sons: George Hawks (1766‚Äì1820) of Blackheath, Sir Robert Shafto Hawks (1768‚Äì1840), and John Hawks (1770‚Äì1830). The Hawks Company built Hawks Cottages in the 1830s in the Saltmeadows district of Gateshead for its workers. The Hawks works covered 44 acres by the end of the 1830s, and employed between 800 and 900 persons. At the time of the visit of the British Association to Newcastle in 1863, it employed 1500 people, and owned 92 marine engines and 58 land engines, which together provided 5000 horse power, and 33 puddling furnaces. The family's New Greenwich ironworks at Gateshead was the town's largest employer until its closure, in mysterious circumstances, in 1889. The poet Joseph Skipsey worked for the Hawks company, at their Gateshead ironworks, from 1859 to 1863, until one of his children was killed in a fatal accident at the works in 1863. The job was obtained for Skipsey by James Thomas Clephan, the editor of the Gateshead Observer. The Hawks company produced numerous ironclad warships for the Royal Navy and the East India Company. Works The Vulcan The first iron boat to be built, which was a rowing boat that was named the Vulcan, was constructed, in 1821, at the Hawks's ironworks. When Sir Robert Shafto Hawks was informed of the purpose for which Samuel Tyne, the boat's inventor, had purchased iron from the Hawks company, he proffered all of the iron required for the task free of charge. Sir Robert arranged for cannons to be fired at the launch of the boat, which subsequently won races against wooden boats of the same capacity. However, on Ascension Day, 1826, when, laden with 12 persons including the rowers of the Vulcan, a boat accompanying the Mayor's barge down the river was hit by a steam vessel, two of the Vulcan's rowers were killed, and the Vulcan was subsequently abandoned. Products At around the year 1842, the Hawks company erected a cast iron bridge at York, which spans the river Ouse in one arch of 172 feet in width. They company also reconstructed the Rowland Burdon iron bridge at Sunderland, which consists of a single arch of a width of 237 feet. The company also constructed the wrought iron gates for the Northumberland Docks; the iron lighthouses at Gunfleet, Harwich, and Calais; and the iron pier at Madras. The company also built bridges in Constantinople. Sir Robert Hawks financed the construction of St John's Church, Gateshead Fell. The company built the High Level Bridge over the Tyne, which consisted of 5050 tons of iron. George Hawks, the Mayor of Gateshead (see below), drove in the last key of the structure on 7 June 1849. The bridge was opened by Queen Victoria later that year. The carriageway level of the High Level Bridge The company produced ironclad warships and other materials for the Royal Navy to exponential profits during the Napoleonic Wars, and completed several large contracts for the East India Company It also built paddle steamers and hydraulic dredgers. Property The family developed also developed areas of London, including Pembroke Square, Kensington. Pembroke Square, Kensington was developed by the Hawks dynasty Notable members Sir Robert Shafto Hawks (1768-1840) Robert Shafto Hawks became the director of the firm subsequent to the death of his father. He was knighted by the Prince Regent, in 1817, for his role in suppressing riots in the winter of that year. Shafto Hawks was involved in Freemasonry and served as Worshipful Master of the oldest lodge in Northumberland. Shafto Hawks is commemorated in Newcastle Cathedral, and his portrait hangs in Shipley Art Gallery. Sir Robert married Hannah Pembroke Akenhead (1766 - 1863) in 1790 and had two sons. One son, William, entered the church. Sir Robert and Lady Hannah's blind son, David, was a musical prodigy who composed and published marches for military bands at 9 years of age. He later specialized in the composition of Tyrolean, Scottish, and Welsh airs. He was described as showing 'a most amazing proof of musical genius and early proficiency' when 17 years of age and as a 'true musical genius'. George Hawks (1801-1863) Sir Robert's nephew George Hawks (1801‚Äì1863) , of Redheugh Hall, succeeded him as head of the Hawks company. George Hawks was an advocate of free-trade, and a vehement supporter of the Whigs and Sir William Hutt MP, who was MP for Gateshead after 1841. Hutt campaigned to have George Hawks knighted. Hawks's home, Redheugh Hall, became one of the organizing centres of Liberalism in the north east of England. George Hawks served as the first Mayor of Gateshead in 1836, and, subsequently, served in the same position again in 1848 and 1849. George Hawks was extensively involved in Freemasonry. George Hawks served as Grand Master of the Grand Cross Chapter of the Holy Temple of Jerusalem (Knights Templar). He also served as Past Master of the Lodge of Newcastle upon Tyne, Deputy of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Northumberland, and a Full Affiliated Member of The Celtic Lodge of Edinburgh and Leith, No.291. Hawks was made a Freemason in Guernsey, and was later described as 'an excellent mason'. Joseph Hawks (1791-1873) Joseph Stanley Hawks, , of Jesmond House, Newcastle upon Tyne, was the son of George Hawks of Blackheath (1766 -1820), who was the brother of Sir Robert Shafto Hawks. Joseph Stanley Hawks was a merchant banker who served as Sheriff of Newcastle. He married Mary Elizabeth Boyd, daughter of William Boyd, merchant banker of the prominent Boyd merchant banking familyHoward, Joseph Jackson (1893‚Äì1906). Heraldic Visitation of England and Wales. 8. p. 161-164. that founded the bank of Newcastle.A History of Banks, Bankers, & Banking in Northumberland, Durham, and North Yorkshire, Illustrating the Commercial Development of the North of England, from 1755 to 1894 Mary Boyd's brother was industrialist Edward Fenwick Boyd. William Boyd was a descendant of Sir Francis Liddell, the second son of Sir Thomas Liddell, 1st Baronet, whose family monopolized the government of the North of England in the 16th and 17th centuries, and his second wife, Frances Forster, previously wife of Nicholas Forster of Bamburgh Castle, Northumberland, and daughter of Sir William Chaytor of Croft. Mary Hawks, later Moody (b.1829) Joseph's daughter, Mary Susannah Hawks, married Richard Clement Moody, the founder of British Columbia. Her 13 children included Josephine 'Zeffie' Moody, who married Arthur Newall, son of Robert Stirling Newall, a close business associate of the Hawks family, Colonel Richard Stanley Hawks Moody, and Colonel Henry de Clervaulx Moody. Richard Clement Moody named the 400-foot hill in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, \\"Mary Hill\\" after his wife, Mary. The Royal British Columbia Museum possesses a trove of 42 letters written by Mary Moody from various colonies of the British Empire, mostly from the Colony of British Columbia (1858‚Äì66), to her mother and her sister, Emily Hawks, in England. Mary Moody was highly literate, having been tutored in literature, penmanship, and French, and her letters have been of great interest to scholars studying the perspective of the English ruling class in the colonies of the British Empire. Richard Stanley Hawks Moody (1854-1930) Colonel Richard Stanley Hawks Moody, CB (1854 - 1930). Colonel Richard Stanley Hawks Moody was a distinguished officer of the British Army. Decline Hannah, Lady Hawks (d. 1863), the widow of Sir Robert Shafto Hawks, and her two sons sold their shares, in 1840, to George Crawshay a member of a prominent iron-making family of south Wales. George Crawshay had been bought out of his family's iron merchanting business in London by his brother, William Crawshay II. The business developed by William Hawks had been divided between his three eldest surviving sons in 1810. When he was able to acquire the shares of Joseph Hawks, the only surviving son of George Hawks of Blackheath, he obtained a second third of the company. The Bedlington works passed eventually to a cousin of the Hawkses, Michael Longridge (1785‚Äì1853), a pioneer of railway technology, and an associate of Robert Stephenson, under whose superintendence the works became a training ground for a generation of celebrated engineers; including Sir Daniel Gooch. The dominant influence over the firm of Hawks, Crawshay & Sons in its last years was George Crawshay (1821‚Äì1896), the son of George Crawshay and his wife, Like George Hawks, George Crawshay became a considerable political figure in the north-east. However, Crawshay's management of the company was incompetent: he devoted much of his time to political pursuits and failed to modernize the company, which manufactured diverse products by diverse processes, to enable it to outcompete the newer specialist companies. The specialist companies, such as those owned by William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong and the William Galloway, the nail manufacturer, flourished as the Hawks company declined. In 1889, New Greenwich was suddenly closed, and Hawks, Crawshay, and Sons was liquidated. The circumstances surrounding the closure are mysterious: all of the firm's creditors were paid in full, but every single document of the company's archive was systematically destroyed by burning.

He was an evangelical interested in mission work. Life The second son of Charles Bernard of Eden Estate, Jamaica, and his wife Margaret, daughter of John Baker of Waresley House, Worcestershire, he was born at Clifton, Bristol on 11 November 1815; Mountague Bernard was his brother. After private education he matriculated in December 1833 at Exeter College, Oxford, He graduated B.A. in 1838, when he won the Ellerton theological prize with an essay On the Conduct and Character of St. Peter. In 1839 he was awarded the chancellor's prize for an English essay on The Classical Taste and Character compared with the Romantic. In 1840 Bernard was ordained deacon and licensed to the curacy of Great Baddow, Essex. Ordained priest in 1841, he succeeded to the vicarage of Great Baddow, where he remained until 1846. After working for a short time as curate of Harrow-on- the-Hill, he became in 1848 vicar of Terling, Essex. He showed more interest in foreign missions than many contemporaries. He was select preacher at Oxford in 1858, 1862, and 1882. In 1864 Bernard was appointed by Charles Simeon's trustees to the rectory of Walcot, Bath, a reflection of his strong evangelical sympathies. He increased the church accommodation and built St. Andrew's church and schools. In 1867 Robert Eden, the bishop of Bath and Wells, collated him to a prebendal stall in Wells Cathedral; and next year the dean and chapter elected him to a residentiary canonry. He succeeded to the chancellorship of the cathedral in 1879, and from 1880 to 1895 represented the chapter in Convocation. Bernard revived the cathedral grammar school, at his own cost provided buildings for it, and established a high school for girls. He was a frequent speaker at the Islington clerical meeting, He resigned Walcot in 1886, and went to live at Wimborne. In 1901 he retired from his canonry, retaining only the unpaid post of chancellor. Bernard died at High Hall, Wimborne, on 7 December 1904. Works In 1864 Bernard delivered Bampton lectures on The Progress of Doctrine in the New Testament (published, with a fifth edition in 1900). Other works were: * Before His Presence with a Song, 1885; 2nd edition 1887. * The Central Teaching of Jesus Christ, 1892. * Songs of the Holy Nativity, 1895. * The Word and Sacraments, 1904. Family Bernard married in 1841 Caroline, daughter of Benjamin Linthorne, of High Hall, Wimborne; she died in 1881, leaving two sons and seven daughters.

History Rogue originally started in 2007 in Toledo, Ohio by Bill Henniger when he had a hard time finding the necessary equipment for his new garage gym, a CrossFit affiliate. Initially, Rogue only sold other manufacturers' equipment through its website so that everything could be found and purchased in one spot, but there were still issues with customers having to deal with multiple manufacturers and their own shipping fees and schedules. Rogue began warehousing the equipment and ultimately building it themselves. The company grew into a facility in Columbus that was next to the CrossFit box that Henniger also owned. Rogue began offering more products and also started manufacturing more of them. Rogue Europe launched in Finland in January 2014 with Juha Puonti and 2009 CrossFit Games male champion Mikko Salo. Today Rogue previously operated out of a manufacturing facility and is one of the primary suppliers for equipment for CrossFit boxes around the world. Rogue has been building and providing all the equipment to the CrossFit Games and regional events since 2010. Fifteen semi-trucks of equipment were needed to supply the 2013 CrossFit Games at the StubHub Center in Carson, California, up from nine trucks used to supply the 2011 CrossFit Games. They also build equipment for Strongman, Powerlifting, and Olympic weightlifting. The company sponsors numerous CrossFit athletes around the world, such as Rich Froning Jr., Ben Smith, Camille Leblanc-Bazinet, Mat Fraser, Katr√≠n Dav√≠√∞sd√≥ttir, and Jason Khalipa. One of the first sponsored athletes was Henniger's future wife and 2008 CrossFit Games female champion, Caity Matter Henniger. Rogue also sponsors Strongman athletes such as Brian Shaw and Haf√æ√≥r J√∫l√≠us Bj√∂rnsson. Rogue was a contender for Inc.'s 2018 Company of the Year. In 2018, Rogue moved into a building a structure on of the former Timken Company property located on the southwest corner of East Fifth and Cleveland avenues in Columbus. The new building will consolidate their administrative, manufacturing, distribution, and retail operations. It includes two gyms and showroom. As of 2019, Rogue Fitness had 600 employees.

It had ceased to function by 1568, when the Archbishopric of Mainz dissolved it and used the premises as a Kameralhof (finance office).

Reception Ken Johnson of The New York Times singled the painting out as unusual in Wyeth's oeuvre because it \\"evinces social consciousness\\", something that otherwise is absent from the artist's works and makes him different from his contemporary Norman Rockwell.

It was released on September 23, 2016 via Frankenfish Records in North America. The singles for the album are \\"Nobody\\", \\"Over\\", and \\"Let Me Be Your Girl\\". Development For the second time, since the creation of Chesapeake in 2011, Yamagata utilized the fan-funded music platform PledgeMusic to fund the album Tightrope Walker. The album production ideas were spontaneous, experimental. Per her interview with AXS, she stated \\"I just completely let whatever road we felt like taking. Whoever musicians were in the room, whatever instruments were in the room, we tried everything. It was a lot of experimentation. [...] All of the production ideas were just very in- the-moment, spontaneous and fun to try. That led to us having a collection of arrangements I hadn't done before. We have mandolin on some tracks, of course I love strings and electric guitar, I write a lot on piano. Because we recorded in my house, we had the leisure of time, a very relaxed feel in the middle of the woods, with some great musicians up in Woodstock. I think a lot of the sounds came because we had fun with it. I was trying to trace the lyric, see what the storyline is, and then match the soundscape to what I'm trying to get across with the idea. That often takes me to strange, and unusual places.\\" The album name was influenced by an interview with Philippe Petit, the tightrope walker who crossed between the twin towers in New York City in 1974. Yamagata was affected by his response to an interview question that asked why he did what he did, and he responded \\"Why - There is no why.\\" Yamagata's concept for the album started with a vision she had at her home in Woodstock, when she envisioned several strangers sitting in a tent, along with scenes from each of their past. This communal gathering showed there was a connection between the strangers.

Early life Rachel Davis Dubois was born on January 25, 1892 in Clarksboro, New Jersey. She grew up on a farm and was raised as a Quaker. She was married to Nathan Stewart DuBois on 19 June 1915. Prior to the marriage, Nathan expressed doubts about having children. Following her disappointment, Rachel agreed to a childless marriage with the understanding that she would be free to pursue a career.  Teaching Career and the Development of the Woodbury Plan  In 1924, DuBois was hired as a teacher at the Woodbury High School in New Jersey. Shortly after assuming this position, and with the support of several colleagues, DuBois formed a senior assembly centered around the subject of \\"Americanization.\\" The group met twice a month to stage productions highlighting the cultural contributions to American society by various ethnic and immigrant groups. While their initial emphasis was on creating tolerance for those who are different from one's self, the focus soon shifted to fostering \\"sympathetic\\" attitudes. The sessions were very popular with students and fellow teachers, but members of the community did not approve of DuBois's views on racial equality, women's rights and pacifism. At the urging of the local American Legion, she was asked to resign. However, DuBois was a tenured teacher; thus, she was able to retain her position and continue with the assemblies. DuBois continued in this capacity until her resignation in 1930, when she left to attend Teachers College at Columbia University. She wanted to \\"study how attitudes are formed and can be changed.\\" The Development of Intercultural Education Even while attending Teachers College, DuBois' work with the Woodbury Plan continued. A number of schools were interested in implementing the plan into their curricula, and to manage all the requests, the Service Bureau for Human Relations was formed, with DuBois as the director. Around the same time, the organization recognized that educating fellow teachers was nearly as important as educating students. Thus, the Service Bureau began offering courses for the educators at all the schools where they operated. In 1933, DuBois was invited to teach a course on the subject at Boston University. Over the next several years, the Service Bureau led workshops on intercultural education at conferences and universities, including a groundbreaking workshop at Sarah Lawrence. At this workshop, teachers were asked to share their classroom problems within small groups and then talk together to find solutions. Elements of intercultural education were woven throughout the workshop. On page 76 of her memoir, DuBois writes, \\"As far as I know we were the first to use the term intercultural education.\\" \\"Americans All, Immigrants All\\" In 1939, DuBois and her associates came up with the idea for a radio show, in an effort to broadcast their message to a larger audience. DuBois approached John Studebaker, the U.S. Commissioner of Education, about the program and together, they arranged for CBS to air the program in a series of 26 half-hour episodes. To facilitate the coordination and planning, DuBois was appointed as a consultant to the U.S. Office of Education. After its 26-week run, CBS received an award from the Women's National Radio Committee for the best program of the year for public service.  Group Conversation  DuBois is credited with being the founder of \\"group conversation.\\" Group conversation is a technique in which people from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds come together and discuss various topics, such as spring festivals, in order to discover their underlying commonalities.

After he was a student at college in Rome in period 1570‚Äî75 he became a priest confessor at Illyrian College of St. Jerome.: \\"Le avventure di Bartolomeo Sfondrati Il primo gesuita ragusino fu Bartolomeo Sfondrati (1541-1583), entrato nella Compagnia all'et√† di ventotto anni a Pavia, dove esercitava la professione di avvocato. Inviato al Collegio Illirico di Loreto, divenne sacerdote confessore.\\"  Missionary campaigns  In the period between February 1576 and 1578 Sfondrati was a missionary in Boka Kotorska bay. In period 1580‚Äî83 Sfondrati was missionary in Belgrade.: \\"Oko 1580 ‚Äî 83. u Beogradu je kao misionar djelovao isusovac Bartol Sfondrati, rodom Dubrovƒçanin.\\" In 1580 Sfondrati accompanied Bonifacio de Stefanis (Bonifacije Drakolica) who was appointed as apostolic visitor and delegate to Dalmatia, Herzegovina, Bosnia, Croatia, Vallachia, Slavonia, Serbia and other European territories governed by the Ottomans.: \\"Godine 1580. apostolski je vizitator i delegat za Dalmaciju, Hercegovinu, Bosnu, Hrvatsku, Slavoniju, Srbiju, Ugarsku, Vla≈°ku i druge europske krajeve pod turskom vla≈°ƒáu, a pratilac mu je dubrovaƒçki isusovac Bartol Sfondrati.\\" Together with Sfondrati, the Holy Seat sent another jesuit to accompany de Stefanis. It was Franciscan from Bosnia, Antun de Mattei. Two of them carried two big suitcases to de Stefanis, full of books they were instructed to deliver to priests of both Catholic and Orthodox religion. Sfondrati reported that during his voyage into Ottoman Balkans he met many Christians who converted to Islam to avoid payment of taxes, from which Muslims were exempt.: \\"Sfondrati je zapisao kako je velik broj kr≈°ƒáana preuzeo tursku vjeru jer su tako izbjegli plaƒáanje \\"dukata po glavi\\", ƒçega su kao muslimani bili osloboƒëeni.\\" Sfondrati stated that there was about 5,000 Catholics at that time in Sarajevo, mostly slaves and traders. He also recorded that many Christians lived in Herzegovina, most of them being Orthodox Serbs.: U Hercegovini je bilo mnogo kr≈°ƒáana, \\"no ti su veƒáinom srpski raskolnici\\" (pravoslavni).\\" De Stefanis died on this difficult visitation in Timi»ôoara in 1582. Sfondrati died in poverty and dimwitted, also in Timi»ôoara, on 17 November 1583.  Literary work  On 12 January 1576 Sfondrati wrote from Dubrovnik to Claudio Aquaviva emphasizing that Ragusan Republic have intention to publish a catechism on Slavic language for its younger population.

In 1569, during the Desmond Rebellions, the abbey was burned by government soldiers led by Sir Humphrey Gilbert, originally from Devon and a half-brother of Sir Walter Raleigh. The following year Fr. Dermot O'Mulrooney and two other friars returned to the friary, but were murdered by government forces. The Franciscans came back again in 1645, only to be expelled by Cromwellian forces. It was 1658 before they could once again occupy the Abbey. They finally left for the last time in 1748 after a dispute with Fr. James Butler, Vicar-General of Cashel & Emly diocese and the abbey fell into ruin. The friars went to Mitchelstown, and the last friar of Moor Abbey died there in 1804. An attempt by the Royal Irish Constabulary to detonate the Abbey in 1921 failed. Building The ruined church consists of a nave and chancel, separated by a tall bell-tower with sedilia. In the chancel is a double piscina. Beside the doorway in the north wall of the chancel is a font. No other buildings remain.

Before taking up athletics Sugar represented Wales at field hockey captaining the under-20s team. Personal career Sugar was born in Saffron Walden, England in 1991. She was born with talipes (club foot), which meant her foot was turned in. Sugar underwent surgery to correct the problem as a baby, but it left her with no movement in her ankle. She was educated at Newport Free Grammar before matriculating to the University of Leeds where she studied sports science. She followed this with a Postgraduate Certificate in Education to qualify as a secondary school teacher. She took up a position at Ashby School as a PE teacher, but left her position in 2015 to focus on her athletics training. Hockey career Sugar took up field hockey while attending Newport Free Grammar, starting at the age of 12. She played as a youth for Saffron Walden, Cambridgeshire and was selected for trials for the East of England squad. This brought her to the attention of Hockey Wales who successfully recruited her to the Welsh youth squad due to her father's Welsh roots. She first played for Wales at the age of 17, and progressed through the age groups until she reached the senior levels, captaining the Wales under-20s which Sugar described as \\"one of my proudest moments through hockey\\". Athletics career During her hockey training the team's physio commented on Sugar's ankle impairment, stating that she should try out a Paralympic sport as she would be able to gain a classification. While watching the 2012 Summer Paralympics she noticed that the British discus thrower, Dan Greaves appeared to have \\"the same leg\\", and Sugar decided to explore her physio's advice. She attended a Paralympic sport's festival in Surrey and after considering cycling and athletics she decided to follow the latter. In February 2013 she had her first athletics trial and was informed that she would be flown out to Dubai in four weeks to be classified before competing at the Fazaa International, an IPC Grand Prix event. At the Grand Prix she ran in the 100m and 200m sprints, winning a silver and gold medal. Now a T44 classification athlete, Sugar had to decide on whether to continue her hockey career or switch to track and field. She chose athletics and spent the next ten months committing all her time outside of her teaching to her new training regime. Sugar's first major international competition came in July 2013 when she was selected as part of the Great Britain team to compete at the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships in Lyon. In the Women's 100m (T44) she came through the heats to finish fifth in the finals. In the 200m she finished fourth, just outside a podium finish. The following year she won her first international medals, collecting two bronze medals at the 2014 IPC Athletics European Championships in Swansea, in the 100m and 200m sprints. During 2014 and 2015 Sugar also entered long jump events. Her most notable result being at the European Championships in Swansea where she came fourth with a distance of 4.27 metres. In the build-up to the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, Sugar travelled to Doha to compete at her second World Championships. She was selected by the Great Britain management to co-captain the team, along with middle-distance runner Paul Blake. Sugar only competed in the 100 metres event, and her time of 14.86, way outside her personal best, was not enough to get her through the heats. The following year brought a return to success with two medals at the 2016 IPC Athletics European Championships in Grosseto. She won a bronze in the 200m and a silver in the 200m, just a tenth of a second behind the winner Irmgard Bensusan of Germany. In July Sugar was confirmed as a member of the Great Britain team to compete at the Rio Paralympics.

Opened in 1951 in South Minneapolis on Chicago Avenue between East 22nd Street and 24th Street, the hospital eventually merged with Metropolitan Medical Center to become Metropolitan-Mt. Sinai before dissolving in 1991.  Early history  After World War II, the idea for a Jewish hospital began circulating as Jewish community members expressed the desire for a hospital in the Twin Cities that would admit minorities on its staff. Surveys conducted in 1945 and 1947 showed that Jewish doctors faced discrimination and were routinely excluded from medical school faculties and private hospital staffs. Dr. Moses Barron, along with other Jewish community leaders including philanthropist Jay Phillips, began fundraising for the hospital in 1945. By 1946 the hospital site was chosen in South Minneapolis and architects Liebenberg and Kaplan were hired. By 1947, more than $1.75 million dollars had been raised. On February 19, 1951, Mount Sinai Hospital finally opened its doors under Chief of Staff Dr. Moses Barron. The seven-story, 197 bed facility was the most modern hospital in the community at the time. Its creation served two purposes: Jewish physicians who had been denied admitting privileges at other city hospitals could now practice medicine, and the founders garnered enormous civic prestige. It was the first private non-sectarian hospital in the community to accept members of minority races on its medical staff. After time, the University of Minnesota Medical School and the Minneapolis General Hospital came to Mount Sinai for instruction, and Mount Sinai established a formal residency teaching program, becoming only one of three privately supported medical institutions in the state of Minnesota to provide graduate level medical education. The Auxiliary group, which formed in 1950 and was composed mainly of women as a counter balance to the majority male staff, became instrumental in fundraising for the hospital with annual fundraisers, charity balls, and even staffing the hospital coffee shop. By 1987 the Auxiliary group had a membership of 2,200; over their 41-year history they helped to raise over one million dollars for the hospital.  Closing  In 1990, Mount Sinai Hospital merged with Metropolitan Medical Center to become Metropolitan-Mount Sinai. The hospital could not survive after the merger and in 1991 they closed their doors. The Hennepin County Medical Center, which was adjacent to the hospital, then expanded with the closure of Metropolitan-Mount Sinai. The Mount Sinai Auxiliary continued, transforming into the Mount Sinai Community Foundation, a group that still provides funds within the community to programs that support health and wellness in the Twin Cities.

Martin (November 21, 1885 ‚Äì June 16, 1958) was a renowned soil agronomist. He was a professor at Brigham Young University and became the Dean of the College of Applied Sciences. Early life and education Thomas \\"Tommy\\" Lysons Martin was born in Lancashire, England on November 21, 1885 to James and Mary Ann Martin. His family was very poor, and 4 of his older siblings had died of malnutrition. His father was a miner, while his mother worked in a factory. As a baby, Martin was left with a wet nurse who, unknown to his parents, left him to sit in a maggot-filled, decomposing nursery chair for most of the day. Eventually his mother found maggots on Martin as well. When he was 2, his family moved to Wombwell, England. Due to poor living conditions, he was sick as a child and didn't walk until he was almost 6 years old. His parents joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1891. He studied in school, although he struggled, until 1898 when he dropped out in order to work in the coal mines. He was mechanically inclined and keen at fixing things and even opened his own business that allowed him to quit his job at the coal mine, although he always dreamed of becoming a teacher. Martin immigrated to the United States with a Mormon missionary in April 1902, moving to Provo, Utah. He would go on to obtain citizenship in 1922. He worked at a dairy for three years in Provo. His family later followed in 1904, and Martin moved to live with them in American Fork, Utah where his dad opened a jewelry shop. Martin graduated from high school in 1908 and attended Brigham Young University (BYU). While still in school, he married Hattie Paxman on June 7, 1911 in the Salt Lake Temple. While at BYU, Martin was involved in debate and was a member of Tau Kappa Alpha, BYU's first national honor fraternity. He also participated in several operas, although he did not receive leading roles due to his short height. Martin graduated as the valedictorian from BYU the following year. After graduating, Martin became a principal at the Big Horn Academy. After three years at the Academy, Martin entered Cornell University in 1915 to obtain his doctorate degree. He studied soil technology, plant physiology and bacteriology, and was even an assistant in the soil technology department. After one year, Martin was out of money and took a job as a principal at Emery Academy in Castledale, Utah, returning to Cornell the following year. He graduated in 1919 with a PhD in soils. Cornell offered him a position there, but required him to sign a document that stated he was not a Mormon. Martin declined, and went on to become a renowned soil agronomist. Career After obtaining his PhD, Martin got a job as a teacher at Millard Academy in Hinckley, Utah. Shortly after moving to Millard County, he was also hired as the soil man for the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company. He was offered a job at the University of South Carolina, but followed Spencer W. Kimball's counsel not to take it. The following week, he was offered a job position at BYU. Martin was hired at Brigham Young University by school president Franklin S. Harris in 1921. Martin became a member of the Agricultural Department and was part of BYU's faculty for 37 years. He began teaching with only 3 agronomy students, but within 4 years had 12 students graduating. In 1927 Martin became the president of Utah Academy of Sciences, and also created classes in bacteriology. This one class later expanded into a full master's program under Martin's direction. While teaching at the university, he was responsible for creating classes in landscape architecture in 1936. He became the dean of the College of Applied Sciences in 1935. Martin was known for encouraging students to further their education and for helping them find jobs after graduation. He helped place students at other universities for graduate school. Martin even helped place Ezra Taft Benson at Iowa State University in 1927. By the time of his death, he had helped 178 students into graduate school. Martin wrote the book Decomposition of Green Manures at Different Stages of Growth. He was also a featured speaker at many agronomy conventions throughout his career. Martin was a member of the Provo Chamber of Commerce Agriculture Committee as well as the Health and Sanitation Committee. Awards and recognition Martin was awarded the BYU Distinguished Services Award in 1940. In 1950, Martin was one of the most successful teachers of agriculture as noted by the American Society of Agronomy. He was also awarded the Karl G. Maeser Distinguished Teaching Award from BYU in 1958. The university dedicated the Thomas L. Martin Building after him, which is now known as the \\"MARB.\\" Martin was also featured in American Men of Science and Who's Who in American Education. Personal life His wife Hattie died in 1950, and Martin left teaching to go on an eight-week trip to Hawaii due to his grief; however, he returned after only three weeks. In 1952, Martin later married Irma Patch. He died in Provo. on June 16, 1958. References External links *Photograph of the Thomas L. Martin and John A.

It was written by series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and William Bridges, and premiered on Netflix on 21 October 2016, together with the rest of series three. The episode tells the story of a teenage boy (Alex Lawther) who is blackmailed into committing bizarre and criminal acts by a mysterious hacker possessing a video of him masturbating. The boy is joined by a middle-aged man (Jerome Flynn), whom the same hacker is blackmailing over infidelity. The episode is similar to previous Black Mirror episodes, particularly \\"White Bear\\", and is dark in tone. \\"Shut Up and Dance\\" received mixed reviews. Critics praised Lawther and Flynn's acting, but were polarised as to whether the episode's tone was effective, whether the plot twist was good and whether the episode had interesting themes. It was ranked poorly in critics' lists of Black Mirror instalments by quality. Plot Kenny (Alex Lawther) returns home from his restaurant job to find that his younger sister Lindsay (Maya Gerber) has unintentionally infected his laptop with malware. Kenny downloads an anti- malware trojan which allows an unseen hacker to record him masturbating through his laptop's camera. The hacker emails Kenny, threatening to send the video to his contacts unless he follows a series of instructions. The next day at work, Kenny receives a text summoning him to a location 15 miles away in 45 minutes; he feigns illness to his boss (Hannah Steele) and frantically cycles to the coordinates. He is met by a man (Ivanno Jeremiah) acting on instructions from the hacker, who gives Kenny a box with a cake inside. Kenny is instructed to deliver the cake to a hotel room, where he finds Hector (Jerome Flynn). Hector receives blackmail messages of his own; he was about to commit adultery with a prostitute, and fears he will lose custody of his children if his wife finds out. Kenny and Hector are instructed to drive to a set of coordinates. At a stop for petrol they meet Karen (Natasha Little), a friend of Hector's wife, who asks for a lift home. Hector drives recklessly to get her there before continuing to their destination. They are told to use a gun concealed in the cake to rob a bank. Hector insists on being the driver, leaving Kenny to perform the robbery. Though Kenny urinates out of fear, he manages to get a bag of cash and flee the scene with Hector. Hector is instructed to destroy the car, while Kenny carries the money to a drop-off point in a nearby wood. There he meets another blackmail victim (Paul Bazely), who explains they are to fight to the death whilst being filmed through a camera-equipped drone; the money goes to the winner. When Kenny protests that he merely looked at pictures, the man asks how young the subjects were. Kenny attempts to shoot himself, but finds the gun is empty. The two begin to fight. Hector returns home, but finds the hacker has sent his wife (Leanne Best) evidence of his infidelity. The other blackmail victims' information has also been released. They each receive a trollface image from the blackmailer. Having won the fight, an injured Kenny staggers from the woodland. He receives a distraught call from his mother (Camilla Power), as Lindsay saw the video of him masturbating to child pornography. He ends the call as the police arrive. Production Whilst series one and two of Black Mirror were shown on Channel 4 in the UK, in September 2015 Netflix commissioned the series for 12 episodes (split into two series of six episodes). In March 2016, Netflix outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distributing the third series, with a bid of $40 million. Due to its move to Netflix, the show had a larger budget than in previous series. \\"Shut Up and Dance\\" is the third episode of the third series; all six episodes in this series were released on Netflix simultaneously on 21 October 2016. As Black Mirror is an anthology series, each episode is standalone. The titles of the six episodes that make up series 3 were announced in July 2016, along with the release date. A trailer for series three, featuring an amalgamation of clips and sound bites from the six episodes, was released by Netflix on 7 October 2016. Two days prior to the release of series 3 on Netflix, Den of Geek! published an interview in which Brooker hinted that the episode is \\"a grimy, contemporary nightmare\\" set in London, with no science fiction elements. Conception and writing The episode was co-written by series creator Charlie Brooker and William Bridges, who was new to the television industry. Bridges pitched three ideas to Brooker and executive producer Annabel Jones and although none of them were developed further, he was sent a draft script of \\"Shut Up and Dance\\" to work on. Brooker stated that the absence of science fiction elements from the episode was a \\"very conscious\\" decision, noting that science fiction is also absent from series one episode \\"The National Anthem\\" and series two episode \\"The Waldo Moment\\". Having recently written series three episode \\"San Junipero\\", which was conceived of as a 1980s period piece, Brooker was interested in writing a present-day story. He commented that the \\"weird, British, colloquial nasty humour\\" and \\"seediness\\" of the episode is similar to \\"The National Anthem\\". The story went through many different iterations, starting from an idea similar to 1992 heist film Reservoir Dogs, where a group of strangers were tossed together to commit a robbery. Some drafts did not involve Kenny looking at child pornography. In one version of the story, there was no reason why the events were happening, and in another the roles were reversed, with Hector having the extremely dark secret. In a different draft, the hackers were shown in an internet cafe in Eastern Europe, having blackmailed the characters for fun. The episode was originally set in the United States, as this would make it easier for the characters to access a gun, and the timeframe of the storyline was initially longer. Filming James Watkins directed the episode. The episode was filmed over a three week period; it was the second in the series to be filmed, after \\"San Junipero\\". Director James Watkins had previously directed horror films Eden Lake (2008) and The Woman in Black (2012), which Lawther says made Watkins \\"really [learn] the craft of sustaining incredible suspense over long periods of time.\\" It was Watkins' first experience directing television. Having seen art department preparations for series three episodes \\"Nosedive\\" and \\"San Junipero\\", Watkins aimed to deviate from their tones to \\"embrace being the ugly cousin\\". Alex Lawther plays the main character Kenny; having been a fan of the programme prior to auditioning, Lawther particularly liked series two episode \\"White Bear\\". When first auditioning, Lawther had only seen the script for a couple of scenes and was unaware of the twist ending. Lawther's first proper meeting with co-star Jerome Flynn was during shooting of in the in-car scenes. Filming was intense, with Flynn hyperventilating at times, though there was also corpsing (breaking into laughter) from Flynn, Lawther and Natasha Little, who played Hector's wife's friend Karen. Lawther played Kenny as if he was innocent, as his character is very repressed about his sexual proclivities. He also believed that Kenny feels constantly uncomfortable. Kenny handing a toy back to the girl who had left it behind in the cafe was intended as a hint to Kenny being a paedophile; there were discussions over how the scene should be acted to avoid giving away the twist. After struggling to find a parent who was happy to have their daughter act as the girl, Jones had her own daughter play the role. Lawther commented that whilst filming, he saw a news story similar to the episode's storyline, which he found surreal. The ending features Radiohead's \\"Exit Music (For a Film)\\", initially included as a temporary track during editing. The producers received permission from Radiohead to use the song as they liked Black Mirror. Analysis The episode was found to be the most similar to prior Black Mirror episodes out of those in the third series. Pat Stacey of the Irish Independent noted that it is the only episode of the series set entirely in England, whilst Alex Mullane of Digital Spy compared it to a \\"British version\\" of 1995 action film Die Hard with a Vengeance, as the main character \\"is led on a not-so-merry chase around the city\\". Sean Fitz- Gerald of Thrillist wrote that it is a \\"dark thriller\\" which is both \\"a very atypical and very classic Black Mirror story\\". The episode's tone was seen by Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph as the \\"most nihilistic\\" Black Mirror episode to that point; he commented that its \\"vision of humanity\\" is \\"uncompromisingly negative\\" and that it leaves an \\"acrid aftertaste\\". Sophie Gilbert of The Atlantic compared the episode to previous episodes with contemporary settings‚Äîseries one's \\"The National Anthem\\" and series two's \\"White Bear\\" and \\"The Waldo Moment\\". She also compared it to the 2001 special episode \\"Paedogeddon!\\" of the television news satire Brass Eye, which Brooker co-wrote. \\"Paedogeddon!\\" aimed to \\"lampoon the kind of moral panic and mob fury that's unleashed whenever the subject of child abuse is up for debate\\". Fitz-Gerald, Gilbert and Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club commented that the episode's themes resemble those in \\"White Bear\\". Handlen wrote that the audience must question \\"the danger of unsupervised vigilantism even when the victims arguably deserve what's coming to them\\", calling Kenny a \\"still sympathetic\\" character \\"not deserving\\" of his punishment, though he is \\"disturbed and troubled and in need of some serious counseling\\". Fitz-Gerald believed that all of the characters are \\"depraved [...] to a degree\\", noting that the internet brings out bad behaviour in people. Handlen called the episode \\"one of the most pervasive nightmares of the modern age\\", as it asks: \\"What if someone's watching you at your most vulnerable?\\" Mullane opined that the episode is \\"a cautionary tale about placing yourself in precarious positions online, particularly when it comes to sexting, images, and pornography\\". Fitz-Gerald summarised that the episode was a \\"hypothetical extreme\\" of hacking and trolling, and asked whether human nature and advanced technology are compatible. However, Caroline Framke of Vox believed that although the episode \\"might ostensibly be about the dangers of hacking, or trying to live a double life in a world that makes secrets all too easy to access\\", it relies on the feeling of shame. The episode asks: \\"How far would you go to keep your shame safely hidden?\\" Josh Dzieza of The Verge commented that the anonymous hackers mark \\"a bit of a departure\\" for the programme, which usually does not feature \\"overt villains\\". Mullane analysed that the hackers' identities do not need to be revealed as they are \\"effectively a stand-in for The Internet: all-seeing, all-knowing, and extremely dangerous\\". The supposed malware remover that Kenny downloads is called \\"shrive\\", a word from Middle English meaning \\"to prescribe penance\\" (the same root word is used for Shrove Tuesday). Gilbert commented that in light of this, \\"the gauntlet Kenny, Hector, and others are forced to run throughout the episode seems to be a kind of punishment for their sins, but at the end, none of them are forgiven\\". Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode received a rating of 64%, based on 22 reviews, indicating positive reception. \\"Shut Up and Dance\\" received ratings of five out of five stars by Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph, four out of five stars by Pat Stacey of The Irish Independent and a B class rating by Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club. The episode's themes received mixed reception. Mullane wrote that the story was no deeper than one where \\"bad people do bad things and then get punished for it\\". Gilbert called it redundant to series two episode \\"White Bear\\", saying that there was \\"no clear message or moment of redemption to take away from it\\". However, Handlen approved of the episode's themes, praising its \\"willingness to force moral questions that make everyone feel awful\\". Alex Lawther's performance as Kenny was universally well-received. Described by Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter as \\"one of the best things of 2016\\", Handlen concurred that Lawther is \\"the real stand-out\\" of the episode, while Mullane wrote that he is \\"superb in the main role\\". Dzieza praised Lawther's portrayal of \\"adolescent desperation\\", whilst Framke commented that his depiction of Kenny was \\"quivering, desperate, heartbreaking\\". Framke stated that Lawther's \\"incredible, vulnerable performance\\" made her \\"sympathise with his terror\\", which she found crucial to the twist. Jerome Flynn plays Hector; Alex Mullane of Digital Spy praised that his character is \\"suitably sleazy, without ever being a caricature\\". Jerome Flynn's acting of Hector was also praised. Mullane wrote that his character is \\"suitably sleazy, without ever being a caricature\\", whilst Framke praised his \\"coiled anger\\", describing the character as \\"gruff and to the point\\" and \\"furious at his total helplessness\\". Dzieza praised Flynn's \\"unsettling\\" contrast between \\"gruffness and utilitarian friendliness\\". Collin opined that \\"the deliciously horrible details of Flynn‚Äôs performance sell you on his character's predicament in a snap\\". However, Handlen commented that though Flynn \\"does a fine job\\", the episode is not a \\"showcase\\" for him. Critics were polarised as to whether the tone of the episode was effective. Whilst Matt Fowler of IGN wrote that it was \\"remarkably heart-pounding\\" and Stacey found it \\"fantastically tense\\", Gilbert commented that it \\"felt like too much of an endurance test\\" and Framke believed that there was not much suspense prior to the twist ending. Fitz- Gerald experienced a \\"mounting sense of anxiety\\" as \\"Kenny's hopelessness as a puppet to anonymous sociopaths is palpable\\", but Adam Chitwood of Collider found the tension too frustrating, and Handlen wrote that the episode is \\"never boring, but it's not all that engaging, either\\". Gilbert found it more upsetting than any prior episode, and Dzieza commented that the episode's aesthetics are \\"chilly and claustrophobic\\". Dzieza further said that the \\"queasiness\\" up to the twist is \\"well orchestrated\\", but found the ending \\"a letdown\\". Stacey said that the episode was \\"blackly funny\\", with Gilbert concurring that the scenes involving Hector's wife's friend Karen contained some of the darkest humour of the show. The twist ending in which Kenny is revealed to be a paedophile received a mixed reaction from critics. Handlen opined that it is \\"not quite powerful enough to make up for everything that came before it\\", with Framke agreeing that it \\"doesn't hit that hard\\". Fitz- Gerald said that \\"I half hate it, half love it.\\" Mullane called it \\"a huge gut-punch\\", but criticised that \\"it also removes any anchor for investment in any of these characters\\". Dzieza commented that it demonstrated that \\"the episode is more interested in turning gadgets into weapons of maximum humiliation than in saying anything more interesting about how digital humiliation works\\". However, Mullane opined that the episode's ending \\"perfectly captures the bleak mood of the piece and the inescapable claustrophobia of these people's situations\\". Director James Watkins was praised by Mullane and Collin for creating tension, with Collin writing that Watkins \\"keeps his camera on its feet and hungry\\" during moments of tension and Kenny's chase sequences. However, the episode was criticised as too long by Framke and Chitwood, with Framke attributing this to the programme's move to Netflix.

His early genre works show the obvious influence of Goya, but his later Orientalist works owe more to Delacroix. Biography His family moved to Madrid when he was still a child. As soon as he was old enough, he began working with the engraver, .Biographical notes @ MCN Biograf√≠as. Soon, he was making contributions to the Semanario Pintoresco Espa√±ol and El Siglo Pintoresco.Brief biography @ the Museo del Prado. In 1841, he entered the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, where he studied with Jos√© de Madrazo, met his son, Luis and, through him, became friends of the entire Madrazo family. Two years later, prompted by a need to support his family and possibly inspired by the love for ships he felt while growing up in a major port, he joined the Spanish Navy as an administrative official. Assault of the Moors Although this prevented him from pursuing his artistic career, he continued to do work in his spare time; completing 125 drawings for Escenas Andaluzas by Seraf√≠n Est√©banez Calder√≥n (published in 1847). During this period, he may have had an affair that produced two children, but he never married. From 1854 to 1859, he was in the Philippines, where he managed the commissary and, later, the entire post. The humid climate proved to be unhealthy for him, however and, after a brief illness, he developed rheumatism. He returned to Spain in 1860 to seek treatment, but saw little improvement. A year later, with a doctor's recommendation, he retired from the service and devoted himself entirely to his art. In 1863, he accompanied Mari√† Fortuny (whom he had met through the Madrazos) on a trip to Morocco, where he visited Tangier and Tetuan. The country was still in some disarray from the recent Hispano-Moroccan War. This served as the inspiration for his best-known work, \\"Assault of the Moors\\", depicting an 18th-century raid on the Jewish quarter of Tetuan. Upon returning to Madrid, he set up a studio and began to create paintings from the sketches he had made. For reasons that are unclear, he resisted the idea of participating in exhibitions. In 1871, after his father died of a sudden \\"mental illness\\", he turned to painting portraits, beginning with one of his mother. From 1872 to 1873 he visited Egypt and Palestine. While in Egypt, he acquired several antiquities, which he sold to the National Archaeological Museum of Spain, thus relieving him of some financial burdens. He continued to live in Madrid, but made frequent trips to Paris; partly due to the political instability in Spain that resulted in the Third Carlist War. Under the constant stress, his \\"rheumatism\\" revealed itself as tuberculosis and his health declined rapidly. His mother died early in 1877. Exhausted by the funeral and the mourning, he died five months later.

Written by series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and directed by James Hawes, it premiered on Netflix on 21 October 2016, along with the rest of series three. It is the longest episode in the series at 89 minutes. The episode is a murder mystery, and follows Detective Karin Parke (Kelly Macdonald) and her new partner Blue Coulson (Faye Marsay) who, together with the help of National Crime Agency officer Shaun Li (Benedict Wong), try to solve the inexplicable deaths of people who were all the target of social media. The episode was inspired by the Nordic noir genre, and it received critical acclaim. Plot Detective Chief Inspector Karin Parke (Kelly Macdonald) has been summoned to a hearing. She begins speaking about Jo Powers (Elizabeth Berrington), a journalist subjected to online death threats after publicly lambasting a disability rights activist's recent self-immolation. Powers is later found dead, and her husband injured. Parke investigates the death, with Trainee Detective Constable Blue Coulson (Faye Marsay) as her shadow, and Nick Shelton (Joe Armstrong) also working on the case. The death is assumed to be murder by her husband, but he claims that Powers cut her own throat with a wine bottle, injuring him as he tried to stop her. The following day, a rapper named Tusk (Charles Babalola), who had also become a target of online hate for insulting a young fan, has a seizure; he is hospitalised and sedated. When Tusk is put in an MRI machine, a metal object in his brain is pulled out of his head by magnetism, killing him instantly. The object is identified as an Autonomous Drone Insect, or \\"ADI\\" ‚Äì artificial substitute bees developed by a company called Granular to counteract colony collapse disorder in the bee population. Parke and Coulson visit Granular's headquarters, where project leader Rasmus Sjoberg (Jonas Karlsson) finds that an ADI was locally hacked near Powers' house on the night she was killed. A National Crime Agency (NCA) officer, Shaun Li (Benedict Wong), is also assigned to the case. Coulson realises that Tusk and Powers were both targeted with a social media hashtag, \\"#DeathTo\\". The tweets originating the hashtag had a video called \\"Game of Consequences\\" attached which explains that each day, the person that is subject of the most \\"#DeathTo\\" tweets will be killed. Clara Meades (Holli Dempsey), who posted a photo in which she pretended to urinate on a war memorial, is currently mentioned in the most tweets; the team takes her to a safe house. A swarm of ADIs invade the safe house through keyholes, windows and other small gaps. Though Parke and Blue attempt to hide from them with Meades, she is killed by ADIs entering through an air duct. Noticing that the ADIs attacked Meades but not herself or Parke, Coulson realises that they use a facial recognition system; Li admits that the ADIs are used for government surveillance. The news begins to report on the #DeathTo hashtag, which is rapidly growing in use. Meanwhile, Parke interviews Tess Wallander (Georgina Rich), a former Granular employee who attempted suicide after receiving online hate, but was saved by her flatmate and colleague Garrett Scholes (Duncan Pow). Coulson and Li's analysis of the compromised ADIs reveal Scholes' manifesto, which advocates forcing people to face consequences without hiding behind online anonymity. Coulson traces the location where a selfie in the document was taken; the police raid this location, yielding a disk drive. As Rasmus is preparing to use the drive's data to deactivate the ADI system, Coulson discovers the drive contains a list of hundreds of thousands of IMEI numbers, which can be connected to the owners' details via the government's monitoring system. They realise the list is of those who tipped the #DeathTo hashtag, and Parke concludes that Scholes' true plan was to use the first victims as a bait, whereas the final targets are the users. However, Li ignores this and deactivates the system, but the ADIs come back online and are seen targeting Shelton, who had used the hashtag. Most or all of the 387,036 people on the list are killed by the ADIs. At the hearing, Parke explains that Coulson has gone missing, presumed to have died by suicide; however, Parke later receives a text from her reading \\"Got him\\". She smiles and deletes the text. Scholes had fled abroad and changed his appearance, but Coulson has managed to locate him. The episode ends with Coulson following Scholes down an alley in an unnamed foreign country. Production The episode was written by series creator Charlie Brooker and first conceived of as an idea where people voted for an individual to be killed by a robot. This idea was later developed into the episodes \\"Hated in the Nation\\" and series four episode \\"Metalhead\\". \\"Hated in the Nation\\" took inspiration from Scandinavian noir thriller television series such as The Killing. It was also informed by Jon Ronson's book So You've Been Publicly Shamed (2015), about online shaming and its historical antecedents and by Brooker's experience of a public backlash after mentioning Lee Harvey Oswald and John Hinckley Jr in a satirical 2004 article about George W. Bush in The Guardian. Brooker found the episode difficult to write; he had previously written a spoof police procedural television series A Touch of Cloth but had not written serious works in the genre. After writing half of the script, the episode was put to one side and Brooker began working on other series three episodes. When he came back to the script, he decided to introduce the framing device of the courtroom to speed up exposition. Garrett Scholes was written to be mysterious, his character being inspired by terrorists Ted Kaczynski‚Äînicknamed the Unabomber‚Äîand Anders Behring Breivik. When asked whether \\"policing Twitter is the answer\\" to the issues in the episode, Brooker answers \\"I don't know the answer!\\", \\"I think that social media is an amazing invention and really I suspect what needs to happen is that we just as a species get better at dealing with it\\" and \\"People should be more accountable for what they say. It's just difficult to see how you do that without the law getting involved\\". James Hawes directed the episode. He focused on pacing the escalation as the scope of the storyline changed from local to global, also choosing a limited colour palette to match the episode's genre. \\"Hated in the Nation\\" is set in a near-future London and the filming in London encompassed 32 locations, taking place over 23 days. The headquarters of Granular was shot on five locations. Faye Marsay played Blue Coulson, having auditioned for a part in series three episode \\"Men Against Fire\\". Kelly Macdonald starred as DCI Karin Parke. The episode's climax takes place in the safe house and was filmed over three days. The ending was filmed in Gran Canaria, as production time was too limited to shoot in the tropics. It originally featured a shot of Blue putting a knife in her bag. Work on the graphics and social media interfaces of the episode was extensive, as this was key to the narrative. The company Painting Practice worked on the design of the robotic bees, which needed to be recognisable as bees but also have a creepy aspect to them. At 89 minutes in length, \\"Hated in the Nation\\" is the longest episode of Black Mirror. Splitting the episode into two parts was considered but as the programme is an anthology series and series three would be the first to premiere on Netflix, it was kept as one episode. Allusions to earlier episodes In the opening flashback sequence, Karin Parke sits down in her living room to watch the news. Scrolling below the feature about the chancellor, the news ticker reads: \\"US military announces MASS project\\". This is in reference to the previous episode \\"Men Against Fire\\", which featured the MASS technology. Later on, another news ticker displays \\"ECHR rules 'cookies' have human rights\\" which is a reference to the technology seen in the \\"White Christmas\\" episode. When DCI Parke asks Blue Coulson why she left forensics, she reveals that she was the one who cracked Iain Rannoch's \\"souvenir folder\\", containing all the footage filmed by his girlfriend Victoria Skillane of the torture and murder of six-year-old Jemima Sykes. The series 2 episode \\"White Bear\\" covers Victoria's punishment. In the ending scenes, when Garrett Scholes is watching the news, the headline ticker includes \\"Shou Saito announces immersive new gaming system.\\" This is a reference to the previous episode \\"Playtest\\". Also included is \\"Skillane appeal thrown out of court\\", another reference to \\"White Bear\\". Critical reception The episode was acclaimed by critics, who praised its writing, use of Twitter, themes, acting, and final twist. Suchandrika Chakrabarti of the Daily Mirror extolled the episode, awarding it a perfect 5 rating and calling it \\"a huge achievement\\", stating \\"it's an illuminating, compelling watch, as Black Mirror does what it does best: telling us about human nature through the technology we wish for, but don't deserve\\". Digital Spy also gave a very enthusiastic review, considering the episode \\"a great example of how the show at its best can merge its heady high-concepts with more traditional storytelling to effectively hold that black mirror up to our own society\\". They highly praised the \\"at once downbeat and low-key, and yet expansively devastating\\" climax, and called the episode \\"a feature length story that's captivating throughout\\". Adam Chitwood of Collider noted that the episode was the \\"most thematically relevant... of this new batch, with a direct connection to the ugly side of social media and its lack of consequences.\\" The Telegraph called the episode \\"an inspired, frost-fringed police procedural\\" and gave it a rating of four out of five. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, stating \\"Black Mirror ends its season with a solid but unremarkable thriller\\". He criticized the length of the episode, despite recognizing that \\"at least the story has enough complications that it never felt empty.\\" See also *Assassination market *Cancel culture *Unmanned aerial vehicle *Prey (2002), a book by Michael Crichton with a similar premise *Untraceable (2008), a film directed by Gregory Hoblit where victims are similarly murdered based on online voting results *\\"No. 6\\" (2003), an anime with a similar concept of government-controlled parasitic wasps References External links * 2016 British television episodes Black Mirror episodes Television episodes about murder Television episodes about social media Television episodes about mass surveillance Television episodes about robots Television episodes written by Charlie Brooker Netflix original television series episodes ","title":"Hated in the Nation"},{"id":"51180967","text":"\\"Playtest\\" is the second episode in the third series of the British science fiction anthology series Black Mirror. Written by series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and directed by Dan Trachtenberg, it premiered on Netflix on 21 October 2016, together with the rest of series three. The episode tells the story of Cooper (Wyatt Russell), an American stuck in London during his travels around the world, who accepts a one-time job offer from a video game company, SaitoGemu, to be able to afford his return to America. Hannah John-Kamen co-stars as a journalist Cooper meets in London. Plot Cooper (Wyatt Russell) is travelling the world following his father's death from early-onset Alzheimer's. While in London, Cooper spends a night with tech journalist Sonja (Hannah John-Kamen). The next day he discovers that his identity has been stolen and the money for his return trip has been misappropriated. He spots a local job opening with video game company SaitoGemu, known for their survival horror games. Cooper gets the job; Sonja urges him to take a photograph of the company's games technology. Cooper meets Katie (Wunmi Mosaku) at SaitoGemu's building, where he is directed to a white room to test a new technology. Katie instructs Cooper to turn his phone off for security reasons, but he switches it back on while she is away in order to send Sonja a picture of the technology. Katie implants a miniature computer called a \\"mushroom\\" into the back of his neck. The initialization process is interrupted by a call from Cooper's mother, which Katie cancels. Cooper proceeds to play a game of Whac-a-Mole, his senses altered by the mushroom's augmented reality technology. He meets the company's owner, Shou (Ken Yamamura), who talks Cooper into a second test, in which the mushroom implant will probe his brain to develop a personalised horror experience. Katie leaves Cooper at a mansion, the Harlech House, with only an earpiece to communicate with her. He explores the mansion and endures some minor jumpscare events. Sonja unexpectedly appears at the mansion, then becomes violent and stabs Cooper. He fights back and kills her, whereupon her body, the knife and his wound disappear. He demands that Katie abort the test. She begins interrogating Cooper with basic questions, and he realizes that he is losing his memories. Cooper smashes a mirror and attempts to remove the mushroom with a shard of glass. Katie and Shou appear and restrain him, saying the technology cannot be shut off and will reduce him to a childlike state. When Cooper wakes up, he is back in Shou's office where they started the second experiment; according to Katie and Shou, only one second has passed since the test began. Shou apologizes for the pain he caused Cooper, and they remove the mushroom safely. Cooper leaves and uses his reclaimed funding to return home to his mother, but she does not recognize him and repeatedly dials his number on her phone. It is then revealed that Cooper has been in the white room from the first test all along; all events subsequent to him receiving the mushroom were simulated. When Cooper's phone rang during the upload, the signal interfered with the game and caused his death. Katie records that in his final moments, Cooper \\"CALLED 'MOM. Production \\"Playtest\\" was the last episode of the third series to be filmed. It was written by series creator Charlie Brooker and directed by Dan Trachtenberg. Conceptually, Brooker was inspired with an idea where a person is given augmented reality implants to play a virtual Whac-A-Mole game which became faster and never ended, causing the person to go crazy and be placed with numerous other subjects all traumatised by moles. However, this only proved to be enough material for a fifteen-minute episode. Brooker came up with adding in a haunted house concept, where the augmented reality technology would dynamically change what the person saw in response to their fears. The extra twist at the end of the episode was not in the original treatment, but Brooker decided to add it after conversations with Trachtenberg. He also admitted that the extra twist was partly inspired by Daniel Mallory Ortberg, who wrote in an article: \\"Next on Black Mirror: what if phones, but too much?\\". Trachtenberg also revealed that the casting of Wyatt Russell as Cooper led to the character's arrogance being toned down so that the audience is \\"rooting for him to learn a lesson\\". Some ideas for the episode were changed or unused. In one draft, Cooper was told he was a character in Black Mirror as a way of breaking the fourth wall. Brooker also wished to have a Nightmare Mode, where different scenes would be shown to the viewer when they watched the episode a second time. Cooper's relationship with his mother was changed, from her being neurotic and doting to Cooper taking her for granted. Initially, production would have taken place in Tokyo, a key hub for video game development, while filming the scenes in the house in the UK, but they found it difficult to explain in-story why such a house would exist in or near Japan. Instead, they decided to make the episode take place in London, a location they had ready access to but had not really featured in the series to that point. The sets for SaitoGemu was created from an abandoned school building, while shots within the Harlech House were shot from the home of a 91-year-old woman. Additional shots of the House for special effects were made by rendering the home within the Unity game engine. In the early Harlech House scenes, Russell was encouraged to experiment with Cooper's reactions; for instance, a 14-minute take of Cooper insulting Josh Peters, his childhood bully who appears as a hologram, was filmed. Trachtenberg wanted the penultimate scene, with Cooper returning to his home to find his mother thinking he is dead, as a one shot take, given the drastic change in tone it gave the episode. As subtle hints that most of the episode was taking place in a virtual space in Cooper's mind, many facets of the \\"real-world\\" scenes were incorporated as background elements within this to reflect how Cooper's memories had been used against him by the software, such as a poster for the film Red Sonja that appears in Sonja's apartment within the virtual space. Hannah John-Kamen appears in this episode as Sonja, after appearing briefly, in an unrelated role, in the series one episode \\"Fifteen Million Merits\\". In an interview in October 2016, Charlie Brooker revealed that they were initially going to have the song John-Kamen's character sang in \\"Fifteen Million Merits\\" playing on the radio in the background in the episode but were unable due to a licensing issue.  Cultural references  The episode contains a number of video game-related references, as both Brooker and Trachtenberg were former video game journalists before becoming names in the television and film industries. The video gaming magazine Edge helped Brooker to create a number of fictional covers of their magazine for the episode. Trachtenberg included several of his favorite video games as props on a shelf in Sonja's room. When Cooper is told to enter a room with the access point by Katie, she tells him \\"Would you kindly open the door?\\" The \\"would you kindly\\" is a phrase from BioShock, used by the antagonist to facilitate mind control of the player-character. According to Brooker, Trachtenberg insisted on including this reference within the episode. Cooper's last name is revealed to be Redfield, which Brooker used as a nod to the characters of Chris and Claire Redfield from the Resident Evil franchise. The episode also resembles the plot of the David Cronenberg's Existenz film. Critical reception Adam Chitwood of Collider described the episode as one of the major highlights of the season in a \\"genuinely terrifying video game-centric episode\\".

It depicts the speculative murder of Andreas Baader, one of the leaders of the terrorist organisation Red Army Faction, in the Stammheim Prison in 1977. The painting is in the collections of the Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art in Oslo. Description Andreas Baader is partially naked in his cell in the Stammheim Prison. Two men hold Baader while a third lies beaten on the floor before him. A fourth man in trenchcoat executes Baader with a gun shot to the back of the neck. The men are positioned in the shape of a St Andrew's Cross. The composition and chiaroscuro are inspired by Baroque art, with associations to Caravaggio's Crucifixion of St. Peter. Creation Baader had died on 18 October 1977 in what became known as the Stammheim \\"Death Night\\", when also Gudrun Ensslin and Jan-Carl Raspe died. In the official version they committed suicide, but rumours and theories spread quickly that they had been murdered by secret agents. Nerdrum was an anarchist at the time he made the painting. He later described his attraction to the Baader-Meinhof group: \\"What particularly fascinated me was the expression of the free man that I saw in them. Otherwise I had sympathy for Baader to the extent that he was one of the many who were ready to die for their cause. To me he was the uncompromising, tragic idealist.\\" Reception The painting was presented at H√∏stutstillingen in Oslo in 1978. It immediately drew strong reactions in both Norway and Germany for its way of depicting a terrorist as a religious martyr, as well as supposing he was murdered. The painting established Nerdrum as a political voice in the Norwegian public discourse.

Built in 1871-72, the school was for many years the primary school feeding the adjacent Black River Academy (on whose original site it stands). The building now serves as a local senior services center. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The former Ludlow Graded School building stands on the south side of High Street, a short way west of the Ludlow village green. It is set between the former Black River Academy building (now a local history museum), and the Ludlow Baptist Church, separated from the road by the parking lot it shares with the academy building. It is a roughly L-shaped 2-1/2 story wood-frame structure, with a gabled main section facing toward the street and a cross-gabled ell extending to the east. In the crook of the L is the building's most prominent feature, a three-story square tower topped by a truncated hip roof with railing above. The main entrance is in the front of this tower, sheltered by a porch with a complex combination of shed and gabled roofs and supported by square posts. The main facade has pilastered corners and a central three-part window topped by a gabled pediment; most of the other building windows are sash. with The school was built in 1871-72, originally with a 1-1/2 story ell. The ell was raised to its present size in 1903. The tower is a replacement of an original tower, which featured a Second Empire-style mansard roof with cresting. The school was built on the first site of the Black River Academy, which burned in 1844, and replaced a district school (located elsewhere) that was also destroyed by fire. This school served the local community until 1938, when a new school was opened on the village outskirts. In the late 1970s, the building was adapted for use as a social services center. It is owned by the Black River Historical Society, which also owns the academy building.

Its goods are all produced in the United States. History American Giant was founded in February 2012 by Bayard Winthrop, former head of Chrome Industries, to address what he saw as a lack of affordably priced high-quality American-made products. He believed that by selling direct to the customer, a business could save enough on distribution and marketing to sell at mainstream prices products manufactured in America. The company was named one of the 50 Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company in 2015 and cited for \\"breathing new life into U.S. apparel manufacturing\\". initially the company's products were all made at a factory in Brisbane, California. The company launched with one product, a hooded sweatshirt. After a viral video and favorable publicity (a review in Slate called it \\"the greatest hoodie ever made\\"), demand outstripped the factory's capacity, and unable to find other sites that satisfied his standards, Winthrop chose to let orders back up rather than compromise on quality. , the company was manufacturing its clothing in Los Angeles and in Middlesex, North Carolina. American Giant's main initial investor was former PepsiCo CEO and chairman Donald M. Kendall. Later investors included Emil Capital Partners, a venture capital firm. , the company had raised $5.6 million and had begun a round of financing with a target of $12 million. With Randy Komisar, Winthrop published I F*cking Love That Company (2014), a book about direct to consumer retail. Products American Giant launched with its Classic Full Zip hooded sweatshirt, which was created by Philipe Manoux, a former industrial engineer at Apple. Using cotton grown in North Carolina, it is constructed of a heavyweight, 12.4 oz fleece and features reinforced elbow pads, a double-lined hood, custom hardware, a side-panel for mobility, and spandex woven into the cuffs and waist to hold shape and elasticity. The product line was expanded to include other kinds of men's sweatshirts, tee- shirts, and sweatpants, and subsequently women's sportswear and jeans. In 2018, the company began selling yarn-dyed flannel shirts.

Early life Cannell was educated in Liverpool, with a scholarship to the selective private Merchant Taylors' School for Girls followed by BA from University of Liverpool in French with History subsidiary. She then gained a Postgraduate Diploma in Education and held teaching posts in the UK and France. Career During World War II she lectured to troops and this changed the direction of her career into higher education and the training of teachers. In 1960 she was appointed the deputy principal of the new Nottingham College of Education. In 1974, as acting principal, she led the formation of what became Nottingham Trent University, bringing together her college, Trent Polytechnic and other educational institutions in Nottingham. Research After her retirement in the 1970s, she again changed direction to become a respected historian of mathematics. Her major achievement was rediscovering the importance of George Green in the development of nineteenth century applied physics. He had initially worked as a miller near Nottingham and although his mathematical discoveries were known and used worldwide, very little was known about his life. Her major biography of him brought his work, life and legacy together for the first time, introducing him as an important influence in nineteenth century applied physics. In addition, Cannell and colleagues at Nottingham led restoration of his windmill and memory in time for his bicentenary in 1993.

Reviews A reviewer in The Argus was very impressed with the book: \\"Great novelist that she is Henry Handel Richardson has now written an historical romance which should make her name better known among the rank and file of readers Her famous Australian trilogy, The Fortunes of Richard Mahony swept her into the front rank of contemporary writers, but its appeal was not to the majority...The Young Cosima is a capital novel. With its magnificent portraits of nineteenth century personages, its dramatic accounts of the making of mighty music, its subtleties, its humour, and its tragedy, it carries the reader through some of the most stirring periods in the careers of its principals Miss Richardson has taken infinite pains to ensure the fidelity of her portraits\\"\\"Wagner and Cosima\\" by K.A., The Argus, 18 March 1939, p18 In a short review in The Sydney Morning Herald the reviewer points to the craft behind the work: \\"Gleaning facts from a number of sources, listed at the back of the book, Miss Richardson has built up a vivid and moving romantic novel. The period, circa 1850, so close to our own in time, is far enough removed in outlook and habit of thought to appear remote. This factor, though not stressed, is subtly used in order to present the characters as something more than life size. An unusual and often subtle interpretation of some of the facts lends freshness and emphasis to incidents and situations which have already become more or less historically stereotyped. The dialogue has, except in moments of passion and excitement, that slight stiffness appropriate to the nineteenth century.\\"\\"A Grand Passion\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 25 February 1939, p20  See also  * 1939 in Australian literature References 1939 Australian novels Novels by Henry Handel Richardson ","title":"The Young Cosima"},{"id":"51181718","text":"Downhauler is the fifth studio release by Rhode Island‚Äìbased singer-songwriter Marc Douglas Berardo.

The architecture of the building was similar to buildings of the Soviet period. Hospital tr—ëhluchevoy was designed in a star shape, with branchings at the ends. The three wings of the building came together in the middle, the side parts form three courtyards, with porches. Next to the main building was an annex housing the pathology department. Due to the unfinished construction in some places there were only fragments of walls and floors. The basements were also flooded. According to one story construction was halted due to a lack of funding. Another story states shortcomings of the project prevented it from being completed. According to an old map of Moscow in 1952, the hospital was to be built by the river Likhoborka and surrounding wetlands. Sewage treatment facilities were located nearby. The abandoned building was well known among fans of urban legends as one of the most mystical places in Moscow. Among urban explorers, the hospital became known as \\"The Umbrella\\"' for its shape. It was similar to both the Umbrella Corporation logo from the video game and film series Resident Evil and the biohazard symbol.  History  Construction of the hospital began in 1980 and was suspended in 1985. Since then, the building was unfinished and dilapidated until its demolition in 2018. The hospital was designed to have a capacity of 1300 beds. The building was built in the style of brutalism. Since the mid-1980s, the hospital was a frequent place for urban explorers to visit.

It massed at launch, had a power production capacity of 1300 W with a C band and L band payload. It was successfully launched along Ekspress AM4 aboard a Proton-M/Briz-M from Baikonur on February 2, 2009. It was commissioned in the 80¬∞East slot. The satellite failed on July 4, 2013, well short of its design life, for which RSCC collected the insurance. Satellite description Ekspress MD1 was a geostationary communications satellite developed by Khrunichev on the Yakhta platform. It is a small, three axis stabilized, platform designed for direct geostationary orbit and as such it lacked an apogee kick motor. It was designed to support a bigger, heavier satellite on top of it and serve as its rocket adapter. For its companion, Ekspress AM4, it was specially reinforced to carry the on top. The satellite weighted at launch, had a power production capacity of 1300 W with a design life of 10 years. Its payload was made by Thales Alenia Space and was composed of 8 √ó 40 MHz C band and 1 √ó 1 MHz L band transponders, for a total satellite bandwidth of 321 MHz for mass of . It was designed to provide mobile presidential and governmental communications, digital TV and Radio broadcasting services, Internet access, data transfer, video conferencing in Russia and Asia from the 80¬∞ East orbital slot. Ekspress MD1 was heavily based on the KazSat-1. While smaller than the other satellites of the Ekspress constellation, it enabled RSCC to have a second local supplier after its traditional contractor ISS Reshetnev. The structure was designed around a cylindrical structure that enabled stacking of another satellite on top of the Ekspress MD1 and acted as an adaptor to the Briz-M stage for both spacecraft. While successfully commissioned, it failed to reach even half of its design life. It had a twin satellite, Ekspress MD2 which failed to reach orbit. As of 2016, RSCC has not ordered any further satellite from Khrunichev, relying instead on foreign suppliers like Airbus Defence and Space. History Within the Russian Federal Space Program for 2006-2015, RSCC awarded on 2006 a contract for two satellites, Ekspress MD1 and Ekspress MD2 to Khrunichev. It also signed a separate contract with Alcatel Alenia Space for the supply of the payloads. The twin spacecraft would be based on the Yakhta platform and the lessons from the KazSat-1 satellite. On April 2007, RSCC Acting Director General Yuri Izmailov stated that Ekspress MD1 and Ekspress AM4 were the company to priority and would launch by December 2007. In an April 29, 2008 interview, Mr Izmailov stated that the Ekspress MD1 was expected to fly in 2008. On September 10, 2008, Khrunichev stated that the satellite production was in full swing. The solutions from the lessons learned from the anomalies of KazSat-1 and Monitor-E had been implemented. And the satellite had gone through electrical testing and was going into acceptance testing. On January 26, 2009, the assembly of the integration of the spacecraft with Ekspress AM4 and the Briz-M stage was started at the Baikonur launch site. On February 6, the Proton-M/Briz-M stack was certified for roll out to the Site 200/39 launch pad. On February 11, at 00:03 UTC, the rocket successfully launched both spacecraft directly to geostationary orbit. On May 12, Ekspress MD1 was successfully commissioned into service in the Ekspress constellation. On the same year, the satellite was used for the first distribution of the multiplex programs compulsory under the Federal Target Program Development of TV & Radio broadcasting in the Russian Federation for 2009 ‚Äì 2015. On failed on July 4, 2013 Ekspress MD1 failed on orbit. At just 4 years, 4 months, 23 days, it failed to achieve even half of its design life. In February 2014, RSCC was able to collect the 857 million rubles insurance payment on the failed satellite.

The dominant ethnic group, the Uyghur, are predominantly Muslim and very few are known to be Christian.  Pre-history  The Church of the East, commonly known as Nestorians, reached Central Asia, Mongolia and China by the 7th century CE. The Turfan texts dating to the 9th/10th centuries include translations of Christian sacred texts into several languages, including Christian Old Turkic. The tribe of the Keraites was known to be predominantly Christian from the 11th century and to the time of Genghis Khan. Likewise the Naiman and Ongud tribes were evangelised from the 11th century. The Uighur people were later Islamised.  History  In 1904, George W. Hunter with the China Inland Mission opened the first mission station for CIM in Xinjiang. But already in 1892, the Mission Covenant Church of Sweden started missions in the area around Kashgar, and later built mission stations, churches, hospitals and schools in Yarkant and Yengisar. In the 1930s there were several hundreds of Christians among this people, but because of persecution the churches were destroyed and the believers were scattered. The missionaries were forced to leave because of ethnic and factional battles during the Kumul Rebellion in the late 1930s. Christian missionaries, such as British missionary George W. Hunter, Johannes Avetaranian, and Swedish missionaries Magnus B√§cklund, Nils Fredrik H√∂ijer, Father Hendricks, Josef M√§ssrur, Anna M√§ssrur, Albert Andersson, Gustaf Ahlbert, Stina M√•rtensson, John T√∂rnquist, G√∂sta Raquette, Oskar Hermannson, and Uyghur convert Nur Luke studied the Uyghur language and wrote works on it. A Turkish convert to Christianity, Johannes Avetaranian went to China to spread Christianity to the Uyghurs. Yaqup Istipan,Yaqup Istipan fled to Sweden to escape persecution, sometimes using the Europeanised name \\"Jacob Stephen\\". He published an autobiography in 1947, ' (book details with photo of Yaqup) Wu'erkaixi, and Alimujiang Yimiti are other Uyghurs who converted to Christianity. There were several hundred Uyghur Muslims converted to Christianity by the Swedes. Imprisonment and execution were inflicted on Uyghur Christian converts and after refusing to give up his Christian religion, and the Uyghur convert Habil was executed in 1933. Ultimately in 1938, Sheng Shicai's pro Soviet regime banished the Swedish missionaries after the East Turkestan Republic tortured and jailed Christian converts, who were made out of Kirghiz and Uyghurs. The openly Islamic East Turkestan Republic forcibly ejected the Swedish missionaries and espoused hostility to Christianity while espousing a Muslim Turkic ideology. The East Turkestan Republic subjected former Muslim Christian converts like Joseph Johannes Khan to jail, torture and abuse after he refused to give up Christianity in favor of Islam. After the British intervened to free Khan he was forced to leave his land and in November 1933 he came to Peshawar. Work with women The Swedish missionaries observed the conditions of Uyghur Muslim women in Xinjiang during their stay there. The lack of Han Chinese women led to Uyghur Muslim women marrying Han Chinese men, These women were hated by their families and people. Unmarried Muslim Uyghur women who married non-Muslims like Chinese, Hindus, Armenians, Jews, and Russians if they could not find a Muslim husband while they were calling to Allah to grant them marriage by the shrines of saints. The Muslims also attacked the Swedish Christian mission and Hindus resident in the city. Lobbying by the Swedish Christian missionaries led to child marriage for under 15-year-old girls to be banned by the Chinese Governor in √úr√ºmqi. Uyghur women converts to Christianity did not wear the veil. Uyghur Muslims rioted against Indian Hindu traders when the Hindus attempted to practice their religious affairs in public and also rose up against the Swedish Christian mission in 1907.  Violence against missionaries  Mullahs directed violence against the missionaries from Sweden since 1894 and it was only due to action taken by Chinese officials that a Uyghur Muslim apostate who became a Christian named Omar was saved from execution at the hands of mullahs. In 1899, the headquarters of the Swedish missionaries was violently obliterated by a mass of rioters. This anti-Christian riot was incited by the landlord of the property who argued with his Swedish renters. The Swedish missionaries welfare was one of the concerns by the British during the Xinhai Revolution. The residences of the Swedish missionaries were attacked by mobs and violent outbreaks resulted in a garden becoming their home since nobody would rent to them. An anti-Christian mob broke out among the Muslims in Kashgar against the Swedish missionaries in 1923. Violence and tensions brewed by Muslims who were stirred by Muslim apostates becoming Christian due to the Swedes in Ramadan of 1923. Orders to stop rioting were given to the Muslim Qazis and merchants by the Chinese Tao Tai after British diplomats contacted him. The Bughras applied Shari'a while ejecting the Khotan-based Swedish missionaries. They demanded the withdrawal of the Swedish missionaries while enacting Shariah on March 16, 1933. In the name of Islam, the Uyghur leader Amir Abdullah Bughra of the First East Turkestan Republic violently physically assaulted the Yarkand-based Swedish missionaries and would have executed them, except they were only banished due to the British Aqsaqal's intercession in their favor. There were beheadings and executions of Muslims who had converted to Christianity at the hands of the Amir's followers.  Other governments  Werner Otto von Hentig during the Niedermayer‚ÄìHentig Expedition was assisted by a tip off from a Swedish missionary. Along with British diplomats, the Kashgar-based missionaries from Sweden were prominent among European expatriates in the area. Eleanor Holgate Lattimore met the Swedish missionaries and British diplomats in Kashgar. The Swedish Mission Society ran a printing operation. Life of East Turkestan was the state run media of the rebel First East Turkestan Republic in the Kumul Rebellion. The Bughra lead government used the Swedish Mission Press to print and distribute the media.  See also  * China Inland Mission * George W.

It is a low shrub with small leaves and heads of pink to magenta-coloured flowers in late spring and early summer. Description Verticordia stenopetala is a highly branched shrub which usually grows to a height and wide. The leaves are linear, slightly wider towards the tip, long and semi-circular in cross-section. The flowers are arranged in round or corymb-like groups, each flower on a stalk long. The floral cup is about long, smooth and hairy. The sepals are more or less spreading, long, pink to magenta-coloured with 6 to 8 feathery lobes. The petals are a similar colour to the sepals, about long, egg-shaped with a few short teeth near the tip and are slightly hairy on the outside. The style is long, curved and hairy near the tip. Flowering time is from October to January. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia stenopetala was first formally described by Ludwig Diels in 1904 and the description was published in Botanische Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie. The specific epithet (stenopetala) is from the Ancient Greek words stenos meaning \\"narrow\\" and petalon meaning \\"petal\\". In his review of the genus in 1991, Alex George placed this species in subgenus Verticordia, section Verticordia along with V. crebra, V. helichrysantha, V. plumosa, V. sieberi, V. harveyi, V. pityrhops, and V. fimbrilepis.George, A.S.

It occurs between Walgoolan, Bullabulling and Forrestania in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, and Mallee biogeographic regions. Conservation Verticordia stenopetala is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.

Currently it has official state level bodies in NSW, Victoria, South Australia, Northern Territory and Western Australia and supports the industry through professional development, special interest publications, and events. Formally, it is an incorporated association.  History  The Association started when a group of six librarians met to start an informal network, in 1969. It was initially known as the Australian Law Librarians Group. From then, through the 1970s and 1980s, the group gradually grew to cover most states in Australia. Over the first two decades of its existence, the association expanded more into a wide variety of areas of legal practice. The group changed its name from the Law Librarians Group to the Australian Law Librarians' Association in 2006. In 2013, after some years of negotiation and practice, the Association established centralised memberships, and with a stronger central role. This caused some states, Tasmania and Queensland, to drop out of the Association at the time.  Coverage  ALLA represents both librarians and associated information professionals. It covers those librarians working in the court system, as well as law firms, the academic sector, Universities and Government Departments.

Suomalaisia naiskohtaloita 1700 luvulta. Edita Publishing Oy, Helsinki, 2009 She was the head of a textile mill for years (1757-1766), where she became known for the high quality of the processing of flax she taught to students. Maria Elisabet √ñberg was born to a Swedish sergeant. She was educated in flax processing at Vadstena flaxen factory. When she finished her training in 1756, she was given a price for her accomplices in the profession in Stockholm, as it was Swedish policy at the time to encourage the textile industry and knowledge within the trade. The following year, she was employed as the head of the textile mill of Hans Henrik Boije in the province of Finland, which also functioned as a textile school with both male and female students. Her students were to become known for their ability and several of them were awarded in Stockholm for their achievements. In 1764 she married her colleague, the textile teacher Mikael Mengalin (1731-1794), with whom she had three daughters and a son. The couple left their position when the school was closed in 1766, but continued to teach. Maria Elisabet √ñberg was a respected educator in contemporary Sweden-Finland.
