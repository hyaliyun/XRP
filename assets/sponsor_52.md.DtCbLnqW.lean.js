His pseudonym was derived from the municipality Willmenrod in the Westerwald region, where he was born as Carl Clemens Hahn. Wilmenrod is considered the inventor of Toast Hawaii, \\"Arabian Horseman's Delight\\" (mincemeat with onions) and \\"stuffed strawberry\\" (strawberry stuffed with an almond). He is also credited with making Rumtopf popular in Southern and Western Germany, and with introducing turkey as a typical Christmas dinner. Wilmenrod was not a trained chef, but had studied as an actor and had an acting career before becoming the star of his television program. From February 20, 1953, to May 16, 1964, he starred in Bitte in zehn Minuten zu Tisch on WDR television, assisted by his wife Erika, and provided his audience with suggestions for creative cooking in 185 broadcasts. Wilmenrod, also known as \\"Don Clemente\\", wore a trademark apron with a caricature by Mirko Szewczuk. The dishes presented were characterized by the general scarcity of the post- war period, and Wilmenrod was not ashamed to use canned vegetables, instant sauces, and even ketchup. While this may not measure up to the current state of the culinary art, he had a great influence on the post-war generation in Germany: his programmes and cookbooks were blockbusters, and when he presented a cod recipe, for instance, cod would be sold out for weeks. In one memorable incident, after being accused by a viewer of not having invented the \\"filled strawberry\\" himself, Wilmenrod put a long cook's knife against his chest and swore to kill himself if a single viewer who had previously eaten filled strawberry were to call.

In the context of software applications, an icon often represents a program, a function, data or a collection of data on a computer system.  Style and usage  Icon designs can be simple, with flat two-dimensional drawing or a black silhouette, or complex, presenting a combination of graphic design elements such as one or more linear and radial color gradients, projected shadows, contour shades, and three-dimensional perspective effects.  Sizing  As computer icons can be used in different sizes, icon design involves creating master artwork usually for the biggest size used and producing smaller sizes from it. It is desirable to comply with overall style of the icon set, using the same color palette, perspective and renderings for all icons. Special attention is given to eliminating unnecessary details and aligning strokes and objects to pixels in small icon sizes to avoid messy and blurred images. Many modern icons have a maximum size of 1024 by 1024 pixels or greater. The challenge of icon design is to create an image that is communicative, beautiful, and understandable, at every size from this maximum resolution down to the minimum resolution of 16 by 16 pixels. Many icon formats allow one icon to include hinting to ensure visual clarity at smaller resolutions, or even completely different subsidiary images for smaller sizes (for instance, a keyboard at larger sizes, and a single keycap at smaller ones).  Usage  The most common and important examples are application icons, used to represent an app on Mac, Windows, Linux, or mobile platforms. These icons rely on unique and memorable metaphors as a form of product branding. Other common uses include favicons, toolbar icons, and icons for buttons or controls.  Process  Custom icon design process scheme with icons examples illustrating different aspects of icon design The process of icon design can be divided into two parts: defining the pictogram and creating final design or illustration.  Defining pictograms  There are three main approaches in defining pictograms. # The first and the most desirable in icon design practice is using conventional images. # If there is no conventional pictogram for the particular icon, a designer can use a literal image, including an image that is shared by the main concept (for example printer is shared image for printing concept), or metaphorical image. # After the pictogram is defined, it is necessary to check it for possible conflicts (for example the snail image is a good metaphor for slow motion but if used as a road sign it will conflict with literal and partially conventional meaning \\"snails on the road\\"). Defining the pictogram can be different for the toolbar and other functional icons in the interface and for the icons representing independent software applications or websites which are closer to logotype or mascot design.  Notable icon designers  * Susan Kare, one of the early professional icon designers, designed many of the icons contained within the Classic Mac OS. * Jon Hicks created the icon for the Firefox Browser and the emoticons for Skype.

A DAS typically comprises chaff, flares, and electronic countermeasures combined with radar warning receivers to detect threats. On some modern aircraft (Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II), the entire system is integrated and computer-controlled, allowing an aircraft to autonomously detect, classify and act in an optimal manner against a potential threat to its safety. Military technology ","title":"Defensive aids system"},{"id":"1358159","text":"The top end of the aircraft's vertical stabilizer contains a Radar warning receiver, part of the Rafale's SPECTRA self defense system Radar warning receiver (RWR) systems detect the radio emissions of radar systems. Their primary purpose is to issue a warning when a radar signal that might be a threat (such as a police speed detection radar or a fighter jet's fire control radar) is detected. The warning can then be used, manually or automatically, to evade the detected threat. RWR systems can be installed in all kind of airborne, sea-based, and ground-based assets (such as aircraft, ships, automobiles, military bases). This article is focused mainly on airborne military RWR systems; for commercial police RWR systems, see radar detector. Depending on the market the RWR system is designed for, it can be as simple as detecting the presence of energy in a specific radar band (such as police radar detectors). For more critical situations, such as military combat, RWR systems are often capable of classifying the source of the radar by the signal's strength, phase and waveform type, such as pulsed power wave or continuous wave with amplitude modulation or frequency modulation (chirped). The information about the signal's strength and waveform can then be used to estimate the most probable type of threat the detected radar poses. Simpler systems are typically installed in less expensive assets like automobiles, while more sophisticated systems are installed in mission critical assets such as military aircraft. Description The RWR usually has a visual display somewhere prominent in the cockpit (in some modern aircraft, in multiple locations in the cockpit) and also generates audible tones which feed into the pilot's (and perhaps RIO/co-pilot/GIB's in a multi-seat aircraft) headset. The visual display often takes the form of a circle, with symbols displaying the detected radars according to their direction relative to the current aircraft heading (i.e. a radar straight ahead displayed at the top of the circle, directly behind at the bottom, etc.). The distance from the center of the circle, depending on the type of unit, can represent the estimated distance from the generating radar, or to categorize the severity of threats to the aircraft, with tracking radars placed closer to the center than search radars. The symbol itself is related to the type of radar or the type of vehicle that carries it, often with a distinction made between ground-based radars and airborne radars. The typical airborne RWR system consists of multiple wideband antennas placed around the aircraft which receive the radar signals. The receiver periodically scans across the frequency band and determines various parameters of the received signals, like frequency, signal shape, direction of arrival, pulse repetition frequency, etc. By using these measurements, the signals are first deinterleaved to sort the mixture of incoming signals by emitter type. These data are then further sorted by threat priority and displayed. The RWR is used for identifying, avoiding, evading or engaging threats. For example, a fighter aircraft on a combat air patrol (CAP) might notice enemy fighters on the RWR and subsequently use its own radar set to find and eventually engage the threat. In addition, the RWR helps identify and classify threats‚Äîit's hard to tell which blips on a radar console-screen are dangerous, but since different fighter aircraft typically have different types of radar sets, once they turn them on and point them near the aircraft in question it may be able to tell, by the direction and strength of the signal, which of the blips is which type of fighter. A non-combat aircraft, or one attempting to avoid engagements, might turn its own radar off and attempt to steer around threats detected on the RWR. Especially at high altitude (more than 30,000 feet AGL), very few threats exist that don't emit radiation. As long as the pilot is careful to check for aircraft that might try to sneak up without radar, say with the assistance of AWACS or GCI, it should be able to steer clear of SAMs, fighter aircraft and high altitude, radar-directed AAA. SEAD and ELINT aircraft often have sensitive and sophisticated RWR equipment like the U.S. HTS (HARM targeting system) pod which is able to find and classify threats which are much further away than those detected by a typical RWR, and may be able to overlay threat circles on a map in the aircraft's multi-function display (MFD), providing much betterhttp://www.dtic.mil/descriptivesum/Y2000/Navy/0603270N.pdf information for avoiding or engaging threats, and may even store information to be analyzed later or transmitted to the ground to help the commanders plan future missions. The RWR can be an important tool for evading threats if avoidance has failed. For example, if a SAM system or enemy fighter aircraft has fired a missile (for example, a SARH-guided missile) at the aircraft, the RWR may be able to detect the change in mode that the radar must use to guide the missile and notify the pilot with much more insistent warning tones and flashing, bracketed symbols on the RWR display. The pilot then can take evasive action to break the missile lock-on or dodge the missile. The pilot may even be able to visually acquire the missile after being alerted to the possible launch. What's more, if an actively guided missile is tracking the aircraft, the pilot can use the direction and distance display of the RWR to work out which evasive maneuvers to perform to outrun or dodge the missile. For example, the rate of closure and aspect of the incoming missile may allow the pilot to determine that if they dive away from the missile, it is unlikely to catch up, or if it is closing fast, that it is time to jettison external supplies and turn toward the missile in an attempt to out-turn it. The RWR may be able to send a signal to another defensive system on board the aircraft, such as a Countermeasure Dispensing System (CMDS), which can eject countermeasures such as chaff, to aid in avoidance.

It was published by THQ for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld game console in North America and Europe in 2005. The game was published internationally on mobile phones by In- Fusio in both 2005 and 2006. The game stars Mr. Pants, a crudely drawn mascot formerly featured on Rare's website who had made cameo appearances in several prior Rare games.  Gameplay  The basic idea of the game is to create rectangles which have to be two-by-three blocks or larger to clear them from the grid. Blocks cannot be placed on top of blocks of the same color that are already on the grid, but they can be placed on top of blocks of any other color which causes the different blocks on the grid to disappear. The game incorporates three main game modes: Puzzle, Wipeout and Marathon. There is also a fourth game mode called \\"Max's Mystical Muddle\\" which is opened up by completing all of the puzzles in Puzzle mode.  Development and release It's Mr. Pants was developed by Rare, which, during much of the game's production, was a second-party developer for Nintendo. Rare was responsible for creating games in Nintendo's long-running Donkey Kong franchise. Early in the course of development, the game went through several name changes including Splonge, Nutcracker, Animal Cracker, and Sunflower. It was eventually presented by Rare at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2001 as Donkey Kong Coconut Crackers, one of four titles for Nintendo's GBA handheld game console. In September 2002, Nintendo announced it had sold off its 49 percent stake in Rare back to latter company; Rare subsequently sold its entire company to Microsoft Studios. The Donkey Kong intellectual property for which Nintendo held Rare responsible, defaulted back to Nintendo, forcing Rare to abandon this theme for the then-upcoming puzzle game. On August 11, 2003, Microsoft announced their partnership with publisher THQ for distributing Rare's GBA titles, including the newly revealed It's Mr. Pants, set for an early 2004 release. It's Mr. Pants was originally conceived by Rare veterans Tim Stamper and Gregg Mayles. The game was chiefly designed by Justin Cook and Paul Machacek. Cook, who credits himself for creating two-thirds of the game's levels, described It's Mr. Pants as \\"just a solid puzzle game\\", stating, \\"We knew that it wasn't a big 'wow' game, but the playability was there.\\" After the breakdown of its relationship with Nintendo, Rare chose to rebrand the game with the company's online mascot Mr. Pants, which the latter company used in its website surveys collectively called \\"The Pantsboard\\". The character Mr. Pants was originally illustrated by artist Leigh Loveday, but the design was implemented into the game by Ryan Stevenson. Mayles recounted that the \\"childish\\" visual style used in It's Mr. Pants was accomplished by having the right-handed artists draw with their left hands to intentionally make the illustrations appear \\"genuinely bad\\". The Donkey Kong Coconut Crackers incarnation of the game featured the ability to switch between top-down 2D graphics and a 3D isometric layout. According to the developer, the isometric perspective was scrapped due to \\"consistency issues\\" when swapping between the two views, due to it being awkward seeing where puzzle pieces near the back of the board were, and finally because it \\"just didn't look as nice\\" as they had hoped. When It's Mr. Pants was first revealed as Donkey Kong Coconut Crackers, the game was intended to be multiplayer for up to four individuals using the GBA Game Link Cable. Rare had experimented with various multiplayer modes during the game's development, but ultimately released the game as single- player only. Once the game was submitted to THQ, the publisher requested a few slight changes be made. For instance, the \\"Crayon Snake\\" that circles around the board in Marathon Mode was originally called the \\"trouser snake\\". It's Mr. Pants was also in development for the Gizmondo handheld, but was cancelled due to the console's failure.

Yemen joined on 5 May 1945. Since its formation the Arab League has promoted the Palestinian Arab cause in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, including the imposition of the Arab League boycott of Israel. The Arab League opposed the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine in 1947. On 15 May 1948, the then seven Arab League members coordinated an invasion of what was by then the former British Mandate, marking the start of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. In 1964, the Arab League created the Palestine Liberation Organization to operate within the territory of Israel. During the Six-Day War, the Arab League imposed an oil embargo, which lasted until the Khartoum Resolution in September 1967. The League members also agreed to continue the state of belligerency with Israel and not to negotiate a settlement to the conflict. The signing of the Egypt‚ÄìIsrael Peace Treaty was condemned, and Egypt was suspended from the Arab League in 1979, which lasted until 1989. The Arab League on 15 November 1988 recognized the proclamation of the State of Palestine. The Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel signed the Oslo Accords in 1993 which led to the setting up of the Palestinian National Authority. The Arab League has not made any official statements either supporting the establishment of the Palestinian Authority or condemning it. In October 1994, Jordan signed the Israel‚ÄìJordan peace treaty with Israel, and it was not ostracized by the Arab League, as Egypt had been in 1979. In 2002, the Arab League endorsed a Saudi Arabian Arab Peace Initiative which called for full withdrawal by Israel \\"to the 1967 borders\\" in return for fully normalized relations. 1945‚Äì48 At the end of World War II in 1945, the Palestinian Arabs were leaderless. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, had been in exile since 1937, and spent the war years in occupied Europe, actively collaborating with Nazi leadership. His relative Jamal al-Husayni was interned in Southern Rhodesia during the war. As the war ended, Amin al-Husayni escaped to Egypt, and moved to Lebanon in 1959; he died in Beirut on 4 July 1974. In November 1945 the Arab League re-established the Arab Higher Committee as the supreme executive body of Palestinian Arabs in the territory of the British Mandate of Palestine. The committee was immediately recognised by the then six Arab League countries; the Mandate government recognised the new Committee two months later. However, the Committee fell apart due to infighting, and in June 1946 the Arab League imposed upon the Palestinians the Arab Higher Executive, renamed as \\"Arab Higher Committee\\" in 1947, with Amin al-Husayni (then living in Egypt) as its chairman and Jamal al-Husayni as vice-chairman. On 2 December 1945 the Arab League Council formally declared a boycott of any Jewish-owned business operating in Mandatory Palestine: \\"Jewish products and manufactured [goods] in Palestine shall be [considered] undesirable in the Arab countries; to permit them to enter the Arab countries would lead to the realization of the Zionist political objectives. 1948‚Äì49 According to an interview in an 11 October 1947 article of Akhbar al-Yom, the Arab League Secretary Azzam Pasha reportedly said: \\"I personally wish that the Jews do not drive us to this war, as this will be a war of extermination and a momentous massacre which will be spoken of like the Mongolian massacres and the Crusades\\".Sachar, 1979, p. 333. The second part of this sentence, without the caveat that he hoped to avoid war and incorrectly dated to 15 May 1948 (the day after the Israeli Declaration of Independence), became known as the Azzam Pasha quotation, after it was widely disseminated in English as anti-Arab propaganda. The Arab League bitterly opposed any attempts to establish a Jewish state and worked strenuously to defeat any partition of Palestine. When the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was adopted in resolution 181(II) by the General Assembly on 29 November 1947, it was unanimously rejected by the Arab League and by all its members and by leaders of the Arab community, including the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee. On Friday, 14 May 1948, a day before the British Mandate over Palestine expired (the next day being Shabbat), the Jewish People's Council gathered at the Tel Aviv Museum, and approved a proclamation declaring the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel. The next day the seven Arab League members, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Transjordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, coordinated a march with their forces into what the previous day had been the area of the British Mandate, marking the start of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. In the introduction to the cablegram from the Secretary- General of the League of Arab States to the UN Secretary-General on 15 May 1948, the Arab League gave reasons for the intervention of the Arab States: :On the occasion of the intervention of Arab States in Palestine to restore law and order and to prevent disturbances prevailing in Palestine from spreading into their territories and to check further bloodshed. Clause 10 of the Cablegram said:- :10. Now that the Mandate over Palestine has come to an end, leaving no legally constituted authority behind in order to administer law and order in the country and afford the necessary and adequate protection to life and property, the Arab States declare as follows: :(a) The right to set up a Government in Palestine pertains to its inhabitants under the principles of self-determination recognized by the Covenant of the League of Nations as well as the United Nations Charter. :(b) Peace and order have been completely upset in Palestine, and, in consequence of Jewish aggression, approximately over a quarter of a million of the Arab population have been compelled to leave their homes and emigrate to neighbouring Arab countries. :(c) The Mandatory has already announced that on the termination of the Mandate it will no longer be responsible for the maintenance of law and order in Palestine except in the camps and areas actually occupied by its forces, and only to the extent necessary for the security of those forces and their withdrawal. The Cablegram also declared - :The Arab States recognize that the independence and sovereignty of Palestine which was so far subject to the British Mandate has now, with the termination of the Mandate, become established in fact, and maintain that the lawful inhabitants of Palestine are alone competent and entitled to set up an administration in Palestine for the discharge of all governmental functions without any external interference. As soon as that stage is reached the intervention of the Arab States, which is confined to the restoration of peace and establishment of law and order, shall be put an end to, and the sovereign State of Palestine will be competent in co-operation with the other States members of the Arab League, to take every step for the promotion of the welfare and security of its peoples and territory. Six days after the invasion, Azzam told reporters: :\\"We are fighting for an Arab Palestine. Whatever the outcome the Arabs will stick to their offer of equal citizenship for Jews in Arab Palestine and let them be as Jewish as they like. In areas where they predominate they will have complete autonomy.\\"Palestine Post, 21 May 1948, p. 3. However, despite the rhetoric Arab leaders were disunited. The Egyptians knew of Abdullah's agreement with Meir and were determined to thwart Transjordan's territorial ambitions, \\"thus the Arab war plan changed in conception and essence from a united effort to conquer parts of the nascent Jewish state and perhaps destroy it, into a multilateral land grab focusing on the Arab areas of the country.\\"Morris, 1999. p.221 An Egyptian Ministerial order dated 1 June 1948 declared that all laws in force during the Mandate would continue to be in force in the Gaza Strip. On 8 July 1948, the Arab League decided to set up a temporary civil administration in Palestine, to be directly responsible to the Arab League. This plan was strongly opposed by King Abdullah I of Transjordan, and received only half-hearted support from the Arab Higher Committee. The new administration was never properly established. Another order issued on 8 August 1948 vested an Egyptian Administrator-General with the powers of the High Commissioner.Palestine Yearbook of International Law 1987‚Äì1988, Vol 4, by Anis F. Kassim, Kluwer Law International (1 June 1988), , p 294 The Egyptian government, suspicious of King Abdullah's intentions and growing power in Palestine, put a proposal to the Arab League meeting that opened in Alexandria on 6 September 1948. The plan would turn the temporary civil administration, which had been agreed to in July, into an Arab government with a seat in Gaza for the whole of Palestine. The formal announcement of the Arab League's decision to form the All-Palestine Government was issued on 20 September. The All-Palestine Government was established in Gaza on 22 September 1948 and was recognised by all Arab League countries except Jordan; and on 30 September a rival First Palestinian Congress was convened in Amman and promptly denounced the Gaza \\"government\\". \\"A key feature of the Arabs' plans was the complete marginalization of the Palestinians... This aptly reflected the political reality: The military defeats of April‚ÄìMay had rendered them insignificant. The Arab League through the first half of 1948 had consistently rejected Husseini's appeals to establish a government-in-exile... Under strong pressure from Egypt, which feared complete Hashemite control over the Palestinians, the League Political Committee in mid-September authorized the establishment of a Palestinian 'government.'\\"Morris, 1999. p.222 1949‚Äì1967 As a result of 1949 Armistice Agreements, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem were ruled by Jordan, while the Gaza Strip was occupied by Egypt until the 1967 Six-Day War. During the first few months of 1950, Israel and Jordan came very close to creating a separate \\"five-year non-aggression agreement\\". However, on 13 April 1950, Arab League members signed an agreement on Joint Defense and Economic Cooperation, which committed the signatories to coordination of military defense measures, and \\"the Arab League resolved to expel any Arab state which reached a separate economic, political or military agreement with Israel.\\"Oded, Eran. \\"Arab-Israel Peacemaking.\\" The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East. Ed. Avraham Sela. New York: Continuum, 2002. Under pressure from the Arab League, the agreement between Israel and Jordan never came to pass. Jordan formally annexing the West Bank on 24 April 1950. King Abdallah was assassinated on 20 July 1951. In 1959, without reference to the Arab League that had created it, Gamal Abdel Nasser officially dissolved the All-Palestine Government by decree, arguing that the All-Palestine Government had failed to successfully advance the Palestinian cause. The Gaza Strip became directly administered by Egypt. At that time, Amin al-Husayni moved from Egypt to Lebanon. At the Cairo Summit of 1964, the Arab League initiated the creation of an organisation representing the Palestinian people. The first Palestinian National Council convened in East Jerusalem on 29 May 1964. The Palestine Liberation Organization was founded during this meeting on 2 June 1964. The area of activity for the PLO was clearly within the then borders of the State of Israel: the Palestinian National Charter of 1964 stated: :This Organization does not exercise any territorial sovereignty over the West Bank in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, on the Gaza Strip or in the Himmah Area.Article 24 of the Palestinian National Charter of 1964 According to Yaacov Lozowick, \\"It was not the Palestinians themselves who decided to create the PLO after their defeat in 1948; the Arab League set it up in 1964 to attack Israel. For years, Palestinian independence was off the Arab agenda; now it was back. Inventing the PLO was a prelude to war, not a result of it; the goal was to destroy Israel, not to rectify the misfortune of the Palestinians, which still could have been done by the Arab states irrespective of Israel.\\" Yaacov Lozowick, \\"Right to Exist: A Moral Defense of Israel's Wars\\", 2003. p.126 1967‚Äì2000 On 1 September 1967, in the wake of the Six- Day War, eight leaders of Arab countries issued the Khartoum Resolution. Paragraph 3 of the resolution became known as the Three Nos: \\"no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it.\\" President Anwar Sadat's visit to Jerusalem, the 1978 Camp David Peace Accords between Egypt and Israel and the Egypt‚ÄìIsrael Peace Treaty were each condemned in the Arab World, and Egypt was suspended from the Arab League in 1979 after signing a peace treaty with Israel and the League's headquarters was moved from Cairo. Egypt was readmitted in 1989. On 15 November 1988, the Palestinian National Council unilaterally proclaimed the establishment of the State of Palestine, which the Arab League immediately recognized. At the time, the PLO was based in Tunis and did not have control over any part of Palestine. On 13 September 1993, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel signed the Oslo Accords which led to the setting up of the Palestinian National Authority. The Accords made no reference to the declaration of 1988 of Palestinian statehood, and marked the first political agreement between Palestinian Arab leaders and Israel. The Arab League has not made any official statements either supporting the establishment of the Palestinian Authority or condemning it. In October 1994, Jordan signed the Israel‚ÄìJordan peace treaty with Israel, and it was not ostracized by the Arab League, as Egypt had been in 1979. After 2000 In 2002, Saudi Arabia proposed the Arab Peace Initiative in The New York Times, which was endorsed unanimous at a summit meeting of the Arab League in Beirut. The plan is based on UN Security Council Resolution 242 and Resolution 338, but makes more demands, essentially calling for full withdrawal by Israel \\"to the 1967 borders\\" (i.e., the 1949 Armistice line) in return for fully normalized relations with the whole Arab world. In response, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres stated: \\"... the Saudi step is an important one, but it is liable to founder if terrorism is not stopped. ... It is ... clear that the details of every peace plan must be discussed directly between Israel and the Palestinians, and to make this possible, the Palestinian Authority must put an end to terror, the horrifying expression of which we witnessed just last night in Netanya\\", referring to the Netanya suicide attack.Response of FM Peres to the decisions of the Arab Summit in Beirut 28 March 2002 (Israeli MFA) The Arab League has since re-endorsed the Initiative on several occasions, including at the Riyadh Summit in March 2007.Time to Test the Arab Peace Offer .

It combines the features of pulse radars and continuous-wave radars, which were formerly separate due to the complexity of the electronics. The first operational Pulse Doppler radar was in the CIM-10 Bomarc, an American long range supersonic missile powered by ramjet engines, and which was armed with a W40 nuclear weapon to destroy entire formations of attacking enemy aircraft.Tactical missile aerodynamics, Volume 141. P17. Michael J. Hemsch, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 1992Pulse-Doppler systems were first widely used on fighter aircraft starting in the 1960s. Earlier radars had used pulse- timing in order to determine range and the angle of the antenna (or similar means) to determine the bearing. However, this only worked when the radar antenna was not pointed down; in that case the reflection off the ground overwhelmed any returns from other objects. As the ground moves at the same speed but opposite direction of the aircraft, Doppler techniques allow the ground return to be filtered out, revealing aircraft and vehicles. This gives pulse-Doppler radars \\"look-down/shoot-down\\" capability. A secondary advantage in military radar is to reduce the transmitted power while achieving acceptable performance for improved safety of stealthy radar. Pulse-Doppler techniques also find widespread use in meteorological radars, allowing the radar to determine wind speed from the velocity of any precipitation in the air. Pulse-Doppler radar is also the basis of synthetic aperture radar used in radar astronomy, remote sensing and mapping. In air traffic control, they are used for discriminating aircraft from clutter. Besides the above conventional surveillance applications, pulse-Doppler radar has been successfully applied in healthcare, such as fall risk assessment and fall detection, for nursing or clinical purposes. History The earliest radar systems failed to operate as expected. The reason was traced to Doppler effects that degrade performance of systems not designed to account for moving objects. Fast-moving objects cause a phase-shift on the transmit pulse that can produce signal cancellation. Doppler has maximum detrimental effect on moving target indicator systems, which must use reverse phase shift for Doppler compensation in the detector. Doppler weather effects (precipitation) were also found to degrade conventional radar and moving target indicator radar, which can mask aircraft reflections. This phenomenon was adapted for use with weather radar in the 1950s after declassification of some World War II systems. Pulse-Doppler radar was developed during World War II to overcome limitations by increasing pulse repetition frequency. This required the development of the klystron, the traveling wave tube, and solid state devices. Early pulse-dopplers were incompatible with other high power microwave amplification devices that are not coherent, but more sophisticated techniques were developed that record the phase of each transmitted pulse for comparison to returned echoes. Early examples of military systems includes the AN/SPG-51B developed during the 1950s specifically for the purpose of operating in hurricane conditions with no performance degradation. The Hughes AN/ASG-18 Fire Control System was a prototype airborne radar/combination system for the planned North American XF-108 Rapier interceptor aircraft for the United States Air Force, and later for the Lockheed YF-12. The US's first pulse-Doppler radar,Pace 1991, p. 152. the system had look-down/shoot-down capability and could track one target at a time. Weather, chaff, terrain, flying techniques, and stealth are common tactics used to hide aircraft from radar. Pulse-Doppler radar eliminates these weaknesses. It became possible to use pulse-Doppler radar on aircraft after digital computers were incorporated in the design. Pulse-Doppler provided look-down/shoot-down capability to support air-to-air missile systems in most modern military aircraft by the mid 1970s. Principle Principle of pulse- Doppler radar Range measurement Principle of pulsed radar Pulse-Doppler systems measure the range to objects by measuring the elapsed time between sending a pulse of radio energy and receiving a reflection of the object. Radio waves travel at the speed of light, so the distance to the object is the elapsed time multiplied by the speed of light, divided by two - there and back. Velocity measurement Change of wavelength caused by motion of the source Pulse-Doppler radar is based on the Doppler effect, where movement in range produces frequency shift on the signal reflected from the target. :\\\\text{Doppler frequency} = \\\\frac{2 \\\\times \\\\text{transmit frequency} \\\\times \\\\text{range velocity}}{C}. Radial velocity is essential for pulse-Doppler radar operation. As the reflector moves between each transmit pulse, the returned signal has a phase difference, or phase shift, from pulse to pulse. This causes the reflector to produce Doppler modulation on the reflected signal. Pulse-Doppler radars exploit this phenomenon to improve performance. The amplitude of the successively returning pulse from the same scanned volume is :I = I_0 \\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{4\\\\pi (x_0 + v \\\\Delta t)}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right) = I_0 \\\\sin(\\\\Theta_0 + \\\\Delta\\\\Theta), where :x_0 is the distance radar to target, :\\\\lambda is the radar wavelength, :\\\\Delta t it the time between two pulses. So :\\\\Delta\\\\Theta = \\\\frac{4\\\\pi v \\\\Delta t}{\\\\lambda}. This allows the radar to separate the reflections from multiple objects located in the same volume of space by separating the objects using a spread spectrum to segregate different signals: :v = \\\\text{target speed} = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda\\\\Delta\\\\Theta}{4\\\\pi \\\\Delta t}, where \\\\Delta\\\\Theta is the phase shift induced by range motion. Benefits Rejection speed is selectable on pulse-Doppler aircraft-detection systems so nothing below that speed will be detected. A one degree antenna beam illuminates millions of square feet of terrain at range, and this produces thousands of detections at or below the horizon if Doppler is not used. Pulse- Doppler radar uses the following signal processing criteria to exclude unwanted signals from slow-moving objects. This is also known as clutter rejection. Rejection velocity is usually set just above the prevailing wind speed (10 to 100 mile/hour or 15 to 150 km/hour). The velocity threshold is much lower for weather radar. : \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\frac{\\\\text{Doppler frequency} \\\\times C}{2 \\\\times \\\\text{transmit frequency}} \\\\right\\\\vert > \\\\text{velocity threshold}. In airborne pulse-Doppler radar, the velocity threshold is offset by the speed of the aircraft relative to the ground. : \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\frac{\\\\text{Doppler frequency} \\\\times C}{2 \\\\times \\\\text{transmit frequency}} - \\\\text{ground speed} \\\\times \\\\cos\\\\Theta \\\\right\\\\vert > \\\\text{velocity threshold}, where \\\\Theta is the angle offset between the antenna position and the aircraft flight trajectory. Surface reflections appear in almost all radar. Ground clutter generally appears in a circular region within a radius of about near ground-based radar. This distance extends much further in airborne and space radar. Clutter results from radio energy being reflected from the earth surface, buildings, and vegetation. Clutter includes weather in radar intended to detect and report aircraft and spacecraft. Clutter creates a vulnerability region in pulse-amplitude time-domain radar. Non-Doppler radar systems cannot be pointed directly at the ground due to excessive false alarms, which overwhelm computers and operators. Sensitivity must be reduced near clutter to avoid overload. This vulnerability begins in the low-elevation region several beam widths above the horizon, and extends downward. This also exists throughout the volume of moving air associated with weather phenomenon. Pulse- Doppler radar corrects this as follows. * Allows the radar antenna to be pointed directly at the ground without overwhelming the computer and without reducing sensitivity. * Fills in the vulnerability region associated with pulse-amplitude time-domain radar for small object detection near terrain and weather. * Increases detection range by 300% or more in comparison to moving target indication (MTI) by improving sub-clutter visibility. Clutter rejection capability of about 60 dB is needed for look-down/shoot-down capability, and pulse-Doppler is the only strategy that can satisfy this requirement. This eliminates vulnerabilities associated with the low-elevation and below-horizon environment. Pulse compression, and moving target indicator (MTI) provide up to 25 dB sub-clutter visibility. MTI antenna beam is aimed above horizon to avoid excessive false alarm rate, which renders systems vulnerable. Aircraft and some missiles exploit this weakness using a technique called flying below the radar to avoid detection (Nap-of-the-earth). This flying technique is ineffective against pulse-Doppler radar. Pulse-Doppler provides an advantage when attempting to detect missiles and low observability aircraft flying near terrain, sea surface, and weather. Audible Doppler and target size support passive vehicle type classification when identification friend or foe is not available from a transponder signal. Medium pulse repetition frequency (PRF) reflected microwave signals fall between 1,500 and 15,000 cycle per second, which is audible. This means a helicopter sounds like a helicopter, a jet sounds like a jet, and propeller aircraft sound like propellers. Aircraft with no moving parts produce a tone. The actual size of the target can be calculated using the audible signal. Detriments Maximum range from reflectivity (red) and unambiguous Doppler velocity range (blue) with a fix pulse repetition rate.Ambiguity processing is required when target range is above the red line in the graphic, which increases scan time. Scan time is a critical factor for some systems because vehicles moving at or above the speed of sound can travel one mile (1.6 km) every few seconds, like the Exocet, Harpoon, Kitchen, and Air-to-air missile. The maximum time to scan the entire volume of the sky must be on the order of a dozen seconds or less for systems operating in that environment. Pulse-Doppler radar by itself can be too slow to cover the entire volume of space above the horizon unless fan beam is used. This approach is used with the AN/SPS 49(V)5 Very Long Range Air Surveillance Radar, which sacrifices elevation measurement to gain speed. Pulse-Doppler antenna motion must be slow enough so that all the return signals from at least 3 different PRFs can be processed out to the maximum anticipated detection range. This is known as dwell time. Antenna motion for pulse-Doppler must be as slow as radar using MTI. Search radar that include pulse-Doppler are usually dual mode because best overall performance is achieved when pulse- Doppler is used for areas with high false alarm rates (horizon or below and weather), while conventional radar will scan faster in free-space where false alarm rate is low (above horizon with clear skies). The antenna type is an important consideration for multi-mode radar because undesirable phase shift introduced by the radar antenna can degrade performance measurements for sub- clutter visibility. Signal processing The signal processing enhancement of pulse-Doppler allows small high-speed objects to be detected in close proximity to large slow moving reflectors. To achieve this, the transmitter must be coherent and should produce low phase noise during the detection interval, and the receiver must have large instantaneous dynamic range. * Pulse-Doppler signal processing detailed explanation Pulse-Doppler signal processing also includes ambiguity resolution to identify true range and velocity. * Ambiguity resolution detailed explanation The received signals from multiple PRF are compared to determine true range using the range ambiguity resolution process. * Range ambiguity resolution detailed explanation The received signals are also compared using the frequency ambiguity resolution process. * Frequency ambiguity resolution detailed explanation Range resolution The range resolution is the minimal range separation between two objects traveling at the same speed before the radar can detect two discrete reflections: :\\\\text{range resolution} = \\\\frac{C}{\\\\text{PRF} \\\\times (\\\\text{number of samples between transmit pulses})}. In addition to this sampling limit, the duration of the transmitted pulse could mean that returns from two targets will be received simultaneously from different parts of the pulse. Velocity resolution The velocity resolution is the minimal radial velocity difference between two objects traveling at the same range before the radar can detect two discrete reflections: :\\\\text{velocity resolution} = \\\\frac{C \\\\times \\\\text{PRF}}{\\\\text{transmit frequency} \\\\times \\\\text{filter size in transmit pulses}}. Special consideration Pulse-Doppler radar has special requirements that must be satisfied to achieve acceptable performance. Pulse repetition frequency Pulse-Doppler typically uses medium pulse repetition frequency (PRF) from about 3 kHz to 30 kHz. The range between transmit pulses is 5 km to 50 km. Range and velocity cannot be measured directly using medium PRF, and ambiguity resolution is required to identify true range and speed. Doppler signals are generally above 1 kHz, which is audible, so audio signals from medium-PRF systems can be used for passive target classification. Angular measurement Radar systems require angular measurement. Transponders are not normally associated with pulse-Doppler radar, so sidelobe suppression is required for practical operation. Tracking radar systems use angle error to improve accuracy by producing measurements perpendicular to the radar antenna beam. Angular measurements are averaged over a span of time and combined with radial movement to develop information suitable to predict target position for a short time into the future. The two angle error techniques used with tracking radar are monopulse and conical scan. * Monopulse radar * Conical scanning Coherency Pulse-Doppler radar requires a coherent oscillator with very little noise. Phase noise reduces sub-clutter visibility performance by producing apparent motion on stationary objects. Cavity magnetron and crossed-field amplifier are not appropriate because noise introduced by these devices interfere with detection performance. The only amplification devices suitable for pulse-Doppler are klystron, traveling wave tube, and solid state devices. Scalloping Pulse-Doppler signal processing introduces a phenomenon called scalloping. The name is associated with a series of holes that are scooped-out of the detection performance. Scalloping for pulse-Doppler radar involves blind velocities created by the clutter rejection filter. Every volume of space must be scanned using 3 or more different PRF. A two PRF detection scheme will have detection gaps with a pattern of discrete ranges, each of which has a blind velocity. Windowing Ringing artifacts pose a problem with search, detection, and ambiguity resolution in pulse-Doppler radar. Ringing is reduced in two ways. First, the shape of the transmit pulse is adjusted to smooth the leading edge and trailing edge so that RF power is increased and decreased without an abrupt change. This creates a transmit pulse with smooth ends instead of a square wave, which reduces ringing phenomenon that is otherwise associated with target reflection. Second, the shape of the receive pulse is adjusted using a window function that minimizes ringing that occurs any time pulses are applied to a filter. In a digital system, this adjusts the phase and/or amplitude of each sample before it is applied to the fast Fourier transform. The Dolph-Chebyshev window is the most effective because it produces a flat processing floor with no ringing that would otherwise cause false alarms. Antenna Pulse-Doppler radar is generally limited to mechanically aimed antennas and active phase array. Mechanical RF components, such as wave-guide, can produce Doppler modulation due to phase shift induced by vibration. This introduces a requirement to perform full spectrum operational tests using shake tables that can produce high power mechanical vibration across all anticipated audio frequencies. Doppler is incompatible with most electronically steered phase-array antenna. This is because the phase-shifter elements in the antenna are non-reciprocal and the phase shift must be adjusted before and after each transmit pulse. Spurious phase shift is produced by the sudden impulse of the phase shift, and settling during the receive period between transmit pulses places Doppler modulation onto stationary clutter. That receive modulation corrupts the measure of performance for sub-clutter visibility. Phase shifter settling time on the order of 50ns is required. Start of receiver sampling needs to be postponed at least 1 phase-shifter settling time-constant (or more) for each 20 dB of sub- clutter visibility. Most antenna phase shifters operating at PRF above 1 kHz introduce spurious phase shift unless special provisions are made, such as reducing phase shifter settling time to a few dozen nanoseconds. The following gives the maximum permissible settling time for antenna phase shift modules. :T = \\\\frac{1}{e^\\\\frac{\\\\text{SCV}}{20} \\\\times S \\\\times \\\\text{PRF}}, where :T = phase shifter settling time, :SCV = sub-clutter visibility in dB, :S = number of range samples between each transmit pulse, :PRF = maximal design pulse repetition frequency. The antenna type and scan performance is a practical consideration for multi-mode radar systems. Diffraction Choppy surfaces, like waves and trees, form a diffraction grating suitable for bending microwave signals. Pulse-Doppler can be so sensitive that diffraction from mountains, buildings or wave tops can be used to detect fast moving objects otherwise blocked by solid obstruction along the line of sight. This is a very lossy phenomenon that only becomes possible when radar has significant excess sub-clutter visibility. Refraction and ducting use transmit frequency at L-band or lower to extend the horizon, which is very different from diffraction. Refraction for over-the-horizon radar uses variable density in the air column above the surface of the earth to bend RF signals. An inversion layer can produce a transient troposphere duct that traps RF signals in a thin layer of air like a wave-guide. Subclutter visibility Subclutter visibility involves the maximum ratio of clutter power to target power, which is proportional to dynamic range. This determines performance in heavy weather and near the earth surface. :\\\\text{dynamic range} = \\\\min \\\\begin{cases} \\\\tfrac{\\\\text{carrier power}}{\\\\text{noise power}} & \\\\text{transmit noise, where bandwidth is } \\\\tfrac{\\\\text{PRF}}{\\\\text{filter size}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ 2^{\\\\text{sample bits} + \\\\text{filter size}} & \\\\text{receiver dynamic range} \\\\end{cases}. Subclutter visibility is the ratio of the smallest signal that can be detected in the presence of a larger signal. :\\\\text{subclutter visibility} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{dynamic range}}{\\\\text{CFAR detection threshold}}. A small fast- moving target reflection can be detected in the presence of larger slow-moving clutter reflections when the following is true: :\\\\text{target power} > \\\\frac{\\\\text{clutter power}}{\\\\text{subclutter visibility}}. Performance The pulse-Doppler radar equation can be used to understand trade-offs between different design constraints, like power consumption, detection range, and microwave safety hazards. This is a very simple form of modeling that allows performance to be evaluated in a sterile environment. The theoretical range performance is as follows. : R = \\\\left( \\\\frac{P_t G_t A_r \\\\sigma F D}{16 \\\\pi^2 K_b T B N} \\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{4}, where :R = distance to the target, :Pt = transmitter power, :Gt = gain of the transmitting antenna, :Ar = effective aperture (area) of the receiving antenna, :œÉ = radar cross section, or scattering coefficient, of the target, :F = antenna pattern propagation factor, :D = Doppler filter size (transmit pulses in each Fast Fourier transform), :Kb = Boltzmann's constant, :T = absolute temperature, :B = receiver bandwidth (band-pass filter), :N = noise figure. This equation is derived by combining the radar equation with the noise equation and accounting for in-band noise distribution across multiple detection filters. The value D is added to the standard radar range equation to account for both pulse- Doppler signal processing and transmitter FM noise reduction. Detection range is increased proportional to the fourth root of the number of filters for a given power consumption. Alternatively, power consumption is reduced by the number of filers for a given detection range. Pulse-Doppler signal processing integrates all of the energy from all of the individual reflected pulses that enter the filter. This means a pulse-Doppler signal processing system with 1024 elements provides 30.103 dB of improvement due to the type of signal processing that must be used with pulse-Doppler radar. The energy of all of the individual pulses from the object are added together by the filtering process. Signal processing for a 1024-point filter improves performance by 30.103 dB, assuming compatible transmitter and antenna. This corresponds to 562% increase in maximal distance. These improvements are the reason pulse- Doppler is essential for military and astronomy. Aircraft tracking uses Pulse-Doppler radar for aircraft detection has two modes. * Scan * Track Scan mode involves frequency filtering, amplitude thresholding, and ambiguity resolution. Once a reflection has been detected and resolved, the pulse- Doppler radar automatically transitions to tracking mode for the volume of space surrounding the track. Track mode works like a phase-locked loop, where Doppler velocity is compared with the range movement on successive scans. Lock indicates the difference between the two measurements is below a threshold, which can only occur with an object that satisfies Newtonian mechanics. Other types of electronic signals cannot produce a lock. Lock exists in no other type of radar. The lock criteria needs to be satisfied during normal operation. * Lock eliminates the need for human intervention with the exception of helicopters and electronic jamming. Weather phenomenon obey adiabatic process associated with air mass and not Newtonian mechanics, so the lock criteria is not normally used for weather radar. Pulse-Doppler signal processing selectively excludes low-velocity reflections so that no detections occurs below a threshold velocity. This eliminates terrain, weather, biologicals, and mechanical jamming with the exception of decoy aircraft. The target Doppler signal from the detection is converted from frequency domain back into time domain sound for the operator in track mode on some radar systems. The operator uses this sound for passive target classification, such as recognizing helicopters and electronic jamming. Helicopters Special consideration is required for aircraft with large moving parts because pulse- Doppler radar operates like a phase-locked loop. Blade tips moving near the speed of sound produce the only signal that can be detected when a helicopter is moving slow near terrain and weather. Helicopters appears like a rapidly pulsing noise emitter except in a clear environment free from clutter. An audible signal is produced for passive identification of the type of airborne object. Microwave Doppler frequency shift produced by reflector motion falls into the audible sound range for human beings (), which is used for target classification in addition to the kinds of conventional radar display used for that purpose, like A-scope, B-scope, C-scope, and RHI indicator. The human ear may be able to tell the difference better than electronic equipment. A special mode is required because the Doppler velocity feedback information must be unlinked from radial movement so that the system can transition from scan to track with no lock. Similar techniques are required to develop track information for jamming signals and interference that cannot satisfy the lock criteria. Multi-mode Pulse-Doppler radar must be multi-mode to handle aircraft turning and crossing trajectory. Once in track mode, pulse-Doppler radar must include a way to modify Doppler filtering for the volume of space surrounding a track when radial velocity falls below the minimum detection velocity. Doppler filter adjustment must be linked with a radar track function to automatically adjust Doppler rejection speed within the volume of space surrounding the track. Tracking will cease without this feature because the target signal will otherwise be rejected by the Doppler filter when radial velocity approaches zero because there is no change in frequency. Multi-mode operation may also include continuous wave illumination for semi-active radar homing.

Like all government agencies, it is accountable to the Australian Parliament. The National Archives of Australia Advisory Council provides advice to the Minister responsible for the Archives and the Director-General. Under the Act, the National Archives has two main roles: * to collect and preserve Australia's most valuable government records and encourage their use by the public * to promote good information management by Commonwealth government agencies, especially in meeting the challenges of the digital age. In addition to caring for its collection, the National Archives develops exhibitions, publishes books and guides to the collection and delivers educational programs. History The National Archives of Australia national office on Queen Victoria Terrace in Canberra. After World War I the Commonwealth National Library (later National Library of Australia) was responsible for collecting Australian Government records. The library appointed its first archives officer in 1944. In March 1961 the Commonwealth Archives Office formally separated from the National Library of Australia and was renamed as the Australian Archives in 1975. The Archives Act 1983 gave legislative protection to Commonwealth government records for the first time, with the Australian Archives responsible for their preservation.

A main feature of this initiative is the Bringing Them Home name index which leverages the National Archives' collection of records to facilitate genealogical research for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The National Archives also seeks to have 3% of their workforce be those who identify themselves as indigenous to foster diversity and increase representation in the archival profession. Facilities The Archives' National Office is in Canberra. It has temporarily been relocated to Old Parliament House until the end of 2018 when it will return to East Block. In 1998 the Canberra reading room, galleries and public areas of National Archives moved into a heritage listed building East Block in the Parliamentary Triangle. The building, one of the national capital's original offices, was built in 1926 beside the Provisional Parliament House. Over the years East Block housed various government departments and served as Canberra's first post office and telephone exchange. In addition to the National Office of Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), the National Archives has offices and reading rooms in each state capital: * South Australia - Adelaide * Queensland - Brisbane * Northern Territory - Darwin * Tasmania - Hobart * Victoria - Melbourne * Western Australia - Perth * New South Wales - Sydney Peter Durack in 1948 On Friday, 9 June 2017 (International Archives Day), the National Archives of Australia officially opened the new, purpose-built National Archives Preservation Facility in Canberra, separate from the National Office which houses the reading room and galleries. The building is 17,000 square meters and will add storage for more than 100 kilometers of paper and audiovisual records. On 21 September 2018, the National Archives Preservation Facility was officially renamed the Peter Durack Building after the Hon Peter Durack QC who introduced the bill creating Australia's National Archives in 1983. Australian Series System In 1966, Peter Scott of the Commonwealth Archives Office (predecessor to the National Archives of Australia) developed the Australian Series System (in practice, referred to as the Commonwealth Records Series System by the National Archives) in his paper \\"The Record Group Concept: A Case for Abandonment\\". This system represented a change in traditional archival theories of provenance that groups records by the more flexible record series rather than the record group which required all records to be filed under only one creating agency (business, government agency, individual, etc.). The new system recognizes that creating agencies change names, split and dissolve over time and provides a flexible framework to arrange their records across the different agencies which all share the same organizational content. These record series are relational in that they are linked to their historical creating agencies in their various forms to reflect changes in organizational structure over time.

Though sharing many similarities with Def Leppard's pre-Hysteria sound (Pyromania had been released the year before), the title track's musical style is a foreshadowing of what was to come a few years later, as it features a thrash metal-oriented guitar riff with more groove metal-like breakdowns. Reception In a retrospective review for Allmusic, Eduardo Rivadavia gave the album 2.5 stars out of a possible 5.

The same contest produced the novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus.https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/the-vampyre-by-john- polidori The Vampyre is often viewed as the progenitor of the romantic vampire genre of fantasy fiction. The work is described by Christopher Frayling as \\"the first story successfully to fuse the disparate elements of vampirism into a coherent literary genre.\\" Characters * Lord Ruthven: a suave British nobleman, the vampire * Aubrey: a wealthy young gentleman, an orphan * Ianthe: a beautiful Greek woman Aubrey meets on his journeys with Ruthven * Aubrey's sister: who becomes engaged to the Earl of Marsden * Earl of Marsden: who is also Lord Ruthven Plot Aubrey, a young Englishman, meets Lord Ruthven, a man of mysterious origins who has entered London society. Aubrey accompanies Ruthven to Rome, but leaves him after Ruthven seduces the daughter of a mutual acquaintance. Aubrey travels to Greece, where he becomes attracted to Ianthe, an innkeeper's daughter. Ianthe tells Aubrey about the legends of the vampire. Ruthven arrives at the scene and shortly thereafter Ianthe is killed by a vampire. Aubrey does not connect Ruthven with the murder and rejoins him in his travels. The pair are attacked by bandits and Ruthven is mortally wounded. Before he dies, Ruthven makes Aubrey swear an oath that he will not mention his death or anything else he knows about Ruthven for a year and a day. Looking back, Aubrey realizes that everyone whom Ruthven met ended up suffering. Aubrey returns to London and is amazed when Ruthven appears shortly thereafter, alive and well. Ruthven reminds Aubrey of his oath to keep his death a secret. Ruthven then begins to seduce Aubrey's sister while Aubrey, helpless to protect his sister, has a nervous breakdown. Ruthven and Aubrey's sister are engaged to marry on the day the oath ends. Just before he dies, Aubrey writes a letter to his sister revealing Ruthven's history, but it does not arrive in time. Ruthven marries Aubrey's sister. On the wedding night, she is discovered dead, drained of her blood‚Äîand Ruthven has vanished. Publication The New Monthly Magazine, 1 April 1819. \\"The Vampyre\\" was first published on 1 April 1819 by Henry Colburn in the New Monthly Magazine with the false attribution \\"A Tale by Lord Byron\\". The name of the work's protagonist, \\"Lord Ruthven\\", added to this assumption, for that name was originally used in Lady Caroline Lamb's novel Glenarvon (from the same publisher), in which a thinly-disguised Byron figure was named Clarence de Ruthven, Earl of Glenarvon. Despite repeated denials by Byron and Polidori, the authorship often went unclarified. The tale was first published in book form by Sherwood, Neely, and Jones in London, Paternoster-Row, in 1819 in octavo as The Vampyre; A Tale in 84 pages. The notation on the cover noted that it was: \\"Entered at Stationers' Hall, March 27, 1819\\". Initially, the author was given as Lord Byron. Later printings removed Byron's name and added Polidori's name to the title page. The story was an immediate popular success, partly because of the Byron attribution and partly because it exploited the gothic horror predilections of the public. Polidori transformed the vampire from a character in folklore into the form that is recognized today‚Äîan aristocratic fiend who preys among high society. The story has its genesis in the summer of 1816, the Year Without a Summer, when Europe and parts of North America underwent a severe climate abnormality. Lord Byron and his young physician John Polidori were staying at the Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva and were visited by Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Shelley and Claire Clairmont. Kept indoors by the \\"incessant rain\\" of that \\"wet, ungenial summer\\", over three days in June the five turned to telling fantastical tales, and then writing their own. Fueled by ghost stories such as the Fantasmagoriana, William Beckford's Vathek, and quantities of laudanum, Mary Shelley  * produced what would become Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus. Polidori was inspired by a fragmentary story of Byron's, \\"Fragment of a Novel\\" (1816), also known as \\"A Fragment\\" and \\"The Burial: A Fragment\\", and in \\"two or three idle mornings\\" produced \\"The Vampyre\\". Influence Polidori's work had an immense impact on contemporary sensibilities and ran through numerous editions and translations. That influence has extended into the current era as the text is seen as \\"canonical\\" and ‚Äì together with Bram Stoker's Dracula and others ‚Äì is \\"often even cited as almost folkloric sources on vampirism\\". An adaptation appeared in 1820 with Cyprien B√©rard's novel Lord Ruthwen ou les Vampires, falsely attributed to Charles Nodier, who himself then wrote his own dramatic version, Le Vampire, a play which had enormous success and sparked a \\"vampire craze\\" across Europe. This includes operatic adaptations by Heinrich Marschner (see Der Vampyr) and Peter Josef von Lindpaintner (see Der Vampyr), both published in the same year. Nikolai Gogol, Alexandre Dumas and Aleksey Tolstoy all produced vampire tales, and themes in Polidori's tale would continue to influence Bram Stoker's Dracula and eventually the whole vampire genre. Dumas makes explicit reference to Lord Ruthven in The Count of Monte Cristo, going so far as to state that his character \\"The Comtesse G...\\" had been personally acquainted with Lord Ruthven. In Kim Newman's Anno Dracula series, the character of Lord Ruthven is a prominent character. In the Anno Dracula universe he becomes a prominent figure in British politics following the ascent of Dracula to power. He is a Conservative Prime Minister in the period of the first novel and continues to hold power throughout the 19th century. Described as the \\"Great Political Survivor\\", as of 1991 he succeeds Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister (opposed to John Major). In 1819, The Black Vampyre, an American novella by Uriah D‚ÄôArcy, was published, taking advantage of The Vampyre‚Äôs popularity. Film adaptation In 2016 it was announced that the studio Britannia Pictures would be releasing a feature-length adaptation of The Vampyre. Production for the film was slated to begin in late 2018, with filming taking place in the UK, Italy and Greece. The film would be directed by Rowan M. Ashe and was scheduled for release in October 2019. Earlier adaptations of Polidori's story include the 1945 film The Vampire's Ghost starring John Abbott as the Lord Ruthven character \\"Webb Fallon\\", with the setting changed from England and Greece to Africa. Also, The Vampyr: A Soap Opera, based on the opera Der Vampyr by Heinrich Marschner and the Polidori story, was filmed and broadcast on BBC 2 on December 2, 1992, with the Lord Ruthven character's name changed to \\"Ripley\\", who is frozen in the late eighteenth century but revives in modern times and becomes a successful businessman. Theatrical adaptations In England, James Planch√©'s play The Vampire, or The Bride of the Isles was first performed in London in 1820 at the Lyceum TheatreRoy, Donald (2004). \\"Planch√©, James Robinson (1796‚Äì1880)\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press based on Charles Nodier's Le Vampire, which in turn was based on Polidori.

See Williams, Carolyn. Gilbert and Sullivan: Gender, Genre, Parody, p. 277, Columbia University Press (2010) In 1988, American playwright Tim Kelly created a drawing room adaptation of The Vampyre for the stage, popular among community theaters and high school drama clubs.

The Faroese are of mixed Norse and Gaelic origins. About 21,000 Faroese live in neighbouring countries, particularly in Denmark, Iceland and Norway. Most Faroese are citizens of the Kingdom of Denmark, in which the Faroe Islands are a constituent nation. The Faroese language is one of the North Germanic languages and is closely related to Icelandic and to western Norwegian varieties. Origins Elderly Faroese couple in the 1940s, wearing their traditional 'Sunday dress' for Church. Three Faroese women wearing traditional regalia. The student caps identify them as newly graduated. Faroese politicians, priests and choir in front of the L√∏gting (Parliament), √ìlavs√∏ka 2012. The first known settlers were Gaelic hermits and monks who arrived in the 6th century. From the ninth century onwards the Norse-Gaels came and brought Norse culture and language to the islands. Little is known about this period, thus giving room for speculation. A single source mentions early settlement, the Icelandic F√¶reyinga saga. It was written sometime around 1200 and explains events taking place approximately 300 years prior. According to the saga, many Norsemen objected to the Norwegian king's unification politics and thus fled to other countries, including the newfound places in the west. Historians have understood since the time of the F√¶reyinga saga that the Viking Gr√≠mur Kamban was the first settler in the Faroes. The Norwegians must have known about the isles before leaving Norway. If Gr√≠mur Kamban had settled sometime earlier, this could explain the Norwegians knowing about them. Another, more logical explanation might be that the Norwegians came to know about the islands by the Gaels of Scotland and Ireland. While Gr√≠mur is an Old Norse first name, Kamban indicates a Celtic origin. Thus he could have been a man from Ireland, Scotland or Isle of Man, where the Vikings already had settlements. Some place names from the oldest settlements on the Faroes suggest that some of the settlers perhaps came from the Scottish islands and the British coast. Y chromosomes, tracing male descent, are 87% Scandinavian but mitochondrial DNA, tracing female descent, is 84% Celtic.

Tompkins (1774‚Äì1825), Vice President of the United States under President James Monroe and the Governor of New York from 1807 until 1817. He had overseen some early drainage in the locality in connection with minor fortifications in the War of 1812. The park was opened in 1850. In 1857, immigrants protesting unemployment and food shortages were attacked by police. In 1863 the deadly Draft Riots occurred in the park. On January 13, 1874, the Tompkins Square Riot occurred in the park when police crushed a demonstration involving thousands of workers. The riot marked an unprecedented era of labor conflict and violence. The riot occurred in the midst of the Panic of 1873, a depression that began in 1873 and lasted for several years. Workers movements throughout the United States had been making demands of the government to help ease the strain of the depression.Gutman, Herbert G. \\"The Tompkins square 'Riot' in New York City on January 13, 1874: A re-examination of its causes and its aftermath\\".

The modern layout of the park by Robert Moses in 1936 is said to be intended to divide and manage crowds that have gathered there in protest since the 1870s. That tradition was rekindled as the park became the nursery of demonstrations against the Vietnam War in the 1960s. By the 1980s Tompkins Square Park had become for many New Yorkers synonymous with the city's increased social problems. The park at that time was a high-crime area that contained encampments of homeless people, and it was a center for illegal drug dealing and heroin use. In August 1988, a riot erupted in the park when police attempted to clear the park of homeless people; 38 people were injured.\\"Park Curfew Protest Erupts Into a Battle And 38 Are Injured\\" by Robert McFadden, The New York Times, August 7, 1988, Section B; Page 3, Column 6; Metropolitan Desk Bystanders as well as homeless people and political activists got caught up in the police actionKoch Suspends Park Curfew Following bloody clash in Tompkins Square, Manuel Perez-Rivas, Newsday, August 8, 1988, NEWS; Pg. 5. that took place on the night of August 6 and the early morning of August 7, after a large number of police surrounded the park and charged at the hemmed-in crowd while other police ordered all pedestrians not to walk on streets neighboring the park. Much of the violence was videotaped and clips were shown on local TV news reports (notably including one by a man who sat on his stoop across the street from the park and continued to film while a police officer beat him up), but ultimately, although at least one case went to trial, no police officers were found culpable. A punk rock festival has been held in the park in the years since, in commemoration of the event. The park had become a symbol of the problems in the city, including homelessness‚Äîwhich had prompted the 1988 riot. Against that backdrop, Daniel Rakowitz shocked the neighborhood in 1989 when he murdered Monika Beerle, dismembered her, made a soup out of her body and served it to the homeless in the park.Psychiatrist: Rakowitz ‚Äòexcited‚Äô recalling grisly stew, Tien-Shun Lee, The Villager, Volume 74, Number 8  June 23‚Äì29, 2004 Rakowitz, called the Butcher of Tompkins Square, was found not guilty by reason of insanity and remains incarcerated at the Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center on Wards Island.‚ÄòButcher of Tompkins Sq.‚Äô hopes to gain his release, Tien-Shun Lee, The Villager, Volume 73, Number 7  June 16‚Äì22, 2004 Further clashes occurred during May Day festivities of 1990, the culmination of a \\"Resist 2 Exist\\" Festival, which featured notable local acts and artists. 29 protesters were arrested and 25 charged with felony charges; charges that were dropped for all except Kenny Toglia, who spent a year at Rikers for misdemeanor incitement.

From June 3, 1991 to July 25, 1992, the park was closed to the public for restoration, but also to keep out the homeless and in attempt to calm tensions. The Tompkins Square Park Bandshell, a key feature of the park, was one of the first targets of these renovations. 21st century People relaxing and sunbathing on the park's central knoll Increasing gentrification in the East Village during the 1990s and 2000s, and enforcement of a park curfew and the eviction of homeless people have changed the character of Tompkins Square Park.

Since the 1980s, the asphalt that covers the multi-purpose courts at Tompkins Square Park has served as a skatepark and training grounds for multiple generations of skateboarders. Events The outdoor drag festival Wigstock, held in the park, is now part of the Howl Festival. The Charlie Parker Jazz Festival is a musical tribute to the famous former resident of Avenue B. In 2007, the New Village Music Festival was formed. This is a community music festival dedicated to celebrating New York's diverse music scene. In addition, the event highlights the importance of music and cultural arts programs throughout the city. There is also an annual event in early August commemorating the 1988 Police Riot that features neighborhood bands.

Fauna and flora=Elm trees plaque One of Tompkins Square Park's most prominent features is its collection of venerable American Elm (Ulmus americana) trees. One elm in particular, located next to the semi-circular arrangement of benches in the park's center, is important to adherents of the Hare Krishna religion. It was beneath this tree, on October 9, 1966, that A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, held the first recorded outdoor chanting session of the Hare Krishna mantra outside of the Indian subcontinent; participants in the ceremony included Beat poet Allen Ginsberg. The event is seen as the founding of the Hare Krishna religion in the United States, and the tree is treated by Krishna adherents as a significant religious site.New York City Historical Sign Listings American elm trees are known for their towering canopies, which provide abundant shade throughout the spring, summer, and fall. It is rare today to find such a collection of American elms, since many of the mature elms planted across the country have been killed by Dutch Elm Disease. This incurable disease, a fungus carried by elm bark beetles (Coleoptera scolytidae) that colonize on the branches of the elm tree, swept across the United States in the 1930s and remain a threat to the park's collection of elms. Despite having lost at least 34 of the trees, Tompkins Square Park still hosts a large assemblage of elms, which continue to this day to enchant park patrons. The East Village Parks Conservancy, a volunteer group, raises significant private funds for the ongoing care and maintenance of the American elms and other historic trees in Tompkins Square Park. Recreational facilities=Playgrounds The main playground, closest to Avenue A, features jungle gyms, rock climbing features, and a water fountain flush with the ground. There is a large sandbox, swing sets, and benches. There are two smaller playgrounds in the section of the park near 7th Street and Avenue B. The main playground reopened in August 2009 after a year- long renovation.  Multi-purpose courts  Skateboarding training facility = Since the 1980s, the asphalt that covers the multi-purpose courts at Tompkins Square Park has served as a skatepark and training grounds for generations of skateboarders. In 1989, Shut Skateboards hosted a contest at the park featuring ramps and other skate obstacles. The multi-purpose courts' asphalt is known as T.F., as well as; Thompson‚Äôs, a misnomer. T.F. stands for ‚Äútraining facility‚Äù. Many acclaimed skateboarders, including Tyshawn Jones, Alex Olson, Yaje Popson, Jarrod Brandreth, Harold Hunter, Ted Barrow, Andy Kessler, Zered Bassett, Jake Johnson, and others, have skated Tompkins Square Park, using it as a training facility. Skateboarders skate at Tompkins Square Park during the September 7th, 2019 - Save Tompkins Rally = Turfing controversy = In 2019, the Parks Department announced plans to cover over the asphalt lot in the park's northwest corner with synthetic turf by 2020. Skateboarders have protested this plan, with TF local Adam Zhu starting an online petition that garnered over 30,000 signatures. Zhu and others in the TF community planned a rally to support saving the historic skating grounds. Zhu worked with Steve Rodriguez, Carlina Rivera, Mitchell Silver, Supreme, and others to bring awareness to the turfing controversy. On Friday September 6th 2019, one day before the rally was set to take place, the Parks Department announced that they intend to keep the asphalt, scrapping plans to put down synthetic turf. As a result of the skateboarding community organizing, the asphalt in the multi-purpose courts will not be disturbed.

It now includes a surface of crushed stone [sand], three swimming pools, a tree deck, and bath areas and hoses to spray off one's pet. The run hosts the Annual Tompkins Square Halloween Dog Parade to raise money to help maintain the run. This is the biggest dog Halloween party in the United States, boasting an annual attendance of more than 400 dogs in costume and 2,000 spectators. Monuments Children at play in the summer The park contains three monuments. There is a monument in the north side of the park to the General Slocum boating disaster on June 15, 1904. This was the greatest single loss of life in New York City prior to the September 11, 2001 attacks. Over a thousand people, mainly German immigrant mothers and children, drowned in the East River that day. The area near the park, formerly known as Kleindeutschland, effectively dissolved in grief as shattered German families moved away.New York City Department of Parks & Recreation. Slocum memorial. This disaster is also memorialized in James Joyce's novel Ulysses. Additionally, the park is also the place where Indian Sadhu A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada came to sing and preach in 1966, beginning the worldwide Hare Krishna movement. An elm tree in the park's southern plaza that he chanted beneath is now considered sacred to the Hare Krishna faith, as noted by a New York City Department of Parks and Recreation plaque. The southeast corner of the park contains a statue of Samuel S. Cox (1824‚Äì1889), a New York City politician who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from Ohio and New York, and as U.S. Minister to the Ottoman Empire in 1885‚Äì1886. The Temperance Fountain located near Avenue A, South of 9th Street Transverse, was erected in 1888, during the temperance movement, to give people free access to clean drinking water so they wouldn't have to drink alcohol for refreshment. This neo-classical fountain was a gift of the wealthy San Francisco dentist, businessman, and temperance crusader Henry D. Cogswell (1820‚Äì1900). The fountain is a square granite kiosk with four stone columns supporting a canopy on whose sides the words \\"Faith,\\" \\"Hope,\\" \\"Charity,\\" and \\"Temperance\\" are chiseled. Atop this canopy is the Greek goddess, Hebe, cupbearer to the gods and goddesses on Mount Olympus.

Book The book is a description of the battlefield front-line from which the British Army attacked on the first day on the Somme, 1 July 1916, and as such is perhaps the first battlefield guide of the First World War. Masefield had originally been asked to write a full account of the Battle of the Somme (in 1916 he had written a successful book on the Battle of Gallipoli) but the project fell through when he was refused access to official army documents. All he was able to produce was his description of the battlefield as seen in 1917 following the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line. Nevertheless, The Old Front Line is still frequently referenced today as an eyewitness description of the Somme terrain and it is written with lyrical prose that is rare in books on military history. Masefield's The Old Front Line is relatively short at about 80 pages. It was reprinted in 1972 with a 70-page summary of the battle, contributed by Colonel Howard Green, MC. The 1972 version included photos of the battlefield taken in 1971, including the Lochnagar mine crater, Delville Wood and the Butte de Warlencourt.

The opposite process is proletarianization. Sociologist John Goldthorpe disputed the embourgeoisement thesis in 1967. Background Charles E. Hurst describes this change to be a result of the post-industrialization of society, in which there are far fewer manual labor jobs, which is the main classification of blue-collar work. With post-industrialization, former upper- level blue-collar workers are moving to white-collar work because of the decreased availability and prestige of manual labor jobs. Even when their actual jobs do not change, their lifestyles based on their job situation often change into a lifestyle that according to Mayer and Buckley, more closely resembles the lower-middle class than the rest of the lower blue-collar workers. The result of this idea of embourgeoisement is that more people are incorporated into the middle-class. As a result, there is decreased class consciousness and declining working class solidarity . This in turn could lead to less group action among the lower class if trying to get more rights or changes within their job field. The topic was widely discussed in academic circles in the 1960s following the publication of The Affluent Worker in the Class Structure by John H. Goldthorpe in 1963. The situation in Great Britain at the time is described in the book Must Labour Lose?, written by Mark Abrams and Richard Rose.

The river continues in a south westerly direction, passing the towns of Longreach, Stonehenge and Jundah, before reaching its confluence with the Barcoo River, 40 km north of Windorah, to form Cooper Creek. This is the only place in the world where the confluence of two rivers form a creek. From source to mouth, the Thomson is joined by 41 named tributaries over its 350 km (210 miles) course. As with all of the rivers in the Lake Eyre Basin, the waters of the Thomson never reach the sea, and instead either evaporate, or, in exceptional flood, empty into Lake Eyre. Floods are relatively common within the catchment because of the summer monsoon rains. Due to the flat nature of the country traversed, the river can then become many kilometres wide. For much of the time, however, the river does not flow, and becomes a line of billabongs, of which fifteen are named. The area through which the river flows is semi-arid blacksoil plains. The main industries of the area are sheep and beef cattle.

According to 2011 data, it covers , \\"Powierzchnia i ludno≈õƒá w przekroju terytorialnym w 2011 r.\\" and is the seat of Gmina Wo≈Çczyn. It is located within the historic region of Lower Silesia. History The name of the town is derived from the Polish word w√≥≈Ç, which means \\"ox\\". In the early 14th-century Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis the town appeared under the Latinized name Welczyn. The town was probably founded on the site of a former Slavic settlement. It was granted town rights in 1261. It was part of various duchies of fragmented Poland. Until 1294 it was part of the Duchy of Wroc≈Çaw/Breslau, afterwards the Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w/Glogau until 1312, Duchy of Namys≈Ç√≥w/Namslau until 1320, Duchy of Ole≈õnica/Oels until 1343, Duchy of Brzeg/Brieg until 1436 and afterwards the Duchy of Ole≈õnica again. It remained under the rule of the Piast dynasty until 1495, and afterwards, for about 300 years, the town was owned by the magnate Posadowski family, under the suzerainty of the Bohemian Kingdom, a part of the Holy Roman Empire, until 1526, when the Habsburgs inherited the Bohemian Crown. The town was located on a trade route connecting Krak√≥w and Wroc≈Çaw. The population made a living from agriculture, crafts and trade. Five annual fairs were held in Wo≈Çczyn, and crops and handicrafts were sold to customers not only from Silesia, but also from neighboring Greater Poland. In the 15th century the Czech Hussites and in the 17th century Polish Brethren settled in Wo≈Çczyn. In the 16th century, a municipal school known for its high level of education was established there, and in the 18th and early 19th centuries there was a well-known proseminar for Polish Lutherans, later moved to Kluczbork. In 1742 the town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. On 1 October 1868, the town was connected to a railway line. By 1907 Wo≈Çczyn had a water supply network. In the final stages of World War II, from 19 to 21 January 1945, fights were fought for the town between Nazi Germany and the Soviets. As a result, 40% of the town's buildings were in ruins. At the end of the war, the German population of the town was expelled leaving the region denuded, the region was then inhabited by a massive influx of Polish settlers and was annexed to Poland.https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Challenge_of_East_West_Migration_for/mD- xCwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv;=1&dq;=Wolczyn+German+expulsion&pg;=PA174&printsec;=frontcover#spf=1600154357637 pp. 174 Since 1994, the city has hosted an annual \\"Spotkania M≈Çodych\\" (Meeting of Youth).

Hudson, formerly Liberator, was built in 1826 for the Greek government by Smith & Dimon of New York. When Greece was unable to pay for her, she was purchased by the Navy and commissioned at New York. In 1828, Hudson began fitting out for what was to be her only cruise, and during this period was inspected by President John Quincy Adams and his entourage. The frigate sailed from New York on 28 September 1828 to serve as Commodore John Orde Creigton's flagship in the Brazil Squadron. In company with , she touched at New London, Connecticut for supplies and ammunition before turning south to reach Rio de Janeiro on 29 November to help eradicate the insidious traffic in slaves along those shores. From there Hudson conducted several patrols along the South American coast, stopping and boarding for inspection American as well as foreign ships. She also served as a harbor patrol vessel at Montevideo and Rio and cruised to Bahia and St. Catherine during her three years on station. Hudson was constructed of unseasoned white oak, rather than seasoned live oak which was preferred by the U.S. Navy. As a result, Hudson began to decay soon after her completion and was returned to the United States. Hudson departed on 13 June 1831 and reached New York via Bahia on 5 August. She remained at New York as a receiving ship until 1844, when she was broken up and sold.

Space time codes may be split into two main types: *Space‚Äìtime trellis codes (STTCs) distribute a trellis code over multiple antennas and multiple time-slots and provide both coding gain and diversity gain. *Space‚Äìtime block codes (STBCs) act on a block of data at once (similarly to block codes) and also provide diversity gain but doesn't provide coding gain. *Space‚Äìtime line codes (STLCs) is a recently proposed as a symmetric transmission scheme of the STBCs. It also provides diversity gain even when there is no channel state information (CSI) at the receiver. STC may be further subdivided according to whether the receiver knows the channel impairments. In coherent STC, the receiver knows the channel impairments through training or some other form of estimation. These codes have been studied more widely, and division algebras over number fields have now become the standard tool for constructing such codes. In noncoherent STC the receiver does not know the channel impairments but knows the statistics of the channel.

The prison was used by the British for the express purpose of exiling political prisoners to the remote archipelago. Many notable independence activists, including Sher Ali Afridi, Batukeshwar Dutt, Yogendra Shukla, and Vinayak Savarkar were imprisoned here during the struggle for India's independence. Today, the complex serves as a national memorial monument.History of Andaman Cellular Jail: Recapture of Andaman Islands to keep Political Prisoners . AndamanCellularJail.org. Retrieved 6 August 2010. History Although the prison complex itself was constructed between 1896 and 1906, the British had been using the Andaman Islands as a prison since the days in the immediate aftermath of the revolt of 1857. The Ross Island Prison Headquarters, 1872 Shortly after the rebellion was suppressed, the British executed many rebels. Those who survived were exiled for life to the Andamans to prevent their re- offending. Two hundred rebels were transported to the islands under the custody of the jailer David Barry and Major James Pattison Walker, a military doctor who had been warden of the prison at Agra. Another 733 from Karachi arrived in April, 1868. In 1863, the Rev. Henry Fisher Corbyn, of the Bengal Ecclesiastical Establishment, was also sent out there and he set up the 'Andamanese Home' there, which was also a repressive institution albeit disguised as a charitable one.George Weber, Pioneer Biographies of the British Period to 1947, np, nd, Appendix A Rev. Corbyn was posted in 1866 as Vicar to St. Luke's Church, Abbottabad, and later died there and is buried at the Old Christian Cemetery, Abbottabad. More prisoners arrived from India and Burma as the settlement grew. Source: The Hindu, 21 December 2005. Anyone who belonged to the Mughal royal family, or who had sent a petition to Bahadur Shah Zafar during the Rebellion was liable to be deported to the islands. Port Blair - Viper New Jails under construction The remote islands were considered to be a suitable place to punish the independence activists. Not only were they isolated from the mainland, the overseas journey (kala pani) to the islands also threatened them with loss of caste, resulting in social exclusion. The convicts could also be used in chain gangs to construct prisons, buildings and harbour facilities. Many died in this enterprise. They served to colonise the island for the British. By the late 19th century the independence movement had picked up momentum. As a result, the number of prisoners being sent to the Andamans grew and the need for a high-security prison was felt. From August 1889 Charles James Lyall served as home secretary in the Raj government, and was also tasked with an investigation of the penal settlement at Port Blair. He and A. S. Lethbridge, a surgeon in the British administration, concluded that the punishment of transportation to the Andaman Islands was failing to achieve the purpose intended and that indeed criminals preferred to go there rather than be incarcerated in Indian jails. Lyall and Lethbridge recommended that a \\"penal stage\\" should exist in the transportation sentence, whereby transported prisoners were subjected to a period of harsh treatment upon arrival. The outcome was the construction of the Cellular Jail, which has been described as \\"a place of exclusion and isolation within a more broadly constituted remote penal space.\\" Architecture Cellular Jail The construction of the prison started in 1896 and was completed in 1906. The original building was a puce-coloured brick building. The bricks used to build the building were brought from Burma. The building had seven wings, at the center of which a tower served as the intersection and was used by guards to keep watch on the inmates; this format was based on Jeremy Bentham's idea of the Panopticon. The wings radiated from the tower in straight lines, much like the spokes of a bicycle wheel. One of the seven wings Each of the seven wings had three stories upon completion. There were no dormitories and a total of 696 cells. Each cell was in size with a ventilator located at a height of . The name, \\"cellular jail\\", derived from the solitary cells which prevented any prisoner from communicating with any other. Also, the spokes were so designed such that the face of a cell in a spoke saw the back of cells in another spoke. This way, communication between prisoners was impossible. They were all in solitary confinement. The locks of the prison cells were designed in such a way that the inmate would never be able to reach the latch of the lock. The prison guards would lock up the inmates and throw the key of the lock inside the jail. The inmate would try to put his hand out and try to unlock the door but would never be able to do so as his hand would never reach the lock. Inmates From inside of a cell \\"The British Raj sent Indian dissidents and mutineers to a remote island penal colony in an 'experiment' that involved torture, medical tests, forced labour and, for many, death.\\" It is estimated that of the total 80,000 political prisoners, the British Raj held at the Kalapani, a very few survived. Solitary confinement was implemented as the British government desired to ensure that political prisoners and revolutionaries be isolated from one another. The Andaman island served as the ideal setting for the government to achieve this. Most prisoners of the Cellular Jail were independence activists. Some inmates were Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi, Yogendra Shukla, Batukeshwar Dutt, Babarao Savarkar, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Sachindra Nath Sanyal, Bhai Parmanand, Sohan Singh, Subodh Roy and Trailokyanath ChakravartyFreedom Fighters Deported to Andamans . AndamanCellularJail.org. Several revolutionaries were tried in the Alipore Case (1908), such as Barindra Kumar Ghose, the surviving companion of Bagha Jatin, was transferred to Berhampore Jail in Bengal, before his mysterious death in 1924. The Savarkar brothers, Babarao and Vinayak, did not know that they were in different cells in the same jail for two years. Cellular Jail balcony In March 1868, 238 prisoners tried to escape. By April they were all caught. One committed suicide and of the remainder Superintendent Walker ordered 87 to be hanged.History of Andaman Cellular Jail: Atrocities committed on early freedom fighters . AndamanCellularJail.org. Hunger strikes by the inmates in May 1933 caught the attention of the jail authorities. Thirty-three prisoners protested their treatment and sat in hunger strike. Among them were Mahavir Singh, an associate of Bhagat Singh (Lahore conspiracy case), Mohan Kishore Namadas (convicted in Arms Act Case) and Mohit Moitra (also convicted in Arms Act Case). These three died due to force-feeding.

They stole away from the islands on March 26, 1872, rowing out into the Bay of Bengal on home-made rafts across a 750-mile stretch of turbulent water, dodging schools of bounty hunters who fought over 250-rupee rewards (then ¬£25). Picked up by a British vessel, they persuaded the crew that they were shipwrecked fishermen and eventually pitched up, free, at the Strangers Home for Asiatics in London. The two were fed, clothed and given a bed. But while they slept, Colonel Hughes, the home's proprietor, took photographs that were circulated around the Empire. One morning, Mehtab and Choitun awoke to find themselves shackled and frog-marched aboard a ship bound for India. * Prisoner 68 Mahavir Singh: \\"It took a while for the whisper to reach the Yard Five Wing. By then it was 8 pm.\\" The bell rang again. Every prisoner shuffled to his locked gate. \\"The feeding tube had gone into Mahavir Singh's lungs. They were filled with milk. Doctors were now fighting to revive him. So we shouted 'Inquilab Zindabad' ‚Äì long live the revolution. 'Inquilab Zindabad'. Twenty- one warders ran out of the Central Tower. 'Inquilab Zindabad'.

Two years later, the Japanese seized the islands, transforming the penal settlement into a prisoner of war camp, incarcerating the British warders. In 1945 the Andamans would become the first piece of India to be declared independent.\\"  INA occupation  The Empire of Japan invaded the Andaman islands in March 1942 capturing the small British garrison. The Cellular Jail then became home to British, suspected British India supporters, and later of members of the Indian Independence League, many of whom were tortured and killed there.N. Iqbal Singh The Andaman Story (Delhi: Vikas Publ.) 1978 p. 249 Notionally during this period control of the Islands was passed to Subhas Chandra Bose, who hoisted the Indian National Flag for the first time on the islands, at the Gymkhana Ground in Port Blair, appointed INA General AD Loganathan as the governor of the Islands, and announced the Azad Hind Government was not merely a Government in Exile, and had freed the territory from the British rule. On 7 October 1945 the British resumed control of the Islands, and prison, following the surrender of the islands to Brigadier J. A. Salomons, of the 116th Indian Infantry Brigade, a month after the Surrender of Japan, at the end of World War II. Post Independence Another two wings of the jail were demolished after India achieved independence. However, this led to protests from several former prisoners and political leaders who saw it as a way of erasing the tangible evidence of their history. The Govind Ballabh Pant Hospital was set up in the premises of the Cellular Jail in 1963. It is now a 500-bed hospital with about 40 doctors serving the local population. The centenary of the jail's completion was marked on 10 March 2006. Many former prisoners were celebrated on this occasion by the Government of India. Apart from guided tours, a sound-and- light show is also run in the evenings narrating and showcasing the trials and tribulations of the inmates. It is available in English and Hindi. In popular culture Kaalapani, a Malayalam film was based on the prison and its inmates during 1915. Some scenes were shot in the actual prison.

Surrounded at lower elevations by the largely barren Sahara, the West Saharan montane xeric woodlands are isolated refuges of plants and animals that can survive in the higher humidity and lower temperatures of the highlands. Setting The Sahara is a vast desert, stretching across northern Africa from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea. Some mountains ranges (such as the Ahaggar, Tassili n'Ajjer, Tibesti and A√Ør) rise up from the desert and receive more rainfall and mostly present slightly cooler summer temperatures. These highlands support dry woodlands and shrublands distinct from the hot dry desert lowlands. This ecoregion has an area of . The boundaries for the largest part of this ecoregion, which includes the Tassili n'Ajjer Ahaggar and A√Ør (or Azbine) massifs, follow the 'regs,' 'hamadas' and 'wadis' above the 1,000 m contour. This covers a good part of southeast Algeria. These areas reach almost 3,000 meters in altitude. Additional areas further south were included within this ecoregion, including the A√Ør ou Azbine in northern Niger, Dhar Adrar in Mauritania, and Adrar des Iforas in Mali and Algeria, using the 500 m-elevation contour. The mountains of the West Saharan montane xeric woodland ecoregion are found within the Sahara Desert and are predominantly of volcanic origin. They rise from the surrounding flat desert landscape or sand dunes and create islands of moister habitat (guelta) which support flora and fauna. The most important area is the Tassili n'Ajjer Plateau, an outlier of the Ahaggar Mountains in Algeria which supports some near-endemic species and some globally threatened antelopes. The highest point of these mountains is 3,003 meters (Mount Tahat). Winters are quite rigorous, with an amplitude in temperature of over 20¬∞C. Day temperatures may be over 20¬∞C while nights are freezing. In summer, days are very hot, though less so than in the central Sahara. Rainfall is rare and sporadic. Flora and fauna Vegetation varies greatly depending on altitude and landscape, in particular wind protection. It is often composed of relict mediterranean vegetation. In the gueltas, vegetation is very diverse and hosts many animals. Trees may be found at lower elevations, while higher areas mostly host bushes. It is possible to find wild olive trees, or Olea lapperrini. Endemic and rare species include the Saharan Cypress (‚Äútarout‚Äù) (Cupressus dupreziana) and Saharan Myrtle (Myrtus nivellei), both of which are relict Saharan-Mediterranean species. Olive and myrtle trees grow at the bottom of wadis, intermittent stream valleys, or beside gueltas and permanent or temporary waterholes. Other species with a preference for moist habitats are Trianthema pentandra, Lupinus pilosus, and Convolvulus fatmensis. Silene kiliani, Acacia laeta, A. scorpiodes, and Cordia rochii grow in wadis. Other representatives of the 28 national Algerian plant rarities found on Tassili n'Ajjer include Ficus ingens and Anticharis glandulosa. Population and conservation The human population of the ecoregion is very small, with less than 5 persons per square kilometre. Many people are nomadic though some small cities also exist (such as Idl√®s). The vegetation remains fairly intact.

In the mid-1990s, dress-up games also became a video game genre itself in which customizing a virtual character's appearance is the primary focus.  Paper dolls  The extension of playing dress up onto dolls made of paper can be traced back as far as the mid-1700s. They have enjoyed great popularity around the world, as they are relatively cheap to produce, yet still offer a rich, dress up experience. They had been published in books, in newspapers and in magazines. In the 20th century, the genre was dominated by dolls created by artist Tom Tierny.  Virtual dress-up = Early dolls  In the mid- to late 1990s, webmasters began creating interactive virtual dress-up games in which a person could drag and drop clothes onto a paper doll-like image. One of the most notable early adaptors of virtual dress up technology were the Kisekae System Sets (KiSS), which were developed in Japan. These stand-alone games featured a manga-styled model and a small wardrobe. The next phenomenon was Dollz: small, pixel-art GIF images that were presented scattered on websites, and allowed users to be dragged onto the pixel dolls. Dollz are generally created by taking a base body (a drawing of a bald and naked body created for this purpose), and then drawing hair, clothes and accessories onto it. They are, in great majority, women, although a few male dollers exist. Dollz were first created to be used as avatars on The Palace Chat Program in 1995. The invention of dollz is attributed to Melicia Greenwood (also known as artgrrl, or shatteredInnocents), mainly because of her detailed web publishing on the history of dollz. Her new avatars were freely distributed on the main Palace server, the \\"Mansion\\". Within weeks thousands of creatively modified dollz were redistributed around the many Palace servers, replacing the default smiley face avatars that were previously used. Many teenagers adopted dollz avatars as a sign of rebellion against older Palace users.  Adobe Flash  By 2007, dress up games had changed. With the introduction of Macromedia (later Adobe) Flash technology, the number of dress-up games creator dramatically increased. Flash offered a visual-based way for artists to learn simple programming, and put a powerful tool in the hands of doll enthusiasts. The number of games and websites grew, as companies found easy success in a market that was previously under-supplied. The genre continued expanding, yielding an over-supply of mass-produced dress up game websites. The saturation is reminiscent of the video game crash of 1983.  Doll maker renaissance  In the late 2010s, a few websites managed by dedicated dress up fans utilized Adobe Flash to create dress up games that also allow complete customization of the featured character, advancing the genre to \\"doll makers\\". These applications also featured extensive hairstyle and clothing choices, allowing for longer gameplay. The games pushed beyond the usual stereotypes of the genre, and expanded to more pop culture and fantasy themes.

Like the band's next three releases, this album is musically oriented toward a glam/heavy metal sound influenced by Kiss and Van Halen, rather than the groove metal style they became famous for playing in the 1990s, starting with the release of Cowboys from Hell. It was released on the band's own label (also called Metal Magic) and produced by Jerry Abbott (under the alias \\"The Eldn'\\"), a noted country music songwriter and producer, and father of Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul, who were sixteen and nineteen years old, respectively, at the time of release.  Reception  In a retrospective review for AllMusic Eduardo Rivadavia gave Metal Magic a largely negative ranking of 1.5 stars out of a possible 5. He described the album as \\"exceedingly average hard rock and metal misfires\\" with only two promising songs in \\"I'll Be Alright\\" and \\"Widowmaker\\". Furthermore, the album's \\"strongest asset\\" even in these early years was Diamond Darrell's guitar playing.

Individual objects are detected using the Doppler effect, which causes the received signal to have a different frequency than the transmission, allowing it to be detected by filtering out the transmitted frequency. As this process also filters out slow or non-moving objects, it renders the radar immune to interference from large stationary objects and slow-moving clutter. This makes it particularly useful for looking for objects against a background reflector, for instance, allowing a high-flying aircraft to look for aircraft flying at low altitude against the background of the surface. Because the very strong reflection off the surface can be filtered out, the much smaller reflection from a target can still be seen. CW radar systems are used at both ends of the range spectrum. * Inexpensive radio-altimeters, proximity sensors and sport accessories that operate from a few dozen feet to several kilometers * Costly early-warning CW angle track (CWAT) radar operating beyond 100 km for use with surface-to-air missile systems Operation The main advantage of CW radar is that energy is not pulsed so these are much simpler to manufacture and operate. They have no minimum or maximum range, although the broadcast power level imposes a practical limit on range. Continuous-wave radar maximize total power on a target because the transmitter is broadcasting continuously. The military uses continuous-wave radar to guide semi-active radar homing (SARH) air-to-air missiles, such as the U.S. AIM-7 Sparrow and the Standard missile family. The launch aircraft illuminates the target with a CW radar signal, and the missile homes in on the reflected radio waves. Since the missile is moving at high velocities relative to the aircraft, there is a strong Doppler shift. Most modern air combat radars, even pulse Doppler sets, have a CW function for missile guidance purposes. Maximum distance in a continuous-wave radar is determined by the overall bandwidth and transmitter power. This bandwidth is determined by two factors. * Transmit energy density (watts per Hertz) * Receiver filter size (bandwidth divided by the total number of filters) Doubling transmit power increases distance performance by about 20%. Reducing the total FM transmit noise by half has the same effect. Frequency domain receivers used for continuous-wave Doppler radar receivers are very different from conventional radar receivers. The receiver consists of a bank of filters, usually more than 100. The number of filters determines the maximum distance performance. Doubling the number of receiver filters increases distance performance by about 20%. Maximum distance performance is achieved when receiver filter size is equal to the maximum FM noise riding on the transmit signal. Reducing receiver filter size below average amount of FM transmit noise will not improve range performance. A CW radar is said to be matched when the receiver filter size matches the RMS bandwidth of the FM noise on the transmit signal.  Types  There are two types of continuous-wave radar: unmodulated continuous-wave and modulated continuous-wave. Unmodulated continuous-wave Change of wavelength caused by motion of the source This kind of radar can cost less than $100 (2012). Return frequencies are shifted away from the transmitted frequency based on the Doppler effect when objects are moving. There is no way to evaluate distance. This type of radar is typically used with competition sports, like golf, tennis, baseball, and NASCAR racing. The Doppler frequency change depends on the speed of light in the air (c‚Äô ‚âà c/1.0003 is slightly slower than in vacuum) and v the speed of the target: :f_r = f_t \\\\left( \\\\frac{1+v/c'}{1-v/c'} \\\\right) The Doppler frequency is thus: :f_d = f_r-f_t = 2v \\\\frac {f_t}{c'-v} Since the usual variation of targets' speed of a radar is much smaller than c', (v \\\\ll c'), it is possible to simplify with c'-v \\\\approx c' : :f_d \\\\approx 2v \\\\frac {f_t}{c'} Continuous-wave radar without frequency modulation (FM) only detects moving targets, as stationary targets (along the line of sight) will not cause a Doppler shift. Reflected signals from stationary and slow-moving objects are masked by the transmit signal, which overwhelms reflections from slow-moving objects during normal operation. Modulated continuous-wave Frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar (FM-CW) ‚Äì also called continuous- wave frequency-modulated (CWFM) radar Jim Lesurf. \\"Improved forms of radar\\". accessdate=2014-01-24. ‚Äì is a short-range measuring radar set capable of determining distance. This increases reliability by providing distance measurement along with speed measurement, which is essential when there is more than one source of reflection arriving at the radar antenna. This kind of radar is often used as \\"radar altimeter\\" to measure the exact height during the landing procedure of aircraft. It is also used as early-warning radar, wave radar, and proximity sensors. Doppler shift is not always required for detection when FM is used. While early implementations, such as the APN-1 Radar Altimeter of the 1940s, were designed for short ranges, Over The Horizon Radars (OTHR) such as the Jindalee Operational Radar Network (JORN) are designed to survey intercontinental distances of some thousands of kilometres. In this system the transmitted signal of a known stable frequency continuous wave varies up and down in frequency over a fixed period of time by a modulating signal. Frequency difference between the receive signal and the transmit signal increases with delay, and hence with distance. This smears out, or blurs, the Doppler signal. Echoes from a target are then mixed with the transmitted signal to produce a beat signal which will give the distance of the target after demodulation. A variety of modulations is possible, the transmitter frequency can slew up and down as follows : * Sine wave, like air raid siren * Sawtooth wave, like the chirp from a bird * Triangle wave, like police siren in the United States * Square wave, like police siren in the United Kingdom Range demodulation is limited to 1/4 wavelength of the transmit modulation. Instrumented range for 100 Hz FM would be 500 km. That limit depends upon the type of modulation and demodulation. The following generally applies. :\\\\text{Instrumented Range} = F_r-F_t = \\\\frac {\\\\text{Speed of Light}}{(4 \\\\times \\\\text{Modulation Frequency})} The radar will report incorrect distance for reflections from distances beyond the instrumented range, such as from the moon. FMCW range measurements are only reliable to about 60% of the instrumented range, or about 300 km for 100 Hz FM. =Sawtooth frequency modulation= Ranging with an FM-CW radar system: if the error caused by a possible Doppler frequency f_D can be ignored and the transmitter's power is linearly frequency modulated, then the time delay (\\\\Delta t) is proportional to the difference of the transmitted and the received signal (\\\\Delta f) at any time. Sawtooth modulation is the most used in FM-CW radars where range is desired for objects that lack rotating parts. Range information is mixed with the Doppler velocity using this technique. Modulation can be turned off on alternate scans to identify velocity using unmodulated carrier frequency shift. This allows range and velocity to be found with one radar set. Triangle wave modulation can be used to achieve the same goal. As shown in the figure the received waveform (green) is simply a delayed replica of the transmitted waveform (red). The transmitted frequency is used to down-convert the receive signal to baseband, and the amount of frequency shift between the transmit signal and the reflected signal increases with time delay (distance). The time delay is thus a measure of the range; a small frequency spread is produced by nearby reflections, a larger frequency spread corresponds with more time delay and a longer range. With the advent of modern electronics, digital signal processing is used for most detection processing. The beat signals are passed through an analog-to-digital converter, and digital processing is performed on the result. As explained in the literature, FM-CW ranging for a linear ramp waveform is given in the following set of equations: ::k = \\\\frac {\\\\Delta{f_{radar}}} {\\\\Delta{t_{radar}}} :::where \\\\Delta{f_{radar}} is the radar frequency sweep amount and \\\\Delta{t_{radar}} is the time to complete the frequency sweep. Then, \\\\Delta{f_{echo}} = t_rk, rearrange to a more useful: ::t_r = \\\\frac {\\\\Delta{f_{echo}}} {k}, where t_r is the round trip time of the radar energy. It is then a trivial matter to calculate the physical one-way distance for an idealized typical case as: ::\\\\text{dist}_{oneway} = \\\\frac {c' t_r}{2} :::where c'=c/n is the speed of light in any transparent medium of refractive index n (n=1 in vacuum and 1.0003 for air). For practical reasons, receive samples are not processed for a brief period after the modulation ramp begins because incoming reflections will have modulation from the previous modulation cycle. This imposes a range limit and limits performance. ::\\\\text{Range Limit} = 0.5 \\\\ c' \\\\ t_{radar} =Sinusoidal frequency modulation= alt=Animation of audio, AM and FM signals Sinusoidal FM is used when both range and velocity are required simultaneously for complex objects with multiple moving parts like turbine fan blades, helicopter blades, or propellers. This processing reduces the effect of complex spectra modulation produced by rotating parts that introduce errors into range measurement process. This technique also has the advantage that the receiver never needs to stop processing incoming signals because the modulation waveform is continuous with no impulse modulation. Sinusoidal FM is eliminated completely by the receiver for close in reflections because the transmit frequency will be the same as the frequency being reflected back into the receiver. The spectrum for more distant objects will contain more modulation. The amount of spectrum spreading caused by modulation riding on the receive signal is proportional to the distance to the reflecting object. The time domain formula for FM is: : y(t) = \\\\cos \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 2 \\\\pi [ f_{c} + \\\\Beta \\\\cos \\\\left( 2 \\\\pi f_{m} t \\\\right) ] t \\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\, ::where \\\\Beta = \\\\frac{f_{\\\\Delta}}{f_{m}} (modulation index) A time delay is introduced in transit between the radar and the reflector. : y(t) = \\\\cos \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 2 \\\\pi [ f_{c} + \\\\Beta \\\\cos \\\\left( 2 \\\\pi f_{m} (t + \\\\delta t) \\\\right) ] (t + \\\\delta t) \\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\, ::where \\\\delta t = time delay The detection process down converts the receive signal using the transmit signal.

This takes place before Doppler CFAR detection processing. A large modulation index is needed for practical reasons. Practical systems introduce reverse FM on the receive signal using digital signal processing before the fast Fourier transform process is used to produce the spectrum. This is repeated with several different demodulation values. Range is found by identifying the receive spectrum where width is minimum. Practical systems also process receive samples for several cycles of the FM in order to reduce the influence of sampling artifacts.  Configurations  Block diagram of a simple continuous-wave radar module: Many manufacturers offer such transceiver modules and rename them as \\"Doppler radar sensors\\" There are two different antenna configurations used with continuous- wave radar: monostatic radar, and bistatic radar. Monostatic The radar receive antenna is located nearby the radar transmit antenna in monostatic radar. Feed-through null is typically required to eliminate bleed-through between the transmitter and receiver to increase sensitivity in practical systems. This is typically used with continuous-wave angle tracking (CWAT) radar receivers that are interoperable with surface-to-air missile systems. Interrupted continuous-wave can be used to eliminate bleed-through between the transmit and receive antenna. This kind of system typically takes one sample between each pair of transmit pulses, and the sample rate is typically 30 kHz or more. This technique is used with the least expensive kinds of radar, such as those used for traffic monitoring and sports. FM-CW radars can be built with one antenna using either a circulator, or circular polarization. Bistatic The radar receive antenna is located far from the radar transmit antenna in bistatic radar. The transmitter is fairly expensive, while the receiver is fairly inexpensive and disposable. This is typically used with semi-active radar homing including most surface-to-air missile systems. The transmit radar is typically located near the missile launcher. The receiver is located in the missile. The transmit antenna illuminates the target in much the same way as a search light. The transmit antenna also issues an omnidirectional sample. The receiver uses two antennasone antenna aimed at the target and one antenna aimed at the transmit antenna. The receive antenna that is aimed at the transmit antenna is used to develop the feed-through null, which allows the target receiver to operate reliably in or near the main beam of the antenna. The bistatic FM-CW receiver and transmitter pair may also take the form of an over-the-air deramping (OTAD) system. An OTAD transmitter broadcasts an FM-CW signal on two different frequency channels; one for synchronisation of the receiver with the transmitter, the other for illuminating the measurement scene. Using directive antennas, the OTAD receiver collects both signals simultaneously and mixes the synchronisation signal with the downconverted echo signal from the measurement scene in a process known as over-the-air deramping. The frequency of deramped signal is proportional to the bistatic range to the target less the baseline distance between the OTAD transmitter and the OTAD receiver.M. Ash et al., A New Multistatic FMCW Radar Architecture By Over-The-Air Deramping, IEEE Sensors Journal, No. 99, 2015. Most modern systems FM-CW radars use one transmitter antenna and multiple receiver antennas. Because the transmitter is on continuously at effectively the same frequency as the receiver, special care must be exercised to avoid overloading the receiver stages. Monopulse Monopulse antennas produce angular measurements without pulses or other modulation. This technique is used in semi-active radar homing. Leakage The transmit signal will leak into the receiver on practical systems. Significant leakage will come from nearby environmental reflections even if antenna components are perfect. As much as 120 dB of leakage rejection is required to achieve acceptable performance. Three approaches can be used to produce a practical system that will function correctly. * Null * Filter * Interruption Null and filter approaches must be used with bistatic radar, like semi-active radar homing, for practical reasons because side-lobes from the illumination radar will illuminate the environment in addition to the main- lobe illumination on the target. Similar constraints apply to ground-based CW radar. This adds cost. Interruption applies to cheap hand held mono-static radar systems (police radar and sporting goods). This is impractical for bistatic systems because of the cost and complexity associated with coordinating time with nuclear precision in two different locations. The design constraint that drives this requirement is the dynamic range limitation of practical receiver components that include band pass filters that take time to settle out. =Null= The null approach takes two signals: * A sample of the transmit signal leaking into the receiver * A sample of the actual transmit signal The actual transmit signal is rotated 180 degrees, attenuated, and fed into the receiver. The phase shift and attenuation are set using feedback obtained from the receiver to cancel most of the leakage. Typical improvement is on the order of 30 dB to 70 dB. =Filter= The filter approach relies on using a very narrow band reject filter that will eliminate low velocity signals from nearby reflectors. The band reject area spans 10 mile per hour to 100 mile per hour depending upon the anticipated environment. Typical improvement is on the order of 30 dB to 70 dB. =Interruption, FMICW= While interrupted carrier systems are not considered to be CW systems, performance characteristics are sufficiently similar to group interrupted CW systems with pure CW radar because the pulse rate is high enough that range measurements cannot be done without frequency modulation (FM). This technique turns the transmitter off for a period before receiver sampling begins. Receiver interference declines by about 8.7 dB per time constant. Leakage reduction of 120 dB requires 14 recover bandwidth time constants between when the transmitter is turned off and receiver sampling begins. The interruption concept is widely used, especially in long-range radar applications where the receiver sensitivity is very important. It is commonly known as \\"frequency modulated interrupted continuous wave\\", or FMICW. Advantages Because of simplicity, CW radar are inexpensive to manufacture, relatively free from failure, cheap to maintain, and fully automated. Some are small enough to carry in a pocket. More sophisticated CW radar systems can reliably achieve accurate detections exceeding 100 km distance while providing missile illumination. The FMCW ramp can be compressed providing extra signal to noise gains such one does not need the extra power that pulse radar using a no FM modulation would. This combined with the fact that it is coherent means that Fourier integration can be used rather than azimuth integration providing superior signal to noise and a Doppler measurement. Doppler processing allows signal integration between successive receiver samples. This means that the number of samples can be increased to extend the detection range without increasing transmit power. That technique can be used to produce inexpensive stealthy low-power radar. CW performance is similar to Pulse-Doppler radar performance for this reason. Limitations Unmodulated continuous wave radar cannot measure distance. Signal amplitude provides the only way to determine which object corresponds with which speed measurement when there is more than one moving object near the receiver, but amplitude information is not useful without range measurement to evaluate target size. Moving objects include birds flying near objects in front of the antenna. Reflections from small objects directly in front of the receiver can be overwhelmed by reflections entering antenna side-lobes from large object located to the side, above, or behind the radar, such as trees with wind blowing through the leaves, tall grass, sea surface, freight trains, busses, trucks, and aircraft. Small radar systems that lack range modulation are only reliable when used with one object in a sterile environment free from vegetation, aircraft, birds, weather phenomenon, and other nearby vehicles. With 20 dB antenna side-lobes, a truck or tree with 1,000 square feet of reflecting surface behind the antenna can produce a signal as strong as a car with 10 square feet of reflecting in front of a small hand held antenna. An area survey is required to determine if hand held devices will operate reliably because unobserved roadway traffic and trees behind the operator can interfere with observations made in front of the operator. This is a typical problem with radar speed guns used by law enforcement officers, NASCAR events, and sports, like baseball, golf, and tennis. Interference from a second radar, automobile ignition, other moving objects, moving fan blades on the intended target, and other radio frequency sources will corrupt measurements. These systems are limited by wavelength, which is 0.02 meter at Ku band, so the beam spread exceeds 45 degrees if the antenna is smaller than 12 inches (0.3 meter). Significant antenna side-lobes extend in all directions unless the antenna is larger than the vehicle on which the radar is mounted. Side-lobe suppression and FM range modulation are required for reliable operation. There is no way to know the direction of the arriving signal without side-lobe suppression, which requires two or more antennae, each with its own individual receiver. There is no way to know distance without FM range modulation. Speed, direction, and distance are all required to pick out an individual object. These limitations are due to the well known limitations of basic physics that cannot be overcome by design. Law enforcement agencies include hand held laser in the mix of tools needed for law enforcement to confirm reliable speed and position of an individual vehicle in traffic after radar detects excessive speed.

It prefers locations with rocky areas, brush or log piles, and shrubs to provide cover. Behavior It can climb trees well, but constructs underground nests with extensive tunnel systems, often with several entrances. To hide the construction of its burrow, the eastern chipmunk carries soil to a different location in its cheek pouches. It also lines the burrow with leaves, rocks, sticks, and other material, making it even harder to see.Chipmunks, Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Nebraska. p.B-14. It has several bird-like or chattering calls; one is a trill at the rate of 130 vibrations per minute and another is a lower-pitched, clicking sound.

Like other chipmunks, it transports food in pouches in its cheeks. Lifecycle The eastern chipmunk defends its burrow and lives a solitary life, except during mating season. Females usually produce one or two litters of three to five young. The two breeding seasons are from February to April and from June to August.

The programme has been funded by $600 million (USD) and, over three years, hopes to develop local democratically elected institutions which will identify, plan and manage for reconstruction in the locality. The project was initially, in its first year, aimed at bringing the regions determined to be in most danger up to safer standards - costing an estimated $92 million for this first year alone.  NSP Background  In 2001, after gaining power, Ashraf Ghani had envisioned the creation of several national development projects which would create public trust in governance. These programs included a National Emergency Employment Program to provide jobs across the country, a National Health and Education Program to get basic health packages to citizens and get children back in school, a National Transportation Program to make Afghanistan a land bridge for South and Central Asia and the Gulf, a National Telecommunications Program to set up a cell phone network across the country and attract private investment and a National Accountability Program to build good financial management (Ghani and Lockart, 2008). The NSP is inspired by the Kecamatan Development Program, a community- based program started in Indonesia by Scott Guggenheim of the World Bank in the late 1990s. After the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan, the transitional power also realized that for the people to support the state, the most crucial national development project had to be visible to the 80% of the population in the rural areas. In order to interact with these people, engage them in development, include them in the reconstruction process and provide a uniform approach across Afghanistan, the National Solidarity Program (NSP) was launched. As one of the Afghan government‚Äòs National Priority Programs the NSP has been publicized as one of the most successful CDD programmes in the world to date . As a large scale rural reconstruction and development programme, the NSP had two primary goals: to strengthen local governance to foster rule of law and to lay the foundations of community managed sub-projects comprising reconstruction and development. The reconstruction efforts would be aimed at improving access of rural communities to social and productive infrastructure and services. Launched in 2003, the program was instrumental in generating employment and initiating the rehabilitation of rural infrastructure devastated by severe drought and two decades of conflict. The president of the World Bank estimates the economic rate of return on the NSP to be almost 20 percent (Zoellick, 2008). The NSP is funded by the International Development Association at the World Bank and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund. Implemented by the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) and funded by the World Bank, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), the Danish International Development and Assistance Agency (DANIDA), the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the NSP is the Afghan government‚Äòs flagship programme. Acting as the oversight consultants and responsible for strengthening local capacity and programme management at the ministry were the consulting firms GIZ and DAI.  Implementing the NSP  NGOs act as facilitating partners contracted by the MRRD to initiate the NSP and provide technical and capacity building support to the communities. The MRRD has developed an operational manual and facilitating partners that are contracted utilize it for community implementation. The facilitating partners serve many different roles in NSP implementations including training social community organizers tasked with educating the community about NSP, engaging community facilitators, providing technical assistance in designing and building infrastructure, providing election experts to implement CDC elections and assisting with the monitoring and evaluation of projects. An NSP project cycle for a community is broken down into 5 steps and usually takes 2 years to complete. First the NSP facilitating partner is assigned to the province by contracting through the MRRD. The facilitating partner then contacts the community to inform them of the NSP and commence the community mobilization process. In the second step, the facilitating partner is responsible for initiating a fair and transparent election process to elect members of the locally governing community development council (CDC). The CDCs are elected through a process of identifying the eligible voters in a community, creating a cluster of approximately 25 families and ensuring at least 80% of the cluster votes for representatives. The elected CDC members then decide on the CDC president, deputy, secretary and treasurer. Thirdly, the newly elected CDCs consult directly with members of the community to reach a consensus list of subproject ideas. This list called the community development plan (CDP) comprises projects which can be carried out with funds from the NSP and independent of outside support. The subprojects which require NSP funding are then submitted by the CDC to the MRRD and the Oversight Consultant in a proposal. The facilitating partner is responsible for training the CDC members in project proposal writing, accounting and procurement. In the fourth step, if the proposal is approved, NSP block grants are disbursed to cover the purchase of materials. Arriving in installments the funds are also used for subproject implementation. The CDC continues to report to MRRD and to the community about the project‚Äòs implementation process and budget. Lastly, the facilitating partners and CDCs undertake an evaluation of the technical quality of completed subprojects and documents the lessons learned.  NSP Expansion  Since there is no formal census data available about Afghanistan it is hard to accurately identify the number of villages. Previously, it was estimated that approximately 20000 rural settlements or villages existed, however this was markedly increased to 42000 villages. Since field coordinators have reported that several of the villages comprise less than the minimum of 25 families required to initiate a CDC, it is estimated by the MRRD that around 28500 NSP communities would be a reasonable equivalent to rural settlements estimate. This approximation thus average 1 NSP community = 1.474 rural settlements. However the current average used is 1 NSP community = 1.583 rural settlements. (National Solidarity Program Website, 2010). Once fully implemented the MRRD expects to reach all the communities across Afghanistan through the NSP. The NSP community expansion across Afghanistan has been divided into several phases. In Phase 1 which commenced in May 2003, 3 districts in each province were targeted in the first year reaching 6000 communities. In the second year this target was expanded reaching 4500 more communities which translated into half of Afghanistan being included in the program. In 2005 or the third year of the NSP an additional 6000 communities were targeted. The NSP Phase 1 concluded in March 2007 reaching approximately 17300 communities. In Phase 2 which ran from April 2007 until March 2010 the World Bank proposed covering an additional 4300 new communities bringing the total to 21600. This coverage meant that approximately 80-90% of Afghanistan had CDCs. On June 27, 2010 the World Bank announced that it had approved a $40 million USD grant to support Phase 3 of the NSP. The third phase will build on the achievements of the first two phases of the NSP and complete the expansion of CDCs to all the rural communities in Afghanistan. In Phase 3, the Afghan government has introduced several innovations to institute the CDCs as lasting sustainable bodies of local governance. The expansion will also support the disbursement of block grants to the remaining 10320 communities for full NSP coverage across Afghanistan. In addition, to supporting the initial development needs, a second round of grants will be provided to 17,400 CDCs that have successfully used their initial grant. Most importantly, NSP III will focus on improving the institutional quality, sustainability and governance of CDCs and enhance their ability to engage with other institutions.

Buddhism Before he reached his enlightenment, the Buddha tried asceticism (self-mortification) of the type found in other ≈örama·πáa religions (Jainism), and this is referred to as Tapas (Tibetan: dka' thub, Chinese: kuxing, Japanese: kugyo, Korean: kohaeng).Randall Collins (2000), The sociology of philosophies: a global theory of intellectual change, Harvard University Press, , page 204 Post- enlightenment, the Buddhist doctrines of the Middle Way and Noble Eightfold Path did not include ascetic practices. The Buddha, in multiple Buddhist texts, such as Majjhima Nikaya and Devadaha Sutta, attributes the ascetic self-mortification style Tapas practices to Jainism (Niganthas), wherein such practices annihilate past Karmas and stop new Karmas from being created, ones that lead to the cycle of rebirths in Sa·πÉsƒÅra. These ancient Buddhist texts are significant in their claims of the existence of Jain Brahmins and ascetics, along with their karma doctrine and reasons for their Tapas practices in ancient times: These ascetic Tapas practices is also confirmed by Jainism texts such as Uttarajjhyayana. The Buddhist scholar Dharmakirti strongly criticizes the Jaina practice of Tapas as a means of liberation, while many Jainism scholars have in turn strongly criticized Dharmakirti opinion and analysis, explaining why their approach to ascetic Tapas is appropriate. According to Hajime Nakamura and other scholars, some scriptures of early Buddhism suggest that ascetic Tapas was a part of Buddhist practice in its early days, wherein body-mortification was an option for the Buddhist monk in his spiritual practice. In the Theravada tradition of Thailand, a monastic practice emerged in the 12th-century who did Tapas as ascetic wandering and forest or crematory dwelling monks, with austere practices, and these came to be known as Thudong. These ascetic Buddhist monks are also found in Myanmar, and as in Thailand, they are known to pursue their own version of Buddhism, resisting the hierarchical institutionalized sangha structure of monasteries in Buddhism. Textual evidence suggests that asceticTapas practices were a part of the Buddhist tradition in Sri Lanka by the 3rd century BCE, and this tradition continued through the medieval era in parallel to sangha style monastic tradition. In the Mahayana tradition, asceticism with esoteric and mystical meanings became an accepted practice, such as in the Tendai and Shingon schools of Japanese Buddhism. These Japanese practices included penance, austerities, ablutions under a waterfall, and rituals to purify oneself. Japanese records from the 12th century record stories of monks undertaking severe asceticism, while records suggest that 19th century Nichiren Buddhist monks woke up at midnight or 2:00 AM daily, and performed ascetic water purification rituals as a part of Tapas. Other practices include the extreme ascetic practices of eating only pine needles, resins, seeds and ultimately self-mummification, while alive, or Sokushinbutsu (miira) in Japan.Ichiro Hori (1962), Self-Mummified Buddhas in Japan. An Aspect of the Shugen-D√¥ (\\"Mountain Asceticism\\") Sect, History of Religions, Vol. 1, No. 2 (Winter, 1962), pages 222-242 Elsewhere, in mainstream Buddhism, over time the meaning of the word Tapas evolved, wherein ascetic penance was forsaken, and Tapas meant meditative and spiritual practices. The word Tapas appears extensively in Buddhist literature where, states Richard Gombrich, it does not mean \\"asceticism or mortification\\". The term Tapas means \\"meditation\\" or \\"reasoned moral self discipline\\" or both in Buddhism. According to Bailey and Mabbett, these Buddhist ideas are similar to those found in the Brahmanical (Vedic) tradition, wherein there is a great deal of overlap in the concepts of Tapas, Yoga, meditation and gnosis (knowledge), yet the term Tapas is rooted in the inner \\"mystic heat\\" themes of the Indian religions. Hinduism=History The earliest mention of Tapas is in the Vedic texts. The concept of Tapas as symbolism for spiritual rebirth begins in the Vedas.M. Eliade, Rites and Symbols of Initiation, Harper and Row, New York, pages 53-57H. Lommel (1955), Wiedergeburt aus Embryonalem Zustand in der Symbolic des Altindische Rituals, in Tod, Auferstehung, Weltordnung, ed. C. Hentze; Origo, Zurich, Switzerland Atharva Veda verse 11.5.3 compares the process of spiritual rebirth of a student in care of his or her teacher, with the gestation process during the biological birth of a baby in a mother's womb.M. Bloomfield (1964), Hymns of the Atharva Veda, Sacred Books of the East, Motilal Banarsidas, DelhiWalter O. Kaelber (May, 1976), Tapas, Birth, and Spiritual Rebirth in the Veda, History of Religions, Vol. 15, No. 4, pages 355-356 Tapas is also found in the Upanishads. The ChƒÅndogya Upani·π£ad, for example, suggests that those who engage in ritualistic offerings to gods and priests will fail in their spiritual practice while those who engage in tapas and self-examination will succeed. The ≈övetƒÅ≈õvatara Upani·π£ad states that realization of self requires a search for truth and Tapas (meditation).CR Prasad, Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Editor: Knut Jacobsen (2010), Volume II, Brill, , see Article on Brahman, pp 724-729 Meditation and achievement of lucid knowledge is declared essential to self-realization in ancient scriptures. Texts by Adi Sankara suggests Tapas is important, but not sufficient for spiritual practice. Later Hindu scholars introduce a discussion of ‚Äòfalse ascetic‚Äô, as one who go through the mechanics of tapas, without meditating on the nature of Brahman. Tapas is an element of spiritual path, state Indian texts.David Carpenter, Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Editor: Knut Jacobsen (2010), Volume II, Brill, , see Article on Tapas, pp 865-869 The concept is extensively mentioned in the Vedas,A Vedic concordance, Maurice Bloomfield, Harvard University Press, pp. 402-404 and the Upanishads.Upanishad Vakya Kosha - A Concordance of the Principal Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita G.A. Jacob, Motilal Banarsidass, pp. 395-397 weddings. Agni is considered a great tapasvin, and symbolizes the heat and patience necessary to recreate and incubate life.Walter O. Kaelber (May, 1976), Tapas, Birth, and Spiritual Rebirth in the Veda, History of Religions, Vol. 15, No. 4, pages 349-350 According to Walter Kaelber, and others,M. Winternitz (1959), A History of Indian Literature, University of CalcuttaF. Edgerton (1944), The Bhagavad Gita, Harvard Oriental Series, vol. 39, Harvard University Press in certain translations of ancient Sanskrit documents Tapas is interpreted as austerities and asceticism; however, this is frequently inadequate because it fails to reflect the context implied, which is of sexual heat or warmth that incubates the birth of life. The idea of linking austerity, exertion, fatigue and self- renunciation to the ancient idea of heat, brooding and inner devotion, comes from the observed labor every mother puts in caring for its embryo and delivering her baby, regardless of the life form; The concept and reference to 'egg hatching' is replaced in Sanskrit texts written in later centuries, with simply 'brooding' or 'incubation'.P. Deussen (1966), The Philosophy of the Upanishads, Dover Publications, New York, pages 62-71Walter O. Kaelber (May, 1976), Tapas, Birth, and Spiritual Rebirth in the Veda, History of Religions, Vol. 15, No. 4, pages 347 In ancient literature of Hinduism dedicated to love, desire, lust, seduction and sex, the root of the word Tapas is commonly used. For example, in Atharva Veda, a mantra recommended for a woman who wishes to win or compel a man's love is, 'Love's consuming longing, this passion this yearning, which the gods have poured, into the waters of life, I kindle for thee (tam te tapƒÅmi), by the law of Varuna.'C. Blair (1961), Heat in the Rig Veda and Atharva Veda, American Oriental Society Publication, no. 45, Harvard University Press, pages 101-103 Desire (kƒÅma) is homologized with the concept of Tapas, to explain the feelings and inner energy that leads to sexual intercourse.W. D. Whitney (1950), Atharva Veda Samhita, 2 vols., Harvard University PressA. L. Basham (1959), The Wonder That Was India, Grove Press, New York; pages 247-251 Agnicayana, Satapatha Brahmana and other ancient texts similarly use the root of the word Tapas to symbolize emotions, biological stages and a mother's effort from conception to the birth of a baby.Walter O. Kaelber (May, 1976), Tapas, Birth, and Spiritual Rebirth in the Veda, History of Religions, Vol. 15, No. 4, pages 346-349 Both meanings of Tapas are found in various Hindu texts. In some ancient texts, Tapas has the sense of ascetic mortification in a sense similar to other Indian religions, while in the Bhagavad Gita and the Yoga school of Hinduism, the term means self-training and virtuous living in a sense similar to Buddhism. In the Puranas and the texts of the goddess tradition of Hinduism, the term is equivalent to a devotion with intense self-discipline, believed to yield special inner powers. In contemporary usage, any practice that includes hardship and requires perseverance ‚Äì such as fasting during Vrata ‚Äì is called Tapas. Yoga and brahmacharya Pata√±jali, in his Yoga S≈´tra, lists TƒÅpas as one of the Niyamas (virtuous practices),Helaine Selin (Editor), Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures, , see Yoga article and describes it in several sections such as 2.32, 2.43 and 4.1. The term includes self-discipline, meditation, simple and austere living or any means of inner self-purification. Tapas in the Patanjali text and other Hindu texts on Yoga, states Benjamin Smith, is that which is \\"a means for perfection of the body and the organs through the lessening of impurities\\" and a foundation for a yogi's pursuit of perfection. Tapas in the Hindu traditions is part of a stage of life, called brahmacharya.Walter O. Kaelber (May, 1976), Tapas, Birth, and Spiritual Rebirth in the Veda, History of Religions, Vol. 15, No. 4, page 357-360 The Vedic literature suggests diksa (incubation of a student in a field of knowledge) requires tapas, and tapas is enabled by the state of brahmacharya. This state sometimes includes tapas such as vrata (fasting, sacrifice of food), sram (philanthropic social work, sacrifice of income), silence (sacrifice of speech), and asceticism (bare minimum living, sacrifice of comfort). Oldenberg notes that Brahmana scripture suggests that the Brahmachari should carry tapas to the very tip of his existence, which includes not cutting his hair, nail and beard.H. Oldenberg (1894), Religion des Veda, Hertz, Berlin, page 427-428 Thus, during this process of spiritual rebirth and diksa, the tapas observed by a Brahmachari may include silence, fasting, seclusion, chastity, as well other activities. The goal of tapas is to help focus the Brahmachari on meditation, observation of reality, reflection and spiritual rebirth. Brahmacharya and tapasya are interrelated, with the student life expected to simple and austere, dedicated to the learning.J. Gonda (1965), Change and Continuity in Indian Religion, Mouton & Co., The Hague, NetherlandsWalter O. Kaelber (May, 1976), Tapas, Birth, and Spiritual Rebirth in the Veda, History of Religions, Vol. 15, No. 4, page 362 Jainism Mahavira doing Tapas Tapas is a central concept in Jainism. It refers to the spiritual practice of body mortification, penance and austerities, in order to burn away past karma and stop producing new karma, thereby reaching siddha (liberating oneself). Ascetic Tapas among Jaina monks, both internal and external, is believed to be essential for spiritual growth and kevalya (moksha, liberation). The details of the Tapas practices vary between the different traditions within Jainism. The Jain text Sarvarthasiddhi, a commentary by Pujyapada, claims that the Hindu Samkhya school emphasizes \\"knowledge only, no practices\\", while the Vaisheshikas emphasize \\"practices only, no knowledge\\" as part of Tapas and the means of reaching moksha. Another Jain text Tattvartha Sutra, by Umaswati, in chapter 9, asserts that Tapas includes several kinds of meditation. The Tapas in Jainism include internal practices and external austerities. External Tapas include fasting, tolerating hardships inflicted by other people or animals, tolerating all discomfort from weather by nakedness or near nakedness and the lack of any possessions, lack of shelter, walking and wandering alone without fearing anything and without hurting anyone. The internal Tapas include words and inner thoughts (intent) that resonate with the external Tapas (action). The list of internal and external austerities in Jainism vary with the text and tradition, with Tattvartha Sutra, Uttaradhyayana Sutra and Bhagavati Sutra stating: *Bahya Tapas (external austerities): fasting, abstinences, restraint in begging alms, renunciation of delicacies, self-mortification, retreat from the world. *Abhyantara Tapas (internal austerities): penance, respect to elders, service to others, study, meditation, abandonment of the body in one's thoughts. In Jainism, Tapas implies a control on desires, and is a form a self purification. Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara undertook ascetic Tapas for twelve years, after which he attained Kevala Jnana (liberating supreme knowledge). Ajivikas Ajivikas was another ancient Indian religion which survived through about 13th-century CE, but became extinct thereafter, in which Tapas was a central concept as a means of salvation. According to Arthur Basham, the Ajivikas believed in the most rigorous ascetic practices in public. They believed in not harming anything and not being a cause of hurt to any living creature or substance, so they ate refuse, waste products, went deep into forests, mountains or isolated caves to live their austere life. One of the Buddhist canonical texts, Nanguttha Jataka, claims that the Ajivikas perform severe ascetic practices as part of their Tapas, including sleeping on a bed of thorns and other forms of self-mortification. The Jainism text Sthananga Sutra claims that the Ajivikas performed severe penances and self- mortification as part of their Tapas practice. A mention of the ascetic practices of Ajivikas is found in Chinese and Japanese Buddhist literature, where they are spelled as Ashibikas. Ajivikas were a ≈örama·πáa religion, just like Buddhism and Jainism, and these competed with each other. Most of the Ajivika texts have not survived. The Tapas practices of Ajivikas, as well as other information about them is primarily from the Buddhist and Jain texts; scholars question whether the description of Ajivikas has been fairly and completely summarized in these, or are these polemic misrepresentations.Paul Dundas (2002), The Jains (The Library of Religious Beliefs and Practices), Routledge, , pages 28-30 Modern practice Modern practitioners pursue Tapas - meditation and study of religion in ashrams across India.

He won renown in the Hundred Years' War, fighting in many engagements, including the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. He was an English envoy at the Council of Constance in 1415. In 1417 he was made admiral of the fleet. On the death of Henry V he was an executor of Henry's will and a member of Protector Gloucester's council. He attended the conference at Arras in 1435, and was a Member of the House of Lords sitting as Baron Hungerford from January 1436 until his death in 1449. From 1426 to 1432, he served as Lord High Treasurer. Hungerford's tenure as Treasurer occurred during the Great Bullion Famine and the beginning of the Great Slump in England. Origins He was the only surviving son and heir of Sir Thomas Hungerford (died 1398) of Farleigh Castle in Wiltshire, the first person to be recorded in the rolls of the Parliament of England as holding the office of Speaker of the House of Commons.Journal of the House of Commons: January 1559 at British History Online His mother was his father's second wife, Joan Hussey (died 1412), daughter and heiress of Sir Edmund Hussey of Holbrook. Career His father had been strongly attached to the Lancastrian cause at the close of the reign of King Richard II (1377‚Äì1399), having been steward in the household of John of Gaunt. On the accession of King Henry IV in 1399, Walter was knighted and was granted an annuity of ¬£40 out of the lands of Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk. He served as Member of Parliament for Wiltshire in October 1400, in 1404, 1407, 1413, and in January 1413‚Äì14, and served as Member of Parliament for Somerset in 1409. He served as Speaker of the House of Commons from 29 January 1413/14, the last parliament in which he served as an MP. cites: Manning, Lives of the Speakers, p. 55. He was appointed Sheriff of Wiltshire for 1405, during which term he pronounced his own selection as MP for Wiltshire, and as Sheriff of Somerset and Dorset for 1414. Hungerford won renown as a warrior. In 1401 he was with the English army in France, and is said to have defeated the French king in a duel outside Calais. He distinguished himself in battle and tournament, and received substantial rewards. In consideration of his services he was granted in 1403 one hundred marks per annum, payable by the town and castle of Marlborough in Wiltshire, and was appointed Sheriff of Wiltshire. On 22 July 1414 he was nominated ambassador to treat for a league with Sigismund, King of the Romans, cites: Rymer, F≈ìdera, vol. iv. pt. ii. p. 186 and as the English envoy attended the Council of Constance in 1414‚Äì15. cites: cf. his accounts of expenses in Brit. Mus. Addit. MS. 24513, f. 68. In the autumn of 1415, with twenty men-at-arms and sixty horse archers, Hungerford accompanied King Henry V to France. cites: Nicolas, Agincourt, p. 381 He can probably be identified correctly as the officer who on the eve of the Battle of Agincourt expressed regret that the English had not ten thousand archers, which drew a famous rebuke from the king. In Shakespeare's Henry V, however, this officer is the Earl of Westmoreland. cites: Nicolas, Agincourt pp. 105, 241. He fought bravely at the Battle of Agincourt, but the legend that he took Charles, Duke of Orl√©ans prisoner is not substantiated. He was employed in May 1416 in diplomatic negotiations with ambassadors of Theodoric, Archbishop of Cologne cites: Rymer, F≈ìdera, vol. iv. pt. ii. p. 158. and in November 1417 with envoys from France. cites: Rymer, F≈ìdera, vol. iv. pt. ii. p. 25. In 1417 he was made Admiral of the Fleet under John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, and in 1418 was with King Henry V at the Siege of Rouen. In November 1418 he was designated Steward of the King's Household, cites: Rymer, F≈ìdera, vol. iv. pt. iii. p. 76. and was granted the barony of Hommet in Normandy (today Le Hommet). He took part in the peace negotiations of 1419 and on 3 May 1421 was installed as a Knight of the Garter. cites: Beltz, Hist. of Garter, p. clviii. Hungerford was an executor of the will of King Henry V, and in 1422 became a member of the council of the Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, the Lord Protector. In 1424 he was made Steward of the Household of the infant King Henry VI, and on 7 January 1425/6 was summoned by writ to Parliament as Baron Hungerford. The summons was continued to him until his death. Hungerford became Treasurer of England in succession to Bishop Stafford, when Bishop Beaufort's resignation of the Great Seal in March 1426-7 placed Gloucester in supreme power. He acted as Carver at Henry VI's coronation in Paris in December 1430, cites: Waurin, Chron., Rolls Ser.,iv. 11 but on the change of ministry which followed Henry VI's return from France in February 1431‚Äì2, he ceased to be Treasurer. He attended the conference at Arras in 1435. cites: Wars of Henry VI in France, Rolls Ser., ed. Stevenson, ii. 431.

Eleanor Berkeley was a widow successively of John FitzAlan, 13th Earl of Arundel (died 1421) and of Sir Richard Poynings (died 1429)). Walter Hungerford and Eleanor de Berkeley were without progeny. Death and burial Hungerford died on 9 August 1449 and was buried beside his first wife in Salisbury Cathedral, where two beautiful mortuary chapels erected by the Hungerford family stood until removed and destroyed by the restorations of James Wyatt in 1790. William Hamilton Rogers (1877) wrote as follows concerning the monument: :\\"He was buried with his wife in the Hungerford Chapel in the nave, a beautiful structure composed chiefly of iron and which has since been removed to the choir. Their tombs, joined together and despoiled of their brass effigies, remain in the nave. The matrices exhibit the proportions of a knight on the one and of a lady on the other, both stones were powdered over with sickles and a ledger line outside all. The whole has now disappeared, except the stones in which the brasses were set. Forty shields of arms, according to Hutchins (who minutely describes these chapels previous to their removal) were set round outside exhibiting the various alliances of the family. Among these were Hungerford impaling Strange and Mohun, Peverell, Courtenay, St John, Mules, etc\\". Benefactions By his marriages and royal grants Hungerford added largely to the family estates. He built chantries at Heytesbury and Chippenham, and made bequests to Salisbury Cathedral and to Bath Cathedral. In 1428 he presented valuable estates to the Royal Chapel in the Palace of Westminster. cites: Jackson, Anc. Statutes of Heytesbury Almshouses, Devizes, 1863. He founded an almshouse in 1442 at Heytesbury for twelve poor men and one woman, with a schoolmaster's residence; after being re-endowed by Margaret de Botreaux, widow of his son Robert, and then rebuilt in 1769 after a fire, the charity continues today as the Hospital of St John. In his will he left to his daughter-in-law, Margaret de Botreaux (wife of Sir Robert Hungerford, 2nd Baron), his \\"best legend of the Lives of the Saints\\" and to John, Viscount Beaumont he bequeathed a cup formerly used by John of Gaunt. cites Nicholas Harris Nicolas's Testamenta Vetusta, pp. 257‚Äì9 In 1407 Hungerford donated the advowson of the church at his manor of Rushall in Wiltshire to the canons of Longleat Priory, who were struggling to support themselves financially.

It is also made in northern Italy, especially in the valleys of Trentino, where it became traditional in Valsugana. A mixture of various kinds of fruit, high- strength rum (commonly Austrian Stroh) and sugar is filled into a large stoneware pot (the eponymous rum pot). The pots themselves are often made specifically for the creation of rumtopf and can be quite elaborate in their decoration. The mixture is then matured for several months until the fruit is very soft and completely saturated with rum. Suitable fruit includes berries, cherries, plums and apricots. Not all fruits are appropriate for Rumtopf, and the overproof rum should be of only 100-110 proof (50-55% alcohol by volume), which is not commonly available at retail in all regions, but can be prepared by blending commercially available 151 or 160 proof rums with more common 80 proof brands. Traditionally, the pot is set up in a cool and dark place in spring, and different kinds of ripe fruit are added to it over the months as they come into season. Different fruits are typically added at different times. The end product is fully preserved to be eaten in winter, after the Rumtopf has matured. Rumtopf is traditionally eaten as a compote and served as a topping on poundcake, waffles, and Bratapfel (baked apples), and is also served over ice cream. Once immensely popular to be made at home, Rumtopf had somewhat fallen out of fashion by 2004 because of the time and commitment needed to make the dessert.

Early life Clements's father, Harry, was an osteopath. His mother, Sonia Edleman, was an American who had both Russian and Jewish forebears. Richard was their second son. His family were left-wing in their politics. His American uncle lobbied Congress on behalf of a trade union, his mother was a Tolstoyan anarchist and follower of Peter Kropotkin,Ian Aitken \\"The Ralph Miliband I Knew Embodied the British Values the Daily Mail Rejects\\", The Guardian, 3 October 2013 and his father was a pacifist who had been imprisoned as a conscientious objector during the First World War. Clements was educated at King Alfred School, Hampstead, until the outbreak of the Second World War. His parents then sent him to live with his uncle in the United States, where he was enrolled at Western High School in Washington, DC. On his return to London he studied briefly at either the London School of Economics or the Regent Street Polytechnic. He completed his National Service in the Merchant Navy, as an apprentice, choosing that instead of carrying a gun. Career=Journalism Clements began his career in journalism in 1949 when he joined the Middlesex Independent newspaper. In 1951 he moved to the Leicester Mercury. It was during this time period that he became friends with one of the local MPs, Herbert Bowden, who would later become chairman of ITV. In 1953 he became editor of Socialist Advance, the Labour Party's youth paper. Clements worked briefly for the Daily Herald before joining Tribune in 1956 as a reporter. There Clements gained experience in a number of areas in addition to straight reporting including page layout and copy editing. He was also involved in organising the Tribune rallies at Labour party conferences. In 1959 his book, Glory Without Power, an examination of trade unions, was published. According to Michael Foot, Clements suggested Tribune adopt the slogan \\"The paper that leads the anti-H bomb campaign\\" in its masthead (a newspaper feature known internationally as a nameplate); Nye Bevan regarded this as \\"a calculated affront to himself\\", Clements having previously leaked the details of heated discussions involving Bevan, Jennie Lee (Bevan's wife) and Foot over which political position the Labour party should take regarding the nuclear bomb. Clements became editor of the Tribune in 1961, aged 33. Clements was known for being less than reverent in his reporting of disputes between the various organisations on the left and far-left of the movement. He would, however, publish pieces on party policy written from viewpoints with which he did not personally agree a fact which Tam Dalyell said had impressed him. Clements proved an adept fundraiser for the Tribune, a magazine that is perpetually short of money. The Times obituary says of him, \\"people liked him and would do things for him either for a pittance or free of charge\\". He also sought funding from a mixture of trades unions and advertising. To keep running costs low he wrote much of the magazine himself. He also accepted submissions from freelance writers, very few of whom were paid for their work but instead donated it for the cause. It was during Clements' editorship of the Tribune that he first met the newly elected MP for Bedwellty, Neil Kinnock. The Kinnocks and the Clements became friends, with the Clements guiding the younger Kinnocks. Five years later, in 1975, Clements chose Kinnock to give the speech at the Tribune rally appealing for funds. This was to prove an important moment in Kinnock's political career. Post- journalism Clements left the Tribune in 1982 and became office manager for Michael Foot, the leader of the Labour Party. Foot's predecessor, James Callaghan, had offered Clements the chance to stand for Labour in a safe seat in East London in the 1979 general election. Clements had declined the offer, insisting on a selection ballot, which he lost narrowly. After Foot's resignation following Labour's landslide defeat in the 1983 general election, Clements continued in a similar role for the new leader, Neil Kinnock, although his title was officially that of \\"executive officer\\". It was said of Clements that he was \\"Kinnock's closest ally and a shaper of Labour's strategies\\". He retired from the position in 1987, although Geoffrey Goodman has speculated that he might have agreed to become \\"Kinnock's Alastair Campbell\\" had Labour won the 1992 general election. His final job was director of the Citizen's Income Trust, a registered charity which focuses on the concept of a citizen's income in the context of the British political system. Allegations of spying In 1999, he was named by the Sunday Times as a Soviet \\"agent-of-influence\\". Basing its story on documents from the Mitrokhin Archive, the paper alleged that Moscow regarded Clements, operating under the code-name of \\"Dan\\", as \\"its most reliable propaganda tool in Britain\\". Documents from the archive purportedly show that the KGB provided Clements with text which he then published in the Tribune and that he also published articles based on information supplied by a Russian organisation known as \\"Service A\\". Although Clements acknowledged meeting Russian officials, he denied being a spy, pointing to the large number of anti-Soviet articles published by Tribune under his editorship. He said that claims he was a spy was \\"an over-inflated claim\\". In his opinion, \\"They may have thought they were controlling me, but they were not. I suspect they exaggerated their reports to Moscow. Perhaps they were boosting their expenses.\\" Tam Dalyell wrote \\"Anyone less likely, then, than Dick Clements to allow himself to become [a KGB agent] is hard to imagine.\\" Personal life Clements was married to Bridget MacDonald, a great-niece of Ramsay MacDonald. They had two sons, Robert and Nicholas. In his final years he suffered from Parkinson's disease. He died in Barnet.

A popular trail passes over its summit (elevation ), accessible from four different trailheads to the north, south, and east. It is often referred to by locals as Ben Lomond Peak, Mt. Ben Lomond, and Ben Lomond Mountain. The usage Mount Ben Lomond is technically a redundancy as the prefix Ben, which is found in front of many Scottish mountains including Ben Lomond after which this mountain was named, actually means mount - Scottish mountains whose name begins Ben are never preceded by Mount. The USGS has it labeled as Ben Lomond on maps. Ben Lomond stands out along the Wasatch Front because the mountain range appears to run east and west along the Wasatch Range, while most mountains appear to run south and north. Two miles northwest of Ben Lomond is Willard Peak, with an elevation of . Northwest of Willard Peak is Inspiration Point. A dirt road travels from Mantua, Utah to Inspiration Point. The road is usually not passable until July due to deep snow that resists melting due to the area's northern exposure. Atop Inspiration Point on a clear day, one can see Salt Lake City to the south, Willard Bay and the Great Salt Lake to the west, and the city of Logan, Utah to the northeast. From Inspiration Peak one can hike or bike to the summit of Ben Lomond, and then continue east to a trailhead on North Ogden Pass. The trail is listed as one of the top mountain bike rides in Utah. The distance from the North Ogden trailhead to the summit of Ben Lomond is approximately . Ben Lomond was named after the mountain Ben Lomond in the Scottish Highlands. Mary Wilson Montgomery, an early settler, thought the mountain range resembled the Munro. According to some sources, the Paramount Pictures logo, known as Majestic Mountain, was modeled after Ben Lomond. It is said that William W. Hodkinson, the founder of Paramount and a native of the Ogden area, initially drew the image on a napkin during a meeting in 1914.

They typically scan the volume two to four times a minute. The waves are usually less than a meter long. Ships and planes are metal, and reflect radio waves. The radar measures the distance to the reflector by measuring the time of the roundtrip from emission of a pulse to reception, dividing this by two, and then multiplying by the speed of light. To be accepted, the received pulse has to lie within a period of time called the range gate. The radar determines the direction because the short radio waves behave like a search light when emitted from the reflector of the radar set's antenna.

The fuzes used in anti-aircraft artillery have to be mechanically designed to accept fifty thousand g, yet still be cheap enough to throw away.  Weather-sensing radar systems  Weather radars can resemble search radars. This radar uses radio waves along with horizontal, dual (horizontal and vertical), or circular polarization. The frequency selection of weather radar is a performance compromise between precipitation reflectivity and attenuation due to atmospheric water vapor. Some weather radars uses doppler shift to measure wind speeds and dual-polarization for identification of types of precipitations. *Weather radar *Wind profilers * Millimetre cloud radar *CODAR Image:Sturmfront auf Doppler-Radar-Schirm.jpgStorm front reflectivities on a weather radar screen (NOAA) Image:Wind_Profiler.jpgWind profiling radar  Navigational radars  Surface search radar display commonly found on ships Navigational radars resemble search radar, but use very short waves that reflect from earth and stone. They are common on commercial ships and long- distance commercial aircraft. Marine radars are used by ships for collision avoidance and navigation purposes. The frequency band of radar used on most ships is x-band (9 GHz/3 cm), but s-band (3 GHz/10 cm) radar is also installed on most oceangoing ships to provide better detection of ships in rough sea and heavy rain condition. Vessel traffic services also use marine radars (x or s band) for tracking ARPA and provides collision avoidance or traffic regulation of ships in the survallence area. General purpose radars are increasingly being substituted for pure navigational radars. These generally use navigational radar frequencies, but modulate the pulse so the receiver can determine the type of surface of the reflector. The best general-purpose radars distinguish the rain of heavy storms, as well as land and vehicles. Some can superimpose sonar and map data from GPS position. Air Traffic Control and navigation Air traffic control uses primary and secondary radars. Primary radars are a \\"classical\\" radar which reflects all kind of echoes, including aircraft and clouds. Secondary radar emits pulses and listens for special answer of digital data emitted by an Aircraft Transponder as an answer. Transponders emit different kind of data like a 4 octal ID (mode A), the onboard calculated altitude (mode C) or the Callsign (not the flight number) (mode S). Military use transponders to establish the nationality and intention of an aircraft, so that air defenses can identify possibly hostile radar returns. This military system is called IFF (Identification Friend or Foe).

They generally use synthetic aperture radar, which limits them to relatively static targets, normally terrain. Specific radar systems can sense a human behind walls. This is possible since the reflective characteristics of humans are generally more diverse than those of the materials typically used in construction. However, since humans reflect far less radar energy than metal does, these systems require sophisticated technology to isolate human targets and moreover to process any sort of detailed image.

An object's surface brightness depends on its surface luminosity density, i.e., its luminosity emitted per unit surface area. In visible and infrared astronomy, surface brightness is often quoted on a magnitude scale, in magnitudes per square arcsecond in a particular filter band or photometric system. Measurement of the surface brightnesses of celestial objects is called surface photometry. General description The total magnitude is a measure of the brightness of an extended object such as a nebula, cluster, galaxy or comet. It can be obtained by summing up the luminosity over the area of the object. Alternatively, a photometer can be used by applying apertures or slits of different sizes of diameter. The background light is then subtracted from the measurement to obtain the total brightness. The resulting magnitude value is the same as a point-like source that is emitting the same amount of energy. The apparent magnitude of an astronomical object is generally given as an integrated value‚Äîif a galaxy is quoted as having a magnitude of 12.5, it means we see the same total amount of light from the galaxy as we would from a star with magnitude 12.5. However, a star is so small it is effectively a point source in most observations (the largest angular diameter, that of R Doradus, is 0.057 ¬± 0.005 arcsec), whereas a galaxy may extend over several arcseconds or arcminutes. Therefore, the galaxy will be harder to see than the star against the airglow background light. Apparent magnitude is a good indication of visibility if the object is point-like or small, whereas surface brightness is a better indicator if the object is large. What counts as small or large depends on the specific viewing conditions and follows from Ricco's law. In general, in order to adequately assess an object's visibility one needs to know both parameters. Calculating surface brightness Surface brightnesses are usually quoted in magnitudes per square arcsecond. Because the magnitude is logarithmic, calculating surface brightness cannot be done by simple division of magnitude by area. Instead, for a source with a total or integrated magnitude m extending over a visual area of A square arcseconds, the surface brightness S is given by S = m + 2.5 \\\\cdot \\\\log_{10} A. For astronomical objects, surface brightness is analogous to photometric luminance and is therefore constant with distance: as an object becomes fainter with distance, it also becomes correspondingly smaller in visual area. In geometrical terms, for a nearby object emitting a given amount of light, radiative flux decreases with the square of the distance to the object, but the physical area corresponding to a given solid angle or visual area (e.g. 1 square arcsecond) decreases by the same proportion, resulting in the same surface brightness. For extended objects such as nebulae or galaxies, this allows the estimation of spatial distance from surface brightness by means of the distance modulus or luminosity distance. Relationship to physical units The surface brightness in magnitude units is related to the surface brightness in physical units of solar luminosity per square parsec by S({\\\\rm mag}/{\\\\rm arcsec}^2)=M_{\\\\odot}+21.572-2.5\\\\log_{10} S (L_{\\\\odot}/{\\\\rm pc}^2), where M_{\\\\odot} and L_{\\\\odot} are the absolute magnitude and the luminosity of the Sun in chosen color-bandAbsolute magnitudes of the Sun in different color-bands can be obtained from or Absolute Magnitude of the Sun in Several Bands respectively. Surface brightness can also be expressed in candela per square metre using the formula [value in cd/m2] = 10.8√ó104 √ó 10(-0.4*[value in mag/arcsec2]).

He is known mostly for his contributions toward the decipherment of cuneiform. Georg Friedrich Grotefend had a son, named Carl Ludwig Grotefend, who played a key role in the decipherment of the Indian Kharoshthi script on the coinage of the Indo-Greek kings, around the same time as James Prinsep, publishing Die unbekannte Schrift der Baktrischen M√ºnzen (\\"The unknown script of the Bactrian coins\\") in 1836. Life Native house of Grotenfend in Hann. M√ºnden. Medal Georg Friedrich Grotefend 1848 He was born at Hann. M√ºnden and died in Hanover. He was educated partly in his native town, partly at Ilfeld, where he remained till 1795, when he entered the University of G√∂ttingen, and there became the friend of Heyne, Tychsen and Heeren. Heyne's recommendation procured for him an assistant mastership in the G√∂ttingen gymnasium in 1797. While there he published his work De pasigraphia sive scriptura universali (1799), which led to his appointment in 1803 as prorector of the gymnasium of Frankfurt, and shortly afterwards as conrector. In 1821 he became director of the gymnasium at Hanover, a post which he retained till his retirement in 1849. One year before retiring he received a medal commemorating his 50th anniversary of working at the gymnasium at Hanover. This medal made by the local engraver Heinrich Friedrich Brehmer links Grotefends jubilee with the 500th anniversary of the school he taught at. Both occasions were celebrated on 2nd of February 1848.http://hdl.handle.net/10900/100742 S. Krmnicek und M. Gaidys, Gelehrtenbilder. Altertumswissenschaftler auf Medaillen des 19. Jahrhunderts.

Neue Serie Bd. 3 (T√ºbingen 2020), 82f. Work=Philology Grotefend was best known during his lifetime as a Latin and Italian philologist, though the attention he paid to his own language is shown by his Anfangsgr√ºnde der deutschen Poesie, published in 1815, and his foundation of a society for investigating the German tongue in 1817. In 1823/1824 he published his revised edition of Helfrich Bernhard Wenck's Latin grammar, in two volumes, followed by a smaller grammar for the use of schools in 1826; in 1835‚Äì1838 a systematic attempt to explain the fragmentary remains of the Umbrian dialect, entitled Rudimenta linguae Umbricae ex inscriptionibus antiquis enodata (in eight parts); and in 1839 a work of similar character upon Oscan (Rudimenta linguae Oscae). In the same year his son Carl Ludwig Grotefend published a memoir on the coins of Bactria, under the name of Die M√ºnzen der griechischen, parthischen und indoskythischen K√∂nige von Baktrien und den L√§ndern am Indus. He soon, however, returned to his favourite subject, and brought out a work in five parts, Zur Geographie und Geschichte von Alt- Italien (1840‚Äì1842). Previously, in 1836, he had written a preface to Friedrich Wagenfeld's translation of the Sanchoniathon of Philo of Byblos, which was alleged to have been discovered in the preceding year in the Portuguese convent of Santa Maria de Merinh√£o. Old Persian cuneiform But it was in the East rather than in the West that Grotefend did his greatest work. The Old Persian cuneiform inscriptions of Persia had for some time been attracting attention in Europe; exact copies of them had been published by Jean Chardin in 1711,Kent, R. G.: \\"Old Persian: Grammar Texts Lexicon\\", page 9. American Oriental Society, 1950. the Dutch artist Cornelis de Bruijn and the German traveller Niebuhr, who lost his eyesight over the work; and Grotefend's friend, Tychsen of Rostock, believed that he had ascertained the characters in the column, now known to be Persian, to be alphabetic. At this point Grotefend took the matter up. Having a taste for puzzles, he made a bet with drinking friends around 1800 that he could decipher at least part of the Persepolis inscriptions. His first discovery was communicated to the Royal Society of G√∂ttingen in 1802,Sayce, Rev. A. H., Professor of Assyriology, Oxford, \\"The Archaeology of the Cuneiform Inscriptions\\", Second Edition- revised, 1908, Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, London, Brighton, New York; at pages 10-13 Not in copyright but his findings were dismissed by these academics. His work was denied official publication, but Tychsen published a review of Grotefend's work in the literary gazette of G√∂ttingen in September 1802, which presented the argument made by Grotenfend. In 1815, Grotefend was only able to give an account of his theories in the work of his friend Heeren on ancient history.See: * Grotefend, G. F., \\"Ueber die Erkl√§rung der Keilschriften, und besonders der Inschriften von Persepolis\\" [On the explanation of cuneiform, and especially of the inscriptions of Persepolis] in: Heeren, Arnold Hermann Ludwig, Ideen √ºber die Politik, den Verkehr und den Handel der vornehmsten V√∂lker der alten Welt [Ideas about the politics, commerce, and trade of the most distinguished peoples of the ancient world], part 1, section 1, (G√∂ttingen, (Germany): Bandelhoel und Ruprecht, 1815), 563‚Äì609.

Talboys, 1833), pp. 313‚Äì360. Grotefend's determinations of the values of several characters in cuneiform are also briefly mentioned in vol. 1, p. 196. His article appeared as an appendix in Heeren's book on historical research and was entitled \\"On the Interpretation of the Arrow-headed Characters, particularly of the Inscriptions at Persepolis\\". =Decipherment method= Grotefend had focused on two inscriptions from Persepolis, called the \\"Niebuhr inscriptions\\", which seemed to have broadly similar content except for the name of the rulers. File:Niebuhr inscription 1.jpgNiebuhr inscription 1. Now known to mean \\"Darius the Great King, King of Kings, King of countries, son of Hystaspes, an Achaemenian, who built this Palace\\". File:Niebuhr inscription 2.jpgNiebuhr inscription 2: Now known to mean \\"Xerxes the Great King, King of Kings, son of Darius the King, an Achaemenian\\". Hypothesis for the sentence structure of Persepolitan inscriptions, by Grotefend (1815). In 1802, Friedrich M√ºnter had realized that recurring groups of characters must be the word for ‚Äúking‚Äù (, now known to be pronounced x≈°ƒÅyaœëiya). He also understood from M√ºnter that each word was separated from the next by a slash sign (). Grotefend extended this work by realizing, based on the known inscriptions of much later rulers (the Pahlavi inscriptions of the Sassanid kings), that a king's name is often followed by ‚Äúgreat king, king of kings‚Äù and the name of the king's father.Kent, R. G.: \\"Old Persian: Grammar Texts Lexicon\\", page 10. American Oriental Society, 1950. This understanding of the structure of monumental inscriptions in Old Persian was based on the work of Anquetil-Duperron, who had studied Old Persian through the Zoroastrian Avestas in India, and Antoine Isaac Silvestre de Sacy, who had decrypted the monumental Pahlavi inscriptions of the Sassanid kings. File:Niebuhr inscription 1 with word for King.jpgthumbNiebuhr inscription 1, with the words \\"King\\" () highlighted. File:Niebuhr inscription 2 with word for King.jpgNiebuhr inscription 2, with the words \\"King\\" highlighted. Achaemenian\\". Old Persian alphabet, and proposed transcription of the Xerxes inscription, according to Grotefend. Initially published in 1815. Grotefend only identified correctly eight letters among the thirty signs he had collated. Looking at similarities in character sequences, he made the hypothesis that the father of the ruler in one inscription would possibly appear as the first name in the other inscription: the first word in Niebuhr 1 () indeed corresponded to the 6th word in Niebuhr 2. Looking at the length of the character sequences, and comparing with the names and genealogy of the Achaemenid kings as known from the Greeks, also taking into account the fact that the father of one of the rulers in the inscriptions didn't have the attribute \\"king\\", he made the correct guess that this could be no other than Darius the Great, his father Hystapes who was not a king, and his son the famous Xerxes. In Persian history around the time period the inscriptions were expected to be made, there were only two instances where a ruler came to power without being a previous king's son. They were Darius the Great and Cyrus the Great, both of whom became emperor by revolt. The deciding factors between these two choices were the names of their fathers and sons. Darius's father was Hystaspes and his son was Xerxes, while Cyrus' father was Cambyses I and his son was Cambyses II. Within the text, the father and son of the king had different groups of symbols for names so Grotefend assumed that the king must have been Darius. These connections allowed Grotefend to figure out the cuneiform characters that are part of Darius, Darius's father Hystaspes, and Darius's son Xerxes. He equated the letters with the name d-a-r-h-e-u-sh for Darius, as known from the Greeks. This identification was correct, although the actual Persian spelling was da- a-ra-ya-va-u-sha, but this was unknown at the time. Grotefend similarly equated the sequence with kh-sh-h-e-r-sh-e for Xerxes, which again was right, but the actual Old Persian transcription was wsa-sha-ya-a-ra-sha-a. Finally, he matched the sequence of the father who was not a king with Hystaspes, but again with the supposed Persian reading of g-o-sh-t-a-s-p, rather than the actual Old Persian vi-i-sha-ta-a-sa-pa. By this method, Grotefend had correctly identified each king in the inscriptions, but his identification of the value of individual letters was still quite defective, for want of a better understanding of the Old Persian language itself. Grotefend only identified correctly eight letters among the thirty signs he had collated. However groundbreaking, this inductive method failed to convince academics, and the official recognition of his work was denied for nearly a generation. =Vindication= The quadrilingual \\"Caylus vase\\" in the name of Xerxes I confirmed the decipherment of Grotefend once Champollion was able to read Egyptian hieroglyphs.Pages 10-14, note 1 on page 13 It was only in 1823 that Grotefend's discovery was confirmed, when the French archaeologist Champollion, who had just deciphered Egyptian hieroglyphs, was able to read the Egytian dedication of a quadrilingual hieroglyph-cuneiform inscription on an alabaster vase in the Cabinet des M√©dailles, the \\"Caylus vase\\". The Egyptian inscription on the vase was in the name of King Xerxes I, and Champollion, together with the orientalist Antoine-Jean Saint-Martin, was able to confirm that the corresponding words in the cuneiform script were indeed the words which Grotefend had identified as meaning \\"king\\" and \\"Xerxes\\" through guesswork.Pages 10-14, note 1 on page 13 The findings were published by Saint-Martin in Extrait d'un m√©moire relatif aux antiques inscriptions de Pers√©polis lu √† l'Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, thereby vindicating the pionnering work of Grotefend.In Journal asiatique II, 1823, PI. II, pp. 65‚Äî90 =Later publications= In 1837 Grotefend published his Neue Beitr√§ge zur Erl√§uterung der persepolitanischen Keilschrift. Three years later appeared his Neue Beitr√§ge zur Erl√§uterung der babylonischen Keilschrift. His discovery may be summed up as follows: #that the Persian inscriptions contain three different forms of cuneiform writing, so that the decipherment of the one would give the key to the decipherment of the others #that the characters of the Persian column are alphabetic and not syllabic #confirmed Niebuhr's observation that they must be read from left to right #that the alphabet consists of forty letters, including signs for long and short vowels #that the Persepolitan inscriptions are written in Zend (which, however, is not the case), and must be ascribed to the age of the Achaemenian princes #that a specific frequent word could refer to the Persian word for \\"king\\" #that the inscriptions satisfy the two following schemes: A) X king, great king of king, son of Y king; B) Y king, great king of king, son of Z; #that the presence of the two schemes A) and B) gives an opportunity to identify the people involved; it is necessary that X was a Persian king, his father was a Persian king too, but his grandfather was not king #according to this idea Grotefend was able to identify X for Xerxes, Y for Darius and Z with Hystaspes. A basis had now been laid for the interpretation of the Persian inscriptions. However, lacking knowledge of old Persian, Grotefend misconstrued several important characters. Significant work remained to be done to complete the decipherment.Maurice Pope: \\"The Story of Decipherment\\", Thames and Hudson Ltd., London, 1975 and 1999, pp. 101-103.

The company was formed in 1997 as a joint venture between British Telecommunications (BT) and Nederlandse Spoorwegen (Dutch Railways). In 2000, BT acquired the company. The group became part of the BT Wireless business and after its spin-off as mmO2, became known as O2 Netherlands. However, in 2003, O2 sold the company to Greenfield Capital Partners. It then reverted to the Telfort name. In July 2005 Telfort was sold to telephone company KPN. In October 2007, KPN, which had bought the Dutch operations of Tiscali some months earlier, rebranded Tiscali's Internet services as Telfort Internet. It has, since then, expanded its operations to include fixed phone lines and digital television (IPTV) subscriptions. In 2018, Telfort ceased to exist as a separate legal entity (Telfort B.V.) and became a brand name of KPN.

When this greatly accelerated matter in the beam approaches the speed of light, astrophysical jets become relativistic jets as they show effects from special relativity. The formation and powering of astrophysical jets are highly complex phenomena that are associated with many types of high-energy astronomical sources. They likely arise from dynamic interactions within accretion disks, whose active processes are commonly connected with compact central objects such as black holes, neutron stars or pulsars. One explanation is that tangled magnetic fields are organised to aim two diametrically opposing beams away from the central source by angles only several degrees wide Jets may also be influenced by a general relativity effect known as frame-dragging. Most of the largest and most active jets are created by supermassive black holes (SMBH) in the centre of active galaxies such as quasars and radio galaxies or within galaxy clusters. Such jets can exceed millions of parsecs in length. Other astronomical objects that contain jets include cataclysmic variable stars, X-ray binaries and gamma-ray bursts (GRB). Others are associated with star forming regions including T Tauri stars and Herbig‚ÄìHaro objects, which are caused by the interaction of jets with the interstellar medium. Bipolar outflows or jets may also be associated with protostars, or with evolved post-AGB stars, planetary nebulae and bipolar nebulae. Relativistic jets AGN where the relativistic plasma is collimated into jets which escape along the pole(s) of the supermassive black hole. Relativistic jets are beams of ionised matter accelerated close to the speed of light. Most have been observationally associated with central black holes of some active galaxies, radio galaxies or quasars, and also by galactic stellar black holes, neutron stars or pulsars. Beam lengths may extend between several thousand, hundreds of thousands or millions of parsecs. Jet velocities when approaching the speed of light show significant effects of the special theory of relativity; for example, relativistic beaming that changes the apparent beam brightness. Elliptical galaxy M87 emitting a relativistic jet, as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope Massive central black holes in galaxies have the most powerful jets, but their structure and behaviours are similar to those of smaller galactic neutron stars and black holes. These SMBH systems are often called microquasars and show a large range of velocities. SS433 jet, for example, has a velocity of 0.23c. Relativistic jet formation may also explain observed gamma-ray bursts. Notably, even weaker and less relativistic jets may be associated with many binary systems. Even solar jets occur, in great abundance, and appear to have a strictly electromagnetic nature as regards energy source and collimation. Mechanisms behind the composition of jets remain uncertain, though some studies favour models where jets are composed of an electrically neutral mixture of nuclei, electrons, and positrons, while others are consistent with jets composed of positron‚Äìelectron plasma. Electron‚Äìpositron Jets Associated with Quasar 3C 279 Trace nuclei swept up in a relativistic positron‚Äìelectron jet would be expected to have extremely high energy, as these heavier nuclei should attain velocity equal to the positron and electron velocity. Rotation as possible energy source Because of the enormous amount of energy needed to launch a relativistic jet, some jets are possibly powered by spinning black holes. However, the frequency of high-energy astrophysical sources with jets suggest combinations of different mechanisms indirectly identified with the energy within the associated accretion disk and X-ray emissions from the generating source. Two early theories have been used to explain how energy can be transferred from a black hole into an astrophysical jet: * Blandford‚ÄìZnajek process. This theory explains the extraction of energy from magnetic fields around an accretion disk, which are dragged and twisted by the spin of the black hole. Relativistic material is then feasibly launched by the tightening of the field lines. * Penrose mechanism. Reprinted in: Here energy is extracted from a rotating black hole by frame dragging, which was later theoretically proven to be able to extract relativistic particle energy and momentum, and subsequently shown to be a possible mechanism for jet formation. This effect may also be explained in terms of Gravitoelectromagnetism. Relativistic jets from neutron stars The pulsar IGR J11014-6103 with supernova remnant origin, nebula and jet Jets may also be observed from spinning neutron stars. An example is pulsar IGR J11014-6103, which has the largest jet so far observed in the Milky Way Galaxy, and whose velocity is estimated at 80% the speed of light (0.8c). X-ray observations have been obtained but there is no detected radio signature nor accretion disk. Initially, this pulsar was presumed to be rapidly spinning but later measurements indicate the spin rate is only 15.9 Hz. Long helical jet of Lighthouse nebula page 7 Such a slow spin rate and lack of accretion material suggest the jet is neither rotation nor accretion powered, though it appears aligned with the pulsar rotation axis and perpendicular to the pulsar's true motion.

The few details of Henry's life that are known originated from his own works and from a number of official records. He was brought up in the wealthy court of Robert Bloet of Lincoln, who became his patron. At the request of Bloet's successor, Alexander of Lincoln, Henry began to write his Historia Anglorum, first published around 1129, an account of the history of England from its beginnings up to the year 1154. Life Henry was born in about 1088 and died about 1157. He succeeded his father Nicholas as archdeacon Diocese of Lincoln in 1110. No personal correspondence or anecdotes survived him and it seemed that no one considered him important enough to have written a memorial. His biography depends upon a few notices scattered through his own work and in a few places where he left his name in the course of his official duties. Though the identity of his mother is unknown, she was probably English, as Henry was an English native speaker. His father Nicholas, the first archdeacon of Huntingdon, was a clerk in holy orders, who had enough influence with the Bishop of Lincoln to secure the succession of his title for his son, a substantial inheritance for a man who had not yet reached thirty.Partner, pp.11‚Äì12 Nicholas was canon of Lincoln for over thirty years until his death in 1110. Henry was received as a little boy into the familia of Robert Bloet of Lincoln and grew up in luxury, living in the wealth and splendour of England's richest episcopal court. His upbringing gave him a positive outlook towards the world, but in later years he learned to feel a certain recoil distrust of contemptus mundi, \\"contempt for the world\\", a feeling which encompasses much of his mature literary work.Partner, p.12-13 Bishop Bloet's successor, Alexander of Lincoln, became sensible of Henry's aptitude for business and employed him frequently for important affairs, though it remains clear that Henry owed his promotion to the patronage of Bishop Bloet. It was at Bishop Alexander's request that Henry began to write his Historia Anglorum ('The History of The English').Historia Anglorum, Forester, p. x The formal Prologue of his History, which was addressed to Bishop Alexander, was written in a floridly dense high style that allowed him to parade himself, before retreating into dutiful obscurity behind the chroniclers he had used. It was written as an elaborate defence of the writing of history and to show off his degree of education.Partner, p. 19 Over the years, Henry's contempt for the world grew and became the informing spirit of his literary work and spiritual life. During his travels, he began to notice that people were more worried about taking care of their belongings rather than themselves. This led him to write a long poem on De contemptu visibilum.Partner, p. 40 Like his father, Henry was a married priest, though the identity of his wife is unknown. They had at least one child, a son named Adam, who became a clerk. The family lived in the village Little Stukeley. Overall, the little-known information about Henry is concrete and suggestive, hinting at a life lived just below the first ranks of property and talent in an age of personal reticence. He mentions Lanfranc as having been \\"famous in our own time\\", which places Henry's birthdate a few years before 1089, the year Lanfranc died. His Historia Anglorum leaves off in 1154, with the promise of another book for the new reign; however, since that book was never written it may be assumed that Henry died shortly afterward.Partner, p. 11 Writings=Historia Henry's most notable work is the Historia Anglorum. He was bidden by Bishop Alexander of Lincoln to write a history of England from the earliest period and bringing it to modern times, ending it upon the accession of Henry II in 1154. It was assumed that the first edition was published at the end of 1129 and the second in 1135, at the end of the reign of Henry I of England. He published new editions as the years went on, the final fifth copy coming down in 1154, supposedly to terminate the History with the death of Stephen, leaving his history organised into eight books. There is some evidence that Henry did not intend to stop there, intending to add another book to his series that would cover the events of the first five years of the reign of Henry II. It was never carried out, as Henry of Huntingdon must have been at least seventy years old by the time of the king's accession and died shortly afterwards.Huntingdon, pp. ix-xvi Henry's ear for telling detail is responsible for entertaining touches drawn from current legend and his own fertile imagination. C. Warren Hollister notes the anecdote of King Canute's failure to stem the tide by command and Henry I's ignoring his physician's orders to dine on lampreys.Hollister, p. 10 Such touches rendered his history popular ‚Äì there are twenty-five surviving manuscripts ‚Äì and they embedded his anecdotes firmly into popular history. However, as the bishop's household was with the royal court frequently, it is possible that Henry was an eyewitness for many of the anecdotes he describes. Diana Greenway points out that the details he provides about the royal family are remarkably accurate. Historia Anglorum was first printed by Sir Henry Savile in 1596 in the historical miscellany Rerum Anglicarum Scriptores post Bedam praecipui. Henry's sources included: *Bede, Historia Ecclesiastica, for the years up to 731.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: Henry *Historia Brittonum (Vatican recension). *Paul the Deacon's Historia Romana, for Roman emperors, as well as Eutropius and Aurelius Victor *The works of Saint Jerome and Gregory the Great, with which Henry had a passing familiarity. *Saints' Lives (especially Book 9). *Versions of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle similar to C and E. This included the poem on Brunanburh, which he translated into Latin. *A lost version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which he shared with John of Worcester. This version contained quite a number of detailed and valuable accounts of battles of the Saxon invasions of Britain which are only preserved in Henry's Historia. *Peter Tudebode's Historia de Hierosolymitano itinere.Runciman, Steven, A History of the Crusades, Volume One: The First Crusade and the Foundation of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, Cambridge University Press, London, 1951, pp. 330, 345 *Old English poems, which he translated into Latin. This may include the legend of King Canute and the waves, as well as material on Siward, Earl of Northumbria. *Old French songs, for Norman history. Other works As an author, Henry distinguished himself in his youth by writing poetry, comprising eight books of epigrams, eight books on love, and the so-called Anglicanus ortus, eight books on herbs, spices and gems united by a medical theme.Henry of Huntingdon. Anglicanus ortus: a Verse Herbal of the Twelfth Century, edited and translated by Winston Black. Toronto, Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, c2012, p. 7. Of these, two books of epigrams and the eight medical books survive, the latter identified only in modern times.Ibid, p. 9 The Anglicanus ortus has since been published, books 1‚Äì6 (on herbs and spices) as Anglicanus ortus: a Verse Herbal of the Twelfth Century (Toronto, Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, c2012), and books 7‚Äì8 (on gems) as \\"Henry of Huntingdon's lapidary rediscovered and his Anglicanus ortus reassembled\\" (Mediaeval Studies, v. 68, 2006, pp. 43‚Äì87), both edited by Winston Black.Ibid, pp. 8‚Äì13, 496. Henry wrote an Epistle to Henry I on the Succession of foreign kings and emperors up to their own time, and another to a man named Warin that contained an account of the ancient British kings from Brute to Cadwaller. The information for this account was obtained from a monk while Henry was at the Abbey of Bec, which held the writings of Geoffrey of Monmouth. Henry's most notable epistle was a funereal exercise addressed to his recently deceased friend and fellow archdeacon of Lincoln diocese, Walter of Leicester, titled De contemptu mundi (\\"On Contempt for the world\\"), which from internal evidence dates to 1135.Forester, pp.xi- xii Contribution to history The contribution that Henry of Huntingdon brought to history cannot solely rest with his Historia Anglorum but must also include his Epistles. All of these writings offer an insight into the minds of those who lived in the twelfth century and illuminate how historians of the time recorded history and corresponded with their peers. Henry's legacy consisted of his own contribution to the history of England and his recorded thoughts and ideas, thereby opening a valuable perspective on his era's mindset. Like many medieval writers, Henry saw the chief purpose of history as a moral lesson to teach people of both higher and lower ranks of society with instructive examples. In his prologue, he hopes that his readers will become better people from reading his History. NotesSources *Henry of Huntingdon, Historia Anglorum **ed. and tr. Diana E.

Debt levels and flows are a measure of the levels of debt ‚Äì how much debt is outstanding ‚Äì and the flows of debt ‚Äì how much the level of debt changes over time. This is basic macroeconomic data, and varies between countries. Debt is used to finance enterprises and business around the world. Within mainstream economics, levels and flows of public debt (government debt) are a cause of concern, while levels and flows of private debt (especially households and corporations) are not seen as being of central importance.  Measuring debt  In measuring debt, stocks and flows are both of interest: stocks are amounts, levels of debt (e.g., $100) and have units of currency (such as US Dollars), while flows are changes in levels ‚Äì in calculus terms, the derivative ‚Äì (e.g., $10/year), and have units of currency/time (such as US Dollars/Year). In order to make these stock and flows comparable between countries and across time, one may normalize these by some measure of the size of the country's economy, most often GDP, that is, compute the debt to GDP ratio. For instance, $10 billion in 2000 is a small amount of debt relative to the size of the economy of the United States, but large relative to the size of the economy of Iceland, and dividing by the GDP reflects this. Because GDP is generally quoted with units of currency/year, and debt levels have units of currency, the debt level/GDP ratio has units of years, which may be interpreted as \\"how many years it would take to repay the debt if all income went to debt repayment\\". In practice this cannot happen ‚Äì some of GDP must go to survival ‚Äì and historically debt repayment rates during periods of repayment have been about 4%‚Äì10% of GDP (as in the United States during the Great Depression and World War II), so practical time to repay debt is rather Debt/GDP times 10‚Äì25.  Overall levels  Debt levels are worth 3 years of GDP in many countries that have an annual GDP/person above $10,000. Worldwide debt levels are perhaps worth two or three years of GDP. GDP (at currency exchange rate) was $40 trillion during 2004. Debt levels may therefore be about $100 trillion. $5.7 trillion of gross debt was issued in 2004 according to Thomson Financial numbers, while GDP grew $4 trillion (currency exchange rate). That does not mean that net debt grew faster than GDP on a worldwide average (even if it has done so for years after 2001 in the USA), as debt issuance may be refinancing of existing debt, often \\"rolling over\\" debt that comes due into new debt. When debt matures new debt is many times issued to repay the old debt, perhaps from the same creditor. That is one reason why debt issuance far surpasses equity issuance in currency value. Debt is often issued with a repayment plan (a \\"time to maturity\\" in some cases), repayment times may be between a few days (interbank cash flow management) and 50 years or longer (consumer real estate debt). The average repayment time of all worldwide outstanding debt is perhaps 10 years. Equity is another way of financing business, as it has no set time to maturity and pays no set interest. It pays profit from the company it has a claim on. Accounting All credit is debt, a liability. Debt is created by lenders and borrowers agreeing to exchange the use of money for the promise to repay. The unit of money lent is the asset of the creditor and the liability of the debtor. Notes are paper with terms of exchange, hence credits or access to money. All currencies are notes (\\"This note is legal tender for...\\"). Money is based on a fiat whereupon all agree upon the exchange values of any one currency for another. This extends to savings and checking accounts which are depository receipts for money loaned to bankers who in turn lend it to other borrowers. And thus it multiplies, a deposit becomes a loan that becomes another deposit and so on. The terms of the lending agreement are the key elements of the contractual terms of a promissory note regarding repayment including the amount(s) loaned and to be repaid, loan fees, time value and risk value interest charges, due dates, balloon payments, default terms and more. All material information should be disclosed on financial statements or footnotes. Flows=2004 Worldwide debt and equity underwriting reached a record $5.69 trillion. Worldwide debt underwriting grew 4.3% year-over-year to $5.19 trillion. Syndicated lending was up 34.3% year-over-year. Worldwide high-yield corporate debt climbed to over $163 billion eclipsing the previous record of $150 billion set in 1998. US Asset-backed securities volume increased 41.7% to $857 billion. Worldwide equity & equity-related issuance totaled $505bn for the year, representing a 29.9% increase over the $389bn raised in 2003. Initial public offerings increased nearly 220%. 2003 Worldwide Debt, Equity and Equity-related issuance reached record-breaking levels with over $5 trillion in proceeds raised, surpassing 2001's record of $4.4 trillion. The $5 trillion of borrowings represented 14% of the GDP flow during the year (4.938/36.3) (see world economy). 93% of the issuance was debt, 7% was equity. Note that these numbers don't include all mortgage borrowing, which was $3.8 trillion in the United States during 2003. $900 billion of it is in mortgage-backed securities, at least $546 billion in US Federal Credit Agency.

The screenplay was by Paul Schrader, from a story by De Palma and Schrader. Bernard Herrmann provided the film's soundtrack prior to his death in 1975. The story is about a New Orleans businessman who is haunted by guilt following the death of his wife and daughter during a kidnapping-rescue attempt gone wrong. Years after the tragedy, he meets and falls in love with a young woman who is the exact look- alike of his long dead wife. Both De Palma and Schrader have pointed to Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958) as the major inspiration for Obsession's narrative and thematic concerns. Schrader's script was extensively rewritten and pared down by De Palma prior to shooting, causing the screenwriter to proclaim a complete lack of interest in the film's subsequent production and release. Completed in 1975, Columbia Pictures picked up the distribution rights but demanded that minor changes be made to reduce potentially controversial aspects of the plot. When finally released in the late summer of 1976, it became De Palma's first substantial box office success and received a mixed response from critics. Plot In 1959, Michael Courtland (Robertson), a New Orleans real estate developer, has his life shattered when his wife Elizabeth (Bujold) and young daughter Amy are kidnapped. The police recommend that he provide the kidnappers with a briefcase of shredded blank paper instead of the demanded ransom, as the kidnappers will then be more likely to surrender when cornered, rather than attempt to escape with cash in hand. Courtland agrees to this plan. This leads to a bungled car chase in which both kidnappers and victims are killed in a spectacular explosion. Courtland blames himself for the deaths of his wife and daughter. Skipping forward sixteen years later in 1975, Courtland is morbidly obsessed with his dead wife, and regularly visits a monument he has had built in her memory. The monument is a replica of the church (Basilica di San Miniato al Monte) where he and Elizabeth had met many years before in Florence, Italy. His real estate partner Robert LaSalle (Lithgow) convinces Courtland to tag along on a business trip back to Florence. While there, Courtland revisits the church, and suddenly comes face to face with a young woman named Sandra (Bujold in a dual role) who looks exactly like his late wife. The already slightly unhinged Courtland begins to court the young woman, and subtly attempts to transform her into a perfect mirror image of his dead wife. Facade of the basilica San Miniato al Monte in Florence, one of the important settings of the film. Courtland returns to New Orleans with Sandra so they can marry. On their wedding night, Sandra is kidnapped and a ransom note is left behind by her abductors. It is an exact replica of the kidnappers' message from sixteen years before. This time, Courtland decides to deliver the demanded cash. He withdraws massive quantities of money from his accounts and business holdings, financially ruining him and forcing him to sign over his interest in the real estate business to LaSalle. In the process, he discovers that his entire ordeal, including the original kidnapping, had been engineered by LaSalle as a way to gain sole control of Courtland's company share holdings. The now nearly insane Courtland stabs LaSalle to death. Knowing that Sandra must have been a willing accomplice in the plot against him, he goes to the airport to kill the escaping woman. On the plane, Sandra has a flashback to her part in the scheme; she is in fact Courtland's daughter: following the original kidnapping LaSalle concealed her survival and sent her to live in secret with an Italian caretaker who raised Amy as her own child and gave her the name of Sandra. Over the years, LaSalle has told her lies about Courtland, convincing her that her father had not paid the ransom because he did not love her. Sandra, who has come to love Courtland, attempts suicide on the plane and is taken off the flight in a wheelchair. Courtland sees her and runs toward her, gun drawn. A security guard attempts to stop him but Courtland smashes the briefcase full of money against the guard's head, knocking him unconscious. The briefcase breaks open and all of the money flies out. Sandra, seeing the fluttering bills, stands up and shouts: \\"Daddy! You brought the money!\\" Courtland now realizes for the first time who Sandra really is, and father and daughter fall into a deep embrace. Production De Palma and Schrader devised a story with a narrative inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, a film that both of them admired. Schrader's original screenplay, titled D√©j√† Vu, was reportedly much longer than the final film, with a coda that extended another ten years beyond where the film now ends. De Palma ultimately found Schrader's screenplay unfilmable due to its length, and rewrote and condensed the finale himself after Schrader refused to make the requested changes. According to De Palma, \\"Paul Schrader's ending actually went on for another act of obsession. I felt it was much too complicated, and wouldn't sustain, so I abbreviated it.\\"Childs, Mike and Jones, Alan. Cinefantastique Magazine, Volume 6, Number 1, 1977, pgs. 4 - 13. \\"DePalma Has The Power!\\" The film's composer, Bernard Herrmann, agreed that the original ending should be jettisoned, telling De Palma, after reading Schrader's version, \\"Get rid of it ‚Äî that'll never work\\". Schrader remained resentful of De Palma's rewrite for years, and claimed to have lost all interest in the project once the change was made. Schrader indicated that \\"the original three part story conclude with a section set in the future (1985). My original idea in the script was to write an obsessive love where transcended the normal strictures of time.\\"\\"Obsession\\" an essay by Brad Stevens, Arrow Blu-Ray, 2011 De Palma said, \\"It made Schrader very unhappy: he thought I'd truncated his masterpiece. He's never been the same since.\\" Schrader stated that \\"the future section was cut from the script for budgetary reasons\\" however rumor had it that Bernard Herrmann suggested the cuts when he was working on the score for the film because he felt the last third set in the future didn't work.\\"Obsession: An Essay\\" by Brad Stevens, Arrow video, Blu-Ray, 2011 In 2011 Schrader's full three part script was released as part of the Arrow Video Blu-ray. After the film was completed, Bernard Herrmann considered it the finest film in his musical career.BBC Columbia executives expressed unease over the incest theme, especially as it was portrayed in such a heavily romanticized manner. Consequently, a few minor changes were made to a pivotal sequence between Robertson and Bujold, in which dissolves and visual \\"ripples\\" were inserted over the wedding and post-wedding scenes to suggest that the consummation of their marriage only took place in a dream sequence. The film's editor, Paul Hirsch, agreed with the decision to obscure the incest theme, noting, \\"I thought it was a mistake to drag incest into what was basically a romantic mystery, so I suggested to Brian, 'What if it never happened? What if instead of having them get married, Michael only dreams of getting married? We have this shot of Cliff Robertson asleep. We could use that and then cut to the wedding sequence.' And that's what we did. It became a projection of his desires rather than actual fact.\\" In the documentary De Palma, the director indicated that he felt the major flaw of the film was in casting Academy Award winner Cliff Robertson. De Palma felt that Robertson couldn't play the anguish of the character, and was also frequently difficult on-set. De Palma was effusive in his praise of Bujold who he felt had the more difficult role, which she played admirably, giving the film the emotional resonance needed for the project.\\"De Palma\\" 2016 documentary Cast *Cliff Robertson as Michael Courtland *Genevi√®ve Bujold as Elizabeth Courtland/Sandra Portinari *John Lithgow as Robert Lasalle *Stocker Fontelieu as Dr. Ellman *Sylvia Kuumba Williams as Maid *Wanda Blackman as Amy Courtland *J.

Columbia held on to the movie for almost a year before dumping it into theaters in late August, traditionally the \\"dog days\\" of movie attendance. Obsession had managed to obtain enough positive critical notices to spark interest, and it earned the distributor over $4 million in domestic (U.S. and Canada) rentals. Initial critical reaction to Obsession was mixed. Roger Ebert wrote, \\"Brian De Palma's Obsession is an overwrought melodrama, and that's what I like best about it... I don't just like movies like these; I relish them. Sometimes overwrought excess can be its own reward. If Obsession had been even a little more subtle, had made even a little more sense on some boring logical plane, it wouldn't have worked at all.\\" Variety's review described it as \\"an excellent romantic and non-violent suspense drama...Paul Schrader's script...is a complex but comprehensible mix of treachery, torment and selfishness...\\" In Time, Richard Schickel called the film, \\"...exquisite entertainment...The film also throws into high melodramatic relief certain recognizable human truths: the shock of sudden loss, the panic of the effort to recoup, the mourning and guilt that blind the protagonist to a multitude of suspicious signs as he seeks expiation and a chance to relive his life. In a sense, the movie offers viewers the opportunity to do the same thing‚Äîby going back to a more romantic era of the cinema and the simple, touching pleasures denied the audience by the current antiromantic spirit of the movies.\\" Other reviewers routinely praised the stylish cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond, and Bernard Herrmann's beautiful, highly romantic score was one of the most acclaimed in his distinguished career, earning him a posthumous Academy Award nomination (the composer died in December 1975, a few hours after completing the score of Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver). The National Board of Review named Obsession one of the Top Ten Films of 1976. But several critics complained that the film was all too clearly a mere homage to Vertigo, without being original or interesting enough in itself as a thriller. Pauline Kael, normally one of De Palma's greatest admirers, dismissed the film as \\"...no more than an exercise in style, with the camera whirling around nothingness...\\"Kael, Pauline. From her review \\"The Curse\\" in The New Yorker, dated November 22, 1976, reprinted in When The Lights Go Down, Holt Rinehart Winston, 1980. Vincent Canby wrote, \\"To be blunt, Obsession is no Vertigo, Hitchcock's witty, sardonic study of obsession that did transcend its material, which wasn't all that bad to start with. The Schrader screenplay...is most effective when it's most romantic, and transparent when it attempts to be mysterious...The plot...is such that you'll probably have figured out the mystery very early.\\" Decades later, Obsession's reputation improved considerably. Rotten Tomatoes website lists the film as having a 73% favorability rating, based on the critiques of a sampling of 26 reviewers.

He was reappointed, however, in 1867; and in 1891 he was transferred to the University of Rome La Sapienza. He became prominent both as an orientalist, a publicist and a poet. He maintained close ties with Romanian orientalists. At International Congress of Orientalists from Florence in 1878 he invited Bogdan Petriceicu Ha≈üdeu, a prominent Romanian writer and philologist.

Early career and university His first international appearance was at the 1990 World Rowing Junior Championships ‚Äì winning bronze in his single scull (1x). He first competed at the senior level in 1991, and at the age of 19, finished 11th at the World Rowing Championships in Vienna in the single scull. At the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, he just missed making the finals, finishing fourth in the semi-finals (3 to advance). M√ºller chose not to start the petite (consolation) finals for places 7 through 12 because of a back injury. In 1994 and 1995, he finished 2nd and 6th, respectively, at the World Championships. During this period, M√ºller began studying at Brown University in the United States. He helped lead Brown to an undefeated season and a national championship in 1993 in the eight-man boat. Following this collegiate victory and his subsequent disappointing finish at the 1993 World Championships in the double scull event, M√ºller decided to concentrate solely on the single scull. This decision created friction between M√ºller and the then coach at Brown Steve Gladstone. In 1994 M√ºller was the first ever single sculler rowing the 2000 meters in a time way below 6.40. M√ºller showed a first dominating season in his single with winning the Overall FISA Rowing World Cup and World Cup Races in Paris with a time of 6.38, Lucerne with a new 'Rotsee' record also below 6.40 and the Diamond Sculls at Henley Royal Regatta. Only at the World Championships he was defeated by the German Andr√© Willms. After spending two years in Providence, Rhode Island, attending Brown and rowing his single scull, M√ºller moved to Newport Beach, California, which offered a better climate for year-round training. He also met his future wife in Newport. Olympic debut M√ºller won gold in the single scull at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. M√ºller won the race with a strong finish. He was 3 seconds down and in fourth place at the 1000 meter mark (half way) and he moved up to third and just 1 second down with 500 meters to go. M√ºller then launched a devastating drive to the line. He won decisively besting Derek Porter who had led the whole race, and his childhood hero, and two-time Olympic Champion Thomas Lange who finished third. M√ºller's last 500 was the fastest 500 meter split time of the day. His time of 6:44.85 has been an Olympic record until Tim Maeyens of Belgium finished his heat at the 2012 London Olympics in a time of 6:42.52. 1998 season onwards Following his Olympic victory, M√ºller took a year off from rowing. In 1998, he won two World Cup race besting future rival Rob Waddell. But at the World Rowing Championships, Waddell had the best race of his life pushing M√ºller back to second. In the pre-season to the 1998 rowing calendar, Waddell set a world record on the indoor rowing machine. In 1999, Waddell went on to sweep the World Cup races and the World Championships, M√ºller getting second each time. Leading up to the 2000 Sydney Olympics, M√ºller entered World Cup race in Vienna, where he finally beat Waddell after four consecutive second-place finishes. M√ºller did not enter any other preliminary races, and Waddell won the World Cup race in Lucerne. Between the 1996 Olympics and the 2000 Olympics, M√ºller's record against Waddell was 3 out of 7. Both Waddell and M√ºller won all of their preliminary heats leading up to the Olympic finals. In the finals, in addition to his rival two-time reigning World Champion Rob Waddell, M√ºller faced former World Champion and Olympic silver medalist Derek Porter and rising star Marcel Hacker. It was the closest men's single scull final ever. They battled down the course with the lead changing several times. M√ºller gained the lead in the last 1000 meters. But Waddell stayed with him. They battled down the course, just a few feet separate them. Gradually Waddell wore M√ºller down, passing him in the sprint. Despite having a chest cold, M√ºller continued to hang tough and held on for the silver medal. Hacker finished third and a disappointed Porter finished fourth. Just over two seconds ‚Äì the length of a boat ‚Äì separated first from fourth place. Retirement and career Having lived in the United States since 1992 (and attending Brown University) M√ºller became a naturalized citizen of the United States in early 2004. He then announced he would trial for the US team for the Athens Olympics. He had won all of the preliminary trial races. However just before the start of the final set of trials, there were a number of high- profile killings of foreigners in Iraq as part of the Iraq War, and Americans were believed to be potential targets for violence at the Olympics by al- Qaeda. M√ºller pulled out of the trials saying: > When you have three children and a wife and you leave them, then leave them > again to go overseas, and you see somebody's head getting cut off ... you > start having clouds in your head for why you want to proceed like this, with > all the responsibility about traveling, leaving the family, etcetera. M√ºller currently runs an indoor rowing studio, called The Iron Oarsman, in Orange County, California and is a goodwill ambassador for the sport of rowing. At this time, he is the sole producer of indoor rowing workout DVDs. He is married to his wife Erin, and has four children.

Opened in 1977, it hosted the Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix on ten occasions, and was also used for CART, motorcycle racing and stock car racing. In 2012, it was demolished to make way for facilities to be used at the 2016 Summer Olympics. The original circuit The original circuit was built between 1971 and 1977 on the site of the Barra da Tijuca road course, which had itself been built on reclaimed marshland and was operational from 1964 to 1970. It was a relatively flat circuit, with a long pit straight and a longer back straight (which allowed the turbo-engined Formula One cars of the mid-1980s to reach speeds of 300 km/h (186 mph)), and numerous mid- to slow-speed corners with plenty of room for overtaking. The maximum spectator capacity was 90,000. Formula One Second place, Emerson Fittipaldi Copersucar, Jacarepagua, 1978 The first Brazilian Grand Prix at the circuit took place shortly after opening, in 1978, and was won by Argentina's Carlos Reutemann in a V12 Ferrari 312T3, after Sweden's Ronnie Peterson had taken pole position in the revolutionary ground-effect Lotus 78-Ford. After the 1979 and 1980 races had been held at the Interlagos circuit in S√£o Paulo, the F1 circus left the 5-mile Interlagos circuit due to safety concerns with the circuit and the growing slums of the circuit's surrounding areas being at odds with Formula One's new glamour image. The Brazilian Grand Prix was then held at Jacarepagu√° for the remainder of the 1980s. The 1981 race was held in very wet conditions and was again won by Reutemann, this time driving a Williams FW07C-Ford, and in controversial circumstances: he disobeyed the team's orders to let teammate and then- reigning World Champion, Australia's Alan Jones, take the win. The 1982 race, held at the height of the FISA‚ÄìFOCA war, was also shrouded in controversy. Rio born driver Nelson Piquet, who had won the World Championship the year before, finished first in a Brabham BT49-Ford, with Finland's Keke Rosberg second in a Williams FW07C-Ford. However, both drivers were disqualified for being underweight, having raced with \\"water-cooled brakes\\". This promoted Alain Prost, third in the turbocharged Renault RE30, to the win, the first of an eventual five for the Frenchman at the circuit and start a streak of 7 straight wins for turbo powered cars at the circuit until the original turbo era ended following the season. The disqualifications, however, prompted most FOCA-aligned teams ‚Äì including Brabham and Williams ‚Äì to boycott the San Marino Grand Prix two races later. However, unlike the 1980 Spanish Grand Prix where the factory teams of Ferrari, Renault and Alfa Romeo (all who were on the FISA side of the war) boycotted the race and the results were eventually voided, the 1982 San Marino Grand Prix results without the FOCA teams were counted. Piquet and Rosberg again crossed the line first and second in the 1983 race, although this time only Rosberg was disqualified, having had a push start in the pits after his Williams FW08-Ford caught fire. Unusually, the drivers below Rosberg were not promoted accordingly. The win was the first of two wins at the circuit for Piquet, who would go on to win his second World Championship that year. Piquet won the race in his Brabham-BMW turbo and went on to be the first ever F1 World Champion to be powered by a turbocharged engine. From 1983 until 1989, the Brazilian Grand Prix was the opening race of the season. Both the 1984 and 1985 races were won by Prost, now racing a McLaren-TAG. The 1984 race also saw the debut of Ayrton Senna, driving a Toleman TG183-Hart where he had the unfortunate 'honour' of being the first retirement of the season. Piquet won the 1986 race in a Williams FW11-Honda, with Senna making it a Brazilian 1‚Äì2 in a Lotus 98T-Renault, before Prost beat Piquet to win the 1987 race in a McLaren MP4/3-TAG. After Piquet won his third (and final) World Championship in , the circuit was named after him in 1988. However, he had to settle for third in a Lotus 100T-Honda in that year's race, as Prost once again won in a McLaren MP4/4-Honda. 1988 was the last year of the original turbo era in Formula One. For Prost it was his 5th win in 9 races at the circuit. The 1989 race was the first to be held following the banning of turbo engines, and Great Britain's Nigel Mansell took a surprise win in his V12 powered Ferrari 640, complete with Formula 1's first semi-automatic gearbox. Another Brazilian driver, Maur√≠cio Gugelmin, finished third in a March 881-Judd (Prost finished second), while Senna, who had won his first World Championship the year before, set the fastest ever lap of the circuit in qualifying with a time of 1:25.302 to take pole position in a V10 McLaren MP4/5-Honda. After winning the race, Mansell joked that with the Ferrari's known reliability problems at the time he had booked an early flight out of Rio in anticipation of a short race for him. In , the Brazilian Grand Prix moved to a shortened Interlagos, where it has been held ever since. CART From 1996 to 2000 the CART series staged events at Jacarepagu√° in an accessory trapezoid-shaped speedway named \\"Emerson Fittipaldi Speedway\\", having approximately 3 km (1.864 mi) length. The race, originally the Rio 400, before being shortened to the Rio 200 in 1999, was first won in 1996 by Brazilian Andr√© Ribeiro. The circuit record for the Emerson Fittipaldi Speedway was set by Emerson's own nephew Christian Fittipaldi with a time of 38.565 (280 km/h or 174 mph) for the 3 km (1.864 mi) track. The long back straight of the road course which had grandstands running its entire 900 metre length became the front straight of the Speedway, with the pits located in the area between the straight and the pit straight of the road course. Motorcycle Grand Prix The circuit also hosted the Rio de Janeiro motorcycle Grand Prix race from 1995 to 2004. Italy's nine time World Champion Valentino Rossi won the most races, winning four from 2000‚Äì2003, while Australian five-time World Champion Michael Doohan won the 1996 and 1997 races. The first Rio Motorcycle Grand Prix was won by Italian Luca Cadalora, riding a Yamaha YZR500. The final race held at the circuit in 2004, was won by Japanese rider Makoto Tamada riding a Honda RC211V. Honda won seven of the nine Rio Grands Prix held, with Yamaha winning two. Other races The circuit held the Mil Milhas Brasil endurance race in 1997. Until 2012 the circuit was also a host in the South American Formula Three Championship, namely the Formula 3 Sudamericana. Recent As of early 2005, there were plans to partially demolish this racetrack to make room for a new sports complex to be used for the 2007 Pan American Games. It would have made the track approximately long, thus making it too short for most international racing series. However, the FIA's ruling on a track's minimum length is ambiguous. In 2006, despite rumors of the race being cancelled, the Brazilian Stock Car Rio event was contested on a temporary short circuit combining sections of the oval and normal circuits and the start/finish line was moved to the back stretch, which was cut short to make room for the Pan-American games venues. Another proposal for the circuit was to have both a club permanent circuit, and an international-length half- permanent, half-car park circuit involving that circuit and an extension which utilises the car parks of the park. That would have been designed by Hermann Tilke. In January 2008 it was announced that the track was to be demolished to allow the city to build an Olympic Training Centre venue for the Rio de Janeiro bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics which Rio was successful in winning.Jacarepagua to be demolished As of 2008, the trackF-3 sul-americana volta ao Rio depois de tr√™s anos ‚Äì Tazio (in Portuguese) comprised the original circuit's second half with a hairpin that connects the previous main straight and back straight.

In March 2013 Bernie Ecclestone, CEO of the Formula One Group, said discussions were taking place for the Formula 1 Grand Prix to move from the Interlagos Circuit in S√£o Paulo to Rio de Janeiro and a suitable time for this could be 2016, coinciding with the 2016 Olympic Games. Formula 1 last raced at Rio in 1989 before returning to S√£o Paulo in 1990, where it has been held since. However, no Grand Prix was held in Rio as of 2019.

In knot theory, a branch of mathematics, a knot or link K in the 3-dimensional sphere S^3 is called fibered or fibred (sometimes Neuwirth knot in older texts, after Lee Neuwirth) if there is a 1-parameter family F_t of Seifert surfaces for K, where the parameter t runs through the points of the unit circle S^1, such that if s is not equal to t then the intersection of F_s and F_t is exactly K. Examples=Knots that are fibered For example: * The unknot, trefoil knot, and figure-eight knot are fibered knots. * The Hopf link is a fibered link. Knots that are not fibered stevedore knot is not fibered The Alexander polynomial of a fibered knot is monic, i.e. the coefficients of the highest and lowest powers of t are plus or minus 1\\\\. Examples of knots with nonmonic Alexander polynomials abound, for example the twist knots have Alexander polynomials qt-(2q+1)+qt^{-1}, where q is the number of half-twists. In particular the stevedore knot is not fibered. Related constructions Fibered knots and links arise naturally, but not exclusively, in complex algebraic geometry. For instance, each singular point of a complex plane curve can be described topologically as the cone on a fibered knot or link called the link of the singularity. The trefoil knot is the link of the cusp singularity z^2+w^3; the Hopf link (oriented correctly) is the link of the node singularity z^2+w^2. In these cases, the family of Seifert surfaces is an aspect of the Milnor fibration of the singularity. A knot is fibered if and only if it is the binding of some open book decomposition of S^3.

He was U.S. Chess Champion in 1944 and 1946. In later years he served in various chess organizations, receiving recognition from the United States Chess Federation, including in 2004 the highest honor, \\"Dean of American Chess\\". Rising star Denker was born on February 21, 1914, in the Bronx, New York City, in an Orthodox Jewish family. According to Denker himself, he learned chess in 1923 watching his elder brothers play, but took up the game seriously only in his freshman year in Theodore Roosevelt High School, where his schoolmates played for a nickel a game in the cafeteria. After steadily losing his milk money for a long time, Denker discovered former world chess champion Emanuel Lasker's book \\"Common Sense in Chess\\" in the school library, studied the book, and soon \\"the nickels came pouring back with interest\\".Arnold Denker: the beginning. http://www.denkerchess.com/?page_id=1294 Denker was a promising boxer in his early years. He first gained attention in chess by winning the New York City individual interscholastic championship in 1929 at age 15. In the next decade he established himself as a leading rival to Samuel Reshevsky, Reuben Fine, and Isaac Kashdan as the strongest U.S. chess player. His first really strong international event was Syracuse, New York 1934, where Reshevsky won convincingly, with Denker placing just behind him. In 1940 Denker won the first of his six Manhattan Chess Club championships. He became U.S. Champion in 1944, winning fourteen games (including one against Fine), drawing three, and losing none. Denker called his win over Fine from this event 'the game of my life'. (This 91 percent score was the best winning percentage in U.S. Championship history until Bobby Fischer scored 11‚Äì0 in 1963‚Äì64.) Denker successfully defended his U.S. title in a 1946 challenge match against Herman Steiner, winning 6‚Äì4 at Los Angeles.The Bobby Fischer I Knew And Other Stories, by Arnold Denker and Larry Parr, Hypermodern Press, San Francisco 1995 He became an International Master in 1950 (the year the title was first awarded by FIDE). World War II years During World War II Denker played exhibitions at army bases and aboard aircraft carriers. In 1945, as U.S. champion, he played on board one in the USA vs USSR radio match, losing both games to Mikhail Botvinnik, and in 1946 travelled to Moscow for the return match, losing both games against Vasily Smyslov. Also in 1946, he played at the very strong Groningen tournament, the first major event following World War II, scoring 9.5 out of 19 and securing draws against Botvinnik and Smyslov, and losing after achieving a winning position against Max Euwe. David Hooper and Ken Whyld note that Denker may have been unfortunate in that his best years came during World War II, when very little competitive chess was being played . In 1947 Denker produced an autobiographical game collection in his book: If You Must Play Chess. Denker was never a full-time professional player. His peak results were scored from 1940 to 1947, in U.S. Championships and on his trips to Europe for tournaments at London, Hastings and Groningen. International ratings were introduced by FIDE only in 1970, more than a generation after Denker's best years. The website chessmetrics.com retrospectively places Denker as high as 27th in the world in the mid 1940s,http://www.chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PlayerProfile.asp?Params=199510SSSSS3S029248194307131000000000015910100 but this site is missing several of Denker's most important results. Later life In 1981 FIDE made Denker an honorary Grandmaster. In later years, he was an important chess organizer, serving on the boards of the American Chess Foundation, the United States Chess Federation (USCF), and the U.S. Chess Trust - the driving force behind the prestigious Denker Tournament of High School Champions (named in his honor). He also served as a FIDE official. Denker also continued to play chess, though at well below his earlier strength. (His last FIDE rating was 2293.) He wrote many chess articles and in 1995 the book: The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories (co-authored by Larry Parr; Hypermodern Press). In 1992 Denker was inducted into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame. He received America's highest chess honor on June 11, 2004 when he became only the third person to be proclaimed \\"Dean of American Chess\\" by the USCF. A graduate of New York University, he married the former Nina Simmons in 1936, a marriage lasting 57 years until her death in 1993. They had three children: Richard, Mitchell and Randie. Denker died of brain cancer on January 2, 2005 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

The station is owned and operated by the Nine Entertainment Co., and is an owned-and-operated station of the Nine Network, under the company name Territory Television Pty. Ltd.. The station is known for being the only commercial television network in the Northern Territory to broadcast a full Darwin news bulletin on weeknights. The network has also produced local programs airing across the entire Nine Network, such as Driving Test (2018) and Catching the Chase: Barra Nationals (2018). History=Origins NTD-8 was officially launched at 8:00pm on 11 November 1971, with the opening lineup beginning at 5:30pm with Skippy the Bush Kangaroo, followed by Bandstand at 6:00 p.m. and at 7:00 p.m., An Evening with Burt Bacharach. The station was officially inaugurated at 8:00pm by Northern Territory Administrator, Fred Chaney, followed by speeches from Sir Myles Wright, Fred Yates, John Hickman, and assistant executive John May. The opening lineup continued with All the King's Men at 8:30 p.m. and Danger Man at 10:30 p.m. The station closed for the night at 11:30 p.m. The station was completely destroyed by Cyclone Tracy in December 1974 and was off air for 10 months while it was rebuilt entirely. The station reopened at 6 Blake Street in the Darwin suburb of The Gardens, with full colour, on 27 October 1975 with John Lewis as Manager, with on air operators Gavin Ashton, Steve Mariner and Ross Jamieson. Daryl Potts was Chief Engineer until he died in 1979. Robert Potts was Studio Cameraman Film Department / Trainee location 16mm Cameraman / On Air Operator. 1980s NTD did not run any news and current affairs programming until 18 October 1982, after the station hired Rex Clark as a news director to launch a nightly bulletin at 7:00pm entitled News at Seven, alongside a current affairs programme entitled Spectrum. In the late 1980s, NTD was purchased by Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL), the owners of the Nine Network at that time. Following the purchase, NTD adopted a similar on-air presentation to the Nine Network, though replacing the \\"9\\" with an \\"8\\". NTD's news service was revamped and rebranded along with the station, to become Eight National News. 1990s NTD was the sole commercial television station in Darwin until 1998, when Telecasters Australia launched Seven Darwin. However, for several years, NTD remained the sole locally based station in the city, as Seven Darwin was little more than a relay for Seven Central. Territory Television Pty. Ltd. attempted to gain Seven Network affiliation rights prior to Seven Darwin's launch, in a strategic move to dominate and force the incoming competitor to align with Network Ten. This would have seen NTD broadcast both Nine Network and Seven Network programming, however after being rejected affiliation, the station gained Network Ten affiliation to supplement their parent company's Nine Network programming. 2000s On New Year's Day 2003, Eight Darwin became Nine Darwin, in line with the rest of Kerry Packer's Nine Network owned-and-operated stations. At the same time, the station dropped most Ten programming from the line-up, and in 2005, the Network Ten affiliation rights were officially relinquished, and were then taken by TND in 2005. In 2005, in the midst of the tug-of-war for the AFL television rights, PBL announced that National Rugby League games will take precedence on the station over AFL games, a sign that Nine may have been about to give up the race for the rights to a proposed Seven-Ten consortium, which they did, but not without putting in a $780 million dollar bid for the rights. In 2008, Nine Darwin (NTD) began broadcasting Nine HD. In April 2008, Darwin Digital Television (DTD), a joint venture between the Nine Network and Macquarie Southern Cross Media, began broadcasting on the digital terrestrial platform as a full-time Ten Network affiliate. The same year, it was speculated that Imparja Television, the Nine affiliate for most of the rest of the Territory, was planning to purchase the station from the Nine Network. The deal would have involved the sale of the station, as well as its facilities and licence. Negotiations for the sale of the station fell through on 29 September, when Imparja failed to secure federal government funding to help finance the takeover. 2010s The analogue signal for NTD was turned off at 9.00am CST on Tuesday 30 July 2013. In July 2017, it was reported that the station's nightly news program, Nine News Darwin, would move its studio presentation from Darwin to Nine's Brisbane studios and replace local weekend bulletins with delayed simulcasts of the Queensland bulletin. The last standalone edition of Nine News Darwin aired on 8 September 2017. The bulletin returned on Monday 11 September 2017, in a new regional hub in Brisbane.End of an era as Channel 9 Darwin airs its last ever locally produced news bulletin, news.com.au, 9 September 2017 The changes were heavily criticised by the public, with 12 employees at the network being made redundant or offered redeployment in other locations. After the initial cuts, the newsroom was left with a chief of staff, four reporters and four camera operators filing reports interstate. Subsequent cuts further reduced the newsroom with a chief of staff, three reporters and three camera operators. In April 2019, the network made the announcement that they will be decommissioning the Blake Street studios to move to a newer site in the Darwin CBD on Mitchell Street. NTD moved to the new facility in December 2019. It spans across two floors with general offices, a newsroom and a studio. It is expected the Blake Street site will be sold, demolished and replaced with residential highrises. Programming= Nine News Darwin  The station's local news service, Nine News Darwin, airs at 6:00pm each weeknight. The news reports are filed from the NTD newsroom in Darwin and the bulletin is aired live from the QTQ studios in Brisbane. Reporters and camera crews covering the Darwin area are based locally at the NTD studios. Afternoon bulletins are a delayed simulcast of Nine Afternoon News Sydney, while weekend bulletins are a delayed simulcast of Nine News Queensland with no local opt-outs. The bulletin is simulcasted on radio every weeknight on 104.1 Territory FM, as well as on Imparja GEM for viewers outside of NTD's broadcasting area. Nine News Darwin was launched on 18 October 1982 as Eight News at Seven, alongside a current affairs program entitled Spectrum. The news service was later rebranded to Eight National News in the late 1980s. On New Year's Day 2003, the news service was revamped following the change of branding to Nine Darwin across the station. The service became National Nine News on weeknights from 6:00pm with local news opt-outs during the Sydney bulletin on weekends. In July 2011, the station debuted a new look for their news service including a brand new set to match those used in the metropolitan bulletins. This also included the implementation of locally produced weekend news bulletins for the Darwin area, presented by Amy Culpitt. In April 2016, Nine News Darwin expanded to one hour between 6:00pm and 7:00pm nightly. In September 2017, the bulletin relocated its studio presentation from Darwin to the Brisbane studios, with the last locally produced bulletin from the NTD studios aired on 8 September. The format, first aired on 11 September, was presented as a recorded joint interstate broadcast with regional Queensland and is anchored by Jonathan Uptin and Samantha Heathwood. The bulletin included opt-outs for local news, sport and weather. In February 2018, Uptin was promoted as the sports and weekend presenter for Nine News Queensland, and was subsequently replaced by Paul Taylor. In March 2020, the Nine Network temporarily suspended their regional news bulletins due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, Nine News Darwin reverted to a local format producing updates from NTD's makeshift studio. Anchored by Kathleen Gazzola, and also presented by Zarisha Bradley, Elle Conway and Ainsley Koch, they are shown as opt-outs during the Nine News Queensland bulletin from 6:30pm as well as during advertisement breaks at primetime. Smaller news segments, as well as news coverage during weekends, are uploaded to the Nine News Darwin Facebook page. On 15 September 2020, it was announced that Nine News Darwin will return to air weeknights from 5 October 2020. Paul Taylor returned as its main presenter. =Presenters and Reporters Main Presenter  * Paul Taylor (2017 ‚Äì present)  Reporters  * Kathleen Gazzola (Chief Political Reporter and Chief of Staff) * Zarisha Bradley (Court Reporter) * Elle Conway (Police Reporter) * Ainsley Koch (Community Reporter) Former Presenters *Jake Hauritz (Sport Presenter) *Charles Croucher (Sport and Weekend Presenter, now political reporter in Canberra) *Kyrrie Blenkinsop (Sport and Weekend Presenter) *Angelina Anictomatis (Sport and Weekend Presenter) *Lisa Andrews (Sport and Weekend Presenter) *Zara James (Weekend Presenter, now with Nine News Sydney) *Leah Hannon *Tim Arvier (now Nine News U.S. correspondent) *David Fidler *Theona Mitaros (her daughter, Elle Georgiou, is a reporter on Seven News Perth) *Jonathan Uptin (now Nine News Queensland presenter) *Amy Culpitt (now ABC News NT weekend presenter) *Henry Jones (Sport Presenter) *Samantha Heathwood (now Nine News Local regional Queensland presenter) ReferencesExternal links *Nine Network Television stations in Darwin, Northern Territory Nine Network Television channels and stations established in 1971 ","title":"NTD (TV station)"},{"id":"1358633","title":"Barnet and Southgate College"},{"id":"1358634","text":"The logo of the International Astronomical Youth Camp (IAYC). The International Astronomical Youth Camp (IAYC) is an annual summer camp for young people aged 16‚Äì24 with an interest in astronomy. Established in 1969, the IAYC has taken place in over 30 different places in Europe, North Africa and the Near East. The main goals of the camp are for participants to have fun collaborating in astronomical explorations, and to bring people together from different regions of the world by encouraging them to work together and learn more about science and its methods. Participants work on astronomical projects in working groups. Since 1969 more than 1700 young people have taken part in the IAYC. Nowadays, around 65 people participate in each camp. The IAYC attracts all kinds of participants: those who enjoy astronomy as a general interest to those make it their job. Some participants have later on gained astronomy related jobs that brought them fame. Examples are Conny Aerts, a Belgian astrophysicist, Ofer Lahav, an Israeli-British cosmologist, Robert H. McNaught, a Scottish-Australian astronomer, Erich Karkoschka, a German astronomer and Govert Schilling, a Dutch science journalist. Recent camps have seen participants organising so called Preunions in advance of the camp. These events are used to get to know each other and see a little bit more of the neighbourhood, as most of the camp will take place in an isolated area. Throughout the rest of the year, many reunions take place. A returning tradition is the so-called New Year's Reunion, which is organised by a participant, anywhere in Europe. Successful reunions have seen more than 30 participants. Recent locations have been England, Hungary, Belgium, Serbia and Macedonia. A day in IAYC As practical astronomy is mainly carried out during the night, the daily schedule is quite unnormal, as it is moved into a few hours ahead. A typical day is as following: *11.30 hrs - Waking-up service (Run by the NAP-Leader) *12.00 hrs - Breakfast *13.00 hrs - Working group session 1 *15.30 hrs - Free time *17.30 hrs - Dinner *19.30 hrs - Non Astronomical Program *22.00 hrs - Working group session 2 *00.00 hrs - Night meal *After midnight - Observation Working Groups The participants are divided into groups (for which they apply in advance) that all deal with a specific field of astronomy. They are meant to carry out a project on a topic that has to do with the theme of the working group. The project is to be done individually or in a group of two or three people. It is carried out independently, though with the supervising help of a leader. The topics may vary from beginner's work, in which the participant gets introduced to the field of astronomy, to in depth astrophysics and actual research, usually carried out by a more experienced participant. At the end of the camp, the participants write an article about their project. The articles are bundled into a report book that is sent to the participants after the camp. Every group has its own leader. The themes of the working groups may differ very much, from theoretical (where the focus is on the mathematical and physical side of astronomy and astrophysics) to practical (where the focus on observational astronomy and the use of telescopes cannot be ignored). This is just a rough explanation, as there have also been groups that fit neither of the two explanations but focus more on background, like ones with a more philosophical character. The theme of the group depends very much on the leader attached to it and his/her background. Besides the working group leaders, three other leaders are also included in the leader team. The general coordinator takes care of supervision and is the contact person. The NAP- leader organises the Non-Astronomical Program, which is described later on in this article. The Darkroom leader is responsible for the photography in the camp. He or she also runs a darkroom in which black and white photographs are developed (mainly astronomical photographs). Free time During the free time, the participants are totally free to do whatever they want. Many use this opportunity to organise a workshop, in which they can share their passions with other participants. A returning workshop is on the use of a telescope. Also (sports) competitions are organised during the free time. Non-Astronomical Program The Non-Astronomical Program (NAP) is held daily in order to give the participants the opportunity to relax and to get to know each other better. NAP has its own leader that supervises the games and activities, of which many have become traditions in the IAYC. There are a few special NAP's: *The movie Every year a movie is shot, which has a special topic, made up by the NAP-leader. Every working group gets a camera and has to shoot a short film related to the topic for one day. Usually these films include a large amount of sarcasm towards habits of the camp. *National Evening On this evening all participants gather in groups consisting of all people from their own nation. Every group has to give a short presentation on something that is typical for their country. Often, the presentations are hilarious and participants like to present their country in an ironic way. *Poetry Evening Participants share their favourite poetry, from any language. Observation During the night, many participants try to enjoy the beauty of the night sky as much as possible, as long as the weather allows them. Practical working groups try to run their projects with the use of telescopes and other devices, which are all carried to the observation field. Also participants from other working groups join: sleeping under the night sky is something very special. Special moments on which many people like to go to the observation field include the peak of the Perseid showers, on the 11th of August, should the camp be taking place at that time. If the weather is too bad, however, most participants attend one of the many parties, organised throughout the camp. Special days There are two special days in the camp, namely the following: *Excursion day During this day, an excursion is organised. It is meant to show something that is specific for the area in with the camp is held. After that, a hike through the area is held, after which a local town in visited. This day is used to visit the internet facilities as well, as the participants cannot make use of internet during the camp itself. The excursion day ends with a party on the camp site. *Free day On this day, the camp is 'at rest'. The participants are free to do whatever they want. Most participants choose to make a short trip in the area, either sightseeing a nearby city or hiking/cycling surrounding nature. Others choose to stay back at the camphouse and relax for the day. IWA The organisation behind the IAYC is called The International Workshop for Astronomy e.V. which was established in 1979. It is responsible for the camp and consists of the leaders, who all do this on a voluntarily basis. Time line The first IAYCs were all held in Germany and its bordering countries. Later on, other countries were visited. In the late 1970s camps were held in the Near East and North Africa. Since the 1980s, the focus lay on Europe again. An important condition for the choice of a location has always been that it is as far from centres of population as possible such that observations can be performed free from light pollution. In 1999, in which the solar eclipse of that summer was a major event, 99 people participated, excluding former participants of previous camps who joined for a one-week old-oldies special reunion. In recent years, the number of participants has remained stable at around 65. The 42nd (July 16 - August 5, 2006), the 43rd (July 29 - August 18, 2007) and the 47th (July 17 - August 6, 2011) IAYC took place in T≈ôeme≈°ek, Czech Republic. The 44th camp took place in Sayda, in the German federal state of Saxony from 20 July until 9 August 2008, the site of the 33rd (1997) and 40th (2004) camps. The 45th camp was held in Hala Miziowa (Poland). Related camps The IAYC is not the only youth camp that focusses on astronomy. In Germany the Astronomische Abenteuer Camp (AAC; Astronomical Adventure Camp) is held annually around Easter and the Astronomische SommerLager (ASL; Astronomical Summer Camp) is held yearly in the summer. In The Netherlands, the Youngsters Working Group for Astronomy organises several youth camps every year. Several Slovenian astronomical associations organise MART (Youth astronomy research camp) together. It is held in August in Slovenia. Youths from neighbour countries participate too because the camp is very well known in the area.

He played in Major League Baseball as a left fielder between and , most notably as an integral member of the Oakland Athletics dynasty that won three consecutive World Series championships between 1972 and 1974. A three-time All-Star, Rudi excelled as an offensive and as a defensive player, winning 3 Gold Glove Awards and was the 1972 American League leader in hits with 181. He also played for the California Angels and the Boston Red Sox.  Playing career  Rudi was born in Modesto, California. He batted a career- high .309 in 1970 and led the American League a career-high 181 hits in 1972. That year, he helped the Athletics win the World Series and made a great game- saving catch in Game 2 that went on to become part of the highlight reel for many Major League Baseball films. With Tony P√©rez on first and Oakland leading 2-0 in the ninth inning, Rudi raced to the left-field fence and made a leaping, backhanded catch of Denis Menke's smash to save a run. Earlier in the game, Rudi hit a solo home run. He also caught Pete Rose's fly ball for the final out of the Series. In 1974 he had a career best 22 home runs and 99 runs batted in and hit a home run in Game 5 of the 1974 World Series off Mike Marshall that would turn out to be the game winner and Series clincher. Rudi's Athletics became the first team since the 1949-1953 New York Yankees to win 3 straight World Championships. In 1975, he was elected by the fans as a starter in the All-Star Game as an outfielder, where he joined four other Oakland A's in the American League starting lineup. He also played some first base for the A's in 1975. With baseball entering the free agency era, A's owner Charlie Finley attempted to sell Rudi and pitcher Rollie Fingers to the Boston Red Sox for $1 million each at the MLB trade deadline on June 15, 1976, rather than trading them (as he had done with Reggie Jackson and Ken Holtzman the year before) or risking losing them in free agency. Rudi actually reported to the Red Sox and was issued a uniform, but never was permitted to play, as baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn voided the transaction as not being in the best interests of baseball.New York Times Rudi later played for Boston in 1981. Rudi, along with Don Baylor, ended up leaving the A's as a free agent and signed with the California Angels for the 1977 season. However, Rudi's tenure with the Angels was mostly injury-plagued, even though he posted respectable home run and RBI totals in his four seasons. His best year with the Angels was 1978, when he played in 133 games and hit .256 with 17 home runs and 79 RBI's. He missed the Angels' 1979 post-season run with injury. After the 1980 season, Rudi was traded by the Angels along with Frank Tanana to the Red Sox for Fred Lynn. After one injury-filled season, he closed his career back with the A's in 1982 and hit a home run in his last professional at-bat. In a sixteen-year major league career, Rudi played in 1,547 games, compiling a .264 batting average (1,468-for-5,556) with 684 runs scored, 287 doubles, 39 triples, 179 home runs, 810 RBI and 369 walks. His on-base percentage was .311 and slugging percentage was .427. Strong defensively, he recorded a career .991 fielding percentage at all three outfield positions. In 38 post-season games, covering five American League Championship Series and three World Series from 1971-75, he handled 124 total chances (120 putouts, 4 assists) without an error. Rudi is retired and lives with his wife Sharon, in The Villages, Florida. He is a long-time amateur radio operator with the call sign NK7U.

His father, Johann Rudolf Gruner (1680‚Äì1761), was pastor of Trachselwald, in the Bernese Emmenthal (1705), and later (1725) of Burgdorf, and a great collector of information relating to historical and scientific matters; his great Thesaurus topographico-historicus totius ditionis Bernensis (4 vols, folio, 1729‚Äì1730) still remains in manuscript, but in 1732 he published a small work entitled Deliciae urbis Bernae, while he possessed an extensive cabinet of natural history objects. Naturally such tastes had a great influence on the mind of his son, who was born at Trachselwald, and educated by his father and at the Latin school at Burgdorf, not going to Bern much before 1736, when he published a dissertation on the use of fire by the . In 1739 he qualified as a notary, in 1741 became the archivist of Hesse-Homburg, and in 1743 accompanied Prince Christian of Anhalt-Schaumburg to Silesia and the university of Halle. He returned to his native land before 1749, when he obtained a post at Thorberg, being transferred in 1764 to Landshut and Fraubrunnen. It was in 1760 that he published in 3 vols. at Bern his chief work, Die Eisgebirge des Schweizerlandes (bad French translation by M. de K√©ralio, Paris, 1770). The first two volumes are filled by a detailed description of the snowy Swiss mountains, based not so much on personal experience as on older works, and a very large number of communications received by Gruner from numerous friends; the third volume deals with glaciers in general, and their various properties.

Crombie is most famous for its luxury coats ‚Äì so much so that the word 'Crombie' is sometimes used by other companies to refer to their own coats produced in the style of Crombie's most famous three-quarter length (usually wool) overcoats, although the Crombie company has been known to take legal action to prevent this trademark word from being used generically. History J&J; Crombie Ltd. was founded by John Crombie and his son James in Aberdeen, Scotland in 1805, making it one of Britain's oldest brands. Crombie has manufactured from several different mills in Scotland and England for over two centuries, initially at Cothal Mills in Aberdeen, and most famously from 1859 at Grandholm Mill also in Aberdeen. In 1990, production at the Grandholm Mill ceased, and was moved to other mills in Scotland and England. (The A-listed Grandholm factory site was converted into a residential project in 2005. Part of the mill is now an Indian restaurant called The Spice Mill, which has maintained the original elements of the factory.) Crombie began as a producer of luxury cloth, which it sold to cloth merchants and direct to London tailors. By the 1850s, Crombie had won quality awards from Queen Victoria and Napoleon III at the Great Exhibition in London and the Exposition Universelle in Paris respectively. Later, Crombie expanded from simply manufacturing the fabric for other producers, to creating coats under its own name. A key factor in Crombie's expansion, from the 1860s onwards, was the receipt of military contracts. Crombie supplied 'Rebel Grey' cloth for the Confederate Army in the American Civil War, and also supplied officers' uniforms to the British Army and Royal Air Force in the First and Second World Wars. Beginning in the early 1960s, Crombie coats were fashionable among mods, who saw them as a stylish item of clothing that enhanced their clean-cut image. It was an alternative to the popular fishtail parka or trenchcoat. As the 1960s wore on, and into the early 1970s, Crombie- style coats were popular within the skinhead and suedehead subcultures, although very few skinheads would have been able to afford a brand new Crombie coat. Crombie has long marketed itself at international statesmen and royalty. It has enjoyed particular success in Russia, where Crombie began supplying to the Tsarist court from 1880, and even in 1984 it was observed that Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev was wearing a Crombie coat when he visited Britain that December. Crombie lists King George VI, Winston Churchill, Cary Grant, Dwight D Eisenhower and John F Kennedy among its historic customers. From 1995 to 2004, Crombie also held the Royal Warrant as a supplier to the Prince of Wales. In 2014 it was announced the new Twelfth Doctor, as played by Peter Capaldi, will wear a Crombie with a red lining. The founding Crombie family sold their interest in the company in 1928, to another British textile family, the Salts (famous as the founders of Saltaire in West Yorkshire). After the Second World War, Crombie became part of Illingworth Morris ‚Äì at that time Britain's largest woollen textile company, of which British actress Pamela Mason was the majority shareholder. In the 1980s the company was taken private by its chairman. Crombie is also known to hold the rights to Savile Row suit tailor Tommy Nutter's brand name, having backed him financially in the 1980s and early 1990s. The company continues to trade today, and currently has three stand-alone stores: in London, Manchester and Edinburgh. Crombie is also sold through independent retailers, such as Harrods in Britain, and comparable department stores in North America, Europe and East Asia. Crombie also sells worldwide over its website.

It involved the three huge mines known as 'La Gran Mineria' and three smaller operations. The Chilean-owned smaller copper mines were not affected. The process started under the government of President Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo, and culminated during the government of President Salvador Allende, who completed the nationalization. This \\"act of sovereignty\\" was the espoused basis for a later international economic boycott, which further isolated Chile from the world economy, worsening the state of political polarization that led to the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat. The mines involved in the nationalization By the late 1950s, the three principal copper mines in Chile were Chuquicamata, El Salvador, and El Teniente. Chuquicamata and El Salvador were owned by the Anaconda Copper Company and El Teniente was owned by the Kennecott Copper Corporation. The La Exotica mine, an adjunct of Chuquicamata, was added to these big mines in 1966.These large mines were mainly self-contained and self-sustaining settlements with their own cities to house their workers, their own water and electrical plants, their own schools, stores, railways, and even in certain cases their own police forces. Three other mines were eventually nationalized, Cerro de Pasco's Andina operation, which went to Codelco, and the two mines, Los Bronces and El Soldado, owned by Pe√±arroya's Disputada de las Condes, which were bought by ENAMI. Evidently these mines did not fit in with ENAMI's plans and Disputada de las Condes was subsequently sold (at a substantial profit) to Exxon Minerals. Second stage of nationalization On June 26, 1969, President Eduardo Frei Montalva signed an agreement with the Anaconda Copper Company, the Kennecott Utah Copper company, and the Cerro company.(which was afterwards ratified by Congress). In this agreement, the government acquired the 51% of the Kennecott‚Äôs shares and 25% of the shares in both Anaconda and Cerro, allowing the U.S. to maintain some level of control in this economic sector.Orville G. Cope, ‚ÄúThe 1965 Congressional Election in Chile: An Analysis,‚Äù Journal of Inter-American Studies 10, no. 2 (1968): pg. 266-267, https://doi.org/10.2307/165390. This process was known as \\"negotiated nationalization\\", and was designed to avoid a conflict with international investors (and ultimately with the United States) and to allow for the acquisition of the technical, financial and marketing knowledge of the multinationals. A similar process was used to acquire a dominant ownership over the rest of the copper industry. In the agreement, it was established that the Chilean government could buy within the next 13 years (counting from 1970) the remaining 49% of the foreign ownership from the multinational corporations, but only after having paid at least 60% of the current debt due from the purchase of the original 51%. It also fixed a clear formula for the valuation of the assets to be bought, for the liquidation of profits, for the increase of direct investment in new works, and related issues. Third stage of nationalization The process of \\"negotiated nationalization\\" met with vociferous criticism from the leftist political parties, and from a section of the President's own Christian Democratic Party. The idea was accused of bowing to American imperialism, being too slow and too expensive. In the 1970 presidential election, the outright nationalization without compensation (known as the Chileanization of copper) became one of the main campaign issues. Two out of the three presidential candidates incorporated the idea into their political platforms, while the third opted for a faster version of the \\"negotiated nationalization\\". After socialist candidate Salvador Allende won the election, he promised to deal with the issue head-on. In fact, at the beginning of 1971, he sent Congress a project for a constitutional amendment that would allow him to nationalize outright all mines, and to transfer all present and future copper fields to the state. Congress passed this amendment on July 11, 1971, by a unanimous vote, by Simon Collier and William F. Sater and based on it, on July 16, 1971 law 17.450 was promulgated, and became effective immediately. The event was celebrated as the Day of National Dignity ().Speech of Salvador Allende on July 11, 1971 In principle, there was complete agreement about the process of nationalization of the mines among all political parties represented in the Chilean Congress, as indicated by the unanimous vote that approved law 17.450. When it came down to the particulars, however, there was much concern about the political use that the Allende administration would make of it. Even so, the bigger concern was for the expected reaction of the U.S. government. Compensation Originally, the expropriation was based on the book value of the properties. Nevertheless, the Allende administration introduced the idea of \\"excessive profits\\" into the calculation of indemnization for the mines. This idea was based on the concept that the multinational corporations had reaped profits far in excess of what was considered \\"normal business practice\\". The way this was done was by comparing copper profits in Chile with the companies' profits elsewhere in the world. It was calculated that twelve percent was the worldwide profit rate for these companies, and that they had made $774 million above this in Chile from 1955 to 1970: \\"This deduction exceeded the book value of the companies' properties\\". In October 1971, the General Controller's office handed down the calculations of the indemnizations due, in line with the parameters established by the Constitutional Amendment. According to this document, the American companies were not to receive any compensation for the Chuquicamata, El Salvador and El Teniente mines, and only a very small one for the rest of their properties. The U.S. government reaction was immediate. The United States Department of State declared: \\"This serious infraction to international practice can cause damage not only to Chile, but to all other developing countries.\\" Aftermath The nationalized Chilean mines were kept under state control after Pinochet's 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat, despite the junta's pro-U.S. leanings, and this is still the case, largely because of public sentiment and because Codelco is a major contributor to the Chilean Exchequer. Codelco pays income tax, all dividends go to the government and it also pays a 10% tax on the export value of copper products and associated byproducts according to Law 13,136. Article 1 of the Chilean Mining CodeThe Chilean Mining Code states that \\"The State has absolute, exclusive, inalienable and imprescriptible ownership of all mines\\" but goes on to say that anyone may prospect for and establish concessions or mining rights for the search or mining of substances. As well as the Mining Code, foreign investors have to observe Decree Law No. 600 which deals with foreign investment and investment contracts.Decree Law No 600 This allows tax invariability for 10 years from start of production, access to the foreign exchange market and the right to return capital actually brought into the country without being taxed. The tax invariability can be extended to 20 years for companies bringing in US$50 million or more. In return for these concessions foreign investors have to pay a combined tax rate of 42% compared with the current 35%. They may change, but once only, to the current mining tax regime but most have opted for the higher tax rate because gives more certainty to financial planning. On June 16, 2005, Law 20.026 was published in Chile's Official Gazette (Diario Oficial). The Law establishes a specific tax on mining activities, which came in force on January 1, 2006 consisting of a sliding scale according to copper production from nothing below 12,000 tonnes p.a. to 5% above 50,000 tonnes p.a. on production in excess of 12,000 tonnes p.a. Foreign companies that signed a DL 600 contract before Dec 1 2004 and are still liable to 42% tax are not affected by this. Companies bringing in US$50 million or more now can be granted invariability of mining taxation but must pay normal income tax. They must also submit their annual financial statements to external audit and to the Securities and Insurance Supervisor as well as their quarterly statements and an annual report on the property. Mining companies are generally granted concessions to allow them to recoup their initial capital expenditures because of the risky nature of mining. The most important of these in Chilean law are organisation and startup expenses, interest expense, technical assistance, tax losses and asset depreciation, which may be accelerated.Cochilco, legislation This gives rise to a long initial tax free period and the suspicion that they are avoiding tax.

Kennedy Space Center During the Space Shuttle program, the structures at the Launch Complex 39 pads contained a two-piece access tower system, the Fixed Service Structure (FSS) and the Rotating Service Structure (RSS). The FSS permitted access to the Shuttle via a retractable arm and a \\"beanie cap\\" to capture vented LOX from the external tank.

The FSS on Pad 39A was constructed from most of the top of the umbilical tower of Mobile Launcher 2, while the FSS that was on 39B was constructed from most of the top of the umbilical tower of Mobile Launcher 3 (Mobile Launcher 3 would later become Mobile Launcher Platform 1 for the Shuttle). In 2011 NASA removed both the fixed and rotating service structures from their pad at LC-39B to make way for a new generation of launch vehicles. Likewise in 2017-2018 SpaceX removed the rotating service structure from LC-39A and modified the fixed service structure to adapt it for the new series of launch vehicles to be launched there. Certain rockets such as the Delta and the Saturn V use structures consisting of a fixed portion, formally called the umbilical tower and a mobile portion, which is moved away from the vehicle several hours before launch called mobile service tower/structure.

Hula Valley farmland The Hula Valley (, translit. Emek Ha-·∏§ula; also transliterated as Huleh Valley, ) is an agricultural region in northern Israel with abundant fresh water, which used to be Lake Hula, prior to its draining. It is a major stopover for birds migrating along the Syrian-African Rift Valley between Africa, Europe, and Asia. Lake Hula and the marshland surrounding it were a breeding ground for mosquitoes carrying malaria, and so were drained in the 1950s.The Drainage of the Hula Swamps, Yehuda Karmon A small section of the valley was later re-flooded in an attempt to revive a nearly extinct ecosystem. An estimated 500 million migrating birds now pass through the Hula Valley every year.The Hula Reserve Etymology Lake Hula was historically referred to by different names. The 14th century BCE Egyptians called the lake Samchuna, while the Hebrew Bible records it as Merom. In the 1st century CE, the Jewish-Roman historian Flavius Josephus termed it Semechonitis (), John Lightfoot writing it as Samochonitis,John Lightfoot, From the Talmud and Hebraica, Vol. 1, p. 139 while in the Talmud it is called Yam Sumchi ‚Äì i.e. Sea of Sumchi. Currently the lake is called Buheirat el Huleh in Arabic and Agam ha-Hula in Hebrew, stemming from the Aramaic Hulata or Ulata. The \\"Waters of Merom\\" has sometimes been used in scientific literature, although that term refers specifically to springs on the western side of the valley. Geography and climate Water buffalo grazing in Hula Valley :For geological aspects see Dead Sea Transform#Hula Basin The Hula Valley lies within the northern part of the Syrian-African Rift Valley at an elevation of about 70 meters above sea level, and covers an area of 177 square kilometers (25 km by 6‚Äì8 km). On both sides of the valley are steep slopes: the Golan Heights to the east and the Upper Galilee's Naftali mountains to the west rise to 400 to 900 meters above sea level. Basalt hills of about 200 meters above sea level along the southern side of the valley intercept the Jordan River, and are commonly referred to as the basalt \\"plug\\", the Korazim block, or Korazim plateau (actually a temporary geologic base level), as they restrict water drainage downstream into the Sea of Galilee. The Hula Valley has a Mediterranean climate of hot dry summers and cool rainy winters, although its enclosure within two mountain ranges leads to more extreme seasonal and daily temperature fluctuations than in coastal areas. Annual rainfall varies greatly between different parts of the valley and ranges from about 400 millimeters in the south of the valley, to up to 800 millimeters in the north of the valley. More than 1,500 millimeters of precipitation falls on the Hermon mountain range, only a few kilometers north of the valley, mostly in the form of snow, feeding underground springs, including the sources of the Jordan River (Nahr Hasbani, also known as the \\"Upper Jordan\\" river, the Banias river, the Dan river and the brook el- Malaha), all eventually flowing through the valley, and which, before its drainage, could not easily be distinguished because of the marsh. The wind regime is dominated by regional patterns in the winter with occasional strong north-easterly wind storms known in Arabic as Sharkiyah. G. Schumacher, visiting the region in 1883, described the Hula valley in the following terms: > Ard el Huleh. The whole country of the marshes of the Huleh Lake, a swampy > territory thickly overgrown with papyrus. It abounds in snipe, wild ducks, > francolins and many other kinds of birds, and is consequently much resorted > to by the hunter, but as carefully avoided by the inhabitants on account of > the noxious fever. History Prior to its drainage in the early 1950s, Lake Hula was long and wide, extending over 12-14 square kilometers. It was about deep in summer and deep in winter. The marsh-like lake was fed by a number of perennial springs.William McClure Thomson, The land and the Book; or, Biblical illustrations drawn from the manners and customs, scenes and scenery of the Holy Land, Volume 1, New York 1859, p. 320 The lake attracted human settlement from early prehistoric times. Paleolithic archaeological remains were found near the \\"Daughters of Jacob Bridge\\" at the southern end of the valley. The first permanent settlement, Enan (Mallaha), dates from 9,000-10,000 years ago and was discovered in the valley. The Hula Valley was a main junction on the important trade route connecting the large commercial centre of Damascus with the Eastern Mediterranean coast and Egypt. During the Bronze Age, the cities of Hazor and Laish were built at key locations on this route approximately 4,000 years ago. At some point the area came under the control of the Israelites, until it was captured by the Neo-Assyrian Empire's armies under Tiglath-Pileser III (reigned 745‚Äì727 BC) and its inhabitants were driven away. The Bible records the Waters of Merom, a lake in the valley, as the site of a victory of Joshua over the Canaanites.Book of Joshua 11:5-7 Throughout the Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine and early Arab periods (fourth century BCE to eighth centuries CE) rural settlement in the Hula Valley was uninterrupted. During the Seleucid Empire, the town Seleucia Samulias was founded on the lake shore. Traditional crops were rice (as early as the Hellenistic period), cotton and sugar cane (brought by the Arabs following their conquest in 636), sorghum and maize (brought after the discovery of the Americas). Water buffalo were introduced in the eighth century supplying milk and serving as beasts of burden. Hula 1869 map In the 19th century, the valley, mainly marshy ground and a shallow lake, was inhabited by Ghawaraneh BedouinThomson, W.M. (1872) The Land and the Book; or Biblical Illistrations drawn from the manners and customs, the scenes and scenery of The Holy Land. T. Nelson & son. p. 253 who wove matting from the papyrus with which they built their homes. John MacGregor, a Victorian adventurer, was captured with his boat, the \\"Rob Roy\\", by dark-skinned Bedouin living in the Hula marshes. He was responsible for the first modern maps of the area.History of the Hula Valley Mortality rates were very high due to the spread of malaria. In 1882, a traveler wrote that the region was \\"among the finest hunting grounds in Syria,\\" home to \\"panthers, leopards, bears, wild boars, wolves, foxes, jackals, hyenas, gazelles and otters.\\" During World War II, officers of the British Army wrote about hunting birds there. In 1908, the Ottoman government granted a concession to drain the marsh to a French firm, which sold it to Lebanese businessmen. In 1933, during the British Mandate, the Zionist Palestine Land Development Company was awarded this concession by the Mandatory government and drew up plans to drain and irrigate the valley which brought scientific expeditions to the area. A visitor to the area in the 1930s reported that the villages in the area harvested the papyrus for weaving. They used two distinct styles of loom: one for fine mats for interior use, and a second producing longer, coarser mats which were used for constructing huts and shelters. The first modern Jewish settlement in the Hula Valley, Yesud HaMa'ala on the western shore of the lake, was established in 1883 during the First Aliyah. In 1948 there were 35 villages in the Hula Valley, 12 Jewish and 23 Arab. File:Hooleh Huts v.jpgBuildings circa 1885 ◊ë◊ì◊ï◊ê◊ô◊ï◊™ ◊¢◊ù ◊û◊ó◊¶◊ú◊ï◊™-JNF021859.jpegHula.

In 1955 the Israeli government invited John Zuckerman to visit Israel as advisor on a project. It was achieved by two main engineering operations: the deepening and widening of the Jordan River downstream; and two newly-dug peripheral canals diverting the Jordan at the north of the valley. The drying out caused the extinction of the unique endemic fauna of the lake, including the cyprinid fish Acanthobrama hulensis and cichlid fish Tristramella intermedia. Though perceived at the time as a great national achievement for Israel, with the advent of the modern environmental movement, it became evident that the transformation of the swamp into agricultural land involved significant trade offs and had effects on the ecosystem that had not been perceived in the first half of the twentieth century, when the major concerns had been the reduction of malaria-bearing mosquitoes and improving economic productivity. In 1963, a small (3.50 km¬≤) area of recreated papyrus swampland in the southwest of the valley was set aside as the country's first nature reserve. Concern over the draining of the Hula was the impetus for the creation of the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel. Draining the Hula turned out to be a mixed blessing. Water polluted with chemical fertilizers began flowing into Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), lowering the quality of its water. The soil, stripped of natural foliage, was blown away by strong winds in the valley, and the peat of the drained swamp ignited spontaneously, causing underground fires that were difficult to extinguish. Eventually part of the valley was transformed back into a wetland habitat. Hula Nature Reserve Feeding migrating Common crane in Agamon Hula Nature reserve The work of a number of scientists and nature lovers made it possible for at least a small part of Hula's wetlands to be preserved. In 1964 the Hula Nature Reserve was officially inaugurated.Official webpage of the Hula Nature Reserve at the Israel National Parks Authority website The Hula Nature Reserve is listed by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, as a Wetland of International Importance.http://www.ramsar.org/sites-countries/the-ramsar- sites Hula Lake Park Flocks of migrating birds Hula Lake Park, known in Hebrew as Agmon HaHula (Hebrew: ), is located in the southern part of the Hula Valley, north of the nature reserve and distinct from it. It was established as part of a JNF rehabilitation project. In the early 1990s part of the valley was flooded again in the wake of heavy rains. It was decided to develop the surrounding area and leave the flooded area intact. The new site has become the second home for thousands of migrating birds in the autumn and spring. The lake covers an area of one square kilometer, interspersed with islands that serve as protected bird nesting sites. It has become a major stopover for migrating birds flying from Europe to Africa and back, and also a major birdwatching site. In 2011, Israeli ornithologists confirmed that Lake Hula is the stopover point for tens of thousands of cranes migrating from Finland to Ethiopia every winter. In Israel, farmers set out food for them to keep them from damaging crops near the lake. Return of Hula painted frog Female of the Critically Endangered Hula painted frog In November 2011 the Hula painted frog, classified as extinct since 1996 by the IUCN as a result of the marsh drainage, reappeared to park patrollers in HaHula. The reappearance was confirmed by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority. Since the discovery of the first specimen at least ten more have been found, all in the same area. The IUCN has accordingly reclassified the species as critically endangered. Archaeology Archaeological findings in 2009 show that the hominids who inhabited the area exploited Lake Hula fish. Analysis of the fish remains recovered from the archaeological site of Gesher Benot Ya‚Äòaqov (GBY) have shown that they exploited a wide range of fish including catfish, tilapia and carp. Some of the carp were over a meter long. Tools to light fires and crack nuts were also discovered at the site.

Early life Jean was the eldest child of Guy Vivian Metcalfe, a railway clerk with the Southern Railway at Waterloo station, and Gwendoline Annie, n√©e Reed. Her family were a typical lower-middle-class family of the time. Their house had no bathroom and they used her father's Southern Railway privilege tickets to get them to their most ambitious holiday destination, Cornwall. She excelled at elocution and art at the local county school, and formed a passionate love of the radio at home. She joined the Children's Hour radio circle, and entered competitions which entitled the winners to visit Broadcasting House, headquarters of the BBC. She excelled at school dramatics, and once played Queen Victoria. Career Leaving school in 1939, she went to secretarial college and then applied for a job at the BBC in 1940. By bending the truth on her CV, inventing grandparents in Norfolk and describing her father's occupation as a \\"welfare officer\\", she succeeded in getting a job with the variety department, being paid ¬£2 5s. 6d. (¬£2.27¬Ω) a week. Her first broadcast was on 21 May 1941, reading the poem \\"Spring, the Sweet Spring\\" by Thomas Ashe for the Empire Service programme Books and People. Forces Favourites She was auditioned as an announcer for the new BBC General Forces Programme, a joint BBC‚ÄìWar Office venture which was the BBC's first worldwide service and the first to use female announcers. She joined the BBC Africa Service, and began her long period with the programme that made her a household name: Forces Favourites, later renamed Family Favourites. This was a request programme in which members of the armed forces abroad, and their families at home, could ask the \\"comp√®re\\" to play a favourite piece of music. She began the job after five hours of study with the programme's editor Margaret Hubble. She last presented the programme as a Christmas special on Radio 2 in 1985. Personal life Whilst doing the programme from London Metcalfe met her male colleague at the Hamburg end of the operation, Squadron Leader Arthur Clifford (Cliff) Michelmore. They married on 4 March 1950. By this time, the programme had changed its name to the peacetime Two-Way Family Favourites. They had two children: actress Jenny Michelmore and the broadcaster and composer Guy Michelmore. Woman's Hour From August 1950, Metcalfe presented Woman's Hour on the BBC Light Programme. At the time, the programme had a long list of forbidden topics. Self-effacing and gently spoken, she pioneered the art of interviewing stars in their own homes, including the wartime 'forces sweetheart' singer Vera Lynn, the irascible television personality Gilbert Harding, the song and dance man Frankie Vaughan and the stiff-upper-lipped film actor Kenneth More. The Daily Mail made her broadcasting personality of the year in 1955, and she won a Variety Club of Great Britain radio personality award in 1963. Later life Metcalfe gave up broadcasting in 1967 to devote her time to her family and did not return full-time until 1971, when she presented If You Think You've Got Problems, a programme in which a broad range of human problems were discussed, many of which would not have been allowed to be aired when she began her association with Woman's Hour. The programme continued until 1979, although the BBC objected to one of her programmes, on lesbianism, as it would be going out on a Sunday. On TV, she made her d√©but with Robert Beatty in Saturday Night Out and did guest spots for Juke Box Jury and BBC daytime magazines Wednesday Magazine and Family Affairs. In 1986 she published an autobiography with her husband, Two-Way Story. Death In retirement Metcalfe lived with her husband in the West Sussex village of South Harting. She died in 2000, and her body was buried in the graveyard of the church of Saint Mary & Saint Gabriel in South Harting.

Martin was ordained a priest in 1969 and represented the Holy See at major United Nations International Conferences before becoming the Archbishop of Dublin in 2004. Martin has dealt with Catholic sex abuse cases in his tenure as Archbishop. Early life and education Diarmuid Martin was raised and educated in Dublin, at the Oblate school in Inchicore, the De La Salle School situated on the Ballyfermot Road in Ballyfermot, and Marian College, Ballsbridge. He went to University College Dublin, where he studied philosophy, and then went to the Dublin Diocese's seminary at Holy Cross College (Dublin), where he studied theology. He entered Clonliffe seven days before the opening of the Second Vatican Council on 11 October 1962. He was ordained a priest on 25 May 1969 by Archbishop John Charles McQuaid. Martin is also an alumnus of the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas Angelicum where he pursued further studies. The Archbishop's brother, Seamus Martin, is the retired International Editor of The Irish Times newspaper. Work for the Holy See In 1976, Martin entered the service of the Holy See, working for the Pontifical Council for the Family. He later worked on the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, was appointed Under Secretary in 1986 and Secretary in 1994. On 6 January 1999 he was consecrated titular Bishop of Glendalough by Pope John Paul II. On 17 January 2001, he was appointed titular Archbishop of the same see when he was appointed the Holy See's Permanent Observer at the United Nations Office at Geneva and other Specialised Agencies there, including the World Trade Organization. In this capacity, he represented the Holy See at various UN conferences, including the International Conference on Population and Development. He led the delegations of the Holy See to the Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (Doha, 2001), the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance. During the 1990s, Martin represented the Holy See at major United Nations International Conferences, spoke about the Church's teachings on social matters at a variety of Episcopal Conferences, and was a member of various Vatican Offices, including the Central Committee for the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000. Also, he was involved in discussions between the World Council of Churches and the Catholic Church as well as the World Faiths Development Dialogue. He represented the views of the Holy See to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, where he advocated for debt relief for less developed countries. Archbishop of Dublin Martin was appointed Co-Adjutor to Cardinal Desmond Connell on 3 May 2003 and was installed on 30 August. On 26 April 2004, following the acceptance of Cardinal Connell's resignation by Pope John Paul II, Martin automatically succeeded him as Archbishop of Dublin. Traditional Latin Mass Following Pope Benedict XVI's decree Summorum Pontificum liberalising the use of the Latin Mass, which took effect on 14 September 2007, Martin established a Latin Mass Chaplaincy in the Dublin City area.Irish archbishop sets up traditionalist chaplaincy. New Liturgical Movement. Published 19 September 2007. Gay priests In 2005 Martin said that being gay should not prevent a man becoming a Catholic priest. He said: \\"You don't write off a candidate for the priesthood simply because he is a gay man\\". He discussed the admission of homosexuals to the priesthood in the context of the sexual abuse of minors by priests: \\"You have to say that horrendous damage was done to people. Then you need to take steps to ensure this will never happen again.\\" He noted that \\"you cannot identify homosexuality with paedophilia\\" and that paedophilia is \\"not the result of homosexuality, nor is it a result of celibacy\\". His remarks preceded the Congregation for Catholic Education's publication in November of a document on the same subject and later clarification that banned homosexuals who did not live chastely for at least three years. Missionary work In 2007, Martin announced that \\"a Catholic Church representative will visit every household in the Dublin Archdiocese next year.

At the same time, he said, he did not exclude homosexual relationships. Martin said: \\"I have a wide range of relationships in mind. I do not exclude gay relationships but my main concern is with all caring relationships where dependencies have come into being.\\" 50th International Eucharistic Congress At the end of the 49th International Eucharistic Congress held in Quebec in 2008, Pope Benedict XVI announced that the next International Eucharistic Congress would be held in Dublin in 2012, the second time that Dublin hosts the congress, the first being the 31st congress in 1932. On 11 November 2010, Pope Benedict met with Martin and members of the organising committee of the 50th Eucharistic Congress as well as participants in the plenary assembly of the Pontifical Committee for International Eucharistic Congresses in the Sala Clementina of the Apostolic Palace. In May 2012, Martin said that the congress which begins in Dublin on 10 June \\"will reflect the Church in Ireland today. It will not be a going back to the church of 1932 or any other period. ... Its strength will be the quality of people's faith, not numbers. It will be a congress of prayer\\". Credibility deficit of Church Archbishop Martin meeting Polish President Lech Kaczy≈Ñski Speaking in Dublin at a discussion organised by the Communion and Liberation lay Catholic movement, Martin said that, when the Church speaks, it faces a severe hindrance: \\"When I was younger, if you did your Leaving Certificate examination through the medium of Irish you got a bonus on your mark ‚Äì I think it was either a 10 per cent or 15 per cent ‚Äì just for that fact. Today for the church to make a credible statement on many aspects of public life or simply to talk about faith you start out with the opposite. You start out with a substantial percentage of credibility deficit.\\" He wondered: \\"How does one really begin to speak about faith? How does one attempt to reach out and lead young people on a journey of faith, when they in many ways have lost trust in a church which many young people find no longer just 'irrelevant' but ... in which many young people say they have very little confidence\\".Church faces credibility deficit, says archbishop. The Irish Times. Published 1 January 2009. Martin addressed this topic again on Holy Thursday 2009, saying that the two biggest problems facing young people were the Catholic Church's condemnation of gay couples and the question of suicide. He said that these were causing \\"a disconnect\\" which was causing \\"a dramatic and growing rift\\" between the Church and the younger generation. He accepted that this was partly the Church's fault because young people were much more questioning today than previously and he urged his priests to offer services in the parish that would be geared more towards their particular concerns. He said that young people \\"see through the superficial answers we give\\".'Rift growing' between youths and the Church. The Irish Independent. Published 10 April 2009.

Urging the congregation to work to strengthen the fabric of society and make it more caring, he said self-indulgence could lead to corruption, total disregard for the rights of others, a breakdown of community and violence. Violence, he added, was \\"a continual threat to the harmony of society\\" in Ireland, was \\"profoundly anti-democratic\\" and attempted to \\"limit the effectiveness of community through a climate of fear\\". Speaking of \\"those whose mission it is to advance legislation which promotes harmony and equality and those whose mission it is to apply such laws and administer justice\\", he said: \\"Yours is a task of the spirit: to ensure that true communication in the fullest sense between people is not inhibited by the raw power of the self- interest of the few\\".Judges called on by churches to help create a just society.

Auxiliary Bishop Emeritus of Dublin Dermot O'Mahony said Martin had failed to support priests in the Dublin diocese following publication of the Murphy report. \\"The archbishop did nothing to counteract the statement of the Murphy report, widely circulated in the media, that the majority of clergy knew and did nothing. Indeed, I feel he made matters worse by giving an example of a parish that could be clearly identifiable to the priests of the diocese,\\" wrote O‚ÄôMahony in letters sent to Martin and the Council of Priests. He added: \\"To suggest our approach failed to take cognisance of the safety of children is inaccurate and unjust. The acceptance by media and current diocese policy that a cover-up took place must be challenged\\".

A spokeswoman for Martin told The Irish Times that this letter to O‚ÄôMahony, which was dated 2 December 2009, had been sent following a detailed conversation between them. It was sent three days after a meeting of the diocesan council that discussed the Murphy report.

Archbishop Martin welcomed the pope's statement, describing it not as a final word but as \\"a further step in the process of renewal and healing in the Catholic Church in Ireland following the crisis of the sexual abuse of children\\". Martin said the pope acknowledged the suffering and betrayal experienced by survivors of clerical abuse. \\"The pope recognises the failures of Church authorities in how they dealt with sinful and criminal acts,\\" he said.Pope apologises to victims for 'grave errors' of church.

I never said people should stay. I ask for accountability. Resigning is a personal decision a person has to make on their own. People should be accountable, and render account of what they've done. Resignations are personal decisions.\\" Asked whether it was acceptable that Cardinal Brady did not stop Smyth after the 1975 investigation, he said Smyth \\"was not stopped by who had the power to stop him\\", and \\"somebody should have stopped him\\". In the same interview Martin was asked if he had been recently silenced by the church. He replied: \\"No, I haven't been asked to stop talking. I gave four major interviews in the last four weeks to Irish and international television.\\" Asked if he had been ostracised by other members of the church, he said: \\"I do things in my own way, which may not please everybody, but in no way was I ostracised. I have to maintain also my own independence of thought.\\"Martin refuses to call for cardinal's resignation. The Irish Times. Published 17 March 2010. =Apostolic visitation= In October 2010, the four metropolitan archbishops of Ireland, Michael Neary of Tuam, Se√°n Brady of Armagh, Diarmuid Martin of Dublin and Dermot Clifford of Cashel and Emly, met for high-level talks with heads of Vatican congregations regarding the apostolic visitation. This visitation was prompted by the publication of the Murphy and Ryan reports. While in Rome, the metropolitans met a team of investigators appointed by Pope Benedict to examine the four provinces and \\"some other as yet unspecified dioceses\\". The team included: the Cardinal- Archbishop Emeritus of Westminster, Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, who inspected Armagh; the Archbishop of Boston, Sean O'Malley, who inspected Dublin; the Archbishop of Toronto, Thomas Christopher Collins, who inspected Cashel; the Archbishop of Ottawa, Terrence Prendergast, who inspected Tuam. An investigation of the state of Irish seminaries will be conducted by Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York. The apostolic visitors reported their findings directly to Pope Benedict XVI. Archbishop Martin on 20 February 2011 said that the Church has a long way to journey in honesty before it merits forgiveness for the abuse of children. Archbishop Martin then made what victims said was the most explicit apology to date for the role of the Church hierarchy in enabling the abuse. Three of the victims held hands and sobbed as Martin poured water on their feet and Cardinal O'Malley dried them with a towel. During the service Archbishop Martin said \\"I can express my sorrow, my sense of the wrong that was done to you. I think of how you were not heard or not believed and not comforted and supported. I can ask myself how did this happen in the Church of Jesus Christ where as we heard in the Gospel children are presented to us as signs of the kingdom. How did we not see you in your suffering and abandonment?\\" He continued: \\"Someone once reminded me of the difference between on the one hand apologising or saying sorry and on the other hand asking forgiveness. I can bump into someone on the street and say \\"Sorry\\". It can be meaningful or just an empty formula. When I say sorry I am in charge. When I ask forgiveness however I am no longer in charge, I am in the hands of the others. Only you can forgive me; only God can forgive me. I, as Archbishop of Dublin and as Diarmuid Martin, stand here in this silence and I ask forgiveness of God and I ask for the first steps of forgiveness from all of the survivors of abuse.\\" =Comments on Vatican response to report= In May 2011 Archbishop Martin emphasised he was not criticising Pope Benedict, but was encouraging a sense of urgency on the part of the Pope's \\"collaborators\\" in the Roman Curia. Speaking in Dublin he said the pace of change in Irish religious culture was such that \\"the longer the delay in advancing the fruits of the apostolic visitation, the greater the danger of false expectations, and the greater the encouragement to those who prefer immobilism to reform, and the greater the threat to the effectiveness of this immense gift of the Holy Father to the Irish Church\\". He was \\"impatient to learn about the path that the apostolic visitation will set out for renewal for the Irish Church so that our renewal will move forward decisively. At the same time, I am also becoming increasingly impatient at the slowness in the process, which began over a year ago. This is not a criticism of the Holy Father. It is an appeal to his collaborators.\\" His \\"greatest concern\\" was \\"the rift which is growing between the church and young people\\". Church role in education In March 2010, Martin welcomed an announcement by Minister for Education Batt O'Keeffe that his department \\"will shortly be providing an initial list of about 10 urban areas that can be used to test the concept of reducing the number of Catholic schools\\". Martin also said that solutions would have to be found to respect the rights of teachers \\"who do not wish to be involved in religious education\\". He welcomed the fact that \\"the Minister has indicated that there will be consultations with parents, teachers and local communities\\". Minister O'Keefe said that \\"the issue of the Catholic Church divesting itself of certain schools was originally explicitly raised by Archbishop Diarmuid Martin and it has also found expression in the work of the Bishops‚Äô Conference and through its engagement with my department.\\" He said that the archbishop's \\"public identification of this reality\\" was \\"a timely and important contribution not just to the future of Catholic schools but to the future of the primary sector generally,\\" he said. \\"In overall terms, I know it has been acknowledged that the Catholic primary sector, which currently represents over 90 per cent of overall provision, may ultimately fall to between 50 per cent and 60 per cent of overall provision and that this percentage of overall provision will still be enough to allow the church fulfil its expressed commitment to meet the needs of parents who wish their children to have a Catholic education.\\" Comments on the Cloyne report On 13 July 2011 the report in the sexual abuse in the diocese of Cloyne was published. Archbishop Martin said on reading his report that his \\"first emotion that came to me was anger\\". Archbishop Martin warned that further investigations of clerical child sex abuse in dioceses will not get to the truth if people in the Catholic Church are not prepared to tell the truth. Senior church figures who were not prepared to be honest would only be \\"discovered\\" through an \\"invasive\\" audit of child protection practices in their dioceses, he said. He said the Vatican, in responding to the findings of last week's report on child abuse cases in the Cloyne diocese, should reiterate its support for the Irish church in applying existing \\"norms\\", or rules, on child protection. The Vatican should also support the reporting of cases to the State authorities and the carrying out of audits to show exactly where the situation was in relation to child protection. He acknowledged that people could feel deceived by the church. He said the norms set down by the present pope in 2001 had been ignored in the Cloyne diocese. \\"What sort of a cabal is in there and still refusing to recognise the norms of the church?\\" he asked. All the other Irish bishops had put these norms into practice, \\"as far as I know\\", he added. Martin said six elderly priests were verbally abused at a colleague's funeral this week when someone challenged them, claiming they \\"should be ashamed of themselves\\". \\"Those who felt they were able to play tricks with norms, they have betrayed those good men and so many others in the church who are working today,\\" he said. Third Edition of the Roman Missal In August 2011 Archbishop Martin defended the new English translation of the Roman MissalOrder of Mass ‚Äì new translation entering into force by Advent 2011. A gradual introduction of the missal began at Masses in Ireland from 11 September. The new translation came into full use throughout Ireland and the English-speaking Catholic world on the first Sunday of Advent, 27 November 2011. In a letter to the priests of the Dublin diocese the August before, Martin said that since the prior Roman Missal was introduced in 1975, \\"many additional texts have been made available for use. These include new Eucharistic prayers for reconciliation I and II, and for Masses for various needs I to IV, Masses for the Blessed Virgin Mary, Masses for new feasts of saints, and other new material.\\" Those familiar with translations in other languages had come to realise \\"that often there were key phrases and rich biblical allusions missing from the English translation\\" in the current missal, he said. Also, \\"some theological vocabulary had been lost in the 1975 edition\\" and the new missal \\"addresses some of these weaknesses\\". Changes to the wording of the Confiteor, the Gloria and the Creed are included in the new Roman Missal. 2014 Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops Martin gave a speech at the Synod and said later that the bishops' Synod on the Family must show that church teaching can develop so it can respond to the difficulties faced by ordinary Catholics. \\"This synod can't simply repeat what was said 20 years ago,\\" Archbishop Martin told journalists at a briefing in the Vatican halfway through the two weeks of discussions. \\"It has to find new language to show that there can be development of doctrine, that there has been a willingness to listen to what emerged in the questionnaire that went out and what was said at the synod itself.\\" The questionnaire before the synod asked Catholics around the world a range of questions on family life including issues such as divorced and remarried couples, same-sex unions and contraception. Archbishop Martin said this Synod on the family had been very \\"different\\" but it would be misleading to suggest that it will lead to immediate change in relation to \\"celebrity\\" issues such as homosexuality and communion for the divorced, explaining: \\"There can be a development of doctrine in the sense that we can understand the same doctrine in a different way, but a change whereby, overnight, you say that what was wrong is now right, that is just not on the cards.\\" Martin said this Synod has been radically different because, thanks to Pope Francis, it has been marked by a genuine dialogue and an at times heated debate. However, he said the Pope has so far \\"given no indication as to where he stands on anything\\" for the reason that this is a three-year-long process that will be concluded only when the Pope himself issues his post-Synodal apostolic exhortation, after the second leg of this Family Synod in October 2015. Homeless initiative On 2 December 2014 Archbishop Martin offered to house some of the city's homeless people in church property, after a homeless man was found dead metres away from Leinster House, one of the parliament buildings. The body of 42-year-old Jonathan Corrie was found by a passer-by in a doorway in November 2014. Archbishop Martin said one of his diocesan buildings could be made suitable before Christmas to provide shelter for between 30 and 40 homeless people in the inner city. Islam Archbishop Martin has said that 2016 comments by Raymond Cardinal Burke on Islam's supposed desire to \\"govern the world\\" are unhelpful at a time when Europe reels in the aftermath of a spate of terror attacks. The archbishop decried the murder of French priest, Fr. Jacques Hamel, in Normandy as \\"something that no religion would stand over,\\" adding that the atrocity in the small parish church of Saint Etienne du Rouvray has been \\"horrifying to everyone\\" and that people have been \\"absolutely stunned by the brutality\\" of it. Speaking from Poland where he was attending World Youth Day, Martin stressed that education is the basis for real tolerance as well as knowledge and respect for other religions. While Burke, in an interview on his new book, said that Islam seeks to govern the world and that the only way to save Western civilization is to return it to its Christian roots, Martin countered: \\"I don't think that helps at all.\\" He added, \\"Does Islam want to rule the world? There may be some people of the Islamic faith who do, but Islam itself has another side within it -- a caring and a tolerant side.\\" Abortion On 6 January 2019, Martin called for caution in constructing anti-abortion protests outside of abortion clinics. \\"I'm not a person personally for protest,\\" he said. \\"What the Church should be doing is strengthening its resolve to help women in crisis and to educate people.\\" Martin also called for protections for medical workers who refused to assist with abortions due to conscientious objections. Future of the Church in Ireland Archbishop Martin said in a speech on the future of the Church on 10 May 2010 that the Gospel reminds \\"us that the Father would send the Spirit who, at each moment in the history of the Church, would teach us all things in Jesus' name. In that sense I cannot be pessimistic about the future of the Church in Ireland.\\" He continued saying that \\"The future of the Catholic Church in Ireland will see a very different Catholic Church in Ireland. I sometimes worry when I hear those with institutional responsibility stress the role of the institution and others then in reaction saying that 'we are the Church'. Perhaps on both sides there may be an underlying feeling that 'I am the Church', that the Church must be modelled on my way of thinking or on my position. Renewal is never our own creation. Renewal will only come through returning to the Church which we have received from the Lord.\\"Archbishop Martin Addresses Knights On Church teaching, Archbishop Martin said that, \\"There are further challenges to be addressed regarding Church teaching. Within the Church and outside of it discussion focuses around challenges in the area of sexual morality where the Church's teaching is either not understood or is simply rejected as out of tune with contemporary culture. There is on the other hand very little critical examination of some of the roots of that contemporary culture and its compatibility with the teaching of Jesus. The moral teaching of the Church cannot simply be a blessing for, a toleration of, or an adaptation to the cultural climate of the day.\\" On the need for greater evangelisation he said that \\"The use of modern media mechanisms to support the distribution of the Gospel is something important and innovative. In this context, we are very fortunate to have a group of scripture scholars who put their knowledge and personal perception of the scriptures at the service of parishes and bible study groups. This material is accessible to any individual who would wish to avail of it on the website www.yearofevangelisation.ie.\\" On 20 February 2011, he made what was regarded by abuse survivors as his most explicit apology yet.\\"Archbishop Martin makes explicit apology\\". RT√â. 20 February 2011. At a talk on the future of Irish Catholicism on 22 February 2011 for the Cambridge Group for Irish Studies, Magdalene College, Cambridge, Archbishop Martin said that \\"there are parishes in Dublin where the presence at Sunday Mass is some 5% of the Catholic population and, in some cases, even below 2%. On any particular Sunday about 18% of the Catholic population in the Archdiocese of Dublin attends Mass. That is considerably lower than in any other part of Ireland.\\" He continued saying: \\"(That) the conformist Ireland of the Archbishop McQuaid era changed so rapidly and with few tears, was read as an indication of a desire for change, but perhaps it was also an indication that the conformism was covering an emptiness and a faith built on a faulty structure to which people no longer really ascribed\\" and that \\"The Catholic Church in Ireland will inevitably become more a minority culture. The challenge is to ensure that it is not an irrelevant minority culture\\".Address by Archbishop Diarmuid Martin to the Cambridge Group for Irish Studies, Magdalene College, Cambridge 2011 general election comments Archbishop Martin in February 2011 called on Christians in Ireland to be vocal about the values they want for \\"a caring\\" society. Addressing a church celebration of the World Day of the Sick in Clontarf, Archbishop Martin said: \\"We stand at an important moment regarding the future of our Irish society.\\" He continued saying \\"In a climate marked too often only by criticism and mud-slinging, we Christians are called to drive for a sense of common purpose regarding the type of society we wish our political leaders to generate and the values that we would wish to see enshrined in that society.\\" Shortly afterwards the Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference released a guide to voters for the general election. 2015 Same Sex Marriage Referendum In response to the passing of the thirty-fourth amendment of the constitution of Ireland, which inserted a clause into the Irish Constitution permitting same sex marriage, Martin stated that \\"The church needs to take a reality check. It's very clear there‚Äôs a growing gap between Irish young people and the Church, and there‚Äôs a growing gap between the culture of Ireland that's developing and the Church.\\" See also Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal ReferencesExternal links * Catholic Hierarchy * Dublin Diocese Biography * Ferns Report * Diocese of Dublin Roman Catholic archbishops of Dublin Alumni of University College Dublin Alumni of Clonliffe College 1945 births Living people People from Dublin (city) Diplomats of the Holy See Roman Catholic titular archbishops Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace 20th-century Roman Catholics 21st-century Roman Catholics Catholic Church sexual abuse scandals in Ireland 21st-century Roman Catholic archbishops Post-Reformation Roman Catholic bishops in Ireland Titular bishops of Glendalough 20th-century Irish clergy 21st-century Irish clergy ","title":"Diarmuid Martin"},{"id":"1358693","text":"FKB may refer to: * The Flying Karamazov Brothers, an American performance troupe * French King Bridge, in Massachusetts, United States * Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden Airport, in Germany * FKB (band), a Canadian rock band ","title":"FKB"},{"id":"1358695","text":"The Caprotinia, or feasts of Juno Caprotina, were ancient Roman festivals which were celebrated on July 7, in favour of the female slaves.

It was based on the serial novel of the same title by Kaizan Nakazato. Plot The story follows the life of Ryunosuke Tsukue (Tatsuya Nakadai), an amoral samurai and a master swordsman with an unorthodox style. Ryunosuke is first seen when he kills an elderly Buddhist pilgrim who he finds praying for death. He appears to have no feeling. Later, he kills an opponent in self-defense in a fencing competition that was intended to be non-lethal, but became a duel after he coerced his opponent's wife to have sex with him in exchange for throwing the match and allowing her husband to win. His opponent finds out about the affair prior to the match, and is shown giving his wife a notice of divorce. His rage at Ryunosuke during the match causes him to take an illegal lunging attack after the judge proclaims a draw, and Ryunosuke, the better swordsman, parries and kills him with one stroke of his bokken. Ryunosuke flees town after killing the man, and cuts down many of the dead opponent's clansmen who attack him as he is leaving. His opponent's ex-wife asks to go along with him. Two years pass, and in order to make a living, Ryunosuke joins the Shinsengumi, a sort of semi-official police force made up of r≈çnin that supports the Tokugawa shogunate through murder and assassinations. Through all his interactions, whether killing a man or at home with his mistress and their baby son, Ryunosuke rarely shows any emotion. His expression is fixed in a glassy stare that suggests a quiet insanity. Eventually Ryunosuke learns that the younger brother of the man he killed in the fencing match is looking for him, intent on revenge. He plans to meet this young man and kill him, but before the duel can take place, two events occur that shake his confidence. In a botched assassination attempt, he sees another master swordsman, Shimada Toranosuke (Toshiro Mifune), in action, and for the first time he doubts that his own skill is truly unbeatable. That same night, Ryunosuke's mistress, horrified by his unremitting evil, tries to kill him in his sleep. He kills her in the gardens, to the ominous cries of their sleeping child inside the house, and flees without keeping his appointment to duel with his pursuer. Later he rejoins the gang of assassins at an oiran house (courtesan brothel) in the Shimabara district of Kyoto. There, in a quiet (and he is told, haunted) room, he starts seeing the ghosts of all the people he has killed. Further, he is haunted by the words of Shimada: \\"The sword is the soul. Study the soul to know the sword. Evil mind, evil sword.\\" The final blow comes when he realizes that the apprentice oiran sent to entertain him is the granddaughter of the pilgrim he murdered at the film's beginning. With this realization, Ryunosuke appears to descend into complete insanity. He starts slashing at the shadows of the ghosts that surround him, and then begins attacking his fellow assassins, who seem to number in the hundreds. Ryunosuke kills dozens of gang members in the burning courtesan house as they gradually wear him down with what few wounds they can inflict. Finally. it appears that Ryunosuke will surely be killed. Bleeding, his face contorted in rage, he lurches forward, raises his sword one last time, and the film ends; a freeze- frame catching Ryunosuke in mid sword-slash.

The novel originated from a newspaper serial, which appeared for three more decades; forty-one volumes were published before it was left uncompleted at the death of its author, Kaizan Nakazato. The film had previously been adapted in two part film by Hiroshi Inagaki in 1935. After the war, it was remade again, in three parts by Kunio Watanabe in 1953 and in three parts by Tomu Uchida between 1957 and 1959, and in three parts by Kenji Misumi and Kazuo Mori in 1960 and 1961. The Sword of Doom was an adaptation imposed on Kihachi Okamoto by Toho after the studio was dissatisfied with his film The Age of Assassins, a film completed in 1966 but only released in 1967. Release Sword of Doom was distributed by Toho and was released on February 25, 1966. The film was released with English subtitles in the United States by Toho International on February 25, 1966. A proposed sequel was never produced.

During a long and varied career he studied, published, and lectured on geology, conchology, entomology and philology. He once confided, \\"I never pursue one branch of science more than ten years, but lay it aside and go into new fields.\\" Biography Haldeman was born in Locust Grove, Pennsylvania on August 12, 1812, the oldest of seven children of Henry Haldeman and Frances Stehman Haldeman. Locust Grove was the family estate on the Susquehanna River, twenty miles below Harrisburg. His father was a prosperous businessman and his mother was an accomplished musician who died when Haldeman was twelve years old. In 1826, he was sent to Harrisburg to attend school at the Classical Academy, run by John M. Keagy. After two years in the academy, he enrolled at Dickinson College where his interest in natural history was encouraged by his professor, Henry Darwin Rogers, who would later become a distinguished geologist.Brinton 1881Mallis 1971 Two years after entering Dickinson, the college was forced to close temporarily and Peck left without earning a diploma.Dickinson College Archives 2005 After leaving school, Haldeman took over management of his father's new sawmill and became a silent partner with two of his brothers who started an iron manufacturing business in the area. He eventually became an authority on smelting iron. However, he was always drawn to science and often neglected the family businesses in pursuit of these interests. He later said, \\"I developed a taste for rainy weather and impassable roads; then I could remain undisturbed in the perusal of my books.\\" In 1833-1834 he attended lectures in the medical department at the University of Pennsylvania in order to better prepare himself for the study of natural history. In 1835, Haldeman wrote an article for the Lancaster Journal refuting the Great Moon Hoax, a sensational story claiming that life had been observed on the moon. That same year his former professor, Henry D. Rogers, was appointed state geologist of New Jersey and in 1836 he sent for Haldeman to assist him. A year later, on the reorganization of the Pennsylvania geological survey, Haldeman transferred there, and was actively engaged on the survey until 1842, preparing five annual reports, and personally surveying the counties of Dauphin and Lancaster. Samuel Stehman Haldeman During the 1840s, Haldeman's interests were focused on the natural history of invertebrates, especially the taxonomy of beetles and freshwater mollusks. In 1840 he began the publication of his Monograph of the Freshwater Univalve Mollusca of the United States, issued in nine parts with the final volume not appearing until 1866.Hart 1881 The monograph was well received by the scientific community in America and Europe. In an addendum he described Scolithus linearis, a trace fossil of some burrowing organism, the most ancient organic remains known at the time. In 1844 he wrote a paper, \\"Enumeration of the Recent Freshwater Mollusca Which are Common to North America and Europe\\", where he laid out in detail the case for Lamarckian evolution and transmutation of species. In 1861, Charles Darwin wrote in a preface to his On the Origin of Species an acknowledgment of Haldeman's ideas in support of evolution.Haldeman Mansion Preservation Society In 1842 he was instrumental in the establishment of the Entomological Society of Pennsylvania, the first scientific society formed to study insects in America. Haldeman's participation in the society put him in regular contact with other leading American entomologists including Frederick E. Melsheimer and John G. Morris.Sorenson 1995 His first entomological paper was the \\"Catalogue of the Carabideous Coleoptera of South Eastern Pennsylvania,\\" published in 1842. Over the next 15 years he published many papers on the systematics of beetles and other insects, describing many new species. His ear was remarkably sensitive, and he discovered a new organ of sound in lepidopterous insects, which was described by him in Benjamin Silliman's American Journal of Science in 1848. In 1852 he wrote a description of the insects collected by the Stansbury survey of the Great Salt Lake. In addition to his work on entomology, Haldeman accepted various college appointments to teach natural history. In 1842 he was a professor of zoology at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. From 1851 until 1855 he was professor of natural history at the University of Pennsylvania. He then accepted a similar professorship in Delaware College. Meanwhile, he also lectured on geology and chemistry at the State Agricultural College of Pennsylvania. He visited Texas in 1851 to investigate the presidency of an institution there, but declined the position. On his return trip from Texas, he was offered the position of president of Masonic College in Selma, Alabama, which he accepted and held from January to October 1852.Geiser 1945 In the 1850s, Haldeman's focus turned to the study of language. He carried out extensive research among Amerindian dialects, and also in Pennsylvania Dutch, besides investigations in the English, Chinese, and other languages. Haldeman was an earnest advocate of spelling reform. He was a member of many scientific societies, was the founder and president of the American Philological Association, and one of the early members of the National Academy of Sciences. In 1858 Haldeman was awarded the Trevelyan Prize, given by the Phonetic Society of Great Britain, for his article entitled ‚ÄúAnalytic Orthography‚Äù. He made numerous visits to Europe for purposes of research, and when studying the human voice in Rome determined the vocal repertoire of 40-50 varieties of human speech. In 1869, he returned to the University of Pennsylvania as professor of comparative philology and remained there until his death in 1880. In 1835, Haldeman married Mary A. Hough and the couple had two sons and two daughters. After the wedding, they moved to a new home at the base of Chickies Rock. He had designed the house and laid out the extensive gardens with native specimens of trees and shrubs. Raised a Protestant, Haldeman converted to Catholicism in the 1840s after undertaking a systematic study of different religions. He died suddenly of a heart attack on September 10, 1880 at his home in Chickies, Pennsylvania.Lesley 1881 Works He was the author of some 150 publications including important works on entomology, conchology, and philology. * A monograph of the Limniades and other freshwater univalve shells of North America.

The i sound in question is a phoneme i that appears in certain morphological circumstances for certain, lexically defined roots, regularly continuing Proto-Indo-European (PIE) laryngeals, as in > bhav-i-tum. Note that the PIE laryngeal (represented by an here) was a part of the PIE root; it occurs in all of its allomorphs, for example > bh≈´-ta-·∏• ( is reduced to in PIE due to ablaut; the laryngeal disappears in this context, leaving its trace in the length of ≈´ in Sanskrit). In Classical Sanskrit, the scope of this i was broadened by analogous change. In A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´ the synchronic analysis of the phenomenon is somewhat different: the i sound is treated as an augment (called ƒÅgama in the terminology of the later Paniniya school) of the suffix that follows the root. (The ·π≠ marker, defined in 1.1.46, indicates that the i should be appended at the beginning of the form, viz. the suffix.) For example the rule 7.2.35 states that i should be prepended to ƒÅrdhadhƒÅtuka suffixes beginning with a consonant other than y; an example of such suffix is -tum (the Classical Sanskrit infinitive); this rule is restricted by the following s≈´tras. Note that this analysis, being synchronic, does not contradict the diachronic analysis of PIE origin of the phenomenon. An example of differences between the two classes is the aorist- marker. While some of the ani·π≠-roots form aorist with the -s suffix, se·π≠-roots are suffixed by -i·π£.

The WLM branch of radical feminism, based in contemporary philosophy, comprised women of racially- and culturally-diverse backgrounds who proposed that economic, psychological, and social freedom were necessary for women to progress from being second-class citizens in their societies. Towards achieving the equality of women, the WLM questioned the cultural and legal validity of patriarchy and the practical validity of the social and sexual hierarchies used to control and limit the legal and physical independence of women in society. Women's liberationists proposed that sexism‚Äîlegalized formal and informal sex-based discrimination predicated on the existence of the social construction of gender‚Äîwas the principal political problem with the power dynamics of their societies. In general, the WLM proposed socio-economic change from the political left, rejected the idea that piecemeal equality, within and according to social class, would eliminate sexual discrimination against women, and fostered the tenets of humanism, especially the respect for human rights of all people. In the decades during which the women's liberation movement flourished, liberationists successfully changed how women were perceived in their cultures, redefined the socio-economic and the political roles of women in society, and transformed mainstream society.  Background  The wave theory of social development holds that intense periods of social activity are followed by periods of remission, in which the activists involved intensely in mobilization are systematically marginalized and isolated. After the intense period fighting for women's suffrage, the common interest which had united international feminists left the women's movement without a single focus upon which all could agree. Ideological differences between radicals and moderates, led to a split and a period of deradicalization, with the largest group of women's activists spearheading movements to educate women on their new responsibilities as voters. Organizations like the African National Congress Women's League, the Irish Housewives Association, the League of Women Voters, the Townswomen's Guilds and the Women's Institutes supported women and tried to educate them on how to use their new rights to incorporate themselves into the established political system. Still other organizations, involved in the mass movement of women into the workforce during World War I and World War II and their subsequent exit at the end of the war with concerted official efforts to return to family life, turned their efforts to labor issues. The World YWCA and Zonta International, were leaders in these efforts, mobilizing women to gather information on the situation of working women and organize assistance programs. Increasingly, radical organizations, like the American National Women's Party, were marginalized by media which denounced feminism and its proponents as \\"severe neurotics responsible for the problems of\\" society. Those who were still attached to the radical themes of equality were typically unmarried, employed, socially and economically advantaged and seemed to the larger society to be deviant. In countries throughout Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, the Middle East and South America efforts to decolonize and replace authoritarian regimes, which largely began in the 1950s and stretched through the 1980s, initially saw the state overtaking the role of radical feminists. For example, in Egypt, the 1956 Constitution eliminated gender barriers to labor, political access, and education through provisions for gender equality. Women in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Nicaragua and other Latin American countries had worked for an end to dictatorships in their countries. As those governments turned to socialist policies, the state aimed to eliminate gender inequality through state action. As ideology in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean shifted left, women in newly independent and still colonized countries saw a common goal in fighting imperialism. They focused their efforts to address gendered power imbalances in their quest for respect of human rights and nationalist goals. This worldwide movement towards decolonization and the realignment of international politics into Cold War camps after the end of World War II, usurped the drive for women's enfranchisement, as universal suffrage and nationhood became the goal for activists. A Pan-African awareness and global recognition of blackness as a unifying point for struggle, led to a recognition by numerous marginalized groups that there was potential to politicize their oppression. In their attempt to influence these newly independent countries to align with the United States, in the polarized Cold War climate, racism in U.S. policy became a stumbling block to the foreign policy objective to become the dominant superpower. Black leaders were aware of the favorable climate for securing change and pushed forward the Civil Rights Movement to address racial inequalities. They sought to eliminate the damage of oppression, using liberation theory and a movement which sought to create societal transformation in the way people thought about others by infusing the disenfranchised with political power to change the power structures. The Black Power movement and global student movements protested the apparent double standards of the age and the authoritarian nature of social institutions. From Czechoslovakia to Mexico, in diverse locations like Germany, France, Italy, and Japan, among others, students protested the civil, economic and political inequalities, as well as involvement in the Vietnam War. Many of the activists participating in these causes would go on to participate in the feminist movement. Socially, the baby boom experienced after World War II, the relative worldwide economic growth in the post-war years, the expansion of the television industry sparking improved communications, as well as access to higher education for both women and men led to an awareness of the social problems women faced and the need for a cultural change. At the time, women were economically dependent on men and neither the concept of patriarchy nor a coherent theory about the power relationships between men and women in society existed. If they worked, positions available to women were typically in light manufacturing or agricultural work and a limited segment of positions in the service industries, such as bookkeeping, domestic labor, nursing, secretarial and clerical work, retail sales, or school teaching. They were expected to work for lower wages than men and upon marriage, terminate their employment. Women were unable to obtain bank accounts or credit, making renting housing impossible, without a man's consent. In many countries they were not allowed to go into public spaces without a male chaperone. Married women from countries founded on the British colonial system and thus with a legal code based on English law were legally bound to have sex with their husbands upon demand. Marital rape was not a concept, as under law women had given consent to regular intercourse upon marrying. The state and church, placed enormous pressure on young women to retain their virginity. Introduction of the birth control pill, gave many men a sense that as women could not get pregnant, they could not say no to intercourse. Though by the 1960s the pill was widely available, prescription was tightly controlled and in many countries, dissemination of information about birth control was illegal. Even after the pill was legalized, contraception remained banned in numerous countries, like Ireland where condoms were banned and the pill could only be prescribed to control menstrual cycles. The Catholic Church issued the encyclical Humanae vitae in 1968, reiterating the ban on artificial contraception. Abortion often required the consent of a spouse, or approval by a board, like in Canada, wherein the decisions often revolved around whether pregnancy posed a threat to the woman's health or life. In ideology, heterosexual relations are dominated by men, so it creates conflict for women to not maintain consistent birth control use and that it'll be more beneficial for men. As women became more educated and joined the workforce, their home responsibilities remained largely unchanged. Though families increasingly depended on dual incomes, women carried most of the responsibility for domestic work and care of children. There had long been recognized by society in general of the inequalities in civil, socio-economic, and political agency between women and men. However, the women's liberation movement was the first time that the idea of challenging sexism gained wide acceptance. Literature on sex, such as the Kinsey Reports, and the development and distribution of the birth control pill, created a climate wherein women began to question the authority others wielded over their decisions regarding their bodies and their morality. Many of the women who participated in the movement, were aligned with leftist politics and after 1960, with the development of Cold War polarization, took their inspiration from Maoist theory. Slogans such as \\"workers of the world unite\\" turned into \\"women of the world unite\\" and key features like consciousness-raising and egalitarian consensus-based policies \\"were inspired by similar techniques used in China\\". Into this backdrop of world events, Simone de Beauvoir published The Second Sex in 1949, which was translated into English in 1952. In the book, de Beauvoir put forward the idea that equality did not require women be masculine to become empowered. With her famous statement, \\"One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman\\", she laid the groundwork for the concept of gender as a social construct, as opposed to a biological trait. The same year, Margaret Mead published Male and Female, which though it analyzed primitive societies of New Guinea, showed that gendered activities varied between cultures and that biology had no role in defining which tasks were performed by men or women. By 1965, de Beauvoir and Mead's works had been translated into Danish and became widely influential with feminists. Kurahashi Yumiko published her debut Partei in 1960, which critically examined the student movement. The work started a trend in Japan of feminist works which challenged the opportunities available to women and mocked conventional power dynamics in Japanese society. In 1963, Betty Friedan published The Feminine Mystique, voicing the discontent felt by American women.  Aims  As the women's suffrage movement emerged from the abolition movement, the women's liberation movement grew out of the struggle for civil rights. Though challenging patriarchy and the anti-patriarchal message of the women's liberation movement was considered radical, it was not the only, nor the first, radical movement in the early period of second-wave feminism. Rather than simply desiring legal equality, those participating in the movement believed that the moral and social climate which perceived women as second-class citizens needed to change. Though most groups operated independently‚Äîthere were no national umbrella organizations‚Äîthere were unifying philosophies of women participating in the movement. Challenging patriarchy and the hierarchical organization of society which defined women as subordinate in both public and private spheres, liberationists believed that women should be free to define their own individual identity as part of human society. One of the reasons that women who supported the movement chose not to create a single approach to addressing the problem of women being treated as second-class citizens was that they did not want to foster an idea that anyone was an expert or that any one group or idea could address all of the societal problems women faced. They also wanted women, whose voices had been silenced to be able to express their own views on solutions. Rejecting authority and espousing participatory democracy as well as direct action, they promoted a wide agenda including civil rights, eliminating objectification of women, ethnic empowerment, granting women reproductive rights, increasing opportunities for women in the workplace, peace, and redefining familial roles, as well as gay and lesbian liberation. A dilemma faced by movement members was how they could challenge the definition of femininity without compromising the principles of feminism. Women's historical participation in the world was virtually unknown, even to trained historians. Women's roles in historic events were not covered in academic texts and not taught in schools. Even the fact that women had been denied the vote was something few university students were aware of in the era. To understand the wider implications of women's experiences, WLM groups launched women's studies programs introducing feminist history, sociology and psychology to higher education and adult education curricula to counter gender biases in teaching these subjects. Writing women back into history became extremely important in the period with attention to the differences of experiences based on class, ethnic background, race and sexual orientation. The courses became widespread by the end of the decade in Britain, Canada, and the United States, and were also introduced in such places as Italy and Norway. Thousands of adherents joined the movement which began in the United States and spread to Canada and Mexico. In Europe, movements developed in Austria Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Wales. The liberationist movement also was active in Australia, Fiji, Guam, India, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. Key components of the movement were consciousness-raising sessions aimed at politicizing personal issues, small group and limited organizational structure and a focus on changing societal perception rather than reforming legislation. For example, liberationists did not support reforming family codes to allow abortion, instead, they believed that neither medical professionals nor the state should have the power to limit women's complete control of their own bodies. They favored abolishing laws which limited women's rights over their reproduction, believing such control was an individual right, not subject to moralistic majority views. Most liberationists banned the participation of men in their organizations. Though often depicted in media as a sign of \\"man-hating\\", the separation was a focused attempt to eliminate defining women via their relationship to men. Since women's inequality within their employment, family and society were commonly experienced by all women, separation meant unity of purpose to evaluate their second-class status.  Development = North America  The women's liberation movement featured political activities such as a march demanding legal equality for women in the United States (26 August 1970) In Canada and the United States, the movement developed out of the Civil Rights Movement, Anti-War sentiment toward the Vietnam War, the Native Rights Movement and the New Left student movement of the 1960s. Between 1965 and 1966, papers presented at meetings of the Students for a Democratic Society and articles published in journals, such as the Canadian Random began advocating for women to embark on a path of self-discovery free from male scrutiny. In 1967, the first Women's Liberation organizations formed in major cities like Berkeley, Boston, Chicago, New York City and Toronto. Quickly organizations spread across both countries. In Mexico, the first group of liberationists formed in 1970, inspired by the student movement and US women's liberationists. Organizations were loosely organized, without a hierarchical power structure and favored all-women participation to eliminate defining women or their autonomy by their association with men. Groups featured consciousness-raising discussions on a wide variety of issues, the importance of having freedom to make choices, and the importance of changing societal attitudes and perceptions of women's roles. Canadian women's lib groups typically incorporated a class-based component into their theory of oppression which was mostly missing from US liberation theory, which focused almost exclusively on sexism and a belief that women's oppression stemmed from their gender and not as a result of their economic or social class. In Quebec, women's and Quebec's autonomy were entwined issues with women struggling for the right to serve as jurors. Advocating public self-expression by participating in protests and sit-ins, liberationists demonstrated against discriminatory hiring and wage practices in Canada, while in the US liberationists protested the Miss America Beauty Pageant for objectifying women. In both countries women's liberation groups were involved protesting their legislators for abortion rights for women. In Mexico liberationists protested at the Monument to the Mother on Mother's Day to challenge the idea that all women were destined to be mothers. Challenging gender definitions and the sexual relationship to power drew lesbians into the movement in both the United States and Canada. Because liberationists believed that sisterhood was a uniting component to women's oppression, lesbians were not seen as a threat to other women. Another important aspect for North American women was developing spaces for women to meet with other women, offer counseling and referral services, provide access to feminist materials, and establish women's shelters for women who were in abusive relationships. Increasingly mainstream media portrayed liberationists as man-haters or deranged outcasts. To gain legitimacy for the recognition of sexual discrimination, the media discourse on women's issues was increasingly shaped by the liberal feminist's reformist aims. As liberationists were marginalized, they increasingly became involved in single focus issues, such as violence against women. By the mid-1970s, the women's liberation movement had been effective in changing the worldwide perception of women, bringing sexism to light and moving reformists far to the left in their policy aims for women, but in the haste to distance themselves from the more radical elements, liberal feminists attempted to erase their success and rebrand the movement as the Women's Movement.  Asia  By the 1970s, the movement had spread to Asia with women's liberation organizations forming in Japan in 1970. The Yom Kippur War raised awareness of the subordinate status of Israeli women, fostering the growth of the WLM. In India, 1974 was a pivotal year when activists from the Navnirman Movement against corruption and the economic crisis, encouraged women to organize direct actions to challenge traditional leadership. In 1975, liberationist ideas in South Korea were introduced by Yi Hyo-jae a professor at Ewha Woman's University after she had read western texts on the movement which were first translated into Korean in 1973. Similarly, Hsiu-lien Annette Lu, who had completed her graduate courses in the United States, brought liberationist ideas to Taiwan, when she returned and began publishing in the mid-1970s. In Singapore and other Asian countries, conscious effort was made to distinguish their movement from decadent, \\"free sex\\" Western feminist ideals, while simultaneously addressing issues that were experienced worldwide by women. In India, the struggle for women's autonomy was rarely separated from the struggle against the caste system and in Israel, though their movement more closely resembled the WLM in the US and Europe, the oppression of Palestinian women was a focal area. In Japan, the movement focused on freeing women from societal perceptions of limitations because of their sex, rather than on a stand for equality. In South Korea, women workers' concerns merged with liberationist ideas within the broader fight against dictatorship, whereas in Taiwan, theories of respect for women and eliminating double standards were promoted by weaving in Confucianist philosophy.  Europe  In Europe, the women's liberation movement started in the late 1960s and continued through the 1980s. Inspired by events in North America and triggered by the growing presence of women in the labor market, the movement soon gained momentum in Britain and the Scandinavian countries. Though influenced by leftist politics, liberationists in general were resistant to any political order which ignored women entirely or relegated their issues to the sidelines. Women's liberation groups in Europe were distinguished from other feminist activists by their focus on women's rights to control their own bodies and sexuality, as well as their direct actions aimed at provoking the public and making society aware of the issues faced by women. There were robust women's liberation movements in Western European countries, including developments in Greece, Portugal and Spain, which in the period were emerging from dictatorships. Many different types of actions were held throughout Europe. To increase public awareness of the problems of equal pay, liberationists in Denmark staged a bus sit-in, where they demanded lower fares than male passengers to demonstrate their wage gap. Swedish members of Grupp 8 heckled politicians at campaign rallies, demanding to know why women were only allowed part-time jobs and thus were ineligible for pensions. To address the objectification of women, Belgian liberationists protested at beauty pageants, Dolle Minas in the Netherlands and Nyfeministene of Norway invaded male-only bars, Irish Women United demonstrated against male-only bathing at Forty Foot promontory and Portuguese women dressed as a bride, a housewife and a sex symbol, marching in Eduardo VII Park. Reacting on two killings of women in the streets, on the 1st of March 1977 women in West Berlin started demonstrating at night - later to be repeated as Walpurgis Night every year on May Day eve. Women in England, Scotland and Wales took up the idea of Reclaim the Night marches to challenge the notion that women's behavior caused the violence perpetrated against them. Spanish liberationists from the Colectivo Feminista Pelvis (Pelvis Feminist Collective), Grup per l'Alliberament de la Dona (Group for Women's Liberation) and Mujeres Independientes (Independent Women) carried funeral wreaths through the streets of Mallorca calling for an end to sexual abuse and a judicial system which allowed men to use alcohol or passion as mitigating factors for sexual violence. In Iceland, women virtually shut down the country; when spurred by liberationists, 90% of them took Women's Day Off and refused to participate in household duties or work, instead of attending a protest rally. In almost all Western European countries liberationists fought for elimination of barriers to free and unrestricted access to contraception and abortion. In Austria, to advocate for the abolition of section 144 of their criminal code, activists used street theater performance. Prominent French activists declared their criminal actions signing the Manifesto of the 343, admitting to having had abortions, as did German activists who signed the Manifesto of the 374. Irish activists took the train and crossed into Northern Ireland to secure prohibited contraception devices and upon their return flouted authorities bypassing the contraband to the public. In the UK, an uneasy alliance formed between liberationists, the National Abortion Campaign and trade unionists to fight a series of bills designed to restrict abortion rights. In Italy, 50,000 women marched through the streets of Rome demanding their right to control their own bodies, but as was typically the result throughout Europe, compromise reform to existing law was passed by the government, limiting the decision by gestation or requiring preliminary medical authorization. Throughout the period, publishing was crucial for disseminating the theory and ideas of liberation and other feminist schools of thought. Initially many activists relied on translations of material from the US, but increasingly the focus was on producing country-specific editions, or local journals to allow activists to adapt the movement slogan the \\"personal is political\\" to reflect their own experiences. Journals and newspapers founded by liberationists included Belgium's Le Petit livre rouge des femmes (The Little Red Book of Women), France's ' (Waging the Battle), Greece's Gia tin Apeleftherosi ton Gynaikon (For the Liberation of Women), Italy's Sottosopra (Upside Down), the Scottish The Tayside Women's Liberation Newsletter or the British Spare Rib, among many others. In the UK, a news service called the Women's Information and Referral Service (WIRES) distributed news of WLM groups throughout the nation. In West Germany a book distribution run by lesbians snowballed feminist knowledge from 1974 on. Two feminist monthlies - Courage and EMMA - spread the new ideas. The women's camp on Fem√∏ organized by the Red Stocking Movement (Denmark) facilitated international exchange too. 1974 this gathering in the sun gave birth to the first International Tribunal on Crimes against Women held in Bruxelles 1976. Books like Die Klosterschule (The Convent School, 1968) by Barbara Frischmuth, which evaluated patriarchy in the parochial schools of Austria, The Female Eunuch (Paladin, 1970) by Germaine Greer and The Descent of Woman (1972) by Welsh author and feminist Elaine Morgan, brought women into the movement who thought that their lives differed from those of women in large urban settings where the movement originated. Other influential publications included the British edition of Our Bodies, Ourselves (1971) edited by Angela Phillips and Jill Rakusen; Frauenhandbuch Nr. 1: Abtreibung und Verh√ºtungsmittel (Women's Guide # 1: Abortion and Contraceptives, 1971) produced in Germany by Helke Sander and Verena Stefan and Skylla sig sj√§lv (Self-blame, 1976) by Swede Maria-Pia Bo√´thius, which evaluated rape culture applied analysis and solutions to local areas. In some cases, books themselves became the focus of liberationists' protests over censorship, as in the case of the Norwegian demonstration at the publishing house Aschehoug, which was forced to publish a translation of the Swedish text ' (Freedom, Equality and Sisterhood, 1970), or the international outcry which resulted from the ban and arrest of Portuguese authors Maria Teresa Horta, Maria Isabel Barreno and Maria Velho da Costa over their book Novas Cartas Portuguesas (New Portuguese Letters, 1972). As the idea of women's freedom gained mainstream approval, governments and more reformist minded women's groups adopted liberationists' ideas and began incorporating them into compromise solutions. By the early 1980s, most activists in the Women's Liberation Movements in Europe moved on to other single focus causes or transitioned into organizations which were political.  Oceania  Spreading from the United States and Britain, the women's liberation movement reached Oceania in 1969. The first organizations were formed in Sydney in 1969, and by 1970 had reached Adelaide and Melbourne, as well as Wellington and Auckland. The following year, organizations were formed at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji and in Guam. As in the US and other places where the movement flourished, small consciousness-raising groups with a limited organizational structure were the norm and the focus was on changing societal perception rather than legislation. Involved in public protests, liberationists demonstrated at beauty pageants to protest women's objectification, and invaded male-only pubs. In Australia they ran petition drives and protests in favor of legalizing abortion and in Auckland led a funeral procession through Albert Park to demonstrate lack of progress on issues which were of concern to women. Liberationists developed multiple publications such as Broadsheet, Liberaction, MeJane, The Circle and Women's Liberation Newsletter to address issues and concerns;. They founded women's shelters and women's centers for meetings and child care services, which were open to all women, be they socialists, lesbians, indigenous women, students, workers or homemakers. The diversity of adherents fractured the movement by the early 1980s, as groups began focusing on specific interests rather than solely on sexism.  Surveillance  The FBI kept records on numerous participants in the WLM as well as spying on them and infiltrating their organizations. Roberta Sapler, a participant in the movement between 1968 and 1973 in Pittsburgh, wrote an article regarding her attempts to obtain the FBI file kept on her during the period. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police spied upon liberationists in Canada, as did the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation surveil WLM groups and participants in Australia. In Germany, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution () kept tabs on activists participating in women's center activities. Having lived in a communal housing project or been affiliated with youth movements made liberationists targets and their meeting places were searched and materials were confiscated.  Legacy  The women's liberation movement created a global awareness of patriarchy and sexism. By bringing matters that had long been considered private issues into the public view and linking those issues to deepen understanding about how systemic suppression of women's rights in society are interrelated, liberationists made innovative contributions to feminist theory. Desiring to know about women's historic contributions but often being thwarted in their search due to centuries of censoring and blocking of women's intellectual work, liberationists brought the study of power relationships, including those of sex and diversity, into the social sciences. They launched women's studies programs and publishing houses to ensure that a more culturally comprehensive history of the complex nature of society was developed. In an effort to distance themselves from the politics and ideas of women in the liberation movement, as well as the personal politics which emerged, many second-wave feminists distanced themselves from the early movement. Meaghan Morris, an Australian scholar of popular culture stated that later feminists could not associate themselves with the ideas and politics of the period and maintain their respect. And yet, liberationists succeeded in pushing the dominant liberal feminists far to the left of their original aims and forced them to include goals that address sexual discrimination. Jean Curthoys argued that in the rush to distance themselves from liberationists, unconscious amnesia rewrote the history of their movement, and failed to grasp the achievement that, without a religious connotation, the movement created an \\"ethic of the irreducible value of human beings.\\" Phrases that were used in the movement, like \\"consciousness-raising\\" and \\"male chauvinism,\\" became keywords associated with the movement.  Influential publications       *  Criticism  The philosophy practiced by liberationists assumed a global sisterhood of support working to eliminate inequality without acknowledging that women were not united; other factors, such as age, class, ethnicity, and opportunity (or lack thereof) created spheres wherein women's interests diverged, and some women felt underrepresented by the WLM. While many women gained an awareness of how sexism permeated their lives, they did not become radicalized and were uninterested in overthrowing society. They made changes in their lives to address their individual needs and social arrangements, but were unwilling to take action on issues that might threaten their socio- economic status. Liberationist theory also failed to recognize a fundamental difference in fighting oppression. Combating sexism had an internal component, whereby one could change the basic power structures within family units and personal spheres to eliminate the inequality. Class struggle and the fight against racism are solely external challenges, requiring public action to eradicate inequality. There was criticism of the movement not only from factions within the movement itself, but from outsiders, like Hugh Hefner, Playboy founder, who launched a campaign to expose all the \\"highly irrational, emotional, kookie trends\\" of feminism in an effort to tear apart feminist ideas that were \\"unalterably opposed to the romantic boy-girl society\\" promoted by his magazine. \\"Women's libbers\\" were widely characterized as \\"man- haters\\" who viewed men as enemies, advocated for all-women societies, and encouraged women to leave their families behind. Semanticist Nat Kolodney argued that while women were oppressed by social structures and rarely served in tyrannical roles over the male population as a whole, men, in general, were not oppressors of women either. Instead, social constructs and the difficulty of removing systems which had long served their purpose exploited both men and women. Women's liberationists acknowledged that patriarchy affects both men and women, with the former receiving many privileges from it, but focused on the impact of systemic sexism and misogyny on women throughout the world. To many women activists in the American Indian Movement, black Civil Rights Movement, Chicana Movement, as well as Asians and other minorities, the activities of the primarily white, middle-class women in the women's liberation movement were focused specifically on sex-based violence and the social construction of gender as a tool of sex-based oppression. By evaluating all economic, socio-cultural, and political issues through the lens of sexism without pairing it with racism and classism, liberationists often poorly represented women of color in their analyses. While women of color recognized that sexism was an issue, some did not see how it could be separated from the issue of race or class, which compounds to impact their access to education, health care, housing, jobs, legal justice, and the poverty and violence which permeates their lives. For women who did not speak English, or spoke it as a second language, sexism had little to do with the ability to protect herself or utilize existing systems. The focus on personal freedom was another divergence between white women and women of color. Some did not see the intrinsic connection between the liberation of women and the liberation of men that was advocated for by the Women's Liberation Movement and felt that feminists did not care about the inequalities suffered by men; they felt that the liberation of women without the liberation of men from policies that keep men of color from obtaining jobs and limit their civil rights, further preventing them from being able to protect their families, neither improved humanity as a whole nor improved the plight experienced by families. Dorothy Height, president of the National Council of Negro Women, expressed that the best way black women could help themselves was to help their men gain equality. Regarding the \\"sex-positive\\" sect that broke away from the women's liberation movement, extending personal freedom to sexual freedom, the meaning of being free to have relations with whoever one wanted, was lost on black women who had been sexually assaulted and raped with impunity for centuries or Native Women who were routinely sterilized. Their issues were not about limiting their families but having the freedom to form families. It had very little meaning in the traditional Chicana culture wherein women were required to be virgins until marriage and remain na√Øve in her marriage. Though invited to participate within the Women's Liberation Movement, many women of color cautioned against the single focus on sexism, finding it to be an incomplete analysis without the consideration of racism. Likewise, though many lesbians saw commonalities with Women's Liberation through the goals of eponymous liberation from sex-based oppression, which included fighting against homophobia, others believed that the focus was too narrow to confront the issues they faced. Differences in the understanding of gender and how it relates to and informs sex-based oppression and systemic sexism called attention to differences in issues. For example, many liberationists rejected the performance of femininity as positive behavior, which meant that white lesbians who actively chose to perform femininity had to decide between their desire to be feminine-presenting and their rejection of sexual objectification. Jackie Anderson, an activist, and philosopher observed that in the black lesbian community being able to dress up made them feel confident because, during the workweek, black women had to conform to dress codes imposed upon them. This was and continues to be a sentiment held by most women, who tend to believe that the feeling of confidence derived from performing femininity as dictated by the sexist status quo is the same as empowerment.

It bestows credentials upon cardiovascular specialists who meet its qualifications. Education is a core component of the college, which is also active in the formulation of health policy and the support of cardiovascular research. History The American College of Cardiology was chartered and incorporated as a teaching institution in 1949, and established its headquarters, called Heart House, in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1977. In 2006, the college relocated to Washington, D.C.'s West End neighborhood. Past papers for the institution are held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland. Leadership The college is governed by its officers, including the president, president-elect, vice president, secretary, treasurer, chief executive officer and board of trustees. The current ACC Board of Trustees (BOT) consists of 14 College members who took office in March 2019. The president of ACC leads the BOT for a one-year term. Athena Poppas, MD, FACC, is the president for 2020 ‚Äì 2021. Members of the Board of Governors serve as grassroots liaisons between the local chapters and the college's national headquarters. The president serves a one-year term. Members The American College of Cardiology has approximately 54,000 members, including physicians, registered nurses, clinical nurse specialists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, doctors of pharmacology and practice administrators, specializing in cardiovascular care. Becoming a fellow of the American College of Cardiology, associate fellow or affiliate member is based on training, specialty board certification, scientific and professional accomplishments and duration of active participation in a cardiovascular related field. At least 75 percent of professional activities must be devoted to the field of cardiovascular disease. Those achieving highest distinction in the field are awarded the title Master of the American College of Cardiology, which is bestowed upon a maximum of three practicing cardiologists each year. Chapters The college maintains 48 chapters in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Chapters are legally distinct entities from national organization and do not share budgets or staffing. Since 2008, national members have automatically become members of a local chapter. Guidelines As early as the 1980s, the college partnered with the American Heart Association to develop the first clinical practice guidelines for cardiovascular practice. In the 1990s, the college used the guidelines to lay the groundwork for studies documenting discrepancies best and actual cardiovascular practices. The college works with national organizations such as the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to continually develop and update these guidelines. Performance Measures and Data Standards In 2000, the college partnered with the American Heart Association to begin development and publication of national performance measurement standards and data standards for both inpatient and outpatient care based on the guidelines. Measurement sets include: coronary artery disease, hypertension, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cardiac rehabilitation, myocardial infarction, primary prevention and peripheral arterial disease. In addition, the college has submitted its measures to the National Quality Forum, with the majority of its measures receiving endorsement as national standards. The college has also collaborated with specialty societies to undertake the task of developing and publishing clinical data standards. Clinical data standards developed include those for acute coronary syndrome, atrial fibrillation, heart failure and electrophysiology. Appropriate Use Criteria The college has published criteria for single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT MPI), computed tomography of the heart and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, resting transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, and coronary revascularization. Data Registries The college's National Cardiovascular Data Registry is a source for measuring and quantifying outcomes and identifying gaps in the delivery of quality care. Its data are used in select pay-for-reporting and/or performance programs to demonstrate the benefits and challenges of such incentive programs. To date, the college has developed five hospital-based cardiovascular registries. In addition, the PINNACLE Registry is the nation's first and largest practice-based cardiovascular registry. In 2011, the college and The Society of Thoracic Surgeons launched the STS/ACC TVT Registry, which tracks transcatheter valve therapy procedures. National Quality Initiatives Currently several key quality initiatives are underway to help translate science into practice and improve outcomes for cardiovascular patients. These projects include the Door to Balloon Alliance, Hospital to Home and Imaging in FOCUS. Launched in November 2006, the Door to Balloon Alliance is focused on helping hospital not only reduce, but successfully sustain the guideline-recommended time of 90 minutes or less from the time a patient with chest pain arrives at an emergency room until they have a balloon dilatation procedure. The alliance provides hospitals with the evidence-based strategies and resources to focus on process improvement, interdisciplinary cooperation and coordination to substantially impact their door-to-balloon times, and thus, improve patient outcomes. The hospital to Home initiative, led by both the American College of Cardiology and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, is a national quality improvement campaign to reduce cardiovascular-related hospital rehospitalizations and improve the transition from inpatient to outpatient status for individuals hospitalized with cardiovascular disease. Launched in 2009, it seeks to examine and address readmission problems. Imaging in FOCUS is a community designed to guide implementation of appropriate use criteria and ensure patients are receiving the right care at the right time; the initiative has produced innovations such as pocket cards and mobile applications; access to an online community; and access to webinars, educational programs and performance improvement tools. Education and Advocacy The American College of Cardiology Foundation offers a variety of educational programs and products tailored to the needs of clinicians in a variety of specialty areas at all stages of their careers. The college also advocates for health policies that allow cardiovascular professionals to provide quality, appropriate and cost-effective care on such issues as Medicare physician payment, medical imaging, health care reform implementation, medical liability reform and funding for prevention and research. The college is also active on policies that address non-communicable diseases. The college also publishes a peer reviewed scientific journal Journal of the American College of Cardiology with a high Impact factor. The College organizes an annual conference for each year for sharing the latest research in the field of Cardiology. The college cancelled its flagship conference for the first time since inception of the college for the year 2020 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was also initially used in the role of medium tank trainer within armoured cavalry squadrons in the same way as the AVGP Cougar it replaced. In service since 1996, the Coyote is a later generation of the LAV-25 and is of the same family as the Bison APC and the Australian ASLAV, as all are part of the Light Armoured Vehicle family produced by General Dynamics Land Systems - Canada and based on the MOWAG Piranha 8x8. Design= Origins  The Coyote Reconnaissance Vehicle is a non-amphibious armoured reconnaissance vehicle based on the design of the LAV-25 and the MOWAG Piranha II. The Canadian Forces ordered 203 of the vehicles in 1993 to replace the Lynx reconnaissance vehicle, and all were delivered and entered service by 1996. The Coyote originally came in three variants: the \\"Mast\\" variant with a mast-mounted surveillance system, a variant with a remote surveillance suite, and a basic reconnaissance/command post variant.  Armament  The Coyotes mount a 25√ó137mm M242 Bushmaster chain gun and two 7.62√ó51mm NATO C6 general purpose machine guns in an electrically-driven turret. The turret also features a laser-warning receiver, and mounts a total of eight grenade launchers in two clusters capable of firing smoke and fragmentation grenades. One of the machine guns is mounted coaxial to the main gun while the other is pintle-mounted in front of the crew commander's hatch. The main gun is equipped with dual ammunition feeds that allow for separate weapons effects, selectable by the gunner/crew commander; the standard load is a belt of armour-piercing sabot rounds and a belt of HE-T explosive/fragmentation rounds. The main gun and coax machine gun are 2-axis stabilized. The turret is equipped with a laser rangefinder, but no ballistic computer; elevation and lead corrections are applied manually by the gunner using multi-stadia reticules in the day, thermal, and image intensification sights.  Protection  The standard armour of the Coyote protects against small arms fire, anti-personnel mines, and shrapnel, with add-on armour kits able to protect against larger projectiles. The Coyote is equipped with an NBC detector suite consisting of a GID-3 chemical detector and an AN/VDR-2 radiation monitor. Each vehicle is also equipped with an NBC ventilated respirator system.  Sensors  The mast-mounted surveillance variants are equipped with a mast-mounted surveillance system that can be raised to 10 meters above the ground. This system includes the AN/PPS-5C MSTAR Version 3 surface surveillance radar and an electro-optical/infrared surveillance system with a long-range video camera and laser rangefinder. The remote surveillance variant consists of two tripod-mounted systems capable of being deployed up to 200 meters away from the vehicle. The surveillance systems can detect tank- sized targets at up to 12 kilometres away, and large truck-sized targets at up to 24 kilometres. In good conditions the visual surveillance system can detect personnel up to 20 kilometres away.  Mobility  The Coyote is powered by a Detroit Diesel 6V53T engine developing , and can reach speeds of on road. The Coyote has a maximum road range of . Each vehicle is equipped with a tactical navigation system that includes a GPS receiver, a digital compass system, and a backup dead-reckoning system. A 15-tonne capacity hydraulic winch is also fitted to every vehicle to aid in self-recovery. Unlike the LAV-25, the Coyote is equipped with extra fuel tanks in place of amphibious equipment. The Coyote is air-transportable on Hercules C-130 aircraft but only with the turret removed first. Variants 12e R√©giment blind√© du Canada Coyotes come in three variants: Command, Mast, and Remote. The Mast and Remote variants have a sophisticated suite of electronic surveillance equipment including radar, video, and infrared surveillance night vision devices. The mast variant has this equipment mounted on a 10-metre telescoping mast that can be extended to raise the surveillance suite out from behind cover. The remote variant of the Coyote has its surveillance suite mounted on two short tripods, which crew can deploy remotely using a 200-metre spool of cable. When first purchased, the Coyote was designated for service with both the Regular Force and Reserve Force, with the Mast variants earmarked for the Regular units and the Remotes designated for the Reserves. Shortly after taking delivery of the vehicles, but before they were assigned to the Reserve units, all Coyotes were reassigned to the Regular Force. Service history Since the introduction of the Coyote to the Canadian Armed Forces, the vehicle has served national interest domestically and abroad. The Coyote served during the United Nations/ NATO missions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Kosovo, and in Afghanistan. Domestically, it has been deployed during \\"Operation Grizzly\\" to Kananaskis to secure the 28th G8 summit, the 36th G8 summit, and the G-20 Toronto summit,Barr, Colonel David.\\"The Kananaskis G8 Summit: A Case Study in Interagency Cooperation.\\" journal.forces.gc.ca, 14 July 2008.

An Agfacolor slide dating from the early 1940s. While the colors themselves have held up well, damage visible includes dust and Newton's rings.Agfacolor was the name of a series of color film products made by Agfa of Germany. The first Agfacolor, introduced in 1932, was a film-based version of their Agfa- Farbenplatte (Agfa color plate),The glass-based Agfa color plate was announced in 1916, but because of World War I and its aftermath, the product was not properly introduced until the early 1920s. a \\"screen plate\\" product similar to the French Autochrome. In late 1936 Agfa introduced Agfacolor Neu (New Agfacolor), a pioneering color film of the general type still in use today.Based upon the patent no. 253335 of Dr. Rudolf Fischer, 1911, Berlin The new Agfacolor was originally a reversal film used for making \\"slides\\", home movies and short documentaries. By 1939 it had also been adapted into a negative film and a print film for use by the German motion picture industry. After World War II, the Agfacolor brand was applied to several varieties of color negative film for still photography, in which the negatives were used to make color prints on paper. The reversal film was then marketed as Agfachrome. These films use Color Developing Agent 1 in their color developer. Agfacolor Neu, called simply Agfacolor after its predecessor had been retired, was the German response to Technicolor and Kodachrome. Like Kodachrome, introduced by Eastman Kodak in 1935, the new Agfacolor film was an \\"integral tripack\\" with three differently color-sensitized emulsion layers. Unlike Kodachrome, the corresponding color-forming dye couplers were made integral with each layer during manufacture, greatly simplifying the processing of the film: with Kodachrome, the dye couplers had to be introduced one at a time during a very complicated development procedure that required special equipment and could only be done at a Kodak processing plant. History of Agfacolor= Development  Realizing they were at least one year behind their American competitors, German technicians decided to steer away from Kodak‚Äôs approach to capturing color images on film and invested in their own technology. Their work bore fruits in the summer of 1936, when chemical engineers of the Agfa company in Germany tested their new material Agfacolor at the swimming competition of the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Although the German technology promised the use of one and the same material for different purposes, ranging from photographic negative film for prints to photographic slides and motion picture films, it took another three years‚Äîuntil July 1939‚Äîfor any German motion picture film studio to experiment with the film. Early use in German motion picture films The Third Reich's Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels was in a hurry. He admired Hollywood movies and examined them carefully in regular private screenings (sometimes with Adolf Hitler and his staff). Technicolor films such as The Garden of Allah (1936), Gone with the Wind (1939) and Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) made him realize that Hollywood feature films presented a threat to Germany's internal market, and that Hollywood's dominance of color film technology should be matched, at least if Germany was serious about engaging in a cultural war with the US and Britain. =Women Are Better Diplomats= It was not until the beginning of principal photography for Women Are Better Diplomats (German: Frauen sind doch bessere Diplomaten) a 1939 musical starring the popular singer/dancer Marika R√∂kk and actor Willy Fritsch that Agfacolor was used for major motion picture. The use of Agfacolor was reinforced by the top of the Nazi film industry, Reichsminister Joseph Goebbels, and the executives at UFA eventually gave in to his pressure. Agfacolor was then used throughout the entire film shoot of Women Are Better Diplomats. Throughout the shoot, the film yielded mixed results as it was still very sensitive to different color temperatures caused by solar altitude at different times of day. Thus, outdoor shots were difficult to handle: A lawn in front of a castle appeared completely yellow, later brown, then bluish. The technology was not fully developed, and Agfa labs were virtually using the shooting of the film as testing grounds for their new stock, continually changing the formula throughout the shoot based upon unsatisfactory results, so that entire scenes had to be repeated once a new formula was being tested. Meanwhile the production costs had risen from 1.5 to 2.5 million Reichsmarks. More than two years after its start date, Women Are Better Diplomats opened in October 1941. Despite its rather weak color quality, the film proved to be a major hit, earning more than 8 million Reichsmarks by the end of the war. = The Golden City = After the process's growing pains had been overcome throughout the production of Women Are Better Diplomats, the following Agfacolor movies were shot and printed much quicker and with better results. The technology was improved at a rapid pace. Veit Harlan, perhaps the most prominent 'official' film director of the Third Reich, was allowed to shoot his next picture in Agfacolor. Between the summers of 1941 and 1942, Veit Harlan finished Die goldene Stadt (Eng: The Golden City), a dreamy propaganda fairytale starring his wife Kristina S√∂derbaum as a young, innocent country girl who comes to the golden city of Prague and is seduced by an unscrupulous gigolo. The Golden City premi√®red at the Venice Film Festival in September 1942 and was awarded for its outstanding technical quality, and actress Kristina S√∂derbaum won an acting award. Shot by cameraman Werner Krien, who had done black-and-white pictures before, and assisted by special effects specialist Konstantin Irmen-Tschet (once in charge of the SFX camera in Fritz Lang‚Äôs Metropolis), the film displays an impressive symphony of colors. = Later Agfacolor films during the Third Reich = Made for UFA's 25th Anniversary, M√ºnchhausen (1943) was the third German feature film ‚Äì out of over a dozen ‚Äì to be produced using Agfacolor film between 1939 and 1945. Other notable Agfacolor productions include Kolberg (1945), a dramatization of German resistance throughout the Napoleonic Wars and the regime's last major propaganda feature film. A significant number of Agfacolor movies shot between 1939 and 1945 survived the war, but most of them exist only in fragments today.  Legacy of World War II  Towards the end of World War II, large quantities of raw Agfacolor stock were seized by the Soviet Union and served as the basis for the Sovcolor process, which was widely used in the USSR and other Eastern bloc nations. One of the best-known Sovcolor films is War and Peace (1965‚Äì67). After the war, Agfa's former production plant at Wolfen was located in the Soviet occupation zone which was to become East Germany. After the war, the Wolfen plant continued producing Agfacolor films, until in 1964 East Germany lost the licence to the Agfa brand name. From 1964 onwards, the plant was renamed ORWO (short for Original Wolfen), producing color films under the name of ORWOcolor. Agfacolor consumer products were also marketed in North America under the names Ansco Color and Anscochrome (from Agfa's then-US subsidiary, Agfa-Ansco). Prior to World War II, the film had been imported from Germany. After the War began, the American subsidiary was seized by the US Government. At the request of the War Department, Ansco then developed a similar color film, which it produced in its own factory in Binghamton, New York. Anscochrome was widely distributed, but met with limited commercial success in competition with Kodak product.Anscochrome and Ansco color transparencies slides. June 11, 2010.About Ansco. February 07, 2008. Ansco Color was also used in Hollywood films, including some produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Films shot in Ansco Color included The Man on the Eiffel Tower (1949), Bwana Devil (1953), Kiss Me, Kate (1953), Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), Brigadoon (1954), and Lust for Life (1956), the final film shot on this film stock.

She is particularly well known for her books and articles on the wildlife of Central Park and her Wall Street Journal Leisure & Arts column. She appears in Frederic Lilien's documentary film, The Legend of Pale Male (2010). She is also known for writing The Plug-In Drug (1977), which explored the impact of television on young children, and for her involvement in the quiz show scandals of the 1950s. Early life Born in 1936 in Prague, Czechoslovakia, Winn is one of two daughters of a psychiatrist; her sister is the writer Janet Malcolm. Winn is a U.S. citizen who attended the Bronx High School of Science, Radcliffe College and Columbia University. In May 1958, while Winn was a contestant on Dotto, a notebook which belonged to her was found by another contestant, Ed Hilgemeier, who discovered that the notebook included questions and answers to be used during Winn's appearances. Jack Narz, the host of Dotto at the time, recalled, when interviewed for a PBS documentary, that he believed Winn to be \\"a little too pat\\" when giving her answers.American Experience: The Quiz Show Scandals A CBS executive vice president, Thomas Fisher, tested kinescopes of the show against Winn's notebook and concluded that the show appeared to have been fixed. The executives also learned the show's producers had paid Winn, Hilgemeier, and Winn's opponent Yaffe Kimball-Slatin to keep quiet about the notebook. They also learned that Hilgemeier might have demanded more money to keep quiet and filed a deceptive practices complaint with the Federal Communications Commission. Writing career=The Plug-In Drug Winn is the author of The Plug-In Drug (1977), an often scathing critique of television's addictive influence on the young, Winn wrote, \\"The television experience allows the participant to blot out the real world and enter into a pleasurable and passive mental state.\\" In 2002, she added new material to update the study as The Plug-In Drug: Television, Computers, and Family Life, published on the 25th anniversary of the original book. Pale Male An advocate for protecting wildlife, Winn gave the name Pale Male to the Red-tailed Hawk that nested on a Fifth Avenue building, receiving much press coverage.Lueck, Thomas J. \\"Co-op to Help Hawks Rebuild, but the Street Is Still Restless,\\" The New York Times, December 15, 2004. She was also prominent in preserving Pale Male's nest when it was threatened with removal. She wrote about these events in her book, Red-Tails in Love: Pale Male's Story - A True Wildlife Drama in Central Park (1998). The book is an expansion of her Smithsonian magazine articles and her column in The Wall Street Journal. Frederic Lilien's documentary film, Pale Male (2002), is an adaptation of Winn's book and includes interview scenes with Winn.

Botia morleti, Botia horae) is a species of botiid loach found in the Mekong River basin in Indochina, as well as the Chao Phraya and Mae Klong basins in Thailand. The maximum size is 10 cm (4 in) and it occurs in water with parameters 26 - 30 ¬∞C (79 to 86 ¬∞F) temperature, pH 6.0 to 8.0, hardness 5.0 to 12.0. It feeds on live crustaceans, insects, snails and other invertebrates. Despite being seen frequently in the aquarium trade, skunk loach may be an aggressive fish and may not suitable for community aquarium tanks unless kept with several of its own. Smaller fish and bottom feeders in the tank can be attacked or killed. Caution and observation as well as having 3 or more may prevent this. A two-year observation within an aquarium tank has revealed some misunderstandings about this fish. The observed tank has had 10-15 (currently 15) of the skunk botia or skunk loach. The fish has not shown any aggression towards other fish in the tank. Other fish in the tank include several different Tetra species, including, at one time or another, Bleeding Heart Tetras, Long Fin Serpae Tetra, Black Phantom Tetra, and Black Neon Tetras. There are also Swordtails, Green Corydora Catfish, male and female Betta, and Plecostomus. At no time has the Skunk Loach shown any aggression towards any of the other community fish. Observation has also shown that they tend to stay to their own species and have established a community at peace with each other. In the observation tank small caves were created and they eventually started sharing these caves with others of their kind. The Skunk Botia has yet to be bred in captivity. Skunk Botia require a high protein diet. Live foods are the best. Frozen foods such as Blood Worms, Brine Shrimp, Daphnia are well liked. They do like an occasional flake food. * List of freshwater aquarium fish species  References  Riehl R, Baensch HA (1996) Aquarium Atlas. Vol 1. pg: 368.

He also held a research position at the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy, and was elected corresponding Member of the Romanian Academy in 1997. He is best known for his contributions to algebra and the theory of abelian categories. From 1964 to 2007 he collaborated with Pierre Gabriel on the characterization of abelian categories; their best-known result is the Gabriel‚ÄìPopescu theorem, published in 1964. His areas of expertise were category theory, abelian categories with applications to rings and modules, adjoint functors, limits and colimits, the theory of sheaves, the theory of rings, fields and polynomials, and valuation theory. He also had interests and published in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, K-theory, class field theory, and algebraic function theory. Biography Popescu was born on September 22, 1937 in Strehaia-Comanda, Mehedin»õi County, Romania. In 1954 he graduated from the Carol I High School in Craiova and went on to study mathematics at the University of Ia»ôi. In his third year of studies he was expelled from the university, having been deemed \\"hostile to the regime\\" for remarking that \\"the achievements of American scientists are also worth of consideration.\\" He then went back home to Strehaia, where he worked for a year in a collective farm, after which he was admitted in 1959 at the University of Bucharest, only to start anew as a freshman. Popescu earned his M.S. degree in mathematics in 1964, and his Ph.D. degree in mathematics in 1967, with thesis Krull‚ÄìRemak‚ÄìSchmidt Theorem and Theory of Decomposition written under the direction of . He was awarded a D. Phil. degree (Doctor Docent) in 1972, also by the University of Bucharest. While still a student, Popescu focused on category theory. He first approached the general theory, with its connections to homological algebra and algebraic topology, then shifted his focus on theory of Abelian categories, being one of the main promoters of this theory in Romania. He carried out mathematics studies at the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy in the Algebra research group, and also had international collaborations on three continents. He shared many moral, ethical, and religious values with Alexander Grothendieck, who visited the Faculty of Mathematics in Bucharest in 1968. Like Grothendieck, he had a long- standing interest in category theory and number theory, and supported promising young mathematicians in his fields of interest. He also promoted the early developments of category theory applications in relational biology and mathematical biophysics/mathematical biology. Academic positions Popescu was appointed as a Lecturer at the University of Bucharest in 1968 where he taught graduate students until 1972. Starting in 1964 he also held a research appointment at the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy. The institute was closed in 1976 by order of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu (for reasons related to his daughter Zoia Ceau»ôescu, who had been hired at the institute two years before), but was reopened in 1990, after the Romanian Revolution. Publications Between 1962 and 2008 Popescu published more than 102 papers in peer-reviewed mathematics journals, several monographs on the theory of sheaves, and several books on abelian category theory and abstract algebra, including  * In a Grothendieck-like, energetic style, he initiated and provided scientific leadership to several seminars on category theory, sheaves and abstract algebra which resulted in a continuous stream of high-quality mathematical publications in international, peer-reviewed mathematics journals by several members participating in his Seminar series. Personal life Popescu died in Bucharest on July 29, 2010. He is survived by his wife, Professor Dr. Elena Liliana Popescu, and their three children, one of whom, , is a politician. Recognition In 1971 Popescu received the Simion Stoilow Prize in Mathematics of the Romanian Academy. He was elected President of the Romanian Mathematical Society in 1990 and corresponding Member of the Romanian Academy in 1997. On the 80th anniversary of his birthday, the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics at the University of Bucharest and the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy organized a conference in his memory.

Neonatal milk secretion is considered a normal physiological occurrence and no treatment or testing is necessary. It is thought to be caused by a combination of the effects of maternal hormones before birth, prolactin, and growth hormone passed through breastfeeding and the postnatal pituitary and thyroid hormone surge in the infant. Breast milk production occurs in about 5% of newborns and can persist for two months though breast buds can persist into childhood. Witch's milk is more likely to be secreted by infants born at full term, and not by prematurely born infants. The consistency of neonatal milk is estimated to be quite similar to maternal milk. Its production also may be caused by certain medications. In extremely rare cases neonatal mastitis may develop but it is unclear if it is related to neonatal milk secretion. In some cultures, the tradition of removing the milk (\\"milking\\") has been reported. This practice can prolong milk production and other problems can not be excluded. While breastfeeding may also contribute to prolonged milk production and breast enlargement, temporary, or permanent weaning is not recommended. In folklore, witch's milk was believed to be a source of nourishment for witches' familiar spirits. It was thought to be stolen from unwatched, sleeping infants. In other cultures expressing milk from the infant's breasts is supposed to contribute to a good breast shape in adulthood.

She has written almost forty books, with many of her characters presented in short series of three or four books (e.g. Hugo and Josephine books, the Shadow series, and the titles about Lotten). For her lasting contribution to children's literature, she received the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for Writing in 1974. Biography Maja Stina Walter was born in Vaxholm, Uppland, Sweden. When Maria was six, her family moved from Vaxholm to √ñrebro. They moved again to Stockholm for her secondary schooling and studies at Stockholm University. In 1946 she married the artist Harald Gripe, who created cover illustrations for most of her books. His illustration career, in fact, began in connection with his wife's debut as the author of I v√•r lilla stad (\\"In our little town\\"). Maria Gripe's first major success was Josephine (1961), the first of a series of novels that later included Hugo and Josephine and Hugo. During most of her adult life, Maria Gripe lived in Nyk√∂ping, where an adaptation of her book Agnes Cecilia was filmed. After a long period of dementia, Maria Gripe died at 83 in a nursing home in R√∂nninge outside Stockholm; her husband Harald had predeceased her by 15 years. Their daughter Camilla Gripe is also a children's author. Writing style Much of her writing, particularly the later work, is suffused with a supernatural or mystical element. Fairy-tales were recurring motifs and these were often intertwined with psychological realism presented in a poetic style. The change in her writing style from her less mature work was partly a result of the influence of Edgar Allan Poe, Charlotte and Emily Bront√´, and Carl Jonas Love Almquist, and partly a reaction to violence in entertainment that had begun to gain ground in cultural expression; Gripe sought to manufacture plot tension in less overt ways. A prominent feature of Maria Gripe's writing is a respect for individuals and their unique characteristics, a trait which is especially perceptible in the social realism of the Elvis series, which she co-wrote with her husband Harald in the 1970s.\\"Maria Gripe har avlidit\\" (\\"Maria Gripe has died\\"), a April 2007, Svenska Dagbladet.

Her last published book is Annas blomma (\\"Anna's Flower\\", 1997). Several of Gripe's books have been filmed, such as Glasbl√•sarns barn (\\"The Glassblower's Children\\") and Agnes Cecilia - en s√§llsam historia (\\"Agnes Cecilia: a singular history\\"), directed by Anders Gr√∂nros in the 1990s. Kjell Grede directed Hugo and Josephine in 1967 was critically acclaimed and is considered the first Swedish children's film, which was valued artistically as well as storywise. In 1976, Kay Pollak also filmed Elvis! Elvis! (Elvis and his friends), which Gripe co-wrote with him after his serial The Secret Reality made a profound impression on the author. There is also Marianne Ahrne who directed the 1989 television series Flickan vid stenb√§nken (\\"The girl by the stone bench\\", based on the \\"Shadow\\" series). Dramatized versions of Tordyveln flyger i skymningen (\\"The scarab flies at dusk\\"), Agnes Cecilia and Tanten (\\"The Aunt\\") have been produced as radio serials. She also wrote the original Swedish television script for Trolltider (\\"Magic Time\\", 1979). Recognition for Gripe's work The biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children's books. Gripe received the writing award in 1974. Stockholm University Literature professor Boel Westin praised Maria Gripe to a writer for Svenska Dagbladet, declaring that her Shadow books presented an exciting narrative that enabled readers to feel as if they were participants: \\"She has meant a lot. She renewed children's prose.\\" Literary researcher Ying Toijer-Nilsson, who wrote a biography Skuggornas f√∂rtrogna (\\"Confidant to shadows\\") of the author, echoed the remarks, saying that she would miss \\"the warm and humorous human being who was Maria Gripe.\\" The biographer continued: \\"She has done a lot for the children's book world, and she got her readers to think about philosophy, about the world and about death.\\" Toijer-Nilsson pointed out that Gripe's books also have \\"a significant tendency to support the social advancement of women.\\" Her books have won many awards, and she was the 1979 Swedish winner of the Dobloug Prize for Swedish and Norwegian fiction. In 1985 she was awarded the Nordic Children's Book Prize. Gripe's publisher Bonnier Carlsen established the Maria Gripe Prize in 2005, which is a literary prize awarded annually.

It is located in the Discovery District of Downtown Toronto along a portion of University Avenue known as \\"Hospital Row\\"; it is directly north of The Hospital for Sick Children, across Gerrard Street West, and east of Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and Mount Sinai Hospital. The hospital serves as a teaching hospital for the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine. In 2019, Newsweek ranked TGH as seventh among the top-ten best hospitals in the world. In 2019, the hospital was ranked 1st for research in Canada by Research Infosource for the 9th year in a row. The emergency department now treats 28,065 persons each year, while the hospital also houses the major transplantation service for Ontario, performing heart, lung, kidney, liver, pancreas, and small intestine, amongst others, for patients referred from all over Canada. The hospital is the largest organ transplant center in North America, performing 639 transplants in 2017. The hospital is also renowned for cardiac and thoracic surgery. The world's first single and double lung transplants were performed at TGH in 1983 and 1986 and the world's first valve-sparing aortic root replacement was done by Tirone David at Toronto General Hospital in 1992. The Lung Transplant program is currently the largest in the world, performing 167 lung transplants in 2017. In 2015, surgeons performed the world's first triple organ transplant (lung, liver and pancreas) in 19 year old Reid Wylie at Toronto General Hospital. TGH teaches resident physicians, nurses, and technicians; it also conducts research through the Toronto General Research Institute. Currently, Sophie, Countess of Wessex, as a member of the Canadian Royal Family, is patron of the hospital. History The Toronto General Hospital as it appeared in 1895 Toronto General Hospital main entrance The hospital started as a small shed in the old town and was used as a British Army military hospital during the War of 1812, after which it was founded as a permanent institutionYork General Hospitalin 1829, at John and King Streets (now home to Bell Lightbox). In 1855 a new home for the hospital was built on the north side of Gerrard Street, east of Parliament, using a design by architect William Hay. In 1913, the hospital moved to College Street, near its current location, expanding and upgrading over the ensuing years. The 1913 structure, previously called the College Wing, was eventually sold by the hospital, to become the home of the MaRS Discovery District after a new wing for the TGH was completed and opened in 2002.

Often it is associated with pleasure. In palaces and traditional mansions of Asia, there may be pavilions that are either freestanding or connected by covered walkways, as in the Forbidden City (Chinese pavilions), Topkapi Palace in Istanbul, and in Mughal buildings like the Red Fort. * As part of a large palace, pavilions may be symmetrically placed building blocks that flank (appear to join) a main building block or the outer ends of wings extending from both sides of a central building block, the corps de logis. Such configurations provide an emphatic visual termination to the composition of a large building, akin to bookends. The word is from French (Old French ), from Latin (accusative of ). In Late Latin and Old French, it meant both ‚Äòbutterfly‚Äô and ‚Äòtent‚Äô, because the canvas of a tent resembled a butterfly's spread wings. Free-standing structures Pavilions may be small garden outbuildings, similar to a summer house or a kiosk; small rooms on the roof of a large house, reached only via the roof (rather than by internal stairs) may also be called pavilions. These were particularly popular up to the 18th century and can be equated to the Italian , formerly rendered in English \\"casino\\". These often resembled small classical temples and follies. Especially if there is some space for food preparation, they may be called a banqueting house. A pavilion built to take advantage of a view may be referred to as a gazebo. Bandstands in a park are a class of pavilion. A by a swimming pool may have sufficient character and charm to be called a pavilion. By contrast, a free-standing pavilion can also be a far larger building such as the Royal Pavilion at Brighton, which is in fact a large Indian-style palace; however, like its smaller namesakes, the common factor is that it was built for pleasure and relaxation. A sports pavilion is usually a building adjacent to a sports ground used for changing clothes and often partaking of refreshments. Often it has a verandah to provide protection from the sun for spectators. In cricket grounds, as at Lords, a cricket pavilion tends to be used for the building the players emerge from and return to, even when this is actually a large building including a grandstand. A pavilion in stadia, especially baseball parks, is a typically single-decked covered seating area (as opposed to the more expensive seating area of the main grandstand and the less expensive seating area of the uncovered bleachers). Classical architecture Externally, pavilions may be emphasised by any combination of a change in height, profile (a flat facade may end in round pavilions, or flat ones that project out), colour, material, and ornament. Internally they may be part of a rectangular block, or only connected to the main block by a thin section of building. The two 18th-century English country houses of Houghton Hall and Holkham Hall illustrate these different approaches in turn. In the Place des Vosges (1605‚Äì12), Paris, twin pavilions mark the centers of the north and south sides of the square. They are named the (‚Äúking‚Äôs pavilion‚Äù) and the (‚Äúqueen‚Äôs pavilion‚Äù), though no royal personage ever lived in the square. With their triple archways, they function like gatehouses that give access to the privileged space of the square. French gatehouses had been built in the form of such pavilions in the preceding century. Other uses In some areas, a pavilion is a term for a hunting lodge. The in Luberon, France is a typical 18th-century aristocratic hunting pavilion. The pavilion, located on the site of an old Roman villa, includes a garden , which was used by the guests for receptions.

The Institute was founded in 1950 by the Biological Council: the then umbrella body for Britain's many learned biological societies. Its individual membership (as opposed to the individual membership of its affiliates) quickly grew; in the late 1990s it was as high as 16,000 but declined in the early 21st century to 11,000. It received a Royal Charter in 1979 and it held charitable status. The IoB was not a trade union, nor did it have the regulatory power over its membership (like the General Medical Council) although it did have the right to remove a member's Chartered status and was empowered by its Royal Charter to represent Britain's profession of biology. In October 2009, the IoB was merged with the Biosciences Federation (BSF) to form the Society of Biology, which has around 14,000 individual members and over 90 member organisations. In May 2015, the Society was granted permission to become the Royal Society of Biology. Role of the Institute As the professional body representing biologists, the IoB was frequently consulted on biological issues by Government, Parliament, industry and other organisations. Due to its widespread members and affiliated societies, it prided itself on producing a balanced response that reflected the views of the biological profession as a whole. At its peak of policy activity in the late 1990s the Institute was each year responding to over 40 consultations and organising half a dozen policy events and workshops in addition to its usual committee meetings. Topics addressed were wide and varied, for example including relating to: agricultural research, AIDS, antibiotic resistance, alternative medicine regulation, bioethics, biodiversity, biotechnology, careers in biology (both for school leavers and at the research level), climate change, GMOs, public understanding of science, national park formation, renewable energy impact, research assessment, safety in biological fieldwork, safety in laboratories, xenotransplantation... among many others. The Institute's house journal was Biologist, featuring news and book reviews, but mainly overview articles of biological topics. It also produced a specialist journal for biology teachers and university lecturers called the Journal of Biological Education. (The latter journal continues today with the Society of Biology but the former became a magazine‚Äîwith a changed subtitle The Biologist‚Äîin 2011.) In addition to journals it produced symposium proceedings and a range of in-house publications. In the Institute's 50-year history its most popular in-house publication was \\"Careers with Biology\\" that ran to several editions and tens of thousands of copies. Other highly successful titles have included \\"Safety in Biological Fieldwork\\" (three editions) and \\"Biological Nomenclature\\" (four editions). From its second decade through to the end its fourth, the Institute was noted for its co- publishing ventures with commercial academic publishers. In particular its short book series 'Studies in Biology' with Edward Arnold beginning in 1960 ended up at the height of its popularity with 149 titles. This series was then with Cambridge University Press up to 2007. Over the years literally hundreds of thousands of copies from this series have been sold. Other successful publishing ventures in the 1980s and 1990s included those with Unwin Hyman, Chapman & Hall, and Westlake Publishing. In the late 1990s through to 2003 its joint publishing ventures with Hobsons saw bioscience university course guides go each year to every secondary school in the UK. The Institute regularly organised scientific symposia. These were organised by either its regional branches or by its scientific committees ('divisions') that related to biomedicine, education, agriculture and environment (these last two were merged in 2007). Prior to 2000, these provided the raw material for the aforementioned 'proceedings'. The regional branches also regularly organised other scientific as well as social events and included topics of fundamental research as well as socio-political interest. One example of a then controversial topic was the proceedings arising out of the 1989 symposia 'AIDS: A Challenge in Education' the proceedings of which were jointly published by the Institute with the Royal Society of Medicine so reaching both clinicians, the biological community as well as school teachers.Morgan, D., (ed.) (1990) AIDS: A Challenge in Education, IoB & RSM: London. . From 1995 to 2003 the Institute increasingly became the 'Voice of British Biology' (its then strategic goal) following the creation of the Affiliated Societies out of the former Biological Council. Between 1995 and 2003 it responded to over 120 science policy consultations invariably with some informal input from Affiliated Societies and occasionally formally jointly with some of these Affiliated Societies on a wide range of topics.Institute of Biology Science Policy Responses 1995 - 2003 The Institute's Education Department also produced a similar number of responses, again some with Affiliated Societies. During 2003, the IoB merged with the Biosciences Federation (BSF) re-inventing \\"a single authority within the life sciences that decision-makers are able to consult for opinion and information to assist the formulation of public policy\\". The IoB participated in the formation of policy responses and statements with the BSF. For example, the IoB \\"contributed specific (or specialist) advice\\" in the formation of the policy statement Climate Change: Looking forward, stating \\"that climate change is 'the world's greatest environmental challenge'.\\" Additionally, the IoB also communicated policy advice independently of the BSF. For example, in regards to ecosystem services, they promoted, \\"putting an explicit value on the services that ecosystems contribute to human welfare, including such diverse items as flood protection, pollination, soil formation and aesthetic enjoyment.\\"IoB Ecosystem Services Membership of the Institute Members agreed to uphold standards of professional behaviour contained in the Royal Charter: :\\"Every member of the Institute shall at all times so order their conduct as to uphold the dignity and reputation of biology and to safeguard the public interest in matters of safety and health and otherwise. They shall exercise professional skill and judgement to the best of their ability and discharge professional responsibilities with integrity.\\" The IoB offered members a number of benefits, including subscriptions to in-house journals, Journal of Biological Education and The Biologist, its publications, discounts on third party products and services and also discounted use of the meeting facilities at the IoB headquarters in London. There were several grades of membership, depending upon biological qualifications and experience. Members and Fellows were awarded Chartered Biologist (CBiol) status, the professional qualification for bioscientists. It demonstrated a high level of attainment in biological experience, personal integrity, professional attributes and academic qualifications. In addition to the grades listed below, there were also student, graduate (with the designation GBiol, for degree graduates who did not qualify for CBiol) and associate (for non-academic biologists or academics outside of biology) membership grades. The IoB awarded qualifications equivalent to honours degrees (Graduateship of the Institute of Biology). The syllabus was taught at technical colleges in the United Kingdom. This offered a route to honours degree level qualifications in biology for students unable to commit to full time higher education. Graduates of the IoB could apply for election to full membership after demonstrating the required level of experience and responsibility in the field of the biological sciences. Membership The Member grade was the main professional grade. Members were professional bioscientists with a standard of academic attainment equivalent to first or second class honours degree level in biological science and with post-graduate responsible experience in biological research or in the teaching or application of biological science. Members were entitled to use the letters C.Biol M.I.Biol Fellowship Fellowship of the Institute of Biologists was the senior professional grade. Bioscientists who had achieved distinction in biological research or the teaching or application of biological science were eligible. Fellows used the designation C.Biol F.I.Biol Affiliated societies The Institute was born out of the Biological Council. The Biological Council dissolved in the early 1990s and became the Affiliated Societies: this affiliation enabled the Institute to facilitate what its then President called \\"the voice of British biology\\". At their most there were 70 societies in 2002. This biological affiliation enabled issues of common concern (such as research assessment, science funding, career structure, bioethics) to be addressed as well as more specialist issues that affected only a subset of the affiliation. Location The headquarters of the Institute was originally located in Tavistock Square in BMA House before moving to larger rented accommodation in Queensgate in Kensington, London, near to the Natural History Museum and Imperial College London. It then bought its own property nearby in 20 Queensberry Place. During the early 1990s it bought the building next door (number 22), merging the two. In 2006, it moved to smaller accommodation in Red Lion Court (near the Royal Courts of Justice).

Born to a noble British family, he served in the Royal Navy, seeing action at the Battle of Trafalgar and the Battle of New Orleans. In 1819 he was discharged from the Royal Navy, and a few years later would travel to Greece to aid the Greeks in their struggle for independence, where he would take part in multiple battles, most notably the Battle of Itea, during which his ship the Karteria, would become the first steam-powered warship to see combat.  Early life and career  He was the son of Sir Charles Hastings of Willesley Hall, a natural son of Francis Hastings, 10th Earl of Huntingdon. He entered the British Navy in 1805, and was in the Neptune (100) at the Battle of Trafalgar. He also took part in the Battle of New Orleans; but in 1819 a quarrel with his flag captain led to his leaving the service. The revolutionary troubles of the time offered chances of foreign employment. Hastings spent a year on the continent to learn French, and sailed for Greece on 12 March 1822 from Marseilles. On 3 April he reached Hydra. For two years he took part in the naval operations of the Greeks in the Gulf of Smyrna and elsewhere. Writings He saw that the light squadrons of the Greeks must in the end be overpowered by the heavier Turkish navy, clumsy as it was; and in 1823 he drew up and presented to Lord Byron a very able memorandum which he laid before the Greek government in 1824. This paper is of particular interest apart from its importance in the Greek insurrection, for it contains the germs of the great revolution which has since been effected in naval gunnery and tactics. In substance the memorandum advocated the use of steamers in preference to sailing ships, and of direct fire with shells and hot shot, as a more trustworthy means of destroying the Turkish fleet than fire-ships. It will be found in George Finlay's History of the Greek Revolution, vol. ii. appendix i. Lack of resources prevented the full application of Hastings's plans; but by the use of his own money, of which he is said to have spent ¬£7,000, he was able to some extent to carry them out.  Later adventures  Watercolor of the flagship Karteria In 1824, he came to England to obtain a steamer, and in 1825 he had fitted out a small steamer named the Karteria (\\"Perseverance\\"), manned by Englishmen, Swedes and Greeks, and provided with apparatus for the discharge of shell and hot shot. He did enough to show that if his advice had been vigorously followed the Turks would have been driven off the sea long before the date of the battle of Navarino. The great effect produced by his shells in an attack on the sea-line of communication of the Turkish army, then besieging Athens at Oropos and Volos in March and April 1827, was a clear proof that much more could have been done. Military mismanagement caused the defeat of the Greeks round Athens. But Hastings, in co-operation with General Richard Church, shifted the scene of the attack to western Greece. Here his destruction of a small Turkish squadron at Salona Bay in the Gulf of Corinth (29 September 1827) provoked Ibrahim Pasha into the aggressive movements which led to the destruction of his fleet by the allies at Navarino on 20 October 1827.  Death  The old arsenal, now a Naval Academy where Hastings is buried On 25 May 1828 he was wounded in an attempt to reclaim Missolonghi, and he died a few days later from his injuries in Zakynthos on 1 June. Greece held a national funeral in honor of him. He was laid to rest beneath the arsenal of Poros, today a Hellenic Naval Academy, and his heart is preserved in the Anglican Church in Athens. Multiple monuments in Greece were built in his honor, and several streets were named after him. General Gordon, who served in the war and wrote its history, says of him: \\"If ever there was a disinterested and really useful Philhellene it was Hastings. He received no pay, and had expended most of his slender fortune in keeping the Karteria afloat for the last six months. His ship, too, was the only one in the Greek navy where regular discipline was maintained. External links * http://www.captainfrank.co.uk/ ‚Äì website by Maurice Abney-Hastings.

Bank of America Tower (Left). A view of Harcourt Road in 2006, with the still-undeveloped Tamar site. Harcourt Road () is a major highway in Admiralty, Hong Kong, connecting Central and Wan Chai. It starts at Murray Road and ends at Arsenal Street. The road is 780 metres in length and has four lanes of traffic on either side. The section of Harcourt Road westbound between Rodney Street and Cotton Tree Drive features a frontage road. History In the early 1840s when Hong Kong was colonized, the present-day Admiralty was planned to be of military use, the navy situated at the seafront and the army back on the hillside. That leaves in-between a rather large, elongated piece of land. In the 1870s the Admiralty Dock was built on that stretch of land. Prior to its construction, the then governor, Sir Arthur Kennedy discussed the possibility of running a narrow public road through this land with the military officials but was rejected to protect military secrecy. Kennedy Road in the Mid-Levels was built as a replacement. Then for decades numerous attempts by different governors negotiating on this matter failed. After World War II, the navy strength of the British Empire in the far east diminished, hence this piece of land containing the Admiralty Dock amongst others was returned to the government. The Admiralty dock finally ceased operating in November 1959 and was demolished soon after. Due to the rapid development of Central and Wan Chai, traffic congestions occurs frequently in the area and a driving uphill to Kennedy Road is quite a detour. So after the reclamation of parts of the dock, Harcourt Road was built and opened to public in 1961 to ease these problems. It was named after Cecil Harcourt of the Royal Navy who received Hong Kong from Japan after World War II, on April 7 the same year. Harcourt Road was once a waterfront promenade. The road has serious safety problems; 13 car accidents happened at the same curve of the road within six months. Hence on August 13, 1962 a speed limit was placed that traffic cannot exceed 35 km/h when passing that curve; this happened to be the first speed limit all over Hong Kong. In January 2019, the Central‚ÄìWan Chai Bypass opened, providing a parallel expressway route to Harcourt Road, Gloucester Road, Victoria Park Road and Connaught Road Central. Harcourt Road Flyover The Harcourt Road Flyover at the western part of the road opened on 19 April 1966. To link Harcourt Road with Queen's Road East and Garden Road, the Albany Nullah was decked over and a new road built called Kapok Drive (now Cotton Tree Drive). These flyovers and slip roads opened in the late 1960s. Events Protesters occupying Harcourt Road in October 2014. From 28 September 2014 to 11 December 2014, the Umbrella Revolution took place. Harcourt Road, near to the Admiralty Station, Government and Legislative Council Complex, transformed into Umbrella Square, was occupied for 79 days by pro-democracy protesters. Central Government Complex On 12 June 2019, protesters took place on Harcourt Road to oppose the extradition bill to China.

Sarafian, starring Barry Newman, Cleavon Little, and Dean Jagger. Essentially the story of a disaffected ex-cop and race driver who is delivering a souped- up car cross country to California while high on speed ('uppers'), being chased by police and meeting various characters along the way. The film has become a cult movie. Its rock score includes performances by Delaney and Bonnie and others. Plot Car delivery driver Kowalski (Barry Newman) arrives in Denver, Colorado, on a late Friday night with a black Imperial. The delivery service clerk Sandy (Karl Swenson) urges him to get some rest, but Kowalski insists on getting started with his next assignment to deliver a white 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T 440 Magnum (supposedly supercharged) to San Francisco by Monday. Before leaving Denver, Kowalski pulls into a biker bar parking lot around midnight to buy Benzedrine pills to stay awake for the long drive ahead. He bets his dealer Jake (Lee Weaver) that he will get to San Francisco by 3:00 pm Sunday, even though the delivery is not due until Monday. Through flashbacks and the police reading of his record, we learn that Kowalski is a Medal of Honor Vietnam War veteran, former racecar driver, and motorcycle racer. He is also a former police officer. Driving west across Colorado, Kowalski is pursued by two motorcycle police officers who try to stop him for speeding. He forces one officer off the road and eludes the other officer by jumping across a dry creek bed. Later, the driver of a Jaguar E-Type roadster pulls up alongside Kowalski and challenges him to a race. After the Jaguar driver nearly runs him off the road, Kowalski overtakes him and beats the Jaguar to a one-lane bridge, causing the Jaguar to crash into the river. Kowalski checks to see if the driver is okay, then takes off, with police cars in pursuit. Kowalski drives across Utah and into Nevada, with the police unable to catch him. During the pursuit, Kowalski listens to radio station KOW, (as 2011 is KGFN 89.1) which is broadcasting from Goldfield, Nevada. A blind black disc jockey at KOW, who goes by the name of Super Soul (Cleavon Little), listens to the police radio frequency and encourages Kowalski to evade the police. Super Soul seems to understand Kowalski and seems to see and hear Kowalski's reactions. With the help of Super Soul, who calls Kowalski \\"the last American hero\\", Kowalski gains the interest of the news media, and people begin to gather at the KOW radio station to offer their support. During the police chase across Nevada, Kowalski finds himself surrounded and heads into the desert. After he blows a left front tire and becomes lost, Kowalski is helped by an old prospector (Dean Jagger) who catches rattlesnakes for a Pentecostal Christian commune. After Kowalski is given fuel, the old man directs him back to the highway. There, he picks up two homosexual hitchhikers stranded en route to San Francisco with a \\"Just Married\\" sign in their rear window. When they attempt to hold him up at gunpoint, Kowalski throws them out of the car and continues on his journey. Saturday afternoon, a vengeful off-duty highway patrolman and a group of thugs break into the KOW studio and assault Super Soul and his engineer. Near the California state line, Kowalski is helped by hippie biker Angel (Timothy Scott), who gives him pills to help him stay awake. Angel's girlfriend (Gilda Texter), who rides a motorcycle nude, recognizes Kowalski and shows him a collage she made of newspaper articles about his police career. Kowalski suspects that Super Soul's broadcast is now being directed by the police to entrap him. Confirming that the police are indeed waiting at the border, Angel helps Kowalski get through the roadblock with the help of an old air raid siren and a small motorbike with a red headlight strapped to the top of the Challenger, simulating a police car. Kowalski finally reaches California by Saturday at 7:12 pm. He calls Jake from a payphone to reassure him that he still intends to deliver the car on Monday, while acknowledging he won't win their bet, and offering to double it for the next time. On Sunday morning, California police, who have been tracking Kowalski's movements on an electronic wall-map, set up a roadblock with two bulldozers in the small town of Cisco, where Kowalski will be passing. A small crowd gathers at the roadblock, and as Kowalski approaches at high speed, he smiles as he crashes into the bulldozers in a fiery explosion. As firemen work to put out the flames, the crowd slowly disperses.

Cabrera Infante, under the pseudonym Guillermo Cain. The story was based on two actual events: the disgraced career of a San Diego police officer and a high-speed pursuit of a man who refused to stop and was killed when he crashed into a police roadblock. Infante modeled the character of Super Soul after legendary rock and roll singer The Big Bopper. His script reflected the popular counterculture lifestyle of the time, containing elements of rebellion, drugs, sexual freedom, and rock and roll. In 1969, director Richard C. Sarafian turned down an offer to make Robert Redford's Downhill Racer in order to direct Vanishing Point. He was drawn to the counterculture themes in Cain's script. Originally, the director wanted Gene Hackman to play Kowalski, but 20th Century Fox studio executive Richard Zanuck insisted on casting relative unknown actor Barry Newman in the lead role.Siegel 2008, pp. 26‚Äì27. The film marked the first major screen appearances of Cleavon Little and John Amos. The car According to Sarafian, it was Zanuck who came up with the idea of using the new 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T. He wanted to do Chrysler a favor for their longtime practice of providing 20th Century Fox with cars on a rental basis for only a dollar a day. Many of the other cars featured in the film are also Chrysler products.Siegel 2008, p. 27. Stunt Coordinator Carey Loftin said he requested the Dodge Challenger because of the \\"quality of the torsion bar suspension and for its horsepower\\" and felt that it was \\"a real sturdy, good running car.\\" Five Alpine White Dodge Challenger R/Ts were lent to the production by Chrysler for promotional consideration and were returned upon completion of filming. Four cars had 440 engines equipped with four- speeds; the fifth car was a 383 with automatic. No special equipment was added or modifications made to the cars, except for heavier-duty shock absorbers for the car that jumped over No Name Creek. The Challengers were prepared and maintained for the movie by Max Balchowsky, who also prepared the Mustangs and Chargers for Bullitt (1968). The cars performed to Loftin's satisfaction, although dust came to be a problem. None of the engines were blown. Loftin remembers that parts were taken out of one car to repair another because they \\"really ruined a couple of those cars\\" while jumping ramps between highways and over creeks. Newman remembers that the 440 engines in the cars were so powerful that \\"it was almost as if there was too much power for the body. You'd put it in first and it would almost rear back!\\" The Challengers appear in the film with Colorado plates OA-5599.  Filming  Principal photography began in the summer of 1970 with a planned shooting schedule of 60 days.Siegel 2008, p. 28. Financial troubles plaguing the studio at the time forced Zanuck to shorten Sarafian's shooting schedule by 22 days. In response, the director decided not to film certain scenes rather than rush through the rest of the shoot. An average day of filming involved the actors and the crew of 19 men spending many hours traveling to the remote locations, shooting for an extended period of time and then looking for a motel to spend the night.Siegel 2008, pp. 29‚Äì30. The shoot had a few mishaps, including Newman driving a Challenger equipped with three cameras into the bushes in order to avoid a head-on collision when a \\"civilian\\" driver ignored the traffic blocks installed to ensure the safety of the crew.Siegel 2008, pp. 28‚Äì29. The film's cinematographer John Alonzo used light-weight Arriflex II cameras, that offered more free movement.Siegel 2008, p. 29. Close-up and medium shots were achieved by mounting cameras directly on the vehicles instead of the common practice of filming the drivers from a tow that drove ahead of the targeted vehicle. To convey the appearance of speed, the filmmakers slowed the film rate of the cameras. For example, in the scenes with the Challenger and the Jaguar, the camera's film rate was slowed to half speed. The cars were traveling at approximately so that when projected at normal frame rate, they appeared to be moving much faster. Vanishing Point was filmed on location in the American Southwest in the states of Colorado, Utah, Nevada, and California. * Austin, Nevada * Cisco, Utah (the ending) * Denver, Colorado * Esmeralda County, Nevada * Glenwood Springs, Colorado (first motorcycle police chase) * Goldfield, Nevada (Super Soul scenes) * Interstate 70 in Utah * Lander County, Nevada * Nye County, Nevada * Rifle, Colorado * Thompson Springs, Utah * Tonopah, Nevada * Wendover, Utah Dean Jagger's scenes were shot on the Salt Lakes of Nevada.Siegel 2008, p. 30. Super Soul's radio station was filmed in Goldfield, Nevada. All of Cleavon Little's scenes were completed in under three days. Carey Loftin was the film's stunt coordinator and responsible for setting up and performing the major driving stunts. Loftin's resume at the time included work on Grand Prix (1966), Bullitt (1968), and The French Connection (1971). Barry Newman learned from Loftin and was encouraged by the stunt coordinator to do some of his own stunts. In the scene before Kowalski crashes into the bulldozer, Newman drove and performed a 180-degree turn on the road himself without the director's knowledge. The 383 car was also used as the tow vehicle in the crash scene at the end of the movie. A quarter-mile cable was attached between the Challenger and an explosives-laden 1967 Chevrolet Camaro with the motor and transmission removed. The tow vehicle was driven by Loftin, who pulled the Camaro into the blades of the bulldozers at high speed. Loftin expected the car to go end over end, but instead it stuck into the bulldozers, which he thought looked better. Ending The ending (and implicitly the theme of the film) has been the source of much debate, including one interpretation that the entire film is a post-death flashback after the car crashes into the bulldozers. The viewer is left guessing why Kowalski insists on driving to San Francisco immediately and then drives heedlessly across four states to his death. Kowalski says only, \\"I gotta be in Frisco 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.\\" When Jake scoffs that Kowalski is putting him on, Kowalski says, \\"I wish to God I was.\\" Barry Newman offered his interpretation of the film's ending in an interview printed in the March 1986 issue of Musclecar Review, \\"Kowalski smiles as he rushes to his death at the end of Vanishing Point because he believes he will make it through the roadblock.\\" The August 2006 issue of Motor Trend magazine has a sidebar with Newman, in which he explains that Kowalski sees the light glinting from between the two bulldozers. \\"To Kowalski, it was still a hole to escape through. It symbolized that no matter how far they push or chase you, no one can truly take away your freedom and there is always an escape.\\" Newman also thought that the entire film was an essay on existentialism. Kowalski drives to drive, with no real purpose for doing what he's doing. He decides to give his life its definition and meaning, with complete freedom over his actions. Sarafian explained that he wanted to make Kowalski appear otherworldly and that the world within the film was a temporary existence that he was just making a stop in. At the end of the film, he was ascending from this existence into another. The lyrics of the end song underscore this interpretation: \\"Nobody knows, nobody sees, 'til the light of life stops burning, 'til another soul goes free.\\" UK theatrical release The UK theatrical release of the film differs slightly from the US release in plot and running time. In the UK release, Kowalski picks up a mysterious hitchhiker (Charlotte Rampling) toward the end of the film. Kowalski accepts marijuana from her, despite refusing marijuana in several previous scenes. He stops the car when he starts feeling stoned. She says she has been \\"waiting for him, everywhere and since forever.\\" When he awakens the next morning, she is gone without a trace. According to interviews with Barry Newman and commentary from the director, the hitchhiker was meant to be an allegorical figure representing death. This scene was removed from the final US version, reducing the film from 105 minutes to 98 minutes. Newman felt that the scene gave the film \\"an allegorical lift\\" but the studio was afraid that the audience would not understand.Wheeler Winston Dixon: Missing in Action: The Lost Version of Vanishing Point. Film International 3.3.2014 Soundtrack Sarafian wanted to score the majority of the film from an album called Motel Shot by Delaney, Bonnie & Friends. Lionel Newman, head of Fox's music department at the time, denied Sarafian's request because the studio did not want to spend a substantial amount of money obtaining rights to the tracks. The director then suggested that musician Randy Newman score the film, but Fox refused this request as well. After watching the film, musical supervisor Jimmy Bowen wrote three original songs. Delaney, Bonnie & Friends ended up performing a musical number in the film. A soundtrack of the film was released in the United States by Amos Records. The original vinyl album is long out of print. There have been reissues of the soundtrack compact disc in the United States by various record companies including A&M; Records and in Europe by Amos Records. Track listing \\"Nobody Knows\\" is the first ever recording by Kim Carnes, credited on the soundtrack as \\"Kim & Dave\\" (with husband Dave Ellingson). Carnes also wrote the song performed by Big Mama Thornton. The pop music group Delaney, Bonnie & Friends had a small role as a Christian music band, which included singer Rita Coolidge and singer/songwriter David Gates at the piano. The baby held by one of the singers is Bekka Bramlett, who later replaced Stevie Nicks in Fleetwood Mac. Reception Vanishing Point premiered in January 1971 and did not receive positive notices.Siegel 2008, p. 31. In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Charles Champlin wrote, \\"Vanishing Point might have had a point, but it ... ah ... got lost. What's left is sophisticated craft and fashionably hokey cynicism\\". Variety magazine said, \\"While stock car addicts may be able to maintain interest in the ultra-fast manipulation of the car, many viewers will just get car-sick ... or sick of the car, which isn't the same thing\\". Larry Cohen, in the Reporter criticized the film for being \\"calculated, tedious and in desperate need of tightening, the picture, produced by Norman Spencer, is uninvolving and devoid of a cohesiveness that might have made it work\\". Newman recalls that Fox had no faith in the film and released it in neighborhood theaters only to disappear in less than two weeks. However, it was a critical and commercial success in the UK and Europe which prompted the studio to re-release it in the United States on a double bill with The French Connection. After completing its run at the cinema box office, the film gained extended life as it became a second feature favorite in drive-in theaters across the US. A cult following began to develop, due in large part to a broadcast on network television in 1976. The film earned rentals of $4,250,000 in North America.Solomon, Aubrey. Twentieth Century Fox: A Corporate and Financial History (The Scarecrow Filmmakers Series). Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 1989. . p231. Please note figures are rentals accruing to distributors and not total gross. The film currently has a rating of 79% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 19 reviews. In 2014, Time Out polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films. Vanishing Point was listed at 70th place on this list. Legacy=Film Steven Spielberg named Vanishing Point as one of his favorite films. Death Proof (2007), the Quentin Tarantino contribution to the faux-exploitation \\"double feature\\" Grindhouse (2007), features a chase involving a Dodge Challenger resembling the one seen in Vanishing Point (not being an R/T model and having an automatic transmission). Death Proof also references the film by name, repeatedly calling it \\"one of the best American movies ever made\\". The car in the film also has the license plate OA 5599. Edgar Wright named Vanishing Point one of his 1,000 favorite films, and used it as inspiration for his 2017 film Baby Driver. Music Vanishing Point was the inspiration for Primal Scream's 1997 album of the same name. It is meant to be an alternative soundtrack to the film. Lead singer Bobby Gillespie said, \\"The music in the film is hippy music, so we thought, 'Why not record some music that really reflects the mood of the film?' It's always been a favourite of the band, we love the air of paranoia and speed-freak righteousness ... It's a pure underground film, rammed with claustrophobia\\". In addition, a track from the album was named \\"Kowalski\\" after the character from the film. The track also featured samples of Super Soul's \\"last American hero\\" speech from the film. Author Irvine Welsh scripted the video for \\"Kowalski\\" which was directed by musician Douglas Hart. The video features a Dodge Challenger and super model Kate Moss beating up the band. Super Soul's \\"last American hero\\" speech was also incorporated into the lyrics of the Guns N' Roses song \\"Breakdown\\", from their album Use Your Illusion II (1991). The film was the basis for Audioslave's music video \\"Show Me How to Live\\" (2004), directed by the AV Club and which included members of the band in the 1970 Challenger traveling across the desert, following the plot of the movie. Cleavon Little also appears in the video. Television In an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, comedian Jerry Seinfeld takes friend and fellow comedian Brian Regan for coffee in a 1970 Dodge Challenger, stating it was \\"all the rage\\" in the 1970s due to Newman and Vanishing Point. In an episode of Top Gear, presenter Richard Hammond road tests a 2008 Dodge Challenger across Nevada and fondly refers to the film as the inspiration for him choosing that car. Video game and other references  The video game Grid 2 (2013) features a trophy/achievement called Vanishing Point, with the description reading \\"You've won a race in a white Dodge Challenger but lived to tell the tale, unlike Kowalski.\\" The video game ‚Äò‚ÄôDriver: San Francisco‚Äô‚Äô includes a Movie Challenge entitled ‚ÄúVanishing Chance‚Äù which involves piloting a white 1970 Dodge Challenger. Virgin Atlantic's safety film \\"Trip: The Virgin Atlantic Safety Film\\" pays homage to the Challenger @ 1:31. Remake A remake of the film was created for Fox television, first airing in 1997, and also featuring a 1970 Dodge Challenger. The film stars Viggo Mortensen as Jimmy Kowalski (in this version, the character has a first name). Kowalski is rewritten as a suspected militia sympathizer from Idaho, and Jason Priestley as \\"The Voice\\", a white libertarian talk radio shock jock who replaces Super Soul. The sequence of events in the two films is vaguely similar, but the remake removed all of the original's mystical, existential elements, replacing them with a religious motivation for Kowalski's actions. Among many other changes, it also added a sequence in which two cops attempt to chase down the Challenger in a black 1969 Dodge Charger (coining the phrase \\"it takes a Mopar to catch a Mopar\\", which makes little sense in context, given that both cars have the same engine but the Charger is heavier). The remake got extremely poor reviews. Following the release of his 2006 film Southland Tales, Richard Kelly wrote a remake of the film for 20th Century Fox. Home media There were two theatrical releases, a U.S. version and a UK version. Both are included on the Region 1 DVD and Blu-ray Fox released Vanishing Point in the United States on Blu-ray on February 24, 2009. It was also released on Blu-ray in Germany in 2013 under the title Fluchtpunkt San Francisco and has a running time of 99 minutes with English soundtrack. Fabulous Film's released a 2-Disc Blu-ray in June 2019 in the UK featuring both US and UK versions of the film and a load of special features.

Similar in some respects and often mistakenly referred to as a dune buggy or sand car, a sandrail is a different type of speciality vehicle. Sandrails are popularly operated on actual sand dunes. Sandrails can be driven on other types of terrain but are designed specifically for sand. History Sandrail frame advertisement circa 1978 At the end of World War II thousands of soldiers returning from the war had spent years driving Jeeps, tanks, and half-tracks with few or no roads. Having an increased disposable income, these GIs formed the original core of off-road enthusiasm. Initially, they used surplus Jeeps and cut-up cars to build their off-road vehicles. Soon these \\"off-roaders\\" discovered that with little more than a skid plate, they could get a stock air-cooled Volkswagen Beetle to go almost anywhere. Throughout the 1950s the sport continued to develop. In 1958 Pete Beiring of Oceano, Calif., took the body frame or \\"pan\\" from a damaged Volkswagen and shortened it into a new machine that eventually became the precursor to the dune buggy. This eventually led to the first production dune buggy called the \\"Sportster\\", which was developed around 1960 by the EMPI Imp Company. It was an angular sheet metal vehicle built on a stripped-down Volkswagen chassis. Many others followed including the ever popular Meyers Manx design. Dune buggies had a style all their own with fiberglass siding and other \\"heavy\\" body features. As the late 1960s and early '70s approached, enthusiasts saw the need for lighter and more powerful sand vehicles, easily capable of ascending steeper and higher dunes. Many started experimenting at home by building super light weight vehicle frames from metal tubing, often without a roll cage. Many were nothing more than a frame, engine, transmission, wheels and one or two seats. Because of their versatility, light weight and simplicity the air-cooled Volkswagen engine and transmission were the power plant of choice for many owners. It also offered the perfect body arrangement. By placing the motor and transmission in the rear of the frame it allowed the front of the sandrail to remain extremely light and thus able to \\"float\\" over the sand dunes. An added value of placing the engine in the rear of the vehicle was that heat created by the motor did not blow into the face of the driver and passengers. From the 1970s forward, sandrail builders continued to develop the delicate balance between weight and power. Body style Dumont Dunes sandrail video When it comes to serious sand dunes, most off-road vehicles including those with four wheel drive are relatively top heavy and can only safely climb or descend steep hills with a mostly perpendicular approach to inclines or downhills. In the case of driving up a steep sand dune, many would simply \\"dig-in\\" and get stuck. Sandrails are ultra lightweight vehicles often weighing in at 800 and 1500 pounds (‚âà363 and ‚âà680 kg). They typically use high flotation smooth or farm implement front tires and special rear paddle tires, allowing it to skim over the surface of the sand without getting stuck. A sandrail has a low center of gravity, permitting it to make tight turns even on the face of a sand dune. Sandrail frames are built from a tubular space frame chassis that incorporates an integrated roll cage. The distinction between a sandrail and dune buggy or sand car is that the sandrail will rarely have windows, doors, fenders, or full body panels. The sandrail will also be a lighter weight vehicle compared to the sandcar. On most sandrails, the engine is typically at the rear. Some sandrails also use a mid-engine configuration. This design offers favorable weight distribution and traction, which is very desirable for dune \\"hill-climbing\\". Engines and fuel 170HP Volkswagen mid-engine performance sandrail engine Originally becoming popular in the 1960s, sandrails used lightweight air-cooled engines like the Volkswagen engine from the VW Beetle and Porsche (~200 pounds) or the Chevrolet Corvair, Mitsubishi Minica and Cosworth DFV (~350 pounds). Because of the availability of affordable parts, the Volkswagen engine continues to be the mainstay of many sandrails today. At some point in the late 1970s in the wake of the Ford Pinto product liability cases, the first alternative engine was sourced from the Pinto, primarily the 2.0L and 2.3L. More recently, some enthusiasts have turned to lighter weight water-cooled engines such as the Subaru boxer or GM Ecotec engines. The need for more power comes from necessity and desire when driving in steep sand dunes. This has driven sandrail engine builders to add performance features to engines such as the stock (24 to 50 horse power) Volkswagen engine. These include: larger pistons, turbochargers, dual racing carburetors, fuel injection, and high performance cylinder heads. Some performance engines can run on premium unleaded gasoline. However, many high performance engines must use racing fuel or fuel additives. A high performance sandrail Volkswagen engine can produce well into the 170-200+ horse power range and as high as 700 horse power with methanol fuel. Most sandrails use a manual transmission, although automatic transmissions are used as well. Accessories Early sandrails often consisted of little more than a steering wheel, brakes and accelerator. However, today an entire industry is built around all kinds of accessories such as HID and LED headlamps, radios, passenger communications headsets and GPS navigation devices. Other applications US Navy Seal sandrail, 2010 Some states in the USA, such as Arizona and Utah, allow the registration of sandrails and other primarily off- road vehicles for \\"on-road\\" use. In these states, sandrails registered for on- road use usually must meet the minimum insurance coverage required by normal vehicles. Additionally, they may require modifications to be road worthy this typically includes a wind shield, turning signals and license plate. These requirements may vary by state. Sandrails have been employed by US state authorities, the United States Border Patrol and even the military. They are still in use today by the Navy SEALs. The military design of these vehicles is based on the Chenowth Advanced Light Strike Vehicle model and have been modified for a third seat above the engine to control a .50 caliber machine gun and other armaments. State authorities, such as rangers at sand dune parks sometimes employ sandrails removing the passenger seat to convert the sandrail into a makeshift ambulance with a stretcher. Although sandrails are primarily designed for the sand, they have been successfully used on \\"soft pack\\" dirt, mud and even snow. Some of these types of applications usually require the use of off-road type tires vs. \\"sand\\" tires. They are typically not well suited for rocky terrain due to their mostly limited suspension and lighter duty frames. Safety Accidents most often occur in collisions with other off- road vehicles, and are frequently the result of not being seen. In many dune areas, all sand vehicles (motorcycles, quads, sandrails, UTVs and sandcars) are required to use an eight-foot antenna whip and flag. This is critical to being seen by other vehicles as a driver traverses from one dune to the next. Most sandrails employ a variety of safety features for the driver and passengers. The most common is the use of a three-point safety belt system. Many sand rails also utilize roll bar padding and fire extinguishers. More advanced safety features sometimes include: arm and wrist restraints, netting for large frame openings, automatic fuel cut-off switches and horns. Additionally, the use of eye protection (goggles and ballistic-grade glasses) is considered a necessity. Finally, the use of helmets while \\"duning\\" is increasing due to the advances in performance. Sand associations along with state and federal land management agencies work to provide dune safety information through pamphlets, online and in classes. Future, industry and associations Sandcar at Silver Lake Sand Dunes Due to its economical cost to build and maintain, access to new parts and good balance between weight and power, the sandrail continues to be used by many enthusiasts today. However, the heavier and typically more powerful sandcar now represents another style for duners. This style often employs mammoth cars weighing several thousand pounds and using highly advanced suspension systems and transmissions coupled with large performance V8 engines such as the latest GM LS engine series, Ford Coyote engine series or Range Rover engine series. Associations such as ASA hold events throughout the year in some parts of the country for sand racing and hill climbing. Additionally, these associations provide representation for enthusiasts with legislators and land management officials.

Haxo became famous in the Siege of Antwerp in 1832. He is the nephew of revolution era General Nicolas Haxo of √âtival- Clairefontaine and Saint-Di√©-des-Vosges in Lorraine, France. Biography Fran√ßois-Nicolas-Beno√Æt Haxo was born in Lun√©ville, France and began his career with the Military engineers (G√©nie Militaire) in 1793. Haxo embraced the military early in his career. He finished the School of Artillery and Engineers of Chalons-sur-Marne in 1793 with the rank of Lieutenant Minor. Soon after, Haxo earned the rank of Captain of Engineers in the Army of the Rhine in 1794. In 1796, he attended √âcole Polytechnique. In 1801, he became a battalion commander following the capitulation of Fort Bard (1 June 1800) by the Army of Italy, part of the French military in 1792 - 1802. Haxo has been called the Vauban of the nineteenth century given his work repairing and reinforcing various fortifications and citadels in the early 1800s. This work became necessary as a result of the development of more sophisticated artillery since the time of Vauban (1633 ‚Äì 1707). For example, in Besan√ßon in the late seventeenth century, guns did not have enough range to reach the citadel from the hills of Bregille and Chaudanne, whose peaks were higher. However, in the early nineteenth century, guns improved and artillery shelling became possible. Haxo built a fort on each of the two hills to prevent the enemy seizing them and using them for artillery shelling. In 1807, Haxo was responsible for improving the defenses of Constantinople. He then went to Italy, to serve under General Chasseloup. In 1809, having been promoted to Major, he distinguished himself in the Siege of Zaragoza. Napoleon I then appointed him Colonel. Haxo took part in the Battle of Wagram, and then returned to the Iberian Peninsula to direct the siege operations of Louis- Gabriel Suchet's army in Catalonia and Valencia. In 1810, he was promoted to Brigadier General and gained the title of baron in 1811. In the same year, he helped to prepare the occupied fortresses of Germany against a possible Russian invasion. In 1812, he was chief engineer of Louis-Nicolas Davout's I Corps, and after the retreat from Moscow, was promoted to the rank of Division General. In 1813, in addition to commanding the Guard Engineers, he constructed the works around Hamburg, making defense of Davout's fortress possible. On 30 August, he was wounded and taken prisoner with General Dominique Vandamme during the Battle of Kulm. After the Restoration, Louis XVIII of France wished to give Haxo a command in the Royal Guards, but the general remained faithful to Napoleon. During the Hundred Days, Haxo laid out the provisional fortifications of Paris and fought at the Battle of Waterloo. It was after the Second Restoration that the best work of his career was accomplished. As Inspector General he managed to reconstruct the old Vauban and Cormontaigne fortresses, which had failed during the invasions of 1814 and 1815. In 1815, he was relieved from the military by the Restoration government. In 1819, however, he was reinstated as Inspector General of frontier fortifications (Grenoble, Besan√ßon, Dunkirk, St. Omer, Sedan, the Fort Lock, Belfort, and Bitche). Haxo was part of the Council of War called upon to judge General Charles Lefebvre-Desnouettes and voted for his death. Monster Mortar used during the Siege of the citadel of Antwerp Appointed Inspector General of the Royal Weapon and Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour, Louis Philippe I named him Peer of France in 1832 and presented him with the Grand Cross in 1833, as well as state counselor and member of the fortifications committee. During this time, Haxo voted against detached forts, instead supporting their continuous enclosure. Soon after he was named Peer of France, the French intervention in Belgium began involving the Siege of Antwerp. Under √âtienne Maurice G√©rard, Haxo directed the besiegers and completely outmatched the opposing engineers. The fortress was forced to surrender after a siege of a little more than three weeks, ending on 23 December 1832. Subsequently, Haxo was regarded as the premier military engineer in Europe. He oversaw the fortifications of Belfort, Grenoble, Besan√ßon, Dunkirk, Saint-Omar and Fort l'Ecluse. He is credited with the invention of an open-backed covered gun emplacement, known in English as the Haxo casemate. During the later years of his life, Haxo wrote M√©moire sur le figure du terrain dans les cartes topographiques (Paris, N.D.), and the biography of General Dejean (1824). General Haxo died in Paris on 25 June 1838.

The unit's motto is \\"Determined\\" and its badge is a Pony Express Rider. Role As with all reserve communication squadrons, the primary role is to augment the Regular Force for both domestic and international operations, including those with the United Nations and NATO. International deployments include most recently Afghanistan, Bosnia and the Golan Heights. Soldiers have also been deployed to the Manitoba floods, BC forest fires, Ontario ice storms and the 2002 G8 summit in Kananaskis Country. From 2000 until 2003, the unit's focus was on strategic communications, typically voice and data over MSAT and HF. From 2004 on, the unit role changed to focus on tactical (field) communications, VHF and limited HF. UPDATE: As of 2013 - 746 Communication Squadron is now known as 41 Signals 3 Squadron Composition 746 Communication Squadron comprises mainly signal operators and line technicians, as well as a normal squadron complement of support trades. History 746 Communication Squadron traces its history back to Number XIII Detachment, Signalling Corps, which was housed in Mewata Armories in 1913. In 1920, Number 13 Signal Company was raised in Calgary under the command of Major J.E. Hanning. In 1923 the unit was designated as 13th Signal Battalion, and in 1934 changed designation yet again to 13th Divisional Signals under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Harry Pryde. During World War II the main function of 13 Signals was to train communicators for posting to units going overseas. In 1949 the unit was renamed to 7th Independent Signal Squadron, Royal Canadian Corps of Signals. Two years after the 1968 unification of the Canadian Armed Forces, and the formation of Canadian Forces Communication Command, the name was changed to 746 (Calgary) Communication Squadron. The unit was moved from Mewata Armouries to the Naval Reserve building in 1987. On 9 May 2000 the squadron became part of 74 Communication Regiment but has since become an independent squadron of 73 Communication Group once again.

Paddle tires are mainly used on off road vehicles, specifically designed for use in sand and mud. They consist of a smooth tire core which has a series of large rubber cups (or paddles) attached to it. The volume inside of a paddle is much larger than the void of a knobby tire, so it is unlikely to clog up with sand/mud. A street legal mud tire is a more or less normal tire, but with extra large gaps or \\"voids\\" between each tread block (called \\"lugs\\") to allow centrifugal force to \\"self-clean\\" or fling the mud out of the gap. Smaller gaps trap the mud in between the tire lugs, which turns the tire into something resembling a \\"slick\\" with no tread at all, which will have no traction in mud. A paddle tire is an even more extreme version of this, optimized for mud or sand. The paddle provides superior traction in the sand, in part because the paddles dig into the sand and push off from the buried sand, not just the surface, and in mud, the gigantic \\"voids\\" give no place for mud to stick. They work something like a paddle wheel on a paddle- steamer. Street legal mud tires are a compromise between large voids and a smooth rolling shape for on-road use. The more \\"extreme\\" a mud tire (such as a \\"Super Swamper\\") is, the harsher and louder it is on a hard surface. A \\"tractor tire\\" on a farm tractor is a somewhat milder version of a paddle tire, only the voids are smaller to allow for limited use on hard surfaces, and the \\"lugs\\" are angled to give lateral traction. A paddle tire is so optimized for mud that the shape is of no use on anything other than a soft surface, since the vibration and lack of control of the tire would otherwise render a vehicle almost unusable. One other way the paddle tire is a specialized application only is that it gives only forward/rearward traction. This means that it is used on a wheel that drives a vehicle to push it forward, but gives little \\"lateral\\" (side-to-side) traction. For that reason, the tires of the vehicle that steer it are generally more \\"normal\\" tires, since a paddle tire on a steering wheel will just slide sideways rather than pulling the vehicle with it. So, many 4WD vehicles will use paddle tires only on the rear, even though the front wheels are powered as well. On a 2WD or a motorbike, the rear wheel is the only drive wheel, and so putting a paddle tire on the front wheels is useless or worse, since steering performance will be negatively impacted. Paddle tires are available for motocross bikes, all- terrain vehicles, sandrails, and 4 wheel drives. Because the paddles are rigid and stick up several inches, they are not suitable for use on roads or hard terrain, and are not road legal in most places. Often on rear wheel drive quads and dirt bikes specific front sand tires are used in conjunction with rear paddle tires. These front tires are usually called \\"razorbacks\\" or simply \\"ribbed\\" front tires. The tire carcass overall is smooth with the exception of one to three longitudinal ribs around the circumference of the tire. These ribs are usually about an inch high. This design promotes flotation in the sand due to the smooth part of the tire but also, using the rib to dig into the sand, it provides extra turning force.

With a large net worth, he was also a major philanthropist, and many educational and cultural landmarks in the U.S. city of Atlanta, Georgia, bear his name. Included among these are the Woodruff Arts Center, Woodruff Park, and the Robert W. Woodruff Library. Early life Woodruff was born in Columbus, Georgia, the son of Ernest Woodruff, an Atlanta businessman who, among other things, was leader of the group of investors who bought The Coca-Cola Company from Asa Griggs Candler in 1919. His grandfather was Atlanta manufacturing magnate Robert Winship. After graduating from the Georgia Military Academy he attended Georgia Tech, where he failed out, and then the Emory University campus at Oxford, Georgia, for one term, where he excelled at \\"cutting classes and spending money\\". Career In February 1909, at age 19, spurning his father's work offers, he began work as a laborer at the General Pipe and Foundry Company foundry in Inman Park, Atlanta. For a week he shoveled and shifted sand, then worked a lathe as a machinist's apprentice. After a year he was fired. But then he was rehired by General's parent company, General Fire Extinguisher where he worked his way into sales. He then accepted a job offer from his father at Atlantic Ice and Coal Company but left after differences with him. Woodruff parlayed his love of early automobiling into a sales position at White Motor Company based in Cleveland, Ohio, and quickly rose to become vice president of that company. During World War I, Woodruff joined the U.S. Ordnance Department where he promoted a truck design that only White Motors could fulfill, giving the company huge war-time sales. In an effort to reconcile personal differences, his father Ernest offered Robert Woodruff the position as president of the Coca-Cola Co. In 1926, at the age of 37, Woodruff built Coca-Cola into an international company, establishing a foreign department. In 1954, he stepped down as president but remained on the board of directors until 1984. His large shareholding and influence on the board's powerful Finance Committee gave him significant control over much of the company's direction for almost 60 years. Woodruff died on March 7, 1985, at the age of 95. He was buried at the Westview Cemetery in Southwest Atlanta. The Robert W. Woodruff Foundation received funds from the estate and continues his legacy of philanthropy in the state of Georgia. Woodruff's personal chauffeur was Luther Cain, Jr., father of businessman and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain. Legacy In 1979, Woodruff and his brother George W. Woodruff gave $105 million to Emory University; they would eventually give a total of $230 million. Several buildings on the Emory campus are named for him and members of his family. The Robert W. Woodruff Professorships are named for him. He also gave large sums of money to other area colleges and universities and to Woodward Academy (formerly Georgia Military Academy) in College Park and the Westminster Schools in Atlanta. A Boy Scout camp in Blairsville, Georgia named the Robert W. Woodruff Scout Reservation, which is run by the Atlanta Area Council, was built following major donations from the Woodruff Foundation and Coca-Cola. Atlanta's largest cultural institution, the Woodruff Arts Center, benefited from his gifts and is named for him, as is Woodruff Park. A Robert W. Woodruff library is located in the Atlanta University Center and serves Morehouse College, Spelman College, and Clark Atlanta University. Another Robert W. Woodruff Library houses Emory University's main library. Woodruff was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1977. Woodruff was instrumental in the success of the dinner held in Atlanta honoring the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., after King received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Ticket sales were lagging until Woodruff signaled his support for the dinner.\\"Judgment Days: Lyndon Baines Johnson, Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Laws\\", First Mariner Books, 2006, p. 263 ReferencesFurther reading *Allen, Frederick, Secret Formula, HarperCollins, 1994. . *Pendergrast, Mark, For God, Country, and Coca-Cola, Basic Books, 2000. . *Kennedy, Doris Lockerman Devotedly, Miss Nellie, A Biographical Tribute to Nell Hodgson Woodruff, ASIN: B0006EDMMI Emory University, 1982.

The original indigenous people of the region are Tuluvas (Bunts, Billavas, Mogaveeras, Kulalas, Devadigas, Jogis).

She was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature no fewer than eight times. Early life Under was born in Reval (now Tallinn), Estonia to school teachers Priidu (1843‚Äì1930) and Leena Under (n√©e Kerner) (1854‚Äì1934). She had two older siblings, Evangeline (1880‚Äì1932?) and Gottried (1881‚Äì1882) and two younger, Berta (1885‚Äì1974), and Christfried (1887‚Äì1934). She attended a private German girls' school. After graduating, she worked as a salesclerk in a bookstore. In her free time, she wrote poetry in German. In 1902, she married an Estonian accountant, Carl Hacker. The couple had two children, Dagmar and Hedda, while living in Kuchino, a suburb of Moscow. However, in 1904, she fell in love with the Estonian artist Ants Laikmaa. Laikmaa convinced her to translate her poetry into Estonian and submitted her translated works to local newspapers. Portrait of Marie Under by Estonian artist Ants Laikmaa in 1904 Return to Estonia In 1906, Under returned to Reval. In 1913, she met Artur Adson, who became her secretary. He also compiled the first volumes of her published poetry. In 1924, Under divorced Carl Hacker and married Adson. In the late 1910s, Under was involved in the influential Siuru literary movement. Named after a fire-bird in Finno-Ugrian mythology, it was founded in 1917 and was an expressionistic and neo-romantic movement that ran counter to the Young Estonia formalist tradition. Other Estonian poets and authors involved in the Siuru movement at the time were Peet Aren, Otto Krusten, Friedebert Tuglas, Artur Adson, August Gailit, Johannes Semper and Henrik Visnapuu. Between 1917 and 1919, the group of poets published three volumes of poetry. In 1919 conflicts within the group led Visnapuu and Gailit to leave, while Johannes Barbarus and August Alle joined as new members.Jean Albert B√©d√©, William Benbow Edgerton, Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature, Columbia University Press, 1980, , p237Rubulis, Aleksis. Baltic Literature. University of Notre Dame Press,1970. Under was one of the founders of Estonian Writers' Union in 1922. In the 1920s, Under was a frequent visitor at the house of Igor Severyanin, a Russian poet, in the village of Toila, where she often was on holiday. Severyanin published a book of translations from Under. Severyanin did not speak Estonian and used word- by-word translations as a basis. Life in exile Under and Adson's graves in the Skogskyrkog√•rden in Sweden. Beginning in September 1944, the U.S.S.R. reoccupied Estonia. Under and her family fled to Sweden. They spent almost a year in a refugee camp. In 1945, the family moved to M√§larh√∂jden, a suburb of Stockholm, Sweden, where Under lived until her death on 25 September 1980. She died in Stockholm and is buried in the Skogskyrkog√•rden in Stockholm. In January 2015 it was announced that she was to be reburied in Estonia.

Naomasa's father, Naochika, was falsely convicted of treason by Yoshimoto's paranoid successor, Imagawa Ujizane, and was subsequently killed. Naomasa, then a very small child, was personally lucky to escape his father's fate. After many difficulties, Ii Naotora succeeded the Ii clan and acted as the guardian of Naomasa; she adopted Naomasa to later succeed her. When Ii Naotora began working with Tokugawa Ieyasu after visiting him in Hamamatsu, she sent Naomasa to his care. Service under Ieyasu Ii Naomasa joined the ranks of the Tokugawa clan in the mid-1570s, rising swiftly through the ranks to eventually become the master of a sizable holding in ≈åmi Province, following the Battle of Sekigahara (1600). His court title was Hy≈çbu-day≈´. Naomasa initially garnered mass attention at the Battle of Nagakute (1584), commanding around three thousand musketeers with distinction and defeating the forces led by Ikeda Tsuneoki. In the battle, Naomasa fought so valiantly that it elicited praise from Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who was on the opposing side. Following the battle, Hideyoshi's mother was sent to stay with Naomasa in genteel captivity, cementing an alliance between the Tokugawa and the Toyotomi. After Naomasa helped ensure victory during the siege of Odawara (1590) by breaching the castle walls and contributing to the H≈çj≈ç clan's surrender, he was given Minowa Castle in K≈çzuke and 120,000 koku, the largest amount of land owned by any of the Tokugawa retainers. Naomasa's finest hour was to come at the Battle of Sekigahara, where his unit outpaced those of other generals such as Fukushima Masanori, drawing the \\"first blood\\" of that battle. However, as the fighting was dying down, Naomasa was shot and wounded by a stray bullet during his attempt to prevent Shimazu Yoshihiro's getaway, a wound from which he would never fully recover. The wound also prevented his personal involvement in quelling the last vestiges of the anti-Tokugawa faction in the coming months. According to legend, Naomasa was feared so much by his own men, that when he was critically wounded at Sekigahara, not a single one of them committed ritual seppuku, the act of honor killing to prevent a samurai from falling into enemy hands, out of fear of retaliation. As such, Naomasa was able to regain his composure and escape with his life. The units Naomasa commanded on the battlefield were notable for being outfitted almost completely in blood-red armour for psychological impact, a tactic he adopted from Yamagata Masakage, one of Takeda Shingen's generals. As such, his unit became known as the \\"Red Demons\\", a nickname he shared. It has also been rumored, although never confirmed, that Naomasa would sometimes wear a \\"monkey mask\\" into battle, including at Sekigahara. Death and legacy Ii Naomasa's premature death in 1602 has been widely blamed on the wound he received at Sekigahara. Naomasa was highly regarded by Tokugawa Ieyasu, so it is no surprise that his sons Naotsugu and Naotaka succeeded him in his service and title. However, Naotsugu managed to anger Ieyasu by refusing to take part in his campaign to reduce the Toyotomi clan stronghold at Osaka. Nonetheless, the Ii remained influential in Japanese politics throughout the Edo period. In theater and other contemporary works, Naomasa is often characterized as the opposite of Ieyasu's other great general, Honda Tadakatsu. While both were fierce warriors of the Tokugawa, Tadakatsu survived countless battles without ever suffering an injury, while Naomasa is often depicted as enduring many battle wounds, but fighting through them. Naomasa's sets of armour are all preserved within Hikone Castle and are accessible for viewing.

This is usually done by help of stochastic asset models. The advantage of Monte Carlo methods over other techniques increases as the dimensions (sources of uncertainty) of the problem increase. Monte Carlo methods were first introduced to finance in 1964 by David B. Hertz through his Harvard Business Review article, discussing their application in Corporate Finance. In 1977, Phelim Boyle pioneered the use of simulation in derivative valuation in his seminal Journal of Financial Economics paper. This article discusses typical financial problems in which Monte Carlo methods are used. It also touches on the use of so-called \\"quasi-random\\" methods such as the use of Sobol sequences. Overview The Monte Carlo method encompasses any technique of statistical sampling employed to approximate solutions to quantitative problems. Essentially, the Monte Carlo method solves a problem by directly simulating the underlying (physical) process and then calculating the (average) result of the process. This very general approach is valid in areas such as physics, chemistry, computer science etc. In finance, the Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the various sources of uncertainty that affect the value of the instrument, portfolio or investment in question, and to then calculate a representative value given these possible values of the underlying inputs. (\\"Covering all conceivable real world contingencies in proportion to their likelihood.\\" The Flaw of Averages , Prof. Sam Savage, Stanford University.) In terms of financial theory, this, essentially, is an application of risk neutral valuation; see also risk neutrality. Some examples: *In Corporate Finance, project finance and real options analysis, Monte Carlo Methods are used by financial analysts who wish to construct \\"stochastic\\" or probabilistic financial models as opposed to the traditional static and deterministic models. Here, in order to analyze the characteristics of a project‚Äôs net present value (NPV), the cash flow components that are (heavily ) impacted by uncertainty are modeled, incorporating any correlation between these, mathematically reflecting their \\"random characteristics\\". Then, these results are combined in a histogram of NPV (i.e. the project‚Äôs probability distribution), and the average NPV of the potential investment - as well as its volatility and other sensitivities - is observed. This distribution allows, for example, for an estimate of the probability that the project has a net present value greater than zero (or any other value). See further under Corporate finance. *In valuing an option on equity, the simulation generates several thousand possible (but random) price paths for the underlying share, with the associated exercise value (i.e. \\"payoff\\") of the option for each path. These payoffs are then averaged and discounted to today, and this result is the value of the option today.TEACHING NOTE 96-03: MONTE CARLO SIMULATION Note that whereas equity options are more commonly valued using lattice based models, for path dependent exotic derivatives - such as Asian options - simulation is the valuation method most commonly employed; see Monte Carlo methods for option pricing for discussion as to further - and more complex - option modelling. *To value fixed income instruments and interest rate derivatives the underlying source of uncertainty which is simulated is the short rate - the annualized interest rate at which an entity can borrow money for a given period of time; see Short-rate model. For example, for bonds, and bond options, under each possible evolution of interest rates we observe a different yield curve and a different resultant bond price. To determine the bond value, these bond prices are then averaged; to value the bond option, as for equity options, the corresponding exercise values are averaged and present valued. A similar approach is used in valuing swaps, swaptions, and convertible bonds. As for equity, for path dependent interest rate derivatives - such as CMOs - simulation is the primary technique employed;Frank J. Fabozzi: Valuation of fixed income securities and derivatives, pg. 138 (Note that \\"to create realistic interest rate simulations\\" Multi-factor short-rate models are sometimes employed.Donald R. van Deventer (Kamakura Corporation): Pitfalls in Asset and Liability Management: One Factor Term Structure Models) *Monte Carlo Methods are used for portfolio evaluation. Here, for each sample, the correlated behaviour of the factors impacting the component instruments is simulated over time, the resultant value of each instrument is calculated, and the portfolio value is then observed. As for corporate finance, above, the various portfolio values are then combined in a histogram, and the statistical characteristics of the portfolio are observed, and the portfolio assessed as required. A similar approach is used in calculating value at risk, a better known application of simulation to portfolios. * Monte Carlo Methods are used for personal financial planning. For instance, by simulating the overall market, the chances of a 401(k) allowing for retirement on a target income can be calculated. As appropriate, the worker in question can then take greater risks with the retirement portfolio or start saving more money. *Discrete event simulation can be used in evaluating a proposed capital investment's impact on existing operations. Here, a \\"current state\\" model is constructed. Once operating correctly, having been tested and validated against historical data, the simulation is altered to reflect the proposed capital investment. This \\"future state\\" model is then used to assess the investment, by evaluating the improvement in performance (i.e. return) relative to the cost (via histogram as above); it may also be used in stress testing the design. See Discrete event simulation #Evaluating capital investment decisions. Although Monte Carlo methods provide flexibility, and can handle multiple sources of uncertainty, the use of these techniques is nevertheless not always appropriate. In general, simulation methods are preferred to other valuation techniques only when there are several state variables (i.e. several sources of uncertainty). These techniques are also of limited use in valuing American style derivatives. See below. Applicability=Level of complexity Many problems in mathematical finance entail the computation of a particular integral (for instance the problem of finding the arbitrage-free value of a particular derivative). In many cases these integrals can be valued analytically, and in still more cases they can be valued using numerical integration, or computed using a partial differential equation (PDE). However, when the number of dimensions (or degrees of freedom) in the problem is large, PDEs and numerical integrals become intractable, and in these cases Monte Carlo methods often give better results. For more than three or four state variables, formulae such as Black‚ÄìScholes (i.e. analytic solutions) do not exist, while other numerical methods such as the Binomial options pricing model and finite difference methods face several difficulties and are not practical. In these cases, Monte Carlo methods converge to the solution more quickly than numerical methods, require less memory and are easier to program. For simpler situations, however, simulation is not the better solution because it is very time-consuming and computationally intensive. Monte Carlo methods can deal with derivatives which have path dependent payoffs in a fairly straightforward manner. On the other hand, Finite Difference (PDE) solvers struggle with path dependence.  American options  Monte-Carlo methods are harder to use with American options. This is because, in contrast to a partial differential equation, the Monte Carlo method really only estimates the option value assuming a given starting point and time. However, for early exercise, we would also need to know the option value at the intermediate times between the simulation start time and the option expiry time. In the Black‚ÄìScholes PDE approach these prices are easily obtained, because the simulation runs backwards from the expiry date. In Monte-Carlo this information is harder to obtain, but it can be done for example using the least squares algorithm of Carriere (see link to original paper) which was made popular a few years later by Longstaff and Schwartz (see link to original paper).  Monte Carlo methods =Mathematically The fundamental theorem of arbitrage-free pricing states that the value of a derivative is equal to the discounted expected value of the derivative payoff where the expectation is taken under the risk-neutral measure [1]. An expectation is, in the language of pure mathematics, simply an integral with respect to the measure. Monte Carlo methods are ideally suited to evaluating difficult integrals (see also Monte Carlo method). Thus if we suppose that our risk-neutral probability space is \\\\mathbb{P} and that we have a derivative H that depends on a set of underlying instruments S_1,...,S_n. Then given a sample \\\\omega from the probability space the value of the derivative is H( S_1(\\\\omega),S_2(\\\\omega),\\\\dots, S_n(\\\\omega)) =: H(\\\\omega) . Today's value of the derivative is found by taking the expectation over all possible samples and discounting at the risk-free rate. I.e. the derivative has value: : H_0 = {DF}_T \\\\int_\\\\omega H(\\\\omega)\\\\, d\\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\omega) where {DF}_T is the discount factor corresponding to the risk-free rate to the final maturity date T years into the future. Now suppose the integral is hard to compute. We can approximate the integral by generating sample paths and then taking an average. Suppose we generate N samples then : H_0 \\\\approx {DF}_T \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{\\\\omega\\\\in \\\\text{sample set}} H(\\\\omega) which is much easier to compute.  Sample paths for standard models  In finance, underlying random variables (such as an underlying stock price) are usually assumed to follow a path that is a function of a Brownian motion 2. For example, in the standard Black‚ÄìScholes model, the stock price evolves as : dS = \\\\mu S \\\\,dt + \\\\sigma S \\\\,dW_t. To sample a path following this distribution from time 0 to T, we chop the time interval into M units of length \\\\delta t, and approximate the Brownian motion over the interval dt by a single normal variable of mean 0 and variance \\\\delta t. This leads to a sample path of : S( k\\\\delta t) = S(0) \\\\exp\\\\left( \\\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\mu - \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{2}\\\\right)\\\\delta t + \\\\sigma\\\\varepsilon_i\\\\sqrt{\\\\delta t}\\\\right] \\\\right) for each k between 1 and M. Here each \\\\varepsilon_i is a draw from a standard normal distribution. Let us suppose that a derivative H pays the average value of S between 0 and T then a sample path \\\\omega corresponds to a set \\\\\\\\{\\\\varepsilon_1,\\\\dots,\\\\varepsilon_M\\\\\\\\} and : H(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac1{M} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{M} S( k \\\\delta t). We obtain the Monte-Carlo value of this derivative by generating N lots of M normal variables, creating N sample paths and so N values of H, and then taking the average. Commonly the derivative will depend on two or more (possibly correlated) underlyings. The method here can be extended to generate sample paths of several variables, where the normal variables building up the sample paths are appropriately correlated. It follows from the central limit theorem that quadrupling the number of sample paths approximately halves the error in the simulated price (i.e. the error has order \\\\epsilon=\\\\mathcal{O}\\\\left(N^{-1/2}\\\\right) convergence in the sense of standard deviation of the solution). In practice Monte Carlo methods are used for European-style derivatives involving at least three variables (more direct methods involving numerical integration can usually be used for those problems with only one or two underlyings. See Monte Carlo option model.  Greeks  Estimates for the \\"Greeks\\" of an option i.e. the (mathematical) derivatives of option value with respect to input parameters, can be obtained by numerical differentiation. This can be a time-consuming process (an entire Monte Carlo run must be performed for each \\"bump\\" or small change in input parameters). Further, taking numerical derivatives tends to emphasize the error (or noise) in the Monte Carlo value - making it necessary to simulate with a large number of sample paths. Practitioners regard these points as a key problem with using Monte Carlo methods.  Variance reduction  Square root convergence is slow, and so using the naive approach described above requires using a very large number of sample paths (1 million, say, for a typical problem) in order to obtain an accurate result. Remember that an estimator for the price of a derivative is a random variable, and in the framework of a risk-management activity, uncertainty on the price of a portfolio of derivatives and/or on its risks can lead to suboptimal risk- management decisions. This state of affairs can be mitigated by variance reduction techniques. = Antithetic paths = A simple technique is, for every sample path obtained, to take its antithetic path -- that is given a path \\\\\\\\{\\\\varepsilon_1,\\\\dots,\\\\varepsilon_M\\\\\\\\} to also take \\\\\\\\{-\\\\varepsilon_1,\\\\dots,-\\\\varepsilon_M\\\\\\\\}. Since the variables \\\\varepsilon_i and -\\\\varepsilon_i form an antithetic pair, a large value of one is accompanied by a small value of the other. This suggests that an unusually large or small output computed from the first path may be balanced by the value computed from the antithetic path, resulting in a reduction in variance. Not only does this reduce the number of normal samples to be taken to generate N paths, but also, under same conditions, such as negative correlation between two estimates, reduces the variance of the sample paths, improving the accuracy. = Control variate method = It is also natural to use a control variate. Let us suppose that we wish to obtain the Monte Carlo value of a derivative H, but know the value analytically of a similar derivative I. Then H* = (Value of H according to Monte Carlo) + B*[(Value of I analytically) ‚àí (Value of I according to same Monte Carlo paths)] is a better estimate, where B is covar(H,I)/var(H). The intuition behind that technique, when applied to derivatives, is the following: note that the source of the variance of a derivative will be directly dependent on the risks (e.g. delta, vega) of this derivative. This is because any error on, say, the estimator for the forward value of an underlier, will generate a corresponding error depending on the delta of the derivative with respect to this forward value. The simplest example to demonstrate this consists in comparing the error when pricing an at-the-money call and an at-the-money straddle (i.e. call+put), which has a much lower delta. Therefore, a standard way of choosing the derivative I consists in choosing a replicating portfolios of options for H. In practice, one will price H without variance reduction, calculate deltas and vegas, and then use a combination of calls and puts that have the same deltas and vegas as control variate. = Importance sampling = Importance sampling consists of simulating the Monte Carlo paths using a different probability distribution (also known as a change of measure) that will give more likelihood for the simulated underlier to be located in the area where the derivative's payoff has the most convexity (for example, close to the strike in the case of a simple option). The simulated payoffs are then not simply averaged as in the case of a simple Monte Carlo, but are first multiplied by the likelihood ratio between the modified probability distribution and the original one (which is obtained by analytical formulas specific for the probability distribution). This will ensure that paths whose probability have been arbitrarily enhanced by the change of probability distribution are weighted with a low weight (this is how the variance gets reduced). This technique can be particularly useful when calculating risks on a derivative. When calculating the delta using a Monte Carlo method, the most straightforward way is the black-box technique consisting in doing a Monte Carlo on the original market data and another one on the changed market data, and calculate the risk by doing the difference. Instead, the importance sampling method consists in doing a Monte Carlo in an arbitrary reference market data (ideally one in which the variance is as low as possible), and calculate the prices using the weight-changing technique described above. This results in a risk that will be much more stable than the one obtained through the black-box approach.  Quasi-random (low- discrepancy) methods  Instead of generating sample paths randomly, it is possible to systematically (and in fact completely deterministically, despite the \\"quasi-random\\" in the name) select points in a probability spaces so as to optimally \\"fill up\\" the space. The selection of points is a low-discrepancy sequence such as a Sobol sequence. Taking averages of derivative payoffs at points in a low-discrepancy sequence is often more efficient than taking averages of payoffs at random points.  Notes  # Frequently it is more practical to take expectations under different measures, however these are still fundamentally integrals, and so the same approach can be applied. # More general processes, such as L√©vy processes, are also sometimes used.

The growth of such bodies has been encouraged by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), which has provided advisory and support services, and facilitated access for NHRIs to the UN treaty bodies and other committees. There are over one hundred such institutions, about two-thirds assessed by peer review as compliant with the United Nations standards set out in the Paris Principles. Compliance with the Principles is the basis for accreditation at the UN, which, uniquely for NHRIs, is not conducted directly by a UN body but by a sub-committee of the International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions (ICC). The secretariat to the review process (for initial accreditation, and reaccreditation every five years) is provided by the National Institutions and Regional Mechanisms Section of the OHCHR. NHRIs can be grouped together in two broad categories: human rights commissions and ombudsmen. While most ombudsman agencies have their powers vested in a single person, human rights commissions are multi-member committees, often representative of various social groups and political tendencies. They are sometimes set up to deal with specific issues such as discrimination, although some are bodies with very broad responsibilities. Specialised national institutions exist in many countries to protect the rights of a particular vulnerable group such as ethnic and linguistic minorities, indigenous peoples, children, refugees persons with disabilities or women. However, in general terms national human rights institution have an explicit and specific human rights mandate and a broader mandate, which could include research, documentation and training and education in human rights issues, than the classical ombudsman model which tends to work on handling complaints about administrative deficiencies. While all human rights violations are maladministration, only a small proportion of the workload of an ombudsman deals with violations of human rights standards. In most countries, a constitution, a human rights act or institution-specific legislation will provide for the establishment of a national human rights institution. The degree of independence of these institutions depends upon national law, and best practice requires a constitutional or statutory basis rather than (for example) a presidential decree. Nations human rights institutions are also referred to by the Vienna Declaration and Programme of ActionVienna Declaration and Programme of Action, Part II para 84 and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Article 33 Functions Special commissions have been established in many countries to ensure that laws and regulations concerning the protection of human rights are effectively applied. Commissions tend to be composed of members from diverse backgrounds, often with a particular interest, expertise or experience in the field of human rights. Human rights commissions are concerned primarily with the protection of those within the jurisdiction of the state against discrimination or mistreatment, and with the protection of civil liberties and other human rights. Some commissions concern themselves with alleged violations of any rights recognized in the constitution and/or in international human rights instruments. One of the most important functions vested in many human rights commissions is to receive and investigate complaints from individuals (and occasionally, from groups) alleging human rights abuses committed in violation of existing national law. While there are considerable differences in the procedures followed by various human rights commissions in the investigation and resolution of complaints, many rely on conciliation or arbitration. It is not unusual for a human rights commission to be granted authority to impose a legally binding outcome on parties to a complaint. If no special tribunal has been established, the commission may be able to transfer unresolved complaints to the normal courts for a final determination. NHRIs are usually able to deal with any human rights issue directly involving a public authority. In relation to non-state entities, some national human rights institutions have at least one of the following functions: * addressing grievances or disputes involving certain kinds of company (for instance state-owned enterprises, private companies providing public services, or companies that operate at the federal level) * addressing only certain types of human rights issue (for instance non-discrimination or labour rights) * addressing complaints or disputes raising any human rights issue and involving any company. Additionally they may promote and protect the responsibilities of the state and the rights of the individual by: * providing advice to the state to help determine its international and domestic human rights obligations and commitments * receiving, investigating and resolving human rights complaints * providing human rights education and publicity for all sections of society (particularly minority groups such as refugees) * monitoring the human rights situation in the state and its subsequent actions * engaging with the human rights international community to advocate for human right recommendations and to raise pressing issues for the state. Promoting and educating human rights may involve informing the public about the commission's own functions and purposes; provoking discussion about various important questions in the field of human rights; organizing seminars; holding counselling services and meetings; as well as producing and disseminating human rights publications. Another important function of a human rights commission is systematically reviewing a government's human rights policy in order to detect shortcomings in human rights observance and to suggest ways of improving. This often includes human rights proofing of draft legislation, or policies. The degree to which the recommendations or rulings produced by a human rights institution can be enforced varies based on the human rights climate surrounding the institution. Human rights commissions may also monitor the state's compliance with its own and with international human rights laws and if necessary, recommend changes. The realization of human rights cannot be achieved solely through legislation and administrative arrangements; therefore, commissions are often entrusted with the important responsibility of improving community awareness of human rights. According to the Paris Principles, the national human rights institutions are obliged to make \\"preparation of reports on the national situation with regard to human rights in general, and on more specific matters\\"; and this is mostly done in annual status reports.  Reason for establishing national human rights institutions  The International Council on Human Rights Policy reported that NHRIs are established in three key ways: in countries that are experiencing conflict (usually internal like South Africa, Ireland or Spain), or to respond to claims of serious human rights abuses. NHRIs can also be established as visual institutional security, as a body that is seen to be dealing with prevalent issues (such as seen in Mexico and Nigeria), or finally to underpin and consolidate other human rights protections (such as in Australia and New Zealand). National governments wanted to establish institutions which reflected their own opinions and cultural identity more effectively. In this regard they enable states to set their own agendas that reflect their individuality. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights passed resolutions in 1992 which recommended promotion of such institutions by government's that did not yet have any, and also promote the development of those that did. At the end of the 20th Century the United Nations Commission would take over tasks that require international involvement. Regional human rights agreements also encouraged this development and establishment of human rights institutions as technical assistance was provided through international arrangements (such as the Asia-Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions). NHRIs in some member states work at the international and regional level (such as in the European Union). They may work as preventative mechanisms for non-discrimination of minority groups or international crimes (such as torture). The authority and expertise that NHRIs customarily hold provides them the ability to promote equal treatment. Ultimately they are a useful tool in assisting states to comply with international rights standards by providing a uniquely objective perspective and addressing and resolving issues at the domestic level. Coupled with the United Nations, NHRIs are protecting and providing comprehensive and wide- ranging solutions. However some states are unwilling to give effect to these sanctions, and the United Nations is unable to conduct the widespread and analytical monitoring of countries. In order to be legitimate, effective and credible NHRIs must be independent and effective. One of the most effective tools that NHRIs have is their unique position between the responsibilities of government and the rights of civil society and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). This conceptual space gives NHRIs a positively distinctive role, acting as a different protection service for the people and different tools available to hold the state and other bodies accountable for human rights breaches. However being independent from government and NGOs provides greater difficulty when funding, and working relationships are taken into account. In most countries they receive government funding, and are also created and appointed by a governmental body. This creates somewhat of a parallel obligation and taints the idea of the institutions autonomy and makes it harder to pursue their individual agenda.  Paris Principles  The Paris Principles were conceived at a 1991 conference convened by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Although the priorities and structure of them differ from country to country they have core features. Part A.3 of the Paris Principles adopted in March 1993 by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights provides that NHRIs responsibilities are to ratify human rights treaties and cooperation with human rights mechanisms. The workshop recommendations provide a basis for assessing the effectiveness and independence of a NHRI, identifying six key criteria for states seeking to establish such institutions or to become effective: * independence from government (allowing them to act as a check or balance) * independence granted from constitution or legislation (both financially and otherwise) * appropriate powers of investigation without referral from a higher authority or receipt of an individual complaint * pluralism, allowing them to coexist with the governing body * adequate financial and human resources * clearly defined and broad mandate including the protection and promotion of universal human rights. Those NHRI that fully comply with these fundamental criteria and have shown independence are accredited an \\"A status\\", while those that only partially fulfil them receive a \\"B status\\". Those that are given \\"A status\\" are allowed to participate in discussion on the United Nations Human Rights Council discussions and more broadly, its mechanisms. The Subcommittee on Accreditation determines the \\"status\\" of each NHRI which can be appealed to the Coordinating Committee's Chair within 28 days. \\"C status\\" NHRIs are labelled as such due to a perception of non-compliance with the Paris Principles, but may still participate in gatherings as observers. The Committee reviews these decisions every five years, giving the institutions multiple opportunities to show further independence or compliance with the Paris Principles. Aiming to be transparent, vigorous and thorough in its evaluations the Committee will provide advice on how best to earn \\"A status\\" and comply with the Paris Principles.  International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights  The International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (ICC) is a representative body of institutions worldwide. Its goal is to develop and create effective and independent NHRIs around the world. These institutions meet the \\"A status\\" (voting member) requirements of the Paris Principles and encourages inter- institutional cooperation. In addition to organising international conferences for NHRIs it will also help those institutions in need of assistance and will occasionally help governments to create NHRIs when requested.  International Ombudsman Institute  NHRIs can deal with a variety of issues including torture, discrimination, environment and employment rights. In addition to human rights commissions they can be constituted or legislated as an ombudsman or a hybrid human-rights ombudsman. The International Ombudsman Institute provides support for the national ombudsman institutions for human rights who similarly protect and promote human rights. They are more concerned with state administration processes and so receive and make complaints in regards to any systematic or administrative human rights breaches or concerns.  International Coordinating Committee of NHRIs  The international Coordinating Committee of NHRIs was established in 1993 with a Bureau composed of one representative from the Americas, Asia Pacific, Africa and Europe. The Coordinating Committee organises an annual meeting and a biennial conference that facilitates and supports NHRI engagement with the United Nations system. At these gatherings NHRIs are able to share their expertise on specific topics and engage with the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), which acts as a Secretariat of the Coordinating Committee. In order to facilitate NHRI dialogue with civil society the Coordinating Committee also holds an NGO forum. The Coordinating Committee may also be asked by a government to assist in making a new NHRI or to develop on pre existing ones. Not all of the following NHRIs are accredited through the ICC.

His work is concerned with landscape and mythology, but he also composed portraits. He is best known for his illustrations of early editions of Bland tomtar och troll (Among Gnomes and Trolls), an anthology of Swedish folklore and fairy tales. Bauer was born and raised in J√∂nk√∂ping. At 16 he moved to Stockholm to study at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts. While there he received his first commissions to illustrate stories in books and magazines, and met the artist Ester Ellqvist, whom he married in 1906. He traveled throughout Lappland, Germany and Italy early in his career, and these cultures deeply informed his work. He painted and illustrated in a romantic nationalistic style, in part influenced by the Italian Renaissance and Sami cultures. Most of his works are watercolors or prints in monochrome or muted colours; he also produced oil paintings and frescos. His illustrations and paintings broadened the understanding and appreciation of Swedish folklore, fairy tales and landscape. When Bauer was 36, he drowned, together with Ester and their son Bengt, in a shipwreck on Lake V√§ttern in southern Sweden.  Biography = Early life and education  A young John Bauer John Bauer was born and raised in J√∂nk√∂ping, the son of Josef Bauer, a man of Bavarian origin, and Emma Charlotta Wadell, from a farming family from the town Rogberga just outside J√∂nk√∂ping. Josef Bauer came to Sweden in 1863, penniless. He founded a successful charcuterie business at the √ñstra Torget in J√∂nk√∂ping. The family lived in the apartment above the shop until 1881 when the construction of their house in Sj√∂vik was completed. John, born in 1882, lived at the Villa Sj√∂vik by the shore of Lake Rocksj√∂n with his parents and two brothers, one older and one younger; his only sister died at a young age. The family home would remain central to him long after he lived on his own. His initial schooling was at the J√∂nk√∂pings H√∂gre Allm√§na L√§roverk (The J√∂nk√∂ping Public School of Higher Education), followed by the J√∂nk√∂pings Tekniska Skola (The J√∂nk√∂ping Technical School) from 1892 to 1898. He spent most of his time drawing caricatures of his teachers and daydreaming, something not appreciated by his teachers. He was given to sketching and drawing from an early age, without encouragement from his family. However, when he turned sixteen and wanted to go to Stockholm to study art, they were enthusiastic for him and backed him financially. In 1898, he was one of the 40 applicants to study at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts, and although he was deemed well qualified for a place at the academy, he was too young to be accepted. He spent the next two years at the Kaleb Ahltins school for painters. During this time he was, like many teenagers, torn between hope and despair, something that is reflected in his artwork. By 1900, he was old enough to attend the Academy of Arts, and was one of the three students admitted that year; the two other successful applicants were his friends Ivar Kamke and Pontus Lanner. He studied traditional illustrations and made drawings of plants, medieval costumes and croquis; all of which served him in his later work. One of his teachers, professor and noted historic painter, Gustaf Cederstr√∂m praised Bauer: While at the academy, he received his first commissions to illustrate magazines (including the S√∂ndags-Nisse and Sn√∂flingan) and books (e.g. De gyllene b√∂ckerna, Ljungars saga and L√§nge, l√§nge sedan). In 1904 he traveled to Lappland to create paintings for a book on the culture of the county and its \\"exotic wilderness\\". At the end of 1905, he left the academy and put \\"Artist\\" on his business card.  Journey to Lappland  Following the discovery of iron ore deposits in the north of Sweden, Lappland became a frontier for industrial development, instead of an exotic wilderness of the Sami culture and midnight sun. Opportunistically, Carl Adam Victor Lundholm published his Lappland, det stora svenska framtidslandet (Lappland, the great Swedish land of the future). He engaged noted Swedish artists‚Äîsuch as , Alfred Th√∂rne, Per Daniel Holm and Hjalmar Lindberg‚Äîto create the illustrations. Since Bauer was an inexperienced illustrator by comparison, Lundholm tested his abilities by sending him to create some drawings of Sami people at Skansen. Although reluctant to audition for the commission, on 15July 1904 Bauer left for Lappland and stayed there for a month. Coming from the dense, dark forests of Sm√•land he was overwhelmed by the open vistas and colorful landscapes. His encounters with the Sami people and their culture became important for his later works. He took many photos, sketched and made notes of the tools, costumes and objects he saw, but he had difficulty becoming close to the Sami, due to their shyness. He recorded his experiences in his diary and in letters to his family and friends. After a visit to a Sami goahti he noted: \\"All light from above. If the head is tilted forward it is dark. The lit parts of the figure always lighter than the tent canvas. Sharp shadows run like spokes from the middle of the goathi.\\" The book on Lappland was published in 1908, with eleven watercolors by Bauer. They were painted in Stockholm, almost 18 months after his visit, using the photos and sketches he had collected during his journey. Many of the photos resulted in other drawings and paintings. Most of these were romanticized versions of the photos, but he succeeded in capturing the nuances and ambiance of the goahtis, and the richness of the Sami garments and crafts. Details from the Sami culture, such as the bent knives, shoes, spears, pots and belts, became important elements in the clothes and ornamentations of Bauer's trolls. Bauer's eye for detail and his numerous notes also made the material an ethnographic documentation of the era.  Courtship and marriage  The Fairy Princess, 1904, oil sketch Bauer met fellow student Ester Ellqvist at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts. Ellqvist studied at the separate department for women, since women were not allowed to attend the same classes as the men and their education was conducted in a different manner. So, while Ellqvist was talented and ambitious, she did not have an equal opportunity as her male colleagues to develop her artistry, and society's expectation was that her role in life would be that of housewife, not artist. Bauer started courting her in 1903, but since they were apart most of the time, this was done by mail. Their relationship developed as they shared their dreams, aspirations, doubts and insecurities in their correspondence. For Bauer, Ellqvist became his inspiration, muse, and \\"fairy princess\\"; it was as such he painted her for the first time in Sagoprinsessan (The Fairy Princess). He made sketches for the painting in 1904, and finalized them in an oil painting in 1905. Ellqvist is portrayed as a strong, enlightened and unobtainable Valkyrie. The painting was shown at Bauer's first exhibition at the Valand Academy in Gothenburg in 1905 (where he was one of eleven debutants) and in Norrk√∂ping in 1906, where it was sold to a private collector. It is now in the J√∂nk√∂pings l√§ns museum. Bauer tried to mold Ellqvist into his vision of a creature of the woods and as the perfect artist's wife; he wanted her to make a home for them in a romantic cottage in the woods, while he wandered about the forest seeking inspiration. Ellqvist, on the other hand, had been raised in Stockholm and was a lively person who enjoyed the social life that could only be found in towns or cities. She wanted to settle down in a comfortable place with a husband and have children. Bauer was not sufficiently established an artist to provide for a family; throughout his entire lifetime he relied on his parents for financial support. When he proposed to Ellqvist, Bauer did so without the approval of his parents, who thought that he should be more established in a career and self- supporting before marriage. On 18December 1906, Bauer and Ellqvist were married. Little is known of their first years together since they now lived in the same house, making letters unnecessary. Bauer had jobs illustrating covers for magazines, like Hvar 8 Dag, and began work on Bland tomtar och troll (Among Gnomes and Trolls). In 1908, John and Ester traveled to Italy together; on their return they found a house, the \\"Villa Bj√∂rkudden\\", situated on the shores of Lake Bunn just outside Gr√§nna. They bought the house in 1914, and the following year their son Bengt (called \\"Putte\\") was born. The birth of Putte marked a harmonious and joyful time for the couple. Bauer made his final illustrations for Among Gnomes and Trolls, his grand farewell to the series, which freed him to explore playwriting and make frescos. He showed his paintings at exhibitions and experimented with modernism, but all this came at a cost. Bauer was often away, leaving Ellqvist alone at home, and he no longer had the steady income that the illustrations had provided. By 1917, their marriage was in trouble, and in 1918, Bauer put his thoughts about a divorce in a letter to his wife. Over time, Bauer used Ellqvist as a model less frequently. With the birth of their son, Bauer started to paint pictures with children as part of the composition. The painting Rottrollen (The Root Trolls), completed in 1917, is of Putte sleeping among troll-shaped roots in a forest.  Journey to Italy  Self-portrait, 1908, oil on canvas Bauer and his wife made a long journey to Italy at Josef's expense in 1909. They chose to travel through Germany and on to Italy based on his readings of medieval towns during a 1902 visit to Germany with his father. The couple visited Verona, Florence, Siena and spent two months in Volterra. They continued through Naples and Capri, spending the winter in Rome. Throughout their travels they studied art and visited churches and museums, which appealed to Bauer's eclectic mind. In the evenings they went to small tavernas to enjoy the ambiance; all of which is recorded in the letters they sent home to Bauer's family. Bauer's sketchbooks are full of studies of antique objects and Renaissance art, some of which he used for his illustrations. A portrait of Ghirlandaio by Sandro Botticelli is said to be the basis for Svanhamnen (The Swan maiden), and Piero della Francesca's work was the inspiration for Den helige Martin (Saint Martin, the Holy). He also became intrigued by frescoes. He was exuberant in the study of art, but he also became homesick for the quiet serenity of the Swedish forest which resulted in some of his best winter pictures with white snow, dark woods and the sky glittering with tiny stars. Their journey was abandoned after a murder in their building in Rome. Bauer was interrogated by Italian police due to a misunderstanding. He was never a suspect but the situation became public, leaving a bitter memory of their visit to Rome.  Death on Lake V√§ttern  Bauer, Ester and their three- year-old son, Bengt, were on their way to their new home in Stockholm, where Bauer hoped for spiritual renewal and a new life for himself and his family. A recent, well-publicized train accident at Get√• caused Bauer to book their return to Stockholm by boat, the steamer Per Brahe. The SS Per Brahe in Stockholm after the salvage On the night of 19November 1918, when the steamer left Gr√§nna it was loaded with iron stoves, plowshares, sewing machines and barrels of produce. All the cargo did not fit into the hold and a significant portion was stored unsecured on deck, making the ship top-heavy. The weather was bad and by the time the steamer was at sea a full storm was raging; the wind caused the cargo on deck to shift, some of it falling overboard, further destabilizing the ship. The ship capsized and went down, stern first, just from the next port, H√§stholmen, killing all 24 people on board, including the Bauers. Most of the passengers had been trapped in their cabins. The wreckage was found on 22November 1918 at a depth of , and was salvaged on 12August 1922. Investigations indicated that just one third of the cargo had been stowed in the hold, the rest unsecured on deck. The salvage operation turned into a bizarre public attraction; for example, a sewing machine from the steamer was smashed into pieces and sold for one crown each. It is estimated that about 20,000 people came to watch the raising of the ship, requiring the addition of trains from Norrk√∂ping. Newsreels featuring the raising of the ship were shown in cinemas all over Sweden. In order to finance the salvage operation, the Per Brahe was sent on a macabre tour throughout Sweden. The newspapers fed people's superstitions that the mythical creatures of the forests had claimed Bauer by sinking the ship. The most common theme was connected to the tale Agneta och sj√∂kungen (Agneta and the Sea King) from 1910 in which the Sea King lures a maiden into the depths. On 18August 1922, the Bauers were buried at the √ñstra cemetery in J√∂nk√∂ping (in quarter 04 plot number 06).  Career  Bauer at his working desk.  Subjects  Bauer's favorite subject was Swedish nature, the dense forests where the light trickled down through the tree canopies. Ever since he was little he had wandered in the dark woods of Sm√•land imagining all the creatures living there. His paintings frequently included detailed depictions of plants, mosses, lichens and mushrooms found in the Swedish woods. He is best known for his illustrations of Among Gnomes and Trolls. In a 1953 article in Allers Familje-journal (Allers Family Journal), his friend Ove Eklund stated that \\"although [Bauer] only mumbled about and never said clearly\\", he believed that all the creatures he drew actually existed. Eklund had on several occasions accompanied Bauer on his walks through the forests by Lake V√§ttern, and Bauer's description of all the things he thought existed made Eklund feel he could see them as well.  Inspiration  Bauer and his friends were part of a generation of Swedish painters who started their careers just before the Modernism movement began to flourish, but at the same time were considerably younger than those dominating the Swedish art scene: artists such as Carl Larsson, Anders Zorn and Bruno Liljefors. Bauer was inspired by these artists, but from his heritage came in contact with Fritz Erler, Max Klinger and other German illustrators. He lived in an era when the Old Norse were romanticized throughout Scandinavia, and borrowed ideas and motifs from artists like Theodor Kittelsen and Erik Werenski√∂ld, yet his finished works were in his own style. After his journey to Italy his works clearly showed elements from the 14th century Renaissance. The pictures of princes and princesses had elements from Flemish tapestries, and even the trolls garments were pleated, much like the draped clothing seen in antique Roman sculptures.  Style  Bauer had a time-consuming technique when painting: he would start with a small sketch, no bigger than a stamp, with just the basic shapes. Then he would make another, slightly bigger, sketch with more details. The sketches grew progressively in size and detail until the work reached its final size. Most of the originals for About Gnomes and Trolls are square pictures about . He doodled on anything at hand, from used stationery to the back of an envelope. Many of his sketches resemble cartoon strips where the pictures get bigger and more detailed. He would also do several versions of the same finished picture, such as one where the motif is depicted in a summer and winter scene. He did not observe the traditional hierarchy in the mediums or techniques at that time. He could make a complete work in pencil or charcoal just as well as a sketch in oil. From an early age Bauer had to adapt his illustrations to contemporary printing technique. Full-colour was expensive, so the illustrations were made in one colour plus black. As the process developed and his works became in greater demand, his pictures were eventually printed in full colour.  Watercolor  One evening around midsummer, they went with Bianca Maria deep into the forest, 1913, watercolor The most noted of Bauer's pictures are his watercolors, the technique he used when illustrating for books and magazines; he alternated between aquarelle and gouache. When he created illustrations the two mediums were sometimes mixed, since he needed both the speed of the aquarelle and the contrast and impasto that the gouache provided. These water-soluble, and fast drying, media allowed Bauer to work on his pictures until the last minute before deadline, something he was prone to do.  Among Gnomes and Trolls  In 1907, Bauer was asked by the √Öhl√©n & √Ökerlund publishing house (now Bonnier Group) to illustrate their new series of books, Among Gnomes and Trolls. The books would be published annually, and contain stories by prominent Swedish authors. The majority of Bauer's pictures for the book were full-page watercolor illustrations in a muted color scheme; he also contributed with covers, vignettes and other smaller illustrations. Bauer's most significant creatures, the trolls, were rendered in shades of gray, green, and brown, the colors of the forests, as if these beings had grown from the landscape itself. Due to the limitiations of the technology available to his printers, the 1907‚Äì10 editions were produced in just two colors: black and yellow. Some of Bauer's original paintings for these prints were in full color. In 1911, when Bauer again was asked to illustrate the book, he made it clear to the publisher that he wanted to retain his pictures along with the copyrights after publication. The publishing house had kept the original illustrations for the previous editions and considered them their property. Bauer was backed up in his request by other artists facing the same problem. The publishers did not budge from their position and without Bauer's illustrations, book sales dropped. The publisher yielded to Bauer for the 1912 edition; he was again illustrating his own book. Printing techniques had also been updated and the pictures could be printed in three colors: black, yellow and blue. With this technical improvement, the prints almost resembled Bauer's original paintings. Bauer illustrated the 1913‚Äì15 editions, printed in the same three colors as previously. 1913 marked the peak of his performance in these books, and Bauer's illustrations from that edition are among the most reproduced of his works. In 1914, his illustrations started to be influenced by the Italian Renaissance. At that time Bauer wanted to stop illustrating the series, but was contractually obligated to illustrate one more edition. 1915 was the last year he worked with trolls and gnomes; he said he \\"was done with them and wanted to move on\\". The war in Europe had altered Bauer's vision of the world and he stated that he could no longer imagine it as a fairy tale.  Tuvstarr  Still, Tuvstarr sits and gazes down into the water, 1913, watercolor √Ñnnu sitter Tuvstarr kvar och ser ner i vattnet (Still, Tuvstarr sits and gazes down into the water), painted in 1913, is one of Bauer's most noted works. Until the 1980s, the most reproduced and publicized of Bauer's works were two paintings depicting the princess and the moose from Sagan om √§lgtjuren Skutt och lilla prinsessan Tuvstarr (The Tale of the Moose Hop and the Little Princess Cotton Grass), published in 1913. The first picture is of the princess riding on the moose and the second is of the moose standing guard over the sleeping princess. They were mainly used as pictures on the wall in nurseries. The same tale also contains the picture of Tuvstarr gazing down into the tarn looking for her lost heart, an allegory of innocence lost. Bauer made several studies of this motif. During the 1980s the painting of Tuvstarr and the tarn was used in advertising for a shampoo. This started a debate in Sweden about how works of art, considered part of the national heritage, should be used. In 1999, the picture again appeared in advertising, this time in a manipulated version in which all the trees had been cut down and Tuvstarr seemed to be lamenting them. The award-winning advertising campaign was made by the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation and helped further the newly awakened environmental movement in Sweden. In his biography on Bauer, Gunnar Lindqvist argues that the picture has become too commercialized.  Oil painting  Bauer created most of his major works in oil at the beginning of his career, since this was the traditional technique taught at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts. The trip to northern Sweden resulted in many sketches and watercolors for the Lappland book, but also in an oil on canvas entitled, K√•sovagge (1904). From 1903 to 1905, he made several portraits and landscapes influenced by Expressionism. He also made his first oil of Ester, The Fairy Princess, a painting with elements from the Pre-Raphaelites. This work indicates what kind of paintings Bauer wanted to do, but his commissions from illustrating \\"Among gomes and trolls\\" got in the way. He wrote that he \\"felt like a Jack-of-all-trades\\", and made regular outbursts in letters to editors and publishers asking for his help, saying that he \\"had to work, he wanted a future painting in oil and the rest be damned\\". By the time he ceased painting his trolls and gnomes, he was tired and worn out and turned to other venues such as scenography, writing a compendium on drawing to be used in schools, and starting with frescos. He never got to revisit oil painting fully before he drowned.  Large works  Freja, 1905, oil sketch As in his earlier works at the academy, Bauer showed an interest in large frescos and, after his visit to Italy, this interest grew. His first chance to create a major work using this technique was in 1912, when he completed a fresco-secco mural, Vill-Vallareman, at the home of publisher Erik √Ökerlund. In 1913, he was asked to do a fresco for the Odd Fellows lodge in Nyk√∂ping, Den helige Martin (Saint Martin, the Holy). At the same time, the new Stockholm Court House was under construction. Contests regarding decorations for the building were held, and most of the noted Swedish artists at that time presented entries and suggestions. Bauer made a number of sketches for these competitions, but his confidence failed and he did not submit any of his drafts. Bauer's last large work was an oil painting for the auditorium at the Karlskrona flickl√§roverk (The Karlskrona School for Girls) in 1917. It depicts Freja, the old Norse goddess of love, war and magic. Ester posed nude for the painting; Bauer shows her as strong, sensual and forceful. Their friends teasingly called it the \\"breast picture of Mrs. Bauer\\".  Exhibitions  Some of the exhibitions of his work during his lifetime were: * 1905 Gothenburg * 1906 Norrkoping * 1911 Rome * 1913 Munich * 1913 Dresden * 1913 Brighton * 1913 Stockholm * 1914 Malm√∂ * 1915 San Francisco ‚Äì Bauer was awarded the medal of honor. Posthumous exhibitions include: * 1934‚Äì45 Traveling exhibition * 1968 J√∂nk√∂pings l√§ns museum, J√∂nk√∂ping * 1973 Thielska galleriet, Stockholm * 1981‚Äì82 Nationalmuseum, Stockholm * 1993 Milesg√•rden, Stockholm * 1994 G√∂teborgs konstmuseum, Gothenburg  Collections  The J√∂nk√∂pings l√§ns museum owns over 1,000 paintings, drawings and sketches by Bauer, which is the world's largest collection of his artwork. He is also represented at the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, the Gothenburg Museum of Art and the Malm√∂ konstmuseum. The John Bauer Museum in Ebenhausen, Germany is a museum dedicated to the life and works of Bauer.

He considered the praise he received for his pictures of trolls and princesses to be \\"a nice pat on the head for making funny pictures for children\\". He wanted to paint in oil and make what he called \\"real art\\", but he needed the money he received for his illustrations. His self-doubts were contrary to his public persona and how he presented himself in self-portraits: strong minded but self-deprecating.  Legacy  Bauer's pictures continue to be popular at art auctions. At a sale in 2014, one of Bauer's gouaches, Humpe I trollskogen (Humpe in the Troll Forest), sold for 563,500 kronor (about US$87,000), and a watercolor, En riddare red fram (A Knight Rode Forth), made 551,250 kronor (c. US$85,100). The John Bauer Monument in J√∂nk√∂ping His illustrations have been reprinted many times, and are considered among the classics in fairy tales. , books with Bauer's pictures have been published in ten languages. Bauer's works have influenced Sulamith W√ºlfing, Kay Nielsen, Brian Froud, Rebecca Guay, and other illustrators. In his biography on Bauer, Gunnar Lindqvist states that: \\"Although Bauer's work is sometimes credited to have influenced that of Arthur Rackham, and vice versa, these artists did not come in contact with each other's works until the 1910s when they had already established their own style. Any similarities must therefore be credited to their common inspirations by the romantic Munich art of the late 1800s and the art of Albrecht D√ºrer.\\" In J√∂nk√∂ping, a memorial in honour of Bauer stands in the Town park, which was created in 1931 by Swedish sculptor Carl Hultstr√∂m. Hultstr√∂m also made a bust in bronze of Bauer, which sits in the National Portrait Gallery at Gripsholm Castle. Celebrating John Bauer's centennial birthday in 1982, the Swedish postal service issued three stamps with motifs from Among Gnomes and Trolls. Four more were issued in 1997. A park and an adjacent street at the place where Villa Sj√∂vik, Bauer's family home, once stood were named after him. The area is now part of the municipality of J√∂nk√∂ping. In Mullsj√∂ a street was named after Bauer, and in Nyk√∂ping a square was named after him.  Popular culture  At dusk she often snuck out just to get a whiff of the good smell, 1914, watercolor *In 1986, Sveriges Television produced and broadcast the movie Ester‚Äîom John Bauers wife (Ester‚ÄîAbout John Bauers Wife). Ester was played by Lena T.

In the 2011 census, its population was 1,777. Minsterley lies one mile south-west of Pontesbury and 10 miles south-west of Shrewsbury. East from Minsterley along the A488, is the larger village of Pontesbury and to its south the hill range, the Stiperstones. The Rea Brook flows nearby and the smaller Minsterley Brook flows through the centre of the village. Little Minsterley is a hamlet on the northeastern edge of the village, which was founded in 1901. Between it and the main village is located one of the Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service's retained fire stations. Governance Until the 19th century, Minsterley was part of the parish of Westbury, hence its description under Westbury in John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870‚Äì72) like this: : \\"WESTBURY,... parish includes Minsterley chapelry, and forms a sub-district. Acres, 11,274....The p[erpetual]. curacy of Minsterley is a separate benefice. There are dissenting chapels, an endowed school with ¬£30 a year, and charities ¬£44.\\" Minsterley civil parish is governed by a parish council separate from that of Westbury, is represented on the Shropshire Council and in parliament in the Shrewsbury & Atcham constituency. Churches Minsterley church The parish church of Holy Trinity was built at the end of the 17th century, by the Thynne family of Longleat and houses an internationally famous collection of maiden's garlands.Goodall, John (2015). Parish Church Treasures. London: Bloomsbury; p. 176 The exterior of the west end of the Church is notable for the stonework memento mori, which include skull and crossbones and hourglasses. The churchyard contains war graves of a soldier of World War I and a soldier of World War II. The village also has active Congregationalist and Methodist churches. Industry It is home to a large dairy which came under M√ºller ownership in January 2013 (previously it was owned by Uniq Foods) and a meat canning factory, Rea Valley Foods part of Zwanenberg Food Group UK. Amenities and historic sites Village amenities include: a primary school, a cemetery, a public house ('The Crown and Sceptre'- one of the oldest buildings in the village), a petrol station/supermarket (operated by Co- operative), post office, veterinary surgery, florist, and fish and chip shop. The Parish Hall is one of the largest village halls in Shropshire and is the venue for the annual Minsterley Eisteddfod which held its 50th anniversary in 2012. The area adjacent to the 'Crown and Sceptre' public house was where the annual Hiring Fair was held in the late 19th century. Young people, of work age, would be hired by local landowners for the year in return for an agreed sum of money to be paid at the following year's fair. The parish war memorial, unveiled in 1920, stands in the centre of Minsterley beside the main road. It is in the form of a granite Celtic cross and said to be based on that of St. Ives, Cornwall. The list of World I dead is headed by Viscount Weymouth, eldest son of the Marquess of Bath, whose family were lords of the manor and who was killed in France in 1916. Minsterley Hall Minsterley Hall, a Grade II* listed house built in 1581, lies on the edge of the village. Formerly the Shropshire seat of the Marquess of Bath, the house was greatly extended in 1653 for Sir Henry Frederick Thynne, and restored and altered in 1872 by John Thynne, 4th Marquess of Bath. It is timber framed with plaster infill, some underbuilding in red brick with grey sandstone dressings, and has tile roofs. There are two storeys and an attic, and the house consists of a two-bay range, a two-bay cross-wing to the northeast, and a two-bay cross-wing to the southwest. It has three gables to the west and one gable and two dormers to the east. The upper floors are jettied with moulded bressumers, and the gables have bargeboards and finials. The windows vary; some are mullioned and transomed, some are casements, and others are cross-windows. The master bedroom features an ornate Italian marble fireplace commissioned for the house by the 4th Marquess during his Grand Tour. The drawing room features a 15th Century screen thought to be taken from Caus Castle. The house remains in private ownership. Transport The Minsterley branch line which was built as a joint GWR/LNWR line, opened on 14 February 1862. This railway line ran nine and a half miles from Shrewsbury via Cruckmeole Junction near Hanwood to the stations at Plealey Road, Pontesbury and finally the terminus at Minsterley. The creation of the line enabled milk to be transported by rail from the large creamery at Minsterley and lead ore to be transported from the nearby mines at Snailbeach. At one time the terminus in Minsterley boasted a milk wharf, goods shed, cattle and horse docks and numerous sidings. The line closed in May 1967.

Scratchboard refers to both a fine-art medium, and an illustrative technique using sharp knives and tools for engraving into a thin layer of white China clay that is coated with dark, often black India ink. There is also foil paper covered with black ink that, when scratched, exposes the shiny surface beneath. Scratchboard can be used to yield highly detailed, precise and evenly textured artwork. Works can be left black and white, or colored. History Modern scraperboard originated in the 19th century in Britain and France. As printing methods developed, scraperboard became a popular medium for reproduction because it replaced wood, metal and linoleum engraving. It allowed for a fine line appearance that could be photographically reduced for reproduction without losing quality. It was most effective and expeditious for use in single-color book and newspaper printing. From the 1930s to 1950s, it was one of the preferred techniques for medical, scientific and product illustration. During that time period, Virgil Finlay made very detailed illustrations, often combining scraperboard methods with traditional pen & ink techniques, and producing highly detailed artworks. In more recent years, it has made a comeback as an appealing medium for editorial illustrators of magazines, ads, graphic novels, and one of a kind pieces of fine art displayed in galleries and museums internationally.  Technique  Unlike many drawing media, where the artist adds in the mid-tones and shadows, with scratchboard the artist is working by adding in the highlights. The artist can use a variety of tools to scratch away the black ink from the board and reveal more or less of the white clay that is underneath (see materials list below for tools). After black ink has been removed as desired the work may be considered complete, or subsequently be colored with watercolors, airbrush, ink, color pencil or acrylics. Transparent media are generally used to color scratchboard, as they fill in the white scratches without affecting the black ink left on the board. After an area has been colored it can be scratched again, revealing more of the white clay. Sometimes the artist will color and scratch several times to create subtle shading or color variations. This technique can yield a graphic image that can be very detailed. Artists that begin with a white clay-coated board will add their own ink to the surface, and then scratch away the ink in the same manner as described above. After completion, the artwork may be varnished to protect it against damage. This is a cross section of a standard scratchboard. By removing the black ink with a sharp tool you expose the white clay. Sunflower and Silver by Diana Lee A detail of Sunflower and Silver to show scratching technique. Materials and tools Scratchboard itself comes either with a paper (cardboard) backing, or a hardboard support. While the cardboard does have its uses, as it can be easily cut into size, the hardboard is much superior, giving greater stability to the work, being able to be corrected more often. It is more durable and easier to scratch into for cleaner, crisper details and lines. Several tools have been created specifically for scratchboard; however any sharp implement will do though a range of blades of different thicknesses allows the removal of more or less of the ink at will (see variety of tools listed below). Isopropyl Alcohol on a cotton swab or cotton ball, sandpaper and non-oily, fine, steel wool are also useful for removing large areas, and creating texture. Coloring scratchboard, black or white boards, can be done with many media applied with paint brush, air brush, and even cotton balls. Special scratchboard colored inks can be added to the white areas and then scratched again for additional highlights and volume for added dimension. While some artists choose to make their own scratchboards, most artists work on commercially available materials. Some of the tools professional scratchboard artists use for scratching through the ink include xacto blades, scalpel blades, tattoo needles, tips made by speedball (scratchboard tips #112 and 113), tips made by scratch-art brand, small fiberglass brushes, wire brushes, sandpaper, steel wool, parallel-line tool, ink erasers, and more. Various techniques such as hatching or stippling can be used to detail the image. The 14\\" X 18\\" scratchboard Sunflower And Silver by Diana Lee is an example of black scratchboard colored with transparent ink. An extreme close up lets the detail of the scratching be more easily seen.  Artists  Notable contemporary illustrators who have worked in the scratchboard medium include Gary Bullock (UK Illustrator), Michael McCurdy, Peter Blake,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/dec/21/the-12-cartoons- of-christmas-by-quentin-blake-judith-kerr-posy-simmonds-and-more#img-5 Virgil Finlay, John Schoenherr, Sally Maxwell, Gary Houston, Jos Sances, Russ Mullins, Bill Russell, David Klein, Mark Summers, Peter Kuper and Scott McKowen. In 2011, the International Society of Scratchboard Artists (ISSA) was launched to help promote scratchboard art as a fine art medium, as well as to help educate the public about the medium. The organization holds at least one annual exhibition dedicated exclusively to scratchboard art in a gallery or museum each year.http://www.scratchboardsociety.com/ ReferencesFurther reading * Merritt Dana Cutler, Scratchboard Drawing, 1949, Watson-Guptill Publications. * Ruth Lozner, Scratchboard for Illustration, 1990, Watson- Guptill Publications, * Merritt Cutler, \\"How to Cut Drawings on Scratchboard\\", 1960, Watson-Guptill Publications, Drawing Crafts Artistic techniques ","title":"Scratchboard"},{"id":"1358959","text":"Sobol sequences (also called LPœÑ sequences or (t, s) sequences in base 2) are an example of quasi-random low-discrepancy sequences. They were first introduced by the Russian mathematician Ilya M. Sobol (–ò–ª—å—è –ú–µ–µ—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –°–æ–±–æ–ª—å) in 1967.Sobol,I.M. (1967), \\"Distribution of points in a cube and approximate evaluation of integrals\\". Zh. Vych. Mat. Mat. Fiz. 7: 784‚Äì802 (in Russian); U.S.S.R Comput. Maths. Math. Phys. 7: 86‚Äì112 (in English). These sequences use a base of two to form successively finer uniform partitions of the unit interval and then reorder the coordinates in each dimension.  Good distributions in the s-dimensional unit hypercube  Let Is = [0,1]s be the s-dimensional unit hypercube, and f a real integrable function over Is. The original motivation of Sobol was to construct a sequence xn in Is so that : \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) = \\\\int_{I^s} f and the convergence be as fast as possible. It is more or less clear that for the sum to converge towards the integral, the points xn should fill Is minimizing the holes. Another good property would be that the projections of xn on a lower- dimensional face of Is leave very few holes as well. Hence the homogeneous filling of Is does not qualify because in lower dimensions many points will be at the same place, therefore useless for the integral estimation. These good distributions are called (t,m,s)-nets and (t,s)-sequences in base b. To introduce them, define first an elementary s-interval in base b a subset of Is of the form : \\\\prod_{j=1}^s \\\\left[ \\\\frac{a_j}{b^{d_j}}, \\\\frac{a_j+1}{b^{d_j}} \\\\right), where aj and dj are non-negative integers, and a_j < b^{d_j} for all j in {1, ...,s}. Given 2 integers 0\\\\leq t\\\\leq m, a (t,m,s)-net in base b is a sequence xn of bm points of Is such that \\\\operatorname{Card} P \\\\cap \\\\\\\\{x_1, ..., x_{b^m}\\\\\\\\} = b^t for all elementary interval P in base b of hypervolume Œª(P) = bt‚àím. Given a non-negative integer t, a (t,s)-sequence in base b is an infinite sequence of points xn such that for all integers k \\\\geq 0, m \\\\geq t, the sequence \\\\\\\\{x_{kb^m}, ..., x_{(k+1)b^m-1}\\\\\\\\} is a (t,m,s)-net in base b. In his article, Sobol described Œ†œÑ-meshes and LPœÑ sequences, which are (t,m,s)-nets and (t,s)-sequences in base 2 respectively. The terms (t,m,s)-nets and (t,s)-sequences in base b (also called Niederreiter sequences) were coined in 1988 by Harald Niederreiter.Niederreiter, H. (1988). \\"Low-Discrepancy and Low-Dispersion Sequences\\", Journal of Number Theory 30: 51‚Äì70. The term Sobol sequences was introduced in late English-speaking papers in comparison with Halton, Faure and other low-discrepancy sequences.  A fast algorithm  A more efficient Gray code implementation was proposed by Antonov and Saleev.Antonov, I.A. and Saleev, V.M. (1979) \\"An economic method of computing LPœÑ-sequences\\". Zh. Vych. Mat. Mat. Fiz. 19: 243‚Äì245 (in Russian); U.S.S.R. Comput. Maths. Math. Phys. 19: 252‚Äì256 (in English). As for the generation of Sobol numbers, they are clearly aided by the use of Gray code G(n)=n \\\\oplus \\\\lfloor n/2 \\\\rfloor instead of n for constructing the n-th point draw. Suppose we have already generated all the Sobol sequence draws up to n ‚àí 1 and kept in memory the values xn‚àí1,j for all the required dimensions. Since the Gray code G(n) differs from that of the preceding one G(n ‚àí 1) by just a single, say the k-th, bit (which is a rightmost bit of n ‚àí 1), all that needs to be done is a single XOR operation for each dimension in order to propagate all of the xn‚àí1 to xn, i.e. : x_{n,i} = x_{n-1,i} \\\\oplus v_{k,i}.  Additional uniformity properties  Sobol introduced additional uniformity conditions known as property A and A‚Äô.Sobol, I. M. (1976) \\"Uniformly distributed sequences with an additional uniform property\\". Zh. Vych. Mat. Mat. Fiz. 16: 1332‚Äì1337 (in Russian); U.S.S.R. Comput. Maths. Math. Phys. 16: 236‚Äì242 (in English). ;Definition: A low-discrepancy sequence is said to satisfy Property A if for any binary segment (not an arbitrary subset) of the d-dimensional sequence of length 2d there is exactly one draw in each 2d hypercubes that result from subdividing the unit hypercube along each of its length extensions into half. ;Definition: A low-discrepancy sequence is said to satisfy Property A‚Äô if for any binary segment (not an arbitrary subset) of the d-dimensional sequence of length 4d there is exactly one draw in each 4d hypercubes that result from subdividing the unit hypercube along each of its length extensions into four equal parts. There are mathematical conditions that guarantee properties A and A'. ;Theorem: The d-dimensional Sobol sequence possesses Property A iff :: \\\\det(\\\\mathbf{V}_d) \\\\equiv 1 (\\\\mod 2), :where Vd is the d √ó d binary matrix defined by :: \\\\mathbf{V}_d := \\\\begin{pmatrix} {v_{1,1,1}}&{v_{2,1,1}}&{\\\\dots}&{v_{d,1,1}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ {v_{1,2,1}}&{v_{2,2,1}}&{\\\\dots}&{v_{d,2,1}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\vdots}&{\\\\vdots}&{\\\\ddots}&{\\\\vdots}\\\\\\\\\\\\ {v_{1,d,1}}&{v_{2,d,1}}&{\\\\dots}&{v_{d,d,1}} \\\\end{pmatrix}, :with vk,j,m denoting the m-th digit after the binary point of the direction number vk,j = (0.vk,j,1vk,j,2...)2. ;Theorem: The d-dimensional Sobol sequence possesses Property A' iff :: \\\\det(\\\\mathbf{U}_d) \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod 2, :where Ud is the 2d √ó 2d binary matrix defined by :: \\\\mathbf{U}_d := \\\\begin{pmatrix} {v_{1,1,1}}&{v_{1,1,2}}&{v_{2,1,1}}&{v_{2,1,2}}&{\\\\dots}&{v_{d,1,1}}&{v_{d,1,2}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ {v_{1,2,1}}&{v_{1,2,2}}&{v_{2,2,1}}&{v_{2,2,2}}&{\\\\dots}&{v_{d,2,1}}&{v_{d,2,2}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\vdots}&{\\\\vdots}&{\\\\vdots}&{\\\\vdots}&{\\\\ddots}&{\\\\vdots}&{\\\\vdots}\\\\\\\\\\\\ {v_{1,2d,1}}&{v_{1,2d,2}}&{v_{2,2d,1}}&{v_{2,2d,2}}&{\\\\dots}&{v_{d,2d,1}}&{v_{d,2d,2}} \\\\end{pmatrix}, :with vk,j,m denoting the m-th digit after the binary point of the direction number vk,j = (0.vk,j,1vk,j,2...)2. Tests for properties A and A‚Äô are independent. Thus it is possible to construct the Sobol sequence that satisfies both properties A and A‚Äô or only one of them.  The initialisation of Sobol numbers  To construct a Sobol sequence, a set of direction numbers vi,j needs to be selected. There is some freedom in the selection of initial direction numbers.These numbers are usually called initialisation numbers. Therefore, it is possible to receive different realisations of the Sobol sequence for selected dimensions. A bad selection of initial numbers can considerably reduce the efficiency of Sobol sequences when used for computation. Arguably the easiest choice for the initialisation numbers is just to have the l-th leftmost bit set, and all other bits to be zero, i.e. mk,j = 1 for all k and j. This initialisation is usually called unit initialisation. However, such a sequence fails the test for Property A and A‚Äô even for low dimensions and hence this initialisation is bad.  Implementation and availability  Good initialisation numbers for different numbers of dimensions are provided by several authors. For example, Sobol provides initialisation numbers for dimensions up to 51.Sobol, I.M. and Levitan, Y.L. (1976). \\"The production of points uniformly distributed in a multidimensional cube\\" Tech.

He was one of the world's leading players in the 1970s and early 1980s. Chess career At eighteen, he was joint winner of the West German Chess Championship. His International Master (IM) title was awarded in 1969 and his Grandmaster (GM) title in 1971. He reached third place in the FIDE world ranking list in 1980. Between 1971 and 1991 (loss to Jan Timman), H√ºbner played in four Candidates Tournaments for the World Championship. Three ended in controversial circumstances: * In 1971, he forfeited a closely contested quarter final to Tigran Petrosian, after blundering a piece in the 7th game in a drawn position. * In 1980‚Äì81, his best result, after winning the quarter and semi final (against the Hungarian players Adorjan and Portisch), he reached the final before losing to Viktor Korchnoi. H√ºbner forfeited the match after 10 games when he was down 1 point. * In 1983, he lost a quarter final to Vassily Smyslov in unique circumstances: with the match tied after the original 10 games plus 4 further games, the tie was resolved (in Smyslov's favour) by a spin of a roulette wheel.CHESS; SHOULD CHANCE DECIDE THE OUTCOME OF A MATCH?, Robert Byrne, New York Times, May 9, 1983 At his strongest in the mid-seventies to mid-eighties, H√ºbner participated in many of the elite tournaments of the day, and was invited at Montreal 1979 (The Tournament of Stars), playing alongside Anatoly Karpov, Mikhail Tal, and Jan Timman. His most notable tournament victories were at Houston 1974, Munich 1979 (shared with Ulf Andersson and Boris Spassky), Rio de Janeiro Interzonal 1979 (shared with Lajos Portisch and Tigran Petrosian), Chicago 1982, Biel 1984 (equal with Vlastimil Hort), Linares 1985 (shared with Ljubomir Ljubojeviƒá), and Tilburg 1985 (shared with Anthony Miles and Viktor Korchnoi). He served as a second to Nigel Short in the 1993 world championship match against Garry Kasparov. In 2000 he won, with the German team, a silver medal in the 34th Chess Olympiad in Istanbul. He remained active on the international circuit into the 2000s but has never been a full-time chess professional due to his academic career. Playing style H√ºbner at Porz in 1966 Over the chessboard, H√ºbner's technique has been described as efficient and ruthless. According to Bill Hartston‚Äî\\"His perfectionist and rather pessimistic approach, however, prevented him from reaching the very top.\\" Other contributions H√ºbner's contributions to chess literature include the study of world champions and extensive analysis of 19th-century chess brilliancies.

The committee was established on December 13, 1865, after both houses reached agreement on an amended version of a House concurrent resolution introduced by Representative Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania to establish a joint committee of 15 members. Stevens and Senator William P. Fessenden of Maine served as co-chairmen.Cook, Robert. Civil War Senator: William Pitt Fessenden and the Fight to Save the American Republic, p. 196 (LSU Press, 2011). The joint committee divided into four subcommittees to hear testimony and gather evidence, the first subcommittee handled Tennessee; the second handled Virginia and the Carolinas; the third handled Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas; and, the fourth subcommittee handled Florida, Louisiana, and Texas. In all, 144 witnesses were called to testify.McKitrick, Eric. Andrew Johnson and Reconstruction, p. 331 (Oxford University Press, 1988). The joint committee included nine members from the House, and six from the Senate. The House members were Congressman Stevens (R-PA), Elihu Washburne (R-IL), Justin Morrill (R-VT), John A. Bingham (R-OH), Roscoe Conkling (R-NY), George Boutwell (R-MA), Henry Blow (R-MO), Henry Grider (D-KY), and Andrew Jackson Rogers (D-NJ). The Senate members were Chairman Fessenden (R-ME), James W. Grimes (R-IA), Jacob Howard (R-MI), George Henry Williams (R-OR), Ira Harris (R-NY), and Reverdy Johnson (D-MD). Journal and report The decisions of the committee were recorded in its journal, but the journal did not reveal the committee's debates or discussions which were deliberately kept secret. However, once the committee had completed work on the proposed Fourteenth Amendment, several of its members spoke out, including Senator Howard who gave a long speech to the full Senate in which he presented \\"in a very succinct way, the views and the motives which influenced that committee, so far as I understand those views and motives.\\"Congressional Globe, 39th Congress, 1st Session, Senate, pp. 2764‚Äê68 (May 23, 1866), via the Constitutional Accountability Center. The joint committee also produced a report after Congress had already given final approval to send the draft Fourteenth Amendment to the states for ratification, and the report was widely disseminated. The report was signed by twelve of the committee's fifteen members, and a minority report was signed by the other three members: Johnson, Rogers, and Grider. The Joint Committee on Reconstruction was not revived at the next Congress. Bibliography * Belz, Herman.

Soviet army groups were known as Fronts. The 2nd Belorussian Front was created in February 1944 as the Soviets pushed the Germans back towards Byelorussia. General Colonel Pavel Kurochkin became its first commander. In hiatus in April 1944, its headquarters was reformed from the army headquarters of the disbanding 10th Army.Bonn, Slaughterhouse, Aberjona Press, 2005, p.313  Operations  On 2 January 1944 2BF entered the former Polish territories. On 26 June 1944 the Front's forces captured Mogilev in the Mogilev Offensive. On 4 July, 2BF was tasked with mopping up the remains of Army Group Centre's Fourth Army under the command of General von Tippelskirch and the remains of the Ninth Army in a large pocket southeast of Minsk. On 9 July The 2BF attacks northwest from Vitebsk as part of a major Soviet offensive east of Riga towards Rezekne in order to cut off the German Army Group North. On 29 July Soviets reach the coast cutting Army Group North off in Estonia and Eastern Latvia. On 13 September 2BF captured ≈Åom≈ºa, west of Bia≈Çystok. In November 1944 Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky was appointed commander of 2BF just in time for its last two great offensives of World War II.

On 9 April 1945 K√∂nigsberg in East Prussia finally fell to the Red Army. This freed up 2BF to move west to the east bank of the Oder river. During the first two weeks of April the Soviets performed their fastest Front redeployment of the war. General Georgy Zhukov concentrated his 1st Belorussian Front (1BF) which had been deployed along the Oder river from Frankfurt in the south to the Baltic, into an area in front of the Seelow Heights. The 2BF moved into the positions being vacated by the 1BF north of the Seelow Heights. While this redeployment was in progress gaps were left in the lines and the remnants of the German II Army which had been bottled up in a pocket near Danzig managed to escape across the Oder. In the early hours on 16 April the final offensive of the war to capture Berlin and link up with Western Allied forces on the Elbe started with attacks by 1BF and To the south General Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front (1UF). On 20 April the 2BF join in the attack. By 25 April 2BF broke out of its bridge head south of Stettin and had by the end of the war captured all of Germany north of Berlin as far west as the front lines of the British 21 Army Group which had advanced over the river Elbe in some places.

Creation and initial operations  Initially, the Belorussian Front was created on 20 October 1943 as the new designation of the existing Central Front. It was placed under the command of General Konstantin K. Rokossovsky, who had been commanding the Central Front. It launched the Gomel-Rechitsa Offensive in 1943 and then the Kalinkovichi-Mozyr Offensive in 1944.  Redesignation and 1944 operations  It was then renamed the 1st Belorussian Front (1BF) on 17 February 1944 following the Dnieper‚ÄìCarpathian Offensive. A few days later, on 21 February, the Rogachev-Zhlobin Offensive commenced, which continued until 26 February.Keith E. Bonn, Slaughterhouse: The Handbook of the Eastern Front, Aberjona Press, Bedford, PA, 2005, p.42 The next operation was the Bobruysk Offensive, part of Operation Bagration, and on 26 June the attacks of 1BF encircled Bobruisk, trapping 40,000 troops of the German 41st Panzer Corps (part of 9th Army). From 18 July-2 August the Front was part of the Lublin- Brest Offensive. From 2 August to 30 September, the Front was engaged cleaning out Germans to the east of the Vistula (during which the Battle of Radzymin took place from 1‚Äì10 August). Its 8th Guards, 28th, 47th, 65th, 69th, and 70th Armies were involved at Radzymin. Later during that same period, on 14 September, 1BF with the support of Polish forces it captured Praga, a suburb of Warsaw.  Operations in 1945 The next attack was the Warsaw-Pozna≈Ñ Operation, a part of the Vistula-Oder Offensive. On 13 January, 1BF began an offensive toward Pillkallen (Schlossberg between 1938‚Äì1945) in East Prussia, against which they met stiff resistance from the 3rd Panzer Army. The 1st Belorussian Front opened its attack on the German Ninth Army from the Magnuszew and Pu≈Çawy bridgeheads at 08:30 on 14 January, again commencing with a heavy bombardment.Duffy, p.72 The 33rd and 69th Armies broke out of the Pu≈Çawy bridgehead to a depth of 30 km, while the 5th Shock and 8th Guards Armies broke out of the Magnuszew bridgehead. The 2nd and 1st Guards Tank Armies were committed after them to exploit the breach. On 25 January, the Front cut off the fortress city of Pozna≈Ñ which held 66,000 Germans, and continued its 80 km a day advance, leaving the 8th Guards Army to lay siege to the city, which they finally took on 23 February.Christopher Duffy, Red Storm on the Reich, New York: Athenum Press, 1991, p.250 Capture of Berlin Along with the 1st Ukrainian Front, 1BF then stormed Berlin in the climatic Battle of Berlin. Marshal Georgy Zhukov was appointed commander of the 1BF, in November 1944, for its last two great offensives of World War II. After the capture of Poland and East Prussia (its capture was finished on 25 April with capture of Pillau) from January‚ÄìMarch 1945, the Soviets redeployed their forces during the first two weeks of April. Marshal Georgy Zhukov concentrated 1BF, which had been deployed along the Oder river from Frankfurt in the south to the Baltic, into an area in front of the Seelow Heights. The 2nd Belorussian Front moved into the positions being vacated by the 1BF north of the Seelow Heights. While this redeployment was in progress gaps were left in the lines and the remnants of the German II Army which had been bottled up in a pocket near Danzig managed to escape across the Oder. In the early hours of 16 April the Berlin Offensive Operation started with the objectives of capturing Berlin and linking up with Western Allied forces on the Elbe. The operation started with an assault on the Seelow Heights by 1BF and by Marshal Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front (1UF) to the south. Initially the 1BF had great difficulty smashing through the German lines of defence, but after three days they had broken through and were approaching the outskirts of Berlin. By 22 April 1BF had penetrated the northern and eastern suburbs of Berlin. They finished the encirclement of Berlin on 25 April when units of the 1BF and 1UF met at Kietzen west of Berlin. After heavy street by street and house to house fighting, General Weidling, the commander of Berlin's garrison, met with Marshal Chuikov and surrendered Berlin unconditionally at 15:00 hours local time on 2 May.  Post-war On 8 May, after a signing ceremony in Berlin, the German armed forces surrendered to the Allies unconditionally and the war in Europe was over. Following the war, the Front headquarters formed the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany.  Commanders  The Front's Commissars included *Lt. General Konstantin F.

He had migrated to the Province of New York as a young man and worked with his uncle, Sir William Johnson, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs of the northern colonies. This painting by Benjamin West is usually identified as a portrait of Guy Johnson, although some historians argue that it depicts Sir William Johnson, Guy's uncle.Thomas S. Abler, \\"Guy Johnson, Benjamin West, and Cohoes Falls: Issues of (Mis)Identification\\" , New York History, Spring 2008, accessed May 4, 2010. He was appointed as his successor in 1774. The following year, Johnson relocated with Loyalist supporters to Canada as tensions rose in New York before the American Revolutionary War. He directed joint militia and Mohawk military actions in the Mohawk Valley. Accused of falsifying reports, he went to London to defend himself after the war, and died there in 1788. Early life and education Guy was the son of either John or Warren Johnson of Smithstown, Dunshaughlin, Co. Meath, each younger brothers of Sir William Johnson. The Johnsons were descendants of the O'Neill dynasty of Ireland. In 1756, he sailed from Ireland and joined his uncle William in the Mohawk Valley of the Province of New York. He assisted his uncle, who was British Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the northern colonies. He was agent to the Iroquois, with whom the British had a strong trading diplomatic relationship. Marriage and family On 1763, Guy Johnson married William's daughter Mary (Polly), one of his children by his first consort, Catherine Weisenberg. His uncle (now also father-in-law) gave them a square mile of land on the Mohawk River, located in what is now Amsterdam. In 1773, their first home was destroyed by a lightning strike. They replaced it in 1774 with a large limestone house in the Georgian style, which they called Guy Park. Soon after, they were forced to leave because of rising tensions in the area prior to the American Revolution. With other Loyalists, they went to Canada to settle near Fort Niagara. On the way, Polly Johnson died at Oswego. Career Guy Johnson became a deputy to Sir William in his uncle's position as British Superintendent of Indian Affairs. He learned much about the Mohawk and Iroquois. When William died in 1774 on the eve of the war, Guy succeeded him as superintendent. Guy Johnson also served as a county judge, a colonel in the Tryon County militia, and an elected member of the Province of New York Assembly. American War of Independence When the New York Committee of Safety committed the colony to armed resistance following the Battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775, Johnson remained loyal to the Crown and worked to control the Tryon County courts, assisted by fellow loyalists Sir John Johnson (Sir William's son) and Colonel Daniel Claus (also a son-in-law of Sir William). These three also commanded three regiments of the Tryon County militia. But, American Patriots in the Mohawk Valley soon drove the three Loyalists out of power. Johnson received a letter from British commander General Gage, ordering him to take as many Iroquois warriors as he could recruit to Canada to join forces with General Carleton for a joint attack on New England. In May 1775, Johnson fled with about 120 other Loyalists, along with 90 Mohawk under chief John Deseronto, to British-controlled Canada. Along the way, he worked to secure the allegiance of the Iroquois League at a council at Oswego, New York in July. Johnson's wife Polly had died at Oswego. He and the remainder of his party reached Montreal on 17 July. In September 1775, John Campbell was appointed in Montreal as the Superintendent of the Canadian Indians. General Guy Carleton, Governor-in-Chief of Quebec, told Johnson that he had no authority over any Indians in Canada and that the Iroquois were not to fight outside the Province of Quebec. Johnson decided to travel to England in November 1775, accompanied by the Mohawk leader Joseph Brant, to appeal his case directly with the British lords. The Lords appointed Johnson as the permanent Superintendent for Indian Affairs in the northern colonies, but with no authority in Canada. Johnson and Brant returned to North America, landing in New York City in July 1776 after the city had been retaken by the British. He was ordered to stay in New York since he had no position in Canada. Johnson finally persuaded his superiors to let him do his \\"duty,\\" and he returned to Canada in 1779. He led forces against the colonials in the Mohawk Valley frontier, and his subordinates carried out the actions in what the Americans called massacres at Wyoming and Cherry valleys. This was also known as the \\"Burning of the Valleys\\". Back at Fort Niagara in 1779, Johnson helped to provide for the many Iroquois refugees made homeless by the Sullivan Expedition that year, which laid waste to their villages and food stores in western New York. He also organized counter-raids. In 1781, General MacLean reported that Johnson's wartime accounts were \\"Extravagant, wonderful & fictitious, and the quality of articles so extraordinary, new & uncommon\\". Johnson was suspended as superintendent and summoned to Montreal, where the Governor-in-Chief Frederick Haldimand criticized his conduct as \\"reprehensible\\". Although never convicted, Johnson was in disgrace and in limbo. He went to London to defend his reports to the government and remained there. He died in 1788. Sir John Johnson took over Fort Niagara as superintendent of Indian affairs in his cousin's absence; he was officially appointed to the position in March 1782. Legacy Guy Park house, Amsterdam, NY, c.1912 postcard The state of New York confiscated the property of Loyalists and sold the house after the war. While in private hands, the house was used as a stagecoach stop during the extensive nineteenth-century westward migration through New York State. Since the early twentieth century, the house has been preserved as a state historic site. Recently used as the Walter Elwood Museum for local history, it was severely damaged in late August 2011 by the flooding caused by Hurricane Irene. References ;Notes ;Books * Kelsay, Isabel.

The civil parish is still called Ercall Magna, and had a total population of 1,679 at the 2001 census,Ercall Magna CP, ONS reducing to 1,639 at the 2011 census. The parish includes the villages of Rowton, Ellerdine and Cold Hatton, and a number of hamlets including Cotwall, Osbaston, Poynton and Roden. Its name is locally pronounced \\"Arkel\\". The village lies on the junction of the B5062 and B5063 roads. History, architecture The etymology of the name Ercall (also seen in Child's Ercall) is obscure, though it may be derived from a Welsh word ercal, perhaps once applied to the whole area.Raven, M. A Guide to Shropshire, 2005, p.89 High Ercall was recorded in Domesday as \\"Archelou\\": it was stated to have been held by Earl Eduin in the time of Edward the Confessor, when it was worth ¬£20.Anderson, J. C. Shropshire: its early history and antiquities, p.117 At the time of the survey it contained two mills and a fishery yielding \\"1502 great eels\\" annually. It is thought a church may have stood in High Ercall since Saxon times, but the present St Michael's Church shows mostly medieval work with a tower dating from the 14th century. The base of the tower is badly weather-beaten. The parishioners, however, have a more romanticised explanation, that the damage is due to people sharpening their weapons on it in ancient times. In the churchyard, as well as graves covering several centuries, there is a sundial from the 18th-century which records the time in Jerusalem, Rome and Plymouth in Massachusetts. High Ercall Hall (old 16th century building) with arches from demolished 1608 building. The village is clustered around what remains of High Ercall Hall, originally a fortified 13th-century manor owned by the Arkle family; in the seventeenth century the house was owned by the Newport family, having been rebuilt in 1608 for Sir Francis Newport, the father of Richard Newport, 1st Baron Newport. The Newports were prominent royalists and during the English Civil War Richard garrisoned the Hall for the King.Manganiello, S. The concise encyclopedia of the revolutions and wars of England, Scotland, and Ireland, 1639-1660 Between 1644 and 1646 the house withstood repeated attacks by local Parliamentarian forces, culminating in a prolonged siege, using artillery, from July 1645. The Royalist commander at High Ercall, Sir Vincent Corbet, eventually surrendered on 28 March 1646. The history and archaeology of this event was covered by the Time Team episode Siege House in Shropshire (series 9, episode 8).Channel 4 Time Team episode guide The village also contains some almshouses of 1694, built in brick with small dormer windows. A short distance from the village is a World War II airfield which as RAF High Ercall was the home of 29 MU, a Royal Air Force maintenance unit. 68 Squadron operated from High Ercall from April 1941 for eleven months before moving to Catterick. The MU opened in 1941 and closed in 1957. The airfield site later became the headquarters for the Road Transport Industry Training Board (RTITB) Multi Occupational Training and Educational Centre (MOTEC 1), home of the RTITB National Junior Mechanic Competition 1987. An outdoor war memorial to 59 servicemen from the parish of Ercall Magna who have died in wars since 1914, in African iron Greystone granite, was unveiled in the village in April 2017.

The word revenant is derived from the Old French word, revenant, the \\"returning\\" (see also the related French verb revenir, meaning \\"to come back\\"). Revenants are part of the legend of various cultures, including Old Irish Celtic and Norse mythology, and stories of supposed revenant visitations were documented by English historians in the Middle Ages. Comparison to other folkloristic and mythological undead The term \\"revenant\\" has been used interchangeably with \\"vampire\\" or \\"ghost\\" by folklorists. While some maintain that vampires derive from Eastern European folklore and revenants derive from Western European folklore, many assert that revenant is a generic term for the undead. Augustin Calmet conducted extensive research on the topic in his work titled Trait√© sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenans de Hongrie, de Moravie, &c.; (1751) in which he relates the rumors of men at the time: Calmet compares the ideas of the Greek and Egyptian ancients and notes an old belief that magic could not only cause death but also evoke the souls of the deceased as well. Calmet ascribed revenants to sorcerers who sucked the blood of victims and compares instances of revenants mentioned in the twelfth century in England and Denmark as similar to those of Hungary, but \\"in no history do we read anything so usual or so pronounced, as what is related to us of the vampires of Poland, Hungary, and Moravia.\\" A possible precursor of the revenant legend appears in Norse mythology, called the draugr or aptrgangr (literally \\"again- walker\\", meaning one who walks after death). Stories involving the draugr often involve confrontations with the creature. The draugr resists intruders to its burial mound and is often immune to conventional weapons, which renders the destruction of its body a dangerous affair to be undertaken by individual heroes. In the folklore and ghost stories of Eastern Scandinavia, Finnish \\"dead-child beings\\" are described as revenants animated by restless spirits that could be laid to rest by performing baptism or other religious rites. References to revenant-like beings in Caribbean lore are often referred to as \\"The soucouyant\\" or \\"soucriant\\" in Dominica, Trinidadian and Guadeloupean folklore, also known as Ole-Higue or Loup-garou elsewhere in the Caribbean. Selected stories=William of Newburgh Belief in souls returning from the dead was common in the 12th century, and Historia by William of Newburgh (1136‚Äì1198) briefly recounts stories he heard about revenants, as do works by his contemporary, Walter Map. William wrote that stories of supposed revenants were a \\"warning to posterity\\" and so common that, \\"were I to write down all the instances of this kind which I have ascertained to have befallen in our times, the undertaking would be beyond measure laborious and troublesome.\\" According to William, \\"It would not be easy to believe that the corpses of the dead should sally (I know not by what agency) from their graves, and should wander about to the terror or destruction of the living, and again return to the tomb, which of its own accord spontaneously opened to receive them, did not frequent examples, occurring in our own times, suffice to establish this fact, to the truth of which there is abundant testimony.\\"Historia rerum Anglicarum, Book 5, Ch. 24. One story involves a man of \\"evil conduct\\" absconding from justice, who fled from York and made the ill-fated choice to get married. Becoming jealous of his wife, he hid in the rafters of his bedroom and caught her in an act of infidelity with a local young man, but then accidentally fell to the floor mortally wounding himself, and died a few days later. As Newburgh describes: > A Christian burial, indeed, he received, though unworthy of it; but it did > not much benefit him: for issuing, by the handiwork of Satan, from his grave > at night-time, and pursued by a pack of dogs with horrible barkings, he > wandered through the courts and around the houses while all men made fast > their doors, and did not dare to go abroad on any errand whatever from the > beginning of the night until the sunrise, for fear of meeting and being > beaten black and blue by this vagrant monster. A number of the townspeople were killed by the monster and so: > Thereupon snatching up a spade of but indifferent sharpness of edge, and > hastening to the cemetery, they began to dig; and whilst they were thinking > that they would have to dig to a greater depth, they suddenly, before much > of the earth had been removed, laid bare the corpse, swollen to an enormous > corpulence, with its countenance beyond measure turgid and suffused with > blood; while the napkin in which it had been wrapped appeared nearly torn to > pieces. The young men, however, spurred on by wrath, feared not, and > inflicted a wound upon the senseless carcass, out of which incontinently > flowed such a stream of blood, that it might have been taken for a leech > filled with the blood of many persons. Then, dragging it beyond the village, > they speedily constructed a funeral pile; and upon one of them saying that > the pestilential body would not burn unless its heart were torn out, the > other laid open its side by repeated blows of the blunted spade, and, > thrusting in his hand, dragged out the accursed heart. This being torn > piecemeal, and the body now consigned to the flames... In another story Newburgh tells of a woman whose husband recently died. The husband revives from the dead and comes to visit her at night in her bedchamber and he \\"...not only terrified her on awaking, but nearly crushed her by the insupportable weight of his body.\\" This happens for three nights, and the revenant then repeats these nocturnal visits with other nearby family and neighbours and \\"...thus become a like serious nuisance,\\" eventually extending his walks in the broad daylight around the village. Eventually the problem was solved by the bishop of Lincoln who wrote a letter of absolution, upon which the man's tomb was opened wherein it was seen his body was still there, the letter was placed on his chest, and the tomb sealed.Historia rerum Anglicarum, Book 5, Ch. 22. Abbot of Burton The English Abbot of Burton tells the story of two runaway peasants from about 1090 who died suddenly of unknown causes and were buried, but: > the very same day in which they were interred they appeared at evening, > while the sun was still up, carrying on their shoulders the wooden coffins > in which they had been buried. The whole following night they walked through > the paths and fields of the village, now in the shape of men carrying wooden > coffins on their shoulders, now in the likeness of bears or dogs or other > animals. They spoke to the other peasants, banging on the walls of their > houses and shouting \\"Move quickly, move! Get going! Come!\\" The villagers became sick and started dying, but eventually the bodies of the revenants were exhumed, their heads cut off, and their hearts removed, which ended the spread of the sickness.England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings, pg. 613. Walter Map The chronicler Walter Map, a Welshman writing during the 12th century, tells of a \\"wicked man\\" in Hereford who revived from the dead and wandered the streets of his village at night calling out the names of those who would die of sickness within three days. The response by bishop Gilbert Foliot was \\"Dig up the body and cut off the head with a spade, sprinkle it with holy water and re-inter it\\".De nugis curialium, Book 2, Ch. 27.

Along with sacramental wine, it is one of two \\"elements\\" of the Eucharist. The bread may be either leavened or unleavened (appearing as a wafer), depending on tradition. Roman Catholic theology generally teaches that at the Words of Institution the bread is changed into the Body of Christ (see transubstantiation), whereas Eastern Christian theology generally views the epiclesis as the point at which the change occurs. Some Protestants believe transignification occurs at the Words of Institution. Etymology of host The word \\"host\\" is derived from the Latin hostia, which means \\"sacrificial victim\\". The term can be used to describe the bread both before and after consecration, although it is more correct to use it after consecration (prior to consecration, the term \\"altar bread\\" is preferred). The sacrifice of Jesus, according to Christian theology, puts an end to the need for animal sacrifice as had been practiced in the Jerusalem Temple and all blood sacrifice once and for all. However the word was retained to describe the bread of Eucharist as a liturgical representation of the Christ's sacrifice. Eastern traditions The Lamb and particles placed on the diskos during the Liturgy of Preparation for the Divine Liturgy With the exception of Churches of the Armenian Rite and the Maronite Church, Orthodox Churches and Eastern Catholic Churches use leavened bread for the Eucharist. Thus, the sacramental bread symbolizes the Resurrected Christ. The hostia or sacramental bread, known as prosphor√° or a œÄœÅœåœÉœÜŒøœÅŒøŒΩ (pr√≥sphoron, \\"offering\\") may be made out of only four ingredients: fine (white) wheat flour, pure water, yeast, and salt. Sometimes holy water will be either sprinkled into the dough or on the kneading trough at the beginning of the process. Armenian rite Because leaven is symbolic of sin, the Armenian Catholic Church and the Armenian Apostolic Orthodox Church traditionally offer unleavened bread (although it is distinctively different from the kind used by the Roman Catholic Church) to symbolize the sinlessness of Christ. Eastern Orthodox Churches The baking may only be performed by a believing Orthodox Christian in good standing‚Äîhaving preferably been recently to Confession, and is accompanied by prayer and fasting. Before baking, each loaf is formed by placing two disks of dough, one on top of the other, and stamping it with a special liturgical seal. The prosphora should be fresh and not stale or moldy when presented at the altar for use in the Divine Liturgy. Often several prosphora will be baked and offered by the faithful, and the priest chooses the best one for the Lamb (Host) that will be consecrated. The remaining loaves are blessed and offered back to the congregation after the end of the Divine Liturgy (Eucharist); this bread is called the antidoron (Greek: Œ±ŒΩœÑŒØŒ¥œâœÅŒøŒΩ, ant√≠d≈çron), i.e. a \\"gift returned\\", or \\"in place of the gifts\\". Eastern Catholic Churches The Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic Churches (like the Eastern Orthodox Church) use leavened bread for Prosphora (the Greek word for Eucharistic altar bread). The Syro-Malabar Church and the Maronite Church have adopted the use of unleavened bread due to Liturgical Latinisation. Western traditions=Roman Catholic Church Detail of tongs for baking hosts A host is a portion of bread used for Holy Communion in many Christian churches. In Western Christianity the host is often a thin, round, unleavened wafer. unleavened hosts for the Celebrant and wafers for the communicants. In the Roman Rite, unleavened bread is used as in the Jewish Passover or Feast of Unleavened Bread. The Code of Canon Law, Canon 924 requires that the hosts be made from wheat flour and water only, and recently made so that there is no danger of spoiling. Hosts are often made by nuns as a means of supporting their religious communities. However, in New Zealand, the St Vincent de Paul Society hires individuals with intellectual disabilities to bake, cut out, and sort the bread, thereby offering paid employment to those who would not otherwise have that option. The General Instruction of the Roman Missal ¬ß321 recommends that \\"the eucharistic bread ... be made in such a way that the priest at Mass with a congregation is able in practice to break it into parts for distribution to at least some of the faithful. ... The action of the fraction (breaking of bread), which gave its name to the Eucharist in apostolic times, will bring out more clearly the force and importance of the sign of unity of all in the one bread, and of the sign of charity by the fact that the one bread is distributed among the brothers and sisters.\\" In 1995 Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, then Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, wrote a letter to the Episcopal Conferences in which he expanded the Code of Canon Law, stating that low- gluten bread would be considered \\"valid matter\\" for hosts as long as no additional substances \\"alter[ed] the nature of the substance of the bread\\". Since the 2000s, hosts with low gluten content have been manufactured in the United States, especially in parts of Missouri and New York. Hosts are one of the causes of lack of recovery for people with celiac disease who follow a gluten-free diet, which must be strict and maintained for life to allow the recovery of the intestinal mucosa and reduce the risk of developing severe health complications. Protestantism United Methodist Elder presiding at the Eucharist, using a leavened loaf of bread In the varying Protestant denominations, there is a wide variety of practices concerning the sacramental bread used. Some, such as the Christian Congregation use leavened loaves of bread, others, such as Lutherans, continue to use unleavened wafers like the Roman Catholics, and some use matzo. Reformed Christians use rolls which are broken and distributed to symbolize their belief that Christ is not physically present in their bread. Among those who use the unleavened wafers, there is a great deal of variation: some are square or triangular rather than round, and may even be made out of whole wheat flour. Latter-day Saints The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) has no strict rules on the type of bread used for sacramental purposes. Latter-day Saint scriptures state: \\"For, behold, I say unto you, that it mattereth not what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink when ye partake of the sacrament, if it so be that ye do it with an eye single to my glory‚Äîremembering unto the Father my body which was laid down for you, and my blood which was shed for the remission of your sins.\\" (Doctrine and Covenants 27:2) Different congregations may use either commercial bread or homemade bread prepared by members of the congregation. It is permissible to substitute rice cakes or other gluten-free breads for members who suffer from food allergies. The bread is broken into fragments just prior to being blessed by one of the officiating priests.

After attending a local parish elementary school, he attended Elder High School, graduating in 1932.Beeman, Edward A. \\"Robert J. Huebner, M.D.:A Virologist‚Äôs Odyssey\\", National Institutes of Health, 2005. Accessed July 23, 2009. He attended Xavier College (later Xavier University, where he majored in economics and English literature and took the prerequisites to attend law school. He decided he wanted to become a physician and did his premed undergraduate training at the University of Cincinnati. He attended the Saint Louis University School of Medicine starting in 1938. He was threatened with expulsion from the school after officials there discovered that he had taken outside work to pay for his education in violation of school policy ‚Äî including a job as a bouncer at a brothel ‚Äî but stayed in school and graduated in 1942.Noble, Holcomb B. \\"Robert Huebner, 84, Dies; Found Virus-Cancer Connections\\", The New York Times, September 5, 1998. Accessed July 23, 2009. He graduated in June 1942, ranked in the top five of his class of 100. After graduating, he joined the United States Public Health Service during World War II, and was assigned for a year to the United States Marine Hospital in Seattle, and then to the United States Coast Guard ship USS Hemlock in Alaska. The Public Health Service transferred him to a position as a researcher at the National Institutes of Health in July 1944. Rickettsialpox In June and July 1945, Huebner was asked to investigate an outbreak of cases of a spotted fever that struck more than 100 New York City residents, most of whom were residents of a single apartment complex in Kew Gardens, Queens. Local physicians hadn't initially reported the cases to authorities, as most presented with a rash and fever, but recovered within two weeks without any specific treatment. The New York City Department of Health was informed after a \\"minor epidemic\\" broke out at the Queens housing complex and individuals had been sent to hospitals with violent fevers and skin lesions. The seven known rickettsial diseases were all ruled out based on tests. Visiting the complex with self-trained entomologist Charles Pomerantz, the two peeled back wallpaper to find the walls swarming with mites, so much so that tenants had described that \\"the walls had movement\\". Huebner's investigations on the site led to the conclusion that tenants had been bitten by a mite identified as Allodermanyssus sanguineus, found on mice that infested the storerooms and incinerator areas in the buildings. After culturing and isolating the organism in laboratory mice, the pathogen they named Rickettsia akari was identified as the ultimate cause of the disease now called rickettsialpox. The Department of Health announced a program to work with building owners to exterminate the mice that were the vector for the disease.Staff. \\"NEW FEVER TRACED TO MITE ON MICE; U.S. Health Service Roots Out Cause of Spotted Ailment That Struck in Queens NO CURE IS FOUND AS YET Victim Made Ill by Bite of Insect--Weinstein Urges War on Rodents Some Removed to Hospitals Blood of Patients Sampled\\", The New York Times, October 4, 1946.

He was recognized by the American Society of Tropical Medicine for his efforts with the Bailey K. Ashford Award in 1949, which included a $1,000 prize from Eli Lilly and Company that he later used as a down payment for a farm in Frederick, Maryland. Q Fever Huebner's first work on Q Fever was a report he had done on an outbreak of 18 cases that occurred in early 1946 in an NIH laboratory, where he showed a correlation between a spike in cases and the preparation of antigens in yolk sacs, and he prepared another report on a group of 47 patients being treated for the condition at the Public Health Service Hospital in Baltimore. He was sent in spring 1947 to investigate an outbreak at milk farms in the Los Angeles area, in which there was a dense population of farms in which the animals had little space, creating what Huebner called \\"unpasturized cows\\". Huebner found the cause to be a member of the rickettsia family that was found in containers of unpasteurized milk. The cause was found to be Coxiella burnetii, with their findings published in 1948 in the American Journal of Public Health. Dairy farmers were upset by the insinuation that they were responsible for the outbreak and put pressure on local health officials to ask Huebner to leave the area. Huebner found that the C. burnetii bacteria could survive temperatures of up to in sealed containers for as long as 30 minutes, just below the levels used for vat pasteurization. This could mean that there was no way to verify that every particle within a vat was raised to the peak temperature and that pasteurization might not eliminate all of the bacteria in the milk being treated.W.K. \\"NOTES ON SCIENCE; Aureomycin Is Effective Against Virus Pneumonia -- Acoustics\\", The New York Times, May 15, 1949. Accessed July 24, 2009. Adenovirus and oncogenes While trying to grow common cold viruses, he and his colleague Dr. Wallace Rowe first tried to use adenoid and tonsil tissue, before using a culture based on tumor cells. From that culture they isolated cytomegalovirus, as well as the first of a large family of adenoviruses. Dr. Robert M. Chanock said the discovery \\"put him up there with Sabin\\" (creator of the oral polio vaccine) as one of the \\"great moments in virology\\". Based on their observations, Huebner and Rowe hypothesized that these viruses could trigger an unknown gene that would cause cells to grow out of control. In a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 1969, Huebner advanced his theory that oncogenes, then only a hypothetical construct, could cause normal cells to mutate and become cancerous. A specific gene matching the theorized description was discovered and led to the development of treatments for cancer and other diseases. In contrast to medical wisdom in the 1960s and 1970s, Huebner was confident that viruses were a cause of cancer in humans and convinced the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare to provide $60 million in grants to fund research on the connection as part of the War on Cancer. This led to the discovery of the role that cytomegalovirus plays in opportunistic infections in patients with immunodeficiency. Research on retroviruses led to the development of a vaccine for hepatitis B, which has led to major decreases in rates of liver cancer, rates of some viral cancers, like that of the liver, have been sharply reduced. He took a position in 1968 as chief of the National Cancer Institute's Laboratory of Viral Carcinogenesis, staying there until his retirement in 1982. Awards and recognition President of the United States Richard Nixon presented Huebner with the National Medal of Science at a White House dinner held on February 16, 1970, recognizing his \\"contributions to the modern understanding of the biology of viruses and their role in the induction of diverse diseases.\\"\\"The President's National Medal of Science: Recipient Details - Robert J.

He also received the Rockefeller Public Service Award. Personal He bought a farm for $4,000 in Frederick, Maryland where he raised his family, using the money he had received as part of an award for his rickettsial research to make the necessary downpayment. His children were each given the task of raising an Angus cattle bull to help pay for their college education. By the time of Huebner's death in 1998, the farm was operated by three of his children. Huebner died at age 84 due to pneumonia on August 26, 1998, at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, where he had been a resident since 1991. He had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in the early 1980s. He was survived by his second wife, Harriet, as well as by six daughters, two sons and 11 grandchildren. His first marriage had ended in divorce.

The business was founded in 1872 by John Budgen,‚ÄòSupermarkets‚Äô, Competition Commission report presented to Parliament in October 2000, chapter 5, page 72 who opened the first shop in Maidenhead, Berkshireand was incorporated as a private limited company on 28 May 1962. The company is a subsidiary and retail fascia of Booker Group, part of Tesco plc. History The first Budgens shop was opened in 1872, by John Budgen. The first few shops were small local grocery stores, which expanded across the south of England. In October 1997, Budgens acquired the 55-shop network of 7-Eleven shops in the United Kingdom, re-branding them with the concept name 'B2'. By June 1998, it was clear that the name was not popular with customers and the 30 shops that were outside London began trading under the 'Budgens' fascia. The 'B2' branded shops in London were then changed to 'Budgens Express' before finally reverting to the 'Budgens' brand. In June 2002, the company was purchased by the Irish Musgrave Group. Two years later, they started selling off Budgens shops; the largest shops were disposed of on the open market, with shops in places including Tadley and Mildenhall going to larger shop chains. Other shops were divested to independent retailers, including Jempsons & Tout and CT Baker, which continued as franchises under the 'Budgens' name. Musgrave Group also franchised the Budgens brand to new retailers, leading to more shop openings in the independent sector and expanding the brand to many petrol station forecourts. In 2007, the divestment of the original Budgens shops to independent retailers was complete, although by March 2009, a few underperforming Budgens stores had been returned to Musgrave. A further eight stores were acquired in 2009 by a Budgens franchise partner from the Co-op, which had acquired them on taking over the Somerfield group, but was instructed to dispose of them by the Office of Fair Trading). These stores closed just eightmonths later. In May 2015, Musgrave Group confirmed that it had reached an agreement to sell Budgens and Londis for ¬£40 million to the wholesaler Booker Group, subject to regulatory approval. In January 2017 Tesco launched a takeover bid for Booker, including the Budgens fascia. Shops Budgens in Southam Budgens stores range in size from around 140m¬≤ to around 1,200m¬≤, and therefore fall into the convenience shop size range or the bottom end of the supermarket size range. According to retail analysts TNS Worldpanel, Budgens ranked 13th in the grocery sector in the United Kingdom in December 2004, with a market share of 0.4%. The largest Budgens shop was in the town of Holt, Norfolk, with just over 13,000 square feet/1,207m until it was destroyed by fire on 20 June 2020. The first two Scottish shops opened in July 2016, these were bought from the Coop, and had previously been branded as Somerfield and Safeway. They are located in Paisley and Prestwick. The Paisley shop closed later that year. In 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2012, Budgens was voted Fresh Foods Convenience Retailer of the Year in the company owned sector at the Retail Industry Awards. Corporate identity Budgen corporate identity (1969 to 1989) Currently, there is no official record of previous corporate identities used by this company. As the supermarket concept developed in the United Kingdom in the 1950s, the appearance of the brand names developed as well and were designed to be colourful, eye catching and distinctive. Budgens adopted a colour scheme during the end of the 1960s, which incorporated orange as the base colour, very popular at the time. The shops were branded simply as 'Budgen', a progression from 'Budgen & Co. Ltd.', in a unique white font on the orange background. A distinctive logo was also used for the 'Budgen' branding, which incorporated a tulip (symbolising freshness) depicted in orange and white on a brown rounded square background. The orange 'Budgen' corporate identity was used from c. 1968 to 1989. Budgen was subsequently rebranded 'Budgens' around 1990.. The orange gave way to a white background, the tulip logo disappeared and the font was changed to a handwriting style scribble, in orange, underlined in green. This was used until around 1997, when the identity was replaced with a dark green colour scheme with 'Budgens' in white capital letters. This identity has again been replaced with a lighter two-tone green background, with the 'Budgens' device now depicted in a lower case font.

In many modern western societies foster care can be organised by the state to care for children with troubled family backgrounds, usually on a temporary basis. In many pre-modern societies fosterage was a form of patronage, whereby influential families cemented political relationships by bringing up each other's children, similar to arranged marriages, also based on dynastic or alliance calculations. This practice was once common in Ireland, Wales, and Scotland. Fosterage in Scotland In medieval Highland society there was a system of fosterage among clan leaders, where boys and girls would leave their parent's house to be brought up in that of other chiefs, creating a fictive bond of kinship that helped cement alliances and mutual bonds of obligation.A. Cathcart, Kinship and Clientage: Highland Clanship, 1451‚Äì1609 (Brill, 2006), , pp. 81‚Äì2. In his A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland (1775), writer Samuel Johnson described the fosterage custom as he saw it practised.A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland by Samuel Johnson. 1775 edition. Gutenberg text accessed May 23, 2008 Fosterage in Medieval Iceland Fosterage or \\"fostering\\" is frequently referred to in the medieval Sagas of Icelanders. Original family ties and rights of inheritance were not affected, nor was it required for the fostered child to be an orphan or for the biological father to be deceased. Moreover, the fostering of another man's child was regarded as a source of honor to the birth father; and conventionally the fostering party was of inferior social status to the biological father. An exception to this convention is found in Nj√°ls saga, where Nj√°l Thorgeirsson, a very prominent man, fosters Hoskuld, the son of Thrain Sigfusson, after the death of Thrain in battle. Portions of Ireland, Scotland and the Hebrides were ruled for long periods of time by Norse invaders during the Middle Ages; but it is unknown which culture was the original source of the custom of fosterage. Literary fosterage In Ancient Ireland, ollams taught children either for payment or for no compensation. Children were taught a particular trade and treated like family; their original family ties were often severed. Fosterage in other cultures There was similar custom in the Caucasus, called Atalik - :ru:–ê—Ç–∞–ª—ã—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ.
