McGeever took over as caretaker manager of Finn Harps at the age of 24 \\"three days before Christmas\\" in 1984. Source is an Irish sportsperson from County Donegal. He played association football as a defender for Fanad United and in the League of Ireland for Sligo Rovers and Finn Harps. He played Gaelic football in midfield for Donegal, for which he also captained. He has had success while managing Finn Harps, as well as the Clonmel Commercials GAA club and the Tipperary county team. Early life McGeever is a native of Derryconnor, in the Cloughaneely region of Donegal in north-west Ireland. He first discovered association football in the village hall in Gortahork, where he was a spectator at parish league games, and began playing the sport when he was around 11 years of age. He credits Fr Michael (\\"Mick\\") Sweeney, whom he first encountered at secondary school in 1974, with influencing his interest in association football. Around the same time, another teacher ‚Äî Fr Sean Gallagher ‚Äî stimulated McGeever's interest in Gaelic football. The school won the under-14 county title and the under-16 national title against Summerhill. McGeever later attended Thomond College of Education, Limerick. Playing and management career McGeever won the 1979 FAI Youth Cup with Fanad United, when the team unexpectedly defeated Shelbourne 3‚Äì1 in the final. Following on from this victory Patsy McGowan signed McGeever for Sligo Rovers. McGeever was in the bog in West Donegal when, he later said: \\"There was Patsy McGowan coming towards me, dressed as always and a form in his hand‚Ä¶ I had to get out of a hole, wash my hands and sign the form\\". McGeever credits McGowan, alongside Fr Sweeney, Fr Gallagher and Seosamh Kelly, as being the most influential people on his sporting career. McGeever also received another offer after his encounter with McGowan in the bog: \\"Busty [Blake] spoke to me after that about going to [Finn] Harps, but I had already the form signed with Sligo. I was going to college in Limerick and the journey to Sligo was handier\\". At the age of 19, McGeever played in the 1981 FAI Cup Final with Sligo Rovers, but his team were defeated by Dundalk. The same year he captained Donegal in midfield (alongside Denis Bonner, twin of Packie) against Monaghan in the final of the Ulster Under-21 Senior Football Championship, but his team were defeated by two points. He was part of a group of seven, including Pauric Gallagher (the driver), Jimmy Kennedy, Michael McBrearty, Michael McGeehin, Donnacha Mac Niallais and Seamus Meehan, who made their way back and forth from Thomond College for games and training sessions. McGeever's career progressed to the extent that the English professional club Tottenham Hotspur invited him to train with their team in the summer of 1982 shortly after their FA Cup win. However, after only two weeks in London (where he trained under manager Keith Burkinshaw with 1978 FIFA World Cup winners Ossie Ardiles and Ricky Villa, as well as Glenn Hoddle, all three of whom were late back to their club as they had been playing in that summer's World Cup), McGeever returned to Ireland and injured one of his cruciate ligaments in a Gaelic football match in which he was not supposed to be playing. He had only returned from London for two nights when he heard that Seosamh Kelly was organising a Cloich Cheann Fhaola team to play a match against Naomh M√≠che√°l at the Burn Road in Termon, and ‚Äî ignoring his mother's advice to rest ‚Äî off he went. McGeever then made matters worse by carrying on and, while contesting a header in the opening minutes of that season's first league game against Bohemians, \\"came down and the knee buckled under me\\" as he put it in a 2012 interview with the Sunday Independent. He said in 2020: \\"At that time, no-one knew anything about cruciate ligaments\\". McGeever returned to England to have surgery performed upon him by a Professor Dandy. He would wear a bandage for the rest of his playing career and had a knee replacement in around 2013. Meanwhile, a now McGeeverless Tottenham went on to collect the 1983‚Äì84 UEFA Cup. The injury left McGeever on the sidelines for one year, a crucial year, as his team Sligo Rovers won the 1983 FAI Cup Final without him. To make matters worse, the Donegal football team of which he had been captain the previous year had claimed the 1983 All-Ireland Football Championship title, also without McGeever. Sligo Rovers released McGeever in 1984. He then signed for Finn Harps (managed at the time by Bobby Toland after Patsy McGowan was sacked), scoring a goal on his debut against Drogheda United. He turned to coaching at Finn Harps and became caretaker manager of the club in December 1984, a role he filled for four months. While in the United States in the middle of 1985, Harps appointed Tommy McConville as manager without informing McGeever. He decided to return to the field, \\"playing on one leg basically for about 10 years\\", he told the Sunday Independent in 2012. As a consequence of his injury, McGeever missed out on Donegal's 1992 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final victory, again watching on as many of his former teammates achieved the pinnacle of the sport of Gaelic football. Donegal manager Brian McEniff had invited him to train with the county team in 1990 on the back of McGeever's performances alongside Con McLaughlin in the Cloich Cheann Fhaola full-forward line. McGeever said: \\"Out of respect for Brian I went up and gave it a month. I was nowhere near it and, in fairness, I have no regrets about not being in the squad of '92. I gave it a go at training and was well off it\\". McGeever restarted his playing career at Fanad United, with whom he won the 1987‚Äì88 FAI Intermediate Cup by defeating Tramore Athletic 1‚Äì0 in the final at Dalymount Park. Patsy McGowan ‚Äî who resumed management of Finn Harps in June 1992 ‚Äî signed McGeever as a player. When Harps sacked McGowan for the fifth and final time in December 1995, McGeever again took over as caretaker manager for a three-month spell until Dermot Keely arrived in late February 1996. After Keely departed, McGeever became manager of Harps, this time on a permanent basis. As manager he brought Finn Harps to the 1997‚Äì98 FAI Cup semi- final and to the 1999 FAI Cup Final against Bray Wanderers, where three games were required to separate the sides, ultimately in Bray's favour. In the second of these games, said McGeever in 2012, \\"[W]e were a goal up and 30 seconds left. Then we conceded a penalty, our 'keeper saved it, but they got to the rebound first\\". After Harps lost six games from the first seven in the 1999‚Äì2000 League of Ireland Premier Division, McGeever resigned as manager. He signed for Bonagee United. But McGeever admitted he was an \\"absentee father\\". His wife suggested they move to Clonmel, the town in County Tipperary from which she came, and which is located in Munster, the southernmost province on the island. After a brief lull, McGeever adapted to the move from the north- west by taking on the role of managing the local association football club Clonmel Town. With Clonmel Town he won six consecutive leagues and reached the semi-final of the 2011 FAI Junior Cup. McGeever also became involved with the town's GAA club, Clonmel Commercials, managing them at under-21 and senior levels. His involvement with Clonmel Commercials was encouraged by referee Brian White and McGeever's son Cathal was also playing for the club. Seven players from the club were involved when Tipperary won the 2011 All-Ireland Minor Football Championship. McGeever led Clonmel Commercials to the final of the 2012 Tipperary Senior Football Championship. He took charge of the Tipperary minor football team on an initial two-year term (later extended to a third year). In his first year in charge Kerry defeated Tipperary, captained by the future professional Australian rules footballer Colin O'Riordan, in the Munster Football Championship, while Monaghan defeated them in the All-Ireland Football Championship quarter-final. Kerry defeated Tipperary again in the Munster Football Championship in McGeever's second year in charge. In his third year in charge McGeever took Tipperary all the way to the final of the All-Ireland Football Championship, though they lost, again to Kerry. He led Clonmel Commercials to the 2015 Tipperary Senior Football Championship, the 2015 Munster Senior Football Championship, and ‚Äî later ‚Äî to the 2017 Tipperary Senior Football Championship. In 2019, McGeever was named as a selector for the Tipperary senior football team when David Power was appointed manager following the resignation of Liam Kearns, with long-term McGeever ally McGeehin named as head coach. Television work McGeever has commentated for and provided analysis for TG4's Irish language coverage of association football and Gaelic football, often mixing references to the two sports. Personal life McGeever taught for a time at St Eunan's College in Letterkenny. He also taught at Pobalscoil Chloich Cheann Fhaola. After moving to Tipperary, he became principal of Gaelchol√°iste Ch√©itinn in Clonmel. While based in the south of Ireland during the school year, McGeever maintains contact with Ollie Horgan, a former colleague at St Eunan's College who had managed Fanad United and, following McGeever's move to Clonmel, went on to also manage Finn Harps. McGeever is married to Fionnuala, with whom he has two sons and a daughter. One son played on the Clonmel Commercials minor football team, while the other is a golfer and the daughter is a camogie player at county level.

Later associated with Grigory Zinoviev's New Opposition and Leon Trotsky's United Opposition, he was secretely communicating with Trotsky in late 1932 about entering his bloc. He was purged from the Communist Party, and was later imprisoned in Vorkuta in 1937, after which he served as an NKVD informant. He was ultimately executed on 27 July 1942 by a Special Collegium of the NKVD. He is one of the only victims of Joseph Stalin's purges that was not posthumously rehabilitated or reinstated to the party after his death.  Biography  Born in 1891 to a Polish- Armenian family in Saint Petersburg as the son of an architect, he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1908, and sided with the Bolshevik faction led by Vladimir Lenin. In 1910, he emigrated to Switzerland and worked as party secretary in the Z√ºrich Region. Following the February Revolution, Georgy Safarov was one of 31 individuals who accompanied Vladimir Lenin in a sealed train under German supervision to Petrograd, along with other notable communist figures including Grigory Zinoviev, Karl Radek, Inessa Armand, and Lenin's wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya. He was a member of the Military Revolutionary Committee, which also included members such as Joseph Stalin, Andrei Bubnov, Moisei Uritsky, Felix Dzerzhinsky, and Yakov Sverdlov, and took part in the October Revolution. Following the Bolshevik seizure of power and the outbreak of the Russian Civil War, he was appointed a member of the Presidium of the Ural Regional Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik), also popularly referred to as the Ural Soviet, and worked as editor-in-chief of the party's regional newspaper, the Ural Worker, and served on the editorial board of Pravda, the party's official state newspaper. In July 1918, Safarov, as a member of the Presidium of the Ural Regional Soviet under Alexander Beloborodov, was a party to the unanimous decision to execute the Romanovs imprisoned in Yekaterinburg, who included the deposed Emperor Nicholas II, his wife Empress Alexandra, and their five children Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia, and Alexei. Safarov was a signatory to the resolution on the shooting, and sent a final telegram to Yakov Sverdlov in Moscow along with Filipp Goloshchekin seeking final approval. Yakov Yurovsky, the chief executioner, later recorded that a signed response from Sverdlov had been passed to him by Goloshchekin around 7:00 PM on 16 July. He later assisted in the procurement of materials for the disposal of the remains, and the confiscation of the Romanov's property by the state. On 18 July, a day after the killings of the Romanovs in Yekaterinburg, Safarov traveled to nearby Alapayevsk as a representative of the Ural Soviet to direct the killings of a number of Romanov extended relations and their companions, including Alexandra's sister Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine, Prince Ioann Konstantinovich, Prince Igor Konstantinovich, Prince Konstantine Konstantinovich, Grand Duke Sergey Mikhaylovich, and Prince Vladimir Pavlovich Paley, as well as Elisabeth's trusted friend and companion Sister Varvara Yakovleva, and Fyodor Remez, Grand Duke Sergey's personal secretary. He was safely evacuated from the Ural Region along with most of the other members of the Ural Soviet prior to the arrival of the White Army, who captured Yekaterinburg on 25 July. In November 1919, Safarov was sent to Turkestan to take part in the suppression of the White Movement and the Basmachi there and the establishment of Soviet power in the region, and was a member of the Turkburo of the Central Committee of the RCP (b) from 1920 until 1922. He was appointed a member of the Executive Committee of the Comintern in 1922 and served as a Candidate Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1921‚Äì1925. Following the death of Vladimir Lenin, Safarov largely supported Grigory Zinoviev's faction in the ensuing inter- party conflict, and from 1926, was a member of the United Opposition, formed as a merger of Zinoviev's New Opposition and Leon Trotsky's Left Opposition. In 1926, he was appointed First Secretary of the Plenipotentiary Office in the Republic of China and was thereafter appointed to the Trade Mission of the Soviet Union in Turkey. On 18 December 1927, he was expelled from the CPSU and arrested. He was sentenced to 4 years of exile by a Special Collegium of the NKVD and deported to Achinsk. After filing an application for his withdrawal from the opposition on 9 November 1928, he was restored to the CPSU. From 1930 until 1934, he served as the head of the Eastern Department of the Executive Committee of the Comintern. In an unknown date he joined a secret opposition group with a Bolshevik named Tarkhanov, which not much is known about. A letter of Lev Sedov written by the end of 1932 said this group would still join a secret political bloc with Leon Trotsky, Lev Kamenev and Grigori Zinoviev as well as some rightists: \\"The Safar‚ÄìTarkhan Group have not yet formally entered they have too extreme a position; they will enter very soon.\\" Trotsky's letters defined the bloc as a force to fight Stalinist repression. Trotskyist historian Pierre Brou√© said the bloc dissolved in early 1933, because some of its members were arrested and Zinoviev and Kamenev yet again capitulated to Stalin. On 25 December 1934 after the assassination of Sergey Kirov, he was again arrested as part of a series of mass arrests which came to be described as the \\"Kirov stream\\". On 16 January 1935, he was again sentenced to 2 years of exile in the so-called \\"Case of the Leningrad Counter- Revolutionary Zinoviev group of Safarov, Zalutsky, and others\\" and again deported to Achinsk. On 16 December 1936, he was arrested in Achinsk and sentenced to 5 years in prison on charges of \\"Counter-Revolutionary Trotskyist activities\\", and was sent to Vorkuta on 15 January 1937. While still serving his sentence in the Gulag, Safarov was sentenced to death by a decree of a Special Collegium of the NKVD on 16 July 1942 following the German Invasion of the Soviet Union, ironically on the same day Safarov had signed the death warrant for the Romanovs 24 years prior. He was executed on 27 July 1942 in Saratov and was consigned to an unmarked grave. Safarov was the only individual convicted in the case of the Leningrad Counter-Revolutionary Zinoviev Group who was not posthumously rehabilitated by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR, as the court concluded that \\"Safarov G.I., given his provocative activities after his arrest, is not advisable to rehabilitate\\". The certificate of the case prepared on 16 October 1961 by the responsible controller of the CPC at the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Military Prosecutor of the Chief Military Prosecutor's Office noted: \\"It is especially necessary to dwell on the testimony of Safarov. At repeated interrogations during the preliminary investigation in the present case, Safarov named 111 people, Zinoviev, Kamenev, and many other former opposition participants, as well as persons whom Safarov independently attributed participation in the opposition. Without citing specific facts that could be used as a basis for accusing the persons named in anti-Soviet activities, Safarov attributed to them the holding of such and each of them a negative political characteristic. Subsequently, in 1938-1940, during his time in prison, Safarov was used as a witness and a provocateur on the instructions of state security personnel, and also, on his own initiative, gave testimony to numerous individuals. Safarov reported in a statement dated 10 September 1941 to Vsevolod Merkulov, that for more than two years he has been \\"rigorously fulfilling the tasks of the investigative unit for combating enemies of the people\\". In another statement addressed to Lavrentiy Beria he insisted that he could still be \\"something of great use to the NKVD\\" and requested that Beria resume issuing him additional funds and supplies. For this reason, Safarov was not posthumously rehabilitated or reinstated in the party.

Originally, it is utilized by farmers to bring their home-grown products from the mountains to the town's market or to the city market of Dumaguete 9 kilometers west of Valencia (Negros Oriental, Philippines).  Contraption design  Like a scooter, the ligiron is a medium of transportation made from hardwood such as tugas, tisa, bamboo, mahogany and other sturdy wood that can be found in Negros Oriental. The rider sits and places his feet on the bamboo flooring and maneuver the four-wheeled vehicle using the scooter-like handles. The ligiron devise needs to start from the top of any downward terrain because the descending force is the only power that keeps the ligiron rolling. The wood and bamboo utilized in the devise are fastened together using rubber from second-hand or worn-out tires, nails and wood glue to keep them in one piece. The brakes are made of rubber. The ligiron does not use gas or battery. The lubricant used on it is from shredded cocoa seeds. The original models do not have any braking mechanism making the driver rely only on foot brakes.  Racing  The first ligiron competition was organized by Nicky Dumapit which took place in 2013 in Camp Lookout, Barangay Bongbong, Valencia, Negros Oriental. In the 2018 race, there were 20 participating racers competing in three divisions, namely, beginners, elite/experts, and the long jump.

The agency was established in 1913 and is headquartered in Olympia, Washington. The current director of the WSDA is Derek Sandison. History The Washington State Department of Agriculture (originally known as the Washington Agriculture Commission) was established in 1913. In 1915, the state legislature granted the WSDA authority to create and enforce grading standards for apples and other tree fruit packed in the state. The grading system for apples was the first of its kind in the United States. The United States Department of Agriculture adopted national grade standards for apples in 1923. In 1980, the WSDA began an apple maggot control program in order to prevent the pest from establishing itself in eastern Washington, an important apple-growing region. The program consists of an Apple Maggot Quarantine Area, which establishes a pest-free area. The agency also deploys apple maggot traps to a selection of sites in the state. The boundaries of the quarantine area are altered when the apple maggot is discovered in the pest-free area. , the apple maggot has never been detected in fruit packed commercially in the state. Following the passage of Washington Initiative 502 in 2012, the WSDA provides services for the state's recreational cannabis industry. The agency inspects cannabis edible processing facilities and maintains a list of pesticides which are allowed to be used by cannabis growers in Washington. In coordination with the state Liquor and Cannabis Board, the WSDA tests retail cannabis for pesticides. Over 40% of samples tested by the agency contain illegal levels of pesticide. Washington does not require all cannabis to be tested, instead the WSDA conducts random tests and investigates complaints. The WSDA plans to provide a service similar to organic certification for cannabis beginning in 2019.

The lower floor was about seven or eight feet high. Horses and oxen were hitched to the posts. There was a terrace near the upper stairs, which turned into a large long room. The rest of the house was a largely open space with a low roof, sloping on both sides, eaves to the floor and, generally, no windows. If the eaves were slightly higher, there were small windows on both sides and a door on the back. In the middle of the building was a fireplace, burning day and night. The roof was covered with thatch and the doors and windows are made of bamboo. The construction is easy; it only took a few days to cut down bamboo and gather neighbors together to build it. They are also perishable and had to be repaired each year after the rainy season. This construction method was conducive to damp roof, drainage of rain, and to cater to the topography of the PingBa area. Most Dai live in the Pingba region. With abundant rainfall, an annual average temperature of 21 ‚ÑÉ the environment is very suitable for building bamboo structures. Besides being breathable and cool, bamboo buildings also avoid miasma, dampness and flooding, prevent insects and snakes from entering, and resist earthquakes. In addition, they are easy to set up. Description  thumb The floor of the bamboo building is square, and the ground floor is more overhead without walls, for raising livestock and piling up debris, upstairs there are the main room and bedroom, the main room with a fire pond, is a place to cook tea and family reunion; outside, there is an open front porch and a balcony. The front porch is the place where the host works, eats, rests and receives guests during the day. It is bright and airy. Sundeck is master wash one's hands and face, bask in clothes, air basks in crop and the place that deposit water jar. This corridor is an indispensable part of the bamboo building. Such a bamboo building a damp, two heat ventilation, three can avoid the invasion of insects and beasts, four can avoid the impact of floods. Because here annual rainfall concentration, often send flood, downstairs overhead, the wall and many gaps of bamboo sticks, so it is very conducive to the passage of the flood. Dai people believe in Buddhism and have many superstitious taboos. Almost every village has a Buddhist temple. It is stipulated that now houses shall be built on the opposite and side of the Buddhist temple; the floor height of the houses shall not exceed the mesa on which the Buddha sits in the Buddhist temple. Due to economic disparity, housing was in size and quality of the people in the village cannot be compared with his head, but also made many provisions in the building, such as labor people cannot build the tile houses, are not allowed to do carving decoration, the arches are not allowed to make three rooms, a room cannot use six lattice door, even no stairs into two segments, upstairs and downstairs pillars cannot use a long wood, also not stone column development and so on. Such restrictions have indeed affected the technical development of residential buildings, making it impossible for a large number of residential buildings to support a long life.  Detail  The model of Dau Bamboo house The Dai people often live in large bamboo houses built on the wet ground in the rainforest area. There are chickens and pigs under the house, and there is a fenced garden around the house. A typical house is 10 by 10 meters high, 2 to 3 meters above the ground, supported by wood and bamboo, the walls and floors are woven with bamboo, and the roof is a sloping thatched roof supported by bamboo poles. The house is usually divided into an inner bedroom and an outer living room with a fireplace for the kitchen. Those who can afford it are covered with floors and tiled roofs. The traditional residence of the Dai people has a spire and a second-floor balcony. Many Dai people now build houses with bricks and concrete. Some Dai houses have been influenced by the Chinese. They are built around acourtyard, only one meter above the ground, with mud-brick walls, thatched roofs, or tiled roofs. The entire structure of a traditional Dai bamboo building is made of bamboo bundling. The walls are made of bamboo sticks (thin pieces of bamboo), while the roof is covered with straw clamped by bamboo sticks. The bamboo building is very light. The overlook for Dai village Dai people live in a flat river valley. When it rains heavily, the open network of pillars at the building's base allow water to flow quickly underneath the structure. Even if the river rises, bamboo sticks tied to girders can be removed to cut the buoyancy of the house to prevent it from being washed away. When the river recedes, bamboo sticks can be tied up again without affecting the structure or use. Houses like these, built on stilts, are called columnar structures and are more than 10,000 years old. Most bamboo buildings now use hardwood for column beams and local materials built into the next two floors of the small building. On the ground floor only the pillars supporting the house can be used to raise livestock and pile up sundries. The upper floor is the space where people live, and can be divided into a porch, hall, bedroom, and balcony. This kind of building does not have a courtyard. Though it covers a small area, usable space abounds. The cost of local materials is low and the building is permeable, in line with the local climate and topography.  Types  The traditional bamboo house can be divided into three types‚ÄîPayasangtudi, Mahasati and Henmen. In the past, the Dai bamboo house was divided into two types: the official bamboo house and the civilian bamboo house. The officer‚Äôs bamboo house is spacious and bright. It adopts the style of Western ‚Äúgothic architecture‚Äù, the shape of the house is square, and the roof is shaped like a pyramid. The entire bamboo house is supported by 20 to 24 huge wooden stakes, which are built on stone. The internal shape is simple. The main room in the middle is the guest room. The living room is usually divided into two or three rooms for the owner's wife and children. The room of the officer's bamboo house is about 30 square meters and can accommodate about 20 people. Compared with the official bamboo house, the bamboo house of the people is quite narrow. The roof is covered with couch grass. The wooden pile cannot be built on stone, and figures cannot be carved on the wooden pile.  Development  In the process of bamboo house development, Dai people used their talents to constantly improve their structure and materials. For example, they have learnt to place large marbles under the pillars of the house so they do not touch the ground. This prevents moisture from climbing up the pillars, thus protecting the bamboo house from decay. To make bamboo houses more durable, the Dai people have also created many bamboo and wood treatment methods. To dissolve some soluble substances such as xylose, bamboo must be saturated for months in a river or pond, spoiling the starch so it does not attract moths or parasites. Wood that must be buried underground is first burnt to make the ground harder and to give it a layer of protection.  Disadvantages  Bamboo houses are vulnerable to fire. Each community sets its own rules. In the daytime of the dry season, no one is allowed to use fire; if a fire must be used, the user must go to a designated site. Bamboo houses are very rare. The house is filled with smoke and its chemical properties help it resist erosion and moths.  Dai villages  The Dai people usually live in villages of about 40 households. There are as many as 100 households in the big village. These villages are usually built on rivers or creeks and usually feature tall eucalyptus trees and exquisite Buddhist temples or pagodas.

It was built from 1832 to 1834. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  On 20 November 1830, David Leighton (son of John \\"Jack the Miller\\" Leighton) sold a parcel land to newly-arrived emigrant, John Clarke. The land was described as bounded by Windmill Street to the northwest, Lower Fort Street to the southeast, on the southwest by Henry McGee's land, and on the northeast by government land. Plans of Sydney from 1825 and 1828 do not show any buildings on the site, so it is concluded that the land was vacant at the time of the sale in 1830. A few months later, after Clarke had begun to fence the land in accordance with government requirements, the Director of Public Works instructed him to remove the fencing because the ground was dedicated government land. Clarke's appeal to be permitted to retain the land was eventually granted on the basis of his purchase in good faith; Leighton claimed that he had been entitled to sell the land which was purchased from Patrick Marmount, who was given it by Governor Macquarie as compensation for land resumed for the government windmill. In settling the claim to the land, Clarke was instructed to divide the land with James Lucas, who had purchased an adjacent allotment with a questionable chain of title. On 17 June 1833, Clarke obtained a Publican's Licence for a new hotel known as the Shipwright's Arms in Windmill Street and he renewed his licence annually until July 1836 which enabled him to trade as publican until July 1837. As Clarke did not own any other land on Windmill Street, nor did he hold any other hotel licences at this time, it is concluded that the licence was issued for a hotel occupying the building at 75 Windmill Street. The words 'Shipwright's Arms' were revealed to still be located on the facade of the building in the late 20th century. The 'Shipwright's Arms' not only served alcohol but, in line with the regulations of the day, also provided board and lodging. In 1835, Clarke placed a notice in the Sydney Herald stating: With Windmill Street being the main thoroughfare through to Millers Point proper and with direct links through to the (what is now known as) Walsh Bay wharves area and the steam ferry to the north via Pottinger Street, the intersection of Windmill Street and Lower Fort Street must have been a commercially vibrant area frequented by a range of maritime workers and merchants. Several other public houses ('pubs') were located in Windmill Street during this period, but the Shipwright's Arms was one of the earliest. The Whalers' Arms had stood on the opposite side of Windmill Street since 1831, but in 1839 it moved to a new building on the corner of Lower Fort Street and Windmill Street. The Hit or Miss and the Live and Let Live Hotels were built after Clarke's Shipwright's Arms on adjacent allotments to the south. The Hero of Waterloo Hotel was built on the adjacent site to the east by George Paton, stonemason, between 1840 and 1845 on land which he purchased from John Clarke's son following the elder's death in 1838. The Hero of Waterloo and two Whalers' Arms hotels, as well as the front verandah of No. 75 Windmill Street are visible in John Rae's painting \\"View down Windmill Street\\". John Clarke died on 20 July 1838, leaving five sons, the eldest also named John Clarke. John Clarke the younger subsequently applied for a deed of grant for the site (to be managed in trust on behalf of all five brothers) on 6 December 1839 and following an assessment by the Court of Claims, the land was granted on 18 June 1840 to John Clarke, cabinet maker. It was at this time that Clarke sold the corner portion of the land to George Paton, stonemason, who constructed the Hero of Waterloo Hotel on the site. Another of Clarke's sons, William Clarke, a cabinet-maker of Hunters Hill, received the title to the southern half of the allotment (fronting Lower Fort Street and today containing Argyle House, No. 85 Lower Fort Street) in 1844 and he constructed a single storey, three room, brick with shingled roof cottage with front verandah and an outbuilding. At some stage this separate dwelling and outbuilding, together with a yard area was fenced off from No. 75 Windmill Street and a right-ofway was formed giving access from the rear of the building at 75 Windmill Street to Lower Fort Street. This right-of-way still exists between the Hero of Waterloo Hotel and Argyle House. The rates assessment books from 1845 to 1948, variously describe the building at 75 Windmill Street as being either \\"stone\\" or \\"brick\\", with \\"brick\\" appearing more often in the records. A detached kitchen is also occasionally included in the description of the place. In the hipped roof form was altered for the construction of the Hero of Waterloo adjacent. In 1847, the title to the land was conveyed to three of John Clarke's five sons: James Richard Clarke (cabinet-maker, Sydney), Charles George Clarke (Sydney, shoemaker), and Edward Thomas Clarke (Sydney, mastmaker) as trustees. The City of Sydney Council rate books indicate that the property was occupied in that year by Robert Guy Torr, and the structure was described as a two-storey stone building with shingled roof containing eight rooms with a back kitchen. In 1853 the Clarke family trustees conveyed the property to Charles Stewart Quail, who in turn, nine months later, sold it to John Hordern of the well- known mercantile dynasty. After John Hordern's death in 1864, the property remained in the ownership of his trustees' until the 1880s. Hordern never occupied the building leasing the building throughout his period of ownership, and it continued to be leased following his death. Rosa Strange had operated a school on the premises in the early 1860s and Thomas Milton, a shipwright, lived at 75 Windmill Street from until 1882. After this tenancy, the property became a boarding house under the management of Charles Lamb. In 1880, Hordern's trustees advertised the property for sale. Perhaps in relation to the intended sale, F. H. Reuss surveyed the property in 1881 and produced a plan of it. Julia Quinn, a widow, purchased the site in 1886. She paid less for the land in 1886 than John Hordern had in 1853, and Quinn's transaction also included land in Newtown. This may reflect the perceived \\"obsolescence\\" of the building. During Julia Quinn's ownership, the property continued to be used as a boarding house for a number of years. It also appears that new rear outbuildings were constructed directly linking to the rear (south) elevation of the Main wing. =Resumption of No. 75 Windmill Street= In 1902, the property (at this time known as No. 65 Windmill Street) was assessed for rates by the City Council and the landlord was still listed as Mary Quinn, while the occupant was listed as John Ryan. The building was described as a dwelling house of stone with an iron roof of two floors with a total of eight rooms. By the time of the next rates assessment in 1907, the owner of the building (still known as No. 65 Windmill Street) was listed as the \\"NSW Government Rocks Resumption\\" with Ellen Josephson as the occupier. Following the resumption of the property, the Sydney Harbour Trust, and subsequently the Maritime Services Board leased 75 Windmill Street to private tenants as a single dwelling house. New outbuildings appear to have been constructed by the Sydney Harbour Trust about 1915, around the same time that the demolished houses on the south side of the street were being replaced by model workers' housing. In 1966, an application was lodged with the City Council by a Mrs L. Garroway on behalf of the Maritime Services Board, for use of the two front rooms as doctor's consulting and waiting rooms. A Dr. Geoffrey Davis occupied the front of the building until well into the 1980s. A number of photographs of Windmill Street taken during the first half of the 20th century show No. 75 Windmill Street visible to the right of the Hero of Waterloo and the building remains largely unchanged over the decades represented by these images. =Public Housing period (1986 to date)= The ownership of the property was transferred from the Maritime Services Board to the (former) Department of Housing in 1986. By 1991 the property was vacant and in 1992, a conservation plan for the building was prepared by Howard Tanner & Associates Architects. This was followed in 1995 by comprehensive restoration and upgrading works including the construction of a new rear wing addition containing a family room, laundry and WC fitout. The rear (south) bedroom on the eastern side at first floor level was converted into a bathroom and store and the rear (south) room on the eastern side at ground floor level was converted into a kitchen. At this time, the Sydney Harbour Trust outbuildings were demolished. Following these works, the property was used as a residence, managed by the Department of Families and Community Services.  Description  The adjoining two-storey rear wing, pictured in 2019, facing Windmill Street. Constructed in as a public house or \\"town inn\\", No. 75 Windmill Street is a two-storey building with a hipped roof and front verandah and with a later addition single storey rear wing. =Main wing= The Main wing is a corrugated metal, hipped roof building with painted cement rendered front and rear elevations marked out in ashlar over face brick with stone window sills and stone lintels and voussoirs to the ground floor front (north) windows. The eastern and western elevations of the Main wing abut the adjoining properties at No. 73 Windmill Street (to the west) and No. 81-83 Lower Fort Street (Hero of Waterloo Hotel to the east). The building is fronted with a corrugated metal roofed verandah with timber posts, louvred end screen and balustrade set on a sandstone base wall. The verandah is accessed from its eastern end. The front door of the building is a timber four panelled door with reeding and is surrounded by painted timber external pilasters and entablature. The main wing has two chimneys, one on the north side of the roof ridge being cement rendered, possibly brickwork with a sheet metal extension and the other on the southern side of the roof ridge being face brick work bagged over with cement with very large metal extension. Generally, roofing accessories, gutters and downpipes are modern and are either galvanised steel or zincalume. =Rear wing= The rear wing was constructed in the mid to late 1990s and is a single storey, painted timber clad building with curved metal roof, timber framed doors and windows and projecting eaves with turned timber brackets. =Interiors of No. 75 Windmill Street=Main Wing The ground floor of the Main wing consists of three living rooms and a later kitchen fitout to the rear room on the eastern side. Entry from the original front door leads directly into the main front room with no entry hall or vestibule. The eastern front room at ground floor retains its original timber cornice and ceiling rose. These features (the front door case, cornice and ceiling rose) all dating from 1832‚Äì33, are considered to be rare. The fireplace in the main (west) front room at ground level has been brick over and has a painted timber chimney piece. The first floor consists of a large front room and smaller bedroom to the rear (south) on the western side. The former bedroom to the rear (south) on the eastern side has been partitioned and converted into a bathroom and store room in the late 20th century. Throughout the main wing, the ceilings are a mix of lath and plaster or plasterboard (aside from the main front roof at first floor level which has a timber boarded ceiling), some with timber battening, lime plaster walls, timber skirtings, architraves and linings to doors and windows. The timber stairs are mostly original with some repairs and reconstruction work. The staircase is timber lined. Both the ground and first floor levels are carpeted (excluding the bathroom, store room and kitchen) over timber flooring. Rear Wing The interiors of the Rear wing are plasterboard ceilings and walls with timber skirtings and carpet or tiles over a concrete slab. The rear wing consists of a family room, laundry and WC. =Landscape and Vegetation= The subject building occupies the whole of the northern (front) portion of the allotment with the front verandah of the main wing projecting into the public footpath. To the rear (south) is a small rear yard. The rear wing of the main building is located on the western portion of the site. The eastern enclosure of the place is defined by the rear elevations of the Hero of Waterloo Hotel and the southern enclosure of the place is defined by the rear elevation of No. 85 Lower Fort Street. Access from No. 85 Lower Fort Street into the rear yard of No. 75 Windmill is provided via a paved pathway. The rear yard is a mix of paving, with raised brick garden beds and cement rendered steps leading to the shared right-of-way located in the south-eastern corner of the property. There are no substantial plantings located at the place. =Setting= The place is located on the southern side of Windmill Street, close to the junction with Lower Fort Street. Windmill Street is the main access road connecting Lower Fort Street in the east to Millers Point proper in the west and is one of the oldest streets in the Millers Point precinct. Although located above the level of the Walsh Bay wharf area, views of this former commercial maritime precinct from Windmill Street are no longer available due to substantial development undertaken throughout the 20th century to the north of the street. The buildings on the southern side of Windmill Street consist of a mix of former commercial buildings dating from the colonial period (1830s and 1840s), row housing dating from the latter half of the 19th century and purpose-built worker's housing built in the early 20th century. = Condition = The Main Wing of No. 75 Windmill Street remains highly intact to its original configuration retaining most of its internal layout and detailing. However, the place has undergone some change during the early and late 20th century, the most significant being the loss of the original partitioning that formed the front rooms at first floor level. Externally, the Main Wing is also highly intact, although restoration and repair works in the 1990s have resulted in the rendering of the front facade (possibly the reconstruction of an early addition). The Rear Wing to the property is a later addition ( 1995), although its location on the west side of the property and general form and scale are not incompatible with evidence of the original/early outbuildings. The whole of the site is also highly intact to its late 19th century configuration and includes an early site feature, the passageway linking the property to Lower Fort Street in the south that was formed in the 1840s.  Heritage listing  No. 75 Windmill Street is historically significant on a State level for being a very rare and relatively intact surviving example of a purpose built domestic form \\"town inn\\". Constructed in c.1832-33, it is the earliest surviving hotel building located in Millers Point, one of Australia's oldest urban precincts and also one of a small and rare group of colonial public house buildings located in the immediate locality. The building is aesthetically significant on a State level as a very good example of a relatively intact example of a Colonial Georgian style town building containing some features of outstanding significance due to their style and rarity, including the front door case, the front verandah (albeit with altered balustrade), the ceiling cornice and ceiling rose in Space 2 as well as the sandstock brickwork and painted signage known to exist on the front facade (albeit covered by lateraddition render). It is also aesthetically significant on a State level for its contribution to the character of Windmill Street, one of the oldest streets in Millers Point and as one of a small group of surviving colonial buildings located around the junction of Windmill and Lower Fort Streets, forming part of a rare, remnant colonial streetscape. The place is part of a group of buildings of remarkable integrity and consistency of 19th century and early 20th century form and detail within Millers Point. The place makes an important contribution to the character Millers Point, a precinct of aesthetic significance on a State level and this contribution makes No. 75 Windmill Street also of aesthetic significance on a State level. The building and its history is likely to be held in high esteem by those interested in Sydney's early history, the history of public houses in Australia and Australia's early architecture. It is also likely to be valued by groups of people who live or have lived in Millers Point in recent decades, a precinct of State significance for its social and cultural values. The place has moderate potential to contain archaeological deposits within subfloor areas and building cavities and low potential for underground archaeological deposits, which have the potential to further contribute to an understanding of early 19th century public houses and domestic life in Australia. Shipwrights Arms Inn was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Constructed in c.1832-33 for use as a public house (operating until c.1837) the former 'Shipwright's Arms', No. 75 Windmill Street is of exceptional historical significant as being the oldest of a small group of surviving colonial public houses in Millers Point, and is evidence of the earliest form of such buildings. No. 75 Windmill Street is a rare, surviving example of a \\"town inn\\" (a public house providing liquor, food and accommodation within a domestic form building located within an urban setting), constructed in this form to meet colonial legislative requirements of the 1830s restricting the sale of liquor. The configuration of the site, including the rear wing, the alignment of the adjoining properties to the east, west and south and the shared passageway leading to Lower Fort Street are historically significant as evidence of the early (1840s) subdivision of Millers Point, one of Australia's earliest suburbs. As one of a small, surviving group of colonial commercial buildings located near the junction of Windmill and Lower Fort Streets, the property is significant as being part of the early commercial development of Walsh Bay and Millers Point, two of Australia's earliest urban precincts. The place meets the criteria for historical significance on a State and Local level. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. No. 75 Windmill Street contributes to the associative significance of the history of the Millers Point and Dawes Point Precinct. As a specific individual component of this wider precinct, the subject property has significance under this criterion at a local level as one of the properties resumed by the NSW Government in c.1902 throughout the locality and subsequently managed by the Sydney Harbour Trust as a single residence (although very little physical evidence of their involvement survives). The place meets the criteria for historical associational significance ona Local level. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The form of the subject property is of aesthetic significance as a very good example of a relatively intact Colonial Georgian style town building, demonstrating the aesthetic characteristics of a colonial domestic form building, including the symmetrical facade, (original) exposed brick walling, stone lintels and sills, verandah with separate roof, lourvred shutters and classical detailing to front door case. The place is indicative of the pre-1900s architectural character of Millers Point and because of its age and rarity, the building has some value as a comparative example of 1830s building construction techniques. Constructed in 1832-33, the building contains some features of outstanding significance for their style and rarity, including the front door case, Space 2 ceiling cornice and ceiling rose and the front verandah (albeit with altered balustrade). Originally constructed in sandstock brick with the name \\"Shipwright's Arm's\\" painted on its front facade and which is known to survive under the later addition render is of outstanding significance. The place is part of a very rare group of colonial buildings (along with the Hero of Waterloo Hotel, No. 67 Windmill Street, Nos. 80 to 92 Windmill Street opposite and the new Whaler's Arms Hotel, No. 79 Lower Fort Street) which together are indicative of colonial streetscapes in Australia (as illustrated by John Rae in 1842). Together with the majority of the properties located on the eastern end of Windmill Street at the junction with Lower Fort Street, the place forms part of unique group of early buildings showing remarkable integrity and consistency of 19th and early 20th century character. Located in Millers Point, one of Australia's oldest urban precincts and on Windmill Street, one of the oldest streets in the precinct, the place makes a significant contribution to the character and architecture of Millers Point, a precinct of historic, social and aesthetic significance on a State level and this contribution makes No. 75 Windmill Street also of aesthetic significance on a State level. The place meets the criteria for aesthetic significance on a State and local level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The building is likely to be held in esteem by groups interested in theearly history of Sydney, and groups of people who have lived in Millers Point or The Rocks in recent decades including descendants of the early residents of the place and the locality and former public housing residents of the place and the locality and their descendants since the resumption of the area by the NSW State government in c.1900. The place is significant for being located within and associated with the historic, social and aestheticsignificance of the Millers Point and Dawes Point Precinct and Millers Point Conservation Area, areas of State significance in their own right for their social and cultural values. This significance is reflected in the many heritage listings that exist both for the property, its setting and the State significant precincts of Millers Point and Dawes Point. The place meets the criteria for social significance on a State and Local level. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Given that the place is relatively intact to its c.1832-33 configuration; there is high potential for archaeological deposits remaining within the building cavities, roof spaces and below the ground floor level, although this potential may have been reduced as a result of 1990s refurbishment works. Any deposits found dating from the early 19th century could be of high significance and have the potential to contribute to an understanding of early inns in Sydney, very few of which still survive and early domestic life in Australia generally. Archaeological remains related to the original use of the place would be of exceptional significance. The analysis of the archaeological resource of the whole of the Rocksand Millers PointHigginbotham, 2002 notes that No. 75 Windmill Street has been partly disturbed and recommends an archaeological assessment of the place. The place meets the criteria for scientific significance on a State and Local level. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The former 'Shipwright's Arms' Inn, No. 75 Windmill Street is a very rare, colonial, domestic form \\"town inn\\" located within an urban centre. Although inn buildings of a domestic form are found throughout regional NSW, only No. 75 Windmill Street and Lilyvale, 176 Cumberland Street are known to be surviving examples of this particular form of public house in the City of Sydney. Their location in the heart of Sydney, Australia's first settlement and only urban centre existing in the 1830s makes these buildings of exceptional significance. No. 75 Windmill Street is the oldest surviving public house building located within Millers Point and its domestic form again makes this building of exceptional significance, given that all other surviving colonial public houses in Millers Point would be classified as \\"taverns\\" and are commercial style buildings. The place contains a number of features dating from 1832-33 including the front door case, the cornice and ceiling rose to Space 2 and the front verandah (albeit with later balustrade) which are rare, surviving, colonial architectural features. The place meets the criteria for rarity on a State and Local level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The place is representative on a Local and State level of a colonial public house of which there are a number of forms. The former 'Shipwright's Arms' Inn is a very rare, colonial, domestic form \\"town inn\\" located within an urban centre. Although inn buildings of a domestic form are found throughout regional NSW, other known historic examples of the \\"town inn\\", including the Pulteney Hotel, Petty's Hotel, the Three Tuns and the Rose and Crown, no longer survive. Only No. 75 Windmill Street and Lilyvale, 176 Cumberland Street are known to be surviving examples of this particular form of public house in the City of Sydney and their location in the heart of Sydney, Australia's first settlement and urban centre makes these buildings of exceptional significance. As the place was originally constructed as a public house, the Shipwright's Arms, the place is one of a small and unique group of surviving colonial hotel, tavern or inn buildings located within the Millers Point area which together demonstrate the development of colonial public houses in Sydney. However, of this group, No. 75 Windmill Street is the only example of the domestic form colonial \\"town inn\\", as all other surviving colonial public houses in Millers Point would be classified as \\"taverns\\" and are commercial style buildings. As a surviving colonial building located on Windmill Street, the place forms part of a group of residential and commercial buildings that are representative of the early (pre-1850) configuration and development of one of the oldest streets in the locality, which was developed in association with the initial stone quarrying of Millers Point, the windmills located on Jack the Miller's Point and the commercial wharfs at Walsh Bay, and which is one of Australia' oldest suburbs. The history of the place, from the initial the construction of the building and its varied use as a public house, single residence, boarding house and school, its resumption by the government and subsequent use of the place as public housing in its various forms, is somewhat typical also of the history of residential development throughout Millers Point. The place meets the criteria for representativeness on a State and Local level  See also  *Stevens Terrace  References = Bibliography = = Attribution =External links New South Wales State Heritage Register sites located in Millers Point Georgian Revival architecture in Australia Houses in Sydney Pubs in Sydney Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register 1834 establishments in Australia Commercial buildings completed in 1834 Millers Point Conservation Area ","title":"Shipwrights Arms Inn"},{"id":"58967602","text":"State Road 606 (NM 606) is a state highway in the US state of New Mexico.

Administratively, the hotel is in the City of Sydney local government area. It was designed by H. D. Walsh and built in 1915-16. It is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Millers Point and the adjacent Walsh Bay have been a residential and dockyard area since the mid 19th century. The current Palisade Hotel was built on the site of an earlier hotel of the same name. In the 1870s the site was owned by James Parle. The first rate for the hotel was paid in 1880 and it is assumed that it was built close to that time. The rate book described the hotel as a three-storey brick and stone building with an iron roof and twelve rooms. This hotel was kept by Henry Taylor until 1911. The early years of the twentieth century following Federation were characterised by a new confidence and nationalism. After the bubonic plague crisis around the turn of the century the population of Millers Point grew again and the demand for watering holes was such that the Sydney Harbour Trust had to build replacement hotels to cater to the port workers and local community. The new Palisade Hotel was one of four that were built by the Trust, the others being Dumbarton Castle, the Big House (now the Sussex Hotel) and the Harbour View Hotel. The construction of the Palisade Hotel commenced on 6 April 1915 and was completed in May 1916 at a total cost of just over 3000 pounds. The hotel was described as consisting of five storeys built of stone, brick and cement, with steel and timber framing. It contained a large bar, two parlours on the ground floor, two sitting rooms and dining room on the first floor, 15 bedrooms, kitchen, laundry, bathrooms, lavatories, pantries and a large flat roof for drying purposes. There was also a fire escape complete with landing at each floor. The 1916 plans of the hotel indicates a long U shaped bar on the ground floor with a canopy facing the main entrance. The public bar was at the front, and behind this was a private bar on one side and a jug and bottle department on the other. Two parlours towards the rear of the ground floor accessed from a separate private entrance way were provided. A hall divided these parlours from the public bar area. The parlours were heated with open fires. In the basement were toilets, bottle store and the cellar with a floor hatch to provide access to the bar serving area. A report on the hotel in 1949 provides an indication as to the use of the hotel. Few changes were made from the original layout. The first floor was residential with two bedrooms a dining room, kitchenette and lounge. On the second floor were six bedrooms, one being used as a sitting room, toilet, bathroom, and linen room. On the fourth floor was the kitchen, breakfast room, staff room, kitchen servery and ladies toilet. In all there were twelve single and one double bedroom, with five single and one double room used by the licensee and staff. From the 1920s the head lease for the hotel was owned by Tooth and Co. who sub let it to various licensees. From 1936, when the role of the Sydney Harbour Trust was taken over by the newly formed Maritime Service Board, title to the hotel was issued to the MSB, however Tooths continued to lease it until 1950 when the lease was tendered and Tooths did not apply. At that time the licensee, P. K. Armstrong, obtained the lease. In February 1987 title passed from the MSB into private ownership, then in 1994, Palisade Properties Pty Ltd obtained title. It was closed for renovations in 2008 and was closed for seven years. The renovations added a rooftop bar, a new main bar and boutique accommodation. In May 2015, Palisade Properties sold the renovated building to British entrepreneur Richard Sapsford in May 2015 for $17.7 million. It reopened in August 2015, with \\"Henry Deane\\", the rooftop bar, opening that November. Description The hotel is located at 35 Bettington Street and is built to the boundaries of the land. It abuts Bettington Street to the north, the junction of Argyle Place and Dalgety Road to the east, and the Munn Street Reserve to the south. The hotel is a seven- storey masonry building, including basement, five storeys of rooms and a roof- top enclosed bar and terrace. The building has stone and brickwork base courses, load bearing brickwork with stone detailing above, and timber and steel floor and roof framing. Interior walls are either plastered masonry or plastered timber framed construction. Doors and windows are timber framed. The hotel has a cantilevered verandah to its north, south and east sides with a full height metal fire stair attached to the west wall which is partly enclosed by the brick wall. The roof is an open flat area surfaced in synthetic grass set behind a parapet which includes a name plate of the hotel name. The ground floor fa√ßade is tiled with original ceramic tiles and the building retains the original timber framed doors and windows. The side facades feature projecting two storey bays with timber shingles above wide arched windows. A group of narrow arched windows light the staircase. The planning of the hotel varies from floor to floor. The basement has a large central store area to the east with a series of minor rooms to the west. The ground floor is dominated by the bar room to the east, with a hallway, two parlours and a toilet to the west. There is a full height stairway located centrally on the north side. The first floor has two large connected rooms above the bar, a small room created by the enclosure of the eastern verandah, a former toilet, office/bar room and kitchen. Also starting on this level and running up the height of the building are the remnants of a flood lift with an enclosed lobby/alcove on the first, second and third floors. The second and third floors have similar planning comprising six accommodation rooms each with a central section having a stair landing, two bathrooms, linen room, and the remnant flood lift. The east facing rooms each have access to the verandahs on each level. The fourth floor has a number of rooms to the east, two of which open onto an open balcony, the landing for the stair, the floor lift, and small kitchen. At the west end is an open terrace with access to a toilet and enclosed bar, as well as stairs to the fifth floor bar and terrace.

The hotel is significant having been built by the Sydney Harbour Trust in 1915/16 as one of four hotels provided by the Trust to replace those demolished to provide facilities for port workers and the local community. Stylistically the hotel was built in an era of prodigious hotel building between 1900 and 1914, which ended with the onset of World War I. Its ongoing use as a hotel since its construction in 1916 with relatively few modifications to layout and fabric further highlights its significance. Its prominent location and continued use demonstrates its significance as part of the social life of Millers Point. The Palisade Hotel is significant having been designed by H. D. Walsh, an engineer important in the history of NSW especially related to developments around Sydney Harbour in the early twentieth century. The hotel is of aesthetic significance as an exceptional example of a federation free style building with arts and crafts influences. Its dramatic form with a very tall and narrow expression is an important contributory feature to the Millers Point townscape resulting in the building being a prominent landmark feature in the area. Its prominent siting provides terminal views along several streets.  Heritage listing  Palisade Hotel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

He became nationally famous in 1954, when his critique of the revered redologist Yu Pingbo was praised by Mao Zedong, who seized the opportunity to launch a nationwide campaign to criticize the idealism of Yu Pingbo and Hu Shih. Li later served as a long-time editor of the People's Daily and Vice President of the Chinese National Academy of Arts.  Early life and education  Li was born on 11 December 1927 in Tongzhou District, Beijing, with his ancestral home in Shaoxing, Zhejiang. His name was originally written as Li Xifan (), and his courtesy name was Choujiu (). When he was twenty, Li moved to Qingdao, Shandong Province, where he worked as an assistant to his brother-in-law Zhao Jibin (), a professor at Shandong University. Li was later admitted to the university and graduated from its Chinese Department in 1953.  Criticism of Yu Pingbo  Li continued his studies at the graduate school of Renmin University of China, and while a student there, in September 1954 Li and his friend Lan Ling () published a critique of an article about Dream of the Red Chamber written by the revered redologist Yu Pingbo. On October 10, their critique of Yu's book Study of the Dream of the Red Chamber was published in the major national newspaper Guangming Daily, which criticizes the book for lacking \\"scientific analysis\\" and for failing to notice the \\"great anti-feudal trend\\" represented in the classical novel. Li and Lan's critiques caught the attention of Mao Zedong, who seized the opportunity to launch an attack against Yu, and ultimately, the idealism espoused by the liberal scholar Hu Shih. Mao wrote a letter on 16 October 1954 praising the courage of Li and Lan, two \\"nobodies\\", for attacking an established authority. The letter was circulated within China's top leadership, and Chinese media began a national campaign praising \\"nobodies\\" such as Li and Lan while criticizing bourgeois \\"big wigs\\" such as Yu. Mao's praise elevated Li and Lan to national fame, and soon they were transferred to work at the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party of China. However, when Li criticized young author Wang Meng's novel A New Arrival at the Organization Department in 1956, he was himself criticized by Mao and had to issue a self-criticism.  Later career  In 1965, Mao's wife Jiang Qing asked Li to write a political criticism of Wu Han's play Hai Rui Dismissed from Office, and Li declined. The piece was ultimately written by Yao Wenyuan (later one of the \\"Gang of Four\\"), which became an opening shot of the Cultural Revolution. For his non-cooperation, Li was later persecuted and sent to undergo \\"reform through labor\\". While working at the labor camp, he spent his nights writing two books analyzing Lu Xun's works. However, when Jiang Qing was arrested after the end of the Cultural Revolution, Li was sent to labour camp again for his correspondences with her. Li later returned to work at the People's Daily. In 1986, he was invited by Wang Meng, the author he had criticized 30 years earlier who was now China's Minister of Culture, to serve as executive vice president of the Chinese National Academy of Arts. Li expressed gratitude for Wang's magnanimity and served in the position for the next ten years. He also served as the chief editor of two major works, The Great Dictionary of Dream of the Red Chamber () and the monumental 14-volume General History of Chinese Art ().  Personal life  Li was married to Xu Chao (). They had two daughters, Li Meng () and Li Lan (). Li Meng was also a redologist, who was the co-author of Li Xifan's book Commentary on Characters of Dream of the Red Chamber (). Li Xifan's wife died in 2012, and when Li Meng also died three months later, his family hid the news from him for more than three years. Li died at his Beijing home on 29 October 2018, at the age of 90.

Early life and educationMilitary career=World War II= Lownds joined the Marine Corps on 3 March 1942. He was a first lieutenant with Company B, 1st Battalion, 24th Marines during the Battle of Roi-Namur. Lownds was wounded while leading Company B, 1/24 Marines during the Battle of Saipan. During the Battle of Iwo Jima Lownds was attached to Headquarters Company, 1/24 Marines and was again wounded in the battle. Lownds returned to the US following the end of the war, and joined the Marine Reserves on 25 October 1945. =Korean War= Lownds returned to active duty during the Korean War. Lownds was serving with the I Marine Expeditionary Force when they were deployed to the Dominican Republic aboard during Operation Powerpack in April 1965. =Vietnam War= On 12 August 1967, Col. Lownds assumed command of the 26th Marine Regiment which was conducting Operation Ardmore, continued as Operation Scotland, around Khe Sanh Combat Base in northwest Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province. Lownds led the defense of Khe Sanh throughout the Battle of Khe Sanh, ultimately commanding over 6000 Marines at the base. Lownds was criticised by some for failing to send reinforcements to Lang Vei when it came under attack on the night of 6‚Äì7 February 1968, but he defended his decision on the basis that Khe Sanh itself was under artillery attack with a ground assault believed to be imminent and that any attempt to reinforce Lang Vei at night would be suicidal. Lownds' decision was accepted by the US command. Lownds received further criticism when he refused to allow the approximately 6000 Laotian survivors and dependents of the Lang Vei garrison into the base on the basis that it would compromise base security. These refugees were initially housed outside the base perimeter with most eventually seeking refuge further east. President Lyndon B. Johnson attaches the Presidential Unit Citation Streamer to the colors of the 26th Marine Regiment as Lownds looks on Lownds was described by Michael Herr in his book Dispatches as follows: \\"Lownds was a deceptively complicated man with a gift (as one of his staff officers put it) for \\"jerking off the press\\". He could appear as a meek, low-keyed, distracted, and even stupid man (some reporters referred to him privately as \\"The lion of Khe Sanh\\"), as though he had been carefully picked for just these qualities by a cynical command as a front for its decisions... He was a small man with vague, watery eyes, slightly reminiscent of a rodent in a fable, with one striking feature: a full, scrupulously attended regimental moustache... His professed ignorance of Dien Bien Phu drove correspondents crazy, but it was a dodge. Lownds knew very well about Dien Bien Phu and what had happened there, knew more about it than most of the interviewers...The stories published about him never bothered to mention his personal courage or the extreme and special care with which he risked the lives of his men.\\" On 11 April 1968 Lownds was relieved by Col Bruce F. Meyers. On 23 May 1968 President Lyndon B. Johnson presented the Presidential Unit Citation to the 26th Marines in a ceremony at the White House attended by Lownds and the 26th Marines Regimental Sergeant-Major. Lownds was awarded the Navy Cross for his service at Khe Sanh. Later life Lownds died at his home in Naples, Florida, on 31 August 2011.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The \\"Eora people\\" was the name given to the coastal Aboriginal people around Sydney. Central Sydney is therefore often referred to as \\"Eora Country\\". Within the City of Sydney local government area, the traditional owners are the Cadigal and Wangal bands of the Eora. With the invasion of the Sydney region, the Cadigal and Wangal people were decimated but there are descendants still living in Sydney today. The development of the northern areas of Kent Street was stifled for many years due to the natural barrier of the steep rocky outcrop around what was then known as Windmill Hill (later Flagstaff and then Observatory Hill). Kent Street was only an informal track until after the 1830s and much of the district was used as sandstone quarries at this time. The quarries moved to Pyrmont in the late 1830s and Millers Point began to develop as a shipping port. By 1843 Kent Street was a regular thoroughfare, and despite being only partly formed, it encouraged development in Millers Point such as Holy Trinity Church, the Lord Nelson Hotel and some housing. By the 1850s Millers Road had been developed, connecting to Argyle Street and to Clyde and Wentworth Streets leading to Darling Harbour. The area became one of the most closely packed regions of Millers Point. The completion of the Argyle Cut in the mid 1860s was however the main impetus for development to the north of Millers Point. With the completion of Kent and Argyle Streets their intersection became a major node since these were the major routes in and out of the area. The site of the Captain Cook hotel was owned by the Australian Gas Light Company in 1860. A photo dated 1864 by the Freeman Bros shows the site to be vacant and the ground level is somewhat lower than the road indicating some local quarrying. The State Heritage Inventory datasheet notes that there was a small timber cottage on the site in the late 1860s in which a Henry Labat lived in 1868. The buildings were occupied by a Mrs McBride in 1873. This building was replaced by a shop in 1875, adjacent to Alfred Terrace erected in 1869 for George Wigram Allen of Glebe. However a photo dated 1870-71 clearly shows the completed Captain Cook Hotel together with a legible painted sign of the hotel's name. The style of the pub with its overhanging eaves and hipped roofs would appear to predate Allen's 1869 row of terraces, and given that the site was empty and unprepared in 1864, the Captain Cook Hotel must date from 1867. This photo shows the hotel as a couple of two storey terraces at the end of the defined row of terraces that have a distinct character from the hotel. These two end terraces form the basis of the present Captain Cook Hotel and have 2 pane double hung windows, a splayed corner and central common wall, which protrudes from the roof. The corner building had a dormer to the street, which interestingly had a twelve pane Georgian window. The ground floor openings indicate that both buildings were not residences but shops or a public building such as a hotel. The opening on the terrace furthest from the corner stretched across the whole fa√ßade. A slightly later photo dated 1877 by N. J. Caire confirms all the above points and shows the lower section of the building. The building reportedly became known as the Captain Cook Hotel in 1876, but from the above early photo it is clear that it was trading by this name as early as the late 1860s. Percy Dove's Directory Map of 1880 lists the site as the ‚ÄúLiverpool Arms Hotel‚Äù and apportions the name ‚ÄúCaptain Cook Hotel‚Äù to a site on the corner of Clyde Street and Millers Road. Given the photographic evidence it can only be concluded that Dove made an error in the legend and apportioned the wrong number to the Captain Cook Hotel. The other hotel appears in photos up until it was demolished during work to form High Street 1910, and clearly could not also have traded as the Captain Cook with its close neighbour for 40+ years. William Bond became the publican and remained so until 1886-87 when he was replaced by John Craig. A photograph by H. C. Russell (Colonial Astronomer) in 1888 shows that there has been no change to the Captain Cook Hotel at this point. Louisa Leistikow became the licensee in 1888-89 followed by Brigit Corkoran in 1890, Richard Page in 1891, and then a long stint by Alfred Cullen 1892-98. Alfred Bird took over in 1899 and then his relative Sarah would see the hotel through the period of the plague in the Rocks during 1901-02. During this period pubs were the centre of local social activity and provided for a much wider role in the community than simply serving alcohol. Millers Point Hotels were the sites of birthdays, weddings, christenings, wakes and coronial inquests. However the temperance movement was a significant force from the 1870s and the close proximity of genteel residents in Millers Point with the labourers, sailors and wharfies was a source of complaint. The onset of the bubonic plague from 1900 saw the area bounded by the Harbour and Lower Fort, Windmill and Kent Streets resumed by the government causing a major upheaval to the social network of the area. The wharf area became the site of a massive redevelopment of the wharfs and the construction of Hickson Road had a dramatic impact on the area of north Kent Street. Clyde and Wentworth Streets ceased to exist and Millers Road was reduced to a small stub. The land was deeply excavated leaving the site of the Captain Cook at the top of the cliff with only the narrow Argyle Lane separating it from the drop to the new Federation housing built on the newly formed High Street. The hotel itself survived the widespread demolition that occurred in Millers Point at this time. Edward Brown would become the publican in 1903 and would remain until 1916. This period saw a lot of changes for hoteliers. The temperance movement found success in government circles and saw increased restrictions on licenses from around 1905. By 1912 the new Licensing Act had empowered local magistrates with the task of reducing the number of licenses in each electorate. The number of licenses in Millers Point fell from thirteen in 1900 to only six by 1928. Once again however the Captain Cook seems to have survived this period. A photo by Kerry and Co dated 1905-1910, whilst partially obscured by a tree, shows that the upper section of the hotel remains unchanged and there is no parapet on the building as yet. Work is underway on the formation of Argyle Lane behind the terraces. 1916 saw a riot of drunken soldiers in Liverpool that prompted a reactionary response from the Federal Government. From this point until 1955 hotels were required to cease serving alcohol at 6pm, prompting drinkers to guzzle as much as they could by this time in what became known as the ‚Äúsix o'clock swill‚Äù. The policy was counterproductive, not just in the drinker's response, but the pubs would also become less of a community facility and more one associated with drunkenness and socially unacceptable behaviour as a result. Pub architecture responded in the early 20th century by adopting a clean and Modern style that resulted in many original interiors and facades being completely altered. Taft Harvey would take over as publican in 1917, followed by Thomas Brice during 1918-1920. The State Heritage Inventory listing card makes an unreferenced statement that the pub was demolished in 1920 and reconstructed by the Sydney Harbour Trust. There appears to be no evidence for this and much evidence against. It is possible that modifications were made to the pub at this point, as the new Licensing Act would have required substantial upgrading of the building. Alfred Hayes would be publican through 1921-1929 and Patrick Hastings would fill out the available owners‚Äô list from 1930-32. A photo of the building in 1940 shows that by this time substantial alterations had been carried out. The roof form remains intact but the dormer is gone and the building now has a new parapet to King Street. The fa√ßade has new rendering that has treated the two adjoined buildings as one fa√ßade. The large openings on the ground floor have been filled in and reduced to small doorways, and this work appears to be in progress as the brickwork is yet to be rendered. There are additions seemingly in progress at the rear. The photo makes it clear that the building is still based on the 1875 pair of terraces and has not been demolished. Reworking old pubs was a common practice after the Great Depression and it appears that this was also the case for the Captain Cook. For some reason the external ground floor walls were not tiled, as was the common practice. The Captain Cook was a favourite of members of the Waterside Workers Federation in the latter half of the twentieth century. In 1986 the remaining stub of Millers Road was renamed High Lane and a section of the site was resumed for road widening in 1991. Crumar Pty Ltd took over the license in 1999. Current photos of the building show that the original 1867 large openings on the ground floor have been reconstructed, possibly from investigation of the fabric. The upper level windows remain in their original 1867 openings and the parapet is the same as shown in the 1940 photo. The rear extensions are much larger than shown in 1940. The roof appears to remain as an original element.  Description  The Captain Cook Hotel began its existence as two two-storey terraces joined with a common parapet wall. They were attached at the end of a run of 1869 terraces. The hotel was distinct in style from these terraces built with a more old fashioned eaves line instead of a parapet. The exterior featured two simple windows on the upper level of each terrace with projecting sills, although even the earliest photos show two paned double hung windows. One of the windows is shown as a blind window. The terrace nearest the corner was splayed, and had a large shopfront to Kent Street with a single door adjacent. It also featured a dormer with a twelve- pane Georgian window. The other terrace had a very bold line at the upper floor level (a string course?) with a small awning over wide central doors. These openings have been recently reconstructed after being blocked up in 1940. The basement may date from the very beginnings of the hotel and may have some interesting construction techniques. 1940 modifications included the introduction of a parapet to Kent Street and an external decorative composition of rendered string lines and dentilling that tied the two terraces into what appears as a single building, removing the projecting sills. The changes retained the upper level openings but made significant changes to the ground floor openings, reducing them to single doors. This period also saw the first extensions to the west in a similarly stripped rendered form of simple window openings. These extensions have been added to recently and the building now has a three-storey wing to the west of the original building. A cantilevered awning was added . The fitout of the building has been altered numerous times. The building has retained the original facade but has been extensively modified internally. This is to be expected on the ground floor. It is not clear if this extends to the upper floor. The original stair has been removed and replaced. The building has extensive additions to the west. The interior has been modified as part of these additions. A semi-circular stair in the bar has been identified as intrusive. = Modifications and dates = * ‚Äì possible alterations to meet new licensing laws, most likely focused on the ground floor bar; * ‚Äì ground floor openings bricked up, parapet built, exterior rendered, single storey addition to west, cantilevered awning; * late 20th century ‚Äì further additions to west, modification of interiors; * early 21st century ‚Äì refurbishment including reconstruction of original ground floor openings.  Heritage listing  The Captain Cook Hotel, a two-storey rendered brick building in a subdued version of the Federation Free Style, is situated on a corner towards the northern end of Kent Street. While the Captain Cook Hotel is one of the eleven hotel buildings in this style remaining in the city, it is possibly the least significant. The others are Moreton's Hotel and the Palisade Hotel which hold the most significance, the Sir John Young, the Australian Hotels in Cumberland and Gloucester Streets, the Observer Hotel, the Napoleon, the Royal George, the Fosters, and the Read Raters Hotel. The site has historic significance as part of the Australian Gas Light Company and for its long continued association with the hotel trade since 1876. The building has social significance for the part it played in providing a social / recreational venue and budget accommodation in the immediate area and this significance is continued with its expanded services. It is an example of the evolution of the small scale corner hotel on the fringes of the city, and reflects the social character of the area during the early years of the 20th century. It is representative of the style used in a small corner hotel. Captain Cook Hotel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

It was designed by Michael Lehane and built in the late 1830s. It is the oldest working licensed hotel in Sydney. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Millers Point was originally named by Europeans as Cockle Bay Point, but was renamed Miller's Point after an ex-convict, John \\"Jack the Miller\\" Leighton. The area at the north end of Kent Street and the western end of Windmill Street was known as \\"The Quarries\\" and supplied a large part of the early stone for Sydney. The land on which the hotel is situated was part of two Crown Grants: to plasterer Wells dated 14 May 1836 and (in trust) to Richard Drier dated 30 November 1840. A census of 1834 however, indicates that there were three William Wells living in Kent and Argyle Streets during the 1830s. The Lord Nelson was constructed during the late 1830s by William Wells. Records indicate that Wells may have been a plasterer by trade, however this cannot be confirmed by contemporaneous directories. The architect was Michael Lehane. Wells is believed to have lived on the opposite corner to the Sailor's Return in the present day Lord Nelson until 1842 when the liquor licence for the hotel was granted. The sandstone blocks are believed to have been quarried from the area at the base of Observatory Hill. The Lord Nelson is the oldest working licensed hotel in Sydney, dating from the time of licence in June 1842. Sands Directories dating back to 1858 indicate that the Lord Nelson Hotel was occupied on and off by Charles J Sounders between the years 1860 and 1866. In 1867 it appears that the property was repurchased by William Wells, who had occupied the building from the time of its construction until 1858. He remained in the building until 1870 before John Henwood and Alfred C. Wells, possibly a son or relative of William took over. In the following years leading up to the turn of the century, the building was occupied by numerous people. Most notable for their lengthy occupation were Robert Drysdale, John H. Ferguson, William Adams and Patrick Powell. The property was transferred to the Sydney Storage Company in 1891 and part of it was leased back to Patrick Powell in 1893. A further lease took place in 1900, by the Sydney Storage Company to L. H. G. Oswald. The Oswalds were to construct the Oswald Bond Stores on either side of the building. The property was resumed by the Minister for Public Works in 1901 and vested in the Sydney Harbour Trust Commissioners in 1911 There were numerous proprietors of the hotel after the turn of the century, particularly during the period from 1901 to 1911. From 1911 to 1917 Michael Lehane occupied the building, followed by Terence O'Brien from 1918 to 1928. On March 15, 1922 approval was given for further alterations to the building. The name of the architect of these modifications cannot be ascertained. It is possible, however, that the work included a remodelling of the second floor accommodation spaces. In 1931 Tooth and Co. Ltd who were leasing the hotel, reported considerable losses in trade due to the high rent payable to the Sydney Harbour Trust. The General Manager of Tooth and Co. wrote to the Solicitor for the Sydney Harbour Trust Commissioners stating that for the last 12 months trade had been continuing to decline. As a result, the terms of the lease were renegotiated. In 1932 the premises were inspected by the District Licensing Inspector Edward G. Allen. The following alterations were required to bring the premises up to the requirements of the Liquor Act No.42 of 1912; kitchen and dining room to be made fly proof, floor covering to be replaced in some rooms, electric lights to be repaired to working order and maintained and certain beds and blinds to be replaced. In 1936 the property had been registered in the name of the Maritime Services Board of New South Wales. The property consisted of Allotment 15, Section 92 of the City of Sydney, Parish of St. Phillip, County of Cumberland. In October 1937 the District Licensing Inspector, Mr Sharples specified that extensive remodelling of the interior be carried out on the building to bring it into compliance with the Liquor Act of 1912. On March 11, 1938 alterations were undertaken, designed by Copeman, Lemont and Keesing architects. The MSB authorised the alterations and granted Tooth and Co. Ltd a twenty-year lease of the premises from the date of completion of the remodelling. In August 1938 bulk and bottled beer refrigeration equipment was installed. Later in 1947, the refrigeration system was to be replaced, and again in 1956. In 1941 part of the cellar was partitioned off to form a spirit room. The architect was Mr Dalziel. In 1955 and 1956 work was required to the interior, exterior and services to achieve a reasonable state of repair prior to transfer of Licence between Mr Pearce and Mr Crannery. This work involved general repairs to internal and external surfaces and repairs to services, as recommended by Richard Simpson, architect. In January 1957 the issue of the creation of a Saloon Bar partition was again raised. It appears that no such partition was constructed. In August of this year the keg slide was constructed fronting Kent Street. In August 1958 the architect Ian Smalpage prepared a Schedule of Painting and Repairs to make good defects due to fair wear and tear on interiors, exteriors and services at the Lord Nelson Hotel for Tooth and Co Ltd. In 1963 the MSB leased the property to Percy Cheers for five years. This lease took place after the MSB submitted the property to public tender. From the late 1960s to the early 1980s the Hotel was leased to a number of people. In the early 1980s alterations to the value of $100,000 were conducted by the MSB overseen by Mackay and Taylor. These works most probably involved the restoration of the external facades of the building and could have included the removal of external tiling and render and suspended metal awning. In 1986 a Development Application for the Hotel was prepared by architect Saxon Rudduck of Adelaide. The application was approved by Council and involved the incorporation of the brewery into the hotel on both the basement and ground floors. Other work included the creation of several openings in the walls of the first floor, to provide a large open plan area for the restaurant. The bar was incorporated into the brasserie the following year. At this time the timber framed roof over the rear deck and service stair was also constructed. On 1 July 1988 the lue from the ground floor fireplace caused a fire in the building which affected part of the second floor accommodation area. One room was severely damaged, while others were affected by pollution and heat. In 1990 a new exhaust flue was installed in the kitchen. In the 1990s the Hotel was voted \\"Best Pub\\" by Great Pubs of Sydney, Best Tourist Hotel by the Australian Hotels Association, and Best Pub by the Australian Weekend Magazine.Graham Brooks and Associates 1997: 5-29  Description  The Lord Nelson Hotel is a smooth faced, three storey sandstone building in the Old Colonial Regency style. The building has a hipped, corrugated asbestos cement roof, following the \\"L-shaped\\" form of the building. The roof cladding is not original and is partially concealed by a decorative parapet and moulded capping, which extends around both facades along the full length of the building. The building has a splay corner, featuring a central arched doorway with paired timber doors and a fanlight at ground level. A second such arched doorway is situated near the centre of Argyle Street facade. A third door with a flat arch is located in the northern end of the eastern facade. The street facades on the first and second levels feature regular, multi-paned timber double hung windows. The ground level facades to both Kent and Argyle Streets contain a large, fixed, timber paned window on either side of the splayed corner respectively. The Argyle Street elevation also contains two timber framed sash windows similar to those on the upper levels. The Kent Street elevation contains one such window as well as a deeply recessed set of three tall, narrow, fixed windows. All window openings feature simple, projecting sandstone sills. A rendered string course at ground level on the Argyle Street facade is continued along the Kent Street facade, below which the sandstone wall has been rendered and painted. A \\"kegslide\\" is located in the rendered area of the eastern facade. This is a service hatch allowing beer kegs to be directly loaded from the street to the basement and vice versa. Internally the building contains five storeys, including a basement level, ground, first and second levels and an attic. The ground floor largely comprises the public bar. The first floor can be described as having two distinct \\"halves\\". The southern half of the floor comprises the restaurant seating area, extending from the western wall through to the eastern. The north eastern section, comprising part of the original \\"L-shaped\\" plan contains the main stair, a small store and male and female w/cs. The north western infill section contains the galley kitchen and bar, opening to the restaurant, and a sheltered deck area/landing area leading to the service stair. The second floor contains eight rooms, two bathrooms, two storerooms, a single w/c and a small kitchenette. The attic space is an open \\"L-shaped\\" plan with timber floor and many exposed rafters.Graham Brooks and Associates 1997: 39-57 = Modifications and dates = * - hotel built. * 1842-1845 - possible extensions to the north and west. * 1922 - remodelling of second floor accommodation. * 1930s - kitchen and WC. * 1938 - ground floor bar altered, new internal stairs and remodelling of second floor accommodation. * 1957 - keg slide constructed. * 1960 - ground floor bar altered. * 1980s - general exterior fully restored. * 1986 - brewery incorporated into hotel. * 1987 - deck and service stair enclosed, first floor bar installed. * 1988 - fire due to flue causes damage.  Heritage listing  The Lord Nelson Hotel is highly significant as the oldest working licensed hotel in the city. The Hotel was only one of only two hotels in the immediate area to be retained by the Sydney Harbour Trust when Millers Point was resumed during the time of the plague in 1900. The Lord Nelson Hotel is also significant as one of three hotel buildings in the Old Colonial Regency style in the city. The other two include the Hero of Waterloo Hotel and a commercial terrace at 246 George Street. The Lord Nelson is the finest example of the three. It is also significant as it provides a strong contribution to the urban character of the immediate area. The building provides a rare surviving working example of an early hotel from the nineteenth century. It also has significance as part of a network of corner hotels in the northern end of the city which provided social and recreational venues and budget accommodation. The site may have scientific significance due to the age of the building and its continual use since the early days of European settlement.Graham Brooks and Associates 1997:64 Lord Nelson Hotel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Lord Nelson Hotel is historically significant as part of the network of corner hotels constructed in Millers Point and the Rocks in the nineteenth century. The building predates most of the hotels in the area and is one of the few which was not demolished in the aftermath of the plague at the turn of the century. The Lord nelson is the earliest surviving, continuously trading hotel in Sydney.Graham Brooks and Associates 1997: 63 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Lord Nelson Hotel is aesthetically significant as a largely externally intact example of the Old Colonial Regency style, used as a corner hotel. The building also provides a strong contribution to the character of the immediate area. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Lord Nelson Hotel is socially significant as part of the network of corner hotels which provided social/recreational venues and budget accommodation in the northern end of the city. It is also significant for its long term associations with the hotel trade. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Lord Nelson Hotel has significance as a possible site for scientific investigation due to the age of the building and the continual use of the site from early years of European occupation.Graham Brooks and Associates 1997: 64 The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The building is highly significant as a rare surviving example of the Old Colonial Regency style. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The building is representative of the prominent corner hotels which held an important place in the social structure of the city, and particularly in the Millers Point and waterfront area.

Zionism was the movement for the attainment of freedom for the Jewish people through the establishment of a Jewish state. Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy was popular among Jewish intellectuals, incorporated into Zionism effortlessly. Friedrich Nietzsche's influence was exigent on moving away from the Jewish past into an empowering future for the Hebraic New Man, the adoption of his ideas necessitating the Jews to surpass the antiquarian Jewish identity that had a rabbinical consciousness at its center. The philosopher's influence on the Zionists can then be thought of as an existential revolution‚Äìthat is, it focused on the renewal of the Jewish identity, the adoption of aesthetic values, and enhancing the will for life. Hence, the Zionists did not want to reconcile Friedrich Nietzsche with Zionism; but instead, his texts played a vital role in understanding and embracing the Jewish experience. The Zionist revolution emphasized that ‚Äúthe new Jews,\\" the concept of which was similar to Nietzsche's ‚Äúnew European man,‚Äù should choose to go to Zion or to stay in Europe. More importantly, Theodor Herzl, ‚Äúthe author and the vision of the Jewish State,‚Äù viewed Zionism as the arrival of an authentic image of the Jew in a state without the idea of God or any dogmatization, exhibiting a very similar format to that of Nietzsche's libertarianism or anti-dogmatism.  Figures = Theodor Herzl = Zionist Leader Theodor Herzl Theodor Herzl, founder and president of the Zionist Organization, which helped establish a Jewish state, felt ambivalent about Friedrich Nietzsche's ideology. It is stated that Herzl called Nietzsche a madman. Herzl did not think that he could follow the ideology of a philosopher who was neither physically nor mentally stable. David Ben-Gurion, under a portrait of Theodor Herzl, is proclaiming Israel's independence Although it is controversial if Herzl disliked Nietzsche's ideology, as several of the philosopher's texts were found in the Zionist leader's library, Herzl's idea of the ‚Äúnew Jew‚Äù was profoundly similar to that of Nietzsche's ‚Äúnew European man‚Äù or √úbermensch. The character Jacob Samuel from Herzl's play Das Neue Ghetto resembles Zarathustra from Nietzsche's philosophical novel Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Jacob's ideals surpass those of the herd mentality. He is proud and demonstrates no resentment, seeks to implement no values and morals, and is on a journey of overcoming his old self‚ÄìZarathustra had already displayed his ideals. In Der Judenstaat, Herzl states, ‚ÄúIf I wish to substitute a new building for an old one, I must demolish before I construct.‚Äù Nietzsche originally in On The Genealogy of Morals states, ‚ÄúIf a temple is to be erected, a temple must be destroyed.‚Äù Hence, Nietzsche's ideology on a journey toward authenticity may have heavily influenced Herzl in both his novels and personal life. Herzl refers to Plato, Arthur Schopenhauer, Immanuel Kant, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Aristotle, Ludwig Feuerbach, Franz Brentano, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling in his Jugendtagebuch. Also, in his diary he quotes several Enlightenment philosophers such as Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant. Nietzsche was not mentioned in either case. Also, Nietzsche's ‚ÄúEuropean man‚Äù could not be generalized to the situation of the Jews in Europe. Since the Jewish population was unable to assimilate and prosper in Europe, Herzl then believed that the Jew could reach authenticity elsewhere‚Äìin Zion. If so, his ideology does not align with Nietzsche's ‚ÄúEuropean man‚Äù, as Nietzsche's purpose is to surpass values and morals, not to move elsewhere to find authenticity. Even though Nietzsche may have influenced Herzl's ideals, he may have been a temporary scaffold into creating the image of genuine authenticity. = Buber = Professor Martin Buber Martin Buber, who is claimed to be responsible for incorporating Friedrich Nietzsche into German Zionism, thought that Nietzsche portrayed the role of an individual able to create and go beyond himself. This he believed to be necessary for the Jewish renaissance. The two thousand years of the Jewish diaspora, Buber maintained, transformed physical energy into spiritual energy within the Jews. The essential drive of the Jewish renaissance was to release the spiritual energy‚Äìsomething that Nietzsche wrote extensively on, believing that conserving the spirit internalizes one's instincts which are then turned against oneself. Nietzsche thought the correct action to take after de- spiritualization is to advance one's aesthetic drive. This, in turn, was a consequence of the Jewish renaissance. In relation to Buber, he created an exhibition of contemporary Jewish art. Buber's vision emphasized the notion of reconciling the Jewish people to a life of creativeness, happiness, and healthiness. These values that Buber believed in may have been influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche's aesthetic work The Birth of Tragedy. Buber was well aware that Nietzsche used the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer to mold his authentic self; likewise, Buber used Nietzsche for the same reason. Buber, after reaching and understanding the personal authenticity that Nietzsche extensively emphasized, jettisoned the philosopher from his life, as Buber believed that for one to grow truly fond of Nietzsche one must desert him. = Chaim Weizmann = Israel's First President Chaim Weizmann Chaim Weizmann, leader of the Zionist movement and future first president of the State of Israel, was influenced by the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche, believing that the Jews lacked power and seeing in Zionism a phenomenon that would steer the Jews toward power and freeing themselves. Whether Weizmann's intention was conscious or not, his ideas relate to Nietzsche's idea of √úbermensch. Although he believed that the Jews contained sufficient intellect to understand and incorporate the writings of Nietzsche into their lives, Weizmann believed this could not be done by all people. = Max Nordau = Portrait of Max Nordau Max Nordau, cofounder of the Zionist Organization, was uncertain about Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy. Nietzsche received his first detailed critique from Nordau himself, although most of the arguments were against Nietzsche's character and not so much against his ideology. His critique against Friedrich Nietzsche focused much on the philosopher's mental health, since Nietzsche suffered from syphilis. Nietzsche's followers were also critiqued by Nordau. He believed that they were ‚Äúimbecile criminals‚Äù and a group of ‚Äúsimpletons.‚Äù Lastly, Nordau found it unfortunate that the ‚Äúmanic‚Äù German philosopher was even considered a philosopher in the first place. Nordau, unlike Nietzsche, esteemed the values of the Enlightenment, whereas Nietzsche wanted to reevaluate values that the Enlightenment did not have in its agenda. Much of Nordau's ideas resembled ideas from Nietzsche's text, namely the enrichment and expansion of European culture. Over time, Max Nordau began to self reflect on his inauthentic Jewish marginality. He later dropped his Enlightenment ideals since they clashed with those of Zionism, as Zionism was a particularist movement, while The Enlightenment was a universal one. His inauthentic Jewish marginality would then become an authentic one when taking up Zionist thinking. Due to Nietzsche's ideals being synonymous with Zionism, Nietzsche now became more relevant in Nordau's life. As his life progressed, he became closer to Nietzsche's ideology and was even influenced by Nietzsche's essay on history, as were many Zionists.

The Shaar Shalom Synagogue was among the first Canadian Conservative synagogues to hire women in clergy positions and welcome same-sex partners as members. History It was founded in 1953 by a collective of families who were members of Halifax's Baron de Hirsch Synagogue who sought a community that would permit \\"family seating\\" (also known as mixed seating or the opportunity for men and women to sit together). They sought an egalitarian ideology that would permit women's political and ritual leadership. The community has had professional leaders over the years, including Dr. Irving Perlin. Perlin was an obstetrician who served as a lay hazzan and mohel, and presided over weekly sabbath liturgies and ceremonial circumcisions. The synagogue hosted groups such as a Catholic Women's League chapter and was a supporter of Camp Kadimah. Many of the art pieces still decorating the synagogue were procured during David Jacobs' tenure from 1953-1957.

In June of 1787, Carleton launched his career in lecturing, and by August 1, 1787 the Boston Board of Selectmen approved his application to open a school, teaching surveying, gauging, mensuration, algebra, geometry, geography, astronomy, dialling, navigation, gunnery, architecture. An advertisement for his school can be found in the Peter Short 1791 ciphering book found in the Phillips Library at the Peabody Essex Museum (PEM). A surviving example of one of his teaching texts can be found at the Boston Athenaeum, Compendium of Practical Arithmetic. He then went on to become a key cartographer in the early mapping of Maine. Carleton persuaded the Commonwealth to make a requirement that every town should make a detailed plan and he used these to create maps for Massachusetts and Maine.

It was designed by NSW Government Architect's Office under Walter Liberty Vernon. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 June 2000.  History  The first post office for Millers Point opened in 1878 in Argyle Street. The lease on this building was extended in 1887, however it was considered too small and not in a convenient location. In August 1887 the office was relocated to 83 George Street North. By 1891 considerable pressure from the Millers Point community saw plans for the erection of a post office on the corner of Kent and Argyle Street. The chosen site was occupied by a watchhouse for the Police Department which was removed in June 1891, and a new residence built for Sub Inspector Mitchell, Officer in Charge, Number Four Division, on the same site. However, it became evident that the location of this building was not quiet enough for a residence. Subsequently, it was agreed that the existing building could be utilised for the post office, on the condition that the post office built a suitable building in a quieter location for the Sub-Inspector. On 31 December 1900 this building was opened as the new Millers Point Post Office, and remained so until the 1990s. The prominent corner location of this building ensured that the post office was situated in a much more convenient site for the local community. In the late 1990s, the use of the building changed with the post office services only occupying the front corner of the ground floor. The remainder of the building was leased out as office space.Andrew Ward & Associates and Clive Lucas Stapleton and Associates, 2000 An office tenant during this period was prominent lobbying firm Hawker Britton, which based its Sydney office in the building from 1999 to 2002. The post office continued in a much reduced capacity until 2009, when the licensee was arrested in a high- profile fraud case, following which it was closed entirely. In 2017, a development application was lodged with the City of Sydney seeking to change the use of the building from a mix of commercial office and residential use to only residential.  Description  Millers Point Post Office is a simply detailed, square, two-storey Victorian reddish-pink Flemish and stretcher bond brick building in the Federation Free Classical Style. It has a single-storey, early brick outbuilding to the east, separated by a courtyard. The main building has a rendered and cream painted coping to a convoluted parapet that flattens out to the rear of the building, behind which is a hipped corrugated sheet metal roof with two corbelled brick chimneys and louvred dormer window to the east. There is a round arched entry porch to Kent Street and painted stone steps, with stained glass fanlight and sidelights to the original timber door set back into the fa√ßade. The entry is flanked by a pair of shallow arched sash windows (upper sash nine pane, lower one pane) with sandstone sills. The windows located above each at the ground floor have six upper panes and one lower, the oculus retaining six panes of ripple glass.Andrew Ward & Associates and Clive Lucas Stapleton and Associates, 2000 = Modifications and dates = Some evidence exists of modifications to the Kent Street facade and timber boarded arched doorway. The ground floor stair hall shows evidence of an infilled door to the northern wall, with a break in the painted-over dado, possibly from the time the Post Office and commercial office tenancies separated, date unknown. The installation of a storeroom beneath the stair, with the fibre cement infill to the north of the stair at ground floor, possibly occurred at around the same time. Removal of central wall fabric to the Post Office area (northern half - ground floor) probably occurred for the Post Office tenancy, but possibly earlier to create a larger room. Modern fitout and possibly infill of fireplaces to the Post Office area (northern half ground floor) mid-1990s. Weatherboard and fibre cement sheet addition to the northern end of the outbuilding and later brick infill with installation of a later window to the western wall of the brick outbuilding, dates unknown. Modern bathroom fitout to the upper floor, causing moisture damage to the architraves of the oculus, date of installation unknown, -70s. Ducting for services has also been constructed in the hallway behind the bathroom, date unknown.

The PAVN claim that the Division's 407th Sapper Battalion attacked Camp Radcliff \\"eliminating 520 enemy troops and destroying 97 aircraft\\" while the Division artillery shelled a headquarters in B·ªìng S∆°n \\"killing many enemy soldiers and destroying 10 aircraft.\\" The Division's 22nd Regiment was the target of Operation Davy Crockett from 1 to 16 May 1966, losing 345 killed. The Division's 2nd Regiment was the target of Operation Crazy Horse from 16 May to 5 June 1966, losing 478 killed. The Division and local VC units in B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province were the target of Operation Thayer from 13 September 1966 to 12 February 1967, with a US body count of 2669 killed. By April 1967 US intelligence assessed the Division as being combat ineffective with prisoners reporting low morale, lack of food and medical supplies and lack of confidence in their leadership. The Division retreated from B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province and its commander, Col Le Truc was replaced by Col Vo Thu. The Division was the target of Operation Pershing from September 1967 to January 1968. From 6-11 December 1967 the Division's 22nd Regiment was defeated in the Battle of Tam Quan, losing 650 killed and 31 captured. On 23 January 1968 as the 2nd Regiment moved into a staging area several kilometers east of Ph√π M·ªπ District in preparation for its Tet Offensive attacks, it was engaged by 2 Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) mechanized companies, losing 142 soldiers from the regiment‚Äôs 95th and 97th Battalions. The 2nd Regiment attacked Ph√π M·ªπ on the night of 30/1 January but were driven back and then both the 2nd and 22nd Regiments attempted further attacks before withdrawing on 6 February after losing a further 200 killed. In an attack on An Nh∆°n District on 6 February, the 8th Battalion, 18th Regiment was repulsed losing 41 killed. From 1-30 March 1968 the Division was the target of Operation Patrick. In the Battle of An Bao from 5-6 May 1968 the Division's 2nd and 22nd Regiments ambushed the US 1st Battalion, 50th Infantry Regiment (Mechanized), losing 117 killed. In June 1968 one or more regiments of the Division moved north into Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province. During the Phase III Offensive the Division's 1st Regiment was sent to attack Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i, but were intercepted by US forces and after 4 days of fighting the 1st Regiment withdrew west to its mountain bases leaving 567 dead. In early 1972 the Division comprised the 2nd, 12th and 21st Regiments. On 18 April 1972 during the Easter Offensive the Division's 2nd and 21st Regiments attacked the ARVN 40th Regiment, 22nd Division and captured Ho√†i √Çn District and Ho√†i Nh∆°n and later engaged the ARVN 41st Regiment, 2nd Division. During the War of the flags in January/February 1973, two battalions of the Division's 12th Regiment supported the 2nd Division capture of Sa Hu·ª≥nh Base, while the rest of the Division attacked government outposts and attempted to prevent the deployment of the ARVN 22nd Division. By the end of the first week of February, the ARVN had reverted all PAVN gains. During the 1975 Spring Offensive the Division was tasked with cutting Route 19 east of the An Kh√™ Pass to isolate the Central Highlands. After the fall of Ban Me Thuot the Division was ordered on 26 March to move east to the coast to attack the ARVN 22nd Division, however this attack was repulsed by the 42nd Regiment, 22nd Division. The Division then moved units around the 41st and 42nd Regiments by 31 March and the ARVN units disintegrated. On 4 April the Division joined the Coastal Column comprising the Division, 5th Armored Battalion and 2nd Corps which was tasked with moving down Highway 1 to overrun South Vietnamese positions and clear this logistics route. By 14 April the Division was engaging ARVN units defending the approaches to Phan Rang and by 16 April they had captured the city and its air base. On 26 April the Division split from the Coastal Column and attacked towards V≈©ng T√†u, with the 12th Regiment attacking south along Route 2, while the 141st Regiment supported by tanks attacked B√† R·ªãa. The initial assault on B√† R·ªãa was repulsed by ARVN Airborne when the tanks attacked without infantry support, however by 27 April the Division had captured B√† R·ªãa and the Airborne retreated across the Song Co May river. The Division resumed its assault at midnight on 28 April but was held up by a strong defense by the Airborne across the Song Co May. The Division's 12th Regiment was then landed by fishing boats behind the Airborne lines and this, together with a renewed attack by the 2nd Regiment, forced the Airborne to retreat into V≈©ng T√†u. At 01:30 on 30 April the Division began its attack on V≈©ng T√†u forcing the Airborne into the city center where they eventually succumbed at 11:00.

Observance The practice of pangangaluwa is folk tradition where people visit houses at night to sing songs related to All Saints' Day, and All Souls' Day to solicit for gifts. The practice is more common in the rural areas and is often done by children or teenagers. According to the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), the practice is usually done on October 31, the day before the \\"Day of the Dead\\" (Araw ng mga Patay), also known as All Saints' Day. As per tradition, participants of pangangaluwa solicits people in front of their houses similar to what is done in harana and karoling and sings songs pretending to be lost souls in purgatory. Visited homes are expected to give kakanin or something else which the \\"lost souls\\" could bring back to the world of the dead. The NCCA also describes a superstition associated with pangangaluwa. According to tradition, the door which connects the world of the living and dead opens during All Saints Day which causes the souls who died on November 1 to return to the world of the living. Kakanin or various sticky rice cakes as well as food products made from sweet potato and purple yam is usually prepared as a tribute to the souls who are said to be hungry for food and attention. The NCCA has cited pangagaluwa as one of the evidence of Filipino belief in the afterlife as well as the existence of relations between the living and the souls of the dead. =In Sariaya, Quezon= In the town of Sariaya, Quezon, pangangaluwa is often observed from October 27 to 28. A dying tradition in the town, the tradition was revived by the local tourism council in 2005 as an annual fundraising for the local government's belen festival in December and the development of the local tourism in general. It was usually held on November 1 according to an account of a resident senior citizen born in 1920, after families have returned to their houses from their cemetery visits.

The master franchise is held by the Golden Arches Development Corporation, a subsidiary of Alliance Global Group. History A McDonald's outlet in Malate, Manila. =Negotiations= McDonald's was introduced in the Philippines by Chinese- Filipino businessman George Yang, who resided in the United States in the 1970s, though never patronized a McDonald's outlet during his stay. Aware of the fast food chain's success in North America and its increasing presence in other parts of the world, Yang researched fast-food business operations; in 1974, he contacted McDonald's headquarters in Illinois regarding a proposal for rights to open outlets in the Philippines. Yang's proposals were initially ignored, though he continued to remind the company regarding his business interest. In 1976, representatives of McDonald's International sent a delegation to the Philippines to conduct a feasibility study on establishing presence in the Philippine market. McDonald's International was also considering partnering with other local firms in establishing presence in the Philippines' other than Yang. Yang sold himself as a \\"long term partner\\" and volunteered to work in the then-British colony of Hong Kong where he networked with the business associate of the holder of the master franchise in the city and worked with uniformed crew at an outlet in Kowloon. In 1980, McDonald's decided to award the master franchise to Yang and, shortly thereafter, set up the first Filipino McDonald's outlet within the University Belt area in Manila the following year. =Entry and expansion= McDonald's entered the Philippine market in 1981 with McDonald's International partnering with McGeorge Food Industries of Filipino of Yang due to prohibition of majority foreign ownership in the country. This gave Yang's firm exclusive rights to manage operations of McDonald's in the Philippines. By the 1990s, there were already 375 McDonald's outlets in the Philippines, with around 150 operated as local franchises. In the mid-1980s, multinational fast food chains based abroad with presence in the Philippines began to introduce food items meant for the local market. During this time, McDonald's Philippines began to introduce meals served with steam rice, spaghetti and chicken. In 1992, McDonald's expanded its reach to Visayas and Mindanao with the opening of non- Luzon outlets in Cebu City and Cagayan de Oro, respectively. Products Chicken Fillet Ala King served with fries, cola and steamed rice. McDonald's Philippines maintains a menu catered towards the Filipino market.

He was a political activists banished under the Native Administration Act of the South African Apartheid government. Political activity Gwentshe first attended ANC meetings in 1948 at towns on the Eastern Cape that resulted in his being placed under watch by the security police. Documentation by the security police led to his banishment. Gwentshe noted at a meeting in Queenstown, ‚ÄòI appeal to the African as individuals, teachers, preachers, policeman and the C.I.D to prepare for the struggle in the near future. I also appeal to these present to defy the laws, i.e. Pass Laws, and if arrested, not pay their fines.‚Äô Gwentshe played a significant role in the establishment of the African National Congress Youth League in East London in 1949. He also organised the East London ‚Äòstay-at- home‚Äô of 26 June 1950 as well as the 1952 Defiance Campaign. He was the chairperson of the ANC in East London and also the president of the Cape ANC Youth League. He was a powerful and charismatic leader, making East London one of the most prominent centers of protest during the Defiance Campaign. Gwentshe secured permission for a ‚Äòprayer meeting‚Äô under the Suppression of Communism Act and Riotous Assemblies Act for just over 50 Eastern Cape leaders. The meeting was scheduled for November 9, 1952 where leaders were to discuss the Port Elizabeth and Kimberly riots. The police discovered that the meeting was not of a religious nature and ordered the dispersion of 1500 in attendance. The police opened fire with stun grenades, revolvers and rifles when the crowds did not disperse. Nine people were killed including two white police officials. Numerous buildings, buses and churches were burnt. Numerous arrests and two hangings resulted from this incident. After the riots, police raided the ‚Äòlocations‚Äô, segregated urban areas for black people, to check that people had their pass books. As a result, hundreds of women and children fled East London to the rural reserves as they were living there illegally. After Gwentshe's ‚Äòprayer meeting‚Äô, he was banned under the Suppression of Communism Act from attending meetings of any sort for six months. He was found guilty of violating the banning order on March 26, 1953 and sentenced to nine years imprisonment. After his release, he attended a Liberal Party meeting in February, 1954 where he advocated that black people have direct positions on the municipal bodies. The East London municipality then urged the government to banish Gwentshe. He was banished from the Duncan village in the Red Location (township), to Maviljan Farm in Pilgrims Rest in the Eastern Transvaal. Gwentshe and Joel Lengesi became the first people banished from East London in 1954.Saleem Badat. The Forgotten People: Political Banishment under Apartheid.BRILL, 30 Jan 2013. Pages 160-163 Upon arrival in Pilgrims Rest, Gwentshe declined offered employment job. The government believed that he was being visited by and receiving financial support from the ANC. Because his home was in an urban area, the government decided to move him to a rural area to have better monitor his actions. In April 1955, he was banished to the Native Trust Farm Frenchdale, located in what is now known as Mafikeng, in the North West province. In 1956, he was arrested in Mafikeng for disobeying the order of the Governor-General to remain on the farm Frenchdale as he was alleged to be living in Mafikeng location. He was released on bail of ¬£25 and with representation by lawyer Joe Slovo, he was found not guilty of contravening his banishment order. In August 1956, Can Themba, writer and editor of ‚ÄòDrum‚Äô magazine, released an expos√© on the Frenchdale ‚Äòconcentration camp,‚Äô titled ‚ÄòBanned to the bush.‚Äô The expos√© focused extensively on Gwentshe. In 1957, he was permitted to return to his home village, Tsomo, in the Transkei, now Eastern Cape province. His banishment order was revoked in June 1960. The withdrawal document of his banishment was written in Afrikaans, bearing the signatures of then president CR Swart, Prime Minister HF Verwoerd, and Minister MDC de Wet Nel. The document noted that despite accusations of misconduct, no evidence was found. The Police Commissioner did not object to his return. Gwentshe died on the 27th of October 1966 of unknown causes in the Eastern Cape. Documentation by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission noted that family members believed Gwentshe was poisoned by members of the security branch two years after his detention.https://www.sahistory.org.za/people/alcott-skei-gwentshe Accessed 3 November 2018Truth and Reconciliation Proceedings http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/hrvtrans%5Chrvel2/gwentshe.htm Accessed 15 October 2018 Personal life Gwentshe was orphaned during the Bulhoek massacre. Little is known of his early life except that he grew up in the Tsomo village in the Eastern Cape. He also enjoyed jazz music and was the leader of the Hot Shots Musical band in his youth. Gwentshe married Irene Ngcebesha-Gwentshe who was active in the struggle against Apartheid. They had two sons, Zweliyazuza ‚ÄòDuke‚Äô Gwentshe and Zwelbanzi ‚ÄòBoyce‚Äô Gwentshe.

It provides tools for creating and manipulating quantum programs and running them on prototype quantum devices on IBM Q Experience or on simulators on a local computer. It follows the circuit model for universal quantum computation, and can be used for any quantum hardware (currently supports superconducting qubits and trapped ions) that follows this model. Qiskit was founded by IBM Research to allow software development for their cloud quantum computing service, IBM Q Experience. Contributions are also made by external supporters, typically from academic institutions. The primary version of Qiskit uses the Python programming language. Versions for Swift and JavaScript were initially explored, though the development for these versions have halted. A range of Jupyter notebooks are provided with examples of quantum computing being used. Examples include the source code behind scientific studies that use Qiskit, as well as a set of exercises to help people to learn the basics of quantum programming. An open source textbook based on Qiskit is available as a university level quantum algorithms or quantum computation course supplement.  Components  Qiskit provides the ability to develop quantum software both at the machine code level of OpenQASM, and at abstract levels suitable for end-users without quantum computing expertise. This functionality is provided by the following distinct components. = Terra = Qiskit Terra provides tools to create quantum circuits at or close to the level of quantum machine code. It allows the processes that run on quantum hardware to be explicitly constructed in terms of quantum gates. It also provides tools to allow quantum circuits to be optimized for a particular device, as well as managing batches of jobs and running them on remote-access quantum devices and simulators. The following shows a simple example of Qiskit Terra. In this, a quantum circuit is created for two qubits, which consists of the quantum gates required to create a Bell state. The quantum circuit then ends with quantum measurements, which extract a bit from each qubit. from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2) qc.h(0) qc.cx(0, 1) qc.measure([0,1], [0,1]) Once the quantum circuit has been created, it can be run on a backend (either quantum hardware or a simulator). In the following example, a local simulator is used. backend = Aer.get_backend(\\"qasm_simulator\\") job_sim = execute(qc, backend) sim_result = job_sim.result() print(sim_result.get_counts(qc)) The final print statement here will show the results returned by the backend. This is a Python dictionary that describes the bit strings obtained from multiple runs of the quantum circuit. In the quantum circuit used in this example, the bit strings \`'00'\` and \`'11'\` should be the only possible results, and should occur with equal probability. The full results will therefore typically have the samples split approximately equally between the two, such as \` {'00':519, '11':505} \`. Experiments done on quantum hardware using Qiskit Terra have been used in many research papers, such as in tests of quantum error correction , generation of entanglement and simulation of far-from-equilibrium dynamics . = Aqua = Qiskit Aqua provides tools that can be used without any explicit quantum programming required by the user themselves. It currently supports applications in chemistry, AI, optimization and finance. Users can provide problems and receive results defined using standard tools in these domains, such as PySCF for chemistry. Qiskit Aqua then implements a corresponding quantum algorithm. = Aer = In the near-term, development of quantum software will depend largely on simulation of small quantum devices. For Qiskit, this is provided by the Aer component. This provides simulators hosted locally on the user's device, as well as HPC resources available through the cloud. The simulators can also simulate the effects of noise for simple and sophisticated noise models. = Ignis = Ignis is a component that contains tools for characterizing noise in near-term devices, as well as allowing computations to be performed in the presence of noise. This is includes tools for benchmarking near-term devices, error mitigation and error correction.

Vietnam War The Division was formed on 20 October 1965 from the 1st (Ba Gia) Regiment and the 21st Regiment which had just arrived from North Vietnam. The Division was under the command of the PAVN B1 Front. In mid-1966 the newly-arrived 31st Regiment was added to the Division. In February 1967 the Division's 21st Regiment was engaged by South Korean forces, losing over 1,000 killed in 2 separate battles northwest of Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i. From 21 April to 5 June 1967, the Division was the target of US Marine Corps' Operations Union and Union II in the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley losing over 1,400 killed. In early August 1967 the Division's 1st and 21st Regiments were the target of Operation Hood River, losing 166 killed. In September 1967 the B1 Front ordered the Division back into the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley. In September 1967 the Division was the target of Operation Wheeler. On 5 December 1967 a command group from the Division was carrying out reconnaissance near Firebase Ross when they were attacked by US helicopter gunships, losing 17 killed including the Division commander, Senior Colonel Le Tru Huu, the division‚Äôs political officer, its deputy chief of staff, its chief of rear services, its chief of military operations and intelligence, its chief of combat operations and training, and the commanders of the 3rd and 21st Regiments along with several of their battalion commanders. On 9 December the Division's 3rd Regiment was engaged by US helicopter gunships near Landing Zone Baldy, losing 121 killed. Senior Col. Giap Van Cuong, a former commander of the 3rd Division, became the Division‚Äôs new commander and was given orders to destroy the US 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division. On the afternoon of 2 January, elements of the 12th Cavalry Regiment engaged a unit of the Division in a four-hour-long battle 5 km south of Ross resulting in 3 U.S. and 39 PAVN killed. On the early morning of 3 January the PAVN attacked four U.S. firebases in the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley, launching ground attacks against Ross and Landing Zone Leslie, which were defeated by dawn for the loss of 18 U.S. and 331 PAVN killed. On 7 January, Division anti-aircraft gunners shot down a helicopter carrying the commander of the 2nd Battalion, 12th Cavalry, Lt. Col. Robert L. Gregory, killing him and six others on board. On 10 January the 2/12th Cavalry, engaged a reinforced battalion of the Division near Firebase Ross resulting in 122 PAVN killed. In total the Division had lost more than 1,100 soldiers killed in action between December and January. For the Tet Offensive of January/February 1968 the Division was to attack Da Nang however its slow approach to the city meant that it was still 25km away on 30 January. As the Division approached Da Nang on 31 January, its 8th Battalion, 31st Regiment, attacked the district capital of ƒêi·ªán B√†n, but the attack was resisted by ARVN troops and Korean Marines. On 3 February when the ARVN 51st Regiment swept through Thanh Quit, they stumbled onto a battalion from the 31st Regiment hidden there and engaged them in battle, supported by the Korean marines until they broke contact at nightfall. On 6 February the Division began a concerted push north towards Da Nang. At 03:00 the 21st Regiment attacked the ARVN 51st Regiment's base camp, the ARVN were reinforced by US Marines and the fighting continued until the PAVN withdrew at nightfall on 7 February with losses estimated at more than 586 killed. Following the Battle of Lo Giang on 8-9 February a combined US Army/Marine task force named Task Force Miracle pursued the Division as it withdrew to its base areas near Go Noi Island () killing 236 PAVN/VC soldiers near there on 9 February. In total the Division had lost 1,200-1,400 soldiers in the period from 29 January to 14 February 1968 and had completely failed to penetrate Da Nang. After the Division had recuperated from its Tet losses, between 10 and 12 May 1968, 2 of its Regiments successfully captured Kham Duc. In July 1968 the Division's 1st Regiment was the target of Operation Pocahontas Forest in the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley in which it lost 127 killed. During the Phase III Offensive a regiment of the Division was ordered to attack Tam K·ª≥. In February 1971 the Division joined the Route 9-Southern Laos Front to counter Operation Lam Son 719. In early March the Division less one regiment attacked the ARVN 1st Regiment, 1st Division on Hill 723. On 20 March the Division attacked the ARVN 2nd Regiment, 1st Division on Hill 660. During the Easter Offensive the Division less one regiment conducted diversion operations north of Dak To. During the War of the flags in January/February 1973 the Division briefly captured Sa Hu·ª≥nh Base and a stretch of Highway 1 before being ejected by ARVN forces by 16 February. On 18 July 1974 the Division conducted a series of attacks on Ranger-held outposts in Qu·∫£ng Nam Province. The Battle of Duc Duc from 18 July to 4 October 1974 where the Division attacked the ARVN 3rd Division and Ranger forces resulted in more that more than 4,700 ARVN had killed, wounded, or missing. During the 1975 Spring Offensive the Division was tasked with attacking Tam K·ª≥ and then moving north with the 572nd Artillery Regiment, 573rd Anti-Aircraft Regiment and 574th Tank-Armor Regiment to threaten the southern approaches to Da Nang. On 21 March the Division began attacking the outer defenses of Tam K·ª≥ and by 24 March following an artillery barrage, began their attack on the city, quickly penetrating the western and southern defenses. The ARVN defenses soon broke with some ARVN units being evacuated by helicopters from the beach while others fled north and south along Highway 1. Following the capture of Tam K·ª≥, the Division moved north along Highway 1 bypassing ARVN defensive positions and together with other PAVN columns entered Da Nang on the morning of 29 March. On 5 April the Division was ordered to remain and secure Qu·∫£ng Nam and Qu·∫£ng T√≠n Provinces while other PAVN units moved south to join the assault on Saigon.

History The Provisional Army of the United States was created as a second, standing army to exist simultaneously with the United States Army, due to political concerns about increasing the size of the latter force. Raised following the outbreak of war between the United States and France, unlike the United States Army the term of enlistment of personnel to the Provisional Army was only for the duration of the \\"existing differences between the United States and the French Republic\\". Further, despite being a federal force, the soldiers of the Provisional Army were not permitted to serve outside the states in which they were recruited, in that respect making it similar to the state militias. George Washington was the commanding general of the Provisional Army of the United States. The 5th United States Congress authorized President of the United States John Adams to raise the Provisional Army between its 1798 summer recess and its reassembly the following winter. However, Adams only commissioned seven officers before his authority to recruit personnel to the Provisional Army expired. Due to the fact no meaningful recruiting had occurred, new legislation was thereafter enacted creating yet another army, the Eventual Army of the United States, to which all of the Provisional Army's empty regiments were transferred. The Provisional Army of the United States was officially dissolved on June 15, 1800. Organization The commanding officer of the Provisional Army was George Washington who was commissioned at the rank of Lieutenant General and to the post of \\"Commander in Chief of all the Armies of the United States\\", giving him titular authority over both the Provisional Army of the United States and the United States Army. The aging Washington accepted the appointment conditioned on his ability to remain in secluded retirement at Mount Vernon until actually needed. The Provisional Army's other officers included Major General Alexander Hamilton (Inspector General), Brigadier General William North (Adjutant General), and Dr. James Craik (Physician General). On paper, the Provisional Army was organized into one cavalry regiment and twelve infantry regiments.

His ideas on evolution may be characterized as a form of theistic evolution. Lever was an important voice in shaping Dutch public debate on evolution and biology, particularly in protestant circles. Life and career The Reformed Lever studied biology at Utrecht University from 1939 onwards. Lever obtained his doctorate in 1950. He served as a professor of zoology at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam from 1952 until 1986.H. de Vries (1994), \\"'Allesweter' prof. Jan Lever: 'Ik heb een kinderlijke belangstelling voor allerlei dingen.' Digibron. Kenniscentrum Gereformeerde Gezindte', 9 februari 1994. In his inaugural lecture, he presented his belief that evolution was the way in which God had created the world. He further developed this argument in his book Creatie en evolutie (1956; English translation 1958 under the title Creation and Evolution). In 1970, Lever was elected member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Research and writings In the early 1950s, Lever started research on the neuroendocrine system of the basommatophoran snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. Lever himself found a particular kind of neurons in the ancylid snail Ferrissia, and his student Joos Joosse demonstrated those neurons in other snail species. Lymnaea became the animal of choice for physiological research at the VU Amsterdam laboratory for decades. At the beginning of his career, Lever‚Äôs ideas about evolution and the species concept were inspired by the Reformational philosophy of philosopher Herman Dooyeweerd. During his student days, Lever became acquainted with the biologist Johann Heinrich Diemer, who had published about Dooyeweerd's approach in the domain of biology in the 1930s. Diemer was a great influence on Lever's thought. Together with Dooyeweerd, Lever wrote four articles about the species concept in the journal Philosophia Reformata (1948‚Äì1950) in which species were defined as constant types. In his book, Creatie en Evolutie (1956), Lever still subscribed to Dooyeweerd‚Äôs philosophy but also suggested that it is possible that biological evolution occurred. Later he moved away from these earlier ideas about species constancy, and adhered to a kind of theistic evolution.

It is the oldest working lighthouse in Batangas and one of the oldest working lighthouses in the Philippines. It serves as a guide for ships passing through the Verde Island Passage and entering Manila Bay.  History  The lighthouse in 1903. The historical marker installed on the site in 2018. The Cape Santiago Lighthouse was among the lighthouses constructed by the Spanish colonial authorities in the Philippines from 1846 to 1896 as part of the Plan General de Alumbrado de Maritimo de las Costas del Archipelago de Filipino (Masterplan for the Lighting of the Maritime Coasts of the Philippine Archipelago), the goal of which was to install 55 lighthouses all over the archipelago, including its remotest corners. In 1887, Spanish engineer Magin Pers y Pers, who also designed the lighthouses at Cape Bojeador and Cape Enga√±o, proposed the construction of a lighthouse in Cape Santiago after conducting a site evaluation.From the inscription on the historical marker installed by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines on the site on March 12, 2018 Don Santiago Zobel, the rich landowner of Hacienda Bigaa in Calatagan, donated the one-hectare property where the lighthouse was constructed. Construction company Aldecoa y Compania constructed the lighthouse based on a design by Spanish engineer Guillermo Brockman. Made of brick and lime cement, the red round structure is tall and was modeled after Europe's medieval castles. A lighthouse keeper's house was also built beside the lighthouse tower where the keeper and his or her family can take up residence. The lighthouse was inaugurated and lit on December 15, 1890. After the American annexation of the Philippines in 1898, the management of the Spanish-built lighthouses in the country fell into American hands. From 1900 to 1902 ‚Äî the height of the Philippine-American War ‚Äî the American gunboat USS Villalobos, a former Spanish gunboat captured after the American annexation of the Philippines, guarded the lighthouse. The gunboat regularly patrolled the area around the lighthouse, Malabrigo Point and Cabra Island from its base in Cavite, maintaining a communication link with the Marines guarding lighthouses and keeping a sharp lookout for smuggling and trafficking of supplies to Filipino revolutionaries. During World War II, the lighthouse suffered minor damage after American warplanes strafed a Japanese garrison in the area. Over the succeeding years, the lighthouse deteriorated due to neglect and its original light source went missing. In 1980, the Japanese government, through the Japan International Cooperation Agency, donated a light bulb to replace the missing light source. The bulb has since been replaced with a modern, solar-powered lens that the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) has recently installed. In 1990, the PCG renovated the abandoned lighthouse keeper's house and repurposed it as an inn for tourists. It renovated structure was unveiled on December 15, 1990 ‚Äî the centenary of the lighthouse's inauguration. On April 18, 1995, the PCG, then under Commodore Arturo Capada, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with former Batangas Governor and Resort Association of the Philippines Inc. (RAPI) president Jose Antonio Leviste to develop Cape Santiago into a tourism site. RAPI reclaimed around of sea along the shoreline of the lighthouse, an action that was not part of the MOU, which only authorized the improvement of the existing building and development of the surrounding land area. The development has since been discontinued. In October 2007, the Philippine Coast Guard Auxiliary proposed to adopt and restore the lighthouse as its headquarters. On March 12, 2018, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines installed a historical marker on the site, designating its status a National Historical Landmark.

It illustrates the Sumiyoshi Monogatari, a 10th century novel that narrates the misadventures of a young girl mistreated by her stepmother and her romance with a high-ranking soldier. The work is classified as Important Cultural Property and is preserved at the Tokyo National Museum, but four fragments became detached during the 19th century. Background The captain inquires of a maid, and then of a nun, about his beloved Originating in Japan in the sixth or seventh century through trade with the Chinese Empire, the art of the emaki spread widely among the aristocracy in the Heian period. An emaki consists of one or more long rolls of paper narrating a story through yamato-e texts and paintings. The reader discovers the story by progressively unrolling the roll with one hand while rewinding it with the other hand, from right to left (according to the then horizontal writing direction of Japanese script), so that only a portion of text or image of about is visible. The narrative assumes a series of scenes, the rhythm, composition and transitions of which are entirely the artist's sensitivity and technique. The themes of the stories were very varied: illustrations of novels, historical chronicles, religious texts, biographies of famous people, humorous or fantastic anecdotes, etc. Illustrations of novels, stories or newspapers were appreciated by the ladies of the court during the Heian period. They included famous emaki such as the Genji Monogatari Emaki and the '. During the Kamakura period, interest in the refined culture of the aristocrats of the Heian period continued, with the production of emaki on the life at the court, such as the Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki, the ', the ' and the Sumiyoshi Monogatari Emaki. Description The two lovebirds are finally reunited The marriage ceremony The oldest preserved emaki illustrating the Sumiyoshi Monogatari dates from the end of 13th century or the beginning of the 14th century, although earlier illustrations have existed in the past. That emaki is nowadays in the form of a paper scroll composed of a single long painting, without text. Four fragments were detached at an unknown date but subsequent to 1848 and reassembled in the form of a kakemono (vertical roller) The Tokyo National Museum has the horizontal scroll and one of the fragments. Another fragment is held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (since 2015); the rest belong to individuals. There is also a single fragment of the original text, but with only three lines. The emaki illustrates the Sumiyoshi Monogatari, a famous novel of the 10th century, in which a young girl, a daughter of a Ch≈´nagon (Middle Counselor), runs away from home to escape abuse from her stepmother. She falls in love with a minor captain and becomes engaged to him. Her stepmother, however, compels the minor captain to marry her own daughter instead. She also prevents the girl from serving at the palace or marrying a watchman. When the girl discovers the truth, she escapes to the Sumiyoshi Grand Shrine. Later, the minor captain, who has since been promoted to major captain, is taken to the shrine by a mystical dream with the help of Kannon. He and the girl get married and live happily ever after, while the stepmother ends her life in poverty and disgrace. The novel dates from the 10th century in the Heian period, but the original is known only by a 12th century copy. The Sumiyoshi Monogatari Emaki was created in the yamato-e painting style. Although it belongs to the genre of the illustrations of novels of the court (monogatari), it presents a pictorial style relatively different from other works on this theme such as the Genji Monogatari Emaki. Indeed, the scroll depicts the story as a long painting in which several scenes follow one another without clear transition and without any textual interruption, an approach rarely used for monogatari. That depiction aims to reflect the evolution of time, so that some characters appear several times in the same scene to illustrate successive phases of the story. Moreover, to represent the interior scenes, the painter did not use the classical technique of fukinuki yatai, consisting of removing the roof to show the parts of a building from an elevated a point of view; on the contrary, the scroll adopts a lower point of view and introduces interiors through openings such as windows, doors or sliding panels. The Sumiyoshi Monogatari Emaki therefore testifies to the evolution of the paintings of the court during the Kamakura period, the painters willingly deviating from the old conventions exhibited especially in the Genji Monogatari Emaki (the oldest preserved emaki of the court).

The council was elected by First Past the Post with each elector having three votes in the three- member seats. Campaign The campaign attracted little attention. The Conservative Party campaign focused on housing issues. The London Labour Party organised a tour of twenty cars through South East London, carrying politicians who made short speeches at numerous locations in the area. Other election issues included the proposed construction of the Royal National Theatre, and the London Ringways road schemes. Results The Labour Party lost seventeen seats to the Conservative Party, but still secured a substantial majority of seats on the council. This ensured that the Labour Party would complete thirty years in control of the council. The Liberal Party was hopeful of winning at least one seat in the election, but it failed to do so. The Independent Labour Party, Union Movement and British National Party also stood candidates but failed to secure any seats, as did assorted independent candidates. Turnout in the election was 34.7%, an increase of 3.2% over the previous election. A closely fought contest in Fulham led to a turnout of 47%, a record for the seat. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:right;\\" style=\\"font-size:95%\\" - ! style=\\"vertical- align:center;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Party !! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"3\\"Votes !! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Seats - style=\\"text-align: right\\" ! align=centerNumber !! align=center% !! align=centerStood !! align=centerSeats !! align=center% - style=\\"text- align: right\\"  align=\\"right\\"  403,680  align=\\"right\\"  50.4  align=\\"right\\"  126  align=\\"right\\"  84  align=\\"right\\"  66.7 - style=\\"text-align: right\\"  align=\\"right\\"  336,468  align=\\"right\\"  42.0  align=\\"right\\"  126  align=\\"right\\"  42  align=\\"right\\"  33.3 - style=\\"text-align: right\\"  align=\\"right\\"  47,845  align=\\"right\\"  6.0  align=\\"right\\"  69  align=\\"right\\"  0  align=\\"right\\"  0.0 - style=\\"text-align: right\\"  align=\\"right\\"  7,622  align=\\"right\\"  1.0  align=\\"right\\"  5  align=\\"right\\"  0  align=\\"right\\"  0.0 - style=\\"text-align: right\\"  align=\\"right\\"  3,695  align=\\"right\\"  0.5  align=\\"right\\"  3  align=\\"right\\"  0  align=\\"right\\"  0.0 - style=\\"text-align: right\\"  align=\\"right\\"  2,605  align=\\"right\\"  0.3  align=\\"right\\"  3  align=\\"right\\"  0  align=\\"right\\"  0.0 - style=\\"text-align: right\\"  align=\\"right\\"  2,094  align=\\"right\\"  0.3  align=\\"right\\"  2  align=\\"right\\"  0  align=\\"right\\"  0.0 - style=\\"text-align: right\\"  align=\\"right\\"  1,633  align=\\"right\\"  0.2  align=\\"right\\"  3  align=\\"right\\"  0  align=\\"right\\"  0.0 - style=\\"text-align: right\\"   Alert Party  align=\\"right\\"  672  align=\\"right\\"  0.1  align=\\"right\\"  2  align=\\"right\\"  0  align=\\"right\\"  0.0 } References 1961 elections in the United Kingdom County Council election 1961 English local elections London County Council elections April 1961 events ","title":"1961 London County Council election"},{"id":"58969277","title":"2018 World Weightlifting Championships ‚Äì Women's 81 kg"},{"id":"58969284","text":"Simone Couderc (3 June 1911 ‚Äì 16 November 2005) was a French operatic mezzo- soprano She was particularly well-known in the major roles of the mezzo- soprano repertoire: Amneris (Aida), Dalila (Samson and Dalila), Orph√©e (Orfeo ed Euridice), Kundry (Parsifal), Carmen, Santuzza (Cavalleria rusticana), Baba la turque (The Rake's Progress), the mother (Louise), etc.  Biography  Born in Cruzy (H√©rault), her family settled in Rouen, and she enrolled at the √âcole sup√©rieure d'art et design Le Havre-Rouen to attend courses in painting, sculpture and drawing, but by chance Reynaldo Hahn heard her as she sang in a church.

The battle exacted a terrible toll from the Japanese naval air arm, costing them most of their few remaining experienced pilots. The Combined Fleet was no longer capable of serious offensive operations after this engagement. Historian Samuel Eliot Morison characterized it this way: This was the greatest carrier battle of the war. The forces engaged were three to four times those in preceding actions like Midway, and victory was so complete that the Japanese could never again engage on such a scale. ... above all the skill, initiative, and intrepid courage of the young aviators made this day one of the high points in the history of the American spirit.Morison 1953, pp. 277-278 Since the Japanese assumed the tactical offensive, their forces are listed first.

The 293rd overall episode of the series, it aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 7, 2018. The episode features a parody of recurring character and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who is enlisted by the main characters in a crisis that is causing the deaths of numerous citizens of South Park. The episode is the first part of a two-episode storyline and primarily deals with climate change denial. Plot South Park residents Jimbo Kern and Ned Gerblansky track what they believe to be a bear through a field, which is revealed to be Tegridy Farms, the property of Randy and Sharon Marsh. Suddenly, Ned is attacked by a monster called ManBearPig (a creature first referenced in the episode of the same name) and is carried away in his jaws in front of Jimbo, Randy, and the latter's son, Stan, an incident that Stan relates to his friends. A schoolmate of Stan's named Collin Brooks is found dead in the schoolyard of South Park Elementary School. Thinking it was another school shooting, Park County Police investigator Sergeant Yates goes to the school, irritated that his time playing Red Dead Redemption 2, which is repeatedly referenced by other characters in the episode, is being infringed on by the local children. Despite the mutilated and partially eaten remains, Yates continues to regard Brooks' death as a shooting. His suspicions fall on Stan and his friends Eric Cartman, Kenny McCormick, and Kyle Broflovski, for which Yates eventually issues arrest warrants. More bodies are found in the woods, and ManBearPig eventually begins attacking groups of people in eating establishments in broad daylight. Despite this, some members of the public continue to express skepticism of ManBearPig's existence, and question what could possibly be done about it now. As the attacks continue, Yates and his wife, Maggie, suffer the stress of the investigation, especially as it infringes upon the free time he would rather spend playing his video game. Remembering that former U.S. Vice President Al Gore was an investigator in the existence of ManBearPig, Stan and his friends go to him to enlist his help. Gore angrily recalls when the boys and the rest of the public ridiculed and ignored him when he tried to warn them about the creature in that prior episode and says that they should have heeded his warnings back then. After acceding to Gore's demand for an apology and extended praise and groveling, Gore decides to help them. He tells the boys that ManBearPig is a demon sent by the Devil for unknown reasons. The group sacrifices a goat in a demonic ritual in order to summon Satan, who leads the group to the local library to research the creature. There, Satan learns that ManBearPig is a Sifter of Fate, a demon that appears every few generations to exploit mankind's weaknesses by making a deal with someone in town. Yates and the police surround the library and order the boys to surrender. Stan pleads with the police, telling them that Al Gore was right all along, and that this time, they all need to admit that they were wrong. Yates ignores Stan and arrests the boys, much to the horror of Stan's grandfather Grampa Marsh, who watches the event on television, and says to himself, \\"What have I done?\\" Reception Jesse Schedeen with IGN rated the episode a 9.1 out of 10, summarizing in his review, \\"Before this episode, it might have seemed like there was nowhere left to go with Al Gore's anti-ManBearPig crusade. 'Time to Get Cereal' proved how wrong that is by taking full advantage of Gore's return and the climate change metaphor at the heart of his nemesis.\\" Schedeen also noted that the episode's storyline appeared to be an attempt to apologize for South Park's previous humoring of climate change. John Hugar with The A.V. Club gave the episode a B grade and agreed with Schedeen that this episode appeared to be apologizing for the previous ridicule of Gore and climate change, stating in his review, \\"More than anything else, I'm surprised this episode exists. Over the last few seasons, Trey and Matt have looked inward, and considered the notion that some of what they had to say hasn't aged well, but it's pretty jarring to see them take a previous episode and say 'shit, we fucked up.'\\" During filming of The Daily Show, Al Gore was asked about the way South Park had portrayed him and ManBearPig in this and the following episode, and said \\"I thought it was a hell of a statement by South Park, and I appreciated it a lot\\".

On Palm Sunday, 10 April 1960, she became one of the first three female priests in Sweden when she was ordained by Archbishop Gunnar Hultgren in the Saint Catherine Foundation chapel at √ñstersk√§r near Stockholm. The same day Ingrid Persson was ordained in H√§rn√∂sand Cathedral and Elisabeth Djurle in Stockholm. Biography Born on 6 May 1914 in Stockholm, Margit Rigmor Sahlin was the 12th and youngest child of the schoolteacher Enar Sahlin and Ragnhild Nettelbladet. She was the granddaughter of Carl Yngve Sahlin who was the rector of Uppsala University from 1876 to 1889. After matricularing from the Wallinska skolan in Stockholm when only 17, she studied at Uppsala University where she graduated in romance languages, earning a doctorate in 1940. Thereafter she read theology, graduating in 1943. While still at university, she attracted considerable attention when she published an article in the Christian journal V√•r L√∂sen calling for the ordination of women. When the Second World War ended in 1945, Sahlin travelled widely in Europe. She was inspired by the religious communities she visited in Taize, France, Iona, Scotland, and Assisi in Italy. She hoped to join the church but at the time women were not admitted as priests in Sweden. In 1948, she became active in the Women's Church Council which led to the founding of Saint Catherine's Foundation (S:ta Katharinastiftelsen). She was the principal contributor to the foundation which began her life's work. Despite strong opposition, in 1958 the Church of Sweden resolved to permit women to be ordained as priests. Sahlin became one of the three women to request ordination. On Easter Sunday in 1960, she was ordained in the Saint Catherine Chapel by Archbishop Hultgren. In 1970, she became the rector of Engelbrekts f√∂rsamling in the diocese of Stockholm, so becoming Sweden's first female rector. Margit Sahlin retired in 1979 but remained active in the Saint Catherine Foundation until her death in Stockholm on 1 March 2003. She is buried in Uppsala Old Cemetery. Selected publications In addition to contributing to journals, Sahlin wrote several books, including: *1950: Sahlin, Margit, Man och kvinna i Kristi kyrka, Diakonistyrelses Bokf√∂rlag *1959: Sahlin, Margit, Ordets tj√§nst i en f√∂r√§ndrad v√§rld, Svenska Kyrkans Diakonistyrelses Bokf√∂rlag *1980: Sahlin, Margit, Dags f√∂r ompr√∂vning, Proprius *2000: Sahlin, Margit; √Öhlstedt, Madeleine, S:ta Katharinastiftelsen ett 50 √•rigt tros√§ventyr, Stockholm References Further reading  * 1914 births 2003 deaths People from Stockholm Ordination of women in Christianity Swedish Lutheran priests Women Lutheran clergy Uppsala University alumni Burials at Uppsala old cemetery ","title":"Margit Sahlin"},{"id":"58969496","text":"A Wardley map is a map of the structure of a business or service, mapping the components needed to serve the customer or user. Wardley maps are named after Simon Wardley who claims that he created the technique at Fotango in 2005 having created the evolutionary framing the previous year. The technique was further developed within Canonical UK between 2008 and 2010 and components of mapping can be found in the \\"Better For Less\\" paper published in 2010.  Summary  Each component in a Wardley map is classified by the value it has to the customer or user and by the maturity of that component, ranging from custom-made to commodity. Components are drawn as nodes on a graph with value on the -axis and commodity on the -axis. A custom-made component with no direct value to the user would sit at the bottom-left of such a graph while a commodity component with high direct value to the user would sit at the top- right of such a graph. Components are connected on the graph with edges showing that they are linked. Much of the theory of Wardley mapping is set out in a series of nineteen blog posts written by Wardley and a dedicated wiki called Wardleypedia. As use of the technique has broadened to new institutions and been used to map new things the application of the technique in practice has drifted from the original vision.  Example  Imagine that we want to set up a new drone courier service. The user need is to receive packages quickly from our company. Our objective as a company is to meet this user need by delivering packages quickly to customers. This is a high-value, low- commodity component and is placed at the top-left of a Wardley map. If there were dozens of competing drone courier companies this component would move right on the Wardley map, indicating that the service is closer to being a commodity. Other components are mapped similarly. For example, a drone operator needs to be aware of the weather conditions to determine the route a drone should take and the maximum weight it can carry. Weather information is of little value to the customer and can be bought from a wide range of weather data providers. It is thus placed at the bottom-right of the Wardley map. Key components needed to set up a drone courier service (left). The same components on a Wardley map (right).  Uses  Wardley maps are used within UK government, with particular interest within the Government Digital Service (GDS) for strategic planning and identifying the best targets for government digital service modernisation. They have been used to map the existing and planned technology infrastructure and services for High Speed 2 (HS2). They have been used to map the value chain and maturity of components in security operations to support a large scale commercial organisation decide to build or outsource their security operations centre, SOC Value Chain & Delivery Models  Tools  The Atlas2 tool, by Leading Edge Forum, aims to assist with the creation of Wardley maps.  Criticisms  Simon Wardley claims that much of the process's value lies in \\"exposing assumptions. allowing challenge and creating consensus\\" ‚Äî but detractors worry that the process in fact lets people \\"launder assumptions into facts, delegitimise challenge (and still create consensus)\\".

It is operated by Huafa Sports, part of the Zhuhai Huafa Group. It currently hosts three international competitions: the WTA Elite Trophy, the Zhuhai Open and the Asia-Pacific Wildcard Playoff for the Australian Open. Huafa Center Court The center covers a floor area of approximately 117,000 square meters. Its first phase, which was completed in 2015, is 68,000 square meters in area. It consists of a center court with a capacity for 5,000 spectators, one court accommodating 1,500 people, four smaller match courts, and twelve practice courts. It was purpose built for the WTA Elite Trophy, which was inaugurated in 2015. It was designed by the sporting architectural company Populous, which was also behind the Wimbledon Centre Court and the Margaret Court Arena in Melbourne Park. The first phase was begun only a year before the center opened, and involved draining and reclamation of the site before construction could begin. Because the WTA Elite Trophy is classified as an outdoor competition, the specifications included a requirement that all courts, indoor and outdoor, have the same climatic conditions in terms of temperature and humidity. Populous achieved this by designing a covered center court with two roofs: a cantilevered outer roof covering the stands, and a central roof covering the court, which allows natural light and ventilation while protecting players and spectators from direct sunlight and rain. The grounds were landscaped as a park, which is open to the public while tournaments are not taking place. The center opened in September 2015, two months before the 2015 WTA Elite Trophy, and hosted the $50,000 Zhuhai ITF Women's Pro Circuit, which subsequently combined with a men's tournament to become the Zhuhai Open. The Women's Tennis Association website reported that \\"players and fans loved the new stadium, which offered excellent vantage points from every seat.\\" The center is in the central section of Henqin New Area. The Henqin New Area was developed, beginning in 2009, as an area of cooperation between the prefecture of Zhuhai and the special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong, under China's \\"one country, two systems\\" policy. Henqin and Macau are separated by only 200 meters, and there is a bridge between the two. Between August and December 2018, the Hengqin Tennis Center offered the use of its training facilities for free to all residents of Zhuhai, Macau and Hong Kong.

Early musical education Alon Sariel was born in Beersheba, Israel, the youngest of five siblings. He started playing the mandolin at the age of eight as student of Dora Bartik at the Beersheba Conservatory. Due to a sabbatical year of his father at the University of Caltech, Pasadena, Alon spent a year in Los Angeles with his family, where he was exposed to the Bluegrass mandolin style. Returning to Israel at the age of 13, he continued his musical education in the mandolin class of Lev Khaimovich at the Beersheba Conservatory, as well as music literature and theory with Mila Kosorovitzky, Gila Wolfson and Larisa Smoliar. For some years he also attended piano and percussion classes from Fania Eisenberg and Vadim Galil at the conservatory. At this stage, Sariel received a mandolin made by Arik Kerman, an instrument which would accompany him for almost 20 years. Musical higher education In 2004, Sariel was accepted to Motti Shmitt's mandolin and violin class at the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance and later followed orchestra conducting studies with Evgeny Tsirlin. Following an invitation from Daniel Barenboim's West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, Sariel joined the orchestra on tours between 2007 and 2012, playing mandolin excerpts and following Maestro Barenboim's work. Besides his formal studies, Sariel joined courses and masterclasses and received guidance from conductors Yoel Levi, Martyn Brabbins and Benjamin Zander, mandolinists Ugo Orlandi, Carlo Aonzo and Avi Avital, domrist Tamara Volskaya, violinists Sophie Gent and Ilan Gronich, lutenist Ophira Zakai and recorder player Corina Marti. Among his teachers in Jerusalem were Michael Melzer, David Shemer, Michael Wolpe, Zvi Avni, Menachem Zur and Menachem Wiesenberg. By the time, Sariel graduated from the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance in 2009, he has won first prizes in every of the academy's competitions he was allowed to attend, including the competition for string instruments (2006), the chamber music competition (2007) and the conducting competition (2009). Through the program Erasmus Mundus, Sariel was able to study at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels in 2008, where he started playing the lute under Philippe Malfeyt and continued studying orchestra conducting with Ronald Zollman. During that time Alon was invited by mandolinist Ralf Leenen to join his Antwerp based ensemble La Napolitaine on tour to Japan, together they performed in Tokyo and Kyoto among other cities. Between 2010 and 2015 he was registered at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik, Theater und Medien Hannover with a major in lute under Hans-Michael Koch and conducting with Paul Weigold and later Martin Brau√ü. In some of these years he also participated at the Winter Akademie of the Hochschule f√ºr K√ºnste in Bremen, and received guidance from Joachim Held (lute) and Margit Schulthei√ü (historical harp). Career As a mandolin soloist, Sariel has performed with most of the Israeli orchestras, often as conductor as well. These include the Jerusalem Symphony, the Tel Aviv Soloists, the Haifa Symphony, the Israeli Sinfonieta and Israel Chamber Orchestra. Following several competitions won in the UK, Sariel was invited to perform with English orchestras. These include Airedale Symphony, London International Orchestra, Imaestri and The Orchestra of the City who commissioned for Sariel the Sinfonia Concertante for mandolin and strings \\"Nedudim\\" by Gilad Hochman (2014). This work was recorded by Sariel and the Deutsches Kammerorchester Berlin for the label Neue Meister in 2016. As a continuo player Alon Sariel collaborated with ensembles such as Elbipolis Barockorchester Hamburg, KlangForum Heidelberg and Holland Baroque, to name a few. In 2015 Sariel founded Concerto Foscari, an international ensemble playing historical instruments, to realize his innovative musical programs and ideas. At the same year he co-founded the quartet PRISMA, together with violist D√°vid Budai, recorder player Elisabeth Champollion and violinist Franciska Anna Hajdu. As a soloist or in different formations, Alon Sariel was seen on stages such as the Berliner Philharmonie, The Royal Albert Hall, BOZAR, the Glocke in Bremen and Laeiszhalle in Hamburg.

Eucalyptus gregoryensis is a species of small tree or mallee that is endemic to the Northern Territory. It has smooth, powdery white bark, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds usually in groups of three, white flowers and cup-shaped to hemispherical fruit. Description Eucalyptus gregoryensis is a small tree or mallee that typically grows to a height of and has a lignotuber. It has a semi-weeping habit and smooth powdery white bark that is pale pink when new. Young plants and coppice regrowth have broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped, dull greyish green leaves, long and wide. The adult leaves are arranged alternately, lance- shaped or curved, the same dull green to grey-green leaves on both sides, long and wide with a base tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are usually arranged in groups of three, sometimes seven, in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels up to long. Mature buds are oval to spindle-shaped, long and wide with a rounded to conical operculum. The flowers are white and the fruit is a woody, cup-shaped to hemispherical capsule long and wide, with the valves protruding above the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus gregoryensis was first formally described by the botanists Neville Walsh and David Edward Albrecht in 1998 in the journal Muelleria, although the name originally given was E. gregoriensis. The type collection was made near a tributary of East Baines River in the Gregory National Park in 1996. The specific epithet is in reference to the Gregory National Park which was named for the explorer Augustus Charles Gregory who explored this area in 1855 and 1856. Distribution The tree has a small range and is found in the Gregory National Park and the Victoria River Downs region in the top end of the Northern Territory where it is found up on the sandstone plateaus and cliffs over seasonal water courses.

It was opened in 1855 and runs from Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof via several routes to Winterthur and is a bottleneck in Swiss rail transport. Practically all lines of the core network of the Z√ºrich S-Bahn use parts of this line.  History The Z√ºrich‚ÄìWinterthur railway line is part of the route that the Z√ºrich-Lake Constance Railway (Z√ºrich-Bodenseebahn) planned to build from Z√ºrich to Romanshorn. The Swiss Northeastern Railway (Schweizerische Nordostbahn) the successor to the Z√ºrich-Lake Constance Railway opened the Winterthur‚ÄìRomanshorn section on 18 May 1855 and the section from Winterthur to Oerlikon went into operation on 27 December. The rail link to Lake Constance was finally completed with the opening of the last section between Oerlikon and Z√ºrich on 26 June 1856. The line was mostly double track from the start. It runs from Wipkingen to Oerlikon and from there via Wallisellen, Dietlikon and Effretikon to Winterthur. In 1902, the line became the property of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), which opened electrical operations on the line on 6 August 1925.  Route sections Overview of lines The line contains several different route and only the section from Effretikon to Winterthur has no alternative route. Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof and Oerlikon are connected by three tunnels. Two of them from the above-ground \\"old\\" terminus to Oerlikon. In 2014, with the commissioning of the Weinberg Tunnel, trains have run from the newly built underground station to Oerlikon. There are three connections from Oerlikon to Effretikon: via Wallisellen, Kloten and the Airport. The Z√ºrichberg line, which runs from the Hauptbahnhof via Stadelhofen to Effretikon, is, with a few exceptions, only used by S-Bahn trains. Photograph from 1898: the Aussersihl Viaduct = Wipkingen line (Z√ºrich HB‚ÄìWipkingen‚ÄìOerlikon) = This was the first connection between Z√ºrich HB and Oerlikon. It was opened on 26 June 1856 and still ran at that time over a ramp to the Limmat Bridge. This ran along the route now occupied by the street of R√∂ntgenstrasse, which explains its sweeping course. Because this ramp was too steep for the locomotives of the period, it built the Aussersihl Viaduct (Aussersihler Viadukt) from the station approach; this has a more moderate slope due to its curved route. When it was built, it was the longest railway bridge in Switzerland at 834 metres. After running over a short section on the old line, it reaches the bridge over the Sihlquai and the Limmat. The two bridges together are also called the Wipkingen Viaduct (Wipkinger Viadukt). After the bridge, the line passes through Z√ºrich Wipkingen station and then immediately runs through Wipkingen Tunnel, after which it continues for some distance in an open cutting, where it merges with the K√§ferberg line and finally reaches Z√ºrich Oerlikon station. Although it was planned from the beginning as a double-track line, two-track operations only started on 30 May 1860. It has been electrified since 1925 and electrical operations started on 6 August of that year. The section is used by some long-distance trains and line . = K√§ferberg line (Z√ºrich HB‚ÄìHardbr√ºcke‚ÄìOerlikon) = The K√§ferberg line, named after the K√§ferberg Tunnel, is the second connection between Oerlikon and Oerlikon and the Hauptbahnhof. It was opened on 1 June 1969 as a direct connection between Oerlikon and Altstetten for freight trains. On 23 May 1982, double track was opened on the Hardturm Viaduct (Hardturmviadukt) connecting the Hauptbahnhof to Hardbr√ºcke station, which initially had only had two platform edges on the ramp to the Hardturm viaduct. With the construction of the S-Bahn line between the Hauptbahnhof and Altstetten, two more platforms were added. Since the commissioning of the Zurich S-Bahn in 1990, S-Bahn services in the Limmat valley have also stopped at Hardbr√ºcke. The K√§ferberg line is used by the trains of lines (until Hardbr√ºcke, extended during rush hour to B√ºlach), , , , , , and . = Oerlikon‚ÄìWallisellen‚ÄìEffretikon = The Oerlikon‚ÄìEffretikon section is the continuation of the Wipkingen line and was opened on 27 December 1855 by the Swiss Northeastern Railway (Schweizerische Nordostbahn). Until the opening of the airport line, this section carried almost all long-distance traffic. It was planned from the beginning as a double-track line, with the second track officially going into operation between Z√ºrich and Wallisellen on 30 May 1860 and between Wallisellen and Effretikon in 1861. Electrical operations started on 6 August 1925. In Wallisellen, the Wallisellen‚ÄìUster‚ÄìRapperswil railway (also called the Glatthalbahn) branches off to D√ºbendorf, Uster and Rapperswil. The Z√ºrichberg line branches off in Dietlikon. The section is served by trains on lines (from Dietlikon), , (to Wallisellen, branching to the Wallisellen‚ÄìUster‚ÄìRapperswil railway), and . S3 service to Dietlikon, at H√ºrlistein = Effretikon‚ÄìWinterthur = The Effretikon‚ÄìWinterthur section is the continuation of the route from Z√ºrich via Oerlikon, Wallisellen, Dietlikon, Effretikon and was opened in 1855 by the Northeastern Railway. The line was doubled in 1862. In 1877, the competing Swiss National Railway (Schweizerische Nationalbahn, SNB) built another track next to the existing double track for their line from Baden Oberstadt via Wettingen‚ÄìSeebach‚ÄìKloten to Winterthur. However, due to financial problems, the SNB was compulsorily liquidated in 1878 and the Northeastern Railway took over this company. In 1880, the third track of the former SNB was dismantled. Today, a third track would be of use, because this route is a bottleneck in the link from Zurich via Winterthur to Ostschweiz and is considered the busiest in Switzerland. To increase the line capacity, there have been many different projects such as quadruplication of the line or construction of the Br√ºtten Tunnel as a continuation of the Airport line from Bassersdorf to Winterthur. However, these efforts have so far failed because financing had not been confirmed in 2010 at the beginning of the preparation of the Strategic Development Rail Infrastructure Program (Strategisches Entwicklungsprogramm Bahninfrastruktur, known as Rail 2030). As a last resort, a three-track upgrade of the line has been completed from Winterthur station to the motorway underpass at T√∂ssm√ºhle. The canton plans a station in Winterthur-T√∂ss. In Winterthur, the line passes under the Storchen Bridge, which is brightly illuminated at night and can be seen by train passengers. The section is used by all long-distance trains and lines , , , , , and . = Oerlikon‚ÄìKloten‚ÄìBassersdorf = The former SNB Bassersdorf‚ÄìKloten‚ÄìOpfikon line was opened in 1877 and electrical operations were introduced on 6 August 1925. Initially, the whole line consisted of a single track, but the section that is also used by the airport line (between Dorfnest junction and H√ºrlistein junction) was converted to double track with the construction of that line. Bassersdorf station was relocated at the same time. Today the line is served by services. The line at Opfikon was covered over during the duplication of the line in 1977‚Äì79 and Opfikon station was built at this point. = Airport line (Oerlikon‚ÄìBassersdorf‚ÄìEffretikon) = The airport line between Oerlikon and Bassersdorf was inaugurated in 1980. It connects Zurich Airport to the Swiss rail system. Z√ºrich Airport is located below Check-In 3. All long-distance trains between Z√ºrich and Winterthur and , (both until Z√ºrich Airport) and services run on this line. = Z√ºrichberg line (Z√ºrich HB‚ÄìStadelhofen‚ÄìDietlikon/D√ºbendorf) = This is the real heart of the Z√ºrich S-Bahn, because the whole S-Bahn concept would not have been possible without this new line together with the 4,968 metre-long Z√ºrichberg Tunnel and the 2,148 metre-long Hirschengraben Tunnel. Together with S-Bahn, the Z√ºrichberg line between Z√ºrich HB and Dietlikon/D√ºbendorf was opened for scheduled traffic on 27 May 1990. The track is double-track and electrified throughout. Neugut junction, where the line connects to the Wallisellen‚ÄìUster‚ÄìRapperswil railway, is designed with two single-track bridges so that the trains can branch off without crossing the opposite track. The Z√ºrichberg line is served by lines: * , , , and towards Dietlikon. * , , and branching to the Wallisellen‚ÄìUster‚ÄìRapperswil railway. * , , , and until Stadelhofen, continuing to the Lake Z√ºrich right-bank railway line. =Altstetten‚ÄìZ√ºrich HB‚ÄìOerlikon diameter line= To relieve the burden on the railway node Zurich, the Altstetten‚ÄìZ√ºrich‚ÄìOerlikon cross-city railway was built from 2007 to 2015. The formed with the Weinberg Tunnel a third connection between the Hauptbahnhof and Z√ºrich Oerlikon. Trains on this route stop at the Hauptbahnhof at a new underground section of the station called L√∂wenstrasse, which is designed as a though station in contrast to the above ground terminus. L√∂wenstrasse station and the Weinberg tunnel were commissioned for S-Bahn traffic in mid-2014. The bridges between Zurich HB and the Vorbahnhof (a shunting yard) at Zurich Altstetten only went into operation at the end of 2015. Proposals There are plans to build a tunnel to overcome the bottleneck between Effretikon and Winterthur. The Br√ºtten Tunnel would run from Bassersdorf to Winterthur. Due to the expected long construction period and high costs, a proposal to upgrade the existing line to at least four tracks has been examined. A similar plan to the Br√ºtten Tunnel proposal was proposed as a popular initiative by the VCS Verkehrs-Club der Schweiz (Swiss Association for Transport and Environment), Z√ºrich, but it was rejected by the voters of the Canton of Z√ºrich on 26 September 2010 with 70% against.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History The Michigan Avenue-Genesee Street District was developed in the latter half of the nineteenth century, as new businesses were developed in Owosso and fine craftsmen moved to the city. The district was located near the newly-established factories, and close to the booming commercial district, so both shopkeepers and craftsmen found the neighborhood a convenient place to live. As the neighborhood attracted a varied group of residents, the houses constructed embraced a range of sizes and styles. However, despite the heterogeneity of the buildings, they all exhibited fine craftsmanship. The quality of the houses ensured that the neighborhood lasted, well-cared-for, into the present day. Description The streets of the Michigan Avenue-Genesee Street neighborhood are narrow and some sections display brick pavers. The neighborhood is completely residential, containing residences of a modest size but architecturally sophisticated. The district contains 32 properties, all but one of which were constructed in the 19th century. Although a few Greek Revival houses are in the district, most houses reflect later styles, including Carpenter Gothic, Italianate, Queen Anne, Eastlake, and Georgian Revival styles. Significant Houses The significant houses in the neighborhood include: *Eli Gregor Residence (416 Genesee): This house, originally built in about 1860, is the oldest remaining structure in the neighborhood. The older portion of the home is a two story, three bay Greek Revival structure covered in clapboard. It has a gable roof, and porches on both the first and second floor. In the mid-1870s, Eli Gregory, then mayor of Owosso, added a 1-1/2 story French Second Empire section to the home. *North-Rigley Residence (220 Michigan): This house was first home to Granville North, part-owner of a furniture company. In about 1890, North sold it to Charles Rigley, president of the Estey Manufacturing Company. The house is a two-story, L-shaped Queen Anne home covered in clapboard. *Louis Hall Residence (304 Michigan): Businessman and grocer Louis Hall built this family home in 1893. It is a mix of Queen Anne And Georgian Revival styles, with an asymmetrical floorplan and facade. It is covered with clapboard, shingling, and tongue-in-groove siding. The front porch is supported by Ionic columns. *Samuel Gardner Residence (314 Michigan): This house is a modestly scaled but elaborately detailed Eastlake-style residence, constructed in about 1885. It has elaborate ornamentation around the windows and in the gable ends. A series of skilled craftspeople, managers, and businesspeople lived in this house; the first known of these is Samuel Gardner, who moved in some time before 1895.

He is best known for his intervention in the attempt to solve the Costa Concordia disaster in January 2012. Early life and education After graduating in Law at the University of Milan, in 1994 De Falco joined the Corps of the Port Captaincies in Leghorn, studying at the Naval Academy. Career In 2000, De Falco left Leghorn joining the Captaincy in Genoa. With the rank of lieutenant, De Falco was assigned the Command in Santa Margherita Ligure, where he stood from 2003 to 2005. = Costa Concordia disaster = On 13 January 2012, the Costa Concordia cruise ship, owned by the Costa Crociere shipping company and under the command of Captain Francesco Schettino, impacted a rock in the waters of Isola del Giglio, reporting the opening of a 70-meter-long hole on the left side, followed by the partial submersion of the ship. De Falco, who led the Captaincy in Leghorn, assumed the coordination of the rescues to the cruise unit in difficulty. During the radio and telephone communications between the operating room of the Livorno Captaincy and the Costa Concordia, taken by De Falco and Schettino, the naval officer ordered, in vain, for the captain of the Costa Concordia, who had abandoned ship, to return to the vessel. De Falco's order Vada a bordo, cazzo! () became very popular. = Political career = De Falco ran for a seat in the Senate with the Five Star Movement in the 2018 general election and was elected. He was a member of the left-wing of the Movement and is considered to be very close to the President of the Chamber of Deputies Roberto Fico. On 31 December 2018, De Falco was expelled from the Movement after being accused of having violated the code of ethics of the Movement several times.

Live and career  Born in New York City, Borkin studied economics at New York University (B.A. and M.A.) and law at National University School of Law in Washington, D.C. Initially, Borkin worked for the US Congress und for a committee of investigations of the US Senate on allegations of corruption against the munitions industry. In 1938, he entered the service of the Department of Justice, Antitrust Division as a Special Assistant to the Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold. Early 1943, he published together with Charles Welsh a populist pamphlet against German and international cartels: Germanys Master Plan : The Story of Industrial Offensive. This book combined a middle-class typical aversion against big business with a highly patriotic orientation. The work became a bestseller, was sold in unchanged editions (including a Chinese translation) up to 1946, and even film rights had been sold.Abramson, Victor (1943): \\"[Review of] Borkin, Joseph; Welsh, Charles A.: Germany's Master Plan: The Story of Industrial Offensive, 1943.

Edwards and Wendell Berge of 1944 ‚Äì the first mayor American pamphlet against international cartels. This was a radical position of the Roosevelt-progressives, who were strong in the American political scene between 1943 and 1946. But their position was answered back from the conservative as well as from the Marxist side as being unrealistic or, respectively, imperialist.De Haas, Jacob Anton (1944): International cartels in the postwar world. New York [u. a.]: American Enterprise Assoc.Allen, James S. (1946): World monopoly and peace. New York: International Publishers. The 'grey eminence' behind the campaign seems to have been Thurman Arnold, who had been driven out of his post as head of the Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, by Franklin D. Roosevelt. Until 1946, he was chief economist in the Antitrust agency and worked on the German IG Farben concern and its international cartel connections. Subsequently, he worked as a freelance lawyer and economic advisor and was affiliated with the office of Lawler, Kent & Eisenberg. He took over a lecture on business ethics at Catholic University of America. In 1978, he published his occupationally collected insights into the history of I.G. Farben under the title The Crime and Punishment of I.G. Farben. Borkin was member of several professional associations of lawyers and also member of the American Economic Association and of the National Press Club. He also published about literary works, on Sigmund Freud and on the Indonese language, as well as a book about the effectiveness of antitrust prosecutions and one about the role of the lawyer in the Watergate scandal remained uncompleted.

At the time, it was the world's largest floating dry dock and used primarily to service the ships and submarines of the Northern Fleet. The long and wide floating dock was owned by and stationed at Roslyakovo near Murmansk. In November 2018, the dock sank after a power outage while holding the Admiral Kuznetsov.  History  Admiral Kuznetsov dry- docked in PD-50, June 2015 In March 1978, G√∂taverken Arendal shipyard in Gothenburg, Sweden was awarded a contract for the construction of the world's largest floating dry dock for the Soviet Union. While the company had previously built mainly oil tankers and bulk carriers, it was struggling for new orders after demand for one of its main product had dwindled following the 1973 oil crisis, and bidding for the dry dock was one of the attempts to diversify the shipyard's portfolio. With delivery time agreed as 18 months from signing the contract, the work was split between two shipyards in order to speed up the construction: G√∂taverken Arendal would build five of the seven sections while the nearby Eriksbergs Mekaniska Verkstad would supply the remaining two parts, and the sections would be joined together afloat using underwater welding. The floating dock was named PD-50 (); \\"PD\\" being short for \\"Plavuchiy Dok\\" (; literally \\"floating dock\\"). In August 1979, the nearly- finished PD-50 was towed to open sea for trials. During the final test, which involved finding out how fast the submerged dock could be deballasted, two ballast water tanks partially collapsed due to underpressure. The floating dry dock was hastily towed back to Arendal with visible denting on the shell plating and the shipyard workers scrambled to fix the damage. The repairs were completed in early September and PD-50 was handed over to the customer. On 22 September 1979, PD-50 began its delivery voyage to Murmansk under tow by two Dutch tugboats, Smit Rotterdam and Smit London. On 3 October, after sailing around the Norwegian coast, the floating dry dock broke free in a storm and was blown ashore on the Soviet side of the Norwegian border. The grounding of the brightly-illuminated PD-50 was witnessed by Soviet border guards who later described the incident as if a small city had appeared from the sea, only to be driven on the rocks by the storm. While the damage to the grounded dry dock was extensive, PD-50 was deemed repairable. After refloating, it was towed first to Kirkenes and later to a shipyard in Stord. The repairs included lifting PD-50 fully out from water using pontoons and replacing 4,000tonnes of steel. In September 1980, one year after the grounding, PD-50 finally reached Murmansk. On 29 December 2011, Russian Delta IV-class nuclear submarine caught fire while being docked in PD-50. The fire was extinguished by partially submerging PD-50 twice while K-84 was atop it. In 2013, the Russian oil company Rosneft took over Shipyard No. 82 and its assets, including PD-50, in preparation of turning the old naval shipyard into a base for the company's Arctic operations. This has caused an outrage in the naval circles as the shipyard was one of the few in Russia with facilities capable of docking the country's largest surface vessels. On 30 October 2018, Russian aircraft carrier was damaged when PD-50 suddenly sank under it, and one of the dock's 70-ton cranes crashed onto the ship's flight deck. One shipyard worker went missing and four others required medical attention, one of whom later died in hospital.  Replacement  In July 2019, Zvezdochka Ship Repair Center JSC and St. Petersburg company Investments Engineering Construction (I.I.S.) signed a contract for reconstruction and modernization of the Shipyard No. 35 located in Murmansk. As part of the RUB20 billion (US$311.5 million) deal, two adjacent dry docks at the plant will be merged into one joint dock by a demolition of a partition between them and walls, slipways and other dock equipment will be modernized. After the modernization, it will be the largest dry dock in Russia, capable of docking Russia's sole aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov as well as other country's largest vessels, such as the battlecruiser . As of December 2019, the work on reconstruction of the shipyard was underway.

Captures Augusta, of Saint-Malo, and of 14 guns and 120 men, sailed from Saint-Malo on 29 November 1812 in the company of four other privateers. On 3 December she captured four vessels near the Isles of Scilly. the four were: Cape Breton, Breard, master, Providence, Leggett, master, Mary, Baxter, master, and Sparkler, Brown, master. Cape Breton and Providence had been sailing from Cape Breton to Jersey. Mary had been sailing from Prince Edward Island to London, and Sparkler had been sailing from Cadiz to London. Mary was carrying a cargo of wood and Auguste gave her up; she arrived at Cork on 8 December. Cape Breton escaped. Auguste put the crews of the three other vessels aboard Mary, which arrived at Plymouth on 30 December. In December Augusta captured three vessels: Catherine, Harmony, and Guardian. Catherine, Blyth, master, had been sailing from Suriname to London, and Harmony, Gallop, master, had been sailing from Newfoundland to Poole. Guardian, Musgrave, master, had also been sailing from Suriname to London. On 16 December, Augusta, of 16 guns and 110 men, boarded Union, Tweddell, master, at . Augusta had been out of Saint-Malo 16 days. Union, which had been sailing from Prince Edward Island, arrived at Liverpool. On 24 December recaptured Harmony, and the next day Catherine. The recaptured vessels arrived at Plymouth on 1 and 2 January 1813. On 5 January 1813 Lloyd's List reported that Foxhound had recaptured Harmony and Catherine, and that Favorite had recaptured Guardian and sent her into Plymouth. On 15 February 1813, Auguste sighted a vessel in Cherbourg Roads to which she gave chase. This was Mary, \\"Hudges\\" (Hodges), master, which had been sailing from Jamaica to London. Mary was carrying sugar, coffee, rum, and other colonial produce, and Auguste brought her into Havre two days later. Lloyd's List reported that an (unnamed) French privateer had captured Mary. It further reported that the privateer had captured several other vessels, but that as a result of recent gales two had been lost between Barfleur and Cherbourg, and two had been driven on shore near Havre. On 15 November Auguste, of Saint-Malo, and of 110 men and 14 guns, was off The Lizard when she captured Frederick, Storey, master. Frederick had been sailing from Seville and Lisbon to London; Auguste took her into Paimpol. Her cargo of wool sold for Fr.600,000. On 18 November Auguste took into Saint-Malo and English brig of about 200 tons (bm). The brig had been sailing from Dublin with a cargo of linens and provisions. Augusta also took into Brehat an English vessel of 100 tons (bm) that was carrying a cargo of Segovia wool. On 18 December Auguste was off The Lizard when she captured two vessels. Mary, Crow, master, had been sailing from Newfoundland to Dartmouth when captured, and Endeavour, Turner, master, had been sailing from Newfoundland to Teignmouth.

Formerly a country estate, it was visited by William Makepeace Thackeray, Charles Dickens and Seamus Heaney and may have been the inspiration for Narnia in the writings of C. S. Lewis. It came into the ownership of the Bowes-Lyon family, and the future Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret holidayed there as children. The park has been run by Newry, Mourne and Down District Council since 1977 and features a children's play area, tennis courts and a cafe. It has a large collection of rare and historic trees, including \\"Old Homer\\", a holm oak that was voted Northern Ireland's Tree of the Year in 2016. A glacial erratic in the park is connected with the legend of the giant Finn Mac Cool.  History  Park drive The park was originally known as The Meadow and formed part of the large Ross Family estate in Rostrevor from the early 1700s ‚Äì their house, known as The Lodge was built in 1716. One of the more famous members of that family was General Robert Ross, who served in the British Army during the Napoleonic Wars and was responsible for the burning of the White House in the War of 1812. The Ross family were responsible for planting many of the non-native trees that are still found in the area including redwood, Monterey pine, holm oak, ash, sycamore and cherry. The park was purchased by Colonel Roxburgh in 1850; William Makepeace Thackeray is thought to have visited at around this time and drawn inspiration from the landscape. Thackeray remarked that had the estate been located in England it would be widely regarded as \\"a world's wonder\\". Roxburgh sold the estate to Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe ‚Äì a diplomat and scholar ‚Äì in 1863, and he added a zoo, aviary and arboretum. Canning was friends with the writer Charles Dickens, who was a frequent guest at the estate. A second cousin of Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (later Queen to George VI) inherited the estate in 1919. The future Queen Elizabeth II and her sister Princess Margaret holidayed on the estate in 1937. The queen is said to have remembered it well when asked about it decades later. During the Second World War the estate served as a camp for German prisoners of war. Kilbroney was later visited by the writer C. S. Lewis and may have helped provide the inspiration for the land of Narnia and subsequently by poet Seamus Heaney. The Bowes-Lyon family sold Kilbroney to the local council in 1977. They demolished the lodge in 1980 but a plan to develop part of the estate for housing was abandoned after local people threatened to handcuff themselves to the park gates in protest. It is currently in the ownership of Newry, Mourne and Down District Council, is open as a public park and designated as an open space amenity.  Description  Cloughmore Stone Landscape Kilbroney Park is located off the A2 Shore Road, with a pedestrian entrance accessible by footpath from Rostrevor. The park features a two-mile forest drive leading to the car park and expansive views across the nearby Carlingford Lough and the Mourne Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The park has a children's play area, tennis courts, cafe and a tourist information point and is open from 9 am. There are two caravan parks on site, a mountain bike trail and a Narnia-themed walking trail. Located above Rostrevor is the Cloughmore Stone, a 30-tonne glacial erratic left behind after the ice age. Local folklore holds that the stone was thrown there by the Irish giant Finn Mac Cool during a fight with a Scottish giant. The Scottish giant is said to have created Lough Neagh by scooping a clod of earth from the ground. Having missed Mac Cool this clod landed in the Irish Sea where it became the Isle of Man. Kilbroney Park is set within the wider Rostrevor Oak Forest ‚Äì a 16.63 hectare ancient woodland, national nature reserve and special area of conservation ‚Äì and as well as oak, ash, hazel, sycamore, douglas fir, ferns, wild garlic, primroses and bluebells, contains rarer plants and trees. These include wood avens, the hard shield fern, giant fir, eight monkey puzzle trees, twelve redwoods (planted by Canning between 1880 and 1890), toothwort, bird's nest orchids and wood fescue. Notable individual trees include a 500-year-old sessile oak, a 200-year-old Monterey pine and a 200-year-old Turkey oak, which is said to be the most photographed tree in the park.  Old Homer  A 200-year-old Quercus ilex (holm oak) tree known as \\"Old Homer\\" is located near to the park's pedestrian entrance at Fairy Glen. Famous for growing at a 45-degree angle from the ground, which makes it easy for children to climb, it is said to have been well loved by generations of local people. The evergreen tree is almost in girth and has distinctive \\"snakeskin\\" bark; one of its boughs was recently propped to prevent collapse. The tree has links to folk music ‚Äì it is the site of performances during the park's \\"Fiddler's Green\\", and the ashes of Scottish folk singer Danny Kyle were scattered beneath the tree. Old Homer was entered into the Northern Irish Tree of the Year competition in 2016; it secured more than half of the votes cast and won the competition. The ¬£1,000 winner's grant was used to fund plaques for historic trees in the park, produce a book about the trees and to purchase 400 saplings, which were planted across the park by schoolchildren. As a result of the win it was entered into the European Tree of the Year for 2017. It garnered 7,101 vote and placed sixth out of 16 trees.

She was known as the \\"mother of the Flemish Movement\\".Schrijfster en mecenas in het katholiek meisjesonderwijs - Writer and patron in Catholic girls' education schrijversgewijs.be, accessed 17 November 2019  Life  The daughter of Alphonse Belpaire and Betsy Teichmann, she was born in Antwerp and grew up in the home of her maternal grandfather Jan Teichmann, who served as governor of Antwerp province. Taught by private teachers, she learned several languages and read Romantic literature written in French, German and English but soon became interested in Flemish literature. She supported higher education for women, founding the , a Catholic school for young professional women, and the Extension universitaire pour les femmes, university education for women. She also supported young musicians and writers in their work. She lobbied in support of equality for Dutch-speaking Belgians and official bilingualism (French and Dutch). During World War I, she co-founded De Belgische Standaard, a Flemish newspaper at the Yser Front. She also defended the rights of Flemish soldiers, who served under French-speaking officers who did not speak their language. With Catholic priest , she founded the Eigen Leven society to promote the Flemish Movement from a Catholic perspective. One important initiative was the merger of two existing Flemish literary publications, Dietsche Warande and Het Belfort, into the Dietsche Warande en Belfort journal, which was founded in 1900 and is still active. In the beginning, the new journal was mainly financed by Belpaire herself and she was also a contributor. Belpaire published a number of essays, including studies on Ludwig van Beethoven and Dickens. She supported a Christian ideal of art, where art brings together truth and beauty, and so did not agree with more modern movements in literature. She published a three volume history of her relatives De families Teichmann en Belpaire (1925-34) and her own memoir Gestalten in 't verleden [Figures in the past] (1947). She translated a number of literary works by Scandinavian authors into Dutch, including four by Johannes J√∏rgensen, one by Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson and some fairy tales by Hans Christian Andersen.

It has a blueberry farm, a winery, the Senton Sawmill, a fire station, a petrol station and a hall. It is in the Hukanui Waerenga Ward of Waikato District Council. 1 to 250,000 geology map  Geology  Pukemokemoke hill is formed of greywacke of the Jurassic Manaia Hill Group (shown as Jm on map). The rest of the Whitikahu area is largely on a drained peat bog, which lies on ash from Lake Taupo. Taupiri Fault is an inferred fault separating the peat from the Taupiri Range. Seismic testing in 2017 added evidence of the fault's position. Whitikahu is at the north end of an alluvial fan of the ash, which drops about 60 m (200 ft) from Karapiro. After the Oruanui eruption, some 26,500 years ago, Lake Taupo was about 145 m (476 ft) above the present lake. Around 22,500 years ago the ash dam eroded rapidly and the lake fell about 75 m (246 ft) in a few weeks, creating a series of massive floods. The ash they carried formed the main Hinuera Surface (Q2a) into the fan. From then until about 17,600 years ago the Waikato would have been about 25 m (82 ft) higher than at present due to aggradation, resulting from remobilisation of pyroclastic material from Taupo, deposited as well-bedded, creamy-white pumice sands, silts and gravels with charcoal fragments. One of its channels from that period followed the Mangawara Stream via the present air-gap at Mangawara. This earlier gorge was buried beneath alluvium but has since been partly re-exposed by the Mangawara Stream as the Waikato has deepened Taupiri gorge. The Waikato eroded its present valley for about 3,500 years, at a time when the sea was around 100 m (330 ft) below its present level. The Walton Sub-Group (eQa) of pumiceous fine- grained sand and silt with interbedded peat, pumiceous gravelly sand, diatomaceous mud, and non-welded ignimbrite and tephra formed low hills, up to 50 m above the Hamilton Basin plain, on and around which younger sediments have been deposited. In this area they are named the Puketoka Formation. It is highly pumiceous, and, due to silica case-hardening, is able to form vertical bluffs, now weathered, eroded, dissected and largely buried by younger sediments. Taupo Formation (Q1a) was laid down in the trench cut through the Hinuera surface. Taupo Formation alluvium is the top layer on which most of the peat bogs formed.  History and culture=Pre-European history= From the 1600s: Ngati Koura and Ngati Wairere Waikai occupied the area, mainly for eel fishing. An old waka was discovered in 1937. =European settlement= After the invasion of the Waikato, the area was confiscated in 1863 and cut up into lots for the military settlers, though deemed too swampy for occupation. In 1873 the Tauhei Block was returned to the hap≈´ to farm. Much of the area was in the Eureka Estate, which the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency bought from the government in 1874. It was then owned by the Waikato Land Association, later known as NZ Land Association. Its extended from Te Hoe to Tauwhare and Tamahere. In 1876 Whitikahu was described as a deep swamp, but a condition of the sale was that NZLMA should build drains and roads. Kauri gum was being dug in 1893, when about half the area had been drained. Kauri stumps of up to diameter and long are thought to have died due to flooding after the Waikato changed its course. =20th century= Flax was milled in the area from 1890 until a 1908 fire and again from 1918. A new Orini mill opened in 1936 and flax was still being grown in 1938, when there was another fire. The drained peat has also caught fire from time to time. By 1912 over 30 voters were recorded, there was a twice-weekly post delivery and there were three sheep farms. Electricity came in 1923. A hall was built and a bus service to Hamilton, started in 1937 and was still running in 1964 and into the 1970s. =Marae= The local Tauhei Marae and its MƒÅramatutahi meeting ground are a traditional meeting place of the Waikato Tainui hap≈´ of NgƒÅti Makirangi and NgƒÅti Wairere. In October 2020, the Government committed $95,664 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade the Tauhei Marae, creating an estimated 7 jobs.  Demographics  Whitkahu census area was reduced in 2018 by loss of areas to Huntly rural The statistical area of Whitikahu, which at 254 square kilometres is much larger than the settlement, also covers Orini and Netherton. It had a population of 1,968 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 84 people (4.5%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 174 people (9.7%) since the 2006 census. There were 645 households. There were 990 males and 975 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.02 males per female. The median age was 33.8 years, with 495 people (25.2%) aged under 15 years, 384 (19.5%) aged 15 to 29, 921 (46.8%) aged 30 to 64, and 168 (8.5%) aged 65 or older. Ethnicities were 81.9% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 13.1% MƒÅori, 1.4% Pacific peoples, 12.0% Asian, and 2.1% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). The proportion of people born overseas was 15.9%, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 51.7% had no religion, 30.2% were Christian, 2.0% were Hindu, 0.3% were Muslim, 0.6% were Buddhist and 7.6% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 225 (15.3%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 288 (19.6%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $40,600. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 846 (57.4%) people were employed full-time, 276 (18.7%) were part-time, and 45 (3.1%) were unemployed.  Education  Whitikahu School opened in 1911. It is a primary school for years 1 to 8 with students as of and now has a swimming pool, tennis courts, playgrounds, sports fields, a multi-purpose room, library and multi-media suite.  Drainage  The drainage begun by NZLMA was continued by drainage boards set up under the Land Drainage Act 1908 and the Taupiri Drainage and River Board Empowering Act, 1936. By 1926 some of it was described as fine dairying land. In the 1930s the board aimed to drain the whole of the wetland. With government grants, they used unemployed workers to drain an area south of Te Hoe and create roads and farms from 1936 to 1938. However, although drains, floodgates and dams were built, flooding remains a problem. The Mangatea Catchment Restoration Project, led by Tauhei Marae, aims to reduce pollution of the local streams which run into the Waikato River. of fencing beside the Mangawara and Tauhei streams will reduce pollutants entering them.  Pukemokemoke Bush Reserve  Since 1990 Pukemokemoke Bush Trust has been restoring the reserve, which rises to above Whitikahu, which is at about . The greywacke here is of the Jurassic Manaia Hill Group. The hill was logged by Roose Shipping Co from 1949, into the 1950s, but kauri, mataƒ´, kahikatea, rimu, t≈çtara, tawa, rewarewa, titoki, pukatea and taraire remain and about 15,000 native trees have replaced privet and other weeds. 110 species were listed in 1962. The neighbouring Tauhei quarry has been owned by Fulton Hogan since 2016. It was formerly operated by Perry Group for Waikato District Council. Production was increased to supply aggregates for the Waikato Expressway in 2017 and 2018.

Childhood, education and career in the German Reich  Kronstein came from a respected and wealthy Jewish family of Karlsruhe. He did his military service in the First World War and suffered a severe wound. Later he began studying law in Heidelberg and Berlin. Kronstein received his doctorate in 1924 from Martin Wolff in Berlin. He then worked as a lawyer in Mannheim, where he founded in 1931 together with Wilhelm Zutt the law firm \\"Kronstein Zutt\\" and specialized in patent law. Until 1935 he was still able to work as a lawyer in Germany, inter alias in the settlement of the sale of Jewish companies (\\"Aryanization\\").Stiefel, Ernst C.; Mecklenburg, Frank (1991): Deutsche Juristen im amerikanischen Exil (1933‚Äì1950).

He studied law in New York from 1936 (Columbia University) with a Bachelor of Laws degree. In 1939 he moved to Washington D.C., graduated in 1940 at the Georgetown University Law School in Washington a second time, made in 1941 the \\"bar exam\\" for international law and became \\"Professor of Comparative Law.\\" Since 1936, Kronstein worked as a freelancer for the U.S. Department of Justice as a translator and appraiser.

Because of his special knowledge of patent law and patent cartels and because of his background being from Germany Kronstein served in the Ministry of Justice as a cartel expert. To do this, in 1941/1942 he moved to the Antitrust division under Thurman Arnold. From the beginning on, he did important work for this division: In front of the Senate Commission on Patent Affairs Kronstein suggested that the cartelized economic structure of Germany had facilitated Hitler the seizure of power.Freyer, Tony Allan (2006): Antitrust and Global Capitalism, 1930‚Äì2004.

Trajano's parents (to whom she is an only daughter) owned a retail store in Franca under brand name Magazine Luiza. Trajano worked in various departments such as sales, purchase and management, prior to becoming the company's director-superintendent in 1991.Virtude rende lucros. √âpoca, March 2009, p. 74 Under her chairpersonship, Magazine Luiza became a chain of over 1,000 stores scattered throughout 18 Brazilian states with over 18 million clients and 27 thousand employees, as well as a publicly traded company. During Brazil's 2018 presidential election, Trajano held a Q&A; session with several candidates. The eventual winning candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, did not attend. Shortly afterwards, Bolsonaro tweeted 'Who's Luiza Trajano anyway?' Reports emerged that he had resented being excluded by the organisation for failing to confirm participation in time. =Role in promoting women's empowerment= Trajano is the chairperson of non- governmental organisation Grupo Mulheres do Brasil (Women of Brazil), founded in 2013 by 40 Brazilian women entrepreneurs. The organisation is dedicated to promoting equal rights, work, safety, health and education for all. Over 48,000 women across 14 countries are currently associated with Women of Brazil. In 2017, the femicide of Magazine Luiza store manager Denise Neves dos Anjos, who then was 37 with 13 of service, by her husband shocked Trajano and made her not only become vocal about domestic violence, but take action within her company, whose workforce is 50% female. Trajano is reported as creating a domestic violence hotline for workers (including male workers), with the company providing counselling and legal assistance, mapping relocation opportunities and alerting the authorities. Also, outsourced workforce providers for Magazine Luiza were required to employ at least 2% of abused women so they could get financial independence which can be an important step towards leaving an abusive husband. \\"I have asked my friends to report, instead of turning a blind eye...women's condition has made incredible progress, but we still have to fight for equal pay, for instance. And violence is something we cannot tolerate,\\" Trajano said at the time. Trajano favours quotas for women on company boards, claiming the situation in Brazil is such that it will take 100 years for boards to have 20% or 30% of women if no quotas are adopted. She mentions her aunt (the founder of Magazine Luiza) and late mother as inspirations. =Views on and role in affirmative action= In September 2020, Magazine Luiza announced its 2021 trainee program would be open to black candidates only. Trajano said it was 'an important step towards consolidating our corporate diversity.'https://twitter.com/luizatrajano/status/1307317220528324609 The program will also be waiving English skills and previous work experience requirements. The announcement sparked controversy and met with opposition from conservative quarters. For instance, Jair Bolsonaro's government deputy leader in the Chamber of Deputies said he was personally filing a complaint with thePublic Prosecutor's Office on account of 'racism.' According to Trajano: 'Our colour-blind programs never worked...we know people will sue, but we'll keep on track. We will fight and we won't give up that easily.' In 2019, Trajano had stated racial inequality 'is still a very serious thing. We have only one Black female chairperson of a major Brazilian corporation...and our struggle now is to have Black female directors, chairpersons...but also males, to have them hold heftier positions within enterprises.' On 21 September 2020, highlighting criticism of the trainee program was expected yet not \\"as aggressive,\\" she added: \\"We did not intend to change Brazil, only our company...we respect dissenting points of view...what we feel is it isn't easy for people to understand systemic racism and sexism.\\" And: \\"We are really happy to break the taboo.\\" Awards Trajano was elected Person of the Year 2020 by the Brazilian American Chamber of Commerce.

History The grounds were originally the site of Eardisley Castle. A deer park was established during the medieval period for the Baskerville family. The castle was razed after the English Civil War. In 1777 the estate was mentioned in the Pipe Roll, when the manor, the castle and the park passed to the King upon the death of Sir Richard Baskerville of Duncumb. In the 19th century the estate was in the possession of the Perry family; Thomas Perry was the manor owner in 1837, and James Perry as of 1890. House William Barnesley or Barnsley, a London cloth merchant, built the original Queen Anne house in the early 18th century after purchasing the estate. The attic was converted into an additional storey later in the century. The house was a Grade II* listed building but shortly after restoration burnt down in January 1999. A near replica on the site, using inside bricks facing outwards and old flooring, wall panelling and fittings sourced elsewhere and adding modern systems and steel beams for floor support, was completed in late 2001 and named the Georgian Restoration of the Year in 2003 and the Restoration of the Century for the West Region by Country Life in 2010. Bow windows were added to the front and rear facades in a style suggesting late 18th century additions. The original brick barns and Grade II listed Georgian dovecote survived the fire and rebuilding included restoration of the garden terraces, which had been worked as part of the farm for the previous century. A legal dispute over the original house following Barnesley's death in 1760 was reportedly the inspiration for Charles Dickens's novel Bleak House.

Taxonomy In 1901, Oldfield Thomas described two skins of Ruwenzori colobus zoological specimens that were collected at the northwestern slopes of the Ruwenzori Mountains in Bwamba Country of western Uganda. Thomas considered it a species using the scientific name Colobus ruwenzorii. Characteristics The Ruwenzori colobus is black with hair on the shoulders between long. Its tail is also black and greyish-white at the end. It has white bushy tufts on the cheeks. The white hair on the forehead forms a crest. Distribution and habitat The Ruwenzori colobus occurs at Lake Nabugabo in Uganda. Troops of 300 to 400 individuals inhabit Rwanda's Nyungwe National Park. Some authors reports indicate that it perhaps also occurs in some Tanzanian regions. Ecology and behaviour The Ruwenzori colobus is a highly arboreal and acrobatic leaf-eater. Its diet consists of about two thirds of leaves and one third of fruit and seeds. Although all Colobus species are very sociable, they usually move on the troops of several hundred animals.

He was one of the most promising two-year-olds of his generation in 2017 when he won the Vintage Stakes but disappointed on his final start in the Dewhurst Stakes. In 2018 he won the Jersey Stakes and City of York Stakes and was placed in the Greenham Stakes, Sussex Stakes and Prix du Moulin before recording his biggest win in the Breeders' Cup Mile. Background Expert Eye is a bay colt with a small white star and three white coronet marks bred in England by his owner Khalid Abullah's Juddmonte Farms. He was sent into training with Michael Stoute at his Freemason Lodge stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. He was sired by Acclamation, a high-class sprinter who won the Diadem Stakes in 2003 and whose other progeny have included Dark Angel Marsha and Equiano. Expert Eye's dam Exemplify showed modest racing ability, winning one minor race from four starts in France, but was a half-sister to Special Duty and a female-line descendant of Chris Evert was closely related to Chief's Crown and Winning Colors. Racing career=2017: two-year-old season= Expert Eye began his racing career in a minor race over six and a half furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 15 June and started at odds of 6/1 in a nine-runner field. Ridden by Ryan Moore he overtook the favourite Mutakatif in the final furlong and won \\"readily\\" by one and a half lengths. On 1 August the colt was stepped up in class for the Group 2 Vintage Stakes over seven furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse in which he was ridden by Andrea Atzeni and was made the 7/4 ahead of nine opponents. After racing in mid-division, Expert Eye took the lead approaching the last quarter mile and drew away to win in \\"impressive\\" style by four and a half lengths from Zaman. Following the race Atzeni said \\"He was very good. He settled nicely, but approaching three out we'd gone slow and he took off, I ended up getting there way too soon. I wasn't hard on him and when I picked him up he galloped out really well. I don't think I've sat on many two-year-olds like this\\". The form of the race was subsequently franked as Seahenge (fourth) and James Garfield (fifth) won the Champagne Stakes and the Mill Reef Stakes respectively. Expert Eye was made the ante-post favourite for the 2018 2000 Guineas but missed a scheduled appearance in the National Stakes after he was found to have contracted a minor respiratory infection. On 14 October Expert Eye was made the 4/7 favourite for the Group 1 Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse when he was again ridden by Atzeni. After racing in second place he faded badly in the last quarter mile and came home last of the nine runners behind U S Navy Flag. He finished the race lame. =2018: three-year-old season= Expert Eye began his second campaign in the Greenham Stakes (a major trial race for the 2000 Guineas) run over seven furlongs at Newbury on 21 April. Ridden by Atzeni, he started favourite but despite finishing strongly he failed by three quarters of a length to catch James Garfield. In the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket two weeks later he made little impression, coming home tenth behind Saxon Warrior after being hampered a furlong out. In both of his first two races of 2018 Expert Eye became upset in the starting stalls. At Royal Ascot in June the colt was dropped back in class and distance for the Group 3 Jersey Stakes over seven furlongs in which he was ridden by James McDonald and started at 8/1. After being restrained towards the rear of the 21-runner field he began to make progress in the last quarter mile took the lead inside the final furlong and accelerated away from his rivals to win by four and a half lengths from Society Power. McDonald commented that the winner \\"felt like a rocket ship\\" while Michael Stoute said \\"He was such a good two-year-old and then things went wrong in the Dewhurst. I‚Äôm just so thrilled to see him back to this sort of form\\". At Goodwood on 1 August he was matched against older horses for the first time in the Sussex Stakes. He tracked the leaders before going to the front in the straight but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten one and a half lengths into second by the seven-year-old Lightning Spear. Twenty- four days later the colt dropped back to Group 3 class for the City of York Stakes over seven furlongs at York Racecourse in which he was partnered for the first time by Frankie Dettori. Starting the even money favourite he took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by one and a quarter lengths from the ten-year-old Gordon Lord Byron. Stoute commented \\"He's very nice and relaxed. The stalls' situation has been resolved. He goes in better than ever now and he's very relaxed when he's in there. He seems in a good frame of mind. We just need to eke out a little more improvement. He's not too far off Group 1 class now\\". Expert Ey at the 2018 Breeders' Cup On 9 September at Longchamp Racecourse Expert Eye was made the 5.3/1 third choice in the betting for the Group 1 Prix du Moulin over 1600 metres. With Moore in the saddle he finished strongly to take third place behind Recoletos and Wind Chimes. For his final run of the year the colt was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Mile at Churchill Downs on 3 November. With Dettori in the saddle he was made the 9/2 favourite ahead of thirteen opponents including Oscar Performance, Happily, Lightning Spear, Clemmie, I Can Fly (runner-up in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes), Next Shares (Shadwell Turf Mile Stakes) and One Master (Prix de la For√™t). After racing towards the rear, Expert Eye move up on the outside on the final turn and made his challenge in the straight. He looked unlikely to take a hand in the finish but began to rapid progress in the final furlong, took the lead in the final strides and won by half a length and a neck from Catapult and Analyze It. Dettori said \\"He broke well but then he took a false step and lost his position and I had to look for a plan B. As we got in to the straight, I asked him to pick up and the response wasn‚Äôt there for about 100m. I felt we were going to be a good fifth, and then he just managed to find his rhythm and I could see the leaders stopping. In the last 100 yards, he really got down and sprinted home. I went from despair to joy in the space of 100 yards\\". Six days after his Breeders‚Äô Cup victory it was announced that Expert Eye had been retired from racing and would begin his career as a breeding stallion at the Banstead Manor Stud in 2019 at a fee of ¬£20,000.

Agency, therefore, implies the ability to perceive and to change the environment of the agent, but crucially, it also entails intentionality to represent the goal-state in the future, equifinal variability to be able to achieve the intended goal- state with different actions in different contexts, and rationality of actions in relation to their goal to produce the most efficient action available. Cognitive scientists and psychologists thoroughly investigated agency attribution in humans and non-human animals, since social cognitive mechanisms as communication, social learning, imitation or theory of mind presupposes the ability to identify agents and differentiate them from inanimate objects. This ability has also assumed to have a major effect on inferential and predictive processes of the observers of agents, because agentive entities are expected to perform autonomous behavior based on their current and previous knowledge and intentions, while inanimate objects are supposed to react to external physical forces. Although it is often confused, sensitivity to agency and the sense of agency are different concepts as the sensitivity to agency can be explained as a cognitive ability to identify agentive entities in the environment, while the sense of agency refers to the sense of control and sometimes to self-efficacy, which is a learnt belief of an individual about his or her own ability to succeed in specific situations.  Theoretical approaches of agency  According to Carey and Spelke the cognitive models explaining specific perceptual and representational abilities, for instance the models of agency recognition, can be separated into two different classes. The feature-based models of agency assume that the perceptual input of an observer consist of featural and behavioral cues that help to identify agents. Previous studies show that even very young human observers are sensitive to * self-propulsion, * non-rigid transformation of the object‚Äôs surface, * irregular path movement, * causation at a distance, * contingent turn-taking reactivity. However, neither of these cues are necessary and sufficient to identify an agent, since unfamiliar, novel entities like animated figures or robots without human features can elicit agency attribution in humans. Therefore, cognitive models belonging to the principle-based approaches were designed to describe how humans perceive agency assuming that the detection of agency is not a precondition, but a consequence of inferential processes about potentially agentive objects. The theory of teleological stance proposes that from 12-month of age humans can apply the principle of rational action to determine, whether the observed entity is an agent or an inanimate object expecting that an agent behaves rationally in order to achieve its goal in a given situation. The theory assumes that the rationality principle makes observers able to relate the action, the represented goal-state and the current situational constraints to decide whether an object is an agent. For instance, if infants had learnt that an abstract, unfamiliar agent (an animated circle on a display) approaches another entity by jumping over an obstacle, when the obstacle had been removed, they expected a new, but highly rational behavior from the agent to approach the other entity via a straight pathway. In contrast, when infants were shown that the unfamiliar entity always made a detour when approaching its goal-object exhibiting non- justifiable behavior of jumping in the absence of an obstacle, they did not expect a rational of choice of behavior when the situational constraints changed. These results and later empirical studies underpinned that agency recognition in humans can be explained by principle-based models rather than simple perceptual cues. As Gergely and Csibra concluded from 12-month of age humans ‚Äúcan take the teleological stance to interpret actions as means to goals, can evaluate the relative efficiency of means by applying the principle of rational action, and can generate systematic inferences to identify relevant aspects of the situation to justify the action as an efficient means even when these aspects are not directly visible to them\\".  Types of agents  It was proposed that the representation of agency can be based on the sensitivity to different abilities observed in agentive entities probably in humans and perhaps in non-human species as well. In humans, the species- specific social environment allows to identify agents either based on their intentional behavior, on their non-communicative, rational, goal-directed actions or by recognizing their communicative abilities. In non-human species, however, besides these types of input information unfamiliar agents can be identified simply on the basis of their perceptual abilities, which has context-dependent effect on their behavior even in the absence a visible goal- object that may be required to assess the efficiency of goal-approach. = Instrumental agency = According to Gergely instrumental agents are intentional agents that exhibit actions in order to realize their goal states in the environment. The recognition of instrumental agents is investigated by numerous experiments in human infants, and also in non-human apes. These studies reveal that when an agent exhibits an instrumental action it is expected by human infants to achieve its goal in an efficient manner, which is rational in terms of efforts in a given context. On the other hand it is also expected by infants that an agent should have a clear goal-state to be achieved. = Communicative agency = In contrast to instrumental agents, communicative agents are intentional agents whose actions are performed to bring about a specific change in the mental representations of the addressee, for instance by providing new and relevant information. The recognition of communicative agency may allow for the observer to predict that communicative information transfer can have a relevant effect on the behavior of the agent, even if the interacting agents and their communicative signals are unfamiliar. Communicative agents are assumed to be a subset of intentional agents, since all the communicative agents are intentional by definition, however, it is not necessary that all the intentional agents possess communicative capabilities. = Navigational agency = The construal of navigational agency is based on the assumption that Leslie‚Äôs theory on agency implies two different types of distal sensitivity; distal sensitivity in space and distal sensitivity in time. While goal-directed instrumental agents need both of these abilities to represent a goal-state in the future and achieve it in a rational and efficient manner, navigational agents are supposed to have only perceptual abilities, that is a distal sensitivity in space to avoid collision with objects in their environments. A study contrasting the ability of dogs and human infants to attribute agency to unfamiliar self-propelled object showed that dogs ‚Äì unlike human infants ‚Äì may lack the capability to recognize instrumental agents, however they can identify navigational agents.  Agency recognition in non-human animals  The ability to represent the efficiency of goal-directed actions of an instrumental agent may be a phylogenetically ancient core cognitive mechanism that can be found in non-human primates as well. Previous research provided evidence for this assumption showing that this sensitivity affects the expectations of cotton-top tamarins, rhesus macaques, and chimpanzees. Non-human apes are able to make inferences about the goal of an instrumental agent by taking the environmental constraints that can guide the agents‚Äô actions into account. Moreover, it seems that non-human species like dogs can recognize contingent reactivity as an abstract of cue of agency, and respond to contingent agent significantly different in contrast to inanimate objects.

He pioneered research in psychiatry, especially in mental disabilities. Early life Brown was born in Brooklyn on January 28, 1931. His middle initial ‚ÄúS‚Äù did not stand for a full middle name. Brown's parents were Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, and his father worked in fur processing. He initially attended The Juilliard School of Music in Manhattan, and although he continued playing the piano throughout his life, he ultimately decided on a career in medicine. Brown graduated from Brooklyn College in 1952, and Cornell University medical school in 1956. He completed a psychiatric residency at Harvard University from 1957 to 1960 and received a master‚Äôs in public health. Career In 1960, Brown became a commissioned officer in the U.S. Public Health Service, eventually attaining the rank of rear admiral and assistant surgeon general. In 1961, he was appointed by John F. Kennedy on a panel of experts to examine mental disability in criminals. He then became the Special Assistant to the President regarding intellectual disability, additionally serving as head of the Community Mental Health Facilities branch of the NIMH during the mid 1960s where he oversaw federal government support of deinstitutionalization. In that role, he led the replacement of large state-run psychiatric hospitals with locally based \\"community centers\\" and Brown continued to make that a priority when he became Director of the NIMH in 1970. Brown was also an early advocate of the decriminalization of marijuana, saying that the penalties were \\"much too severe and much out of keeping with knowledge about its harmfulness.\\" After a political reshuffle, in which HEW Secretary Joseph A. Califano Jr. stated the need for \\"fresh blood\\", he moved to become President of Hahnemann Hospital, and then Senior Psychiatrist at the RANDS CORP.

An adjustable pressure-limiting valve (commonly abbreviated to APL valve, and also referred to as an expiratory valve, relief valve or spill valve) is a type of flow control valve used in anaesthesiology as part of a breathing system. It allows excess fresh gas flow and exhaled gases to leave the system while preventing ambient air from entering. Such valves were first described by the American dentist Jay Heidbrink, who used a thin disc that was held in place by a spring. The valve is adjustable and spring-loaded, allowing the opening pressure of the valve to be controlled by screwing the valve top which modifies the pressure on the spring. A very light spring is used, so that at its minimum setting the valve can be opened by the patient's breathing alone using low pressures. In contemporary APL valves, three orifices or \\"ports\\" are present: one for intake of gas, one for return of gas to the patient, and an exhaust port for waste gas which can be connected to a scavenging system.

The two entities generally maintain good relations. Their leaders hold regular exchanges, and Singapore has an extensive network of embassies within the European Union. Singapore's relations with the European Union date back to Singapore's independence in 1965, and to date, they have signed multiple agreements. Economic relations The EU views Singapore as a crucial partner financially in a quickly developing region. Singapore remains the EU's most important economic partner in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and is one if its top partners globally. =European Union-Singapore Free Trade Agreement= The European Union-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (EUSFTA), which was first proposed in 2013, is regarded by some as \\"the cornerstone of economic ties.\\" It was signed on 19 October 2018. It aims to remove barriers to trade and investment in the EU and Singapore. The EUSFTA, which is pending ratification, would be the first bilateral pact between the EU and an ASEAN nation. The agreement was met with widespread approval with many companies welcoming the agreement. The agreement might lead the way to more similar pacts in Asia. Among other things, the agreement would reduce tariffs for the importing and exporting of goods between Singapore and the EU. Business in both areas may also bid on government projects. All ASEAN products would be considered as being from Singapore when determining tariff rates. Expatriatism There are many expatriates from Singapore living in the EU and vice versa, and there are numerous resources available to help in the process of expatriation. There are also many agencies catering to expatriates. Expatriates usually have a great relationship with their host country. Human rights and democracy The European Union and Singapore have very different policies regarding human rights, but they still maintain good relations. One example is the death penalty. The European Union is widely opposed to the death penalty, and considers that the abolition of the death penalty would lead to an increase in human dignity and the development of human rights. Singapore, on the other hand, imposes the death penalty for crimes such as drug trafficking and murder. Occasionally, this ignites a discussion of human rights and the morality of the death penalty, such as in the case of Prabu Pathmanathan. =Censorship= Censorship in Singapore primarily targets political, racial and religious issues. Singapore ranks 151st among 180 countries for censorship according to Reporters Without Borders. The EU, in turn, generally has the greatest amount of freedom of expression in the world. For a country to join the EU, it must first guarantee freedom of expression as a basic human right.

After almost 20 years of Negotiations the agreement was officially an open invitation for acceptance from the 160 members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on 27 December 2014. However the agreement will only be ratified once 2/3 of the members have informed the WTO of their agreement. For the WTO, the agreement can be viewed as a historic achievement as it is the first multilateral agreement since the WTO's inception in 1995. The Trade Facilitation Agreement of 2014 is a global multilateral initiative to rationalise the stringent procedures which govern international trade. The principal focus of the Agreement is to have numerous positive consequences on developed and Least Developed Countries. Estimates have shown that the Trade Facilitation Agreement would reduce trade costs by an average of 14.5%. In turn, this would prospectively improve trade globally by on trillion dollars. This reduction of bureaucratic 'red tape' will have favourable effects on small to medium Businesses, making it easier for them to trade and join global value chains. One of the most significant aspects of this agreement, lies in the new principle that developing and Least Developed Countries commitments to the implementation of the provisions outlined by the agreement are conditioned on their procurement of necessary technical capacity.  Historical context= 1990s = The members of the World Trade Organisation The first Trade Facilitation discussions began in the mid-1990s. In 1996, the Singaporean Ministerial Conference gave the WTO its initial directive, however under a different conceptual heading. The language used in the brief reflected a potential compromise between those wanting to renegotiate terms of a deal and those, primarily from the developing and Least Developed Countries who had their doubts about the success of new Negotiations and preferred a much more narrow/limited program. Many of the doubts surrounding a prospective new multi-lateral trade agreement were surrounding concerns about not having the capabilities to take on any additional commitments, especially for developing and Least Developed Countries. All of the developed countries supported the Trade Facilitation Agreement at this point, as well as a number of developing countries such as Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Republic of Korea, Paraguay and Singapore. However, it remained difficult to convince the affiliated nations to agree on multi-lateral negotiations. There was however no opposition to working and drafting the Trade Facilitation Act. The Act promised lower tariff barriers and non-tariff issues. However, most of the developing and least-developed countries were more in favour of an approach which encouraged these Guidelines to be followed opposed to a mandate of disciplines. Work surrounding the Trade Facilitation Agreement continued after the Singaporean summit. The main purpose of these discussions was to gain an initial understanding of the scope of the agreement. Setting a clearly defined role for the WTO became a priority. The role the WTOwould play began relatively broad. The earliest proposal indicated that the WTO would be in charge of payments, insurance and other financial requirements concerned with international trade. In the late 1990s an effort from a number of countries to make the WTO rules binding and not encouraged triggered a response to narrow the scope and focus on selected aspects of GATT. The two main areas of interest were Articles VIII and X of the GATT. In late 1999, the ‚ÄòColorado Group‚Äô, which was made up of predominantly developed countries and a few developing countries, began to promote the idea of a full negotiating mandate. However, this was met with a number of opposition. A number of members preferred to continue on the exploratory path instead of setting compulsory mandates. With numerous countries standing in opposition of each other, the ‚ÄòColorado Group‚Äô looking for certain mandates and the rest preferring to build upon three existing GATT disciplines in order to alleviate ‚Äòred tape‚Äô surrounding the trading procedures, the negotiations ended up breaking down. In the aftermath, efforts were allocated to trying to identify the positives and benefits that the Trade Facilitation Act can have on its members. = 2000s = It was not until 2001 at the Doha Ministerial that renewed efforts on the Trade Facilitation Negotiations began. The ‚ÄòColorado Group‚Äô was still attempting to increase their membership whilst their opposition were not inactive either. The DohaMinisterial was somewhat successful as it brought the two sides closer to negotiation. However, the negotiation process was yet to begin. The 2003 Canc√∫n Ministerial in September emphasised that negotiations still remained elusive. The Ministerial in Hong Kong 2005 represented the first concrete point of reference for Trade Facilitation talks. The writing had already been set in stone in Geneva and simply had to be confirmed at the Hong Kong Ministerial. There were however still concerns surrounding the Hong Kong Ministerial. Those who were in favour of a timely resolution of Negotiations were concerned that an absence of real drafting would continue to delay processes. The developing and least-developed nations were still concerned about implementation processes. There was a lack of empirical evidence pointing to technical assistance and S&D;, rather it was very general. In general, the impact of the Hong Kong Ministerial varied depending on who you asked. It was a landmark point in terms of inciting negotiation, but still little progress was made. Subsequent action from the Hong Kong Ministerial did in fact not develop at speeds anticipated. It was not until December 2009, that the \\"Draft Consolidated Negotiation Text‚Äô was circulated. This draft consisted of approximately 1700 square brackets, highlighting the main conflicting opinions. These brackets eventually expanded to approximately 2200 until it eventually started to come down. The chairman decided to appoint several organisers to try and reduce the amount of brackets. Eventually there were more than 14 facilitator groups working parallel on the issues and Negotiations. = 2010s = The Director General of the World Trade Organisation (Mr. Pascal Lamy) In March 2013, the WTO decided that it was essential for higher-level management and involvement. The NGTF Chair chose 4 Ambassadors and separated the Draft into segments for each individual to refine. Mario Matus from Chile oversaw the transparency components as well as customs operations. Switzerlands representative Remigi Winzap was put in charge of articles 6‚Äì9. Fred Agah from Nigeria had the task of refining article 10 and finally Michael Stone from Hong Kong looked after S&D; under section 2. In September2013, the WTO's Director-General also stepped in to provide council. This came in the form of numerous Negotiations and configurations, resulting in the resolve of many controversies and issues. Just prior to the Bali Ministerial Conference in December, with the direct help of the Director general, the process of drafting had resulted in almost a clean text. The previous areas of disagreement was now only limited to a few members which was able to resolved in a bilateral meeting allowing them to return as members. Previous brackets of dispute and discontent were now bracket free, such as S&D; and customs cooperation. While the Trade Facilitation Agreement was not fully completed by the Ministerial Conference it was in a good enough shape to be brought and completed there. The Ministerial Conference brought more rounds of negotiation and disagreement, however at the end the members were able to agree on a text for the Agreement. After a decade of negotiations, the WTO finally had their Trade Facilitation Agreement at the end of 2013, moving in to 2014.

This is due to a variety of factors including, redundant customs procedures, border fees and unnecessary duplications. The economic benefit of the Trade Facilitation Agreement is still yet to be completely felt and measured. However, estimates of the economic gains as a result of the agreement is widespread. Estimates range from approximately $68 billion to nearly $1 trillion per year. According to the OECD, the Trade Facilitation Agreement has the capacity to reduce trade costs by 14.1% for low income countries, 15.1% for middle-income countries and 12.9% for high-middle- income countries.That would indicate a range of gains of approximately $9 to $133 a year per person on the planet. These large ranges indicate that there are still several uncertainties surrounding the trade deal. = Impact on developing and least developed countries= It became evident to the WTO that the provisions and mandates indicated the Trade Facilitation Agreement would be more difficult to implement for developing and least-developed countries. Therefore, the Trade Facilitation Agreement Facility was developed in order to provide assistance and support to these countries. The Trade Facilitation Agreement is projected to have a significantly positive impact on these countries, with an expected 14.5% reduction in total Trade costs once the Agreement comes into force. The Agreement will also help in making critical practical hurdles which govern International trade, redundant. The wealthier countries in the Agreement have committed to help reform developing countries technical and financial processes in order to increase efficiency. This in turn is hoped to reduce corruption such as bribesin these domestic regions. New technology and more efficient procedures which reduce the ‚Äòred tape‚Äô surrounding international trade is forecasted to limit corruption by limiting its necessity.  Criticisms Since the Trade Facilitation Agreement was pushed to be a non-binding document, rather a set of encouragements for developed, developing and least-developed countries to follow, it has left many developing and least-developed countries with doubts about whether the wealthier countries will fulfil their commitment of support. Many African nations are asking questions on how this Agreement is able to benefit them for not just international trade but also inter-regional trade. Many developing countries thus are still unable to fully commit to ratifying into this agreement. Developed countries have been able to show commitment to the agreement as they have the capacity to satisfy its requirements. However many nations such as India and China have only committed to respectively 70‚Äì75% of the Trade Facilitation Agreements measures.

Parthiban Desingu in his directorial debut, while Sreekanth Vasrp and Devesh Jeyachandran have written the film's story, screenplay and dialogues. Produced by Sundar. C and Kushboo under the banner Avni Movies, the film stars Adhi, newcomer Anagha, and Karu Pazhaniappan in the lead roles alongside actors Harish Uthaman, Sha Ra, Pandiarajan, and Kausalya. It is based on the sport of Hockey. This is the second film of Adhi as a lead male actor, after Meesaya Murukku (2017). Apart from acting he also scored the music, while Aravinnd Singh and Fenny Oliver handled the cinematography and editing respectively. The film released on 4 April 2019, to mixed reviews but became a box office success.  Plot  Prabhakaran (Adhi) is a happy-go-lucky youngster in Pondicherry whose only ambition is to move to France. He goes to Karaikal for this purpose, but there, he ends up falling in love with Deepa (Anagha), a hockey player. Through her, he comes in contact with Shanmugam (Harish Uthaman), a kindhearted retired military man who is the coach of the local hockey team. A corporate is after the ground where Shanmugam's players practice, and they are aided by the local politician Harichandran (Karu Pazhaniappan). Later by filing a RTI about the company, Shanmugam comes to know about the corporate company's plan of setting up a factory in the ground which pollutes the nearby rivers and harmful for the nearby villagers living there. Now to save the ground from the corporate and Harichandran, Shanmugam's students should play with the Pondicherry hockey team and win the match. While selecting the hockey players for his team, he comes to know that Prabha was the 2012 Junior World Cup Indian hockey team captain who was banned for three years. When Shanmugam asks Prabha to join their hockey team and help them win the match, he refuses and narrates his past and his reasons for leaving hockey. Prabha and Azhar (Guhan Prakash), his childhood friend, are both hockey players. Prabha is an attacker in his team, while Azhar is defense in the same team. Prabha, after being selected by national selectors, gets into the Indian hockey team and later becomes the captain of the 2012 Junior World Cup competition's Indian hockey team, but Azhar is rejected in the Indian hockey team and asks about this to his coach (Elango Kumaravel), who mocks his desire to play hockey as well as his financial status and instead tells him to help his father in his fishing business. Because of this, Azhar commits suicide in grief, and one of Prabha's friends (RJ Vigneshkanth) loses his leg to an oncoming train when he tries to save him. When Prabha comes to know about this, he gets furious and beats up his coach, because of which he gets banned for three years. Later, Shanmugam decides to protest against the corporate company's unit being set up there with the help of his students and the local people, but Harichandran uses his dirty tricks and prevents Shanmugam from becoming successful in his protest. Harichandran later acquaints with Prabha's former coach to thwart Shanmugam's team from winning the hockey tournament. After seeing the local people suffering, Prabha decides to join the hockey team and get back the ground. Shanmugam and Prabha train the players, and later, after facing so many difficulties, they win the match and get their ground back. When they come back to the ground, they see Harichandran (who has lost his position now) giving a speech to the press as feeling happy for Shanmugam team's victory. He comes to Prabha and blames the common people for voting leaders monetary benefits and questions Prabha if the people will elect a person who is doing good for them without any money, for which Prabha is unable to find an answer.

It is the only surviving structure in Greece to feature Iznik tiles from the 1580s, the zenith of the Iznik potters' art. The mosque is located in the center of Komotini, adjacent to the Muftiate of Rhodope Prefecture. Next to the Mosque is the Clock Tower and the Ottoman Turkish baths are found in neighboring areas. Ironically, the New Mosque was built before the Old Mosque of 1608. Its founding is attributed to Ekmek√ßizade Ahmed Pasha who was the chief finance minister (defterdar) in 1606-1613 of Sultan Ahmet I and of Osman II (1618-1622). The k√ºlliye of Ekmek√ßizade Ahmed included a madrasah, a double hammam (now in ruins) and a mekteb. The current form of the mosque dates back to 1902. The mosque has a square prayer hall and has been architecturally influenced by the aesthetics of Greek neoclassicism. In the period 2007‚Äì8, the building was refurbished.

Molecular structure of Titanocene-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene Rosenthal's reagent is a metallocene bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene complex with zirconium (Cp2Zr) or titanium (Cp2Ti) used as central atom of the metallocene fragment Cp2M. Additional ligands such as pyridine or THF are commonly used as well. With zirconium as central atom and pyridine as ligand, a dark purple to black solid with a melting point of 125‚Äì126 ¬∞C is obtained. Synthesizing Rosenthal's reagent of a titanocene source yields golden-yellow crystals of the titanocene bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene complex with a melting point of 81‚Äì82 ¬∞C. This reagent enables the generation of the themselves unstable titanocene and zirconocene under mild conditions. The reagent is named after the German chemist (born 1950) and was first synthesized by him and his co-workers in 1995.  Synthesis  Rosenthal's reagent can be prepared by reduction of titanocene or zirconocene dichloride with magnesium in the presence of bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene in THF. The illustrated product for a titanocene complex can be represented by the resonance structures A and B. If zirconium is used as central atom, additional ligands (e.g. pyridine) are necessary for stabilization. 686x686px  Application and reactions  The main area of application is the synthesis of synthetically challenging organic structures such as macrocycles and heterometallacycles. Rosenthal's reagent allows the selective preparation of these compounds with high yields. Currently, Rosenthal's reagent is often used instead of Negishi's reagent (1-butene)zirconocene to generate zirconocene fragments as it offers a number of compelling advantages. Unlike Negishi's reagent, Rosenthal's reagent is stable at room temperature and can be stored indefinitely under an inert atmosphere. A much more precise control over the stoichiometry of reactions is possible, especially because the instable (1-butene)zirconocene cannot be formed quantitatively. Stoichiometric and catalytic reactions can be performed and influenced by the use of different ligands, metals and substrate substituents. While for titanium complexes, a dissociative reaction mechanism has been observed, zirconium complexes favor an associative pathway. The combination of these organometallic complexes with different suitable substrates (e.g. carbonyl compounds, acetylenes, imines, azoles, etc.) often leads to novel bond types and reactivities. A particularly interesting aspect is the novel C‚ÄìC coupling reaction of nitriles to form precursors for the realization of so far unknown heterometallacycles. As main side products of coupling reactions with Rosenthal's reagent, pyridine and bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene are obtained. These compounds are soluble and volatile, and therefore easy to remove from the product mixture.

Irukwu was the founding managing director of Nigerian Reinsurance Corporation, in 1989, he founded African Development Insurance Company which was later sold to Diamond Bank.  Life  Irukwu obtained his degree in Law and Insurance from a British university in 1962. Upon returning to Nigeria, he found employment with West African Provincial Insurance Company, a British firm operating out of Lagos. Originally, a legal adviser, he rose within the firm and joined the managerial cadre of the firm's insurance department in 1965. In 1970, he was appointed chief executive officer of Unity Life and Fire Insurance Company and it was while working at Unity that his profile began to rise. In 1972, the government appointed him head of the student loans board, a committee with the responsibility to disburse loans to thousands of students. In 1977, Irukwu became the pioneer chief executive of Nigerian Reinsurance Corporation, a government owned business established to increase the local share of reinsurance premium income. Prior to the establishment of the firm, insurance firms in Nigeria, conducted reinsurance transactions with foreign companies. To boost the local insurance market and reduce foreign exchange out-flow, the government founded Nigerian Re. The new firm was given the right of first refusal for any reinsurance transaction to be conducted in Nigeria. One of Irukwu's main challenges was to recruit and train talent in a line of business that was new to Nigeria. The firm engaged foreign institutions in the training of workers and sponsored a training school in Lagos. = Academic career = In the early 1970s, Irukwu began to conduct lectures in actuarial science at University of Lagos. In addition, he was involved in developing training programs at the West African Insurance Companies Association (WAICA) and at the West African Insurance Institute. He published his first book, Insurance Law and Practice in Nigeria in 1967 and his second book, Accident and Motor Insurance in West Africa was published in 1974.

It operated as part of the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board's 18th century museum village, San Agust√≠n Antiguo, demonstrating the colonial printmaking process.  William Wells  William Charles Wells was born in 1757 in Charleston, South Carolina, the son of a Tory printer, publisher, and bookseller. He was formally trained as a doctor, receiving a degree in medicine from the University of Edinburgh in 1780. When the British left Charleston in 1782, William and his brother John moved to St. Augustine where they established a print shop. In St. Augustine the Wells brothers are most well known for publishing the East Florida Gazette, the first newspaper in Florida. After the 1783 Treaty of Paris returned Florida to the Spanish, William Wells went to England and practiced medicine for the rest of his life. He died in London in 1817.  East Florida Gazette  The Wells brothers' publication began on February 1, 1783 and lasted a little over one year, with the last issue published on March 22, 1784. London's Public Record Office only contains three issues of the newspaper, those from March 1, May 3, and May 17, 1783. The St. Augustine Historical Society resurrected the name \\"East Florida Gazette\\" with its newsletter, which is indexed on the Historical Society Research Library's online catalog.  History  Wells Print Shop, 1971 The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board reconstructed the Wells Print Shop in 1968 on Cuna Street. The original Wells printing press owned by William and John was located on Treasury Lane. The all-wooden shop was constructed using board-and-batten building method, which the British settlers in St. Augustine preferred for its quick construction and ease of repair. The building is 220 square feet. Inside the print shop was a replica of the type of printing press used towards the end of the 18th century. The press was operated daily to demonstrate the printing process to visitors, but the Preservation Board also used it to make reproductions of historic St. Augustine maps and replicas of the East Florida Gazette, which were sold as souvenirs. Today the site once occupied by the Wells Print Shop operates as a jewelry store.

Eulalio Tordil, a Homeland Security officer, traveled across the Washington metropolitan area, where he shot and killed three people and wounded three others in the span of 24 hours between May 5 and 6, 2016. The shooting was reminiscent of the 2002 Washington D.C. sniper attacks due to both being connected to Boston Market.  Incidents  On May 5, 2016, Eulalio Tordil drove to High Point High School in Beltsville, Maryland where his estranged wife Gladys was picking up her daughters. Tordil confronted her and injured a male who tried to intervene, before shooting her in her SUV. Gladys's daughter was exiting the school and also attempted to aid her mother, who shouted at her and urged her to run away. Her daughter ran back into the school and called 911, identifying her stepfather as the shooter. Tordil then drove off, and the Prince George's County police released a photo and description of his vehicle. On May 6, Tordil drove to a Macy's store in the Westfield Montgomery Mall and opened fire, killing one man and injured two others. The three were shot while Tordil attempted to car-jack a vehicle. Tordil soon fled to a nearby Giant Supermarket in Aspen Hill, where he shot and killed a woman sitting in her car. The victim of the third attack, Claudina Molina, fought back against Tordil, knocking off his glasses. During the incidents, all Montgomery County Public Schools were ordered to shelter in place. The main campus of the National Institutes of Health was also on high alert, and the Montgomery County Community College campuses were locked down. Local recreation centers, park facilities, and library branches in Montgomery County were closed. After the third shooting, Tordil visited a nearby Dunkin' Donuts and Boston Market for coffee and lunch. It was the same Boston Market the perpetrators of the D.C. sniper attacks ate at during their spree. Tordil was arrested before 3:00 pm in Aspen Hill, and charged with the first-degree murder of Gladys Tordil, two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of attempted first-degree murder, and four counts of use of a handgun in the commission of a felony in connection with the Montgomery County shootings.  Victims  Deceased A total of three people were killed in the three attacks. Gladys Tordil was shot and killed on May 5, and Malcom Winfell was shot and killed outside the Westfield Montgomery the same day. Claudina Molina was killed on May 6. Injured Three people were injured in the attacks. Carl Unger was injured after being shot four times, John Lancaster was injured after being shot at several times, one hitting him in the shoulder after he tried to assist Gladys Tordil at High Point High School. The car-jacking victim was shot in the shoulder, in the Westfield Montgomery Mall attack.  Perpetrator  Eulalio Tordil was 62-years-old at the time of the incidents. His estranged wife Gladys Tordil had filled a protective order against him in March 2016, alleging 10 years of violence by Tordil against her and her children. Per the order, Tordil verbally, sexually, and physically abused his family and showed the two children pornographic images and subjected them to \\"intense-military- like discipline\\", and would put them in \\"detention\\" by locking them in dark closets. The order also detailed the weapons that Tordil owned, which included a .40-caliber handgun, a .45-caliber handgun, an M4, a revolver, and a \\"hunting gun.\\" After the protective order was issued, Tordil was placed on administrative duties and later placed on administrative leave from his job as a law enforcement officer with the Federal Protective Service through the Department of Homeland Security. After he was placed on administrative leave, Tordil was required to surrender his government-issued weapons, badge and credentials. = Legal = His public defender detailed to the court that Tordil was a Catholic school choir boy, a former member of the military, and still devoted to his children as he had carried a photo of them in the bag he carried while running from police. Due to the multiple locations of the shootings, Tordil was charged in different court systems. During his initial Rockville Court Appearance in April 2017, Tordil waived his right to trial by pleading guilty to two charges of first degree murder and two counts of attempted first degree murder. At the time, he faced a life sentence plus three additional life sentences. In July 2018 he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, for four consecutive life sentences in relation to the attacks. The charges relating to the murder of his estranged wife and the wounding of John Lancaster were based through the Prince George's County court system. In September 2017, he was sentenced to two life sentences for the charges that he had plead guilty to. The presiding Judge stated; \\"You should not see or breathe a free bit of air for the rest of your life. It's overwhelming the reasons to show no mercy.\\" Tordil is currently incarcerated in the North Branch Correctional Institution.http://www.dpscs.state.md.us/inmate/search.do?searchType=detail&id;=273218005  Aftermath  A memorial service was held for Gladys Tordil at Parkdale High School in Riverdale, Maryland, where she was an AP Chemistry teacher on May 16. A local prosecutor pledged to help the daughters of Gladys Tordil, who were 16 and 17, and their closest relative was in the Philippines at the time of the murder, causing them to be placed in foster care; the prosecutor is also working to bring an aunt from the Philippines to the United States.

She also serves as a director for the American Society of Human Genetics and is an associate editor at PLOS Genetics, G3 (Genes, Genomes, and Genetics), and Genome Research. She is also a member of the scientific advisory board at the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. Tishkoff has been a leading figure in using genetics to advance understanding of modern human diversity. In particular she has made significant contributions to research on human genetic variation in African populations. In 1996, she and colleagues published the first paper to support the Out-of- Africa hypothesis using the nuclear genome, illustrating the extent of diversity among African populations. In 2001, Tishkoff and colleagues were some of the first to show the genomic signature of natural selection in human populations. Some of her most cited research is a study on genomic variation around the lactase gene, the first to show coevolution of a cultural and genetic trait. Tishkoff was able to link evolution of cattle domestication to lactase persistence. Her more recent work includes the largest genomic study across ethnically diverse Africans, and the identification of novel genetic variants associated with skin color. Tishkoff is a recipient of a National Institutes of Health Director's Pioneer Award, a David and Lucile Packard Career Award, a Burroughs/Wellcome Fund Career Award, and a Penn Integrates Knowledge (PIK) endowed chair. She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2017.  Early life  Sarah Tishkoff was born on December 26, 1965 in Los Angeles, California. She moved from Los Angeles to East Lansing, Michigan when she was five, and from East Lansing to Klamath Falls, Oregon in her early teens.Tishkoff, S. A. (2018, November 2). Sarah Tishkoff - Early and Personal Life [Telephone interview]. Her parents were both involved in academia. Her father was a professor of hematology and oncology at the University of California, Los Angeles and later the Director of the Red Cross for the Midwest of the United States. Her mother was a professor of history at the Oregon Institute of Technology. Tishkoff attended the University of California, Berkeley for her undergraduate degree. While in high school, she read Coming of Age in Samoa by Margaret Mead, sparking her initial interest in cultural anthropology. Tishkoff‚Äôs career was significantly influenced by several mentors throughout her education. While at UC Berkeley, she took courses in linguistics, cultural anthropology, physical anthropology, and archaeology, among other subjects. While at UC Berkeley, she was particularly inspired by Allan Wilson‚Äôs research using molecular approaches to understand evolutionary change. She was further inspired by many of Wilson‚Äôs graduate students, including Vincent Sarich, Mary Claire-King, and George Sensabaugh. In particular, while at UC Berkeley she took a course taught by Vincent Sarich, who was interested in genetics, human development, and evolution, and worked on comparing proteins in humans with those in chimpanzees. His unique teaching style and controversial comments piqued Tishkoff‚Äôs interest in the field, and encouraged her to question human origins and the genetic basis of human traits more deeply. After realizing its importance in conducting her work on human evolutionary history, she added genetics as an additional major at UC Berkeley. Tishkoff cites her experience meeting the Khoisan people at a meeting on Khoisan origins in Cape Town, during her time in Johannesburg, as a transformative event, as the Khoisan people have one of the oldest genetic lineages in the world. During this visit she met with cultural anthropologists, geneticists, and representatives of Khoisan groups. Tishkoff became a professor at the University of Maryland in 2000, and went to the field for the first time a year later. This initial four-month-long trip, funded by the David and Lucile Packard Career Award, allowed her to pursue fieldwork that led to research in African population history and the genetics of variable traits and disease. Tishkoff‚Äôs lab continues to conduct field work in Africa, taking care to do the research ethically. Her lab works to have their African collaborators treated as equal partners in the research, and ensures research results are sent back to participants. Tishkoff is married to Evan Leach, whom she met on her first day at Yale graduate school. She currently resides in Pennsylvania.  Education  Tishkoff graduated with a Bachelor of Science in genetics and a Bachelor of Arts in anthropology from the University of California, Berkeley in 1989. She went on to receive her Master of Philosophy in human genetics from the Yale School of Medicine in 1992. Tishkoff completed her formal education upon acquiring her PhD in genetics from Yale University in 1996, under the continued advisement of Kenneth Kidd. While working in the Kidd Lab, Tishkoff developed an interest in African genomics and evolution, leading her to write her thesis on the ‚ÄúPatterns of nuclear haplotype frequency variation and linkage disequilibrium in a global sample of human populations‚Äù. Shortly after completing her PhD, Tishkoff continued the research started in her thesis, and consequently published a paper titled ‚ÄúGlobal patterns of linkage disequilibrium at the CD4 locus and modern human origins‚Äù in the journal Science.  Career  From 1997 to 2000, Tishkoff was a postdoctoral fellow at The Pennsylvania State University. During this period, Tishkoff was researching links between stable polymorphisms and microsatellites in human populations with Dr. Andrew G. Clark. She was also a visiting research fellow in 1997 at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. In 2000, Tishkoff became an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology at the University of Maryland, College Park. In 2005, Tishkoff was promoted to Associate Professor and she held that position until she left the university in 2007. In 2008, Tishkoff became the David and Lyn Silfen University Associate Professor at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2012, Tishkoff became a Full Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, where she is currently the David and Lyn Silfen University Professor. Tishkoff also currently holds appointments in the Department of Biology, which is within the University‚Äôs School of Arts and Sciences, and in the Department of Genetics, which is within the University‚Äôs School of Medicine. Tishkoff and her lab members study evolutionary genomics, African phenotypic diversity, the genetic basis of resistance to infectious diseases, and the genetic basis of human adaptations. Their work combines field work, laboratory research, and computational approaches to examine the effect of genetic variation in living and past African populations. In 2017, Tishkoff was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, which is considered a high honor that recognizes distinguished scientists in their respective fields. Throughout her career, Tishkoff has also been a part of numerous professional associations and scientific societies. She currently serves on the board of director for the American Society of Human Genetics, and she is a member of the scientific advisory board at the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. She is an associate editor at PLOS Genetics, G3 (Genes, Genomes, and Genetics), and Genome Research.  Research  The primary focus of Tishkoff‚Äôs research career has been on human genetic variation in African populations. The central aims of her research are to better understand the origins of modern humans and the histories of African populations, and the genetic underpinnings of disease susceptibility. Advances in these areas of research may aid drug development for diseases with known genetic bases, and the development of more effective medical treatments for living African populations. = African genomics = Integrative genomics  Tishkoff's research methodology applies an integrative genomics approach that combines data from the genome, epigenome, proteome, transcriptome, metabolome, and microbiome of various African ethnic groups to identify genetic and environmental factors that affect traits related to human measurements, metabolism and immune system.  Evolutionary genomics  Tishkoff's work also addresses questions about the evolutionary history of Homo sapiens. One of the key findings in this area of research includes the discovery of genetic signatures of interbreeding between anatomically modern humans and extinct hominins. Tishkoff was also involved in a study that rejected the hypothesis that ancestors of anatomically modern humans were genetically isolated in Africa. This study was based on whole- genome simulations from two Western African Pygmy populations, Biaka and Baka, and suggested the existence of introgression from an unknown archaic population.  Phenotypic diversity  Sarah Tishkoff and colleagues also focus their research on acquiring genomic and phenotypic data from geographically and culturally distinct African populations, which are underrepresented in genetic studies and whose analysis may uncover new aspects of human evolutionary history, including susceptibility to diseases and migration patterns. By genotyping approximately 2400 individuals from 121 geographically diverse African populations, Tishkoff and colleagues found evidence for 14 genetically divergent ancestral populations in Africa, and by comparing the genetic information with archaeological and self-described phenotypic data they showed high cultural and linguistic similarity within each cluster. Using their novel set of acquired genetic markers they were also able to trace back the shared ancestry of African Americans with African populations, finding a dominant shared ancestry from Niger-Kordofanian populations in Western Africa. Additionally, based on this research they have claimed that migrations from non-African populations into northern Africa resulted in increased genetic diversity in that region. Their work has demonstrated the need for further genomic analyses of African populations as a means of identifying correlations between allele frequencies and risk of certain diseases, and potentially designing therapeutic drugs for treating diseases in populations with similar genetic backgrounds. = Genotypic and phenotypic adaptation in humans = Another focus of Tishkoff‚Äôs research group is understanding how different geographical and environmental influences correlate with genotypic and phenotypic changes in African populations.  Resistance to infectious disease  Tishkoff has focused on the influence of malaria on human populations to study the genetic basis of resistance to infectious diseases. Tishkoff and colleagues found that the presence of malaria was correlated with the allele frequencies of the G6PD that are believed to provide resistance to malaria but also to increase the risk of blood-related diseases. Haplotype analysis of Med and A- allele mutations at the G6PD locus revealed that their increased frequency occurred after the agricultural practices began. Tishkoff and colleagues suggested that agriculture led to greater exposure to malaria, which created a selective pressure for alleles that confer resistance. Tishkoff and colleagues examined the diversity of the malarial-susceptible locus, ICAM-1, and found greater variation within African populations compared to variation in other global populations. They also found several alleles at the locus that were found ubiquitously in malarial regions, and one of them, ‚ÄúICAM-1Kilifi,‚Äù was present in high frequencies in Asian and African populations. This research suggested that there is a strong association between these allele frequencies and the presence of malaria, and that its analysis would help to find factors that affect malarial susceptibility and resistance. In the same year, Tishkoff proposed that an adaptation to one infectious disease can make humans more susceptible to other diseases. Two coding variants, G1 and G2, for the APOL1 protein are associated with resistance to African trypanosomiasis, or African sleeping sickness, but they also increase the risk of chronic kidney diseases.  Lactase persistence  In a 2007 study published in Nature Genetics, Tishkoff and colleagues documented three new single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with lactase persistence (G/C-14010, T/G-13915 and C/G-13907) among ethnic groups in East Africa that differ from the allele associated with lactose tolerance that is common in Europe (C/T-13910). The most widespread mutation was found among Nilo-Saharan speaking groups in Tanzania and Kenya, while two independent mutations were found among the Beja people in Sudan and Afroasiatic speaking people in Kenya. The SNPs significantly increase the in-vitro activation of the lactase gene, which is known as LCT. These mutations are an example of convergent evolution due to the shared cultural selective pressures of animal domestication and milk consumption, and they are a clear case of gene-culture coevolution. A 2014 study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics documented two more SNPs that have significant associations with the lactase persistence trait. The study also found the European variant C/T-13910 among some pastoralist groups in Northern and Central Africa.  High altitude adaptations in Ethiopians  In 2012, Tishkoff participated in a study published in Genome Biology that compared the hemoglobin levels between populations living at high and low altitudes in Ethiopia. The study found that there are statistically significant differences in the hemoglobin levels between the high altitude population, the Amhara people, and the low altitude population, the Aari and Hamar people. The genomic analysis recovered different gene candidates underlying adaptation to high altitude (CBARA1, VAV3, ARNT2, and THRB). This study demonstrates another example of convergent evolution, since the mutations found in the Ethiopian high altitude population are different than the ones found in Tibetan and Andean populations.  PTC taste perception  Sarah Tishkoff participated in the first study on variability in PTC taste perception. PTC is the bitter antithyroid compound phenylthiocarbamide, and the ability to perceive this compound is attributed to the gene TAS2R38. TAS2R38 is hypothesized to underlie a dietary adaptation that allows for avoidance of bitter-tasting poisonous foods. Tishkoff and colleagues hypothesized that African populations with different diets would have differences in their receptor genes due to selection associated with their diets. The study was based on a sample of 57 African populations consisting of 611 individuals and a comparative set of 132 non-Africans from the Middle East, Asia, and the Americas. Researchers measured participants' PTC bitter taste sensitivity using a modified version of the Harris - Kalmus threshold method, sequenced genomes, and completed haplotype and genotype-phenotype association analyses. Results failed to support the original hypothesis. African populations with divergent diets showed similar haplotype frequencies and there was little genetic differentiation between Africans and non- Africans. This stability suggests that variation of TAS2R38 is functionally important and does more than just steer us away from bitter tasting potential toxins.  Short stature in western African pygmies  Tishkoff also participated in a study on the adaptive evolution of Western African Pygmies and three neighboring Bantu-speaking agricultural populations with whom they admixed. This study aimed to gain a broadened understanding of the genetic basis of phenotypic diversity in Africa. The sample included 132 individuals from six populations, including three from pygmy populations, and methods included genotyping and ancestry estimation. Results suggested that the short stature in Western African Pygmies may have resulted from selection for early reproduction, and metabolic and immune functions and that there may have been several selective events at different times in pygmy evolution.  Science education  Tishkoff has numerous open-access online videos of topics relevant to her work, released in conjunction with a variety of research organizations, academic conferences, and educational foundations. She participated in the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Biointeractive Lecture Series on Bones, Stones, and Genes: The Origin of Modern Humans. These themed events provided free scientific educational content online to \\"help bridge the gap between the textbook and the latest scientific findings\\". Similarly, Tishkoff has released a short series of research talks on African Genomics with the organization iBiology, whose mission is to \\"convey, in the form of open-access free videos, the excitement of modern biology and the process by which scientific discoveries are made\\". Other notable examples are her videos on The Evolution of Human Biodiversity: Local Adaptation, Adaptation to Taste and Lactose Intolerance in Africa, and Evolution and Adaptation in Africa: Implications for Health and Disease.  Awards, honors, and memberships  As an undergraduate at University of California, Berkeley, Tishkoff received the UC Berkeley President‚Äôs Undergraduate Fellowship in 1987 and graduated with University high honors and honors in anthropology. She later received the Fulbright/DAAD Predoctoral Fellowship for her research work in Germany from 1991-1992. After she received her PhD, she received a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship for her research in molecular evolution from 1996-1998. As a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland, Tishkoff received a grant from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund to fund her research on human resistance to malaria in Africa from 1998 to 2003. Her work would go on to be acknowledged by the David and Lucile Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering in 2001. While serving on the faculty at University of Maryland‚Äôs College of Life Sciences, Tishkoff received the Junior Faculty Excellence Award in 2003. At her time at University of Pennsylvania, Tishkoff became an Integrates Knowledge Professor in 2008 for her work in African ancestry, lactase persistence, and taste sensitivity. In 2009, Tishkoff was awarded the National Institutes of Health Director‚Äôs Pioneer Award to fund her research in Africa detailing genetic and environmental factors that influence human physiological traits. She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2017, and is also on the board of directors for the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG). In 2019, she received the Curt Stern Award from AHSG in recognition of her work on African human genetics.

She was a militant of the Communist Party and the Party for Democracy, and a member of the Chamber of Deputies from 1965 to 1969 and 1990 to 1994. She was an active defender of human rights during the Chilean military dictatorship, especially after the death of her son, the sociologist in the Caso Degollados (Degollados Case). Biography The daughter of Juan Agust√≠n Maluenda Vidaurre and Mar√≠a Campos Guti√©rrez, Mar√≠a Maluenda completed her primary and secondary studies at Liceo No. 4 in Recoleta. She attended the University of Chile, where she studied law for one year and pedagogy in Spanish for another. Later she dedicated herself to acting, in which she was self-taught. In 1941, Maluenda was part of the group that founded the University of Chile's . Its first production was La guardia cuidadosa, starring Maluenda. Three years later, she was the protagonist of the film ', directed by Jorge D√©lano, one of the first Chilean talkies. She also performed in radio dramas and worked for the BBC. In 1946, she married actor Roberto Parada, with whom she had two children, and Mar√≠a Soledad. Maluenda joined the Communist Party in 1958. She was a member of the Chamber of Deputies for that party for the term 1965‚Äì1969, elected by the 7th Departmental Grouping \\"Santiago\\", 1st District. During the government of Salvador Allende, she was the ambassador of Chile to Vietnam from 1972 to 1973. On 29 March 1985, her son Jos√© Manuel, who worked at the Vicariate of Solidarity, was kidnapped and murdered. His body appeared the next day along with those of two other professionals. The event was known as the Caso Degollados (Degollados Case), and, after investigations, it was learned that the crimes had been perpetrated by agents of the Carabineros (DICOMCAR). During the second half of the 1980s, Maluenda participated in the Movement for Free Elections, which sought to end the military regime through enrollment in the electoral registers and the plebiscite. The actress criticized the role of extremist groups, such as the Manuel Rodr√≠guez Patriotic Front, and she left the Communist Party because of fundamental differences. In 1987, Maluenda participated in the founding of the Party for Democracy. In the , she stood for deputy representing that party in the 17th District, being elected for the legislative term 1990‚Äì1994. She was Provisional President of the Chamber on 11 March 1990 and chaired the installation session under the provisions of Article 1 ‚Äì Transitory, paragraph 2 of Constitutional Law No. 18,918 of the National Congress. She was a member of the Permanent Commission on Foreign Relations, Interparliamentary Affairs, and Latin American Integration, and on Human Rights, Nationality, and Citizenship. She did not stand for reelection for the next term. Mar√≠a Maluenda died in Santiago on 29 August 2011. There was a viewing of her remains in the hall of honor of the Santiago seat of the Chamber of Deputies, and her funeral was held on 30 August in the Parque del Recuerdo cemetery.

Life Hermann Glaser was born in Nuremberg, and though he became a national figure, his Middle Franconian provenance was always an important part of his public personality. His father was a secondary school teacher. He studied History, Philosophy, Germanistics and Anglistics at Erlangen and, for two terms, Bristol. It was from Erlangen that he received his doctorate in 1952. His dissertation concerned the place of Hamlet in German Literature. His university studies concluded, in 1953 he embarked on ten years as an enthusiastic and creative secondary school teacher, first for one year in Coburg and then, as the economic and political divisions between East and West Germany increasingly came to be matched by physical divisions, back in his birth-city of Nuremberg. During that decade he also achieved literary success as the author of a number of school text books with a focus on German and world literature. By 2012 his \\"Kleine Geschichte der modernen Weltliteratur in Problemkreisen\\" (loosely, \\"Little history of modern world literature in difficulties\\") had reached a remarkable nine editions. In 1964 Glaser switched his teaching job for a political position in Nuremberg as schools and culture consultant. He arrived in post with his ideas well developed. Shortly before his appointment, encouraged by Waldemar von Knoeringen, he became a member of the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD), and during the 26 years that he remained in post he applied his considerable energies to promoting a \\"Culture of civil rights\\" (\\"B√ºrgerrecht Kultur\\") in democratic society. In order to give the Nuremberg adolescents under his supervision more autonomy, in 1973 he co-founded a self-administering \\"Youth Centre\\", the so-called Kommunikationszentrum (\\"KOMM\\"), which inspired numerous other similar projects in other West German cities. The initiative was not without its own risks, however. After the infamous 1981 Mass arrest of Nuremberg Glaser stood by the 140 young people who had been besieged in the \\"KOMM\\" centreby the police and then, when they emerged, taken away and locked up, including 21 minors. Minister-President Franz Josef Strauss was personally involved in what turned out to have been a pre-planned power demonstration on behalf of the police and the Bavarian state government. The incident became highly politicised: although 78 of the 141 who had been locked up faced charges, in the end all charges were dropped. Subsequently, those who had been arrested were awarded damages. Glaser became chairman of the Deutscher Werkbund (loosely, \\"German Association of Craftsmen\\") and became a lecturer and honorary professor in communication sciences at the prestigious (and slightly misleading named) Technical University of Berlin. He also taught on the specialist \\"Culture and Management\\" (\\"Kultur und Management\\") at Dresden International University. After 1990 there were also guest professorships both in Germany and abroad.

During the late Mamluk era in the 15th century, Samad was the home of the Samadiyya branch of the Qadiriyya Sufi order founded by a certain Shaykh Salim, a student of Abd al-Qadir al-Gilani (died 1166).Nahrawali 2005, p. 65.Bakhit 1982, p. 183. Leadership of the Samadiyya order was hereditary and led by Shaykh Salim's descendants from their zawiya (Sufi lodge) in Samad. In 1520 the Samadiyya order's sheikh (religious leader) Muhammad ibn Khalil ibn Ali ibn Isa ibn Ahmad al-Samadi (1505‚Äì1541) gained an audience with the Ottoman sultan Selim I and secured imperial support for his order. He also relocated its principal zawiya to the as-Salihiyya suburb of Damascus in 1520 and then erected a new principal zawiya in the Shaghur neighborhood in 1525. The order was named after Samad and maintained its name after the move of its main headquarters to Damascus during the early Ottoman era. Samad is possibly the place named Garita al-Janahiyya in the 1596 tax registers, being part of the nahiya (subdistrict) of Bani Malik as-Sadir in the Qada Hauran. It had an entirely Muslim population consisting of 32 households and 13 bachelors.

Microneedles are constructed through various methods usually involving photolithographic processes or micromolding. These methods involve etching microscopic structure into resin or silicon in order to cast microneedles. Microneedles are made from a variety of material ranging from silicon, titanium, stainless steel, and polymers. Some microneedles are made of a drug to be delivered to the body but are shaped into a needle so they will penetrate the skin. The microneedles range in size, shape, and function but are all used as an alternative to other delivery methods like the conventional hypodermic needle or other injection apparatus. Microneedles are usually applied through small arrays. The arrays used are a collection of microneedles, ranging from only a few microneedles to several hundred, applied to an applicator sometimes a patch or other solid stamping device. The arrays are applied to the skin of patients and are given time to allow for the effective administration of drugs. Microneedles are an easier method for physicians as they require less training to apply and because they are not as hazardous as other needles, making the administration of drugs to patients safer and less painful while also avoiding some of the drawbacks of using other forms of drug delivery, such as risk of infection, production of hazardous waste, or cost.  Background  Microneedles were first mentioned in a 1998 paper on transdermal drug delivery demonstrating that microneedles could penetrate human skin. Subsequent research into microneedle drug delivery has explored the medical and cosmetic applications of this technology through its design. This early paper sought to explore the possibility of using microneedles in the future for vaccination. Since then researchers have studied microneedle delivery of insulin, vaccines, anti-inflammatories, and other pharmaceuticals. In dermatology, microneedles are used for scarring treatment with skin rollers. The major goal of any microneedle design is to penetrate the outmost layer of the skin the stratum corneum (10-15Œºm). Research has shown that there is a limit on the type of drugs that can be delivered through intact skin. Only compounds with a relatively low molecular weight, like the common allergen nickel (130 Da), can penetrate the skin. Compounds that weigh more than 500 Da cannot penetrate the skin.  Types of microneedles = Solid = This type of array is designed as a two part system; the microneedle array is first applied to the skin to create microscopic wells just deep enough to penetrate the outermost layer of skin, and then the drug is applied via transdermal patch. Solid microneedles are already used by dermatologists in collagen induction therapy, a method which uses repeated puncturing of the skin with microneedles. = Hollow = Hollow microneedles are similar to solid microneedles in material. They contain reservoirs that deliver the drug directly into the site. Since the delivery of the drug is dependent on the flow rate of the microneedle, there is a possibility that this type of array could become clogged by excessive swelling or flawed design. This design also increases the likelihood of buckling under the pressure of , and therefore failing to deliver any drugs. = Coated = Just like solid microneedles, coated microneedles are usually designed from polymers or metals. In this method the drug is applied directly to the microneedle array instead of being applied through other patches or applicators. Coated microneedles are often covered in other surfactants or thickening agents to assure that the drug is delivered properly. Some of the chemicals used on coated microneedles are known irritants. While there is risk of local inflammation to the area where the array was, the array can be removed immediately with no harm to the patient. = Dissolvable = In a more recent adaptation of the microneedle design, dissolvable microneedles encapsulate the drug in a nontoxic polymer which dissolves once inside the skin. This polymer would allow the drug to be delivered into the skin and could be broken down once inside the body. Pharmaceutical companies and researchers have begun to study and implement polymers such as Fibroin, a silk-based protein that can be molded into structures like microneedles and dissolved once in the body.  Advantages  There are many advantages to the use of microneedles, the most prominent being the improved comfort of patients. Needle phobia can affect both adults and children, and sometimes can lead to fainting. The benefit of microneedle arrays is that they reduce anxiety that patients have when confronted with a hypodermic needle. In addition to improving psychological and emotional comfort, microneedles have been shown to be substantially less painful than conventional injections. Some studies recorded children's views on blood sampling with microneedle and found patients were more willing when prompted with a less painful procedure than traditional sampling with needles. Microneedles are beneficial to physicians as well since they produce less hazardous waste than needles and are generally easier to use. Microneedles are also less expensive than needles as they require less material and the material used is cheaper than the materials in hypodermic needles. Microneedles present a new opportunity for home and community based healthcare. One of the biggest drawbacks of traditional needles is the hazardous waste that they produce, making disposal a serious concern for doctors and hospitals. For patients who require regular administration of medication at home, disposal can become an environmental concern is needles are placed in the trash. Microneedles would provide those who are limited in their ability to seek hospital care with the ability to safely administer drugs in the comfort of their homes. One of the benefits of microneedles are their lower rates of microbial invasion into delivery sites. Traditional injection methods can leave puncture wounds for up to 48 hours post-treatment. This leaves a large window of opportunity for harmful bacteria to enter into the skin. Microneedles only damage the skin to a depth of 10-15Œºm making it difficult for bacteria to enter the bloodstream, and giving the body a smaller wound to repair. Further research is required to determine the types of bacteria able to breach the shallow puncture site of microneedles.  Disadvantages  There are some concerns about how physicians can be sure that all of the drug or vaccine has entered the skin when microneedles are applied. Hollow and coated microneedles both possess the risk that the drug will not properly enter the skin and will not be effective. Both of these types of microneedles can leak onto a person's skin either by damage of the microneedle or incorrect application by the physician. This is why it is essential that physicians are trained how to properly apply the arrays. Another concern is that incorrectly applied arrays could leave foreign material in the body. Although there is a lower risk of infection associated with microneedles, the arrays are more fragile than a typical hypodermic needle due to their small size and thus have a chance of breaking off and remaining in the skin. Some of the material used to construct the microneedles, such as titanium, cannot be absorbed by the body and any fragments of the needles would cause irritation. There is a limited amount of literature available on the subject of microneedle drug delivery as current research is still exploring how to make effective needles. Research and Applications Researchers at MIT, lead by Anna Jaklenec, are developing technology for both administering vaccines and also leaving an invisible \\"on- patient\\" vaccination record. This research has funding from many entities including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Koch Institutehttp://news.mit.edu/2019/storing-vaccine-history-skin-1218 The new technology is even being considered for use in monitoring vaccination records of travelers as a means to prevent infections diseases from spreading. The invisible mark would be scanned at ports of entry to allow for movement of people, while controlling for the spread of viruses. http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200621-will-travel-be-safer-by-2022  References  Medical equipment ","title":"Microneedle drug delivery"},{"id":"58971839","text":"The Old Miller Hospital was constructed as a single-family home located at 121 Michigan Avenue in Owosso, Michigan; it was later converted to a private hospital. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History This small clapboard house was likely constructed in 1895 (although it may have been converted from a barn constructed previous to that date). In 1908, Mary Miller purchased the house and converted it into Owosso's first hospital. At first, the Miller Hospital contained a single operating room (the original living room) and two patient beds. The hospital was staffed by Miller and one additional nurse, and was utilized by doctors who had patients requiring more extensive care. The hospital ran on a tight budget fir a few years, but by 1910, the utility of having a local hospital was being recognized. Other organizations and medical professionals began providing support, and soon an additional operating room was constructed, and the hospital grew to a ten bed facility. In 1916, Miller sold the hospital to Bertha Bowman. Not long after, a new private hospital, the Swayze Hospital on Pine Street, and in 1921 a public hospital was constructed in Owosso. By this time, Bowman had closed the Miller Hospital. Description The Old Miller Hospital is a two-story wood-framed structure covered with clapboard. It is two bays wide and has an irregular floorplan, symmetrically placed windows, and a broad porch running the full width of the front of the house. It is topped by a gable roof, with the corniceline facing the street. The house has an interesting two story side bay and several additions in the rear.

It is currently not under the jurisdiction of any ministries, although it works closely with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Ministry of Justice to safeguard the country. The abbreviation GSIN, which is derived from its Russian name, is also used in conjunction, and is not to be confused with Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN). History The State Penitentiary Service of the Kyrgyz Republic has its beginnings in 1918, when the People's Commissariat for Justice of the Turkestan Republic approved a provision to establish three prisons and two workhouses in the region. In 1920, the first Soviet concentration camp in Kirghiz SSR was established and several more were later opened during Stalin's rule of the Soviet Union. Execution sites like those in Chong-Tash also appeared during that time to suppress dissidents. During the Great Patriotic War, convicts and prisoners-of-war were transferred to these concentration camps. After the war from 1954 to 1969, the system was brought under the charge of the General Directorate of the Places of Detention under the Ministry of Public Order and Protection. Towards the end of the Soviet Union in 1989 to 1990, major protests broke out across prisons nationwide and in the Kirghiz SSR changes were demanded to improve the welfare of prisoners. Violence, hunger strikes and suicide broke out when such demands were not met. In one major incident on the 14 and 15 of September 1989, prison colony No.19 near the village of Zhany-Zher, Sokuluk District, broke out into a violent prison uprising that led to a major state of emergency. The incident eventually ended with three dead and infrastructure damages amounting to at least one million Soviet Rubles. Upon the republic's independence in 1991, the department was brought under the command of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In 2002, the Ministry of Justice took over the command of the department as well as large amounts of personnel from the former. This was done to provide and ensure a more humane environment within prisons in line with international practice. On 22 October 2009, by Presidential Decree, the State Penitentiary Service was established as an independent department under the Krygyz Government to oversee the penitentiary institutions and personnel. This was later approved by a Government Decree on the 18 December the same year. The future construction of prison complexes in Batken and Talas Oblast, as well as upgrades to existing infrastructure are currently being planned to accommodate to the prison numbers. Responsibilities The responsibilities of the penitentiary service are to: # Ensure the execution and serving of sentences and other measures of criminal law in accordance with the legislation # Ensure the proper detention of persons detained on suspicion, charged with committing crimes, and prisoners # Ensure the protection of the rights, freedoms and legitimate interests of convicts and prisoners # Ensure the rule of law and legality in the institutions executing punishment in the form of imprisonment and pre-trial penitentiaries, the safety of convicted prisoners and prisoners, as well as employees, military personnel, officials and citizens located in the territories of these institutions # Ensure the protection of penitentiary institutions, as well as other units and institutions of the GSIN # Ensure the protection and escorting of convicts and prisoners along established escort routes, escorting citizens of the Kyrgyz Republic and stateless persons to the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic, as well as foreign citizens and stateless persons in the event of their extradition # Assist law enforcement and other security agencies of the Kyrgyz Republic to ensure public safety and the legal regime during a state of emergency # Provide legal and social protection for employees, military and retired GSIN personnel # Organize training and retraining of the staff of the GSIN in cooperation with educational institutions of the Kyrgyz Republic and foreign countries Structure The penitentiary service is divided into several divisions, that include: * Main Headquarters * Department for the Protection of Correctional Institutions & the escort of convicts and persons in custody * Department of Penitentiary Inspections * Social Support Bureau * Medical Service * Atlantis Rehabilitation Center * Center for Rehabilitation and Social Adaptation of convicts * Pension Department * Sports Society \\"Semetey, –°–µ–º–µ—Ç–µ–π\\" * Educational Center * Newspaper Department \\"Umut, –£–º—É—Ç\\" The penitentiary service is further sub-divided into several units, that include: {  * Central Base * Department for Criminal Executive Inspections * Department for Enforcement of Sentences and Special Accounting * Department of Capital Construction and Renovation * Department of Educational Work * Department of Logistics * Dog Center * Financial and Economic Department * General Department * Internal Audit Sector * Internal Security Service * International Cooperation Department  * Investigation Department * Legal Department * Main Operational Directorate * Medical Department * Militarized Fire Protection Sector * Operational Response Division * Personnel Management Unit * Sector for Mobilization Work and Civil Protection * Security Regime Sector * Special Unit \\"Omega\\" * State Enterprise \\"Kelechek, –ö–µ–ª–µ—á–µ–∫\\" * State-owned Enterprise \\"PMK, –ü–ú–ö\\" } Outreach=Local= Local community outreach has been initiated by the penitentiary service in the form of selling produce that has been made within the penitentiary institutions as part of job training efforts. Several of these products include bowls, clothes, construction materials, soy milk, and even wheat products like bread and pasta. Local religious organisations from the Islamic and Russian Orthodox Church branches have also been approached to bring religious teachings into these institutes. Furthermore local third party watchdog group, the Ombudsman (–û–º–±—É–¥—Å–º–µ–Ω–∏), have been invited to review and recommend actions to be taken in light of reforms happening in the service. =International= The penitentiary service has reached out to several international organisations to seek assistance in improving the conditions of its institutions as well as its staff. These include the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) as well as several non- governmental organisations like Doctors Without Borders, International Committee of the Red Cross, and Soros Foundation. These organisations have assisted the penitentiary service in numerous ways including providing funds for the upgrading of aging infrastructure, training of its staff, or monitoring as a third party watchdog of the conditions of prisoners held within the institutions. The Kyrgyz Republic is also a member of the Istanbul Protocol and have abolished the death penalty under the guidance of the international community, although there have been calls from within the republic for the return of capital punishment. State Penitentiary Service Day The Day of the Employee of the Penitentiary System of the Kyrgyz Republic also known as the State Penitentiary Service Day, is a professional holiday for employees of the penitentiary service in the Kyrgyz Republic that is celebrated annually on the 12 of August. It was established in 2003 by a governmental decree to acknowledge the efforts of penitentiary service personnel in safeguarding the nation. Traditionally, concerts and meetings are held to thank the staff, while state and departmental awards are also given out. Incidents * On 20 October 2005, during a period of prison unrest, convicts killed four prison officials which included the head of the Main Department for the Execution of Punishments during a visit. This incident came during a time when prison conditions were deteriorating due to acute shortages in the funding of prisons as well as alleged torture of prisoners. * On 22 October 2015, Kyrgyz police killed a suspected Islamist militant that had escaped from prison during a shootout, which saw the death of one policeman and two civilians too. The militant had escaped from prison together with eight other detainees and convicts after killing three prison guards. This mirrored increasing calls for concern that more militants might have entered the country at the wake of the United States invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 as well as the collapse of the Islamic State around 2015, that eventually led to sweeping arrests and convictions of suspected terrorists which have alarmed human rights group.

Early life Brudenell was the second son of Francis Brudenell, Lord Brudenell and his wife Lady Frances Savile, daughter of Thomas Savile, 1st Earl of Sussex. Like all his family, Brudenell had been brought up a Roman Catholic. He and his brother George went to Italy in 1703. They enjoyed an unruly time there and while they were still in Rome, the Duke of Shrewsbury was asked to castigate Brudenall for neglecting his studies, and he may have been instrumental in converting the brothers to Anglicanism. Their guardian, Robert Constable, 3rd Earl of Dunbar, ordered them back to England in the autumn of 1704 but instead, they went on to Venice where Brudenell developed smallpox. The brothers finally returned to England at the end of April 1706. Career Brudenell was elected as Whig Member of Parliament for Chichester at the 1713 general election on the interest of his brother-in-law, the Duke of Richmond. He voted against the expulsion of Richard Steele on 18 March 1714. He was defeated at Chichester at the 1715 general election, but was brought in by his friend, Lord Lymington, as MP for Andover at a by-election on 1 April 1715. He was appointed Master of the Jewel Office in 1716 at ¬£450 per annum, and voted regularly with the Government. He was returned unopposed for Andover at the 1722 general election. The only surviving record of his thirty-three years in Parliament occurred on 14 November 1722 when for lack of a seat during a very large committee, he got into the Speaker's chair, and confidently stayed there for the whole committee which was something no one had done before. Brudenell married in March 1725, Susan Burton, daughter of Bartholomew Burton of a wealthy merchant of Ashwell, Rutland and a sister of William and Bartholomew Burton. She was a Woman of the Bedchamber to the Queen. He was returned again for Andover at the 1727 general election, and in 1730 was promoted to the Board of Trade at ¬£1,000 per annum, although he did not often attend. In 1731, he became Groom of the Bedchamber at ¬£500 per annum. At the 1734 general election he stood again at Chichester as the nominee of his nephew, the 2nd Duke of Richmond and headed the poll. He was master of the horse under his nephew and he became a Gentleman of the Horse at ¬£250 per annum, bringing his own and his wife's income from official posts to over ¬£2,000 per annum. He was returned again for Chichester at the 1741 general election. He voted consistently with the government. Death and legacy Brudenell died from apoplexy on 9 August 1746. He and his wife had two sons and two daughters.

On November 1, 2018, more than 20,000 Google employees engaged in a worldwide walkout to protest the way in which the company handled cases of sexual harassment, and other grievances. The protest came one week after a New York Times report that named Andy Rubin and other executives who had been accused of sexual misconduct, and was paid a $90 million severance package. The core organizers were Claire Stapleton, Tanuja Gupta, Meredith Whittaker, Celie O'Neil-Hart, Stephanie Parker, Erica Anderson, and Amr Gaber. The walkout was organized in less than three days and lasted for a half hour. Striking workers used a flyer that read: > Hi. I‚Äôm not at my desk because I‚Äôm walking out in solidarity with other > Googlers and contractors to protest sexual harassment, misconduct, lack of > transparency, and a workplace culture that‚Äôs not working for everyone. I‚Äôll > be back at my desk later. I walked out for real change. The main demand was the act of transparency from a company, the presence of an employee representative, and the public fillings of each sexual assault case. here were many signs that were held up during the course of the protest. One said \\"What do I do at Google? I work hard every day so the company can afford $90,000,000 payouts to execs who sexually harass my co-workers\\", another said \\"Don't be evil\\". Ongoing activism at Google In December 2018, contract workers for Google wrote an open letter with demands addressing disparities between employees and contractors. Retaliation and union busting The Tech Workers Coalition provided a retaliation hotline during the Google Walkouts for employees who faced retribution for their participation. Two of the Google Walkouts organizers, Claire Stapleton and Meredith Whittaker, claimed that Google retaliated against them following the Google Walkouts by attempting to force them out or demote them. They organized a sit-in on May 1, 2019, International Worker's Day. By July 2019, four of the seven organizers, including Stapleton and Whittaker, had left the company. In late 2019, the National Labor Relations Board opened an investigation in to the firing of four Google employees over their efforts to unionize. In late 2019, the New York Times reported that Google had hired IRI Consulting, a company that provides anti-unionization services. Impact and outcome Some of the demands made were met or partly met. Many of Google's responses included the reiteration of commitment to past diversity objectives and the improvement of the process to report harassment. The two resolutions that came closest to the employees' demands were the publishing of sexual assault cases, although the company opted for a private, internal report rather than a public one, and increased transparency of sexual assault. In February of 2019 Google announced the end of forced arbitration for employees for all claims.

The hashtag was launched by a video that went viral on Twitter on October 11, 2018. According to the New York Times, the video \\"alternated between footage of angry protesters and clips of cable news anchors discouraging the use of the word ‚Äúmobs‚Äù to describe those activists.\\" The anonymous creator of the meme was described by the New York Times as working under the pen name ‚ÄúBryan Machiavelli,‚Äù and as describing himself as ‚Äúmemetic warfare\\" consultant who charges $200 per hour. . Newsweek quoted him as saying, \\"I‚Äôm someone that works in Hollywood. I am a notable person but because of the state of the climate, I chose to make this video anonymously.\\" \\"Mobs\\" draws on the idea, popular on the right-wing internet, that Republicans represent a rational alternative to the mob violence represented by Antifa and other left wing protesters. While \\"Jobs\\" references the high levels of job creation during the first year and a half of the Trump administration, which many left-wing and liberal voters and commentators attribute less to the policies of the Trump Administration and more to a lingering effect of Obama administration policies. According to Politico, \\"the seeds of the new slogan\\" can be traced to early October 2018, a moment when activists flooded into downtown Washington during the confirmation fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. President Trump and other Republicans began calling Democrats the party of ‚Äúmob rule,‚Äù and Trump spoke of a ‚Äúradical Democrat mob, saying, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt hand matches to an arsonist, and you don‚Äôt give power to an angry left-wing mob.‚Äù On October 12, Republican political consultant and activist Ali Alexander tweeted that \\"‚ÄòMob‚Äô probably won‚Äôt play as well as some proponents think.‚Äù Cartoonist and pro-Trump activist Scott Adams responded \\"‚ÄòMobs‚Äô by itself doesn‚Äôt work. But ‚ÄòJobs Not Mobs‚Äô is brain glue plus framing and contrast. Science says the brain interprets rhymes as persuasive.\\" In an email interview with Politico, Adams disclaimed coining the phrase, stating that had seen in a comment on Twitter, though he couldn‚Äôt remember where. ‚ÄúThis is the sort of meme that likely popped up in multiple places and travelled multiple paths. Expect more than one claim of original authorship. That would be normal and probably true.‚Äù According to Politico reporter Ben Schreckinger who tracked the slogan down using a third-party tool, The First Tweet, the first person to use it was probable Danny East, a Twitter user in Georgia who had about 500 followers and who used the phrase on October 11 in response to video of Trump speaking. Adams popularized the slogan by endorsing it on October 12th.. The phrase was retweeted by activist Turning Point USA and actor James Woods before being publicized on Fox & Friends on October 15. It was being widely retweeted by 18 October, when President Trump first retweeted it. It continued to grow in popularity in late October, becoming a Republican campaign slogan in the days just before the midterm United States elections, 2018, which resulted in sweeping gains for the Democratic Party.

Marasmius setosus or Marasmius recubans) is a tiny whitish mushroom having a distinctive hairy stem. It has been given the vernacular name \\"Beechleaf Parachute\\". Description The species can be described as follows: *The white cap is initially hemispherical and later flat. It grows to about 0.5 cm in diameter. *The gills are white and distant, and either adnate or somewhat decurrent. The spore powder is white. *The stem can grow to 4 cm long but is very long and thin, being only about 0.5 mm in diameter. It is white at the top and red brown lower down, with long white hairs (up to 1 mm), at least near the base when young. *The smell and taste are not distinctive. *The spores are usually spindle-shaped, but can be ellipsoid, or almond-shaped and measure roughly 10-14.5 Œºm x 4-6 Œºm. Naming and related species Sowerby's original illustration of A. setosus The species epithet comes from the Latin adjective \\"saetosus\\" or \\"setosus\\", meaning \\"coarsely hairy\\". That word in turn derives from \\"saeta\\" (or \\"seta\\"), a bristle. This species was originally described in 1801 as Agaricus setosus by James Sowerby in his historic work \\"Coloured Figures of English Fungi or Mushrooms\\". The French mycologist Lucien Qu√©let independently described the species under the name Marasmius recubans in 1873, but much later in 1987 Machiel Noordeloos determined that Sowerby's name takes precedence and defined the combination Marasmius setosus for it. Then in 2015 Vladim√≠r Anton√≠n and Alexander Urban transferred it to the new genus Rhizomarasmius. Marasmius saccharinus is a similar fungus which has been confused with R. setosus by some authors, but which, however, lacks the hairs on the stipe. There are other tiny Marasmius species such as M. epiphyllus which are comparable but which again have a bald stipe. Ecology and distribution This mushroom grows on dead beech leaves, or occasionally on other deciduous leaves such as willow or birch. It is widely distributed in central and western Europe.

He was born in Dundee, Scotland. He settled in Humber Bay in 1873 and remained there for the rest of his life. He is best known as a builder of boats and bridges. His contracting business constructed bridges, and foundations. He was also an inventor, hotel owner, and brickmaker. His best known patent was a sliding seat for racing sculls. He also patented a boat rudder which could be easily shipped or unshipped. 'The Flotilla' carousel formed from a ring of miniature boats was installed at High Park in 1894. In 1899, it was moved to Munro Park in eastern Toronto. His boathouse was on the Humber River, south of Lakeshore Road. Boats were built and rented at this location. Hicks saved several people from drowning. He once rented boats to the party of Governor General Lansdowne. In 1918, his boat livery became involved in legal dispute with the Toronto Board of Harbor Commissioners. The Board claimed jurisdiction over the Humber River, but Hicks disputed this. He managed to obtain the support of the York County Commissioners. Hicks took the matter to court but lost quickly because \\"the limits were set by the Department of Marine and Fisheries at Ottawa, and were not merely plan of the commissioners.\\" In 1873, he built a boathouse on the Humber River between Lakeshore Road and the G.T.R. tracks. The Royal Oak Hotel was located a little west. He purchased it from the widow of the hotel's builder in 1880. As a hotelier, he sometimes joined with owners of nearby hotels to jointly promote their businesses. Most ambitious was when he joined with John Duck (Wimbledon House), Charles Nurse (Nurse's Hotel) and the brewer Eugene O'Keefe to form the Humber Steam Ferry Co. For several years, this company operated two ships to carry excursionists from Toronto to the owners' hotels at the Humber River. To attract winter business Hicks and Duck constructed a racetrack on the river in winter 1888. Relations with Charles Nurse were sometimes strained. In 1887, Hicks brought a civil action for trespass against Nurse. He claimed that Nurse had improperly fenced in part of public right of way south of the Lakeshore Road. Hicks' complaint was upheld on appeal. The hotel apparently suspended operation around 1889 before reopening several years later under a new owner. As a boatbuilder, he is best known for canoes with a torpedo stem. He also built sailing canoes, skiffs and power boats. The boat factory was located on the north side of Lakeshore Road to the west of the Humber Beach Hotel. In 1907, the boat livery was moved to the east side of the river between the G.T.R. and the Lakeshore Road. The boathouse moved back to the west bank south of Lakeshore Road in 1913. This final boathouse was demolished in 1930 to accommodate a widening of Lakeshore Road. The Middle Road Bridge was the first concrete truss bridge built in Canada. In spring 1885, he constructed a 400 ft iron pier for the Ferry Company at High Park. The construction was unusual in that it was supported by 53 screw piles. Storm-driven ice destroyed the pier in March 1887. His contracting business built bridges and abutments. The firm also did more mundane work such as building a cinder path for bicyclists, earth moving, pile driving, and sand blasting. In 1904, his first commission was Musson‚Äôs Bridge which carried the old Albion Road (now Flindon Road) over the Humber River. It was the first all-riveted steel bridge with a permanent floor. The eastern abutment of this bridge survives today. A bridge at Unionville was built in 1907 for Markham Township Council . Frank Barber claimed this was the first concrete beam bridge in York County. In 1909, he built the first concrete truss bridge in Canada. The exact type was a \\"parabolic bowstring truss\\". Two innovative techniques were used in construction of the bridge: \\"the rods were given considerable tension before the concrete was poured by an ingenious device of the contractor\\"; ice bags were left overnight on the fresh concrete so that courses poured on successive days would bond properly. In 1909, he received a contract from Vaughan Municipal Council to build a reinforced concrete bridge over the Humber River between Purpleville and Kleinburg. This bridge was located near the intersection of Teston Rd and Kipling Avenue. The arch bridge over the Holland River at Newmarket was built by Hicks and designed by Frank Barber. This 1909 railway bridge has been stripped of its approach embankments and preserved as a historic structure. He was also a pioneer in foundation work. The engineer who designed the streetcar bridge over Mimico Creek considered the problem which beset the nearby Grand Trunk Railway bridge. The pilings of the abutment sank into the sand on the river bottom. Therefore, concrete abutments sitting on rock were specified. Hick's solution was to sink square concrete shells through twenty feet of sand. The shells sank as the inside sand was scooped out. The shells were then filled with concrete to yield bridge abutments. In 1906, he did the concrete work for the Toronto and York Radial Railway bridge over Etobicoke Creek. Hicks built the substructure of the Scarlett Road Bridge which was completed in November 1909. > Some contractors considered him to be a bold and luck speculator (for > instance, in his contract on the Mimico abutments mentioned above.)

It took place on September 21, 2018. \\"De-FAANGing\\" of the Technology Sector After the close of the market on Friday, September 21, 2018, the technology sectors of the S&P; 500 Index and the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) underwent a huge change, that reshuffled the sector in which certain telecommunication and information technology companies would be placed. \\"FAANG\\" is an acronym representing the tech giants Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Therefore \\"de-FAANGing\\" is a unique reshuffling of these companies to properly fit them into new sectors, because they have been the companies that have helped the U.S. Stock Market considerably in these past five years. The overlap of these companies caused certain sectors to gain too much weight in the S&P; 500 and this reshuffling promised a boost in trading volume for all companies involved and affected by the new sector change. This new sector, known as Communication Services, includes some major information technology companies such as Facebook and Google's parent company, Alphabet, as well as large Consumer Discretionary companies, such as Netflix and Comcast. As well as these two shifts, a complete move for the Telecommunication Services sector into the new Communication Services sector also occurred. This new sector is important because it recognizes how media, telecommunications and different Internet companies assimilate regardless of their overall differences in the services they provided. The MSCI plans to follow a similar reshuffling throughout October and into November to match this reshuffling of the S&P; 500 and GICS. This Communication Services sector is a revamping of a smaller sector, Telecommunications Services, that included Verizon and AT&T.; However, it will now include at least eighteen companies from the Information Technology and Consumer Discretionary sectors, along with a slight name change. Lastly, this reshuffling is so important because it is the second time since 1999 a sector has been added to stock indices. =The Reason Behind the \\"De-FAANGing\\"= When the S&P; 500 and GICS announced this major tech reshuffling last year, it was met with much controversy and questioning from those concerned about dividend yields and protection of their investments. They responded by saying: \\"(Reclassification) is a step towards acknowledging the convergence of telecommunications, media, and select internet companies and the overlapping services rendered by these companies, within the Global Industry Classification Standard Structure.\\" Essentially, they believed that these IT companies, as well as different telecommunication, media and Internet companies, had all grown so large that they deserved a unique sector. This new sector enabled them to keep the weight of the tech sector from expanding too much, as well as to recognize the similarities in services among one another. The information technology sector is one of the biggest sectors on the S&P; Dow Jones Indices. Seven of the larger information technology companies make up about a fifth of the information technology sector of the S&P; 500 Index. These were moved to the Communication Services sector because of the large growth of the Information Technology sector, taking up nearly a quarter of the total weight of the [S&P; 500 Index. As well as this sector being reshuffled, sixteen companies taking up nearly twenty-two percent of the Consumer Discretionary sector were moved to the Communication Services sector. This was in order to increase the companies involved in each sector as all of the IT and consumer discretionary companies gained significance on the U.S. Stock Market. Also, the tech sector had its first fall in over a month from February to March 2018. Overall, this new sector takes up about ten percent of the S&P; 500, including twenty-three major companies and having a market capital of about $2.8 Trillion. Results=Effects per Sector= This sector reclassification was created to boost the trading volume of the S&P; 500 by twenty billion dollars in shares. Each sector was affected in different ways due to certain powerhouse companies leaving the sector, causing the significance of other companies in that sector to rise. Overall, more than 26 companies in three different sectors were affected by this reshuffling into the new Communication Services sector. First, the Telecommunications Services sector, which only takes up two percent of the S&P; 500 Indices, basically dissipated and the companies in this sector, such as Verizon, AT&T; and CenturyLink moved into the larger Communications Services sector. Next, thirteen companies from the Consumer Discretionary Sector such as CBS, Disney, Netflix, Comcast and 21st Century Fox moved into the Communications Services sector. The weight of this sector on the S&P; 500 decreased from about thirteen percent to nearly ten percent. On top of these changes, the Information Technology sector suffered the biggest decrease in weight on the S&P; 500 due to the shift of powerhouse companies into this new Communications Services sector. With the departure of the giant tech companies Facebook and Alphabet, the Information Technology sector lost about five percent of its weight on the S&P; 500, decreasing from over twenty-six percent to about twenty-one percent. =Effects per Company= With so many enormous, influential companies involved in this reshuffling, many other companies were affected that were not even involved in it. Most companies that were not involved however impacted by this reshuffle, increased in significance in their own business due to higher weighted companies shifting out of that sector. For example, in the Information Technology sector, with the move out by Facebook as well as Alphabet and Twitter, Microsoft was able to increase its weight in the sector by three percent moving from thirteen to nearly sixteen, benefiting those Investors with shares in Microsoft. Microsoft also increased their weight from this reshuffle due to the move of eBay from the Information Technology sector into the Consumer Discretionary sector. Another example is the increase in Amazon's weight in the Consumer Discretionary sector from twenty-six percent to nearly a third after the move of major companies such as Netflix, Disney and CBS into the new sector. As to the effects of companies in the Telecommunications Services sector, many stockholders were not very pleased with this shift. What made this sector so appealing is that they had a high w:dividend yield, and more defensive qualities to protect investors from suffering higher losses from drops in the stock market. The shift from telecommunications services to communications services caused a decrease in dividend yield for companies from about five and a half percent to barely more than a percent.  US Equity Volume Soars =Effect on U.S. Stock Market= Due to the strength and weight of the companies involved in the reshuffling, the US Stock market trading volume skyrocketed on Friday, September 21, 2018. On that day about eleven billion shares were in movement between all the companies involved with and affected by the reshuffling, the largest trading day since February 2018. Both companies involved in and affected by the reshuffling saw increases in trading volume, especially the bigger companies involved. For example, Facebook, Alphabet, and Netflix all saw increases in trading volume due to increased pressure to sell, which was most likely the cause of the larger sector funds moving towards smaller ones. Although the S&P; 500 ended relatively flat on Friday, Facebook and Alphabet fell nearly two per cent. The week end for the S&P; 500 showed a month's high of positive 0.8 per cent, led by none other than the technology stocks, which have continuously brought the S&P; 500 out of a recession. These numbers are fairly good considering over a month earlier Facebook had the biggest single-day fall of any company in U.S. history, on top of an increase in the fear of an international w:Trade war in the United States with China and an increase in U.S. w:Interest rates. Taking all of this into account, the fact that trade volume was positive with a fear of an international trade war signifies just how strong investors felt about this reshuffling because people usually fear buying and selling stocks even in the tech industry when an international trade war is imminent. Lastly, this S&P; 500 sector reshuffling is the largest of its kind in the GICS since its institution in 1999. =Other Impacts - Exchange-traded funds= The effects of the reshuffling of these tech giants into the new Communication Services sector do not stop at direct companies and sectors. They have a larger impact on the overall market because so many of these companies being relocated have a steep potential for growth in Exchange-traded funds (ETF) while increasing exchange traded products. An ETF is a marketable security that tracks a stock market index, a commodity, a bond, or a basket of assets. A large portion of these ETFs are created to track specific stock indices and their sectors‚Äô activity but do not actually follow stock of a certain company. Because the Global Industry Classification Standard decided to commit to this reshuffling, they forced many large investment management firms and others providing ETFs to sell huge amounts of their investors shares in the information technology and consumer discretionary sectors as well as telecommunications sector due to the move of large companies out of these sectors. An example of this occurred with the State Street Global Advisors, a strong investment management firm with ETFs representing the communications services, consumer discretion and information technology sectors of the S&P; 500. They created an ETF for the new communication services sector June 19, 2018. It already has $252 million in assets. They also plan to rebalance their consumer discretionary and information tech ETFs by selling assets of their already profitable communications services ETF and allocate them to the info tech and consumer discretionary ETFs. This occurred due to the sale of millions of shares of Alphabet and Facebook because of their move out of the Information Technology sector. On the other hand, the SSGA did not have to sell its shares in the telecommunications sector because although it did not have specific ETFs tracking this sector, management still chose to, because certain companies in this sector could be affected in their various tech sector ETFs. On top of SSGA, other investment companies such as Vanguard followed by putting limits on their involvement in ETFs that track the MSCI. They did this over fears of the increased strength and mostly overlapping in this new sector between telecommunications, media, and Internet companies, while the telecommunications sector diminished from a mere three companies. These concerns come about because they leave the telecommunications vulnerable for huge changes in its constituents as well as this new sector having too many companies providing similar services, thus possibly lowering trading volume. The results have not yet shown this lowering of trade volume. Overall trade volume is supposed to increase even larger than the already 10.9 billion shares traded the Friday before this policy was enacted.

While stationed in British India, he commanded a motor ambulance convoy in North-West Frontier Province, assisted in dealing with a cholera epidemic in Waziristan, and was on the staff of the Director of Medical Services in India. With the Irish Free State having been formed in 1922, Shaw's continuing service in the British Army saw him return to the United Kingdom. He played three first-class matches for the British Army cricket team, one against the Royal Navy at Lord's in 1923, and two in 1925 against Oxford University and Cambridge University. Playing a total of seven first-class matches, Shaw scored 193 runs at an average of 17.54, with a highest score of 65. As a fast-medium bowler, Shaw took 21 wickets a bowling average of 13.80.

The students were participating in an adventure program required by the school for sophomores. The disaster is the second deadliest alpine accident in North American history, behind an avalanche in 1981 on Mount Rainier which claimed eleven lives. Expedition The students were participating in Basecamp, a program run by their Portland school following the principles of Outward Bound, and required for all tenth graders. Led by Tom Goman, a teacher from the school, the team set off from Timberline Lodge on Monday May 12, 1986, at 3 a.m. The forecast predicted an afternoon storm. The party consisted of 20 people: 15 students, one parent, Goman, the dean of students, and two technical consultants. Seven members of the party turned back over the course of the morning. Bad weather suddenly arrived around 2pm and conditions deteriorated rapidly. After difficulties, the team eventually descended off course. With evening approaching, the technical consultant constructed a snow cave. The cave was not large enough to hold everyone, and the accumulating snowfall built up over the entrance, obstructing the air flow and restricting access. The group stayed the night at the snow cave. The consultant and a student set off for help after first light on Tuesday morning. The rest of the group waited at the snow cave. Portland Mountain Rescue had arrived at Wy'East Day Lodge shortly after 5am on Tuesday, May 13th, in response to an overdue climbing party consisting primarily of high school students. The volunteer searchers faced blizzard conditions with winds exceeding 60 mph. The consultant and a student, from the missing climbing party, emerged from the storm by mid morning. The two informed deputies and PMR chiefs that the rest of the team was holed up in a snow cave. Neither was able to pinpoint the cave's location. Searchers continued to arrive on the mountain and were deployed strategically all day and night. Wednesday morning, the weather cleared. A team of searchers found three students exposed to the brutal elements. Teams probed nearby for survivors. The search took three full days. More than 150 searchers put themselves in harm's way to find the hidden snow cave. The blizzard presented unbelievable obstacles including: whiteout conditions, an emergency helicopter landing (resulting in grounding of Air Force helicopters), communication device failures, fractured eye protection, tools and protective outerwear stripped by gusts, and snowcat battery failure as well as a windshield blowout. Also, searchers were experiencing falls and uncontrolled slides over cornices and into crevasses, requiring their own rescues. Portland Mountain Rescue, The 304th Aerospace Rescue & Recovery Squadron, Alpinees, Corvallis Mountain Rescue Unit, Hood River Crag Rats, Mt. Hood Nordic Ski Patrol, Mt. Hood Ski Patrol, Columbus Search Dogs, German Shepherd Search Dogs, Hillsboro Helicopters and Seattle Mountain Rescue all volunteered their time and expertise in an unprecedented, multi-day search and rescue operation. Miraculously, the cave was located. Helicopters rushed the victims to 5 Portland hospitals where doctors and medical staff attempted to save lives. The entire story is covered in detail in \\"Code 1244: The 1986 Mount Hood Tragedy\\" (Released in 2019) The author interviewed 37 people involved in this tragedy including the co-chiefs, rescue workers, school staff, and members of the climbing party as well as their families.  Aftermath  The school commissioned an official inquest, which assigned blame primarily to Goman for failing to turn back in the face of bad weather. Settlements were offered to the families of seven students who died, and one family filed a wrongful-death lawsuit in September 1986. The school commemorates the event annually in May of each year.

By November 2018 it had grown to nearly 40,000 volunteers from every state in the U.S., including Alaska and Hawaii. By March 2020, according to the founder, it had grown to more than 70,000 volunteers and had sent almost 7 million postcards.

McMullin uses technology to keep the organization running smoothly. He has an interactive texting system, called Abby, that was created and donated by a volunteer. Additionally, address lists are \\"seeded\\" with addresses belonging to members of the group to verify that the postcards are being written as prescribed. Operational costs for Postcards To Voters are funded through the sale of postcards and monetary donations. There are more than a dozen postcard designs available for sale on Amazon, Etsy, and on the Postcards To Voters website; however, volunteers are free to buy postcards from other vendors. Free downloadable templates are also available. Further funding is provided by MyPostcard and the Out Loud Shop, where a portion of their merchandise sales benefit the organization. Campaigns pay nothing for the service, but if a candidate is happy with the service they are asked to be a reference for future campaigns. Additionally, in an effort to help candidates, Postcards To Voters teamed up with Ragtag, an organization that can assist candidates build an online presence.

The island of South Georgia is unusual among oceanic islands for having pre-Cretaceous sedimentary rocks underlying much of the island and a significant portion of felsic igneous rocks. Two-thirds of the island consists of intensely folded flysch, capped with Aptian age fossils, tuff and greywacke in the Cumberland Bay Series. The series includes slate, phyllite, conglomerate, siltstone and sandstone. In the west are basalt flows, pillowed spilite, prehnite and trachyandesite, as well as shale with radiolarite fossils. Uranium-lead dating of zircon and muscovite grains from the southern Andes and South Georgia (gathered from the peraluminous Darwin granite suite and undersea Tobifera Formation rhyolite) indicates that the rocks formed during the middle Jurassic.

Hicks Nursery in Westbury, New York is still in business to this day, and its site is landmarked.  Early life  Isaac Hicks was born in 1767, into the Quaker farming community of Westbury, Long Island. He was the son of Samuel and Phebe (n√©e Seamen).RG 5/197, Isaac Hicks Family Papers, Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College While in Westbury, Hicks worked both as a tailor and as a teacher. In 1789, disillusioned with teaching, Hicks moved to New York City: he opened a mercantile shop under the title of ‚Äúgrocer‚Äù. = Family = In 1789 he met Sara Doughty. They married in 1790 and had six children: John, Robert, Benjamin, Isaac, Elizabeth, and Mary. Hicks had a prominent extended family within the Quaker community which included Quaker minister Elias Hicks and artist Edward Hicks. He is also related to Nat Hicks, the catcher who revolutions the game of baseball by positing himself immediately behind the batter, instead of 25 feet back, which allowed the pitcher to throw curveballs, necessitating the invention of the baseball glove and catchers gear, and making baseball a much faster-paced game.  Business enterprises = Grocer and dry-goods specialist = In 1789, Hicks moved from Westbury to New York City. He had saved money from working as a tailor and teacher, and opened a store under the title 'grocer'. While starting out as a grocer, Hicks also took in additional tailoring on the side. In 1790 began a series of partnerships; first with Richard Loines; then with Richard Loines, his father William Loines, and William Loines‚Äô brother- in-law, John Alsop, Jr. Loines, Alsop, & Company specialized in importing British made dry goods, and it is within these partnerships that Hicks transitioned from the title ‚Äògrocer‚Äô to ‚Äòdry-goods specialist‚Äô. It is also with Loines, Alsop & Co. that Hicks learned how to supplement his income, as the partnership owned a wharf, rented business properties, and were co-owners of a mill, all to bring in additional income during the slow seasons of their business. In 1791, Loines, Alsop & Company dissolved. William Loines retired, Richard Loines joined with his brother John to create their own mercantile business,New York Directory, 1792 and Hicks and John Alsop, Jr. continued their partnership under the new name of Alsop & Hicks. It was at this point that the pair began being seen in directories under the listing of ‚Äòmerchant‚Äô. For three years, Alsop & Hicks continued acting as an international importer of dry goods. = Shipping and commission agent = In 1794, after not making the money they expected and having trouble collecting on debts owed to them, the company Alsop & Hicks changed direction from ‚Äòdry-goods specialists‚Äô to ‚Äòshipping and commission agents‚Äô. This change allowed Alsop & Hicks to act as trusted agents for other merchants, selling goods that were sent to them rather than buying and selling on their own. The firm also helped merchants and captains outfit ships, purchase insurance, and obtain cargo. It was in this venture that Hicks‚Äô relationships within the Quaker community were beneficial: Quaker merchants were more likely to trust other Quakers and their families with their goods than they would an outsider. Hicks used his position in the Quaker Meeting to more than double his contacts. In May 1794, John Alsop, Jr. left New York City for a quieter life in Hudson, New York, though he did continue to maintain part interest in the firm and bring in customers from the Hudson area, including: Thomas Jenkins & Sons, Seth Jenkins, and the Paddock family, among others. Accounts Current; Isaac Hicks papers, MS 297, The New-York Historical Society It is these connections that also allowed Alsop & Hicks to gain commissions in Nantucket and New Bedford, Massachusetts, as well as continuing earlier commissions of cotton, tobacco, and rice, out of Savannah, Georgia. After continuing business in this manner for a number of years, Hicks dissolved his partnership with John Alsop, Jr. and formed a partnership with Benjamin D. Doughty-longtime clerk of Alsop & Hicks. However, a yellow fever outbreak led to the death of Benjamin Doughty shortly after this partnership began,Isaac Hicks papers, MS 297, The New-York Historical Society and Hicks refrained from creating new partnerships through his retirement. Now that Hicks was on his own, while continuing to do business in the same manner as he did while part of Alsop & Hicks, Isaac Hicks began focusing more of his efforts towards increasing his sale of whale products- especially oil and spermaceti candles. These commissions made up the majority of his revenue until 1800. Hicks was able to increase and keep his trade contacts in the whaling market by being fastidious in attempting to regulate the fluctuating prices of whale oil, even when it was at the loss of a commission. He also attempted to restore some of the former marketing practices of spermaceti candle maker's in order to increase the candle maker's profits. By 1800, Hicks commissions from whale merchants began a steady decline-mostly because of the changing circumstances within the whaling industry, as well as some decisions made by Hicks. Insurance rates were rising, the number of whales was dwindling in the Atlantic, and Hicks allowed his brother, Samuel, to take over many of his commissions when Samuel began his own business. Also, with the falling prices, captains and owners were becoming unhappy with their lack of income, and blamed the problems on Hicks. Because of the dwindling income from whale products, Hicks returned his focus to other forms of shipping and commission. By 1802, Hicks began considering at least partial retirement from business, as he was beginning to get notices of declining health. It was because of this, that in December 1802, Hicks, along with others in a syndicate, purchased the ship Thames in order to capitalize on trade to St. Petersburg, Russia and quickly increase their earnings. When all was said and done, Hicks made a handsome profit-grossing nearly $14,000 ($292,611.21 in 2018). After a time, Hicks and his syndicate sold the Thames, andk while Hicks continued to put on excursions to the Black Sea, none were as profitable. Regardless, by 1805, Hicks left New York City to return to Westbury and by 1807 had officially retired from business at the age of 38. His business passed on to his brother, Samuel Hicks. = Business records = Throughout his multiple partnerships, Hicks kept detailed business records, including but not limited to accounts current, invoices, insurance policies, bank notes, canceled checks, bonds, and correspondence. His correspondence primarily detailed business matters, and include records of which goods were sent on which ships, the destination of said goods, and sometimes notes on the voyages or the lives of the correspondents. This includes weather patterns, European politics, the Napoleonic wars and other military conflicts, piracy, disease (primarily yellow fever and smallpox), and more. Throughout his career, Hicks associated with businesses and companies such as the Merchants' Bank of New York, the Bank of New York, United States Bank, United Insurance Company, New-York Insurance Company, and The Marine Insurance Company of New York, among others.  Personal life  Throughout Hicks‚Äô career, he was a staunch abolitionist and active in the Quaker Meeting. He was a member of an anti-slavery organization that mixed both Friends and prominent non-Quakers, as well as a member of the New York Manumission Society. Hicks did trade in slave goods such as cotton, tobacco, indigo, and rice. As part of the New York Manumission Society, he was a fund-raiser for the African Free School. Hicks occasionally put spiritual endeavors ahead of his business endeavors, taking time out of his work to attend yearly meetings, and doing work with his local Meeting. While these religious endeavors might have been a distraction during his career, it became all-consuming after Hicks entered retirement. Hicks was also extremely active in the Quaker Meeting, acting on multiple committees. In 1816, he was nominated for Clerk of the Westbury Meeting. He was also well known in many other Quaker circles outside of the Meeting, mostly thanks to his cousin, Elias Hicks, who Isaac traveled extensively with in his retirement. Hicks also worked closely with his cousin, Edward Hicks, in an attempt to bring him back to preaching and away from painting by paying off his debts. After an active and varied retirement, Hicks fell ill on January 10, 1820, and died shortly thereafter at 52 years old.

Via and ViaVan also licenses their technology to cities, transit agencies and private organizations to help build their own on-demand shared transit networks. Daimler, Mercedes-Benz' parent company, becomes a strategic investor in Via. ViaVan lets independent drivers carry passengers and retains 15% of the fare. For comparison, Uber keeps 25%. At the same time, it operates with its own vans. ViaVan operates in partnership with transport operators in a majority of its deployments throughout Europe. Arriva uses ViaVan's technology to operate its on-demand transportation services in Leicester, Liverpool and Sittingbourne, as does the Oxford Bus Company in Oxford.  History  In September 2017, Via formed a joint venture with Mercedes-Benz Vans to establish ViaVan, designed to spread on-demand shuttle services in Europe. ViaVan launched its first operations in March 2018 in Amsterdam. Arriva UK Bus launched ArrivaClick, an on-demand app developed through a partnership with Via, in Kent in March 2017. Via launched Savy, an app using Via's on-demand ride-sharing technology and a fleet of vehicles owned by the company, in Queenstown, New Zealand in November 2017. In December 2017, ViaVan announced a new partnership with the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) and Mercedes-Benz Vans to establish the largest public sector on-demand transit deployment in the world. Named BerlK√∂nig, the Berlin fleet would contain 300 vehicles and would be launched in spring 2018. In June 2019, the service won the award for best Public and Urban Transport Strategy from the International Association of Public Transport, as well as the prestigious German Federal Inclusion Award in November 2019. BerlK√∂nig has been deemed a success, delivering more than 750,000 rides in its first 10 months, with more than 80 percent of BerlK√∂nig rides carrying two or more passengers in the vehicle at the same time, reaching up to 97% at peak times. In April 2018, ViaVan launched in London and operated initially in central London Zones 1 and 2. In August 2018, Arriva and ViaVan launched ArrivaClick in Liverpool, England. ViaVan launched in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire in October 2018, making it the company's fourth deployment in Europe. In February 2019, ViaVan announced a new partnership with Transport for London (TfL) for a 1-year demand responsive bus pilot in the borough of Sutton. The service operates in collaboration with Go-Ahead London and uses dynamically routed, on-demand buses. In April 2019, ViaVan and Arriva launched the third deployment of ArrivaClick in the Drummond Estate development in Leicester, England, one of the largest new housing developments in the East Midlands. The partnership also represents the first time in the UK that a Section 106 agreement has been used to fund a digitised Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) service. In May 2019, ViaVan partnered with Transport for London (TfL) to launch an on-demand public transportation pilot in Sutton. The demand- responsive bus service operated by Go-Ahead aims to link more people to existing TfL transit and reduce the need for private car ownership. ViaVan reported it had successfully completed the pilot phase of an on-demand, dynamic corporate shuttle at the Mercedes-Benz Bremen plant in Bremen, Germany on June 28, 2019. Due to the success of the pilot program, ViaVan and Mercedes-Benz announced they would be launching additional corporate campus solutions at other Mercedes-Benz plants. In July, 2019, ViaVan launched Cool, a service in Malta. The service covered 28 Maltese neighborhoods at launch, with plans to expand to the entire Island country. ViaVan also received a three-year license renewal from Transport for London in July, 2019. The company announced it provided more than 7 million rides in London since launching, saving 3 million vehicle kilometers by pooling multiple passengers into shared vehicles, resulting in more than 600,000 kilograms of CO2 saved. ViaVan announced a new public transportation deployment on behalf of Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) in August 2019 called ‚ÄúBerlK√∂nig BC‚Äù serving as first- and-last-mile connection to U-Bahn railway stations traditionally underserved by fixed route services. BerlK√∂nig BC is the second service ViaVan and BVG have worked on together, following on the heels of their first BerlK√∂nig service, which launched in central Berlin in September 2018. In September 2019, ViaVan announced its first dynamically routed transit solution in Finland in partnership with the Helsinki Regional Transport Authority (HSL). The service operates in Espoo, allowing riders to book an on-demand trip and connect to Metro and train stations in the operating zone. In October 2019, ViaVan launched the UK's first fully electric fleet serving on-demand shared rides in Milton Keynes. The service began by adding five electric Mercedes- Benz Vito eTourers to its fleet with plans to expand the fleet of on-demand shuttles to thirty electric vehicles by 2020. The funding through Milton Keynes Council supports the Department for Transport's initiatives around Ultra Low Emission Vehicles, which aims to help cities meet targets for reducing carbon emissions and provide an efficient and sustainable on-demand service for passengers. Later that month, ViaVan began operating the third public sector deployment of its technology for on-demand shared rides in Germany in the City of Bielefeld. Called Anton, the on-demand public transportation service is a direct partnership with local public transit operator moBiel, the company behind Germany's Bielefeld Stadtbahn. In November 2019, ViaVan partnered with the Netherland-based oil and gas company Shell to launch a fast-charging shared electric mobility project in Amsterdam. The program integrates ViaVan's on-demand technology and operations, ‚ÄúShell Recharge‚Äù technology, and charging station infrastructure into one seamless system. ViaVan and Shell aim to demonstrate that high-capacity electric fleets can improve performance when routing to available chargers is intelligently optimized.

History On September 16, 2015, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, along with Senators Schatz and Jerry Moran, introduced the Consumer Review Freedom Act of 2015 (S. 2044). The legislation was co- sponsored by Senator Bill Nelson and Senators Richard Blumenthal, Claire McCaskill, Steve Daines, and Cory Booker. Similar legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Darrell Issa on April 29, 2015 (H.R. 2110). On November 4, 2015, the Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing exploring the impact of non-disparagement clauses in form contracts. Witnesses testified that non-disparagement clauses have been used in many industries, including health care, retail, and hospitality. The Committee also heard testimony from Jen Palmer, a consumer and plaintiff in the lawsuit Palmer v. Kleargear.com. In that case, an online retailer demanded that Ms. Palmer remove a negative online review or pay $3,500 in damages because the website's terms of service included a non-disparagement clause. The Senate Commerce Committee received testimony that California has enacted a law to bar such clauses in non-negotiable form contracts. The Committee also learned that the FTC has brought an enforcement action against one company, alleging, inter alia, that the firm's threats to enforce a gag provision against consumers to stop them from posting negative reviews and testimonials online constitute an unfair trade practice in violation of section 5 of the FTC Act. In some cases, judges have refused to enforce non-disparagement clauses in form contracts usually on the grounds of unconscionability. Despite the persuasive rationale of these judicial opinions, the Commerce Committee nevertheless felt that federal legislation was necessary to eliminate any ambiguity over the enforceability of non-disparagement clauses. Summary of Provisions The Consumer Review Fairness Act of 2016 invalidates non-disparagement clauses in certain \\"form contracts\\" (as defined in the statute) and makes it unlawful for a person to offer or enter into a form contract containing a non-negotiable non-disparagement clause. Violations of this prohibition are enforced by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general. The law does not limit the ability of a person or business to file a civil cause of action for defamation, libel, slander, or any similar cause of action under State law. Enforcement History In August 2018, the FTC brought its first case charging violations of the Consumer Review Fairness Act against the marketers behind a purported money-making promotion called Sellers Playbook. In that case, the FTC alleged that, in addition to misrepresenting earnings claims, the defendants offered form contracts to their customers that contained provisions that bar or restrict their customers' ability to engage in reviews and performance assessments, among other things.

The letter makes it clear that Corye had been so incompetent in prosecuting cases on behalf of the English Crown, especially in revenue and exchequer matters, that the Treasury of Ireland had suffered severely from his neglect of duty.

Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics The oldest rocks in Venezuela formed during the Precambrian and occupy the Guiana shield in the southern tier of the country near Guyana and Brazil, east of the El BaUl swell. In the western Guiana Shield, within the Amazonas Territory, Precambrian Roraima Formation zircon grains have been dated with uranium-lead dating and rubidium- strontium dating. Metamorphism and intrusive activity formed gneiss with sedimentary and igneous protoliths around 1.8 billion years ago. Plutons emplaced granite and tonalite after inferred collision and subduction tectonics until around 1.55 billion years ago. The formation's volcanic rocks were produced 1.74 billion years ago. Metamorphism was driven in places by the Trans-Amazonian orogeny. Geochemistry research on the Imataca Complex within metaigneous and metasedimentary rocks reaching granulite grade on the sequence of metamorphic facies suggests high temperature decompression, based on assemblages of sillimanite, kyanite, garnet, orthopyroxene, plagioclase and quartz. =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= The Paleozoic period in Venezuela is primarily exposed in the Andes and the central-western part of the country. Research in the Merida Andes in the 1960s revealed unmetamorphosed sedimentary rocks from the Ordovician, Silurian, Carboniferous and Permian, as well as metamorphosed slate. During the period, North America and South America collided, producing quartz-feldspar gneiss bodies spanning Paria Peninsula into Trinidad. In western Venezuela, geologists have recognized the Apure allochthon, a remnant Paleozoic mountain belt. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= The Merida Arch, a remnant mountain range from the Pennsylvanian controlled sedimentation in the Tachira, Barquisimeto and Machiques as well as the Maracaibo and Barinas basins. The basins are primarily filled with Jurassic and Cretaceous shallow water carbonates. Throughout the Mesozoic, Venezuela was a passive margin of the South American continent. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)= Pull- apart basins began to form, filling with sediments between the Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene and Pliocene. For the most part, Eocene and Oligocene sedimentary rocks survive only in fault-bounded basins. In the mid-Cenozoic, fragments of basement rock were detached by collision of the South American and Caribbean plate. The El Mango Gneiss formed. More broadly schist and gneiss formed in the accretionary wedge. During the Miocene and Pliocene, extensive sediments accumulated in the western Guarico Basin and eastern Maturin Basin.

Germany has three federal intelligence services and 16 state intelligence services. Because they do not form a single entity and because their responsibilities are split between multiple government ministries and even jurisdictions, this is an informal term for all government agencies and components with intelligence duties, used by commentators, scholars and journalists. * The first federal intelligence agency is the Federal Intelligence Service (BND), which is responsible for foreign and strategic intelligence. Additionally, they support the German Armed Forces with military intelligence. Their primary methods of collection are human intelligence, signals intelligence and geospatial intelligence. This is a sharp break with their American and British counterparts, where an intelligence agency mostly specializes on one of these collection methods. The BND is directly subordinated to the German Chancellery, Directorate-General 7. * The second federal intelligence agency is the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV). It is a domestic intelligence agency and tasked with detecting threats to the German state in the form of religious extremism, political extremism and organized crime. Additionally, it is the primary counterintelligence agency of Germany, working to secure classified information, government facilities and private businesses against espionage, sabotage and cyber attacks. The BfV is subordinated to the Federal Ministry of the Interior. Additionally to the BfV, every German state has its own State Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Landesverfassungsschutz√§mter), which is not subordinated to any federal ministry or agency. * The third federal intelligence agency is the Military Counterintelligence Service (MAD). Its duties are much the same as those of the BfV, except limited to the German Armed Forces. Additionally, they analyze tactical intelligence relevant to deployed German troops. As such, they fall within the jurisdiction of the Federal Ministry of Defense. However, they do not conduct traditional military intelligence, which is done by other military branches, as well as the BND. * Other state agencies that use intelligence techniques or collect data, such as the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), the German Customs Investigation Bureau (ZKA), or the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) are not officially regarded as member of the Intelligence Community, although they do participate in coordinative institutions, such as the Joint Centre for Counterterrorism and -extremism (GETZ). The activities of the three federal intelligence agencies are coordinated out of the German Chancellery by the Commissioner for the Federal Intelligence Services and Directorate-General 7. Additionally, they are subject to parliamentary oversight through the Parliamentary Oversight Panel (PKGr). In cases where the agencies want to surveil electronic communications, they have to get permission by the G10-Commission, which acts much like the FISA Court. The traditional primary focus of the German Intelligence Community, originally the West German Intelligence Community, was the threat posed by the Soviet Union and its satellite states.

The plate lists the types of prehistoric monuments on the island, including names and drawings of each of them. Antig√ºedades c√©lticas de la isla de Menorca (\\"Celtic Antiquities of the Island of Menorca\\") is a book written by Menorcan erudite Juan Ramis y Ramis (1746‚Äì1819). Juan Ramis i Ramis It was published in Mah√≥n in 1818 and is the first book/ treatise wholly dedicated to Prehistory in Spain.  Background  Antig√ºedades c√©lticas de la isla de Menorca was written during the last phase in the life of Juan Ramis y Ramis, who started writing it in 1814 and finished it with his death in 1819. Its main subject is Menorcan history, grouping together all what he covered in all the pieces of work that he published in the time, such as Alquer√≠as de Menorca (1815), Varones Ilustres de Menorca (1816), La Alons√≠ada (1818) and the posthumous Historia civil y pol√≠tica de [Menorca] (1819). During this phase in the life of Ramis, Menorca was under the rule of the Spanish monarchy, after it was under British rule on three different periods and also under French rule one time over the 18th century. For this reason, Ramis, who used Catalan as a lingua franca in most of his works, writes in Spanish this time. His main aim was to make the singular character of Menorca known to the rest of Spain through its History.  The book  The book, which deals with the Prehistory of Menorca, was first thought to cover more topics and be divided into three volumes devoted to the civil and political history of the island. Only the first volume was published, since the author died a year later. Ramis‚Äô book is arranged in an introduction and ten chapters, in which the author delves into the knowledge about Menorcan Prehistory following the style in vogue in 18th century Europe, considering that the megalithic constructions of Europe were thought to be Celtic. In the different chapters the author makes a typological classification of the monuments (following the nomenclature that has come down to us: talayot, taula enclosure, naveta...) and offers some interpretations that are not accepted any longer ‚Äìdue to a better knowledge we currently have about the Talayotic culture, thanks to the archaeological excavations carried out in many sites during the 20th century. For instance, he believes the Celts built most of the monuments and that the vast majority of the (Talayotic) buildings had a religious function. Ramis based his writings on the antiquarian tradition in such a way that he tries to explain the archaeological remains through written records. However, he overcomes this limitation since he also uses different types of archaeological objects and structures to obtain information from the Past. In the book he expresses his hypothesis about the irregular distribution of prehistoric settlements on the island, correctly pointing to the environmental conditions defined by types of soil. It is also important to remark the thorough list of prehistoric sites included in the book. Of the 350 talayots which are currently recorded, he mentions 195. Thus, this Menorcan erudite was not only a desk-based researcher. Despite the Enlightenment spirit that can be felt throughout his work, we still find approaches which are typical from previous periods, making reference, for instance, to the biblical roots of the first settlers as well as to writings from several authors who considered that the origins of the Iberians and the Celts were found in Tubal and Tarsis. It was not until the end of the 19th century, when √âmile Cartailhac published his book Monuments Primitifs des Iles Baleares (Primitive monuments of the Balearic Islands), when a proper scientific study started to develop towards the prehistoric monuments of Menorca. Unlike Ramis‚Äô book, published in 1818, Cartailhac's was published in 1892, nearly 30 years after archaeology started to be internationally regarded as a proper scientific discipline. Ramis was the first author who talked about the naveta d'Es Tudons, although his ignorance towards its nature led him to think it was a temple dedicated to goddess Isis. The archaeological excavation conducted by Maria Llu√Øsa Serra Belabre and Llu√≠s Pericot in the second half of the 20th century shed light on its true function, being a collective tomb. A modern approach in his work is his defense of the historical heritage. This attitude is perfectly expressed in his indignation towards the partial destruction of some grinding stones located in a prehistoric site, which happened some years before his book was published.  Book structure  Prologue Introduction Chapter. I Which families or peoples preceded others in populating Menorca? Chapter.

The cars are connected with a gangway, allowing passengers to walk into the adjacent car. The trains are equipped with automatic couplers, enabling operation of up to two units together to form a four-car train. Interior Seating accommodation consists of transverse seating bays as well as folding seats. The trains have displays which show the name of the next station, and CCTV cameras. Passenger information screens and a passenger counting system are implemented in the DT3-F trains. N√ºrnberg DT3 innen.JPGInterior view Technical specifications The car bodies are made out of aluminium, and the trains are powered by three-phase-asynchronous motors. As they are used in automatic operation, the DT3 trains are not equipped with full driving cabs, but only with small concealed driving panels, which are used for maintenance. The DT3-F trains are equipped with full driving cabs, enabling them to be used on driver operated services on non-automated lines. The cabs are designed to be removed in case of a conversion for fully automated operation. Besides the power supply by contact shoes, every unit is also equipped with a pantograph, as parts of the maintenance facilities are electrified with overhead lines. History The first unit was delivered in April 2004 as part of the \\"Rubin\\" project, which planned to introduce fully automated trains on the Nuremberg U-Bahn. Rubin is an acronym for Realisierung einer automatisierten U-Bahn in N√ºrnberg (Implementation of an automated U-Bahn in Nuremberg). Automated test running on line U3 began in January 2005. On May 4, 2008, the first DT3 trains entered automatic revenue service on line U3. Driverless operation was officially launched on June 14, 2008, two years later than anticipated. Originally scheduled for 2006, the official launch of driverless operation had to be pushed back to 2008 due to technical difficulties and mechanical problems, which resulted in the return of two prototype DT3 sets to the supplier Siemens. Fully automatic trial runs on line U2 began on January 13, 2009, while the trains were already in automatic revenue service on line U3. A second batch of 14 DT3 trains was ordered in 2008. These units, classified as DT3-F, feature a full control cab for manual operation, but also can be operated fully automatic. First DT3-F units arrived in Nuremberg at the end of August 2010.

After gaining his baccalaur√©at at the local school he joined a firm of architects before enrolling at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Disappointed with the course, he left to work on the designs for the 1900 Paris Exposition. In 1905, he decided to devote himself to painting, beginning in 1906 at the Salon of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts (SNBA), a painters collective. He exhibited in 1907, 1908, 1913 and 1914 at the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants. In 1925, he took part in the first exhibition by surrealist painters alongside Giorgio De Chirico, Max Ernst and Pablo Picasso, and in 1926 had his first solo exhibition. In 1933 he was appointed for five years as a naval artist. An exhibition devoted to his work was held at the Galerie des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1935, and his work was displayed at the 1937 World's Fair and the Montaigne Gallery in Paris in 1938.

He was regarded as one of the leading representatives of the Russian minority in Estonia during the interwar period.Eesti elulood. Life Sorokin was born into a Russian-speaking family in Tallinn. He attended the Grammar School of Emperor Nikolai I (today Gustav Adolf Grammar School). In 1912, he graduated with a degree in jurisprudence from Saint Petersburg State University. From 1912 to 1914, he worked at the District Court of Tallinn. From 1914, he worked as a lawyer and defense lawyer and as a legal adviser to authorities in Tallinn. With the declaration of independence of Estonia in 1918, Sorokin went into politics. At the end of 1918, he founded the \\"Provisional Russian Council of Estonia\\" (Estonian: Eesti Ajutine Vene N√µukogu) with like-minded people, representing the Russians living in Estonia. In the Provisional Government of Prime Minister Konstantin P√§ts, he represented as a minister from the Russian minority from 28 February to 9 May 1919. He belonged to the Assembly of Russian Citizens (Vene Kodanikkude Kogu, –°–æ–±—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–µ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏—Ö –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω). In the Constituent Assembly (Asutav Kogu) election in April 1919, he was elected as the only member of the Russian minority in the Constituent Assembly. He participated in the drafting of the Constitution of Estonia. However, Sorokin, together with the three deputies representing the Baltic German minority, was not one of the signatories of the Estonian Declaration of Independence on 19 May 1919; he abstained. In the Riigikogu election in November 1920, Sorokin was the only Russian to be voted into the Riigikogu. He was a candidate for the center- right Russian National Federation in Estonia (Vene Rahvuslik Liit Eestis, –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —Å–æ—é–∑ –≤ –≠—Å—Ç–æ–Ω–∏–∏), founded in 1920. In 1923, he resigned from the legislaturehttp://www.riigikogu.ee/public/Riigikogu/Dokumendid/I_Riigikogu_liikmed.pdf and returned to being a lawyer. He remained, along with Nikolai Kurt≈°inski and Peeter Baranin, as a leading member of the Russian minority in Estonia in the interwar period. However, he also failed to assemble the fragmented minority of large social differences into a party or association, as was the case with the Baltic Germans.Sulev Vahtre (ed.)

He later served as State Commissioner of Transport and Communications from July 1972 until January 1975, when he was dismissed and charged with various financial crimes. Eketebi was convicted, but received a pardon in 1994. He died in 2006.  Biography = Early life = Laurent Eketebi was born on 13 May 1936 in Coquilhatville, Belgian Congo to a Ngombe father and a Mongo mother. He attended the administrative and commercial section of the Groupe Scolaire Officiel Congr√©ganiste, run by the Fr√®res des Ecoles Chr√©tiennes in Coquilhatville, where he received six years of primary education and six years of secondary education, graduating in 1954. He later married B√©atrice Lifela Y'Aekesako and had nine children with her. Eketebi worked in the colonial administration, initially serving as a clerk for the √âquateur provincial finance service in the third class of the sixth grade of the civil service. In 1957 he was promoted to a position in the fourth grade, a level normally reserved for Belgians. He held the post until 1960. From 1952 to 1955 he was a member of the council of the Centre Extra- Coutumier de Coquilhatville, an organisation with the responsibility of overseeing the activities of native Congolese in Coquilhatville. Eketebi was a member of the Association du Personnel Indigene de la Colonie, a labour union, and in 1958 he served as its provincial secretary. He also served as secretary-general of the Coquilhatville section of the Fed√©ration du Nord de l'Equateur. Eketebi obtained a prominent position in the √âquateur branch of the Mouvement National Congolais, a political party, but later left it to join Jean Bolikango's Parti de l'Unit√© Nationale (PUNA). = Provincial government career = In March 1960 Eketebi was appointed to the √âquateur Executive College, a transitional body meant to administer the region until the Congo's independence on 30 June. Together with its two other members, he monitored the disorders that occurred during the subsequent general elections. He used his multi-ethnic background to broker a compromise that resulted in a coalition between PUNA, the Parti National du Progr√®s, and the Union des Mongo. The √âquateur Provincial Assembly subsequently elected him president of the province. After the elections PUNA gradually divided into two different wings, one led by Eketebi and the other by Bolikango. Eketebi served as President of √âquateur Province (highlighted) from 30 June 1960 until September 1962. Eketebi took office on 30 June. Despite the secessions of Katanga and South Kasai in July and August, respectively, he actively discouraged separatist activities in √âquateur. His government undertook development projects during its tenure. He approved of Colonel Joseph-Desir√© Mobutu's coup in September which overthrew the central government and the subsequent installation of the College of Commissioners-General. Eketebi participated in the Coquilhatville Conference in May 1961. That year increasing tensions between Ngombe and Mongo factions in the provincial assembly brought about an administrative breakdown. Eketebi worked intensively to improve relations between the two groups. An attempt by several deputies in October to censure his government and force his dismissal failed. His tenure ended in September 1962. √âquateur was subsequently broken up into smaller provinces. On 14 September 1962 Eketebi filed his candidacy for president of the new province of Moyen-Congo. The new provincial assembly subsequently elected him to the post. He was unanimously reelected by the assembly in April 1963 and was invested with the public functions portfolio. In December, Eketebi, in a dispute with Bolikango, defected from PUNA and joined the Parti d√©mocratique congolais. The following month Bolikango called a PUNA congress to Lisala to reorganise his party, despite such political conventions being prohibited by the central government. On 26 January conflict broke out when gendarmes attempted to disperse the attendees. By the end of the next day 19 people were shot and killed. Bolikango and Eketebi both denied responsibility, but the local population held the latter at fault. He became increasingly politically isolated and faced disagreement in his own cabinet; his vice-president requested that the central government depose him. An investigation by a public prosecutor did not hold anyone responsible for the 26/27 January incident, but nevertheless concluded that Moyen-Congo was in crisis. The central government subsequently proclaimed an √©tat d‚Äôexception in the province and placed it under the control of a special commissioner. Opposition deputies from Lisala and Bumba were thus able to meet to discuss the dismantling of Eketebi's government. In early June the Lisala-Bumba deputies replaced the pro-Eketebi President of the Assembly and forced all of the ministers of the government to resign. Eketebi narrowly escaped a censure vote only due to his popular support in the Bomongo and Lisala territories. Then on 21 June the provincial deputies brought up a motion of censure. Accusing him of partisan and discriminatory politics, disorganisation, lacking in an effective government programme, misappropriating public funds for personal purposes, encouraging corruption, stoking conflict between the Bumba and Lisala regions, and holding responsibility in the January incident, they voted to dismiss him. Still in possession of the support of some riverine peoples, he challenged the legitimacy of the government that replaced his. However, in the 1965 elections Bolikango was reelected to his seat in the national Parliament by a wide margin, thus eclipsing Eketebi's popularity in the region. = National government career = Eketebi served as Deputy Director of the Office of the Head of State from December 1965 until 1969. From 1969 until 1970, he served as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Tanzania. From January to July 1971, he served as Ambassador to the Conseil de l'Entente with residence in Abidjan. On 2 July 1971 Eketebi was appointed Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs by President Mobutu. In July 1972 he was made State Commissioner of Transport and Communications. On 7 January 1975 he was dismissed from his post. Later that month Eketebi was stripped of the National Order of the Leopard and a criminal investigation was opened against him. The government accused him of misappropriating 14 million zaires, 58 million Belgian francs, and 727,000 United States dollars, and filed 48 charges of corruption and financial crimes against him. The Supreme Court of Justice dismissed his attempts in limini litis to halt the proceedings by claiming immunity under Amnesty Law no. 74/023 of 27 November 1974. He was convicted on several counts of misappropriation of public funds and his property was seized by the government. = Later life = Ektebi was pardoned on 18 October 1994. He died in February 2006.

The company was co-founded in 2014 by Jordan Katzman and Alex Fenkell. It is based in Nashville, Tennessee.  Products  SmileDirectClub produces 3D-printed clear aligners. SmileDirectClub aligners are a competitor of traditional braces and clear alignment companies like Invisalign. Communication with licensed orthodontic professionals and other SmileDirectClub staff takes place virtually. Impression kits are sent to customers, after which teeth molds are reviewed by dentists or orthodontists who oversee the treatment process. The company reportedly works with 225 licensed professionals. While most business and dentistry is conducted online, the company has 300 retail locations across the United States, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom.  History  SmileDirectClub celebrating the company's IPO listing on NASDAQ SmileDirectClub in Time's Square The company initially partnered with Align Technology as an exclusive third-party distributor for its aligners. After a dispute over violation of a non-compete clause claiming Align \\"misused confidential SmileDirectClub information and violated its fiduciary duties,\\" Align was ordered by an arbitrator to close its retail locations. The American Association of Orthodontists (AAO) has filed complaints with 36 state dental boards, alleging that SmileDirectClub violates regulatory standards. According to SmileDirectClub representatives, 12 of the cases have been closed and no adverse legal action has been taken against the company. The AAO has stated that only five states confirmed closed cases. In October 2018, SmileDirectClub raised $380 million in an investment round led by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice and Kleiner Perkins, for a $3.2 billion valuation according to Bloomberg. SmileDirectClub was initially funded by Camelot Venture Group. NBA player Draymond Green was an early investor in the company, investing in 2015, after personally using its products. The company expanded into Canada in November 2018, and expanded into the UK and Australia in 2019. During the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, SmileDirectClub announced a collaboration with singer Shawn Mendes on campaign to show \\"that confidence is gained with an amazing smile.\\" In April 2019, CVS announced that the company would add SmileDirectClub locations to hundreds of CVS stores.

IRA and Irish National Liberation Army Volunteers in Strabane carried out attack after attack against the British security forces, between 1971 and 1991 no fewer than 16 attacks were launched by Irish Republicans against British troops and RUC police which resulted in the death of at least one member of the British security forces in each of those attacks, the British Army and RUC bases in Strabane were constantly attacked with sniper fire, bombings, grenades, mortar attacks and RPG attacks. Strabane was once the most bombed town in Europe in proportion to its size, and was the most bombed town in Northern Ireland. A few weeks earlier in December 1984 the SAS carried out two ambushes against the Provisional IRA Derry Brigade which killed four IRA volunteers, in the first in the Kesh ambush Kieran Fleming and another IRA volunteer was killed, four days later Kieran's cousin William Fleming and Danny Doherty were killed in another ambush.Lost Lives, 2007 edition, p. 1002, Ambush  100px On the 23 February 1985 an IRA active service unit while returning weapons or bringing new weapons to an arms cache in Plumbridge Road in Strabane were suddenly ambushed by British Army Special Air Service (SAS) unit and all three IRA volunteers were killed on the spot. Local witness said they heard that no warning to surrender was given by the SAS as the men entered a field which is when the SAS unit fired over 100 rounds at the Volunteers killing them instantly.

It is one of the largest such cases of its kind in U.S. history. San Francisco was governed at the time (2004 ‚Äì 2008) by a sanctuary city policy first adopted in 1989 by the city's board of supervisors, which strictly prohibited local police officers from cooperating with federal immigration law enforcement. This situation was significant because many of the gang members targeted by Operation Devil Horns were not citizens of the United States and thus were subject to possible deportation to their home countries in Central America. Numerous of the criminal defendants in the case argued during their trials that they were victims of illegal entrapment by the federal investigators in Operation Devil Horns, stemming from the actions of criminal informants who were controlled by HSI agents. However, this legal defense strategy ultimately proved unsuccessful in all but one minor case.  Criminal Investigation  Operation Devil Horns originated in 2004 with investigations by HSI into the presence and activities of an MS-13 clique known as ‚Äú20th Street,‚Äù based in the Mission District of San Francisco, an area with a large population of Central American and Mexican immigrants. At the time, violent crime in the neighborhood was a major problem. Citywide, San Francisco had one of the highest murder rates and one of the lowest solution rates for homicide cases in the nation. For several years leading up to the investigation, 20th Street gang members had maintained a constant presence in Mission Park, where they frequently terrorized and recruited youths who entered the park to play soccer, basketball, or other games. Despite pledges from senior leaders of SFPD to put an end to the gang's violence and intimidation at the park, 20th Street continued to claim the playground as their \\"turf.\\" Composed mainly of illegal immigrants from the Central American countries of El Salvador and Honduras, MS-13's 20th Street clique members were in virtually constant turf battles against the Nortenos gang, composed mainly of individuals of Mexican descent. Assassinations and violent clashes between the two rival gangs occurred frequently on Mission District streets, sometimes in broad daylight and witnessed by innocent bystanders. Targeting the gang, agents from HSI reached out to certain members of SFPD's gang task force for assistance in identifying key members of 20th Street, with the ultimate objective of applying federal RICO laws to dismantle their entire organization. When an MS-13 gang member from Honduras named Roberto Acosta, aka ‚ÄúZorro,‚Äù was arrested by SFPD for a misdemeanor jaywalking violation, he was turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Under threat of deportation, Costa agreed to act as a criminal informant for HSI agents and successfully infiltrated the 20th Street clique. On June 22, 2008, a 20th Street clique member named Edwin Ramos participated in the slayings of three innocent victims who were members of the Bologna family in San Francisco, including Anthony Bologna and his two sons, Michael and Matthew. The fact that Ramos had been previously arrested twice by SFPD for violent crimes as a juvenile but was never deported to his home country of El Salvador led to national attention on San Francisco's sanctuary policy. This controversy led federal investigators in the Operation Devil Horns case to hasten the investigation's conclusion. On October 22, 2008, approximately 300 state, local, and federal law enforcement officers, including numerous SWAT teams, simultaneously executed warrants at 35 locations in the San Francisco Bay Area, arresting 28 alleged gang members. No significant injuries occurred during the arrests. Several months after the arrests there was a noteworthy decline in violence on San Francisco's streets. All forms of violent crime in the city declined by 20 percent compared to the prior year, while homicides were reduced by 60 percent.  Trials and Convictions  Two of the arrested 20th Street gang members pleaded guilty in November 2010 to murder in the aid of racketeering. In early 2011, the criminal informant Roberto Acosta surprised prosecutors by admitting he had committed at least eight homicides as an MS-13 member in Honduras, prior to signing on as an informant for HSI. He was dismissed as an informant for the prosecution and charged with felonies related to lying to federal investigators. Two more gang members pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder, soon followed by the clique's leader Ivan Cerna, aka Tigre, who pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy and illegal firearms charges, receiving twenty-five years in federal prison, but avoiding a possible death penalty. In August 2011, six more gang members arrested in Operation Devil Horns were convicted by a jury of racketeering conspiracy and murder in aid of racketeering. In August 2012, Wilfredo Reyes, aka Flaco, was apprehended by HSI in North Carolina and charged as an accomplice to Edwin Ramos in the Bologna family murders. Reyes accepted a plea deal in July 2015, receiving a ten-year prison sentence. In total, the Operation Devil Horns investigation and prosecutions led to convictions of more than 37 gang members on racketeering charges, with the most violent leaders of the gang receiving life sentences. US Attorney General Eric Holder bestowed a Distinguished Service Award to members of the Operation Devil Horns investigation and prosecution teams for their work in combating MS-13 in San Francisco. Recipients of the award included individuals from DOJ's Northern District of California office and Organized Crime and Gang Section, the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division, the Department of Homeland Security, and two police sergeants from the San Francisco Police Department.

She was a member of the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland and served as a member of the Grand Council of Geneva. In 1965 she became the first woman to serve as president of a Swiss cantonal council.  Life = Provenance and early years = Emma Kammacher was the daughter of Christian Kammacher who came from a Bernese farming family, and of Catherine √âmilie Desplands, originally from Rougemont at the eastern end of the adjacent (and francophone) canton of Vaud. Kammacher was born in Meyrin, just outside Geneva, on the south side of the city. She was educated at the Coll√®ge Calvin in Geneva and she then went on to study law at Bern. she obtained her license to practice law in 1929. She then moved back to Geneva, where she passed her bar examination in 1932. She was now able to work on behalf of clients. The focus of her work during these early years was on defending those who had fallen victim to the economic crash and found themselves without basic rights, resolving to use her legal qualifications and experience to work for changes in the law and public attitudes.Brigitte Mantilleri, Faces √† faces 06/09 : exposition Uni Dufour, du 3 juin au 30 septembre 2009, Gen√®ve, Universit√© de Gen√®ve, 2009, p. 123. = Women's rights = In 1932 Kammacher became de facto secretary of the , working alongside Emilie Gourd to campaign for women's voting rights on a cantonal level. Nationally she was a member - and according to one source secretary  of the cantonal association's national counterpart, known at that time as the Association suisse pour le suffrage f√©minin (ASSF), which pursued the same objectives nationally. Emilie Gourd died in December 1946 and Kammacher took on the presidency of the Geneva association in 1947, serving in that position till 1955. Particularly strong support and encouragement in the struggle for women's rights in the legal profession and more broadly came from Nelly Schreiber-Favre (1872- 1972), who back at the start of the twentieth century had become the first woman lawyer to gain admittance to the Geneva Bar association.Anna Spillmann, ¬´ Portrait de trois pionni√®res de l'ar√®ne politique ¬ª, Gauchebdo, no 23, 10 June 2011 Kammacher was in addition a member of the committee behind the monthly publication \\"Le mouvement f√©ministe\\" (renamed during 1960 \\"Femmes suisses\\"). = 1961: Grand Council of Geneva membership = At that time (as now) Geneva was among the more politically progressive of the (then) 25 cantons, and on 6 March 1960 it became just the third canton to legislate for the introduction of women's suffrage in cantonal elections. Emma Kammacher launched herself into the world of cantonal politics.Erica Deuber Ziegler (dir.) et Natalia Tikhonov (dir.), Les femmes dans la m√©moire de Gen√®ve, Gen√®ve, √âditions Suzanne Hurter, 2005, p. 266-267. She stood as a candidate for the \\"Parti socialiste suisse\\" (loosely but conventionally translated: \\"Social Democratic Party\\" / SP), which was the first party actually to include women on its candidates list. In 1961 Emma Kammacher was one of nine women elected to of the \\"Grand Conseil de Gen√®ve\\" (cantonal legislature). In 1965 she was elected president of the legislature, becoming the first woman to achieve this distinction in any of the cantonal parliaments. = 1965: Grand Council of Geneva president with a women's rights agenda = Her position on the cantonal legislature provided Kammacher with an invaluable platform for her advocacy of pressing feminist causes. The right to vote in national elections, already taken for granted in surrounding western European democracies, was at the top of the list. On 22 February 1965 Geneva's newly elected Grand Council president, both in her own name and in the names of 564 women co-signatories from Geneva, submitted an appeal to the \\"Conseil f√©d√©ral\\" (Federal Council - Switzerland's seven member collective executive head of state ) against the refusal of the \\"Conseil d'√©tat cantonal\\" (Geneva's Council of State) to permit those Genevois citizens who were women to vote in national elections to the \\"Assembl√©e f√©d√©rale\\" (Swiss national parliament)). Kammacher's case reflected her legal experience. The term \\"Swiss citizen\\" used in the Swiss Federal Constitution applied equally to men and to women. There was no indication, implicit or express, that the term should be restricted to just one sex. That meant that voting rights and other constitutional eligibilities applied equally to Swiss citizens who were female. Kammacher also argued that the voting rights and eligibilities accorded by the constitution nationally were based on the same rights as those accorded in the canton of a citizen's domicile. Given that, in Geneva, since 6 March 1960, women had no longer been excluded from exercising their civic rights in cantonal elections, there was no reason for the cantonal authorities to refuse those same civic rights in respect of federal (national) elections. The reaction of the \\"Conseil f√©d√©ral\\" to the appeal from Geneva was not wholly surprising. Female voting rights and eligibilities at a federal (national) level could be granted only on the basis of a national majority vote [of - at that time - participating male voters], and with backing from the majority of the 25 cantons. That meant a rejection of the appeal organised by Kammacher, but as matters turned out she had nevertheless advanced the cause of votes for women nationally by pushing it up the national agenda. In the end, following a further six years of campaigning, the necessary referendum was held on 7 February 1971. 944,991 [men] voted. More than 65% voted in favour of giving women the vote in national elections, and there was a majority in favour of the move in more than half of the cantons. Emma Kammacher had retired from active politics, but the battle in which she had for so long engaged was finally won. Kammacher also used her presidency to promote sex equality in canton-level legislation. She pressed for reform of the legal framework for marriage in ways which would eliminate gender bias and create the possibility of financial independence for married women. She campaigned against the different prices paid for sickness insurance by women, and against the absurdity whereby (female) employees were forced to accept unpaid \\"maternity leave\\", rather than being able to benefit from a system of \\"maternity insurance\\". Through example and exhortation, Emma Kammacher encouraged [female] citizens to participate in public debates on the issues which concerned them. Although commentators have concentrated on her role in advancing the cause of votes for women, Emma Kammacher's contributions as a member and then as president of the cantonal legislature covered a far wider range of issues. Having herself grown up in a family of very modest means, she was always quick to identify with those adversely impacted, whether among the rural population or in the cities, by the social problems that accompanied Switzerland's economic resurgence during, most strikingly, the 1960s. She helped many people with housing problems or difficulties accessing appropriate educational opportunities for their children because they were socially disadvantaged - on low wages or ethnically different from mainstream populations in a village or municipality. = Retirement and death = Ten years after the referendum that ushered in universal adult suffrage on the national level Emma Kammacher died in Le Grand-Saconnex at the age of 76. She had continued to practice law until a few months before her death.

Regitze Sophie Vind's son, baron Vilhelm Frederik Gyldenkrone, took over the estate in 1702. His widow Anne Vind Banner kept the estate after his death in 1708. Ger new husband, Hans Rantzau, sold Taastrup and Aalstrup in 1728. =1728‚Äì1924: The Reventlow family= The new owner was count Christian Detlev Reventlow. He had acquired the estates Krenkerup, Rosenlund and N√∏rreg√•rd on Lolland through his marriage to Benedicte Margrethe Brockdorff in 1700 and had a few years earlier also purchased Pederstrup and Skeltofte. In 1723, he also purchased Lungholm. His other holdings included the countship of Reventlow in Southern Jutland and the barony of Brahetrolleborg on Funen from 1722. In 1729, he was able to establish the countship of Christiansborg. Its name was changed to Christianss√¶de when Copenhagen Castle was renamed Christiansborg in 1741, Christian Ditlev Reventlow, Christian Ditlev Reventlow's youngest son, became the second holder of the countship of Christianss√¶de when his father died in 1738. He also received the remaining holdings on Lolland, the countship of Reventlow and the barony of Brahetrolleborg when his elder brother died without male heirs in 1759, Christianss√¶de in 1888 Christian Ditlev Reventlow passed away in 1775 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Christian Ditlev Frederik Reventlow, who later served as prime minister. The countship of Reventlow was passed to his second oldest son, Conrad Reventlow, while the barony of Brahetrolleborg passed to his youngest son Johan Ludvig Reventlow. The countships of Christianss√¶de and Reventlow were once again unified when Conrad Reventlow died without male heirs in 1815. Christian Ditlev Frederik Reventlow introduced many of the agricultural reforms that later spread to the rest of the country. Christian Ditlev Frederik Reventlow lived on the Pederstrup estate but died at Christianss√¶de in 1827. His successor was Christian Ditlev Reventlow. He continued his father's reforms. His son, Ferdinand Carl Otto Reventlow died in 1875. His widow, Benedicte Reventlow, resided at Christianss√¶de. She renovated the main building and redesigned the park. Her son, Christian Einar Ferdinand Ludvig Eduard Reventlow, used Brahetrolleborg as his primary residence and only used Christianss√¶de for shorter visits. =1924‚Äìpresent: Later history= The countship was dissolved in 1924 as a result of the lensafl√∏sningsloven of 1919. Christian Einar Ferdinand Ludvig Eduard Reventlow died in 1929. His only son had died the previous year. His remaining heirs, his widow and three daughters, sold Christianss√¶de in 1934. The new owner was Peter Christian Ege Olsen. In 1935, he sold off much of the land. The main building and park was separated from the remaining land in 1938. The home farm and associated land was still owned by Peter Christian Ege Olsen's descendants in 2013. The main building changed hands several times before it was acquired by Lolland-Falsters Plejehjemsforening and converted into an orphanage for boys in 1952.

It depicts the moment towards the end of the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815, when the commanders of the allied British and Prussian armies, the Duke of Wellington and Marshal Bl√ºcher, met near La Belle Alliance. Measuring , it is displayed in the Royal Gallery at the Palace of Westminster. The work was commissioned in 1858, to decorate the newly reconstructed Palace of Westminster. Maclise first completed a full-size cartoon as a preparatory work in 1859, which is in the collection of the Royal Academy of Arts, and the painting was completed in 1861. It was intended to be a part of a series of 18 paintings by Maclise to decorate the Royal Gallery, but only two large panels were finished. The other large panel, The Death of Nelson, completed in 1865, depicts the death of Admiral Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 (a full-size sketch for the Death of Nelson was purchased by the Walker Art Gallery in 1892). Prince Albert was one of the principal supporters of the project, but progress with the project was slow, and the remaining 16 pictures were cancelled after Albert's death in 1861. Waterloo Cartoon View of the Royal Gallery in 1911, with The Meeting of Wellington and Bl√ºcher after the Battle of Waterloo to the right, and The Death of Nelson to the left Maclise was commissioned to decorate the new Royal Gallery after he completed frescoes showing The Spirit of Chivalry and The Spirit of Justice in the new chamber for the House of Lords in the 1840s. Maclise started work on a full-size preparatory cartoon, the Waterloo Cartoon, in March 1858. The cartoon is divided into 10 panels and is over wide, with the figures depicted life size. It was enthusiastically received when it was displayed in 1859. Maclise died in 1870, and the cartoon was acquired by the Royal Academy the same year. It was displayed at Burlington House until the 1920s. After 40 years in store, the Waterloo Cartoon was conserved and put on display at Royal Armouries in Leeds and the Royal Academy for the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo in 2015. Description Wellington and Bl√ºcher from Maclise's painting, reproduced in the underpass at Hyde Park Corner Maclise started work on the painting in January 1860, and completed it during the winter of 1861. It was initially intended to be a fresco, with paint applied to wet plaster, but the work was completed using a waterglass technique, applying paint to dry plaster and then fixing it with potassium silicate. The completed painting measures . The scene is set in front of La Belle Alliance, an inn a few miles south of Brussels, around which was fought the Battle of Waterloo. At the centre of the painting is Wellington, soberly dressed in a plain uniform with cloak and \\"fore-and-aft\\" bicorn cocked hat, holding a telescope, and mounted on his horse Copenhagen, shaking hands with Bl√ºcher. A French eagle standard lies discarded beneath his horse's feet. He is attended by Captain Lord Arthur Hill, Major-General Lord Edward Somerset and Major the Hon. Henry Percy, who carried the Waterloo Dispatch to London, with escorts from the Life Guards and the 1st Regiment of the Royal Horse Guards (the Blues). Slightly left of centre, Bl√ºcher is depicted wearing a forage cap (originally Maclise portrayed him with a feathered cocked hat, but later changed it), and is attended by his generals August Ludwig von Nostitz, Prince Frederick of Prussia, August Neidhardt von Gneisenau, Hans Ernst Karl von Zieten, Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B√ºlow, and Karl von Grolman. To the left are two British cavalry officers, Colonel Sir John Ormsby Vandeleur, and Major-General Sir Hussey Vivian on a white horse with sloped sword. The scene is crowded with soldiers and other bystanders, often in poses inspired by classical works, or Old Master paintings or more contemporary models. The emphasis to dead and dying soldiers may be derived from Antoine-Jean Gros's 1809 painting Napol√©on on the Battlefield of Eylau. To the left is a broken artillery piece with some dead and wounded British and French soldiers piled up in a pyramidal composition reminiscent of Th√©odore Gericault's 1818-19 painting, Raft of the Medusa. One soldier has a tourniquet around his arm, and another's wound is being dressed by a surgeon. Behind them, a Prussian band are playing brass instruments: accounts from the battle report that the band played \\"God Save the King\\" at the meeting of Wellington and Bl√ºcher, to which the English replied with three cheers for the Prussians. To the right, a Highland soldier from the Black Watch, an English Guardsman, and an Irish Fusilier, are carrying the body of Major the Hon. Frederick Howard (the \\"young, gallant Howard\\" mentioned in Lord Byron's poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage) and a group of camp followers, including a vivandi√®re or cantini√®re, a Sister of Charity, and a tonsured priest delivering the last rites to an officer. In the background, a peasant woman is looting from the dead on the battlefield. In the background, the army is advancing along a road. The copyright was acquired by the Art Union of London in 1865, and Lumb Stocks made an engraving of the painting from photographs of the original. It was often sold with an engraving of the companion work, The Death of Nelson.

While no longer in mainstay use, the baoli has been persevered as a tourist attraction.  History = Background = Due to the infrequent nature of rainstorms in Haryana, water-gathering and holding structures known as stepwells or baoli were constructed to capture rainwater for agricultural and domestic use.Davies, Philip (1989).

The Diverse Architectural World of The Indian Sub-Continent. Retrieved 2009-11-18. The water reserves stored by stepwells like the Choron ki baoli aided in conserving water during long periods of droughts. As such, many similar structures were built in Northwestern India. The Choron ki baoli was built in the town of Maham between the years 1658-1659 on the orders of Saidu Kala, a local official. Kala was a member of the Rajastani Chobdar caste and a vassal of Emperor Shah Jahan of the Mughal Empire, who was himself a great patron of architecture. The stepwell built in Maham was intended to alleviate some of the effects of the seasonal drought the town suffered through. In addition, some sources state that treasures looted during the Mughal army's wars were intended to be hidden inside the baoli and in the surrounding area. = Description = The structure itself contains three separate chambers in which to hold increasing amounts of water; as rain was collected by the structure, one level at a time would be filled. A total of 101 steps lead down to the lowest point of the reservoir. In addition to holding water, rooms were built within and around the stepwell to house travelers and passersby. The entire project was constructed out of bricks and kankar (cement) blocks. As of 2018, the structure has decayed, with some of its original carvings and inscriptions having been worn away.

It was unveiled in 1922, and is sited near the northwest corner of Streatham Common. A Streatham War Memorial General Council was established in 1919 with plans to build a large Hall of Remembrance in Streatham to commemorate the 720 servicemen from the district killed during the First World War. The memorial council bought land on the Chimes estate near Streatham Common, but lack of funding meant the ambitious scheme was not implemented. Instead, the plan was changed so that the Chimes building would become a servicemen's club, with a memorial garden and war memorial. Limited funding also prevent this plan from being realised, and the building was sold to the United Services Club in 1922, other land was sold to London County Council, and the proceeds were used to build the war memorial. The selected designer was Albert Toft. The memorial comprises a square column of white stone on a tapering base, topped by a life- size bronze statue of a soldier. The soldier stands in service dress with his head uncovered and bowed, with his hands resting on a reversed rifle resting on his left boot. At his feet lie an army jacket, a steel helmet and a gas mask. The sculpture was based on Toft's Boer War memorial in Ipswich, and he included identical statues in the First World War memorials he designed for Stone, Staffordshire, Leamington, Warwickshire and Thornton-Cleveleys, Lancashire. The plinth bears the inscription \\"TO / OUR GLORIOUS DEAD\\" and two bronze wreaths, the top one inscribed \\"1914‚Äì1918\\" and the bottom one inscribed \\"1939‚Äì1945\\". A bronze plaque added in 2010 reads: \\"IN HONOUR OF / THE MEN AND WOMEN OF STREATHAM / WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES IN THE SERVICE / OF THEIR COUNTRY IN TWO WORLD WARS / 1914‚Äì1918 AND 1939‚Äì1945 / AND IN OTHER CONFLICTS / At the going down of the sun and in the morning / we will remember them / FROM THE PEOPLE OF STREATHAM 2010\\" (quoting lines from Laurence Binyon's \\"Ode of Remembrance\\"). The memorial was unveiled on 14 October 1922 by General Sir Charles Monro, 1st Baronet, with a dedication by the Anglican Bishop of Southwark, Cyril Garbett. The ceremony was attended by a crowd of 6,000 people. The war dead were listed on Roll of Honour held at Streatham Library, but the document has been lost. The nearby club building was damaged by a V1 flying bomb in July 1944 and demolished. The grounds became a housing estate, with the memorial confined to a small garden. The memorial was extended to commemorate the war dead of the Second World War, and it was re-dedicated in on 8 May 1959 by the Mayor of Wandsworth, Councillor Ronald Ash. The war memorial garden was transferred to Lambeth Council in 1971. It was Grade II listed in December 2016 The memorial stands on a square of grass surrounded by iron railings and a paved area. Plaques set into the paving in front of the memorial commemorate the award of the Victoria Cross to three men from the district: Frederick Henry Johnson, Geoffrey Cather and Alfred Fleming-Sandes. A civilian war memorial is also located in the memorial gardens. The memorial is a contemporary sculpture by Ekkehard Altenburger erected in 2006 which takes the form of plain stone obelisk carved from Irish blue limestone from Kilkenny on a plinth of the same material inscribed with a quotation from a poem by Rohit Sapra: \\"Grief has no boundaries\\".

The chemical formula of trioctylamine is C24H51N and the molecular weight is 353.67 g/mol  Physical and chemical properties  It is a clear colorless method and can be converted to the amine hydrochloride etherate which is recrystallized four times from diethyl ether at -30 ¬∞C. Neutralization of this salt regenerates the free amine which distilled under high vacuum. It has melting point of ‚àí34 ¬∞C; boiling point of 164-168 ¬∞C at 0.7 mmHg and 365-367 ¬∞C at 1 atm; density of 0.810 g/mL at 20 ¬∞C; refractive index of n20/D 1.449; flash point of >230 ¬∞F; storage temperature is below 30 ¬∞C. It can easily soluble in chloroform; it has a form of low melting crystalline mass, and it has the color of white to off-white. It is miscible with chloroform but immiscible with water. It is air sensitive. There is a safety hazard for this chemical compound. It can cause skin irritation, serious eye irritation, and respiratory irritation. It can damage fertility or the unborn child and cause damage to organs through prolonged or repeated exposure. It is very toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects.  Application  Trioctylamine is used to extract organic acids such as succinic acid and acetic acid, and also precious metals. A formulation containing metoxuron mixed with an emulsion containing trioctylamine 50%, atlox 4851 B 15%, and isopropanol 35% was active as a potato defoliant. Trioctylamine can be used to extract monocarboxylic acid for equilibria and correlation of apparent reactive equilibrium constant. Liquid-liquid equilibria for aqueous solutions of carboxylic acids with trioctylamine in various diluents was determined at various trioctylamine concentrations. The loading of trioctylamine for a given carboxylic acid depends on the nature of the solute and its concentration. The apparent extraction equilibrium constants depend on the hydrophobicity and acidity of the carboxylic acid, as well as the specific basicity of trioctylamine. Trioctylamine production can be used as a mineral extraction reagent, an extractant for reactor fuel processing, and its use as an extractant for identification of dyes may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams.

Researcher for the Canadian government during the Second World war and then professor at McGill University from 1945 until his retirement in 1979, he was renowned for his research in cloud physics and precipitation, but especially for being a pioneer of weather radar. Biography=Early life= Stewart Marshall was born on July 18, 1911 in Welland, Ontario, Canada. He attended Queen's University in Kingston, where he got in 1931 a bachelor's degree in Physics and Mathematics, and graduated a master's degree in 1933 with a dissertation on scattering of electrons by metallic foils. After pausing to cure tuberculosis, he entered Cambridge University on a scholarship to study nuclear physics. =Second World War= Marshall was recalled to Canada in 1939 to join the National Research Council of Canada in Ottawa and participate in the war effort. In Canada, he first worked on ballistics problems, then on experiments with a brand new invention, the radar. He was among the first to recognize that an artifact that sometimes obscured ships and planes on radar data was caused by rain and snow. In 1943, Marshall underwent thoracic surgery to fight a reappearance of tuberculosis and then took the lead of the \\"Stormy Weather\\" project by the Canadian Department of National Defense whose purpose was to find a use for these parasitic echoes. The analysis of precipitation backscatter properties made it obvious that the undesirable interference provided a new way to observe the atmosphere. =Career at McGill= Just after the war, Marshall and R. H. Douglas formed the \\"Stormy Weather Group\\" at McGill University and continued their work.. Different instruments were used by the group in research on the fundamental properties of precipitation. They were mounted at Dawson College, just south of the university's main campus. In the mid-1950s, the Stormy Weather Group's contribution included the study of cloud physics, radar precipitation echo properties, early radar application to storm surveys, and precipitation monitoring at wider scale. Some of the topics closely associated with Marshall are the raindrop size distribution, the study of the snow virga slope, radar signal fluctuation, coalescence and radar displays like CAPPI and HARPI. In 1968, the need for a more permanent radar led to the construction of the current observatory, which was named the J. S. Marshall Radar Observatory a little later in honor of the founder of the research group. At the same time Marshall was leading the research group, he was a professor of physics and meteorology at McGill University. The activities of the \\"Stormy Weather Group\\" attracted more and more graduates and, in large part, enabled the formation of the full-fledged meteorological department in 1959, the first in Canada. As director and founder, Stewart Marshall has profoundly influenced the teaching of meteorology, his department serving as a model for the creation of half a dozen programs across Canada. =Dissemination of knowledge= Marshall and R. C. Langille, a colleague from Ottawa, were the only Canadians to attend the first radar meteorology conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1947. He organized the third conference at McGill in 1952 with two of his first PhD students: Walter Hitschfeld and Kenrick Gunn. Marshall also organized the 11th conference in Boulder in 1964, co-sponsored by the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the International Union of Radio Science (IURS), and the 13th conference in 1968, again in Montreal. Recognition Stewart Marshall and his doctoral student, Walter Palmer, became famous for their work on the distribution of mid-latitude raindrops that led to the relationship between radar return (Z for reflectivity) and precipitation rate (R): the ZR relation. Marshal has published many articles. He has served on numerous scientific and educational committees in Canada and the United States. He was a Fellow of the American Meteorological Society and served a term on the AMS Board from 1965 to 1967. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1953. He has received several awards: * In 1961, the Patterson Medal of the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society * In 1982, the Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Advance of Applied Meteorology by the AMS * The Hugh Robert Mill Medal of the Royal Meteorological Society References * AMS Code RADMET Also=Related articles= * J.

In Indonesia, Directorate General of Customs and Excise, Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia is responsible for collecting excise.  Benefit  Usually in Indonesia excise is imposed more because of the negative influence on society and the environment of the product, in addition to earning income. So that the imposition of excise expenses is expected to reduce the consumption of these products. While for cigarette excise, in addition to suppressing consumption, the Perpres explicitly also requires that cigarette excise tax be used as a health fund through the BPJS budget in the region. The characteristics of goods affected by excise in Indonesia include: * the consumption needs to be controlled, * the circulation needs to be monitored, * its use can have a negative effect on society or the environment, or its use needs to be imposed on state levies for justice and balancing reason.Cukai. reference: Situs Cukai History The history of excise in Indonesia is linked to the existence of customs. Logically, this organization has logically existed since the earliest kingdom establishment and the trading in and out through sea and land transportation was done. But literally, the one who established customs was the Dutch Colonial Government, with the name De Dienst der Invoer en Uitvoerrechten en Accijnzen or the free translation of the Import and Export Service and Excise. His job is to collect invoer-rechten (entry duties), uitvoer-rechten (exit duties), and accijnzen (excise). If Bea (customs) word comes from Sanskrit, then cukai comes from Indian Language, which if translated in English means \\"excise\\", hence Bea dan Cukai. Sejarah Bea dan Cukai. reference: beacukai.go.id Later regulation which underlies customs and excise was Besluit Gouvernment Number 33 dated December 22, 1928, which was later amended by a government decree dated June 1, 1934. During the Japanese occupation, new rules were made the task of arranging import duties and export duties is eliminated, while Customs only takes care of excise, ruled by Undang-Undang No 13 concerning the Opening of Government Offices in Java and Sumatra on 29 April 1942 In the past many goods were affected by excise because the colonial government tried as hard as possible to limit the circulation of goods needed by the people. One of those affected by excise is sugar and cement. But at this time only cigarettes, alcohol, and electric cigarettes were affected by excise. But in the future, it is possible for other items to be subject to excise. Under Indonesian rule, Customs and Excise was held again on October 1, 1946 under the name Pejabatan Bea dan Cukai (Customs and Excise Office). At that time the Deputy Finance Minister, Sjafrudin Prawiranegara, appointed R.A Kartadjoemena as the first Head of Customs and Excise. Based on Peraturan Pemerintah No 51 Tahun 1948, the term Pejabatan Bea dan Cukai changed to Jawatan Bea dan Cukai, which lasted until 1965. After 1965 until now, the name became the Dirjen Bea dan Cukai (Directorate General of Customs and Excise). Reformation of the bureau Since the 1998 reformation era, various improvements have been made in organizations that were once known to be vulnerable to corruption, collusion, and nepotism. Customs and Excise continues to clean up and settle the problems that make the entry and exit of goods in Indonesia become complicated and vulnerable to fraud. This effort has been appreciated by GIMMI, the Indonesian Vegetable Oil Industry Association, such as effort to reduce the number of disputes in determining the classification of goods. In addition, several other areas that are also being improved are industrial and trading facilitation, services enhancement, community protection, and revenue optimization. One of the major activities which is also being promoted by the Customs in this reform is the Program Penertiban Impor Berisiko Tinggi (Control of High Risk Imported Good Program).

Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics Much of Ecuador is underlain by Precambrian igneous and metamorphic crystalline basement rocks. The Piedras Group rocks date to the period and outcrop in El Oro Province on the western Andean slope in the southwest of the country and includes greenschist and amphibolite with small intercalations of quartz-sericite schist and quartzite, dated to 743 million years ago in the Proterozoic. These high-grade, polymetamorphic rocks often signs of overprinting and green hornblende with a feather-like texture is found in the amphibolite. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= Continental and oceanic terranes began to be added to western South America in the Mesozoic. In north-central Ecuador, the Peltetec- Portovelo fault marks the suture between the pre-existing South American craton and the Amotape-Chaucha terrane, which partially subducted beneath a preexisting Mesozoic continental arc system. The Triassic mafic and granitoid rocks of the El Oro metamorphic complex and the component eclogite, blueschist and amphibolite are known as the Raspas metamorphic complex. This section of the terrane was previously subducted but brought to the surface with tectonic activity. The breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana is recorded in the Triassic in Ecuador with S-type granite plutons, followed by the intrusion of calc-alkaline batholiths in the Jurassic. Oceanic basalts formed in the Jurassic and Cretaceous were accreted to the edge of the continent as a separate terrane around 130 million years ago, forming a belt of basalt and diabase, together with tuff, metasedimentary and sedimentary rocks running north‚Äìsouth into Ecuador. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)= Following the accretion of new terranes to the Western Cordillera, the Cenozoic brought the extensive uplift of the Andean orogeny. Volcanic rocks vary geochemically between the Western Cordillera and Eastern Cordillera. In the east, they are predominantly rhyolite, andesite and andesitedacite while in the west, they are characteristically andesite and plagidacite. These are inferred to be the result of hydrous partial melting of Basic Igneous Complex garnet amphibolite and amphibolite. =Natural resource geology in Cenozoic rocks= Most mineable deposits in Ecuador are either epithermal gold or porphyry copper hosted in Paleogene rocks, formed from the Eocene to the Miocene. They may have originated from an enriched mid-ocean ridge (MORB) basalt. Compared to other neighboring countries, copper deposits are comparatively small. Explanations have included a lack of development of magma chambers around nine million years ago due to the extent of compression in the Ecuadorian section of the Andes, or perhaps of a lack of exposure of deposits near the surface.

There are a number of cove hardwood stands older than 80 years and as large as 80 acres. Topography With elevations ranging from 2200 feet in the lower drainages to 3600 feet on the ridge crest, Beaverdam Creek wild area is dominated by a mountain ridge with steep sideslopes. A diversity of geologic features is characteristic of the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Geologic rock types are the Erwin Formation with white, vitreous quartzite, interbeds of dark-green, silty and sandy shale, minor siltstones and very fine sandstone; the Hampton Formation with dark greenish-gray, silty and sandy shale, micaceous shale, numerous layers of medium-grained, feldspathic, and thinly bedded sandstone; the Union Formation, a sequence of grey feldspathic sandstone, arkose, conglomerate, greywacke, siltstone and shale, and greenish amygdaloidal basalt flow; and Shady Dolomite, a light gray, well-bedded dolomite with thin to medium-bedded gray limestone, and yellowish brown residual clays with ‚Äújasperoid‚Äù diagnostic. The area, divided by Holston Mountain, has a northern part with headwater streams that flow north to the South Fork Holston River, and a southern part with streams flowing south into Beaverdam Creek, a tributary of the South Fork Holston River. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Beaverdam Creek was inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore protected from possible road construction and timber sales. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. In Virginia, the area near the Appalachian Trail is designated ‚ÄúAppalachian Trail Corridor‚Äù; an area to the west side is ‚ÄúBackcountry-Non- Motorized‚Äù, a ‚Äúsemi-primitive 2‚Äù area. The area in Tennessee is divided into three parts: ‚ÄúRemote Backcountry-Non-motorized‚Äù, ‚ÄúBlack Bear Habitat Management‚Äù and ‚ÄúAppalachian Trail Corridor‚Äù. Cultural history A partial survey of the area found seven cultural resource sites classified as Class II sites. They will require further evaluation to determine their eligibility for their registry in the National Register of Historic Places. In addition, three Class III sites were found, but as Class III sites they are not eligible for inclusion in the registry.

Biography  Sabri was of Albanian descent and born into an Albanian-Turkish family in Ohri (modern Ohrid), Ottoman Empire in 1876. Ismail Enver Bey recruited Sabri into the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) movement. Foreigners such as Ernst J√§ckh who came into contact with Young Turk (CUP) leaders such as Sabri described him as being an Albanian. He was a prominent military leader of the CUP. Adjuntant Major Sabri possessed strong authority among fellow Muslims in the area where he resided and could communicate with them as he spoke both Albanian (his mother tongue) and Turkish. Meyteb), a school built by Ey√ºp Sabri and now used as the St. Kliment Ohrid gymnasium In Ohri an armed band called the Special Muslim Organisation (SMO) composed of 40 members, mostly notables was created in 1907 to protect local Muslims and fight Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) bands. Sabri along with Enver bey recruited the organisation and turned it into the Ohri branch of the CUP with its band becoming the local CUP band. On July 3, 1908 Ahmet Niyazi bey protesting the rule of Abdul Hamid II fled with his band from Resne (modern Resen) into the mountains where he initiated the Young Turk Revolution and issued a proclamation that called for the restoration of the constitution of 1876. Following that example other officers like Ey√ºp Sabri in Ohri and Enver Bey in Tikve≈ü also went into the mountains and formed guerilla bands (√ßetes). During the revolution Subgovernor S√ºlayman K√¢ni and Sabri organised the SMO group into the CUP Ohri National Regiment. Under Sabri's command the band went into the mountains. From the outset in July Sabri worked closely with Niyazi. Tatar Osman Pasha, an Ottoman official was kidnapped after the Resne band of Niyazi, the Ohri band of Sabri and two Albanian bands conducted an attack on Monastir (modern Bitola). Toward the end of the revolution CUP Internal headquarters gave orders to the CUP Monastir branch that if the situation persisted a march on Istanbul would commence on 26 July and they in turn told Sabri that his regiment along with Second Lieutenant Mazhar Efendi to leave for the mountains. Facing a deteriorating situation in the Balkans on July 24 sultan Abdul Hamid II restored the constitution. After the revolution Sabri, along with Niyazi and Enver got popular acclaim as H√ºrriyet Kahramanlarƒ± (Heroes of Freedom). During the late Ottoman period, Sabri, the town bazaar and donations from the CUP in Istanbul financed the construction of a large school (Mejtebot) in Ohri. The Balkan Wars interrupted its construction and the completed building serves as a gymnasium in modern Ohrid. Ey√ºp Sabri (1920s) Sabri was a delegate representing Ohri at the Congress of Dibra (1909) organised by the CUP regarding Albanian ethno-linguistic rights and he refused to sign any resolutions due to disagreements with other delegates over its contents. The Ottoman Ministry of Interior in March 1911 sent telegrams to its officials in the Albanian provinces that removed some restrictions on the Albanian alphabet and schools and the CUP tasked Sabri and Haxhi Adil bey as emissaries to keep the populations of Ohri, Starova, Kor√ßa and Dibra regions calm. In June 1911 Mehmed V on a stopover in Monastir during his Balkans tour had a scene from the revolution reenacted by Niyazi and Sabri. Both men wore their old clothes, rode horses accompanied by a gun carriage with the event recorded on camera by the Manakis brothers and the film titled Sultan Re≈°ad's Visit to Bitola currently preserved in the Macedonian Archives. Ey√ºp Sabri's grave in ≈ûi≈üli Throughout the Young Turk era, Sabri was a seminal member of the CUP central committee from 1908 to 1918 with his position being renewed by the committee in 1917. He was a fedayi (a militant fighting for the cause). Sabri was a member of the Ottoman Te≈ükil√¢t-ƒ± Mahsusa (Special Organisation), a group involved in guerilla warfare. As such the Imperial War Ministry during World War One sent him to the Balkans where he agitated among Albanians with acts of subversion committed in Macedonia and Albania. Those activities later resulted in his imprisonment at Malta by the French, one of the Allied Powers. By 1921 Sabri was a supporter of Enver and belonged to the group Halk Z√ºmresi. Sabri was involved in the Turkish War of Independence and was a supporter of the Nationalist Movement yet he was marginalised by followers of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk. After the establishment of the republic Sabri was awarded an annual salary for services to the state and served in five Turkish parliaments as an CHP MP for Eski≈üehir (1), √áorum (5, 6, 7) and Erzurum (8) within the National Assembly.
