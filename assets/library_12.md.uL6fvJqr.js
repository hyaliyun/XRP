Since 1866 it has been part of the British Museum's collection, when it was given to the museum by the philanthropist Felix Slade.British Museum Collection A replica of the Mainz Gladius can be found in the Romano-Germanic Central Museum (Mainz). The type of gladius was first introduced to the Romans in 20 BC. Eventually the Mainz Gladius was overtaken in popularity by the Pompeii Gladius. Description The sword is made of iron (now heavily corroded) and the sheath of tinned and gilded bronze. The blade was 50-55 centimetres long and 7 centimetres in width. The sword was 65 to 70 centimetres long. The sword weighed 800 grams. The point of the sword was more triangular than the Gladius Hispaniensis. The Mainz Gladius still had wasp-waisted curves. The decoration on the scabbard illustrates the ceding of military victory to Augustus by Tiberius after a successful Alpine campaign. Augustus is semi-nude, and sits in the pose of Jupiter, flanked by the Roman gods of Victory and Mars Ultor ('the Avenger'), while Tiberius, in military dress, presents Augustus with a statuette of Victory. Ownership of the sword This prestigious weapon was likely to have been commissioned by a senior officer in the Roman army to celebrate a victory in the lengthy and bloody military campaigns in Germany. Victory in these campaigns was essential for the expansion and protection of the Roman Empire's border, and the symbolic act of presenting these victories to the emperor avoided the destructive rivalry between generals which had previously brought down the Roman Republic.

North Lawndale is a community that has struggled for decades with poverty. Schools suffered, along with the rest of the community, through white flight, the riots of the 1960s and the departure of businesses like Sears, Roebuck and Co. The community's population dropped from almost 95,000 in 1970 to just shy of 36,000 in 2010 with foreclosures brought on by the Great Recession accelerating the pace of decline in recent years. Today, the community is 92 percent African-American, with high rates of poverty still a constant. North Lawndale College Prep (NLCP) opened in 1998 to meet the pressing community need of developing an academically rigorous neighborhood school with a strong element of social support. In the long-troubled North Lawndale community, Chicago Public Schools has turned to private operators to solve the problem of failing schools more than anywhere else in the city. The Steans Family Foundation, which has funded many education efforts in the community at privately run and district-run schools, was involved in the startup of North Lawndale College Prep. Robin Steans, a trustee with the foundation and executive director of Advance Illinois, said North Lawndale has \\"been a challenged community for a long time\\" and there are no quick solutions for local schools. NLCP has two campuses - the Christiana Campus (original) and the Collins Campus opened in 2007. The school serves primarily African American students from low income areas. Many of the students arrive 2-4 grade levels behind. The mission of North Lawndale College Preparatory Charter High School (NLCP) is to prepare young people from under-resourced communities for graduation from high school with the academic skills and personal resilience necessary for successful completion of college. Both school campuses offer the same curriculum and extra-curricular activities. The school is made up of 78 staff with 55% holding master's degrees and a 14:1 student/teacher ratio. Although students at its two campuses still score below the district average on state standards according to school administrators, 100% of high school seniors have been accepted to college with 70% attending 4 year schools and 30% attending two year schools. NLCP roster spots are available to all students residing in Chicago and admissions decisions are made on a non- selective basis as part of a random lottery conducted by an objective 3rd party. In Winter, 2013, the school was featured in the Illinois Network of Charter Schools Policy Brief Measuring What Matters: Building Effective College Pipelines. The report examined the long-held belief that an ACT score of 21 was required for college success. NLCP believes that while test scores are meaningful, they only tell part of the story. 95% of NLCP students live in poverty with an average ACT score of 15.7, but they have a college acceptance rate of 100%, a college enrollment rate of 82% and a college persistence rate of 83%. NLCP administrators believe that measures of academic gains while in high school are better predictors of academic success in college than ACT scores. Perseverance, grit, and other non-cognitive schools appear to be equally important to college success. Mentorship, tracking and supporting students are also important. NLCP assigns a counselor to each freshman upon entering high school. That counselor not only stays with the assigned freshman for all four years of high school, but also follows them through their first year of college. This strategy is designed to help students - many of whom are the first member of their family to ever go to college - transition into the college environment. North Lawndale Prep frequently communicates its motto of \\"The Phoenix Way: Be Peaceful, Responsible, Respectful, and Prepared\\" to its students and provides opportunities for them to engage in college level work during their senior year. One example of this is a senior project that students continually revise and develop in their last year of school. This requires college level critical thinking, reading, writing, research, and public speaking. Also, through its Phoenix Rising program, NLCP provides continued enrichment for students during the summer. The program is held at colleges across the country and students experience first hand how to deal with challenges while away from home. 60% of juniors and seniors take at least one Advanced Placement course. Courses offered include: AP Literature and Composition, AP Language and Composition, AP US Government, and AP Government and Politics. Honors classes offered include Honors Algebra 1, Honors Geometry, Honors Advanced Algebra II and Trigonometry, Honors Pre-Calculus, Honors American Literatures, Honors World Literatures, Honors Biology.  In the News  In 2008, students at the school produced a short film on gun violence, Will I Be Next?\\". The film was shown at the first Peace on Earth Film Festival. In 2013, a student from the school was featured in the Al Jazeera America documentary series Edge of Eighteen. He appears in episodes 2 and 3: Episode 2: Maurice Massonburg lives on the west side of Chicago, which is often called “Chi-raq” due to the wave of gun violence sweeping across the city. Despite the distractions and bad influences in his neighborhood, Maurice attends a charter school (NLCP) committed to helping underprivileged students go to college. This doesn't reduce the mounting pressure he feels to become the first in his family to graduate from high school and attend college. Episode 3: Once a promising student Maurice Massonburg has all but abandoned his college dreams, resigning himself to the hard knocks of life on the west side of Chicago. Despite impassioned pleas from both his guidance counselor and mother, Maurice remains fixed to his downward spiral of smoking weed and slacking off at school. As graduation approaches, what will he decide to do?

With its ten-year head-start on Boyne Mountain, Caberfae became Michigan's largest winter sports area by the mid 1950s. Regularly scheduled \\"snow trains\\" brought thousands of skiers to the area, with daily crowds sometimes exceeding 4000. A snowmaking system was installed in 1957. The resort continued to expand throughout the 1960s, adding trails and lifts to bring the count up to 35 trails serviced by 20 lifts. However, poor snow during the 1965 and 1966 holiday periods caused financial difficulties for the operation and the resort was sold to a private company in 1967. Prior to this it had been managed as a non-profit. The resort struggled financially throughout the 70s. New owners in 1980 began expanding the resort, bringing in fill dirt to raise the summit of the North Peak and opening the South Peak. The South Peak opened in 1983 and the North Peak expansion was completed in 1992, increasing the vertical drop to 485'. Meanwhile, many of the trails cleared in the 50s and 60s were abandoned and most of the rope tows removed.Caberfae Peaks History by Jim Neff Michigan Skier http://www.michiganskier.com/caberfaehistory.html For the 2013-2014 season, Caberfae opened 25 acres of gladed terrain off the North Peak.Caberfae Peaks Adds Backcountry Terrain http://miskireport.com/blogs/industry- insider/caberfae-peaks-adds-backcountry-terrain  Winter activities  The area offers cross-country skiing and alpine skiing.

Early life Francis Russell Baker was born in St. James, Manitoba (now part of Winnipeg) on January 31, 1910. The boy attended Isaac Brock Elementary School and finished his public education at age 14. He then took up shorthand, typing, penmanship, English, spelling and bookkeeping at Success Commercial College in 1924/5. He worked in the offices of Western Canada Airways. In 1928 he began flight training with that company at Kirkfield Park. He obtained his commercial pilot licence on October 29, 1929. However, from 1931 to 1933 he worked for his father's company, Western Gypsum Products. Airlines The first commercial Beaver floatplane was acquired by Central British Columbia Airlines, precursor to Pacific Western Airlines Baker got his start as an entrepreneur in aviation by restoring a De Havilland Fox Moth for Ginger Coote at Gun Lake (British Columbia) in the winter of 1936/7. Later Baker made Fort St. James his base as he freighted supplies to mining operators in the North. He worked for Grant McConachie's company United Air Transport. Later Punch Dickins offered him a job with Canadian Airways in the same region. In January 1942 Russ Baker rescued the crews of three B-26 bombers that had made an emergency landing between Fort Nelson, British Columbia and Watson Lake, Yukon where there was a refueling station. The mishap occurred the 16th of January, and Russ eventually located the planes and crews. To an improvised runway he flew a dozen missions over several days to extract 24 crewmen and two officers. The Norden bombsights were recovered from the downed aircraft. He was recommended by Lt. Robert O. Cork for the Air Medal which Russ was awarded March 22, 1948, in Vancouver by the U.S. consul George D. Andrews. In February 1947 Pierre Berton was assigned the northern beat by Hal Straight of the Vancouver Sun. Russ took Pierre across the Rocky Mountains and up the \\"headless valley\\" of the Nahanni River. The newspaper series was named Best Adventure Series of 1947 by International News Service. Pierre wrote the Foreword to Wings over the West (1984) by John Condit. Berton described Russ' mountain flying: :Baker flew his Fox Moths and ancient Junkers through the angry ocean of peaks that sprawl across the midriff of British Columbia. He knew these mountains as well as we know our own street corners. When the fog hung heavy on the cordillera, he found his way home by recognizing the granite tips of the mountains that poked above the cloud blanket. The dreadful downdrafts that have caused more than one pilot's death held no terror for him. These Niagaras of air, pouring off the ridges, can send a plane plummeting a thousand feet in a minute, but Baker wrestled his aircraft through the turbulence like a horseman on a bronco. He had the physique of a boxer and the strength of an ox and needed both in that tempest- tossed land. Russ Baker died of a heart attack on November 15, 1958.

Like all members of the genus Uroplatus, U. sameiti is endemic to Madagascar, and is found in primary and secondary forests on the island. It has the ability to change its skin colour to match its surroundings and possesses dermal flaps which break up its outline when at rest. It is a CITES II protected animal due to habitat loss and over-collection for the pet trade. Taxonomy and etymology The generic name, Uroplatus, is a Latinisation of two Greek words: (', meaning \\"tail\\") and (', meaning \\"flat\\"). The specific name is a Latinisation of the name Joachim Sameit. The genus Uroplatus contains 14 species endemic to Madagascar. U. sameiti was originally described as a subspecies of U. sikorae, to which it is closely related, based on the light colouration of its oral mucosa. Subsequent analysis has shown that this is not a diagnostic feature for distinguishing between these two highly similar species however, and more research will be needed to produce reliable morphological characters with which these two species may be distinguished. Phylogenically, U. sameiti has been placed within a monophyletic complex consisting of three other species of Uroplatus: U. fimbriatus, U. giganteus, U. henkeli, and U. sikorae. This complex represents the larger species of the genus. Description U. sameiti are nocturnal and arboreal geckos. Their eyes are large, lidless, and have yellow sclera with elliptical pupils, suited for the gecko's nocturnal habits. This species ranges in size from when measured from nose to base of the tail. They spend most of the daylight hours hanging vertically on tree trunks, head down, resting. During the night, they will venture from their daylight resting spots, and go off in search of prey. As with all Uroplatus geckos, the tail is dorso-ventrally flattened. U. sameiti has colouration developed as camouflage, most being grayish brown to black or greenish brown with various markings meant to resemble tree bark; down to the lichens and moss found on the bark. U. sameiti has flaps of skin, running the length of its body, head and limbs, known as the dermal flap, which it can lay against the tree during the day, scattering shadows, and making its outline practically invisible. Additionally, the gecko has a limited ability to alter its skin colour to match its surroundings. Diet U. sameiti are insectivores eating insects, other arthropods, and also land snails. Distribution and habitat Uroplatus sameiti is found exclusively in the lowland humid and littoral forest of eastern Madagascar. Captivity It is unknown how many of these geckos are present in the pet trade, due to their overall similarity with U. sikorae, and the new confusion that has arisen in light of the non-diagnostic nature of their oral mucosa. However, like U. sikorae, this species is typically kept in breeding pairs or trios. They eat a variety of appropriately sized insects including crickets and moths, and will also eat snails if provided. If breeding is successful in captivity, eggs will be laid every 30 days and take 90 days to hatch. Threats Habitat destruction and deforestation in Madagascar is the primary threat to this animal's future as well as collection for the pet trade. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) lists all of the Uroplatus species on their \\"Top ten most wanted species list\\" of animals threatened by illegal wildlife trade, because of it \\"being captured and sold at alarming rates for the international pet trade\\". It is a CITES Appendix 2 protected animal.

It is strongly associated with its rich history in stone, as well as its traditional New Year's songs/chants (the charoles) and history as the centre of the accordion musicians in Portugal. History A human presence in the parish remotes to the transition between the middle and late Paleolithic epoch (some 30000 years ago).Sérgio Martins (Apontamentos sobre a História de Bordeira), p.1 But, the first references to the community of Bordeira occurred between 1567 and 1568: in 1567, Vasco Martins, an inhabitant from Bordeira bought a bull to help cultivate his land, from João Nobre (an inhabitant from Corotelo); and, in 1568, João Vasques Formoso, another dweller in the region moved his stakes to Gorjões.Sérgio Martins (Apontamentos sobre a História de Bordeira), p.2 In the 17th and 18th century, there were other names referred to as Bordeira in the territory: Parreiras de Bordeira and Poço de Bordeira, and later Barranco de Bordeira and Bordeira de Além in the 19th century. In 1742, a contract between the Third Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and master mason Diogo Tavares was signed. In it, Tavares would supply limestone from Borderira for paving stone in the Church of Carmo in Faro. This documented the long and intimate relationship between the territory of Bordeira and the civil parish of Santa Bárbara de Nexe, known for the extraction and transformation of stone, used for architectural projects in the parish. By 1839, Borderira and Goldra were the two communities in the parish with the most number of homes: 74 dwellings in both (with 70 in Gorjões and Santa Bárbara de Nexe, each). In the 20th century, the charolas were a force binding the community and social identity of Santa Bárabara das Nexes, especially in Bordeira.Sérgio Martins (Charolas: Freguesia de Santa Bárbara de Nexe), p.1 Around 1918, the charola Mocidade União (Youth Union), was founded to provide an organized forum for the traditional New Year's event, and allowed them to express and affirm the local collective identity.Sérgio Martins (Charolas: Freguesia de Santa Bárbara de Nexe), p.2 This included festivals, improvisations, the liveliness of the music, the evocation of tradition, friendship, unity and fraternity. This was followed in 1919 by the creation of the União Bordeirense. In 1921, the Cooperativa de Consumo A Bordeirense (Bordeirense Consumeer Cooperative) was created to produce and promote local products (one of the oldest of this type in Portugal). The Sociedade do Carro Funerário (Funerary Car Society) was established in 1923, to transport the dead to the cemetery of Santa Bárbara de Nexe (eventually closing in 1960). The 20th century was a period of growth and development, with many institutions and organizations developing at the time. In 1926 the Sindicato dos Cortadores e Limpadores de Árvores de Bordeira (Tree Cutters and Cleaners Sindicate) was created just before the sequence of events that would result in the imposition of the military coupe, while the Cooperativa do Lagar de Azeite (Olive Oil Cooperative), which functioned until the 1970s, was founded in 1940. On 28 March 1936 the Sociedade Recreativa Bordeirense (Bordeirense Recreative Society) was created to promote the local culture and active life, while the At the time of its second census (1940), Bordeira was one of the more populous sites in the civil parish, with 875 inhabitants (comprising 17% of the parishes population), followed by Gorjões (701 residents) and Goldra (570 residents). The primary school in the place was installed in 1953, inaugurated in May, on lands offered by José de Sousa Gago, then the first school in the parish. To complement these local activities, a Health Centre was installed in 1988. Culture José Ferreiro Sr. José Ferreiro Júnior (1943) It is sometimes recognized as the capital of the accordion for the many composers and musicians who created music for this instrument. Among the maestros, José Ferreiro (author of Alma Algarvia), and João Barra Bexiga, in addition to many musicians born in or around Bordeira (including João Bexiga, Daniel Rato, Jorge Ferreira, nephew of José Ferreiro, António Madeirinha, who lived in an area called Alface. For some time other musicians lived in the area, attracted by the influences of this community, including Eugénia Lima, influenced by José Ferreiro and son.

It appeared on their second album, entitled Roadrunner. It was originally supposed to be just a filler, as the number of tracks recorded at that stage was deemed insufficient to fill a complete album. According to Remu Aaltonen, both the music and the words were the result of improvisation, when producer Richard Stanley wanted the band to come up with one more song. However, according to Richard Stanley, the band had been playing the song live already during the previous summer, months before the recording sessions in Stockholm. There exist recordings made by people in the audiences during the summer of 1974, and the song appears on these recordings.Hurriganes keräilysivu/Hurriganes collectibles – Keikkanauhat (‘Gig recordings’). The words of this song consist of some kind of “Rock Esperanto”. There are words and phrases from the English language, but also non-sense words, and the syntax of proper English is not used systematically. Also, it is not possible to assign a sensible meaning to the lyrics. This situation arose from the deficient knowledge of English by the singer, Remu Aaltonen. The words were supposed to be replaced later by proper English, and Remu’s words were only meant for a demo recording. However, the other members of the band, as well as the producer, thought that the delivery was strong, and decided to stick to those words, despite opposition from Remu Aaltonen. The unique words are part of the charm of the song. The guitar intro is a version of the intro of Chuck Berry’s “Johnny B. Goode”, as Remu instructed Albert Järvinen to kick the song off with this riff. The rhythm guitar the vocal harmonies of the middle eight were overdubbed, otherwise the song was recorded in one take. “Get On” is one of the best known songs by Hurriganes. It is usually heard on every gig that the band plays. It is often among the top songs when Finnish rock songs are discussed in the media, and it was voted the best Hurriganes song in the vote “The Greatest Bands” of the Finnish radio station Radio Rock.

It is based on the 2003 novel of the same name by Michael Morpurgo. The film marks the penultimate performance of Richard Griffiths. Plot The tale is of a young man named Thomas \\"Tommo\\" Peaceful, who tells the story in account format from the past to the present day events of his experiences. His eldest brother, \\"Big Joe\\", has learning difficulties due to brain damage at birth, and is always looked out for by his younger brothers. The earlier part of the story tells of his life as a boy, before the Great War; the tale of his love for Molly – a beautiful girl he had a lot of feelings for, whom he met on his first day at school and grew to love besottedly; and Charlie Peaceful, Tommo's brother who is older than him, but younger than Joe. Also early on in the story Tommo and his dad go woodcutting where a tree nearly falls on Tommo. However, Tommo’s dad saves him but sadly in the process gets killed by the tree. Tommo kept it a secret that he was the reason his father is dead. The trio had grown up together; their mischievous adventures included braving the beastly \\"Grandma Wolf\\" (the boys' great-aunt – also referred to as the Wolfwoman), defying the Colonel and skinny-dipping, the latter leaving a large impression on Tommo. They had also seen an airplane together – the first people in their village to do so. Charlie, Molly and later Tommo all find jobs on the estate or in the village. Charlie, being older than Tommo, had always protected and looked out for his younger brother. Also, he and Molly become closer as they are both older than Tommo, while Tommo begins to be left out. Tommo suspects that Charlie and Molly are in love as he is being told to send letters between them. While they were skinny- dipping, Tommo notices them having a lot more fun together without him. Charlie and Molly used to secretly meet by the brook where it is revealed they kissed and had sex multiple times together. Molly becomes pregnant. She is thrown out of her house, and moves in with the Peacefuls. Tommo became extremely heartbroken after the couple rushed to get married a short time later in the village church before Tommo and Charlie were forced to go to France to fight in World War I. All through this time, Tommo recorded his feelings in the novel. The rest of the story describes the brothers' experiences of the war: their Sergeant \\"Horrible\\" Hanley, the near-misses during the battle on the front line, and Charlie's continued protection of Tommo. During a charge of the German lines, Charlie disobeys a direct order from Sergeant Hanley and stays with Tommo while he is injured on no- man's-land. As a result, Charlie is accused of cowardice and given a court- martial. At dawn, Charlie is marched before the firing squad, where he is executed. The story ends with Tommo preparing for the Battle of the Somme. In 2006, 306 British and Commonwealth soldiers who (like Charlie) were executed for offenses including cowardice, desertion, insubordination, and sleeping at their posts were pardoned.[1] Cast *Jack O'Connell as Charlie Peaceful **Hero Fiennes-Tiffin as Young Charlie *George MacKay as Tommo Peaceful **Samuel Bottomley as Young Tommo *Alexandra Roach as Molly Monks **Izzy Meikle-Small as Young Molly *Richard Griffiths as The Colonel *Frances de la Tour as Grandma Wolf *John Lynch as Sergeant Hanley *Maxine Peake as Hazel Peaceful *Stephen Kennedy as James Peaceful *Anna Carteret as Colonel's Wife *Eline Powell as Anna Reception The film has a 64% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

He previously played in MLB for the Tampa Bay Rays, Los Angeles Angels, and New York Yankees. Early career Tampa Bay Rays in 2014 Yates was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 26th round of the 2005 Major League Baseball draft out of Kauai High School in Lihue, Hawaii. He did not sign and attended Yavapai College. He missed both the 2006 and 2007 seasons due to Tommy John surgery. Professional career =Tampa Bay Rays= After going undrafted in 2009, Yates signed with the Tampa Bay Rays. In 2012, Yates reached the Double-A level with the Montgomery Biscuits, where he had a 2.65 ERA and 94 strikeouts in 68 innings over 50 games. Yates was a Triple-A All-Star in 2013, putting up a 1.90 ERA in 51 games for the Durham Bulls. Yates was added to the Rays 40-man roster on November 20, 2013. Yates was called up to the majors for the first time on June 7, 2014 and made his debut that day. In 37 games, he posted an ERA of 3.75 in 36 innings, striking out 42. The following season he struggled, posting an ERA of 7.97 in innings for the Major League club as he shuttled back and forth between Tampa and Durham. The Rays designated Yates for assignment after the 2015 season. =New York Yankees= On November 25, 2015, the Rays traded Yates to the Cleveland Indians for cash considerations. Yates was subsequently designated for assignment on January 5, 2016. On January 8, 2016, the Indians traded Yates to the New York Yankees in exchange for cash considerations. Yates made the Yankees' Opening Day roster in 2016. Yates pitched in relief for the Yankees for most of the season, although he was optioned to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on June 28, and then recalled on August 17. In 41 games for the Yankees, he posted an ERA of 5.23 and 50 strikeouts in innings. =Los Angeles Angels= After the 2016 season, the Los Angeles Angels claimed Yates from the Yankees on waivers. He was designated for assignment on April 2, 2017, after failing to secure a spot in the Angels bullpen during spring training, and he was outrighted from the 40-man roster and sent to the Triple-A Salt Lake Bees after clearing waivers on April 5. Yates made his Angels debut as a reliever on April 22 against the Toronto Blue Jays but was designated for assignment the next day. = San Diego Padres = On April 26, 2017, Yates was claimed off waivers by the San Diego Padres. He excelled relieving for the Padres, striking out 87 in innings and going 4-5 with a 3.72 ERA in 61 games. Yates credited his success to the development of a split-finger fastball in the spring which he began throwing more often with the Padres. In 2018, Yates began the season as the setup man to closer Brad Hand. He briefly went to the disabled list in early April with an ankle injury, but returned after two weeks. At the trade deadline, the Padres traded Hand, thus handing over the closer role to Yates. He ended the season with a career low 2.14 ERA in 65 appearances. He was 12 for 13 in save opportunities and struck out 90 in 63 innings. In 2019, Yates was selected as the Padres' sole representative at the All-Star Game. For the season, he led all major league pitchers in saves, with 41. He also recorded a 1.19 ERA and struck out 101 batters in innings. International career At the conclusion of the 2018 season, Yates was selected to represent Major League Baseball at the 2018 MLB Japan All-Star Series Personal life His brother, Tyler Yates, also played in Major League Baseball.

Samuel and Django had both been involved in previous bands in London and Los Angeles, including Blondelle and Django James and the Midnight Squires, respectively. The band built a considerable following on YouTube posting covers and acoustic performances. The band self released the Nightmare and the Cat EP and soon garnered the attraction of major management companies and labels, signing with In De Goot Entertainment in 2011 who found them a home at Capitol Records in 2013. Their debut release Simple EP, produced by Eric Valentine was released on Capitol Records on September 17, 2013. The band collaborates with artist Gary Baseman in their artwork and some live performances. They are looking forward to the release of their first LP, also titled Simple, in July 2014. On May 15, 2014 Nightmare and the Cat performed \\"Undercover\\" on The Late Show with David Letterman. On October 28, 2015 Django took to Facebook to announce that Nightmare and the Cat \\"is no more\\".

In PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen via various combinations of random selection and wealth or age (i.e., the stake). In contrast, the algorithm of proof-of-work-based cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin uses mining; that is, the solving of computationally intensive puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks. Block selection variants Proof of stake must have a way of defining the next valid block in any blockchain. Selection by account balance would result in (undesirable) centralization, as the single richest member would have a permanent advantage. Instead, several different methods of selection have been devised. =Randomized block selection= Nxt and BlackCoin use randomization to predict the following generator by using a formula that looks for the lowest hash value in combination with the size of the stake. Since the stakes are public, each node can predict—with reasonable accuracy—which account will next win the right to forge a block. =Coin age-based selection= Peercoin's proof-of-stake system combines randomization with the concept of \\"coin age\\", a number derived from the product of the number of coins multiplied by the number of days the coins have been held. Coins that have been unspent for at least 30 days begin competing for the next block. Older and larger sets of coins have a greater probability of signing the next block. However, once a stake of coins has been used to sign a block, it must start over with zero \\"coin age\\" and thus wait at least 30 more days before signing another block. Also, the probability of finding the next block reaches a maximum after 90 days in order to prevent very old or very large collections of stakes from dominating the blockchain. This process secures the network and gradually produces new coins over time without consuming significant computational power. Advantages Incentives differ between the two systems of block generation. Under proof of work, miners may potentially own none of the currency they are mining and thus seek only to maximize their own profits. It is unclear whether this disparity lowers or raises security risks. Under proof of stake, however, those \\"guarding\\" the coins always own the coins, although several cryptocurrencies do allow or enforce the lending of staking power to other nodes. Criticism Some authors argue that proof of stake is not an ideal option for a distributed consensus protocol. One issue that can arise is the \\"nothing-at-stake\\" problem, wherein block generators have nothing to lose by voting for multiple blockchain histories, thereby preventing consensus from being achieved. Because unlike in proof-of-work systems, there is little cost to working on several chains. Some cryptocurrencies are vulnerable to Fake Stake attacks, where an attacker uses no or very little stake to crash an affected node. Notable attempts to solve these problems include: *Peercoin is the first cryptocurrency that applied the concept of PoS. In its early stages, it used centrally broadcast checkpoints signed under the developer's private key. No blockchain reorganization was allowed deeper than the last known checkpoints. Checkpoints are opt-in as of v0.6 and are not enforced now that the network has reached a suitable level of distribution. *Ethereum's suggested Slasher protocol allows users to \\"punish\\" the cheater who forges on top of more than one blockchain branch. This proposal assumes that one must double-sign to create a fork and that one can be punished for creating a fork while not having stake. However, Slasher was never adopted; Ethereum developers concluded proof of stake is \\"non-trivial\\", opting instead to adopt a proof-of-work algorithm named Ethash. * Nxt's protocol only allows reorganization of the last 720 blocks. However, this merely rescales the problem: a client may follow a fork of 721 blocks, regardless of whether it is the tallest blockchain, thereby preventing consensus.

In the United States and Canada the organization is called the Active 20-30 Club and has over 50 local chapters. In Hispanic America the group is called Activo 20-30 Internacional and has over 60 chapters. The Active 20-30 Club is also a member of a global group called the WOCO Foundation.  History  Active 20-30 International is the result of the fusion of two Clubs, Active International and 20-30 International. Both were created to give younger adults the opportunity to lead, as leadership positions in established service clubs at that time were dominated by older men. =Active International= Active International was founded in Aberdeen, Washington February 10, 1922, as The Active Club. A group of young men including Ernest Axland, Paul Arthand, Carl Morck, Carl Springer, Carl Teman, Edgar Jones and Pat McNamara were eager to give the young men a more active part in the affairs of the community. Thus, they formed together to establish a young men's club which they named \\"Active\\". Active was incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington on August 20, 1924. Before long, Active Clubs were formed in Elma, Hoquiam, Montesano and Olympia. In 1925 the first convention was held in Montesano, Washington, with Carl Morck of Aberdeen being elected as president. In the same year, the name of the organization was officially changed from Active Club to Active Club International. The National Offices of Active International have been located in Aberdeen, Tacoma, Raymond and Spokane, Washington; Portland, Oregon; and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. =20-30 International= 20-30 International was founded in Sacramento, CA in the fall of 1922. Paul W. Claiborne was just twenty years of age when he conceived the idea of forming a service club whose members would consist of young men. Together with Earl B. Casey, Alfred B. Franke, Charles G. McBride and Marshall A. Page, he went with his idea to Mitch Nathan, the president of the Sacramento Chamber of Commerce. Nathan approved of his plan and appointed a committee to foster the formation of a club whose activities would aid the growth and advancement of young men. This committee consisted of F.A.S. \\"Sandy\\" Foale, Chairman; Charles Hansen, Clinton Harbor, Joseph Quire and Mrs. Alva Archer. A meeting was held in the Chamber of Commerce building on Tuesday, December 12, 1922, with Judge Peter J. Shields as the speaker. It was decided to proceed with the organization work immediately. Upon the suggestion of Sandy Foale, the name 20-30 was adopted. An organizational meeting was held on December 19, 1922, and Paul Claiborne was unanimously elected as the first president. Sandy Foale was named chairman of the advisory board. After the Sacramento club had established itself, 20-30 began to expand to new areas. On March 10, 1924, the Stockton, CA club was chartered with the assistance of the Rotary Club in Stockton. G. Lewis Fox was elected president, and Dr. Hall was named Chairman of the Advisory Board. A meeting between Sacramento and Stockton was held on March 5, 1925, and they created the 20-30 Club Executive Council to help with expansion to other cities. In August 1925, the third Club, San Bernardino, California, becomes affiliated with the organization. During 1926, 20-30 Clubs were formed in San Francisco, Hayward, Tracy and Oakland. Delegates from the seven clubs met in San Francisco on August 21, 1926. This was the first convention of 20-30. A Constitution was adopted and the following officers were elected: Sumner Mering, President; Tom Louttit, Vice President; Ivan Shoemaker, Secretary/Treasurer. =Expansion of the Active & 20-30 Organizations= In June 1929, Active International became international in fact, as well as in name, with the chartering of the Vancouver International Club in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Active clubs soon spread through Washington, Oregon, California and Montana in the United States and the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta in Canada. Clubs were also located in Idaho, Hawaii and Washington D.C. From 20-30's inception in 1922 until December 1941, charters were granted to 260 clubs and a total membership of 4,675 was attained. During the war years, approximately 65 percent of the membership served in the armed forces. This compelled 68 clubs to disband and decreased the number of active clubs to 122 with active membership at 1,800. In many cases the clubs were kept on active status by one or two members who maintained the charter. The official start of international expansion started is up for debate. It was widely believed that with the chartering of the Juarez Club on February 16, 1944, so started the movement of 20-30 in Mexico and Latin America. However, new evidence points to the first real international presence beginning in 1933 when the El Paso, Texas, club was chartered and possibly the Juarez, Mexico Club as well. It was a result of the Juarez charter and that of other Mexican clubs that the name of the association was changed to 20-30 International at the 1946 Victory Convention. =Merger= Both 20-30 International and Active International where chartered members of the World Council of Young Men's Service Clubs. John Armenia, Joe Crowe and Arnie Scheldt of Active and Dr. James Vernetti, Henry Heyl and Ray Fletcher of 20-30 were among those who fostered the World Council movement up to its formal beginning in 1945. In 1959 President Norm Morrison of 20-30 and President Ken Helling of Active exchanged a letter and renewed the long- standing proposal that these two almost identical young men's service clubs should merge. Throughout 1959 and 1960 meetings were held between the two groups, culminating in the proposed Constitution, and resolution to be presented to the 1960 conventions of each organization. At the 20-30 International Convention held in Santa Cruz, CA in 1960, the delegates unanimously adopted the merger proposal and the Constitution. One month later, the delegates at the Active international Convention in Calgary, Alberta, also unanimously adopted the propositions. Therefore, on August 1, 1960, Active International and 20-30 International became Active 20-30 International. The first convention of Active 20-30 International was held in Tucson, AZ, July 10–14, 1961, where the Constitution and By-Laws were officially adopted. Jack Kummert was elected President; Federico G. Lugo as First Vice-President; James Robertson as Second Vice-President. Clint McClure and Owen Barnes, the last presidents of 20-30 and Active respectively, stayed as members of the International Directors Council as Immediate Past Presidents. Other members of the First Council of Directors of Active 20-30 International were: Ray Manges, Area 1; Norm Jensen, Area 2; Skeet Glidewell, Area 3; Forrest K. Stewart, Area 4; Roy Stype, Area 5; Emilio Pérez-Banuet, Area 6; Joaquin Bours, Associate Director of Area 6; Angel Moreno, Area 7 and Bob Baumgartner, Area 8. Its presence became so large, that the State of California and Governor Ronald Reagan declared February 20–26, 1967 \\"Active 20-30 Week\\" Active 20-30 International = Philosophy = The original Active International and 20-30 International clubs started as a result of younger members of other service organizations finding that most leadership positions in those organizations were held and reserved for, the older and more senior members. The idea of a time limit for membership was intended to help build leadership and responsibility. The club as a whole focuses on helping children, specifically those that have special needs or are disadvantaged. Local clubs apply that focus to their specific cities and towns. = Symbols and sayings= The symbols and sayings of the organization are typically adaptations of those of Active International and 20-30 International or a confluence of both. Emblem The Active 20-30 International emblem is a buzz saw encircling an hourglass and inscribed \\"Active 20-30 International.\\" The emblem selected for Active International was the buzz saw. The buzz saw is just about the most active object you can find anywhere. Even when motionless, as it is on the emblem, it has the appearance of intense activity. Since Aberdeen was a lumber center and sawmills with humming saw blades were in evidence everywhere, it was only logical that the founders of Active chose the buzz saw for their emblem. The buzz saw represents the usefulness of intense activity and the abundant energy of responsible youth, means power, strength, and progress. The emblem of 20-30 International was an hourglass, symbolizing the passage of time and the need of young man to take advantage of his time and energy for useful activities. Around this hourglass, there were four \\"S\\". The four \\"S\\" have a double significance since these were the initials of the first four 20-30 Clubs (Sacramento, Stockton, San Bernardino and San Francisco) and they also form the initials of the original slogan \\"Sincerity in Service, our Slogan for Success\\". Upon the merger, a new emblem was developed incorporating both. The 4 \\"S\\" were removed and the hourglass was placed within a 23 tooth buzzsaw. Mission statement The mission statement is \\"Providing young adults with an opportunity for personal growth, friendship and leadership development while improving the quality of life for the special needs children in our community.\\" Club motto The club's motto is \\"Youth, to be served, must serve\\" and variations on the club slogan include \\"One never stands so tall as when kneeling to help a child,\\" \\"A man never stands so tall as when he kneels to help a child,\\" \\"Man never stands so tall as when kneeling to help a child,\\" and \\"A person never stands so tall as when kneeling to help a child.\\" Colors The club's colors are red, blue, and gold. = Membership = Local clubs include women's chapters, men's chapters, and co-ed chapters. The age requirement to be a member is 20-39 to allow for youth leadership training. Honorary members can be of any age. Many Active 20-30 Clubs partner with other service clubs, such as Kiwanis, Rotary, Lions Club, and Soroptimist, and Active 20-30 Club members often join these groups later on in life.

He is remembered as the author of \\"Gerasim's Chronicle.\\"https://www.intermagazin.rs/istorija-koju- nismo-ucili-na-casovima-milos-obilic-je-bio-turski-zatocnik-ali-jeste-ubio- murata-na-kosovu/  Name  In documents he was referred with one or two out of four different names he had during his life: Nikola, Radonja (Radohna), Roman and Gerasim.  Early life  Radonja was a member of the Branković dynasty as the eldest son of Branko Mladenović. Radonja's younger brothers were Vuk Branković and Grgur Branković. He was married to Jelena, a sister of Uglješa Mrnjavčević. Radonja had a title of caesar () and controlled an estate in Serres region where he and his wife Jelena lived with their two daughters.  Monastic life  Agiou Pavlou monastery When his wife and daughters died at very young ages, Radonja resigned his feudal position and after Autumn 1364 took monastic vows and name Gerasim while his father Branko Mladenović was still alive. There he served and helped with great merit Hilendar and also the monasteries of Koutloumousiou and Agiou Pavlou monastery. Thanks to the Radonja's influence, Vuk Branković became the first of Serbian feudal lords who gained ktitor's privileges in Hilandar after the fall of the Serbian Empire, beginning in 1371. The earliest mention of Radonja under his monastic name Gerasim was in a charter of Vuk Branković issued to Hilandar Monastery in 1376/77. Around 1380 Radonja, together with Arsenije Bagaš, bought ruined Agiou Pavlou monastery from Xeropotamou Monastery and reconstructed it. In period 1379—89 Radonja was a priest in the Hilandar Monastery and was again mentioned as Gerasim, a brother of Vuk Branković, in the 1389 document written by Prince Lazar. There he achieved hieroschemamonk degree of Eastern Orthodox monasticism. Around 1392 Radonja and group of notable \\"elders\\" from Hilandar visited court of the Lazarević family, successors of Prince Lazar, and requested a church in Ibar and its estates to be granted to Hilandar, according to the promise given by its former lord, Obrad Dragoslavić. After the death of Vuk Branković in 1396, Radonja took Vuk's body to the Agiou Pavlou monastery on Mount Athos. Radonja died on 3 December 1399 probably in Agiou Pavlou monastery.  Gerasim's Chronicle  Nikola Radonja, as monk Gerasim, was one of the people who appeared in the Serbian 1389 historical drama/war film Battle of Kosovo, in interpretation of the actor Tanasije Uzunović. According to some speculations, Radonja was author of the Gerasim's Chronicle (), allegedly disappeared at the beginning of the 20th century, which supposedly explains that Miloš killed sultan Murad with a spear during the Battle of Kosovo in 1389.

The book was praised as a well-written work on science. However, some reviewers pointed out factual errors, and noted that LeVay failed to prove that homosexuality has a biological basis. Summary LeVay discusses \\"brain mechanisms that are responsible for sexual behavior and feelings\\"; topics considered include sexual orientation, the evolutionary basis of sex, sexual development, the organization and development of the brain, the neural mechanisms associated with sexual intercourse, gender differences, and gender identity. LeVay expresses skepticism about the work of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, writing that while he once accepted the Freudian view that \\"a young child's relations with his or her parents play a decisive role\\" in the development of sexual orientation, he rejected it after he came to know large numbers of gay men and lesbian women. LeVay writes that he doubts that there is anything scientific about Freud's ideas. He describes the functions of the hypothalamus, which plays a key role in, \\"sex, feeding, drinking, cardiovascular performance, control of body temperature, stress, emotional responses, growth, and many other functions\\". LeVay notes that his INAH 3 study was his only publication on sex to that date, and that most of his previous research had been on the visual areas of the cerebral cortex. LeVay compares homosexuality to the disease sickle cell anemia, arguing that it may have persisted through a similar genetic mechanism. Publication history The Sexual Brain was first published in 1993 by MIT Press. Reception The Sexual Brain has been praised by authors such as the anthropologist Melvin Konner, who described the book as a good introduction to the biology of gender and a useful guide for understanding the neuroscience of sexual arousal and associated behaviors. The book received positive reviews from the journalist Peter Gorner in the Chicago Tribune, the playwright Kenneth McLeish in The Independent, the psychiatrist Avodah K. Offit in the Los Angeles Times, Robert Friar in the Journal of Sex Research, and the psychologist Richard Gregory in The Times Literary Supplement. The book received mixed reviews from the biologist Anne Fausto-Sterling in BioScience, the physician Richard Horton in The New York Review of Books, Michael J. Baum in the Archives of Sexual Behavior, and from Publishers Weekly. The Sexual Brain received two reviews in New Statesman and Society, one from Peter Tallack and the other from David Fernbach. Other reviews included those by the physician Lawrence D. Mass in The Advocate, Katherine Livingston in Science, Marian Annett in the Times Higher Education Supplement, the critic Michael Warner in The Village Voice, the psychologist Leonore Tiefer in Psychology of Women Quarterly, and the historian of science Daniel Kevles in The New Yorker. Mass subsequently commented that his review strained his relations with some of his colleagues, and that The Advocate's editors \\"severely truncated\\" the review, turning it from a \\"skeptical critique\\" into \\"a blurblike endorsement ... used to advertise the book.\\" Gorner considered the book well-written, and credited LeVay with merging \\"evolutionary theory, endocrinology, molecular genetics and cognitive psychology into a synthesis that is brilliant and entertaining.\\" McLeish praised LeVay for his criticism of Freud, and for outlining the \\"current state of knowledge and research on the neurobiology of sexuality\\" in a \\"lucid, friendly and comprehensible\\" style. However, he also wrote that LeVay's arguments about homosexuality \\"become a touch obsessive.\\" Offit called the book \\"elegant\\" and described it as \\"engaging and professional--a work of stunning scientific scholarship enhanced by gracious style and modesty.\\" However, he noted that LeVay was not \\"able to prove the biological basis of homosexuality\\", and that LeVay's findings on INAH 3 could \\"set us back as a society\\" by suggesting that homosexuality is abnormal. Friar credited LeVay with \\"superb writing skills\\" and \\"comprehensive knowledge of neurobiology\\", and called his book \\"concise, thoughtful, informative\\" and \\"interesting\\". However, he criticized LeVay for giving insufficient attention to lesbianism, for the lack of illustrations in his book, and for using references sparingly. Gregory wrote that the book was \\"very carefully written, with clear logical threads\\" and \\"the statement of a first-rate scientist on issues of personal and social importance\\". Fausto- Sterling described The Sexual Brain as well-written and \\"potentially appropriate for classroom use.\\" However, she found that LeVay's accounts of reproductive physiology and the brain became weaker as he moved further away from neurobiology. She considered LeVay's account of \\"the embryonic development of gonads and genitalia\\" an example of this weakness, describing it as \\"extremely unsophisticated\\", and accusing LeVay of making inaccurate claims. She criticized LeVay's views on gender differences, including his belief \\"that female development is passive and preprogrammed ... and male development active\\", and for failing to cite critiques of that viewpoint. She gave LeVay credit for bringing \\"a wider range of evidence to bear in examining the interactions among hormones, the brain, and behavior\\" and citing less well-known work on this topic, and praised LeVay for \\"declaring his own gay identity\\", and called his treatment of the relevance of biology to homosexuality \\"appropriately cautious\\". Horton described the book as persuasive and credited LeVay, along with other researchers, with helping make a strong but not definitive case that biological influences play an important or even decisive role in \\"determining sexual preference among males\\", and with \\"taking a \\"broad philosophical perspective in his discussion of human sexuality by placing his research in the context of animal evolution.\\" He wrote that LeVay supported his contentious view that there are separate centers in the hypothalamus responsible for generating \\"male-typical and female-typical sexual behavior and feelings\\" with a wide range of sources, notably that concerning women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Though noting that LeVay acknowledged the limitations of his research, he criticized LeVay for having an unsubtle view of the meaning of \\"biologial influence\\" on sexual orientation that ignores the question of how genes produce an \\"unpredictable interplay of behavioral impulses\\", and engaging in \\"overstretched speculations\\" about \\"why a gene for homosexuality still exists when it apparently has little apparent survival value in evolutionary terms.\\" He concluded that while LeVay's work \\"presents technical and conceptual difficulties\\" and his \\"preliminary findings obviously need replication or refutation\\" it \\"represents a genuine epistemological break away from the past's rigid and withered conceptions of sexual preference.\\" Baum described The Sexual Brain as engaging and readable, and ideal for educated laypeople. However, he criticized LeVay for being unaware of some relevant research, and making a number of factual errors, such as that orgasm is caused by the neurotransmitter oxytocin, that female rats fail to display maternal behavior after hypophysectomy, that lesions of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus reduce presentational behavior displayed by female monkeys, that antiandrogenic drugs block the masculinization of the sexually dimorphic subdivision of the medial preoptic area in male rats, and that vaginal olfactory cues are the primary determinants of masculine sexual arousal in male primates. Publishers Weekly described the book as an \\"expert, drily written, often technical account of the biological basis of human sexual behavior and orientation\\" and predicted that it would be equally as controversial as LeVay's \\"1991 Science article describing a difference in the hypothalamic brain structure of homosexual and heterosexual men.\\" The Sexual Brain has been criticized by authors such as the queer theorist Robert McRuer, the philosopher Timothy F. Murphy, the biologist Steven Rose, the classicist Bruce Thornton, the psychiatrist and medical historian Vernon Rosario, and the philosopher Edward Stein. McRuer compared The Sexual Brain to the political scientist Charles Murray and the psychologist Richard Herrnstein's The Bell Curve (1994), arguing that just as Murray and Herrnstein presented inequality as inevitable rather than the consequence of economic institutions that could be changed, LeVay failed to question the institution of heterosexuality. Murphy maintained that LeVay failed to show conclusively that the differences in brain structure he found between gay men and straight men were not due to AIDS. Rose criticized the publicity that surrounded the publication of The Sexual Brain, arguing that LeVay over-stated the importance of his findings, behavior which Rose considered similar to that of researchers such as the geneticist Dean Hamer. Rose noted that the sexual orientation of the men in LeVay's hypothalamus study was presumed rather than demonstrated. Thornton questioned the value of LeVay's work, writing that while LeVay asserted that the future would bring progress in understanding the development of sexuality, it was uncertain what good such knowledge would accomplish. Rosario accused LeVay of biological determinism and reductionism. Stein criticized LeVay for failing to discuss social constructionism, despite its relevance to his topic. Kirkus Reviews wrote in 2010 that The Sexual Brain was \\"well received, but soon out of date\\" because of subsequent scientific research.

Mission MLA's mission states: \\"The Minnesota Library Association is an association of library supporters, representing all types of libraries by helping them accomplish together what none can do alone. MLA serves the interests of its members by facilitating educational opportunities, supporting strong ethical standards, providing legislative assistance, and fostering connections between the library community and various constituencies.\\" History Minnesota was one of the first states to establish a state library association, following New York, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Illinois, and New Jersey as Melvil Dewey encouraged state library associations \\"to carry on the rapidly developing modern library work.\\" The Minnesota Library Association organized and held the first meeting on December 29, 1891, initiated by William Watts Folwell. The first officers elected at the 1891 meeting included William Watts Folwell (president), Helen J. McCaine (vice president), and J.F. Williams (secretary). The first meeting was publicized in an announcement in the St. Paul Pioneer Press. The initial meeting was held at the Minnesota Historical Society in St. Paul, MN, and the purpose of the first meeting was to organize a state library association by using a plan recommended by the American Library Association. Early meetings usually consisted of presented papers and discussions, and the 1896 annual meeting was collaborative with the Minnesota Education Association. Gratia Countryman, secretary of MLA at the time, elaborated, \\"early in the history of the association, librarians recognized that schools and libraries should cooperate closely as the two arms of the educational system.\\" Amendments to the MLA constitution in 1898 allowed for membership to be extended to any individual interested in libraries, and it was determined that future annual meetings were to occur in October with locations determined by the executive committee. Also important during this time period, MLA passed two resolutions supporting legislation to establish a state library commission and create a system of traveling libraries. This bill was passed in 1899 and was considered a major accomplishment for MLA. The Minnesota Public Library Commission began in 1900, and Clara Baldwin served as the first librarian. Another resolution was passed in 1899 requesting that a library science course be added to the curriculum at the University of Minnesota. This was approved, and courses were soon offered. Various sections were created in the following years including Trustees, Traveling Library, Children’s Librarians, Public Library, Education, and College and Reference Librarians. The 1908 annual meeting occurred at the ALA Annual Conference that was held at Lake Minnetonka. Also during the early 1900s, MLA had joint meetings with other state associations including the Wisconsin Library Association in 1909 and the North Dakota Library Association in 1910. Membership originally was a one dollar fee with no annual dues. By 1898, annual dues were set at fifty cents. Membership dues continued to increase, but as of 1910, there were 125 members. Recruitment became a priority in 1921, only to be permanently tabled during the Depression when new graduates could not find jobs. During and between the two World Wars, MLA made important administrative decisions that impacted its own structure, its relationships with the State of Minnesota, and with the American Library Association. MLA adopted a new constitution that redrafted the slate of officers, changed the makeup of the executive committee, and introduced institutional memberships. By 1939, members approved another new constitution. Each successive constitution both reflected and defined MLA’s activities. By- laws were added that named standing committees, detailed duties of the officers, and created procedures to establish sections. The MLA continued to influence state legislation. It successfully recommended merging the Public Library Commission with the Minnesota Department of Education (1919), allowing small town school libraries to double as public libraries (1929), and requiring certification of school librarians (1935). In 1938-40 biennium, the Library Planning Division worked with the Library Division of the MDE to develop the first legislative platform. The American Library Association’s influence guided much of MLA’s plans and decisions. MLA followed ALA’s lead on such issues as children’s services, certification and standardization. MLA became a chapter of ALA in 1921, and a leader in working with other state associations. Social issues Since World War II, MLA has taken a stand on social issues by supporting a nuclear freeze (1983), exploring arbitration for non-union librarians (1976), and voicing support for independent booksellers (1987). In 1997 when heavy rains flooded many Minnesota libraries, MLA established a Disaster Relief Fund.

Taylor, is an American professional baseball center fielder who is currently a free agent. Taylor was drafted in the sixth round (172nd overall) of the 2009 MLB draft by the Washington Nationals. He made his Major League Baseball debut in 2014 with the Nationals. Early life and education Taylor was born to military parents; his father, Anthony Taylor, was a logistics officer for 22 years in the U.S. Army. Taylor has four older sisters. He was a high school teammate of Matt den Dekker, with whom he would play for the Washington Nationals in the 2015 and 2016 seasons, while attending Westminster Academy. Career =2009–13 seasons= Taylor was signed out of Westminster Academy as a shortstop in the 2009 Major League Baseball draft, after the Washington Nationals selected him with their sixth-round pick. He forwent a commitment to the University of North Florida to go professional with the Nationals. Taylor did not make his minor league debut in the 2009 season but served as a versatile infielder for the Gulf Coast League Nationals in 2010, committing 21 errors across three positions: shortstop, second baseman, and third baseman. He appeared in 38 games and batted .195 with one home run. his rookie season At the beginning of fall instructional league play in 2010, Taylor was told he would be switching positions from shortstop to center fielder, after a hand injury had limited his development in the infield in his first year in the Nationals' minor league system. Beginning at the Class A Hagerstown Suns in 2011, Taylor exclusively appeared as an outfielder, a trend that continued with the Class A-Advanced Potomac Nationals in 2012 and 2013. His offensive output improved as well, as he batted .263 with 10 home runs in 133 games with the Potomac Nationals in 2013, earning him honors as the team's Player of the Year, before heading to Puerto Rican winter baseball to play for the Indios de Mayaguez. Taylor was added to the Washington Nationals' 40-man roster on November 20, 2013, after the end of the 2013 season.Nats add three, including two arms, to 40-man roster At the time, he ranked as the Nationals' fourth- best prospect according to MLB Pipeline, and seventh-best according to Baseball America. =2014 season= On August 10, Taylor was called up by the Nationals when Steven Souza was placed on the 15-day disabled list.Michael A.

Taylor to Triple-A. He was again recalled after rosters expanded in September and was in center field on September 28, in the final game of the 2014 regular season, when Jordan Zimmermann completed the first no-hitter in Nationals history. Taylor was ranked third among Nationals prospects by the end of 2014 by MLB Pipeline and second by Baseball America. =2015 season= Taylor opened the 2015 season as the Nationals' starting center fielder while Denard Span was on the disabled list. Despite starting the season well by sporting a .279 batting average, he was optioned to the Class-AAA Syracuse Chiefs on April 19 to make room on the active roster for Span. He was recalled on April 29 when Reed Johnson was placed on the disabled list. During an away game against the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 13, Taylor substituted for right fielder Bryce Harper after Harper was ejected in the seventh inning. In his first at-bat in the ninth inning, he came up with the bases loaded for the first time in his career and hit a go-ahead grand slam, effectively clinching the game for the Nationals. On August 20, Taylor hit the second-longest home run of the 2015 MLB season, crushing a pitch from Colorado Rockies starter Yohan Flande 493 feet into the stands at Coors Field.Statcast  MLB.com Taylor suffered a right knee injury on August 27 after slamming into the wall while attempting to run down a line drive off the bat of Melvin Upton, Jr., but he was healthy enough to make a pinch-hitting appearance in the tenth inning against the Atlanta Braves on September 4. He hit a three-run home run for a walk-off victory over the visiting Braves. On September 8, Taylor hit a \\"Little League grand slam\\" off of New York Mets pitcher Matt Harvey after a bases-loaded single got by center fielder Yoenis Céspedes and went to the wall. He was not credited with an inside-the-park home run, with an error being charged to Céspedes on the play. Taylor himself allowed an inside-the- park grand slam on a similar play just weeks later, as he dove and missed a ball hit by Philadelphia Phillies rookie Aaron Altherr in a September 25 game, unloading the bases and allowing Altherr to score on his own hit. The play was scored a home run for Altherr. Taylor finished the 2015 season batting .229/.282/.358 with 14 home runs, 16 stolen bases, and a .640 on-base plus slugging percentage in 472 at bats over 138 games. =2016 season= Taylor opened the 2016 season as the Washington Nationals' fourth outfielder, but an Opening Day injury to starting center fielder Ben Revere quickly thrust him into an everyday spot in the lineup. On June 22, Taylor had what a writer for the New England Sports Network described as possibly \\"the worst game in baseball history.\\" He had five swinging strikeouts against the Los Angeles Dodgers and a fielding error that cost the Nationals the game when he failed to get his glove to the ground in time while charging a routine groundball hit by Yasiel Puig in the bottom of the ninth inning. The Nationals were up by one run, 2–3, and the error resulted in Taylor's future Nationals teammate Howie Kendrick, who was on first base for the Dodgers at the time, and Puig both scoring for a walk-off Los Angeles victory. Taylor was optioned to the Syracuse Chiefs to make room for the reactivation of closer Jonathan Papelbon on July 4, but he was recalled after appearing in just one game for the Chiefs after first baseman Ryan Zimmerman was placed on the disabled list on July 8. Taylor's return to the major leagues was short-lived, however, as he was optioned back to Syracuse after going 0-for-4 with two strikeouts in a loss against the San Diego Padres on July 24. Taylor rejoined the major league team after a little more than a month with the Chiefs, where he posted a meager .205 batting average over 31 games, being recalled August 29. He found himself once again relegated to a bench role, with rookie Trea Turner taking over in center field for the ineffectual Revere. He finished out the season batting .231./278/.376 with a .654 on-base plus slugging percentage, seven home runs, and 16 stolen bases in 221 at bats in 76 major league games, and he was among the players named to the Nationals' playoff roster in the 2016 National League Division Series, where he received two at-bats and struck out in both appearances. =2017 season= Coming off what he described as a \\"pretty disappointing\\" 2016 season, Taylor found himself in the familiar role of backup outfielder for the Nationals in the 2017 season, with Adam Eaton taking over in center field and Trea Turner shifting to the shortstop position. However, for the third straight season, Taylor found himself in the role of everyday center fielder after the presumptive starter was injured early in the year, with Eaton tearing ligaments in his knee while running the bases in late April. Given regular playing time, Taylor resurrected a batting average that had hovered below .200 in limited appearances prior to Eaton's season-ending injury, hitting .290 in May and June while demonstrating above-average power. Taylor landed on the major league disabled list for the first time in his career on July 7 with an oblique strain. He spent more than a month on the disabled list, with rookie Brian Goodwin taking over as the Nationals' regular center fielder in Taylor's absence. Upon Taylor's return to the team on August 13, after rehab assignments with the minor league Potomac Nationals and Harrisburg Senators, Taylor reclaimed his spot in the starting lineup. Two years to the day after his \\"Little League grand slam\\" against the New York Mets, on September 8, 2017, Taylor hit a bases-loaded line drive to center field off Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Jake Thompson that a leaping Odubel Herrera was unable to snare. Taylor circled the bases on the play, which was scored an inside-the-park grand slam — the first in Major League Baseball since Aaron Altherr's on September 25, 2015. In the same game, Taylor also singled twice and tripled, driving in a total of five runs, and recorded an outfield assist at home to preserve the Nationals' lead in the eventual 11–10 victory. Taylor finished the regular season batting .271/.320/.486 with 19 home runs, 53 RBIs, and 17 stolen bases in 399 at bats. In Game 4 of the 2017 NLDS against the Chicago Cubs, Taylor hit a grand slam to put the Nationals ahead 5-0 and stave off elimination. It was the first grand slam in Nationals post-season history. Taylor hit a go-ahead three-run homer on the second inning of Game 5 (which the Nationals ultimately lost 9-8). In 2018 Taylor struggled at the plate to start the season, batting .223 in April and .183 in May, but hit his stride in June, batting .444. He also led the major leagues in stolen bases as late as June 21. However, Taylor lost significant playing time due to the return of Adam Eaton and the strong performance of Juan Soto, relegating Taylor to fourth outfielder status.Michael A.

In the 2018-2019 offseason, Taylor worked with Nationals hitting coach Kevin Long to change his stance and swing to generate more contact, and practiced his new swing in the Dominican Winter League. Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo said in December 2018 that he believes Taylor could be a five-tool player if he can make more contact. =2019 season = In 2019 he batted .250/.305/.364 with one home run and three RBIs.

The team announced October 15, 2020, that he had cleared waivers and elected free agency rather than accept an assignment to the minor leagues.

Smethwick council chamber, where the result was announced Background After the Second World War, Smethwick attracted a significant number of immigrants from Commonwealth countries, the largest ethnic group being Sikhs from the Punjab in India. There was also a background of factory closures, and a growing waiting list for local council housing. Griffiths ran a campaign critical of both the opposition, and the government's, immigration policies. The Conservatives were widely reported as using the slogan \\"if you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Labour\\" but Colin Jordan, leader of the neo-Nazi British Movement, claimed that his members had produced the initial slogan as well as spread the poster and sticker campaign; Jordan's group in the past had also campaigned on other slogans, such as: \\"Don't vote – a vote for Tory, Labour or Liberal is a vote for more Blacks!\\". Griffiths denied that the slogan was racist, saying that: Election result The 1964 general election had involved a nationwide swing from the Conservatives to the Labour Party; which had resulted in the party gaining a narrow five seat majority. However, in Smethwick, the Conservative candidate, Griffiths gained the seat and unseated the sitting Labour MP, Patrick Gordon Walker, who had served as Shadow Foreign Secretary for the eighteen months prior to the election. Griffiths did, however, poll 436 votes less in 1964 than when he stood unsuccessfully for the Smethwick constituency in 1959: Figures nevertheless show that votes for Labour's Patrick Gordon Walker had been in decline from the 1950 general election onwards, culminating in this 1964 defeat by Peter Griffiths. See Smethwick (UK Parliament constituency) for details. Aftermath Following the election result, a British branch of the Ku Klux Klan was formed, and Black and ethnic minority residents in the area had burning crosses put through their letterboxes. Peter Griffiths was declared \\"a parliamentary leper\\" by Harold Wilson, the new Labour Prime Minister. Griffiths, in his maiden speech to the Commons, pointed out what he believed were the real problems his constituency faced, including factory closures and over 4,000 families awaiting council accommodation. Patrick Gordon Walker subsequently lost the 1965 Leyton by-election, in a usually safe Labour seat, and the election result meant that Malcolm X would visit Smethwick to show solidarity with the black and minority ethnic communities in the area (in particular, the black and Asian community). Nine days after he visited Marshall Street in Smethwick, Malcolm X was shot dead in New York. The Labour Party regained the seat at the 1966 general election when Andrew Faulds became the new Member of Parliament. Malcolm's visit to Smethwick was \\"no accident\\"; an official policy of racial segregation was attempted to be put into place in Smethwick's housing allocation, with houses on Marshall Street in Smethwick being let only to white British residents. In 1964, a delegation of white residents successfully petitioned the Conservative council to compulsorily buy vacant houses to prevent non-whites from buying the houses. This, however, was prevented by Labour housing minister Richard Crossman, who refused to allow the council to borrow the money in order to enact their policy. The actions taken have been described as \\"ugly Tory racism\\" which \\"killed rational debate about immigration\\". However, colour bars were then common, preventing non-whites from using facilities. The Labour club in Smethwick operated one, as did the local Sandwell Youth Club, which was run by one of the town's Labour councillors.

Nix is a certified nurse. =Freshman= Before his freshman season, he nearly attended Clearwater Central Catholic High School, as well as IMG Academy, but decided to attend his zoned school, East Lake High School in Tarpon Springs, Florida. As a freshman, he played varsity football for East Lake, but mostly on defense. He had 1 reception for a 26-yard touchdown, 2 interceptions and 81 tackles, including 2 forced fumbles. That season East Lake compiled a 9–4 record before losing in the 2011 Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA) Class 8A region final in overtime to Plant High School on December 2, 2011. Plant had won state championships in 2006, 2008 and 2009. Plant went on to become state champion that year, marking four consecutive years it had reached a championship game. Campbell accumulated statistics in 12 of the 13 games (not the November 4 game at Palm Harbor University High School). He was named a MaxPreps 2011 U.S. Air Force Freshman All-American first team selection at linebacker, although his true position was safety. He was not selected to the Tampa Bay Times 2011 All-Suncoast Region Football team for Hernando, Pasco, Hillsborough and Pinellas counties or even the Times 2011 All-Pinellas County football team. =Sophomore= In 2012, East Lake improved to 11–2, but again lost in the FHSAA Class 8A region final, this time to Dr. Phillips High School on November 30 by a 31–21 margin. In the first game of the season, when starter Artavis Scott injured his ankle, Campbell stepped in at wide receiver. Later in the season, when the team struggled to get pressure on the quarterback, Campbell moved from safety to defensive end. As a sophomore, his tackle total declined to 56, but his 764 receiving yards earned him 27 major Division I scholarship offers. His offers included Arkansas, Auburn, Boston College, Clemson, Florida, Florida State, Georgia, Georgia Tech, Illinois, Louisville, Miami (FL), Mississippi, Mississippi State, North Carolina State, Notre Dame, Ohio State, South Florida, Tennessee, Texas A&M;, UCF, UCLA, Vanderbilt, West Virginia. East Lake junior offensive lineman Mason Cole committed to Michigan's class of 2014 on February 25, which was one day before Cole was invited to participate in the 2014 U.S. Army All-American Bowl. That year Campbell played basketball and ran track for East Lake before having surgery on his left wrist on April 19. The following summer, he ran a 4.36 second 40-yard dash. His 4.36 time was on artificial turf, while he was timed a 4.37 on grass on the same day. He was also measured at in his vertical leap. He was a second team All-Suncoast region and first team All-Pinellas County team selection. =Junior= Prior to his junior season, he verbally committed to the University of Michigan where he would play for Michigan Wolverines football as a freshman for the 2015 team via Twitter. At the time, he still attended East Lake High School, where he was about to play his junior year for the 2013 football team. At the time of his July 27, 2013 verbal commitment, he was ranked as the number one athlete and number three player in the class of 2015 by ESPN. When Scout.com released its first list of 5-star rated football players on August 12, 2013, Campbell was included among the 20 players listed and the only wide receiver included. At the end of that summer prior to his junior year football season, he was one of two juniors selected to the 2013 USA Today preseason All-USA team. He accepted an invitation to participate in the 2015 Under Armour All-America Game in St. Petersburg before the end of October 2013. The November 15 FHSAA Class 7A region quarterfinal that East Lake won 13–12 ended with an alleged punch by a Palmetto High School coach that left Campbell with a cut inside his mouth. Other players were involved in the altercation, which is being investigated by the FHSAA. On November 19, 2013, ESPN moved Campbell up to the number two overall position in the class of 2015. This moved him ahead of Kevin Toliver II, but he remained behind Jashon Cornell. In Campbell's third time in the FHSAA, East Lake finally got past the regional finals (defeating Port Charlotte High School), only to lose the following week on December 6, 2013, in the state semifinals in overtime to Dwyer High School 31–24, despite a 65-yard touchdown reception by Campbell. Following the season, Campbell decommitted from Michigan on December 13. =Senior= He subsequently named the 10 schools he was considering, while excluding Michigan on July 28, 2014. The 10 schools were LSU, Alabama, Florida, FSU, Georgia, Clemson, UCLA, Ole Miss, Auburn, and Maryland. On September 5, he selected Florida State. College Campbell spent four years at Florida State. His best season was his junior season when he caught 6 passes for 122 yards. Upon graduation, he announced his graduate transfer to Penn State in February 2019. However, he ended up at West Virginia University in June after failing to secure admission into a graduate program at Penn State. 7 of his 19 receptions at West Virginia, where he averaged 24.7 yards per reception, were for touchdowns. Professional career After going undrafted in the 2020 NFL Draft, Campbell signed with the New York Jets on May 6, 2020. He was waived on September 5, 2020.

Overview  Nao, a Japanese American second generation or a teenage native Californian girl, experiences the pain and discomfort of being uprooted from her home in Silicon Valley after her father loses his job, prompting her family's move back to Tokyo. Identifying as an American, feeling like \\"an ordinary California girl adopted by Japanese parents,\\" she feels alienated in her new environment and finds it difficult to relate to the Japanese part of her identity.Page 136, Ruth Ozeki, Probject Muse, A Tale for the Time Being, March 12, 2013, Penguin Books. Part of this discomfort derives from the fact that – unlike her parents, who identify as Japanese and speak the language fluently – she only speaks Japanese on a conversational level and has very limited knowledge about, as well as exposure to, the culture. Identifying more as an American, she feels a complete discord with her surroundings, and feels as if her \\"life is unreal, and Sunnyvale, which was real, was a jillion miles away in time and space, like the beautiful Earth from outer space.\\"Page 79, Ruth Ozeki, Probject Muse, A Tale for the Time Being, March 12, 2013, Penguin Books. She struggles in assimilating to a new, Japanese environment and experiences the disorientation of being viewed as \\"the other\\" in the country of her ethnic heritage. Her foreignness in Japan, as an American, causes relentless bullying from her classmates at a public Japanese school. Not only does she have to grapple with her own social struggles, Nao is also plagued with an unhappy family life. Her father, unable to find a job in Japan, falls into a state of depression – withdrawing from the world and going into a state of social seclusion, or hikikomori – and attempts suicide twice. Her mother is constantly absent from the house, busy with her new job at a publishing firm, which she has taken up to compensate for her husband's unemployment. Unable to find hope for the future in her current circumstances, Nao is considering suicide when she first starts writing her diary at a French maid café in Akihabara. Before she takes her own life, Nao is determined to document the life of her great grandmother, a Buddhist nun who is more than one hundred years old. Nao finds comfort in writing in her diary, addressing an imagined reader and friend. Nao becomes distracted while she is writing the diary, however, and what she actually ends up doing is capturing her own life to readers. Her diary entries cover a broad range of topics, and are characterized by their non-linear chronology; she jumps back in time to describe events that have taken place further back in the past, and makes frequent interjections – both to speak to the reader, and to send text messages to her grandmother. Things start to look more positive after she spends a summer with her grandmother in Sendai, however. Jiko introduces Nao to new concepts such as zazen and helps her find a way to seek spiritual solace from her turbulent daily life and allow her to gain psychological strength to deal with difficult circumstances. Through Jiko, Nao forms a stronger connection to Japan. While Nao is in Sendai, she also unravels some family history, finding out about her great-uncle's involvement in World War II. On the other side of the Pacific, Ruth, a novelist living on a small island off the coast of British Columbia, finds a Hello Kitty lunchbox washed up on the beach—possibly debris from the tsunami that struck Japan in 2011. Inside is Nao's diary, and Ruth becomes heavily invested in this narrative, and in finding out Nao's fate. Due to the geographic seclusion and rural nature of her home, Ruth feels isolated from the rest of the world in her environment. She feels a strong connection to Nao, and yearns to locate her in the real world in order to affirm her wellbeing. Ruth succeeds in finding several traces of Nao's father and great-grandmother online; however, her efforts to do so are continually thwarted. These attempts eventually culminate in a curious convergence between the two worlds.  Cultural context  In the 1980s and 1990s, many assimilation and immigration narratives had been published within the canon of Asian American women's literature; one example of such a novel is Jasmine. Ozeki's novel, however, marks the emergence of new genre of narratives: the return narrative, which depicts immigrants' assimilation back into the country of their ethnic heritage. Main characters * Nao Yasutani – one of the protagonists of the novel, a 16-year-old native Nisei (second-generation Japanese American immigrant) Californian girl. * Jiko Yasutani – Nao's great-grandmother, who is a Zen Buddhist nun.

In studying topological spaces, one often considers continuous maps f:X \\\\to Y, and while equivariant topology also considers such maps, there is the additional constraint that each map \\"respects symmetry\\" in both its domain and target space. The notion of symmetry is usually captured by considering a group action of G on X and Y and demanding that f is equivariant under this action, so that f(g\\\\cdot x)=g \\\\cdot f(x) for all x \\\\in X, a property usually denoted by f:X \\\\to_{G} Y . Heuristically speaking, standard topology views two spaces as equivalent \\"up to deformation,\\" but equivariant topology considers spaces equivalent up to deformation so long as it pays attention to any symmetry possessed by both spaces. A famous theorem of equivariant topology is the Borsuk–Ulam theorem , which asserts that every \\\\mathbf{Z}_2-equivariant map f:S^n \\\\to \\\\mathbb R^n necessarily vanishes.  Induced G-bundles  An important construction used in equivariant cohomology and other applications includes a naturally occurring group bundle (see principal bundle for details). Let us first consider the case where G acts freely on X. Then, given a G-equivariant map f:X \\\\to_G Y, we obtain sections s_f: X/G \\\\to (X \\\\times Y)/G given by [x] \\\\mapsto [x,f(x)], where X \\\\times Y gets the diagonal action, g(x,y)=(gx,gy) and the bundle is p:(X \\\\times Y)/G \\\\to X/G, with fiber Y and projection given by p([x,y])=[x] . Often, the total space is written X \\\\times_G Y More generally, the assignment s_f actually does not map to (X \\\\times Y)/G generally. Since f is equivariant, if g \\\\in G_x(the isotropy subgroup), then by equivariance, we have that g \\\\cdot f(x)=f(g \\\\cdot x)=f(x), so in fact f will map to the collection of \\\\\\\\{[x,y] \\\\in (X \\\\times Y)/G \\\\mid G_x \\\\subset G_y\\\\\\\\}. In this case, one can replace the bundle by a homotopy quotient where G acts freely and is bundle homotopic to the induced bundle on X by f.  Applications To Discrete Geometry  In the same way that one can deduce the ham sandwich theorem from the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem, one can find many applications of equivariant topology to problems of discrete geometry. This is accomplished by using the configuration-space test-map paradigm: Given a geometric problem P, we define the configuration space, X, which parametrizes all associated solutions to the problem (such as points, lines, or arcs.) Additionally, we consider a test space Z \\\\subset V and a map f:X \\\\to V where p \\\\in X is a solution to a problem if and only if f(p) \\\\in Z. Finally, it is usual to consider natural symmetries in a discrete problem by some group G that acts on X and V so that f is equivariant under these actions. The problem is solved if we can show the nonexistence of an equivariant map f:X \\\\to V\\\\setminus Z. Obstructions to the existence of such maps are often formulated algebraically from the topological data of X and V\\\\setminus Z. An archetypal example of such an obstruction can be derived having V a vector space and Z=\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}. In this case, a nonvanishing map would also induce a nonvanishing section s_f:x \\\\mapsto [x,f(x)] from the discussion above, so \\\\omega_n(X \\\\times_G Y), the top Stiefel–Whitney class would need to vanish.  Examples  * The identity map i:X \\\\to X will always be equivariant. * If we let \\\\mathbf{Z}_2 act antipodally on the unit circle, then z \\\\mapsto z^3is equivariant, since it is an odd function. * Any map h:X \\\\to X/G is equivariant when G acts trivially on the quotient, since h(g\\\\cdot x)=h(x) for all x.

It was composed and conducted by John Debney. The original soundtrack was released on July 1, 1993 through promotional release by Debney, containing 19 tracks from the film. Several bootlegs were released on the internet, mainly because the promotional release misses the entire opening sequence music. On September 30, 2013, Intrada Records re-released a special edition containing the entire score from the film plus bonus material, including alternate takes of some tracks. Background In 1993, Debney released an assembly of the score as a promotional album, which has since become a collector's item. The film did not have a soundtrack album available to the public until Intrada Records released their special complete edition in late 2013. As a result of the score being cut from its original running time of over 60 minutes down to 43 minutes in Debney's promo, as well as all the music from the prologue sequence being removed, many bootleg recordings of the score began to appear across the internet, all of which contained all the music from the film in addition to never before heard alternates (some of which did not appear on the official release). The music was conducted by Debney and orchestrated by Brad Dechter and Don Davis. James Horner was originally slated to score the film, but became unavailable at the last minute, so Debney had only two weeks to score the 96-minute film. Prior to the production of the film, Horner wrote a two-minute theme for Sarah (commonly known as \\"Come Little Children\\"), which ended up being used in the film, and featured in Intrada's edition of the score (officially titled \\"Sarah's Theme\\").

It is a categorification of the Burnside ring of G. Definitions Let G be a finite group (in fact everything will work verbatim for a profinite group). Then for any two finite G-sets X and Y we can define an equivalence relation among spans of G-sets of the form X\\\\leftarrow U \\\\rightarrow Y where two spans X\\\\leftarrow U \\\\rightarrow Y and X\\\\leftarrow W \\\\rightarrow Yare equivalent if and only if there is a G-equivariant bijection of U and W commuting with the projection maps to X and Y. This set of equivalence classes form naturally a monoid under disjoint union; we indicate with A(G)(X,Y) the group completion of that monoid. Taking pullbacks induces natural maps A(G)(X,Y)\\\\times A(G)(Y,Z)\\\\rightarrow A(G)(X,Z). Finally we can define the Burnside category A(G) of G as the category whose objects are finite G-sets and the morphisms spaces are the groups A(G)(X,Y). Properties * A(G) is an additive category with direct sums given by the disjoint union of G-sets and zero object given by the empty G-set; * The product of two G-sets induces a symmetric monoidal structure on A(G); * The endomorphism ring of the point (that is the G-set with only one element) is the Burnside ring of G; * A(G) is equivalent to the full subcategory of the homotopy category of genuine G-spectra spanned by the suspension spectra of finite G-sets. Mackey functors If C is an additive category, then a C-valued Mackey functor is an additive functor from A(G) to C. Mackey functors are important in representation theory and stable equivariant homotopy theory. * To every G-representation V we can associate a Mackey functor in vector spaces sending every finite G-set U to the vector space of G-equivariant maps from U to V. * The homotopy groups of a genuine G-spectrum form a Mackey functor.

He previously served as head of the International Division of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (2010–2012) Direct download (Word 2003) and as Ambassador to Israel (2013–2017). His appointment to the latter post, at the age of 37, made him one of Australia's youngest ambassadors and the second Australian ambassador of Indian heritage. Early life and education Sharma was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in 1975, to a Hindu Indian father and a European Canadian mother. His family moved to Turramurra in Sydney, in 1979.

He then returned to Sydney and studied medicine at Sydney Medical School. Following a year of studying medicine, he began working as a public servant for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and completed a Masters in International Relations through Deakin University.

Sharma was appointed the Ambassador to Israel by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bob Carr, on 16 May 2013 replacing Andrea Faulkner. Sharma presented his credentials to Israeli President Shimon Peres on 8 August 2013. Several sources incorrectly cited Sharma, aged 37, as the youngest person to be appointed as an Australian ambassador. However, at least four others had been appointed at younger ages. He is the second Australian Ambassador of Indian heritage, the first being Peter Varghese. While in Israel, Sharma and his wife Rachel, visited casualties of the Syrian civil war in the Ziv Medical Center in Zefat.

Independent candidate Kerryn Phelps won the by-election, but Sharma was pre-selected again to run as the Liberal candidate for Wentworth at the 2019 Australian federal election, and won the seat from Phelps. Subsequently Sharma lost control of the domain name for his campaign web site by failing to renew it.  Controversies  In May 2014 Sharma caused a diplomatic incident by meeting with the Israeli Housing and Construction Minister, Uri Ariel, in Israeli government offices located in occupied East Jerusalem, resulting in a formal complaint from the chief Palestinian UN negotiator to Julie Bishop, the then Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the meeting may be deemed as aiding and abetting … illegal Israeli policies. After his preselection as the candidate for Wentworth, Sharma apologised for an opinion piece published the previous June in The Sydney Morning Herald where he argued that school infrastructure was underused and teachers worked only three-quarters the hours of a full-time job. On 26 September 2018, Sharma's campaign team was accused by other candidates in the by-election of removing their campaign posters and replacing them with Sharma's posters.

When its construction began in July 1918, it was to be called the Touchstone Convalescent Club, and it was intended to be a hospital for the wounded of World War I.Curl 1984. p. 42 But the war ended a few months later, and it changed into a private club. The Club has no sign, website, or Wi-Fi. Cell phones are prohibited. History Paris Singer and his good friend, the architect Addison Mizner, were visiting Palm Beach in the spring of 1918. Singer decided to build a hospital with Mizner as the architect. Singer had already built three hospitals in France for the wounded. It was during World War I when only war-related buildings could be built. Construction began in July. (The site at the west end of Worth Avenue formerly contained Alligator Joe's, a tourist attraction.) By November 1918 seven residential villas and a medical center had been built on the north side of Worth Avenue, across from the main building. Singer purchased laboratory and surgical equipment and fittings for an operating room. Singer sent out as many as 300,000 invitations to eligible Army and Navy officers, who had to be screened and had to be able to pay their own room and board. However, World War I had ended, and most former soldiers wanted to go home. The hospital was reinvisioned as a private club; the medical equipment was donated to a hospital in West Palm Beach. There was a main building, eight separate villas, tennis courts, a parking garage across the street, and a yacht basin. The club opened on 25 January 1919. Paris Singer was the President of the club and he decided who could become a member. For its second season in 1920, Mizner supervised the construction of a nine-hole golf course and the landscaping of the club's 60 acres. He also built Via Mizner, an addition on Worth Avenue with eleven apartments and sixteen shops.Curl 1984. p. 49 Mizner's design for the Everglades Club was widely considered to be the biggest success of his career.\\" It helped establish a new architectural style for Florida.Curl 1984. p. 59 In the club's first season Mizner received four architectural commissions. He went on to become America's foremost society architect of his era.Curl 1984. p. 60 Singer began his club with twenty-five charter members. Two years later, the membership was closed at 500 members.Michener 1984. p. 19 Eliza Osgood Vanderbilt Webb (1860–1936) was one of its earliest female members.Vanderbilt rehab a study in family memories, The Chicago Tribune, May 01, 2005 Businessman Jack C. Massey was a member. An additional nine holes were added to the golf course in 1930. Today (2018) The club deliberately does not have a website. Cellphones are prohibited on the property. When journalist Ian Brown approached the club in 2016, an employee dressed \\"straight out of Dickens\\" intercepted him and, when asked, denied that it was the Everglades Club.

According to 2009 president William Panill, no black has ever applied. The Club now has Jewish members, but how many is unknown because, according to Panill, \\"we don't ask.\\" As another member put it, the current policy on Jews is \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\". Panill admitted in 2009 that he receives inquiries about whether a member can bring a Jewish guest. Further reading * References ;Notes ;Bibliography * Curl, Donald W. Mizner's Florida.

Prior to this cane developing grape clusters it could have been planted in the ground to propagate by layering. The propagation of grapevines is an important consideration in commercial viticulture and winemaking. Grapevines, most of which belong to the Vitis vinifera family, produce one crop of fruit each growing season with a limited life span for individual vines. While some centenarian old vine examples of grape varieties exist, most grapevines are between the ages of 10 and 30 years. As vineyard owners seek to replant their vines, a number of techniques are available which may include planting a new cutting that has been selected by either clonal or mass (massal) selection. Vines can also be propagated by grafting a new plant vine upon existing rootstock or by layering one of the canes of an existing vine into the ground next to the vine and severing the connection when the new vine develops its own root system.Wine & Spirits Education Trust \\"Wine and Spirits: Understanding Wine Quality\\" pgs 2-5, Second Revised Edition (2012), London, In commercial viticulture, grapevines are rarely propagated from seedlings as each seed contains unique genetic information from its two parent varieties (the flowering parent and the parent that provided the pollen that fertilized the flower) and would, theoretically, be a different variety than either parent. This would be true even if two hermaphroditic vine varieties, such as Chardonnay, cross pollinated each other. While the grape clusters that would arise from the pollination would be considered Chardonnay any vines that sprang from one of the seeds of the grape berries would be considered a distinct variety other than Chardonnay. It is for this reason that grapevines are usually propagated from cuttings while grape breeders will utilize seedlings to come up with new grape varieties including crossings that include parents of two varieties within the same species (such as Cabernet Sauvignon which is a crossing of the Vitis vinifera varieties Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon blanc) or hybrid grape varieties which include parents from two different Vitis species such as the Armagnac grape Baco blanc, which was propagated from the vinifera grape Folle blanche and the Vitis labrusca variety Noah. Terminology Pinot gris (center) and Pinot blanc (right) are color mutations of Pinot noir (left). A color mutation is a grape variety that while genetically similar to the original variety is considered unique enough to merit being considered its own variety. Both Pinot gris and Pinot blanc are color mutations of Pinot noir. In viticulture, a clone is single vine that has been selected from a \\"mother vine\\" to which it is identical. This clone may have been selected deliberately from a grapevine that has demonstrated desirable traits (good yields, grape disease resistance, small berry size, etc.) and propagated as cuttings from that mother vine. Varieties such as Sangiovese and Pinot noir are well known to have a variety of clones. While there may be slight mutations to differentiate the various clones, all clones are considered genetically part of the same variety (i.e. Sangiovese or Pinot noir).J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pgs 183-184 Oxford University Press 2006 A selection massale is the opposite of cloning, where growers select cuttings from the mass of the vineyard, or a field blend. A crossing is a new grape variety that was created by the cross pollination of two different varieties of the same species. Syrah is a crossing of two French Vitis vinifera species, Dureza from the Ardèche and Mondeuse blanche from Savoie.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 316, 528 & 1023, Allen Lane 2012 Theoretically, every seedling (also known as a selfling), even if its pollinated by a member of the same grape variety (i.e. such as two Merlot vines), is a crossing as any vine that results from the seed being planted will be a different grape variety distinct from either parent. A hybrid is a new grape variety that was produced from a cross pollination of two different grape species. In the early history of American winemaking, grape growers would cross the European Vitis vinifera vines with American vine varieties such as Vitis labrusca to create French- American hybrids that were more resistant to American grape diseases such as downy and powdery mildew as well as phylloxera. When the phylloxera epidemic of the mid to late 19th century hit Europe, some growers in European wine regions experimented with using hybrids until a solution involving grafting American rootstocks to vinifera varieties was found. Eventually, the use of hybrids in wine production declined with their use formally outlawed by European wine laws in the 1950s. Young vine cuttings in a nursery.  Propagation Methods  As commercial winemakers usually want to work with a desired grape variety that dependably produces a particular crop, most grapevines are propagated by clonal or massal selection of plant material. This can be accomplished in one of three ways. = Cuttings = This involves a shoot taken from a mother vine and then planted where the shoot will eventually sprout a root system and regenerate itself into a full-fledged vine with trunk and canopy. Often new cuttings will be first planted in a nursery where it is allowed to develop for a couple of years before being planted in the vineyard. = Grafting = Grafting is a process in which a new grape vine is produced by making a cut in the rootstock and then adding scionwood that is cut to fit inside the incision made in the rootstock. This involves removing the canopy and most of the trunk of an existing vine and replacing it with a cutting of a new vine that is sealed by a graft union. There are two main types of grafting in the relation to the propagation of a grapevine.  Bench Grafting  Omega Graft This process is typically performed in the beginning of a new year in a greenhouse, taking place during the late winter months, to the early spring months. This process is used on younger and smaller vines before the vines are planted in a vineyard. However, the type of cut made on the grape vine determines the classification of the Bench graft. The two techniques to perform a Bench Graft includes the Omega Graft and the Whip Graft. The Omega Graft is performed by the rootstock and scion being grafted together by the two pieces being cut into shapes that align together. The Whip Graft is performed by making an identical small dip at angle into the rootstock and the scion, so they can be adjoined.  Field Grafting  Field grafting is performed after the vine has been planted in a vineyard and has aged a few years. The objective of using this method is to avoid replanting and a final product of a grapevine with two diversifications. The procedure of field grafting is performed with the vines still planted, by making two inversions in the rootstock of a certain type of grapevines and placing two of the same type of scions that differ from the rootstock into the rootstock. The most common ways to perform field grafting are the Chip Bud method, the T Bud method, the Cleft Graft and the Bark Graft. The Chip Bud Method is performed shortly after the grape vine is planted, giving the rootstock enough time to become active but the bud of the grape vine is still inactive. It is performed by cutting two small slopes in both sides of the rootstock and cutting a small scion into a small bud and placing the scion bud into the cuts made on the rootstock. The T Bud Method is performed by making a cutting a T at the bottom of the grapevine that is above the soil. Once the T is cut, the bark surrounding the cut is pulled back and the scion is placed between the two sides that were pulled back. The Chip Graft is performed on the branches of a grape vine, when the rootstock is dormant. The method is performed by making a wedge in the rootstock and placing two scions into the wedge. After the Graft starts growing one of the scions is removed, leaving only one to grow. The Bark Graft is performed by making three incisions on the edge of the grape vine's rootstock, and removing majority of the bark around each of the cuttings, leaving a small amount of bark at the end of the cut and inserting three of the same scions into the incisions, using the remaining piece of the cut bark to cover the end of the scions. = Layering = In established vineyards where only a few vines need to be replaced within a row (such as vine lost to machine damage or disease), a new vine can be propagated by bending a cane from a neighboring vine into the ground and covering it with dirt. This segment of vine will soon begin sprouting its own independent root system while still being nourished by the connecting vine. Eventually, the connection between the two vines is severed, allowing each vine to grow independently. Clonal versus massal selection One criticism of clonal selection is that the use of only one or two clones greatly diminishes the genetic diversity of a vineyard. Each cutting, taken from a mother vine, is a clone of that vine. The way that a vine grower selects these cuttings can be described as either clonal or massal selection. In clonal selection, an ideal plant within a vineyard or nursery that has exhibited the most desirable traits is selected with all cuttings taken from that single plant. In massal (or \\"mass\\") selection, cuttings are taken from several vines of the same variety that have collectively demonstrated desirable traits. A vineyard in the Napa Valley showing which particular clone of Cabernet Sauvignon is planted in this block. Historically, massal selection was the primary means of vineyard propagation, particularly in traditional vineyards where vines are only sporadically replaced, often by layering a cane from a neighboring vine. In the 1950s, the isolation and identification of desirable clones in nurseries and breeding stations lead to an increase in clonal selection with new vineyard plantings seeking out clones from well established vineyards and wine region. This trend towards clonal selection has seen some criticism from wine writers and viticulturalists who complain about \\"mono-clonal\\" viticulture that has the risk of producing wines that are overly similar and dull. Other criticisms of clonal selection involve the increased risk in vineyards lacking genetic diversity among its vines as well as the changing priorities in wine production. While many clones in the mid to late 20th century were isolated, some of the desirable traits exhibited by those clones (such as early ripening or high yield potential) may no longer be as desirable today where other traits (such as low yields and drought resistance) may be more prized.

Automation bias stems from the social psychology literature that found a bias in human-human interaction that showed that people assign more positive evaluations to decisions made by humans than to a neutral object.Bruner, J. S., & Tagiuri, R. 1954. \\"The perception of people\\". In G. Lindzey (Ed.), Handbook of social psychology (vol 2): 634-654. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley. The same type of positivity bias has been found for human-automation interaction, where the automated decisions are rated more positively than neutral. This has become a growing problem for decision making as intensive care units, nuclear power plants, and aircraft cockpits have increasingly integrated computerized system monitors and decision aids to mostly factor out possible human error. Errors of automation bias tend to occur when decision-making is dependent on computers or other automated aids and the human is in an observatory role but able to make decisions. Examples of automation bias range from urgent matters like flying a plane on automatic pilot to such mundane matters as the use of spell-checking programs. Disuse and Misuse An operator's trust in the system can also lead to different interactions with the system, including system use, misuse, disuse, and abuse. The tendency toward overreliance on automated aids is known as \\"automation misuse\\". Misuse of automation can be seen when a user fails to properly monitor an automated system, or when the automated system is used when it should not be. This is in contrast to disuse, where the user does not properly utilize the automation either by turning it off or ignoring it. Both misuse and disuse can be problematic, but automation bias is directly related to misuse of the automation through either too much trust in the abilities of the system, or defaulting to using heuristics. Misuse can lead to lack of monitoring of the automated system or blind agreement with an automation suggestion, categorized by two types of errors, errors of omission and errors of commission, respectively. Automation use and disuse can also influence stages of information processing: information acquisition, information analysis, decision making and action selection, and action implementation. For example, information acquisition, the first step in information processing, is the process by which a user registers input via the senses. An automated engine gauge might assist the user with information acquisition through simple interface features—such as highlighting changes in the engine's performance—thereby directing the user's selective attention. When faced with issues originating from an aircraft, pilots may tend to overtrust an aircraft's engine gauges, losing sight of other possible malfunctions not related to the engine. This attitude is a form of automation complacency and misuse. If, however, the pilot devotes time to interpret the engine gauge, and manipulate the aircraft accordingly, only to discover that the flight turbulence has not changed, the pilot may be inclined to ignore future error recommendations conveyed by an engine gauge—a form of automation complacency leading to disuse.  Errors of commission and omission  Automation bias can take the form of commission errors, which occur when users follow an automated directive without taking into account other sources of information. Conversely, omission errors occur when automated devices fail to detect or indicate problems and the user does not notice because they are not properly monitoring the system. Errors of omission have been shown to result from cognitive vigilance decrements, while errors of commission result from a combination of a failure to take information into account and an excessive trust in the reliability of automated aids. Errors of commission occur for three reasons: (1) overt redirection of attention away from the automated aid; (2) diminished attention to the aid; (3) active discounting of information that counters the aid's recommendations. Omission errors occur when the human decision-maker fails to notice an automation failure, either due to low vigilance or overtrust in the system. For example, a spell-checking program incorrectly marking a word as misspelled and suggesting an alternative would be an error of commission, and a spell-checking program failing to notice a misspelled word would be an error of omission. In these cases, automation bias could be observed by a user accepting the alternative word without consulting a dictionary, or a user not noticing the incorrectly misspelled word and assuming all the words are correct without reviewing the words. Training that focused on the reduction of automation bias and related problems has been shown to lower the rate of commission errors, but not of omission errors. Factors The presence of automatic aids, as one source puts it, \\"diminishes the likelihood that decision makers will either make the cognitive effort to seek other diagnostic information or process all available information in cognitively complex ways.\\" It also renders users more likely to conclude their assessment of a situation too hastily after being prompted by an automatic aid to take a specific course of action. According to one source, there are three main factors that lead to automation bias. First, the human tendency to choose the least cognitive approach to decision-making, which is called the cognitive miser hypothesis. Second, the tendency of humans to view automated aids as having an analytical ability superior to their own. Third, the tendency of humans to reduce their own effort when sharing tasks, either with another person or with an automated aid. Other factors leading to an over-reliance on automation and thus to automation bias include inexperience in a task (though inexperienced users tend to be most benefited by automated decision support systems), lack of confidence in one's own abilities, a lack of readily available alternative information, or desire to save time and effort on complex tasks or high workloads. It has been shown that people who have greater confidence in their own decision-making abilities tend to be less reliant on external automated support, while those with more trust in decision support systems (DSS) were more dependent upon it. =Screen design= One study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, found that the position and prominence of advice on a screen can impact the likelihood of automation bias, with prominently displayed advice, correct or not, is more likely to be followed; another study, however, seemed to discount the importance of this factor. According to another study, a greater amount of on-screen detail can make users less \\"conservative\\" and thus increase the likelihood of automation bias. One study showed that making individuals accountable for their performance or the accuracy of their decisions reduced automation bias. =Availability= \\"The availability of automated decision aids,\\" states one study by Linda Skitka, \\"can sometimes feed into the general human tendency to travel the road of least cognitive effort.\\" =Awareness of process= One study also found that when users are made aware of the reasoning process employed by a decision support system, they are likely to adjust their reliance accordingly, thus reducing automation bias. =Team vs. individual= The performance of jobs by crews instead of individuals acting alone does not necessarily eliminate automation bias. One study has shown that when automated devices failed to detect system irregularities, teams were no more successful than solo performers at responding to those irregularities. =Training= Training that focuses on automation bias in aviation has succeeded in reducing omission errors by student pilots. =Automation failure and \\"learned carelessness\\"= It has been shown that automation failure is followed by a drop in operator trust, which in turn is succeeded by a slow recovery of trust. The decline in trust after an initial automation failure has been described as the first-failure effect. By the same token, if automated aids prove to be highly reliable over time, the result is likely to be a heightened level of automation bias. This is called \\"learned carelessness.\\" = Provision of system confidence information = In cases where system confidence information is provided to users, that information itself can become a factor in automation bias. = External pressures = Studies have shown that the more external pressures are exerted on an individual's cognitive capacity, the more he or she may rely on external support. =Definitional problems= Although automation bias has been the subject of many studies, there continue to be complaints that automation bias remains ill-defined and that reporting of incidents involving automation bias is unsystematic. A review of various automation bias studies categorized the different types of tasks where automated aids were used as well as what function the automated aids served. Tasks where automated aids were used were categorized as monitoring tasks, diagnosis tasks, or treatment tasks. Types of automated assistance were listed as Alerting automation, which track important changes and alert the user, Decision support automation, which may provide a diagnosis or recommendation, or Implementation automation, where the automated aid performs a specified task. Automation-induced complacency The concept of automation bias is viewed as overlapping with automation-induced complacency, also known more simply as automation complacency. Like automation bias, it is a consequence of the misuse of automation and involves problems of attention. While automation bias involves a tendency to trust decision-support systems, automation complacency involves insufficient attention to and monitoring of automation output, usually because that output is viewed as reliable. \\"Although the concepts of complacency and automation bias have been discussed separately as if they were independent,\\" writes one expert, \\"they share several commonalities, suggesting they reflect different aspects of the same kind of automation misuse.\\" It has been proposed, indeed, that the concepts of complacency and automation bias be combined into a single \\"integrative concept\\" because these two concepts \\"might represent different manifestations of overlapping automation-induced phenomena\\" and because \\"automation-induced complacency and automation bias represent closely linked theoretical concepts that show considerable overlap with respect to the underlying processes.\\" Automation complacency has been defined as \\"poorer detection of system malfunctions under automation compared with under manual control.\\" NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) defines complacency as \\"self-satisfaction that may result in non-vigilance based on an unjustified assumption of satisfactory system state.\\" Several studies have indicated that it occurs most often when operators are engaged in both manual and automated tasks at the same time. In turn, the operators' perceptions of the automated system's reliability can influence the way in which the operator interacts with the system. Endsley (2017) describes how high system reliability can lead users to disengage from monitoring systems, thereby increasing monitoring errors, decreasing situational awareness, and interfering with an operator's ability to re-assume control of the system in the event performance limitations have been exceeded. This complacency can be sharply reduced when automation reliability varies over time instead of remaining constant, but is not reduced by experience and practice. Both expert and inexpert participants can exhibit automation bias as well as automation complacency. Neither of these problems can be easily overcome by training. The term \\"automation complacency\\" was first used in connection with aviation accidents or incidents in which pilots, air-traffic controllers, or other workers failed to check systems sufficiently, assuming that everything was fine when, in reality, an accident was about to occur. Operator complacency, whether or not automation-related, has long been recognized as a leading factor in air accidents. As such, perceptions of reliability, in general, can result in a form of automation irony, in which more automation can decrease cognitive workload but increase the opportunity for monitoring errors. In contrast, low automation can increase workload but decrease the opportunity for monitoring errors. Take, for example, a pilot flying through inclement weather, in which continuous thunder interferes with the pilot's ability to understand information transmitted by an air traffic controller (ATC). Despite how much effort is allocated to understanding information transmitted by ATC, the pilot's performance is limited by the source of information needed for the task. The pilot therefore has to rely on automated gauges in the cockpit to understand flight path information. If the pilot perceives the automated gauges to be highly reliable, the amount of effort needed to understand ATC and automated gauges may decrease. Moreover, if the automated gauges are perceived to be highly reliable, the pilot may ignore those gauges to devote mental resources for deciphering information transmitted by ATC. In so doing, the pilot becomes a complacent monitor, thereby running the risk of missing critical information conveyed by the automated gauges. If, however, the pilot perceives the automated gauges to be unreliable, the pilot will now have to interpret information from ATC and automated gauges simultaneously. This creates scenarios in which the operator may be expending unnecessary cognitive resources when the automation is in fact reliable, but also increasing the odds of identifying potential errors in the weather gauges should they occur. To calibrate the pilot's perception of reliability, automation should be designed to maintain workload at appropriate levels while also ensuring the operator remains engaged with monitoring tasks. The operator should be less likely to disengage from monitoring when the system's reliability can change as compared to a system that has consistent reliability (Parasuraman, 1993). To some degree, user complacency offsets the benefits of automation, and when an automated system's reliability level falls below a certain level, then automation will no longer be a net asset. One 2007 study suggested that this automation occurs when the reliability level reaches approximately 70%. Other studies have found that automation with a reliability level below 70% can be of use to persons with access to the raw information sources, which can be combined with the automation output to improve performance. Sectors Automation bias has been examined across many research fields. It can be a particularly major concern in aviation, medicine, process control, and military command-and-control operations. =Aviation= At first, discussion of automation bias focused largely on aviation. Automated aids have played an increasing role in cockpits, taking a growing role in the control of such flight tasks as determining the most fuel-efficient routes, navigating, and detecting and diagnosing system malfunctions. The use of these aids, however, can lead to less attentive and less vigilant information seeking and processing on the part of human beings. In some cases, human beings may place more confidence in the misinformation provided by flight computers than in their own skills. An important factor in aviation-related automation bias is the degree to which pilots perceive themselves as responsible for the tasks being carried out by automated aids. One study of pilots showed that the presence of a second crewmember in the cockpit did not affect automation bias. A 1994 study compared the impact of low and high levels of automation (LOA) on pilot performance, and concluded that pilots working with a high LOA spent less time reflecting independently on flight decisions. In another study, all of the pilots given false automated alerts that instructed them to shut off an engine did so, even though those same pilots insisted in an interview that they would not respond to such an alert by shutting down an engine, and would instead have reduced the power to idle. One 1998 study found that pilots with approximately 440 hours of flight experience detected more automation failures than did nonpilots, although both groups showed complacency effects. A 2001 study of pilots using a cockpit automation system, the Engine-indicating and crew-alerting system (EICAS), showed evidence of complacency. The pilots detected fewer engine malfunctions when using the system than when performing the task manually. In a 2005 study, experienced air-traffic controllers used high-fidelity simulation of an ATC (Free Flight) scenario that involved the detection of conflicts among \\"self-separating\\" aircraft. They had access to an automated device that identified potential conflicts several minutes ahead of time. When the device failed near the end of the simulation process, considerably fewer controllers detected the conflict than when the situation was handled manually. Other studies have produced similar findings. Two studies of automation bias in aviation discovered a higher rate of commission errors than omission errors, while another aviation study found 55% omission rates and 0% commission rates. Automation-related omissions errors are especially common during the cruise phase. When a China Airlines flight lost power in one engine, the autopilot attempted to correct for this problem by lowering the left wing, an action that hid the problem from the crew. When the autopilot was disengaged, the airplane rolled to the right and descended steeply, causing extensive damage. The 1983 shooting down of a Korean Airlines 747 over Soviet airspace occurred because the Korean crew \\"relied on automation that had been inappropriately set up, and they never checked their progress manually.\\" =Health care= Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are designed to aid clinical decision-making. They have the potential to effect a great improvement in this regard, and to result in improved patient outcomes. Yet while CDSS, when used properly, bring about an overall improvement in performance, they also cause errors that may not be recognized owing to automation bias. One danger is that the incorrect advice given by these systems may cause users to change a correct decision that they have made on their own. Given the highly serious nature of some of the potential consequences of AB in the health-care field, it is especially important to be aware of this problem when it occurs in clinical settings. Sometimes automation bias in clinical settings is a major problem that renders CDSS, on balance, counterproductive; sometimes it is minor problem, with the benefits outweighing the damage done. One study found more automation bias among older users, but it was noted that could be a result not of age but of experience. Studies suggest, indeed, that familiarity with CDSS often leads to desensitization and habituation effects. Although automation bias occurs more often among persons who are inexperienced in a given task, inexperienced users exhibit the most performance improvement when they use CDSS. In one study, the use of CDSS improved clinicians' answers by 21%, from 29% to 50%, with 7% of correct non-CDSS answers being changed incorrectly. A 2005 study found that when primary-care physicians used electronic sources such as PubMed, Medline, and Google, there was a \\"small to medium\\" increase in correct answers, while in an equally small percentage of instances the physicians were misled by their use of those sources, and changed correct to incorrect answers. Studies in 2004 and 2008 that involved the effect of automated aids on diagnosis of breast cancer found clear evidence of automation bias involving omission errors. Cancers diagnosed in 46% of cases without automated aids were discovered in only 21% of cases with automated aids that failed to identify the cancer. =Military= Automation bias can be a crucial factor in the use of intelligent decision support systems for military command-and-control operations. One 2004 study found that automation bias effects have contributed to a number of fatal military decisions, including friendly-fire killings during the Iraq War. Researchers have sought to determine the proper LOA for decision support systems in this field. =Automotive= Automation complacency is also a challenge for automated driving systems in which the human only has to monitor the system or act as a fallback driver. This is for example discussed in the report of National Transportation Safety Board about the fatal accident between an UBER test vehicle and pedestrian Elaine Herzberg. Correcting bias Automation bias can be mitigated by the design of automated systems, such as reducing the prominence of the display, decreasing detail or complexity of information displayed, or couching automated assistance as supportive information rather than as directives or commands. Training on an automated system, which includes introducing deliberate errors has been shown to be significantly more effective at reducing automation bias than just informing users that errors can occur. However, excessive checking and questioning automated assistance can increase time pressures and complexity of tasks thus reducing the benefits of automated assistance, so design of an automated decision support system can balance positive and negative effects rather than attempt to eliminate negative effects.

Originally an ore boat, she spent most of her career as a cement carrier when much larger ore boats became common. After a 107-year-long working career as a self-propelled boat, she was converted into a barge and paired with the tug Prentiss Brown as an integrated tug-barge. Before conversion, she was the oldest operating self-propelled lake freighter on the Great Lakes, as well as being one of the last freight-carrying vessels on the Great Lakes to be powered by steam engines. Operating history =Steamship= The vessel was launched on February 7, 1906, by Great Lakes Engineering Works in Ecorse, Michigan. The shipyard had received an order to rivet together the plates of a hull for what was then the booming Minnesota iron ore trade. Soon the large boat, christened William P. Snyder, was shuttling hematite for the Shenango Furnace Company. William P. Snyder was beginning her working life at the same time as the development of the assembly line for bolting together consumer goods made with steel, such as automobiles. Iron ore boats would have plenty of work to do. William P. Snyder also carried iron ore to furnaces to make munitions used in World War I and World War II. The Snyder in drydock Originally powered by two Scotch boilers, the vessel, by now renamed Elton Hoyt II, was repowered in 1950 with a Skinner Unaflow steam engine and two watertube boilers. This would be the first of five separate renamings as the vessel repeatedly changed owners. Too small by the 1960s to serve as a profitable ore boat, the vessel was laid up and then, in 1966, plucked out of a freshwater boneyard for reconversion and new life as a cement carrier for the Medusa Portland Cement Co. Now based in Charlevoix, Michigan and named Medusa Challenger, the aging steamship shuttled powdered cement from Northern Michigan to a wide variety of roadbuilding contractors in various port locations on the Great Lakes. In Chicago she acquired a reputation as a \\"jinx ship\\" that caused the city's drawbridges to become stuck when they were raised to let her pass, causing long delays to traffic. Such an incident became the setting for the 1977 dramatic film Medusa Challenger. In 1998 the Medusa Corporation was acquired by Southdown Inc., of Houston and the vessel was renamed Southdown Challenger. After two more acquisitions, the vessel became the property of St. Marys Cement Inc. of Toronto in 2005 and finally renamed St. Marys Challenger. During her second half-century of life the vessel became a favorite of boatwatchers up and down the Great Lakes as a final example of the riveted steamships of the Second Industrial Revolution. =Barge= In November 2013 St. Marys Challenger reached the end of her working life as a self-propelled vessel. She steamed to the Bay Shipbuilding Co. in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, to be cut down to an articulated lake barge pushed by a dedicated tugboat. The refitting of the former steamship lake carrier as a barge was described as a work with a cost of more than $10 million. The tug Prentiss Brown had been built in 1967 in Gulfport, Texas and worked in Florida and New York before coming to the Great Lakes in 2008.PRENTISS BROWN, tugboat information.com The two-element vessel combination resumed the dedicated transport of powdered cement on the Great Lakes. In this trade, it was described in 2019 as making about 30 annual trips to the Port of Chicago. The lake vessel's now-redundant pilothouse was conserved and, in spring 2015, was donated to the National Museum of the Great Lakes for display in Toledo, Ohio. Pilothouse restoration work has uncovered the vessel's original name, William P. Snyder.

It is a colorless liquid that is a degradation product of methionine. It is a notable flavor in potato-based snacks, namely potato chips, one of the most popular foods containing methional.Faith C. Belanger, Rong Di & Daphna Havkin-Frenkel (2009) Increasing the Methional Content in Potato through Biotechnology, Biotechnology in Flavor Production, 185-188, Traces of the compound can also be found in black tea and green tea based products. Methional contains both aldehyde and thioether functional groups. It is readily soluble in alcohol solvents, including propylene glycol and dipropylene glycol.  Occurrence  In nature, methional is a thermally-induced volatile flavor compound. For instance, the heat-initiated Maillard reaction of reducing sugars and amino acids forms the initial basis of methional's composition. The formation of methional stems from the interaction of α-dicarbonyl compounds (intermediate products in the Maillard reaction) with methionine (Met) by the Strecker degradation reaction: :CH3SCH2CH2(NH2)CHCO2H + O → CH3SCH2CH2(HN=)CCO2H + H2O :CH3SCH2CH2(HN=)CCO2H + H2O → CH3SCH2CH2CHO + NH3 \\\\+ CO2 Methional easily degrades into methanethiol, which then oxidizes into dimethyl disulfide. Dimethyl disulfide is partly responsible for the \\"reactive sulfur\\" that contributes to the taste of potatoes. Furthermore, the methionine resulting from the Strecker degradation reaction produces alkyl pyrazines, which contribute to the flavors in roasted, toasted, or thermally processed foods. Due to the ease of its decomposition, a large portion of methional is lost during potato processing. Similarly, in the presence of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and light, methionine is nonenzymatically oxidized into methional, ammonia, and carbon dioxide.S. F. Yang, H. S. Ku & H. K.

For the purpose of animal feed supplements, enantiopure methionine is not required. Methional is a versatile reagent in organic chemistry. = Biological routes = Because of their high cost, methional or its precursor methionine are not added during potato processing. In order to intensify flavoring of heat-processed potato foods, biotechnological approaches are used to increase methionine levels, and thus methional levels, in potato foods. The enzyme aminotransferase acts on methionine to remove the amine and form an α-keto-γ-methylthiobutyric acid. As catalyzed by α-keto acid decarboxylase, this ketomethylthiobutyric acid converts to methional.María Del Carmen Martínez-Cuesta , Carmen Peláez & Teresa Requena (2013) Methionine Metabolism: Major Pathways and Enzymes Involved and Strategies for Control and Diversification of Volatile Sulfur Compounds in Cheese, Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition, 53:4, 366-385. :CH3S(CH2)2CH(NH2)CO2H + O → CH3S(CH2)2COCO2H + NH3 :CH3S(CH2)2COCO2H → CH3S(CH2)2CHO + CO2 References Thioethers Flavors Aldehydes ","title":"Methional"},{"id":"41145504","text":"John Henry Stanford (September 14, 1938 – November 28, 1998) was a United States Army major general who later became superintendent of public schools in Seattle.

Fulton County Executive In 1991, Stanford was hired as executive of Fulton County, Georgia. As county executive in Atlanta, he earned praise from civic leaders, though progress on his agenda of cutting bureaucracy and waste in county government was often impeded by infighting among members of the county commission. Seattle Schools Superintendent Without a background in educational administration, he was recruited in 1995 for the post of superintendent of the Seattle Public Schools, becoming the school district's first African-American administrator. Stanford believed the school system exhibited the lethargic characteristics of a monopoly and said it had \\"an inward kind of thinking that is more concerned about the comfort of the people who run the system than the public it is supposed to serve.\\" Arriving in Seattle, Stanford reassigned one-third of the district's principals. He announced that poor customer service by staff would be punishable by firing, students who did not meet minimum academic requirements would be prevented from advancing to the next grade level, and that future school construction would be \\"on cost and on time.\\" He also moved to end desegregation busing. Stanford was seen as a charismatic, popular leader, and - in his first year on the job - was credited with helping to raise more than $2 million in private donations to support district initiatives. Dropout rates in Seattle schools declined and SAT scores rose during his tenure. The Seattle school board reported that Stanford had met all ten of the goals they had established on his hiring. Some teachers, however, criticized Stanford's emphasis on standardized testing and he was forced to back down from an initiative to allow corporate sponsorships of extracurricular programs in the face of parent opposition. Several of Stanford's proposals, such as introducing school uniforms and restricting the issuance of driver's licenses to students known to affiliate with gangs, never gained traction. In 1996, Stanford addressed the Democratic National Convention. Death Stanford announced he had leukemia in April 1998; he was treated at Swedish Medical Center by physicians from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and died seven months later at age sixty. Legacy Stanford's death was announced on the front page of The Seattle Times, which the newspaper later made available in commemorative poster form. A memorial service held at the University of Washington's Hec Edmundson Pavilion was attended by 2,500; he was buried with military honors at Arlington National Cemetery the next day, in a ceremony attended by Colin Powell and Richard Riley. The Seattle school district headquarters facility, the John Stanford Center for Educational Excellence, was renamed after Stanford, and the Seattle school district's Latona School was renamed John Stanford International School. Following Stanford's death, a Stanford Endowment was established to fund teacher training and leadership programs, receiving an early donation of $2 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Stanford's book, Victory in Our Schools: We Can Give Our Children Excellent Public Education, was published the year after this death. In it, he argues for schools to be run like businesses, based on performance. The foreword of the book was contributed by Al Gore.

Life Kim Jong-gil was born on November 5, 1926 in Andong, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea. and graduated from Korea University with undergraduate and graduate degrees in English Literature. He also conducted research in English Literature at Sheffield University. Kim has worked as a professor at several universities including Chonggu University, Gyeongbuk University and Korea University. He died on April 1, 2017. Work Kim Jong- gil's poetics are exemplified by a concentrated focus on maintaining clarity and lucidity, and by his skillful exploration of the power of the poetic image. The idea of imagery possessed for the poet a near transcendental value, which he believed could enable both poet and reader alike to attain a greater understanding of truth. His poetic methodology can be thus understood only in the context of his attitude towards life which functioned through the medium of clear, concrete images. Kim's work successfully incorporated ideas heralded from Imagism, a modern poetic tradition espoused by poets such as Amy Lowell, HD, and Ezra Pound, and the traditional style of hansi and the spirit of Seonbi. But unlike other imagist poetry of the time, Kim's works exude a classical or traditional elegance, which in turn endows the work with a sense of integrity and completion. This traditional elegance is most visible in the poet's emotional restraint and his detachment from the external world. In addition to this emotional restraint, the poet also focuses on the virtue of decency, as an effective means of conveying sorrow. In “Marking” (Chaejeom), for example, the poet silently marks the paper of a student who has just died, and enters the grade in his report card. This unspoken sorrow and contemplation of death ultimately leads to a more understated and more powerful impact on the reader. Thus the most fundamental and important characteristic of Kim's poetry is in its extensive insight into life and the depth of the mind, through the cultivation of restraint, decency, and imagination. Kim won the 2007 Cheong Ma Literature Award, the 2005 Lee Yuksa Poetry Award, and the 2005 Ko San Literature Award.

He served in the legislature for four consecutive two-year terms since first elected in the 2008 general election and served as Minority Leader from 2014 until 2016. Prior to becoming politically active, Meyer was Director of Emergency Medicine at Providence Medical Center in Portland, Oregon. Early life and education Eric Meyer was born in August, 1961. Meyer attended public schools in Scottsdale, AZ starting at Cocopah Elementary School and graduating high school in 1979 from Chaparral High School,. He earned a bachelor's degree in Economics from the University of Southern California. Discovering his passion for medicine while working at a neighborhood clinic, he returned to Arizona to pursue his medical degree from University of Arizona Medical School. Eric met his wife Sarah Snell while attending medical school and both earned their Medical Doctorates in 1988. During medical school, the couple spent two months working in the field in New Guinea where they witnessed third-world medicine and the violence of tribal warfare first-hand. The two were married shortly after graduation in May 1988. Meyer's post-graduate training was in Emergency Medicine at Oregon Health Sciences University and afterwards practiced as an Emergency Medicine Physician at Providence Medical Center in Portland, Oregon. Meyer's daughter, Sophie, was born in 1994 and his son, Clay, was born in 1996. Snell specializes in Obstetrics and Gynecology at Scottsdale Healthcare Shea Medical Center. His daughter, Sophie Meyer, earned her undergraduate degree in Physics Engineering and is pursuing her master's degree in Material Engineering at Stanford University. His son, Clay Meyer, is studying for his undergraduate degree in Environmental Engineering at Stanford University. Career Meyer served as Director of Emergency Medicine at Providence Medical Center until returning to Arizona in late 1996. Meyer moved back to Arizona where Sarah began practicing medicine at Mayo Clinic. Meyer spent the following year remodeling their newly purchased home in Paradise Valley, AZ and taking care of their two young children. When his daughter Sophie was 3 years old she was enrolled in pre-school at the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Phoenix and Meyer joined the board of the program. When his children entered public school, Meyer joined the board of the Scottsdale Parent Council. Shortly afterwards he began his involvement in legislative politics while serving as Legislative Liaison for the organization. As his kids continued to progress through the Scottsdale, AZ public education system, Meyer continued to scale up his involvement, eventually running for and winning a seat on the Scottsdale School Board in 2004 where he served for eight years. In addition to his work within his children's schools, Meyer served on the Children's Museum of Phoenix Board of Directors, as PTO President for Arcadia Neighborhood Learning Center, and as a member of the Budget Committee for the Scottsdale Unified School District. Meyer ran and won as a write-in candidate during the 2008 Democratic Primary Election for Arizona State Representative in District 11. He went on to win the general election and first assumed office in 2009. Meyer has been an outspoken supporter of restoring public education funds which were severely cut in Arizona following the Great Recession. Re-elected three times since, Meyer was nominated as Democratic Leader by his Caucus in 2014. He has served on Government, Transportation, and Education committees in previous legislative sessions and currently serves on both the Health and Appropriations committees. After reaching his term limit in the Arizona House of Representatives, Meyer announced his run for Arizona State Senate in the 2016 general election on October 6, 2016.  Political statements  = Education = \\"Investing in our kids must be our state’s first priority. Since the beginning of the recession, our state legislature has cut billions from our public schools, resulting in a serious teacher shortage and some of the largest class sizes in the nation. Funding for our state universities has been reduced, resulting in tuition hikes of over 80%, and funding has been eliminated for community colleges in Maricopa and Pima Counties. With two terms on the Scottsdale School Board and my eight years as a State Representative, I have been an effective voice for our children. I will continue to advocate for the restoration of funding for education -- without raising taxes -- and I will continue to work to ensure that more students graduate from high school with access to higher education and quality jobs right here in Arizona.\\" = Economic development = \\"We must continue to diversify our economy. I am an advocate for economic sectors that have sustainable, long-term potential, such as high-tech and biotech businesses. Our universities must remain world-class centers for research that also prepare our students for 21st Century jobs; only with an educated workforce, will companies choose to relocate here. As our economy continues to recover, we must invest in Arizona’s infrastructure, which will help to promote economic development in all parts of our state, and develop innovative job training programs for Arizonans of all ages. I support improved access in our schools and universities to STEM classes in science, technology, engineering, and math, and I support both tax incentives for targeted research and development, and investments in renewable sources of energy.\\" = Healthcare = \\"I am an advocate for quality, affordable healthcare for all Arizonans. As an experienced ER physician and Director of Emergency Medicine I know how to be cost-effective in managing healthcare. As a physician in the Legislature and having served as the ranking member of the Health Committee, I have brought my medical experience to the Capitol. My responsibility in helping to set scope of practice guidelines and making safety decisions that impact healthcare workers across our state is one I have taken very seriously. Arizona is facing a physician shortage in the midst of growing healthcare demands and I will advocate for new policies that will help retain graduate medical professionals in our state. I will also continue to represent your interests on issues as varied as concussion awareness, public health policy, and hospital mergers.\\" = Government transparency = \\"I have introduced legislation the last several sessions that would ban all gifts by lobbyists to Arizona’s elected officials. No more free trips. No more free tickets. No more free lunches. Our votes shouldn’t be for sale. I believe that all politicians should report all political contributions and their sources. I am opposed to so-called \\"dark money.\\" We need transparency in who is donating how much to whose campaign.

In addition to eight original songs, the album features covers of \\"Cailin Deas Crúite na mBó\\" and \\"The Parting Glass\\", two traditional Irish folk songs. The Broken Wave was mixed at Expanding Studios (Benge Studios) in London, UK by Ben Edwards and mastered at Electric Mastering in London, UK by Guy Davie. Critical reception The Broken Wave has generally received positive reviews. Matt Conner of The Line of Best Fit commended the album, stating that \\"the release is best described as a house of cards, maintaining a certain grace and fragility throughout the ten songs present\\" and lauding its \\"authenticity and vulnerability few singers can approach\\". John Eyles of the BBC commented that the album was a \\"distinctive debut album\\" and suggested that the album's main strengths were Peel's use of \\"allusions and metaphors\\", her \\"insights into the break up of relationships [that] displays a maturity rare in a 28-year-old\\", and her voice. Eyles also noted the \\"fragile beauty\\", which \\"ideally conveys the longing and yearning contained within the complex emotions of the songs\\". Ben Hogwood of musicOMH stated that \\"her songs have a fragility that makes them the musical equivalent of frosted glass, beautifully crafted but easily shattered if not handled with due care and attention\\" and characterised that \\"endearing and plaintive\\" Peel's voice as a strength. However, Hogwood also noted that Peel's \\"candidly sing[ing] of falling in and out of love, as well as relatively ordinary day to day events ... occasionally finds her tripping over her own words\\". Will Fitzpatrick of The Fly gave a positive assessment of the album and claimed that Peel \\"wanders into territory reminiscent of Belle & Sebastian's fragile indie pop of yore\\", but distinguished the acts by adding \\"that's far from the sum of The Broken Wave's ambition\\".

After the armistice in 1953, Kim's poems evince a diminished attention to issues pertaining to the war or Korean society in general and a growing interest in describing phenomena, with a focus on visual imagery.Source-attribution\\"Kim Gwangrim\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Following his second collection of poems, Bright Shadow of an Image (Simsangui balgeun geurimja ), published by Joongang Culture Company (Joongang munhwasa) in 1962, Kim's artistic endeavor focused on the conception of a perfect, pure image. Kim thus eliminated all abstraction from his works, and sought an aesthetic that would isolate the image and remove all external semantic associations from it. In the 1970s, Kim's poetry began to incorporate elements of Seon Buddhism, crowning the poet's endeavor to eliminate prosaic elements and abstraction from his poetry and to isolate the bare, unobstructed image. Kim's fixation on realizing the perfect poetic depiction of an image and establishing a profound awareness of this image elevated his work and language to a new, transcendental plane. In fact, underlying his works is the development of a new poetic sensibility vis-a-vis external phenomena, the realization of the lucidity of language, and the creation of poetic expression through the construction of the image. Following the publication of Bird Made of Language (Eoneoro mandeun sae) in 1979, Kim rekindled his efforts to breach the limits of language and to stretch it to its extremes, through radical simplification of language by self-restraint akin to the practices of Seon or Zen Buddhism. Kim is essentially an imagist and his poems often seem like quick glimpses of life in which human concern meets with tight poetic control. While Kim is cognizant of the role of materialism in modern society, his poetry seeks to overcome this with tolerance and forgiveness.

The China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics is also known as the 11th Academy of CASC, or 701st Research Institute. Variants =CH-1= CH-1 is the first of the Rainbow (CH) series UAVs. The general designer was Mr. Shi Wen (石文), who is also the general designer of CH-2, the successor of CH-1, CASC PW-1, the derivative of CH-1, and CASC PW-2, the derivative of CH-2. The CH-1 program began in 2000, and its success resulted in the establishment of the UAV program that led to other designs that followed. The CH-1 is mainly intended for reconnaissance and surveillance missions.

As for the CH-1, propulsion is provided by a two-blade propeller driven by a pusher engine mounted at the rear end of the fuselage, and the UAV is launched via vehicle mounted catapult with rocketed assisted take-off. The CH-2 is mainly intended for reconnaissance and surveillance missions. =CH-3= CH-3 is a fixed wing unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) of the Rainbow series. The CH-3 adopts an unusual canard layout, similar to the Jetcruzer 450 and the Rutan VariEze. This means that the CH-3 lacks centrally located vertical tail, but has large winglets and canards. Propulsion is provided by a three-blade propeller driven by a pusher engine mounted on empennage. The main landing wheels of the tricycle landing gear has fairing to reduce drag. In January, 2015, a CH-3 drone was reported to have crashed in the north of Nigeria. It is believed the drone was involved in Nigeria's struggle against the Islamic militant group, Boko Haram. China supplied the CH-3 to Nigeria government prior to 2014, along with YC-200 guided bombs and AR-1 air-to-ground missile. In February, 2016, Nigeria announced a successful drone strike in its ongoing war against Boko Haram. China delivered 12 CH-3 to Myanmar in 2014-2015 to fight rebels. NESCOM Burraq is thought to be mostly influenced by CH-3. Specification: *Wingspan (m): 8 *Range (km): 960 *Endurance (h): 12 *Payload (kg): 60 – 80 *Ceiling (km): 4 =CH-3A= CH-3A is the development of CH-3 and share the identical layout. Improvement of CH-3A over CH-3 includes that the maximum payload is increased to more than 100 kg, and satellite data link is also incorporated. CH3A is a multipurpose UAV which can also carry AR 1 laser guided rocket for attacking role. It is also widely rumoured that Myanmar Air Force operates them, and some images have been found. Specification: *Payload (kg): 180 maximum *Endurance (h): 6 with maximum payload *Ceiling (Km): 4 *Max Range (km): 960 =CH-4= Externally, CH-4 looks almost identical to General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper, and the only distinct visual difference between two UAVs is that the ventral fin below the V-tail on MQ-9 is absent on CH-4.\\"Red dawn: Communist China stepping up drone deployment,\\"The Washington Times, March 26, 2013 There are two versions, the CH-4A and CH-4B. The CH-4A is a reconnaissance drone (capable of a 3500–5000 km range and a 30- to 40-hour endurance) while the CH-4B is a mixed attack and reconnaissance system with provisions for 6 weapons and a payload of up to 250 to 345 kg. CH-4 is capable of firing air-to-ground missile from altitude of 5,000 meters (~16,400 feet), therefore the aircraft can stay outside of effective range of most anti-aircraft guns. It also allows CH-4 to be able to fire from a position that provides wider viewing area. Vasiliy Kashin, a China specialist at Moscow's Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, said that The CH-4B UCAV has been exported to Pakistan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Iraq. Iraq has received an unknown number of CH-4B in early 2015, spurred on battlefield reversals in Mosul and Ramadi to ISIL. Saqr-1 is thought to be mostly influenced by CH-4. Specification: * Length: * Wing Span: * Max Take Off Weight: * Payload: * Endurance: 40 hours * Powerplant: 1 x 100 Hp engine * Maximum Speed: * Cruise Speed: =CH-5= The CH-5 is the latest UCAV of the Rainbow series, with a wingspan of 21 metres, a payload of 1,000 kg, a maximum takeoff weight of over 3 tonnes, a service ceiling of 9 km, an endurance of up to 60 hours and a range of 10,000 km. Thanks to shared data link it can cooperate with CH-3 and CH-4 drones. It conducted its maiden flight in August 2015 and its first airshow flight (in northern Hebei province) in July 2017. The drone can carry 16 missiles at a single time. There were also plans to extend its range up to 20,000 km. Chinese officials claimed the CH-5 Rainbow was similar in performance to the US MQ-9 Reaper and \\"may come in at less than half the price.\\" Compared to the Garrett TPE331 turboprop engine mounted on the Reaper, CH-5 is equipped with an unidentified turbo-charged piston engine, with less than half the horsepower. This choice limits the maximum altitude of the CH-5 to 9 km compared to the 12–15 km of the Reaper, but it also extends CH-5's endurance to 60 hours compared to 14 hour of the Reaper's. Future blocks of CH-5 will be able to stay in the air for up to 120 hours. =CH-7= The CH-7 is a stealthy flying wing UCAV similar to the X-47B, with a 22m wingspan and 10m length. It can fly at 920 km/h and at an altitude of 13,000m. Endurance is about 15 hours and its operational radius is 2000 kilometers. It can carry antiradiation missiles and standoff weapons. According to its chief designer, \\"the CH-7 can intercept radar electronic signals, and simultaneously detect, verify and monitor high- value targets, such as hostile command stations, missile launch sites and naval vessels\\". It is planned to make its maiden flight in 2019 and commence production in 2022. =CH-10= The CH-10 is a tilt-rotor UAV.China reveals CH-10 tilt-rotor drone =CH-91= CH-91 is a fixed-wing UAV in twin-boom layout with inverted v-tail and a pair of skids as landing gear. Propulsion is provided by a two-blade propeller driven by a pusher engine mounted at the rear end of the fuselage. CH-91 is mainly intended for reconnaissance and surveillance missions. It's also called as BZK-008. =CH-92= CH-92 is a fixed-wing UAV in conventional layout with V-tail and tricycle landing gear. Propulsion is provided by a propeller driven by a pusher engine mounted at the empennage. CH-92 is mainly intended for reconnaissance and surveillance missions. =CH-802= CH-802 is a fixed wing micro air vehicle (MAV) in conventional layout with elevated high-wing configuration and V-tail.

The line was the last major extension of the NZR network; of 14 km from Hawkens Junction to Kawerau and 57 km from Kawerau to Murupara. The portion from Hawkens Junction to Kawerau is now officially part of the East Coast Main Trunk. History The line was started in 1951, but in March 1953 it was decided to build the mill at Kawerau not Murupara, because Kawerau had cheap geothermal steam for energy and also as the climate of Murupara had winter mist and fog so was less suitable for a large town. So the branch ran via Kawerau to Murupara rather than directly from Hawkens Junction near Edgecombe. The Kawerau to Murupara section required major earthworks to limit the ruling grade against loaded log trains to 1 in 60. However the easy grades between Kawerau and the port of Mt Maunganui allow very long trains of over 2,000 tonnes. Work on the section to the mill started on 12 April 1953; the rails reached Kawerau in August and the first train arrived at Kawerau on 26 October, six months after work started. The major earthworks on the Kawerau to Murupara section were completed rapidly with heavy earthmoving machinery, then prefabricated track sections were laid at the rate of 3 km a week. The first logs were loaded at Galatea (48 km from Kawerau and 9 km from Murupara) on 4 April 1955. A regular service to Murupara operated from 15 January 1957, although the line to Kawerau and Murupara was operated by the Ministry of Works (the successor to the PWD or Public Works Department) until 1 July 1957. As the line ran through forest areas, diesel engines only were used on the line. Initially, the DE class were used for construction then for log trains on the still unsettled track bed; this has given the DE class an unofficial status of the first mainline diesel-electric locomotive in NZR service. From October 1963 a pair of DA class diesel locomotives were used, hauling 1,500-tonne log trains. More recently the standard train was a trio of DC class locomotives hauling a gross load of 2,400 tonnes on 53 USL bogie log wagons, with the primary motive power now being a pair of DL class locomotives. The annual tonnage of logs increased from 730,000 tons in 1960 to 1,126,000 tonnes in 1965. After the opening of the Kaimai Tunnel in 1978 the section to Kawerau from Hawkens Junction was formally incorporated into the East Coast Main Trunk designation with the line to Taneatua downgraded to branch status. The section from Kawerau to Murupara became theMurupara Branch, and then the Murupara Line from 2011.

Located near Kaskaskia and Prairie du Rocher in western Randolph County, it lies at the site of an early historic Indian village from the French period. Because it occupies a critical chronological and cultural position, it has been given national recognition as a historic site. Historical events Under René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers were discovered and explored for the first time, and claimed as part of New France. The earliest explorers were soon followed by Catholic Christian missionaries led by Jacques Gravier, who soon won converts among the Illini, and some of these praying Indians founded riverside villages at Cahokia, Kaskaskia, and Peoria.Combined History of Randolph, Monroe, and Perry Counties, Illinois: With Illustrations Descriptive of Their Scenery and Biographical Sketches of Some of Their Prominent Men and Pioneers. Philadelphia: McDonough, 1883. These villages were small by modern standards, although they remained comparable in size to European settlements in the area; according to letters by one missionary written in 1750, three Illini villages in the American Bottom together numbered fewer than eight hundred inhabitants, while the five French villages in the same region comprised eleven hundred Frenchmen and three hundred blacks. Established in 1720, the village at the present Kolmer Site was inhabited by a subgroup of the Illini known also as the Michigamea. Here the flickering light of civilization grew for little more than thirty years before it was unexpectedly snuffed out: in 1752, a confederation of the Fox, Sioux, and Cherokees came up against the village suddenly, and although it had been fortified with a stockade, the inhabitants were unable to hold off the invaders. Many were savagely killed and numerous others captured, and the survivors fled to Kaskaskia. The invaders withdrew, but only after burning the abandoned village; instead of rebuilding their destroyed homes, the Michigamea established a new village nearby at a location known to modern archaeologists as the Waterman Site. French dominion in the American Bottom ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1763, by which all lands east of the Mississippi were ceded to the Kingdom of Great Britain. British dominion, in turn, was ended by the American Revolution: while the French settlers and local Indians were originally favorable toward the British, skillful manoeuvering by George Rogers Clark won the support of both populations for the Americans. The influence of the Catholic faith may have waned by this time, as Clark addressed the inhabitants of Kaskaskia and Cahokia using traditional religious terms instead of Christian words, and by the early nineteenth century Kaskaskia was home to numerous Protestant churches, such as the Episcopalians, the Baptists, and the Reformed Presbyterians. Nevertheless, the Kolmer residents' church endured: the parish of the Immaculate Conception in Kaskaskia survived the great nineteenth- century flood that saw the Mississippi abandon its banks and leave Kaskaskia an island on the western side of the river, and although the village had fallen to a population of fourteen by the time of the 2010 census, Mass is still celebrated at the church weekly.Parish Listing: Immaculate Conception, Diocese of Belleville, 2013. Accessed 2013-11-20. Archaeological significance When the Michigamea lived at the Kolmer Site, it sat on the riverbank along the Mississippi, but subsequent course changes have stranded the site from the river: it now lies a full mile (more than 1.5 km) away from the shoreline, behind the levee system that has been built to keep the river in its banks.DeLorme. Illinois Atlas & Gazetteer. 6th ed. Yarmouth: DeLorme, 2010, 74. . Now used for agricultural purposes, the soil is a mixture of sandy humus and gumbo. The area's original character has been well preserved, due largely to the lack of modern development that it has experienced.Brown, Margaret K. National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: French Colonial Historic District. National Park Service, n.d. Because of the suddenness of the attack that destroyed the village in 1752, the Michigamea are believed to have abandoned most of their possessions, and because they established a new village rather than restoring the old, it is likely that most artifacts that survived the village's burning yet remain in situ. For these reasons, Kolmer is significant for its potential to yield information about the late Illini period, but its importance is greatly expanded because of its inhabitants' relationship with the French. As original artifacts from the site must be dated within a third of a century, comparisons of Kolmer artifacts with artifacts from other French-influenced sites would enable archaeologists to gain a far clearer understanding of previously undated sites, while the significant changes inherent in the transition from a nomadic lifestyle to European-influenced civilization are also likely to appear in the site's artifacts. Finally, as the Kolmer Site was intimately connected to the most prominent French settlements in the upper Mississippi valley, it is a critical component of a region without parallel in the United States for its preservation of colonial France, especially as the larger village of old Kaskaskia has lain under the Mississippi River since its course changed. Historic designation In the spring of 1974, the Kolmer Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in two different ways. It was individually added to the Register in early May, qualifying because of its archaeological significance, while one month previously it had been added as part of a large historic district. This district, the French Colonial Historic District, preserves of land connected to early French settlement in the region, and the Kolmer Site was named one of its most significant contributing properties. Among the other contributing properties are truly ancient sites such as the Modoc Rock Shelter and important French or French-influenced structures such as the Creole House, the Pierre Menard House, Fort de Chartres, and the site of Fort Kaskaskia, as well as the Waterman Site where the Michigamea lived after their first village was razed.

Erker was a Gottscheer, who were ethnic Germans descended from 14th century Tyrolean and Carinthian settlers to the then uninhabited Gottschee region. According to the parish death records, Erker was 28 years old when he died, and lived in Windischdorf #12. It is unknown if he ever served in the Austrian military, however he was almost certainly in the local Landwehr battalions raised by the Austrian government in 1808. During the 1809 campaign, a Gottscheer Battalion was stationed on the Italian front and after Austria's military collapse they returned to their home region. When the French advanced into Carniola and towards Gottschee in July, 900 Gottscheer Landwehr soldiers assembled to resist the advance. They were quickly dispersed by the French columns, however it would be very likely that Johann Erker was one of those men. He may also have played a role in the riots of September 10 in the city square, where the French district commissioner resorted to calling in a battalion to disband the 600 rioters trapping him in the city. On October 7, 1809, Gottscheer and some Slovene people in the border regions south of Gottschee attacked French troops who were in the villages collecting taxes. By the night of October 8, word of this had reached the northern Gottscheer villages such as Windischdorf and Erker assumed command of the local men. Under his command, they joined in the assault on Gottschee City the following morning and attacked the French garrison. Numbering no more than 100 men, the French troops (from Napoleon's Italian regiments) fell back to the castle in the town square and were besieged all morning in the castle. Finally, the Gottscheers broke through the gates, and massacred most of the garrison. Commissioner Gasparini was one of the killed, dragged out through the streets and butchered by the angry rebel mob. After this battle, and during it for that matter, Erker's actions are unknown. From October 9 to October 14, the rebel Gottscheer forces drove French troops out of the Gottschee region and laid siege to the city of Neustadtl to the north. Erker may have led the troops in this siege, or he led the Gottscheer defenses against the French troops as they tried to force their way in at Schweinberg. In Neustadtl, the rebels were driven off thanks to the arrival of reinforcements under General Carlo Zucchi, the bravery and quick thinking of defending commander Captain Luigi Tarducci, and their own ineptitude. At Schweinberg, 100 French soldiers tried to dislodge an unknown number of rebels (though probably not much more than 100) from their formidable defenses. That battle ended after several hours of fighting with the French withdrawal after their commanding officer was cut down by Gottscheer fire. On October 15, Johann Erker was inside the city of Gottschee when the French relief force of 1,000 led by General Zucchi approached from the southeast. After a brief exchange of gunfire, the French troops advanced towards the town as the defense collapsed. Rebels fled the city and its vicinity as Zucchi's troops entered. Some stayed, and surely there was sporadic fighting and prisoners were taken. Erker was arrested here, along with Bartholomäus Kusold, Matthias Stalzer, Georg Eisenzopf, Johann Jonke, and many other Gottscheer rebels. The five named men were indicated as rebel leaders. After three days of looting the city, Zucchi ordered the leaders executed. On the morning of October 18, 1809, a nine-man firing squad was organized facing the side of the parish church dedicated to St. Bartholomew, and one by one the rebel leaders were led out to die. Their order of death is not known, but regardless of the order Johann Erker of Windischdorf was killed on that morning against the wall of the parish church. 1773 births 1809 deaths People executed by the First French Empire ","title":"Johann Erker"},{"id":"41146091","text":"Sandra D.

Early work in the field began in the late 1800s, but became an academic discipline in the early 1900s with the work of Ellwood Patterson Cubberley and Paul Monroe. Teachers in training were then taught the institutional history of American public school education, particularly as \\"an inevitable outcome of consensus forged by a democratic society\\". In 1948, the National Society of College Teachers of Education began a History of Education Section. The Section published the History of Education Journal. Scholars argued over the field's aims throughout the 1950s. The Ford Foundation formed a Committee on the Role of Education in American History in 1957 to create a history of education from a history of public schools, an effort to make the field more scholarly. The History of Education Society was founded as an independent organization in 1960, succeeding the Section. With its creation came legitimacy for the field as academic study. The society was influenced by revisionism in the 1970s, which encouraged its historians to debate American public education's societal and individual roles in the society's journal and annual meetings. Towards the end of the century, the education history field grew to include histories of the family, media, religion, race, ethnicity, class, gender, and educational opportunity.MacDonald, Victoria-Maria, \\"History of Education\\".

Anil Kapoor took 15 days to complete his work while Manoj Bajpayee finished the dubbing for his character in just four days in Future Works Studio in Andheri, Mumbai. The trailer of the film was unveiled on 16 November 2013. Besides the launch of the trailer there were three audiovisuals that introduced the animated characters of Balan, Kapoor and Devgn. Jackie Shroff lent his voice for Duryodhan. Lord Krishna's voice is dubbed by Shatrughan Sinha. None of the A-listers charged any remuneration for lending their voices to the characters in the film. Film producers gave Shatrughan Sinha an option to choose any of the roles to lend his voice to. Sinha selected the role of Krishna. Mahabharat has an insurance cover of Rs 50 crore,thus becoming the highest insured Bollywood production film, beating My Name Is Khan (2010), which was insured for Rs 46 crore.

Subhash K. Jha said, \\"If you were hoping that animation films would come of age with this purported epic, you are in for a disappointment. Though the characters from the Mahabharat have faces and voices of the biggest stars, the images do not add up to a compelling canvas. Not by a wide margin.\\" India TV said, \\"The presentation is epic in intent, yes. Alas, the execution, packaging and projection leave the epic undernourished and over-emphasized.\\" and rated it 2 out of 5 stars. Meena Iyer of The Times of India rated it three and half out of five, saying \\"Amitabh Bachchan's bartitone is used for the stellar Bheeshma Pitamah. Although the Big B doesn't have muscular arms like his animated counterpart, their faces match. A superlative list of actors like Sunny Deol (Bheem), Ajay Devgn (Arjun), Anil Kapoor (Karan), Jackie Shroff (Duryodhan), Manoj Bajpayee (Yudhisthir), Anupam Kher (Shakuni) and Vidya Balan (Draupadi) have also infused life into the computer generated characters with their inimitable voices.\\" and concluded, \\"On the flip side, the animation effort itself is immature and several notches below those of Hollywood films. Yet the dub effort by the Bollywood superstars uplifts this epic, making it enjoyable.\\" Deepanjana Pal of Firstpost said, \\"The artwork in Mahabharat is appalling and the animation is worse. From the movements of the characters to the visual effects - like two arrows going at each other - it looks like a pirated and outdated version of MS Paint was used to create the film.\\" and added, \\"The movements of the characters are awkward and jerky, making it look like the mythical heroes learned how to walk from Godzilla. The battle scenes are not only badly drawn and animated, they're also boring.\\" and concluded, \\"This new Mahabharata isn't so much a kid-friendly version as one made for dummies, by dummies.\\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama rated the film 3 out of 5 stars, saying \\"The USP of Mahabharat is that the characters in the film bear a strong resemblance to the actors lending them their voices. The film should work for two more reasons: the riveting story and the superior quality animation [a handful of scenes notwithstanding]. Besides, minute detailing has gone into the costumes, effects and the overall look.\\" and concluded, \\"The one flaw that stands out is the lip sync of the characters with the voiceovers, which seems to go out of place in a few sequences.\\".

Kim's sobriquet was Chojeong. During his life, Kim was repeatedly imprisoned for spreading anti-Japanese sentiments. In 1938, along with Kim Yongho and Ham Yunsu, Kim participated in the literary group that produced the magazine 'Barley', in which Kim published the poems \\"A Grain of Sand” (Moraeal) and \\"The Tea Room” (Dabang) in 1938. Following Korean Liberation, Kim taught at Masan High School, Busan Girls' High School, and Gyeongnam Girls' High School. He founded the Tongyeong Writers' Association in 1956. Work Kim began his literary career as a writer of sijo but eventually expanded his range to include free verse during the post-Liberation period. Kim's early work is marked by the contemplative attitude the poet assumes towards the world. Rather than attempting to affect change, early poems such as \\"Baekjabu\\" and \\"The Onset of Winter” (Ipdong) serve as passive reflections on the world. Kim's poetic world is also one of traditional lyricism, of moonlight, calabash flowers and pigtail ribbons, in which the poet seeks to overcome the violence of the past with the silence welling up within his breast. Grounding his sijo in this traditional lyricism, Kim makes use of lucid, subtle language to express his desire to liberate the forces of life lying behind external phenomena. For this reason some critics say that Kim has successfully fused the abstract quality of Lee Eunsang’s work with the fresh, vibrant sensibility found in Lee Byeonggi’s poetry. In 1963, Kim began to attempt the modernization of the sijo form in his own work, emphasizing the composition of both a three-line and three-stanza sijo.Source-attribution\\"Kim Sang-ok\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# In 1995, Kim won three awards: the Jungang Sijo Award, the Nosan Literary Prize and the 보관문화훈장 award.

The film had its world premiere at the Virginia Film Festival on November 6, 2014. The film was released on October 9, 2015, by Picturehouse. The film was released in Blu-Ray by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment on February 2, 2016. Plot In 1978, 40-year-old independent woman Ave Maria Mulligan owns her dead father's pharmacy in her hometown of Big Stone Gap, Virginia. Ave's mother, an immigrant from Italy, is the town seamstress. Ave is heavily involved in her community, home delivering medications to the country folk, volunteering on the coal mining town's Emergency Response Team, and directing the town's annual production of \\"Trail of the Lonesome Pine\\", based on the novel by John Fox, Jr. Ave delivers medications to Nan McChesney and is pleased to see Nan's son Jack, a local coal miner and a former schoolmate. Jack tries to make small talk, but Ave leaves when Nan tells her that 40 is not too old to still have children. Spec Broadwater, the town's lawyer and Ave's friend, brings news that her momma has died. At the graveside Fleeta Mullins, Ave's outspoken friend and pharmacy worker, chastises Ave for placing a rose on her father's grave, remarking how badly he had treated Ave. Ave is shocked when her momma's will has a photo of her real father, who still lives in Italy. Her momma fled to America when she became pregnant. She met and married Fred Mulligan, who knew she was pregnant and never much liked Ave. At the pharmacy, some popular teenage girl customers direct rude comments at Pearl Grimes, a poor teenager who is a Melungeon. Ave embarrasses the brats then offers Pearl a job at the pharmacy. During the cast after-party for “Lonesome Pine”, it is announced that senatorial hopeful John Warner will make a campaign stop in town with his wife, Elizabeth Taylor, and Theodore will plan the event. He's so happy he kisses Ave in front of everyone then leads her away. They spend an awkward night together, with a stilted goodbye the next morning. Ave helps deal with an explosion at the mine, worrying about Jack until finding him safe at the hospital. He accepts her offer of a lift home but Sweet Sue arrives and jumps into his arms, shrugging off Ave. Ave stumbles across old love letters between her momma and her real father, causing Ave's best friend, town librarian and local romantic Iva Lou, to confront her about non-existent love life. Meanwhile, Jack's mother confronts him about Sweet Sue, whom she dislikes. Jack admits he wants the love that his parents had, does not love Sue but does care for her two young boys. Jack finally approaches Ave. They take an evening walk and he tells her that he broke up with Sue, as he has always had a crush on the little Italian girl that sat beside him in elementary school. He tells her that they ought to get married. Ave storms off, offended that he doesn't even think she's worth being courted. The day of the John Warner Campaign visit turns into chaos. Ms. Taylor chokes on a chicken bone while Ave learns that Jack got engaged to Sweet Sue. When Ave gets home from the campaign disaster, her father's sister (Aunt Alice) is waiting, calling Ave a bastard and announcing she is taking Ave to court for the house and the pharmacy. Theodore tells Ave that he's been offered the band director's job at University of Tennessee and they should break up for multiple reasons. Ave quietly includes the fact that he likes men, to which he agrees. Jack's mom confronts Ave, desperate for her help because Sweet Sue is planning on marrying Jack within weeks. Ave collapses, suffering a nervous breakdown. Ave sleeps for days. In an act of desperation, Iva Lou has Pearl confront Jack, asking him to help bring Ave out of her sleep, telling him they are meant for each other. Late that night, Jack sneaks in and checks on Ave. He takes one of Ave's father's letters, kisses her on the forehead and leaves. When Ave finally awakes, she announces that she saw her father in her dreams and she's got to go find him. Spec advises her to take everything out of her name so no one can take it away while she's gone. Ave surprises Pearl and her mother, Leah Grimes, by selling Pearl the pharmacy for a dollar. Ave then gives Fleeta a huge raise, telling her how important she is to her and how important she will be in teaching Pearl to run the pharmacy. Iva Lou announces that she is marrying her boyfriend, Lyle, and asks Ave to be her Maid of Honor. The couple are so drunk at the altar that Ave and Jack have to hold them up while the preacher quickly pronounces them married. Aunt Alice and Uncle Wayne barge into the reception, furious about the pharmacy and stating that Ave won't be giving away the family home. Ave then announces that she's giving Pearl the house too, which leads to Aunt Alice yelling racist comments about Pearl. The crowd chases Aunt Alice away, chimes in their dislike of her, many mentioning their own Melungeon blood. Ave learns from Sweet Sue that she has reconciled with her husband during Ave's \\"mental collapse.\\" Jack gives Ave a book about the town in the Italian Alps where her father lives. Ave leaves her Cadillac in Aunt Alice's front yard, with a note and the keys. Ave's last day in Big Stone Gap, Theodore takes her to the Outdoor Theater, where all her friends are gathered on stage. They surprise her with her poppa from Italy and then her momma's sister, Maria. Her poppa explains that Jack found them and paid for their flights, having sold his truck. Theodore has the theater choir sing a song with Aunt Maria, while Jack's voiceover explains that he and Ave married and had two children.

Marks and members of her extended family operated multiple storefront businesses, four in Broward County, Florida one of which was in Fort Lauderdale, named \\"Astrology Life\\" and one in Manhattan on W. 58th Street near Central Park. They told vulnerable clients that the only solution to their problems was to give the purported psychics money. Prior to this case there was doubt that a psychic could be criminally charged. Jurors were told that fortune-telling is constitutionally protected free speech, but federal prosecutors contended Marks engaged in fraud by promising to keep clients money safe, \\"cleanse\\" it and return it when she had no intention of returning it. The case drew widespread coverage. Charles Stack, a retired Fort Lauderdale police detective, said the case and the ensuing publicity brought attention to predatory and fraudulent fortune tellers. The family amassed a fortune estimated at between $25 and $40 million. Defense attorney Fred Schwartz said the federal government seized Marks' family assets including cars, motorcycles, a boat, gold, jewelry and a home near the Intracoastal Waterway. In 2014, Marks was sentenced over 10 years in prison for defrauding clients of her family's fortune-telling businesses out of more than $17.8 million. Family background According to Paula McMahon, staff writer for the Sun-Sentinel newspaper, the family are Vlax Roma, the largest Gypsy group in the US. McMahon states members of this group \\"traditionally drop out of school when they are 8 or 9 years old\\" and that \\"Mothers train daughters to develop what they call 'psychic' or 'intuitive' powers.\\" This training was presented by both prosecutors and the defense during Rose Marks' trial. Schwarz said Marks began working at the age of 8 or 9. The Marks family immigrated from Greece in the late 19th or early 20th century. Although adhering to Romani cultures and beliefs, like the payment of dowries and arranged marriages, they also worked to assimilate into American life. In an interview with McMahon, Rose Marks said her father was Steve \\"Boyo\\" Eli, a land owner and Romani judge. According to Marks, he mediated land, inheritance, divorce and dowry disputes in the Gypsy community near Newark, New Jersey. Marks attended public school until she dropped out in the third grade. She was married in an arranged marriage at 16 or 17 years old, living in Virginia until moving to Broward County in 1998. Marks and her late husband opened the store in Manhattan. The family was identified as relatives of the late Gypsy leader, Jimmy Marks of Spokane, Washington by the New York Daily News. Criminal proceedings Stack began an investigation into Rose Marks and family in 2007 before retiring from the Fort Lauderdale Police Department. A subsequent federal investigation, \\"Operation Crystal Ball\\", resulted in a sixty-one-count indictment, unsealed on August 16, 2011, charging Marks and eight family members with crimes spanning twenty years. On September 8, 2013, Marks was convicted of all fourteen federal crimes she had been charged with. The charges were one count of conspiracy to commit mail/wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, two counts of mail fraud, two counts of money laundering, six counts of wire fraud and two counts of filing false income returns. Schwartz said she will appeal on several grounds, including \\"government misconduct\\" by investigators who failed to record interviews with victims. US magistrate judge James Hopkins had previously criticized the government's conduct but felt it did not meet criteria for dismissal of the case. Mistakes initially made in presenting the case to the grand jury were serious enough to require presentation to a second grand jury. In an unusual ruling, Hopkins ordered that portions of the transcript of the grand jury testimony, normally secret, be made available to the defense. Among the concerns raised were the use of the term \\"gypsy\\" as an ethnic stereotype and the inclusion of victims who had not been interviewed including one who insisted he had never been victimized. The indictment handed down was the fourth version. Eight family members had previously pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit wire/mail fraud, they were: Marks's daughter (Rosie Marks), son-in-law (Donnie Eli), her two sons and their wives (Michael Marks & Cynthia Miller and Ricky Marks & Nancy Marks), her sister (Victoria Eli), and granddaughter (Vivian Marks). Before the pleas were entered, defense attorney for Nancy Marks, Michael Gottlieb, filed a 24-page request for dismissal on the grounds of freedom of religion portraying the family's actions as based on their religious beliefs and a belief in spiritual healing. Attorneys for Rose Marks and other family members joined the request. Defense lawyers contended that the prosecution of the family was the most recent example of long-running persecution of the Romani people rooted in a lack of understanding of their culture and bias against them. Vivian Marks was sentenced to four months each in prison and of house arrest followed by three years' probation on October 7, 2013. The same day, Michael Marks and Ricky Marks were sentenced to six months' house arrest followed by two years' probation and eight months' house arrest followed by two years' probation, respectively. Rose Marks was sentenced to just over ten years in federal prison on March 3, 2014 for defrauding clients of her family's fortune-telling businesses out of more than $17.8 million. She was convicted of scamming numerous clients, including best-selling romance novelist Jude Deveraux, who was a client since 1991. Victims testified that she convinced them she could swap people's souls between bodies, prevent a woman from conceiving via in vitro fertilization and even use her psychic powers to prevent the Internal Revenue Service from going after them for taxes. Details of the crime According to the indictment, there were numerous victims of the Marks family's psychic ruse through the use of \\"various magicians tricks\\" creating an impression of genuine psychic ability. The family claimed to communicate directly with Michael the Archangel. The women of the family, including Rose Marks, sometimes used the alias Joyce Michael(s). Many of the victims had suffered a traumatic loss. Two victims identified by The Palm Beach Post, author Jude Deveraux and another woman were defrauded of $20 million and $1 million, respectively. Deveraux believed the money would be returned after it was \\"cleansed\\". The single victim of Vivian Marks identified by the Sun-Sentinel was defrauded of $180,000 which he was told would go to charity work in Africa. Another victim was told that her money had burned in the September 11 attacks. A victim who had been hearing voices in his head was told by Cynthia Miller that she would speak with Michael the Archangel who she said told her the victim needed to sacrifice gold coins. This victim turned $400,000 in gold coins over to Miller. A family curse that could be cured only by the \\"cleansing\\" of money and valuables was a scenario frequently employed by the Marks family. Victims included a female US Naval Academy graduate, an English attorney and other highly educated men and women with executive positions. Michael Vasquez wrote in the Miami Herald that the indictment included the following examples of the methods used by Marks and her family: * Marks told one client she had a \\"gift from God\\" and would provide him divinely inspired direction if he gave her money as a sacrifice that Marks would pray over and later return. * Nancy Marks told a woman she had been cursed in a prior life and to get rid of the curse a temporary sacrifice of money was needed which would be returned three times over after being set aside for a curse-killing prayer. * After making a deposit on an expensive watch, Nancy Marks had a client pay off the balance promising to return it after using it to \\"turn back time and bring love back\\" to the client. The client received only the empty box.

It was designed by It was maintained by the Adam Mickiewicz Institute. It was vandalized several times, generating significant media coverage in Polish media, usually in the context of LGBT rights in Poland. The construction was permanently removed in August 2015. History This installation is the third in a series of similar installations created; the second one was featured in front of the European Parliament in Brussels from 8 September 2011 during the Polish presidency of the European Union. The Warsaw Tęcza was based on the Brussels one, which was moved to Warsaw on 8 June 2012. For this project, Wójcik received the Paszport Polityki award. The installation was supposed to evoke positive feelings related to the rainbow, such as love, peace and hope, and was intended to be a universal, apolitical symbol. However, far-right nationalist and Catholic groups identified it with the rainbow flag, a symbol of the LGBT movement. During the night of 26–27 August 2015, the construction for holding flowers was officially and permanently dismantled. Three years later, on 9 June 2018, a new water and light-based installation was unveiled, but it was active only for a few hours for the 2018 Parada Równości event. Vandalism and controversies As the rainbow symbol is also associated with the LGBT movement, locating because it contains 6 colors just like the LGBT flag, and the Tęcza in the Savior Square in Warsaw proved controversial (because it was placed in front of the church). The installation was damaged five times as of November 2013, with the usual method of vandalism being arson. The installation was damaged on 13 September 2012; on 1 January 2013 (ruled to be accidental fireworks damage) and again three days later on 4 January; in July 2013; and once again during marches on Polish Independence Day on 11 November 2013. The November 2013 incident occurred in the background of a wider riot by right-wing nationalists, who clashed with police and vandalized other parts of the city as well, also attacking the Russian embassy. On 7 December 2014, the rainbow was set on fire by an unknown man just before 01:30. The flames were put out quickly by a police officer. The man who lit the fire was not apprehended. The installation was criticized by conservative and right-wing figures. Law and Justice politician Bartosz Kownacki derogatorily called the installation a \\"faggot rainbow\\" (pedalska tęcza). Another Law and Justice politician, Stanisław Pięta, complained that the \\"hideous rainbow had hurt the feelings of believers\\" attending the nearby Church of the Holiest Saviour.

This was a point lost on many > of the men working across Washington's foreign policy establishment, but > over the years I came to view it as one of the most compelling arguments for > why standing up for women and girls was not just the right thing to do but > also smart and strategic ... the correlation was undeniable, and a growing > body of research showed that improving conditions for women helped resolve > conflicts and stabilize societies. \\"Women's issues\\" had long been relegated > to the margins of U.S. foreign policy and international diplomacy, > considered at best a nice thing to work on but hardly a necessity. I became > convinced that, in fact, this was a cause that cut to the heart of our > national security.Clinton, Hard Choices, p. 562. History and analysis The roots of the doctrine begin with the lineage of Clinton's political career from standing in the shadow of her husband, President Bill Clinton, as First Lady, to being put in the public spotlight in her own right during a speech she gave at the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995 in Beijing. In this speech, Clinton made the proclamation that, \\"if there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all.\\" This statement was a pivotal moment and starting point in the formation of what subsequently became known as the Hillary Doctrine.Hudson and Leidl, The Hillary Doctrine, pp. 7–9. Another important early marker was the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 and the National Action Plans that came out of it. Also published in Newsweek as \\"Did Hillary Implement a Women's-Issues Foreign Policy?\\", June 26, 2015. And during her U.S. Senate confirmation hearings to become Secretary of State, Clinton stated: \\"I want to pledge to you that as secretary of state I view [women's] issues as central to our foreign policy, not as adjunct or auxiliary or in any way lesser than all of the other issues that we have to confront.\\" The explicit notion of such a thing was first introduced by a Newsweek article entitled \\"The Hillary Doctrine\\" and published in March 2011 by journalist Gayle Tzemach Lemmon. In it, Clinton is quoted as saying that she believes \\"that the rights of women and girls is the unfinished business of the 21st century.\\" To strengthen her argument for women's rights, Clinton situates this issue within the context of national security, in that, \\"where women are disempowered and dehumanized, you are more likely to see not just antidemocratic forces, but extremism that leads to security challenges.\\" In another article by Lemmon, published in The Atlantic in April 2013, the Hillary Doctrine is again elucidated. Lemmon cites a speech given by Clinton to the Women in the World Summit soon after leaving the State Department in which she reflects upon the case she made for women's rights in the past and argues that \\"too many otherwise thoughtful people continue to see the fortunes of women and girls as somehow separate from society at large.\\" Further, Clinton explains how extremists rely upon this ignorance to keep women from being liberated, and, with that, also bar entire societies from liberation. However, rather than speaking in purely abstract terms of \\"extremists\\" and \\"societies\\", Clinton concretely identifies some countries that she wants to see treat their women better, namely: Egypt, Pakistan, India, and at a different level, the United States itself. To conclude, Lemmon speculates whether the Hillary Doctrine will be transformed into a political platform upon which Clinton can run for President in 2015. However, regardless of speculation on Clinton's actions in the future, for now, the Hillary Doctrine stands as an important contribution to national security discussions around the world. In their 2015 book The Hillary Doctrine: Sex and American Foreign Policy, Texas A&M; University professor Valerie M. Hudson and former World Health Organization manager and consultant Patricia Leidl examine the Hillary Doctrine at length, beginning with its premise. At first, the notion was considered counter-intuitive and sometimes received cursory dismissal within academic circles. But Hudson surveys research that she and others have done, in part using the WomanStats Project database, on the link between violence against women and gender inequality within a state and the level of national security and stability of that state.Hudson and Leidl, The Hillary Doctrine, pp. 69–73. They summarize one set of findings by saying: \\"What the research team found was that the best predictor of a state's peacefulness was not level of democracy, or wealth, or civilizational identity: The best predictor of a state's peacefulness was its level of violence against women. These findings cut across wealth, regime type, and region.\\" Several case studies are described that investigate causation, such as looking sex-selective abortion and female infanticide in Asia, rape during the Congo civil wars, the fate of women in the Arab Spring, and at greatest length, ongoing violence against women in Guatemala.Hudson and Leidl, The Hillary Doctrine, pp. 73–144. Hudson and Leidl then look at the foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration and Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State to see whether their actions reflected commitment to the Hillary Doctrine. In many cases, they found that it did, such as appointing many women to positions of power, increasing funding for the Office of Global Women's Issues by a factor of ten, heavy use of social media, and Clinton's local visits to women's groups.Hudson and Leidl, The Hillary Doctrine, pp. 51–52. Indeed, Clinton made the empowerment of women worldwide the signature issue of her time as Secretary of State. But they also note a number of occasions where Clinton and the administration were silent about abuses of women or girls due to strategic needs of the U.S., most of all in the \\"conspicuous silence\\" about Saudi Arabia's treatment of its female population. Finally, they look at implementation, and find that during the period in question much was done to implement the Hillary Doctrine in Washington by means of setting up a regulatory and legal framework for it, but that there was a more mixed record past that point, with omissions and weaknesses occurring in the program development, contracting, and local implementation phases.Hudson and Leidl, The Hillary Doctrine, p. 183. Critiques of the doctrine have suggested that it embodies \\"imperial feminism\\", the promotion of feminist values in order to justify militarism and a modern-day U.S. empire.Hudson and Leidl, The Hillary Doctrine, pp. 33, 60–62. Another line of concern is that U.S. actions put women at risk over time, with particular attention to those who were encouraged to take a more prominent role in pushing for women's rights in Afghanistan and anxiety for their safety following the planned withdrawal of U.S. forces from that country. Indeed, Hudson and Leidl consider the condition of Afghan women to be a litmus test for whether the Hillary Doctrine can achieve realization.Hudson and Leidl, The Hillary Doctrine, p. 234. Other theories to explain the root causes of conflict and international instability also exist, such as the Clash of Civilizations hypothesis, democratic peace theory, and an emphasis on environmental poverty and scarcity. Other formulations Several other definitions of what a \\"Hillary Doctrine\\" might be have appeared in print. Another article titled \\"The Hillary Doctrine\\", published in The Atlantic in January 2013 by journalist David Rohde, talks about the terms of exchanges between Clinton and other American politicians within discussions of dilemmas concerning the United States and certain African countries. This time, Clinton explicitly called out actions taken by the United States abroad, and argued that, contrary to popular belief, \\"a lot of the challenges we face are not immediately – or sustainably – solved by military action alone.\\" Further, while the aforementioned doctrine focuses on populations, such as women and children, that are typically ignored within discussions of national security, Clinton also makes an effort to push for including places that have historically been ignored within national security discussions, as well. However, Rohde never mentions the phrase \\"Hillary Doctrine\\" in the piece, and it could have been the creation of the magazine's headline writer. In April 2015, James M. Goldgeier, political scientist and dean of the School of International Service at American University, wrote an article titled \\"The Hillary Clinton Doctrine\\" (the only place in the article that mentions \\"doctrine\\") for The National Interest. However, the article mostly analyzes foreign policy trends of the last several U.S. administrations and makes suggestions for what a Hillary Clinton foreign policy should be while emphasizing the limitations and difficulties of possible courses of action. No explicit mention of a \\"Hillary Doctrine\\" by name has been made by Clinton herself. Moreover, in Hard Choices, she stated that there was no unified \\"Obama Doctrine\\" during her tenure either, saying the range of problems the country faced did not allow for a \\"simple and elegant road map\\" to deal with them.Clinton, Hard Choices, p. 30. However, in an August 2014 interview with journalist Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic, Clinton seems to yearn for such an approach in dealing with jihadism that was comparable to the containment strategy the U.S. used against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. She made reference to a much-quoted simple dictum of Obama's by saying, \\"Great nations need organizing principles, and 'Don't do stupid stuff' is not an organizing principle.\\" Analyzing this interview, in August 2014, journalist John Cassidy wrote an article called \\"The Hillary Doctrine: 'Smart Power' or 'Back to the Crusades'?\\" in The New Yorker that stated that Clinton was advocating \\"a sustained global campaign targeting radical Islam (some, doubtless, will call it a 'crusade') that encompasses all of the options at the disposal of the United States and its allies: military, diplomatic, economic, political, and rhetorical.\\" But again, the phrase \\"Hillary Doctrine\\" is only in the piece's headline.

Background Georg Friedrich Knapp, a German economist, invented the term \\"chartalism\\" in his State Theory of Money, which was published in German in 1905 and translated into English in 1924. The name derives from the Latin charta, in the sense of a token or ticket. Knapp argued that \\"money is a creature of law\\" rather than a commodity. Knapp contrasted his state theory of money with \\"metallism\\", as embodied at the time in the gold standard, where the value of a unit of currency depended on the quantity of precious metal it contained or could be exchanged for. He argued the state could create pure paper money and make it exchangeable by recognising it as legal tender, with the criterion for the money of a state being \\"that which is accepted at the public pay offices\\". Constantina Katsari has argued that principles from both metallism and chartalism were reflected in the monetary system introduced by Augustus, which was used in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire, from the early 1st century to the late 3rd century AD. When Knapp was writing, the prevailing view of money was that it had evolved from systems of barter to become a medium of exchange because it represented a durable commodity which had some use value. However, as modern chartalist economists such as Randall Wray and Mathew Forstater have pointed out, chartalist insights into tax- driven paper money can be found in the earlier writings of many classical economists, for instance Adam Smith, who observed in The Wealth of Nations: Forstater also finds support for the concept of tax-driven money, under certain institutional conditions, in the work of Jean-Baptiste Say, J.S. Mill, Karl Marx and William Stanley Jevons. Alfred Mitchell-Innes, writing in 1914, argued that money existed not as a medium of exchange but as a standard of deferred payment, with government money being debt the government could reclaim by taxation. Innes argued: Knapp and \\"Chartalism\\" were referenced by John Maynard Keynes in the opening pages of his 1930 Treatise on Money Keynes, John Maynard: A Treatise on Money, 1930, pp. 4, 6 and appear to have influenced Keynesian ideas on the role of the state in the economy. By 1947, when Abba Lerner wrote his article \\"Money as a Creature of the State\\", economists had largely abandoned the idea that the value of money was closely linked to gold. Lerner argued that responsibility for avoiding inflation and depressions lay with the state because of its ability to create or tax away money. Modern proponents Economists Warren Mosler, L. Randall Wray, Stephanie Kelton, and Bill Mitchell are largely responsible for reviving chartalism as an explanation of money creation; Wray refers to this revived formulation as Neo-Chartalism.The Economist, 31 December 2011, \\"Marginal revolutionaries\\" neo-chartalism, sometimes called “Modern Monetary Theory” Mitchell, founder of the Centre of Full Employment and Equity or CofFEE at the University of Newcastle in Australia, coined the term Modern Monetary Theory to describe modern Neo-Chartalism, and that term is now widely used. Scott Fullwiler has added detailed technical analysis of the banking and monetary systems.https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=444041 Rodger Malcolm Mitchell's book Free MoneyMitchell, Rodger Malcolm: Free Money - Plan for Prosperity, PGM International, Inc., paperback 2005, describes in layman's terms the essence of chartalism. Some contemporary proponents, such as Wray, situate chartalism within post-Keynesian economics, while chartalism has been proposed as an alternative or complementary theory to monetary circuit theory, both being forms of endogenous money, i.e., money created within the economy, as by government deficit spending or bank lending, rather than from outside, as by gold. In the complementary view, chartalism explains the \\"vertical\\" (government-to-private and vice versa) interactions, while circuit theory is a model of the \\"horizontal\\" (private-to-private) interactions.\\"Deficit Spending 101 - Part 3\\" Bill Mitchell, 2 March 2009\\"In the spirit of debate...my reply\\" Bill Mitchell, 28 September 2009 Hyman Minsky seemed to incorporate a Chartalist approach to money creation in his Stabilizing an Unstable Economy,Minsky, Hyman: Stabilizing an Unstable Economy, McGraw-Hill, 2008, while Basil Moore, in his book Horizontalists and Verticalists,Moore, Basil J.: Horizontalists and Verticalists: The Macroeconomics of Credit Money, Cambridge University Press, 1988, delineates the differences between bank money and state money. James K. Galbraith supports chartalism and wrote the foreword for Mosler's book Seven Deadly Innocent Frauds of Economic Policy in 2010.Mosler, Warren: Seven Deadly Innocent Frauds of Economic Policy, Valance Co., 2010, ; also available in .DOC  Criticism  The continued use of the Somali shilling as currency despite the lack of a functioning central government capable of raising taxes or a central bank to issue it has been cited as a counterargument to Chartalism. Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency not originated by a state, has also been cited as a counterexample.

The project was launched on January 2013 by the founder Jin-Woo Yu. The stated mission is to \\"allow students in South Korea to easily learn and study the lectures on their website. The courses on the site includes videos translated from Khan Academy as well as those originally created by students. The subjects include: Calculus, Western Philosophy, Problems in Economics, and neuroscience. The total number of views is estimated to be about 26,300. History One of the founders, Jin-Woo Yu, was inspired by a news article which introduced Khan Academy. He stated that the concept of Openowledge was created from a desire to create a translated and better-organized site. Another member stated that the concept of Korean subtitles arose from her own experience with Khan Academy. In 2012, Jin-Woo Yu and Myung-Gun Seo created the organization Khan Academy Korea. Khan Academy Korea had a project to translate Khan Academy videos. The project was extended into the current Openowledge project. The first rough form of the organization began on the beginning of 2013 with founder Yu Jin-Woo and two others. At least one advertisement appeared on November 22, 2013. On January 2013,'Openowledge' was first created as a high school club. The founders only consisted of second-year high school students in CheongShim International Academy. The current site began operating on May 2013 as a beta version for about a month. Openowledge started operating as an actual service on July 16, 2013. Openowledge has since registered as an official organization. It is now classified as an educational, nonprofit organization. It is also classified as an official volunteering organization. Organization Openowledge is maintained by eight CheongShim International Academy students. Openowledge is divided into three parts: The 'share- knowledge' project, the 'foreign language content translation project' and the 'CheongShim Opencourseware (OCW).' The share-knowledge project consists of videos created by CheongShim International Academy high-school students. The subjects include: Calculus, Western Philosophy, Problems in Economics, and neuroscience. The lecturers include a participant in the International Philosophy Olympiad and other students considered 'great lecturers.' The contents are shown for free on the website. As of August 2013, 32 original videos are available on the website. The foreign language content translation project consists of videos translated from Khan Academy and MIT+K12. Translators ranges from elementary school students to college students and employed adults. As of November 2013, there are about 40 translators in total. Members estimate that the translation time for one video is about two hours. There are special translation teams such as 'ACG Translation Team' which translates the videos. Currently, a translation team consists of two or three members. The videos are shown free on the website. As of August 2013, there were about 35 translated lectures on the website. The CheongShim Opencourseware consists of original lectures produced by CheongShim International Academy teachers. The videos are uploaded for free on the website and on YouTube. Future Plans The founder Yu, Jin-Woo have stated that he hopes to have a total of 500 lecturers and 800 lectures by 2015 and have Openowledge named as the 'most diverse knowledge-sharing platform in the Republic of Korea.'

The x and y coordinates can be entered as equations in t, e.g. ‘x = sin(t)’, ‘y = cos(t)’, or as functions, e.g. ‘f_x(s) = sin(s)’, ‘f_y(s) = cos(s)’. * Polar plots are also similar to Cartesian plots. They can be entered either as an equation in j, e.g. ‘r = j’, or as a function, e.g. ‘f(x) = x’. * For implicit plots, the name of the function is entered separately from the expression relating the x and y coordinates. If the x and y variables are specified via the function name (by entering e.g. ‘f(a,b)’ as the function name), then these variables will be used. Otherwise, the letters x and y will be used for the variables. * Explicit differential plots are differential equations whereby the highest derivative is given in terms of the lower derivatives. Differentiation is denoted by a prime (’). In function form, the equation will look like ‘f”(x) = f’f’. In equation form, it will look like ‘y” = y’ y’.

The film is a remake of 1977 Pakistani movie Salaakhein starring Mohammad Ali Babra Shariff. It was the 14th highest-grossing film of the year 1991. Plot Widower Jeevanlal lives with his 5-year-old daughter in a small house. One day he meets with an accident and is unable to return home as he is admitted to the hospital. Meanwhile, due to heavy rains, an ill Guddu starts searching for her dad at night, gets giddy due to hunger and falls on the road. Jeevanlal returns home and sees she has the fever. Then Jeevanlal gets arrested for assaulting a Pharmacist as he is unable to afford medicines suggested by the doctor to treat his ill daughter, Guddu. Subsequently, Jeevanlal gets jailed, his repeated and vain attempts to escape from prison to meet his daughter only end up increasing his sentence, leaving Guddu to fend on her own. 8 years pass by. Guddu went to a school as while she was searching for her dad, a Marathi woman saw her and started to allow Guddu grow up in her house. Meanwhile, during transfer from one jail to another, some prisoners died due to an accident, where Qaidi No. 8, Jeevanlal is presumed to be dead. Meanwhile, Jeevanlal manages to escape successfully from that accident, but due to his hunger for food he goes into a bungalow and when he is about to take food, the owner of the bungalow comes to the room, but Jeevanlal shows a knife at him, but the owner of the bungalow, just by glancing at Jeevanlal, says this man is not a thief for sure and introduces himself as Judge Dindayal. Jeevalal says do not send me back to prison as I have escaped only to meet my daughter and says he will kill Dindayal if he raises an alarm. Dindayal asks his servant Bhola to give Jeevanlal food properly and says \\"Let him eat and sleep in our house in the same room where my deceased son used to sleep\\". The same night again Jeevanlal tries to run and steals a golden idol from the house. Bhola informs his owner that the guy who came last night has stolen the golden idol of God and ran away from the room. But the police of that city catch him while trying to sell that idol to a merchant and police inform the owner that the thief confessed that the idol was stolen from his house. Then the owner of the bungalow and the idol - Judge Dindayal - says this person is my friends' son named J.V. and has not stolen the idol, but in fact is the owner of the idol. Dindayal, though aware that escaped convict is at his home, decides to let Jeevanlal not get caught in the hands of the police. Dindayal asks him why he is angry at God and then Jeevanlal narrates his sad story which happened in recent days. Dindayal says since his only son has already died and since he feels he can trust Jeevanlal, though he is a judge he is ready to give Jeevanlal a new lease of life, with the new name J.V. as he felt that fate was actually playing the game in life of both himself and Jeevanlal as he, though old, is forced to live in the world, whereas his young son died a premature death and on the other hand Jeevanlal was forced by fate to commit a crime which was necessary to take care of his daughter, but now even that daughter has got separated from him. Dindayal lets Jeevanlal stay in his house and take care of his assets and has advised him not to stop praying to God and gives him a bag full of cash for Jeevanalal to start a new life. Six years later Jeevanlal will re-surface as a wealthy male and prospective Mayor knew now simply as J.V.; while his grown-up daughter Guddu (Farah Naaz) will be living two lives - one as the single mother Nirmala of a young boy child, Kiran; and the other as a gun-toting alcoholic dancer prostitute known as Bulbul. Nirmala, after her husband's death starts working in a factory owned by J.V., but due to her concentrating on her small baby's cry, she is thrown out by the factory management and to earn money she gets into the club dancer profession and sends her child to Rajan's Chachi (Shubha Khote). Now Nirmala decides to take revenge on the owner of the factory, J.V., for having changed her life (she was working in his factory only as a worker, but was thrown out and circumstances forced her to become a prostitute. She dresses up like Bulbul, a modern prostitute and decides to meet up with J.V. and she says would he like to be her client for a day. J.V. slaps her, saying he is a good human being and the habit she has is really bad and that she is characterless. Jeevanlal though, does not know where his daughter is living and how she now looks, but comes across a child called Kiran on the road on a fine day. He asks Kiran why she is crying. Then Rajan Dada says he wants to sell that girl as she has been brought up by Chacha-Chachi in this area and its none of Jeevanlal's business. J.V. replies to him saying this girl reminds him of his own daughter Guddu and asks whether Kiran's mother's name is Nirmala. J.V. harbors doubt in his mind, but Rajan Dada and Chachi stop Kiran from disclosing her mother's name and J.V. asks Kulkarni to find the name of Kiran's parents. Later, he finds Bulbul again in the profession of prostitute and advises her saying that she should not be in this profession and that she is like a daughter to him. Then Bulbul says J.V. you are responsible me for being thrown out of your factory and making me a prostitute, otherwise I would have been a simple working-class woman. Nirmala does not recognize her dad's face immediately, but soon her memory works and she realizes that J.V. is her own father from whom she got separated after that fateful night, but chooses to not let J.V. know the truth. Later Jeevanlal tries his best to solve all her problems including dealing with Rajan Dada, who is responsible for Nirmala's husband's early death and Kiran separating from her mother Nirmala. Later Bulbul confesses that she is Nirmala, none other than his own daughter, who was forced to live a horrific life, due to his absence in her life during teenage years and aftermath. Now J.V. solves every problem of her daughter's life, including ensuring that both Kiran and Nirmala unite and that Rajan Dada is killed.

Although he grew up in the United States, he can still speak fluently in his main language, Mandarin; thus, he is able to easily communicate to his fans in Taiwan through his secondary channel – JasonChenAsia. Furthermore, Chen's mother is a piano teacher, so he had the advantage of growing up under the influence of music and was given opportunities to learn many different instruments, such as the piano, the guitar, and the violin. Chen discovered his vocal talent at the age of 18 when he was planning a proposal to his high school crush. After graduating from UCLA, he became an accountant for about a year, but later decided to mainly focus on producing music.

As an ice-rated vessel she has operated as an expedition cruise ship in Antarctica and in the Arctic. She was also known under the names Renaissance VII, Regina Renaissance, Renai I, Sun, Island Sun, Corinthian II, Sea Explorer, Sea Explorer I. In the early 1990s the Renaissance Cruises company commissioned eight small cruise ships, all of which were given numeric names in the form of Roman figures (from I to VIII). The second group of four identical sister ships, V - VIII, was built in a different yard, and had increased capabilities. Originally named Renaissance VII, Hebridean Sky was the third ship of the second group. Designed to operate in almost any place of the world, this ship accommodated up to 120 passengers in 59 cabins. The lounge and dining room were both large enough to welcome all passengers at one time. There were also other facilities, such as swimming pool and nightclub. In 1992 Renaissance VII was chartered by a tour company, Raymond & White, and was renamed Regina Renaissance, cruising for several years in the Caribbean. The charter ended in 1998, and ship was returned to her original name and changed her itinerary for cruising in the Mediterranean in summer and in the Indian Ocean in winter, being presented mainly in North American and European markets. Renaissance Cruises went bankrupt in October 2001, and Renaissance VII was sold to a business group that had invested in the company. They renamed the vessel Renai I, but she remained idle, for sale or charter. In 2003 the ship's name was changed to Sun, and the year after, the vessel was bought by International Shipping, who renamed her Island Sun, and then she was chartered by Mauritius Island Cruises. They planned to operate the vessel on a regular basis, making cruises around Mauritius from Port Louis. Unfortunately, the company did not pass through bureaucratic regulations enforced by the government and was forced to cease operations after only a couple of days. During 2004, a company named Around The World Cruises began to promote cruises from Fremantle, Australia, for the coming summer. After experiencing some difficulties, the company finally managed to obtain Island Sun at a very short notice, and she duly arrived in Fremantle on 26 November. After making only four short cruises the departure that was scheduled for 10 December was cancelled almost before the voyage, and the operating company went bankrupt few days later. A bit later Mauritius Island Cruises also collapsed, and in 2005 Island Sun was sold to the Danish Clipper Group, and the vessel was chartered to an American company named Travel Dynamics International. They renamed the vessel Corinthian II, refurbished and redecorated her, and for eight years she cruised mainly in the Mediterranean region and later in Antarctica. In 2013 the ship was chartered from Clipper Group by Polar Latitudes and Poseidon Expeditions. They operated her in Antarctica and the Arctic. In 2014 the ship was acquired by Noble Caledonia, a company that already owned sister vessels Island Sky (formerly Renaissance VIII) and Caledonian Sky (formerly Renaissance VI). The ship was refitted in April 2016.

History Sam Reed and other Republicans in Washington organized a symposium to discuss the future of the Republican party in the state in 1969. The event, branded the Cascade Conference, ultimately became an annual meeting. In 1990 attendees of the Cascade Conference organized the Mainstream Republicans of Washington as a permanent advocacy group. In 2002 the Republican Main Street Partnership and the Mainstream Republicans of Washington announced a working partnership \\"to recruit, promote and support quality moderate Republicans for elective office in Washington state and nationwide.\\" Members Former Washington secretary of State Sam Reed, pictured here in 2005, is considered the founder of Mainstream Republicans of Washington. Members of Mainstream Republicans of Washington include former congressman Sid Morrison, former secretaries of state Ralph Munro and Sam Reed, former lands commissioner Doug Sutherland, and state legislators Gary Alexander, Steve Litzow, and Hans Zeiger. Rodney Tom, a one-time Republican state legislator who switched to the Democratic Party, is a former member of the group's board of directors. Activities Since 2008 Mainstream Republicans has organized Action for Washington, an annual leadership training program targeting college students and recent college graduates. The group continues to host its annual symposium, the Cascade Conference. In 2007, former United States Attorney John McKay, who had been fired by the George W. Bush administration in the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, received enthusiastic applause when he addressed the conference. The 2013 event featured a speech by Tacoma mayor Marilyn Strickland, a Democratic Party activist who had previously made headlines when she described Republicans as \\"racist,\\" a remark for which she later apologized. The organization claims to have raised and donated more than $500,000 to Republican candidates in Washington in 2012. Major supporters of the group that year included Microsoft and Weyerhaeuser, which each donated $25,000, and former McCaw Cellular executive Bruce McCaw, who gave $10,000. Labor unions, including the state teacher's union and the Washington Federation of State Employees, also contributed to the Mainstream Republicans of Washington. Positions and Endorsements Mainstream Republicans of Washington has generally advocated consensus-building and compromise in public policy while backing fiscally conservative candidates with both socially conservative and socially liberal views. In 2013 the group's executive-director called on the Republican Party to eschew conservative candidates in favor of those likely to \\"attract more people living in the middle of the spectrum.\\" The organization has had a sometimes contentious relationship with religious conservatives. When Ken Eikenberry, the chairman of the Washington State Republican Party, was challenged for the party's leadership in 1994 by the head of the Christian Coalition in Washington, Mainstream Republicans president Mark Gardner warned that religious conservatives were trying to gain control of the party's money and influence. The group cautioned that, while they would ultimately be willing to back most Republican candidates, they might also campaign against those they found too extreme. In 2005 Mainstream Republicans came out in opposition to Washington Initiative 912, a ballot measure that would have repealed a 9.5-cent gas tax enacted by the state legislature. The tax increase had been passed to fund transportation infrastructure improvements. Mainstream Republicans of Washington backed Washington Referendum 71 in 2009, which allowed same-sex couples to enter into domestic partnerships in the state, and endorsed Washington Referendum 74, a measure introduced in 2012 to license same-sex marriage. In the Washington gubernatorial election, 2012, Mainstream Republicans of Washington endorsed GOP candidate Rob McKenna and criticized votes taken by Democratic challenger Jay Inslee while in Congress which the group characterized as being anti-gay. The following year the group joined with the Democratic Party in Washington in opposing Initiative 517, a ballot measure that would require some private property owners to allow petitioners to gather signatures on their property. The proposal was subsequently rejected by voters. The 2013 election season also saw Mainstream Republicans of Washington come out against Initiative 522, which would have required labeling of genetically modified foods. Other recent candidate endorsements the group has made include Joe Fain, Dick Muri, Jan Angel, and Kim Wyman. Controversies In 2004, an environmental advocacy group - Washington Conservation Voters - objected to a claim made by Mainstream Republicans of Washington that Republican candidate Doug Sutherland had been endorsed by the group in his campaign for lands commissioner. While individual board members of Washington Conservation Voters had endorsed Sutherland, the organization itself had endorsed his Democratic opponent, Mike Cooper. Mainstream Republicans of Washington subsequently posted a clarification on its website. The Washington state Public Disclosure Commission fined Mainstream Republicans of Washington $10,000 in 2005 after the group made a $30,000 contribution to Sam Reed's campaign for reelection as secretary of state. The donation limit was $1,350. In 2007 Mainstream Republicans of Washington again had a run-in with Washington Conservation Voters when the group charged that a Mainstream Republicans campaign mailer falsely implied some of the candidates it was endorsing had also received endorsements from Washington Conservation Voters. A Public Disclosure Commission investigation exonerated the Mainstream Republicans.

Kim attended Gyeongbuk University from which he received his B.A. in English and Sogang University from which he received and M.A. in Korean. He has been a member of the group \\"Jakga\\" since 1979 and served as Editor in Chief on Minumsa Publishing. Work Kim Wonu made his literary debut in 1977 with the novella Appointed Posts (Imji), a scathing critique of the philistinism and commodity fetishism that he saw as pervasive in middle-class Korean society. Everyday lives of middle-class Koreans in all its unabashed materialism and self-interest, is an abiding concern in the entire body of Kim Wonu's fiction. His characters possess little or no individual personality, and can only find meaning in their lives through the ceaseless pursuit of profit. Because they are so entrenched in immediate material gratification, they fail to realize the sterility of their lives; Kim Wonu, therefore, frequently employs an outside agent to act as a mediator in his fiction.Source-attribution\\"Kim Won-Woo\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# There is, however, a certain reflectiveness that pervades Kim Wonu's fiction, and this quality has much to do with the way in which Kim's own experiences are brought to bear in his fictional accounts. The falsity and hypocrisy that underlie middle-class rhetoric of success is part of his life as well; the sense of weariness generated by life's routines can be detected in Kim's reminiscences of his own youth. Kim Wonu's critical voice thus conveys something stubborn yet honest at the same time. Combined effectively with meticulous, insightful descriptions of ordinary people and events, this voice allows Kim Wonu's works to become something more than mere 'novel of manners' and offer intellectually engaging portraits of life that are at once fiercely critical and heart- warming. Kim has won the 1998 Dong-sa Literature Award and 2002 Daesan Literature Prize.

In 1586 at Hetsugigawa (present Ōnogawa) in Bungo province Toyotomi's vanguard divisions under Chōsokabe Motochika and Sengoku Hidehisa landed on Kyūshū with orders to act defensively until further troops were able to join them. But the advance party decided to disobey Hideyoshi's commands and relieve the castle of Toshimitsu. The Shimazu besieging army noted their approach, and redoubled their efforts to take Toshimitsu, so that when the invaders arrived at the Hetsugi river, which flowed within sight of the castle, they could see the flags of Shimazu flying from its towers. Chōsokabe Motochika proposed a withdrawal, but his companions insisted on doing battle, so the Shimazu set their trap. The decoy force led by Ijuin Hisanori attacked across the river and then withdrew, which persuaded the allied left wing to follow them. They were met by arquebus and arrow fire, and the main body of the Shimazu then fell upon them. After much fierce fighting the invading force withdrew across the river and caused confusion to its own right wing. Chōsokabe Motochika was obliged to signal a full retreat, during which his son and heir Nobuchika was killed. References *Turnbull, Stephen (2012). Samurai Armies 1467-1649.

He appeared in plays of Shakespeare, particularly in productions by Herbert Beerbohm Tree. Early life and career Anson was born in Montrose in Scotland; his father was actor John W. Anson, whose early career was with theatrical companies of Dundee, Perth, Montrose and Inverness. His mother was the actress Barbara Johnson, the sister of Samuel Johnson who played the low- comedy roles in the Henry Irving Company at the Lyceum Theatre, London. George Anson first appeared on stage at the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh in December 1865. During the next few years he gained a reputation as a character actor. Niblo's Garden, Broadway, c.1887; Anson appeared here in 1872. He appeared in New York in 1872, in the burlesque La Belle Sauvage by John Brougham at the Broadway theatre Niblo's Garden; later the same year he was in the burlesque Poll and Partner Joe by F. C. Burnand at the same theatre. Anson's first appearance in London was at the Olympic Theatre in 1873, in the comedy Sour Grapes by H. J. Byron. In the following year he was in a production at the same theatre of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing, in the role of Verges. Up to 1875 he was in other plays at this theatre, including Lady Clancarty, The Ticket-of-Leave Man and Henry Dunbar, all by Tom Taylor; in Henry Dunbar, playing the role of the Major, \\"his picture of light-hearted and ebullient villainy... was singularly life-like and unconventional\\". In 1875–86 he appeared in burlesques at the Court Theatre; in 1877 he returned to the Olympic Theatre; in 1879 he was at the Haymarket Theatre, where he appeared in The Life of an Actress by Dion Boucicault. A critic in 1880 wrote \\"As an actor Mr Anson is possessed of force and pathos, and is an excellent low comedian.\\" The actor Sir Charles Hawtrey wrote of him \\"He was a very fine character actor, especially in rough parts\\". Shakespeare, Sydney and New York In 1880 he joined the company of Shakespearean actress Madame Modjeska. In 1892 he appeared at the Criterion Theatre in Sydney, in New Men and Old Acres by Tom Taylor. The play was a success: The Sydney Mail stated it \\"sorely taxed the seating accommodations\\" and \\"every available corner was occupied\\". The Sydney Morning Herald said \\"Mr Anson had a tremendous reception, and the applause lasted so long that the actor had every excuse for feeling embarrassed\\". The following month he appeared, in the role of Eccles, in the comedy Caste by Thomas William Robertson at the same theatre. It was his final appearance before returning to England. The Sydney Morning Herald said \\"after the present run it is not probable that as fine a cast will ever be furnished in Australia again\\".

Between 1910 and 1917 he appeared in various Broadway theatres. He appeared in Suzanne which ran for 64 performances at the Lyceum Theatre, opening in December 1910. It came during 1911 to Toronto, where a reviewer wrote, \\"The veteran English character actor George W. Anson [was] playing the role of a crusty old brewer. Mr. Anson is an artist, who for years has been associated with the most noted actors of England....\\" Other Broadway plays in this period included in 1916 a revival of The Merry Wives of Windsor, in which Beerbohm Tree also appeared, and in 1917 The Barton Mystery by Walter C. Hackett, in which George Anson's son Albert Edward Anson also appeared. Movies He appeared in the 1914 short film The President's Special, one of many films produced by Thomas A.

In due course the State Examination Center released a statement with a similar message, confirming that the new idea does not represent a cancellation of the test method as such.

Kim graduated from Sunchang Agricultural High School, and has worked as a teacher at the Imsil Tokchi Elementary School. and at Woonam Elementary School. Kim made his official literary debut in 1982 when \\"Seomjingang River I” (Seomjingang I) and seven other poems were included in Undying Flame (Kkeojiji anneun hwaetbullo)a book of poetry with collected works by twenty-one prominent poets, published by Creation and Criticism.Source-attribution\\"Kim Yong Taik\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Work Kim's work takes as its point of departure that which is forgotten in the bustle of modern life - the countryside, a leaf of grass, the smell of one's mother's hair. Kim's affectionate and delicate treatment of the everyday affairs of people living in the countryside offered urban dwellers an unadulterated account of rural farming communities. Underlying the poet's tender poetic sensibility is a stern voice of censure. In \\"Beat the Drums of Protest” (Madangeun bittureojyeosseodo jangguneun baro chija), for example, the poet offers a powerful disapprobation of city politicians and government policymakers who distort and pervert reports on the actual conditions confronting farmers in the countryside. Underlying Kim's poetic undertaking is the poet's candid desire to provide a sense of dignity to the rural community. This approach, however, has rendered the poet vulnerable to criticism as anachronistic and incapable of offering a solution to the harsh realities of modern society. Kim's desire for community, however, possesses a straightforward quality otherwise lacking in the sometimes convoluted theories of modernity. Kim's stance affirms the spirit of the people, whom he believes derive their identity and dignity from a long history of agrarian life. The robust critical spirit of his poetry derives from his use of the Jeolla-do dialect in poetic forms such as Gasa, Taryeong, and Pansori. This combined use of dialect, proverbs, and colloquialisms strengthens the sense of rural community in Kim's poetry. The use of traditional rhythms, furthermore, endows Kim's poetry with the power to engender tension, rage, and laughter. Kim has won several awards in 1986 the Kim Su-yeong Literature Award, in 1997 the Sowol Poetry Prize, in 2002 the 소충사선문화상 Award and in 2012 the 윤동주 문학대상 Award.

The association counts more than 2,000 people from 120 different European Institutions and 18 National/Regional Organizations across 36 Countries.  Overview  EUNIS brings together those who are responsible for the management, development and the policy for Information Technology in Higher Education in Europe. Members of EUNIS are generally high level professionals actively seeking collaboration activities and networking opportunities. The objective of EUNIS is to contribute to the development of high-quality information systems. To achieve this, the aims of EUNIS are: * encourage exchange, cooperation and debates between those responsible for information systems in higher education or research institutes/organizations within Europe. * establish relationships with supervisory organizations in charge of information systems in higher education and in research institutes in each country as well as at European level.  History  European University Information Systems (EUNIS) was created in 1993, after an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) study on \\"Impact of Information Technology on Higher Education\\". EUNIS creation meetings, held in Amsterdam and Paris, were attended by scholars from Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. EUNIS has been officially registered in France in 1998, after a first General Assembly held during the 1997 Conference in Grenoble.  Activities  Special Interest Groups, or Task Forces, gather around dedicated subjects (Learning & Teaching, Benchmarking, Student Mobility, Business Intelligence, Cloud Management, Information Security and Enterprise Architecture). A SIG/TF is one of the links between EUNIS, its members and prospective members, both public sector and private sector and is the mechanism that transforms the theories discussed during events into concrete activities. Events are organized throughout the year: One of the main EUNIS activity is its Annual Congress. This event is attended by up to 400+ delegates from more than 30 countries. During the Congress, awards are given by EUNIS to the most estimated papers and projects: the Elite Award, the Dørup E-learning Award and the Best Paper Award.

She gave birth to two children fathered by a local aristocrat, and had connived in the murder of another nun in order to cover up the affair. This took place in Monza, in northern Italy, at the beginning of the 17th century. Following this scandal she became widely known as The Nun of Monza. Her life inspired one of the characters in Alessandro Manzoni's novel The Betrothed, which has also been dramatized several times.  Early life  Marianna de Leyva y Marino was born in Milan, Italy, on December 4, 1575. She was the daughter of Martìno de Leyva and Virginia Maria Marino, widow of Ercole Pio Count of Sassuolo, and great granddaughter of Antonio de Leyva, who inherited the title to a County from Charles V. Virginia was the daughter and direct heir of one of the richest men in Milan, the banker Tommaso Marino. Martìno had inherited the County of Monza as the great nephew of Antonio de Leyva, a Spaniard who became a notorious commander in Italy at the service of Charles V, who gave him the Fiefdom of Monza, with its related and substantial incomes. Martino was the second son of Luis de Leyva, Prince of Ascoli, who was an army captain and first Spanish Governor of Milan.De Leyva family crest After the death of her mother Virginia in 1576, the infant Marianna was entered into a long trial for her inheritance, which was eventually not resolved in her favor. Her mother wanted to give half of her possessions to Marianna and the other half to her first son, Marco Pio, who was her child from an earlier marriage. Her will was contested by Marco Pio's sisters, who had been left nothing.Paolo Colussi, La vera storia della Monaca di Monza, 2002 Marianna lived with her aunts until 1588.  Life as a nun  She was 13 years and 3 months old when her father forced her to become a nun in the Monastery Saint Margherita. The Monastery was located in Spalto di Porta de’ Grandi, also known as via Azzone Visconti. This monastery could only be accessed through a small street, which today is called Via della Signora. March 15, 1589, was the last time that don Martino de Levya saw his daughter. Her father said he would leave her the inheritance of 6.000 lire, to be given to her by Giuseppe Limiato. The truth was that Limiato never received the money. Historical witnesses have confirmed she did receive income from the yearly revenues for being a nun.Gervaso, Roberto, La monaca di Monza. Venere in convento, Milano, Bompiani 1988 On August 26, 1591, the archbishop witnessed four newly arrived sisters consecrate themselves: Sister Virginia Maria, Sister Benedetta Felice, Sister Teodora da Seveso and Sister Ottavia Caterina Ricci. On September 26, 1591, Marianna became Sister Virginia Maria.Locatelli-Milesi, Achille, La Signora di Monza nella realtà, Milano, Treves 1924 Before the scandal which made her notorious, contemporary writer Ripamonti described her as \\"modest\\", \\"respectful\\", and \\"obedient\\". He also records that she befriended everyone easily, and enjoyed reading as much as possible. She gained popularity in Monza in this period. For example, on May 20, 1594, the writer Bartolomeo Zucchi sent her a letter in which he praised her for her choice of becoming a nun. = The scandal = The Nun of Monza, painting by Mosè Bianchi The scandal was caused by her love affair with the count Giovanni Paolo Osio, who had previously been accused of murder. In 1597 Marianna was a teacher at the convent's school for girls. During this period she met Osio, who lived in a house next to the monastery.Giuseppe Ripamonti,\\"Historiae Patriae\\" (Homeland History), chapter III, 1641-1643, pp. 358-377 Though a nun, Marianna was both rich and powerful: from a wealthy family, she also administered property revenues in Monza and was involved in administering justice. She started to exchange letters with Osio, delivered to his garden through a rope lowered from a window. The liaison was facilitated by the use of counterfeit keys provided by a blacksmith. The meetings between them were frequent and were organized with the complicity of other nuns and a priest named Paolo Arrigone, a close friend of Osio. In 1602 Marianna gave birth to an illegitimate stillborn baby. After this, the relationship with Osio temporarily ended. Despite this, after a while the affair restarted, although the lovers' meetings were less frequent. In autumn 1603 Sister Virginia got pregnant for the second time, and gave birth to a girl. The child was named Alma Francesca Margherita. Alma subsequently lived with the father, Count Osio, who legally acknowledged her as his illegitimate daughter two years later in 1605. In the summer of 1606, one of the nuns at the convent threatened to expose the relationship. As a consequence of this threat, Osio killed her in order to avoid the spreading of the story. This murder apparently took place with the complicity of both Sister Virginia and other nuns.E. Paccagnini, \\"La vita di suor V.M. de L.\\" (Life of V.M. de L.), pp. 3-93 Sister Virginia threatened all the nuns complicit in the murder that they would suffer the same fate if they revealed the crime. The murder remained secret because outsiders were told that the murdered lay sister had run off. In the autumn of 1606, however, rumors about the activities at the convent became more frequent. The blacksmith who had counterfeited the keys was also killed by Osio. These facts came to the ears of the governor of Milan. On Carnival day of 1607 Osio was arrested and imprisoned in Pavia. He subsequently escaped and was later given a death sentence in absentia. He was eventually murdered by an alleged friend. = The trial = When the Archbishop Federico Borromeo came to know about the scandal he ordered a canonical trial of the nun. The trial of Sister Virginia started on November 27, 1607, and she was interrogated by Vicar Gerolamo Saracino. Marianna defended herself by claiming loss of free-will, asserting that diabolic forces had exercised on her an irresistible impulse. From November 19 until March 27, 1608, the interrogation of the priest Paolo Arrigone took place. On May 22, 1608, the interrogation restarted again and this time torture was used.U. Colombo, \\"Life and Trial of Sister Virginia Maria\\" (italian \\"Vita e processo di suor V.M. de L. monaca di Monza\\"), Milan 1985 On June 14 Sister Virginia was interrogated. She confirmed, under physical torment, the accusations against Arrigone. Even his doorman and his wife were exposed to torture in order to confirm the accusations against him. It must be noted that \\"exposed\\" means being shown the instruments of torture so it does not necessarily mean being tortured. In the verdict, on October 18, 1608, Sister Virginia was sentenced to be walled-in for 13 years in the Home of Santa Valeria. After surviving this period of incarceration, she lived there until her death in 1650.Massimo Carlo Giannini, Virginia Maria De Leyva, published on Treccani.it, 2005  'The Nun of Monza' in literature  The Nun of Monza, illustration to the novel Her continued renown is mostly credited to the novel The Betrothed (orig. Italian: I promessi sposi, 1827), generally ranked among the masterpieces of world literature.Alessandro Manzoni Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 27 Oct. 2010 She appears in Chapters IX, X, XVIII, XX and XXVII under the name \\"Gertrude\\". Her portrait is one of the longest and most detailed of the whole novel; it deals with her previous life, her difficult relationship with her family, her initial rejection for religious life, and the strength and the cruelty of her father which finally forced her to live as a nun. It is a romanticized account, but based on Virginia de Leyva's character. It is described through a \\"flashbacks\\" technique, along with particular combinations of nouns and adjectives which suggest a hidden anguished secret in the nun's previous life.Alessandro Manzoni, The Betrothed, Chapter IX Through her back-story we learn that her religious vows didn't stop her physical urges, and she had a relationship with an evil aristocrat, Egidio, who pushed her to become his accomplice in the murder of a nun: this is her tormenting secret.Alessandro Manzoni, The Betrothed, Chapter X The principal female characters, Agnese and Lucia, meet Gertrude (The Nun of Monza) while escaping from the villain Don Rodrigo. They shelter in her convent, looking for hospitality. Gertrude becomes close to Lucia. Egidio asks her to help him to kidnap Lucia on behalf of the bandit Innominato, who is working for Rodrigo. She at first refuses, then gives in, and later confesses her crimes. Her decision is difficult for her, emphasizing Manzoni's view of her as a weak tool of evil, unable to resist threats and temptations, but basically not cruel.Alessandro Manzoni, The Betrothed, Chapter XX Later in the novel, at the end of Chapter 37, Lucia learns of Gertrude's repentance, confession of guilt, and consequent sentence.

He signed amateur forms with Football League club Plymouth Argyle, but played only one competitive match for them before returning to Kingstonian, for whom he played until retiring from the game in 1936. During that time, he captained the club to victory in the 1933 Amateur Cup, was capped four times for the England amateur XI, and scored twice in each match as the Amateurs beat the Professionals 6–1 in the 1925 FA Charity Shield and 6–3 in the 1926 match. Personal life Macey was born in 1894, and joined the Royal Fusiliers when he was 15.\\"Frank Macey\\". Greens on Screen. Retrieved 19 November 2013. He was captured early in the First World War, and spent most of the conflict as a prisoner of war. On his release, he acted as an interpreter for German prisoners of war in England, and after further tours of duty abroad, he returned to the Middlesex area. After leaving the Army, he worked for the electricity company in Kingston, Surrey, as a meter inspector. Macey died in Westminster Hospital on 3 December 1973, at the age of 79, and was buried in Kingston Cemetery. Football career While a serving soldier, he played for the Army XI in inter-service competition, as well as in friendly matches against club sides and against other countries' military teams. In 1923, he was selected for an Army XI that took on Aston Villa; although his team lost heavily, the Manchester Guardian wrote that \\"Macey was the 'star' of the Army team. He has a real gift for the game, trapping the ball like a master, feeding his wings well, and generally revealing unmistakable 'class' in all he does.\\" They did, however, question whether his lack of height might make him better suited to wing- rather than centre-forward play.\\"Aston Villa's easy win at Aldershot\\". Manchester Guardian: p. 3. 18 October 1923. A few months later, he scored twice and set up a third as the Army XI beat the French Army in Paris by three goals to one, as part of an international triangular tournament.\\"British soldiers beat Frenchmen\\".

Macey was selected for the amateur eleven in three of those four matches. In 1923, his team lost 2–0 to the Professionals. According to the Manchester Guardian, \\"Drummer Macey, though very smart and quick, was overshadowed by G. Wilson.\\"\\"The Association game. Professionals win Charity Shield\\". Manchester Guardian: p. 4. 9 October 1923. He was selected again for the 1925 match, to oppose a professional eleven chosen from among those players recently returned from an FA tour of Australia. The Amateurs won 6–1, Macey scored twice, and although he \\"looked a midget by contrast with the opposing defenders\\", the way he scored his second goal \\"with both Spencer and Charlton trying to worry him off the ball was typical of his work throughout\\".G.P.S.

The Amateurs won 6–3, and the Daily Mirror reported that \\"no one did more to influence the result than Macey, the diminutive inside left of the Kingstonian club.

Irishmen outclassed at the Palace\\". Irish Times: p. 11. 12 November 1923.

This corporation consists of Calzedonia, Intimissimi, Tezenis, Falconeri, Signorvino, Atelier Emé and Cash & Carry. According to the Forbes list of billionaires, Sandro Veronesi is one of the richest people in the world, with a net worth of over one billion dollars. His net worth in 2013 was estimated at $1.8 billion.  Early life  Veronesi was born in Ala, Trento, Italy, in 1959. He gained his High school Diploma from Liceo ‘Galileo Galilei’ and he graduated 'cum laude' in 1983 in Economics and Business in Verona. On completion of his degree, he began work at the Golden Lady SpA, an Italian company leader in the production of pantyhose, founded by Nerino Grassi. Sandro Veronesi married Nadia Grassi, one of the two daughters of Nerino Grassi. Nadia Veronesi is also one of the main shareholders of Calzedonia Group (with a 15% share).  Business career  Veronesi was added to the Forbes Billionaires list in 2013. He is the founder of the Calzedonia Group, an Italian company that sells lingerie, stockings and swimsuits through its Calzedonia, Intimissimi and Tezenis brands. It also has a majority position in Falconeri, an Italian clothing company known for its cashmere knitwear. Veronesi's first job after graduating from the University of Verona was with Golden Lady, an Italian hosiery company. He started Calzedonia in 1987 while still working at Golden Lady. The company originally focused on tights and stockings. In the mid-1990s it diversified to include the lingerie and underwear sectors. In 2013 there were more than 3,000 Calzedonia stores throughout Europe and the Middle East. = Early career = After university, Sandro Veronesi began to work in 1984 at Golden Lady Spa, the company of pantyhose founded by Nerino Grassi. In 1987, when he was only 27 years old, he founded Calzedonia Spa, while he was still working in Golden Lady as a General manager. In 1993 the partnership between the two entrepreneurs broke and he decided to dedicate exclusively to his own Calzedonia, focusing on the objective of producing and selling high quality products at a fair price. In 1996 Calzedonia Group expanded with Intimissimi ( underwear for women and men) with 481 Million in Revenues (+8%) and in 2003 with Tezenis (underwear for the whole family) with 401 Million in Revenues (+25%). In 2009 Calzedonia Group acquired the majority share in Falconeri (knitwear and cashmere). Sandro Veronesi is also the owner of the brand Cash & Carry by Calzedonia Group for the sale of products in stock. = International activities = The stores of Calzedonia, Intimissimi and Tezenis are about 3,000 in more than 30 countries, with factories in Italy, Eastern Europe and Sri Lanka. The Calzedonia Group has about 20,000 employees, with 2,200 only in Italy . Competitive positioning showed a significant leap in sales, which rose from €77 million in 1998 to €1,295 million in 2011. The organization adopted by the entrepreneur originally from Trento is verticalised: it goes from the head to the distribution in single-brand stores through a concentrated production to countries where labor is cheap. The group has four production subsidiaries in Sri Lanka, where it produces the bulk of the production of lingerie, two in Croatia, one in Romania, one in Bulgaria, one in Serbia. This is in addition to three historic sites in Italy. = Other activities = The hotel \\"La Torre\\", within the business group Calzedonia, is a luxury hotel complex created initially by Studio Botturi Castiglione, aimed at restoring an old rural complex. It was subsequently purchased by Sandro Veronesi. The hotel is located in Verona, with good connections to the city and Verona Villafranca Airport, also near Lake Garda. The hotel targets both business and holiday customers, and positioned for local tourist activities like visiting the local vineyards. In 2013, Sandro Veronesi launched the SignorVino chain of wine bars, with the intention of transferring know-how from his experiences in the textile industry. This includes developing the same type of organization and a centralized warehouse management (in Verona). Veronesi created the foundation San Zeno in 1999 through which a part of Calzedonia profit is reinvested in education, training and work for those who are in need and cannot afford it.

A passionate follower of the turf, he was known in horseracing circles as \\"Lawyer Ford\\". Background information Ford's offices were at 8 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, London; his residential properties were in Stratton Street, London and Brunswick Square, Brighton. He was born in St Clement Danes, London,1851 census and in 1816 married Hanna Bramah (1795–1862) at St George's, Hanover Square, daughter of civil engineer Joseph Bramah. Their children included Sir Theodore Thomas Ford, who became Chief Justice for the Straits Settlements, Horace Alfred Ford, one of the greatest target archers of all time, William Augustus Ford,1851 Census Stratton St who followed Ford into the business and was a cricketer who played for the MCC, and George Ford who was also a cricketer and became a clergyman. Ford's grandchildren included Francis Ford, a good cricketer who played for his country, Lionel Ford who became headmaster of Harrow and the painter Henry Justice Ford. Ford kept horseracing stables and a stud in Newmarket and had interests in Epsom. Money lending and bill discounting In 1844 the affairs of James Gibbs, attorney of Jermyn Street, came under public scrutiny. He had been acting as a money scrivener, investing clients' money in worthless schemes, or using the money to bolster his failing business. Over a period of 20 years he slipped deeper into debt and borrowed money at exorbitant interest rates to avoid insolvency. Gibbs was eventually forced into bankruptcy, and this resulted in public exposure of the bill discounters' activities – including those of Ford. He had been dealing with Gibbs for many years and lending at rates of 25%, although his rates were not the highest as others were charging up to 60%. Charles Hallowell Hallowell Carew, came into contact with Ford through his association with horse racing. Ford's attendance at the track made him an easy point of contact for those who had suffered losses in the betting market. In 1851 Ford lent Carew of Beddington Park £2,000 on the security of a note and warrant of attorney. This was followed by a further £3,000 in exchange for a bill of sale for his furniture and horses. When Ford attempted to collect these assets he discovered that they had already been seized by other creditors. Court cases ensued and Carew agreed to Ford managing his financial affairs. In 1856 Carew signed away all rights to his Beddington Park properties to new owners, one of whom was Ford's son William Augustus. The property had been in the Carew family for some 500 years. Lord Huntingtower was a \\"client\\" of Ford who faced financial difficulties. Huntingtower borrowed large sums of money during his minority and was unable to meet the repayments. At this period bankruptcy laws applied only to traders, whereas non-traders in debt were classed as insolvent, subject to imprisonment and seizure of their belongings. To avoid this happening, Lord Huntingtower claimed he was a trader. Ford, who was a creditor, disputed this and brought a case to annul the fiat, but lost this on a technicality. Huntingtower did spent a period in Debtors' prison, but admitted at a later bankruptcy hearing (9 August 1844) that if he had acted on Ford's advice earlier, he would not have been placed in such an unfortunate position. Lord Brownlow Thomas Montagu Cecil (2nd son of the Marquis of Exeter) was another of Ford's clients to end up in jail for debt. He had applied to Ford for a loan during his minority, but Ford would not agree to this without a promissory note from his father the Marquis. However, Ford did lend a lower sum but Cecil left the country without honouring his debts. When he returned in 1854 he was arrested. Cecil applied to be discharged from custody and at the end of the hearing Ford removed his objection so that Cecil could be released. In later life Colonel Lord Brownlow Thomas Montagu Cecil was again subject of insolvency proceedings in 1894. Sir Robert Juckes Clifton: Before he came of age in 1847, his gambling and horse racing activities placed him in debt to Ford and, like Cecil, was forced to live abroad. When he came of age he returned to England and Ford sued for his money. Clifton's father applied for an injunction against Ford but lost the case, however, the judge had little sympathy for Ford saying: \\"If a man would assist a boy of 19 or 20 to run extravagantly into debt, it was to be wished he would lose his money\\" Sir Simeon Stuart borrowed money from Ford against his property. However, unbeknown to Ford, Sir Simeon had made a separate arrangement on this property at an earlier date. Ford went to the courts claiming he had precedence over this earlier arrangement but lost the case. Sir Massy Stanley: On another occasion, Ford was delivering a cash loan to Sir Massy Stanley at an Ascot race meeting, when he was robbed of a reported £7000 by a pickpocket. By using underworld connections he was able to recover some of the money but had to pay a substantial \\"reward\\" to the villains. Accused of extorting money During cross examination in the Lord Huntingtower case, Ford admitted that he had been tried and found guilty of extorting money in 1832. This referred to a case where he and the keeper of a gaming house, John Aldridge, allegedly attempted to obtain money from a person they said had forged a cheque. The case subsequently went to appeal and the ruling was overturned. Ford also admitted under oath that he had been declared bankrupt when younger, but had quickly paid off his debts. Bryndu Colliery In 1842 Ford became the owner of Bryndu Colliery, Glamorgan, after the owner, Charles O'Neill, became bankrupt owing him £6,000. Ford set up a partnership with 2 of his sons – William Augustus Ford and Horace Alfred Ford – to run the colliery. The partnership was dissolved in July 1858 following an explosion in the pit that killed 12 miners. There had been a previous explosion in 1853 when 4 miners had been killed. Horse racing Ford was passionately fond of horse racing and owned a stable and stud in Newmarket. In 1841 he was also the owner of a Newmarket property called Fidget Hall, a stud farm just beyond Bury Hill that was later renamed Moulton Paddocks. His big wins included the Oaks Stakes in 1843 with Poison and the Coronation Stakes with Guaracha in 1846. Some of the horses he sold on from his stable had later success including The Hermit (1851) by Bay Middleton out of Jenny Lind. Ford acquired several of Lord Chesterfield's horses in 1850, and immediately put these up for sale including Lady Evelyn by Don John, (winner of the Oaks 1849), and Mrs Taft, a future Cesarewitch Handicap winner. Mistaken Identity Ford was similar in appearance to one of the famous politicians of the time – Sir James Graham. The similarity was such in stature, countenance, expression, and cock of the hat, that Lord Derby once said they were so alike that they \\"might be driven in a curricle\\".

It is a single question survey which asks patients whether they would recommend the NHS service they have received to friends and family who need similar treatment or care. The friends and family question: “We would like you to think about your experience in the ward where you spent the most time during this stay. How likely are you to recommend our ward to friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment? Patients can answer as “extremely likely”; “likely”; “neither likely nor unlikely”; “unlikely”; “extremely unlikely”; or “don’t know”. The Prime Minister announced on 25 May 2012 that the Friends and Family Test would be introduced across the NHS from April 2013. In October 2013 Francis Maude announced the Test would be extended across the NHS and other public services, including further education, Jobcentre Plus and the National Citizen Service. Publication of the first results in September 2013, based on small numbers of responses, brought complaints that the test was giving a false picture. There were also complaints about the methodology on the grounds that it is susceptible to too many uncontrolled variables for the result to be meaningful. In November 2013 IWantGreatCare formed a partnership with the NHS Alliance to set up a service which allows patients to rate and review doctors, hospitals and GP practices, and provide the Friends and Family test which all GPs will be required to provide from December 2014. By February 2015 it had grown into the biggest ever collection of patient opinion in any health service anywhere in the world. In July 2019 NHS England announced that the test would no longer be required in its present form. There will no longer be a mandatory question about whether the patient or service user would recommend the service from April 2020. Criticism The test has been criticised on a number of grounds.Sizmur S, Graham C, Walsh J: Influence of patients’ age and sex and the mode of administration on results from the NHS Friends and Family Test of patient experience.

BMC Health Services Research, 14, 499. doi:10.1186/s12913-014-0499-z In February 2014 Dr Neil Bacon, chief executive of iWantGreatCare, denounced the implementation of the test, in particular NHS England’s refusal to enforce standardisation of methodology to ensure the data could be trusted and truly competitive. Research for the Care Quality Commission carried out by the Picker Institute in 2012 concluded that the test was “not appropriate for use in an NHS setting”. One of the aims of the test is said to be to help patients make informed choices about healthcare providers (though many patients are in no position to make such a choice) and providers are given a rating score on the NHS Choices website. However no explanation is provided about what this rating means. When tested on a group of undergraduate students none were able to accurately understand the meaning of the test headline score. In July 2014 it was announced that from April 2015 NHS trusts must collect free text comments from patients and collect demographic variables alongside the test data. From December 2014 the test was rolled out to GP practices, and from January 2015, to mental health and community services. The number of responses collect by practices are small. In October 2015 5890 practices collected a total of 181,774 responses from patients - about one patient each day in each practice. Results for each practice can vary wildly from month to month, making the scores very unreliable. The Guardian published an account from a patient who had suffered a miscarriage and described the use of text messaging in respect of the test as \\"crass and inappropriate\\".

He studied at Brera Academy and his first contacts with sculptural art were influenced by Scapigliatura's teachings. He also exhibited his works in New York City and Washington DC, where he was received by president Lyndon Johnson. Angelo Frattini died in Varese on September 2, 1975. In 1978 the artistic lyceum of his hometown was named after him.  Life  Angelo Frattini sculpturing a bust of Umberto II of SavoiaBorn in Varese on November 10, 1910, Angelo Frattini became an orphan at the age of 9. His artistic formation took place initially in Naples and subsequently in Milan. Frattini served his Italian military service in Naples, where he attended Giovanni De Martino's evening classes and got to know Gemito's sculpture. In Naples he also frequented the Galleria d’Arte Moderna and the National Archeological Museum. For most of his youth he was self-taught, and was influenced by late Nineteenth Century art. In 1925 he was a student at Giuseppe Motta’s evening class, and with his friend Flaminio Bertoni he carved some small low reliefs at Campo dei Fiori. When he went back to Milan in 1931, he studied at the Artistic Lyceum and then at the Academy of Brera, where he attended Francesco Messina’s class. Varese was the background-city for his artistic growth from the 1930s. In 1934 he married Maria Gervasini, who, one year later, gave birth to their first son, Gianluigi. His first contact with the art of sculpture follows Giuseppe Grandi and the Scapigliatura teachings. He shared his contemporaneity with friends who were poets, writers, painters, sculptors and actors such as Piero Chiara, Vittorio Sereni, Giuseppe Montanari, Aldo Patocchi, Luciano Ferriani, Paolo Conti, Aldo Carpi, Renato Guttuso and Gianni Santuccio. Widowed in 1953, in 1961 he married Magda Lazzari, mother of his third daughter, born in 1963. Angelo Frattini died in Varese, while the first anthological exhibition at Villa Mirabello was getting prepared.  Awards  In 1937 he received several awards: he won I Littoriali for the sculpture in Rome, at the Campidoglio was rewarded for the Orfana, work bought by the Galleria d’Arte Moderna of Milan, and won the contest to make the big relief on the palace of Corporation in Piazza Monte Grappa in Varese. In 1937 was also born his second son, Vittore, who subsequently followed his father’s steps in becoming an artist. In the same year Frattini received the I Premio of sculpture award in Naples, and in Milan in 1954 he received the I Premio awards for portraits. In 1965 Frattini was the artistic spokesperson for Italy in New York and in Washington, where he was received by the President of the United States Lyndon Johnson, in the collective \\"Mostra degli artisti italiani\\".  Exhibitions  In 1938 he held a major exhibition at the Galleria Ferrari of Milan, reference point for his whole career, and at the Biennale Internazionale d’Arte of Venice. He held further exhibitions in Venice in 1940 and in 1942. In 1946 he sculptured the portrait of King Umberto II di Savoia. He also boasted major exhibitions of his work at the Permanente of Milan and at other national exhibitions such as the Quadriennale d’Arte of Torino in 1955 and the Quadriennale of Rome the following year. In 1978 the artistic lyceum of Varese was named after him. The city of Varese has held several exhibitions to commemorate Frattini's life and works, including a homage by the Provincia di Varese in 1999. These include: * in 1999, a retrospective of him at Villa Recalcati, headquarters of the Provincia di Varese; * in 2010, an exhibition at the Museo Bertoni; * in 2010, a centenary exhibition at Sala Veratti, to celebrate the centenary of his birth.

Businesses might be based on three different types of knowledge: analytical; synthetic or symbolic. Creative or cultural businesses, such as entertainment, publishing, design, or fashion, draw heavily on a symbolic knowledge base. They serve important symbolic functions such as capturing, refracting, and legitimating social knowledge and values. The essence of a brand or a product in these industries resides in its meaning for the consumer rather than in its function. The symbol-intensive brand definition has been firstly introduced by Stefania Saviolo and Antonio Marazza in the book ‘Lifestyle Brands – A Guide to Inspirational Marketing’. Analyzing a brand's choices in terms of competitive scope (number of targets and categories served) and type of benefits provided to the customer, five classes of Symbol-intensive brands are identified: # Authority brands # Solution brands # Icon brands # Cult brands # Lifestyle brands Symbol-intensive brands are able to maintain a relationship with their clients that goes beyond the usual brand loyalty. Clients tend to become ambassadors, fans, champions, that find the brand fundamental or irreplaceable in their lives. Researchers have noted superior economic and financial performances in brands capable of engaging people or influencing a social context proposing an original point of view.

Cult brands deliver a sense of belonging between people who share the same culture and passions. Harley- Davidson is a typical example of cult brand because they effectively express open roads culture, free spirit mythology, and connotations of Hells Angels’ machismo. These ideas amass a following of the company's brand. Other cult brands, often characterized by exclusive owners clubs and intensive social activities, are Ferrari, Ducati, Nautor Swan, Fender, Cohiba, and Breguet.[2] Saviolo, Stefania (2012). Lifestyle Brands - A Guide to Aspirational Marketing. Palgrave Macmillan. Benign cults Cult Brands fall into the category of benign cults which can be defined as a following where members are truly attached or intensely devoted to the product/service the brand provides. Benign Cults are not destructive and are welcoming of new members. In benign cults, human desires are fulfilled in a positive and unharmful way. Defining factors A brand can be defined as a cult brand if the following factors are present: # A superior level of customer loyalty is achieved # Brand loyalists perceive no true competitors to the brand as there are no substitutes for the \\"true\\" brand # Customers receive a sense of ownership with the brand # Loyalty is sustained over time (as opposed to fads which are unsustainable and short- lived) # Customers receive more than a product, they experience a lifestyle  Three stages of a cult brand  There are considered to be three stages of followers within a brand:McAlexander, James H., John W Schouten and Harold F. Koening, 2002 # It starts with the ‘brand following’, continued by the ‘connectedness’, with the third and final stage being that of ‘consumer conformity’. Brand following can be described as consumers that share the same strong affiliation in a brand, create a bond or ‘relationship’ on the simple basis that they share a common interest. At this point, there is more emphasis on the brand itself with an underlying relationship between common consumers arising. # The second stage being that of connectedness, can be described as the brand users developing a further sense of togetherness while also initiating a stronger bond in the way that they display a sort of empathy towards one another. In this stage, users are now becoming more interested in other uses, the culture of building a community, and the apparent bond that is forming within such a community. # The third and final stage of ‘consumer conformity’ suggests that there is no longer any real individual consumer, but a well formed group/population. It is said that people associate themselves with groups or other people to make sense of themselves or essentially to reach self-actualisation. Through doing so, one would feel a certain level of fulfilment that helps to energise a group, providing strength and loyalty to a brand. A good example of a strong brand community within a well-known cult brand is that of the ‘Hell’s Angels’. The Hell's Angels are so devoted to Harley Davidsons that it is said within their own wedding ceremonies they use the Harley owner's manual as a replacement for the bible. Advantages There are certainly many advantages to inducting your own brand into cult-like status, some of which add to company image, whereas others simply boost sales and revenue across the board. Well known advantages of having cult-like followers include perks such as: a loyal customer-base, low price sensitivity, improved competitiveness, and snowball advertising (Thompson, Scott A. and Rajiv K. Sinha, 2008). A loyal customer base means that through ‘thick and thin’, the consumer will stay by your side. A good example of this is when Nike, although being found out for exploiting cheap child labour in the Nike owned sweatshops, maintains a fanatical following from their loyal customer base. Another advantage previously mentioned is low price sensitivity. This means that consumers aren’t as conscious as to the price they are paying for their worshipped brand's goods. The consumers are able to pay more in a guilt- free manner without the need to shop for a cheaper and/or better alternative i.e. an elastic demand. The third mentioned advantage was that of the ‘improved competitiveness’ category. This means that as a result of a fanatical, loyal following, consumers see no real competition or substitute for their chosen brand/s. Linking back to low price sensitivity, consumers are willing to pay any price for the product and as a result, the companies do not partake in any sort of price war with competitors. The fourth and final mentioned advantage is ‘snowball advertising’. Here snowball advertising means that loyal customers spread word of praise for their chosen brand/s. Linking back to a “cultist recruitment stage” companies are able to let consumers broaden their demographic as people who hear positive word about a product are likely to go through at least one of the three cultist brand stages (Thompson, Scott A. and Rajiv K. Sinha, 2008). Examples The following emerged as cult brands because the brands sell lifestyles, whilst focusing a great deal on their customers. =Harley-Davidson= Harley-Davidson sells more than just motorcycles, it sells a passion and a lifestyle. The emergence of the Harley's Ownership Group or HOG was an opportunity for motorcycle enthusiasts to share experiences and passion for the sport  a factor which turned them into a lifestyle brand. This cult brand is a textbook example of guerrilla marketing. Harley-Davidson benefited from word-of-mouth advertising and relied on low- cost dealership promotions. =Vans= Vans is known for providing true skate culture. It markets itself as more than a company but a lifestyle. Very early on, Vans became actively involved in skate culture by hosting skateboarding days and sponsoring the famous Warped tour. Furthermore, in 2014, Vans opened a free-access skate complex in Huntington beach. Embracing skate culture to its fullest has brought Vans to prominence within skate society. =Lululemon= Lululemon is known for being far more than a simple spandex store. Whilst other brands built stores, Lululemon created a 'hub for healthy living'. Furthermore, the company regularly run yoga classes and appoint ambassadors that truly represent the Lululemon brand. Their enthusiasm enabled Lululemon to create a lifestyle based on healthy living and health enthusiasts. Selling the lifestyle constituted to a brand that made high priced, $98 yoga pants merchantable. =Apple= Apple has become the epitome of cult branding. The brand has a strong corporate culture of listening and receiving feedback, especially from the consumer's perspective. Apple recognizes its customer's appreciate innovation and the aesthetics of things. Apple's annual Macworld expo which includes workshops where the latest Apple products are discussed in an open environment allows Apple to create innovative products that customers greatly desire. For instance, the introduction of the iPod was created in ways that intertwined with human lifestyles and day-to-day activities. Furthermore, Apple slogans such as 'think different' pinpointed human desires to be different and to be part of a society. The slogan was a true manifestation of individual identity. =Oprah= Cult brands do not confine to products or services provided by businesses. Cult brands may include influential people, for instance, celebrities. The Oprah Winfrey Show rapidly flourished into a cult brand in 1986. Oprah's topic of discussion and debate were of great interest to her audience, while her advice and recommendations were found highly influential. For example, Oprah's book recommendations helped many novels become best sellers. Furthermore, her endorsement of the current president of the United States, Barack Obama's presidential election in 2008 proved efficacious.

Typical icon brands are luxury brands such as Chanel, Armani or Prada, or globally admired jewellers such as Bulgari, Cartier and Tiffany. Fashion brands can become iconic by delivering universal values and iconic elements that allow them to remain successful over time, like Ralph Lauren or Dolce&Gabbana.; The same ability to offer hetero-directed emotional benefits can be associated with only one product (Absolut Vodka) or a product line that insists on a very limited market segment, as in the event of Mini or Vespa. These are \\"icon products\\". Icon brands often come from a position of authority or cult brand, extending the range of products and their popularity outside a restricted circle of followers. ‘Icon Brand’ is also a name of a brand that produces goods for its customers, however despite its name the brand is irrelevant to the marketing term icon brand'. How Brands Become Icons Becoming an icon is reaching the top of the marketing world. Icon brands are the most successful, distinctive and famous of the brands. As a result, all brands seek to become icons in order to maximize their sales and reputation however only a few is able to become icons. Icons are summarised myths and these myths generally evoke the tension between people's individualistic ideas and the prevailing ideology of the society. Examples for icon brand myths include Nike's Air Jordan shoes as they symbolize individual achievement through perseverance and Harley Davidson, which symbolizes rebel bikers. As a consequence of these ideologies, desires to look for a myth start to emerge within people. This results in the creation of myth markets in which brands compete to become icons. Research shows that if marketed competently, any brand, regardless of its origins and sector can become an icon brand. Airey, in his book, states that in order to be called an icon, a brand must be simple, relevant, enduring, distinctive, memorable and adaptable. A good brand look and being able to satisfy public demands create attention from the public and help the brand establish strong and emotional bonds with its customers whereas simplicity makes the brand more memorable for the customer. Although they can endure wear by time, if an ideology shift occurs, the myth of the brand must be reinvented accordingly, in order to protect its status. Logo of the brand must be relevant and distinctive. It must be permanent as it helps to establish a good brand image. For example, Kellogg's’ logo has never changed since 1906, and this has created trust and loyalty for the brand. Status of a brand should be determined before attempting to develop it into an icon brand. There are two types of brands, as they possess either rational or emotional associations. Emotional brands include icon brands and cult brands. Big and emotional brands such as Nike are icon brands whereas cult brands are the smaller emotional brands. For example, somebody's favorite restaurant is a cult brand for him. On the other hand, rational brands are mass brands and niche brands. Large and rational brands such as Toyota are named as mass brands. A niche brand is the brand, which can be associated with tangible assets or values by a specific group. The Bank of New York can be regarded as an example for this type. According to Hollis, managers need to take the following five steps before attempting to turn their brands into icons: 1) Being loyal to the brand's purpose. 2) Scrutinizing the brand experience that the brand delivers. 3) Identifying any icon elements in the brand. 4) Being both authentic and modern at the same time. 5) Being focused. Characteristics of Icon Brands Icon brands have their own unique characters that differentiate them from other brands. They inspire passion and loyalty. They are not only instantly recognizable but also are admired and meaningful in a way for society. Meaning is very valuable for successful brands it is a way to communicate with the people. An example for this is Coca-Cola's depiction of happiness. By creating this image, Coca-Cola represents a fraction from the lives of its customers and as a result is able to get a powerful response from them. Iconic brands are successful as they develop powerful identity myths, which are delivered tangibly to make the myth more accessible. These powerful myths address people's desires and anxieties. Myths created by brands (generally through advertisements), lead people to believe that products embody the myth, which are ultimately consumed as those brands are purchased. In general, icon brands: 1) Focus on national contradictions.  Icons do not differentiate between different segments of consumers; they target the society as a whole through making a connection with national ideology. 2) Employ myths that direct culture – Icons lead pop- culture. They have high market-power because they create myths in order to repair culture when it is necessary. They give existing values new purposes. 3) Sound like a rebel – Icons target those who want to live according to alternative ideals rather than the national ideology in order to create a challenge to the national identity. Their purpose is to understand their point of views and to communicate people like a rebel. 4) Draw on political authority in order to rebuild the myth – Icons do not have a certain identity and as the ideology that surrounds them changes, they have to change and adopt. However, one thing that always stays is their political authority. Even if an icon's myth loses its importance, constituency always expects the icon to be as effective as always since they see icons as trustworthy and committed advocates. 5) Draw on cultural knowledge – Icon brands use culture in order to respond to the needs of customers in an emotional way. Examples of icon brands:  Nike  Apple  Harley Davidson  Oreos  Coca-Cola =Why Icon Brands are More Successful= Icon brands are very valuable for consumers as they have a crucial role in the society. A major reason for their success is not the possible services and benefits they can offer in terms of customer satisfaction or technology, but the fact that they have connections with culture. A proof of this is the fact that Coca-Cola and Nike are more popular and loved even than the United States according to a survey. Icon brands’ symbolic meaning is another factor that makes them more successful than the other brands. The symbols in logos such as Harley Davidson's eagle triggers imagination and connects it with ideas and values. Customer perceptions also favour icon brands, as a research states that icon brands have a higher top-of mind awareness. This shows that iconic brands are the first brands to come to a customer's mind when they think of a specific product. This familiarity makes the likelihood of purchase higher for icon brands than the other brands. Also if brand is an icon; people do not tend to doubt its quality and prestige. The Difference Between Brands and Icon Brands Icon brands are significantly different than other brands. They are built by different principles than those of conventional marketing, as their first priority is not customer satisfaction. For icon brands, what the brand stands for is more important than the performance of the brand. The main difference is that brands address rational world whereas icons address emotional world. Brands can also be associated with reliability, value, customer service, price and aesthetics. In contrast with this, icons can be associated with adventure, independence, originality, comfort and nostalgia. It is often a common mistake to think that identity brand and icon brand to have the same meaning. Identity brands target to facilitate character recognition by connecting to brand personalities. Their personality constantly changes as they aim to reflect societal changes. Examples for identity brands include American Express and Tango. Icon brands, on the other hand, have very strong identities that separate them from identity brands as they target emotions and culture instead. Iconic brands possess three major features that separate them from other big, well-known brands: 1\\\\. Cultural roots that allows them to connect with society's values. 2\\\\. They are easily recognizable due to their physical or symbolic features. 3\\\\. They have forceful stories and they always manage to remain loyal to their original values.

It ruled an independent principality in Tunis from 1059 to 1148 when they became governors of Ifriqiya under the Siculo- Norman kings and their annexions into the Kingdom of Africa, until the end of the dynasty in 1159 from the Almohade conquest. History The Khurasanid dynasty was founded during the 11th century by Abd al-Haqq ibn Abd al-Aziz ibn Khurasan, who was appointed as governor of Tunis by the Hammadid dynasty. This followed entreaties by locals seeking protection from raids by the Banu Hilal, as the Zirid dynasty sultan Al-Mu'izz ibn Badis offered none. Abd al-Haqq soon made the city an independent principality that would be governed by his family for almost a century. The fourth Khurasanid ruler, Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz (1107-1128), was considered by Ibn Khaldoun to be the most remarkable of his family. He built ramparts around Tunis to defend it and secured guarantees of safe passage for travellers from the Banu Hilal.Sir H. A. R. Gibb, The Encyclopaedia of Islam (1954), Brill Archive, page 60 The principality was annexed to the Hammadid kingdom in 1128, before it recovered its independence in 1148. After a period of Hammadid rule and a brief interregnum during which the people of Tunis sought to elect a new leader, Khurasanid rule was restored when Abu Bakr ibn Ismail was smuggled over the city walls at night in a basket. Seven months later he was drowned by his nephew Abd Allah ibn Abd al- Aziz, who succeeded him. Under Khurasanid rule, the small independent kingdom resumed foreign trade relations and people enjoyed unprecedented prosperity. The city was embellished with new buildings, including a fortified palace, and the outer defenses were strengthened. In 1159, the last Khurasanid ruler, Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz, was ousted by the Almohad Caliphate and sent into exile. The Almohads annexed the whole Ifriqiya to its empire, putting an end to Khurasanid rule.Martijn Theodoor Houtsma, E.J.

His scientific works are in the areas of theory and history of sociology and the disciplinary fields of modern sociology. The focus of the research interests of Fotev is the nature of sociology as a multiple paradigm science. Another major theme is the dialogue as a base and horizon of multiple paradigm sociology. Georgy Fotev has publications in the fields of historical sociology, sociology of politics, ethnosociology, the crisis of legitimacy, sociology of values, etc. His books \\"The long night of communism in Bulgaria\\" and \\"Bulgarian melancholy\\" throw light on the dramatic fate of the Bulgarian national society. Georgy Fotev was Minister of Education and Science (1991–1992). He is professor emeritus of New Bulgarian University. In 2003 he was awarded the Distinguished Service Award from the American University in Bulgaria. Biography Georgy Fotev was born on 24 August 1941 in the village of Dimitrovche, Svilengrad Municipality, Bulgaria. His life under the Communist regime was full of hardships. His father being a political emigrant in West Germany, he and his family were interned in 1950. After completing military service in the labour forces, for years he was prohibited from applying to study in any higher education institution. Repressed by the Communist regime, he was employed as a manual worker for several years. He eventually graduated in philosophy at Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridsky in 1968. On political grounds, for years he was denied the right to do academic work. In 1976 he started work as a research fellow at the Institute of Sociology of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. In 1989 he became a professor. In 1991 he was Minister of Science and Education. In 1992–2003 he was director of the Institute of Sociology at BAS. President of the Bulgarian Sociological Association . National Programme Director for the European Values Study. Georgy Fotev is the author of more than 250 scientific publications, many of them published abroad. His works have come out in more than 15 countries. The Senate of the European Academy of Sciences elected him active member in 1993, and he is also member of many other international scientific organizations. Honorary professor of New Bulgarian University. (2012).[5] Fulbright scholar at Duke University (USA) (1997–1998). Member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and Arts. In 2013 he restored the Institute of Sociology at this academy. Member of the Editorial Advisory Board of the journal Polish Sociological Review since 2000 as well as of the editorial boards of other academic journals. Vice chairman of the board of directors of American University in Bulgaria from 2000 to 2003. Member of the University Council of that university from 2003[6]. Member of the board of trustees of New Bulgarian University since 1994[7]. He is married and has a son and daughter. Scientific contributions =History of sociology= Georgy Fotev's studies in the field of history of sociology encompass the classics of sociology and the development of the Western sociological tradition from Antiquity to the end of the 20th century. His books The Sociological Theories of E. Durkheim, M. Weber, and V. Pareto. A Critical Comparative Analysis, Principles of Positivist Sociology, and many of his articles and studies are devoted to classical names in sociology. In his monumental two-volume work History of Sociology (two editions) he makes the distinction between proto-sociology and the development of sociology as a differentiated and poly-paradigmatic science. =Historical sociology= Fotev's works on historical sociology, in particular his Social Reality and Imagination. A Sociological Study on the Renaissance, are of path-breaking importance for the Bulgarian sociological tradition. The concept of historical sociology rethinks the established disciplinary perspectives and status of this field within the ensemble of sociological sub-disciplines. =Crisis of legitimacy and civil society= The unfolding project of modernity is linked to periodic crises of legitimacy, which, in late modernity, create the impression of a permanent crisis. After the collapse of the totalitarian system, Fotev published the first book in Bulgaria specially devoted to the topic of civil society; in it, he explains why this concept was taboo in totalitarian society. =Ethnosociology, sociology of religions= Georgy Fotev is the founder in Bulgaria of the disciplines of ethnosociology and sociology of religions. He has rethought fundamental concepts in these fields, such as “ethnos”, and has grounded an original thesis regarding the other ethnos. His contributions in this area go beyond the boundaries of Bulgarian national sociology. =Sociology of politics= In his large-scale sociological treatise Limits of Politics and in his books The Meaning of Politics and Ethnicity, Religion and Politics, he has treated of fundamental problems of politics. His studies in this field hold a major place in the author's work. =Dialogical sociology= Georgy Fotev has grounded and elaborated an ambitious project in modern sociology: he sees dialogue as being the foundation of the poly-paradigmatic sociology, which otherwise would be doomed to constant internecine feuding due to the incommensurable elements contained in the various sociological paradigms. The author refers to a dialogical reason that can be an alternative and opposition to the century-long domination of monological reason. As a concept, dialogue is something more than conversation, discussion, debate, etc.[12] =Disciplinary structure of sociology= In contrast with certain influential views regarding the chaos of scientific disciplines, the end of disciplinary knowledge, and methodological anarchy, Georgy Fotev proposes the thesis that scientific cognition would be impossible outside a certain disciplinary framework, which, however, must be different from the framework of monodisciplinary sciences, respectively, of sociology as a monodisciplinary science. There also exist interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and transdisciplinary sciences.[13] =The Night of Communism= In his monographical work The Long Night of Communism in Bulgaria[14] and other publications, Fotev has studied the formation, functioning and implosion of the totalitarian Communist system. As the author puts it, these analyses resemble a surrealistic sociology of a Utopia. =Bulgarian melancholy= The eponymous book is a large-scale attempt at sociological characterization of the Bulgarian national community in the age of modernization. Melancholy is viewed in the perspective of phenomenological sociology.[15] =Axiology and sociology of values= In the author's works devoted to sociology of values and axiology, he has elaborated a complex theory of values, including the distinction between value, fact, and norm, the crisis of values, the revaluation of values, the values functioning in present-day Bulgarian society, etc. [16] Publications =Monographic works= *Социологическите теории на Е.

Performances in recent years have been given by high quality professional musicians such as The Bristol Ensemble, Lore Lixenberg [mezzo-soprano], Sarah Leonard [soprano] with Stephen Gutman [piano], Zarah Hible [mezzo-soprano], Mary Barrett [clarinet], Roger Huckle [violin and viola], Madeleine Mitchell [Violin] and Charlotte Newstead [soprano]. Some composer members also perform and accompany on the piano. The current Chairman is Jolyon Laycock. Concerts in recent times have included piano triettes [three people at one piano], a choral event, song recitals and specialist concerts focusing on a particular instrument. To this end, two of the concerts have been called 'Cello on the Edge' [Alison Gillies - cello soloist] and 'Clarinet on the Edge'. In 2017 the Alliance collaborated with violinist Madeleine Mitchell leading to the composition and performance of ten new works for violin and piano by Severnside composers. In 2018 the Alliance worked with Gemini Ensemble in the creation of \\"Space-Time-Sounds\\" featuring coloratura soprano Sarah Leonard . Concert venues have included Bristol Music Club, Colston Hall, Arnos Vale Anglican chapel, St Paul's Church in Clifton and the Christian Community in Stroud. http://www.severnsidecomposersalliance.co.uk Included in the programmes are classic examples of 20th century music by composers such as John Cage, George Crumb, Arnold Schoenberg and Vaughan Williams. Several composers have released their own CDs, with the Alliance having also having made some recordings. Composer members come from varying professional fields and activities that include academia, performance, arts administration, school teaching, private teaching, workshop leadership and composition as their major activity. Some composers have been commissioned inside and beyond Severnside Composers Alliance, whilst others have not. A Severnside Composers Alliance concert is an opportunity to experience and appreciate music by composers living in the West of England region. Musical styles are varied, with diatonic and free and experimental harmonies and melodic lines intermingling within each concert. Composer talks are also a feature of the alliance's activities, with opportunities to hear analysis of the composers' thought processes, structure, form and interests in composing their music.

It left the Marton–New Plymouth Line at Waipuku, 9 km north of Stratford. A \\"Mount Egmont branch\\" line of about 9 miles (14 km) was authorised by the Railways Authorisation Act, 1904. Work started in 1906, and the first 9.6 km section was handed over to the New Zealand Railways Department by 1 April 1908. The line was extended to about 11 km from the main line by 1912-13, but an upper quarry extension to an elevation of 930m (which would have made it the highest line in New Zealand by over 100m) was not proceeded with. As the readily available rock was worked out by 1937 and it was cheaper to supply ballast from riverbed plants, most of the branch closed in 1938 and the remainder, which had been unused for years, in 1951. Between the junction and the edge of Egmont National Park, few signs of the branch remain. Within the park, the old roadbed has been converted into a walking track maintained by the Department of Conservation. Various relics of the railway and quarrying activity are visible from the track, most notably the substantial remnants of the ballast crusher.

It contains a number of Old High German elements, because it was probably based on a Middle Franconian original.M.C. van den Toorn, et al., Geschiedenis van de Nederlandse taal (1997), 41, with reference to Gysseling 1980; Quak 1981; De Grauwe 1979, 1982 Very little remains of them. The psalms were named after a manuscript which has not come down to us, but out of which scholars believe the surviving fragments must have been copied. This manuscript was once owned by Liège Canon Arnold Wachtendonck. He was supervisor over Munsterbilzen Abbey, where he found the manuscript. The surviving fragments are handwritten copies made by the Renaissance scholar Justus Lipsius in the sixteenth century. Lipsius made a number of separate copies of apparently the same material and these versions do not always agree. In addition, scholars conclude that the numerous errors and inconsistencies in the fragments point not only to some carelessness or inattentiveness by the Renaissance scholars but also to errors in the now lost manuscript out of which the material was copied. The language of the Psalms suggests that they were originally written in the 10th century. A number of editions exist, among others by the 19th- century Dutch philologist Willem Lodewijk van Helten and, more recently, the diplomatic edition by the American historical linguist Robert L. Kyes (1969) and the critical edition by the Dutch philologist Arend Quak (1981).

Pub:Michelin, 2011, This beach is one of sixty nine blue flag beaches (2012) in the Algarve  Description  The beach is also sometimes referred to locally as Praia dos Três Penecos (beach of triple rocks). This because of the location of three large isolated rock formations which dominate the line of the horizon from the beach. The tops of the formations are dotted with plants resistant to salt spray, such as Wormleaf Saltwort and Rock Samphire, which survive and grow on the rocks because the tops are well above the high tide level. Above the small beach, the cliff tops are populated by pine trees and examples of the Dwarf Fan Palms, the only palm native to Europe. = Access and Facilities = To reach the sands there are a set of wooden steps from the parking area making access to this beach difficult for the disabled. The beach facilities include a bar and restaurant although this is closed in the winter. There are toilets and a shower. During the summer season the beach is patrolled by lifeguards. Also in the summer season there are Loungers, and parasols which can be hired. At the back of the beach there is a large informal parking area although in the summer parking is strictly controlled in order to minimise destabilization of the cliffs. Whilst on this beach it is advised to take caution when near the base of the cliffs as there is a danger of falling rocks and stones from above. At the eastern end of the main beach there is a small satellite beach which has difficult access across the rocky foreshore but is characterised with many interesting rock formations and fossilised bedrock.

He was selected with the first overall pick in the 2013 AFL draft by the Greater Western Sydney Giants, but was traded to the Western Bulldogs following the 2014 season. In 2016, he helped the Bulldogs win their first premiership since 1954. After struggling with injuries and mental health, Boyd announced his retirement from AFL football in May 2019. Early life Boyd attended Luther College in Croydon Hills, Victoria and played junior football for the Norwood Football Club. Playing for Eastern Ranges in the TAC Cup from 2011 to 2013, Boyd was the competition's leading goal kicker in 2012 and later performed well for Vic Metro at the 2012 national carnival. In April 2013, Boyd visited Copenhagen in his mother's native Denmark for three days as part of the AIS-AFL Academy tour. AFL career =GWS Giants (2014)= Boyd was selected with the first overall pick in the 2013 AFL draft by the Greater Western Sydney Giants. In his reserves debut on 1 March 2014, Boyd kicked three goals and demonstrated his versatility with a stint in the ruck. He went on to make his senior debut on 20 April 2014 in the Giants' 137–72 loss to the Adelaide Crows; he managed just five disposals and didn't score. He finished the 2014 season with eight goals in nine games. =Western Bulldogs (2015–2019)= Boyd playing for the Bulldogs in a pre-season match in February 2017 Trade request On 13 October 2014, Boyd requested a trade to the Western Bulldogs. This development was made even more remarkable considering that only days prior, Bulldogs' captain Ryan Griffen had requested a trade away from the club and Brendan McCartney had resigned as Senior Coach. Despite the Giants initial stance claiming that Boyd would not be traded under any circumstances, two days after Boyd handed in his trade request, he was traded to the Bulldogs in exchange for Griffen and pick 6 in the 2014 AFL draft. He later signed a seven-year, $7 million contract with the Bulldogs. 2015 season In his debut game for the Bulldogs on 4 April 2015, Boyd was well- held by Eagle Jeremy McGovern but managed to kick an important late goal to help his new club secure a Round 1 win over the West Coast Eagles. On 22 June 2015, he earned the AFL's Rising Star nomination for Round 12 after kicking four goals and recording eight marks in a win over the Brisbane Lions. Following a poor showing in the Bulldogs' Round 16 game against Geelong, Boyd was dropped from the senior squad and failed to be recalled to the AFL level for the rest of the season, playing out the year with the team's VFL side. He helped Footscray reach the VFL finals, kicking two goals in the team's semi- final loss to Essendon. 2016 season Boyd's right shoulder was a constant problem for him throughout the 2016 season after he first aggravated it in the club's round four game against Carlton. The injury kept him on the sidelines for much of the first half of the season, after which he returned with the Bulldogs' VFL side, Footscray. He was in line to receive a recall to the AFL side for Round 15, but a drunken, \\"violent\\" altercation with teammate Zaine Cordy set him back. He was suspended indefinitely by the club on 30 June 2016 and fined $5,000. Boyd responded with a four-goal haul in Footscray's 12-point loss to Coburg on July 2. He returned to the AFL side in Round 17 and remained there for the rest of the year. He showed promise when he kicked three goals in the Bulldogs' loss to Geelong in Round 19. He went on to help the Bulldogs reach their first VFL/AFL grand final since 1961. In the 2016 Grand Final, Boyd completed a coming-of-age finals series with his aerial work highly influential, finishing the match with eight marks (six contested) and three goals. His third goal late in the fourth quarter from the centre square sealed the win for the Bulldogs, as they defeated the Sydney Swans by 22 points to become the first team to win a premiership from seventh on the ladder. 2017 season Despite enjoying a breakthrough finals series in 2016, Boyd struggled to reproduce that form in 2017. Coach Luke Beveridge admitted he saw Boyd as a ruckman more than a key forward at this stage of his career. He kicked seven goals from 11 games, and averaged 20 hit-outs a game, before enduring a poor run of injury, missing round 12 with a back injury and rounds 14 and 15 with a calf injury. On 5 July 2017, Boyd was provided a leave of absence from the Bulldogs to receive treatment for clinical depression. 2018 season Boyd's 2018 season was cut short by a back injury, as he was ruled out for the rest of the season after round 18. 2019 season On 16 May 2019, having not played at the top level since round 18 in 2018 amid battles with injury and mental health, Boyd announced his immediate retirement from the AFL. Over his AFL career, he never played more than 15 games in a season.

The episode was written by Brett Matthews and Elisabeth R. Finch and directed by Michael Allowitz. Plot After Stefan (Paul Wesley) lost his memory, Damon (Ian Somerhalder) tries to help him remember. He remembers the date and where he is, but he cannot remember who he is, who the people are around him, or even that he is a vampire. Damon presents Stefan with his diaries to jog his memory with, but he still has no recollection of his past. Elena (Nina Dobrev) meets the two of them later to find out that Damon did not tell Stefan about her yet. Stefan is conquered by his thirst and follows a waitress but Damon gets there in time before he hurts her. After the incident, they take Stefan to the family crypt where there are fewer people around. Damon gets a phone call from Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) and leaves, leaving Stefan alone with Elena. Elena tries to help Stefan remember by taking him to the school where they reenact the moment they met. Stefan still cannot remember, so Elena takes him to the bridge where he saved Matt's (Zach Roerig) life and she became a vampire. He does not recall any of the events. The two of them come very close, but before they kiss, Elena tells him that she is with Damon, something that makes Stefan angry and leaves. Matt experiences episodes of losing time, so he sets up cameras all over the house to discover what is happening. He also calls Jeremy to ask his help since he can't contact Bonnie (Kat Graham). When Jeremy sees how desperate Matt is and that everyone is looking for Bonnie for help, he decides to tell everyone that Bonnie is dead despite her wishes and he calls Damon. Matt later discovers in one of the videos that he has a passenger inside of him who warns him that his friends will come looking for the knife and he has to protect it otherwise they will kill him. Damon is back to the Salvatore house where Jeremy informs him about Bonnie. Damon tries to tell Elena but stops when she tells him that she has lost Stefan and he decides to help her find him. Stefan is at the Remembrance Day celebration at the cemetery where Caroline (Candice Accola) finds him. Stefan can feel that he can trust her but he attacks Jesse (Kendrick Sampson). Caroline stops him, gives Jesse her blood to heal him and then compels him to forget. Stefan returns home, burns his journals and packs his things to leave. He is uninterested in continuing to live in the Salvatore home and continue his life as the \\"old\\" Stefan. Before he goes, he makes a promise to Damon and Elena that he will not become the Ripper again and that Caroline will be checking up on him. After Stefan's departure, Damon finally tells Elena that Bonnie is dead. Elena, Damon, Caroline, Matt and Jeremy make a private ceremony for Bonnie in the forest to say their goodbyes. Bonnie is there and she talks to all of them through Jeremy who can see and hear her. While this is happening, Tyler (Michael Trevino) appears and Caroline runs towards him laughing through her tears. The episode ends with Jesse and Maxfield (Rick Cosnett) who finds evidence of vampire blood in Jesse's system. He explains to him that this might have happened because someone tried to heal him or because someone wanted to make him a vampire. Maxfield guesses that what happened must be the first and he also explains that having vampire blood in your system is the first step to become a vampire. Jesse looks on, confused, as Maxfield says: \\"And this is the second,\\" while he injects Jesse with a syringe filled with yellow liquid that kills him.

Leigh Raines of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4/5 stating that \\"More than halfway through \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" I was moderately bored by this week's The Vampire Diaries. [...] Then Jeremy revealed a secret we've known since The Vampire Diaries Season 4 finale and everything went to pieces.\\" Nad from Nad's Reviews gave a B+ rate to the episode saying that he enjoyed it and that it was a solid and highly effective hour of The Vampire Diaries. \\"For the first time in a long time, I actually find myself looking forward to catching up with the gang every week.\\" Stephanie Flasher of TV After Dark gave an A- rate to the episode saying that it was quite an emotional one. \\"Overall, it's a pretty good episode. I wish there would have been more development in the Silas story line, but gave Bonnie a true memorial that the character truly deserved, even though she'll still be on the show.\\" Christopher Monigle of Star Pulse gave a good review to the episode saying that the show \\"excels at moving farewell scenes\\" and \\"The writing’s really, really moving sometimes.\\" Stephanie Hall of KSiteTV also gave a good review to the episode saying that it didn't fail to entertain. \\"I hesitate to call \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" a filler episode because there were monumental moments moving the greater story forward, but for all intents and purposes it was an episode devised for the sake of season one nostalgia.\\" Crystal Bell from Wetpaint said that the episode was \\"a roller coaster of emotions\\" and \\"had a little bit of everything.\\" \\"If there was one blip in this otherwise perfect episode it was Matt's storyline, which frankly, isn't as compelling as we'd like it to be.\\" Despite the good reviews, Carrie Raisler from The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review saying that the episode was all over the place and finally rating it with a C+.

Both are the members of ASEAN and enjoy good relations. Although the relations become strained in late 2016 due to the Rohingya people issues, the relations remained stable after the meeting between both countries' armed forces chiefs to play down the issues. Myanmar currently has an embassy in Kuala Lumpur, and Malaysia has an embassy in Yangon.  History  The relations between the two countries were established on 1 March 1957 and the first Burma mission at the legation level was set up in Kuala Lumpur in June 1959 and later raised to the embassy level. During Burmese King Bayintnaung’s period,Malaysia was a part of Taungoo Empire until 1590 AD.  Economic relations  From 2011–2012, the total of Myanmar exports to Malaysia worth over US$152.038 million while the imports from Malaysia during the same year worth over US$303.410 million and the total trade reached US$455.448 million. Myanmar’s ten main exports items to Malaysia were rubber, fish, prawns, sesame, clothes, timber, tamarind, green gram, pigeon peas, and corn while its ten main imports items from Malaysia such as oil, raw plastics ware, petroleum and chemical products, metal construction appliances, wires, medical products, electrical and electronic machineries, mechanical appliances and crops oil. Beside that, Myanmar is currently need more investment from others country such as Malaysia to develop the country economy. In 2017, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in healthcare deal was signed by Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council (MHTC) to promoting healthcare services to Myanmar citizens in Malaysia which will also encourage knowledge and skill transfer between doctors of the two countries.  Rohingya refugee issues  Following the Rakhine State riots since 2012, thousands of Rohingya people have been exodus from Myanmar and this sparked the Rohingya refugee crisis in 2015 to Myanmar neighbouring countries. = Malaysia protest to Myanmar = Due to the unstoppable human exodus from Myanmar until 2016 which also have since affecting Malaysia, Prime Minister Najib Razak decide to join a rally to Myanmar embassy with the protestors gathered in Titiwangsa Stadium of Kuala Lumpur. The event was organised by Malay Muslim groups, political parties as well non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in 4 December to urge Myanmar to stop of what been labelled by Malaysia as a “genocide to Muslim as well to its minority people” and calling the international community to put a pressure into Myanmar. During the rally, the Prime Minister said: The Malaysian Prime Minister mocked the Myanmar Nobel laureates winner Aung San Suu Kyi for her inaction over the issues, as well issuing a response via Twitter in which he stated that “it was not my intention to interfere in Myanmar’s internal affairs but that the cruelty against Rohingya had gone too far”. The Malaysian side also cancelling two football friendly matches of their U-22 team with Myanmar U-23 as well previously threatening to pull out their team from the 2016 AFF Championship to protest Myanmar as a Group B host where Malaysia were placed in the same group after persistent calls from the country Muslim individuals, groups and political parties to boycott Myanmar for their alleged persecution to the Rohingya people. Despite various questions and conspiracy arise from the Malaysian public, the Malaysian Foreign Affairs Ministry view the recent rally joined by the Malaysian Prime Minister as legal due to the spillover effects which became a security concern for Malaysia with the continuous arrival of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar and explained that the matter is “not just about religious issues but humanitarian concerns”. The Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) said earlier following the decision of Myanmar government to halt its workers prior to the ongoing issues, the move will affect Malaysia industry. However, this was denied by Malaysian Deputy Human Resources Minister as they can look up on other source of labours from other countries. = Myanmar reactions to the protest = As a reaction, Myanmar nationalists, led by activist and monk Sayadaw Pamaukkha, began to protest against the Malaysian Prime Minister's decision to join the rally. They suggested that Malaysia should “take all Rohingya people in their country and integrate into the Malaysian society if they (the Malaysians) love the Rohingya so much as we the Myanmar people don't want our race, religion and nation from disappearing due to the fast growth of Rohingya population” (with Myanmar previous junta administration labelling the Rohingya as immigrants from Bangladesh especially during the Operation King Dragon with many are claimed to be insurgents and illegal immigrants who fled from the Bangladesh Liberation War). The group also remind Myanmar citizen in Malaysia to be careful as some extreme group and NGOs in the country have inciting hatred to Malaysians to hate Myanmar people, adding that “they would organise a similar protest in their country to condemn the Malaysian action but will not burning the Malaysian flag as been did by some of the Malaysian protesters to Myanmar flag in recent rally”. Earlier before Malaysian Prime Minister join the rally, Myanmar President's Office Deputy-Director and Spokesman for Myanmar President Htin Kyaw, Zaw Htay urge Malaysia to “respecting their sovereign affairs and to stop interfering in their country affairs”. Zaw Htay has announced that the Government of Myanmar would issue an official response objecting to Malaysian Prime Minister participation in the rally and said “Our new government is working on a solution to the Rohingya issues and I want to say again that the Malaysian government should respect the ASEAN charter”. Adding that the rally that was supported by Malaysian leader “could stoke religious extremism and amounted to vote-seeking ahead of a Malaysian election expected soon” as well criticising Malaysian media for giving a bias report and playing up the Rohingya issues. Malaysian ambassador to Myanmar were summoned previously since the Malaysian government raise their concern on the issues although Myanmar did not yet issued any instructions on a change to diplomatic posture with Malaysia. As a condemnation to the Malaysian Prime Minister action, Myanmar protesters gather in Mahabandoola Park of Yangon on 5 December. The Myanmar National Monk Union also release a statement that: With other monk members issuing a letter: And another Myanmar protest leader rejecting international pressure on Myanmar as suggested by the Malaysian Prime Minister. On a statement, he said: Advisor to former President Thein Sein, Ko Ko Hlaing accused Malaysian Prime Minister of exploiting the issue to divert public attention away from corruption allegations levelled against him. While the Myanmar Committee for the Protection of Race and Religion of Ma Ba Tha slammed Malaysian Prime Minister action for meddling and “insulting Myanmar and Aung San Suu Kyi’s handling of the affairs” with the group leaders said a letter will be translated and delivered to the Malaysian embassy in Yangon. Myanmar journalist also explained that Suu Kyi are not ignoring the Rohingya plight as been accused by Najib, but the new administration especially with her limited powers as well with many other Myanmar internal issues hardened the process much over when Rakhine State politicians continue to disapprove the attempts of State Counsellor's (headed by Suu Kyi) handling of the situation. Prior to the ongoing issues with Malaysia especially due to the demonstrations against Myanmar, the Myanmar Labour Department indefinitely suspended sending of migrant workers to the country beginning from 7 December. Until 5 May 2017, there were still no green light from the Myanmar side to allow their workers to go to Malaysia as there are many reported cases where Myanmar workers have been killed in Malaysia; although traffickers continue to smuggle Myanmar workers to the country. = Views from other Malaysian public, experts and United Nations rapporteur on the issues = Earlier in October 2016, a Malaysian Malay newspaper of Harian Metro reported on the behaviour of Rohingya in Malaysia who had been using government land without permission, operating business without licence and using public parking spaces like their own land for their business storage with the activities have been ongoing for more than 10 years ago without any action from the Malaysian local administration government. The behaviour of Rohingya immigrants and asylum seekers was heavily criticised by many of the Malaysians public especially from the majority Malays with some commenting the news release in Facebook as “no wonder they been discriminated in Myanmar with this kind of behaviour”, with other chided the situation as “a result from religious organisations inside the country who like to urged the government to take every Muslim refugees from war-torn countries just because of the same religion and under the excuse of humanity without checking the background of those refugees first” as well some said that “this country will soon be overtaken by these refugees and we will become a minority in our own land although they have the same religion with us”. Thailand-based expert on ASEAN affairs, Kavi Chongkittavorn describe Malaysian Prime Minister actions “as an attempt to gain support from his country’s Muslim community and that his concern could be more effectively registered through discreet diplomacy than openly be made as the Myanmar government who will be held to consequences for what is happening after the accusations by the Malaysian leader as the issues is an internal problem that has regional implications”. United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association from Kenya, Maina Kiai lauded the Malaysian government efforts to fight for the marginalised Rohingya community but remind the government to look to their own minority groups first who been discriminated in the country before trying to look up on other countries issues. The Malaysian government humanity sincerity are also been questioned by reporters in their own country for their sudden help as previously Malaysian authorities is seen rejecting the Rohingya to set foot on Malaysian soils while their boat is drifting in the sea after escaping from Myanmar. In addition, the poor condition of the already available Rohingya in Malaysia with most of them are unable to study or send their children to school, no access to healthcare, and their new children who born in the country are unregistered, unable to work legally and vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous employers as Malaysia is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention have mostly been criticised by journalists and non- governmental organisations in the country. The government also been alleged as bias as they “only selecting discriminated people who are Muslims”, as if they are not Muslims the government will not care them at all as been exampled from the Vietnamese boat people incident where they only been put in Bidong Island and shooed away as the Vietnamese are looked more like a Chinese and not Muslim with the Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister at the time Mahathir Mohamad threatened to use force to shoot them if they continuously reaching Malaysian shore as Mahathir worried the increase of non-Muslims population in Malaysia will threatened the majority Malay and Muslim population”. The Malaysian government also been alleged as trying to make the Rohingya as part of Malaysian citizens to use them to vote the ruling party for the next Malaysian general election as been exampled from the Moro Muslim refugees in the state of Sabah who fleeing the political uncertainty in the Philippines in the 1970s when they been registered as a citizen and used as a voter to topple the state government who are Christian at the time and to maintain the ruling Muslim party to administer the state. The issues of Rohingya refugees test Malaysia's chairmanship on ASEAN as previously Malaysia together with Indonesia and Thailand rejecting boats carrying Rohingya asylum seekers from reaching their shores mainly due to domestic concerns on illegal immigrants. But with the criticism from United Nations human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein to the three countries for turning away the asylum seekers, the Malaysian and Indonesian leaders decide to hold a meeting where the two finally agreed to provide temporary shelter for the Rohingya under \\"humanitarian concerns\\" under a term that the international community should assist to repatriate and resettle these refugees to other third world countries soon as Malaysia is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention with the United Nations been told not to use Malaysia's compassion to allowing more refugees to seek shelter in the country as it is also against the long-term solution for Malaysia to repatriate illegal immigrants in the country. Furthermore, the ethnic conflicts and violence between Myanmar ethnic groups brought by the asylum seekers has threatened the safety of Malaysian citizens in their own homeland. The continuous acceptance of Muslim refugees from unstable countries under the excuse of “humanitarian concerns and religious sympathy” especially during Mahathir administration of strong Islamic foreign policy that was continued until this day by Najib received backlash from the Malaysian general public as this has been perceive that the government are putting more priority to foreigners than its own citizens suffering especially with the rampant crimes and social problems committed by the asylum seekers in Malaysia. = Attempts to play down the issues = The Malaysian government then sent the Malaysian Armed Forces chief to meet the Myanmar Tatmadaw chief and Myanmar President to repair the already “fraught relations between the two countries as a result from the Rohingya issues” with the Myanmar President Office describe the strained relations as a result of “false news”. In response to the ongoing disagreement between both countries, a group of Muslim organisation in Myanmar sent an open letter to the Malaysian government expressing their disapproval of the country's response, stating “that is doing more harm than good for Muslim people in Myanmar”. The letter reads: Malaysia Foreign Minister Anifah Aman has prepared to meet Myanmar's State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi to determine how it can assist to help Myanmar to stop the continuous violence as Myanmar previously has called on other ASEAN countries to participate in the recent developments in their country including Rakhine State where the Rohingya are located following Myanmar participation in the ASEAN foreign ministers meeting led by Malaysia. Earlier, Malaysia's Foreign Ministry propose to hold an emergency meeting relating about the Rohingya in Laos but were rejected by the country. The Malaysian Foreign Deputy Minister also clarified that despite the issues, the relations between the two countries are still normal.

The magazine has been praised by a number of different architects and publications. History A group of architecture students and junior faculty from the University of Stuttgart established ARCH+ in 1967 and its first issue appeared in January of the following year. Despite forming concurrent to the student protest movement of 1968, the magazine's content was not explicitly political in its first years. Early issues focused on technocratic aspects of architecture and urbanism, such as planning theory, semiotics, mathematics, and cybernetics. In the early 1970s, growing ideological divides among the publication's contributors led to the establishment of splinter editorial groups in West Berlin and Aachen. A new wave of editors effected a politicization of the magazine, which came to focus increasingly on the sociological issues surrounding the built environment. While this progressive political orientation has stayed with the magazine until today, subsequent decades saw an increase in attention to other aspects of the field, including: aesthetics and postmodernism in the late 1970s, the legacy of the modern movement in the mid-1980s, and high-tech architecture in the 1990s. Since 2000, ARCH+ has expanded its scope of activities to include exhibition design, exhibition catalogs, a lecture and conversation series, research projects, and competitions. In 2010, ARCH+ released one of its first fully bilingual publications, Post-Oil City, which was followed by its first bilingual issue, Think Global, Build Social!, in 2013. The issue also served as a catalog for an eponymous exhibition at the German Architecture Museum in Frankfurt am Main. Content ARCH+ is one of the largest and oldest periodicals in Germany that focuses on architectural history and theory. Every issue is devoted to a particular subject, place, or theme; recent topics include contemporary Japanese architecture, social housing design, service architecture, and shrinking cities. Contemporary buildings are featured to illustrate the topic, while timelines and reference projects are meant to situate the topic in broader historical and cultural contexts. Issues regularly include long-form essays by academics and architects as well. The Zeitung section of every issue features book and exhibition reviews.

A definitive diagnosis so far can be made only post-mortem. However, an increasing number of former players are reporting symptoms of CTE. You can read NFL100 post about NFL and CTE According to 2017 study on brains of deceased gridiron football players, 99% of tested brains of NFL players, 88% of CFL players, 64% of semi-professional players, 91% of college football players, and 21% of high school football players had various stages of CTE. Other common injuries include, injuries of legs, arms, and lower back. Players affected Many players affected by CTE have been professional players, but others have also been affected by or live with the possibility of having CTE. In July 2011, Colts tight end John Mackey died after several years of deepening symptoms of frontotemporal dementia. The Boston University School of Medicine BUSM was reported to be planning to examine his brain for signs of CTE.Cowherd, Kevin, \\"Mackey leaves enduring legacy on and off field\\", Baltimore Sun, July 07, 2011. Retrieved 2011-09-11. The Brain Bank found CTE in his brain post-mortem. On July 27, 2012, an autopsy report concluded that the former Atlanta Falcons safety Ray Easterling, who died from suicide in April 2012, had CTE.\\"Autopsy: Former Falcons safety Ray Easterling had brain disease associated with concussions\\", CBS/AP, July 27, 2012.\\"Ray Easterling autopsy found signs of brain disease CTE\\", New York Times, July 27, 2012. On February 4, 2016, an autopsy report from Massachusetts confirmed CTE in Ken Stabler's brain after his death. Stabler, an NFL MVP and Hall of Famer, was diagnosed with high Stage 3 CTE. Stage 4 is the most aggressive stage of the disease. Heisman Trophy winner and former NFL All-Pro Bo Jackson said in a 2017 interview with USA Today that if he had known about the risks associated with CTE, he would never have played football, and he discourages his children from doing so. In late 2017, former Kansas City Chiefs running back Larry Johnson reported having symptoms akin to Aaron Hernandez, including memory blanks, suicidal thoughts and thoughts of committing violent acts. Although there is no way to positively diagnose CTE before death, Johnson believes he is living with the disease.  Former players with CTE confirmed post-mortem  A definitive test currently can be made only by examining the brain tissue of a deceased victim. As the families of many deceased players wish to keep their medical information private, the following list is incomplete. A brain injury study conducted at the Boston University School of Medicine showed that 33 of 34 players tested post-mortem showed clear signs of CTE, and additional players have so far been confirmed with CTE separately. A new list released in November 2016 mentions CTE in 90 of 94 brains of former and deceased NFL players. In July 2017, a new study showed that 110 of 111 brains examined showed signs of CTE. * Jovan Belcher * Forrest Blue * Bill Bryant * Lew Carpenter * Ronnie Caveness * Dwight Clark * Daniel Colchico * Lou Creekmur * Art DeCarlo * Shane Dronett * Dave Duerson * Pete Duranko * Ray Easterling\\"Ray Easterling autopsy found signs of brain disease CTE\\", New York Times, July 27, 2012. * Frank Gifford * Cookie Gilchrist * John GrimsleyCase Study: John Grimsley, Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy.

A typical diagnosis of ALS has primarily been based on the symptoms and signs the physician observes in the patient and a series of tests to rule out other diseases and therefore, prior to the discovery of CTE as a phenomenon in ex-American football players, many CTE cases were diagnosed as ALS. The testing of CTE in deceased ex-NFL players began only after the disease was first diagnosed, in 2002, in the brain tissue of Mike Webster.Late Steelers great Webster's case launched the CTE brain debate Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 2013-05-14 After then, testing became common practice only gradually. A cohort mortality study run by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) examined 3,349 NFL players who played at least five full seasons from 1959 to 1988. Findings showed that while NFL players lived longer than the average American male, the risk of death associated with neurodegenerative disorders was about three times higher among the NFL cohort. The risk for death from Alzheimer's disease and ALS were about four times higher among the NFL cohort. Some on this list may have had dementia not related to ALS or CTE. * Curtis Brown * Gene Hickerson * Jim Ringo Living former players diagnosed with CTE or ALS or reporting symptoms consistent with CTE or ALS These players have publicly acknowledged either having been diagnosed with likely CTE or having experienced symptoms, such as dementia or unusual memory loss, consistent with CTE. In some cases, the player has received a diagnosis of ALS but symptoms are consistent with CTE. There are at least two dozen former players who were diagnosed as part of a UCLA study but have not come forward publicly. There are also around 4,500 former players who joined a class action lawsuit against the NFL alleging that it had covered up a growing body of medical evidence about the preponderance of head-trauma related CTE in ex-NFL players. Some of these ex-players may have medical conditions other than CTE or ALS. For example, ex-players that have presented with symptoms late in life may have other forms of age-related dementia. Some of the former players on this list came forward only in the context of the class action lawsuit versus the NFL. At present, there is no definitive CTE test available for living persons.

She was educated at Brigshaw High School. Career Originally from Leeds, based in Manchester since her switch to cycling in April 2013. Marchant began her sporting life as a heptathlete, and represented Great Britain in that event at the 2012 World Junior Championships. The switchover was instigated by her former coach, Toni Minichiello (best known for coaching Jessica Ennis), who suggested the move to cycling having seen the results of her power output on a Wattbike test. Marchant had cycled for leisure on a mountain bike and on the road, but had no experience of track cycling. After a 6-week trial period, she permanently switched to track cycling. She became a member of British Cycling's Olympic Academy in April 2013, and graduated to the Olympic Development Programme in November 2013.

Brightholmlee is a small rural hamlet situated within the City of Sheffield in England. The hamlet falls within the Stannington Ward of the City. It is located 6.2 miles (10 km) north-west of the city centre and west of Wharncliffe Side within Bradfield Parish. Previously a farming community, it consist of four farmsteads, Manor Farm, Old Hall Farm, High Lea Farm and Lee Farm. It is now almost entirely residential with the last working farm being sold for development in 2013. History The name Brightholmlee originates from the Old English language, “Bright” is probably a modern derivation of an Anglo Saxon personal name, such as Brihtric or Beorhtweald, “holm” indicates land surrounded partly by streams, while “lee” means woodland glade. The earliest recorded reference to the hamlet were documented in 1309 and 1314 when Ralph de Brightomlee witnessed deeds at Westmondhalgh and Wigtwizzle. Ralph died in 1335 and his son John inherited lands in Westmondhalgh and Onesacre, after 1345 nothing more is heard of this family. Other documents indicate that Brightholmlee originated at the beginning of the 13th century.\\"Historic Hallamshire\\", David Hey, Landmark Collectors Library, , page 72, Gives historical details. Old Hall Farmhouse is grade II listed. The hamlet is split into two by an old packhorse route called Townfield Road which comes up from the south and continues onto Bolsterstone, it is generally accepted that the houses on the uphill side of the track are several hundred years older than those below. The two oldest buildings in the hamlet are High Lea Farm and Old Hall Farm, both of which date from the 17th century and with the exception of one modern house (Lea Croft) all present day buildings in the hamlet were shown on the 1851 OS map.\\"Wharncliffe & Oughtibridge Past\\", Andrew Crofts, DS Publishing, , pages 81 - 83, Gives historical and architectural details. Buildings and features High Lea farmhouse is a Grade II listed building, it is a long single storied building with a gabled attic. It is unusual in that it is a rare example of a cruck house as most cruck buildings are barns. It dates from the 17th century, although the core may be earlier, there were originally three dwellings within the building, this was later reduced to two, with a cottage at the uphill end and a farmhouse at the downhill end, today one dwelling takes up the whole of the inside. British Listed Buildings Details of High Lea Farm Old Hall Farm is also Grade II listed, local historian Joseph Kenworthy thought Old Hall dated back to the Tudor period because of the design of the fireplace. It is another timber framed dwelling, with two pairs of crucks. Two wings were later added on either side of the original building, these date from 1620 and 1711 respectively. The farm was the property of the Appleyard family from the 18th century until recent times. British Listed Buildings Details of Old Hall Farm Several ancient farm workers cottages at the junction of Townfield Road and Brightholmlee Lane were demolished in the hamlet in the mid-1970s. The present day Swinnock Hall which stands 0.5 km south of the main hamlet was built on the site of the original building which dated from 1416. The first hall was part of the estate of John Swinnock, later residents included the Waterhouse and Bradshaw families.\\"Around Bradfield, Loxley and Hillsborough\\", Malcolm Nunn, Chalford, , page 121, Gives details of Swinnock Hall. Manor Farm is another noteworthy building, it is rated as a Building of Townscape Merit, the name suggest that the building is of Medieval origins. Other buildings in the hamlet include Rose Cottage and Lee Farm. The hamlet also has ancient water troughs and a milestone inscribed with the Ordnance Survey benchmark and a date of 1860. Rose Cottage at the junction of Thorne House Lane and Brightholmlee Road, the 19th century milepost is bottom right. Brightholmlee Conservation Area Brightholmlee was designated as a Conservation Area on 5 January 1977. Outstanding features of the hamlet which contribute to the designation are: *Exceptional group value as an attractive group of farmhouses, barns, stables and cottages, of which almost all are at least 150 years old and some dating from the 17th century. *A number of fine traditional buildings that remain in their original form as a reminder of pre- industrial Sheffield. *Visual continuity with the surrounding area from the use of gritstone rubble as a building material on the barns, walls and field boundaries. *Wide views in every direction. *Rural tranquillity.

Lee attended Dongguk University, at the base of Namsan, from which he earned a B.A. in Buddhism in 1956. Lee worked as a reporter for the United Press, Seoul Shinmun, Daehan Ilbo, and as Editor in Chief and Editorial Writer for the Kukje Shinmun. Lee was also a professor of Korean at Dongguk University. Lee died on February 2, 2005. Work The poetic career of Lee Hyeonggi can be divided into three distinct periods. The first period, best represented by his poetry anthology Isolated Nature, reflects the maturing thoughts of a man who has come to realize the fundamental solitude of life and the emptiness of the world. The poems dating from this period are heavily infused with the sentiment of the futility of life. His poems, however, are not simple expressions of bitterness or anger, but are characterized instead, by a bold confrontation with this futility. The poet also removes himself worldly considerations and involvement, thus purifying himself from the transient waves of existence and unveiling aspects of transcendence in harmony with nature. The second period of the poet’s career includes works dating from the 1970s and after, which unburdens itself from the transparent and restrained emotion of his previous poetry to better express the poet’s intense aestheticism. The central characteristics of this period are the desperate resistance shown by even strong men in the face of the death, and the essential futility of mankind magnified by such resistance, and the dramatic expression of human life through the negative influence of superficial vitality. After the mid-1980s, his poetry displays a freedom of spirit that can withdraw and objectively examine the futility of life. He coolly examines the changes within reality and the horror of the world, with a calm composure that boldly accepts these observations.

Opened in 1961, its anchor stores are Macy's, a Restoration Hardware Outlet, Target, and Walmart. Other major tenants include Barnes & Noble, Cost Plus World Market, and Reading Cinemas. The mall is managed by CBRE Group. History The mall was built in 1961 by Del E. Webb Construction Company, with Welton Becket and associates as architect. It occupied of land and cost over $20 million to build. At the time, it was the largest development in La Mesa's history. Marston's (later The Broadway) and Montgomery Ward were the original two anchor stores. Marston's, which had a location in downtown San Diego, had begun consultations in 1956 to choose the site of the Grossmont Center store, their first branch location. The store design featured of moldings, gold leaf lettering, murals painted by five artists, and a Gothic-style canopy over its entry. Other major tenants included Longs Drugs, a barbershop, several shoe stores, a florist, a fabric shop, a jeweler, and two dime stores: S. H. Kress & Co. and F. W. Woolworth Company. Fifty thousand people attended the mall's opening ceremonies on October 5, 1961 - 20,000 more than the population of La Mesa at the time. Present at opening ceremonies were the regional manager of the Montgomery Ward chain; June Wilkinson, a Playboy model; and several representatives of the Marston's chain. By 1965, a 1,000 seat movie theater had been added to the mall. Buffum's was added in 1979 as a third anchor store in a newly constructed wing, and Bullock's in 1983 as a fourth. Also at this point, a parking deck was added to the mall. Buffum's closed in 1990, with Bullock's and Woolworth following in 1993, although Cost Plus World Market and a food court were added. The former Buffum's became Oshman's SuperSports USA (later bought out by Sports Authority) in 1991, while Target opened in the vacated Bullock's store in 1995. See's Candies is an original store at Grossmont Center which stands in the same place and is still doing business. In 1992, the mall's movie theater complex closed, but it was reopened and expanded on May 26, 1995. Barnes & Noble Booksellers was also added on November 24, 1997, replacing Woolworth which closed in 1993. The Broadway chain was bought out by, and changed into a Macy's a year later. Montgomery Ward closed in 2000 and was replaced by Walmart four years later in 2004. In 2016 Sports Authority closed after the chain filed for bankruptcy. The store was re-tenanted in September 2016 by a Restoration Hardware outlet.

Žižkov depot is currently (September 2014) home to 77 Tatra T3SUCS trams, 6 T3R.PV trams and 41 T6A5 trams which are operated in pairs mostly on tram lines 1, 9, 11, 12, 14, 24 and 25. All T3SUCS in Prague are supposed to be replaced with a new type of tram - Škoda 15T within the next few years. More than a hundred 15T's were delivered (to Pankrác and Vokovice depot), and many of T3SUCS were already put out of service, stored at yard of workshop-depot in Hostivař, and offered to purchase.

It is not certain yet if Žižkov will operate 15T tram instead of T3SUCS, or some other depot will get new 15T trams and Žižkov will get some older trams from other depots, such as T6A5 from Strašnice tram depot or T3R.PV from Vokovice tram depot. The T6A5 model is also old and not much prospective; those cars located in Žižkov depot were built in 1996 and 1997.

It is part of the monument ensemble No. 1–21.  History  Roland and Rathaus (townhall) In the Middle Ages, a municipal wine-house was situated on the corner of Bremer Marktplatz/Liebfrauenkirchhof and Obernstrasse. Later on, the building was redecorated with a Renaissance gable. Until the 17th century, the building was used as a wine warehouse. Later on it passed into private ownership and was remodeled on several occasions. In 1900, it was used as a lingerie store. Thereafter, it was purchased by the city and demolished to provide space for a new building. = Rathscafé = As the building was situated in the immediate neighbourhood of the Town Hall, it was decided to launch an architectural competition to attract bids for its reconstruction from throughout Germany. The competition was won by the young Bremen architect Rudolf Jacobs. In accordance with his designs, it was reconstructed between 1909 and 1911 as a four-storey building with a saddle roof on the Marktplatz which at that time was called Kaiser-Wilhelm-Platz. Jacobs succeeded in creating a building which attracted expert attention. The building is an important component of the area's development given its relationship to the Marktplatz itself as well as to Unser-Lieben-Frauen- Kirchhof, the cemetery located opposite. Built in the early 20th century, the building was inspired by the Heimatschutzarchitektur and Reformarchitektur trends, common in Germany at the time. Documenting the art and culture of the old town, the group of three gabled houses is decorated both outside and inside with items from excavations, collections and acquisitions. They include the freestone gable decorations, the 18th-century oriel windows, the portals and, inside the building, the 18th-century hallways. = Deutsches Haus = admonishing words of Wilhelm Kaisen The corner house which had been destroyed during the Second World War was rebuilt by the construction firm Paul Kossel in accordance with the plans of the architect Herbert Anker, closely in line with the original building. After reconstruction, the former Rathscafé received the name of Deutsches Haus. Destruction and reconstruction are the central theme of the sandstone reliefs. The interior was changed more extensively in 1956 except for the hall of the house on the corner of Hakenstrasse which remained unchanged. It was fitted with a hall from the Stövesandt House on the Geeren, maintaining its original staircases, doors and parapets with their Acanthus carvings, all from 1740. The rooms which previously were called „Marktdielen” (market hallways) were now called „Bürgerstuben” (citizens' rooms) whereas some rooms maintained the name of „Rathsstuben” (council rooms). The „Deutsche Bruderhilfe” (an organisation that distributed West German donations to the citizens of the German Democratic Republic) had its office in the building. In 1995, the group of buildings to which the „Haus am Markt” belonged was completely revitalised by the Bremen architect Christian Bockholt (office BPG). The restaurant rooms in the upper floor which were no longer needed were converted, inter alia, into office floorspaces and apartments. The rooms of „Industrie-Club Bremen e.V.” were renewed at that time and completely modernised, once again, in 2008. The building belongs to the Körber-foundation since 2007. The restaurant at the lower floor houses the restaurant „Beck's am Markt”. An Inscription in large letters ::„Remember the brothers bearing the fate of our separation”, admonishing words of Wilhelm Kaisen, was attached to the market side in 1955. In March 2011, the inscription was given as a loan for one year to an exhibition in the Haus der Geschichte (house of history) in Bonn. Coat of arms at the market gable The coat of arms at the gable is a reproduction of an old original sculpture of the Bremen State Great Coat of Arms at the Rickmers' estate in Horn.Elmshäuser, Hoffmann, Manske: Das Rathaus und der Roland aus dem Marktplatz in Bremen, S. 135: Plan des Ratscafés mit Eintragungen von Bauteilen, Ansicht zum Markt. Edition Temmen, Bremen 2002, . = Reused Components of other buildings = The following components of other demolished houses of Bremen citizens were reused at the Rathscafé: the late Renaissance front gate of about 1660 from Hakenstrasse 1 was used in 1909; at the market side, the oriel windows of the houses Tiefer No. 35 (right side) and Hinterm Schütting No. 8 (left side); the oriel of the corner house Pelzerstrasse No. 6 and Brill no. 8; the oriels of the middle house of Balgebrückstrasse No. 33; the gable of the corner house of Hakenstrasse was taken from Wachtstrasse No. 17 after the said house had been demolished in 1894.  Monument protection  In 1973, the Rathscafé, today named Deutsches Haus, was designated a historic monument. The building ensemble at the north side of the market place consists of four buildings, from right to left: * No. 1 Rathscafé/Deutsches Haus, 1908-1911 and 1951-1956 * No. 9 Haus zum Jonas, 1600 and 1963 * No. 11 Raths- Apotheke, 1893-1894 and 1959-1960 * No. 12 Haus der Stadtsparkasse, 1755 and 1957-1958  References   Further reading  S.D.

It is based in Espoo, Finland. Omegawave was founded in 1999 and their products are based on the results of sports science research carried out by athletes and coaches from the former Soviet Union, and Soviet cosmonaut training technology. In January 2013 they were listed by Talouselämä as one of Finland’s most promising start-ups. History The company began as OmegaWave Sport Inc. in Portland, Oregon, USA, being founded in 1999 by Leo Maskov, Val Nasedkin and Allen K. Huffstutter. The company was renamed Omegawave Ltd., and moved to Finland in 2012 after attracting investment from the Finnish innovation fund, Sitra, and Conor Venture Partners. The key to Omegawave's system is the way the software, developed by Vladimir Larionov and Leonid Masakov, interprets electrocardiography (EKG), and a very slow moving♙Omega brain wave, and compares them with each other to determine an individual's current physical state. With the move to Finland, Omegawave also attracted a number of former Nokia employees. Juha Pinomaa, who previously held a number of executive positions at Nokia and has also been President of Suunto, was advising the company in 2011, and served as the CEO in 2012-2014, followed by Gerard Bruen, another ex-Nokia executive. Chairman of the Board is Anssi Vanjoki, former vice CEO of Nokia and also Chairman of Amer Sports. Two of the founders and original inventors of Omegawave’s technology – Leo Masakov, Research Director, and Val Nasedkin, VP Business Development – also moved to Finland and continued working with the new company. Products and technology Omegawave’s products measure and assess the functional readiness of athletes, with the aim of identifying the optimal types and intensities of training and recovery, to improve athletic performance and help avoid injury. The most comprehensive of their products, Omegawave Team, takes measurements relevant to an athletes physiological condition, including ECG, Omega (DC potential of the brain), neuromuscular, and reaction rate measurements, for analysis by their cloud-service. Measurements and their results can be taken for a whole team and viewed by a coach locally, or remotely via the company’s cloud-service. They also have a related product for individual athletes called Omegawave Personal. The measurements are processed by Omegawave’s patented cloud-based system to give results and recommendations that the company claims are relevant to the athlete’s cardiac readiness, metabolic readiness, central nervous system readiness, gas exchange readiness, detoxification readiness, and hormonal system readiness. It is from the Omega measurement that the company takes its name. DC potentials of the brain are sometimes called Omega- potential and the measurement of them is sometimes called Omegametry. History of the technology The need for the product to be non-invasive and non-stressful came directly from the inventors’ experience in Soviet athletics teams and the testing methods they used. At that time Soviet athletes were tested to assess their condition once or twice a year, with the tests taking place in a hospital. The tests included highly stressful methods such as muscle biopsies and exercising till exhaustion. Since the results became available several weeks later, and the athletes took a long time to recover, they were of no practical use to the coaches. The technology and techniques that eventually became Omegawave products were therefore designed with the specific purpose of being quick, non-stressful and non-invasive, and to provide results that were easy for coaches to interpret. Published studies appear to indicate that these non-invasive methods are, as intended, as reliable as the more invasive methods. Notable users Lionel Messi from FC Barcelona, Mario Balotelli from AC Milan, and Steven Gerrard from Liverpool F.C., are known to have used Omegawave products to reduce their risk of injury. The Russian National Triathlon team, the Seattle Sounders, and the Kentucky Wildcats are also known to use Omegawave products.

The organization was profiled by The Globe and Mail in 2008. The organization holds annual festivals, at sites of interest to those interested in maritime commerce on the Great Lakes. The Globe and Mail profiled boatnerd when the 2008 festival was held in a shipyard in Port Colborne, Ontario, where the Calumet, an 80-year-old lake freighter was being scrapped. According to The Globe and Mail the site gets over 20 million page views a month. According to The Globe and Mail the site's volunteers often report breaking news prior to its announcement by official authorities. The Globe and Mail quoted a volunteer who described how, while professional mariners kidded the volunteers, they obviously monitored it, because they could count on regular mariners promptly informing them when they had made a mistake. The organization is large enough to maintain an office in Port Huron, Michigan, overlooking the confluence of the St Clair and Black Rivers. The site went online in 1995, and became a registered not for profit corporation in 2006, under the name Great Lakes & Seaway Shipping Online.

The project of an aerial lift line to provide easy access between the recreational resorts Pınarbaşı and Aytepe (literally: Moon Hill) goes back to 2006. The long line with five intermediate support towers was constructed by the Turkish company STM Sistem Teleferik from İzmir, which delivered also the technical equipment. The construction of the line began in September 2008. Cost 2.620 million (approx. US$1.578 million in March 2009), the gondola line went in service in the beginning of March 2009. The operation was suspended beginning of April 2009 by the newly elected mayor right after the 2009 local elections with the rationale \\"lack of proficient personnel\\". Due to pressure by local citizens, the abondened facility reopened in September 2011 for free-of-charge use following overhaul works. However, the line stopped shortly after again. On October 8, 2012, the gondola line became operational for the third time. It runs on weekdays between 8:00-17:00 and on weekends between 9:00-17:30 hours.

Takeo Takei is among Japan's most influential children's illustrators of the twentieth century. He was one of the first to create high-quality illustrations for children and was an early advocate of making artwork that respected and nurtured a child's imagination. Nearly one hundred years after his work was first published, his influence in illustration, manga, animation, graphic design, computer game character and even advertising is as strong as ever.http://www.kodomo.go.jp/gallery/KODOMO_WEB/authors/takei_e.html  Life  Takeo Takei was born the first son and the only child of Kei-ichiro and Sachi Takei on 25 June 1894, in Hirano-village (now Okaya-city), Nagano Prefecture, Japan. Takei was a very artistic child, he drew his first illustration three years old. He spent many hours alone at home (in his case due to weak constitution). When he was in the 2nd grade of primary school, he went to school two weeks in total, because of frequent illness. In these days, he immersed himself in drawing and writing, he imagined a fairy named \\"Mito\\" in his fantasy, and he played with it. This aspect of his childhood would later inform his deep respect for the artistic mind of the child. Although originally discouraged by his father (the mayor of Hirano village) from becoming an artist, Takei ultimately attended the Tokyo Art School (known today as the Tokyo University of the Arts, the leading art school in the country and the alma mater of many renowned artists in Japan) with his blessing. There, he studied Western-style art and painting and graduated in 1919. Kodomo no kuni vol.1, 1922 In 1922, Takei's artwork was on the first cover of the groundbreaking children's magazine \\"Kodomo no kuni (Children's Land)\\", which published artwork, songs, craft projects, and stories for children until 1944. It embodied a democratic and individualistic approach to children's education that emerged during the Taisho democracy in Japan (1912-1926), and that mirrored Takei's personal philosophy.http://www.kodomo.go.jp/gallery/KODOMO_WEB/index_e.html His output was prodigious in the 1920s: He wrote and illustrated his own stories, as well as Japanese folktales and other original fairy tales by Japanese writers such as Kenji Miyazawa. He also illustrated non-Japanese stories such as \\"The Thousand and One Nights\\" and in 1928, the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen. In 1927, Takei helped found the Nihon Doga Kyokai (Japan Association of Illustration for Children). At various times in his career, he also had a role as reviewer and selector of illustrations for various magazines. Sadly, much of Takeo's original artwork was destroyed by fire in Tokyo during World War II.http://www.kodomo.go.jp/gallery/KODOMO_WEB/authors/takei_e.html  Works  The works of Takeo Takei are classified in three. The first one is the illustrations for children, \\"Doga\\" in Japanese. The second is the woodblock prints,\\"Hanga\\". The other is the making books of various materials,\\"Kanpon\\".http://www.ilf.jp/english/ = Illustrations For Children (Doga) = Takei's mediums of choice for his fantastical, surreal, but always accessible drawings were watercolors, crayon, and pen and ink. In 1926, Takei published one of his most famous books, \\"Ramu-Ramu O\\" (King Ramu- Ramu).http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/1170079 In 1928, he published \\"Dōbutsu no Mura\\" (The Animal Village).http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/1170073 = Woodblock Prints (Hanga) = = Books of various materials (Kanpon) = Kanpon literally means \\"published book.\\" Takei used this term and employed it to his own exploration of the expressive potential of the medium of the book.Rachel Saunders, 'Gyre and Gimble: The Artist Books of Takei Takeo (1894-1983),' Print Quarterly, XXX, March 2013, p. 23-39. http://www.rarebook.com/takei/takei.html  Childhood house  Takeo Takei's childhood house(a samurai residence) The house which Takeo Takei had lived until he was 19 years old is still standing in Okaya, Nagano Prefecture, Japan. It was built in 1698 or 1699, over 300 years ago, so it is one of the oldest houses in Japan. It was a samurai residence, of which there very few, as they are usually made of wood and paper. Okaya-city municipal office, the owner of this house since 2008, decided to destroy. Many people have been against it and work for a social movement in which people maintain the house as a cultural asset for preservation.

Screening The Battle Between the Burps and Farts was first screened in New York City and upon its première, was responsible for inciting many a fist fight amongst audience members.

Peters currently serves on the Pinellas County Board of County Commissioners, having announced in 2017 that she would not seek re-election the Florida House in order to run for a seat on the commission. History Peters was born in Northbrook, Illinois, in 1961, and moved to Florida in 1985, where she attended St. Petersburg College, where she received her associate degree, and Eckerd College, receiving a degree in human development. In 2008, Peters was elected to the South Pasadena City Commission, and in 2009, she was selected by her fellow Commissioners to serve as Mayor. She continued serving on the City Commission and as Mayor until 2012, and simultaneously worked as the Vice-President of Public Affairs at the Clearwater Regional Chamber of Commerce. Florida House of Representatives In 2012, following the reconfiguration of Florida House districts, Peters opted to run in the newly created 69th District. She faced David Phillips and Jim Dobyns in the Republican primary, campaigning on education reform. She ended up comfortably defeating both of her opponents, winning 51% of the vote to Phillips's 36% and Dobyns's 13%. Advancing to the general election, she faced Josh Shulman, the Democratic nominee and a financial planner. Peters was endorsed by the Tampa Bay Times, predicting that she would be a \\"moderate Republican voice in Tallahassee\\" and praising her for her political experience. She ended up narrowly defeating Shulman, winning 52% of the vote to his 48%. 2014 congressional campaign Following the death of Republican United States Congressman Bill Young on October 18, 2013, a special election was held to replace him. On November 19, 2013, Peters announced that she would run to replace him, declaring that she would fight \\"the weak-willed, the preening and the posturing men\\" responsible for the dysfunction of the federal government. At her campaign's kickoff, she was introduced by, among others, Young's son, Bill Young II, and State Senator Jack Latvala. In the Republican primary, she faced David Jolly, a former aide to Young, and retired General Mark Bircher. During the course of the campaign, Peters received the support of a number of serving members of Congress, including Diane Black, Lynn Jenkins, and Ann Wagner, all of whom sought to increase the amount of Republican women in their caucus, and who helped Peters fundraise. She received the endorsement of the Tampa Bay Times in her bid, which noted that, following Young's death, \\"[T]he best-known and best-qualified potential candidates declined to run,\\" but that Peters \\"has the local experience and temperament to succeed even though she has a lot to learn about federal issues.\\" The Tampa Tribune, meanwhile, endorsed Jolly over Peters, criticizing her for having a \\"knowledge of the issues facing Congress\\" that \\"only skims the surface,\\" though praising her for her \\"reputation for doggedness\\" and for her efforts in \\"pushing through a measure that eliminated a tax inequity affecting condominium owners.\\" Ultimately, however, Peters was defeated by Jolly, who had consistently performed better than her in public polls and in terms of fundraising, and she received 31% of the vote to Jolly's 45% and Bircher's 24%. Jolly would go on to win the election against Alex Sink, the Democratic nominee and the former Chief Financial Officer of Florida.

He won a contract with Ace Records, but made his first recording, a version of the song \\"Junco Partner\\" re-worked as \\"Preacher's Daughter\\", for the Spinett label, set up by singer Frankie Ford and his manager Joe Caronna. For contractual reasons Caronna changed the singer's name to Stone. At the Ace label, he then recorded \\"Something Special\\", which was written and produced by Rebennack, and arranged by Allen Toussaint, and \\"Just A Moment\\", which became a regional hit and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. However, later records in the early 1960s, some released on Cosimo Matassa's White Cliffs label, failed to sell. In 1964, Stone quit the music business. He worked in New Orleans and then Texas – where he performed occasionally under his real name until the late 1970s – before returning to his home city in 1979 to work in his uncle's dry cleaning business. Following an approach from record producer Carlo Ditta, he recorded again with Dr. John in the 1990s, releasing two albums on Orleans Records, Remember Me (1994) and Live on the Creole Queen (1997). He also performed at local clubs and festivals, while working with his brother in a galvanized metal company. A compilation of his Ace recordings was issued in the UK in 1999. He died in New Orleans that year at the age of 58.

Early life Shephard was born in Islington, the son of an engineer and a charity worker, who were both Quakers and keen amateur artists. He attended Repton School, before studying at the Slade School of Fine Art from 1926 to 1929. After graduating from the Slade, Shephard taught at Raynes Park County School whilst painting at night and often in pubs and music halls. In 1929, he began to exhibit with the London Group at both the Wertheim Gallery and the Coolings Gallery. Throughout 1937 to 1939 Shephard exhibited with the founding members of the Euston Road School, William Coldstream, Claude Rogers and Victor Pasmore at the Storran Gallery whilst continuing to exhibit with the London Group. Shephard held his first solo exhibition at the Calman Gallery in 1939. World War II Lorries Transporting Landing Craft, Royal Albert Docks, London (1945) (Art.IWM ART LD 5293) From 1940 to 1943, Shephard worked as an industrial draughtsman but continued to paint and submitted several paintings, on industrial production topics, to the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC. These included a series of five pictures, Women in Industry and a scene inside an aircraft repair workshop. In the spring of 1945, WAAC offered Shephard a full-time contract with the Ministry of War Transport, which he completed with a number of scenes painted in London. Later life From 1946 to 1948 Shephard taught at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. In 1942, Shephard had married his first wife, the daughter of a British businessman based in South Africa and in 1948 the couple moved to Cape Town with their children. Shephard spent fifteen years in South Africa as the director of the Michaelis Art School at the University of Cape Town. He had ten solo exhibitions in South Africa and also exhibited internationally. In 1962 his wife died and Shephard and his three children returned to Britain. In 1965 Shephard married Nicolette Macnamara, an artist, whose sister, Caitlin, was the widow of Dylan Thomas. Shephard knew Nicolette from when they were both students at the Slade together and had previously painted portraits of Thomas and both sisters. In 1972 Shephard was elected to Royal Society of Portrait Painters. Shephard continued to paint portraits and exhibition pieces but failing eyesight ended his career in 1990 and two years later he died of cancer in London. Collections holding works by Rupert Shephard include the Imperial War Museum, the RAF Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, and the British Museum.

History and nomenclature The camel is a very old piece, appearing in some early chess variants such as Tamerlane chess, but also in Wildebeest Chess. It is still known as such in fairy chess problems. Value The camel by itself is worth about two pawns (appreciably less than a knight), because of its colorboundedness and lack of sufficient freedom of movement on an 8×8 board. However, a camel and a bishop and a king can force checkmate on a bare king (assuming that the attacking pieces are not on the same color);Endgame statistics with fantasy pieces by Dave McCooey, The Chess Variant pages a camel, a knight and a king can force checkmate on a bare king, but not easily (there are thirteen types of fortress draws); a camel, a wazir and a king can sometimes force checkmate on a bare king, but it can take up to 77 moves. Even if they are on different colours of squares, two camels cannot checkmate a lone king. While the rook versus camel endgame is usually a draw, more winning positions exist than there are in rook versus knight and rook versus bishop endgames: the longest win takes 35 moves. (All endgame statistics mentioned are for the 8×8 board.) Usage and value as a component As a component of other pieces, it has about the same value as a knight (both pieces can move to eight squares). The camel plus ferz compound is used in Omega Chess where it is called a wizard,\\"Omega chess\\" and the camel plus king compound in Paulovits's Game where it is called general. Its long move carries the danger of unstoppable attacks in the opening and capturing winning large amounts of material.DAN+, Different Augmented Knights by Ralph Betza, The Chess Variant Pages For example, if a camel plus wazir compound (LW in Betza's funny notation) replaces White's queen-side rook, then White can immediately win material with 1.(LW)b4, threatening 2.(LW)e5 winning Black's queen and 2.(LW)b5 winning Black's queen's rook; the threats cannot both be parried.

A former Republican, he previously served as general counsel to his predecessor, Bill Young. He won the race for Young's seat in a special election against Democrat Alex Sink. He was subsequently reelected in November 2014, winning 75 percent of the vote, but was unseated in 2016 by former Governor Charlie Crist after court-ordered redistricting made his district more Democratic. Since leaving office, Jolly has become a prominent Republican critic of U.S. president Donald Trump. In September 2018, Jolly and his wife left the Republican Party. Early life Jolly was born in Dunedin, Florida, the son of Judith and Lawson Jolly, a Baptist pastor. He received his B.A. degree from Emory University in 1994 and his J.D. degree from the George Mason University School of Law in 2001.US Congress Jolly, David W., (1972 - ) Page accessed April 6, 2016 Career He worked for Republican U.S. Representative Bill Young full-time from 1995 to 2006 in various positions, with a brief break for six months in 2001 when he worked at a Washington securities firm. In 2002, Jolly became Young's general counsel and held that position until he left in 2006. He served as the personal attorney for Young's family as well. In 2007, Jolly joined Washington, D.C. firm Van Scoyoc Associates as a lobbyist and in 2011, he left Van Scoyoc to open his own firm, Three Bridges Advisors. He made political donations to both Republicans (about $36,000) and Democrats (about $30,000) during his time as a lobbyist. Jolly had his name removed from the Lobby Registry to run for the vacant House seat. At the time, Jolly was working as vice president of the Clearwater-based investment company Boston Finance Group. Jolly and his first wife bought a condo in Indian Shores, Florida, in 2005 and a house in Washington, D.C. in 2007.Adam C. Smith for the Tampa Bay Times.

His divorce from his wife Carrie was finalized on January 16, 2014, and Jolly married Laura Donahoe on July 3, 2015. In July 2018, Jolly became Executive Vice President and Principal of Shumaker Advisors Florida, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Shumaker, Loop, and Kendrick law firm, at their Tampa office. In making the announcement, the firm said he would be involved with various community issues, including the effort to build a new stadium for the Tampa Bay Rays major league baseball team. Political career Jolly formerly opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, but stated on an interview with MSNBC that during unemployment he had a new appreciation for its use as a \\"safety net\\". He is pro-life. Speaking about firearms policy, Jolly said: \\"I do believe the Second Amendment is a fundamental right, but I don't believe it's beyond the reach of regulation, and I believe it's appropriate to look at regulations that ultimately keep the guns out of the hands of criminals.\\" He supports the Balanced Budget Amendment, and says he would have voted to raise the debt limit in early 2014. Jolly supports sending special operations forces overseas, securing the border, increasing the vetting process for legal immigrants, and increasing surveillance of suspected domestic terrorists. In February 2014, Jolly introduced the Naval Station Guantanamo Bay Protection Act. Jolly pushed to extend the ban on oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. In January 2015, Jolly announced plans to introduce a bill that would extend the reforms of the federal flood insurance program. In July 2015, Jolly introduced the Veterans Health Care Freedom Act. Jolly encouraged the U.S. House to extend the Treasure Island beach re-nourishment project. On July 21, 2014, Jolly announced his support for the legality of same-sex marriage, stating: \\"I believe in a form of limited government that protects personal liberty. To me, that means that the sanctity of one’s marriage should be defined by their faith and by their church, not by their state.\\" He said \\"As a matter of my Christian faith, I believe in traditional marriage.\\" In April 2016, Jolly's United States Senate campaign spokesperson Sarah Bascom confirmed that the campaign had made edits to his Wikipedia page to remove information about Jolly, including references to the Church of Scientology and his lobbying activities, alleging that it presented a \\"public negative narrative\\" against him, and accused an unnamed rival campaign of adding \\"propaganda\\" to the article. Jolly called it \\"a careless staff mistake\\" and said that he stands by his record and wants the public to be fully informed. Jolly was ranked as the 48th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the fourth most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Florida) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member's bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member's co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party). Since leaving office, Jolly has participated regularly as a political commentator on cable news sources such as CNN and MSNBC; in this capacity he has been critical of President Donald Trump and has fueled speculation that he would run for public office again. He considered running for lieutenant governor of Florida in 2018 on a bipartisan ticket, with former Democratic congressman Patrick Murphy as the candidate for governor. Jolly ultimately decided not to run for any public office in 2018.

Jolly faced Democratic nominee Alex Sink and a libertarian candidate, Lucas Overby, in the special election. The race received national attention as possibly forecasting the mid-term elections that were coming in November of that year and became the most expensive Congressional race in history, with around $11M spent, $9M of it by outside groups. During the campaign there was friction between the National Republican Congressional Committee and Jolly; the RNC thought Jolly's campaign was inept, and Jolly criticized the negative ads run by the RNC. and voters were generally unhappy with the overwhelming number of attack ads on both sides. Jolly won the election on March 11, 2014 with 48.4% of the vote after being behind in the early tallies; he was sworn into office on March 13. =2014 general election= Jolly ran for reelection to a full term in November 2014. He was unopposed in the Republican primary, and no Democrat ran against him in the general election; his only challenger was Lucas Overby, the Libertarian nominee who came in third in the special election one year prior.

As of August 2015, it appeared that Jolly would face several opponents in the August 30, 2016 Republican primary election, including U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis and Lieutenant Governor of Florida Carlos López-Cantera. However, on June 17, 2016, after Rubio reversed his decision, Jolly withdrew from the Senate race to run for re-election to the House, citing \\"unfinished business.\\" =2016 general election= In his bid for a second full term, Jolly faced former Florida governor and St. Petersburg resident Charlie Crist, a former Republican who had turned Democratic after a brief stint as an independent. He found himself in a district that had been made significantly more Democratic after a court threw out Florida's original congressional map. Notably, it absorbed a heavily Democratic portion of southern Pinellas County, including almost all of St. Petersburg. Previously, some of the more Democratic portions of St. Petersburg had been in the Tampa-based 14th District. Ultimately, Jolly lost to Crist by 51.9% to 48.1%. Jolly's defeat ended a 62-year hold on this St. Petersburg-based district by the GOP. William Cramer won the seat for the Republicans in 1954,State of Florida, General election returns, November 4, 1952, and November 2, 1954 handing it to Young in 1970.

Ascot Park in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio Originally known as Northampton Park, the track was built in 1922 along Ohio State Route 8 on 63 acres of farmland. The unusual track was only 3/4 mile long. Three-quarter- mile tracks are proving exceptionally popular in Canada, having the advantage from a spectator's standpoint that in races of almost any official distances, the start is made near the grandstand, the Akron Beacon Journal reported in 1933. In addition, the three-quarter-mile track allows spectators to see the horses and jockeys clearly when on the backstretch. The track closed at the onset of the Great Depression, and was purchased out of receivership by Barberton businessman Bill Griffiths and his associates for $17,500.'Biggest Little Racetrack in America' known for its big heart The new owners renovated and reopened the facility in 1935 and changed the name to Ascot Park in 1938. They also created the two-mile Ascot Gold Cup race, that became the oldest continuously run stake in Ohio history. Cleveland businessman Horace Adams bought the track for $1.3 million in 1954 and spent another $900,000 for upgrades, resulting in a record 12,525 fans for opening day in 1955. When Adams died in 1966, the track changed hands several times, and was used for fairs, auctions, circuses, motorcycle races and pageants. By 1975 the track had become a safety hazard, so local firefighters burned down its grandstands and other buildings in 1976 as a training exercise. The site is part of a 200-acre industrial park.

The mission was agreed upon in late 2010. and was originally intended to build two commercial hyperspectral satellites. Preliminary studies for the program started in 2012, with Phase A completed in 2013. A Joint Integrated Team from Italy and Israel perform preliminary definition and studies until 2014. By 2014, the project has evolved into building only one satellite. Phase B1, started in 2017 and was expected to last 12 months. In October 2015 a memorandum of understanding was signed, and the system was slated to become fully operational in 2021, later pushed to 2022. The project is expected to cost over $200 million, with the cost being split evenly between the two countries. Mission The joint mission is expected to build a hyperspectral Earth observation satellite that will occupy the same orbit as the older Italian satellite, COSMO-SkyMed which was launched in 2007. The satellites will be equipped with instruments targeting the visible, infrared, and ultraviolet wavelengths in the 400 nm to 2700 nm range. The satellite will use the OPTSAT-3000 satellite platform built by Israel Aerospace Industries, and is expected to be about 385 kg. The payload will be limited to 120 kg and is expected be equipped with: * Panchromatic camera with a 2.5-m GSD, * Commercial Hyper-spectral Imaging Spectrometer (0.2-2.5 µm) * Infrared camera (4-12 µm) * Spectral ranges (contiguous spectrum): ** Visible and near-infrared imaging spectrometers of 8 m in the 400-1010 nm range ** Short-wavelength infrared range imaging spectrometers of 10 m GSD in the 920–2700 nm range The satellite is expected to launch in 2022 on a Vega launch vehicle.

There is no known name for the people he led, or for their territory. Encounter with de Soto Hernando de Soto landed on the west coast of the peninsula of Florida in the summer of 1539 with a large contingent of men, with the intention of exploring and colonizing the country. The exact place at which de Soto landed has been controversial,Milanich&Hudson;: 3-6 but a number of historians accept Tampa Bay as the site.Hann: 1 Tebeau: 23 Milanich&Hudson;: 4 Soon after landing de Soto encountered Juan Ortiz, a Spanish sailor who had been held captive by local chiefs for eleven years. Ortiz told de Soto of a chief called Urriparacoxi who lived inland, who had a lot of maize, and to whom the local chiefdoms, including Mocoso and Uzita, paid tribute.Milanich&Hudson;: 56-57, 71 De Soto sent one of his lieutenants, Baltazar de Gallegos, with between 80 and 180 men (the chronicles of the expedition differ) to visit Urriparacoxi on June 20.Milanich&Hudson;: 57 The people of Urriparacoxi's town abandoned it when the Spanish approached. The Spanish found fields of corn, beans and pumpkins at the town. Urriparacoxi refused to meet personally with de Gallegos, negotiating via messengers. He told de Gallegos that there was a large town, called Acuera, three days away, and another large town, Ocale, 2 more days beyond that. Urriparacoxi claimed that both towns had a lot of maize, and that Ocale kept turkeys in pens and herds of tame deer. He also told the Spanish that the people of Ocale had quantities of gold, silver and pearls.Milanich&Hudson;: 72 De Soto left his base on the coast for Urriparacoxi's territory with the bulk of his army on July 15. Six days later he was joined by de Gallegos at a place called Luca (Milanich and Hudson tentatively place Luca near the present town of Lacoochee). From Luca de Soto's army proceeded to Ocale, and had no further contact with Urriparacoxi. Urriparacoxi disappears from the historical record after his encounter with de Soto's army.Milanich&Hudson;: 58 Location The chronicles of the de Soto expedition variously place Urriparacoxi's town at 20, 25 or 30 leagues from the coast. Milanich and Hudson place Urriparacoxi's town about 25 leagues () northeast of eastern Tampa Bay, in southeastern Lake and southwestern Orange counties, near Lake Louisa, Lake Butler, Lake Tibet, and Big Sand Lake. Mounds near Lake Butler, some of which were excavated late in the 19th century, contained Spanish artifacts, at least some of which are compatible with the de Soto expedition. Urriparacoxi was the most powerful chief in region. His territory might have reached as far west as Luca, but there is no evidence one way or the other, so de Soto and the bulk of his army may have never entered Urriparacoxi's territory.Milanich&Hudson;: 16, 58, 72, 74, 75-76, 84 Title \\"Urriparacoxi\\" was a Timucuan term for a war leader. \\"Paracousi\\" was Timucuan for \\"prince or war-prince\\", and \\"iri\\" (or \\"urri\\") was Timucuan for \\"war-counselor, war-prince, or warrior\\". While this may indicate that Urriparacoxi and his people spoke Timucuan, the title might have been borrowed by non-Timucuan speakers. Borrowing between different languages was common in the region.Milanich&Hudson;: 76, For example, the title \\"holata\\" for \\"chief\\" was used both in Timucua and in several Muskogean languages. Scholars have differed on the direction of borrowing. \\"Urri\\" or \\"iri\\", meaning \\"war\\" was borrowed by Muskogean languages from Timucua. Hann notes, however, that while \\"holata\\" was common in various languages in the southeastern United States, the use of \\"urriparacoxi\\" is otherwise unknown outside of Timucuan- speakers.Hann: 5 Notes References Spanish Florida Native American tribes in Florida ","title":"Urriparacoxi"},{"id":"41148706","text":"The Daniel Galván scandal (also known as Danielgate – ) was a political scandal in which Mohammed VI, the King of Morocco, issued a pardon for a Spanish convicted serial child-rapist named Daniel Galván. The Spanish citizen was serving a 30 years prison sentence. He was arrested in Morocco in late 2011, for having raped at least 11 Moroccan children in Kenitra—a city he had been living in since 2004. The pardon came some 18 months after his incarceration as part of a diplomatic gesture from Mohammed VI to Spain, on the occasion of the 14th anniversary of his enthronement. The Pardon sparked unprecedented popular outrage in Morocco where several protests were held denouncing the monarch's decision. This prompted Mohammed VI to first issue a communiqué in which he denied being aware of the gravity of the crimes committed by Daniel Galvan, then to cancel his pardon but only after the Spanish citizen had already left the country several days before on an expired passport—with the knowledge of Moroccan authorities. It was revealed later that this wasn't the first time Mohammed VI had pardoned a convicted foreign paedophile, having pardoned Hervé Le Gloannec, a French citizen convicted of child rape and child pornography in 2006. It was later revealed that Daniel Galvan did not apply for a pardon and only requested to be transferred to a prison in Spain. El Pais wrote that the royal cabinet in an effort to please Spain, sought to accelerate the normal process of prison transfer—which could take up to two years—and accorded the unwarranted pardon for the convicted pedophile. The scandal King Mohammed VI customarily pardons large numbers of convicted prisoners on national holidays. In 2009 he pardoned as much as 24,865 of Morocco's ~60,000 inmate's population. In 2005 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the country's independence, he pardoned 10,000 convicts, among- which 336 foreigners (one of them was a convicted French child molester as a WikiLeaks cable would reveal). As he was celebrating the 14th-anniversary of his enthronement on 30 July 2013, he issued a pardon for 1200 inmates. The MAP—Morocco's state news agency—released a statement declaring that among the pardoned figured 48 Spanish prisoners, which were released as a gesture demonstrating the good relations between the Mohammed VI and King Juan Carlos of Spain who had just visited the country a week earlier. On July 31, internet media platforms Andalus Press and Lakome, revealed that among the pardoned prisoners, figured a Spanish serial child rapist who was arrested in September 2011, and sentenced to 30 years in prison in a very controversial case. Lakome called the lawyer of the victims—Mohammed Krayri— which confirmed the release of Daniel Galvan, and stated that as of 31 July 2013 he engaged a lawyer to reclaim his assets in Morocco, which were frozen because he did not pay the court-ordered damages to the victims—50,000 Dirhams for each of the 11 victims (~USD5,000). Lakome later reported that Daniel Galvan successfully reclaimed his passport at the Kenitra court and had left the country on Thursday 1 August 2013, through Morocco's effective land border with Spain in the disputed exclave of Ceuta. Daniel reportedly crossed the border on an expired passport with the consent of Moroccan police Between 30 July and 4 August 2013, there was a media blackout on the scandal in Morocco with the exception of some Online media such as Lakome, Andalus Press, Yabiladi. As early as Wednesday 31 July there was huge outrage in the Moroccan social media community which culminated by the call for a protest after the Ramadan Ftour meal in the evening of Friday 2 August in front of the parliament in Rabat. On Friday evening thousands of peaceful protesters gathered before the Parliament building in Rabat. The protest was violently repressed by Moroccan auxiliary forces who beat up the activists, the news reporters and photographers, causing injuries for dozens of them. The police also confiscated filming material and cellphones. The following day—Saturday 3 August—the news of the scandal and the ensuing crackdown on the peaceful protests, made the headlines in most international media (Aljazeera, France 24, CNN ) where pictures of bleeding protesters were shown. On the evening of Saturday —while Morocco's mainstream media were still ignoring the story— Mohammed VI's palace released a statement in which he denied being aware of the gravity of the crimes committed by Daniel Galvan and that an investigation would be ordered to determine where the fault and responsibility lies in his decision. On Sunday 4 August, news of the story was broadcast on two of France's main news programmes on TF1 and France 2, both named Journal de 13 heures, where footage of the violent police crackdown on Friday's protest was shown. On the evening of the same day Mohammed VI issued a statement in which he announced the cancellation of his pardon. No royal pardon has ever been cancelled in Morocco, though some observers noted that a Royal pardon was in theory irrevocable On Tuesday 6 August the King held ceremony—largely publicised locally—in which he was shown greeting and hugging the alleged parents and families of the children abused by Daniel Galvan. On Wednesday 7 August 2013, Daniel Galvan was arrested in Spain after Moroccan authorities filed an international arrest warrant for him. Pictures of the arrest showing Galvan being handcuffed and inside a Spanish police car circulated largely in the Moroccan media. This news and images were very widely reported in Morocco's mainstream and pro-regime press. Spanish courts later refused to extradite him to Morocco. =Precedent= In a leaked diplomatic cable of the US consulate in Casablanca which detailed the Morocco-Human trafficking report for 2010, it was revealed that Mohammed VI had pardoned in 2006 a convicted French child molester. Hervé le Gloannec, was arrested in Marrakech while having sex with a 15-year-old boy and in possession of a large amount of child pornography. He sentenced to 4 years, reduced to 2 years then pardoned by the Moroccan King. Reactions =Mohammed VI's response= The first reaction of the monarch came on the evening of Saturday 3 August, 4 days after the release of Daniel Galvan. He first published a communiqué read in the evening news of state media. He denied being aware of the gravity of the crimes committed of Daniel Galvan. On Sunday 4 August, the palace cabinet released another statement in which they declare that the pardon for Galvan has been revoked. On Tuesday 5 August, the alleged families of the victims were summoned to the palace where they were filmed being greeted and hugged by Mohammed VI. On Tuesday, Morocco through its Ministry of Justice, issued an international arrest warrant against Daniel Galvan. =Use of bot accounts to flood Twitter= Public outrage was concentrated in Twitter and Facebook, where the hashtags and #Danielgate were used to denounce the monarch's decision. Several automated bot accounts flooded these hashtags with tweets which repeated excerpts from the official communiqué of Mohammed VI. A number of these bot accounts were used a few months earlier to promote Mounir Majidi's case in a lawsuit he filed in Paris against Moroccan independent journalist Ahmed Benchemsi. =Spain's reaction= The first official reaction came from the Spanish royal cabinet, they declared that King Juan Carlos had in fact demanded a royal pardon for some Spanish prisoners without further details. They added that it is the Spanish embassy in Morocco who fixed the list of detainees who would be pardoned. =Morocco's cabinet= None of Morocco's political parties or the cabinet reacted to the scandal before the statement of Mohammed VI—with the notable exception of palace affiliated Party of Authenticity and Modernity. This party founded by Fouad Ali El Himma, had some of its members issue a statement before Saturday 3 August which incidentally paraphrased the statement which the palace The first official Moroccan reaction came from Mustapha Ramid, who released a statement on Friday 2 August, in which he announced that the pardon was the King's decision which was dictated by national interest. He later denied being involved in drafting the list of pardoned prisoners, and stressed that the pardon was an exclusive prerogative of the King, adding that it came as part of strategic relations linking Morocco and Spain and must have been done for higher interests of the nation and came as a result of the relations between two kings. =Moroccan media= Before Monday 5 August, Morocco's printed press did not cover the scandal nor the strong reactions it was causing on social media websites, with the exception of \\"Akhbar al-Yawm\\"–a daily edited by journalist Taoufik Bouachrine. Similarly Moroccan Radios and TV (note: all broadcast channels are state-owned in Morocco) did not cover the story before the statements of the palace. =Civil society and Online activists= Reactions of Morocco's officially registered NGOs were almost unanimously limited to restating the position expressed in Mohmmed VI's press releases. Najat Anouar, president of \\"Matqich Waldi\\", an anti-child sexual abuse NGO, stated that the pardon was an exclusive prerogative of the King which he had the discretion of using. The NGO failed to comment or express opposition to the pardon. The process of the Royal pardon in Morocco According to the Dahir n° 1-57-387 of 16 rejeb 1377 (6 February 1958), the Royal pardon is an exclusive and discretionary prerogative of the Moroccan King. It must however pass through a process in which a commission gives a preliminary advice for the King who makes the ultimate decision. According to the aforementioned Dahir, this \\"Pardon commission\\" is composed of the following: * The Minister of Justice, his deputy or the president of his cabinet (Mustapha Ramid and his Chief-of- cabinet Mohamed Benalilou) * The Director of the royal cabinet or his deputy (officially Rochdi Chraibi) * The first president of the Supreme court of his representative (Mustapha Fares) * The general prosecutor of the supreme court or his representative (Mustapha Madah) * The director of the directorate for \\"criminal affairs and pardons\\" or his representative (Mohamed Abdennabaoui) * The director of the penitentiary administration or his representative (Hafid Benhachem) * Secretariat of the commission is conducted by a civil servant of the Ministry of Justice The commission is tasked with examining the requests for pardon which are submitted by the prisoners themselves. It then emits a consultative opinion to the royal cabinet with the King having the final discretionary decision. Royal pardons in Morocco are common and are not published on the country's official bulletin. Only the number of pardoned convicts is communicated to the public in a press release of the MAP (Morocco state's press agency). After the scandal Mohammed VI promised to reform the Pardon process. Apart from dismissing Hafid Benhachem (then 77-year-old), it is not known if any no further actions followed. Other controversial pardons It was also revealed that amongst the pardoned figured a drug trafficking suspect, who was released before standing trial. He had resisted arrest using a firearm. There was, Antonio Garcia, a recidivist drug trafficker arrested in possession of 9 tons of Hashish in Tangiers and sentenced to 10 years. Some media claimed that his release embarrassed Spain. Aftermath =Arrest of Ali Anouzla and Censorship of Lakome= Ali Anouzla, editor-in-chief of the Arabic version of Lakome, which had revealed the scandal, was arrested on 17 September on Terrorism charges after he had linked to an El Pais-article containing a video allegedly from AQIM. Additionally, independent media platform Lakome.com was blocked in Morocco starting from 17 October 2013.\\"Sometimes a Link Is Just a Link: Free Ali Anouzla!\\", Jillian C.

It offers no-fee chequing and savings accounts, Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GIC), mortgages, and mutual funds (through a subsidiary). Many savings and investment products are eligible for registration under a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), or Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF). Despite being a subsidiary of Scotiabank, it retains its former separate Institution Number 614. Founded by ING Group on April 27, 1997 as ING Direct Canada, the bank was acquired by Scotiabank in November 2012. The new name for the bank was revealed in November 2013, and Tangerine was rolled out beginning in April 2014. History The predecessor of Tangerine, ING Bank of Canada (which operated as ING Direct) was founded in April 1997 and operated as a telephone banking service offering savings accounts. It was the first test market for ING Group's direct banking business model, where the aim was to offer more favourable rates to customers by avoiding the costs of running a network of branches. Operating without traditional bank branches, ING Direct Canada instead opened a small network of ING Direct Cafes, for its face-to-face contact points. The first café opened in Toronto in 1997, with a further three opening in Vancouver, Montreal and Calgary, as well a second Toronto location. Dutch actor Frederik de Groot served as the company's spokesperson in ING Direct Canada television commercials. As the bank expanded into online banking it also grew to offer mortgages, RRSPs, TFSAs, GICs, mutual funds and a no-fee chequing account.ING Group#ING Direct Canada In November 2013, ING Direct Canada claimed over 1.8 million customers, employed almost 1,000 people and held close to $40 billion in total assets. =Acquisition by Scotiabank and name change= In November 2012 Scotiabank completed the acquisition of ING Direct Canada from ING Groep NV, the Netherlands-based parent company of ING Direct Canada in a CAD$3.1 billion deal first announced in August 2012. As part of the terms of the deal the bank was required to change its name from ING Direct before May 2014. On November 5, 2013, ING Direct Canada revealed that its name would be changed to Tangerine in early 2014. The bank stated that the name change was the culmination of a year-long consultation process involving more than 10,000 people in qualitative and quantitative research. Tangerine continues to use the 'Forward Banking' tagline used by ING Direct Canada from 2012 onwards. Prior to 2012, ING Direct Canada had used the tagline 'Save Your Money'. On November 19, 2015, Tangerine was named by Waterstone Human Capital as one of Canada's 10 Most Admired Corporate Cultures of 2015. Products and services Tangerine offers the same services that had been provided by ING Direct Canada, namely, savings accounts, a chequing account, mutual funds and mortgages. Tangerine's mutual funds (marketed as \\"portfolios\\") are based on an indexing strategy, each tracking a weighted combination of three or four equity and/or bond indices. In 2016, Tangerine began to offer a Mastercard cash back credit card which provides customers up to 2% cash back on certain purchases. Tangerine's banking app is available to customers through iOS, Android, Blackberry and Windows Mobile. Support was also available for Wear OS and Apple Watch, but was discontinued on February 29, 2020. The apps allows Tangerine customers to view their account balances, transactions, make transfers, find ABMs and deposit cheques by taking a picture. As a result of the Scotiabank acquisition, Scotiabank ABMs and those of other banks in the Global ATM Alliance became free for customers to use in June 2014.

History Built between 1946 and 1955 by the Ministry of Labour, it is considered the most important architectural work built in the 20th century in the Asturias region and, with its 270,000 m2, the largest building in Spain.55 años como vigía de Gijón; El Comercio, 13 October 2010 The building was originally built to educate orphans whose parents had died as a result of working in the mining industry. It is currently a multi-use facility. Abandoned in the 1980s, the whole building was restored between 2001 and 2007. On 19 May 2016, the Universidad Laboral was listed as a Bien de Interés Cultural heritage site. On 12 February 2020, the Gijón city council, with the votes of left-wing parties PSOE, Podemos and IU, declined to launch a campaign for promoting the Universidad Laboral as World Heritage Site by arguing it \\"reflects Francoism\\". The building Luis Moya, who designed the facility along the lines of the Parthenon in Athens, chose to have the main gate face away from the city, so that visitors coming from Gijón would have to walk around the university before entering, and therefore fully admire its magnificence. =Entrance= The main entrance, located in the main facade, is an arch with a shaped tower. Above the arch is a shield with the eagle of Saint John and the yoke and arrows of the Catholic Monarchs held by two angels. =Courtyard= The roofless courtyard with an area of 150×150 m2. The entire building is structured around the courtyard. =Church= Circular church inside building ensemble of Universidad Laboral de Gijon The tower of the Universidad Laboral Aerial view of the courtyard The church is considered the most spectacular building in the Universidad Laboral. With a surface area of 807 m2, it is the biggest church with an elliptical floor in the world. Outside, there is a figure of the Virgin of Covadonga with Corinthian columns sustaining the statues of saints Joseph, Peter, Paul and Ignatius. Above, St. James on horseback with two angels sustains the Victory Cross, the coat of arms of Asturias. The church has a 2,300-ton dome. The height between the floor and the highest point of the dome is 32 m. During construction, approximately 450,000 bricks were used. The floor is entirely covered with marble and the pews, which can hold one thousand people, are made of special wood from Equatorial Guinea and customized for the church. The pews have been removed. The church is unconsecrated and has no Catholic icon. It is currently used to host art exhibitions. =Theater= The theater has a Hellenic style facade and similar dimensions to the Parthenon. Above the central pediment there is a big coat of arms of Spain from 1945. The capacity of the theater is about 1,500. It was the first totally air-conditioned theater, using an underground system of air distribution. The frontispiece was decorated with a 120-m2 fresco of Enrique Segura. When the building was abandoned, it was damaged by humidity and was replaced by a big shell of wood to improve the acoustics. =Tower= With a height of 117 m, the tower is modeled after that of Giralda, the bell tower in the Cathedral of Seville. An elevator brings visitors to the balcony to enjoy sweeping views of Gijón. The tower of the Universidad Laboral is the tallest building in Asturias and the tallest stone building in Spain. Current uses Several institutions are located in the main building, such as LABoral Centro de Arte y Creación Industrial, faculties of the University of Oviedo, the Drama High School of Asturias and the Professional Music School of Gijón. Laboral Ciudad de la Cultura was inaugurated in 2007. In the rest of the lands bequeathed by the José Antonio Girón Foundation to the Universidad Laboral, other new facilities were created. In the Lloreda farm, a municipal golf course was created and in the Agronomic farm of Somió, the High School of the Universidad Laboral was built. The old convent of the Clarisas is now the headquarters of the Radiotelevisión del Principado de Asturias. The Hospital of Cabueñes, the municipal morgue, the Scienfic and Technologic Park and the Campus of Gijón, as part of the University of Oviedo, now occupy the former sporting grounds. The world center of Research and development of the German multinational ThyssenKrupp is located In the northern wing, with a building of about 2,000 m2. The Universidad Laboral has been used in several films, including those of the Spanish director José Luis Garci, La gran aventura de Mortadelo y Filemón and Fuga de Cerebros, which stood in for Oxford University.

The church, which is dedicated to St Andrew, is located at the junction of Bethune Road and Dunsmure Road in London N16. History Screen West end Chancel Sanctuary A temporary iron church was established on Manor Road in 1876. On 23 September 1883 the parish of Stoke Newington, St. Andrew was created from parts of the parishes of Saint Mary, Stoke Newington and Saint Thomas, Upper Clapton. It was one of several Hackney parishes listed by Charles Booth on his 1898–99 Poverty Map. The new parish's church, consecrated on 11 October 1884, was designed by Arthur Blomfield. The church's records, from 1883 to 1977, are held at the London Metropolitan Archives. Features The interior is particularly striking, and features the extensive use of murals, mostly by the Victorian designers Heaton, Butler and Bayne. Most of the murals have been painted directly onto the walls; only those at high level in the chancel are marouflage. The reredos paintings are on mahogany and portray the Crucifixion and the Apostles. The murals on the walls of the nave depict the life of Jesus from the Annunciation to the Ascension. Figures from the Old Testament and the New Testament are in the chancel above the string course. Heaton, Butler and Bayne also designed most of the stained glass in the church's windows. The windows on the south side of the church did not survive damage by a bomb on 18 July 1944, during the Second World War. The east window, dating from 1951, is by the Scottish stained glass artist William Wilson. The great west window was designed by Burlison and Grylls, largely as a First World War memorial, and was dedicated in 1919. It was rededicated on 15 November 2015 by the Bishop of Stepney, the Rt Revd Adrian Newman, at a celebration marking the completion of the first phase of the ongoing repairs to St Andrew's Church. The church also includes an unusual First World War memorial listing those from the parish who served and returned. It has been restored and is now hung in its original position at the east end of the north aisle. The font, designed by Blomfield in alabaster, dates from 1884. Blomfield also designed the pulpit. The organ is by Walker and Sons. Current activities St. Andrew's has a small faithful and diverse congregation. St. Andrew's received a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2014 to replace the roofs over the south aisle and south nave. Crumbling stonework and the west window have also been repaired. The chancel and north nave and aisle roofs remain to be done and substantial repairs are also required to the east window. Services The church's style of worship is in the Catholic tradition. Parish Eucharist is held on Sundays at 10:30am, followed by tea, coffee and biscuits. Midweek Eucharist is held on Tuesdays at 10am. The church is also open for Morning Prayer at 9.25am on Tuesdays and for Evening Prayer at 6.30pm on Thursdays. The priest in charge is the Revd Charis Enga.

As a left-handed sidearm pitcher with great disguises to hide the ball, he is known to throw most of his fastballs and sliders in a crossfire (from left to mid right edge of a right-handed batter's strike zone) against right-handers. This style makes Hader an extreme fly-ball pitcher.

It was first introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress (), and passed the House. It was again introduced during the 114th United States Congress in January 2015 by Rep. Mike Pompeo (R, KS-4), passed the House on January 21. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act would amend the Natural Gas Act to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to approve or deny a certificate of public convenience and necessity for a prefiled project within 12 months after receiving a complete application that is ready to be processed. If FERC failed to approve or deny the permit, within the 12 months, the license, permit would automatically be approved 30 days later. \\"Prefiled project\\" is defined as a natural gas pipeline project to which FERC has assigned a prefiling docket number for obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity. The bill would require the agency responsible for issuing any federal license, permit, or approval regarding the siting, construction, expansion, or operation of the gas pipeline(for example Clean Water Act or Clean Air Act related permits) to approve or deny it within 90 days after the FERC issues its final environmental document regarding the project. The bill would require the FERC to grant an agency request for a 30-day extension of the 90-day time period if the agency demonstrates that it cannot otherwise complete the process required to approve or deny the license, permit, or approval, and therefore will be compelled to deny it. The bill would direct the FERC to incorporate into the terms of a license, permit, or approval any conditions proffered by the agency that the FERC does not find to be inconsistent with the final environmental document. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on July 17, 2013. This is a public domain source. Under section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reviews applications to construct and operate interstate natural gas pipelines. Decisions pertaining to such applications depend on regulatory activities carried out by a variety of other federal agencies, as well as state and local governments pursuant to various other laws. H.R. 1900 would amend the Natural Gas Act to require FERC and other affected agencies to complete regulatory activities and reviews within timeframes specified in the bill. Based on information from the FERC and other federal agencies that regulate aspects of interstate natural gas pipelines, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that implementing H.R. 1900 would have no significant impact on the federal budget. The bill would not affect the scope of federal agencies’ responsibilities in overseeing such pipelines, and the CBO expects that meeting the timeframes specified in the bill would not require a significant change in the level of discretionary funding provided to affected agencies to meet their regulatory functions. Procedural history Rep. Mike Pompeo (R, KS-4) first introduced the Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act into the United States House of Representatives on May 9, 2013. It was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power. The Subcommittee held a hearing about the bill on July 8, 2013, and marked up the bill on July 10 and July 11, 2013. The full Committee considered and markedup the bill further on July 16 . On July 17, 2013, the Committee ordered the bill reported (amended) by a vote of 28-14. On November 15, 2013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that the bill would be considered on November 21, 2013. On November 18, 2013, the bill was reported (amended). Mike Paesano reintroduced the bill as HR 161 in the House on January 6, 2015, which passed on January 22,2015 and went to the Senate. Debate and discussion In 2013, the National Taxpayers Union was in favor of the bill and urged Representatives to vote yes because \\"by smoothing the regulatory hurdles and creating an environment of certainty for investors, H.R. 1900 would give consumers increased access to low-cost energy options and spur job-growth in an essential sector of our economy.\\" The Army Corps of Engineers, Environmental Protection Agency, Bureau of Land Management, and Fish and Wildlife Service all agencies that would implement the law, raised concerns about the bill. President Barack Obama and his staff opposed the bill, and the president threatened to veto it. The Administration argued that \\"the bill's requirements could force agencies to make decisions based on incomplete information or information that may not be available within the stringent deadlines, and to deny applications that otherwise would have been approved, but for lack of sufficient review time.\\" One dispute centered on how long it currently takes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to approve permits. The President stated, that the \\"FERC has reported that, since fiscal year 2009, it has completed action on 92 percent (504 out of 548) of all pipeline applications that it has received within one year of receipt.\\" The National Taxpayers Union, on the other hand, cites a contradictory source, saying that \\"a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report from February 2013 found that the many stages and steps of the permitting process, that often vary from state to state, can quickly bog down projects. The GAO explains that 'for those projects that were approved from January 2010 to January 2012, the average time from pre-filing to certification was 558 days...'\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress Notes/References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 1900 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 1900 *GovTrack.us H.R. 1900 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 1900 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 1900 *House Report 113-269 on H.R. 1900 *Fact Sheet on H.R. 1900 from the House Energy and Commerce Committee *Congressional Budget Office report on H.R. 1900 *House Republican Conference's legislative digest on H.R. 1900 *White House Statement of Administration Policy (veto threat) Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Proposed legislation of the 114th United States Congress United States federal energy legislation ","title":"Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act"},{"id":"41149016","text":"Hugh D.

It was established in 1993 and covers an area of 93,333 hectares. Huishan Mountain The park gets its name from the Huishan Mountain, which is a section of the larger Tianmushan Mountain. The park has numerous peaks, but the most prominent are the 328-meter-high Toumao Peak, Emao Peak, and Sanmao Peak. These peaks are collectively known as the Nine-Dragon Mountain. This area is endowed with many natural springs, and is specially renowned for its thirteen springs. The Huishan Mountain is widely regarded the first mountain in southern China. Reforestation The Huishan National Forest Park area was one of the richest wildernesses in China in the 1950s. Back then, over five million trees stood in the area. But in the decades of China's feverish economic development and urban sprawl most of that wilderness was greatly exploited. Efforts to return the area to its former green glory were begun in 1982 by planting 370,000 trees. This massive reforestation project and subsequent developments have made the park one of the most-visited areas in southern China.

The lake is named for Henri St. George, French-born son of French Royalist, and one-time settler in Upper Canada Laurent Quetton St. George. Henri St. George settled in Upper Canada in 1847 and established his Glen Lonely estate in Richmond Hill, which contained the lake that bears his name. Lake St. George Conservation Field Centre St. George died in 1896 and the property was owned by various people over the following decades. Robert Davies, the son of William Davies (founder of Canada Packers) purchased the property in 1906 and built the large estate house now known as 'Davies Hall'. After Davies death, the Glen Lonely lands were bought by Schuyler Snively, a World War 1 veteran, who transformed the property into a successful dairy farm, and model country estate.

With Marjory's passing in 1968 and Schuyler in 1971, the sale of the land was complete.

Apart from diversifying their larders and redistributing surpluses and gluts, they provide opportunities for building stronger communities, and picking up tips. No money changes hands. Attendees bring items that they wish to swap and then bid for each other's produce, either verbally or on cards in the form of a silent auction, until suitable swaps are negotiated. Often attendees bring extra items either as free samples or as contributions to a potluck lunch or tea, so that there is more time to get to know each other, exchange gossip and pass on tips. History Food has been swapped and traded since prehistoric times, from cacao beans to spices, fresh-killed meat to foraged berries. The Food Swap Network started in Brooklyn, New York in 2010, and 125 groups have been established across the US and Canada, as well as in Europe including the UK. 'Apples for Eggs' is a produce-sharing network set up in the UK in 2011. 'Apples for Eggs' has 159 registered swappers and organises events in York, Ormskirk, Henley, Stoke, and Brampton in Cumbria. There are similar events in Brazil, Denmark, France and the Netherlands. Procedure There are several networks that organise food swaps, but anyone can create an event. The organisers provide premises, which may be a person's home, or a community building, publicise the event, and may also provide swapping cards or in some other way specify a procedure to be followed. The organisers may also provide tables and seating and may lay on teas and coffees for the attendees, or at least provide hot water and utensils for them to make their own. Attendees may be advised to package their produce both for good looks and for transportability. While attendees kitchens are unlikely to be certified nut-free or have Food Standards Agency guarantees of cleanliness, swappers may be asked to specify ingredients, whether an item can be considered vegetarian or vegan, storage instructions, and a suggested use- by date, all based on trust and judgement. Items may be grouped into swappable units, for example six cup-cakes may be equivalent to one loaf of bread, or three small fresh-caught fish. Swappers cruise the room, noting their interest by filling in bid cards at the different stands before the big exchange starts. Teas and coffees, or a potluck lunch provide an opportunity for people to get to know each other, and to swap recipes and tips. Attendees are usually asked to bring free samples of their wares, or some other items to share with others during the lunch or tea. Afterwards, bid cards are finalised, and finally, people actually swap their goods with others and clear up the room. If a food swap event last two hours, the timetable may be as follows: During the first 30 minutes people sign-in, set-up, and greetings go on. Swappers fill out name tags and swap sheets and set up their wares on the tables. The next 30 minutes to 1 hour are for everyone to walk around, examine, and sample items from other swappers, writing swap bids on other swappers' cards. Potluck tea or lunch may take place here too. The final 30 minutes are when all the swapping actually happens. Everyone goes back to their own bid cards, looks at the offers, finds interested offerers via their name tags, and swaps. Reception Organisers of food swaps say the idea is part of a \\"new type of collectivism\\" including skills sharing and clothes swapping, and that it also feeds into current trends for thrift, recycling and making things yourself. The aims of food swapping are said to be to reduce waste, save people money, and bring communities together. Vicky Swift, who runs 'Apples for Eggs', told the BBC that the growing popularity of food swaps is about more than just food. \\"They are really social events and you get such a mix of people, from university students to pensioners. I think people like the sense of community that a food swap provides and you meet like-minded people with the same interests. People mingle, chat and swap expertise.\\" She added to The Telegraph, \\"There’s something very bonding about exchanging goods with someone you haven’t met before, and when you meet them again, you feel you’ve made a lasting connection. We really are seeing little communities blossom around these events.\\" Martin Dolce, a UK food swapper, explained that when it's time to swap, you've got to move fast. \\"The first time I was forewarned that it would get a bit frantic. I thought: 'I'm a businessman, I can handle it.' I didn't know what was going on and I missed the choice stuff. Now I proactively go and grab something I like: you want that, I've got that, boom. The first five minutes are crucial.\\" The Guardian warns that food swapping isn't for everyone. Nicki Jones, at a UK food swap said, \\"This would be my mother's worst nightmare. She couldn't bear the thought of having anyone else's things.\\" See also *Gift economy *Seed swap *Transition Towns References Giving Community building Eating parties Food- and drink-related events Private aid programs ","title":"Food swap"},{"id":"41149392","text":"Dovid Halberstam (1821–1894) was a religious leader of the Hasidic Jewish community of Chrzanow.  Family life  Interior with Rebbe, Father and Son, author unknown, 19th century Dovid Halberstam was the second son of Chaim Halberstam or Divrei Chaim, the founder of the Sanz Hasidic dynasty of rebbes, which enjoyed enormous influence over the Hasidic Jewry in Western Galicia during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Raised in a family of enormous prestige, from childhood and early youth he was exposed to Talmudist, poskim and Kabbalistic disputes of his time, and was trained to be a religious leader. Like his older brother Yechezkel Halberstam he did not succeed his father in Sanz; the rabbinical position went to his younger brother Aharon Halberstam instead. Married twice, Halberstam had at least three sons, Moses, Joshua and Naftoli, and a number of grandsons. Many of them became distinct figures within the Chrzanow Hasidic population. He is buried at the Chrzanow Jewish cemetery, his family ohel is well maintained.  Leadership  old Chrzanow Dovid Halberstam's matzeva It is not clear if Halberstam had served as rebbe before moving to Chrzanow; also the exact date of him assuming the post is unknown (probably around 1860). During his tenure, he became engaged in the growing rivalry between the Sanz and the Radomsker schools. Though the Radomsk leader, Tiferes Schlomo, was a disciple of his father and the two maintained fairly respectful relations, Dovid Halberstam aggravated them by his personal intransigence. Highly respected as a religious leader, Halberstam was appreciated for his scholarly competence and pious zeal. However, he turned out to be a divisive figure within the local Jewish community. This was due to rigorous application of his teaching, his firm grip on the leadership and the uncompromising style. As a result, a number of civil libel charges were brought against him. Also, despite some attempts, his authority has never stretched beyond the Chrzanow area. Over time the influence of Halberstam grew so significant that he became the founder of the dynasty of Chrzanow rebbes, which guided the Jewish population of the town for almost a century. His son Naftoli and then his grandson Mendel succeeded him at the post and led the local religious community until its destruction in 1942-1943.

The book was first published on September 3, 2013 through Little, Brown Books for Young Readers and follows Tana, a teenager that believes that she has been infected with vampirism. The basis for the novel came from a short story of the same name written by Black which was released in the prose anthology Eternal Kiss. Black was inspired to use the setting and the same title to tell the story of a different character set in the same world as the short story. The book was written to be a standalone novel and while Black has stated that she is not adverse to writing a sequel, she has no plans to do so at this point in time. Summary Vampires were hidden, hunting in secret, when one newly turned vampire, Caspar, decided not to kill his victims. Vampire bites infect the bitten, and they turn Cold. Once they turn Cold, a person can become a vampire by drinking human blood. Caspar's victims turned around and created legions of new vampires before the governments around the world knew what was happening. Once the government started policing vampires and people who are Cold, they started sending them to Coldtowns so they could not infect or kill innocent people. The Coldtowns attracted many people, who were drawn in by the perceived glamor of vampires. Once in Coldtown, it was nearly impossible to leave a Coldtown. At the beginning of the story, Tana wakes up in a bathtub after a wild high school party. When she walks out, she sees all of her classmates have been slaughtered by vampires, with the exception for her ex-boyfriend, Aidan, who has been bitten and tied to a bed. Next to him is a shackled vampire. Below them, in the basement, the vampires are awakening to come back up and kill them. Tana saves both Aidan and Gavriel, the captive vampire, but in her escape, one of the vampires nicks her leg with his fang. Afraid that she will turn Cold (into a vampire), she takes Gavriel, Aidan, and herself to the nearest Coldtown. On the way, they pick up Midnight and Winter, twins who are obsessed with going to Coldtown and becoming vampires. Midnight is more enthused than her twin brother, and she has a popular blog that chronicles her obsession with vampires. Once in Coldtown, Tana realizes that Gavriel is the Thorn of Istra, and she realizes he is there to kill Lucien. They share a passionate kiss before he disappears for the morning light. Midnight and Winter turn on Aidan and Tana. They want Aidan to turn, and they leave Tana with him to sate his new hunger. However, Tana escapes, and Aidan kills another girl who set them up. Tana gets help by Jameson and Valentina, two humans in Coldtown. She goes to Lucien's famous party with Valentina to get back her pass to the outside (which Aidan had stolen). Midnight has turned into a vampire, after killing her twin brother, and she attacks Tana, who officially becomes infected with the Cold. Gavriel is at the party but appears to make a truce with Lucien, and they decide to kill the head vampire, the Spider. Valentina is captured and put into the dungeon, and Tana kills a vampire to save her. She drinks the vampire blood before being caught and put back into her room. She learns Lucien is going to turn on Gavriel and that her little sister, Pearl, has come to Coldtown to find her. She helps Valentina escape with Jameson's mom (who is one of the vampires who works for Lucien). Jameson, his mom, and Valentina promise to help find Pearl to keep her safe. Tana goes back into the mansion to kill Lucien and save Gavriel. She fails in her attempt, but then realizes that Gavriel is the Spider. He reveals this fact to Lucien, who gets scared. Then, Tana kills Lucien after he attacks her. At the end of the story, Aidan saves Pearl, who is given the pass out of Coldtown by Tana. Jameson finds a place where Tana can hole up to wait out the infection and Gavriel comes down to be with Tana and tells her that he loves her. The story ends with Gavriel promising to stay with Tana until she gets better, and, if she is no longer human enough to do so, to help her get enough vampire blood to sate her appetite. Reception Critical reception for The Coldest Girl in Coldtown has been predominantly positive and the book has received praise from Commonsensemedia, the Royal Oak Public Library, and Booklist. Strange Horizons praised the book heavily, writing that it was a \\"sharp, lavish, engaging book that not only manages to revitalize vampires, but lends itself easily to salient discussions of modern Western culture and American politics. A timely novel in every sense of the word, and one I'd very much recommend, both to existing fans of Holly Black and to anyone thinking of giving her a try.\\" Tor.com and io9 also wrote positive reviews, Tor.com commented that the book would have a great appeal to people who liked \\"old- school vampires\\" and were potentially growing tired of vampires as depicted in popular media like Twilight and The Vampire Diaries. The School Library Journal was somewhat more mixed in their review and the reviewer stated that while they greatly enjoyed the book, it did have flaws such as the pacing and that \\"Tana’s risky behavior and generally troubled self is something the reader hears about but actually, from moment one she’s thoughtful and has a tendency to basic human decency, so the emotional core is satisfying but not astounding — because it’s actually inevitable given how Tana is written.\\" =Awards= *School Library Journal Best Book of the Year (2013) *Texas’s Tayshas Reading List Top Ten (2014) *YALSA Best Fiction for Young Adults (2014) *YALSA Amazing Audiobooks for Young Adults (2014) References External links * 2013 American novels ","title":"The Coldest Girl in Coldtown"},{"id":"41149447","text":" bif2 barren inflorescence2 gene in Maize  barren inflorescence phenotype of recessive mutation in bif2, with greatly reduced number of tassel branches, spikelets, and anthers.

The nucleolytic activity of this ribozyme has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro and has one of the fastest catalytic rates of naturally occurring ribozymes with similar function. The twister ribozyme is considered to be a member of the small self-cleaving ribozyme family which includes the hammerhead, hairpin, hepatitis delta virus (HDV), Varkud satellite (VS), and glmS ribozymes.  Discovery  In contrast to in vitro selection methods, which have aided in identifying several classes of catalytic RNA motifs, the twister ribozyme was discovered by a bioinformatics approach as a conserved RNA structure of unknown function. The hypothesis that it functions as a self- cleaving ribozyme was suggested by the similarity between genes nearby to twister ribozymes and genes nearby to hammerhead ribozymes, Indeed the genes located nearby to these two self-cleaving ribozyme classes overlap significantly. Researchers were inspired to name the newly found twister motif due to its resemblance to the Egyptian hieroglyph 'twisted flax'.  Structure  The basic structure of the Oryza sativa twister ribozyme was crystallographically determined at atomic resolution in 2014. The active site of the twister ribozyme is centered in a double-pseudoknot, facilitating a compact fold structure through two long-range tertiary interactions, in partnership with a helical junction. Magnesium is important for secondary structure stabilization of the ribozyme.  Catalytic Mechanism  Similar to other nucleolytic ribozymes, the twister ribozyme selectively cleaves phopshodiester bonds, through an SN2-related mechanism, into a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and 5' hydroxyl product. Both experimental and modelling evidence have supported a concerted general-acid-base catalysis involving highly conserved adenine (A1) and guanine (G33) bases, where N3 of A1 acts as a proton donor and G33 the general base. The twister ribozyme generates catalytic activity by specifically orienting the to-be-cleaved P O bond for in-line nucleophilic attack within the active site. Currently, it is known that the rate of reaction of the twister ribozyme is dependent on both pH and temperature. Replacements of the pro-S nonbridging oxygen of the scissile phosphate with a thiol group leads to reduced self-cleavage rates, suggesting that the mechanism is not reliant on bound magnesium. Rescue of the thiol- derivative by cadmium cations indicates that divalent metal ions play a role in rate enhancement. A likely mechanism for this is the stabilization of the transition state by reducing electrostatic strain on the substrate strand from the growing negative charge during cleavage.  Prevalence in Nature  The twister ribozyme motif is relatively common in nature with 2,700 examples observed across bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. Similarly to hammerhead ribozymes, some eukaryotes contain large numbers of twister ribozymes. In the most extreme known example, there are 1051 predicted twister ribozymes in Schistosoma mansoni, an organism that also contains many hammerhead ribozymes. In bacteria, twister ribozymes are near to gene classes that are also commonly associated with bacterial hammerhead ribozymes. Currently, there is no understood biological function associated with the twister ribozyme.
