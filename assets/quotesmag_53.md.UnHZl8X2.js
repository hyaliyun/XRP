It ranges over much of the western part of the continent, from central Saskatchewan and central Washington to Tamaulipas in northeast Mexico.  Background information  The northern grasshopper mouse is found in North America, but primarily in dry areas. They are similar in body size to other mice; on average they are long and about in weight. The tail is most often less than 30% of the total body length, whereas other mice tend to have longer tails adding to long body lengths. The grasshopper mouse is a reddish-black/grey color with white hair on the belly. Unlike most rodents, this one has a mostly carnivorous diet mainly consisting of small insects, other mice, and even snakes; no more than a quarter of its diet is plant-based. This rodent is also nocturnal. Throughout the night, the grasshopper mouse makes high-pitched noises to claim its territory. Habitat This grasshopper mouse can be found in prairies with low grass, dry areas, and also pasture lands of the central and southwestern parts of the United States. O. leucogaster has been known to associate positively with black-tailed prairie dogs, possibly due to their preference for disturbed areas, suitable habitat in the form of burrows, or food supply.Choate, J. R. and D. M. Terry. 1974. Observations on habitat preference of Onychomys leucogaster (Rodentia: Muridae) on the central Great Plains. Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science 76:263-265.Stapp, P. 1997. Habitat selection by an insectivorous rodent: patterns and mechanisms across multiple scales. Journal of Mammalogy 78: 1128-1143.Bala Thiagarajan. 2006. Community dynamics of rodents, fleas and plague associated with the black-tailed prairie dogs. Doctoral dissertation submitted to Kansas State University. The northern grasshopper mouse lives in burrows underground, by either digging its own or inhabiting burrows that have been disowned. These mice have a system of multiple burrows, with each burrow serving a different function. The nest burrow is the primary area of activity during the day; since they are nocturnal, they do not need to be in a burrow during the night. To keep moisture in during the day, they close up the opening. A retreat burrow serves for quick escape from predators. Its design is about 10 inches into the ground at a 45¬∞ angle. The cache burrow is used for storing seeds. The signpost burrows are small and filled with glandular secretions that mark the boundaries of their territory. All of these burrows are found within a large area of territory. Reproduction The northern grasshopper mouse has about two or three litters a year consisting of two to seven young, with the average being four. They have a gestation of 32‚Äì47 days, and the young are born in either late fall or early winter, between September and February. The male gathers and provides food for the female while she is pregnant and taking care of her young.Burt, W.H., R.P. Grossenheider. 1976. The Peterson Field Guide Series: A Field Guide to the Mammals. Peterson, R.A. (Ed.). Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston, p.166-67. The northern grasshopper mouse is an altricial species; baby mice are naked with closed eyes when they are born, and weigh about three grams. Both sexes reach their sexual maturity at three months, but the lifespan of a typical mouse living in the wild is only a few weeks to a few months. Diseases Susceptibility studies on grasshopper mice from areas with plague and from those areas that have been historically free of plague by Thomas et al. (1988)Thomas, R. E., A. M. Barnes, T. J. Quan , M. L. Beard , L. G. Carter, and C. E. Hopla. 1988. Susceptibility to Yersinia pestis in the northern grasshopper mouse (Onychomys leucogaster). Journal of Wildlife Diseases 24:327‚Äì33. showed the animals from areas with a history of plague were more resistant to the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis than the animals from a historically plague-free area, hence they were considered to be a potential alternate host for plague. Grasshopper mice have also been shown to harbor 57 species of fleas, many of which are vectors of plague.6) Thomas, R. E. 1988. A review of flea collection records from Onychomys leucogaster with observations on the role of grasshopper mice in the epizoology of wild rodent plague. Great Basin Naturalist 48: 83-95. Given the abundance and diversity of fleas on the grasshopper mouse and their use of prairie dog burrows and interaction with other rodent species, they are considered to be important for the maintenance and transmission of plague in the prairie dog ecosystem.Gage, K. L., and M. Y. Kosoy. 2005. Natural history of the plague: perspectives from more than a century of research. Annual Review of Entomology 50:505 - 528.

Included in these renovations was the installation of Steve Irwins own water cannon for use in campaigns. After departing drydock, the ship toured around Australia, finally arriving in Fremantle to begin final preparations for Operation Waltzing Matilda, which she embarked upon on December 7. After three days, a suspected Japanese-chartered aircraft located the Steve Irwin en route to the Southern Ocean and instructed the to observe the movements of the vessel. Contact with the security ship was made on December 10, with Steve Irwin launching her helicopter and Delta RHIB to gather information on the vessel.

It remains a rare pristine look at the electronics and facilities created in that era that helped the United States grow its space capabilities. The last launch from this complex was a Thor booster in 1980. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986. and It is undergoing an eight-year restoration, and public visits are possible, if arranged in advance.NPS History of Aviation History The launch complex was built in 1958 by the Douglas Aircraft Corporation, and was first designated Complex 75-2. At that time it consisted of three launch pads, which were used to train military operators of PGM-17 Thor ballistic missiles, and to conduct missile launch tests. The first launches were conducted by the British Royal Air Force in June and August 1959. The facilities at SLC-10 were dismantled and transported to Johnston Island in support of Operation Dominic, a nuclear weapons testing project conducted there in 1962. The launch complex was rebuilt in 1963 to support the development of Burner rockets, with two launch pads, designated SLC-10E and SLC-10W. Tests were conducted at SLC-10W from 1965 to 1980, using the Thor satellite launch vehicles, the first stages of which followed the design of the Thor missile. Surviving elements Two launch pads and a prefabricated launch blockhouse are the principal surviving elements of the complex. The blockhouse interior still includes all of the electrical equipment used in later launches. SLC-10W also includes pipes and storage facilities for storing and managing the liquid fuel used in the rockets.

It has around 50 current members including actors, designers, directors, and stage managers. History In 1995, The Elephant Theatre Company was created in downtown Los Angeles. Artistic Directors, David Fofi and Lindsay Allbaugh, along with other graduates from the California State University, Long Beach Theatre Arts program moved into a space at the Angel City Brewery artist complex. The space doubled as a Studio Theater and the loft apartment for the original founders. Focused on their desire to continue their craft after graduation they renovated the space creating a small theatre and living quarters and gave it the name of \\"Elephant Off Main\\". The loft was 110 degrees, the tech booth was in a bedroom and audiences sat on couches and beanbags. The mission of the company and its founders was to produce a new brand of quality original theatre in Los Angeles. In the summer of 1997, the small 45-seat theater could no longer accommodate the advancing production needs or the increasing audience attendance. The Company then moved to Hollywood (and dropped the ‚ÄúOff Main‚Äù). David Fofi along with founding member Don Cesario continued to produce Elephant productions in various Hollywood venues. During their 1998/1999 season, the company moved into its long-term home, located at 6322 Santa Monica Boulevard, in Los Angeles' Theatre Row District. This created five performance spaces (the Lillian Theatre, the Elephant Space, the Elephant Studio, the Elephant ASYLUM, and the ASYLUM Lab), known as The Elephant Stages. With these additions came the necessity to form the business/producing entity called Elephant Stageworks, overseeing both venue operations and Theatre Company endeavors. In 2015, the theatre building was sold by its landlord to a neighboring school. The last produced show in the Lillian (\\"The Great Divide\\" by Lyle Kessler) closed on August 23, 2015. The Elephant Theatre was left without a permanent space, and as of September 2015 was determining whether to continue on as a company.http://losangeles.bitter-lemons.com/2015/03/16/long-standing-multi- award-winning-los-angeles-theater-company-elephant-stages-to-close-up-shop-in- september/#sthash.CFiEkRkB.dpbshttp://losangeles.bitter- lemons.com/2015/03/16/long-standing-multi-award-winning-los-angeles-theater- company-elephant-stages-to-close-up-shop-in-september/#sthash.CFiEkRkB.dpbs Name As the founders geared up for the first production, an evening of early Sam Shepard shorts, the question arose: ‚ÄúWhat should we call this thing we have created, this group, this space?‚Äù Over a few beers and many terrible suggestions, one of the directors came across this quote: ‚ÄúWhen Sam (Shepard) was first starting to write plays, he was writing little, almost chamber plays. Sam was working on something and we were sitting and talking about some scene he wanted to do, and he said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think that could be done anyway on the stage. There‚Äôs no point to doing it.‚Äô And I said, ‚ÄòLook, Sam if you want an Elephant to appear on the stage without walking on from the wings, you should just write it and see what happens from it, and then see if there‚Äôs a way to do it, or a way to make it.‚Äô‚Äù -Jacques Levy This idea spoke to the founding members. The challenge of ‚ÄúThe Elephant.‚Äù Hence the name, one that conjures theatrical daring, invention and imagination. In that loft the company's seed was planted.

King & Company, 1874, \\"Guest\\" derives from a place and not from the occupational status of some ancient forebear given to chronic visiting. Other theories suggest a spiritual concept i.e. \\"guests on this earth\\", or a polite substitute for \\"serf\\". Guest, the place, was near Caen, Normandy, and the original bearers of the name are said to have taken part in the Norman Conquest of England under William I in 1066. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Benwoldus Guest. This was dated 1100 in the Old English Names Register, during the reign of King William II of England, 1087‚Äì1100. After the conquest, the family settled in Salop (now Shropshire) in middle-western England and apparently held the estate known as Lega from the De Dunstanvilles.The Norman People and Their Existing Descendants in the British Dominions and the United States of America, H.S. King & Company, 1874 - Great Britain - 484 pages, https://books.google.com/books?id=BFxJAAAAMAAJ&dq;=Wembridge+Priory&source;=gbs_navlinks_s Some ancient land records show Alan De Guest granting the lands of Alric de Lega (Guest) to a monastery called Wembridge Priory in 1150. His son Thomas (a name which occurs frequently in the Guest line) is mentioned in 1180. Some of the other Guests of antiquity were Thomas' sons Walter and Leonard, referred to in 1194 and 1280; and Henry, son of Leonard, 1240. Roger de Lega, or Guest, brother of Henry, had a son Thomas who again gave lands to Wembridge Priory. In 1295 Adam Gest (another variant of the name) was assessor of the parliamentary rolls in Salop. From this Norman race descended Bishop Edmund Guest (1518‚Äì1577) who became the Bishop of Salisbury (1571‚Äì1577) and was one of the Reformers. He was the distributor of alms on behalf of Queen Elizabeth from 1560‚Äì1572. Also of note is the eminent manufacturer Sir John Guest (1785-1852) a baronet and the elder son of Thomas Guest, part owner of the Dowlais Iron Works, who died in 1807. History records as well the names of George Guest (1771‚Äì1831), an organist and composer who lived in Shropshire; Thomas Douglas Guest (1803‚Äì1839) an historical and portrait painter and Joshua Guest of Yorkshire (1660‚Äì1747) a Lieutenant General whose regiment fought in the Irish Campaign under William III. Other examples taken from church registers: Margaret Geeste married Thomas Emberson on October 5, 1546 at St. Margarets Westminster, and Edward Guest married Joane Willson at St. Botolphs Bishopsgate, city of London on September 9, 1632. Some Guests migrated to Ireland either as part of Henry II's (1166‚Äì1172) or any of the other various conquerors' (i.e. Oliver Cromwell's) armies or support people. Ireland had been connected with England from the time of when the Anglo-Norman barons in the 12th century invaded Ireland and set up English rule; however, effective control of the island eluded the English until almost the end of the Tudor period in the mid-sixteenth century. Waves of Guests migrated to the New World such as Elizabeth Guest arriving in Maryland in 1637, Walter Guest in Maryland in 1640, George Guest in Virginia in 1647, Anthony Guest in Virginia in 1663, Thomas Guest in New York in 1812, and John Guest in Pennsylvania in 1840.

Life =Early years= He was an illegitimate son of August the Strong, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, by the Turk Fatima (or Fatime), who was captured during the Battle of Buda by Hans Adam von Sch√∂ning. After she became the King's mistress, she was christened Maria Anna and moved to the Dresden court. The child got the name of his father, but shortly after the birth Fatima was married at the instigation of Augustus to his chamberman Johann Georg of Spiegel. Frederick Augustus moved to the estates of the Spiegel Family, but his father cared about his education, which led him among other things to go to Paris, where he found his half-sister Anna Karolina (the later countess Orzelska) and brought her to Dresden. Fatima, despite her marriage, remained a mistress of Augustus. In 1706, she gave birth to the King's second child, a daughter, called Maria Anna Katharina. However, soon Frederick Augustus and his sister became orphans: Johann Georg of Spiegel died in 1715 and their mother Fatima five years later. Augustus the Strong took the guardianship of the children, but he only recognized and legitimized them both in 1724. Shortly after, he raised both, as his right of King of Poland, with the Polish title of Count Rutowski and Countess Rutowska. The coat of arms awarded to them shows a Saxon rhombus wreath as well as a Polish White Eagle. On 8 October 1724 Frederick August, now Count Rutowski, obtained of his father the highest decoration of the Wettin lands, the Order of the White Eagle, which gave him the rank of an Oberst of the Saxon Army. Military career After a journey to Munich and Venice, Rutowski arrived in February 1725 at the court of the King of Sardinia and Duke of Savoy, Victor Amadeus II in Turin, where he took command of the Piedmont regiment and was garrisoned in Alessandria. It is possible his enjoyment of this city prompted him to write his father, asking permission to enter in French services in order to remain in Turin. His father refused this request and demanded his return. On 26 May 1727 he became a Major-General in the Saxon Army and shortly after he served under the Prussians; however, in 1729 he returned again to the Saxon Army. During the following years, in the War of Polish Succession, he participated in the campaigns in Poland and on the Rhine, becoming Lieutenant-General on 1 January 1736 and Commander of the Garde du Corps. As such he was in 1737 the leader of the Saxon Contingent in the War against the Turks in Hungary. On 21 April 1738 he became General of the Cavalry, on 9 August 1740 Governor of Dresden and Commander of the Grenadier Guard, Obristhaus on 10 August and Landzeugmeister. On 10 January 1742 he was appointed Commander of a Dragoon's Regiment. During the First Silesian War he commanded the Saxon troops in Bohemia and participated on the 26 November 1742 in the storming of Prague. Frederick Augustus commanded the troops which stayed behind in Saxony, and fought with these troops and the biggest part of the Saxon Army coming back from Bohemia the battle of Kesselsdorf near Dresden (15 December 1745), where they suffered a crucial defeat in the Second Silesian War against the Prince Leopold I of Anhalt-Dessau. On 6 January 1746 he was ranked General en Chef, and on 11 January 1749, at last, he was appointed Field Marshal. During the next peace years, he did not succeed in spite of multiple efforts, to avert the cutbacks in the Saxon Army by the prime minister Br√ºhl, which seriously reduced its effectiveness. =Siege of Pirna= At the sudden outbreak of the Seven Years' War, he concentrated the Saxon Army of only 18,100 men in a strong defensive position near Pirna. He withstood a siege of 6 weeks, but had to capitulate on 16 October 1756, and became a prisoner of King Frederick II of Prussia. During the years of war Rutowsky stayed in Saxony and renounced all his military functions directly after the Treaty of Hubertusburg on 8 March 1763. He died one year later, aged sixty-two. Marriage and issue On 4 January 1739 Frederick Augustus married with the Princess Ludovika Amalie Lubomirska. Their only child, August Joseph, Count Rutowsky (b. 2 August 1741) died of smallpox in Brunswick, 17 January 1755. 1702 births 1764 deaths 18th-century Polish people Illegitimate children of Polish monarchs Counts of Germany Frederick Augustus Field marshals of Saxony German military personnel of the War of the Austrian Succession Polish people of Turkish descent People of the Silesian Wars Albertine branch ","title":"Frederick Augustus Rutowsky"},{"id":"14324704","text":"Ibrahim Som√© Salombo (born 24 May 1988 in Kinshasa) is a Congolese football striker who is currently playing for Olympic Charleroi in the Belgian Second Amateur Division.

She was the last surviving example of some 225 wooden steam schooners that served the lumber trade and other coastal services along the Pacific Coast of the United States. She was managed by the National Park Service at San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park until dismantled in August 2013. Wapama was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1984; the designation was withdrawn in 2015.  Design  Wapama was a two-masted, wooden schooner with a beam and a depth of , net tonnage of 524, but a gross tonnage of 945. The Wapama was constructed in by St. Helens Shipbuilding Company, a subsidiary of the Charles McCormick Lumber Company, on Sauvie Island in Columbia County, Oregon in 1915. James Price was the master builder of the ship and oversaw a crew of 85‚Äì100 men at the company during the time of the Wapamas construction. The shipyard launched the incomplete Wapama, described as \\"little more than a finished hull\\", in a celebration on January 20, 1915. The ship was then towed to San Francisco by the Klamath for completion, but the ship drifted free during the tow and had to be caught by the tug Goliah of Merchants and Shipowners. The tow was completed by the first ship built by the St. Helens Shipbuilding Company, the Multnomah. Through February and March 1915, Main Street Iron Works installed the engine whilst the accommodations for passengers and crew were also completed. The Wapama officially entered into the service of the McCormick Lumber Company on April 29, 1915 and it cost a total of $150,000. The San Francisco Examiner reported, \\"The vessel will have accommodations [sic] for forty-five cabin passengers and fifteen steerage. The lumber carrying capacity will be 1,100,000 board feet.\\"  Service  Early on, the ownership of the Wapama was operated by the Charles R. McCormick Lumber Company, but changed for legal or corporate reasons. In 1915, it was sold to the Wapama Steamship Company for $10 and evidence indicates that additional investors owned a stake in the ship. In November 1922, the ship was transferred to the McCormick Steamship Company, after all other shareholders were bought out. In September 1925, it was transferred to the Charles R. McCormick Lumber Company. Throughout its service in the McCormick company, the Wapama transported passengers and cargo from San Francisco to the Northwest. In the Northwest, the ship would load lumber and passengers before returning to San Francisco. The ship would occasionally tow other vessels, like the lumber schooner Alpena and the whaler Bowhead, but were opportunistic and done at sea. The crew originally numbered 31, but was consolidated to 26 in 1927. The ship was sold to the Los Angeles-San Francisco Navigation Company of Claudine C. Gillespie, Albert E. Gillespie, and Charles Gillespie on May 20, 1930. It served as a passenger and cargo ship between the two cities and included a service that allowed passengers to transport their automobiles as well. It was sold to Erik Krag, president of the Viking Steamship Company, a subsidiary of Inter-Ocean Steamship Corporation, a company run by Erik Krag and Harry Brown, for $12,500 on April 20, 1937. The ship made two passenger runs, at lost, before it was sold to the Alaska Transportation Company for $27,000 on December 23, 1937. Now under the ownership of the Alaska Transportation Company the ship was renamed the Tongass on February 4, 1938. The ship was refitted for cargo service by the Lake Union Dry Dock and Construction Company and completed in May 1938, the alterations raised the ship to 999 gross tons and 524 net tons. Only the record of its final run remains, but the ship carried \\"passengers, mail, and general cargo to Alaskan port towns and returned with a cargo mainly composed of frozen fish. The crews on the Alaska run usually numbered around thirty men and included a pilot and purser.\\" In 1948, it was sold to Jack Mendelsohn and Son for scrapping, but survived and was sold to the California Division of Beaches and Parks for $16,000 on January 10, 1958. Throughout its commercial service, the Wapama had several accidents and mishaps. On November 27, 1915, the ship grounded on silt in the Fraser River and was refloated only to ground again on December 6 in San Francisco, both times without damage. On May 17, 1917, the Wapama had a collision with the steamer Doris and a month later on June 16, grounded on mud near San Diego, both without damage. The first serious accident was in December 1932, when the masts were snapped during loading cargo. Another accident of unknown date resulted in \\"extensive damage\\" when the Wapama collided with a breakwater in Long Beach. On May 10, 1947, in Seattle there was a collision with the steamer Reff Knot that increased the leaking of the hull. A Coast Guard inspection on June 6, 1947, noted the hull was in fair condition, but the ship was going to be removed from service and later sold for scrap in 1948. The last mishap occurred in the 1950s in Seattle when a fire broke out in the engine room.  Museum ship  In the 1950s, a group of California maritime enthusiasts formed the San Francisco Maritime Museum with the intention of preserving the history and ships of regional importance. Expertise was provided from the museum and funding from the state to acquire the C. A. Thayer and the Tongass. In January 1958, the Tongass was sold for $16,000 and its initial repairs were overseen by Captain Adrian Raynaud. The vessel was drydocked for two weeks in August and September 1958 to remove the old masts and inspect, clean and repair of the bottom of the vessel. The hull was caulked and painted, \\"camouflaging\\" yet assisting in the preservation of the ship until a proper restoration could be done. This \\"minimal amount\\" of work was done to make it seaworthy for the towing to California, but it still arrived with of water in the engine room. From 1959 to 1963, the Oakland Dock and Warehouse Company restored the ship and renamed it back to Wapama. The San Francisco Maritime State Historical Park opened to the public on October 2, 1963, and the ship opened to the public as a museum ship on October 10, 1963. Within years of its opening, serious deterioration threatened the ship and became critical in August 1969 when a leak raised the rate at which it took on water to 600 gallons per hour and in strong winds to 1,000 gallons per hour. The ship's two pumps were capable of handling this flow, but two weeks later the leak doubled to 2,000 gallons per hour. In a dive, the leak was found and stanched with oakum and burlap and it was later reinforced to be fixed at the next dry docking, in November 1970. In October 1972, the United States Congress established the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the San Francisco Maritime State Historical Park was intentionally included in its range. In September 1977, the State of California donated the park and the collections to the federal government and it was reorganized as the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. In 1979, the Wapamas condition had deteriorated to the point that significant repairs were needed to restore the ship's structural integrity and it was placed atop a barge. The Wapamas continued dry rot and deterioration worsened until a new survey was done in 1982. Maynard Bray, the shipyard supervisor from Mystic Seaport in Connecticut, inspected the ship and recommended covering it as quickly as possible and building a \\"reasonably good-looking, fairly permanent shed with its sidewalls and ends supported directly from the deck of the barge.\\" Bray concluded that a six-to-ten year restoration was needed to do a \\"decent restoration\\". On June 1, 1984, a report was made for a $3.62 million dollar restoration spanning four years, from 1986-1989. On June 7, it was reported that an allocation for $1,013,100 for fiscal year 1985 for the restoration and a celebration marking its National Historic Landmark status followed the next day. The restoration however was delayed due to concerns with costs and staffing, but a recommendation to build a protective cover was implemented. Constructed in December 1985 at a cost of $98,000, \\"the park opted for a partial roof resting on the vessel‚Äôs bulwarks that covered just the forecastle and main deck\\". Update The National Park Service announced its intention to dismantle Wapama in a 19 May 2011, San Francisco Chronicle article, but it also had considered saving the steam engine. While a majority of bloggers responding to the article voiced dismay and/or support for preservation, a minority advocated burning the Wapama in a manner done to the last commercial Great Lakes sailing ship J T Wing at Belle Isle near the site of the present day Dossin Great Lakes Museum in Detroit. Wapamas impending doom followed the fate of the lumber schooner Wawona (1897) of the Northwest Seaport, Seattle, Washington, which was broken up in 2009. Not all listed historic wooden ships considered in need of major restoration in recent years have ended up being broken up. The lumber schooner C.A. Thayer (1895), also a NPS charge, was restored, although 80% of her wood was replaced through a restoration that lasted from 2004 to 2007. Mystic Seaport began a major restoration of the whaler Charles W. Morgan (1841) in 2009 to seaworthy status.  Importance  Wapama was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 24 April 1973 and later designated a National Historic Landmark on 20 April 1984. It was historically significant as the last wooden-hulled survivor of approximately 235 steam schooners that operated in the Pacific Coast lumber trade. The Wapama had the ability to off-load its own cargo which was \\"an asset in the lumber trade, where ports were primitive and lacked shore facilities for cargo loading.\\" Due to poor condition, the Wapama was slated for dismantling and the Historic American Engineering Record documented the ship through its dismantling to record the details of its construction. Pieces of the Wapama, including its engine, will be preserved and used to make a permanent interpretative exhibit at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. In August 2013, the dismantling of the Wapama was completed. The ship's National Historic Landmark designation was withdrawn in 2015. Five American wood steamboats survive, although three are much smaller than Wapama had been. They are the Virginia V (1922) of Seattle; the Sabino (1908), a former Maine boat now operated by Mystic Seaport; Minnehaha (1906), of Lake Minnetonka, Wisconsin; Nenana (1933), an Alaskan stern-wheeler; and the railroad ferry Eureka (1890) a museum ship in San Francisco. The first three are screw steamers. The Steamer Virginia V Foundation undertook a $6.5-million stem-to-stern restoration of their charge, which lasted from 1995 to 2001.

He was originally from Laiagam District in the Enga Province of Papua New Guinea. Attack Cappo was driving through PNG's capital city, Port Moresby, in the early morning of October 20, 2007 at approximately 2:30 A.M. Cappo reportedly lost control of the vehicle he was driving and crashed his car into an illegal refugee camp outside of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the Ela Beach section of the city near the downtown. Cappo's car destroyed several tents and narrowly missed many women and children, but no one from the camp was apparently hurt in the accident. The camp was filled with West Papuan refugees from the western Indonesian half of New Guinea. Cappo was attacked and stoned to death by several refugees as well as other bystanders when he got out of his car after the accident. His passengers were able to escape. The refugees in the illegal settlement were all from Indonesian West Papua. The West Papuans had set up the camp outside the Port Moresby office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to protest the commission's refusal to relocate them to a third country. The camp had been set up four weeks prior to the accident and the attack on Cappo. The UNHCR had previously refused to relocate the West Papuan refugees to a country outside of Indonesia or Papua New Guinea because it does not consider their lives in danger back in Indonesia. Five people were charged with the attack and murder of Ivo Cappo. The alleged attackers included four West Papuan immigrants: Arnold Kafair, 19, from Raur village; David Koivi, 19, from Pemoi village; Christopher Waromi, 23, from Ambai village; and John Dimara, 23, from Urfu village. (All of their home villages are in Indonesia West Papua.) The fifth man charged in Cappo's death was a Papua New Guinean police officer, Micky Lausi, 35, from Uritai village in the Gulf Province, PNG. So called payback attacks are still widespread throughout Papua New Guinea and the rest of New Guinea. Although it is common, the family of late Cappo maintained that their dad was a law man and to uphold his good name in the judiciary stopped relatives and other supporters taking revenge even though it was so easy to do so. Ivo Cappo, who was 55 when he was killed, was survived by his wife and nine children.

A Soulcatcher or soul catcher (Haboolm Ksinaalgat, 'keeper of breath') is an amulet (Aatxasxw) used by the shaman (Halayt) of the Pacific Northwest Coast of British Columbia and Alaska. It is believed by Tsimshian that all soulcatchers were constructed by the Tsimshian tribe, and traded to the other tribes. Construction Soulcatchers were constructed of a tube of bear femur, incised on one or both sides, and often ornamented with abalone shell. Bears had powerful shamanic connotations among the people of the Northwest Coast. Soulcatchers were decorated with a sisiutl-like animal: a land-otter or bear head at both ends of the tube, and an anthropomorphic face in the middle. This form may have represented the ability to shift shapes, or the mythological land-otter canoe, implying the ability to travel between the three realms: air/god realm (kijek), earth/human/animal realm (takijek), and water/spirit realm (tekijek). The land-otter was the source of all shamanic power. A shaman's helper spirit may have resided in the central head. The soulcatcher was plugged at both ends with shredded cedar bark, to contain the lost soul, or to hold a malevolent spirit \\"sucked out\\" of a patient. The amulet was usually worn as a necklace. Soulcatchers ranged in length from 16 cm to 21.6 cm (6\\" to 8\\"). There are a few examples of wood soulcatchers, and a Haida example covered with copper sheeting. Use Sickness incurable by secular (herbal) means was believed to be caused by \\"soul loss\\" through: *Dreaming, which was thought to be the soul leaving the body and traveling to the spirit world. If the soul was unable to return to the body by morning (due to disorientation or supernatural interference), chronic illness would follow. *Being frightened out of the body *Being enticed out by witchcraft To cure the patient, the shaman would wear the soulcatcher as a necklace. He would then travel to the spirit world by calling helper spirits using trance music, employing helper-spirit masks, and magical implements such as staffs. Shaman might also work in groups, constructing a representation of a shaman's Land- Otter canoe and \\"dantsikw\\" spirit boards (see sisiutl) as a vehicle to travel to the spirit world. Once the errant soul was located, the shaman would \\"suck\\" the soul into the soulcatcher, and return to the patient. The soul would then be \\"blown\\" back into the patient. Another use of the soulcatcher was to suck malevolent spirits out of a patient. References *Bancroft Hunt, Norman. \\"Shamanism in North America.\\" 2002. Firefly Books.

The area has a long winemaking tradition and was the birthplace of the sparkling wine Cava, invented in the early 1870s in Sant Sadurn√≠ d'Anoia by Josep Raventos of Codorn√≠u Winery. At the turn of the 20th century, the Catalan wine industry was at the forefront of Spain's emergence as a world leader in quality wine production, being the first Spanish wine region to adopt the use of stainless steel fermentation tanks. The area is also an important cork production region, with output aimed primarily at the region's Cava houses. Today Catalonia is the second largest producer of wine in Spain, producing over 5.5 million hectolitres. History Wine cellars of Catalan winery Torres. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Phoenicians introduced winemaking to the region several hundred years before the Romans arrived there. Recovered pieces of amphora indicate that the Phoenicians traded ancient Catalan wines with the Egyptians. The Romans had a major influence in the development of Catalan wine-growing, particularly around Tarragona, the Roman capital of occupied Spain. With the fall of the Roman Empire in the 4th century and subsequent Moorish rule, Catalan wine production was severely curtailed. It was several hundred years before wine production began again in earnest. In the 14th century, the Franciscan writer Francesc Eiximenis described Catalan wines as strong, dense, highly alcoholic wines which, although high quality, sometimes needed to be diluted with water. A turning point for the Catalan wine industry occurred in the 19th century with the outbreak of the phylloxera epidemic that ravaged the French vineyards to the north. Along with wines from the Rioja region, Catalan wines became a welcome import for French consumers suffering a severe shortage of domestic produce. In 1872, the sparkling wine Cava was invented in the Pened√®s region and eventually became an internationally recognized wine style. When phylloxera hit the region towards the end of the 19th century, Catalonia's vineyards comprised over 80% red wine grapes. The growing Cava industry encouraged planting of more white wine grapes, in place of the diseased red rootstock, where they now make up nearly 70% of the region's vineyards. During the 20th century, the Catalan wine industry became one of the leaders of the innovation behind the Spanish wine revolution, embracing modern winemaking techniques and increasing the plantings of international grape varieties. The region received international attention in 1979 when a bottle of Torres 1970 Gran Coronas Black Label (a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo and Monastrell) was secretly entered into the \\"classified Bordeaux wine\\" category of the Gault Millau Wine Olympics and ended up winning that category. Climate and geography The Catalan wine region is located along the Mediterranean coast in northeastern Spain and is strongly influenced by its Mediterranean climate. Along the coast temperatures are warm with moderate rainfall but conditions become progressively more arid further inland. The majority of Catalan denominaciones lie to the south of the distinctive peaks of the Montserrat Massif, while smaller plantations lie to the north of Barcelona and south of the French border at the Pyrenees. The region is marked by warm climates along the coast and cooler temperatures through the foothills up to plateaus of more than above sea level. The area has a diversity of soil types, mostly calcareous sediments mixed with alluvium and clay. Some of the most acclaimed vineyards in the region are found on some of the scattered limestone deposits in the area. Grapes and wine Xarel¬∑lo grapes The wines of the Catalan wine region include sparkling Cava, dry white wines and powerful reds, known as \\"black\\" wine or vi negre in Catalan, due to the colour of the grape. The grapes of the region include the Cava and white wine grapes of Macabeo, Parellada and Xarel¬∑lo and the red wine grapes of Garnacha, Monastrell and Tempranillo called Ull de Llebre in Catalan. The production of sparkling white wine is the largest contributor to the Catalan wine industry, followed by production of still red wines and then still whites. While the majority of the region's wines are the Cava blends, many varietal wines are also produced. =Cava= Cava aging. A Spanish sparkling wine was first made as early as 1851, although the roots of the Cava wine industry can be traced back to Josep Raventos' travels through Europe in the 1860s, where he was promoting the still wines of his Codorn√≠u winery. His visits to the Champagne region sparked an interest in the potential of a Spanish version, using the same sparkling wine production methods. The local Macabeu, Parellada and Xarel¬∑lo have since become established as the most popular grapes for producing cava. Early versions were called Catalan champ√°n or xampany after Champagne but this practice ended when the EU awarded Champagne Protected Geographical Status. Catalan main sparkling wine producers agreed and adopted the name Cava after the Catalan word for cellar, where the wines were traditionally stored. According to Spanish wine laws, Cava can be produced in six wine regions (such as Aranda de Duero, Navarra and Rioja) but 95% of Spanish Cava production takes place in the Pened√®s region. In order for the wines to be called 'Cava', they must be made in the traditional m√©thode champenoise. Wines made via the low-cost Charmat process may only be called 'Spanish sparkling wine'. A ros√© style of Cava is also produced in small quantities by adding still red wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, Garnacha or Monastrell to the wine. The first Cava to use the Chardonnay grape was produced in 1981. Catalan Cava producers pioneered a significant technological development in sparkling wine production with the invention of the gyropallet, a large mechanized device that replaced hand riddling, in which the lees are consolidated in the neck of the bottle prior to disgorgement and corking. Wine regions Catalonia's wine regions The Catalan wine region includes 10 DOPs (Denominaci√≥n de Origen Protegida in Spanish, Denominaci√≥ d'Origen Protegida in Catalan) of which one, the Priorat, is a Denominaci√≥ d'Origen Qualificada (DOQ) region. The Catalunya DOP is an umbrella appellation that covers the entire region for wines that do not fall under any other DOP designation. =Alella= The Alella DOP is located near the city of Barcelona and was awarded DOP status in 1956. The area is known mainly for its white wine production which can range from oak aged sweet wine to cool fermented dry wines. The principal grape of the area is the Pansa blanca, a local name for the Xarel¬∑lo grape. There are some plantings of the international varieties Chardonnay and Chenin blanc, used in both still wine and Cava production. =Conca de Barber√†= The Conca de Barber√† DOP is located between the Costers del Segre, Pened√®s and Tarragona DOPs with vineyards at elevations of around above sea level. The climate of the region is marked by hot summer days, cool nights chilled by the nearby ocean breeze, and cold winters. The limestone based soils are planted with Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Pinot noir, which are used to make still wines as well as contribute to some Cava production. Ros√© wines are produced from the local Trepat grape. Cabernet Sauvignon =Costers del Segre= The Costers del Segre DOP is located near the city of Lleida along the Segre River. The landscape here is very arid with less than of rainfall a year. There are extreme temperature variations throughout the year, with freezing cold winters and summertime highs in excess of . The river Ebre provides the irrigation vital to the viticulture of the area, which includes Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Macabeo, Merlot, Parellada, Pinot noir and Tempranillo plantations. =Empord√†= The Empord√† DOP is located in the far north-east of Catalonia, among the foothills of the Pyrenees which border the French province of Roussillon. The area has a similar Mediterranean climate to other Catalan wine regions, but is more heavily influenced by the strong northern winds of the Tramuntana that moderate the risk of frost and vine diseases. The wind alone was not enough to prevent the outbreak of the phylloxera epidemic in the mid 19th century, which nearly destroyed the entire Empord√† wine industry despite many individuals watching and analyzing the progress of the disease as it made its way south from France. Many vineyards were only replanted as recently as the latter half of the 20th century and even early 21st. The principal grapes of the region are Grenache and Carignan. These two core grapes along with general varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah are used for red wines and the large quantity of ros√© wines. The Grenache is also used to make a very notable dessert wine. White production has increased a great deal in recent years as well. =Montsant= The Montsant DOP was formed in 2001 in the area around Falset, Tarragona to distinguish itself from the wines of the greater Tarragona DO. This upland area is noted for its old Garnacha and Cari√±ena vines along steeply sloping vineyards. =Pla de Bages= The Pla de Bages DOP is located northwest of Barcelona, growing many of the same varieties as the nearby Pened√®s region but with more emphasis on international varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Map of Catalonia =Tarragona= The Tarragona DOP is the Catalan wine region around the coastal city of Tarragona and has been a vital winemaking center of Catalan wines since the Roman times. For most of its history the region was known for its sweet fortified red wines made in a style similar to Port. In the 1960s, prior to winning DOP status in 1976, the area began to shift its focus to dry white wines and the production of red sacramental wine used by the Christian Church for Communion. =Terra Alta= The Terra Alta DOP is Catalunya's southernmost wine region and one of the most mountainous ‚Äì terra alta literally translates as \\"highlands\\". It is located to the south of the Priorat DO and shares a similar winemaking history. Today the area is known for its Garnacha blanca wines and its growing red wine production. =Pened√®s= Cava wines growing in the Pened√®s region. The Pened√®s DOP is the largest and most productive wine region of Catalonia and is considered the birthplace of Cava. The region has a long winemaking history and its proximity to Barcelona has had a strong export market. In the 19th century it was one of the first Spanish wine regions to implement a large-scale commercial wine production particularly for export to post- phylloxera France. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Pened√®s region led in the Spanish wine industry's technological revolution; it was the first wine region to adopt the use of temperature-controlled stainless steel fermentation tanks. The region also began to increase its varieties and improve its vine stock with clonal vine selections of grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Gew√ºrztraminer, Merlot, Pinot noir, Riesling and Sauvignon blanc. The region is divided into three zones ‚Äì the lowland Baix Pened√®s, the Pened√®s central which lies between coastal and inland mountain ranges, and the upland Alt Pened√®s. The warmer Baix Pened√®s, centered on the town of El Vendrell and extending to the Costa Daurada coastline, has long been known for its fortified wines made from Malvasia and Moscatell d'Alexandria (Muscat of Alexandria), but has a growing reputation for non-fortified reds made from Carinyena, Garnatxa and Monastrell. The Central Pened√®s is located in a broad valley about above sea level and centered on the regional capital of Vilafranca del Pened√®s, the largest winery there being Bodegas Torres. The nearby town of Sant Sadurn√≠ d'Anoia provides another focal point for the area, being the acknowledged center of Spanish Cava production. Traditionally made from the area's Macabeo, Parellada and Xarel¬∑lo grapes, the increased use of Chardonnay and Pinot noir in Cava blends has seen a corresponding expansion in areas of the region dedicated to those grapes. The Central Pened√®s has also been increasing its red wine production based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Tempranillo called Ull de Llebre in Catalan. The Pened√®s Superior is located in the foothills of the mountains enclosing the Central Depression and is the coolest part of the region, used almost exclusively for white wine production. =Priorat= Terraced hillside of Priorat The Priorat DOQ has been producing wine since the 12th century when Carthusian monks planted a vineyard and established a priory from which the region took its name. The area is known for its Carinyena and Garnatxa based wines made from old, low yield vines that average 0.3 tons an acre (5 hl/ha). The area has a very hot Mediterranean climate that allows the grape to ripen fully and produce wines with very high alcohol levels of up to 18% and wines must have at least 13% to qualify for certification in the region. The local Llicorella soil is of particularly poor quality, composed of quartz and slate, which also helps to limit yields. Vineyards are situated on steep terraces, largely unsuitable for mechanical harvesting. Priorat still has marked monastic influences, with many top estates prefixing their vineyards with Clos in recognition of the region's early winemaking history, similar to the naming of many of Burgundy's grand crus. Despite the annual rainfall of the area being less than , irrigation is not widely used due to the cool, damp nature of the Llicorella soil. Grapevine roots are able to tunnel through faults in the slate to find underground water reserves up to 30m. The region is one of only two Spanish Denominaciones de Origen Calificadas (DOC, or DOQ in Catalan), in recognition of outstanding consistency of quality, the other being the well-known Rioja.

The film tells the story of a crumbling family in rural France, disrupted by the appearance of a fugitive. Plot Thomas, a troubled thirteen-year-old boy, picking flowers in a cemetery, is surprised by Martin, an escaped convict who demands that the boy bring him some money for train fare later that day. The boy does not know where to get money; the criminal tells him to ask his parents. \\"My parents are dead,\\" the boy says. In fact, his parents, Maurice and Lili, are alive. They are separated but they both live near the boy's grandparents' house. Thomas, disaffected by his parents divorce, goes to a boarding catholic school but is spending the weekend with his family and he is going to have first communion. His grandmother is arranging to celebrate that special day and hopes her daughter and son in law would reconcile. The boy tries to get the money for the convict stealing from Lili, his mother, but then sees her sad and, in a moment of love, gives it back to her, admitting what he's done. He goes through a series of increasingly desperate attempts to get money and eventually scrounges some out of his grumpy grandfather, who just wants to go fishing. When the boy returns to give Martin the money, the convict's accomplice, Luc, decides that the boy is too much of a liability and tries to kill him. Martin saves Thomas's life killing his accomplice. Lili Ravenel, who is emotionally close and distant to her son, is worried about Thomas. He is not doing well at school, according to the school's chaplain who comes to complain about the boy's behavior. Lili, trapped in a humdrum existence, runs a nightclub that is situated on a river just at the water's edge. Pushed by her mother, she had married Maurice against her better judgment and now needs to escape the stifling effects of her union with him, but he continues to want her. Maurice threatens to remove the care and custody of her son from her. Lili has to perform her marital duties even after the divorce - while Maurice screens old home-movies of their domestic happiness long past and gone. After killing Luc, Martin arrives to have a drink at a bar by a river. That is where Lili works. He has no money and at the end of the night, fascinated by the young man, she arranges for the fugitive to take a room at a local hotel. When she arrives home, her son tells her the story in the cemetery, as it was a dream he had, but she realizes that it actually happened and the convict is the man she just left in the hotel. The celebration in honor of the Holy Communion goes on with little family harmony after Thomas wishes that an atomic bomb would destroy his school. The grandmother tries to keep the family together. Alice, the convicts' shared girlfriend comes, gun in hand, to help them escape to Tangier. They have been inseparable for years. Martin tells her that he was forced to kill Luc. Lili's suspicions are confirmed when she witnesses the efforts of Martin and Alice to hide the corpse in a graveyard. Martin lets her go and leaves the town with Alice. He changed his mind shortly after and returns to the village alone and goes to the bar in search of Lili. They are smitten by each other and by night, she takes the bold decision to run away with him without a hint of regret or lingering doubt. Before escaping with the convict, Lili tells her mother what she plans to do, but does not change her mind in spite of her mother's protests. The boy's teacher and confessor confronts him with the published news of the two escapees and pressures him to tell the truth to the authorities. That same stormy night, Thomas escapes from the boarding school to see his mother, but when he arrives to her house, he discovers Lili and Martin making love. Thomas runs and when Martin goes after him, Alice who has also come, shoots Martin. Shortly after, Alice kills herself smashing her sport car against a wall. The next morning Lili goes to see Thomas who is staying with his father, but Maurice only allows her to see him without revealing that she is there. Later, at the police station, Lili tells the truth and incriminates herself. She leaves the village detained in a police van. At the same time, Thomas is seen riding his bike.

It is a family drama with psychological undertones. Director Andr√© T√©chin√© is especially drawn to the exploration of family affairs as can be seen in his acclaimed film: My Favorite Season (1993), also starring Catherine Deneuve. The film shares with most of T√©chin√©'s work a restless camera movement and seemingly casual editing that suggest a nervous, intense curiosity, equivalent to an artist's rapid sketching. The French countryside serves here as an ironic backdrop for two kinds of characters: those living repressed lives in a stifling bourgeois environment and those, more uninhibited, who play out a series of violent passions, with the boy caught in the middle. T√©chin√©'s tight, emotionally suppressed, direction worked within the codes of melodrama. The film's two concerns are repression and freedom. Awards The film was nominated for Palme d'Or at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival. In 1987 the film received a C√©sar Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress (Danielle Darrieux).

These ants, which include the majority of species within the genus Solenopsis, get their names from their habit of nesting close to other ant nests, from which they steal food. They are also called grease ants because they are attracted to grease. Nuptial flight in this species occur from late July through early fall. Appearance S. molesta range anywhere from 1/32 of an inch (0.5 mm) to 1/8 of an inch (3 mm) long. Queens in this species measure at just over 5mm in length and range from a yellow to a light brown color. Workers are yellow and occasionally pale brown in appearance. They have very small eyes and are covered in erect and sub-erect yellow hairs. These ants have a two-segmented petiole (a petiole and postpetiole) connecting their abdomen to the thorax. They have 10 segments in their antennae, which end in large segmented clubs. Thief ants possess small stingers on their oblong abdomens. Worker ants have large jaws for carrying food, usually other ants' brood, back to the colony. The larvae of thief ants have been described from the Brazilian species Solenopsis helena. Despite a general resemblance to the larvae of the larger fire ants, the larvae of thief ants are much smaller and present spiculate hairs on their face. Magnified shot of Solenopsis molesta - Cincinnati, Ohio Distribution S. molesta are native to the United States and can be found in Eastern, Western, and Central parts of the country and northern Mexico. Habitat The habitat of Solenopsis molesta is vast, because they can survive just about anywhere. They can live in people's homes, in the cracks or under the floorboards. They can build nests anywhere, but usually near the nests of other species they steal from. They usually nest under rocks, in any exposed soil, or rotting logs. If they cannot find any of these things, then they move into another colony. Their nests are generally large for the ants‚Äô size, and have tunnels that lead to another ant colony for a reliable and steady food source. Behavior Colonies of S. molesta usually have anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand workers. Colonies are occasionally polygynous, with a maximum of eight queens in a single nest. The number of thief ants in a colony depends on the location. Colonies with a reliable and ready food source don't have as many workers because food is readily available. Since ants of this species are so small, they can colonize just about anywhere. They can live in people's homes without them ever knowing that they have an infestation of tiny ants. Solenopsis molesta are common in homes, and due to their small size they can easily enter sealed packages of food. Other thief ant colonies are inside other ant colonies. They then eat the food and sometimes larva of the host ants. They will eat just about anything, including dead animals and fungal spores, and will travel great distances in search for food. Once food has been found, a trail is formed from the colony to the food so the other thief ant workers can find it. Mating S. molesta queens are bigger than the workers, being four to five millimeters long. Mating takes place from July to late fall. Both the queens and S. molesta drones have wings, and mating takes place while flying. Queens sometimes fly with a worker or two clinging to their bodies, presumably to help out right away when the queen finds a suitable place for a colony. Queens can lay anywhere from 27 and 387 eggs per day, but the average number of eggs laid per day is 105. It takes about 52 days for an egg to become a fully mobile worker. Young Solenopsis molesta spends about 21 days in the larval stage when the weather is suitable. Diet They eat grease whenever they find it, which is why they are sometimes called grease ants. They also eat meat, cheese and other dairy products, and seeds. They also eat larvae and pupae of other ant species such as codling moths. Thief ants do not appear to be attracted to sweets, unlike most other ants. They will however, for example, consume fruits and sugary soft drinks. Pest Solenopsis molesta can be troublesome when they get into human dwellings. It is extremely hard to find these ants, due to their inaccessible and remote nesting areas and their extremely small size. They are also not always present outside their colony, and travel far to find food. Also, they are so small they can get into things that other insects cannot get into. The easiest way to locate a colony is to look for trails of ants. It is also hard to get rid of a S. molesta infestation because they are not attracted to common ant traps. One of the most common ways to get rid of the ants is to put oil or grease in the middle of the ant trap. However, this is a hit-or-miss method, because too little grease will not attract the ants, and too much will limit the effectiveness of the trap. The ants also appear to be resistant to most insecticides. Solenopsis molesta are sometimes mistaken for the pharaoh ant, because there are similarities between the two. They are both around the same size, but there are differences in their markings.

England and Wales (with the exception of the City of London, which was outside the scope of the Act) were divided into 60 circuits, with a total of 491 county courts within these circuits.Polden, page 38 The then Lord Chancellor, Lord Cottenham, wanted everyone to be within seven miles of a court, and the final scheme came close to that aim.Polden, page 211 One county court judge was appointed to each circuit, assisted by one or more registrars with some limited judicial powers, and would travel between the courts in his area as necessary, sitting in each court at least once a month. Few permanent courts were needed initially, given the infrequency of court hearings, and temporary accommodation such as a town hall would often be used where there was no existing courthouse for use.Polden, pages 38‚Äì39 In some places, a building is now shared with the local Crown Court (as at Maidstone Combined Court Centre, for example), Family Court, or magistrates' court. The judicial business of the county courts is now carried out by circuit judges (a term introduced by the Courts Act 1971) and district judges (as the post of registrar was renamed by section 74 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990). Part-time judges (recorders, deputy district judges and some retired judges) also sit in the county court. As at 1 April 2015, there are 640 circuit judges and 441 district judges. The system of 60 circuits was abolished in 1970. Over time, whilst new courts have been opened in various locations, there has been an overall reduction in the number of locations where a county court is held. In June 2010, the Ministry of Justice announced plans to close 54 county courts and 103 magistrates' courts, in order to save ¬£15m in annual running costs and ¬£22m in necessary maintenance. After consultation, it was decided to keep five of these county courts open: Barnsley, Bury, Llangefni, the Mayor's and City of London Court, and Skipton. From 22 April 2014, the Crime and Courts Act 2013 replaced the previous system of county courts for different localities with one County Court that operates throughout England and Wales, sitting in multiple locations simultaneously. In July 2015, further proposals to close nineteen County Court venues were announced. All name changes before 1 August 1983 reflect changes in the locations where the court sat. Before then, a county court with more than one location in its title would sit at each location named. The obligation for one court to sit in multiple locations was removed by the Civil Courts Order 1983. Instead, it was specified that a county court was to be held at each location named in the order and courts were to be named after that one location (save for a few exceptions where the name of a former court town was retained in the court's title, such as the Aldershot and Farnham County Court).The Civil Courts Order 1983 (SI 1983/713) (11 May 1983) On 22 April 2014 the various county courts were merged into one single County Court for England and Wales, and since then the venues have been referred as, for example, \\"the County Court at Exeter\\" instead of \\"Exeter County Court\\" as previously.

He currently serves as the executive director of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources. Gibbs worked as an outdoor guide and as a staffer for U.S. Representative Mark Udall before being elected to the Colorado House of Representatives as a Democrat in 2006. In the legislature, Gibbs was noted for his focus on transportation and environment issues in the state legislature, particularly in response the fire dangers posted by Colorado's mountain pine beetle epidemic -- Gibbs is a volunteer wildland firefighter and has served fighting fires in Colorado and California. Gibbs was appointed to a vacancy in the Colorado State Senate in late 2007, won election to a Senate term of his own in 2008, and represented a multi-county region stretching from the Colorado Front Range near Boulder into Rocky Mountain ski country west of Denver. Gibbs rose quickly to chair the Colorado Senate's Transportation Committee, but announced that he would seek election to a Summit County Commissioner seat in 2010 rather than run for another term in the legislature. Gibbs was elected a Summit County Commissioner in 2010 and served in that office until he resigned in January 2019.Summit County, Colorado. Dan Gibbs . Viewed: 2017-01-28. Biography Gibbs' parents were both public school teachers and later school principals; they divorced when Gibbs was young and he split his childhood between Gunnison, Colorado and East Lansing, Michigan. He was influenced at an early age toward public service after meeting former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Gibbs earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from Western State College, and then attended the University of Colorado at Denver, where he worked towards a graduate degree in political science. Gibbs has worked in the timber industry, as a manager with a whitewater rafting company in Lake Luzerne, New York, and as an outdoor adventure guide in Gunnison, Colorado. As a local businessperson, he was a member of and diplomat for the Summit Chamber of Commerce, and was elected to their board for a three-year term in 2006. An athlete and outdoorsman, Gibbs has competed in marathon and ultramarathon running races (including the Leadville Trail 100) and helped coach the Battle Mountain High School cross-country ski team. He has also volunteered with Habitat for Humanity, Eagle River Clean Up, and the I-70 Clean Up Team, and sat on the boards of Club 20, the High Country Conservation Center, the Vail-Eagle Valley Rotary Club, and Vail Valley Hospital Home Health/Hospice. He has cited being a volunteer youth mentor with the Buddy Mentors program as his most meaningful volunteer experience. Gibbs worked in the Washington, DC office of U.S. Congressman Mark Udall before becoming the director for Udall's Western Slope office in Minturn in 2003. As a Congressional staffer, Gibbs sat on the Congressional Legislative Staff Association Board of Directors. He also helped launch the Summit County Young Democrats in 2004. Legislative career =2006 election= Gibbs first ran for the state legislature in 2006 for a seat being vacated by Gary Lindstrom, who served as his campaign chair. Running for office at the age of 30, Gibbs faced criticism for his relative youth and inexperience, however, spending over $90,000 on his campaign -- more than twice as much as Republican opponent Ken Chlouber, -- Gibbs ultimately defeated Chlouber by a 2:1 margin. His constituency, House District 56, encompassed Eagle, Lake and Summit Counties, including the skiing communities of Vail and Breckenridge. =2007 legislative session= In his first year in the legislature -- the 2007 session of the Colorado General Assembly -- Gibbs sat on the House Agriculture, Livestock and Natural Resources Committee and was Vice-Chair of the House Transportation and Energy Committee. That same year, Gibbs was also appointed to the Colorado Interbasin Water Compact Committee and the board of directors of the Colorado Tourism office. Starting when he was a staffer for Congressman Udall and continuing into his legislative career, Gibbs promoted increased government assistance on forest management issues, particularly in response to the increased fire danger caused by mountain pine beetle infestations. In the legislature, Gibbs sponsored legislation which established the Colorado Community Forest Restoration grant program, setting aside $1 million for projects to reduce fire risks. The bill was signed into law by Gov. Bill Ritter and ultimately yielded $176,000 for forest restoration projects within Gibbs' district. Following the legislative session, in order to better understand issues surrounding forest wildfires, Gibbs trained for and received certification in wildland firefighting, becoming certified Type II Wildland Firefighter with Lake Dillon Fire-Rescue. Gibbs' first deployment as a volunteer firefighter was to assist fighting the Santiago Fire during the October 2007 California wildfire epidemic. After successfully sponsoring a 2007 bill requiring collaboration between the Colorado Oil and Gas Commission and Colorado Division of Wildlife to minimize the impact on wildlife from oil and gas drilling, Gibbs testified before the U.S. House's Natural Resources committee on cooperative efforts between oil and environmental interests. After initial resistance, Gibbs also successfully pushed legislation in 2007 to increase penalties for truck drivers who fail to comply with Colorado's law requiring snow chain on roads in winter, a move designed to improve accessibility and safety on I-70, which bisected Gibbs' house district. In later years, Gibbs and state officials attributed decreases in accidents and tickets issued for violating the chain law to the passage of the bill. Gibbs was named to the interim Transportation Legislation Review Committee at the end of the 2007 regular session. =2007 senate appointment= Following the resignation of Colorado Senate President Joan Fitz-Gerald in November 2007, Gibbs was unanimously elected by a vacancy committee to take her seat in the Colorado State Senate. He resigned from the House of Representatives at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, December 11, 2007, and was sworn into the Colorado State Senate an hour later to represent Senate District 16, which covers Clear Creek Gilpin, Grand, Summit and portions of western Boulder and Jefferson counties. Because of his interim appointment, Gibbs faced an election in November 2008 to retain his new Senate seat. Christine Scanlan was appointed to fill Gibbs' vacant house seat on December 19, 2007. =2008 legislative session= In his first year in the Colorado State Senate, Gibbs sat on the Senate Agriculture, Livestock, Natural Resources and Energy Committee and the Senate Transportation Committee -- the counterparts of both of the House committees he served on -- and was named vice-chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He also co-chaired the General Assembly's Sportsmen's Caucus. During the 2008 session, Gibbs sponsored a total of 26 bills as either the lead sponsor or the Senate sponsor of a House bill. Twenty-two of his bills were passed -- an average of more than one per week during the legislative session -- including: * the Colorado Forest Restoration Act, a reauthorization of Gibbs' 2007 house bill to provide funds for local forest restoration projects through 2012, cosponsored with Rep. Christine Scanlan; * the Workplace Accommodations for Working Mothers Act, which requires employers to provide accommodations for breastfeeding mothers; * the Firefighter Protection Act, which would grant additional legal protections for firefighters; * a bill clarifying rules regarding sales of gaming machines; * a bill to prohibit soft drinks from being sold at public schools, * a bill lowering the blood alcohol limit for boat operators. * a bill allowing water boards to issue bonds for fire- mitigation projects. Several of Gibbs bills failed in committee, including legislation to provide $10 million in tax incentives for the film industry in Colorado. With Rep. Scanlan, Gibbs was a prominent opponent of several proposals to charge tolls along the I-70 mountain corridor within his district; he later cited this as his most significant accomplishment of the session. In response to Gibbs' efforts to advance understanding of the ongoing bark beetle epidemic, Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter signed an executive order in February 2008 creating the Colorado Forest Health Advisory Council; Gibbs was named to the 24-member panel shortly after its creation. Following the legislative session, Gibbs was also named the chairman of an interim legislative committee to study wildfire issues, but was criticized by Republicans for delaying the start of the committee's work. The following day, Gibbs announced plans for the committee's first meeting. In July 2008, Gibbs was a prominent critic of Denver Water's sudden closure of the Lake Dillon Dam Road for security reasons. Shortly after the road was reopened, Gibbs and Rep. Christine Scanlan announced plans for legislation to prevent future unilateral closures and to encourage cooperation between agencies to share vulnerability assessments and emergency plans =2008 election= In the 2008 general election, Gibbs faced Republican Don Ytterberg, whom he had outraised roughly $80,000 to $50,000 by mid-October. Gibbs cited his track record of passing legislation and his connections and experience at the state capitol as part of his case for re-election, and named wildfire and business concerns as his major priorities for a continued term in the Colorado Senate. He also called for reducing business personal property taxes and growing local small businesses. Gibbs' re-election bid was endorsed by the Denver Post, the Summit Daily News, and the Boulder Daily Camera, the Arvada Press, and the Golden Transcript. Gibbs raised over $100,000 during his campaign to Ytterberg's $60,000, and ultimately won re-election with about 59 percent of the vote, taking three-quarters of votes cast in Summit County, but losing narrowly to Ytterberg in suburban Jefferson County. =2009 legislative session= In the 2009 session of the Colorado General Assembly, Gibbs rose to chair the Senate Transportation Committee and sat on the Senate Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee. Gibbs missed some of the opening ceremonies of the 2009 General Assembly after being called to help fight a wildfire near Boulder, Colorado; his absence was cited by Gov. Ritter during the governor's \\"State of the State\\" address. With Rep. Christine Scanlan, Gibbs travelled to Washington DC in February and in June to lobby for resources to deal with Colorado's mountain pine beetle epidemic. Gibbs was the Senate sponsor of a major transportation proposal, introduced by Rep. Joe Rice and backed by Gov. Bill Ritter and other Democratic leaders, to increase transportation funding by $250 million per year, primarily for road and bridge repair, by increasing a range of vehicle registration fees. The proposal, labeled \\"FASTER,\\" an acronym for Funding Advancement for Surface Transportation and Economic Recovery, stalled in the state senate, but advanced after a compromise was reached to drop a pilot program to charge drivers based on vehicle miles travelled and to allow locally authorized toll roads. and eventually passed out of the legislature, FASTER was passed without the support of Republicans, who objected to the level of fee increases and called for resources besides fees to be used to support transportation. The increased registration fees drew significant protest from the public when they took effect in July 2009. Other legislation sponsored by Gibbs included bills to extend Colorado's habitat stamp program, to create a specialty license plate for skiing and snowboarding, to overhaul regulations on oil and gas drilling operations, and to facilitate local planning and fundraising for fighting wildfires. Gibbs was also viewed as one of the crucial swing votes on a measure to repeal the death penalty in Colorado and use the resulting savings to fund a statewide cold case unit. Although he first voted to remove the death penalty repeal from the legislation, he later voted in support of a version of the bill containing the repeal, which came within one vote of passing the legislature on the final day of the session. In January 2009, Gibbs was named one of the Western Colorado Conservation Corps' Legislators of the Year, and in May 2009, he was the keynote speaker at Summit High School's graduation. =2010 election= In November 2009, Gibbs announced that, rather than running for re-election to the state senate in fall of 2010, he would run for the Summit County Commissioner seat being vacated by Bob French. Gibbs's retirement opened up a seat that Republicans viewed as a pickup opportunity. In 2014, Gibbs discussed his preference for local politics: ‚ÄúAt the state level, it‚Äôs much more about whether you are a Republican or a Democrat and winning and losing, rather than making decisions that are good for Colorado. The more dysfunctional things get at the federal and state levels, the more people seem to come together at the local level to accomplish goals that are important to communities.‚Äù In November 2014, he easily defeated Republican Allen Bacher, winning re-election by over 66 percent of the vote. Department of Natural Resources On January 9, 2019, Governor Jared Polis nominated Gibbs to serve as the executive director of Colorado's Department of Natural Resources. Following his service in the Colorado General Assembly, Gibbs served on the Board of County Commissioners of Summit County, Colorado. Gibbs was first elected as county commissioner in 2010 and was sworn in in 2011. He resigned as county commissioner in January 2019 and was confirmed by the state senate and sworn in as Department of Natural Resources executive director on February 5, 2019. During his tenure, Gibbs, a certified wildland firefighter, worked in his firefighter role on the 2020 Grizzly Creek Fire.

It is based on cost‚Äìbenefit analysis. However, it is more comprehensive in that it looks at not only the total costs and total benefits for an individual project, but it also examines the total costs and benefits for all alternatives or combinations thereof and treats them on an \\"equal footing.\\" These alternatives include not only construction projects but also demand reduction measures, such as road pricing, developing more walkable neighbourhoods and promoting telecommuting. Equal footing means that there is no discrimination against some alternatives based on political or ideological factors. LCPM itself is generally more costly than cost‚Äìbenefit analysis, because of the requirement to study objectively all potential alternatives. However, it can provide large savings to taxpayers because it will do a better job of selecting those projects which maximise benefits while minimising costs. There has been a trend in the US towards making LCPM mandatory for regional transport plans. For example, it has been required by Washington State law (RCW 47.80.030) for regional transport plans since July 1, 1994.

History Grain was built on a site for the nationalised Central Electricity Generating Board. The architects were Farmer & Dark with Donald Rudd and Partners. It was built by several contractors including John Laing Construction (Civils), the Cleveland Bridge Company (Steel Frame & Cladding), N. G. Bailey (Electrical), Babcock & Wilcox (Boilers) and GEC Turbine Generators Ltd (steam turbines) beginning before 1975. It opened in 1979. The principal buildings were the main boiler house - turbine house block, an attached central control wing, a detached range of offices, the chimney and a gas turbine power station. The buildings are steel framed and reinforced concrete construction. The main boiler house - turbine house block was nearly half a kilometre long. The larger buildings had curved eaves and slightly pitched roofs, an attempt to reduce the visual impact of the site. Grain power station was located on the Isle of Grain, where the River Medway flows into the Thames Estuary. The station had the second tallest chimney in the UK, at , visible from a wide area of North Kent and parts of South Essex. The chimney was built by specialist contractors Bierrum and Partners Ltd; Drax Power Station has the tallest chimney, at 259 metres or 850 feet. This chimney was demolished at 11am on 7 September 2016. Grain adjoins the site of the BP Kent oil refinery, which closed in 1982. The station burned oil to drive, via steam turbines, two (gross power output ‚Äì but was used on-site, leaving for export to the Grid) alternators. There were four boilers rated at 592 kg/s, steam conditions were 538¬∞C, with 538¬∞C reheat. The station was capable of generating enough electricity to supply approximately 2% of Britain's peak electricity needs. The station was originally designed to have a total capacity of from five sets of boiler/turbine combinations. The two remaining oil-fired generating units were mothballed by Powergen in 2002 and 2003, but almost immediately the company began to consider reopening the plant as electricity prices increased rapidly. It was operated by E.ON UK who also operated the nearby Kingsnorth coal-fired station, now also decommissioned. The plant did not meet the emissions requirements of the Large Combustion Plant Directive and was required to close by 2015. However, due to the rising costs of maintaining the plant, E.ON UK, the owners of Grain Oil power station, announced that Grain was to be mothballed and the site closed by 31 December 2012. Grain Oil power station generated no further electricity but was maintained as standby capacity for the grid. In April 2014 the dismantling process at the site began, being carried out by Brown and Mason Ltd; it was expected to take around 2 years to complete. On 10 May 2015, three buildings on the site were destroyed. Three of the five boiler houses were demolished by explosives on Sunday 2 August 2015. The 244m-high chimney was demolished on 7 September 2016. Until 2014, BBC Radio Kent maintained an Outside Broadcast reception antenna on top of the chimney. The chimney is now officially the largest structure to ever be demolished in the United Kingdom beating the New Brighton Tower which won the title almost one hundred years ago. =Electricity output= Electricity output for Grain power station over the period 1979-1987 was as follows.CEGB Statistical Yearbooks (1979-1987).

Once control of a phone has been established, it is used to call back the hacker who is then able to listen in to conversations. The Bluebug program also has the capability to create a call forwarding application whereby the hacker receives calls intended for the target phone.

Background  By the 1970s Wolfe was, according to Douglas Davis of Newsweek magazine \\"more of a celebrity than the celebrities he describes.\\" In . The success of Wolfe's previous books, in particular The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test in 1968 and Radical Chic & Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers in 1970, had given Wolfe carte blanche from his publisher to pursue any topic he desired. In the midst of working on stories about the space program for Rolling Stone‚Äîstories that would eventually grow into the 1979 book The Right Stuff‚ÄîWolfe became interested in writing a book about modern art. As a journalist, Wolfe had devoted much of his writing career to pursuing realism; Wolfe read in Hilton Kramer's 1974 Times review of Seven Realists, that \\"to lack a persuasive theory is to lack something crucial\\". Wolfe summarized the review saying that it meant \\"without a theory to go with it, I can't see a painting\\". Prior to publication in book form, The Painted Word was excerpted in Harper's Magazine. Wolfe's longtime publisher Farrar, Straus & Giroux released it as a book in 1975.  Themes  Wolfe's thesis in The Painted Word was that by the 1970s, modern art had moved away from being a visual experience, and more often was an illustration of art critics' theories. Wolfe criticized avant-garde art, Andy Warhol, Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock. The main target of Wolfe's book, however, was not so much the artists, as the critics. In particular, Wolfe criticized three prominent art critics whom he dubbed the kings of \\"Cultureburg\\": Clement Greenberg, Harold Rosenberg and Leo Steinberg. Wolfe argued that these three men were dominating the world of art with their theories and that, unlike the world of literature in which anyone can buy a book, the art world was controlled by an insular circle of rich collectors, museums and critics with outsized influence. Wolfe provides his own history of what he sees as the devolution of modern art. He summarized that history: \\"In the beginning we got rid of nineteenth-century storybook realism. Then we got rid of representational objects. Then we got rid of the third dimension altogether and got really flat (Abstract Expressionism). Then we got rid of airiness, brushstrokes, most of the paint, and the last viruses of drawing and complicated designs\\". After providing examples of other techniques and the schools that abandoned them, Wolfe concluded with Conceptual Art: \\"‚Ä¶there, at last, it was! No more realism, no more representation objects, no more lines, colors, forms, and contours, no more pigments, no more brushstrokes. ‚Ä¶Art made its final flight, climbed higher and higher in an ever-decreasing tighter- turning spiral until‚Ä¶ it disappeared up its own fundamental aperture‚Ä¶ and came out the other side as Art Theory!‚Ä¶ Art Theory pure and simple, words on a page, literature undefiled by vision‚Ä¶ late twentieth-century Modern Art was about to fulfill its destiny, which was: to become nothing less than Literature pure and simple\\". In .  Critical reception  \\"The Painted Word hit the art world like a really bad, MSG-headache-producing, Chinese lunch,\\" wrote Rosalind E. Krauss in Partisan Review. In . By ridiculing the most respected members of the art world establishment, Wolfe had ensured that the reaction to his book would be negative. Many reviewers dismissed Wolfe as someone simply too ignorant of art to write about it. In . Other critics responded with such similar vitriol and hostility that Wolfe said their response demonstrated that the art community only talked to each other. A review in The New Republic called Wolfe a fascist and compared him to the brainwashed assassin in the film The Manchurian Candidate. Wolfe was particularly amused, however, by a series of criticisms that resorted to \\"X-rated insults.\\" An artist compared him to \\"A six-year-old at a pornographic movie; he can follow the action of the bodies but he can't comprehend the nuances.\\" A critic in Time Magazine used the same image, but with an 11-year- old boy. A review in The New York Times Book Review used the image again, clarifying that the boy was a eunuch. The opening of Krauss's review in Partisan Review compared Wolfe to the star of the pornographic film Deep Throat. The reviewer viewed Wolfe's lack of a suggestion for what should replace modern art as similar in its obtuseness to statements Linda Lovelace made about Deep Throat being a \\"kind of goof.\\" In defense of critics Rosenberg, Greenberg, and Steinberg, Rosalind Krauss noted that each man wrote about art \\"in ways that are entirely diverse.\\" Writing in Newsweek, Douglas Davis wrote that The Painted Word fails because of how it departed from Wolfe's previous works. Wolfe's other non-fiction, Davis wrote, was deeply reported, but here \\"Wolfe did not get away from the typewriter and out into the thick of his subject.\\" Outside the art community, some reviewers noted that however unpopular Wolfe's book may have been in art circles, many of his observations were essentially correct, particularly about the de- objectification of art and the rise of art theory.

Background  In 1975 Wolfe made his first foray into art criticism with The Painted Word, in which he argued that art theory had become too pervasive because the art world was controlled by a small elitist network of wealthy collectors, dealers and critics. Art critics were, in turn, highly critical of Wolfe's book, arguing that he was a philistine who knew nothing of what he wrote. After The Painted Word, Wolfe published a collection of his essays, Mauve Gloves & Madmen, Clutter & Vine (1976), and his history of the earliest years of the space program, The Right Stuff (1979). Undeterred by the hostile critical response to The Painted Word, and perhaps even encouraged by the stir the book made, Wolfe set about writing a critique of modern architecture. From Bauhaus to Our House was excerpted in Harper's Magazine and published by Wolfe's long-time publisher Farrar, Straus & Giroux in 1981.  Themes  Wolfe bluntly lays out his thesis in the introduction to From Bauhaus to Our House with a riff on the patriotic song \\"America the Beautiful\\" > O beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain, has there ever > been another place on earth where so many people of wealth and power have > paid for and put up with so much architecture they detested as within thy > blessed borders today? Wolfe criticizes the tendencies of modern architecture to avoid any external ornamentation. Wolfe praised architects like Louis Sullivan who, from the late 19th century to his death in 1924, built a number of ornate buildings. Wolfe turned his criticism on the International Style and Modern Architecture exemplified by architects such as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius (the founder of the Bauhaus school in Germany, whose ideas influenced Modern Architecture, and from which the title of the book derives). Wolfe believed that the buildings of the International Style and Modern Architecture could barely be appreciated by those who had to work in them. Wolfe's critique, however, was not purely aesthetic. As in The Painted Word Wolfe was critical of what he saw as too much adherence to theory. Wolfe characterized the architecture as based on a political philosophy that was inapplicable to America, arguing, for example, that it was silly to model American schools on \\"worker's flats\\" for the proletariat. The architecture world--like an art world dominated by critics, and a literature world dominated by creative writing programs--was producing buildings that nobody liked. Many architects, in Wolfe's opinion, had no particular goal but to be the most avant-garde. In .  Critical response  As Wolfe's arguments mirrored those he made in The Painted Word so was mirrored the critical response. The response to Wolfe's book from the architecture world was highly negative. Critics argued that, once again, Wolfe was writing on a topic he knew nothing about and had little insight to contribute to the conversation. Time critic Robert Hughes wrote that Wolfe had added nothing to the discussion of modern architecture except \\"a kind of supercilious rancor and a free- floating hostility toward the intelligentsia\\". In . Hilton Kramer writing in the Saturday Review found Wolfe's writing hyperbolic and refuted some of Wolfe's points. Wolfe had claimed, for example, that a Modern Architecture exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art had played a large role in subverting native culture; Kramer rebutted that the museum had displayed the art of Charles Burchfield and Edward Hopper before Picasso and Matisse and that the exhibition occurred in 1932 while the architecture itself remained uncommon for another 20 years. In . Some critics conceded that Wolfe was right that many people did not appreciate the buildings. Blake Morrison, writing in the Times Literary Supplement observed that perhaps some people felt such hostility to architecture because it is \\"a gallery we can't walk out of, a book we can't close, and art we can't even turn our backs on because it is there facing us on the other side of the street\\". In . Others noted that, regardless of whether Wolfe was right or wrong, architecture was already moving away from Modern architecture to Postmodern architecture. Many of the complaints that Wolfe lodged against Modern architecture, particularly the austere boxiness of the buildings, were no longer a facet of postmodern architecture. Critics observed that the book was well written. Paul Goldberger, the architecture critic for The New York Times wrote, \\"Mr. Wolfe's agility continues to dazzle, more than fourteen years after his essays first began to appear in print. But dazzle is not history, or architectural criticism, or even social criticism, and it is certainly not an inquiry into the nature of the relationship between architecture and society.\\" In .

Function  NR2B has been associated with age- and visual-experience-dependent plasticity in the neocortex of rats, where an increased NR2B/NR2A ratio correlates directly with the stronger excitatory LTP in young animals. This is thought to contribute to experience-dependent refinement of developing cortical circuits. Both mice and rats that were engineered to over-express GRIN2B in their brains have increased mental ability. The \\"Doogie\\" mouse had double the learning ability on one measure of learning.

In humans it is one of two cyclooxygenases.  History  Cyclooxygenase (COX) is the central enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway to prostaglandins from arachidonic acid. This protein was isolated more than 40 years ago and cloned in 1988.  Gene and isozymes  There are two isozymes of COX encoded by distinct gene products: a constitutive COX-1 (this enzyme) and an inducible COX-2, which differ in their regulation of expression and tissue distribution. The expression of these two transcripts is differentially regulated by relevant cytokines and growth factors. This gene encodes COX-1, which regulates angiogenesis in endothelial cells. COX-1 is also involved in cell signaling and maintaining tissue homeostasis. A splice variant of COX-1 termed COX-3 was identified in the CNS of dogs, but does not result in a functional protein in humans. Two smaller COX-1-derived proteins (the partial COX-1 proteins PCOX-1A and PCOX-1B) have also been discovered, but their precise roles are yet to be described.  Function  Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (PTGS), also known as cyclooxygenase (COX), is the key enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis. It converts free arachidonic acid, released from membrane phospholipids at the sn-2 ester binding site by the enzymatic activity of phospholipase A2, to prostaglandin (PG) H2. The reaction involves both cyclooxygenase (dioxygenase) and hydroperoxidase (peroxidase) activity. The cyclooxygenase activity incorporates two oxygen molecules into arachidonic acid or alternate polyunsaturated fatty acid substrates, such as linoleic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid. Metabolism of arachidonic acid forms a labile intermediate peroxide, PGG2, which is reduced to the corresponding alcohol, PGH2, by the enzyme‚Äôs hydroperoxidase activity. While metabolizing arachidonic acid primarily to PGG2, COX-1 also converts this fatty acid to small amounts of a racemic mixture of 15-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acids (i.e., 15-HETEs) composed of ~22% 15(R)-HETE and ~78% 15(S)-HETE stereoisomers as well as a small amount of 11(R)-HETE. The two 15-HETE stereoisomers have intrinsic biological activities but, perhaps more importantly, can be further metabolized to a major class of anti-inflammatory agents, the lipoxins. In addition, PGG2 and PGH2 rearrange non-enzymatically to a mixture of 12-Hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acids viz.,1 2-(S)-hydroxy-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid (i.e. 12-HHT) and 12-(S)-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid plus Malonyldialdehyde. and can be metabolized by CYP2S1 to 12-HHT (see 12-Hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid). These alternate metabolites of COX-1 may contribute to its activities. COX-1 promotes the production of the natural mucus lining that protects the inner stomach and contributes to reduced acid secretion and reduced pepsin content. COX-1 is normally present in a variety of areas of the body, including not only the stomach but any site of inflammation.  Clinical significance  COX-1 is inhibited by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin. Thromboxane A2, the major product of COX-1 in platelets, induces platelet aggregation. The inhibition of COX-1 is sufficient to explain why low dose aspirin is effective at reducing cardiac events.

Gen. Alfred N. Duffi√© and Confederate infantry under Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge on July 16, 1864, near present-day Purcellville, Virginia in Loudoun County as part of the Valley Campaigns of 1864. The action was tactically inconclusive. Background Following the Battle of Fort Stevens on July 12 in Washington D.C., Confederate Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early decided to withdraw his army across the Potomac River into Virginia and return to the Shenandoah Valley. The Confederates withdrew along the Georgetown Pike into Montgomery County, Maryland towards Poolesville. On the July 14 they reached Conrad's Ferry (present day White's Ferry) and crossed making camp at Big Springs just north of Leesburg, Virginia. Nearly a full day after Early set out towards Virginia, Union forces under Maj. Gen. Horatio Wright set out in pursuit. Under his command was the entire VI Corps, part of the XIX Corps as well as several divisions of \\"100-days\\" troops recruited to defend Washington. On the afternoon of July 15, Wright arrived in Poolsville and learned of the arrival of the Army of West Virginia at Harpers Ferry. A small force of infantry and cavalry from the Army of West Virginia, under Brig. Gen. George Crook had crossed into Loudoun that morning by way of Berlin (present day Brunswick), briefly skirmished with Confederate cavalry near Waterford and retired to Hillsboro. Seeing that he could pin Early between himself and the force under Crook in the Loudoun Valley, Wright determined to cross the Potomac the following morning and ensnare Early in the Federal pincers. Wright, however, could not easily communicate with Crook as the telegraph wires between his position and Harpers Ferry had been cut by John S. Mosby's Rangers a few days prior during his raid on Point of Rocks. Battle =Confederate withdrawal and Union reconnaissance= The morning of July 16, with the Federals closing in, General Early broke camp at Leesburg and set out for the Shenandoah Valley by way of Snickers Gap which lay some 20 miles across the Loudoun Valley via the Snickers Gap and Leesburg Pike. While his main army and wagon trains used that route to withdrawal, cavalry under Brig. Gen. Bradley T. Johnson was ordered to take a more northerly route and protect the armies right flank and Brig. Gen. John McCausland was to lead cavalry, and a column of POWs and cattle captured Maryland, on a southerly route across Ashby's Gap and protect the armies left flank. The infantry of Generals Robert E. Rodes and Stephen Dodson Ramseur marched behind the wagons and Brig. Gen. John D. Imboden's cavalry served as the rearguard. Later that morning, Wright began his crossing at Conrad's Ferry, with a small force under Maj. Gen. Edward Ord crossing at Edwards Ferry. Wright's forces briefly skirmished with Rodes and Ramseur's Cavalry, who quickly withdrew in the face of superior numbers. Though the crossing was not disputed, Wright spent the rest of the day getting his army across the river and was only at Leesburg by days end, where he briefly skirmished again with Imboden's Cavalry. While Wright was crossing the river, General Duffi√© dispatched several cavalry patrols from Hillsboro to locate the Confederate column. On patrol encountered Confederate Cavalry east of Purcellville and drove them back on the main body and in doing so located Early's wagon train. The patrol broke off and returned to Hillsboro to report the reconnaissance. As the Confederates made their way across the Loudoun Valley, Johnson's cavalry stopped at Waterford to water their horses, assuming the army was in safe territory and not in imminent danger. This delay allowed the main army to advance beyond its right flank screen. Around noon, Duffi√©'s patrols reported back to him, alerting him of the presence of the Confederate wagon train as well as of Johnson's force at Waterford. General Crook immediately dispatched the 15th New York Cavalry under Col. George Wells to Waterford to engage Johnson and the 21st New York with the 1st West Virginia Light Artillery under Col. William B. Tibbits to attack the wagon train. Wells for his part drove off the remaining Confederates at Waterford, though Johnson's main force had already left, and then stayed to receive the accolades of the unionist town's thankful citizens. =Crossroads= Tibbits, meanwhile, arrived a mile north of Heaton's Crossroads on the Berlin pike and caught sight of the Confederate column, which to his delight was without cavalry protection. Tibbits left a small force there as a decoy, telling them to wait for the artillery signal to attack and then took his main force a mile west through a woods, using a small ridge to screen himself from the Confederates. Tibbits deployed his men and artillery on the crest of the ridge and at 2 p.m. began his attack, ordering the artillery to fire and his men to charge. The shock of the attack caused the small infantry guard accompanying the wagon train to flee without a fight. The attacking Federals then caused the Confederate teamsters to stampede the Wagon trains, and Tibbits turned his charge to the east allowing him to round up the wagons fleeing his decoy force attacking along the Berlin Pike. The attack quickly lost coherence as the force fanned out among the fleeing wagons and as troopers left to escort captured wagons back to Hillsboro. The attack, however, did not go unnoticed among the Confederate leadership. Gen. Breckenridge ordered Brig. Gen. Gabriel Wharton to deploy his infantry and artillery on a ridge west of the town along with Brig. Gen. Robert Ranson's cavalry. As the Federal attack came into sight the confederate infantry and artillery opened up and Ranson's cavalry rode around to Wharton's left cutting off the Federal escape route. The presence of strong infantry force caused the Federals to flee, but because Ranson had cut off their main route back to Hillsboro, they abandoned the captured wagons that they had not yet taken back to Hillsboro, attempting to light fire to them before the fled. In their hurry to flee, the Federals left their artillery behind. Meanwhile, Ramseur's infantry approached the Crossroads from Leesburg and encountered Tibbits decoy force, which was quickly dispatched by the cavaliers. Upon returning to Hillsboro, Lt. William Josyln of the 21st New York determined to retrieve the abandoned artillery and received permission from Gen. Duffi√© to do so. Accompanied by 18 troopers, Josyln arrived at Heaton's Crossroads to discover the guns had already been taken away by the Confederates. They also encountered a small detachment of Confederate partisans, either from Mosby's Rangers or John Mobberly's gang, dressed in Federal uniforms, who they took to be friendly soldiers. After gaining the confidence of the troopers the Rangers killed the 18 enlisted men and took Josyln prisoner. =Woodgrove= As the day drew to a close, the last of Early's force except Johnson, who went into camp at Woodgrove southwest of Hillsboro and now acting as a rearguard, crossed the Blue Ridge and Shenandoah River and made camp around Berryville. The two Union commands, now in communication with each other set out to rendezvous at Heaton's Crossroads. As the Crook set out from Hillsboro he ordered Duffi√© to take his cavalry on a westerly route to serve as a screen against a possible Confederate attack. The route Duffi√© selected took the Federals right through Woodgrove. At 9 p.m., in the twilight after sunset, Duffi√©'s cavalry entered Woodgrove, catching Johnson's cavalry completely by surprise, due to poor picket posting. Most of the Confederates fled immediately, many leaving their horses behind, except the 8th Virginia Cavalry, who formed a line, with half of the company dismounted as skirmishers and attacked Duffi√©'s Cavalry, enabling their comrades to make an escape. The fight was fierce but short and by the time Duffi√© brought up his artillery all of the Confederates including the 8th had fled, regrouping at present day Round Hill. Aftermath The Federal cavalry was successful in capturing 37 wagons, burning 43 and capturing 54 prisoners at the expense of several artillery pieces and at least 18 casualties. Because the two Federal armies could not effectively communicate they were unable to hinder Early's withdrawal and missed the best opportunity they had to date to do so. The Confederates, for their part, gained little from the day besides their passage across the Blue Ridge and a few pieces of artillery which was counterbalanced by Johnson being twice embarrassed, once at Waterford and again at Woodgrove.

Boni and Liveright) Cane is a 1923 novel by noted Harlem Renaissance author Jean Toomer. The novel is structured as a series of vignettes revolving around the origins and experiences of African Americans in the United States. The vignettes alternate in structure between narrative prose, poetry, and play-like passages of dialogue. As a result, the novel has been classified as a composite novel or as a short story cycle. Though some characters and situations recur between vignettes, the vignettes are mostly freestanding, tied to the other vignettes thematically and contextually more than through specific plot details. The ambitious, nontraditional structure of the novel ‚Äì and its later influence on future generations of writers ‚Äì have helped Cane gain status as a classic of modernism.As of March 2008, there were over 100 scholarly articles on the book at the MLA Database. Several of the vignettes have been excerpted or anthologized in literary collections; the poetic passage \\"Harvest Song\\" has been included in multiple Norton poetry anthologies. The poem opens with the line: \\"I am a reaper whose muscles set at sundown.\\"  Writing Cane  Jean Toomer began writing sketches that would become the first section of Cane in November 1921 on a train from Georgia to Washington D.C.McKay, Nellie. Jean Toomer, Artist: A Study of His Literary Life and Work. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1984. By Christmas of 1921, the first draft of those sketches and the short story ‚ÄúKabnis‚Äù were complete. Waldo Frank, Toomer‚Äôs close friend, suggested that Toomer combine the sketches into a book. In order to form a book-length manuscript, Toomer added sketches relating to the black urban experience. When Toomer completed the book, he wrote: ‚ÄúMy words had become a book‚Ä¶I had actually finished something.‚ÄùToomer, ‚ÄúWhy I Entered the Gurdjieff Work,‚Äù Toomer Collection, Box 66, Folder 8, p. 29. However, before the book was published, Toomer‚Äôs initial euphoria began to fade. He wrote, ‚ÄúThe book is done but when I look for the beauty I thought I‚Äôd caught, they thin out and elude me.‚ÄùJean Toomer to Waldo Frank, Toomer Collection, Box 1, Folder 3. He thought that the Georgia sketches lacked complexity and said they were ‚Äútoo damn simple for me.‚Äù In a letter to Sherwood Anderson, Toomer wrote that the story-teller style of ‚ÄúFern‚Äù ‚Äúhad too much waste and made too many appeals to the reader.‚ÄùJean Toomer to Sherwood Anderson, Toomer Collection, Box 1, Folder 1. In August 1923, Toomer received a letter from Horace Liveright asking for revisions to the bibliographic statement Toomer had submitted for promotions of the book. Liveright requested that Toomer mention his ‚Äúcolored blood,‚Äù because that was the ‚Äúreal human interest value‚Äù of his story.Horace Liveright to Jean Toomer, August 29, 1923, Toomer Collection, Box I, Folder 6. Toomer had a history of complex beliefs about his own racial identity, and in the spring of 1923 he had written to the Associated Negro Press saying he would be pleased to write for the group‚Äôs black readership on events that concerned them. However, when Toomer read Liveright‚Äôs letter he was outraged. He responded that his ‚Äúracial composition‚Äù was of no concern to anyone except himself, and asserted that he was not a ‚ÄúNegro‚Äù and would not ‚Äúfeature‚Äù himself as such. Toomer was even willing to cancel the publication of the book.Jean Toomer to Horace Liveright, September 5, 1923, Toomer Collection, Box 1, Folder 6.  Structure  Toomer spent a great deal of time working on the structure of Cane. He said that the design was a circle. Aesthetically, Cane builds from simple to complex forms; regionally, it moves from the South to the North and then back to the South; and spiritually, it begins with ‚ÄúBona and Paul,‚Äù grows through the Georgia narratives, and ends in ‚ÄúHarvest Song.‚Äù The first section focuses on southern folk culture; the second section focuses on urban life in Washington D.C.; and the third section is about the racial conflicts experienced by a black Northerner living in the South. In his autobiography, Toomer wrote: ‚ÄúI realized with deep regret, that the spirituals, meeting ridicule, would be certain to die out. With Negroes also the trend was towards the small town and then towards the city‚Äîand industry and commerce and machines. The folk-spirit was walking in to die on the modern desert. That spirit was so beautiful. Its death was so tragic. Just this seemed to sum life for me. And this was the feeling I put into Cane. Cane was a swan-song. It was a song of an end.‚Äù Turner, Darwin, ed. The Wayward and the Seeking: A Collection of Writings by Jean Toomer. Washington: Howard UP, 1980.  Contents  Preamble *\\"Cane\\" (poem) First section: *\\"Karintha\\" - A vignette about a young black woman desired by older men who wish \\"to ripen a growing thing too soon.\\" *\\"Reapers\\" - A poem written in couplets about reapers in a field, their \\"silent swinging,\\" and the stark death of a field rat. *\\"November Cotton Flower\\" - A sonnet written in couplets with images of death in nature in the octave. These images become \\"beauty so sudden\\" in the sestet. *\\"Becky\\" - Vignette of an ostracized white woman with two black sons who lives in a small stone house with the railway. *\\"Face\\" (poem) *\\"Cotton Song\\" (poem) *\\"Carma\\" - Vignette about a strong woman whose husband becomes involved in shady business. *\\"Song of the Son\\" (poem) *\\"Georgia Dusk\\" (poem) *\\"Fern\\" - A Northern man attempts to woo a southern black woman, with strange results. *\\"Nullo\\" (poem) *\\"Evening Song\\" (poem) *\\"Esther\\" - A young woman who works in a drug store ages and pines for the wandering preacher Barlo, eventually seeking him out. *\\"Conversion\\" (poem) *\\"'Portrait of Georgia\\" (poem) *\\"Blood Burning Moon\\" - Black man Tom Burwell and white man Bob Stone each pursue the young Louisa, resulting in a violent encounter and a tragic climax. Second section: *\\"Seventh Street\\" - Brief vignette about a street which is \\"a bastard of Prohibition and the War.\\" *\\"Rhobert\\" - Brief vignette about a solitary man. *\\"Avey\\" - A young college student pursues a lazy girl named Avey, but cannot figure out why. *\\"Beehive\\" (poem) *\\"Storm Ending\\" (poem) *\\"Theater\\" - A dancer named Dorris seeks the approval and adoration of a patron named John. *\\"Her Lips are Copper Wire\\" (poem) *\\"Calling Jesus\\" - A brief vignette. *\\"Box Seat\\" - Dan Moore lusts after a reluctant Muriel, and follows her to a dwarf fight, where he starts a scene. *\\"Prayer\\" (poem) *\\"Harvest Song\\" (poem) *\\"Bona and Paul\\" - A story of indifferent love. * \\"People\\"(poem) -Tries to tackle the issue of racism Third section: *\\"Kabnis\\" - The piece is primarily a dialogue and has elements of a short play. For example, the dialogue does not use tags (\\"he said\\") or describe the thoughts of a speaker. There also seem to be stage directions. In addition, \\"Kabnis\\" has some non-dramatic elements; it does not follow the format of a professional play. The language consists of highly poetic descriptions with the narrator commenting on the characters' feelings. Modernism and Cane =Imagism=  Critical reception  Cane was largely ignored during the Harlem Renaissance by the average white and African American reader. Langston Hughes addressed this in his essay ‚ÄúThe Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain\\" by saying, ‚Äú'O, be respectable, write about nice people, show how good we are,' say the Negroes. 'Be stereotyped, don‚Äôt go too far, don‚Äôt shatter our illusions about you, don‚Äôt amuse us too seriously. We will pay you,' say the whites. Both would have told Jean Toomer not to write Cane. The colored people did not praise it. Although the critics gave it good reviews, the public remained indifferent. Yet (excepting the works of Du Bois) Cane contains the finest prose written by a Negro in America. And like the singing of Robeson it is truly racial.\\"Hughes, Langston, \\"The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain\\", Angelyn Mitchell (ed.), Within the Circle: An Anthology of African American Literary Criticism from the Harlem Renaissance to the Present, Durham: Duke University Press, 1994. 55-59. Hughes suggests that Cane failed to be popular among the masses because it did not reinforce white views of African Americans. It did not fit the model of the ‚ÄúOld Negro‚Äù and did not depict the lifestyle of African Americans living in Harlem that whites wanted to see. Cane was not widely read when it was published but was generally praised by both black and white critics. Montgomery Gregory, an African American, wrote in his 1923 review: \\"America has waited for its own counterpart of Maran‚Äîfor that native son who would avoid the pitfalls of propaganda and moralizing on the one hand and the snares of a false and hollow race pride on the other hand. One whose soul mirrored the soul of his people, yet whose vision was universal. Jean Toomer‚Ä¶is the answer to this call.\\"Durham, Frank (ed.), Studies in Cane. Columbus: Charles E. Merrill Publishing Company, 1971. Gregory criticized Toomer for his labored and puzzling style and for Toomer‚Äôs overuse of the folk. Gregory believed that Toomer was biased towards folk culture and resented city life. W. E. B. Du Bois reviewed Cane in 1924, saying: \\"Toomer does not impress me as one who knows his Georgia but he does know human beings.\\" Du Bois goes on to say that Toomer does not depict an exact likeness of humans but rather depicts them like an Impressionist painter. Du Bois also wrote that Toomer‚Äôs writing is deliberately puzzling‚Äî\\"I cannot, for the life of me, for instance, see why Toomer could not have made the tragedy of Carma something that I could understand instead of vaguely guess at.\\" In his 1939 review \\"The New Negro\\", Sanders Redding wrote: \\"Cane was experimental, a potpourri of poetry and prose, in which the latter element is significant because of the influence it had on the course of Negro fiction.\\" White critics who reviewed Cane in 1923 were mostly positive about the novel, praising its new portrayal of African Americans. John Armstrong wrote: \\"It can perhaps be safely said that the Southern negro, at least, has found an authentic lyric voice in Jean Toomer‚Ä¶there is nothing of the theatrical coon-strutting high-brown, none of the conventional dice-throwing, chicken-stealing nigger of musical comedy and burlesque in the pages of Cane.\\" He goes on to say, ‚Äúthe Negro has been libeled rather than depicted accurately in American fiction‚Äù because fiction typically portrays African Americans as stereotypes. Cane gave white readers a chance to see a human portrayal of blacks‚Äî‚Äú[blacks] were seldom ever presented to white eyes with any other sort of intelligence than that displayed by an idiot child with epilepsy.‚Äù Robert Littell wrote in his 1923 review that \\"Cane does not remotely resemble any of the familiar, superficial views of the South on which we have been brought up. On the contrary, Mr. Toomer‚Äôs view is unfamiliar and bafflingly subterranean, the vision of a poet far more than the account of things seen by a novelist.\\"  Modern criticism  Alice Walker said of the book, \\"It has been reverberating in me to an astonishing degree. I love it passionately, could not possibly exist without it.\\" In The Negro Novel in America, Robert A. Bone wrote: \\"By far the most impressive product of the Negro Renaissance, Cane ranks with Richard Wright‚Äôs Native Son and Ralph Ellison‚Äôs Invisible Man as a measure of the Negro novelist‚Äôs highest achievement. Jean Toomer belongs to that first rank of writers who use words almost as a plastic medium, shaping new meanings from an original and highly personal style.\\"Bone, Robert A. The Negro Novel in America. Yale University Press, 1965. Gerald Strauss points out that despite \\"critical uncertainty and controversy,\\" he finds that Cane's structure is not without precedent: \\"it is similar to James Joyce‚Äôs Dubliners (1914) and Sherwood Anderson‚Äôs Winesburg, Ohio (1919), two other thematically related story collections that develop unified and coherent visions of societies. It also echoes Edgar Lee Masters‚Äôs poetry collection Spoon River Anthology (1915) ... Toomer surely was familiar with the Joyce and Masters books, and he knew Anderson personally.\\"Strauss, Gerald. \\"Cane.\\" Masterplots II: African American Literature, Revised Edition (2008): 1-4. Literary Reference Center Plus. Web. October 1, 2012.  Legacy  In 1973, Alice Walker and fellow Zora Neale Hurston scholar Charlotte D. Hunt discovered a grave they thought was Hurston's in Ft. Pierce, Florida. Walker had it marked with a gray marker stating ZORA NEALE HURSTON / A GENIUS OF THE SOUTH / NOVELIST FOLKLORIST / ANTHROPOLOGIST / 1901‚Äì1960. The line \\"a genius of the south\\" is from Toomer's poem \\"Georgia Dusk\\", which appears in the novel. Hurston, who could be deceptive about her age, was actually born in 1891, not 1901. The novel inspired the Gil Scott-Heron song \\"Cane\\", in which he sings about two main characters of the novel: Karintha and Becky. The novel inspired Marion Brown in his \\"Georgia\\" trilogy of jazz albums, especially on Geechee Recollections (1973), where he put \\"Karintha\\" to music, recited by Bill Hasson.

It used a new algorithm called Carrier-phase Differential GPS (CDGPS) to calibrate global positioning systems to an accuracy of 3 millimeters. This technology can allow multiple spacecraft to travel in close proximity. The CUSat project began in 2005 and was the winner of the University Nanosat-4 Program which aims to educate the future aerospace workforce and develop new space technologies. As part of this program, CUSat completed environmental testing and other aspects of final I&T; in the AFRL Aerospace Engineering Facility at Kirtland Air Force Base. CUSat worked with AFRL to complete the Department of Defense SERB process in preparation for a launch with the Space Test Program. The satellite launched as a secondary payload to CASSIOPE on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on 29 September 2013. Operation details The space segment was originally designed to consist of two functionally identical satellites that would launch together and separate on orbit in a target-inspector configuration. Once in orbit, CUSat would use microthrust Pulsed Plasma Thrusters (PPTs) and sub-centimeter level accurate carrier-phase differential GPS (CDGPS) to navigate the satellites to within ten meters of each other. The inspector satellite would use cameras to gather imagery of the target satellite while performing relative navigation. Target satellite imagery would be transferred to the ground segment, where they would be used to reconstruct a three-dimensional model for the end user. The mission was modified after one of the segments was damaged during testing. It later consisted of a single satellite with multiple antennas that transmit data to each other. =Original plan=  Phase One: Launch  CUSat launched as a secondary payload on a launch vehicle. Once in orbit and in the correct attitude, CUSat separated from the launch vehicle where it began Phase Two - the initialization.  Phase Two: Initialization  Once CUSat separates from the launch vehicle and enters the Initialization Phase, it will enter solar illumination where the spacecraft will power on. The spacecraft will make contact with the Mission Control Center at Cornell through one of several ground stations, beaconing its status. Next, the spacecraft will begin to assess its tumble rates, and will detumble if required. Once stabilized, CUSat will begin commissioning operations. Operators in the MCC will assess the health of most satellite subsystems. During this time, the top spacecraft will begin to search for surrounding GPS satellites. A Carrier-phase Differential GPS Lock is then acquired to obtain an accurate attitude solution. The spacecraft will enter Phase Three: Spacecraft Separation.  Phase Three: Spacecraft Separation  Once an attitude control was obtained, CUSat's actuators adjusted the attitude for a proper separation. While still in illumination, CUsat then performed a low-shock separation through the use of a lightband into Top and Bottom satellites. After separation, CUSat entered Phase Four: Inspection  Phase Four: Inspection  Once both Top and Bottom satellites obtained a GPS lock, the relative distance between the two was calculated via CDGPS. When the partner satellite entered an operational camera's field of view, the inspecting satellite acquired images of the partner satellite. The ground request specific images, which were subsequently downlinked from the space segment in the next communication opportunities. On the ground, the downlinked data was used to construct a 3D image of CUSat to verify the CDGPS data.  The team  At the time of its launch in 2013, it was estimated that 200 Cornell University students had participated in the project since it began in 2005. = Administration = The Principal Investigator for the CUSat project is Mason Peck. The two advisors for the CUSat project are Mark Campbell and Mark Psiaki. = Technical backgrounds = Because CUSat is an engineering project team at Cornell University, it is composed of a multitude of different students with a variety of abilities and talents. Team members come from such majors as Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Applied and Engineering Physics, Computer Science, Economics and Management, and even Architecture.  Subsystems  There has been a major redistribution of work, into different subsystems since FCR. The current subsystems are listed below. *ADCNS: The Attitude Determination, Control, and Navigation Subsystem (ADCNS) executes the relative navigation that were to be used for CUSat's in-orbit inspection procedures. CUSat primarily used three GPS boards for attitude determination. For attitude control, CUSat used pulsed-plasma thrusters (PPTs) and reaction wheels. The software portion of ADCNS consisted of the relative navigation algorithms, which ran the various modes of operation defined by the CONOPs. *Camera: The camera team was responsible for acquiring images while in orbit, compressing them in a modified JPEG format, and relaying them to the onboard computer, C&DH.; *Command and Data Handling: C&DH; was the central hub for communication and computation on the satellite. Using a commercial off the shelf (COTS) single board computer running Windows CE and C++, C&DH; executed the ADCNS algorithms and flight code. *GPS: The GPS team was responsible for the GPS receivers, antennas and algorithms used to calculate sub-centimeter relative positioning. *Ground Segment: The ground segment was responsible for the ground operations of the satellite, including ground to satellite communication, tracking and commanding. *Harness: The Harness subsystem was responsible for satellite wiring, the electronics backplane, the electrical interface boards, and any System level electrical concerns. *Industry Relations: The Industry Relations team was responsible for marketing CUSat and seeking commercial and academic sponsorship. *Integration and Testing: The I&T; team was responsible for enabling rapid integration and testing of CUSat. I&T; was also responsible for testing CUSat in Cornell University's thermal vacuum chamber. *Mechanical Hardware: The Mechanical Hardware team manufactured the satellite structure and managed the design.

He is a member of the board and chairman of Agudas Chasidei Chabad, the movement's umbrella organization, and was entrusted by the Rebbe with various missions, among them as the movement's envoy to the White House and Capitol Hill. He is the founding national director of American Friends of Lubavitch,Lubavitch activities in Greater Philadelphia, PA, and director of the first Camp Gan Israel in Parksville, NY. Early life Abraham Isaac Shemtov was born February 16, 1937, in Moscow, Russia, to a Hasidic family. His father, Rabbi Benzion Shemtov was a staunch adherent of the Lubavitcher Rebbe and Jewish activist. Abraham Shemtov grew up in the city of Tashkent, Uzbekistan, and studied there in an underground Jewish school in the Soviet years. He did his undergraduate and graduate work at the Tomchei Temimim, in Brooklyn, NY, and was ordained as a practicing rabbi in 1960.

When the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe fled Nazi-occupied Warsaw in 1939 for the United States, the library was confiscated. Upon revealing the location of manuscripts at the government-controlled Yiddisher Historic Institute in Warsaw, Shemtov was asked to help assist Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky in pursuing its release. Through the help of the U.S. State Department, Shemtov spent three years en route Europe - U.S. in negotiation with the communist Polish government. At the end of 1977, the books were placed in the Library of Agudas Chassidei Chabad.The Story of Hey Teves, shmais.com, 05/01/06 =Chanukah phenomenon= President Ronald Reagan receives menorah from Rabbi Abraham Shemtov and a delegation representing the \\"American Friends of Lubavitch,\\" White House, 1984.

The group recounted that they were surprised that, when the time had come for them to leave, the President invited them to remain a little longer, so that he could tell them a story about a rabbi serving as a Navy chaplain. He shared with them the story of Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff, whose kippa, skullcap, had to be discarded after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing, because it was covered in blood after being used to wipe the faces of wounded Marines, and so a Catholic chaplain tore a piece of his camouflage uniform off, to be used as a temporary replacement for the kippa. The President asked the group about the tradition for Jewish men to cover their heads, and Shemtov replied, \\"Mr. President, the kippa to us is a sign of reverence.\\" A colleague in the group, Rabbi Feller, continued, \\"We place the kippa on the very highest point of our being -- on our head, the vessel of our intellect -- to tell ourselves and the world that there is something which is above man's intellect -- the infinite Wisdom of G-d.\\"\\"Rabbis Explain 'Top to Top',\\" Wellsprings, No. 12 (Vol 2, No. 7), August‚ÄìSeptember 1986,\\" Lubavitch Youth Organization.

While the programme was earlier called FGFA, the combined project is now referred as Perspective Multi-Role Fighter (PMF).Menon, Jay. \\"India And Russia To Ink R&D; Phase Of T-50 Program.\\" Aerospace Daily & Defense Report, 21 August 2012. The completed FGFA was to include a total of 43 improvements over the Su-57, including advanced sensors, networking and combat avionics.Mathews, Neelam. \\"India's Version of Sukhoi T-50 Delayed by Two Years.\\" AIN, 25 May 2012. The Indian version would be a two-seater with pilot and co-pilot or weapon systems operator (WSO). It was reported India withdrew from the FGFA programme in 2018, but also hinted that the project could be resumed at a later date, when the Su-57 is fully operational in the Russian Air Force first. However, General Director of United Aircraft Corporation Yuri Slyusar claimed that the FGFA program was not cancelled and India is still working with Russia regarding to the future aircraft. In October 2019, the Indian Air Force Chief of Air Staff RKS Bhadauria stated that the country will not be importing stealth fighters like the Su-57, and will instead focus on indigenous efforts such as the HAL AMCA. Development Following the success of the BrahMos project, Russia and India agreed in early 2007 to jointly study and develop a Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) programme. On 11 September 2010, it was reported that India and Russia had agreed on a preliminary design contract, subject to Cabinet approval. In December 2010, a memorandum of understanding for preliminary design of the Indo-Russian fighter was reportedly signed between Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), and Russian companies Rosoboronexport and Sukhoi.\\"Russia, India to begin design of 5G-fighter in December.\\" RIA Novosti, 27 October 2010. Retrieved: 19 November 2012. While the Russian version will be a single-pilot fighter, the Indian variant will be based on its own operational doctrine which calls for greater radius of combat operations. The wings and control surfaces need to be reworked for the FGFA. By February 2009, as per Sukhoi General Director Mikhail Pogosyan, India will initially get the same PAK FA fighter of Russia and the only difference will be the software. In 2010, a total of 500 aircraft were planned with options for further aircraft. Russian Air Force will have 200 single-seat and 50 twin-seat PAK FAs while Indian Air Force will get 166 single seated and 48 twin-seated FGFAs. Under the project terms, single-seat fighters will be assembled in Russia, while Hindustan Aeronautics will assemble two-seaters. HAL negotiated a 25% share of design and development work in the FGFA programme. HAL's work share will include critical software including the mission computer, navigation systems, most of the cockpit displays, the counter measure dispensing (CMD) systems and modifying Sukhoi's prototype into fighter as per the requirement of the Indian Air Force (IAF). Sukhoi director Mikhail Pogosyan projected a market for 1,000 aircraft over the next four decades, 200 each for Russia and India and 600 for other countries in 2010. Russian Trade Minister Viktor Khristenko said that the aircraft are to be jointly developed and produced with India and both countries will \\"share benefits from selling the plane not only on their domestic markets, but also on the markets of third countries.\\" The Editor-in- chief of Natsionalnaya Oborona, Igor Korotchenko, said in February 2013 that exports of the jointly designed fighter should help Russia increase its share of arms exports to the world. =Project changes and delays= In May 2012, the Indian Ministry of Defence (MoD) announced a two-year delay in the project's development. Ashok Nayak, who spoke on the record as HAL's chairman before retiring, explained that the IAF have required 40‚Äì45 improvements made from the PAK-FA to meet Indian needs. These changes were then formally agreed upon between India and Russia. The Russian and Indian air forces each planned to purchase about 250 FGFAs, at an estimated $100 million per fighter for an $25 billion total, in addition to the development costs. By October 2012, India had cut its total purchase size from 200 to 144 aircraft. India's initial investment had grown from $5 billion to $6 billion, and the estimated total programme cost had grown to $30 billion in 2012.Luthra, Gulshan. \\"IAF decides on 144 Fifth Generation Fighters.\\" India Strategic, October 2012. In 2013, it was revealed that the Russian and Indian fighters would be using the same avionics. Alexander Fomin said that \\"Both sides involved in this project are investing a lot into it, and on equal terms.\\" Russia later admitted to huge delays and cost overruns in the project. The contract has not be finalised, and the IAF has accused HAL of giving away up to half of India's share of the development work. India contributes 15% of the research and development work, but provides half the cost. On 9 March 2015, media outlets reported that the countries agreed to reduce the aircraft delivery time from 92 months to 36 months with the signing of the final agreement. India is also ready to forego a 50:50 work share to prevent further delays from absorption of a new technology; both countries agreed to manufacture the first batch of aircraft in Russia and for subsequent batches to be manufactured by HAL. By 2016, Indian interest in the project was fading after Russia cut back their own purchases. On 25 January 2016, it was reported that Russia and India have agreed to develop FGFA and lower investment cost to $4 billion for each nation. They will invest $1 billion in the first year and another $500 million per year for the following six years. In September 2016, the two nations announced a detailed work-share agreement for joint production. In May 2017, another announcement came out regarding a \\"milestone\\" pact to finalise the detailed design for the fifth-generation fighter aircraft (FGFA) and move ahead with the multibillion-dollar co-development project. It is expected to be signed in the second half of the year. Then later that month the project appeared to be lost when the Russians suddenly demanded seven billion dollars that the Indians could not afford. An Indian committee has reportedly been set up to evaluate need for FGFA in light of the price increase and progress on the HAL AMCA project. It has been reported that India and Russia are studying an upgrade to the Su-35 with stealth technology (similar to the F-15 Silent Eagle) as a more affordable alternative to the FGFA. = India's reluctance to continue programme = On 2 September 2017, the Indian Air Force cited demanding maintenance programs, and high maintenance costs as main reasons behind its reluctance to proceed with the project. India prefers to produce its own fifth-generation fighter to maintain parity with China's air force that has recently debuted the Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter. On 20 April 2018, it was reported that India had left the project.India Pulls out of Joint Stealth Fighter Project With Russia. Franz-Stefan Gady, The Diplomat. 23 April 2018.https://www.rt.com/news/427263-russia-india-talks-modi-putin/ India officials reported that they became increasingly disappointed with the project's progress after long years of negotiations, delays, and struggles with Russian contractors. They asserted that they were not satisfied with the capabilities of the Su-57, the foundation for FGFA's development, among many things the degree of low observability allowed by the design being the biggest of issues. However, Indian officials did not rule out the possibility of relaunching the FGFA project once the Su-57 is fully introduced into the Russian air force, or later acquiring the fully developed platform. On 19 August 2018, it was reported that the FGFA program was not cancelled; the General Director of United Aircraft Corporation Yuri Slyusar denied the previous reports saying \\"the topic is not closed\\" and that Russia and India are still discussing the creation of the fifth-generation fighter. On 9 July 2019, during a meeting with IAF representatives, Russia offered India to resume its participation in Su-57 program. Deputy Director of Russia‚Äôs Federal Service for Military and Technical Cooperation Vladimir Drozhzhov told that \\"Russia is open to that... We are ready and are proposing this program to our Indian partners\\". IAF Air Chief Marshall Birender Singh Dhanoa during an interview with Russian Ministry of Defense's official newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star), stated that while Su-57 is currently not being considered for the IAF, but the combat aircraft can be evaluated once it joins active service with the Russian Air Force. Design Russian expertise in titanium structures will be complemented by India's experience in composites like in the fuselage. Speaking to Flight International, United Aircraft chief Mikhail Pogosyan said India is giving engineering inputs covering latest airframe design, Hi-Tech software development and other systems. By August 2014, the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) had completed the front end engineering design for the FGFA for which a contract had been signed with India's HAL in 2010. =Differences for FGFA= When complete, the FGFA would've been predominantly armed with weapons of Indian origin such as the Astra, a beyond- visual-range missile (BVR) being developed by India. Although in keeping with the Russian BVR doctrine of using a variety of different missiles for versatility and unpredictability to countermeasures, the aircraft was expected to have compatibility with various missile types. It was reported, the FGFA would include systems developed by third parties. The completed joint Indian/Russian versions of the operational fighters would've differed from the then flying prototypes through a total of 43 improvements. Russia had agreed to the demand of the Indian Air force that it must be a two-seater fighter. India had plans for it to be a two-seater with a pilot and weapon systems operator.

Yoshizawa also mastered several other traditional Japanese flutes, in addition to other Japanese and Western musical instruments. He was also considered a scholar of ancient and modern Japanese traditional music. Yoshizawa's work and music were featured in a number of major Hollywood studio films and soundtracks, including The Joy Luck Club and Memoirs of a Geisha. Early life Masakazu Yoshizawa was born on September 10, 1950, in Hida, Gifu, Japan. His mother was the only obstetrician in their village and his father was a veterinarian. Yoshizawa was required to play a musical instrument in his elementary school. He began playing the accordion when he was 9 years old, and soon moved to the piano, several woodwinds and the shakuhachi, which he was to become world-famous for playing. He soon became a proficient musician, especially with the shakuhachi. Yoshizawa began playing as both a studio musician and in orchestras in Tokyo by the age of 19. He studied Western music at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, where he earned a degree in the early 1970s. Career Yoshizawa moved from Japan to Los Angeles in the mid-1970s. He initially worked as a musician, often as a clarinet and saxophone player. He also worked as a sushi chef. However, when he was specifically requested to play the shakuhachi for a certain job, it sparked his interest in the instrument, as well as in Japanese music. Yoshizawa returned to Japan to take shakuhachi lessons before moving back to California. He began to be hired as a shakuhachi player for film and television, which quickly converted his passion for Japanese music into a full-fledged career. Yoshizawa explained the interest that film and television producers had in his music in a 2005 interview with the Cultural News, a web site that focuses on Japan-themed films: \\"they wanted a sound that Western music didn't have . . . that was new and fit the film.\\" Yoshizawa ultimately played the shakuhachi on dozens of different movies and television shows. His early movie credits included the Karate Kid sequels and the 1993 film, Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story. Yoshizawa began his collaboration with acclaimed film composer, John Williams, on Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster, Jurassic Park. He once told the Cultural News web site that Williams asked him to play the shakuhachi for Jurassic Park because the instrument \\"sounds like a dinosaur's cry.\\" Masakazu Yoshizawa would next work with John Williams again in the film version of Memoirs of a Geisha, which was released in 2005. Yoshizawa was initially hired for the movie as a drummer for the Memoirs of a Geisha soundtrack, but was soon asked to play the shakuhachi and other traditional instruments for the film instead. The soundtrack for the movie was expanded by Williams into a concert suite which featured Yoshizawa on the shakuhachi and Yo-Yo Ma on the cello. It was performed by the musicians at the Tanglewood Music Festival in Massachusetts in 2006. Death Masakazu Yoshizawa died at his home in San Gabriel, California, of stomach cancer on October 24, 2007. He was survived by his daughter, Chrissy Tama Yoshizawa (then, Chrissy Tama Langley and now, Chrissy Yoshizawa Wirt); his son, James Naoki Yoshizawa; his sister, Chieko and his granddaughter, Cassandra Marie Langley. He was a divorcee. John Williams released a statement to the Los Angeles Times following Yoshizawa's death: \\"Masa was a brilliant musician and a very important member of the orchestra, and he will be greatly missed.\\" External links Obituary in The Times, 11 December 2007  * References 1950 births 2007 deaths American film score composers Male film score composers American flautists American multi-instrumentalists Japanese-American instrumentalists American musicians of Japanese descent Japanese flautists Shakuhachi players Japanese emigrants to the United States Japanese multi-instrumentalists Musicians from Gifu Prefecture 20th-century Japanese musicians 20th-century American composers 20th-century American male musicians ","title":"Masakazu Yoshizawa"},{"id":"14325911","text":"Breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance protein 1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the BCAR1 gene.  Gene  BCAR1 is localized on chromosome 16 on region q, on the negative strand and it consists of seven exons. Eight different gene isoforms have been identified that share the same sequence starting from the second exon onwards but are characterized by different starting sites. The longest isoform is called BCAR1-iso1 (RefSeq NM_001170714.1) and is 916 amino acids long, the other shorter isoforms start with an alternative first exon.  Function  BCAR1 is a ubiquitously expressed adaptor molecule originally identified as the major substrate of v-Src and v-Crk . p130Cas/BCAR1 belongs to the Cas family of adaptor proteins and can act as a docking protein for several signalling partners. Due to its ability to associate with multiple signaling partners, p130Cas/BCAR1 contributes to the regulation to a variety of signaling pathways leading to cell adhesion, migration, invasion, apoptosis, hypoxia and mechanical forces. p130Cas/BCAR1 plays a role in cell transformation and cancer progression and alterations of p130Cas/BCAR1 expression and the resulting activation of selective signalling are determinants for the occurrence of different types of human tumors. Due to the capacity of p130Cas/BCAR1, as an adaptor protein, to interact with multiple partners and to be regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, its expression and phosphorylation can lead to a wide range of functional consequences. Among the regulators of p130Cas/BCAR1 tyrosine phosphorylation, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and integrins play a prominent role. RTK-dependent p130Cas/BCAR1 tyrosine phosphorylation and the subsequent binding with specific downstream signaling molecule modulate cell processes such as actin cytoskeleton remodeling, cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, invasion and survival. Integrin-mediated p130Cas/BCAR1 phosphorylation upon adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) induces downstream signaling that is required for allowing cells to spread and migrate on the ECM. Both RTKs and integrin activation affect p130Cas/BCAR1 tyrosine phosphorylation and represent an efficient means by which cells utilize signals coming from growth factors and integrin activation to coordinate cell responses. Additionally, p130Cas/BCAR1 tyrosine phosphorylation on its substrate domain can be induced by cell stretching subsequent to changes in the rigidity of the extracellular matrix, allowing cells to respond to mechanical force changes in the cell environment.  Cas-Family  p130Cas/BCAR1 is a member of the Cas family (Crk-associated substrate) of adaptor proteins which is characterized by the presence of multiple conserved motifs for protein‚Äìprotein interactions, and by extensive tyrosine and serine phosphorylations. The Cas family comprises other three members: NEDD9 (Neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 9, also called Human enhancer of filamentation 1, HEF-1 or Cas-L), EFS (Embryonal Fyn-associated substrate), and CASS4 (Cas scaffolding protein family member 4). These Cas proteins have a high structural homology, characterized by the presence of multiple protein interaction domains and phosphorylation motifs through which Cas family members can recruit effector proteins. However, despite the high degree of similarity, their temporal expression, tissue distribution and functional roles are distinct and not overlapping. Notably, the knock-out of p130Cas/BCAR1 in mice is embryonic lethal, suggesting that other family members do not show an overlapping role in development.  Structure  p130Cas/BCAR1 is a scaffold protein characterized by several structural domains. It possesses an amino N-terminal Src-homology 3 domain (SH3) domain, followed by a proline-rich domain (PRR) and a substrate domain (SD). The substrate domain consists of 15 repeats of the YxxP consensus phosphorylation motif for Src family kinases (SFKs). Following the substrate domain is the serine-rich domain, which forms a four-helix bundle. This acts as a protein- interaction motif, similar to those found in other adhesion-related proteins such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and vinculin. The remaining carboxy- terminal sequence contains a bipartite Src-binding domain (residues 681‚Äì713) able to bind both the SH2 and SH3 domains of Src. p130Cas/BCAR1 can undergo extensive changes in tyrosine phosphorylation that occur predominantly in the 15 YxxP repeats within the substrate domain and represent the major post- translational modification of p130Cas/BCAR1. p130Cas/BCAR1 tyrosine phosphorylation can result from a diverse range of extracellular stimuli, including growth factors, integrin activation, vasoactive hormones and peptides ligands for G-protein coupled receptors. These stimuli triggers p130Cas/BCAR1 tyrosine phosphorylation and its translocation from cytosol to the cell membrane.  Clinical significance  Given the ability of p130Cas/BCAR1 scaffold protein to convey and integrate different type of signals and subsequently to regulate key cellular functions such as adhesion, migration, invasion, proliferation and survival, the existence of a strong correlation between deregulated p130Cas/BCAR1 expression and cancer was inferred. Deregulated expression of p130Cas/BCAR1 has been identified in several cancer types. Altered levels of p130Cas/BCAR1 expression in cancers can result from gene amplification, transcription upregulation or changes in protein stability. Overexpression of p130Cas/BCAR1 has been detected in human breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, glioma, melanoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma and chronic myelogenous leukaemia. The presence of aberrant levels of hyperphosphorylated p130Cas/BCAR1 strongly promotes cell proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, angiogenesis and drug resistance. It has been demonstrated that high levels of p130Cas/BCAR1 expression in breast cancer correlate with worse prognosis, increased probability to develop metastasis and resistance to therapy. Conversely, lowering the amount of p130Cas/BCAR1 expression in ovarian, breast and prostate cancer is sufficient to block tumor growth and progression of cancer cells. p130Cas/BCAR1 has potential uses as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for some human cancers. Since lowering p130Cas/BCAR1 in tumor cells is sufficient to halt their transformation and progression, it is conceivable to propose p130Cas/BCAR1 may represent a therapeutic target. However, the non-catalytic nature of p130Cas/BCAR1 makes difficult to develop specific inhibitors.

It narrates the deaths of three subjects: a noblewoman, a coachman and a tree. Synopsis =Chapter 1= The story begins with a noblewoman named Lady Shirkinskaya and her maid riding in a carriage. The noblewoman, who is suffering from consumption, wears an expression of anger and scorn. The carriage, accompanied by a cal√®che, stops by a posting-station. The husband of the noblewoman and a doctor step out of the cal√®che, but the noblewoman refuses to leave her carriage. As the husband and the doctor discuss privately the noblewoman's unfavorable outlook, the posting-master's daughter, Masha, and her friend, Aksusha, run out to look at the Lady Shirkinskaya, vocally noting her sickly appearance. In fear that the noblewoman won't live through the journey, the husband suggests postponing and turning back home. Angrily she responds that they must go abroad for her recovery because the only thing she should do at home is die. At the mere mention of death, Lady Sirkinskaya grows quiet, pouts like a child, and begins to cry. =Chapter 2= Inside the common room of the posting-station, a sick man introduced as Uncle Hvedor (a mispronunciation of Fyodor) lies on top of the stove. A young post-driver named Serega asks him for his boots, seeing as he won't need them anymore. Instead of answering the youth, Uncle Hvedor struggles to drink a cup of water. The post-driver asks again and this time the cook chimes in, pointing out that his cough only worsens and that a dead man does not need new boots. Having gathered his strength, Uncle Hvedor replies that he will give his boots to the post-driver on the condition that he buys him a headstone for his grave. The post-driver promises, but leaves; he later mentions to a fellow driver that he got the boots for seemingly nothing. The sick man remains on the stove; stifling his cough, he does not make a sound the entire evening. At the sight of the dying man, the cook takes pity and wraps his cold feet. That night, the cook dreams of Uncle Hvedor climbing down from the stove and leaving to chop wood. In this dream, Uncle Hvedor reassures her that he is well. Upon waking, the cook and the drivers in the posting-office discover he has died. After burying him, the cook tells everyone of her strange dream. =Chapter 3= Spring has come. The story transitions back to the noblewoman, laying in her bedroom. Her condition has worsened. A priest waits on a divan outside, while the husband talks with his wife's sister. Afterwards, the sister attempts to comfort the noblewoman, who begins claiming that she has come to terms with death. This mature and faithful attitude leads the sister to say that Lady Shirkinskaya \\"is an angel\\" as she leaves the room. Proclaiming God's mercifulness, the noblewoman beckons her husband closer and commands him to send for the medicine the priest mentioned earlier. For a woman that has accepted her death, Lady Shirkinskaya continues to cling on to any hope of living. That evening, she died in her large apartment with closed doors. =Chapter 4= A marble monuments marks the noblewoman's grave, but Uncle Hyedor's remains without a headstone. The cook tells the young post-driver Serega that it would be a shame to not make good on his promise. Serega responds that he will buy the headstone when he is in town, but meanwhile settles on erecting a wooden cross to mark the grave. The next morning, Serega takes his axe and cuts down a tree. After the tree crashes down, its neighbors look more beautiful in the new free space; their branches rustle sublimely over the fallen body. Interpretation The story affirms the ideal of man leading a simple, authentic life alongside nature through its portrayal of attitudes toward death. The author himself gave a thorough interpretation of his work in a letter to A.A.

The noblewoman is pathetic and disgusting, because she lied her entire life and continues to lie before death. Christianity, as she understands it, does not resolve for her the question of life and death. Why die, when you want to live? She believes with her imagination and intellect in Christianity's promise of the future, but her entire being rears up, and there is no other comfort (except a false Christian one), -- and the place is taken. She is disgusting and pathetic. The muzhik dies calmly, exactly because he isn't a Christian. His religion is different, although by custom he performed the Christian rites; his religion is nature, with whom he lived. He himself cut down the trees, sowed rye and mowed it, killed rams, and had rams born, and children were born, and old men died, and he knew this law well; this law, from which he never turned away, like the noblewoman did, he directly and simply looked it in the face... The tree dies quietly, honestly, and beautifully. Beautifully, because it does not lie or break; it is not scared or sorry.\\" References External links 1859 short stories Short stories by Leo Tolstoy ","title":"Three Deaths"},{"id":"14326045","text":"Pippal may refer to: *Transliteration of the Punjabi name for the Sacred fig, a tree ;People *Eugenie Pippal-Kottnig, an Austrian architect (1921‚Äì1998) *Hans Robert Pippal, an Austrian painter (1915‚Äì1998) *Martina Pippal, an Austrian art historian and artist (born 1957) ","title":"Pippal"},{"id":"14326063","text":"The Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production is an Annie Award, awarded annually to the best animated television show.

Within six months he was studying both jazz and classical music at the Interlochen Arts Academy, a camp for gifted music students. He attended the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. As a student he won Best Jazz and Best Pop/Rock Instrumental Soloist in the Down Beat magazine National Student Recording Awards. After college he moved to New York City in 1984. During the next four years he worked as a sideman with Eric Marienthal, Hiram Bullock, Eric Gale, Richard Tee, Jaco Pastorius, David Sanborn, and the Gil Evans Monday Night Orchestra. He also worked on jingles for commercials. His debut album was released in 1987 by Gaia/Gramavision Records. Soon after, he was signed to GRP by Dave Grusin and Larry Rosen. In the 1980s he was a member of Members Only, a jazz ensemble which recorded for Muse. Beginning in 1989, he recorded eight albums for GRP. He has recorded with The Rippingtons, Chuck Loeb, Patti Austin, Tom Browne, the GRP All-Star Big Band and is featured on The Hang, an album by Don Grusin that was nominated for a Grammy Award. In the late 1990s he signed with Shanachie Records.

Gamma- actin is widely expressed in cellular cytoskeletons of many tissues; in adult striated muscle cells, gamma-actin is localized to Z-discs and costamere structures, which are responsible for force transduction and transmission in muscle cells. Mutations in ACTG1 have been associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss and Baraitser-Winter syndrome, as well as susceptibility of adolescent patients to vincristine toxicity.  Structure  Human gamma-actin is 41.8 kDa in molecular weight and 375 amino acids in length. Actins are highly conserved proteins that are involved in various types of cell motility, and maintenance of the cytoskeleton. In vertebrates, three main groups of actin isoforms, alpha, beta and gamma have been identified. The alpha actins are found in muscle tissues and are a major constituent of the sarcomere contractile apparatus. The beta and gamma actins co-exist in most cell types as components of the cytoskeleton, and as mediators of internal cell motility. Actin, gamma 1, encoded by this gene, is found in non-muscle cells in the cytoplasm, and in muscle cells at costamere structures, or transverse points of cell-cell adhesion that run perpendicular to the long axis of myocytes.  Function  In myocytes, sarcomeres adhere to the sarcolemma via costameres, which align at Z-discs and M-lines. The two primary cytoskeletal components of costameres are desmin intermediate filaments and gamma-actin microfilaments. It has been shown that gamma-actin interacting with another costameric protein dystrophin is critical for costameres forming mechanically strong links between the cytoskeleton and the sarcolemmal membrane. Additional studies have shown that gamma-actin colocalizes with alpha-actinin and GFP-labeled gamma actin localized to Z-discs, whereas GFP-alpha-actin localized to pointed ends of thin filaments, indicating that gamma actin specifically localizes to Z-discs in striated muscle cells. During development of myocytes, gamma actin is thought to play a role in the organization and assembly of developing sarcomeres, evidenced in part by its early colocalization with alpha-actinin. Gamma-actin is eventually replaced by sarcomeric alpha-actin isoforms, with low levels of gamma-actin persisting in adult myocytes which associate with Z-disc and costamere domains. Insights into the function of gamma-actin in muscle have come from studies employing transgenesis. In a skeletal muscle- specific knockout of gamma-actin in mice, these animals showed no detectable abnormalities in development; however, knockout mice showed muscle weakness and fiber necrosis, along with decreased isometric twitch force, disrupted intrafibrillar and interfibrillar connections among myocytes, and myopathy.  Clinical Significance  An autosomal dominant mutation in ACTG1 in the DFNA20/26 locus at 17q25-qter was identified in patients with hearing loss. A Thr278Ile mutation was identified in helix 9 of gamma-actin protein, which is predicted to alter protein structure. This study identified the first disease causing mutation in gamma-actin and underlies the importance of gamma-actin as structural elements of the inner ear hair cells. Since then, other ACTG1 mutations have been linked to nonsyndromic hearing loss, including Met305Thr. A missense mutation in ACTG1 at Ser155Phe has also been identified in patients with Baraitser-Winter syndrome, which is a developmental disorder characterized by congenital ptosis, excessively-arched eyebrows, hypertelorism, ocular colobomata, lissencephaly, short stature, seizures and hearing loss. Differential expression of ACTG1 mRNA was also identified in patients with Sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, a devastating disease with unknown causality, using a sophisticated bioinformatics approach employing Affymetrix long-oligonucleotide BaFL methods. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in ACTG1 have been associated with vincristine toxicity, which is part of the standard treatment regimen for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Neurotoxicity was more frequent in patients that were ACTG1 Gly310Ala mutation carriers, suggesting that this may play a role in patient outcomes from vincristine treatment.  Interactions  ACTG1 has been shown to interact with: * CAP1, * DMD, * TMSB4X, and * plectin.

Burgoon and Miller, 1985; M. Burgoon, Hunsaker & Dawson, 1994; M. Burgoon, Jones & Stewart, 1975 The theory assumes language is a rules-based system, in which people develop expected norms as to appropriate language usage in given situations.M. Burgoon and Miller. 1985 Furthermore, unexpected linguistic usage can affect the receiver's behavior resulting from attitudes towards a persuasive message. Background Created by Michael Burgoon, a retired professor of medicine from the University of Arizona, and Gerald R. Miller, the inspiration for LET was sparked by Brooks' work on expectations of language in 1970. Burgoon, Jones and Stewart furthered the discussion with the idea of linguistic strategies and message intensity in an essay published in 1975. The essay linked linguistic strategies, or how a message is framed, to effective persuasive outcomes. The original work for the language expectation theory was published in 1978. Titled \\"An empirical test of a model of resistance to persuasion\\", it outlined the theory through 17s. Expectations The theory views language expectancies as enduring patterns of anticipated communication behavior which are grounded in a society's psychological and cultural norms. Such societal forces influence language and enable the identification of non-normative use; violations of linguistic, syntactic and semantic expectations will either facilitate or inhibit an audience's receptivity to persuasion. Burgoon claims applications for his theory in management, media, politics and medicine, and declares that his empirical research has shown a greater effect than expectancy violations theory, the domain of which does not extend to the spoken word. LET argues that typical language behaviors fall within a normative \\"bandwidth\\" of expectations determined by a source's perceived credibility, the individual listener's normative expectations and a group's normative social climate, and generally supports a gender-stereotypical reaction to the use of profanity, for example.M. Burgoon, Hunsaker & Dawson, 1994 Communication expectancies are said to derive from three factors: # The communicator ‚Äì individual features, such as ethos or source credibility, personality, appearance, social status and gender. # The relationship between a receiver and a communicator, including factors such as attraction, similarity and status equality. # Context; i.e., privacy and formality constraints on interaction. Violations Violating social norms can have a positive or negative effect on persuasion. Usually people use language to conform to social norms; but a person's intentional or accidental deviation from expected behavior can have either a positive or negative reaction. Language Expectancy Theory assumes that language is a rule-governed system and people develop expectations concerning the language or message strategies employed by others in persuasive attempts (Burgoon, 1995). Expectations are a function of cultural and sociological norms and preferences arising from cultural values and societal standards or ideals for competent communication. When observed, behavior is preferred over what was expected or when a listener's initial negative evaluation causes a speaker to conform more closely to the expected behavior. The deviation can be seen as positive,M. Burgoon, 1994; M. Burgoon and Miller, 1985 but when language choice or behavior is perceived as unacceptable or inappropriate behavior, the violation is negatively received and can inhibit the receptivity to a persuasive appeal. Positive violations occur (b) when negatively evaluated sources conform more closely than expected to cultural values or situational norms. This can result in overly positive evaluation of the source and change promoted by the actor (Burgoon, 1995). Negative violations, resulting from language choices that lie outside socially acceptable behavior in a negative direction, produce no attitude or behavior change in receivers. Summary of propositions Language expectancy theory is based on 17 propositions. Those propositions can be summarized as listed below: * 1, 2 and 3: People create expectations for language. Those expectations determine whether messages will be accepted or rejected by an individual. Breaking expectations positively results in a behavior change in favor of the persuasive message while a breaking expectations negatively results in no change or an opposite behavior change.Dillard & Pfau, 2001, p. 122 * 4, 5 and 6: Individuals with perceived credibility (those who hold power in a society) have the freedom in persuasion to select varied language strategies (wide bandwidth). Those with low credibility and those unsure of their perceived credibility are restricted to low aggression or compliance- gaining messages to be persuasive.Dillard & Pfau, 2001, p. 123 * 7, 8 and 9: Irrelevant fear and anxiety tactics are better received using low-intensity and verbally unaggressive compliance-gaining. Intense and aggressive language use result in lower levels of persuasion.Dillard & Pfau, 2001, p. 124-125 * 10, 11 and 12: For the persuader, an individual who is experiencing cognitive stress will use lower intensity messages. If a communicator violates his/her norms of communication, they will experience cognitive stress.Dillard & Pfau, 2001, p. 126 * 13 and 14: Pretreatments forewarn receivers of the persuasive attacks (supportive, refutational or a combination). When Persuasive messages do not violate expectations created by the pretreatments, resistance to persuasion is conferred. When pretreatment expectations of persuasive messages are violated, receivers are less resistant to persuasion. * 15, 16 and 17: Low intensity attack strategies are more effective than high intensity attack strategies when overcoming resistance to persuasion created in pretreatment. The first message in a string of arguments methodically affects the acceptance of the second message. When expectations are positively violated in the first message, the second will be persuasive. When expectations are negatively violated in the first message, the second will not be persuasive.Dillard & Pfau, 2001, p. 127 The role of intensity These propositions give rise to the impact of language intensity‚Äîdefined by John Waite Bowers as a quality of language that \\"indicates the degree to which the speaker's attitude toward a concept deviates from neutrality\\"Bowers, 1963, p. 345; 1964, p. 416‚Äîon persuasive messages.M. Burgoon and Miller, 1977 Theorists have concentrated on two key areas: (1) intensity of language when it comes to gender roles and (2) credibility. The perceived credibility of a source can greatly affect a message's persuasiveness. Researchers found that credible sources can enhance their appeal by using intense language; however, less credible speakers are more persuasive with low-intensity appeals.M. Burgoon, Dillard & Doran, 1983; M. Burgoon, Hunsaker & Dawson, 1994; M. Burgoon and Miller, 1985 Similarly, females are less persuasive than males when they use intense language because it violates the expected behavior, but are more persuasive when they use low- intensity language. Males, however, are seen as weak when they argue in a less intense manner. Theorists argue further that females and speakers perceived as having low credibility have less freedom in selecting message strategies and that the use of aggressive language negatively violates expectations.M. Burgoon, Dillard & Doran, 1983 Example To better explain the theory we look at the expectations and societal norms for a man and a woman on their first date. If the man pushed for further physical intimacy after dinner, the societal expectation of a first date would be violated. The example below with Margret and Steve depicts such a scene. Margret: \\"I had a really good time tonight, Steve. We should do it again.\\" Steve: \\"Let's cut the crap. Do you want to have sex?\\" Margret: \\"Uhhh...\\" Margret's language expectations of a first date were violated. Steve chooses an aggressive linguistic strategy. If Margret views Steve as a credible and appealing source, she may receive the message positively and, thus, the message would be persuasive. If Margret perceives Steve as an ambiguous or low-credible source, Steve will not be persuasive. In such a case, Steve should have used a low-aggressive message in his attempt to win Margret to his idea of having sex. Criticism * Determining whether a positive or negative violation has occurred can be difficult.M. Burgoon, 1993 When there is no attitude or behavior change it may be concluded that a negative violation has occurred (possibly related to a boomerang effect). Conversely, when an attitude or behavior change does occur it may be too easy to conclude a positive violation of expectations has occurred. * The theory has also been critiqued for being too \\"grand\\" in its predictive and explanatory goals. Burgoon counters that practical applications of his research conclusions are compelling enough to negate this criticism.

Angola has an embassy in Tel Aviv and Israel has an embassy in Luanda. History Angola Embassy, Tel Aviv The Israeli government aided the National Front for the Liberation of Angola in 1963 and 1969, during the Angolan War of Independence. In the 1960s, Holden Roberto, head of the NFLA, visited Israel and FNLA members were sent to Israel for training. In the 1970s, Israel shipped arms to the FNLA through Zaire. The Israeli embassy in Luanda was reopened in 1995, and Tamar Golan, who worked to maintain Israeli contacts with African countries throughout these decades, was appointed the Israeli ambassador. Tamar Golan left this post in 2002, but returned to Angola later on upon the request of the Angolan President Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos in order to help establish a taskforce, under the auspices of the UN, for the removal of landmines. The Israeli company \\"Geomine\\" provided Angola with mine detecting equipment, in order to facilitate their removal.Israeli technology clears landmines in Angola, by Adam Gonn, The Jerusalem Post, 10 August 2010 President Dos Santos visited Israel in 2005. In March 2006, the trade volume between the two countries amounted to $400 million. The Israeli ambassador to Angola is Oren Rozenblat. In 2010, the Angolan government refused to receive openly gay Isi Yanouka as the new ambassador due to his sexuality. In August 2012, the Angolan chancellor took a three-day visit to Jerusalem, where the governments of Angola and Israel ratified in Tel Aviv an agreement to strengthen the bonds between both countries. Israeli President Shimon Peres said that this should be based on the fields of science and technology, economy, and security, and the Angolan chancellor expressed the desire to continue with the bilateral cooperation in health, agriculture, science and technology, and the formation of Angolan experts.

She was used by the Union Navy as a gunboat in support of the Union Navy blockade of Confederate waterways. Post- war she performed some steamship service for the Navy. Service history Ascutney‚Äîa wooden-hulled, side-wheel gunboat ordered by the Navy in the autumn of 1862‚Äîwas launched on 4 April 1863 by George W. Jackman Jr. at Newburyport, Massachusetts, on 4 April 1863. Delivered to the New York Navy Yard in June 1863, she was commissioned on 28 July 1864, Lt. Comdr. William Mitchell in command. On 1 August 1864, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles ordered Mitchell to \\". . . visit the fishing grounds on the eastern coast [of the] French Islands, in the Bay [Gulf] of St. Lawrence ...\\" to seek the steamer Electric Spark, a prize of CSS Florida, thought to have been sent there. However, some now-unknown problem prevented Ascutney from undertaking this mission; and, three days later, Welles instructed Mitchell to bring his ship to Washington, D.C. en route to duty with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. The steamer arrived at Beaufort, North Carolina, on 21 August and, two days later, sailed for waters off Wilmington, North Carolina. Assigned to the outer cordon of blockaders attempting to seal off that vital Confederate port, Ascutney was the first Union warship to encounter CSS Tallahassee when‚Äîat 4:30 a.m. on the morning of 25 August‚Äîa lookout sighted that Confederate raider which Comdr. John Taylor Wood, CSN, was bringing back to Wilmington, North Carolina, at the end of a highly destructive 19-day cruise. Mitchell immediately gave chase, but the Southern ship's speed‚Äî17 knots‚Äîenabled her to slip away with ease. To make matters worse, Ascutney's engine broke down, taking the gunboat out of the race. Following a survey, the gunboat was towed to the Washington Navy Yard where she was decommissioned on 22 September 1864. Extensive repairs kept her in ordinary through the end of the Civil War. Finally recommissioned on 19 October 1865, Ascutney was stationed at the Washington Navy Yard and carried cargo and passengers in the Chesapeake Bay area and along the Atlantic Ocean coast between New York City and the Virginia Capes. Decommissioned at Washington, D.C. on 1 August 1868, she was sold on 28 October 1868 to John Roach. Since the ship's name did not appear on subsequent lists of merchant vessels, and since Roach was then embarking upon an extensive shipbuilding program, it is reasonable to conclude that she was scrapped for her materials  References  Ships of the Union Navy Ships built in Newburyport, Massachusetts Steamships of the United States Navy Sassacus-class gunboats American Civil War patrol vessels of the United States 1863 ships Cargo ships of the United States Navy ","title":"USS Ascutney"},{"id":"14326118","text":"Players Never Die is a 1997 album by singer Bobby Miller.

Overview  =Administration during colonial period= The administrative areas which make up Mariakani today were shared by the Durumas, Chonyi, Giriamas and Kambas. The British colonists considered it more prudent to administer the dominant ethnic groups separately. The Kilifi county side had a Giriama and Kamba Chief to take care of the interest of the two ethnic groups, whereas on the Kwale County side, i.e the Mwavumbo area, was another pair of chiefs to represent the Duruma and Kamba people. The last of these chiefs were the late Chief Johnson Mwero Mwaiga from Matumbi and Ex-Senior Chief Nzana wa Mumo from Gwasheni. From the 1960s onwards and especially after Kenya achieved independence, the practice was discontinued to give way to one chief for the entire area. The first chief of the area in Mwavumbo was Mkalla Mwero from Matumbi. =Today= The boundary between the two Counties has changed since the colonial times but nowadays there is the Railway line from Mazeras Town to Maji ya Chumvi. The origin of the centre is set in the 15th Century during the long distance trade. The traders from Ukambani threw away their weaponry at this spot as a peace sign when approaching Mombasa as the Sultan of that time did not allow traders to enter the island with any kind of weaponry. \\"Riaka\\" (Mariaka in plural is Durumas word for quiver; Mariakani translates as the place of quivers in Duruma language. The Giriama word for quiver is similar to the Kamba: Thyaka though it may be spelled slightly different. The Kamba call Quiver \\"Thyaka\\" (singular) hence the town is also called \\"Mathyakani\\" when speaking in Kigiriama or Kikamba. Most of the business activities are done on the Kaloleni side owing to the shift of transport preference to Mombasa- Nairobi Highway rather than the rail line and station. However, earlier business and development endeavours were done jointly by both side of the boundary. These include the Mariakani High school, the Kwale-Kilifi Milk Scheme Cooperative of the 1960's, slaughter houses among others. The Kwale County side is part of Mwavumbo area and is not widely known. Its population is dominantly Durumas and Coastal Kambas, the descendants of the explorers' scouts and long distance traders. Mariakani (Kilifi county side) hosts a town council with a population of 67,984, of whom 10,987 are classified urban (1999 census Kenya National Bureau of Statistics: Population of local authorities ). The town council consists of five wards: Kaliangombe, Kawala, Mariakani, Mugumo-wa-Patsa, Tsangatsini.

The site consists of a remarkably well-preserved Chinookan village, dating back more than 700 years. It is a major example of a wet archaeological site, in which cultural materials were preserved in an anaerobic freshwater environment. Finds at the site include well-preserved basketry. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989. One of the site's unusual features is a series of pits that were apparently used for leaching tannin from acorns. These pits, as well as associated features, including basketry weave patterns, bear resemblance to finds at other sites on the Pacific coast of North America, and in Japan, representing a rare direct connection between North American and Asian cultures. The site has been a site of interest to amateur collectors since at least the early 20th century, and came under further threat in the late 20th century by seepage from a nearby levee.

The area was also a traditional campsite of the Nez Perce and may be archaeologically significant. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1985, listed as Wallowa Lake Site.. It is a component of the Nez Perce National Historical Park. Setting The Old Chief Joseph Gravesite is located at the northern end of Wallowa Lake, on a site with commanding views of the lake and surrounding mountains. It is just south of Oregon Highway 351, from which an unpaved drive enters the property through a gateway in a stone wall. The main feature is a circular earthen platform, lined with a low stone retaining wall. At its center is the memorial marker to Old Chief Joseph, a mortared stone pillar, with a bronze relief of the chief's head on one side. Other features of the property include a flagpole, and the grave of an early white settler of the area. History Old Chief Joseph was the mid-19th century leader of the Wallowa band of the Nez Perce tribe, one of several that had refused to sign treaties in the 1850s and 1860s that would have forced them onto reservation land in Idaho. The Wallowa Lake area was part of the homeland of this band, and both Old Chief Joseph and his successor Chief Joseph, were steadfast in their refusal to abandon the land. When Old Joseph died in 1871, he had a traditional burial at the forks of the Lostine and Wallowa rivers.Nez Perce National Historic Park - Old Chief Joseph Gravesite The Wallowa band were famously forced off the land in the Nez Perce War in 1877. In 1886, Old Chief Joseph's grave was desecrated by local property owners and his skull was removed as a souvenir. In 1926, his grave was moved, with permission from the Nez Perce, to this location, and the stone marker was placed. In the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration funded work performed by members of the Nez Perce tribe to make a number of improvements, including the stone wall at the highway, and the retaining wall. The cemetery is a sacred place for the Nez Perce people, and is held in trust for them by the United States government.

Synthesis and structure  The protein is originally synthesised in an inactive 65 kDa proheparanase form in the golgi apparatus and transferred to late endosomes/lysosomes for transport to the cell-surface. In the lysosome it is proteolytically processed into its active form. Proteolytic processing results in the production of three products, * a linker peptide * an 8 kDa proheparanase fragment and * a 50 kDa proheparanase fragment The 8 kDa and 50 kDa fragments form a heterodimer and it is this heterodimer that constitutes the active heparanase molecule. The linker protein is so called because prior to its excision it physically links the 8 kDa and 50 kDa proheparanase fragments. Complete excision of the linker peptide appears to be a prerequisite to the complete activation of the heparanase enzyme. Crystal structures of both proheparanase and mature heparanase are available, showing that the linker peptide forms a large helical domain which blocks heparan sulfate molecules from interacting with heparanase. Removal of the linker reveals an extended cleft on the enzyme surface, which contains the heparanase active site.  Function  Heparanase has endoglycosidase activity and cleaves polymeric heparan sulfate molecules at sites which are internal within the polymeric chain. The enzyme degrades the heparan sulfate scaffold of the basement membrane and extracellular matrix. It is also associated with the inflammatory process, by allowing the extravasation of activated T lymphocytes. In ocular surface physiology this activity functions as an off/on switch for the prosecretory mitogen lacritin. Lacritin binds the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 only in the presence of active heparanase. Heparanase partially or completely cleaves heparan sulfate to expose a binding site in the N-terminal 50 amino acids of syndecan-1.  Clinical significance  The successful penetration of the endothelial cell layer that lines the interior surface of blood vessels is an important process in the formation of blood borne tumour metastases. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are major constituents of this layer and it has been shown that increased metastatic potential corresponds with increased heparanase activity for a number of cell lines. Due to the contribution of heparanase activity to metastasis and also to angiogenesis, the inhibition of heparanase activity it is considered to be a potential target for anti-cancer therapies. Heparanase has been shown to promote arterial thrombosis and stent thrombosis in mouse models due to the cleavage of anti-coagulant heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

A traditional \\"bed of nails\\" tester for testing a PCB requires a custom fixture to hold the PCBA and the Pogo pins which make contact with the PCBA. In contrast, FICT uses two or more flying probes, which may be moved based on software instruction. The flying probes are electro-mechanically controlled to access components on printed circuit assemblies (PCAs). The probes are moved around the board under test using an automatically operated two-axis system, and one or more test probes contact components of the board or test points on the printed circuit board. R. S. Khandpur, Printed Circuit Boards:Design, Fabrication, Assembly and Testing, Tata-McGraw Hill, , 2005, page 572 Flying probe testing is commonly used for test of analog components, analog signature analysis, and short/open circuits. They can be classified as in-circuit test (ICT) systems or as Manufacturing Defects Analyzers (MDAs). They provide an alternative to the bed-of-nails technique for contacting the components on printed circuit boards. The precision movement can probe points on integrated circuit packages without expensive fixturing or programming required. The main advantage of flying probe testing is the substantial cost of a bed-of-nails fixture, costing on the order of US $20,000, is not required. The flying probes also allow easy modification of the test fixture when the PCBA design changes. FICT may be used on both bare or assembled PCB's. However, since the tester makes measurements serially, instead of making many measurements at once, the test cycle may become much longer than for a bed-of-nails fixture. A test cycle that may take 30 seconds on such a system, may take an hour with flying probes. Test coverage may not be as comprehensive as a bed of nails tester (assuming similar net access for each), because fewer points are tested at one time. Alec Cohen, Prototype to Product: A Practical Guide for Getting to Market, O'Reilly, 2015, , pp. 83, 84 However, net access for traditional bed of nails testing is proving more challenging as board designs become more complex and compact. This often tilts the balance in favour of Flying Probe testing since these can use targets as small as 80um or 3.2mils for net access. Increasingly Flying Probe systems are being enhanced with multiple test techniques to achieve a very comprehensive \\"one stop\\" test strategy for circuit boards. Options such as laser test (used initially for board planarity correction, but now used for such tests as BGA planarity, no-fit component verification and component alignment testing) and automated optical inspection are now common. Flying probe systems can also be combined with bed of nails access on key nets (such as power supply nets) to add powered tests such as Boundary Scan, device programming and even full functional test capability.

Its trademark was renewed on March 17, 2005 by Mr. William R. Hansen, trademark correspondent. Funpals were traditionally advertised on television in addition to Working Mother magazine, which was a magazine intended for mothers who had to balance the pressure of the workforce with the pressures of motherhood. Summary Instead of merely having the cartoon or movie's logo, Funpals uses the characters from the movie or television show on the underpant. Example of characters used in Funpals are Jurassic Park, Bob the Builder, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Spider-Man, Batman (based on the general concept of the DC Comics superhero), Superman, Batman Begins (based on the 2005 American motion picture), Angry Birds, and Pok√©mon. In order to trim costs and improve profitability, all Funpals undergarments intended for sale in the Americas are manufactured in Latin American countries. Other places that manufacture Funpals briefs include Canada, Europe, and North Africa. Funpals come in the traditional briefs format only although modern boxer briefs for children have been inspired by both the more recent Underoos designs. Sizing for Funpals traditionally start at a \\"boys' small\\" (size 4) and ends at a \\"boys' large\\" or \\"boys' extra large.\\" Occasionally, some designs reach the maximum size at a \\"boys' triple- extra large\\" (equivalent to a men's medium or a size 32). These are designed for obese boys rather than adolescent males and adult men due to their juvenile design. While a petition was made to expand the Funpals line into sizes worn by adult males (and into designs based on adult male-oriented licensed properties), it has been unsuccessful. The female equivalent of Funpals are called FunGals; they come in fun designs like Dragon Tales, Bob the Builder (using the female characters), and Pok√©mon while carrying the traditional design of adult female panties. Fruit of the Loom manufactures Funpals underwear while Hanes manufactures Showtoons which directly competes with both Funpals and FunGals. Unlike Showtoons, Funpals shows its design with a giant print on the center of the undergarment. According to leading parenting manuals, Funpals and similar childish underwear are generally considered to be a bad idea for any child over the age of eight, owing to the added fun that a schoolyard bully acquires by giving a wedgie to a weaker boy who wears briefs with cartoons on them; a fact which almost inevitably leads to a chronic bullying problem.

Xavier Castellanos, M.D. (born November 16, 1953) is the Director of Research at the NYU Child Study Center. His work aims at elucidating the neuroscience of ADHD through structural and functional brain imaging studies, collaborating on molecular genetic studies, and coordinating an interdisciplinary network of translational investigators (the ADHD Neuroscience Network). Dr. Castellanos chaired the NIH ‚ÄòInitial Review Group‚Äô (Study Section) on Developmental Psychopathology and Developmental Disabilities from 2005‚Äì2007 and is chairing the revision of the diagnostic criteria for externalizing disorders for the forthcoming edition of DSM-V, projected for 2012. He continues to make significant contributions to research into the neurobiological substrates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Biography Francisco Xavier Castellanos was born in Madrid, Spain, on November 16, 1953, to Bolivian parents. When he was four, he, his mother and his two siblings returned to Bolivia, where they lived until he was nine, when the family moved to Washington, D.C. and a year later, to New Orleans, Louisiana. An avid reader, especially intrigued with science and math, he attended Catholic schools in New Orleans and later received a scholarship to Vassar College, where he became fascinated with the work of Noam Chomsky. At Vassar, he established an independent major in linguistics and graduated with honors in 1975. After graduation, working as a professional translator in New Orleans, during which time he translated Jean Piaget‚Äôs Epistemology and Psychology of Functions: Studies in Genetic Epistemology from French to English, Dr. Castellanos began work on a master‚Äôs degree in experimental psychology at The University of New Orleans, where he became fascinated by the discovery of endorphins. Following this interest, he applied to and was accepted at The Louisiana State University Medical College at Shreveport. After winning several awards, including the prestigious Chancellor‚Äôs Award for Overall Excellence and induction into AOA, the national medical honor society, he graduated in 1986 and continued his medical training at The University of Kentucky, where he was one of the first graduates of the \\"Triple Board\\" program in psychiatry, pediatrics and child psychiatry. During his residency, he won the Abraham Wikler, M.D. Award for Outstanding Psychiatry Resident and was awarded a mini-fellowship in the American Psychiatric Association's Program for Minority Research Training in Psychiatry. In 1991, Dr. Castellanos became a Research Fellow in the Child Psychiatry Branch of the National Institute of Mental Health, where he worked under the supervision of Dr. Judith L. Rapoport. As a senior staff fellow, he was the head of the ADHD Research Unit and received an award for Excellence in Clinical Care and Research from the National Institute of Mental Health. During this time he also became a fellow in the American Academy of Pediatrics. In 2001, he left the NIMH to assume the position of Director of Research Training at the New York University Child Study Center. Dr. Castellanos is the Brooke and Daniel Neidich Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine. He is also the Director of Research at the NYU Child Study Center and the Director of the Phyllis Green and Randolph C≈çwen Institute for Pediatric Neuroscience. He is board certified by the American Board of Pediatrics and the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology in general psychiatry.

Developed jointly by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) and ST Kinetics, it was commissioned on 28 October 2005. The Pegasus has replaced the GIAT LG1 105 mm howitzer previously in service with the Singapore Artillery. Design A SLWH Pegasus displayed at the Singapore Airshow 2008. The 155 mm, 39-caliber Pegasus is typically towed, but it is also equipped with an independent Lombardini 9LD625-2 engine unit to provide short-range self-propelled capability of up to 12 km/h (7 mph). It can be lifted by the Republic of Singapore Air Force's CH-47SD \\"Chinook\\" helicopter thus making it the first heli-portable self-propelled 155 mm howitzer. In addition, the Pegasus can also be transported by the C-130 Hercules tactical airlifter. The Pegasus has a burst rate of fire of three rounds in 24 seconds and a maximum rate of fire of four rounds per minute. It can deliver conventional munitions up to 19 km. Extended range munitions can be fired up to 30 km away. A semi-automatic loading system is provided to increase the rate of fire and reduce crew fatigue. The design of the Pegasus also incorporates several innovative elements. It is built with titanium alloy and aluminium alloy materials that are lightweight and yet able to withstand the recoil force of the 155 mm artillery system. Special recoil management design is also employed to reduce the recoil force to a third lower than conventional 155 mm howitzers. Deployment The Singapore Army conducted its first live firing of the SLWH Pegasus at the artillery range of Waiouru Army Camp in New Zealand as part of Exercise Thunder Warrior in January 2006. The SLWH Pegasus was the preferred candidate for the 145 ultra light howitzer program of the Indian Army. However, ST Kinetics was associated in a case of corruption against the Director General of Indian Ordnance Factory, and blacklisted from participating in the programme.http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=4164585&c;=ASI&s;=ALL Users *: Singapore Army (Primary user) See also *FH-88 *FH-2000 *SSPH Primus References ;Notes External links *Singapore Technologies official site *Projectile, 155 mm: AD/EXJAM, XM867E2, FIELD ARTILLERY *\\"Singapore Armed Forces Singapore Light Weight Howitzer Pegasus website.\\" Accessed on 20 November 2007. *\\"Defense Industry Daily ‚Äì Singapore Unveils New Air-Portable, Semi-Mobile 155 mm Pegasus Howitzer.\\" Accessed on 21 November 2007.

The by-election was triggered by the death of the sitting member, the Australian Labor Party's Greg Wilton on 14 June 2000. The writ for the by-election was issued on 30 June 2000. Background The Labor Party's member for Isaacs, Greg Wilton, committed suicide on 14 June 2000. Wilton's marriage had broken down earlier in the year, and shortly afterwards Victoria Police arrested Wilton after finding him, clearly distressed, with his children in a car in the You Yangs national park. While Wilton's intentions on the day were unclear, unrestrained media coverage of the incident was considered by his colleagues to have contributed to his eventual suicide six weeks later.Questions over MP's suicide, The 7.30 Report (ABC), 15 June 2000. The Isaacs by-election was the first election in Australia to be held after the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax on 1 July 2000, and the Liberal Party declined to run a candidate. Labor's preselection was a messy battle with the party's left faction proposing to pre-select Jill Hennessy, the former state president of the Labor Party and an advisor to Premier Steve Bracks. They were overridden by the party's federal executive, who put forward Ann Corcoran, although the change resulted in a convoluted factional deal in which pre-selection ballots were altered after their submission.Johnston, Nick: Labor tries to keep hold of seat after Wilton's suicide, Stateline (ABC), 21 July 2000. Results Aftermath The Labor Party held the seat of Isaacs, with a primary vote swing of 8.11 towards them. The lack of a Liberal candidate saw positive primary vote swings towards all the minor parties, in particular the Australian Democrats, the main rival on a two-candidate preferred basis. Ann Corcoran went on to hold the seat in the 2001 and 2004 federal elections, but lost pre-selection prior to the 2007 election.Green, Antony: Federal Election Guide 2007 - Isaacs, Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

Relationship to Coleridge After the death of his father in 1781, Coleridge attended Christ's Hospital, a boarding school in London. While in London, Coleridge befriended several boys at the school, including Tom Evans. During 1788 he and other friends visited Tom Evans' home in London, where he met Tom's eldest sister, Mary Evans. Coleridge became infatuated with Evans.

D., Litt. D. (May 5, 1864 ‚Äì July 28, 1949) was an American linguist, classics scholar and archaeologist responsible for the first American excavation in Greece and a founder of the Stanford University Classics department.  Early life  He was born in Ashland County, Ohio to agrarian parents. After receiving an M.A. from the University of Michigan in 1884, he requested further funding from his father to pursue studies in Germany. His father noted that he couldn't possibly see how anyone could ever need any more education but Miller moved to the University of Leipzig for doctoral studies from 1884-5. The next year he joined the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, Greece, where Professor Frederic de Forest Allen charged Miller with the first American excavation in Greece, seeking the stage of the Theater of Thorikos. 25-30 workmen were paid 1 drachma per day and total project budget was $300. While Miller did not consider it a success, later scholars found it significant in solving problems connected to the Greek stage. At the conclusion of the academic year, Miller set off on a walking tour he hoped would take him all the way to Istanbul, visiting archaeological sites along the way. He did not get beyond the further slope of one of the mountain ranges which encircle Athens. On only his second day out, he was robbed, beaten unconscious, and left for dead by two local villagers. The bloodied Miller managed to return to Athens to lodge a complaint with the local authorities. The authorities thereupon commissioned Miller as a captain in the Greek army, and sent him out with a posse to apprehend the criminals. A few days later the brigands were in jail. To his credit, Miller altered his testimony at their trial so the two would not be sentenced to death. They were, however, sentenced to ten years in a prison on the island of Aegina.  Start of career  Miller returned to the United States as an instructor of Greek at the University of Michigan during the 1886‚Äì87 school year and of Latin and Sanskrit in the 1887‚Äì88 year, beginning a fifty-year career as a college professor ‚Äì without ever returning to finish his doctoral degree. Walter Miller married Jennie Emerson, niece of Ralph Waldo Emerson, on September 13, 1888, in Racine, Wisconsin. Jennie Emerson Miller (August 7, 1860 ‚Äì March 1, 1946) had studied Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, French, German and science and was an invaluable assistant to her husband. By 1889 Walter Miller was an acting assistant professor at Michigan, but the family returned to Leipzig for the next two years and daughters Edith and Marjorie were born in Germany. He worked as the senior at the Royal Archaeological Seminary at the University of Leipzig from 1890 to 1891. The family returned to Columbia, Missouri, when he accepted a position as an associate professor of Greek at the University of Missouri for the 1891‚Äì92 school year. In the fall of 1891, Miller received both a letter and a telegram from Stanford University President David Starr Jordan offering him a position with the newly formed Classics Department. A quick discussion with the executive committee of the Missouri Board of Curators resulted in a promotion in both rank and salary, with the promise of a full professorship of archaeology the next academic year.Stanford University Department of Special Collections, David Starr Jordan papers, SC058 (box 2 folder 15) Nonetheless, in 1892 he was appointed professor of Latin and archaeology at Stanford University. Miller, his wife Jennie and his two daughters Edith and Marjorie built a house at 2275 Amherst Street in the College Terrace neighborhood of Palo Alto, California. For the next ten years he served Stanford, as professor of archaeology (1894‚Äì96), professor of classical philology (1896‚Äì1902) and also as secretary of the faculty from 1897 to 1901. With differing views from the departmental administration on the future of the classics department, and determined to continue publishing, he voluntarily resigned in 1902.Stanford University Department of Special Collections, Faculty Publications, 2499 Correspondence with President Jordan indicates an amicable departure.Stanford University Department of Special Collections, David Starr Jordan Papers, SC058 (box 31 folder 308) As professor of Greek, and later philology at the Tulane University, he began his administrative experience, becoming dean of the graduate school and later dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. At the same time his editorial endeavors began, with the Southern Educational Review and later the Classical Journal. Miller typically traveled alone over summer term vacations while Jennie stayed at home and with the two daughters. In the summer of 1910 he was in the Grecian Isles aboard the yacht Athena, lecturing for the Society of University Travel. Jennie, elder daughter Edith and younger daughter Marjorie were visiting the Tallulah River in North Georgia as they did each summer to escape the New Orleans heat. On the evening of May 29, near the town of Tallulah Falls, Marjorie (a strong swimmer) was swept away by the current and drowned. Her father had just set sail from Naples and was notified by a cablegram that said simply \\"COME HOME AT ONCE.\\" The body was recovered days later and Miller notified of the tragedy only upon his arrival in New York. Funeral services were held in Atlanta on September 3 and the burial was at sea (according to her wishes) on September 29. In 1911 he returned to the University of Missouri as professor of Latin and in 1929 became professor of classical languages and archaeology. From 1914 to 1930 he was the dean of the Graduate School at the University of Missouri and during World War I served in the YMCA in France and was a regional director of the YMCA in Italy. In his 1919 commencement address Missouri Commencement, April 23, 1919 he called for the creation of a Memorial Student Union building to honor the fallen of World War I. In September 1932, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters by his alma mater the University of Michigan, and he retired to his home at 1516 Wilson Avenue in Columbia, Missouri, in 1936. After his retirement, he taught at Southwestern in Memphis and also Washington University in St. Louis.  Later years  In 1944 in his capacity as a professor emeritus at Missouri and at age 80, he completed the translation of Homer's Iliad in the English equivalent of the Greek poet's original dactylic hexameter. It was the first such work ever published. Begun by Tulane colleague William Benjamin Smith this work was hailed as a \\"triumph of ingenuity.\\" Five years later Miller died in Columbia, Missouri, one of the last of his generation of U.S classicists. The Walter Miller Library in the Department of Classical Studies and the Walter Miller Fellowship endure to this day. Jennie was a charter member of the Beta chapter of the Gamma Phi Beta social sorority at the University of Michigan in 1882, and in 1921 a founder of the Alpha Delta chapter at the University of Missouri.

Early speculation made him a scion of the Counts of Toulouse,Serrano y Sans, 127;del Arco y Garay, 359 but he is certainly the \\"Count Raymond, son of Count Lupus ... in the country of Pallars\\" (Regimundo comite, filio Luponi comiti ... in pago Paliarensi) of a 920 document.d'Abadal y de Vinyals, I: 351 His father may have been the Basque count Lupus I of Bigorre.d'Abadal y de Vinyals, I: 121 During his lifetime Pallars represented the easternmost extent of the Basque language.Lewis, 112 n104.  Rise to power  Raymond was a local nobleman who in the aftermath of the assassination of Bernard II of Toulouse by partisans of Bernard Plantapilosa (872) seized authority for himself in Pallars and Ribagorza.Lewis, 110. The exact circumstances surrounding his rise are obscure, but he had probably held lands south of the Pyrenees from the County of Toulouse prior to gaining independence.Lewis, 112. Neither is it clear what part the leading men of the regions played in his elevation, but after the fact Pallars and Ribagorza were not even nominally attached to Francia.Lewis, 110.  Rule  Raymond immediately made overtures of peace and alliance with the Banu Qasi governors of Huesca and Zaragoza, in 884 even purchasing Zaragoza, only to have it immediately reconquered by the Caliphate. In the end, a policy of Reconquista had to be adopted. Consequentially, his reign saw the encastellation of Pallars of Ribagorza and the proliferation of turres (defensive towers).Lewis, 131-132. Castles were built at Leovalles, Castellous, and Lemignano.Lewis, 229-230. Raymond also consolidated his de facto independence from any superior authority by creating a new diocese of Pallars, enabling himself to control the local church. Raymond also established an alliance with the Jim√©nez dynasty of Navarre. He married his sister Dadildis to Garc√≠a Jim√©nez of Pamplona, and in 905 he collaborated with Alfonso III of Asturias and Abd Allah ibn Lubb ibn Qasi in a coup that unseated Fort√∫n Garc√©s of Pamplona in favor of Raymond's nephew, Sancho Garc√©s I.P√©rez de Urbel, 297  Later years  In 904 he was attacked by Lubb ibn Muhammad ibn Qasi, who took 700 prisoners, including Raymond's son and heir Isarn. He lost much of Ribagorza, including Roda and Montpedr√≥s, to Muhammad al-Tawil of Huesca in 907 and thereafter ruled mainly just Pallars, which had always been his political base. His wife may be the Giniguentes, daughter of Aznar Dat, mentioned in the C√≥dice de Roda, but the text is ambiguous and probably refers to the wife of his son, Isarn.Lacarra, 234. In concluding a paragraph that describes both Raymond and Isarn, the Codex relates that \\"This [man] married Giniguentes, daughter of Aznat Dat,\\" and could be referring to either father or son, though the author had left the name of Raymond's wife blank earlier in the paragraph, suggesting this statement refers to Isarn. Isarn had a documented wife, Senegundia, perhaps representing the same name as Giniguentes. Pallars was inherited by his two youngest sons, Isarn and Llop, while mostly-overrun Ribagorza went to his two eldest, Miro and Bernard Unifred. Another son of Raymond was Ato, Bishop of Pallars, who appears as brother of both Bernard and Isarn in contemporary documents. Notes Sources *d'Abadal i de Vinyals, Ramon.

It was established to administer portions of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Its mission is to provide leadership and resources to assist state and other agencies in providing vocational rehabilitation (VR) and other services to individuals with disabilities to maximize their employment, independence and integration into the community and the competitive labor market. RSA is charged with: administering formula and discretionary grant programs authorized by Congress; evaluating, monitoring, and reporting on the implementation of Federal policy and programs and the effectiveness of vocational rehabilitation, supported employment, and other related programs for individuals with disabilities; coordinating with other Federal agencies, State agencies, and the private sector including professional organizations, service providers, and organizations of persons with disabilities for the review of program planning, implementation, and monitoring issues. RSA provides national leadership for, and administration of: basic state and formula grant programs‚Äîincluding grants to state vocational rehabilitation agencies --, rehabilitation training discretionary grant programs, Randolph‚ÄìSheppard Act vending facilities, and Helen Keller National Center (CITE) programs. The grant programs under the RSA's purview are in various areas such as technical assistance centers, demonstration projects, training, client advocacy, and underserved populations. The largest program the RSA manages is the State Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program, which mainly assists in engage in gainful employment. If a state is unable to serve all disabled individuals, priority is given to individuals with the most significant disabilities. History Prior to the establishment of the RSA, the passage of legislation played a key role in laying the groundwork for the federal and state partnership. The Smith-Hughes Act in 1917 helped to establish the Federal Board for Vocational Education, which would later regulate the veteran and civilian vocational rehabilitation programs. Coinciding with World War I, The Federal Board for Vocational Education oversaw a vocational rehabilitation program for disabled veterans under the Soldier's Rehabilitation Act of 1918. In 1920, the Smith-Fess Act (the Civilian Vocational Rehabilitation Act) expanded the purview of the Federal Board for Vocational Rehabilitation to oversee a civilian vocational rehabilitation program to be funded on a 50-50 matching basis with the states. Congress would need to periodically vote to extend funding because it was not permanent at this time. The Randolph‚ÄìSheppard Act in 1936 and the Wagner-O'Day Act in 1938 helped to prioritize employment of visually impaired individuals to operate vending stands in federal buildings, and required federal agencies to buy certain products from nonprofit organizations that employed people who are blind, respectively. These acts gave way to the establishment of the National Industries for the Blind. The National Industries for the Blind employed blind Americans who made and sold products under the business name Skilcraft. Vocational Rehabilitation Act Amendments In 1954, Public Law 565 increased the 50-50 matched funding from the federal government to 3 federal dollars for every 2 state dollars, and expanded services to those with intellectual disabilities. The Act authorized grants for research and educational training for rehabilitation counselors-to-be in universities. As the Director of the U.S. Office of Vocational Rehabilitation, Mary Switzer released funds for more than 100 university-based rehabilitation-related programs and was a strong advocate for improving quality of life for people with disabilities. In 1965, Public Law 89-333 expanded federal funding to a 75-25 ratio. It also removed economic need as a requirement for services. In 1972 the first versions of the Rehabilitation Act were passed by Congress, but vetoed by President Richard Nixon - once in October 1972 and then again in March 1973. President Nixon eventually signed the bill, called the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and sponsored by Representative John Brademas, into law on September 26, 1973. One of the key pieces in the law is Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act that says ‚Äúno otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States shall solely on the basis of his handicap, be excluded from the participation, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.‚Äù This means that any organization or program that receives federal funding cannot discriminate against disabled individuals. One of the main purposes of the Act is to provide a statutory basis for the Rehabilitation Services Administration, who helps to develop and maintain federal regulations for individuals with disabilities and their families to help them find jobs and live independently. The RSA is the main agency responsible for carrying out Titles I (Vocational Rehabilitation Services), III (Professional Development and Special Projects and Demonstrations ), VI (Employment Opportunities for Individuals with Disabilities) and VII (Independent Living Services and Centers for Independent Living), as well as specified portions of Title V (Rights and Advocacy) of the Rehabilitation Act. The Rehabilitation Act continued to evolve; in 1986, Public Law 99-506 helped it to refine and focus services offered to those with the most severe disabilities. Supported employment was also defined as a ‚Äúlegitimate rehabilitation outcome‚Äù. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 helped to influence additional legislation like the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. In 1998, the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) impacted programs like the RSA, and according to RSA's website, was intended to strengthen and improve the nation's public workforce development system and help Americans with significant barriers to employment, including individuals with disabilities, into high quality jobs and careers and help employers hire and retain skilled workers. In 2014, the Workforce Innovation & Opportunity Act (WIOA) was signed into law and amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Additionally, WIOA also introduced Pre-Employment Transition Services for high school youth, aged 14‚Äì21, to teach 5 cores services. These services are: Job Exploration Counseling, Counseling on Post Secondary Educational Opportunities, Self Advocacy, Workplace Readiness and Work based Learning Experiences. Title IV of WIOA amended title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Under the WIOA, the Governor of each State or Territory must submit a Unified or Combined State Plan to the U.S. Department of Labor that outlines a four-year strategy for the State's workforce development system. Each state's four-year plan is available on the RSA's website and requires many governmental agencies to work together to review and approve the states‚Äô plans.

The group formed in the late 1960s in the midst of the Texas funk scene, which consisted mostly of locally and regionally known bands but which was extraordinarily prolific (and known today mostly through hip hop sampling and reissues on labels such as Jazzman Records). History Mickey Foster and Emil Carter first played together in a Latino soul group called The Royal Tokens. The two split from the group to form a new band; picking up George Salas and Gilbert Rivera, they called themselves \\"The Fabulous Four\\". After further lineup changes, the group became \\"The Fabulous Five\\", \\"Mickey and the Fabulous Five\\" and lastly \\"Mickey and the Soul Generation\\". The group won several local talent shows and began recording in a local Tejano studio. Their 1969 single, \\"Iron Leg\\", was picked up for distribution nationwide by Maxwell Records, a New York City label, and the 45 sold well regionally in Florida, California, and Texas. At the height of its popularity, it was used in a segment by Nipsey Russell on a routine he did for The Tonight Show.Josh Davis. Liner Notes, Iron Leg. Cali-Tex, 2002, passim. After the release of a second single, \\"Football\\", the group went on tour, opening for Sam & Dave, The Supremes, Clarence Carter, and Kool & the Gang in the American South and Midwest. After moving to New York to fill an opening slot for fellow Maxwell artists Faith, Hope & Charity, the group split with its label over monetary disputes and returned to Texas. Further recording ensued at local studios, but the group soon splintered, recording its last singles in 1973. Mickey & the Soul Generation saw little widespread success while active as a band. However, the group became better known when Josh Davis (DJ Shadow) began interpolating their music into his records and mixes. Davis, who called the group his 'favorite funk band', collected the group's recordings and had them reissued on Cali-Tex records in 2002 in the double LP and double CD formats.

Reception Whereas the film can be seen as belonging to the tradition of the \\"cinema of prose,\\" it also contributes to the \\"cinema of poetry,\\" as defined by Pier Paolo Pasolini. \\"In fulfilling his duty of messenger of a messenger, as said before, Rosi is very assertive and didactic. In the second half of the film, in fact, in a series of short scenes, many issues related to the Holocaust are treated and apparently exhausted in a very simplistic way. ... A scene that could be qualified as a moment of Pasolinian Cinema of Poetry is the scene in which the Italian survivors watch through a window the Russian family who gave them food to eat. Uncertain about their journey and about the fate of their own families, in this scene through the deforming glasses of a window this family appears like an unreachable mirage. The deformation and the color of these images tell us about the feelings and desires of these Italian men much more than they could explain with words by themselves.\\" Brian Webster, writing for the Apollo Guide, finds the film \\"a war story with little violence and virtually no sentimentality. If you're not ready for it, you might find The Truce passing before your eyes without making much of an impact. It doesn't smack you in the face with a powerful message, but instead works its way inside you more gradually.\\"Bruce Webster, \\"Truce, The,\\" Apollo Guide References External links * 1997 films 1997 drama films Italian films Italian drama films Films about Jews and Judaism Films about the aftermath of the Holocaust Films based on works by Primo Levi Films set in Poland Films directed by Francesco Rosi Films scored by Luis Bacalov Jews and Judaism in Italy Aftermath of World War II in the Soviet Union and Russia Latin-language films Aftermath of World War II in Poland 1945 in Poland 1945 in the Soviet Union Jewish refugees Italian refugees Displaced persons camps in the aftermath of World War II World War II films based on actual events Eastern Front of World War II films ","title":"The Truce (1997 film)"},{"id":"14326981","text":"Buronga is a town in Sudan.

The Assembly approved the new Political Constitution of the State on 9 December 2007. It was put to a national referendum held on 25 January 2009, and went into force on 7 February 2009. Disputes over the content of this text and procedures of its approval aggravated political conflict in Bolivia, including violent conflicts in Sucre and Cochabamba. Opposition and conservative sectors including the \\"media luna\\" denounced the text claiming the procedure of its passage was illegal, passed with a third of constituent delegates absent (from minority conservative parties). Despite inclusive wording of the text, opponents have claimed the new document only represents indigenous peoples, discriminating against mixed (mestizo), white (European) populations.Bolivia: Three Dead in Capital Conflict, Andean Information Network Prior Constituent Assemblies, or other bodies empowered with rewriting Bolivia's Constitution have taken place on at least 17 occasions since 1826.Rossana Barrag√°n, \\"Ciudadan√≠a y elecciones, convenciones y debates\\" in Process and structure of deliberations The Constituent Assembly was authorized by Law 3091, promulgated by President Eduardo Rodr√≠guez Veltze on 6 July 2005, and by the Convocation Law of the Constituent Assembly (Law 3364), approved by Bolivia's National Congress on 3 March 2006. The latter law designated uninominal elections by the 70 districts used by the Chamber of Deputies, and plurinominal elections of five constituents from each department. Conflicts and controversies =Two-thirds vote= The Convocation Law required a two- thirds vote of the Assembly to approve the new Constitution. Debates over the specific interpretation of this provision occupied the Assembly from November 2006 to 14 February 2007. In drafting the regulations for the Assembly, the MAS proposed a simple majority vote should be required for most matters, with two-thirds required for sensitive matters. An initial regulation was passed on 17 November 2006 requiring a two-thirds majority votes only for the final text of the Constitution, and allowing reconsideration of up to three articles in which at least one-third of the Assembly proposed an alternative text. In mid- December, cabildos held in the media luna departments of Santa Cruz, Tarija, Beni and Pando threatened to refuse to abide by a constitution that was not approved by a two-thirds vote. Cochabamba prefect Manfred Reyes Villa also backed the two-thirds majority position in a pro-autonomy cabildo held on 15 December 2006, further sharpening the divisions that led to the January 2007 violence. On 24 January 2007 the Bolivian Senate broke a deadlock and elected Jose Villavicencio (the lone Senator of the National Unity Party) as its president by a 15-12 vote, unseating a close ally of Morales. With the loss of control of the Senate, Morales has backed down from his position that a simple majority of assembly members should determine the wording of individual articles in the new Constitution. As a compromise measure, Morales called for any issue that can not be resolved with a two-thirds vote in the Constituent Assembly should be put before the people in a referendum, saying \\"Let the people decide with their vote, without fear.\\" The head of Podemos, former President Jorge Quiroga, praised Morales' suggestion, saying \\"It's an important advance. It's a sign of flexibility.\\" Retrieved on Feb 1, 2007 After months of negotiations, on 8 February 2007 MAS announced that with the support of 18 members of the Podemos that they had reached the necessary consensus on the Assembly's voting procedures. Retrieved on Feb 8, 2007 The Assembly approved its regulations on 14 February 2007 with an overwhelming vote of 201 constituents (81%). The final rules required an absolute majority for the text overall, and a 2/3 vote in considering individual articles. Failure to achieve two-thirds would result in a Concertation commission to seek a new text; irreconciliable differencecs would be considered by popular referendum. =Capital status of Sucre= Sucre, the seat of the Assembly, was the country's sole capital prior to the 1899 civil war. In 2007, politicians from Sucre sought to re-establish Sucre as the sole capital and transfer all parts of the national government to the city. The Inter-Institutional Committee of the Interests of Chuquisaca was established in March 2007 for this purpose, and a proposal was presented to the Assembly's Regional Encuentro held in Sucre on 19 March. Marches were held in support of this demand on 10 March and 25 July, while an opposing mobilization was held in La Paz and El Alto on 20 July. Assembly members from La Paz threatened in July to abandon the plenary sessions if the issue was discussed, but Chuquisaca and media luna members inserted the issue in the minority reports of six commissions and the majority report of one. On 15 August, a MAS-sponsored resolution excluded the issue from being considered in plenary session. The following day the Inter- Institutional Committee began a civic strike and, on 17 August, an open cabildo called for consideration of the issue. Seven Chuquisaque√±o assembly members began a hunger strike in support of full capital status. On 23 August, the conflict escalated with mass attacks on the headquarters of MAS-affiliated social movements in Sucre and on Assembly member Ignacio Mendoza (MAS, Chuquisaca), leading to the suspension of further plenary sessions. The 15 August resolution preventing discussion was annulled by court order on 8 September. The issue continued to occupy the Assembly in September and October until a multi-party accord was reached on 24 October, formally ratifying Sucre as constitutional capital and the seat of the judicial and electoral branches of government with honorary sessions of the legislature also held there. However, the Inter-Institutional Committee rejected this agreement as well. Its mobilizations against the Assembly continued through the rest of the body's meetings. Approval of new Political Constitution of the State On November 24, 2007 the Constituent Assembly approved a preliminary draft of the constitution in full. MAS and its allies have claimed the opposition boycotted the final stages of the Assembly vote and incited violent student protests against the assembly, forcing its move to a military school on the outskirts of the city for protection. On December 8, 2007 the Constituent Assembly moved its sessions to Oruro, citing safety concerns. Most members of opposition parties boycotted the meeting. 165 of the 255 delegates attended and participated in the voting. The final draft constitution was approved article by article in a marathon voting session through the night, completing approval of the draft on December 9, 2007. It was synthesized, cleaned up, and modified by an Editing Commission in La Paz. Leaders of several opposition parties and conservative civic committees in 5 departments stated they will not recognize the new text, claiming it was approved illegally. On December 14, 2007 the President of the Constituent Assembly, Silvia Lazarte and members of the Directory Panel presented the complete text to the Bolivian National Congress to legislate a referendum. The following day marches and rallies were held in the capital La Paz in favor of the new Constitution while in the departmental capital of Santa Cruz rallies were held in favor of an extra-constitutional \\"Autonomy Statute.\\" The constitution was further modified by the Cochabamba Dialogue between the President and opposition Prefects in September 2008; and in Congress during negotiations for a referendum in October 2008. On October 23, 2008, the Bolivian Congress approved holding a referendum on a new constitution supported by President Morales to empower the allegedly long oppressed indigenous majority of the country. The referendum took take place on 25 January 2009. With a 61.7% majority, the constitution came into effect on February 7.

The storms produced strong winds, flash flooding and large hailstones in the region, including the capital city of Brisbane. The storms also spawned two of the most powerful tornadoes recorded in Australia, including the only Australian tornado to be given an official 'F4' classification on the Fujita scale.Whitaker (2005), 199.Coenraads (2005), 229. The meteorological instability in the region resulted in the formation of at least five supercell thunderstorms in the space of around three hours. The storms, which spawned progressively further up the coast from Brisbane to Gladstone as the afternoon progressed, left a trail of damage resulting from hail, rain and wind. The event has been described as \\"one of the most widespread outbreaks of severe thunderstorms recorded\\" by veteran meteorologist Richard Whitaker.Davies et al. (1992).Whitaker (2005), 200. Climatology and conditions November is traditionally the start of the thunderstorm season along the eastern seaboard of Australia, with a rise in average humidity and warmer ground temperatures combining with more frequent occurrences of cool air in the upper atmosphere. These conditions are conducive for producing severe thunderstorms, particularly those which feature hail.Whitaker (2005), 195. The conditions on Sunday, 29 November were extremely unsettled. There were a series of thunderstorm cells that formed early in the morning ‚Äî despite it being more common for thunderstorms to form in the late afternoon in the south-east Queensland region. These storms, which had periodic bursts of severe lightning, cleared quickly.Chambers (n.d.). Thunderstorms began to form again just before midday, as the hot and humid conditions became more acute in the middle part of the day. The Bureau of Meteorology radar picked up a series of cells to the north-west of Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, and the data suggested that there was a possibility of large hail. The Bureau immediately issued a Severe Thunderstorm Warning for the coastal region between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, 100 km to the north.Whitaker (2005), 196. The main cell in the thunderstorm system appeared from Bureau of Meteorology radar analysis to split into two separate and distinct cells. This development resulted in one part of the major storm to head north, to Maroochydore, while the other part headed south towards Brisbane. The southern cell struck Brisbane just after 1:00pm, with intense lightning activity and hailstones the size of marbles falling. The storm caused a lengthy delay during the First Test of the series between Australia and the West Indies, when hail forced play to be stopped at the Brisbane Cricket Ground around 1:15pm.Whitaker (2005), 197. The northern cell continued to intensify throughout the afternoon. The Bureau of Meteorology then recognised it as a supercell, which often bring erratic developments and often last for long periods of time. The storm dropped hailstones which were between eight and ten centimeters around Maroochydore, on the Sunshine Coast, damaging the roofs of around 80 houses in the area. The hail also damaged aircraft at a local airport and dented cars, as well as inflicting injuries to a handful of swimmers at beaches near Maroochydore.Whitaker (2005), 198. Tornadoes The tornado near Bucca The extreme instability in this area caused at least three more severe supercells in the region. Two separate cells both produced a tornado that were recorded as two of the most powerful in Australian history. The third supercell, which formed just after 3:00pm (immediately after the two tornadoes) near Gladstone, produced golf ball-sized hail that caused crop damage around Gladstone.Coenraads (2005), 228. The total damage to crops from the event was placed in the millions (A$).Bureau of Meteorology (2007). =Oakhurst tornado= Early in the afternoon, another supercell developed around the town of Maryborough, around 300 km north of Brisbane. It developed rapidly also, and at 2:30pm a number of reports sent to the Bureau of Meteorology reported a tornado had touched down in Oakhurst, a rural area 10 km west of Maryborough. However, due to the low population density in the area the reported damage was sparse, with one house destroyed, several others unroofed and hundreds of trees were snapped. Upon investigation and analysis of measurements and the damage caused by the tornado, it was given a rating of 'F3' on the Fujita scale. This was one of the most powerful tornadoes ever recorded in Australia, and the scale indicated the tornado may have produced winds of between 252 and 300 kilometres per hour. =Bucca tornado= Only minutes after the Oakhurst tornado, another supercell developed to the south-west of Bundaberg, around 400 km north of Brisbane and 150 km north of the Oakhurst tornado. It strengthened and moved in a north-east direction, causing severe damage to Bullyard and Bucca areas with giant hailstones, described as the size of a \\"cricket ball\\". The supercell then spawned a tornado in the Bucca and Kolan area. According to reports by meteorologists, the tornado was so strong and the effects caused on the area it hit were so extreme that household appliances were displaced, small objects were embedded in trees and house walls, and \\"a 3-tonne truck body was carried 300 metres across the ground\\". However, as with Oakhurst, the rural nature of the area affected limited the damage caused by the tornado. Examination by a severe weather team from the Bureau of Meteorology examined the damage in the Bucca and Kolan region and recorded it as an 'F4' on the Fujita scale. This corresponds to the tornado being able to produce winds between 331 and 417 kilometres per hour and of 'devastating' intensity. This is the first tornado ever to be recorded as an F4 in Australian history.

It is approximately west of Molino and a few miles from the Perdido River. It is a rural community of low hills, farms, creeks and woods. Barrineau Park is part of the Pensacola-Ferry Pass-Brent Metropolitan Statistical Area. History It was named after William Capers Barrineau of South Carolina, who moved there in 1900 and bought over of land for turpentine and timber. After the timber supply was exhausted, he brought in about 50 families, (mostly German Hungarians), to farm the land in intensive small truck farms that actively produced vegetables for the market.Dolly Pollard and History of Escambia County - Armstrong, Henry Clay, 1870-1930 From the Book History of Escambia County Armstrong, Henry Clay, 1870-1930 pg 150. \\"Mr W.C. Barrineau also has made one of the biggest contributions to the county in the colony of industries Germans at Barrineau Park\\" =St. Elizabeth Catholic Church= Barrineau Park was colonized by the German Hungarians / Donauschwabens who farmed the land. These colonizers were excellent farmers and industrious people; most were devout Catholics. In 1923, they built St. Elizabeth Catholic Church. During these years, Barrineau Park had a post office, railway station and stores. The forest reclaimed most of these structures and the community dwindled to a scattering of farms and homes until approximately the 1980s, when people started settling small farms in the area. =St Elizabeth's Catholic Cemetery= St Elizabeth's Catholic Cemetery is approximately from U.S. Route 29 on the Barrineau Park Road, due west. It is next to the church and approximately square. The settlement of Hungarian Germans came into Escambia County circa 1913, many from the Chicago and St. Louis areas. The cemetery is better kept and better marked than most in the county. The church was built circa 1922. There is also a parish house. The cemetery includes several Austrians, Hungarians and Donauschwabens, mostly of German descent. There are approximately 20 unmarked graves.Author: Bruington, Lola Lee Daniell =Slave Cemetery= There is also an unmarked slave graveyard in Barrineau Park. US 29 North to State Road 97.

It was the first four-engined aircraft designed and built in the United States. Ten examples were built, but they only entered limited commercial service; their high cost and problems with the cooling of the after engines proved prohibitive. The United States Army Air Corps evaluated the F-32 as the YC-20, but did not purchase it. Crash The first F-32 crashed on November 27, 1929, during a demonstration of a three-engined takeoff from Roosevelt Field on Long Island, New York. One of the two port engines was stopped, but the other failed shortly after takeoff, causing a loss of control. The aircraft came down on a house in nearby Carle Place, and was totally destroyed in the crash and subsequent fire; remarkably, nobody was killed, although the pilot and a passenger were injured. This crash was witnessed by famous American poet Ogden Nash, who wrote of it to his then-fianc√©e Frances (later his wife). Nash's account is found in Loving Letters from Ogden Nash: A Family Album, edited by Linell Nash Smith (Nash's daughter). Power issues The crash displayed the F-32's most notable problem; it was underpowered, which was made worse by the aircraft's back-to-back engine configuration, with an engine on each end of the underwing nacelles. The front engine powered a two-bladed propeller and the rear engine a three-bladed one. The after propellers, working in the disturbed air from the front, were inefficient, and the rear engines suffered from cooling problems. The underpowering problem was partially solved by replacing the prototype's Pratt & Whitney Wasp engines with more powerful Pratt & Whitney R-1860 Hornet Bs on later planes, but the other issues remained with the planes throughout their short service lives. Orders Initially, Western Air Express and Universal Air Lines each ordered five aircraft, and there was interest from other airlines, including KLM (Royal Dutch Airlines). However, despite the painting of a prototype for Universal, they cancelled their order, and WAE only picked up two instead of the planned five, largely because of the Great Depression. Service with Western Air Express Western Air Express were the only purchasers of the F-32, buying two of them. They operated out of Alhambra Airport in Alhambra, California and later Grand Central Air Terminal in Glendale, California, flying to Oakland International Airport (Oakland, California) and other West Coast destinations. U.S. Army Air Corps trial In 1930, the U.S. Army Air Corps borrowed an F-32 for testing, designating it YC-20. Just as with the Boeing Y1C-18, the aircraft remained the property of the manufacturer and was returned after testing. It was the largest transport aircraft tested by the USAAC, at the time, and would remain so until the late 1930s.

Tospoviruses take their name from the type species tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus (TSWV) which was discovered in Australia in 1919. The type species remained the only member of the family until the early 1990s when genetic characterisation of plant viruses became more common. There are now at least twenty species in the genus with more being discovered on a regular basis. Member viruses infect over eight hundred plant species from 82 different families. Genome Tospoviruses have a negative-sense, single-strand RNA genome. The genome resembles that of the genus Phlebovirus. It is linear and is 17.2 kb in size. It is divided into three segments termed S (2.9kb), M (5.4kb), and L (8.9kb). The M and S RNA segments encode for proteins in an ambisense direction. Transmission Tospoviruses are arboviruses usually vectored by thrips. At least ten species of thrips belonging to family Thripidae have been confirmed as vectors for the transmission of thirteen or more tospoviruses.Jones, D. R. 2005. Plant viruses transmitted by thrips. European Journal of Plant Pathology 113: 119‚Äì157. The thrips vectors are not closely related, implying an independent origin of infection for each thrips,Mound, L. A. 2002. So many thrips ‚Äì so few tospoviruses?, pp. 15 - 18. In L. A. Mound and R. Marullo [eds.], Thrips and Tospoviruses: Proceedings of the 7th International Symposium on Thysanoptera. CSIRO Entomology, Reggio Calabria, Italy. possibly transmitted horizontally through shared hosts. There may be other species of thrips competent to transmit similar viruses, but they have not been documented on crops of economic significance. Recent research concludes that thrips can only be infected by tospovirus during the larval phases of development, as pupation and metamorphosis separate the connection between the salivary glands and the infected muscle tissue of the mid- gut.Moritz, G., S. Kumm, and L. A. Mound. 2004. Tospovirus transmission depends on thrips ontogeny. Virus research 100: 143‚Äì149. Adults transmit the virus from infected salivary glands, and uninfected adults will not transmit the virus. Obviously, controlling the infection by limiting transmission from infected plants to larval thrips or by preventing adult dispersal from infected plants are key strategies in preventing an epidemic of the disease.Groves, R. L., J. F. Walgenbach, J. W. Moyer, and G. G. Kennedy. 2003. Seasonal Dispersal Patterns of Frankliniella fusca (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) and Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus Occurrence in Central and Eastern North Carolina. Journal of Economic Entomology 96: 1 - 11.Nault, B. A., J. Speese III, D. Jolly, and R. L. Groves. 2003. Seasonal patterns of adult thrips dispersal and implications for management in eastern Virginia tomato fields. Crop Protection 22: 505‚Äì512. Agricultural importance Infection with these viruses results in spotting and wilting of the plant, reduced vegetative output, and eventually death. No antiviral cures have been developed for plants infected with a Tospovirus, and infected plants should be removed from a field and destroyed in order to prevent the spread of the disease. A large number of plant families are known to be affected by viruses of the Tospovirus genus. These include both food crops (such as peanuts, watermelons, capsicums, tomatoes, zucchinis, et al.) as well as ornamental species which are important to flower farms (calla lily, impatiens, chrysanthemums, iris, et al.). For a more complete list of hosts examine the Tospovirus host list at Kansas State University. Diagnosis Pepper infected with Tomato spotted wilt virus. Plant of Pimiento L sweet pepper.Early symptoms of infection are difficult to diagnose. In young infected plants the characteristic symptoms consist of inward cupping of leaves and leaves that develop a bronze cast followed by dark spots. As the infection progresses additional symptoms develop which include dark streaks on the main stem and wilting of the top portion of the plant. Fruit may be deformed, show uneven ripening and often have raised bumps on the surface. Once a plant becomes infected the disease cannot be controlled. Serological and molecular tests are commercially available to diagnose TSWV as well as a second common tospovirus found in ornamentals, Impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV). Cytological studies of TSWV and INSV have shown that these viruses produce granular inclusions in the cytoplasm of infected plants. These inclusions can be seen in the light microscope with proper staining techniques. These inclusions can be diagnostic. Epidemiology Tospoviruses are prevalent in warm climates in regions with a high population of thrips. For instance TSWV is an agricultural pest in Asia, America, Europe and Africa. Over the past 15 years outbreaks of Tomato spotted wilt disease have become more prevalent in these regions. Therefore, TSWV is described as an emerging viral disease of plants. The increased prevalence is largely because of the successful survival of the thrips vector Frankliniella occidentalis. Another thrips, Scirtothrips dorsalis, has also been implicated in the transmission of at least three tospoviruses, but there remains some controversy over its efficiency as a vector.Whitfield AE, Ullman DE, German TL (2005). Tospovirus-thrips interactions. Annual Review of Phytopathology. 43: 459‚Äì89. Immunological testing and vector-competence studies suggest that S. dorsalis may represents a non-transmitting carrier for some strains of virus. The success of this virus has also been attributed to the acquisition of a gene in the M segment of the genome which encodes a movement protein. This protein allows the virus to infect a wide range of hosts. The gene encoding this protein was likely acquired by recombination from either a plant host or from another plant virus. Management Control of these diseases is difficult. One of the reasons for this is that the wide host range allows the viruses to successfully overseason from one crop to the next. To prevent spread of the virus infected plants should be immediately removed away from neighbouring plants. Control of insects, especially thrips, is important to reduce spread of the virus by vectors.

In the late 80's, he and keyboardist Jim Gilmour left Saga and formed GNP (Gilmour Negus Project). Biography While playing at Larry's Hideaway, a club in Toronto, Steve Negus' drumming came to the attention of the Canadian rock band, Fludd. The band was searching for a new drummer, and offered Steve the job that night. Several weeks later Steve joined Fludd as their new drummer. While in Fludd, Steve Negus met bassist Jim Crichton and keyboardist Peter Rochon, who would later join him as founding members of Pockets, the original working name of Saga. Brian and Ed Pilling were the creative force behind Fludd, and about a year after Steve joined, Brian was stricken with leukemia and the band couldn't continue to perform. A new band, Pockets, was formed out of Fludd's rhythm section. Negus, Crichton, and Rochon went into eight months of rehearsal to form the new band with Jim Crichton's younger brother Ian Crichton on guitar and Michael Sadler as the singer. They changed their name to Saga a year later. With Saga, Negus earned many gold and platinum selling CDs in Europe, Canada, and the U.S. In 1981, the band went to England to work with Rupert Hine as producer, and Worlds Apart was recorded at Farmyard Studios. Producer Hine also had Steve play drums on Chris de Burgh's album, The Getaway. ‚ÄúDon't Pay the Ferryman‚Äù was the single from that album, which went to #34 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States.Whitburn, Joel (2004).

In the late 80's, Negus and keyboardist Jim Gilmour left Saga and formed GNP (Gilmour Negus Project) with singer Robert Bevan for Virgin Records. The CD Safety Zone which was produced by Negus came out in 1989. Before a follow-up CD could be written and recorded, Negus and Gilmour reunited with Saga which ended GNP. In 2003, Negus left Saga once again. In 2007, Negus released his first true solo project \\"Dare to Dream\\" through Cyclone Records.

Hendrick de Clerck (c. 1560 ‚Äì 27 August 1630) was a Flemish painter active in Brussels during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Stylistically he belongs to the late Mannerist generation of artists preceding Peter Paul Rubens and the Flemish Baroque, and his paintings are very similar to his contemporary Marten de Vos.Vlieghe, p. 15. His exact date of birth is unknown, but in 1594 he is employed as court painter to Archduke Ernest, a position he continued to hold in the service of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella following Ernest's death in 1596.Laureyssens. Altarpieces Like Marten de Vos in Antwerp De Clerck was responsible for painting new altarpieces for churches in Brussels following the iconoclastic outbreaks of 1566, for which he used the clear visual language common in post-Tridentine Counter-Reformation art. Despite continuing to work through the early decades of the seventeenth-century, when the Baroque language was in full bloom, late works such as the Deposition for St. Peter's in Anderlecht (1628) are still decidedly Mannerist. His somewhat outmoded tendencies are also reflected in his frequent use of the triptych format that had been popular with late Medieval and northern Renaissance artists. Cabinet paintings De Clerck also specialized in small cabinet paintings depicting biblical, allegorical and mythological subjects, which were collected by Brussels' aristocratic patrons.Vlieghe, pp. 109‚Äì111. Frequently he painted the figures, while collaborating with other artists, such as Jan Brueghel the Elder and Denijs van Alsloot, for the landscapes and other features.

She was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame in 1978. Life Pattie Ruffner was born October 2, 1875, in West Virginia; she died December 22, 1935. She was educated at Ward's Seminary in Nashville, Tennessee, but was unable to continue her studies during the economic crisis of the 1890s. Her parents' marriage dissolved in that period and Pattie moved with her mother to Birmingham to stay with an older sister's family. Ruffner married Birmingham businessman Solon Jacobs and took advantage of his means to travel and to enroll in voice classes in New York City. Over time, she became more politically active in the swirl of Progressivism which was reshaping Birmingham as a New South city of industry. Jacobs joined the fight against child labor, convict leasing, and prostitution which were all endemic in the Birmingham District. She was an active member of the Salvation Army and the Jefferson County Anti-Tuberculosis Association. Her increasing national standing led to her participation in the campaign for the sale of Liberty Bonds during World War I. It was after several failed efforts toward improving public schools that Jacobs concluded that women's suffrage was necessary in order to achieve social reforms through the political process. She founded the Birmingham Equal Suffrace Association in 1910, followed by the Alabama Equal Suffrage Association a year later. In 1913, Jacobs spoke on behalf of Southern women's suffragists at the Annual Convention of the National Woman Suffrage Association in Washington D. C.. Jacobs and her colleagues nearly succeeded in putting a statewide suffrage referendum on the ballot in 1915, but opponents played up fears that giving women the vote would increase the political power of African Americans. The AESA then turned its efforts toward promoting a national suffrage amendment. Jacobs was elected as an officer in the National Equal Suffrage Association in 1915. After the passage of the 19th Amendment, Jacobs led the transition of her local organizations into Leagues of Women Voters. She also became national secretary for the National League of Women Voters. Jacobs led efforts toward other socially-progressive laws as well, such as a failed attempt to establish an 8-hour work day. Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt recognized her leadership with appointments to various commissions, such as the Consumer Advisory Board of the National Recovery Administration and as a spokeswoman for the Tennessee Valley Authority. In 1933 she was the first woman appointed to the Democratic National Committee from Alabama, a position she held until her death two years later. Jacobs is buried in Birmingham's Elmwood Cemetery.

He is commemorated at the Cheltenham Racecourse, in the title of the Festival's Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup. Amongst his notable owners Dorothy Paget until 1954 and, following the death of Peter Cazalet in 1973, the Queen Mother. As well as his many victories in National Hunt racing, he also trained Dorothy Paget's Aldborough to win the Doncaster Cup and the Queen Alexandra Stakes on the Flat. Walwyn became a household name in 1964, when his Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, Mill House, was defending his crown against Arkle, in an epic race that eventually saw Arkle win the first of his three Gold Cup victories. He was appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in 1983. He died at Saxon House. In all, he achieved over 2000 wins. After his death, the 3-mile Kim Muir Memorial Chase at the Cheltenham National Hunt Festival was renamed the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup, in his honour.

Giovacchini was the most renowned of the Corsican Italians, who actively promoted the unification of Corsica to the Kingdom of Italy during the Fascist years.Italian irredentism in Corsica: P. Giovacchini Life Since he was young he collaborated with writings to the literary newspaper A Muvra. In 1927 he was expelled from the \\"Liceo National\\" of Bastia and founded the pro-Italian magazine \\"Primavera\\", where he published the poems \\"Musa canalinca\\" and \\"Rime notturne\\". Giovacchini was disappointed with the moderate positions of the Movimento Autonomista Corso and decided to move to Italy in 1930 to study medicine at the Pisa University. In Italy Giovacchini entered in contact with the Italian irredentism movement and because of this was harshly attacked by the French authorities when he returned to Corsica. One of the main accusations he received was that he considered Pasquale Paoli (the hero of Corsica) as the precursor of the Corsican irredentism in favor of the unification of the island to Italy. He escaped to Italy and in November 1933 founded in Pavia the famous \\"Gruppi di Cultura Corsa\\", with Corsican university students in Italy. In 1936 Giovacchini got his degree and, as a member of the Fascist Party, he quickly volunteered to fight in Ethiopia and successively in Spain, where he was wounded and got the \\"bronze\\" medal of honor. In June 1940 Petru Giovacchini organized hundreds of manifestations in many cities of Italy in order to request the Corsica unification to Italy. Because of this he was elected to represent Corsica in the Italian Fascist Parliament in 1942. When Italy occupied Corsica in November 1942, Giovacchini was named as the possible Governor of Corsica if the Kingdom of Italy would have annexed the island of Corsica. He worked with colonel Petru Simone Cristofini to make the Corsican population accept the Italian occupation of Corsica (and later a possible union to Italy). After the Italian armistice in September 1943, Petru Giovacchini was forced to hide until 1945. Prosecuted by a French tribunal in Corsica, he received a death sentence in 1945 and so went in exile to Canterano (near Rome). On September 1955 Petru Giovacchini died, as a consequence of former combat wounds. Works The literary works of Petru Giovacchini were: *Musa Canalinca (1929) *Rime notturne (1930) *Aurore, poesie corse (1936) *Corsica Nostra (1942) *Archiatri pontifici corsi (1951) The Corsican Italians who promoted the ideal of Corsican irredentism published mainly in Italy, because of the persecutions from the French regime in the island. This was the case of Petru Giovacchini, who (after his initial poems Musa canalinca and Rime notturne, done when young) wrote his main literary works in Italy. Indeed, he wrote Aurore, poesie corse in 1936 in Livorno, followed by Corsica nostra and the Archiatri pontifici corsi in 1942 and 1951 in Rome (the last, just a few years before his premature death).

It is found in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of New England and eastern Canada. The fish has antifreeze proteins in its blood, giving it the ability to survive in near-freezing waters. Use in genetic modification Scientists have succeeded in taking genes from ocean pout and implanted those into Atlantic salmon. The promoter for the antifreeze protein gene is used in conjunction with a growth hormone gene from Chinook salmon, which leads to a higher concentration of the growth hormone in the blood, causing the genetically modified salmon to grow much more rapidly. These transgenic salmon reach a harvest weight in two-thirds of the time that it takes their unmodified counterparts. Controversy has arisen, as some view the genetically altered salmon as a potential threat to wild salmon stocks should it escape into the wild. AquaBounty Technologies has attempted to address these concerns by stating that all of the transgenic salmon to be intended for sale will be sterile females. As of late 2017, several tons have been sold in Canada, and final approvals and decisions on labeling are pending in the United States. Some restaurant and grocery store chains in the United States have announced they will not sell the new fish, citing concerns over its safety for human consumption, despite no scientific evidence showing risk. In June 2006, the Unilever company announced that it would research the potential use of genetically modified yeast to grow antifreeze proteins based on a gene from the ocean pout, and use proteins extracted from the yeast to improve the consistency and storage properties of ice cream. Incorporating these ice-structuring proteins means that a lower cream content, and thus a lower calorie content, ice cream can be manufactured without the risk of ice crystal formation.

He was a court painter to the Roman Emperor and the Prince of Wales and was active as an ambassador and art dealer. Life Frans Wouters was born in Lier, present-day Belgium. He was first apprenticed to Pieter van Avont in Antwerp in 1629 but broke his contract to move to the workshop of Rubens in 1634.BALIS, A., ‚ÄòRubens and his Studio: Defining the Problem‚Äô, in: Rubens.

Allegory of sight He spent the 1630s as court painter to Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II. He was sent as an ambassador of Ferdinand II to England in 1637.Franciscus Wouters biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature The following year, he became the painter of the Prince of Wales, the future Charles II of England. In England, Wouters would certainly have had the opportunity to meet his compatriot Anthony van Dyck, who was at that time the court painter of Charles I of England. Even after his return to Antwerp in 1641 he remained in contact with Charles II during the period of the English Civil War and the Commonwealth. He was described in 1658 as Charles‚Äôs 'ayuda de c√°mera' (chamberlain).Karel Frans Wouters (1612-1660) at the Royal Collection In Antwerp he collaborated again with his former master Pieter van Avont mainly adding landscapes to van Avont's compositions. He became involved in the art market. In this capacity he assisted in the valuation of the paintings in Rubens' estate. His marriage to Maria Doncker, daughter of the treasurer of Antwerp, in 1644 provided him with a substantial fortune. In 1648, he became dean of the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke. He was involved in the sale of the art collection of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham by the English Parliamentary Commissioners in 1648. At around this time Wouters began to work for Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, the then Governor of the Southern Netherlands and an avid art patron and collector.Hans Vlieghe. \\"Wouters, Frans.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 15 April 2014 Work Bacchanal Wouters' style and subject matter reflect the taste of his international aristocratic clients who preferred small paintings, decorative landscapes and mythological stories. Other themes appreciated by these patrons were scenes dealing with alchemy, the four elements, Allegories of the Five Senses as well as iconographical themes that allowed for different levels of interpretation based on a number of references and allusions, or devices such as the 'picture within a picture'. An example is the Allegory of sight (Auctioned at Dorotheum on 19 April 2016 in Vienna, lot 29) where the sense of sight is represented primarily by the woman regarding herself in the mirror. This act also alludes to another theme, that of vanity, which is further evoked by the still life painting on the right. The room with its variety of precious objects, scientific instruments, paintings and sculptures has taken the semblance of a 'cabinet of curiosities. The multitude of objects refers to the various forms of visual perception and man's desire to take possession of the things he sees by understanding them. The world map in the foreground further alludes to man's ability to observe and understand distant worlds. In contrast, the monkey in the foreground of the painting is only capable of achieving the lowest, most superficial level of seeing, the staring at things without genuine understanding. Even the use of two pairs of spectacles does not help the poor animal.Frans Wouters, An Allegory of Sight at Dorotheum His style bore initially a resemblance to the late Mannerism of Joos de Momper and was later influenced by Rubens and in particular Rubens' landscape paintings. After entering the service of Archduke Leopold William, Wouters' work demonstrated the increased influence of Anthony van Dyck and the human figures in his paintings became elongated and emotionally expressive. He painted biblical scenes and mythological landscapes in this style.

Plot When teenager Kirsten (Julie Austin) accidentally cuts her hand during an \\"Anti-Christmas\\" pagan ritual with her friends Brooke and Amy in the woods, her spilled blood awakens an ancient demonic Christmas elf. The elf is the central figure in a modern-day Neo-Nazi plot to finally bring about the master race that Hitler had always dreamed of conquering the world with. Rather than a race of pure-blood Aryans, it is revealed that Hitler instead dreamed of a race of half-human/half-elf hybrids (it is also revealed that elves figured heavily into a pseudo-cult religion that the Nazis practiced in secret). Kirsten is also a figure in this plot as she is the last remaining pure-blooded Aryan virgin in the world, her grandfather being a former Nazi who was once involved in the plot (but is now reformed); he is also her father, as inbreeding was somehow considered crucial to maintaining a pure Aryan bloodline. Unaware of all these sinister goings- on, the non-festive Kirsten continues to sulk her way through the Christmas season as she works at the snack counter of a local department store. Mike McGavin (Dan Haggerty) is an ex-cop who lost his badge when he lost control of his alcoholism. Jobless, penniless, and recently served a notice of eviction from his ramshackle trailer home, Mike turns to his old friend ‚Äì the manager of the department store ‚Äì for help, and winds up becoming the store Santa after the prior Santa is murdered by the elf. Without a proper home, Mike sneaks into the store at night to sleep in the storage room and live off the snack counter left-overs. One night, he hears Kirsten and her friends, who have also sneaked in, frolicking through the store as they wait for their boyfriends to show up for an all-night party. The shadowy Nazi group arrives instead, planning to kidnap Kirsten and find the elf so the master race can finally be made reality. With Mike's help, Kirsten escapes with her life, though her friends are not so lucky. Promptly fired for breaking into the store after hours, Mike and Kirsten are able to devote their time to unraveling the plot. After making a Christmas Eve visit to the local college library and later breaking into a professor's home to demand information, Mike realizes what is afoot and sets out to protect Kirsten. Mike, Kirsten and her grandfather have a final climactic showdown with the Nazis and the elf in Kirsten's home, culminating in the woods where Kirsten destroys the elf by performing a ritual involving an \\"elfstone\\" from her grandfather's study. The following morning, Kirsten huddles in the now-inexplicably destroyed forest as it begins to snow for the first time that winter. The film ends on the image of a fetus, suggesting perhaps that the plot was successful despite the elf's seeming inability to actually copulate with Kirsten before its demise.

He currently lives in Islamabad. Early life Born Muhammad Salim Khawaja in the village of Miana Gondal in Gujrat District, Punjab, Pakistan, Salim was the fourth among seven brothers and sisters. Salim's early education was in Miana Gondal, before going to Peshawar for matriculation. While studying in Peshawar, Salim made acquaintance with writers and poets; notably Farigh Bukhari, Mohsin Ahsan, Raza Hamdani, and Jauhar Meer. After matriculating from Peshawar, Salim moved to Karachi for his intermediate education. He got admission in Urdu College. Around that time Ahmad Salim participated in a competition arranged by Afkar, a literary magazine. Participants were asked to write their thoughts on Faiz Ahmad Faiz's poetry. Ahmad Salim's poem on Faiz got first prize in the competition. At that time Faiz was the principal of Abdullah Haroon College. On Faiz's invitation Ahmad Salim joined Abdullah Haroon College. A close association grew between Faiz and Ahmad Salim, and continued till Faiz's death in 1984. Career After completing high school (Intermediate) Ahmad Salim joined the National Bank in 1968. Later he was transferred to Rawalpindi where he continued working for that bank through 1969. Ahmad Salim then moved to Lahore and started teaching at Shah Hussain College. During 1969‚Äì71 he was associated with National Awami Party (NAP), and was briefly put in jail in 1971 for his criticism of Pakistan Army's operation in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). In 1972 Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto appointed Faiz as the Chairman of National Council of Arts. On Faiz's invitation Ahmad Salim joined the council. During his association with the National Council of Arts from 1972 through 1975, Ahmad Salim operated the Folklore Research Centre and published material on Punjabi and Sindhi folklore. Ahmad Salim left the Council shortly after Faiz left that institution in 1974. 1976‚Äì77, Ahmad Salim taught at Sindh University, Jamshoro. He taught a course on Pakistani languages‚Äîthe course material was developed by him. At that time Shaikh Ayaz was the Vice-Chancellor of Sindh University. Ahmad Salim enjoyed good relations with Shaikh Ayaz, as he had translated Ayaz's poetry into Punjabi. Ahmad Salim's principal work at the Sindh University was to translate Shah Hussain's poetry into Sindhi, and Bhitai's work into Punjabi, though he could not complete the latter. During his stay at the Sindh University Ahmad Salim also completed his Bachelor of Arts degree. After Bhutto imposed martial law, Ahmad Salim moved to Karachi in late 1977. There he wrote reviews of TV programs for Daily Aman (Editor: Afzal Siddiqui). For supplemental income Ahmad Salim did a lot of translation work too, and came to popularly known as Ahmad Salim Muttarajjim (translator).

It is the third track on their 1971 album Look at Yourself. The song was written in July 1970 by the band's keyboardist Ken Hensley and lead singer, David Byron. Approximately the last four minutes of the piece consist of a virtuosic organ solo. The odd sounding calliope riffs are played by Manfred Mann who, according to the album's liner notes, \\"appears for the first time with his Moog synthesizer\\". The song also was released as a single from Uriah Heep's first live album Uriah Heep Live. The song is written in the key of C minor, and is played with eight chords: Cm, Fm, Bb, Eb, G, Ab, F and C. The song has four verses and four choruses, featuring an organ introduction and a guitar solo. There is a guitar bridge between the first and second parts of the song. AllMusic contributor Dave Thompson described the song as the best produced by Uriah Heep, with a \\"magnificent arrangement and performance\\", and in 1995, Radiomafia added \\"July Morning\\" to their list of \\"Top 500 Songs\\". \\"July Morning\\" was first released on the Look at Yourself album and as a single in Japan and Venezuela. The Venezuelan single split the song across both sides of the 7\\", while the Japanese single featured an edited version of the song, which was later released on the band's greatest hits album Your Turn to Remember in 2016. The live version from Uriah Heep Live was also released as a single. In 2009 the band released a new version of the song on the album Celebration.

History The Grand Han Righteous Army was formed by minor warlord and commander of the Chahar People's Anti-Japanese Army Wang Ying after his defeat by the Imperial Japanese Army in what now part of Inner Mongolia in 1936. Wang defected to the Kwantung Army and persuaded the Japanese to permit him to recruit unemployed Chinese soldiers in Chahar Province to form a mercenary army with Japanese advisors. He managed to recruit approximately 6,000 men, who were trained by the Japanese and organized into four infantry brigades in Japanese-occupied northern Chahar. The troops were armed with weapons seized from Northeastern Army armories and warehouses in northern China. Thag force was attached another Japanese proxy army, the Inner Mongolian Army, under the overall command of Mongol Prince Teh Wang. During the Invasion of Suiyuan the Inner Mongolian Army attacked Hongort on November 15, 1936. After several days of fighting, the attackers failed to capture the town. On November 17, a Chinese counterattack surprised the invaders and led to a disorganized retreat. Taking advantage of the disorder among the Mongolian forces, Chinese General Fu Zuoyi made a flanking movement to the west of the Mongolian headquarters at Pailingmiao, attacked and captured it, and routed the defenders. The Japanese transported Wang and his Grand Han Righteous Army by trucks into a location near Pai-ling-miao and launched a counterattack, which failed dismally on December 19. With the bulk of its men captured or killed, the Grand Han Righteous Army ceased to exist as an effective combat force, and the Japanese disbanded the remnants.

Early life and education He was born in Kensington, London, the son of Baron James Prior de Paravicini, of Riverside, Datchet, Windsor. cites He was educated at Aldin House, Slough and Eton College, where he was a member of the cricket eleven from 1878 to 1881, being captain in 1880 and 1881. Cricket career De Paravicini was one of an elite few to have played for the Eton College cricket XI for four consecutive years, and arguably he was one of the best players the school has had. He was captain in 1880 and 1881 (i.e. Keeper of the Field). He played against his brother, Harry, in the annual Eton v Harrow cricket match held at Lord's Cricket Ground. He made his first-class debut for Middlesex on 15 August 1881 at Old Trafford, Manchester in the County Tournament against Lancashire. He continued to appear for Middlesex throughout August, playing in four county matches, scoring only 33 runs and taking one wicket. He was a right-handed middle-order batsman, a slow round- arm bowler and an outstanding fielder. In the autumn of 1881 he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge where he won a cricket blue in each of his four years (1882 to 1885). He played his first cricket match for the University on 25 May 1882 against the \\"Gentlemen of England\\". In 1882 he appeared six times for Cambridge University. 1883 was his best season, making 17 appearances (7 for the University, 8 for Middlesex and 2 for representative teams) scoring 595 runs at an average of 24.79 and taking 16 wickets at an average of 20.75. In the match at The Oval for the University against Surrey in June he made his best score to date with 61 in the first innings and taking 4 wickets for 26 runs. In this match Charles Studd made his best ever score with 175 n.o. as the University won the match by 200 runs. In 1888 he improved his best batting performance, with 77 for Middlesex against Nottinghamshire in June; he scored a total of 485 in the season at an average of 14.69. During his first-class career he played 62 times for Middlesex and 25 for Cambridge University. He also played for Buckinghamshire from 1899 to 1911. Football career At Cambridge University he won his blue for football in 1883. A \\"speedy, two- footed defender\\", he appeared in two FA Cup Finals for Old Etonians, being on the winning side in 1882 against Blackburn Rovers, but losing out the following year to Blackburn Olympic. In the 1882 final, he was part of the last \\"all amateur\\" side to win the FA Cup as well as the last team from south of Birmingham to win it during the nineteenth century. The Old Etonians fielded a team with nine players with previous FA Cup final experience, having reached the final four times in the previous seven seasons. In the match itself, de Paravicini and Arthur Kinnaird managed to contain the Blackburn Rovers forwards, whilst the Old Boys' forwards continually created problems for the Rovers' defence until Reginald Macaulay managed to steer the ball between the Blackburn goalposts for the only goal of the game. In February and March 1883 he was selected for all three England internationals, against Scotland, Wales and Ireland. England comfortably defeated the Welsh 5‚Äì0 (with a hat trick from Clement Mitchell) and the Irish 7‚Äì0, but lost out to the Scots by the odd goal in five. On 31 March 1883, the Old Etonians reached the FA Cup final for the third consecutive year and were comfortable favourites to defeat Blackburn Olympic. Olympic however were well organised and defeated the Old Boys 2‚Äì1 after extra time. After his exploits in the FA Cup and for England, de Paravicini made occasional appearances for the Corinthians. He also played for Windsor football club and made representative appearances for London, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire, and The South versus The North. =Honours= Old Etonians *FA Cup winner: 1882 *FA Cup finalist: 1883 Life outside sport At Eton he was a president of 'Pop'; the group of 25 elected prefects. He was a J.P. for Buckinghamshire and during the First World War took command of the Datchet Volunteer Platoon. He was decorated with the Commander, Royal Victorian Order (C.V.O.). He is also credited with being on the inaugural committee for Stoke Park Club based in Stoke Poges, and the only member of the Corinthians on the committee at the time. Family and death On 21 May 1891, he married Lady Marcia Charlotte Maria Cholmondeley, daughter of Charles George, the Viscount Malpas.

It was established by treaty with the Rogue River Indians in 1853. Following the conclusion of the Rogue River Wars in 1856, the Native American inhabitants were moved to other reservations. The reservation was in Southern Oregon, between Upper Table Rock and Evans Creek. History Conflicts between miners and Rogue River Indians began in the early 1850s, when gold was discovered in what is now Oregon. This conflict turned into open warfare and several treaties were signed in an attempt to end the hostilities resulting in the Native Americans ceding their land. They were moved to Table Rock Reservation before being moved to the Grand Ronde Reservation and the Coast Reservation (a small fraction of which is now the Siletz Reservation). Native Americans lost most of the Bear Creek Valley in exchange for the Table Rock Reservation. In October 1855, a lack of food, a cold winter, and disease devastated the families on the reservation, so a group of Takelma Indians returned to their old village at the mouth of Little Butte Creek on the upper Rogue River. A volunteer militia then attacked them, killing 23 including women and children. A small group responded to this dire situation by fleeing to the Rogue River Canyon, attacking miners and settlers from Evans Creek to Galice Creek on the way. The militia and regular army troops caught up with them in the Grave Creek Hills, and the Indians inflicted heavy casualties on the poorly trained troops. What became known as the Battle of Hungry Hill was a major victory for the Indians. In November, the militia and army again attacked, and again were defeated. The attack was meant to be a surprise, but the Native Americans heard them chopping trees to build rafts and were prepared. Several more battles were then fought. In the spring of 1856, a force of nearly 200 volunteers arrived at the mouth of Ditch Creek on the Rogue River, and fired on the Indians' settlement on the far shore. Up to 30 Indians were killed during the day-long assault, forcing the survivors to surrender. In the summer and following winter, licensed hunters killed and captured Indians who remained in the area. In the winter of 1856‚Äì57, 400 Indians were marched from Table Rock north to the new Grand Ronde Reservation in Yamhill County. The survivors of the Battle of Hungry Hill were loaded onto a steamboat at Port Orford, Oregon then transported via the Columbia River and Willamette River and then overland to the Siletz Reservation near the Oregon Coast.

He was first active in Antwerp where he worked in the workshop of Rubens. He later became court painter at the Habsburg court in Vienna. He is known for his portraits of the rulers of Austria as well as for his pastoral, mythological and religious scenes.Hans Vlieghe. \\"Thomas, Jan.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 4 April 2020 Life Jan Thomas was born in Ypres, Flanders. Ypres is called Ieper and Ieperen in Flemish. The addition 'van Ieperen', which means 'from Ypres' was added to his name to indicate this. Little is known about the artist's training. The 17th century Flemish biographer Cornelis de Bie wrote in his Het Gulden Cabinet that Jan Thomas was a pupil of Peter Paul Rubens. There is evidence that he spent time in Rubens' workshop at the end of Rubens' life or shortly thereafter. There are stylistic grounds to consider Thomas as a pupil of Rubens as he was familiar with Rubens' late works and translated some of them to smaller scale paintings. Modern scholarship tends to regard Jan Thomas as one of the many collaborators in Rubens' workshop who assisted with large commissions such as the decorations for the Torre de la Parada, the hunting lodge of the Spanish king (1636-1638). It is possible that upon Rubens' death Thomas was the 'primer official' of Rubens' workshop, i.e. the chief assistant in charge of executing paintings after the designs of the master.Arnout Balis, Rubens and his Studio: Defining the Problem, in: Joost vander Auwera, Rubens: A Genius at Work: the Works of Peter Paul Rubens in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium Reconsidered, Lannoo Uitgeverij, 2007, p. 47 Shepherd and shepherdess Jan Thomas became a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1639/1640. Two years later he acquired Antwerp citizenship.Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde Volume 2, Antwerp, 1864, pp. 110 In 1641/1642 he took Andris Lamberechts on as an apprentice. The next year Andries de Coninck and Jacob Sons joined his workshop as pupils. In 1642 he married Maria Cnobbaert, daughter of the Antwerp book dealer Joannes Cnobbaert.Jan Thomas at the Netherlands Institute for Art History In 1652 Jan Thomas' third child was baptized in the St. James' Church in Antwerp, which is evidence that he was then still living in that city. It is believed that Jan Thomas left Antwerp in 1654 to work as a painter for the bishop of Mainz Johann Philipp von Sch√∂nborn one of the important courts at that time.Hans Vlieghe, Flemish Art and Architecture, 1585-1700, Pelican history of art, New Haven: Yale University Press (1998): 111‚Äì112. Jan Baptist de Ruel was his pupil during his stay in this city. Around 1658 he was in Frankfurt at the time of the coronation of Leopold I as emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and painted a (now lost) portrait of the emperor. In that period he also received commissions from the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria. From the latter part of the 1650s Jan Thomas certainly lived with his family in Vienna. He is documented in Vienna when a child of his was baptized there on 8 December 1663. He is recorded living in the K√§rtnerstrasse in 1667. In Vienna he received commissions from the imperial court and painted the portraits of Leopold I and his wife Margaret Theresa in theater costume. These portraits were made at the occasion of the celebrations surrounding the marriage of the imperial couple in 1666. Jan Thomas also received commissions from the higher clergy and the aristocracy, such as the House of Zrinski or Zr√≠nyi. He painted a portrait of the general and poet Mikl√≥s Zr√≠nyi a few years before Zr√≠nyi's death in 1664.J√∫lia T√°trai J√∫lia T√°trai, Wiener Hofk√ºnstler und die Zr√≠nyis. Portr√§ts in der Lobkowicz-Sammlung in: Journal of the Institute of Art History (Zagreb), 2018 He died from a stroke in Vienna on 6 September 1673. Work In addition to large religious history paintings, Jan Thomas painted landscapes with mythological or pastoral figures and portraits. He made a large number of portraits of Leopold William and Emperor Leopold I and other members of the royal and aristocratic families in the Habsburg territories. File:Jan Thomas - Leopold I as Acis in the play \\"La Galatea\\".jpgLeopold I as Acis in the play 'La Galatea' File:Jan Thomas - Infanta Margaret Theresa, Empress, in theater dress.jpgInfanta Margaret Theresa, Empress, in theater dress His style shows a close relationship to that of Rubens, in particular that of Rubens' later work which was sent directly to Spain. This is evidence that he likely worked in Rubens' workshop at the end of the master's life and/or just after his death. Like his contemporary Frans Wouters, many of his works translate the monumental Baroque style of Peter Paul Rubens into the small context of cabinet paintings. This is particularly obvious in his biblical paintings in which he regularly cites from Rubens' works. In his small-scale mythological scenes his style is more reminiscent of the late Mannerist style of Frans Francken the Younger. The triumph of Bacchus His life-size portraits, which he already made during his stay in Vienna, are consistent with the elegant and, at the same time, decorative portrait style created by Flemish artists working in Vienna in the second half of the 17th century. An example is the Leopold I as Acis in the play 'La Galatea' (1668, Kunsthistorisches Museum). Around 1658 Jan Thomas began to work in the new medium of the mezzotint. One of these works in mezzotint is a portrait of Titian from 1661, which was dedicated to Empress Eleonora, widow of the father of Leopold I, Emperor Ferdinand III. Besides engravings in mezzotint Jan Thomas also worked ss an etcher and engraver. He made engravings of his own compositions as well as of the works of other artists such as Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Gerard Dou and Giovanni Ambrogio Figino.J. van Tatenhove, Jan Thomas van Yperen, in: Delineavit et Sculpsit, No. 15, May 1995, pp. 39‚Äì41 In his graphic work he also made genre and allegorical works as in the Woman with the portrait of a man in her hand (Rijksmuseum), which was published by Frans van den Wyngaerde. It shows a sitting woman with an older woman behind her in a confined area. The younger woman holds the portrait of a man in her one hand and an arrow in her other. On the dressing table in front of her are placed a ring, a comb and scissors. This may be a pure genre scene or a vanitas allegory reminding the viewer of the temporary nature of all humanly endeavors.Jan Thomas van Ieperen, Woman with the portrait of a man in her hand at the Rijksmuseum References External links * 1617 births 1673 deaths Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke Flemish Baroque painters Flemish portrait painters Flemish printmakers Flemish history painters People from Ypres ","title":"Jan Thomas van Ieperen"},{"id":"14328253","text":"Ludovico Marracci Louis (or Ludovico) Maracci (6 October 1612 ‚Äì 5 February 1700), best known by name Lewis Maracci, was an Italian Oriental scholar and professor of Arabic in the College of Wisdom at Rome.

He attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio where he developed his interest in filmmaking. He won an Emmy Award for the film Gauguin in Tahiti: Search for Paradise which was directed by Martin Carr in 1967. Life and career Dorsky was a visiting instructor at Princeton University in 2008 and he has been the recipient of many awards including a Guggenheim Fellowship 1997 and grants from the National Endowment of the Arts, two from the Rockefeller Foundation, and one from the LEF Foundation, the Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists award (2006), and the California Arts Council. He has presented films at the Museum of Modern Art, the Centre Pompidou, the Tate Modern, the Filmoteca Espa√±ola, Madrid, the Prague Film Archive, the Vienna Film Museum, the Pacific Film Archive, the Harvard Film Archive, Princeton University, Yale University, and frequently exhibits new work at the New York Film Festival's Views from the Avant-Garde and the Wavelengths program of the Toronto International Film Festival. In spring 2012, Dorsky took actively part in the three-month exposition of Whitney Biennial. In October 2015, the New York Film Festival honored his work with a thirty four film complete retrospective at Lincoln Center. Manohla Dargis of the New York Times listed this retrospective in second place in her list of the top ten films of 2015. In his book Devotional Cinema (2003), Dorsky writes of the long-standing link between art and health as well as the transformative potential of watching film. He also writes of the limitations of film when its vision is subservient to a theme or representative of language description, which can describe a world but does not actually see it. Dorsky's films are available only as 16mm film prints and are distributed by Canyon Cinema in San Francisco and Light Cone in Paris. Prints of stills from his films are available at the Gallery Paule Anglim, San Francisco, and the Peter Blum Gallery, New York City. Style \\"The major part of my work is both silent and paced to be projected at silent speed (18 frames per second). Silence in cinema is undoubtedly an acquired taste, but the delicacy and intimacy it reveals has many rich rewards. In film, there are two ways of including human beings. One is depicting them. Another is to create a film form which, in itself, has all the qualities of being human: tenderness, observation, fear, curiosity, the sense of stepping into the world, sudden murky disruptions and undercurrents, expansion, pulling back, contraction, relaxation, sublime revelation. In my work, the screen is transformed into a \\"speaking character\\", and the images function as pure energy rather than acting as secondary symbol or as a source for information or storytelling. I put shots together to create a revelation of wisdom through delicate surprise. The montage does not lead to verbal understanding, but is actual and present. The narrative is that which takes place between the viewer and the screen. Silence allows these delicate articulations of vision which are simultaneously poetic and sculptural to be fully experienced.\\" - Nathaniel Dorsky ‚ÄúThe films of Nathaniel Dorsky blend a beauteous celebration of the sensual world with a deep sense of introspection and solitude. They are occasions for reflection and meditation, on light, landscape, time and the motions of consciousness. Their luminous photography emphasizes the elemental frisson between solidity and luminosity, between spirit and matter, while his uniquely developed montage permits a fluid and flowing experience of time. Dorsky's films reveal the mystery behind everyday existence, providing intimations of eternity.\\" - Steve Polta, San Francisco Cinematheque.

Located within the Air Itam suburb, the neighbourhood lies southwest of the city centre and was created in the 1980s. Over the recent decades, Farlim has evolved into a booming township, with several residential and commercial developments.  History  The area where Farlim is located was previously known as Thean Teik Estate, which was named after Khoo Thean Teik, a local Chinese merchant. The area was owned by the Khoo Kongsi, a Chinese clan association in which Khoo was a director. In 1978, Khoo Kongsi had reached an agreement with Farlim Group Berhad to develop Thean Teik Estate into a residential township. At the time, the project was the single largest property development ever undertaken by the private sector on Penang Island, with an area of being originally earmarked for development. However, the commencement of construction works in 1982 was met by deadly protests by local residents. In the incident which pitted the residents against the police, one resident was killed and another four were injured.  Transportation  Thean Teik Road and Thean Teik Highway are the two major roads that cut through the township. The former links Air Itam Road and the Paya Terubong suburb to the southwest, whereas the latter serves as a major thoroughfare between Paya Terubong and the Batu Lanchang suburb to the east. Rapid Penang bus routes 13, 202, 203 and 306 also include stops within Farlim, thus connecting the township with George Town proper, the Penang International Airport and Queensbay Mall, as well as the Paya Terubong and Gelugor suburbs.http://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/13.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/202.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/203.gif These are complemented by Rapid Penang's Congestion Alleviation Transport (CAT) Air Itam route, a free-of-charge transit service within Air Itam.

He was grandson of teacher Jos√© Padilla, a Spanish artist who began painting in the nineteenth century. As a child, Puyet learned to paint by watching his grandfather, whose company he preferred to that of children his own age. Biography - Jos√© Puyet By age eight, he had started working in pencils and oils. At age 20, Puyet entered the Spanish military, due to World War II, and was sent to the exclave of Melilla. The experience deepened his observations of new personages and atmospheres. His superiors learned of his talent and would often relieve him of guard duty to allow him to create paintings of the families of the High Commanders. Career Upon his return to M√°laga, Puyet ventured out on his own as an inspired artist. He moved to Madrid where he found life difficult. He often shared rooms with truck drivers and whomever else would allow him. He purchased art supplies with the little money he had and painted various scenes of people at work. He also found work painting pictures to decorate crypts and mausoleums, and packaging of perfumes and creams. Puyet's art eventually earned him a favorable reputation. He gave his first exhibition at Carrera de San Jer√≥nimo de Madrid. The exhibition was a success that led to 42 more exhibitions until Carrera de San Jer√≥nimo de Madrid finally closed. Puyet also exhibited in Barcelona, Valencia, M√°laga, San Francisco, New York City, Montreal, Miami, Monterrey, San Mateo, California, Houston, Boston, Hamburg, Berlin, Munich, and Mil√°n. In 1984, Puyet was listed in the publication Who's Who in Art. In 1988, he was inducted as a member of the Real Academy of Fine Art of San Telmo, in M√°laga. Legacy Today, his works are owned by families such as the House of Alba and the House of Grimaldi. Pl√°cido Domingo and Luis Olivo maintain sizable collections of Puyet's work. Puyet died from a cerebral hemorrhage on August 28, 2004 in Madrid at 82 years of age.

It is based on the play On Monday Next by Philip King. Plot In an English provincial town, 'Drossmouth', a second- rate repertory company assembles at the Theatre Royal on Monday morning to rehearse the following week's play, a melodrama titled Tarnished Gold. Harry, their irascible producer, is highly critical of the play, which has been foisted on him by the directors of the company and is unenthusiastic about its prospects. The cast includes Jerry, a young and sometimes keen actor, Maud, a widowed actress who was once famous on the West End stage, Sandra, who is waiting for (and receives) a call from a London producer, her philandering and semi-alcoholic husband, and Avis, a timid young girl who is quickly realising that acting is not for her. The cast is equally unenthusiastic of the play. Little progress is made. 'Jacko', the stage director, is at his wits end and threatens to resign, his regular habit when things go wrong. Just as matters seemingly cannot get worse, the author of the play, Catherine Beckwith, appears and insists on 'sitting at the feet' of the director. She and Harry are quickly at each other's throats. Harry tears up most of Act 1 and storms angrily off stage, falling into the pit and injuring himself. Despite the forebodings of the cast, Miss Beckwith insists on taking over the rehearsal according to her own ideas. However, Harry recovers and recasts the play as a period piece. A week later, to everyone's surprise, the curtain comes down on a triumphant first night. Cast * Robert Morley, W.H.

Overview Megaphone's founding member Matt Bloodwell was originally a drummer for punk rock band named Precious While in Precious, Matt Bloodwell was also writing songs. In October 2003, Matt left Precious to put together a band around the music he had been writing. \\"Being someone who everyone knows as a drummer but no one really knows as a song writer, I felt like if I wanted people to take me seriously as a song writer I had to do something really different. OK, so I'll sing and play guitar in Megaphone.\\" He then recruited local musicians. \\"I knew exactly what I wanted and I had a pretty good idea of who could pull it off. Now it was just a matter of are they going to like the material?\\" Guitarist Paul Smith, who has worked with Seven Mary Three, was just coming off the road with Vonray in support of their first Electra release when drummer Matt Brown introduced him to Bloodwells' demos. Matt Brown had been the drummer for 3AE signed to RCA before tragedy ended the band to soon. Matt Brown joined Megaphone and was with the band until March 2007 when he was replaced by former Cori Yarckin drummer Scott Smith.

The film was written and produced by L. Q. Jones, who also starred in the film, alongside Strother Martin. Plot Ben (Charles Bateman), his girlfriend Nicky (Ahna Capri), and Ben's young daughter K.T. (Geri Reischl) are driving through the American Southwest to K.T.'s grandmother's house for a birthday celebration. They come upon an automobile accident in the town of Hillsboro, and when they attempt to report it, they meet the local sheriff, (L. Q. Jones), his assistant Tobey (Alvy Moore), Doc Duncan (Strother Martin), and a priest (Charles Robinson). These locals explain the unusual events in the town which involve several murders, the inability of the people to leave the town, and that many of the local children have gone missing. A local coven of elderly Satanists have been taking the children and leading them to worship Satan in a plot to use their bodies as receptacles for their own souls. They use their supernatural abilities to kill anyone who interferes by turning the children's toys into instruments of murder. The priest figures out that the coven is taking the children, and tells people, including Ben and Nicky, because K.T. has gone missing. However, he sees the murder of a man trying to find his son, Joey. He goes crazy, turning into a blubbering mess. The people searching for the children, Sheriff, Tobey, Nicky and Ben, can't find Doc Duncan, (who is either Satan or the ringleader of the ceremonies. It is never said directly.) and search his house. They find the toy that came to life and killed Joey's father, Mike. It is a knight on horseback, and there is blood on the tiny sword. They show the priest the toy and he starts to scream. They take the toy away and try to open a locked door. On the other side of the door, a bloody ceremony, in which the coven members allow themselves to be killed by hooded bearers of flaming swords in order to take over the bodies of the now zombie-like children, is taking place. The camera flashes from the searchers struggling to open the door and the covern members being willingly slain. When they finally open the door, they see the children staring back at them. They are in a practically empty room, with the children, a table, dolls that resemble some of the black- cloaked coven members and a music box. The children continue to stare at the people and the camera slowly pans to an empty, black hole in a corner.

Location and features The Tumut River rises on the northern face of Mount Jagungal in the Snowy Mountains at and flows generally north by west, joined by twelve tributaries including the Doubtful Creek, Happy Jacks Creek and Goobarragandra River before meeting its confluence with the Murrumbidgee River, at Darbalara near the town of Gundagai; descending over its course. Between Cabramurra and Tumut, the natural course of the Tumut River has been altered as a result of the construction of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. A series of sixteen major dams and seven hydro-electric power stations were constructed between 1949 and 1974 to harness the flow of the Tumut and Snowy rivers. The Tumut River is impounded by six dams, located at Happy Jacks Dam, Tumut Pond Dam, Tumut Two Dam, Talbingo Dam, Jounama Dam, and Blowering Dam. Four hydro-power stations are located adjacent to the river flow. Although a relatively short river, the natural flow of the Tumut River is quite high, as it drains the snowmelt and other runoff from a large proportion of the northern Snowy Mountains. The natural flow of the river is amplified by water transferred from the Tooma River and Lake Eucumbene by the Snowy Mountains Scheme. The river is crossed by the heritage-listed Junction Bridge at Tumut. Etymology The word Tumut is derived from the Wiradjuri word ' or ', meaning camping by the river.  Environmental concerns  The Tumut River has been subject to considerable debate and lobbying on environmental grounds. The Tumut River has been widely documented as suffering from the effects of the un-natural flow regime resulting from the creation of the Snowy Mountain Scheme and the irrigation demand downstream of the Tumut River. Environmental damage attributed to the management of the Tumut River by the Government of New South Wales includes; *Erosion of river banks - quoted as approximating of lost land per of river frontage. *Waterlogging (souring) of low-lying land along the river. *Isolation of historical anabranches of the river (e.g. Holt's anabranch which is now regularly cut off at low flows.) The historic village of Brungle has been the subject of considerable media coverage on both Prime and WIN TV regarding river flows and water quality. *Thermal pollution (low water temperatures) resulting from the \\"bottom of the dam\\" outlet of Blowering Dam. *Loss of flora and fauna (e.g. platypuses) from the extreme changes in water level from high irrigation flows to winter flows of less than per day. *Rock facing of river banks to attempt to control erosion caused by high irrigation flows.  Sporting and leisure activities  The Tumut River has been a popular destination for a variety of sport and leisure activities including; *Canoeing/Kayaking - there are many excellent opportunities for canoeing downstream of Blowering Dam. Canoeing activities are often limited to higher flows as winter low flows are very difficult to paddle. Paddling is very pleasant at discharges above per day at Blowering Dam. The Tumut Valley Canoe Club are regular paddlers of the Tumut River. They meet at 5pm on Wednesday during Summer at their clubhouse which is next to the Riverglade caravan park Tumut. *Fishing - Fishing on the Tumut River is now limited to cold water species e.g. introduced trout species. The low temperatures of the river due to the bottom of the dam releases from Blowering Dam have virtually eliminated native fish species.

Campbell was born and raised in Palmerston North, New Zealand and attended Marsden Collegiate, Wellington where she studied acting. However, she discontinued her acting pursuits shortly after meeting and marrying fellow poet Alistair Campbell. Personal life Meg Campbell, born Aline Margaret Andersen, grew up in Palmerston North, New Zealand and studied acting in Wellington before meeting her husband Alistair Campbell in 1958, who was also married to another New Zealand poet Fleur Adcock previously. Throughout her lifetime Meg Campbell had struggled with depression; from bipolar disorder to postpartum depression of which she eventually suffered from a nervous breakdown. In 1969 she began writing poetry at Porirua Psychiatric Hospital. However, it wasn't until the late 1970s and 1980s that she began to publish her work. The topic of her long term experience with depression and mental institutions are expressed through a variety of her poetry. Work Toward the end of her depression Meg Campbell published her first poem \\"Solitary confinement\\" in 1978 in the New Zealand Listener. However, it wasn't until the 1980s that she began to publish books of poetry such as The Way Back (1981) which won the PEN Best First Book Award for poetry. Meg Campbell continued to publish books of poetry up until her death in 2007. Later a collection of poems from Alistair Campbell and Meg Campbell titled It's Love, Isn't It? would be published in 2008. Her personal papers, including early drafts of her poems, are held at the Alexander Turnbull Library, National Library of New Zealand. Style Meg Campbell's poetry expresses her personal experiences and struggles often by wit and a sense of humor. It is also said that the role of mythology within her poetry speaks about gender roles and sexuality as well as domesticity. In The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature, it states that Campbell's poetry \\"can form unexpected links, between the mythic and the domestic, for instance, as in 'Maui', or the universal and psychological, as in 'Things Random' or 'Evolution'.\\" The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English can agree with The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature that Campbell's voice is strong.

His older brother, Bevis (1909‚Äì1992), became a renowned landscape architect. Education He was educated at Royal College, Colombo after which he studied English and Law, 1938, at St Catharine's College, Cambridge gaining a BA (English Literature Tripos) and went on to study law at Middle Temple, London becoming a Barrister in 1944. Returning to Ceylon, after World War II, he worked for a Colombo law firm. After the death of his mother, he left the profession and soon left in 1946 to travel for two years, going to the Far East, across the United States, and finally to Europe and almost settling in Italy. By the time he was 28 years old, he had spent a third of his life away from Sri Lanka. During his time in Italy, he planned to buy a villa and settle down, but that did not happen, and by 1948 he had returned to Sri Lanka. Bawa bought an abandoned rubber estate on the south-west coast of the island between Colombo and Galle at Lunuganga, planning to create an Italian garden from a tropical wilderness. However, he soon found that his ideas were compromised by his lack of technical knowledge. In 1951, he was apprenticed to H. H. Reid, the sole surviving partner of the Colombo architectural practice Edwards, Reid and Begg. In 1952 Reid died, but Bawa still aspired to a career in architecture, so he returned to England, after spending a year at Cambridge, he enrolled as a student at the Architectural Association in London. There he gained a Diploma in Architecture by 1956 and in the following year he became an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects. To this day he is remembered as the tallest, oldest, and most outspoken student of his generation at AA. In 1957, at the age of 38 he returned to Sri Lanka qualified as an architect to take over what was left of Reid's practice. Career in architecture Returning to Ceylon, he became a partner of Messrs. Edwards, Reid and Begg, Colombo in 1958. In 1959, Danish architect Ulrik Plesner joined the firm, and the two designed many buildings together in their distinct style, sometimes called \\"tropical modernism.\\" Like the Maurice Talvande, Count de Mauny Talvande at Taprobane Island, the impetus for much of their work was the desire to create private arcadias within it.Aldrich, Robert Cultural Encounters and Homoeroticism in Sri Lanka: Sex and Serendipity, Routledge, 2014, pp66-79, 123-134 Bawa's architecture is at one with the land: inside and outside blend seamlessly, and it is designed for the maximum pleasure of its inhabitants. He was influenced by colonial and traditional Ceylonese architecture, and the role of water in it, but rejected both the idea of regionalism and the imposition of preconceived forms onto a site.Aldrich, Robert Cultural Encounters and Homoeroticism in Sri Lanka: Sex and Serendipity, Routledge, 2014, p125 > \\"Bawa's portfolio of work included religious, social, cultural, educational, > governmental, commercial and residential buildings, and in each of these > areas he established a canon of new prototypes.

An architectural memoir from Sri Lanka. Aristo Publishing, 2013, 451 pages, illustrated. Bawa became an Associate of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects in 1960. An ensuing close association with a coterie of like-minded artists and designers, including Ena de Silva, Barbara Sansoni and Laki Senanayake, produced a new awareness of indigenous materials and crafts, leading to a post-colonial renaissance of culture. Influence Geoffrey Bawa influenced a generation of architects in Sri Lanka after him, but his legacy was also embraced in Asia and around the world. He has influenced many architects worldwide including Singapore-based Australian architect Kerry Hill. List of works Geoffrey Bawa's work was mainly in Sri Lanka, but included several other countries as well: nine times in India, three times in Indonesia, twice in Mauritius and once in Japan, Pakistan, Fiji, Egypt and Singapore. His works include houses, hotels, schools, clubs, offices and government buildings, most notably the Sri Lankan Parliament Building. Today, the Gallery Caf√© on Paradise Road in Colombo is located in Bawa's former office building. ;1940s * Lunuganga, Bentota (1948‚Äì1998) ;1950s * St. Thomas' Preparatory School, Colombo (1957‚Äì1964) * Carmen Gunasekera House, Colombo (1958) * Kanangara House, Colombo (1959) * Club House, Ratnapura (1959) * Deraniyagala House, Colombo (1959) * Wimal Fernando House, Colombo (1959) * Jayawardena house, Colombo (1959‚Äì1960) * Ekala Industrial Estate, Ja ela (1959‚Äì1960) * A.S.H.

By 1844, Gignoux had opened a studio in New York City and became one of the first artists to join the famous Tenth Street Studio, where other members included Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Church, Jasper Francis Cropsey, and John Frederick Kensett. He returned to France in 1870 and died in Paris in 1882.

Background Martin attended St. Thomas Aquinas elementary school from 1930 to 1938, then completed four years of secondary education at Loyola high school. He then went on to Loyola College and graduated in 1944. Martin entered St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland in 1944, where he studied philosophy and theology. On May 22, 1948, at the age of 24, Joseph C. Martin was ordained as a priest for the Archdiocese of Baltimore. Martin's first assignment was to St. Joseph's College, a preparatory seminary serving the Archdiocese of San Francisco. In 1951, Martin completed the rigorous training required to become a Sulpician. His next assignment was at the Sulpician Seminary St. Charles College in Catonsville, Maryland. During this time, Martin began drinking excessively and his behaviour became more and more erratic. Despite repeated warnings, he was unable to get his drinking under control. Finally, the Archdiocese was forced to take action and sent Martin for intervention and treatment. Treatment at Guest House On June 15, 1958, Martin entered Guest House in Lake Orion, Michigan, a treatment facility for the clergy that was founded and operated by Austin Ripley, a syndicated columnist. While drinking Austin Ripley came across a copy of the Saturday Evening Post, and he discovered an article featuring Alcoholics Anonymous. The article described how this young organization helped alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety. It also talked about their ‚ÄúBig Book‚Äù which had been in print for some time. As a result of this article, Austin Ripley began his journey of recovery through Alcoholics Anonymous, devoting a good deal of the ensuing year in conversations with Bill W. and Dr. Bob, the founders of AA. Martin met Austin Ripley on the first day of his stay at Guest House. He also was introduced to Dr. Walter Green, another recovering alcoholic. Dr. Green was the first to talk to Martin about the manner in which drugs and alcohol cause the emotions to over-rule the intellect. Martin deeply admired Austin Ripley, and was so impressed with Dr. Green's lectures that he saved his notes from his conversations with them for over 14 years. They became the basis of his famous ‚ÄúChalk Talks,‚Äù a series of lectures that have been heard by hundreds of thousands of people around the world. Martin always credited both men for teaching him everything he knows about alcoholism. Career after treatment After Martin achieved sobriety and learned all he could from Austin Ripley and Dr. Green, he embarked on a campaign of spreading his message of experience and hope. He attended and completed the Rutgers Summer School of Alcohol Studies during the summer of 1971. He then worked as a lecturer and educator in the Division of Alcoholism Control for the State of Maryland and as a freelance consultant on alcoholism, a position he held from the fall of 1973 until his death. In 1972, Martin first put his lecture Chalk Talk on Alcohol on film for the US Navy. He and Mrs. Mae Abraham started Kelly Productions, Inc. to produce and distribute this and other lectures on various media. \\"Chalk Talk\\" would eventually become his signature lecture and would be widely utilized in most branches of the US Federal Government (especially the armed services), business and industry presentations, hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and many state alcohol programs. He has made many other films, tapes, CDs and DVDs on various aspects of the disease of addiction and recovery from it. He is the author of several publications including ‚ÄúNo Laughing Matter,‚Äù published by Harper & Row in 1982. In 1983 Martin and Mrs. Mae Abraham founded Father Martin‚Äôs Ashley, a non-profit center dedicated to the treatment of the chemically addicted, located in Havre de Grace, Maryland. Martin also continued to work within the church and participated in the International Conference on Drugs and Alcohol sponsored by the Vatican in 1991. Martin died of heart failure at his home in Havre de Grace, Maryland, on March 9, 2009. His burial Mass took place at the Baltimore Basilica on Friday, March 13, 2009, at 10:00am.

It is a powerful winged single-hander with well-developed 10 m sail. Unusually in recent performance designs both foils are pivoting enabling the centreboard to be adjusted from the wing as well making it particularly suitable for estuaries and shallow lakes. Development The Blaze was originally built by Ian Howlett and John Caig, and marketed by Topper International from 1996. At the outset the Blaze incorporated equalisation with lighter weight helms being allowed wider rack widths but carrying compensating lead weights. After a few years the class membership voted to abandon equalisation. In 2000 an active class association ran a sail development program to produce a more responsive sail, dropping some of the excessive leech of the original that proved 'difficult' in any real breeze for many helms. The slight loss in area was countered by a more efficient sail and balanced handling characteristics, and the class rapidly adopted the sail with numbers raced and sold rising very rapidly. In 2006 Topper moved out of performance composite boats and the manufacturing and marketing rights transferred to Cirrus Raceboats who have refined the boat further and work with Rondar to produce the current boat. As of November 2007 there are just under 250 registered boats. Since 2012 White Formula have been producing the Blaze. White Formula were the original builders, building all Topper International boats. Area The Blaze class is concentrated in the UK but there are boats in many other countries.

The Tooma Reservoir, part of the Snowy Mountains Scheme, captures water in the headwaters of the Tooma River, and diverts some of the water to the Tumut Pondage on the Tumut River, where the water is used to generate electricity in the sequence of hydro-electric power stations along the length of the Tumut River. This diversion results in a transfer of water from the Murray River catchment (which includes the Tooma River), to the Murrumbidgee River catchment (which includes the Tumut River). However, a compensating opposite transfer from the Murrumbidgee to the Murray basins is made using a different part of the Snowy Mountains Scheme.

Chinese Qing kingfisher feather tiara, circa 1851-1861AD Tian-tsui (traditional: ÈªûÁø†, simplified: ÁÇπÁø†, pinyin: di«éncu√¨, \\"dotting with kingfishers\\") is a style of Chinese art featuring kingfisher feathers. For 2,000 years, the Chinese have been using the iridescent blue feathers of kingfisher birds as an inlay for fine art objects and adornment, from hairpins, headdresses, and fans to panels and screens. While Western art collectors have focused on other areas of Chinese art including porcelain, lacquer ware, sculpture, cloisonn√©, silk and paintings, kingfisher art is relatively unknown outside of China. Kingfisher feathers are painstakingly cut and glued onto gilt silver. The effect is like cloisonn√©, but no enamel was able to rival the electric blue color. Blue is the traditional favorite color in China. As with most iridescent, electrifying colors in animals such as morpho butterfly wings, the intense color in bird feathers comes not from pigments in the feather itself, but from the way light is bent and reflected back out, much like a prism breaks white light into its spectrum of rainbow colors. These microscopic structures in feathers are called photonic crystals. The most expensive, commissioned pieces used a species of kingfisher from Cambodia. So great was the export to sate Chinese demand, the trade of feathers may have been a major contributor to the wealth of the Khmer Empire, and used to help fund the construction of the magnificent temples near Siem Reap, Cambodia including Angkor Wat. The finest pieces of kingfisher art were reserved for royalty or high-ranking Chinese government official (called a \\"mandarin (bureaucrat)\\"). The usage of kingfisher feathers resulted in the mass slaughter of many kingfisher species. Kingfisher art as a high art form came to an end during the Chinese Revolution in the 1940s.

After former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn escaped from Japan while awaiting trial on criminal charges, Mori publicly stated that he should \\"prove his innocence,\\" but later retracted the comment and apologized. She also defended Japanese interrogation and detention practices against public criticism. In February 2020, she defended the Cabinet's decision to delay the retirement of top Tokyo prosecutor Hiromu Kurokawa, which the opposition criticized as illegal. In March 2020, she apologized and retracted a comment accusing public prosecutors of fleeing from her home city of Iwaki before evacuation orders were issued amid the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami.

He was born in Florence, Italy, to Frederick Thellusson, 4th Baron Rendlesham, and his wife Elizabeth Charlotte, daughter of Sir George Prescott, 2nd Baronet, and former wife of General Sir James Duff. His mother died when he was less than one year old. In 1852, aged twelve, he succeeded in the barony on the death of his father. However, as this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords. Lord Rendlesham, about 1874 Lord Rendlesham was appointed Sheriff of Suffolk in 1870 and elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Suffolk East at a by-election in March 1874, a seat he held until the constituency was abolished at the 1885 general election. Educated in England at Eton and Oxford, he was reportedly a fine footballer at Eton and maintained a keen interest in other sports in later life, being on the National Hunt Committee as well as a member of the Jockey Club and the Royal Yacht Squadron. Failing eyesight in 1911 caused him to resign from long-held positions as chairman of the East Suffolk County Council and the Suffolk Quarter Sessions. He subsequently contracted blood- poisoning, leading to the amputation of his left hand in July 1911. Lord Rendlesham married Lady Egidia, daughter of Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton, in 1861. They had three sons and five daughters. Lady Rendlesham died in January 1880. Lord Rendlesham remained a widower until his death in November 1911, aged 71. He was succeeded in the barony by his eldest son Frederick.

Its embayment is about in length, about across at its widest point, and an average depth of about . The bay is at an elevation of 571 ft (174 m) above sea level. It is bounded on the north and west by a recurved peninsula that makes up Presque Isle State Park. On the south, the bay is edged by the urban Erie shoreline, which hosts the Port of Erie Marine Terminal, as well as an assortment of parks, tourist attractions and marinas such as the Erie Yacht Club. Fishing, water skiing, swimming, and boating, are a few examples of common activities among visitors who come to appreciate this natural bay for its sheltered waters and captivating views of Erie‚Äôs historic neighborhoods and landmarks. A small channel on the east provides a shipping lane into and out of Lake Erie. Cascade Creek, Garrison Run, Mill Creek, and surface runoff drain the lands of the Presque Isle Bay Watershed into the bay. History Commander Oliver Hazard Perry took command of America's Lake Erie naval fleet at Presque Isle in March 1813. By the end of July 1813, Perry had assembled the necessary crews and escaped a blockade of the channel exit by Commander Robert Heriot Barclay, Perry's British counterpart. With access to the lake, Perry led his fleet west to Put-in-Bay, Ohio, where the Battle of Lake Erie was fought in September 1813. Recovery After pollution of the bay caused by sewage and industrial waste forced an end to swimming and caused the appearance of tumors on brown bullheads and other fishes, Erie established the Erie Harbor Improvement Council in 1988 to seek remediation. Later called the Presque Isle Bay Public Advisory Committee, the group was instrumental in having the bay listed as one of the Great Lakes Areas of Concern (AOC) in 1991. It then pushed for the establishment of a Remedial Action Plan (RAP) in 1993, which was updated in 1995 and 2002 to make key fixes with the goal of the resumption of swimming and fishing in the bay. In 2002, the bay became the first US AOC to be awarded Recovery Stage status. A ceremonial swim by 300 swimmers was scheduled for 28 June 2008 to celebrate the recovery of the bay.

Source: Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Climate change in Australia has been a critical issue since the beginning of the 21st century.Scientists Trace Extreme Heat in Australia to Climate Change 29 September 2014 NYT Australia is becoming hotter, and more prone to extreme heat, bushfires, droughts, floods and longer fire seasons because of climate change. Since the beginning of the 20th century Australia has experienced an increase of nearly 1 ¬∞C in average annual temperatures, with warming occurring at twice the rate over the past 50 years than in the previous 50 years. Recent climate events such as extremely high temperatures and widespread drought have focused government and public attention on the impacts of climate change in Australia. Rainfall in southwestern Australia has decreased by 10‚Äì20% since the 1970s, while southeastern Australia has also experienced a moderate decline since the 1990s. Rainfall is expected to become heavier and more infrequent, as well as more common in summer rather than in winter. Water sources in the southeastern areas of Australia have depleted due to increasing population in urban areas coupled with persistent prolonged drought. A carbon tax was introduced in 2011 by the Gillard government in an effort to reduce the impact of climate change and despite some criticism, it successfully reduced Australia's carbon dioxide emissions, with coal generation down 11% since 2008‚Äì09. It was subsequently repealed by the Abbott government on 17 July 2014 in a heavily criticised move. The renewable energy target (RET), launched in 2001, was also modified. However, under the government of Malcolm Turnbull, Australia attended the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference and adopted the Paris Agreement, which includes a review of emission reduction targets every 5 years from 2020. Predictions measuring the effects of global warming on Australia assert that global warming will negatively impact the continent's environment, economy, and communities. Australia is vulnerable to the effects of global warming projected for the next 50 to 100 years because of its extensive arid and semi- arid areas, an already warm climate, high annual rainfall variability, and existing pressures on water supply. The continent's high fire risk increases this susceptibility to change in temperature and climate. Additionally, Australia's population is highly concentrated in coastal areas, and its important tourism industry depends on the health of the Great Barrier Reef and other fragile ecosystems. The impacts of climate change in Australia will be complex and to some degree uncertain, but increased foresight may enable the country to safeguard its future through planned mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation may reduce the ultimate extent of climate change and its impacts, but requires global solutions and cooperation, while adaptation can be performed at national and local levels.  Pre-instrumental climate change  Paleoclimatic records indicate that during glacial maxima Australia was extremely arid, with plant pollen fossils showing deserts as far as northern Tasmania and a vast area of less than 12% vegetation cover over all of South Australia and adjacent regions of other states. Forest cover was largely limited to sheltered areas of the east coast and the extreme southwest of Western Australia. During these glacial maxima the climate was also much colder and windier than today.Flannery, Tim, The Future Eaters: An Ecological History of the Australian Lands and People; p. 115 Minimum temperatures in winter in the centre of the continent were as much as lower than they are today. Hydrological evidence for dryness during glacial maxima can also be seen at major lakes in Victoria's Western District, which dried up between around 20,000 and 15,000 years ago and re-filled from around 12,000 years ago.Water Research Foundation of Australia; 1975 symposium: the 1973-4 floods in rural and urban communities; seminar held in August 1976 by the Victorian Branch of the Water Research Foundation of Australia. During the early Holocene, there is evidence from Lake Frome in South Australia and Lake Woods near Tennant Creek that the climate between 8,000 and 9,500 years ago and again from 7,000 to 4,200 years ago was considerably wetter than over the period of instrumental recording since about 1885.Allen, R.

The research that gave these records also suggested that the rainfall flooding Frome was certainly summer-dominant rainfall because of pollen counts from grass species. Other sourcesBourke, Patricia; Brockwell, Sally; Faulkner, Patrick and Meehan, Betty; \\"Climate variability in the mid to late Holocene Arnhem Land region, North Australia: archaeological archives of environmental and cultural change\\" in Archaeology in Oceania; 42:3 (October 2007); pp. 91‚Äì101. suggest that the Southern Oscillation may have been weaker during the early Holocene and rainfall over northern Australia less variable as well as higher. The onset of modern conditions with periodic wet season failure is dated at around 4,000 years before the present. In southern Victoria, there is evidence for generally wet conditions except for a much drier spell between about 3,000 and 2,100 years before the present,Water Research Foundation of Australia; 1975 symposium when it is believed Lake Corangamite fell to levels well below those observed between European settlement and the 1990s. After this dry period, Western District lakes returned to their previous levels fairly quickly and by 1800 they were at their highest levels in the forty thousand years of record available. Elsewhere, data for most of the Holocene are deficient, largely because methods used elsewhere to determine past climates (like tree-ring data) cannot be used in Australia owing to the character of its soils and climate. Recently, however, coral cores have been used to examine rainfall over those areas of Queensland draining into the Great Barrier Reef.Lough, J. M. (2007), \\"Tropical river flow and rainfall reconstructions from coral luminescence: Great Barrier Reef, Australia\\", Paleoceanography, 22, PA2218, . The results do not provide conclusive evidence of man-made climate change, but do suggest the following: * There has been a marked increase in the frequency of very wet years in Queensland since the end of the Little Ice Age, a theory supported by there being no evidence for any large Lake Eyre filling during the LIA. * The dry era of the 1920s and 1930s may well have been the driest period in Australia over the past four centuries. A similar study, not yet published, is planned for coral reefs in Western Australia. Records exist of floods in a number of rivers, such as the Hawkesbury, from the time of first settlement. These suggest that, for the period beginning with the first European settlement, the first thirty-five years or so were wet and were followed by a much drier period up to the mid-1860s,Warner, R. F.; \\"The impacts of flood- and drought-dominated regimes on channel morphology at Penrith, New South Wales, Australia\\". IAHS Publ. No. 168; pp. 327‚Äì338, 1987. when usable instrumental records started.  Instrumental climate records  = Development of an instrumental network = Although rain gauges were installed privately by some of the earliest settlers, the first instrumental climate records in Australia were not compiled until 1840 at Port Macquarie. Rain gauges were gradually installed at other major centres across the continent, with the present gauges in Melbourne and Sydney dating from 1858 and 1859, respectively. In eastern Australia, where the continent's first large-scale agriculture began, a large number of rain gauges were installed during the 1860s and by 1875 a comprehensive network had been developed in the \\"settled\\" areas of that state.Green, H.J.; Results of rainfall observations made in South Australia and the Northern Territory: including all available annual rainfall totals from 829 stations for all years of recording up to 1917, with maps and diagrams: also appendices, presenting monthly and yearly meteorological elements for Adelaide and Darwin; published 1918 by Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology With the spread of the pastoral industry to the north of the continent during this period, rain gauges were established extensively in newly settled areas, reaching Darwin by 1869, Alice Springs by 1874, and the Kimberley, Channel Country and Gulf Savannah by 1880. By 1885,Gibbs, W.J. and Maher, J. V.; Rainfall deciles as drought indicators; published 1967 by Australian Bureau of Meteorology most of Australia had a network of rainfall reporting stations adequate to give a good picture of climatic variability over the continent. The exceptions were remote areas of western Tasmania, the extreme southwest of Western Australia, Cape York Peninsula,Hunt, H.A. Results of rainfall observations made in Queensland: including all available annual rainfall totals from 1040 stations for all years of record up to 1913, together with maps and diagrams; published 1914 by Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology the northern Kimberley and the deserts of northwestern South Australia and southeastern Western Australia. In these areas good-quality climatic data were not available for quite some time after that. Temperature measurements, although made at major population centres from days of the earliest rain gauges, were generally not established when rain gauges spread to more remote locations during the 1870s and 1880s. Although they gradually caught up in number with rain gauges, many places which have had rainfall data for over 125 years have only a few decades of temperature records. = Climate history based on instrumental records = Australia's instrumental record from 1885 to the present shows the following broad picture: Conditions from 1885 to 1898 were generally fairly wet, though less so than in the period since 1968. The only noticeably dry years in this era were 1888 and 1897. Although some coral core data suggest that 1887 and 1890 were, with 1974, the wettest years across the continent since settlement, rainfall data for Alice Springs, then the only major station covering the interior of the Northern Territory and Western Australia, strongly suggest that 1887 and 1890 were overall not as wet as 1974 or even 2000. In New South Wales and Queensland, however, the years 1886‚Äì1887 and 1889‚Äì1894 were indeed exceptionally wet. The heavy rainfall over this period has been linked with a major expansion of the sheep populationFoley, J.C.; Droughts in Australia: review of records from earliest years of settlement to 1955; published 1957 by Australian Bureau of Meteorology and February 1893 saw the disastrous 1893 Brisbane flood. A drying of the climate took place from 1899 to 1921, though with some interruptions from wet El Ni√±o years, especially between 1915 and early 1918 and in 1920‚Äì1921, when the wheat belt of the southern interior was drenched by its heaviest winter rains on record. Two major El Ni√±o events in 1902 and 1905 produced the two driest years across the whole continent, whilst 1919 was similarly dry in the eastern States apart from the Gippsland. The period from 1922 to 1938 was exceptionally dry, with only 1930 having Australia-wide rainfall above the long-term mean and the Australia-wide average rainfall for these seventeen years being 15 to 20 per cent below that for other periods since 1885. This dry period is attributed in some sources to a weakening of the Southern OscillationAllan, R.J.; Lindesay, J. and Parker, D.E.; El Ni√±o, Southern Oscillation and Climate Variability; p. 70. and in others to reduced sea surface temperatures.Soils and landscapes near Narrabri and Edgeroi, NSW, with data analysis using fuzzy k-means Temperatures in these three periods were generally cooler than they are currently, with 1925 having the coolest minima of any year since 1910. However, the dry years of the 1920s and 1930s were also often quite warm, with 1928 and 1938 having particularly high maxima. The period from 1939 to 1967 began with an increase in rainfall: 1939, 1941 and 1942 were the first close-together group of relatively wet years since 1921. From 1943 to 1946, generally dry conditions returned, and the two decades from 1947 saw fluctuating rainfall. 1950, 1955 and 1956 were exceptionally wet except 1950 and 1956 over arid and wheatbelt regions of Western Australia. 1950 saw extraordinary rains in central New South Wales and most of Queensland: Dubbo's 1950 rainfall of can be estimated to have a return period of between 350 and 400 years, whilst Lake Eyre filled for the first time in thirty years. In contrast, 1951, 1961 and 1965 were very dry, with complete monsoon failure in 1951/1952 and extreme drought in the interior during 1961 and 1965. Temperatures over this period initially fell to their lowest levels of the 20th century, with 1949 and 1956 being particularly cool, but then began a rising trend that has continued with few interruptions to the present. Since 1968, Australia's rainfall has been 15 per cent higher than between 1885 and 1967. The wettest periods have been from 1973 to 1975 and 1998 to 2001, which comprise seven of the thirteen wettest years over the continent since 1885. Overnight minimum temperatures, especially in winter, have been markedly higher than before the 1960s, with 1973, 1980, 1988, 1991, 1998 and 2005 outstanding in this respect. There has been a marked decrease in the frequency of frost across Australia.Fewer frosts. Bureau of Meteorology. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, Australia's annual mean temperature for 2009 was 0.9 ¬∞C above the 1961‚Äì90 average, making it the nation's second- warmest year since high-quality records began in 1910.  Current effects of climate change on Australia  Protesters from the Climate Action Summit outside of Parliament House, Canberra According to the CSIRO and Garnaut Climate Change Review, climate change is expected to have numerous adverse effects on many species, regions, activities and much infrastructure and areas of the economy and public health in Australia. The Stern Report and Garnaut Review on balance expect these to outweigh the costs of mitigation.CSIRO (2006). Climate Change Impacts on Australia and the Benefits of Early Action to Reduce Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Sustained climate change could have drastic effects on the ecosystems of Australia. For example, rising ocean temperatures and continual erosion of the coasts from higher water levels will cause further bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef. Beyond that, Australia's climate will become even harsher, with more powerful tropical cyclones and longer droughts.CSIRO (2007), Climate change in Australia: Technical report 2007, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Canberra; Preston, B. and Jones, R. (2006), Climate Change Impacts on Australia and the Benefits of Early Action to Reduce Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions: A consultancy report for the Australian Business Roundtable on Climate Change, CSIRO, Canberra. The impacts of climate change will vary significantly across Australia. The Australian Government appointed Climate Commission have prepared summary reports on the likely impacts of climate change for regions across Australia, including: Queensland, NSW, Victoria and Tasmania.http://climatecommission.gov.au/resources/commission-reports/ Climate Commission reports. = Climate Commission reports = David Karoly is an Australian expert on climate change and member of the board of the Climate Change Authority. Will Steffen was the principal author of the report The Critical Decade: Extreme Weather. According to the Climate Commission (now the Climate Council) report in 2013, the extreme heatwaves, flooding and bushfires striking Australia have been intensified by climate change and will get worse in future in terms of their impacts on people, property, communities and the environment. The summer of 2012/2013 included the hottest summer, hottest month and hottest day on record. The cost of the 2009 bushfires in Victoria was estimated at A$4.4bn (¬£3bn) and the Queensland floods of 2010/2011 cost over A$5bn.The Critical Decade: Extreme Weather Climate Commission Australia.Climate change making extreme events worse in Australia ‚Äì report The Guardian 2.4.2013 By 2014, another report revealed that, due to the change in climatic patterns, the heat waves were found to be increasingly more frequent and severe, with an earlier start to the season and longer duration. The report also cited that the current heat wave levels in Australia were not anticipated to occur until 2030. All these underscored the kind of threat that Australia faces. As a developed country, its coping strategies are more sophisticated but it is the rate of change that will pose the bigger risks. = Sea level rise = Melbourne population density and low elevation coastal zones The Australian Government released a report saying that up to 247,600 houses are at risk from flooding from a sea level rise of 1.1 metres. There were 39,000 buildings located within 110 metres of 'soft' erodible shorelines, at risk from a faster erosion due to sea level rise.DCC (2009), Climate Change Risks to Australia's coasts, Canberra. Adaptive responses to this specific climate change threat are often incorporated in the coastal planning policies and recommendations at the state level. For instance, the Western Australia State Coastal Planning Policy established a sea level rise benchmark for initiatives that address the problem over a 100-year period. = Economy = In 2008 the Treasurer and the Minister for Climate Change and Water released a report that concluded the economy will grow with an emissions trading scheme in place.Australia's Low Pollution Future: The Economics of Climate Change Mitigation A report released in October 2009 by the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts, studying the effects of a 1-metre sea level rise, quite possible within the next 30‚Äì60 years, concluded that around 700,000 properties around Australia, including 80,000 buildings, would be inundated, the collective value of these properties is estimated at $155 billion.Herald Sun, \\"Victoria's Stormy Forecast\\", Oct, 28, 2009 In 2019 the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences published a report about the impact of climate change on the profitability of the Australian agriculture, saying that the profit of the Australian farms was cut by 22% due to climate change in the years 2000‚Äì2019. =Water (droughts and floods) = Bureau of Meteorology records since the 1860s show that a 'severe' drought has occurred in Australia, on average, once every 18 years. In June 2008 it became known that an expert panel had warned of long-term, maybe irreversible, severe ecological damage for the whole Murray-Darling basin if it did not receive sufficient water by October of that year.Australian rivers 'face disaster', BBC News Water restrictions were in place in many regions and cities of Australia in response to chronic shortages resulting from the 2008 drought.Saving Australia's water, BBC News In 2004 paleontologist Tim Flannery predicted that unless it made drastic changes the city of Perth, Western Australia, could become the world's first ghost metropolis‚Äîan abandoned city with no more water to sustain its population.Metropolis strives to meet its thirst, BBC News However, with increased rainfall in recent years, the water situation has improved. In 2019 the drought and water resources minister of Australia David Littleproud, said, that he \\"totally accepts\\" the link between climate change and drought in Australia because he \\"live it\\". He says that the drought in Australia is already 8 years long. He called for a reduction in Greenhouse gas emission and massive installation of renewable energy. Former leader of the nationalists Barnaby Joyce said that if the drought became more fierce and dams will not be built, the coalition risk \\"political annihilation\\". = Bushfires = In 2009, the Black Saturday bushfires erupted after a period of record hot weather resulting in the loss of 173 lives and the destruction of 1,830 homes, and the newly found homelessness of over 7,000 people. Australian Greens leader Bob Brown said that the fires were \\"a sobering reminder of the need for this nation and the whole world to act and put at a priority the need to tackle climate change\\". The Black Saturday Royal Commission recommended that \\"the amount of fuel-reduction burning done on public land each year should be more than doubled\\". In 2018, the fire season in Australia began in the winter. August 2018 was hotter and windier than the average. Those meteorologic conditions led to a drought in New South Wales. The Government of the state already gave more than $1 billion to help the farmers. The hotter and drier climate led to more fires. The fire seasons in Australia are lengthening and fire events became more frequent in the latest 30 years. These trends are probably linked to climate change. In 2019 bushfires linked to climate change created air pollution 11 times higher that the hazardous level in many areas of New South Wales. Many medical groups called to protect people from \\"public health emergency\\" and moving on from fossil fuels. Heavy smoke from fires reached Sydney delaying many flights and fires blocked roads around Sydney. The prime minister Scott Morrison experienced an hour's delay attempting to land in Sydney because of runway closures. From September 2019 to the end of January 2020, 34 people and one billion animals, possibly including entire species and subspecies died from the fires. Around 2,000 homes were destroyed. According to the United Nations Environment Programme the megafires in Australia in 2019‚Äì2020 are probably linked to climate change that created the unusually dry and hot weather conditions. This is part of a global trend. Brazil, United States, Russian federation, Democratic Republic of the Congo, face similar problems. By the second week of January the fires burned a territory of approximately 100,000 square kilometres close to the territory of England, killed one billion animals and caused big economic damage. Researchers claim that the exceptionally strong wildfires in 2019‚Äì2020, where impossible without climate change, that surely made temperature higher. More than one fifth of the Australian forests was burned in one season, what is completely unprecedented. They say that: \\"In the case of recent events in Australia, there is no doubt that the record temperatures of the past year would not be possible without anthropogenic influence, and that under a scenario where emissions continue to grow, such a year would be average by 2040 and exceptionally cool by 2060.\\". Probably climate change also caused drier weather conditions in Australia by impacting Indian Ocean Dipole what also increase fires. In average, below 2% of Australian forests burn annually. Climate change has increased the likelihood of the wildfires in 2019‚Äì2020 by at least 30%, but researchers said the result is probably conservative. Approximately 3 billion animals were killed or displaced by the bushfires in the 2019‚Äì20 Australian bushfire season what make them one of the worst natural disasters in recorded history. The chance of reaching the climatic conditions that fuels the fires became more than 4 times bigger since the year 1900 and will become 8 times more likely to occur if the temperature will rise by 2 degrees from the preindustrial level.. = Heatwaves = According to Australian Climate Council in 2017 Australia had its warmest winter on record, in terms of average maximum temperatures, reaching nearly 2 ¬∞C above average.Hot and Dry: Australia's Weird Winter BY LESLEY HUGHES 18.09.2017 Summer 2013‚Äì14 was warmer than average for the entirety of Australia. Both Victoria and South Australia saw record-breaking temperatures. Adelaide recorded a total of 13 days reaching 40 ¬∞C or more, 11 of which reached 42 ¬∞C or more, as well as its fifth-hottest day on record‚Äî45.1 ¬∞C on 14 January. The number of days over 40 ¬∞C beat the previous record of summer 1897‚Äì1898, when 11 days above 40 ¬∞C were recorded. Melbourne recorded six days over 40 ¬∞C, while nighttime temperatures were much warmer than usual, with some nights failing to drop below 30 ¬∞C. Overall, the summer of 2013‚Äì2014 was the third- hottest on record for Victoria, fifth-warmest on record for New South Wales, and sixth-warmest on record for South Australia. 2015 was Australia's fifth- hottest year on record, continuing the trend of record-breaking high temperatures across the country. Future effects of climate change on Australia Analysis of future emissions trajectories indicates that, left unchecked, human emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) will increase several fold during the 21st century. Consequently, Australia's annual average temperatures are projected to increase 0.4‚Äì2.0 ¬∞C above 1990 levels by the year 2030, and 1‚Äì6 ¬∞C by 2070. Average precipitation in southwest and southeast Australia is projected to decline during this time period, while regions such as the northwest may experience increases in rainfall. Meanwhile, Australia's coastlines will experience erosion and inundation from an estimated 8‚Äì88 cm increase in global sea level. Such changes in climate will have diverse implications for Australia's environment, economy, and public health. = Projected effects by Major Event = Bushfires Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of bushfires. Firefighting officials are concerned that the effects of climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of bushfires under even a \\"low global warming\\" scenario. A 2006 report, prepared by CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research, Bushfire CRC, and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, identified South Eastern Australia as one of the 3 most fire-prone areas in the world, and concluded that an increase in fire-weather risk is likely at most sites over the next several decades, including the average number of days when the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index rating is very high or extreme. It also found that the combined frequencies of days with very high and extreme FFDI ratings are likely to increase 4‚Äì25% by 2020 and 15‚Äì70% by 2050, and that the increase in fire-weather risk is generally largest inland.

Biodiversity and ecosystems Wetlands in Kakadu National Park Australia has some of the world's most diverse ecosystems and natural habitats, and it may be this variety that makes them the Earth's most fragile and at-risk when exposed to climate change. The Great Barrier Reef is a prime example. Over the past 20 years it has experienced unparalleled rates of bleaching. Additional warming of 1 ¬∞C is expected to cause substantial losses of species and of associated coral communities. The CSIRO predicts that the additional results in Australia of a temperature rise of between 2 and 3 degrees Celsius will be: * 97% of the Great Barrier Reef bleached annually.Jones, R.N.

Agriculture forestry and livestock Small changes caused by global warming, such as a longer growing season, a more temperate climate and increased concentrations, may benefit Australian crop agriculture and forestry in the short term. However, such benefits are unlikely to be sustained with increasingly severe effects of global warming. Changes in precipitation and consequent water management problems will further exacerbate Australia's current water availability and quality challenges, both for commercial and residential use. The CSIRO predicts that the additional results in Australia of a temperature rise of between 3 and 4 degrees Celsius will be: * 32% possibility of diminished wheat production (without adaptation).Howden, S.M., and Jones, R.N.

Water resources Healthy and diverse vegetation is essential to river health and quality, and many of Australia's most important catchments are covered by native forest, maintaining a healthy ecosystem. Climate change will affect growth, species composition and pest incursion of native species and in turn, will profoundly affect water supply from these catchments. Increased re- afforestation in cleared catchments also has the prospect for water losses.Herron, N., Davis, R., and Jones, R.N.

Settlements and infrastructure Global warming could lead to substantial alterations in climate extremes, such as tropical cyclones, heat waves and severe precipitation events. This would degrade infrastructure and raise costs through intensified energy demands, maintenance for damaged transportation infrastructure, and disasters, such as coastal flooding. In the coastal zone, sea level rise and storm surge may be more critical drivers of these changes than either temperature or precipitation. The CSIRO describes the additional impact on settlements and infrastructure for rises in temperature of only 1 to 2 degrees Celsius: *A 22% rise in 100-year storm surge height around Cairns; as a result, the area flooded doubles. * A 1% decrease in peak electricity demands in Melbourne and Sydney.Howden, S.M., and Crimp, S.

Human settlements Climate change will have a higher impact on Australia's coastal communities, due to the concentration of population, commerce and industry. Climate modelling suggests that a temperature rise of 1‚Äì2 ¬∞C will result in more intense storm winds, including those from tropical cyclones.Coleman, T. (2002) The impact of climate change on insurance against catastrophes. Proceedings of Living with Climate Change Conference. Canberra, 19 December. Combine this with sea level rise, and the result is greater flooding, due to higher levels of storm surge and wind speed. Coleman, T. (2002) The impact of climate change on insurance against catastrophes. Proceedings of Living with Climate Change Conference. Canberra, 19 December.) Tourism of coastal areas may also be affected by coastal inundation and beach erosion, as a result of sea level rise and storm events. At higher levels of warming, coastal impacts become more severe with higher storm winds and sea levels. Property A report released in October 2009 by the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the arts, studying the effects of a 1-metre sea level rise, possible within the next 30‚Äì60 years, concluded that around 700,000 properties around Australia, including 80,000 buildings, would be inundated. The collective value of these properties is estimated at $150 billion. A 1-metre sea level rise would have massive impacts, not just on property and associated economic systems, but in displacement of human populations throughout the continent. Queensland is the state most at risk due to the presence of valuable beachfront housing. = Projected effects by location = Adelaide Adelaide will get hotter and drier with rainfall predicted to decline 8% to 29% by 2090 and average temperature to increase between 4 and 0.9 degrees. The number of days above 35 degrees will increase by 50% in 2090 and the number of days above 40 degrees will double. Bringing it close to Northampton, Western Australia for temperature and Kadina, South Australia for rainfall. Sea levels will rise with predictions between 39 to 61 cm by 2090. And extreme seas are predicted to rise as well, with the CSIRO predicting buildings in Port Adelaide would need to be raised by 50 to 81 cm to keep the amount of flooding incidents the same as recorded between 1986 and 2005.  Brisbane  In a RCP 4.5 scenario Brisbane's temperature will be similar to that of Rockhampton today while rainfall will be closest to Gympie. The CSIRO predicts rainfall in Brisbane will fall between -23% (235 mm) and -4% (45.3 mm) annually by 2090 while temperature will rise between 4.2¬∞ and 0.9¬∞. The number of hot days and hot nights will double by 2050, with many people needing to avoid outdoor activity in Summer. Further urban growth increases the number of hot nights even further. Hot nights increase deaths amongst the elderly. Rainfall will be deposited in less frequent more intense rain events, fire days will also get more frequent while frost days will decrease. Sea levels are predicted to rise by 80 cm by 2100 and there will be more frequent sea level extremes.Gold Coast  Darwin  In a RCP 4.5 scenario Darwin's temperature will be similar to that of Daly River now, with its rainfall most like that of Milikapiti. In a RCP 8.5 scenario, indicating higher greenhouse gas emissions, Darwin's temperature loses any close comparison in Australia being significantly hotter than every town in Australia is today (with the exclusion of Halls Creek in Autumn). Sydney Suburbs of Sydney like Manly, Botany,Most at risk: Study reveals Sydney's climate change 'hotspots' ‚Äì ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) Narrabeen, Port Botany, and Rockdale, which lie on rivers like the Parramatta, face risks of flooding in low-lying areas such as parks (like Timbrell Park and Majors Bay Reserve), or massive expenses in rebuilding seawalls to higher levels. Sea levels are predicted to rise between 38 and 66 cm by 2090. Temperature in Sydney will increase between 0.9¬∞ and 4.2¬∞, while rainfall will decrease between -23% and -4% by 2090. Bringing Sydney's climate close to that of Beaudesert today (under a RCP 8.5 scenario). Different parts of Sydney will warm differently with the greatest impact expected in Western Sydney and Hawkesbury, these areas can expect 5 to 10 additional hot days by 2030. Similarly future rainfall patterns will be different to those today, with more rain expected to fall in summer and autumn and less expected in Winter and Spring. Fire danger days will increase in number by 2070. Melbourne Sea levels are projected to rise between 0.37 cm and 0.59 cm at Williamstown (the closest covered point) by 2090. At the higher end of this scale areas in and around Melbourne would be impacted. With some of the most vulnerable areas being the Docklands development and several marinas and berths in Port Phillip. Melbourne's climate will become similar in terms of total rainfall and average temperature to that of Dubbo today, with temperatures warming between 0.9¬∞ and 3.8¬∞ and total annual rainfall falling between -10% and -4% by 2090. Rainfall patterns will also change with 20% less rainfall predicted during spring in 2050, which may impact the severity of summer bushfires. The increases in temperature and decrease in rainfall will have a series of follow on effects on the city, including a possible 35% reduction in trees in Melbourne by 2040. And more frequent ambulance callouts and more deaths due to heatwaves. Climate change will cost Melbourne City $12.6bn by 2050. Perth In 2090 Perth is predicted to have the rainfall of Yanchep today and the temperature of Geraldton using the RCP 4.5 scenario. Rainfall is predicted to fall between -29% (-226 mm) and -8% (-66 mm) and temperature predicted to rise between 0.9¬∞ and 4¬∞. Perth may see the number of days above 35¬∞ increase from 28 per year on average to 36 in 2030, and to between 40 and 63 in 2090. While frost days will decrease. Rainfall will increase in intensity while decreasing on average. Drought days in the south west as a whole may increase by as much as 80% versus 20% for Australia. The danger from fire will increase with more fire days for all of Western Australia. Hobart By 2090 Hobart's climate will warm between 3.8¬∞ and 0.9¬∞, rainfall will decline between 4% and 10%. The temperature pattern will be similar to Port Lincoln while rainfall will be closer to Condoblin's today in a RCP 8.5 scenario. Warm spells are likely to last longer and rainfall will trend to more intense rain events dumping less rain annually, increasing the risk of erosion and flooding. Flooding on the Derwent river will become more regular and extreme with a current 1-in-100-year event being possibly a 2-to-6-year event in 2090. Hobart's fire season will get longer. Great Barrier Reef The Great Barrier Reef could be killed as a result of the rise in water temperature forecast by the IPCC. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the reef has experienced unprecedented rates of bleaching over the past two decades, and additional warming of only 1 ¬∞C is anticipated to cause considerable losses or contractions of species associated with coral communities. Lord Howe Island The coral reefs of the World Heritage-listed Lord Howe Island could be killed as a result of the rise in water temperature forecast by the IPCC. As of April 2019, approximately 5% of the coral is dead.  Action on climate change  = Adaptation = = Federal Government action =  Howard government  The Howard government was resistant to taking action to prevent global warming that would harm Australia's economy, a policy continued from the prior Keating government. In 1996 in the lead up to the Kyoto treaty this slow going attitude caused conflict with the US and EU who at that time were proposing legally binding emissions targets as part of Kyoto. Australia was unwilling to accept stricter timeframes and emissions reductions targets, such as the 20% cut (from 1990 to 2005) proposed by smaller pacific island states, because of its carbon intensive economy. Increasingly, in the lead up to the Kyoto conference, the Howard government became internationally isolated on its climate change policy. With Australia's opposition to binding targets \\"figur[ing] prominently in the prime minister's [recent] discussions in Washington and London\\" as highlighted in a Cabinet memo. In 1997 the Cabinet agreed to establish a climate change taskforce to strengthen its Kyoto bargaining position. In 1998 the Australian Government, under Prime Minister John Howard, established the Australian Greenhouse Office, which was then the world's first government agency dedicated to cutting greenhouse gas emissions, And, also in 1998, Australia signed but did not ratify the Kyoto protocols. The Australian Greenhouse Office put forward proposals for emissions reductions in 2000 (rejected in cabinet), 2003 (vetoed by Howard) and 2006 which was accepted by Howard and became the basis for his pre election emissions trading scheme proposal. Rudd government In 2007, after the first Rudd government was sworn in, the new Department of Climate Change was established under the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio and entrusted with coordinating and leading climate policy. The Kyoto protocol was ratified nine days after. The 2009 budget committed the government to a 25% reduction by 2020 on 2000 levels if \\"the world agrees to an ambitious global deal to stabilise levels of CO2 equivalent at 450 parts per million or lower by mid- century\\". In December 2009 Malcolm Turnbull the then opposition leader is unseated by Tony Abbot, voiding a speculated deal on an emissions trading scheme between the opposition and the government. This happens a day before the second rejection of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme bill by the Senate on the 2 December 2009. On 2 February the Emissions Trading Scheme legislation is introduced for the third time, it is voted down again and the Liberal party unveils its own climate mitigation legislation, the Direct Action Plan. On 27 April 2010, the Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced that the Government has decided to delay the implementation of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) until the end of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (ending in 2012). The government cited the lack of bipartisan support for the CPRS and the withdrawal of support by the Greens, and slow international progress on climate action after the Copenhagen Summit, as the reasons for the decision. The delay of the implementation of the CPRS was strongly criticised by the Federal Opposition under Abbott and by community and grassroots action groups such as GetUp. Gillard (and second Rudd) government To reduce Australia's carbon emissions, the government of Julia Gillard introduced a carbon tax on 1 July 2012, which required large businesses, defined as those emitting over 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually, to purchase emissions permits. The Carbon Tax reduced Australia's carbon dioxide emissions, with coal generation down 11% since 2008‚Äì09. Abbot government The subsequent Australian Government, elected in 2013 under then Prime Minister Tony Abbott was criticised for being \\"in complete denial about climate change\\". Abbott became known for his anti- climate change positions as was evident in a number of policies adopted by his administration. In a global warming meeting held in the United Kingdom, he reportedly said that proponents of climate change are alarmists, underscoring a need for \\"evidence-based\\" policymaking. The Abbott government repealed the carbon tax on 17 July 2014 in a heavily criticised move. The renewable energy target (RET), launched in 2001, was also modified. Turnbull government However, under the government of Malcolm Turnbull, Australia attended the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference and adopted the Paris Agreement, which includes a review of emission reduction targets every 5 years from 2020. Australia's Clean Energy Target (CET) came under threat in October 2017 from former Prime Minister Tony Abbott. This could lead to the Australian Labor Party withdrawing support from the Turnbull government's new energy policy. Climate policy continues to be controversial. Following the repeal of the carbon price in the last parliament, the Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF) is now Australia's main mechanism to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, two- thirds of the ERF's allocated $2.5 billion funding has now been spent. The ERF, and other policies, will need further funding to achieve our climate targets. Morrison government Under the Morrison Government, Australia experienced some criticism as it plans to use a carbon accounting loophole from the expiring Kyoto Protocol agreement to fulfill its (already modest) Paris commitments. According to Climate Analytics, Australia pledged in Paris to cut its emissions between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels by 2030 but it is currently on track for a 7% cut.As Fires Rage, Australia Pushes to Emit More Carbon = State =  Victoria  A protest on World Environment Day in Victoria The state of Victoria, in particular, has been proactive in pursuing reductions in GHG through a range of initiatives. In 1989 it produced the first state climate change strategy, \\"The Greenhouse Challenge\\". Other states have also taken a more proactive stance than the federal government. One such initiative undertaken by the Victorian Government is the 2002 Greenhouse Challenge for Energy Policy package, which aims to reduce Victorian emissions through a mandated renewable energy target. Initially, it aimed to have a 10 per cent share of Victoria's energy consumption being produced by renewable technologies by 2010, with 1000 MW of wind power under construction by 2006. The government legislated to ensure that by 2016 electricity retailers in Victoria purchase 10 per cent of their energy from renewables. This was ultimately overtaken by the national Renewable Energy Target (RET). By providing a market incentive for the development of renewables, the government helps foster the development of the renewable energy sector. A Green Paper and White Paper on Climate Change was produced in 2010, including funding for a number of programs. A Climate Change Act was passed including targets for 50% reduction in emissions. A recent review of this Act has recommended further changes. The supreme court of Australia stopped a logging project in Victoria because it will be particularly destructive after the bushfires. The premier of Victoria Daniel Andrews announced that by 2030 logging in the state will be banned.  South Australia  Former Premier Mike Rann (2002‚Äì2011) was Australia's first Climate Change Minister and passed legislation committing South Australia to renewable energy and emissions reduction targets. Announced in March 2006, this was the first legislation passed anywhere in Australia committed to cutting emissions. By the end of 2011, 26% of South Australia's electricity generation derived from wind power, edging out coal-fired power for the first time. Although only 7.2% of Australia's population live in South Australia, in 2011, it had 54% of Australia's installed wind capacity. Following the introduction of solar feed-in tariff legislation South Australia also had the highest per-capita take-up of household rooftop photo-voltaic installations in Australia. In an educative program, the Rann government invested in installing rooftop solar arrays on the major public buildings including the Parliament, Museum, Adelaide Airport, Adelaide Showgrounds pavilion and public schools. About 31% of South Australia's total power is derived from renewables. In the five years to the end of 2011, South Australia experienced a 15% drop in emissions, despite strong employment and economic growth during this period. In 2010, the Solar Art Prize was created by Pip Fletcher, and has run annually since, inviting artists from South Australia to reflect subjects of climate change and environmentalism in their work. Some winning artists receive renewable energy service prizes which can be redeemed as solar panels, solar hot water or battery storage systems.  Western Australia  On 6 May 2007, the Premier of Western Australia, Alan Carpenter announced the formation of a new Climate Change Office responsible to a Minister, with a plan that included: * a target to reduce emissions by at least 60% below 2000 levels by 2050 * a $36.5 million Low Emission Energy Development Fund * a target to increase renewable energy generation on the South West Interconnected System to 15% by 2020 and 20% by 2025 * a clean energy target of 50% by 2010 and 60% by 2020 * State Government purchase of 20% renewable energy by 2010 * a mandatory energy efficiency program that will require large and medium energy users to invest in cost effective energy efficiency measures * tripling the successful solar schools program so that over 350 schools will be using renewable energy by 2010 * a new $1.5 million Household Sustainability Audit and Education program that will provide practical information to households about how they can reduce greenhouse gas emissions * investing $8.625 million to help businesses and communities adapt to the impacts of climate change * the development of new climate change legislation * a commitment to establishment of a national emissions trading scheme This plan has been criticised by Greens MP Paul Llewellyn who stated that short-term programmatic targets rather than aspirational targets to greenhouse gas emissions were needed, and that renewable energy growth in the state was still being driven entirely by federal government policy and incentives, not by measures being made by the state government. = Youth Climate Movement =  Australian Student Environment Network  Australian Student Environment Network (ASEN) is a non-profit, grassroots network of student activists from universities, TAFEs and secondary schools across Australia. The network aims to create a generation of change-agents actively working to achieve environmental and social justice within the Australian and world context. The network has a strong focus on equipping young people with organising and facilitation skills and provides first-hand campaigning experience in environmental advocacy and grassroots organising. Annually, the ASEN summer training camp brings together students for one week of facilitated skill sharing, workshopping, campaign planning and strategising. ASEN has multiple campaign foci including climate change, coal mining, green jobs, campus sustainability (energy/emissions & recycled paper), nuclear power, Gold and Uranium mining and the genocide of Indigenous peoples. In addition, the network builds and lives-out alternative ideas and lifestyles through community projects such as co-operatives (food, housing and transport), on-campus permaculture gardens and by investing in community supported agriculture. = Campaigns and events =  Youth  * Adopt a Politician The AYCC supports numerous projects by harnessing the knowledge, skills and experience of its coalition member groups. In August 2007, the AYCC launched their federal election campaign \\"Adopt a Politician\\" providing young voters and non-voters a platform on which to engage with their local community on the issue and pressure their federal candidates to save their future by committing to better policies. * Switched On In October 2007, the AYCC and ASEN organised the largest gathering of young climate activists from around the country at the conference \\"Switched On\\" in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney. The conference aimed to facilitate critical thinking on climate change and its solutions, share knowledge and skills for organising around climate change and provide support and networking opportunities for the growing youth climate movement in Australia. * Kyoto In November 2007, youth delegates from the AYCC attended the Kyoto negotiations in Bali where they collaborated with other national youth networks and young climate activists from around the world. * Community awareness SYCAN-the Sydney Youth Climate Action Network was founded at OzGreen's Youth Leading Australia Congress in 2009.

In late 2006, Queensland Conservation lodged an objection to the greenhouse gas emissions from a large coal mine expansion proposed by Xstrata Coal Queensland Pty Ltd. QC's action aimed to have the true costs of the greenhouse gas emissions from coal mining recognised. The Newlands Coal Mine Expansion will produce 28.5 million tonnes of coal over its fifteen years of operation. The mining, transport and use of this coal will emit 84 million tonnes of into the atmosphere. Queensland Conservation aims to have reasonable and practical measures imposed on new mines to avoid, reduce or offset the emissions from the mining, transport and use of their coal. The Land and Resources Tribunal ruled against the case.Kathryn Roberts (16 February 2007) Mining giant wins global warming court case/ World Today.

Some Hindu texts regard Buddha as an avatar of the god Vishnu, who came to Earth to delude beings away from the Vedic religion.. List of Hindu scripture that declares Gautama Buddha as 9th Avatar of Vishnu is as follows [Harivamsha (1.41) Vishnu Purana (3.18) Bhagavata Purana (1.3.24, 2.7.37, 11.4.23 Bhagavata Purana 1.3.24 Bhagavata Purana 1.3.24 , Garuda Purana (1.1, 2.30.37, 3.15.26) Agni Purana (160.Narada Purana (2.72)Linga Purana (2.71) Padma Purana (3.252) etc. Bhagavata Purana, Canto 1, Chapter 3 - SB 1.3.24: \\"Then, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, the Lord will appear as Lord Buddha, the son of Anjana, in the province of Gaya, just for the purpose of deluding those who are envious of the faithful theist.\\" ... The Bhavishya Purana contains the following: \\"At this time, reminded of the Kali Age, the god Vishnu became born as Gautama, the Shakyamuni, and taught the Buddhist dharma for ten years. Then Shuddodana ruled for twenty years, and Shakyasimha for twenty. At the first stage of the Kali Age, the path of the Vedas was destroyed and all men became Buddhists. Those who sought refuge with Vishnu were deluded.\\" Found in Wendy O'Flaherty, Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology. University of California Press, 1976, page 203. Note also SB 1.3.28: \\"All of the above-mentioned incarnations [avatars] are either plenary portions or portions of the plenary portions of the Lord [Krishna or Vishnu]\\" He is also regarded as a prophet of Islam by the Ahmadiyyah. Hinduism Some Hindus regard Buddha as the 9th Avatar of Vishnu. Gautama Buddha is mentioned as an Avatar of Vishnu in the Puranic texts of Hinduism.Bhagavata Purana, Canto 1, Chapter 3 - SB 1.3.24: \\"Then, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, the Lord will appear as Lord Buddha, the son of Anjana, in the province of Gaya, just for the purpose of deluding those who are envious of the faithful theist.\\" ... SB 1.3.28: \\"All of the above-mentioned incarnations [avatars] are either plenary portions or portions of the plenary portions of the Lord [Krishna or Vishnu]\\" In the Bhagavata Purana he is twenty fourth of twenty five avatars, prefiguring a forthcoming final incarnation. A number of Hindu traditions portray Buddha as the most recent of ten principal avatars, known as the Dashavatara (Ten Incarnations of God). Siddhartha Gautama's teachings deny the authority of the Vedas and consequently [at least atheistic] Buddhism is generally viewed as a nƒÅstika school (heterodox, literally \\"It is not so\\"\\"in Sanskrit philosophical literature, 'ƒÅstika' means 'one who believes in the authority of the Vedas' or 'one who believes in life after death'.

(University of Calcutta: 1984). p. 5, footnote 1.) from the perspective of orthodox Hinduism. Many of the eighteen orthodox Puranas mention the Buddha in a less favouring light. They present the birth of the Buddha as a ploy by the Supreme God Vishnu to corrupt demons and sway them from Vedic teachings. Only by leading them astray with his teachings could the demons be destroyed. This belief is sometimes associated with the Asuras of Tripura (the three citadels) as well as others. Literature from the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, on the other hand, maintains that Krishna took the appearance of an atheistic teacher out of benevolence, in order to trick atheists into worshipping God (i.e., himself). Sikhism Buddha is mentioned as the 23rd avatar of Vishnu in the Chaubis Avtar, a composition in Dasam Granth traditionally and historically attributed to Guru Gobind Singh.http://www.info-sikh.com/VVPage1.html Taoism, Confucianism and Shinto Some early Chinese Taoist-Buddhists thought the Buddha to be a reincarnation of Lao Tzu.The Cambridge History of China, Vol.1, (The Ch'in and Han Empires, 221 BC‚Äî220 BC) hardback In Japan, since one of the symbols of Dainichi Nyorai (one of the non-historical buddhas of Mahayana Buddhism) was the sun, many equated Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess, with a previous reincarnation (bodhisattva) of Dainichi Nyorai. Ahmadiyyat Mirza Tahir Ahmad, the Fourth Caliph of the Ahmadiyya Community, in his book Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth, argues that Buddha was indeed a prophet of God who preached Monotheism. He quotes from the inscriptions on Ashoka's stupas which mention \\"Isa'na\\" which means God. He quotes, \\"'Thus spake Devanampiya Piyadasi: \\"Wherefore from this very hour, I have caused religious discourses to be preached, I have appointed religious observances that mankind, having listened thereto, shall be brought to follow in the right path, and give glory to God* (Is'ana).\\"Al-Islam.org Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth, Mirza Tahir Ahmad, Chapter, Buddhism. The Ahmadiyya hold the view that the Buddha was indeed a Prophet of God. Mirza Tahir Ahmad has also stated that the Qur'anic figure called Dhul-Kifl may have been the Buddha in his book \\"An Elementary Study of Islam.\\"http://www.alislam.org/books/study- of-islam/prophets.html In fact, a verse in the Qur'an quotes that God has sent many prophets to thee (Humanity). However, only a few have been named. It is believed by some that Buddha may (or may not) have been a Prophet of God sent to his people who taught Monotheism. Christianity Christ and Buddha by Paul Ranson, 1880 The Greek legend of \\"Barlaam and Ioasaph\\", sometimes mistakenly attributed to the 7th century John of Damascus but actually written by the Georgian monk Euthymius in the 11th century, was ultimately derived, through a variety of intermediate versions (Arabic and Georgian) from the life story of the Buddha. The king-turned-monk Ioasaph (Georgian Iodasaph, Arabic Y≈´dhasaf or B≈´dhasaf: Arabic \\"b\\" could become \\"y\\" by duplication of a dot in handwriting) ultimately derives his name from the Sanskrit Bodhisattva, the name used in Buddhist accounts for Gautama before he became a Buddha. Barlaam and Ioasaph were placed in the Greek Orthodox calendar of saints on 26 August, and in the West they were entered as \\"Barlaam and Josaphat\\" in the Roman Martyrology on the date of 27 November. Judaism The story was translated into Hebrew in the 13th century by Abraham Ibn Chisdai (or Hasdai) as \\"ben- haMelekh v'haNazir\\" (\\"The Prince and the Nazirite\\").

(Some Australian state herbaria continue to use the name Callistemon viminalis.) It is a multi-trunked, large shrub or tree with hard bark, often pendulous foliage and large numbers of bright red bottlebrush flowers in spring and summer. It is possibly the most commonly cultivated melaleuca in gardens and its cultivars are often grown in many countries. Description Melaleuca viminalis is a large shrub or small tree growing to tall with hard, fibrous, furrowed bark, a number of trunks and usually pendulous branches. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are long, wide, more or less flat, very narrow elliptical to narrow egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base and the other end tapering to a sharp point. The leaves have a mid-vein, 9-27 lateral veins and large number of conspicuous oil glands. The flowers are bright red and are arranged in spikes on and around the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The spikes are in diameter and long with 15 to 50 individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flower ages and the stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower. The bundles are sometimes obscure but each contains 9 to 14 stamens. Flowering occurs from September to December and often sporadically throughout the year. Flowering is followed by fruit which are woody capsules, long and in diameter. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca viminalis was first named in 2009 by Lyndley Craven in Novon when Callistemon viminalis was transferred to the present genus. Metrosideros viminalis was first formally described in 1788 by Joseph Gaertner in De Fructibus et Seminibus Plantarum. The specific epithet (viminalis) is from the Latin word vimen meaning an \\"osier\\" or \\"pliant twig\\" referring to the weeping habit of the branchlets of this species. There are two subspecies: *Melaleuca viminalis (Sol. ex Gaertn.) Byrnes subsp. viminalis which is a multi-trunked shrub or small tree growing to high and which often flowers throughout the year; *Melaleuca viminalis subsp. rhododendron Craven , a single-stemmed tree growing to high which flowers mostly in September and October, and occurs only in the Injune district in Queensland. Callistemon viminalis is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca viminalis by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs along the eastern part of Queensland from the Cape York Peninsula south to Moree and Grafton in New South Wales. There are also disjunct populations in the far north and south-west of Western Australia. It mostly grows in and along watercourses, mainly in sandstone or granite country. Ecology Melaleuca viminalis provides food for nectivores. Its adaptations to survive strong currents during flood events allow it to slow the flow of floodwater and reduce erosion, thereby improving the water quality in streams and rivers. The matted roots of this species also strengthen the soil of riverbanks, further reducing the potential for erosion. Use in horticulture A widely grown garden plant and street tree, usually known as Callistemon viminalis, Melaleuca viminalis is a hardy species in most soils when grown in full sun. It is useful as a screening plant and is suitable for planting as a street tree. It needs regular watering but can survive drought as a mature plant although it is not frost hardy and will succumb to salt spray. Many cultivars of this species have been developed as cultivars of Callistemon. They include: *C. viminalis 'Captain Cook'; *C. viminalis 'Rose Opal'; *C. viminalis 'Dawson River Weeper'; *C. viminalis 'Hannah Ray'; *C. viminalis 'Prolific'; *C. viminalis 'Hen Camp Creek'; *C. viminalis 'Wild River'.

The film boasted an ensemble cast of leading art cinema actors of Parallel Cinema,Party: A Tale Of Claustrophobia including Vijaya Mehta, Manohar Singh, Om Puri, Naseeruddin Shah, and Rohini Hattangadi. It based on the play Party (1976) by Mahesh Elkunchwar. The movie was produced by National Film Development Corporation of India (NFDC). Party was the official Indian entry to the 32nd International Film Festival of India, New Delhi, and also took part in the Tokyo Film Festival 1985 and Asia Pacific Film Festival 1985.Party 1984 at NFDC Overview Shot in real-time, lasting most of an evening, except for a few initial scenes to set the context -- which show the people invited to the party, just before the party, getting ready, looking forward to going or cribbing about having to go -- and a harrowing finale. The film is a deeply intelligent satire aimed at the urban elite ‚Äî especially those poseurs with artistic inclinations, namely establishment-artists and their patrons. It depicts their apathy towards the society at large while they get away, by the way of small talk and prosaic conversations at parties. The power of the movie derives from Elkunchwar's play ‚Äî which had a very successful run in Marathi theatres in Pune and Bombay, before Govind Nihalani turned it, with the author's active participation, into a screenplay. Nihalani had just made Ardh- Satya ‚Äî which had been a surprise break-away hit for alternative cinema (or Parallel Cinema as it is called in India) and it was easier for him to get generous financing from the government public sector company NFDC (later declared bankrupt and closed soon after the assassination of art movie aficionado Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi). There is some speculation that it was not being offered a role in this movie, and two others, which so disillusioned art house diva Smita Patil that she switched to doing mainstream Bollywood movies. Plot and technique The entire action is confined to an evening party hosted by Damyanti Rane (Vijaya Mehta), a rich middle-age widow and well-known patron of the arts in the city. All the cognoscenti of the urban milieu make a beeline to the event. The party is hosted in the honour of Diwakar Barve (Manohar Singh), a celebrated playwright, who has just been awarded the prestigious National Literary Award. There are gradual revelations in conversations between attendees of the party ‚Äî by turns catty, outraged, resigned and cynical ‚Äî that he got the award because he is Damyanti's lover, who wields political clout, or a toady of the establishment. Gradually, all the conversation gears towards the real winner, the hero-in-absentia: Amrit, an immensely talented and promising writer-poet who left the politics of the party circuit and literary societies to go live and work with the tribal community. Amrit, though not present in person, shows himself again and again in their conversations reminding them and viewers of their banality, deceit, and their utter callousness towards the inequities in society at large, which brings them at cross-purposes to the true aim of all art and artistic endeavours: the ennoblement of humanity. In a harrowing finale, which cuts to the heartland of the country, Amrit is shown to be murdered by the police as a \\"left-wing terrorist\\" approximately at the same time as the party was going on.

Whitaker is also the Chief Meteorologist on The Weather Channel, following his esteemed thirty-year career as a meteorologist with the Bureau of Meteorology. Bureau of Meteorology Whitaker began working with the Bureau of Meteorology in 1971, aged twenty-four. A decade later, he was promoted to the role of Officer in Charge of the Facilities and Information section of the Bureau. He held this position for three years, before being promoted again to Senior Operational Forecaster in the Sydney bureau, Australia's largest. In 1984, he was presented with an Australia Day Achievement Award for his work in the field of meteorology. In 1992, Whitaker became the New South Wales Manager for Special Services, dealing with exceptional circumstances and disaster recovery operations. He retired from the Bureau in 2002 after thirty-one years. During the final years of his tenure at the Bureau, between 1999 and 2001 Whitaker worked with the World Meteorological Organisation as a rapporteur for the Committee of Agricultural Meteorology. Research and developments Whitaker is partly credited with the initial development of precipitation charts for the Australian mass media. Such charts are now used throughout the print and electronic media to convey data about present and future rainfall in graphical form. In his second year at the Bureau of Meteorology, 1972, he developed and authored a manual for aviation forecasting in the state of New South Wales, still used today. Whitaker also researched the correlation between sea surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean and rainfall in Australia, which is now used as a routine consideration in the production of seasonal rainfall outlooks.

Having become the first ship to pass through the Suez Canal, she was sold in 1881 and renamed Pandora II. She was purchased again in about 1890 and renamed Blencathra, taking part in expeditions to the north coast of Russia. She was bought in 1912 by Georgy Brusilov for use in his ill-fated 1912 Arctic expedition to explore the Northern Sea Route, and was named Svyataya Anna (Russian: –°–≤—è—Ç–∞—è –ê–Ω–Ω–∞), after Saint Anne. The ship became firmly trapped in ice; only two members of the expedition, Valerian Albanov and Alexander Konrad, survived. The ship has never been found. Design The Philomel-class gunvessels were an enlargement of the earlier Algerine-class gunboat of 1856. The first six of the class were ordered by the Admiralty from the naval dockyards between April 1857 and April 1859. Another twelve were ordered on 14 June 1859 to be constructed by contract in private yards, receiving their names on 24 September the same year; these were then fitted out at naval dockyards. The last eight of the class, of which Newport was the first, were ordered on 5 March 1860 for construction in naval dockyards, although six of them were later cancelled.Winfield, p.222 Construction Newport was laid down at Pembroke Dockyard in Wales on 17 September 1860. She and Alban were suspended in 1862, and six of the uncompleted vessels, including Alban were cancelled in 1863. She was finally launched on 20 July 1867. She was fitted with a Laird Brothers two-cylinder horizontal single-expansion steam engine driving a single screw and developing . She was armed with a 68-pounder 95 cwt muzzle-loading smooth-bore gun, two 24-pounder howitzers and two 20-pounder breech-loading guns. All ships of the class later had the 68-pounder replaced by a 7-inch/110-pounder breech-loading gun. The class were fitted with a barque-rigged sail plan. Survey ship Svyataya Anna before departing for her last trip.She was commissioned in April 1868 under Commander George Strong Nares, and employed in survey work in the Mediterranean. In 1869 during the opening ceremony and first passage of ships through the Suez Canal, although the French Imperial yacht L'Aigle was officially the first vessel to pass through the canal, HMS Newport, commanded by Nares, actually passed through it first. On the night before the canal was due to open, Nares navigated his vessel, in total darkness and without lights, through the mass of waiting ships until it was in front of L'Aigle. When dawn broke the French were horrified to find that the Royal Navy was now first in line and that it would be impossible to pass them. Captain Nares received both an official reprimand and an unofficial vote of thanks from the Admiralty for his actions in promoting British interests and for demonstrating such superb seamanship. Pandora II She was sold to Sir Allen Young in May 1881. He has previously owned another ex-Philomel-class gunvessel, HMS Pandora, and he named his new ship Pandora II after her. Blencathra The ship was sold in about 1890 to the wealthy F W Leyborne-Popham, who intended to use her as a yacht, and had an interest in Arctic waters. The vessel was specially adapted at the Richmond Dry Dock in Appledore, where an ice-ram was fitted and her quarter-deck extended. Leybourne-Popham appointed Joseph Wiggins as captain of Blencathra for an 1893 voyage to the Kara Sea and into the Yenisei River, thus taking the ship to the furthest reaches of Siberia. To combine business with pleasure, he formed a syndicate to exploit the commercial opportunities offered by the carriage of cargo to the far north. As plans were being finalised, Wiggins received an urgent request from the Russians to carry rails for the Trans- Siberian Railway up the Yenisey to Krasnoyarsk. A 2,500-ton steamer, Orestes, was chartered and four Russian river vessels were provided for the final stages of transport in the Yenisey. With the river vessels embarked in Orestes, and Blencathra in company, the group left Vard√∏ on 22 August 1893, reaching the mouth of the Yenisey on 3 September. Blencathra and Orestes returned to England via Arkhangel, while Wiggins stayed with the Russian river vessels, reaching Yeniseysk on 23 October. Among the party was Miss Helen Peel, granddaughter of Sir Robert Peel, who wrote a book about her experiences entitled Polar Gleams. Leybo rne-Popham sold his yacht to Major Andrew Coats, and in company with William Speirs Bruce, Coats made a long hunting voyage to the Arctic waters around Novaya Zemlya and Spitsbergen.With the yachts Blencathra and Princesse Alice to the Barents and Greenland seas, Scottish Geographical Magazine, 1899. Vol 15, pp. 113-126. Bruce joined Blencathra at Troms√∏, Norway in May 1898, and the cruise explored the Barents Sea, the dual islands of Novaya Zemlya, and the island of Kolguyev, before a retreat to Vard√∏ to re-provision for the voyage to Spitsbergen. In a letter Bruce reported, \\"This is a pure yachting cruise and life is luxurious\\". Nevertheless, the scientific purpose of the voyage was not forgotten; measurement of temperature & salinity and meteorological observations went on day and night.Speak, Peter: William Speirs Bruce NMS Publishing, Edinburgh 2003 1912 Arctic expedition A geological feature in the Arctic Ocean basin, the St. Anna or Svyataya Anna Trough, located east of Franz Josef Land, with a depth of 620 m, has been named in memory of this ill-fated ship.

The site of the last mill now lies in the private grounds of Mereworth Castle. In 1460, it was held by Thomas Hunte. In 1521 it was a fulling mill, belonging to Sir Thomas Nevyle. In 1772 James Pound was the occupant, followed by his widow in March 1780 and John Pound in September 1780. He was at the mill until October 1791. Thomas Edmead was at the mill from 1792-1827. The mill was purchased by Viscount Falmouth c.1856. The mill was demolished by 1907 and the site is today marked by a waterfall at the eastern end of the lakes in the grounds of Mereworth Castle. The head would have been some or , suggesting a high breast shot or overshot waterwheel. =Mill at Wateringbury= The Domesday Book records three mills at Otringeberge (Wateringbury). Two mills were held by Ralf, son of Turald and valued at 3/-, a third was held by Hugh de Braibourne and worth 16d. This mill was marked on C & G Greenwood's map of Kent, 1822. It was not mentioned in a survey of the parish carried out in 1828. =Brattle (Upper) Mill, Wateringbury= TQ 686 534 Brattle mill c.1910Brattle Mill was a corn mill. It was named after a miller, Robert Brattle. It was first mentioned in 1783 and was owned by Robert Brattle. In 1838 the mill was owned by Harry Blaker and occupied by William Mills. Harry Blaker died c.1848 and the mill was run for a short time by his widow, Sarah. James Fremlin took over the lease of the mill by 1851, also running Warden Mill. He purchased the mill from Sarah Blaker c.1868. The miller at this time being Alfred Bloorman. The original overshot waterwheel was of wood. It was replaced by a turbine c.1910 and it was about this time the mill was last used for milling, then being used to generate electricity. Brattle Mill was sometimes known as Upper Mill. A diameter by wide cast iron overshot waterwheel from Lower Mill, Polegate, Sussex, was reconstructed at the mill in the early 1980s and the owner intended to reconstruct the machinery to return the building to a working mill. The mill originally worked three pairs of millstones.Sussex Mills Group =Warden Mill, Wateringbury= TQ 690 532 Warden Mill was a corn mill that took its name from the farm to which it belonged, Warden Farm. The first reference to this mill was in November 1822, when John Savage of Cobham leased the mill from John Selby of Marden and John Fellow of Eynsford. In October 1829 James Fremlin took over the lease. Selby and Fellow(s) held the freehold of the mill until October 1838. In 1839 the area of the mill pond was given as ¬æ acre. Charles Whittaker was the owner of the mill in 1842 and by April 1845 Whittaker and Fremlin were joint owners, but by November 1847 the mill had passed back to John Selby. James Fremlin purchased a moiety of the property in October 1871. He purchased the other share in the property in December 1876. Richard Clemetson took over the mill between 1878 and 1887, followed by William James Hawes sometime between 1890 and 1895. The mill last worked in 1913 and was demolished c.1914.

Possible water power site Swanton Valley pond A site close to the source of the Wateringbury Stream shows some characteristic signs of previous use of waterpower. =Swanton, Mereworth= TQ 646 539 A large pond high in the Swanton valley may indicate the site of an old furnace mill. The head available being sufficient to power a large overshot waterwheel. Holy Well TQ 676 532 The Wateringbury Stream flows past a group of cottages in Pizien Well Road, Wateringbury. It is sometimes said that the name Pizien may be a corruption of 'poison', however it could also have its origins in the French language because in French entomology, 'piz' means breast and 'ien' means 'from' hence 'from the breast'. This latter explanation could tie up with local superstition that says a bride would drink the water from the well to ensure fertility - perhaps a belief that a bride would be drinking from the breast of the earth, originating from Norman times.

Nicknamed \\"Dog Boats\\", they were designed to combat the known advantages of the German E-boats over previous British coastal craft designs. They were bigger than earlier MTB or motor gunboat (MGB) designs (which were typically around 70 feet) but slower, at 30 knots compared to 40 knots. Unlike the Fairmile B designs, the Dog Boats were only produced in component form in Britain. Some were built for the RAF's Marine Branch for use in the long range air-sea rescue for downed airmen. 229 boats were built between 1942 and 1945. Many versions were produced or converted from existing boats; MGB, MTB, MA/SB, LRRC and post-war FPB. Since the Fairmile D could be fitted out with a mix of armament that gave it the capabilities of both a motor gunboat and a motor torpedo boat, the MGB designation was dropped. Two captured boats were put in Kriegsmarine service. Today the D-type is a popular choice among boat modelers.

Thus, Israel sent Beaufort instead; Beaufort was eventually included in the five final nominees. Plot The eight men of the Alexandria Ceremonial Police Orchestra arrive in Israel from Egypt. They have been booked by an Arab cultural center in Petah Tikva, but through a miscommunication (Arabic has no \\"p\\" sound, and regularly replaces it with \\"b\\"), the band takes a bus to Beit Hatikva, a fictional town in the middle of the Negev Desert. The Egyptians encounter a few Israeli townspeople, who respond with curiosity about the band, are variously friendly and wary, and provide them with shelter, food, music and companionship during their visit. There is no transportation out of the city that day, and there are no hotels for them to spend the night in. The band members dine at a small restaurant where the owner, Dina (Ronit Elkabetz) invites them to stay the night at her apartment, at her friends' apartment, and in the restaurant. No one quite falls in love, but a sense of unspoken longing and loneliness is expressed.

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times selected it as one of the 20 best films of 2008. According to Ebert, \\"The Band‚Äôs Visit has not provided any of the narrative payoffs we might have expected, but has provided something more valuable: An interlude involving two 'enemies,' Arabs and Israelis, that shows them both as only ordinary people with ordinary hopes, lives, and disappointments. It has also shown us two souls with rare beauty.\\" Gabai's characterization and playing of Tawfiq Zacharya was hailed by critics, who described him as \\"an actor of real skill, and an artist capable of the deepest understanding of the human condition.\\" During the Israeli Film Academy Awards in September 2007, Bakri, \\"the band's handsome young trumpet player\\" thanked his parents and said, \\"I want to thank my father, who taught me to love mankind, and my mother, who taught me to bear the burden of life in this country and stand strong,\\" he said.

It was attached to Pacific Command. The division had a brigade sent to the Aleutian Islands Campaign, particularly at Kiska, but never saw action. The 6th Division was to have been part of a proposed Commonwealth Corps, formed for a planned invasion of Japan, but was disbanded in 1945, after the war was ended by the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. History The 6th was raised as part of a home-defence scheme in Canada, the culmination of various mobilizations throughout 1941 and 1942. The 6th was raised in March 1942 with its headquarters on Vancouver Island in British Columbia. Various composite units were stationed at Port Alberni, Vancouver Island and Vernon. Throughout 1943, the division lost its artillery units to coastal defence work, and other battalions were shipped overseas. In June 1943, these units were sent to Kiska only to find the island abandoned, and in late 1943, the 7th Canadian Infantry Division was disbanded and various battalions were amalgamated into the 6th. By January 1944, the units had returned from Kiska, having not taken part in any fighting. On 1 December 1944, the need for coastal defence having lessened, it was decided that the division should be disbanded. However, planning for a proposed Allied invasion of Japan called for a Canadian division to be a component of a combined Commonwealth Corps. Disbandment of the 6th halted and it was re-formed as the main component of the Canadian Army Pacific Force, with the inclusion of units that served with other divisions. The re-formed division was commanded by Major General Bert Hoffmeister and its primary units were named after the components of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division. However, its battalions were to be organized along the lines of a US Army infantry division and would be equipped primarily with US-made weapons, vehicles and equipment. Following the surrender of Japan, the division's disbandment continued. The remaining units were disbanded by 31 January 1945.

It is a small town located near the Lohian Khas-Nakodar - Ludhiana line in Punjab. This town is also connected with the nearby towns of Phillaur and Nakodar by a road going along the railway lines. Nurmahal is situated 13 km from Nakodar, 33 km from Jalandhar. Many villages are close by to Nurmahal.  History  Nurmahal was built on a place where an ancient town, called Kot Kahlur, was located which was proven by the bricks and many coins found beneath the soil of this town. It is believed that the ancient city was abandoned or destroyed around 1300 for an unknown reason. Maharaja Jassa Singh Ahluwalia took this city under his control. Nurmahal is named after Noor Jahan, the wife of Mughal emperor Jahangir (1605‚Äì1627) as she was brought up here, and is thought to have spent her childhood here. The town then came under the rule of Talwan Rajputs and Ahluwalia Sikhs before the East India Company gained control.  Sarai Nurmahal  Major point of tourist interest in Nurmahal is the Mughal Serai constructed by Noor Jahan. It is a striking example of oriental architecture. This historical monument is looked after by the Archaeological Department. The whole structure of the sarai is in the form of quadrangle consisting of 140 cells, spread over the four sides of the structure. The best way to reach Serai Nurmahal is to go to Nakodar Junction, which is the nearest railway station. The junction is served by the Northern Railways.

As of January 2020 it had 19 wrestlers. It has been led by former sekiwake Tochinowaka Kiyotaka since 2003. It was one of the most successful stables in 2013, with six sekitori wrestlers, including the Georgian Tochinoshin and the now retired Japanese born (but Korean national) Tochinowaka Michihiro, who used the current head coach's old ring name. It was founded in the mid 18th century by a wrestler named Kasugano Gunpachi. It became inactive for a long time but was led in the Meiji period by a referee named Kimura Soshiro (this is no longer allowed as oyakata must now be former wrestlers). He adopted as his son the 27th yokozuna Tochigiyama, who led the stable for over thirty years. He in turn adopted as his son the 44th yokozuna Tochinishiki, who became the head in 1959 whilst still an active wrestler and later served as the chairman of the Japan Sumo Association. Tochinoumi took over upon Tochinishiki's death in 1990 and led the stable until his retirement in 2003. The stable absorbed Mihogaseki stable in 2013 when its stablemaster (former ≈çzeki Masuiyama Daishir≈ç II) reached the mandatory retirement age. Kasugano Oyakata was warned by the Sumo Association in 2011 after he beat three of his charges with a golf club for breaking a curfew. In a separate case, a junior wrestler was convicted in 2014 of an assault on another wrestler and given a three year jail sentence, suspended for four years. In March 2017 the victim sued Kasugano Oyakata and the now retired assailant, saying he was still suffering from the effects of the broken jaw he received and that Kasugano failed to exercise appropriate oversight. Ring name conventions Many wrestlers at this stable take ring names or shikona that begin with the character Ê†É (read: tochi), in deference to the long line of owners who have used this character in their shikona. It originally referred to Tochigi Prefecture, where Tochigiyama came from, but subsequent owners were not from there and the prefix no longer has a geographical meaning.

Early career Born of Irish stock, as a young boy John Cleave went to sea and is first documented for his political activities as late as 1828, in London, working to assist Henry Hetherington at the Civil & Religious Association.  Printer, bookshop and coffee shop owner  A few years later in 1831 Cleave was a printer at Snow Hill in London then at Shoe Lane where he also operated a bookshop and coffee house alongside his printing business. Cleave was now working on The Poor Man's Guardian along with Henry Hetherington and James Watson.  His own newspaper  In 1834 he felt ready to start his own newspaper Cleave's Weekly Police Gazette which as well as reporting on recent crimes also contained a political campaigning and reform element within its pages, a combination that was very successful, being sold to over 40,000 avid readers per week by 1836.  Campaigner to sell more newspapers  Cleave was refusing to pay stamp duty on his newspaper, in line with other radical publishers and pamphleteers, which of course brought him into conflict with the authorities who levied fines and wanted such seditious radicals imprisoned. It was the view of radical publishers that a free press was vital to social, political and moral improvement and that the government were oppressing the people's firmly held beliefs and rights to communicate. The law was gradually reformed and the fourpenny tax on newspapers was reduced to one-penny and pamphlets had their tax removed altogether.  Chartism  Also in 1836 Cleave joined forces with William Lovett and Henry Hetherington to form the new London Working Men's Association. He was soon to be closely involved in the National Charter Association too, and was its first Treasurer. In 1837 Cleave accompanied Henry Vincent, a gifted younger orator and emerging Chartist leader, on a speaking tour of northern England where the two men initiated the establishment of Working Men's Associations in northern cities such as Leeds, Kingston upon Hull, and towns such as Bradford, Halifax and Huddersfield. The two men formed strong bonds during this time and Henry Vincent was later to marry Cleave's daughter Lucy in 1841.  The 1840s  In the 1840s as the National Charter Association divided over policy differences and the careers of the early leaders ran their differing courses Cleave sided with the moderate moral force Chartists alongside William Lovett and continued to work for universal suffrage and the complete removal of stamp duty from all newspapers until his death in 1847.

History  During different humanitarian experiences throughout the first Gulf war, and the Balkan war between 1991 and 1997, TSF‚Äôs founders realised that in addition to healthcare and food there was a real need for telecommunications in emergency contexts. In order to meet this need, TSF was founded in 1998 and officially started its operations in the field with its first mission during the Kosovo war to offer satellite phone calls to the refugees fleeing the conflict. During the following years, TSF expanded its operations supporting also the actors working in the aftermath of humanitarian crises. In 2001 the first telecommunication centre was established in Afghanistan to help international NGOs active in the area with satellite internet communication systems. Between 2003 and 2006 TSF opened two regional offices in Thailand and Nicaragua (the current regional office for the Americas opened in Mexico in 2016) and became a partner of two international clusters in humanitarian aid: the Directorate- General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) and the Emergency Telecoms Cluster (ETC) founded by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and supervised by UNICEF, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (currently ETC is led by WFP, the World Food Programme). Organisation TSF has its headquarters in Pau (France) and two regional offices in Bangkok (Thailand) and Guadalajara (Mexico). Two TSF representatives are also located in Washington D.C. and London to support TSF‚Äôs partnership development activities. The governance of the organisation is ensured by a Board of Directors, which defines and approves the strategic direction and the financial budgets. It ensures that TSF's actions are in line with the mission and the values of TSF. The members of the Board are: * Mr. Jean-Fran√ßois Cazenave - President * Mr. Robert Chassagnieux - Vice-President * Mr. Jean- Claude Laurent - General Secretary * Mr. Fran√ßois Meyer - Treasurer * Ms. Christiane Constant - Non-executive board member * Mr. Daniel Nataf - Non- executive board member  Activities  TSF‚Äôs main areas of intervention include disaster response, capacity building, education, bridging the digital divide and protection and assistance. * Disaster response: in the aftermath of natural disasters or humanitarian crises, TSF sets up satellite phone call services and internet connection to the affected populations and the other humanitarian actors active in the emergency. * Capacity Building: TSF organises training activities for local governments, iNGOs, and other international bodies to train them on the use of technologies in emergencies. * Education: TSF implements projects to provide education opportunities through digital technologies to children in areas affected by conflicts or humanitarian crises. * Bridging the digital divide: TSF creates ICT centres in unconnected areas to provide different kinds of ICT services, such as internet connection and different digital skills training programmes, to the local population, including schools, health organisations, NGOs and other local associations. * Protection and assistance: TSF implements activities to assist victims of prolonged situations of instability and crises, caused by climate change, natural disasters or conflicts. These activities include telediagnosis, early warning systems, mHealth, food security, data collection and SMS alerting.  Expertise  * Emergency call centre (TECC): Telecommunication system that enables the use of IP-based communications in humanitarian emergency situations. * Instant Network mini: Satellite-based GSM base station developed by TSF and Vodafone Foundation to set up temporary mobile networks in emergency situations. * mLearning kit: The kit consists of Android tablets, a low-consumption server of digital educational content (Raspberry Pi), a laptop and a Wi-Fi router to share the connection and create the network.

It stars Jos√© Sacrist√°n, Federico Luppi, Leonor Benedetto and Cecilia Roth.. The drama won numerous awards and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but was declared ineligible and removed from the final ballot because it had been submitted by Uruguay, which had exercised insufficient artistic control over the film. It is the only film so far to have been disqualified from the Foreign Language Film category after having secured a nomination. Synopsis The story is set in the return of the democracy to Argentina. While they live their lives, the characters argue about the country's most controversial subjects at the time: religion, politics, and human rights. Cast * Jos√© Sacrist√°n as Hans * Federico Luppi as Mario * Leonor Benedetto as Nelda * Cecilia Roth as Ana * Rodolfo Ranni as Andrada * Hugo Arana as Zamora * Gast√≥n Batyi as Ernesto * Lorena del R√≠o as Luciana * Mario Alarc√≥n as Juan Critical reception Critic Mick LaSalle, film critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, liked the film and wrote, \\"A Place in the World is a sensitive, beautifully made coming-of-age story, set against a backdrop of Argentine politics played out on a local scale. Featuring a cast of strong characters, all driven by their deepest beliefs and passions, this is that rare case of a film that's not just lovely -- it's lively, too.\\"LaSalle, Mick. San Francisco Chronicle, film review, July 21, 1995. Last accessed: February 18, 2008. Film critic James Berardinelli wrote, \\"The acting is uniformly strong, with all the principal and secondary performers delivering believable portrayals. Celia (sic: Cecilia) Roth is especially worthy of mention for the emotion she projects through her eyes. She and Federico Luppi are perfectly matched. A Place in the World offers a frank, somewhat unusual view of the relationships that form families and communities. Although the film has a lot more meat to chew on than that, the issues presented by A Place in the World would not generate the same degree of interest without the characters who argue about and live them. It's hard to deny the effectiveness of this marriage between personalities and ideology where neither eclipses the other.\\"Berardinelli, James. Berardinelli Reviews, 1994. Last accessed: February 18, 2008. Oscar controversy A Place in the World, which was registered for the Golden Globes as an entry from Argentina alone, was originally submitted in the fall of 1992 to Argentina's Oscar selection committee as a possible contender. However, the committee chose (by one vote) to submit The Dark Side of the Heart instead. A Place in the World's director Adolfo Aristarain then asked Antonio Mercader, Uruguay's Minister of Education and Culture, to submit the film as a Uruguayan entry. After the minister refused, Aristarain took the matter to Manuel Martinez Carril, director of the Cinematheque of Uruguay, who agreed to sponsor the film for submission to the Academy's foreign-language film committee. When the nominations were announced by the Academy on February 17, 1993, A Place in the World was initially included among the five nominees, and was presented as a Uruguayan submission. However, a week later, the Academy launched an investigation after it was revealed that the film was almost entirely Argentine with minimal input from Uruguayan artists. It was disqualified three days later, with the Academy saying it was essentially an Argentine production and that this violated the Academy's rules which require that there be \\"substantial filmmaking input from the country that submits the film\\". There have only been a small number of times in the Academy's history that a film was disqualified after being nominated.http://mentalfloss.com/article/73722/8-oscar-nominations-were- revoked One previous case was that of the documentary Young Americans (1967), which had won the Academy Award for Documentary Feature but was later ruled ineligible after it was revealed that it had opened theatrically prior to the Academy's eligibility period. The disqualification of A Place in the World was all the more unusual as the Academy decided not to replace it with another film, leaving only four films in competition. Aristarain, who argued that the film was an international co-production between Uruguay and Argentina, contested the Academy's decision, and filed suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California on March 4. Aristarain cited the precedents set by Black and White in Color (1976), Le Bal (1983) and Dangerous Moves (1984), all of which were French productions but which were submitted, respectively, by Ivory Coast, Algeria and Switzerland. After the judge determined that, while Academy procedures may have been lax, the organization had essentially followed its rules, Aristarain decided not to take the case to appeal, as ballots were already being mailed to voters and the awards ceremony was about to take place. Because of the controversy surrounding A Place in the World's disqualification, the Academy adopted in the summer of 1993 new guidelines aimed at clarifying its eligibility rules for the Foreign Language Film category, and especially at making more specific the role played by each crew member. It is also worth mentioning that in its November 2001 press release listing the foreign language submissions to the 74th Academy Awards, the Academy announced that a film from Uruguay (In This Tricky Life) had \\"qualified this year for the first time\\", thereby omitting any mention of A Place in the World.

Signal propagation delay  A special type of packet (test packets) is transmitted from station A (node A) to station B (node B). As time the packet travels through space per meter is known (from physical laws), the difference in time from when it was sent from the transmitter and received at the receiver can be calculated. This time delay is known as the signal propagation delay.  Processing delay  Station A now expects an acknowledgement from Station B. A station takes a known amount of time to process the incoming test packet, generate an acknowledgement (ack packet), and prepare it for transmission. The sum of time taken to process this acknowledgement is known as processing delay.  Calculating the range  The acknowledgement sent back to station A includes in its header those two delay values ‚Äì the signal propagation delay and the processing delay. A further signal propagation delay can be calculated by Station A on the received acknowledgement, even as this delay was calculated on the test packet. These three values can then be used by an algorithm to calculate the range between these two stations.  Verifying the range calculation  To verify that the range calculation was accurate, the same procedure is repeated by station B sending a test packet to station A and station A sending an acknowledgement to station B. At the end of this procedure, two range values are determined and an average of the two can be used to achieve a fairly accurate distance measurement between these two stations.

He founded Eric-Campbell in 1919, Silver Hawk in 1920, Invicta in 1925 and Railton in 1933. In 1939 he founded Fairmile Marine and supplied boats to the Royal Navy throughout World War II, for which effort he was honoured with a knighthood. He was the father of sports car and Formula One racing driver Lance Macklin. Early life and education Macklin was born in Western Australia, the eldest son of Charles Campbell Macklin (1866‚Äì1918), barrister, and his wife, Ada Louisa, n√©e Lockyer (1863/4‚Äì1935). The family had moved to Wimbledon, London by 1891 and Macklin was educated at Eton College. He was a successful amateur jockey; from 1908-1910 he represented England and the Princes Ice Hockey Club at ice hockey and in 1909 he raced a Mercedes at Brooklands. In February 1914 he led an expedition to film big game in the Sudan. Career =World War 1= Macklin was commissioned into the Royal Field Artillery in 1914, where he served as a captain in the Royal Horse Artillery in the First World War, but was badly wounded in France and invalided out in 1915. Thus he joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) and further served with the Dover Patrol. On his transfer to the RNVR he enlisted Violette Cordery as his driver. =Car manufacture= Macklin was co- founder of the Eric-Campbell car manufacturer in 1919, whose name was a portmanteau of the second names of the founders, thus Campbell. By 1920 Macklin focussed his interest in his new, short lived, Silver Hawk car marque. In 1925 he founded the Invicta car manufacturer (with financial backing from Oliver Lyle) which traded until circa 1935, although by 1933 he was focussed on his new Railton marque. =Boat manufacture= After achieving some fame as a designer of sporty motor cars he turned his attention to motor boats. The Fairmile Engineering Company took its name from Macklin's country estate, Cobham Fairmile in Surrey, where he used the garage for manufacturing and assembly. In 1939, inspired by an article on the need for small boats for the Royal Navy he founded Fairmile Marine for the design and serial manufacture of small naval boats for the Admiralty. Since the company did not have the necessary capital to meet the Admiralty needs it became a semi-independent department of the Admiralty coordinating the supply of parts to build the vessels at boatyards around the country. For the loss of his company Noel was paid a large sum and given a salary. Fairmile boats provided the Royal Navy with motor boats, gun boats and torpedo boats throughout the Second World War. =WW2 administration= As the war came to the end Macklin was made Director for the disposal of the small boats in RN service. Family life In March 1912 Macklin married Esm√© Victoria (b. 1887), daughter of Hinton Stewart of Strathgarry, Perthshire, but they were divorced in 1919. His second marriage was to (Lucy) Leslie Cordery (1896‚Äì1980), the sister of his RNVR driver Violette Cordery. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography notes that Lucy's name was variously given as Leslie Lane Cordery and Leslie Cordery Lane, daughter of Henry Lane, farmer. The marriage produced two daughters and a son, Lance Macklin the Formula 1 Racing driver. Honours After the war Macklin was knighted for his war effort, although the Admiralty did not return his Cobham site which they had requisitioned. See also *Violette Cordery - sister-in-law.

Poppe was an advocate for the frequent reception of the sacraments and established a children's league dedicated to the Eucharist; he was a strong critic of Marxism and materialism as well as rampant secularism in his region. He was also a dedicated pastor who was strong in his support for the rights of the common laborer and people in Ghent came to love him for all the positive work he did. But his time in Ghent came to close due to ill health which forced him to move though he was an extensive writer during his illnesses. Poppe's beatification cause commenced on 5 April 1966 under Pope Paul VI and he became titled as a Servant of God as a result while the affirmation of his life of heroic virtue saw Pope John Paul II name him as Venerable on 30 June 1986. That same pope beatified Poppe in Saint Peter's Square on 3 October 1999. Life =Childhood and education= Edward Joannes Maria Poppe was born in Temse on 18 December 1890 as the third of eight children to the baker D√®sir√® Aloies Poppe (25.12.1851-10.01.1907) and Josepha Ogiers (31.08.1863-21.10.1947). One brother became a priest while five sisters were nuns and one daughter remained home alone with her mother; his siblings were: * Juliette Poppe (29.12.1886-24.07.1918) * Eug√©nie Poppe (01.01.1888-23.09.1969) * Madeleine Poppe (13.07.1895-06.04.1979) * Leonie Poppe (28.06.1898-25.08.1934) * Josef Poppe (10.10.1899-08.05.1992) * Maria Poppe (12.03.1903-12.06.1958) * Suzanne Poppe (05.09.1904-25.11.1980) He was an energetic child and an excellent student. His mischievousness saw him often knock things over even putting himself at risk of being harmed. He was also quite stubborn and never left his sisters alone though his sisters would often get back at him and would muss up his hair when he was caught combing in front of the mirror. He was also a big eater and liked to devour treats from his father's store. But in 1902 he received his First Communion and Confirmation and this made him more serious which meant jokes and teasing became rarer. In spring 1904 his father introduced him to his business plans and had hoped to see his son begin a baking apprenticeship though Poppe remained silent at first though his resolution to become a priest led him to tell his father as much. Not long after a priest friend to his parents gave a favorable opinion of Poppe's vocation to which his father told his mother: \\"Let's not be selfish. God has not given us our children for ourselves\\". He studied at the Sint-Niklaas St. Joseph Minor Seminary from 1905 until 1910 where he became a member the De Klauwaerts association which was a student movement in the Flemish Movement before World War I. Despite his father's death on 10 January 1907 he was able to continue his studies and went commence his ecclesial studies in 1910 to become a priest. But at first he wanted to take over his father's business though his mother did not like the idea and told him: \\"Before he died, Papa made me promise to let you continue with your studies. I want to keep that promise\\". He was drafted in September 1910 and being a seminarian made him a target for harassment (he was mocked and provoked) while his companions' vulgar nature was unendurable to him to what he called \\"a hell\\". He was also quite pained that he could not receive the Eucharist and go to Mass each week due to the service. But his time in the service still allowed for him to do his philosophical studies. He liked to read poems which was something he had done since his childhood. He began his studies in Thomism on 13 March 1912 at the Catholic University of Leuven where he became influenced by the works of Louis de Montfort which made him a fervent devotee of the Blessed Mother of God. It was also around this time that he learnt about Th√©r√®se of Lisieux but he also had a love for Francis of Assisi. In September 1913 he moved to the Major Seminary of Ghent for his studies where he became a member of the Filioli Caritatis which was a group of priests who aimed for holiness. On 14 July 1913 he graduated in letters and philosophical studies at Louvain. The outbreak of World War I in 1914 saw Poppe called to arms as a battlefield nurse on 1 August but he fell ill in Namur at Bourlers on 25 August after having been at the battle site since 4 August. He was placed half-dead in an ambulance van and was taken to Bourlers where the priest Castelain took care of him until December. In his period of recuperation the Germans advancing had with them several prisoners of war and he appealed to Saint Joseph that these men be freed which led to their miraculous freeing all except a Frenchman; Poppe renewed the appeal and the Frenchman returned. Father Castelain also told him about the life of Antoine Chevrier. Once he recovered he went to Mechelen to continue with his ecclesial studies in April 1915 after Cardinal D√©sir√©-Joseph Mercier obtained for him a dispensation to leave the armed forces. =Priesthood= On 1 May 1916 he was ordained to the priesthood. His motto was \\"Accendatur\\" in reference to Luke 12: 49. Poppe became the parish associate pastor in Sint-Coleta on 16 June 1916 which was a poor laborers' parish in Ghent. He started the Eucharistic League for the children (he dedicated this to Pope Pius X) and introduced them to the countless aspects of the faith and also taught catechism and handed children devotional cards. He also made it a practice to greet workers after their shifts ended in the late afternoon. Poppe also chose to live in poorness in order to be like his parishioners. He became exhausted in July 1917 due to his manner of living and his weak health and so was transferred to a convent in Moerzeke. He was ordered to rest for a month though when he returned the pastor was concerned for him so discharged him from league meetings and catechetical lessons; this made him heartbroken but he was obedient. He was often confined to his bed but from there wrote numerous texts for the \\"Eucharistische Kruistocht\\") of the Averbode convent while often appearing in the popular adolescent magazine Zonneland. In July 1918 he asked the Bishop of Ghent for a different post and so from 4 October 1918 until 1922 he served as the rector to the Vincentian Sisters. But Poppe suffered a severe heart attack on 11 May 1919 (and received the Extreme Unction) though spent his time recovering in his bed while writing letters and articles that were criticisms of materialism and Marxism. He suffered a much more serious heart attack on 8 June and could no longer have visits or celebrate Mass due to the severe status of his health. He was weak but recovered over the next several months to the point where he managed to make a trip to visit the tomb of Th√©r√®se of Lisieux in France on 15 September 1920. =Declining health and death= Improvement in his health saw him appointed as the spiritual leader of the armed forces school in Leopoldsburg in October 1922 for seminarians and priests drawn into service. But a cardiac crisis in 1923 - while visiting his mother on Christmas - made it impossible for him to return to Leopoldsburg and he again was confined to the Moerzeke convent. He suffered a heart attack on 1 January 1924 but suffered a severe relapse on 3 February. Poppe died from a stroke on the morning of 10 June 1924 as he prepared to dress and take care of affairs. He received the Extreme Unction and gazed at an image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus as he died. =Post-mortem= Cardinal D√©sir√©-Joseph Mercier promoted him as an ideal of a good priest who was spiritual and ascetic and who was prepared to sacrifice his life for the faith. His birth house in Temse has become a museum and the street is renamed \\"Priester Poppestraat\\"; another museum can be found in the Moerzeke convent. There are statues of Poppe in both Moerzeke and Ghent. Beatification The beatification process opened in Ghent in an informative process that spanned from 21 March 1946 until its closure on 29 September 1952 at which stage the theologians approved all his spiritual writings on two instances on 13 February 1959 and 15 January 1971. The formal introduction to the cause came under Pope Paul VI on 5 April 1966 and he was titled as a Servant of God while an apostolic process was later held from 18 November 1967 until 25 June 1969. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the previous processes in Rome on 28 April 1975 and received the Positio dossier from postulation officials in 1984. The theologians approved the cause on 25 March 1986 as did the C.C.S. on 10 June 1986. The confirmation of his life of heroic virtue on 30 June 1986 allowed for Pope John Paul II to title him as Venerable. One miracle was required for his beatification which had to be a healing that science could not explain and account for. One such miracle was investigated in the diocese of its origin from 4‚Äì19 January 1996 at which stage all documentation was sent to Rome and received C.C.S. validation in a decree on 28 June 1996. Medical experts approved this healing as a miracle on 6 November 1997 as did the theologians on 31 March 1998 and the C.C.S. members on 1 July 1998. John Paul II issued his approval to this miracle on 3 July 1998 and beatified Poppe in Saint Peter's Square on 3 October 1999.

They were the representatives of the royal jurisdiction over a town and its district. He was the highest authority of a corregimiento. In the Spanish Americas and the Spanish Philippines, a corregidor was often called an alcalde mayor. They began to be appointed in fourteenth century Castile. Development in Spain The idea of appointing crown officials to oversee local affairs was inspired by the late-medieval revival of Roman law. The goal was to create an administrative bureaucracy, which was uniformly trained in the Roman model. In spite of the opposition of council towns and the Cortes (Parliament), Castilian kings began to appoint direct representatives in towns during fourteenth century. They were also called jueces del salario or alcaldes veedores but the term corregidor prevailed. The word regidor often means town councillor in the Spanish language. Thus, co-regidor was the position intended to co-rule the town together with elected councillors. The first monarch to make extensive use of corregidores was Alfonso X, who ascended to the throne at the age of eleven. In order to consolidate royal authority and reward the newer nobility and certain great magnates who supported him he greatly expanded the use of the office. Some bishops and local lords were given the right to appoint corregidores in their territories. Henry used them mostly in Andalusia, the Basque provinces and Galicia, areas where royal power was weakest. The definitive consolidation of the institution occurred during the reign of the Catholic Monarchs (1474‚Äì1516). Corregidores were crucial for the state building process that both monarchs ushered in. Their job was to collect taxes, to report to the crown on the state of affairs in the area, and to ensure that royal jurisdiction was not interfered with by members of the church or the nobility. From 1480 onward, they‚Äîand all subsequent Spanish monarchs‚Äînever again appointed a noble corregidor and instead relied exclusively on commoners with legal training to fill this office.Harold, A History of Spain, 189. As representatives of the royal power, corregidores administered justice, both criminal and civil, in the first instance (or in appeal in districts with alcaldes ordinarios), presided over the town council and ruled a district called a corregimiento. They were audited and controlled through the juicio de residencia (a general audit and review at the end of their term in office) or by means of visitas (literally, 'visits'; more accurately, 'inspections'), which could occur at any point in their term in response to complaints. The corregimiento became the basic unit of state administration in early modern Spain. After the War of Succession, the new Bourbon kings introduced them into the Aragonese territories, replacing the bailes and vegueres, who, nevertheless, had very similar functions to Castilian corregidores. Introduction into the Americas and the Philippines The institution was established also in Spanish America during the conquest and the Spanish Philippines, where it were also known by the names justicia mayor and alcalde mayor (not to be confused with the alcaldes ordinarios of the cabildo). In Indian areas the office was known as the corregidor de indios. Corregidores essentially had the same powers and duties as governors (gobernadores), except that whereas the latter ruled over a province-sized area (called variously a gobernaci√≥n or a provincia), the corregidor administered a district-sized corregimiento. The corregidores were introduced in the mid-16th century to replace the encomiendas, which had become a source of autonomous power for the settlers. It was a decades-long process. The corregidores were given this privileged position either due to having influential families in Spain, or through paying the crown and in return being appointed. The reformed Audiencia of New Spain began implementing them in the 1530s, but they were not successfully set up in the Viceroyalty of Peru until the administration of Toledo. As the encomiendas were phased out, corregidores oversaw most of the local repartimientos. Corregidores were the pillar for the crown, and the system of colonial domination. whether it was a cacique or another representative that was used by the Spanish: as a broker between the indigenous Indians, and the Spanish conquerors, they answered to these corregidores. As a crown appointed official, they were served as a intermediary within the crown, the viceroy who was the top of the colonial administration, and of the riches of the Americas. The corregidores ensured that the product of indigenous labor such as farming, mining, sweatshop produce and other production would be handed to the Spanish. The corregidores also served to manage the demands of landowners and merchants, who were eager to take the maximum amounts of profits from indigenous labor. One huge issue was that the indigenous population, due to demands from the higher ups, could not reach the large quotas and were dying due to newly brought diseases from the Europeans that they were not immune to, as well being overworked, and the brutality that the European colonizers conducted. Appointed by the crown, the corregidores served as the crown official, overseer, account taker, negotiator, and slave driver. The corregidores was known to be the wealthiest, most powerful and most hated official in the colony. By law neither corregidores nor governors (nor viceroys, for that matter) could be persons who resided in the district in which they ruled, so that they should not develop ties to the locality, such that they remain disinterested administrators and judges. For this reason, they were also forbidden to marry in their district, although they could apply for exemptions from this restriction. However, in reality, they largely became enmeshed with local society, especially through financial ties, since their pay was based on a proportion of local royal revenues, and this was often an insufficient amount to cover living costs, much less the costs incurred in traveling to America. Corregidores often invested in the local economy, received loans from locals, and could abuse the reparto de comercio monopoly they oversaw, which often led to corruption. Nominally, under the viceroys, the long distances from the viceregal and even provincial capitals meant that most corregidores acted independently. Therefore, since their office held both police power (as the main local administrative institution) and judicial power (as the court of first instance) in rural areas, corregidores were very powerful persons. Because most of the corregidores in the Americas were not legally trained, they were assisted by lawyers who served as their asesores, or \\"advisers.\\" If their district were large enough to require it, they were further assisted by subordinate delegates, called tenientes (lieutenant corregidores). In municipal areas with a cabildo, corregidores were to work with the council‚Äîfor example, they recorded the annual election of alcaldes ordinarios and other council officers‚Äîbut they could not hear cases in the first instance, which was the duty of the alcaldes ordinarios. In these cases, corregidores functioned as the first court of appeals, instead. With the Bourbon Reforms of the late 18th century, most corregidores were replaced by the more powerful intendants.

This singular attribute might then be emphasized more than the generic, all-encompassing term \\"storm god\\", though with thunder/lightning gods, the two terms seem interchangeable.

It is similar, but not identical, to contrapposto, and features figures often in a spiral pose. Early examples can be seen in the work of Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael and Michelangelo. Emil Maurer writes of the painter and theorist Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo (1538‚Äì1600): \\"The recommended ideal form unites, after Lomazzo, three qualities: the pyramid, the \\"serpentinata\\" movement and a certain numerical proportion, all three united to form one whole. At the same time, precedence is given to the \\"moto\\", that is, to the meandering movement, which should make the pyramid, in exact proportion, into the geometrical form of a cone.\\" The Laoco√∂n group Bousquet holds that the \\"serpentinata\\" style arose as a result of the discovery of the Laoco√∂n group in 1506, and its deep impact on all artists, but on Michelangelo in particular. John Shearman also argues that it was invented by Michelangelo, citing the \\"Victors\\" that he produced for Pope Julius II's tomb. Maurer, on the other hand, can only detect this style rarely in Michelangelo's work and cites Beccafumi instead as its pioneer. Beccafumi's student Marco Pino connected Beccafumi's style with those of Salviati, Parmigianino and perhaps even Michelangelo, and his work as a whole is marked by \\"serpentinata\\" motifs. Paolo Pino himself says in his Dialogo della Pittura, that his figures' poses are many and varied, and that in all his works to find one single figure, that completely and utterly distorts, is ambivalent and difficult. As Maurer writes, painters are freer than sculptors and less closely tied-down to nature. Thus, they can play around with their figures, reshaping, overstretching, geometricising, dissolving, caricaturing, colouring, meandering, according to the painting's goal and intended effect. With the loosening of the norms of the Renaissance art and the development of the \\"Serpentita\\" style, that style's structures and rules began to be systematised. A style of form began by which figures showed physical power, passion, tension and semantic perfection. Movements were not without motivation, nor even simply done with a will, but with will shown in a pure form. Also their actions arose not out of power, but powerlessness. The style exerted an influence even into the 1620s, with Bernini's The Rape of Proserpina.

The novel is a historical double biography of Post-Impressionist painter Paul Gauguin and his grandmother Flora Tristan, one of the founders of feminism. The book is divided into 22 chapters, each alternating narratives of Flora Tristan and Paul Gauguin, the grandson she never knew as he was born after she died. Flora Tristan, illegitimate daughter of a wealthy Peruvian man and a French woman, is repelled by sex, detests her husband, and abandons him to then later fight for women's and workers' rights. The story of Paul Gauguin unfolds along a similar quest for an ideal life. Gauguin abandons his wife and children, and job as a stock-broker in Paris, to pursue his passion for painting. In the process he does his best to distances himself from European civilization, fleeing to Tahiti and French Polynesia for inspiration. The contrasts and similarities between two lives attempting to break free from conventional society present a long, elegant development. Translations Written in Spanish the English translation was by Natasha Wimmer and was published by Faber and Faber in 2004. The French translation by Albert Bensoussan is called Le Paradis, un peu plus loin. It has also been translated into German by Elke Wehr as Das Paradies ist anderswo.

He also played for the Great Britain national team between 1961 and 1966. He was inducted into the British Ice Hockey Hall of Fame in 1987. Career Born in Falkirk, (Scotland), Imrie began playing senior ice hockey for the Falkirk Lions in the Scottish National League as a forward before he settled on defence during the first season of the British National League in 1954-55\\\\. The following season, the Lions opted to play amateur ice hockey so Imrie joined the Edinburgh Royals for the 1955-56 season. He helped them to win the Northern British League in the 1957-58 season. For the 1959-60 season, Imrie joined the Paisley Pirates. However, he was posted to southern England during his National Service and therefore finished the season with Streatham, helping them to win both the Autumn Cup and the league title. After Streatham also opted out of ice hockey, Imrie went on to play for the Brighton Tigers, initially as captain and then as player-coach. With the Tigers, Imrie was named to the all-star teams a total of six times, both as a player and coach. Imrie then joined the Wembley Lions after the Tigers' rink closed in 1965. Imrie retired from playing when the Wembley Lions folded in 1969. When Streatham reformed in 1974 as the Redskins, Imrie became the team coach and guided them to many playoff finals, including his last season behind the bench in 1985. After his retirement, Imrie continued to work with the Streatham second team, the Bruins, and he became a colour commentator for BBC television.

Hammerschmidt took a law degree in Vienna in 1827. He also studied medicine, with an emphasis on anesthesiology, and served until 1848 as the editor of the Landwirtschaftliche Zeitung, an agricultural newspaper published in Vienna. After the Revolution of 1848, Hammerschmidt fled Vienna to fight under the Polish general J√≥zef Bem. Along with other revolutionaries from Hungary, he entered Turkey, and soon thereafter was employed as a teacher of medicine, zoology, and mineralogy in the medical school of Constantinople. Austria demanded that Turkey deport him, whereupon Hammerschmidt moved to Damascus, where he worked as a hospital physician. He served in the Turkish army during the Crimean War. In 1873, Hammerschmidt joined the faculty of medicine in Istanbul, teaching geology, mineralogy, and zoology. He founded the Natural History Museum of the Imperial Medical School of Constantinople, and was among the founders of the Turkish Red Crescent. Hammerschmidt converted to Islam and assumed the name \\"Abdullah Bey.\\" He died in 1874 in the course of geological surveys for a new railway in Anatolia.

Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the creation of new blood vessels in the choroid layer of the eye. Choroidal neovascularization is a common cause of neovascular degenerative maculopathy (i.e. 'wet' macular degeneration) commonly exacerbated by extreme myopia, malignant myopic degeneration, or age-related developments. Causes CNV can occur rapidly in individuals with defects in Bruch's membrane, the innermost layer of the choroid. It is also associated with excessive amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). As well as in wet macular degeneration, CNV can also occur frequently with the rare genetic disease pseudoxanthoma elasticum and rarely with the more common optic disc drusen. CNV has also been associated with extreme myopia or malignant myopic degeneration, where in choroidal neovascularization occurs primarily in the presence of cracks within the retinal (specifically) macular tissue known as lacquer cracks. Symptoms CNV can create a sudden deterioration of central vision, noticeable within a few weeks. Other symptoms which can occur include colour disturbances, and metamorphopsia (distortions in which straight lines appears wavy). Hemorrhaging of the new blood vessels can accelerate the onset of symptoms of CNV. CNV may also include the feeling of pressure behind your eye. Identification CNV can be detected by using a type of perimetry called preferential hyperacuity perimetry. On the basis of fluorescein angiography, CNV may be described as classic or occult. Two other tests that help identify the condition include indocyanine green angiography and optical coherence tomography. Treatment CNV is conventionally treated with intravitreal injections of angiogenesis inhibitors (also known as \\"anti-VEGF\\" drugs) to control neovascularization and reduce the area of fluid below the retinal pigment epithelium. Angiogenesis inhibitors include pegaptanib, ranibizumab and bevacizumab (known by a variety of trade names, such as Macugen, Avastin or Lucentis). These inhibitors slow or stop the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), typically by binding to or deactivating the transmission of vascular endothelial growth factor ('VEGF'), a signal protein produced by cells to stimulate formation of new blood vessels. The effectiveness of angiogenesis inhibitors has been shown to significantly improve visual prognosis with CNV, the recurrence rate for these neovascular areas remains high. CNV may also be treated with photodynamic therapy (PDT) coupled with a photosensitive drug such as verteporfin (Visudyne). The drug is given intravenously. It is then activated in the eye by a laser light. The drug destroys the new blood vessels, and prevents any new vessels forming by forming thrombi. A Cochrane Review published in 2016 found that people with severe myopia (short-sightedness or near-sightedness) may benefit from being given anti-VEGF treatment.

The Proto-Indo-European homeland (or Indo-European homeland) was the prehistoric urheimat of the Indo-European languages ‚Äì the region where the proposed common ancestor of those languages, the Proto-Indo-European language (PIE), was originally spoken. From this region, its speakers migrated east and west, and went on to form the proto-communities of the different branches of the language family. The most widely accepted proposal about the location of the Proto-Indo-European homeland is the steppe hypothesis, which puts the archaic, early and late PIE homeland in the Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe around 4000 BC. The leading competitor is the Anatolian hypothesis, which puts it in Anatolia around 8000 BC. A notable third possibility, which has gained renewed attraction due to recent aDNA research, is the Armenian hypothesis which situates the homeland for archaic PIE south of the Caucasus. Several other explanations have been proposed, including the outdated but historically prominent North European hypothesis, the Neolithic creolisation hypothesis, the Paleolithic Continuity Theory, the Arctic theory, and the \\"Indigenous Aryans\\" (or \\"Out of India\\") hypothesis. These are not widely accepted, or are considered to be fringe theories. The search for the homeland of the Indo- Europeans began in the late 18th century with the rediscovery of the Indo- European language family. The methods used to establish the homeland have been drawn from the disciplines of historical linguistics, archaeology, physical anthropology and, more recently, human population genetics. Hypotheses = Main theories = The steppe model, the Anatolian model, and the Near Eastern (or Armenian) model, are the three leading solutions for the Indo-European homeland. The steppe model, placing the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) homeland in the Pontic-Caspian steppe around 4000 BC, is the theory supported by most scholars. According to linguist Allan R. Bomhard (2019), the steppe hypothesis proposed by archeologists Marija Gimbutas and David W. Anthony \\"is supported not only by linguistic evidence, but also by a growing body of archeological and genetic evidence. The Indo-Europeans have been identified with several cultural complexes existing in that area between 4,500‚Äî3,500 BCE. The literature supporting such a homeland is both extensive and persuasive [...]. Consequently, other scenarios regarding the possible Indo-European homeland, such as Anatolia, have now been mostly abandoned,\\" although critical issues such as the way the proto-Greek, proto-Armenian, proto-Albanian and proto- Anatolian languages became spoken in their attested homeland are still debated inside the steppe model. The Anatolian hypothesis proposed by archeologist Colin Renfrew places the pre-PIE homeland in Anatolia around 8000 BC, and the homeland of Proto-Indo-European proper in the Balkans around 5000 BC, with waves of linguistic expansion following the progression of agriculture in Europe. Although it has attracted substantive attention and discussions, the datings it proposes are at odds with the linguistic timeframe for Proto-Indo- European and with genetic data, which do not find evidence for Anatolian origins in the Indian genepool. In general, the prestige associated with a specific language or dialect and its progressive dominance over others can be explained by the access to a natural resource unknown or unexploited until then by its speakers, which is thought to be horse-based pastoralism for Indo- European speakers rather than crop cultivation. A notable third possibility, which has gained renewed attention since the 2010s, is the \\"Near Eastern model\\", also known as the Armenian hypothesis. It was proposed by linguists Tamaz V. Gamkrelidze and Vyacheslav Ivanov in the early 1980s, postulating connections between Indo-European and Caucasian languages based on the disputed glottalic theory and connected to archaeological findings by Grogoriev. Some recent DNA-research has led to renewed suggestions of a Caucasian or Iranian homeland for archaic or 'proto-proto-Indo-European' (also called 'Indo-Anatolian' or 'Indo-Hittite' in the literature), the common ancestor of both Anatolian languages and early proto-IE (from which Tocharian and all other early branches split-off), though these suggestions are also disputed by some other recent genetic and linguistic research which instead locates the origin of the ancestor of proto-Indo-European in the Eastern European/Eurasian steppe or from a hybridization of both steppe and Caucasian languages. = Outlier theories = A number of other theories have been proposed, most of which have little or no academic currency today (see discussion below): * Modern nationalist doctrines: **Indigenous Aryans, which suggests a homeland in the Indian subcontinent in the 6th millennium BC, and is favored by Hindu nationalists **Arctic theory, with a 6th millennium BC or later origin in Northern Europe, according to Lothar Kilian's and, especially, Marek Zvelebil's models of a broader homeland, which is favored by European and white ethnonationalists * Paleolithic Continuity Theory, with an origin in the Upper Paleolithic * Nikolai Trubetzkoy's theory of Sprachbund origin of Indo-European traits Theoretical considerations Traditionally homelands of linguistic families are proposed based on evidence from comparative linguistics coupled with evidence of historical populations and migrations from archaeology. Today, genetics via DNA samples is increasingly used in the study of ancient population movements. =Reconstructed vocabulary= Through comparative linguistics it is possible to reconstruct the vocabulary found in the proto-language, and in this way achieve knowledge of the cultural, technological and ecological context that the speakers inhabited. Such a context can then be compared with archaeological evidence. This vocabulary includes, in the case of (late) PIE, which is based on the post-Anatolian and post-Tocharian IE-languages: * pastoralism, including domesticated cattle, horses, and dogs * agriculture and cereal cultivation, including technology commonly ascribed to late-Neolithic farming communities, e.g., the plow * a climate with winter snow\\"The Indo-Europeans knew snow in their homeland; the word sneigwh- is nearly ubiquitous.\\" * transportation by or across water * the solid wheel used for wagons, but not yet chariots with spoked wheels Zsolt Simon notes that, although it can be useful to determine the period when the Proto-Indo-European language was spoken, using the reconstructed vocabulary to locate the homeland may be flawed, since we do not know whether Proto-Indo- European speakers knew a specific concept because it was part of their environment or because they had heard of it from other peoples they were interacting with. =Uralic, Caucasian and Semitic borrowings= Proto-Finno- Ugric and PIE have a lexicon in common, generally related to trade, such as words for \\"price\\" and \\"draw, lead\\". Similarly, \\"sell\\" and \\"wash\\" were borrowed in Proto-Ugric. Although some have proposed a common ancestor (the hypothetical Nostratic macrofamily), this is generally regarded as the result of intensive borrowing, which suggests that their homelands were located near each other. Proto-Indo-European also exhibits lexical loans to or from Caucasian languages, particularly Proto-Northwest Caucasian and Proto- Kartvelian, which suggests a location close to the Caucasus. Gramkelidze and Ivanov, using the now largely unsupported glottalic theory of Indo-European phonology, also proposed Semitic borrowings into Proto-Indo-European, suggesting a more southern homeland to explain these borrowings. According to Mallory and Adams, some of these borrowings may be too speculative or from a later date, but they consider the proposed Semitic loans *t√°wros 'bull' and *w√©yh‚ÇÅon- 'wine; vine' to be more likely. Anthony notes that those Semitic borrowings may also have occurred through the advancement of Anatolian farmer cultures via the Danube valley into the steppe zone. =Genesis of Indo- European languages= Phases of Proto-Indo-European According to Anthony, the following terminology may be used: * Archaic PIE for \\"the last common ancestor of the Anatolian and non-Anatolian IE branches\\"; * Early, or Post-Anatolian, PIE for \\"the last common ancestor of the non-Anatolian PIE languages, including Tocharian\\"; * Late PIE for \\"the common ancestor of all other IE branches\\". The Anatolian languages are the first Indo-European language family to have split off from the main group. Due to the archaic elements preserved in the Anatolian languages, they may be a \\"cousin\\" of Proto-Indo-European, instead of a \\"daughter\\", but Anatolian is generally regarded as an early offshoot of the Indo-European language group. The Indo- Hittite hypothesis postulates a common predecessor for both the Anatolian languages and the other Indo-European languages, called Indo-Hittite or Indo- Anatolian. Although PIE had predecessors, the Indo-Hittite hypothesis is not widely accepted, and there is little to suggest that it is possible to reconstruct a proto-Indo-Hittite stage that differs substantially from what is already reconstructed for PIE. Anthony (2019) suggests a derivation of the proto-Indo-European language mainly from a base of languages spoken by Eastern European Hunter-Gatherers living at the Volga steppes, with influences from languages spoken by northern Caucasus hunter-gatherers who migrated from the Caucasus to the lower Volga basin, in addition to a possible later influence from the language of the Maikop culture to the south (which is hypothesized to have belonged to the North Caucasian family) in the later Neolithic or Bronze Age involving little genetic impact. Dating the split-offs of the main branches Using a mathematical analysis borrowed from evolutionary biology, Don Ringe and Tandy Warnow propose the following tree of Indo-European branches: * Pre-Anatolian (before 3500 BC) * Pre-Tocharian * Pre-Italic and Pre-Celtic (before 2500 BC) * Pre-Armenian and Pre-Greek (after 2500 BC) * Pre-Germanic and Pre-Balto-Slavic; proto-Germanic c. 500 BC * Proto-Indo- Iranian (2000 BC) David Anthony, following the methodology of Ringe and Warnow, proposes the following sequence: * Pre-Anatolian (4200 BC) * Pre- Tocharian (3700 BC) * Pre-Germanic (3300 BC) * Pre-Italic and Pre-Celtic (3000 BC) * Pre-Armenian (2800 BC) * Pre-Balto-Slavic (2800 BC) * Pre-Greek (2500 BC) * Proto-Indo-Iranian (2200 BC); split between Iranian and Old Indic 1800 BC Steppe hypothesis =Gimbutas' Kurgan hypothesis= In the early 1980s, a mainstream consensus had emerged among Indo-Europeanists in favour of the \\"Kurgan hypothesis\\" (named after the kurgans, burial mounds, of the Eurasian steppes) placing the Indo-European homeland in the Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe of the Chalcolithic. This was not least due to the influence of the Journal of Indo-European Studies, edited by J. P. Mallory, that focused on the ideas of Marija Gimbutas and offered some improvements. Gimbutas had created a modern variation on the traditional invasion theory in which the Indo-Europeans were a nomadic tribe in Eastern Ukraine and Southern Russia and expanded on horseback in several waves during the 3rd millennium BC. Their expansion coincided with the taming of the horse. Leaving archaeological signs of their presence (see Corded Ware culture), they subjugated the peaceful European Neolithic farmers of Gimbutas' Old Europe. As Gimbutas' beliefs evolved, she put increasing emphasis on the patriarchal, patrilineal nature of the invading culture, sharply contrasting it with the supposedly egalitarian, if not matrilineal culture of the invaded, to the point of formulating essentially a feminist archaeology. Her interpretation of Indo-European culture found genetic support in remains from the Neolithic culture of Scandinavia, where DNA from bone remains in Neolithic graves indicated that the megalith culture was either matrilocal or matrilineal, as the people buried in the same grave were related through the women. Likewise, there is a tradition of remaining matrilineal traditions among the Basque, a people whose language and culture is widely supposed to be descended from a pre indo-european relict. =Archaeology= The Gimbutas-Mallory Kurgan hypothesis seeks to identify the source of the Indo-European language expansion as a succession of migrations from the Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe, originating in the area encompassed by the Sredny Stog culture (c. 4500 BC).Mallory 1989, p.185 J. P. Mallory, dating the migrations later, to c. 4000 BC, and putting less insistence on their violent or quasi-military nature, essentially modified Gimbutas' theory making it compatible with a less gender-political narrative. David Anthony, focusing mostly on the evidence for the domestication of horses and the presence of wheeled vehicles, came to regard specifically the Yamna culture, which replaced the Sredny Stog culture around 3500 BC, as the most likely candidate for the Proto-Indo-European speech community. Anthony describes the spread of cattle-raising from early farmers in the Danube Valley into the Ukrainian steppes in the 6th‚Äì5th millennium BC, forming a cultural border with the hunter-gatherers whose languages may have included archaic PIE. Anthony notes that domesticated cattle and sheep probably didn't enter the steppes from the Transcaucasia, since the early farming communities there were not widespread, and separated from the steppes by the glaciated Caucasus. Subsequent cultures developed in this area which adopted cattle, most notably the Cucuteni- Trypillian culture. Parpola regards the Tripolye culture as the birthplace of wheeled vehicles, and therefore as the homeland for Late PIE, assuming that Early PIE was spoken by Skelya pastoralists (early Sredny Stog culture) who took over the Tripolye culture at c. 4300‚Äì4000 BC. On its eastern border lay the Sredny Stog culture (4400‚Äì3400 BC), whose origins are related to \\"people from the east, perhaps from the Volga steppes\\". It plays a central role in Gimbutas' Kurgan hypothesis, and coincides with the spread of early PIE across the steppes and into the Danube valley (c. 4000 BC), leading to the collapse of Old Europe. Hereafter the Maykop culture suddenly arose, Tripolye towns grew strongly, and eastern steppe people migrated to the Altai mountains, founding the Afanasevo culture (3300 to 2500 BC). =Vocabulary= The core element of the steppe hypothesis is the identification of the proto-Indo- European culture as a nomadic pastoralist society that did not practice intensive agriculture. This identification rests on the fact that vocabulary related to cows, to horses and horsemanship, and to wheeled vehicles can be reconstructed for all branches of the family, whereas only a few agricultural vocabulary items are reconstructable, suggesting a gradual adoption of agriculture through contact with non-Indo-Europeans. If this evidence and reasoning is accepted, the search for the Indo-European proto-culture has to involve searching for the earliest introduction of domesticated horses and wagons into Europe. Responding to these arguments, proponents of the Anatolian hypothesis Russell Gray and Quentin Atkinson have argued that the different branches could have independently developed similar vocabulary based on the same roots, creating the false appearance of shared inheritance ‚Äì or alternatively, that the words related to wheeled vehicle might have been borrowed across Europe at a later date. Proponents of the Steppe hypothesis have argued this to be highly unlikely, and to break with the established principles for reasonable assumptions when explaining linguistic comparative data. Another source of evidence for the steppe hypothesis is the presence of what appears to be many shared loanwords between Uralic languages and proto- Indo-European, suggesting that these languages were spoken in adjacent areas. This would have had to take place a good deal further north than the Anatolian or Near Eastern scenarios would allow. According to Kortlandt, Indo-Uralic is the pre-PIE, postulating that Indo-European and Uralic share a common ancestor. According to Kortlandt, \\"Indo-European is a branch of Indo-Uralic which was radically transformed under the influence of a North Caucasian substratum when its speakers moved from the area north of the Caspian Sea to the area north of the Black Sea.\\" Anthony notes that the validity of such deep relationships cannot be reliably demonstrated due to the time-depth involved, and also notes that the similarities may be explained by borrowings from PIE into proto-Uralic. Yet, Anthony also notes that the North Caucasian communities \\"were southern participants in the steppe world\\". =Genetics= Three genetic studies in 2015 gave support to the Kurgan theory of Gimbutas regarding the Indo-European Urheimat. According to those studies, Y chromosome haplogroups R1b and R1a, now the most common in Europe (R1a is also common in South Asia) would have expanded from the Russian steppes, along with the Indo- European languages; they also detected an autosomal component present in modern Europeans which was not present in Neolithic Europeans, which would have been introduced with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as Indo- European languages. Many geneticists consider Haplogroup R1a to be associated with the origins and spread of the Indo-Europeans. R1a1 shows a strong correlation with the distribution of the Indo-European languages in Europe and South Asia, being most prevalent in Poland, Russia, and Ukraine, and in central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. Two specific subclades dominate, namely R1-Z282 in Eastern-Europe and R1-Z93 in South Asia and South- Siberia. According to Underhill et al. (2014), the initial diversification of R1a took place in the vicinity of Iran, while Pamjav et al. (2012) think that R1a diversified within the Eurasian steppes or the Middle East and Caucasus region. Paternal lineages R1a and R1b (and paternal haplogroup I) have been found in Yamnaya remains, as well as in remains from the preceding mesolithic (hunter gatherer) and Neolithic peoples of the Eastern European steppe. The subclade R1a1a (R-M17 or R-M198) is the R1a subclade most commonly associated with Indo-European speakers. Ornella Semino et al. propose a postglacial (Holocene) spread of the R1a R1a1 haplogroup from north of the Black Sea during the time of the Late Glacial Maximum, which was subsequently magnified by the expansion of the Kurgan culture into Europe and eastward. Late Neolithic and Bronze Age Central Europeans surveyed in ancient DNA studies conclusively showed a mix of Western Hunter-Gatherers (WHG), Anatolian Farmers, and Pontic Steppe Hunter-Gatherers ancestry. Individuals from the Yamnaya culture had themselves a mix from Eastern Hunter-Gatherers (EHG) and Caucasus Hunter-Gatherer (CHG) ancestry (a mating network going from the Caucasus Mountains, parts of eastern Anatolia, and the western Iranian plateau). In 2015, a large-scale ancient DNA study published in Nature found evidence of a \\"massive migration\\" from the Pontic-Caspian steppe to Central Europe that took place about 4,500 years ago. It found that individuals from the Central European Corded Ware culture (3rd millennium BC) were genetically closely related to individuals from the Yamnaya culture. The authors concluded that their \\"results provide support for the theory of a steppe origin of at least some of the Indo-European languages of Europe\\",Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (4 March 2015) Genetic study revives debate on origin and expansion of Indo-European languages in Europe Science Daily, Retrieved 19 April 2015 in this case pre-Italo-Celtic and pre-Germanic. However, the folk migration model cannot be the only diffusion theory for all linguistic families, as the Yamnaya ancestry component is particularly concentrated in Europe in the northwestern parts of the continent. Other models for languages like Proto- Greek are still debated. The steppe genetic component is more diffuse in studied Mycenaean populations: if they came from elsewhere, Proto-Greek speakers were certainly a minority in a sea of populations which had been familiar with agriculture for 4000 years. Some propose that they gained progressive prominence through a cultural expansion by elite influence. But if high correlations can be proven in ethnolinguistic or remote communities, genetics does not always equate with language, and archaeologists have argued that although such a migration might have taken place, it does not necessarily explain either the distribution of archaeological cultures or the spread of the Indo-European languages. An analysis by David Anthony (2019) suggests a genetic origin of Proto-Indo-Europeans (associated with the Yamnaya culture) in the Eastern European steppe north of the Caucasus, deriving from a mixture of Eastern European hunter-gatherers and hunter-gatherers from the Caucasus. Anthony also suggests that the Proto-Indo-European language formed mainly from a base of languages spoken by Eastern European hunter-gathers with influences from languages of northern Caucasus hunter-gatherers, in addition to a possible later influence from the language of the Maykop culture to the south (which is hypothesized to have belonged to the North Caucasian languages) in the later Neolithic or Bronze Age, involving little genetic impact. Anatolian hypothesis Map showing the Neolithic expansion from the seventh to fifth millennium BC. =Theory= The main competitor to the Kurgan hypothesis is the Anatolian hypothesis advanced by Colin Renfrew in 1987. It couples the spread of the Indo-European languages to the hard fact of the Neolithic spread of farming from the Near East, stating that the Indo-European languages began to spread peacefully into Europe from Asia Minor from around 7000 BC with the Neolithic advance of farming (wave of advance). The expansion of agriculture from the Middle East would have diffused three language families: Indo-European toward Europe, Dravidian toward Pakistan and India, and Afro-Asiatic toward Arabia and North Africa. According to Renfrew (2004), the spread of Indo-European proceeded in the following steps: *Around 6500 BC: Pre-Proto-Indo-European, located in Anatolia, splits into Anatolian and Archaic Proto-Indo-European, the language of those Pre-Proto-Indo-European farmers who migrate to Europe in the initial farming dispersal. Archaic Proto- Indo-European languages occur in the Balkans (Starƒçevo-K√∂r√∂s-Cris culture), in the Danube valley (Linear Pottery culture), and possibly in the Bug-Dniestr area (Eastern Linear pottery culture). *Around 5000 BC: Archaic Proto-Indo- European splits into Northwestern Indo-European (the ancestor of Italic, Celtic, and Germanic), located in the Danube valley, Balkan Proto-Indo- European (corresponding to Gimbutas' Old European culture), and Early Steppe Proto-Indo-European (the ancestor of Tocharian). Reacting to criticism, Renfrew revised his proposal to the effect of taking a pronounced Indo-Hittite position. Renfrew's revised views place only Pre-Proto-Indo-European in 7th millennium BC Anatolia, proposing as the homeland of Proto-Indo-European proper the Balkans around 5000 BC, explicitly identified as the \\"Old European culture\\" proposed by Marija Gimbutas. He thus still situates the original source of the Indo-European language family in Anatolia c. 7000 BC. Reconstructions of a Bronze Age PIE society based on vocabulary items like \\"wheel\\" do not necessarily hold for the Anatolian branch, which appears to have separated from PIE at an early stage, prior to the invention of wheeled vehicles. Following the publication of several studies on ancient DNA in 2015, Colin Renfrew has accepted the reality of migrations of populations speaking one or several Indo-European languages from the Pontic steppe towards Northwestern Europe.Renfrew, Colin (2017) \\"Marija Redivia : DNA and Indo- European origins\\" (The Oriental Institute lecture series : Marija Gimbutas memorial lecture, Chicago. November 8, 2017). =Objections= Dating The main objection to this theory is that it requires an unrealistically early date. According to linguistic analysis, the Proto-Indo-European lexicon seems to include words for a range of inventions and practices related to the Secondary Products Revolution, which post-dates the early spread of farming. On lexico-cultural dating, Proto-Indo-European cannot be earlier than 4000 BC. Farming The idea that farming was spread from Anatolia in a single wave has been revised. Instead it appears to have spread in several waves by several routes, primarily from the Levant.R. Pinhasi, J. Fort and A. J. Ammerman, Tracing the origin and spread of agriculture in Europe, PLoS Biology, 3, no. 12 (2005), e436. The trail of plant domesticates indicates an initial foray from the Levant by sea.F. Coward et al., The spread of Neolithic plant economies from the Near East to Northwest Europe: a phylogenetic analysis, Journal of Archaeological Science, vol. 35, no. 1 (2008), pp. 42‚Äì56. The overland route via Anatolia seems to have been most significant in spreading farming into south-east Europe.M. √ñzdogan, Archaeological evidence on the westward expansion of farming communities from eastern Anatolia to the Aegean and the Balkans, Current Anthropology, vol. 52, no. S4 (2011), S415-S430. Farming developed independently in the eastern fertile crescent. Non-Indo-European languages appear to be associated with the spread of farming from the Near East into North Africa and the Caucasus. According to Lazaridis et al. (2016), farming developed independently both in the Levant and in the eastern Fertile Crescent. After this initial development, the two regions and the Caucasus interacted, and the chalcolithic north-west Iranian population appears to be a mixture of Iranian Neolithic, Levant, and Caucasus hunter- gatherers. According to Lazaridis et al. (2016), \\"farmers related to those from Iran spread northward into the Eurasian steppe; and people related to both the early farmers of Iran and to the pastoralists of the Eurasian steppe spread eastward into South Asia\\". They further note that ANI \\"can be modelled as a mix of ancestry related to both early farmers of western Iran and to people of the Bronze Age Eurasian steppe\\", which makes it unlikely that the Indo-European languages in India are derived from Anatolia. Mascarenhas et al. (2015) note that the expansion of Z93 from Transcaucasia into South Asia is compatible with \\"the archeological records of eastward expansion of West Asian populations in the 4th millennium BC culminating in the so-called Kura-Araxes migrations in the post-Uruk IV period\\". =Alignment with the steppe theory= According to Alberto Piazza \\"[i]t is clear that, genetically speaking, peoples of the Kurgan steppe descended at least in part from people of the Middle Eastern Neolithic who immigrated there from Turkey.\\" According to Piazza and Cavalli-Sforza, the Yamna culture may have been derived from Middle Eastern Neolithic farmers who migrated to the Pontic steppe and developed pastoral nomadism: Wells agrees with Cavalli-Sforza that there is \\"some genetic evidence for migration from the Middle East\\": Southern archaic PIE-homeland hypothesis =Armenian hypothesis= Gamkrelidze and Ivanov held that the urheimat was south of the Caucasus, specifically, \\"within eastern Anatolia, the southern Caucasus and northern Mesopotamia\\" in the fifth to fourth millennia BC. Their proposal was based on a disputed theory of glottal consonants in PIE. According to Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, PIE words for material culture objects imply contact with more advanced peoples to the south, the existence of Semitic loan-words in PIE, Kartvelian (Georgian) borrowings from PIE, some contact with Sumerian, Elamite and others. However, given that the glottalic theory never caught on and there was little archaeological support, the Gamkrelidze and Ivanov theory did not gain support until Renfrew's Anatolian theory revived aspects of their proposal. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov proposed that the Greeks moved west across Anatolia to their present location, a northward movement of some IE speakers that brought them into contact with the Finno-Ugric languages, and suggested that the Kurgan area, or better \\"Black Sea and Volga steppe\\", was a secondary homeland from which the western IE languages emerged. =Renewed southern homeland suggestions= Recent DNA research which shows that the steppe-people derived from a mix of Eastern Hunter-Gatherers (EHG) and Caucasian Hunter-Gatherers (CHG, native to the Caucasus and Northern Iran, but also found in northern Pakistan), has led to renewed suggestions of a Caucasian, or even Iranian, homeland for an archaic proto-Indo-European, the common ancestor of both Anatolian languages and all other Indo-European languages. It is argued that this may lend support to the Indo-Hittite hypothesis, according to which both proto-Anatolian and proto- Indo-European split-off from a common mother language \\"no later than the 4th millennium BCE.\\" Haak et al. (2015) state that their findings of gene flow of a population that shares traits with modern-day Armenians into the Yamnaya pastoralist culture, lends some plausibility to the Armenian hypothesis. Yet, they also state that \\"the question of what languages were spoken by the 'Eastern European hunter-gatherers' and the southern, Armenian-like, ancestral population remains open.\\" David Reich, in his 2018 publication Who We Are and How We Got Here, noting the presence of some Indo-European languages (such as Hittite) in parts of ancient Anatolia, states that \\"Ancient DNA available from this time in Anatolia shows no evidence of steppe ancestry similar to that in the Yamnaya [...] This suggests to me that the most likely location of the population that first spoke an Indo-European language was south of the Caucasus Mountains, perhaps in present-day Iran or Armenia, because ancient DNA from people who lived there matches what we would expect for a source population both for the Yamnaya and for ancient Anatolians.\\" Yet, Reich also notes that \\"...the evidence here is circumstantial as no ancient DNA from the Hittites themselves has yet been published.\\" Damgaard et al. (2018) note that the introduction of IE-languages into Anatolia did not happen by a substantial migration from the steppes, and state that they cannot reject the possibility that the IE-languages were introduced by a migration of CHG-related people. Yet, they also note that \\"the standard view [is] that PIE arose in the steppe north of the Caucasus,\\" and that linguists consider an intriduction via the Balkans more likely. According to Wang et al. (2019), the typical steppe- ancestry, as an even mix between EHG and CHG, may result from \\"an existing natural genetic gradient running from EHG far to the north to CHG/Iran in the south,\\" or it may be explained as \\"the result of Iranian/CHG-related ancestry reaching the steppe zone independently and prior to a stream of AF [Anatolian Farmer] ancestry.\\" Wang et al. (2019) note that the Caucasus and the steppes were genetically separated in the 4th millennium BCE, but that the Caucasus served as a corridor for gene flow between cultures south of the Caucasus and the Maykop culture during the Copper and the Bronze Age, speculating that this \\"opens up the possibility of a homeland of PIE south of the Caucasus,\\" which \\"could offer a parsimonious explanation for an early branching off of Anatolian languages, as shown on many PIE tree topologies.\\" However, Wang et al. also acknowledge that \\"the spread of some or all of the PIE branches would have been possible via the North Pontic/Caucasus region,\\" as explained in the steppe hypothesis. Kristian Kristiansen, in an interview with Der Spiegel in May 2018, stated that the Yamnaya culture may have had a predecessor at the Caucasus, where \\"proto-proto-Indo-European\\" was spoken. In a 2020 publication, Kristiansen writes that \\"...the origin of Anatolian should be located in the Caucasus, at a time when it acted as a civilizational corridor between south and north. Here the Maykop Culture of the northern Caucasus stands out as the most probable source for Proto-Anatolian, and perhaps even Proto-Indo- Anatolian.\\" Yet, the idea of Maykop origins is incompatible with the genetic ancestry of the Maykop culture, which was too rich in Anatolian farmer ancestry to be ancestral to Proto-Indo-Europeans. =Bomhard's hybrid North Caspian/Caucasian hypothesis= Bomhard's Caucasian substrate hypothesis proposes an origin (Urheimat) in a Central Asian or North Caspian region of the steppe for Indo-Uralic (a proposed common ancestor of Indo-European and Uralic). Bomhard elaborates on Johanna Nichols \\"Sogdiana hypothesis\\", and Kortlandt's ideas of an Indo-Uralic proto-language, proposing an Urheimat north or east of the Caspian Sea, of an Eurasiatic language which was imposed on a population which spoke a Northwest Caucasian language. =Criticism: Steppe origins with south Caspian CHG-influences= Damgaard and Wang state that the steppe-model is the dominant model, and does account for a steppe- origin of the Anatolian languages. Damgaard notes that \\"Among comparative linguists, a Balkan route for the introduction of Anatolian IE is generally considered more likely than a passage through the Caucasus, due, for example, to greater Anatolian IE presence and language diversity in the west.\\" Kloekhorst argues that the Anatolian languages have preserved archaisms which are also found in proto-Uralic, providing strong evidence for a steppe-origin of PIE. David Anthony criticizes the Southern/Caucasian homeland hypothesis (including the proposals of Reich, Kristiansen, and Wang). Anthony rejects the possibility that the Bronze Age Maykop people of the Caucasus were a southern source of language and genetics of Indo-European. Referring to Wang et al (2019), he notes that the Anatolian Farmer component in the Yamnaya-ancestry came from European farmers, not from the Maykop, which had too much Anatolian farmer ancestry to be ancestral to the Yamnaya-population. Anthony also notes that the paternal lineages of the Yamnaya, which were rich in R1b, were related to those of earlier Eastern European hunter-gatherers, rather than those of southern or Caucasus peoples such as the Maykop. He also criticises Bomhard's Caucasian substrate hypothesis, arguing that such deep relationships as between Indo-European and Uralic cannot be reliably demonstrated due to the time-depth involved. Anthony proposes that the Yamnaya derived mainly from Eastern European hunter-gatherers (EHG) from the steppes, and undiluted Caucasus hunter-gatherers (CHG) from northwestern Iran or Azerbaijan, similar to the Hotu cave population, who mixed in the Eastern European steppe north of the Caucasus. He suggests that the roots of the proto-Indo-European language formed mainly from a base of languages spoken by Eastern European hunter- gatherers, with some influences from the languages of Caucasus hunter- gatherers. According to Anthony, hunting-fishing camps from the lower Volga, dated 6200‚Äì4500 BCE, could be the remains of people who contributed the CHG- component, migrating westwards along the coast of the Caspian Sea, from an area south-east of the Caspian Sea. They mixed with EHG-people from the north Volga steppes, and the resulting culture contributed to the Sredny Stog culture, a predecessor of the Yamnaya culture. Other hypotheses = Baltic homeland = Lothar Kilian and Marek Zvelebil have proposed a 6th millennium BC or later origin in Northern Europe. The steppe theory is compatible with the argument that the PIE homeland must have been larger, because the \\"Neolithic creolisation hypothesis\\" allows the Pontic-Caspian region to have been part of PIE territory. = Palaeolithic Continuity Theory = The \\"Paleolithic Continuity Paradigm\\" is a hypothesis suggesting that the Proto- Indo-European language (PIE) can be traced back to the Upper Paleolithic, several millennia earlier than the Chalcolithic or at the most Neolithic estimates in other scenarios of Proto-Indo-European origins. Its main proponents are Marcel Otte, Alexander H√§usler, and Mario Alinei. The PCT posits that the advent of Indo-European languages should be linked to the arrival of Homo sapiens in Europe and Asia from Africa in the Upper Paleolithic. Employing \\"lexical periodization\\", Alinei arrives at a timeline deeper than even that of Colin Renfrew's Anatolian hypothesis. Since 2004, an informal workgroup of scholars who support the Paleolithic Continuity hypothesis has been held online. Apart from Alinei himself, its leading members (referred to as \\"Scientific Committee\\" in the website) are linguists Xaverio Ballester (University of Valencia) and Francesco Benozzo (University of Bologna). Also included are prehistorian Marcel Otte (Universit√© de Li√®ge) and anthropologist Henry Harpending (University of Utah). It is not listed by Mallory among the proposals for the origins of the Indo-European languages that are widely discussed and considered credible within academia. = Out of India theory = The Indigenous Aryans theory, also known as the Out of India theory, proposes an Indian origin for the Indo-European languages. The languages of northern India and Pakistan, including Hindi and the historically and culturally significant liturgical language Sanskrit, belong to the Indo- Aryan branch of the Indo-European language family. The Steppe model, rhetorically presented as an \\"Aryan invasion\\", has been opposed by Hindu revivalists and Hindu nationalists, who argue that the Aryans were indigenous to India, and some, such as B.B. Lal,B.B. Lal (2015), The Rigvedic People: Invaders? Immigrants? or Indigenous?. See also Koenraad Elst, BOOK REVIEW. The Rig Vedic People Were Indigenous to India, Not Invaders Koenraad Elst and Shrikant Talageri, have proposed that Proto-Indo-European itself originated in northern India, either with or shortly before the Indus Valley Civilisation. This \\"Out of India\\" theory is not regarded as plausible in mainstream scholarship.

Biography He was born in the village of Gradets (Sliven Province) and was raised by his grandmother in Kotel. He later studied in the Aprilov Gymnasium in Gabrovo and participated in the organization of the April Uprising (1876). During the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878) he was a translator in the 2nd Guards Division of the Russian Army. In 1879 he graduated the Military School in Sofia; in 1881 Dimitriev was promoted to a Lieutenant and in 1884 he became Captain after graduating the Saint Petersburg Academy. When only a captain he was one of the pro-Russian officers involved in the plot to kidnap Prince Alexander of Battenberg and force his abdication in 1886, for which he was exiled by Prime Minister Stefan Stambolov. He then served for ten years in the Russian army, and only returned to Bulgaria after the fall of Stambolov. During the Serbo-Bulgarian War (1885) Dimitriev was one of the commanders of the Western Corps and participated in the successful Battle of Pirot. After the war he took part in an unsuccessful coup d'√©tat; emigrated to Romania and became a member of the club of the Emigrant Officers. Later he emigrated to Russia and served in the Russian Army. He returned to Bulgaria in 1898 and became a second in command in the 5th Danube Infantry Division. On 18 May 1900 he was promoted to Colonel and was the Head of the General Staff of the Bulgarian Army from 1904 to 1907. On 2 August 1912 Radko Dimitriev was promoted to Lieutenant General. During the First Balkan War (1912‚Äì1913) he was in command of the 3rd Army which decisively defeated the Turks at Lozengrad and Lule Burgas in Thrace. During the Second Balkan War in 1913 he replaced general Mihail Savov as deputy commander-in-chief. Later that year after the end of the war he was sent as a Minister Plenipotentiary to Saint Petersburg, Russia. First World War During the First World War (1914‚Äì1918) he served in the Russian Army as a commander of a corps. At the beginning of spring 1915, Radko Dmitriev commanded the 3rd Army in Galicia facing the Austrians along the line of Gorlice-Tarn√≥w. His role was to hold the line while the Russian 11th and 12th armies in Bukovina renewed the offensive through the Carpathians towards Hungary. In April 1915 despite knowing that German troops had replaced those of Austro-Hungary in the area of Gorlice, Radko Dmitriev had made no preparations to counter a German offensive or fortify his positions. The trenches in his sector were crude and in many places there was no second line of defence. In the breakthrough area of Gorlice 5¬Ω Russian divisions (60,000 men) of poorly trained conscripts faced the 10 German divisions of the 11th army under Mackensen with 700 guns including many of heavy caliber, while the Russians had only 140 light field guns. The concentrated bombardment which opened the Gorlice‚ÄìTarn√≥w Offensive on 2 May 1915 tore the front open, but initially General Alexeev at Stavka refused to take the offensive seriously; Stavka remained convinced that main German attack would come in the north, and were focused on their own offensive in the south. A Russian counterattack was ordered by Stavka and took place at Dokra Pass on 7 May 1915 but this became a senseless massacre. Consequently, much of the 3rd Army was either cut off or destroyed by the time Stavka allowed Radko Dmitriev to order a retreat on 10 May 1915, and only 40,000 out of an army of 200,000 reached the River San. Radko Dmitriev claimed correctly that his army had been \\"bled white\\" but was removed from command 2 June 1915 and replaced by General Leonid Lesh. Sir Bernard Pares, who met Radko Dmitriev several times when he was covering the war on the Eastern Front, and knew him well, described him thus: > \\"General Radko Dmitriev is a short and sturdily built man with quick brown > eyes and a profile reminiscent of Napoleon. He talks quickly and shortly, > sometimes drums on the table with his fingers, and now and then makes a > rapid dash for the matches. The daily visit of the Chief of the Staff is > short, because, as the General says on his return, simple business is done > quickly. Every piece of his incisive conversation holds together as part of > a single and clear view of the whole military position, of which the > watchword is 'Forward'.\\" After a spell in the Caucasus out of favour, he was reappointed in late 1916 to command the 12th army on the Riga front, but in summer 1917 Alexeyev dismissed his commander-in-chief at the front, Ruszky, and the army commander Radko Dmitriev, for weakness and indulgence to the soldiers' committees that had sprung up everywhere after the February Revolution in 1917. Radko Dimitriev resigned and went with his family to the resort town of Pyatigorsk in Caucasus. There on 18 October 1918 he was shot down by the Bolsheviks together with 100 generals and officers.

Location Sandwiched between the incoming Portsmouth‚ÄìLondon railway line and the waters of Langstone Harbour, the airport offered little scope for expansion and, following some accidents with larger aircraft in the 1960s, the airport was closed in 1973. Construction and opening The airport was constructed during 1931 and early 1932 as Portsmouth's municipal airport. The airfield's name \\"Portsmouth\\" was marked in stone next to a large circle in the centre of the landing area. An opening display was held for the public on 2 July 1932 with an Armstrong Whitworth Argosy airliner and other civil and military aircraft being present.Marriott, 1993, p. 101. Portsmouth, Southsea and Isle of Wight Aviation P.S.I.O.W.A. moved to the airport in 1932 (having previously been based on the Isle of Wight under the name Inland Flying Services) and operated the first air ferry service in the South of England, flying passengers from Portsmouth Airport to Ryde on the Isle of Wight. The popularity of air travel grew rapidly and soon P.S.I.O.W.A. were offering high-frequency services between airfields around the South and the Isle of Wight, even joining forces with coach and train services to provide connections from London and Cardiff. The company continued to expand and were using a range of small aircraft including an eight-seat three-engined Westland Wessex G-ABVB by 1936. This aircraft was damaged beyond repair at Ryde on 30 May 1936. Portsmouth Aviation  PSIOWA began to expand rapidly before the war and began to undertake aircraft maintenance and modification in their hangars at the airport, in addition to the successful ferry services. At the start of the Second World War PSIOWA were ordered to stop their flying services in order to concentrate on the manufacture and repair side of the business. PSIOWA planes and pilots (including famous aviator Amy Johnson) were sent to serve as part of the National Air Communications Scheme while the site and skills at the Portsmouth Airport site were used to repair and modify several thousand military aircraft for return to service.Marriott, 1993, p. 101. The company changed its name to Portsmouth Aviation in 1946, with a view to expanding both the aviation and manufacturing sides of the business and, the following year, their newly designed Portsmouth Aerocar made its first flight. This five-seat aircraft had an unusual twin-engined, twin-boom, high-wing layout. It was exhibited at the Farnborough Air Show1948 and 1949 but due to the nationalisation of the rail and air services the company were unable to manufacture orders received for the craft. Around 1950, the company built a modest number of bus bodies. The company continued to run a smaller air-ferry service to overseas destinations, but development occurred on the manufacturing, repair, design and development sides of the business. The company continues to operate at this site, now offering a range of services beyond aviation. Airspeed Limited Airspeed Ltd moved to a new factory at the airport in 1933. Their prewar designs built at the airport included the Courier and the Envoy light transport aircraft.Jackson, 1973, pp. 16‚Äì23. Between 1938 and 1945, the factory built several thousand Oxford twin-engined training aircraft for the Royal Air Force and other air arms. The company had been acquired by de Havilland Aircraft in 1940.Marriott, 1993, p. 101. Airspeed converted over 150 Oxfords postwar to civil aviation standards as the Consul (see heading photo) and these were flown until the mid-1950s by small charter and other operators. During the 1950s Airspeed manufactured parts and sub-assemblies at Portsmouth for their new aircraft designs, but in 1960 the firm moved all its remaining operations to their Christchurch Hampshire factory.Marriott, 1993, p. 102. Hants and Sussex Aviation The Hants and Sussex Aviation Herald at Portsmouth Airport after withdrawal in 1955 H&SA; have been established on the site for over fifty years. In 1949, the firm designed the Herald single-seat light aircraft, which made a few ground hops at the airfield in 1953. Registered G-ALYA, the sole example was an ultra- light aircraft with a tricycle undercarriage and was powered by a 40 h.p. Aeronca-JAP J-99 engine. The aircraft was dismantled in 1955.Jackson, 1974, p. 322. During the late 1970s, the firm was handling the overhaul of light turbine and piston engines for aircraft and other uses. H&SA; are still active today (2012). They operate under the name H+S Aviation and have 2 sites in Portsmouth. The firm are now owned by BBA Aviation who own various aviation companies across the world. Subsequent use The area has been redeveloped as housing, retail and industrial units but a few of the old aircraft industry companies remain on the site including Portsmouth Aviation, Hants and Sussex Aviation and FPT Industries. The area has several roads named after local significant aircraft industry people especially Norway Road and Neville Shute Way both named after the author Nevil Shute (Nevil Shute Norway) who was one of the founders of Airspeed Ltd. Accidents and incidents * On 15 August 1967, two Channel Airways Hawker Siddeley HS 748-222 Srs. 2 (registration: G-ATEH and G-ATEK) were substantially damaged in separate landing accidents at Portsmouth Airport that occurred within two hours of each other.ASN Aircraft accident description Hawker Siddeley HS 748-222 Srs. 2 G-ATEH ‚Äì Portsmouth Airport (PME)ASN Aircraft accident description Hawker Siddeley HS 748-222 Srs. 2 G-ATEK ‚Äì Portsmouth Airport (PME) The first of these, involving HS 748-222 G-ATEK, occurred at 11.48 local time. The aircraft was operating that day's scheduled service from Southend to Paris via Portsmouth. Following a circling approach to Portsmouth Airport, it touched down normally ca. left of grass strip 36's centre-line. The pilot flying the aircraft selected ground fine propeller pitch during landing followed by continuous application of the wheel brakes. Initially, the aircraft decelerated normally. However, at an advanced stage of the landing roll, the flightdeck crew realised that the remaining distance might not be sufficient for the plane to stop. To keep within the airfield's boundary, the flightdeck crew attempted to swing the aircraft to the left. Although this caused the aircraft to turn in the desired direction, it began sliding sideways, finally coming to a halt on an earth embankment. Despite extensive damage to the aircraft, there was no post-crash fire and none of the 23 occupants (four crew, 19 passengers) were injured. The subsequent accident investigation established inadequate braking as a result of inadequate friction provided by the aerodrome's very wet grass covering a hard, dry and almost impermeable sub-soil. Accident investigators also cited the flightdeck crew's failure to take into account the additional landing distance that was required to land an HS 748 safely on the wet grass strip as an important contributory factor. The second mishap, involving HS 748-222 G-ATEH, occurred at 13.34 local time. The aircraft was operating that day's scheduled service from Guernsey to Portsmouth. A visual approach to Portsmouth Airport's grass strip 07 resulted in an unsuccessful attempt to land. A second attempt was made, resulting in the aircraft landing on strip 07. Immediately after touchdown, selection of ground fine propeller pitch was followed by application of brakes. Although this caused the aircraft to decelerate initially, subsequent braking proved ineffective due to the wet grass. As a consequence, the aircraft broke through the perimeter fence alongside the main road in the aerodrome's northeast corner, coming to a halt across the road. Despite extensive damage to the aircraft, there was no post-crash fire and none of the 66 occupants (four crew, 62 passengers) were injured. The subsequent accident investigation established inadequate braking as a result of inadequate friction provided by the aerodrome's very wet grass covering a hard, dry and almost impermeable sub-soil. Accident investigators also cited the flightdeck crew's failure to take into account the additional landing distance that was required to land an HS 748 safely on the wet grass strip as an important contributory factor. Both aircraft were subsequently repaired and returned to service.

The Canopus-class ships were all modelled on a captured French ship, the Franklin, which was renamed HMS Canopus in British service. Some of the copies were faster than others, though it was reported that none could beat the original.Fitzgerald p.30-31 HMS Vengeance was nicknamed 'the wind's-eye liner', and was faster than all the other ships except . In 1849, while under the command of Captain Charles Philip Yorke, 4th Earl of Hardwicke, HMS Vengeance took part in the repression of the republican-inspired Revolt of Genoa in support of the forces of the Kingdom of Sardinia. A landing detachment from the ship occupied unopposed the main coastal defence battery in the harbour, but during the following bombardment of the town HMS Vengeance caused heavy and random damage, including the Hospital of Pammatone where it caused 107 civilian casualties.. For these actions, Hardwicke was decorated by the Sardinian King Victor Emmanuel II with a Gold Medal of Military Valour, which he was authorized to accept by Queen Victoria only in 1855. Having returned to Britain, in August 1851 Vengeance, commanded by Captain Lord Edward Russell, left Portsmouth for the Mediterranean. After stops at Lisbon and Gibraltar, she arrived at Malta on 2 October. Vengeances commander during 1851 and 1852 was William Robert Mends.Fitzgerald p.30- On 13 March 1852, she ran aground in Gibraltar Bay and the end of a voyage from Malta to Gibraltar. She was refloated and found to be leaky. Vengeance returned to England at Christmas 1852, before returning to the Mediterranean with a new second in command, Commander George Le Geyt Bowyear (1818‚Äì1903), in the spring. By June she had rejoined the fleet at Malta, and then accompanied the whole Mediterranean fleet under Vice-Admiral James Dundas to Bashika Bay outside the Dardanelles as political tension increased before the Crimean War. In October the fleet moved through the Dardanelles to the Bosphorus and moored at Beikos Bay.Fitzgerald p. 41 In January she visited Sinope, where the Battle of Sinop had been fought the previous November between a Turkish squadron and the Russian fleet, resulting in a Turkish defeat. Vengeance moved to Varna in March, and then took part in the bombardment of Odessa on 22 April. The ship assisted with the transportation of the army across the Black Sea to the Crimea before attending at the Battle of Alma on 20 September.Fitzgerald p.43-45 She became a receiving ship in 1861, and was eventually sold out of the navy in 1897.

It is the state pork cook-off of Georgia.  History In 1982, a group of \\"pig cookers\\" in Vienna, Georgia, created the Big Pig Jig by combining a barbecue competition with an arts and crafts fair. From 20 teams in 1982, the event now has about 100 teams competing. Currently, the winner of the competition receives $2,500 and is invited to compete in the Memphis In May barbecue cook-off in Memphis, Tennessee, as well as the Memphis Barbecue Network Championship, which is held in different cities each year. At the first Big Pig Jig, the teams competed in the \\"Whole Hog\\" category only, and the winner was awarded $1,000. The competition currently includes an academic quiz bowl, a 5K \\"Hog Jog\\", and a golf scholarship tournament. Since its inception the competition has had about 25,000 spectators, and now requires about 350 judges.  Rules  Primary categories for the event are Whole Hog, Shoulder and Rib. There are also ancillary categories such as Sauce, Stew and Chicken. Ancillary categories are not considered when determining the Grand Champion. Teams may cook one, two or all three primary categories. Entries are judged by seven judges: three in the onsite portion and four in the blind portion. Onsite judges score each entry based on the following criteria: Area and Personal Appearance, Presentation, Appearance of Entry, Tenderness, Flavor, and Overall Impression. Blind judges score each entry in Appearance of Entry, Tenderness, Flavor, and Overall Impression. Entries are scored on a 10 point scale, with 10 being the highest. The Overall Impression criteria allows for decimal scoring (i.e. 9.9), while other criteria only allow whole number scoring (i.e. 8, 9, 10). Onsite judges visit three teams each, and compare the products presented by those teams to determine which is the best product they sampled that day. Blind judges have four to six entries on their table. The blind judges compare those entries to determine which is the best product they sampled that day. Blind judging uses a double blind system to insure that the judges do not know which teams produced the entries on their tables. There are two rounds of judging: Preliminary and Finals judging. All entries in a category participate in the Preliminary round. The top three entries in each category then move to the Finals round. The Finals round begins a new set of judging; however, there is no blind judging in the finals round. There are four judges in the Finals round, and those judges will sample each of the nine Finals entries (three Hog, three Shoulder, three Rib). The goal of the finals judges is to rank each entry to determine the best entry of the day, and to rank each entry in the relevant category. Only those teams who make it to the Finals round are considered for the Grand Championship. In the finals round, the judges are searching for the best entry of the day. Teams may cook with any type of wood or charcoal. Electricity or gas can be used to start the initial fire. All preparation of the meat must be done during the competition.

Vaughn was appointed Peace Corps director in 1966 by President Lyndon Johnson and was the first Republican to head the agency. Early life and education Vaughn was born in Columbus, Montana in 1920, the son of Elijah H. Vaughn and Blair (Cox) Vaughn.. Vaughn grew up in Montana where his father managed a retail store and eventually owned the Vaughn and Ragsdale stores. Vaughn moved with his family to Albion, Michigan in 1931 where his father managed a chain of clothing stores in Michigan and Montana. Vaughn attended Albion Public Schools and graduated from Albion High School in 1939. Vaughn earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Michigan in 1943. =Boxing career= Vaughn became interested in boxing as a youth and would spar with local boxers on the third floor of his father's building in Albion, Michigan where a makeshift gymnasium was located. By age 14 Vaughn was boxing publicly in \\"smokers.\\" \\"Everyone was smoking Roi-Tan cigars,\\" says Vaughn. \\"We were fighting in a purple haze. It was $5 if you won, $3 if you didn't. The events featured three or four semi- pro boxing matches and one fairly professional striptease. If there was no striptease, they brought in the wrestlers.\\" Vaughn was a Golden Gloves boxer and won three Golden Gloves championships. Vaughn would sometimes box in Detroit where he worked occasionally as a sparring partner for notable prizefighters, including Sugar Ray Robinson, Jake LaMotta, Willie Pep and Sandy Saddler. Vaughn began fighting professionally in 1942 under the name of \\"Johnny Hood.\\"Peace Corps Volunteer Magazine. \\"Vaughn Takes the Helm.\\" January, 1966 \\"I was bumming around Mexico one summer when I ran out of money,\\" Vaughn said. \\"I decided I would take my boxing and turn pro, but I didn't know enough Spanish at the time to tell whether the agent said I would get 60 pesos for four rounds or four pesos for 60 rounds. You can guess which figure was correct.\\" Vaughn fought 26 featherweight bouts as a professional. Vaughn tells the story that the first time he fought professionally in Mexico, the fans cheered enthusiastically but he couldn't make out what they were saying and he thought they were cheering him on. It was only later that he learned that what the fans were shouting was \\"Kill the Gringo!\\" \\"My first fight was down in Juarez,\\" says Vaughn. I was in the first of a four-round preliminary match. My second was a high school kid from El Paso. The crowd began to shout, 'Mata al Gringo!' I asked my second what they were saying. He said, 'I think they're saying, \\"Welcome to Juarez.\\" A week later I found out what that meant.\\" Mata al Gringo! later became the title for Vaughn's unpublished memoirs. Vaughn was the head boxing coach at University of Michigan from 1942 to 1943 and also taught Spanish, French and Latin American affairs while he was at the University of Michigan. =Marine officer in World War II= During World War II, Vaughn served as an officer in the United States Marine Corps as a rifle company commander and a combat intelligence officer from 1942 to 1946. Vaughn saw combat in Eniwetok, Guam, and Okinawa. Vaughn left the Marines with the rank of captain.Peace Corps Writers. \\"Kill the Gringo\\" by John Coyne. Peace Corps Writers. February 28, 2007 Vaughn earned the Purple Heart during his service. \\"I was wounded three times, all in the rear end,\\" says Vaughn. After returning from World War II, Vaughn earned a Master of Arts in 1947 in Romance Languages from the University of Michigan. and a Masters in economics. Vaughn taught Spanish, French and Latin American affairs while he was at the University of Michigan and was also the head boxing coach. \\"I wanted to be a professor of French literature,\\" says Vaughn. Vaughn continued fighting to earn extra money while he worked at the University of Michigan. \\"I ended up losing the sight in my right eye in 1948,\\" says Vaughn. \\"So in 1949, I went to the State Department.\\" State Department career =USIA and USAID= Vaughn joined the US Information Agency (USIA) in 1949 as director of the bi-national center in La Paz, Bolivia and later moved to Costa Rica with the USIA. Vaughn joined the State Department in 1951 and spent 1951 to 1956 in Panama with the State Department. While working for the State Department in the 1950s Vaughn met several times with Che Guevara. \\"I met him seven or eight times. Each time I liked him less,\\" says Vaughn. \\"My final meeting, I gave him a University of Michigan T-shirt. He wore it backwards.\\"Arizone Daily Star. \\"Once a fighter, always a fighter\\" by Bonnie Henry. February 7, 2008. From 1959 to 1961 Vaughn was the USAID Mission director for Senegal, Mali, and Mauritania.Spirit of America. \\"Jack Vaughn\\" Vaughn's background growing up on a ranch in Montana helped him in his work with USAID where he worked in \\"mainly agricultural reform. I had a lot of training,\\" says Vaughn. =Peace Corps staff= Vaughn's connection with the Peace Corps began in 1961 when Peace Corps founding director Sargent Shriver came to Senegal where Vaughn was serving with USAID. \\"There were 4,000 volunteers signing up a day for the Peace Corps, and countries weren't asking for them. So Shriver came over to meet the Senegalese,\\" says Vaughn. \\"I was the only one who spoke French. I went up to meet Shriver and his lawyer in their hotel room. They did not have on a stitch of clothing. We all sat down and had a conversation. They said they had never seen heat like that. It was 120 degrees and no air conditioning.\\" Vaughn's boxing prowess and prior experience as a prize fighter paid off when Sargent Shriver decided to recruit Vaughn. \\"I was recruited by Sargent Shriver because I had been in the ring with Sugar Ray Robinson,\\" Vaughn said. \\"He loves jocks.\\" Coates Redmond described Vaughn as \\"barely medium height, slight of build, with ginger- colored hair and a 1940s moustache to match, quietly spoken and careful of gesture\\" in her history of the early years of the Peace Corps, Come As You Are.Come as You Are by Coates Redmon. Harcourt. 1986. Before his appointment to the Peace Corps, Vaughn met with President Kennedy who didn't like Vaughn's mustache and told him he would have to shave it off if he wanted to work in the Peace Corps. Vaughn refused to shave the mustache but got the appointment anyway. Vaughn joined the Peace Corps staff because \\"the Peace Corps idea had a great appeal to me. And the people I knew who were putting this idea into effect appealed to me even more.\\" Shriver admired Vaughn's courage and felt anyone who would brave the ring with Sugar Ray Robinson would have the grit to fight for the Peace Corps in Latin America so when the Peace Corps decided to send volunteers to teach in Venezuela in 1963 despite the presence of Castro communists, Shriver made Vaughn his point man. \\"Shriver said, 'Show them your teeth, not your tail,'\\" Vaughn said. \\"Those teachers did great there. I'm sure it was his finest moment in the Peace Corps.\\" Vaughn served as the Latin- American director of the Peace Corps from October, 1961 to April, 1964. When Vaughn came to the Peace Corps there were only 78 volunteers serving in Latin America. By the time he left after two-and-a half years in the position, there were 2,500 volunteers working in rural and urban development in Latin America. Vaughn left the Peace Corps in 1964 to return to the State Department. =Ambassador to Panama= US Ambassador to Panama Joseph S. Farland resigned in August, 1963 leaving the United States without an ambassador for several months. The New York Times printed a story on January 10, 1964 criticizing the administration for leaving the post vacant and saying the vacancy had contributed to anti-American riots in Panama. \\"The absence of an American Ambassador was an invitation to the Communists to raise the devil,\\" said Senator George D. Aiken, Republican of Vermont. \\"They have been waiting for this chance.\\"New York Times. \\"Senators Decry Lack of an Envoy\\" by E. W. Kenworthy. January 10, 1964. President Johnson named Vaughn US Ambassador to Panama in 1964 after the two nations broke off diplomatic relations because of nationalistic rioting in Panama. The Senate approved Vaughn's appointment on April 7, 1964.New York Times. \\"Panama Envoy Confirmed; Two Other Posts are Filled\\" April 8, 1964. Vaughn arrived in Panama on April 17, 1964 to take up the post of Ambassador, now vacant for six months. His arrival was welcomed by Panamanians who knew and liked Vaughn from his previous work in Panama with the US AID mission. Vaughn had previously arranged for about 1,000 young Panamanians to go to the United States for post-graduate study. In the airport lounge, ten young Panamanians unfurled a long sign greeting Vaughn. \\"Jack, the scholarship holders remember your work and greet you,\\" the sign read.New York Times. \\"Panama irked by US Proposal to Survey for Canal in Colombia\\" by Richard Eder. April 17, 1966. In the book The Negotiations Regarding the Panama Canal by Omar Jaen Suarez, Vaughn is given great credit for defusing the tensions between the two countries and starting the United States and Panama on the road to successfully negotiating the Panama Canal Treaty.El Panam√° Am√©rica. \\"Vaughn, An American Who Defended Panama\\" by Enrique Lusi Brathwaite. February 4, 2002. The original story is a dead link . An archival copy of the article is available here. \\"I lived here in a successful and comfortable way, dedicated to agricultural activities and as I was not a member of the U.S. military, I understood that now was the moment to change the relation, the cut of the pie, that Panama was receiving for the Canal\\" Vaughn said speaking of his time in Panama in the early 1950s. After Vaughn became ambassador to Panama, it was difficult for Vaughn to convince the US government to offer concessions because the Vietnam War was going on at the time. \\"It was a time of total war when the Pentagon was thinking of nothing else, like revising agreements or other annoyances like these, because they needed the military bases for training the troops,\\" Vaughn said. Vaughn's efforts were fruitful. On December 19, 1964 President Johnson made an address to the Panamanian people proposing the negotiation of an entirely new treaty on the Panama Canal. \\"In these new proposals we will take every possible step to deal fairly and to deal helpfully with the citizens of both Panama and of the United States who have served so faithfully through the years in operating and maintaining the Panama Canal,\\" said Johnson.New York Times. \\"Text of Johnson Statement and Address by Robles\\" December 19, 1965. Although Vaughn takes no credit for President Carter's efforts beginning in 1977 to complete negotiations for a new Panama Canal treaty, Vaughn's early initiatives to reach an understanding with Panama paved the way for Carter's negotiations later. =Assistant Secretary of State= On February 12, 1965 President Johnson named VaughnNew York Times. \\"Mann is Appointed to Harriman Post as No. 2 Rusk Aide\\" by Tom Wicker February 12, 1965. Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs and the United States coordinator of the Alliance for Progress. The bureau was the single largest unit in the State Department with more than 600 employees in Washington and 2,000 more abroad. Vaughn was in charge of relations with the twenty Latin-American republics as well as Jamaica, Trinidad, and British Guinea. Vaughn's responsibilities included managing the Alliance for Progress and the office dealing with the Organization of American States. Vaughn also carried the title of United States Coordinator for the Alliance for Progress.New York Times. \\"Officials Shifted in Latin Bureau\\" by Ted Szulc. April 20, 1965. Vaughn promoted a Peace Corps-style approach to diplomacy. \\"If I had my way, every young foreign service officer who now spends his early career stamping visas would be forced to put in two years with the Peace Corps or two years in private business as a salesman or an assistant assembly line foreman,\\" said Vaughn. \\"Anything that would teach them how to deal with people and get along with them.\\" On September 4, 1965, the New York Times reported that Vaughn had just completed a two-week trip to Latin America and returned with an enthusiastic report for President Johnson on the Alliance for Progress. Vaughn expressed his conviction that a \\"new and bright chapter\\" was starting in the partnership between Latin America and the United States. \\"Not long ago the people of Latin America were still doubtful about the goals of the alliance,\\" Vaughn said. Today it is a reality that is marching better than I thought and it is a reality because our partnership is solid, enduring and expanding.\\" During his trip, Vaughn talked with hundreds of workers and peasants and with the leaders of Mexico, El Salvador, Panama, Ecuador, Chile, Bolivia, and Peru. Vaughn was warmly received during his trip and was praised by Chilean President Eduardo Frei Montalva who expressed gratitude for US economic assistance that he said was \\"decisive\\" for the solution of Chile's economic problems.New York Times. \\"Vaughn Pleased by Latins' Gains\\" by Henry Raymont. September 4, 1965 Peace Corps director Peace Corps director Jack Vaughn meets with reporters and answers questions in fluent Spanish in Honduras in February 1969. From the Peace Corps Volunteer magazine May, 1969. When Johnson picked Sargent Shriver to head up his \\"War on Poverty\\" in 1966, Vaughn was named Peace Corps director. \\"It was so good, so positive,\\" Vaughn said of his appointment. \\"As a former bureaucrat, to join the Peace Corps was pure joy. All the stuff I knew we shouldn't do, we didn't do. All the things we should do, we did efficiently, effectively and cheaply.\\" Vaughn was appointed Peace Corps director on February 16, 1966. Vaughn was in a bar at 12:30 on M Street in Georgetown when the bar telephone rang and the bartender asked, \\"Is there a Mr. Jack Vaughn here?\\" Vaughn answered yes the bartender says, \\"it's someone who says he's the president of the United States.\\" \\"Let me finish this drink,\\" replied Vaughn taking his time before picking up the phone and saying hello. On the line was President Lyndon Baines Johnson himself. \\"Vaughn,\\" said LBJ. \\"How would you like to be the director of the Peace Corps?\\" \\"Mr. President,\\" Vaughn replied calmly, \\"I thought you'd never ask.\\" =Senate approval and swearing-in= The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved Vaughn's appointment as Peace Corps director 12 to 1 with Wayne Morse, Democrat of Oregon opposing Vaughn. In the same committee meeting Morse was also the sole vote against Lincoln Gordon to succeed Vaughn as Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs.New York Times. \\"Senate Unit Backs Vaughn as Peace Corps Director\\" February 22, 1966. During the hearings Senator Laushe of Ohio asked Vaughn about reports that some Peace Corps volunteers did not dress properly. \\"Don't you have many of what you call the 'mustache people' around?\\" asked the Senator. The Senate hearing room burst into laughter as did Laushe when he realized what he had said to the mustached Vaughn. \\"That's the meanest thing you ever said to me, Senator,\\" replied Vaughn. \\"The Peace Corps is the point of the lance,\\" said Vaughn on February 28, 1966 in his first interview after his Senate confirmation as Director. \\"In Latin America, it is the human cutting edge of the Alliance for Progress, the focus of ideas and people in action. In other countries also we are finally beginning to deal with the real problems of the day - peace and poverty and war and changing attitudes and hatred.\\" Vaughn was sworn in as Peace Corps director at a White House ceremony by President Lyndon Johnson on March 1, 1966, the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Peace Corps. \\"Jack Vaughn I first met out in a little fishing village in Africa, but he, like Sargent Shriver, I observed on that first meeting, is a disciple of peace,\\" said President Johnson. \\"His life has been spent in the service of the cause of peace. This is the third job that I have asked Jack Vaughn to take since I met him in that fishing village in 1961. Each of these jobs he has served with great distinction.\\"Peace Corps Volunteer Magazine. \\"Peace Corps Marks 5 Years\\" March, 1966. The American Presidency Project. \\"Remarks on the Fifth Anniversary of the Peace Corps at the Swearing In of Jack Hood Vaughn as Director\\" by President Lyndon B. Johnson. March 1st, 1966 Vaughn said that his first task as Director would be to visit Peace Corps programs around the world, meet staff members and volunteers and explain his plans.New York Times. \\"New Director Says Peace Corps Role is 'Point of Lance'\\" February 28, 1966. Vaughn meant that literally and started at the top of the 12-story Peace Corps Headquarters building to personally meet and shake hands with every employee.Peace Corps Volunteer Magazine. \\"Thrilled to be Back.\\" February, 1966. \\"I want to help build on this image and bask in your collected glory,\\" said Vaughn. \\"I'm pleased to be with you.\\" During his first month as director, Vaughn gave an estimated 60 speeches, visited 15 college campuses to recruit volunteers and traveled overseas with visits to Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, India, and Thailand.Peace Corps Volunteer Magazine. \\"Vaughn Maintains Fast Pace.\\" April, 1966. =Environmental focus= One of Vaughn's most lasting contributions to the Peace Corps was to redirect the Peace Corps' focus to environmental issues. Vaughn first became interested in 1963 when he met a volunteer in Chile named Duty Green. \\"Duty Green was a forester, and he went to Chile with a commitment to plant a million trees,\\" Vaughn said. \\"When his tour was almost over, he sent me a message saying, 'I'm very sorry. I've only been able to plant 900,000 trees in my time here. Can you extend my stay?' Here was a guy who would never say, 'What am I doing here?' He could look at a forest and know it was there because of his efforts. This is what we should have been doing - have them plant a tree, clean up a stream,\\" Vaughn said. \\"That was the explosion of awareness that changed the Peace Corps, because I wised up and still had time to do something about it. Those generalists, with no prior technical training, could be trained to do a beautiful job in just 10 weeks to turn wasteland into forest, to run nurseries, to do earth dam construction and supervision. It's a wonderful and satisfying job for a volunteer,\\" Vaughn said.Tucson Citizen. \\"Peace Corps at 40\\" by C. T. Revere. September 10, 2001. =Problems in Nigeria= The New York Times reported on October 6, 1966 that Vaughn had left for Africa to investigate an unusually large number of complaints by Peace Corps Volunteers regarding their living allowances and working conditions in Nigeria. Vaughn's itinerary included stops in Senegal, Nigeria, and Liberia to inspect Peace Corps operations in the three countries. Complaints in Nigeria included closing the Peace Corps hostels intended for use by Peace Corps Volunteers on vacations or free weekends, a $19 cut in volunteers' $147 monthly living allowance to reflect the monthly pay of local Nigerians for work comparable to that done by volunteers, and a reduction in the number of motorbikes allocated for volunteers for official travel \\"in the Nigerian bush country.\\"New York Times. \\"Vaughn to Study Complaints on Pay and Other Matters\\" October 6, 1966. Vaughn traveled to Nigeria and spent three weeks traveling the country to meet in small groups with about 600 of the 699 volunteers in country to re- establish \\"a missing dialogue\\" between Volunteers and Washington Staff. Vaughn cut to the crux of the matter when he met with Peace Corps Staff in Nigeria. \\"I never get letters of complaint from Volunteers who are busy doing something,\\" Vaughn said, \\"who are teaching thirty hours a week.\\" Vaughn thought that too many volunteers were more concerned with proposed reductions in the living allowances, vehicle restrictions, and the closing of hostels than with the work they had come to do. \\"Stay where the Nigerians stay,\\" said Vaughn. \\"The Peace Corps is not in the hotel business. Forget the motorbikes the Peace Corps gave you in a period of misguided generosity. Travel with the Africans or better yet stay in your town and get to know the people rather than escaping on weekends to visit other volunteers.\\"Keeping Kennedy's Promise. by C. Payne Lucas and Kevin Lowther. Peace Corps Press. 1977. Vaughn traveled with two reporters from the \\"Peace Corps Volunteer\\" magazine, a monthly magazine that went out to Peace Corps Volunteers worldwide. The December, 1966 issue of \\"Peace Corps Volunteer\\" contained a report on Vaughn's trip and the issues in Nigeria.Peace Corps Volunteer. \\"The issues of Nigeria, and beyond\\" by Stuart Awbrey and Pat Brown. December, 1966. =Program improvements= The weaknesses in the Nigeria program confirmed Vaughn's worst suspicions about the need to improve the quality of Peace Corps programs. \\"We've got to do better on recruitment, in administration, orchestration, and approach,\\" said Vaughn. Vaughn's biggest contribution to the Peace Corps was the effort he put into making program development in the field and program review and evaluation at Washington Headquarters into a professional process. One of Vaughn's first actions, taken in March, 1966, was to create the Peace Corps' Office of Planning and Program Review. Vaughn spent two years reappraising overseas operations, administration, training, and selection and created a more efficient programming mechanism. Vaughn made sure that the emphasis was shifted in the Peace Corps from how many volunteers were working to what the volunteers were doing and how well were they doing it. =Peace Corps and the Vietnam War= When Vaughn appeared at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison on March 11, 1966 about 150 protesters interrupted his speech three times. The protesters included members of the local chapters of the \\"Committee to End the War in Vietnam\\" and the Students for a Democratic Society.New York Times. \\"Wisconsin Students Heckle Vaughn on Vietnam Policy\\" March 11, 1966. Many volunteers also disagreed with United States policy during the Vietnam war, and some members of Congress thought that volunteers should be required to support United States policy while they were serving overseas. Vaughn defended the rights of Peace Corps volunteers. \\"[Secretary of State] Dean Rusk has said repeatedly that Peace Corps volunteers are not a part of United States foreign policy,\\" said Vaughn in testimony before Congress. Representative Otto Passman said that Vaughn should either resign or be dismissed because he would not require volunteers to support foreign policy, especially Vietnam.New York Times. \\"Peace Corps Head in Clash on Policy\\" July 14, 1968. However, dissent had its limits for Peace Corps volunteers. In 1967 Bruce Murray, a Peace Corps Volunteer serving in Chile, helped draw up a petition that called for a cessation of the bombing of North Vietnam and immediate negotiations for peace. Murray said his petition was for publication in the New York Times. The petition was never published in the Times. Murray allegedly translated the petition to Spanish and gave it to \\"El Sur,\\" a Chilean newspaper. Ralph Dungan, the US ambassador to Chile at the time, said the petition was a \\"clear violation\\" of standard State Department procedures and that volunteers had been cautioned about limiting their modes of expressing their opinion. Dungan told volunteers to voice their views to their Congressmen or to the President. Murray was dismissed from the Peace Corps for violating State Department regulations governing political conduct overseas.New York Times. \\"A Former Envoy Testifies in Peace Corps Case\\" by John H. Fenton. September 17, 1969. On July 19, 1967 Vaughn clarified Peace Corps policy on writing letters to newspapers on political issues and said that volunteers could now identify themselves as Peace Corps volunteers in letters to newspapers. The old policy permitted identification by name only. The new policy would not have made any difference in the discharge of Murray because his activities involved the use of a newspaper in a host country.New York Times. \\"Peace Corps Eases Curb on Protests By Its Volunteers\\" July 19, 1967. One of the fallouts of the anti-government stance of many young people was a decline in applications to join the Peace Corps. A Harris poll conducted with college students in 1968 found that \\"One-quarter of the seniors agree that 'a lot of people who might have joined the Peace Corps a few years ago are staying away because of their opposition to United States policy in Vietnam.\\"New York Times. \\"VISTA Gains Recruits as the Peace Corps Lags\\" by Joseph A. Luftus. July 4, 1968. \\"An increasing number of people are saying, 'since we do not or have not been able to solve our own problems, perhaps we had better focus more attention and resources on our own problems at home before we continue our effort to save the world,'\\" said Vaughn. =Peace Corps and the draft= Former US Marine Officer Vaughn took an active role in seeking deferments for Peace Corps Volunteers subject to the draft. \\"We have a serious situation,\\" said Vaughn. \\"The problem of induction notices to overseas volunteers in becoming a major concern for us. Pulling a volunteer off a productive job at midtour is unfair to the nation, to the host country, the Peace Corps, and the individual.\\" Even though service in the Peace Corps did not relieve a male volunteer of his military obligation, some Selective Service Boards had granted deferments for the two years of voluntary service as being in the national interest. After 25 volunteers were called home for induction and Vaughn said he would take an active role in seeking deferments before the Presidential Appeal Board - the court of last resort for draft reclassification.New York Times. \\"Peace Corps Plans to Appeal Drafting of Those on Duty\\" November 19, 2967. =Nonpartisan support for the Peace Corps= As a lifelong Republican appointed to head the Peace Corps by a Democratic president, Vaughn exemplified the non-partisan basis of the Peace Corps and the support the agency had from both political parties. Vaughn recounted how he had met with Republican Senator Barry Goldwater, the conservative candidate for president in 1964, at a senior staff meeting. \\"After serious questioning on what Kennedy's new agency was all about, Arizona's Goldwater swore that the Peace Corps embodied virtually every one of the most noble aspects and values of the Republican Party,\\" wrote Vaughn. Ambassador to Colombia When Richard Nixon became president in 1969, Vaughn found himself out of a job. One report says that Vaughn was asked by Nixon's Secretary of State William P. Rogers to stay on as Peace Corps director to emphasize the nonpolitical nature of the Peace Corps.New York Times. \\"New Peace Corps Head Joseph Blatchford\\" May 5, 1969. Instead, Vaughn was informed in March, 1969, that he would be replaced after all and reports that Vaughn had been asked to stay on as Peace Corps director in the Nixon administration were reported in the media to be untrue.New York Times. \\"Peace Corps Chief Says He Will Soon Leave Post\\" March 14, 1969. \\"I was the first bureaucrat Nixon fired when he took office,\\" Vaughn said. \\"But when he found out I was a Republican, he asked me if I'd be his ambassador to Colombia.\\" On May 2, 1969, President Nixon announced the appointment of Vaughn as Ambassador to Colombia.New York Times. \\"Vaughn is Selected for Colombia Post\\" May 2, 1970. No major diplomatic initiatives took place with Colombia during Vaughn's ambassadorship there. Vaughn saw his role more as a \\"good will ambassador\\" and made many efforts to help the United States be seen in a positive light. For example, while Ambassador to Colombia, Vaughn, a former boxer, refereed boxing matches for the flyweight, lightweight, and middleweight finals in the Colombian National amateur championships held in Cartagena. Vaughn held a license to referee professional fights in the United States and so as a courtesy, Colombia granted Vaughn a reciprocal license to referee in Colombia. Vaughn noted that one difference from the United States is that the referee in Colombia is not allowed to touch the fighters when calling on them to break a clinch. Vaughn stopped the lightweight match with only 41 seconds to go in the final round to have a doctor examine a cut over one fighter's eye and the fight was stopped. Vaughn is said to be the only US diplomat to referee a fight while serving as Ambassador and declared that he was much impressed with the caliber of the fighters in Colombia.New York Times. \\"Envoy of the US Referees in Ring\\" December 7, 1969. Vaughn announced his resignation as Ambassador to Colombia on June 11, 1970 to return to private life. It was reported in the New York Times that Vaughn was leaving because he was in disagreement with Nixon's Latin American policies. However, a State Department spokesman said the Vaughn was resigning \\"for personal reasons\\" adding that \\"There is no disagreement over policy.\\"New York Times. \\"State Department Denies Vaughn Quit Over Policy\\" June 11, 1970. Post-government activities =Head of National Urban Coalition, Planned Parenthood= On October 8, 1970 Vaughn was named President of the National Urban Coalition replacing John W. Gardner, former Secretary of Health Education and Welfare. Vaughn's responsibilities as chief executive officer of the organization were to run day-to-day operations of the coalition's chapters in 48 cities in the United States.New York Times. \\"Jack Vaughn is Named Urban Coalition Head\\" October 8, 1970 From 1972 to 1975 Vaughn was Dean of International Studies at Florida International University in Miami, Florida. From 1972 to 1975 Vaughn was named to head the overseas development staff for Children's Television Workshop, a unit of National Educational Television, producers of Sesame Street and The Electric Company.Children's Television Workshop \\"Corporate Records\\" Vaughn was President of Planned Parenthood from 1974 to 1975.Planned Parenthood. \\"Past Chief Executives\\" From 1977 to 1979 Vaughn was Vice-President of Development and Resource Corporation for Iran. From 1979 to 1980 Vaughn was Assistant Administrator for Latin America Designate for USAID. From 1980 to 1982 Vaughn was President of Pierce Energy Corporation. From 1983 to 1986 Vaughn was vice- president, private sector projects for Development Associates. From 1986 to 1988 Vaughn was vice-president, government relations and finance for Conservation International. Vaughn was chairman of Ecotrust, a conservation organization committed to strengthening communities and the environment.Ecotrust Web Site. =Confirmation hearings for Gaddi Vasquez= Vaughn opposed the George W. Bush's nomination of Gaddi Vasquez to become Peace Corps director in 2001. \\"As they say on the racing tout sheet for a horse that is not in the running: 'Nothing to recommend,'\\" Vaughn said. \\"He has little experience . . . and little to indicate that he understands how to run the Peace Corps or any international organization. It's clearly a political payoff, and it would be a shame to see him approved.\\" As a Republican it pained Vaughn to have to oppose a nominee by a Republican president, but Vaughn came to Washington on his own and appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to speak out against the appointment of Vasquez. However Vasquez cleared the United States Senate Foreign Relations committee by a vote of 14‚Äì4,Orange County Register. \\"Vasquez survives critics in Senate\\" by Dan Nowicki. December 13, 2001.

An archival copy is available here, =Continued Support for the Peace Corps= On February 28, 2008 Vaughn published an op-ed in the Tucson Citizen supporting expansion of the Peace Corps and defending the relevance of the Peace Corps in today's world. \\"What the Peace Corps set out as its goals in 1961 coincides almost exactly with what most of our presidential candidates in 2008 have promised to seek at home, e.g. bringing real change, better health care, improved environmental protection, peace by means other than bludgeoning, burnishing the U.S. image abroad (an area in which the Peace Corps has no rival), promoting nonpartisan solutions, better education at all levels, with a major focus on helping the poor and disadvantaged,\\" wrote Vaughn. \\"Is there a chance our next president, having talked the Peace Corps talk so faithfully and so long, will be able to stay real and walk the Peace Corps walk (while increasing the Peace Corps budget)?\\"Tucson Citizen. \\"Guest Opinion: Finally, candidates 'discover' Peace Corps\\" by Jack Vaughn. February 28, 2008. Personal life Vaughn's first marriage to the former Joanne Cordes Smith ended in divorce. Vaughn married Margaret Anne Weld on October 21, 1970. Weld had served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Chad and was on Vaughn's personal staff when he was Director of the Peace Corps. Weld, known by her nickname \\"Leftie,\\" was later on the public affairs staff at Peace Corps Headquarters in Washington.New York Times. \\"Miss Weld Wed to Jack Vaughn, Ex- Ambassador\\" October 21, 1970. He is the father of Kathryn Vaughn Tolstoy and Carol Blair Vaughn by his first wife and Jack Hood Vaughn Jr. and Jane Vaughn Constantineau with his second wife. In 1988 Vaughn made headlines while visiting New York City when Vaughn, then 67, defended himself during an attempted mugging as Vaughn left his hotel in midtown Manhattan after midnight to get a newspaper. Former professional prizefighter Vaughn hit the would-be mugger in the jaw leaving the mugger face down on the sidewalk. \\"This fellow came up behind me, put his arm around my waist, pinned my right arm to my side, and tried to remove my wallet,\\" says Vaughn. \\"I hit him in the throat with my elbow. Then I kneed him in the groin and hit him in the jaw about five times. He was jackknifed on his face on the sidewalk as I walked away.\\" \\"On several occasions I've had to straighten people out,\\" Vaughn added. In 1992 Vaughn and his wife moved to Tucson. Vaughn, at 87, still kept in shape by shadow boxing and running in place. \\"I have an unbelievable left hook,\\" says Vaughn. \\"Sometimes I shadow box, pretending I'm hitting certain politicians.\\"New York Times. \\"Washington Talk: Briefing; Pity the Mugger\\" by Peter T. Kilborn and Martin Tolchin. June 8, 1988. Vaughn's son, also named Jack Vaughn, is a record producer who has run his own label, Slimstyle Records, and now heads Comedy Central's record label. In a 2006 story in the Wall Street Journal, Vaughn said that since 2002, Comedy Central Records have gradually increased to about 10 releases a year. \\"We make money on 80% to 90% of our releases,\\" Vaughn says. Industry insiders call this a good percentage since most new releases in the music industry lose money.Wall Street Journal. \\"Comedy Central Corners The Laughs Business\\" by Joe Flint.

From Personal Recollections, Letters and Official Documents (2 volumes, London: Hurst & Blackett, 1862); reprinted by Elibron Classics, 2005 , Volume 1 pp. 363-7, 372. After a year in the Mediterranean while the political situation changed, the ship took a prominent part in the Syrian War against the expansionist designs of Mehmet Ali, notably at the bombardment of Acre, 3 November 1840, where she sustained damage but no casualties. Powerful was then flagship of the squadron that blockaded Alexandria from 25 November. In 1841 Napier was succeeded as her captain by George Mansel, and then Sir Michael Seymour, who commanded her from 1841 until she paid off at Portsmouth in 1843. She was recommissioned in 1848 under the command of Sir Richard Saunders Dundas under whom she again served in the Mediterranean. She was used as a target in 1860, and was broken up in 1864.

Fifteen and send time (FAST) is a dog agility competition offered by the American Kennel Club. FAST can be thought of as a free-style agility competition similar to Gamblers in USDAA or ASCA agility. The course is laid out in no particular order, with points awarded for the successful completion of obstacles at the handler's discretion. Fifteen obstacles (or obstacle combinations) of a specified point value are arranged according to the judge's preference. Some obstacles are bidirectional (may be taken in either direction), while others are not. A bonus area (the \\"send\\") is marked off with tape. To successfully complete the send, the handler must stay outside this taped-off area while the dog completes the obstacles in order. FAST allows dogs that may not be quite ready to complete a regular course to compete, as not all obstacles need be completed for a qualifying score. Dogs are given a time allotment based on size, with larger dogs getting a shorter time in which to accumulate points. FAST specifics =Obstacles= *15 obstacles that are assigned point values (of which 6 are bar jumps) *2 through to 10 can be individual or flow obstacles *6 bar jumps (typically winged) are worth 1 point each (no bars are re-set during a run if displaced).

Career From 1970 to 2000, he founded and directed an import/export group of hand and power tool companies that bears his name. The Groupe Sensemat became the largest private employer of the Gers with over 500 collaborators in 1999 and sales totaling 800 million French francs (122 M Euros). The company‚Äôs growth is owed to the globalization of trade. As early as 1975, import-export operations were organized with India, China, Romania, Albania and other countries of the Eastern bloc, sometimes using barter and compensation. The Groupe Sensemat became a privileged supplier of the European major hypermarket retailers. Through his tool-manufacturing group, he then acquired many brownfields in the department of the Gers (the Grundig Factory, the Seita buildings, etc.). As a major player in the department‚Äôs economic life, he was a counselor with the Gers‚Äô Bank of France for 6 years. He was Vice President of the Gers‚Äô Employers' Union in 1989, and he founded the Gers‚Äô UNICEF committee in 1988. He also founded a local newspaper: \\"La Gascogne\\". In 1990, he purchased LIP, the renowned watchmaking company that was then in difficulty, and relaunched it. Then, in 1992 he acquired other brands: Achille Zavatta, Teppaz, and Luis Oca√±a. In 2000, his strongly coveted hand and power tool group faced problems leading to the lifetime dismissal of a court administrator who was found guilty and imprisoned. The Sensemat Group disappeared. In 2002, he transferred the LIP brand international license to the Gersoise company MGH of Lectoure. That same year, he was named Honorary Consul of the Republic of Albania for thirty-three French departments. He conducted his business from his company based in Toulouse. In 2007, he immigrated to Canada with his family. He was received by the Canadian government as a Business Immigrant (Investor). In Montreal he founded Gestion Geneen Inc., a business and wealth management company. In 2013, he created the Editions Duroi in Quebec, Canada. In 2016, the French businessman, Canadian citizen since 2015, sells the LIP brand to its licensee Jean-Luc Bernerd, President of JLB Brand.

Located on a long island off the western coast of Umnak Island, it lies north-northwest of Nikolski Bay. The site documents one of the earliest known human settlements in the Aleutian Islands, dating to c. 6400 BCE. It was in the 1970s believed to be a remnant of people thought to have migrated here across the land bridge from Asia. The site is believed to have been along the southern fringe of the hypothesized Bering land bridge, by which (according to that theory) the Americas were first settled. At the time of its settlement, sea level was believed to be lower (by about ), and the area consisted of a strandflat surrounded by nutrient-rich waters and abundant wildlife. The immediate area of the settlement is also surrounded by evidence of volcanic ashfalls, which are theorized to contribute to the eventual abandomnent of the site, leading to the settlement of other parts of Beringia. The Anangula site was first discovered by William S. Laughlin in 1938, when surface surveys identified the area as of potential interest. In the 1950s additional research was done in the area, but its great age was not understood until its major features were found, buried beneath of volcanic deposits. Excavations in the late 1960s uncovered all or part of eight house remains, and recovered more than 30,000 artifacts, some of which bore little resemblance to other North American finds at the time. These structures were partially subterranean, measuring about by , and were apparently designed to house single families. The site was first listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Ananiuliak Island Archeological District in 1972, and was declared a National Historic Landmark District in 1978.  Etymology  The island has historically been identified by a variety of spellings and pronunciations. Its Aleut name was reported by Capt. Lutke (1836, p. 299) as \\"Anangouliak\\" and by Father Veniaminov (1840, v. 1, p. 156) as \\"Ananulyak\\". This island was called 'O (strov) Anayulyakh \\" or \\"Anayulyakh Island\\" by Capt.

It is also known as naryn in Xinjiang, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, as turama or dograma in Karakalpakstan, North Caucasus and Turkmenistan, and as kullama in Bashkortostan and Tatarstan. The term beshbarmak means \\"five fingers\\", because nomads traditionally eat this dish with their hands. Beshbarmak is usually made from finely chopped boiled meat, mixed with noodles and chyk, an onion sauce. It is typically served in a big, round dish, after shorpo, which is a first course of mutton broth served in bowls called kese. It is also followed by a broth called ak-serke (shorpo mixed with kymyz or ayran), which is thought to help with settling the stomach. Festive beshbarmak can be cooked together with kazy and chuchuk. Historical background The cuisine of Central Asia developed within the constraints of a nomadic life, when people were completely reliant on their animals. This is reflected in Central Asian dishes, which are rich in meat and dairy products. The serving ritual The serving of beshbarmak is steeped in ritual. If an animal, such as a sheep, was slaughtered in a guest's honor, then the host serves ustukan, different cuts of meat, to different people, depending on their gender, age, and rank in the social structure. As a sign of respect, the oldest people and honored guests are always presented the prime cuts of the meat. Festive beshbarmak served with kazy sausage On special occasions, the guest of honor, the eldest male, or the youngest male, receives the bash, the head of the animal, and cuts pieces from it to distribute to other people. The oldest men or aksakal receives the jambash, the thigh bone. The oldest and most respected women receive the kuiruk or kuymulchak, the tailbone. The legs and shoulders are presented to the younger adults, and the smaller bones are reserved for the daughter-in-law of the house. The omurtka, the spine, is given to the children. Other ustukans include the joto j√Øl√Øk, tibia or shin bone, the kashka j√Øl√Øk, thigh or femur bone, the bone from rib to thigh called the karchiga, a rib without fat called the kara kabirga, the kar j√Øl√Øk or radius bone, dalii or shoulder blade, the toshi, breast or brisket, and the kung j√Øl√Øk, bone from the leg to the shoulder blade. Preparation In the classic variant of beshbarmak, as it is now prepared in northern Kyrgyzstan (especially in the Naryn region), a good, sharp knife called maki () is required, to thinly dice all the ingredients before they are put on the dastarkhan. The dish also requires a pot to boil the meat and noodles in, and a rolling pin to roll out the noodles, also the use forks with five needles on it to help with the tradition Beshbarmak is prepared by first boiling a piece of meat, such as the rump of a horse, or a rack of lamb, or kazy or chuchuk horsemeat sausage. In warm seasons, beshbarmak is usually made with mutton. The noodle dough is made from flour, water, eggs, and salt, and rested for 40 minutes. Then the dough is rolled out very thinly, and cut into noodles. The noodles are boiled in meat broth for 3-4 minutes. The boiled noodles and finely chopped meat are placed on a tray (tabak) and thoroughly mixed with sauce (called chyk or tuzdyk, made of onion, ground black pepper and hot meat broth). Finely chopped meat in beshbarmak is a sign of respect for the elders and guests. Presentation is also important. The dish is served on big platter. Hospitality is serious business in Central Asia. Ordinarily, being invited for beshbarmak is an honor. Guests are never invited to sit at an empty table, but beshbarmak is always presented after all the guests have been assembled. It is still a dish that carries with it nomadic identity, and not one to be taken lightly.

It includes sixteen prehistoric mounds which have yielded evidence of very early Birnirk and Thule culture. It is the type site of the Birnirk culture, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962 for its archaeological importance in understanding prehistoric Arctic cultures. Description Birnirk is located on the Alaska North Slope, near the settlement of Utqiagvik, on land owned by the Ukpeaƒ°vik I√±upiat Corporation since 1988. The site consists of sixteen mounds, which represent dwelling sites across a fairly wide span of time. Major scientific excavations were made at this site in 1936, and in 1951-53, when three mounds were excavated, and in 1959, when seven mounds were partially excavated. The major period of occupation at this site was during what is now designated the Birnirk culture, between 500 and 900 CE. Evidence was also found at one mound of occupation during the later Thule culture, which was generally active 1100-1400 CE. Finds at the site include harpoon heads made of antler and stone, including at least one from the older Punuk culture. Also uncovered were fragments of wood making up elements of traditional seal-hunting umiaks. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1962, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. The major collections of materials from the site made in the 1950s were located at Harvard University's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology for many years, but were moved to the University of Alaska Museum of the North in Fairbanks in 2011.

Over-the-counter counseling (or OTC counseling) refers to the counseling that a pharmacist may provide on the subject of initiating, modifying, or stopping an over-the-counter (OTC) drug product. OTC counseling requires an assessment of the patient's self-care concerns and drug-related needs. The types of drugs that are involved in OTC counseling are, for example, used to treat self-diagnosable conditions like heartburn, cough, and rashes, though prescription drugs and professional diagnoses are also relevant to the recommendation process. Purpose The aim of OTC counseling is to empower patients to take control of their healthcare-related needs for conditions that do not require an appointment with a medical doctor. This benefits the healthcare system by reducing unnecessary physician visits. The pharmacist can also use OTC counseling to ensure the highest likelihood of success for the patient's self-care attempt and minimize the risk of any drug- related problems. Although OTC drugs are generally regarded as safe for use without a prescription (by definition), medication errors still occur. For example, patients sometimes misuse OTC products by taking larger than recommended doses, in order to bring about symptomatic relief more quickly, or even intentionally abuse them for unlabeled indications. Even when a patient is instructed not to use OTC products without speaking with their primary care physician, patients can still fail to identify products as OTC medications worth avoiding. Technique A pharmacist can use both open-ended questions (that start with the word who, what, how, why or where) as well as close-ended questions (that start with the word will, can, do or did) which are to be used only if the former do not get the appropriate response in order to obtain relevant information about a patient's potential needs for treatment or potential drug-therapy problems. Pharmacists ask patients about comorbidities to avoid any drug-disease state contraindications. =Formal frameworks= Although OTC counseling does not necessarily involve the use of a formal framework, various frameworks have been proposed: QuEST The QuEST approach has been described as both \\"short\\" and \\"systematic.\\" It takes the form of the following: * Qu : Quickly and accurately assess the patient (via SCHOLAR) * E : Establish appropriateness for self-care * S : Suggest appropriate self-care strategies * T : Talk with the patient SCHOLAR * S : Symptoms * C : Characteristics * H : History * O : Onset * L : Location * A : Aggravating factors * R : Remitting factors SCHOLAR-MAC As above, with the following addition: * M : Medications * A : Allergies * C : Conditions WWHAM The WWHAM method is not strict; there is no requirement that the OTC counseling follow the exact order of the mnemonic. It takes the form of the following: * W : Who is the patient * W : What are the symptoms * H : How long have the symptoms been present * A : Action taken * M : Medication being taken ASMETHOD The ASMETHOD has been attributed to the London pharmacist, Derek Balon. It takes the form of the following: * A : Age/appearance * S : Self or someone else * M : Medication * E : Extra medicines * T : Time persisting * H : History * O : Other symptoms * D : Danger symptoms ENCORE The ENCORE method helps pharmacists focus intently on the patient's presenting symptoms while considering the appropriate OTC recommendation. It takes the form of the following: * E : Explore :*N : Nature of the symptoms :*O : Obtain the identity of the patient :*C : Concurrent medications :*E : Exclude the possibility of a serious disease :*O : Other associated symptoms * N : No medication; consider a non- pharmacological approach as appropriate * C : Care :*G : Geriatric patient :*P : Pediatric patient :*P : Pregnant women :*L : Lactating mothers * O : Observe :*O : Other tell-tale signs of the condition :*D : Demeanor of the patient :*D : Dramatization by the patient * R : Refer :*P : Potentially serious case of the disease :*P : Persistent symptoms (or failure of previous therapy) :*P : Patients at increased risk (e.g. diabetic patients with a wound on the underside of the foot) * E : Explain your recommendation SIT DOWN SIR * S : Site or location of a sign/symptom * I : Intensity or severity * T : Type or nature * D : Duration * O : Onset * W : With (other symptoms) * N : Annoyed or aggravated by * S : Spread or radiation * I : Incidence or frequency * R : Relieved by Subject areas =Proton-pump inhibitors= For the selection of OTC proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), pharmacists must first determine whether or not a patient is likely to benefit from self-care for the treatment of their acid reflux symptoms. Examples of exclusions to self-care treatment of acid-reflux symptoms include a positive family history of gastrointestinal cancers, since their symptoms may reflect a more serious, underlying condition, and patients that present with so-called \\"alarm symptoms,\\" which require a prompt evaluation by a diagnostician. The available PPIs labeled for OTC use varies by country. As of October 2015, in the United States, available OTC proton-pump inhibitors include omeprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole, whereas the UK approves the OTC use of omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole. =Dietary supplements= Whether or not pharmacists should be involved with selling dietary supplements, which are not approved for the treatment or prevention of any disease or disorder, is the subject of much ethical debate. However, a 2009 review of the literature found that the common perception was that pharmacists should be involved in the OTC counseling process for dietary supplements where dietary supplements are sold. As experts in drug therapies that cause vitamin depletion, there are several recommendations that pharmacists commonly make. For example, pharmacists sometimes advise patients on long-term metformin therapy to supplement with vitamin B12 to treat or prevent diabetic peripheral neuropathy. =Cancer= While there are currently no OTC medications available for the treatment of cancer in the United States, there are specific OTC recommendations that apply to cancer patients that do not apply to the general population. Even a common OTC medication like acetaminophen may pose a risk to cancer patients by masking the presence of fever, which is an important sign of a serious side effect of some chemotherapy regimens called febrile neutropenia. =Upper respiratory tract infections= During OTC counseling, pharmacists differentiate between self-care appropriate upper respiratory tract infections, like the common cold, and potentially devastating infections like the flu. =Urinary incontinence= Pharmacists can offer non-pharmacological, behavioral counseling for patients suffering from urinary incontinence. This includes teaching patients about the important behavioral interventions that can reduce their symptoms and improve quality of life. This can include recommending daily Kegel exercises, and instructing patients on the proper technique. In addition, pharmacists can provide resources for patients to learn more about how to control their symptoms. In terms of medications, pharmacists can help patients identify medications that may be worsening or causing their urinary incontinence, or offer recommendations for prescription medications for patients to take to their physicians. Comparison to prescription drug counseling OTC counseling patients about self-care and non-prescription drugs does not follow the same format as counseling for prescription drugs. A pharmacist who counsels for a prescription drug can view a patient's profile, which includes their current list of concurrent medications and allergies to medications. However, an OTC counseling session may occur in the aisle of the store, forcing pharmacists to elicit the necessary information from patients directly.

Classic Images [Muscatine, Iowa] 01 Feb 2000: 52. Early years Mahon was born in Bakersfield, California and attended the Page Military Academy (now Page Private School) in Los Angeles and graduated from Laguna Blanca Boys School in Santa Barbara, California. He learned to fly while in high school.Ryan, Craig Magnificent Failure: Free Fall from the Edge of Space Smithsonian Institution, 2 September, 2014 In 1941 he joined the Royal Air Force, and by the winter was flying combat with No. 121 (Eagle) Squadron, composed of American volunteers. Pilot Officer Mahon damaged three German fighters and two Focke-Wulf Fw 190s in April and a Messerschmitt Bf 109 in May, before scoring his first confirmed victories of two Fw 190s, downed in the Saint-Omer area, on June 8, 1942. On July 31 he destroyed two more Fw 190s over the Berck-Sur-Mer area and became an ace while covering the commando raid on Dieppe, August 19, 1942, his 98th fighter pilot mission. At 08:30, flying his Spitfire Vb, nicknamed \\"Barry\\", Mahon shot down an Fw 190 and another Fw 190 before his plane was hit and he was forced to bail out of the burning aircraft. Landing in the sea, he was taken prisoner. Although Mahon filed a claim for shooting down two Germans that day, he was only given credit for one after the war. Thus, for a tally-record of five confirmed, two probables and three damaged Mahon received the British Distinguished Flying Cross in 1985. Mahon was imprisoned at Stalag Luft III and managed to escape, but was captured on the Czechoslovakian border. He escaped later, only to be recaptured again, and was finally liberated by Patton's 3rd Army in 1945. Post war cinema career After the war he became the personal pilot for, and later the manager of, Errol Flynn. Having produced a number of Flynn and Gina Lollobrigida pictures including the abortive William Tell, as well as a considerable output of children's programs, Mahon established The Production Machine, a high-tech film production company in Hollywood, making motion pictures for theatrical and television release. Mahon was the first movie producer to adapt and apply computer technology (as well spreadsheet applications, such as MultiPlan) to the breakdown, scheduling, budgeting and financial analysis of feature-length motion pictures and movies-of-the-week for Columbia Pictures.

The area was incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940 (after the Soviet occupation of Northern Bukovina) and again in 1944 (after the Soviet occupation of Romania), and has been part of Ukraine since 1991. History Following the Union of Bukovina with Romania decided by the General Congress of Bukovina on 15/28 November 191, the CernƒÉu»õi County was created on 18 December 1918 by the Decree No. 3715 for the administration of Bukovina. In 1925, according to the Law of Administrative Unification of 14 June 1925, the territory of the county was enlarged in the north with the former Zastavna and Cozmeni counties. In 1938, the county was abolished and incorporated into the newly formed »öinutul Suceava, together with the counties of Hotin, Suceava, Storojine»õ, Dorohoi, RƒÉdƒÉu»õi and C√¢mpulung. In 1940, following the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact and the Soviet ultimatum on 26 June 1940, Northern Bukovina (including the whole CernƒÉu»õi County) was occupied by the Soviet Union and incorporated into the USSR (Chernivtsi Oblast, Ukrainian SSR). CernƒÉu»õi County was re-established (as part of the Bukovina Governorate) after Northern Bukovina was recovered by Romania in July 1941, following the invasion of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, in August 1944 the Northern Bukovina was taken over again by the Soviet Army, and the borders as of 1 January 1941 were confirmed by the 1947 Paris Peace Treaties.

Fictional character biography Gabriel Stacy fighting Spider-Man. The story arc \\"Sins Past\\" by J. Michael Straczynski in The Amazing Spider-Man #509-514 (August 2004-January 2005) reveals that Osborn fathered twins with Gwen, a boy and a girl to whom were given birth while in France. Gwen vowed to raise the twins with Peter Parker and refused to allow Norman access, seeing the disregard for Norman's eldest son. Seeing her as a threat to his potential heirs, Osborn killed Gwen. Norman then raised Gwen's two children, a boy named Gabriel and a girl named Sarah. Due to Norman's enhanced blood, the twins aged about 2-3 times faster than normal and were adults within the span of a few years (speculated to be between 5 and 9 years old). Osborn told them that Peter was really their father and was responsible for their mother's death.The Amazing Spider-Man #513 Gabriel and Sarah then attack Spider-Man, and Spider- Man subsequently deduces their true identities thanks to a note they sent that had been written by Gwen while in Paris. However, seeking to confirm it, Peter goes to Gwen's grave and digs up a sample of Gwen's DNA to compare to the twin's DNA which was obtained from the envelope of the letter. During a brief confrontation with Sarah just after the DNA analysis completed, Peter learns that she clearly resembles her mother, but is forced to escape when Gabriel attacks. Spider-Man tells Mary Jane Watson about the initial encounter with Gabriel and Sarah, whereupon Mary Jane reveals of knowing about Norman's involvement with Gwen and tells all to Peter. Mary Jane has kept it from Peter all these years because Gwen was distraught and begged Mary Jane not to say anything, as well as not wanting to taint Peter's memory of the only woman Peter ever loved as much as ‚Äî if not more than ‚Äî Mary Jane.The Amazing Spider- Man #510 Arranging a press conference, Spider-Man tells the twins to meet Spider-Man on the bridge where Gwen died, telling them the truth about their origins. Sarah believes Spider-Man ‚Äî concluding that Spider-Man would never have dug up Gwen's grave to acquire a DNA sample if Spider-Man thought there was even a chance of being their father, Spider-Man having never even run his own DNA against theirs because Peter and Gwen never reached that stage in their relationship ‚Äî but Gabriel does not, resulting in him attempting to attack Spider-Man only to accidentally shoot Sarah. With their metabolisms out of control due to the Goblin formula they inherited from Osborn, Gabriel returns to a secret Goblin base that Osborn told them to travel to after they had completed their mission, taking the Goblin formula and briefly be the Grey Goblin - the Goblin formula apparently stabilizing his aging problem at the cost of what remains of his sanity - while Sarah is taken to hospital and is given a transfusion of Spider-Man's blood while in the hospital. Spider-Man's abnormal blood also serving to stabilize her condition, both physically and mentally (with Mary Jane imagining Spider-Man 'kicking Norman's ass' on a cellular level as his blood defeats the anomalies created by the Green Goblin formula in Sarah's system). When Grey Goblin tries to attack the weakened Spider-Man, Sarah shoots Grey Goblin's glider, recognizing that Spider-Man is not responsible for their mother's death, causing an explosion that results in her brother vanishing. Sarah flees from the hospital, while Gabriel is later found washed up on a beach with no memory of what happened.The Amazing Spider- Man #514 A follow-up story to \\"Sins Past\\" was published in The Spectacular Spider-Man (Vol. 2) #23-26 (December 2004-March 2005), titled \\"Sins Remembered\\" written by Samm Barnes with art by Scot Eaton. Spinning directly out of the events of The Amazing Spider-Man #509-514, Spider-Man locates Sarah in Paris, where Sarah has her brother (suffering from amnesia) restrained in her home. With the help of Spider-Man and Interpol, Sarah helps build a case against a criminal called Monsieur Dupres in exchange for the Interpol's help with her rapid-aging disease which is causing her, and Gabriel, severe headaches. However, during this time Gabriel escapes, prompting Sarah to join Interpol in hopes of finding her brother.The Spectacular Spider-Man (Vol. 2) #23-26 This story arc was later collected as a trade paperback in 2005 as The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol. 5: Sins Remembered (). J. Michael Straczynski ultimately wished to retcon the characters out of existence using the events of the \\"One More Day\\" story arc, but was not permitted to do so. The villain Menace is referred to as the \\"Grey Goblin\\" to which Spider-Man reacts by having \\"enough problems without yet another Grey Goblin to deal with\\".Amazing Spider-Man #549 Later, one of Norman's male test subjects is identified as \\"G. Stacy\\", yet Spider-Man states that Harry Osborn is Norman's \\"only son\\" (although this may have been metaphorical).The Amazing Spider-Man #598 It's stated that only a woman who has taken his Green Goblin serum can be impregnated, which contradicts how the twins were conceived.The Amazing Spider-Man #599 Lastly, Molecule Man's torment of the Dark Avengers includes Osborn hallucinating Gwen pregnant about to be killed.Dark Avengers #11 Gabriel officially returned in the American Son mini-series (although Sarah's whereabouts are still unknown) as the second version of American Son. He introduces himself to Harry then shoots his half-brother in the chest.Amazing Spider-Man presents: American Son #1 But American Son appears and saves Harry. After his attempt on Harry's life, Gabriel confronts the American Son battle suit and demands to know why \\"he\\" interfered.Amazing Spider-Man presents: American Son #2 It is subsequently revealed that Gabriel has stolen the American Son armor and is now suffering from a split personality, committing crimes as himself while American Son undoes the damage he has caused, identifying itself as the part of Gabriel that recognizes that what he is doing is wrong.Amazing Spider-Man presents: American Son #3 Gabriel hears a planned ambush by a police squad and proceeds to attack; before he can do any real damage, however, he is stopped by Spider-Man. Later, after kidnapping reporter Norah Winters and luring Harry to a vacant warehouse, Gabriel makes another attempt on Harry's life. While locked in combat with Harry, the two discuss their respective views of their father. Harry attempts to convince Gabriel that Norman is an evil monster who only craves death and power while Gabriel tells Harry that his brother's a waste of the Osborn bloodline. Saddened by the inability to reach Gabriel, Harry reveals hacking into the American Son armor and quickly over powers Gabriel. After Gabriel is defeated the warehouse is set on fire and the half-brothers are saved by Spider-Man and a police squad. Following his capture, Gabriel is placed in a psychiatric hospital, and informed that the American Son suit is thought to be destroyed. However, a package is soon delivered to his room containing the American Son helmet and a note from Norman telling him of loving Gabriel and missing his son.Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son #4 Powers and abilities Due to the Goblin formula's enhanced blood, Gabriel Stacy and Sarah Stacy aged about 2-3 times faster than normal and were adults within the span of a few years. Their enhanced blood also gave the twins a slight increase in strength, reflexes, healing and endurance. But the aging causes the twins to suffer severe headaches. Sarah's condition is stabilized through a blood transfusion from Spider-Man, leaving her significantly more mentally stable (although her precise strength level is unclear). As the Grey Goblin, Gabriel later took the another Goblin serum to have his condition stabilized which granted him further increased superhuman strength while also driving him insane. He adopts the Green Goblin's Halloween-themed appearance, dressing in a Goblin costume and using an arsenal of high-tech weapons, notably grenade-like \\"Pumpkin Bombs\\" and a bat-shaped \\"goblin glider\\". Gabriel later acquired the American Son armor which granted him further strength and stamina. Other versions * During the 2015 Secret Wars event, a vampiric Grey Goblin can be seen chasing Blade and Howard the Duck.Secret Wars: Battleworld #2 Character development J. Michael Straczynski later stated originally wanting Peter Parker to be the father of Gwen Stacy's kids but the editors vetoed the idea, but felt that it would age the protagonist too much if he had two adult children. It was then decided by the whole creative and editorial team that Norman Osborn would be the father.SBC.com (no date): All the Rage (column) - \\"Don't Panic\\", by Blair Marnell & John Voulieris In other media The Grey Goblin appears in Spider-Man Unlimited as an alternative version of Green Goblin.
