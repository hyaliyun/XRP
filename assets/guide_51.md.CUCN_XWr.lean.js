As an associate professor at Louisiana State University in the Department of Geology and Geophysics and one of the curators at the Museum of Natural Science, Warny studies past climate change patterns by examining fossilized pollen and spores. She is currently the vice president of the Gulf Coast Section of the Society for Sedimentary Geology (GCSSEPM).  Early life and education  Warny was educated at the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) where she earned a BS and a PhD in Marine Geology and Micropaleontology; and at the Universit√© de Li√®ge where she earned a DEA in Oceanography.  Career and impact  After completing her Ph.D., Warny came to the U.S. where she held a joint appointed as assistant professor of research at Louisiana State University and education director at the Louisiana Museum of Natural Science. In 2008‚Äì2014 she was appointed assistant professor and in 2014 promoted to associate professor. She has continued her involvement with the Natural Science Museum, where she currently serves as one of the curators for the museum. Warny is a palynologists/paleobotanist and has played a key role in expanding our understanding of Antarctic climate evolution. Working with the Antarctic Offshore Stratigraphy (ANTOSTRAT) team, she provided evidence for Antarctica having experienced significant warming during the mid-Miocene, when land temperatures reached 10 ¬∞C, and that liquid precipitation was notably higher at that time. Later, working with SHALDRIL cores she established compelling evidence that the Antarctic Peninsula lagged the rest of the continent by several million years in its transition into polar conditions. In recent years her research has reached further back in geological time to include the warm Eocene and Oligocene, providing new insights into how Antarctica transitioned from Greenhouse to Icehouse conditions. Throughout her career, Warny has remained heavily engaged in public education through her involvement with the LSU Museum of Natural Science. She has helped to design exhibits that have received national recognition. She has also played a key role in establishing new techniques in forensic palynology that have been used nationally. One of her greatest contributions was as a key player in the highly successful Polar Palooza program. In addition to conducting paleoenvironmental research in Antarctica, she is also working on sections in the Mediterranean Sea (her doctoral focus), in the Gulf of Mexico, in Canada, in Tanzania, and in Papua New Guinea via doctoral student projects and collaborations. To this date, she has advised 15 MS and PhD projects.  Awards and honors  Warny was awarded the AASP Graduate Student Award in 1996, a UCL Dissertation Award in 1999, a NSF CAREER Award in 2011, and the LSU Rising Faculty Research Award in 2014. Warny was nominated as one of the six 2018‚Äì2019 AAPG Distinguished Lecturers.

The 1995 CIA disinformation controversy arose when the Central Intelligence Agency revealed that between 1986 and 1994, it had delivered intelligence reports to the U.S. government based on agent reporting from confirmed or suspected Soviet operatives. From 1985 to his arrest in February 1994, CIA officer and KGB mole Aldrich Ames compromised Agency sources and operations in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, leading to the arrest of many CIA agents and the execution of at least ten of them. This allowed the KGB to replace the CIA agents with its own operatives or to force them to cooperate, and the double agents then funneled a mixture of disinformation and true material to U.S. intelligence. Although the CIA's Soviet-East European (SE) and Central Eurasian divisions knew or suspected the sources to be Soviet double agents, they nevertheless disseminated this \\"feed\\" material within the government. Some of these intelligence reports even reached Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, as well as President-elect Bill Clinton. The disclosure of the deception in 1995, following investigations into the Ames case, led to a media stir and heavy congressional criticism. The Agency's Inspector General, Frederick Hitz, identified 12 CIA personnel he deemed responsible for the lapse, including three former directors; CIA Director John M. Deutch criticized seven of these employees, calling the affair \\"a major intelligence failure\\". A damage assessment determined that the disinformation altered intelligence analyses of the Soviet (and later Russian) military towards the end of the Cold War, creating a false impression of Soviet strength; however, initial charges that the faulty reports led to billions of dollars' worth of Pentagon spending proved to be exaggerated. Regardless, the revelation further undermined the CIA's credibility in the wake of the Ames case. Background Aldrich Ames, a CIA counterintelligence agent working in the SE Division, approached the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C. on April 16, 1985, and within a month received $50,000 from the KGB in exchange for espionage service. Meeting with Soviet official and go-between Sergey Dmitriyevich Chuvakhin on June 13, Ames passed him copied documents identifying over ten Soviet agents working for the CIA and FBI. As a CIA review related, the Soviets began arresting and sometimes executing U.S. operatives later in 1985, and the CIA realized that it \\"was faced with a major CI problem.\\" Suspicions initially fell on Edward Lee Howard, a former CIA officer who also compromised CIA operations in 1985 and defected to the Soviet Union on September 21. However, the CIA realized by fall 1985 that Howard was not responsible for all of the damage. Three agents arrested in fall 1985 and later executed, some of the CIA's most valuable sources, had been betrayed by Ames, not Howard. By December, six SE agents had vanished, a trend which continued into 1986; according to a congressional report, the over 20 operations Ames revealed \\"amounted to a virtual collapse of the CIA's Soviet operations.\\" Ames, who stated that he spied for the KGB due to his financial debt, gave thousands of pages of classified documents to the Soviets and later admitted to disclosing over 100 CIA, FBI, military, and allied operations; he was deemed responsible for the arrests and executions of ten U.S. sources. FBI wanted poster of U.S. defector Edward Lee Howard. Moreover, by compromising CIA methods, Ames enabled the KGB and its successor, the SVR, to filter feed material to the CIA from 1986 to 1993. In 1987, KGB agent Aleksandr Zhomov offered to sell the CIA intelligence on how the Soviets had detected and arrested the CIA's agents. The SE Division accepted Zhomov and assigned him the cryptonym GTPROLOGUE. Zhomov, who was actually a Soviet double agent assigned to protect Ames, furnished fake documents ascribing the CIA's agent losses to superior KGB surveillance and luck. He then told the CIA that he would identify upcoming KGB plants, but only on the condition that the CIA treat them as genuine, lest the KGB discover the leak and arrest him. The fake agents soon overwhelmed Moscow Station's resources, and Zhomov disappeared in July 1990 after receiving payment from the U.S. The spurious sources and the disinformation they provided reportedly convinced the CIA that the 1985‚Äì1986 debacle was an anomaly, thus protecting Ames. Other genuine CIA agents were compromised by the Soviets, who used them to feed false intelligence back to the U.S. The CIA began to investigate the disappearances of its agents, initially suspecting that bad tradecraft, a Soviet breach of Moscow Station or the CIA's communications, or a mole was responsible for the disaster. Suspicions fell on spy dust (METKA), a KGB compromise of CIA cables, or new Soviet surveillance tactics, but these probes proved unsuccessful. Ames' conspicuous spending drew the attention of the molehunters in late 1989, but he passed a polygraph test. However, the molehunt regained momentum in 1991 as it received more officers to work on the case. Attention focused on Ames and other suspects, and his finances were investigated once more in 1992; in August, the investigators linked Ames' bank deposits with his meetings with the Soviets. In March 1993, the molehunter unit concluded that there was a KGB mole within the CIA who had followed Howard, and the FBI began close surveillance of Ames, monitoring his office and home, and tracking his car. A June 25 search of his office found about 144 classified documents unrelated to his work; an analysis of his finances found an unexplained $1,326,310; and subsequent searches of Ames' trash and residence found further documents on CIA operations and agents, as well as Ames' own espionage for the KGB. On February 21, 1994, Ames and his wife, Rosario, were arrested by FBI agents: The duo pled guilty to espionage, and the Senate Intelligence Committee requested that the CIA's Inspector General review the case. Initial revelation On October 31, 1995, CIA Director John M. Deutch presented two investigations into Ames' espionage to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees: the damage assessment conducted by Executive Director of Intelligence Community Affairs Richard L. Haver, and CIA Inspector General Frederick P. Hitz's report. The reports indicated that in the 1980s and 1990s, as a result of Ames' betrayal, the CIA had given presidents and other senior officials intelligence derived from Soviet double agents. Hitz also recommended reprimands for nearly 12 serving and former CIA officers, including several deputy directors for operations and former directors William H. Webster, Robert M. Gates, and R. James Woolsey Jr., \\"for not closely supervising sensitive information sent to the president.\\" Hitz's report also claimed that CIA officers in the Directorate of Operations (DO) distributed sensitive intelligence reports despite suspecting that their sources were Soviet-controlled. However, some CIA officials reportedly disputed this, saying that the dubious sources were properly identified. CIA Director John M. Deutch. The same day, Deutch publicly criticized six former, and one serving, CIA officers for the \\"devastating\\" intelligence failure, although he did not hold three of his predecessors accountable. He stated that would create an independent, National Intelligence Council-managed Customer Review Process for agent reporting, and said that he had already installed new management, stressed counterintelligence at the CIA, and established new accountability boards, among other reforms. Deutch added that if the 12 CIA officers cited in Hitz's report were still employed, he would have fired two of them. He said that he had reprimanded the only officer still at the Agency, that the two officers he would have fired were \\"banned from future employment with the Agency,\\" and that four others had been reprimanded or warned. Deutch insisted that efforts to improve counterintelligence would prevent a recurrence of the Ames \\"catastrophe,\\" and provided the FBI with the damage assessment report so the Bureau could assist in subsequent investigations. The CIA's 1995 damage assessment report singled out former SE Division reports chief Robert Lubbehusen for sending reports without disclosing that they were from double agents, despite Agency rules requiring warnings on such reports. He and other mid-level officers allegedly saw the controlled-agent reporting as genuine and feared that revealing the reports' sources would distract officials from the supposedly valuable intelligence. He may have also been swayed by pressure from the Defense Department for more intelligence. According to reporter James Risen, reports officers were sometimes more knowledgeable about CIA sources than case officers, and were \\"often the first to see the raw intelligence and thus had the opportunity to describe the sources in the reports.\\" Following approval by the SE Division's chief, CIA intelligence analysts would then view the reports, but had to rely on the reports officers to describe the sources. However, one anonymous source backed Lubbehusen, saying that some of the intelligence may have been genuine material sent by the Soviets to bolster their moles' bona fides. Even after Lubbehusen was removed, his successors continued to leave out disclosures on reports, although Lubbehusen's reprimand was reputedly the strongest of the seven Deutch issued. Congressional and Pentagon investigations Congressional committee members stated that the blend of genuine information and disinformation altered American perceptions of the USSR and possibly affected billions of dollars' worth of military acquisition decisions. Congress pointed to the multibillion-dollar F-22 fighter project as a possible result of inflated estimates on the USSR. Committee members charged that the CIA never warned the recipients of the suspicious intelligence because it sought to protect dubious sources; they cited a case in which a CIA officer forwarded 16 reports without mentioning that they were derived from a confirmed Soviet agent. In another case, questioned sources provided documents on a new Soviet anti-aircraft missile indicating it had a new capability, prompting costly American spending on aircraft radar. Senator Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called the revelation \\"mind-boggling\\" and sought a hearing with Webster, Gates, and Woolsey. However, Representative Larry Combest (R-Tex.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, stressed that \\"nothing has been proven\\" and that the intelligence may not have been wholly spurious. Intelligence officials countered that Specter's claims of the reports' damage were exaggerated, saying that development and acquisition decisions would never be based solely on agent reporting. Senator Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.), vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, criticized Deutch's refusal to deem the three former CIA directors responsible, saying that they \\"should have known\\" about the tainted reports. Kerrey also cited an October 30 letter from the three former directors to Deutch, in which they defended themselves and suggested investigating the CIA's Inspector General; the trio insisted that they knew nothing of the reports and said they should not be faulted for the incident. Webster, Gates, and Woolsey stated that Hitz, in a 1991 report on the SE Division, did not highlight the problem of faulty intelligence. The trio claimed they had never seen the report and argued that Hitz had failed to detect the disinformation operation. The former directors also asked Deutch to publicly announce that he would not hold them accountable, which Kerrey denounced, saying that accountability was needed to improve Agency morale. Richard Kerr, the CIA's Deputy Director in 1991, stated that the CIA debated the authenticity of 1988 Soviet military documents provided by suspected double agents, which were forwarded to the Pentagon regardless. Kerr said he never saw Hitz's 80-page report, although a CIA spokesman confirmed that Webster's office had received it. On November 9, 1995, Specter revealed that from 1986 to 1994, the CIA gave Defense officials, Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, and President-elect Bill Clinton 95 reports from suspected or known Soviet/Russian sources. For 35 of these reports, which dealt with weapons technology and arms control, the CIA believed that they came from double agents; of these, 11 were sent to presidents, and Clinton received at least one before his inauguration. According to Specter, the presidents were not alerted to the sources of the intelligence, although reports to other agencies indicated their questionable origins. The decision to continue disseminating the reports was allegedly made by mid-level DO officers \\"who thought they had screened out the disinformation.\\" On November 1, the Department of Defense said it would examine whether the disinformation had caused wasteful spending. A November 17 report by journalist Walter Pincus indicated that the review panel, led by Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Director Lt. Gen. Kenneth Minihan, had not found \\"any policy or weapon purchase decision that 'in and of itself' was shaped by tainted Soviet intelligence\\". The claim that billions of dollars had been wasted on defense spending was deemed an overreaction. Former DIA chief Lt. Gen. James R. Clapper told the House Intelligence Committee that the intelligence affected no policy or weapons acquisition decisions, which was echoed by Haver. Damage assessment report The CIA Damage Assessment Team (DAT) reviewed the credibility of all of the Agency's Soviet agents from the mid-1980s onward, then separated them into three groups: those whom Ames admitted to betraying but continued providing intelligence; those whom Ames was suspected of betraying and those whom Ames' spying may have helped the Soviets identify; and the agents whom neither Ames nor Moscow uncovered. The DAT thus deemed intelligence supplied by the first group suspicious, although investigators acknowledged that it may have included genuine material as feed. The debate over the second group's bona fides proved especially contentious, while the information from the third group of agents was considered credible despite some concerns that even they may have been compromised. Deutch related conclusions from the DAT report on December 7, 1995. Noting that Ames assisted Soviet/Russian \\"'perception management operations',\\" Deutch acknowledged that disinformation was channeled to policymakers unaware of the reports' suspect provenance, but maintained that the operations' scope and success were unclear. Deutch said that the DAT had identified 900 reports from 1985 to 1994, then found that many of the reports were sourced from Russian- and Soviet-controlled agents. While some reports indeed came with warnings, 95 reports from suspected double agents were not labelled as such. Of those, \\"at least three\\" featured in reports to the president, including two from questioned sources and one from an agent believed to be controlled. He stated that it was critical to prevent the incident from reoccurring by informing policymakers whether reports are derived from suspected double agents, reviewing whether the disinformation influenced any decisions, and, if so, deciding if and how to react. Deutch concluded that the Soviets attempted to persuade the U.S. that they retained superpower status and strong military research and development. He added that a DAT review of acquisition decisions showed the impact ranged from \\"negligible\\" to \\"measurable, but only on the margin.\\" The DAT highlighted three particular cases where the double agents influenced analysis: a late 1980s report on \\"U.S. general purpose forces\\"; analyses that altered theater-level logistics and basing plans; and reporting that possibly exaggerated Soviet/Russian \\"cruise missile and fighter aircraft R&D; programs.\\" Deutch denied that the controlled reporting influenced policy and decisions, but confirmed its \\"substantial role in framing the debate.\\" The Director also stated that the disinformation did not influence arms control negotiations, and that Ames' espionage hampered U.S. coverage of internal Soviet affairs, Soviet/Russian foreign policy (concerning nonproliferation and the CIS), and \\"The extent of the decline of Soviet and Russian military technology and procurement programs.\\" In response, Specter and Kerrey insisted that the true extent of the damage caused by Ames was still unknown, noting that the DAT had not reviewed all intelligence reports from suspect sources and that the State Department was not included in the study. Specter also quoted a Defense official who said that accelerated procurement cost about $200 million. Analysis Author Thomas Powers writes that the CIA continued to pass on reports from double agents because it sought to hide its Ames- inflicted losses. Former CIA Chief Historian Benjamin B. Fischer argues that \\"The SE Division still needed sources and still needed to produce intelligence reports,\\" which motivated it to continue disseminating material from dubious sources. Similarly, another intelligence source recalled the \\"constant demands from the Defense Department's research-and-development and weapons-procurement staffs to turn over raw Soviet military intelligence as quickly as possible.\\" Hitz later contended that the incident, which he deemed \\"the most bizarre case of fabrication during the Cold War,\\" fostered \\"a feeling that the agency couldn't be trusted.\\" As Deutch noted, the revelation also seriously damaged the CIA's credibility with senior officials.

The centre was officially opened on 24 October 2015, after the first stage of construction was completed. The centre is currently undergoing expansion, with the second of three construction phases underway. History When Vincent Tan purchased management rights for FK Sarajevo in late 2013, the lack of club owned training facilities was identified as a large obstacle to club aspirations and independency. FK Sarajevo had traditionally used the component facilities of the municipality owned Asim Ferhatoviƒá Hase Stadium which were considered outdated and did not allow for full organizational and financial independence. This fact led the club management headed by Tan and the Berjaya Group in search of a location for the construction of new and modern facilities. The neighbourhood of Butmir was eventually chosen because of its close proximity to the Sarajevo International Airport, the suburb of Ilid≈æa and because of the already existing training grounds used by a private football academy run by former FK Sarajevo captain Predrag Pa≈°iƒá. The 17 acre (70,000 square meter) land plot was jointly owned by the Ilid≈æa municipality and a local agricultural co-op, but after negotiations the club purchased the land and began preparing the large construction project. On 24 December 2014 the club signed an agreement with construction contractors for the first phase of construction to begin in July of the same year. The first phase of construction, costing allegedly 8 million KM, was completed in August 2015. On 14 December 2015 the facilities were granted a FIFA PRO licence. Facilities The training centre holds an entrance gate leading to a large plaza, water fountain, botanical gardens, bus terminus and parking lot. The main facility building will consist of a 5-star hotel holding 15 rooms, 10 studio apartments, 2 VIP apartments, a restaurant with a kitchen, a VIP restaurant, indoor and outdoor caf√©s, Wellness centre, gym, one large and two smaller conference rooms and designated administration, technical and financial floors. The centre will further be composed of an indoor futsal arena, a beach football court, shooting area, tennis courts, two large artificial turf grounds and one large natural turf ground. Furthermore, a man- made hill with an adjacent park and bungalows will encompass the centre. The entrance, plaza and grounds are completed and in use, while the second phase of construction is underway, as of 28 July 2016. The main artificial turf pitch is named after club legend ≈Ωelimir Vidoviƒá, who was killed during the Siege of Sarajevo while transporting wounded citizens to a nearby hospital. A statue of Vidoviƒá was erected on the western grass knoll that encompasses the turf. Other usage Apart from the first team, the centre is home to the FK Sarajevo Academy which trains and plays home fixtures in the facility. With the completion of the project, the centre will also include a boarding facility for the academy members, consisting of the aforementioned bungalows. Furthermore, the centre hosts the women's team which trains and plays friendly fixtures on the facility pitches. The training camp is occasionally used by the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team. It is important to note that the club employs war veterans from the Ilid≈æa municipality in the training centre as a way of giving back to the community.

The campaign succeeded with the introduction of the Old-Age Pensions Act 1908. Origins Poverty in old age was, in the late 19th century, widely recognised by social reformers as a problem capable of solution. Canon W. L. Blackley, sometime Rector of North Waltham and of King's Somborne, had called for a sick-pay and pensions system based on national insurance contributions in 1878. From 1885 Charles Booth's work had provided insight into the poverty of old age. Trade unions, friendly societies, and individuals such as Joseph Chamberlain, Samuel Barnett, George Cadbury and Benjamin Seebohm Rowntree involved themselves in the issue. A catalyst for concerted action was the passing, in New Zealand, of the Old-age Pensions Act, 1898, which provided means-tested benefits for aged people 'of good character'. Francis Herbert Stead, warden of Browning Hall and an active campaigner for social reform, invited William Pember Reeves, the New Zealand Agent General in London to speak on a number of occasions at address Browning Hall, culminating in a conference on the subject held at the hall in December 1898 attended by friendly societies, trade unionists, and addressed by Charles Booth, amongst others. Regional meetings across the country were held in the months immediately following, and by May 1899 the National Committee of Organised Labour was formed to lead and coordinate a campaign. Organisation Stead was appointed honorary secretary, and in July 1900 Frederick Booth was appointed Organising Secretary. Stead and Rogers dedicated a decade of work, writing pamphlets and books, lobbying parliament and religious leaders, and travelling the length of the country to speak for the cause. The campaign won the backing of concerned groups including the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party Conference, and the Co-operative Congress, as well as by Friendly Societies. The campaign was ended after the passing of the 1908 act, Stead going on to campaign for the provision of old-aged homes.

It is part of the tectonic belt formed by the collision of India and Asia: specifically, a segment influenced by the subduction of the Arabian plate beneath the Asian plate and forming a volcanic arc which includes the Bazman and Taftan volcanoes in Iran. The volcano consists of three main cones, with heavily eroded craters running west-northwest and surrounded by a number of subsidiary volcanic centres. Its summit is high, and the crater associated with the Miri cone has a smaller crater inside. The volcano is formed by andesite and dacite rocks, with fragmentary rocks prevailing over lava flows. The rocks have typical arc-volcano chemistry and composition, with a progression from andesite to dacite in the eruption products with younger age. Potassium-argon dating has indicated an age range from 5,900,000 to 90,000 years. Subsequent erosion has generated a large debris apron around the base of the volcano and carved rock formations which impressed early explorers; one well-known rock formation is Neza e Sultan. Geothermal activity and the emission of volcanic gases are ongoing, and the volcano has been prospected for the possibility of obtaining geothermal energy. The geothermal activity has resulted in widespread rock alteration and the formation of sulfur deposits, which were mentioned in a 1909 report and later mined. Koh-i-Sultan also has deposits of other minerals.  Geography and geology   Political geography and human history  Koh-i-Sultan is in the Chagai District of the Quetta Division, Baluchistan, Pakistan. A nearby settlement is the Nokkundi railway station, south. Henry Walter Bellew was the first to report the volcano's existence in 1862, and the Geological Survey of India conducted mining and reconnaissance operations from 1941 to 1944. In 1961, a truck- accessible mining road was built from Nokkundi to the volcano's summit. Its name, translated as \\"Mountain of the King\\", is a reference to a saint in the local Baluchi religion.  Regional  The formation of the Koh-i-Sultan volcano is related to the subduction of the Arabian Plate under the Eurasian Plate Pakistan is part of the active tectonic belt which is responsible for the formation of the Himalayas following the collision of India and Asia. As a result of this activity, hydrothermal alteration and hydrothermal activity are expected to be widespread in Pakistan. Koh-i-Sultan is the youngest volcano in Pakistan. It is tectonically influenced by the Arabian Plate subducting beneath the Eurasian Plate, forming the Chagai volcanic zone. Tectonic activity related to this subduction is ongoing. Before the onset of volcanic activity at Koh-i-Sultan in the early Quaternary, tectonic uplift occurred in the region. Koh-i-Sultan and the Iranian volcanoes Bazman and Taftan form the Sultan volcanic arc. Also known as the Makran or Baluchistan volcanic arc, it is long and stretches in an east-northeast direction. Magma generated by the relatively shallow subduction of the Indian Plate rises to the surface and forms the andesitic rocks, among others, of Taftan and Koh-i-Sultan. The related Makran subduction zone is one of the few Cretaceous zones still active, and has formed a large accretionary prism.  Local  Koh-i-Sultan is the central mountain in the Chagai Hills Koh-i-Sultan is a volcanic complex with at least three cones, named Kansuri, Abu and Miri after their respective summits. Each has a central crater‚Äîthe largest of which is over wide‚Äîwhich have been heavily affected by erosion. The summit of Koh-i-Sultan is high. and the -high Miri is considered the youngest cone. Its crater is nested; the outer crater has a diameter of and the inner crater, formed by resurgent activity, has a diameter of . Miri's summit, south of the crater, is surrounded by a zone of altered rock. Subsidiary volcanic centres also exist in the form of volcanic plugs and satellite cones; those around Miri are named Bag Koh, Batal Koh, Chhota Dalil, Dam Koh, Koh-e-Dalil, Koh-e-Malik and Mit Koh. The volcanic pile covers an area of , and the volcanic complex has an area of running west-northwest. Although Koh-i-Sultan is considered dormant or extinct, ongoing fumarolic activity has been recorded. The volcano consists of agglomerates, flows and tuff. Lava flows make up about 10 percent of the volcanic pile, and the remainder is volcaniclastic material. Other layers alternate between ash, lava and pyroclastic flows. Andesitic-dacitic materials dominate, including block-and-ash flows, lahars and tuff. Andesitic lava flows have thicknesses of ; two at Miri are and thick. The dacites form lava domes and subsidiary centres. Rock fragments are widely buried by long lava flows, and an Eocene m√©lange makes up part of the volcano's basement. The rocks follow the calc-alkaline trend of magmatic differentiation, containing silicic lavas such as dacite. Their overall composition ranges from basaltic andesite to dacite, and the dominant lava rocks are andesite and basalt. Andesites range from green to gray in colour, and dacites are pink- and light-gray. The andesitic lavas contain phenocrysts of andesine, hornblende, plagioclase and hypersthene. Dacites have biotite, hornblende, plagioclase and quartz phenocrysts. Textures range from porphyritic to vitreophyritic. Andesites are more common in Pliocene rocks, and Pleistocene rocks tend to be dacitic. At least five cycles of andesite rock formation have been found on the southwest side of Koh-i-Sultan. Its rocks are typical volcanic-arc rocks in elemental chemistry, and may stem from mantle-derived magma. The satellite centre rocks differ from the main centre rocks in composition, suggesting that different processes generated the magmas which constructed the cones. There is a compositional trend from Bazman over Taftan to Sultan, with the latter having more potassium in its rocks than the other centres. Such compositional trends may come from different partial melting ratios and different fluid contributions to magma generation at each volcano. Potassium-argon (K-Ar) dating of the Miri summit has yielded an age of 200,000 years, and an older date (5,900,000 ¬± 2,800,000) has been obtained from the northwestern centre. Between the two are andesite dates of 5,630,000 ¬± 90,000 years and 2,390,000 ¬± 50,000 years. Although the last activity occurred during the Pleistocene (probably a large eruption), volcanism began earlier. The youngest date, obtained from K-Ar dating of pumice, is 90,000 ¬± 10,000 years. Koh-i-Sultan's Pleistocene activity is probably related to the formation of travertine deposits, which are mined. Although the volcano has experienced relatively little dissection, the western cone has been eroded to the base. Post-volcanic erosion has created an apron of rock fragments at Koh-i-Sultan's base, with radially incised valleys bearing traces of energetic stream erosion emanating from the volcanic cones. Koh-i-Sultan's remaining rock formations often have irregular shapes with a striking appearance; a 1909 report noted the presence of a monolith-shaped rock and a dome-shaped rock formation, Koh-i-Kansuri. Neza e Sultan (\\"Sultan's Spear\\") is a major spear-shaped rock formation, about high with a basal diameter of . Weathering has created longitudinal fissures in the rock. Similar pillars are found elsewhere on the volcano, reminding early explorers of Gothic architecture and minarets. Neza e Sultan (possibly named after the mythical Sultan-i-Pir-Khaisar, who is reportedly buried nearby), at the westernmost crater, was discovered by Europeans in 1877. The rock formations may be necks of old volcanic centres. Gravel, pebbles and sand form playas and dunes, also found in dry valleys. Previous volcanic activity in the area includes the Cretaceous Sinjrani volcanics, resembling those of Koh-i-Sultan, and activity which produced the Chagai monzonites. The Sinjrani volcanics, about thick, consist primarily of lava. Other rocks are agglomerates, limestone and tuff, and the Cretaceous rocks are mainly andesitic. The monzonitic Chagai intrusions are accompanied by other intrusions with additional minerals. Other formations are the mostly sedimentary Humai formation of the late Cretaceous and the probably Paleocene Jazzak formation. The Chagai topography is dominated by a sand-covered plain, rising to an altitude of . Wind-eroded rocks and dry lake beds are also present. Other tectonic objects are the Ras Koh range, the Mirjawa range and the Chagai Hills east of Koh-i-Sultan. The Sinjrani and Chagai volcanics crop out primarily west of Koh-i-Sultan, and are part of the older Chagai volcanic arc. Some geologists consider Koh-i-Sultan part of the Chagai arc. Two nearby volcanic centres are Damodin and Koh-i-Dalel, and Koh i-Kannesin is northeast of Koh-i-Sultan. The crust beneath the volcano reaches a thickness of about .  Environment  There is little precipitation in Chagai, about . Koh-i- Sultan drains into two salt pans, and is responsible for a rain shadow effect on the Sistan Basin farther north. The environment around the volcano is arid, with little vegetation; according to an 1895‚Äì1896 report, however, asafoetida was collected nearby. There is a large difference in temperature between summer and winter.  Geothermal field  Hot springs exist around Koh-i- Sultan, with the Talu spring the best known. Other springs (Batal Kaur, Miri Kaur and Padagi Kaur) are in riverbeds near the Miri crater. Temperatures of have been measured in water samples, but the three springs have temperatures lower than the ambient temperature: . The hydrothermal activity suggests a magma chamber beneath the volcano. Water is probably stored in fractures within the Sinjrani volcanics, and is heated by a reservoir with a temperature of or . At least one spring is associated with a fault. Isotope data and composition indicate that the hot-spring water is precipitation-related; its composition is modified by interaction with hot rocks, with the water following a path beginning northeast of Miri crater. Country-rock salts, probably dissolved by sulfuric acid, are found in the waters. The springs' sulfur is of magmatic origin. Hydrothermal activity has modified the rocks around Koh-i-Sultan, with Miri Kaur featuring silicified rocks and the area southwest of Miri featuring acidic alteration. Some springs in the area have a very low pH. The region is the least developed in Pakistan, and Koh-i-Sultan may be a usable source of geothermal energy; however, the lack of rainfall may make it hydrologically unsuitable for energy generation. Emanations of hydrogen sulfide have been reported around the volcano, preventing the mining of underground sulfur deposits, and the gas is also present in the hot springs. The confirmed presence of sulfur dioxide would indicate hot magma beneath the volcano.  Mining and mineral deposits  Sulfur, a common mineral associated with volcanic activity, is the most important mineral found at Koh-i-Sultan A number of minerals are found at Koh-i-Sultan; sulfur is the most important. Reserves were estimated in 1976 at of sulfur ore, of which were high-grade and low-grade ore. Sulfur is found on Sultan's southern flank, where it originated from solfatara activity. According to a 1975 report, about of 50-percent-sulfur ore were mined; the report indicated that between 1941 and 1944, of ore were produced. The recovery of sulfur, asafoetida and dyes at Koh-i-Sultan was claimed in a 1909 report. The sulfur deposits, south of Koh- i-Sultan's crater, are named Batar, Miri, Nawar and Zond and are within a area. In the deposits, the sulfur is in the form of lenses within the volcanic rock. The Koh-i-Sultan deposits are the principal native source of sulfur in Pakistan. They were probably formed by the interaction of sulfuric acid and hydrogen sulfide or from sulfur-containing hot springs when the volcano was still active. Another theory suggests that they formed during the Holocene. Other mineral deposits found at Koh-i-Sultan are copper-containing alterations with alunite and quartz; alunogen, which can be used to obtain aluminium; limonite, used as a yellow dye, and a red ochre rock containing gypsum and anthophyllite. Copper deposits which also contain gold are part of an epithermal-sulfidic mineralization.

The city of Mogadishu came under Italian control in the 1880s after the Kingdom of Italy acquired the territory of Italian Somaliland. The early Benadir Company was a successor to Filonardi compagnia, both of whom were private companies whom nonetheless acted under the orders of the Italian government.Cassanelli, Lee V. \\"The Ending of Slavery in Italian Somalia: Liberty and the Control of Labor, 1890-1935.\\" The End of Slavery in Africa (1988): 308-331.

After World War I, the surrounding territory came under Italian control with some resistance.p. 28 Thousands of Italians settled in Mogadishu and founded small manufacturing companies. They also developed some agricultural areas in the south near the capital, such as Janale and the Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi (present-day Jowhar).p. 233 In the 1930s, new buildings and avenues were built.

It is Sadwith's directorial debut. Plot In 1969, Jamie Schwartz has written a play adaptation of J.D. Salinger's 1951 novel The Catcher in the Rye and wants to produce it at his prep school in Pennsylvania. In order to do that, Jamie needs permission from Salinger himself. Therefore, Jamie, with the help of DeeDee, travels to New Hampshire in order to find Salinger and obtain his permission. Cast *Alex Wolff as Jamie Schwartz *Stefania LaVie Owen as DeeDee *Chris Cooper as J. D. Salinger *Jacob Leinbach as Hank Marcus *Eric Nelsen as Ted Tyler *Kabby Borders as Maureen *Zephyr Benson as Gerry Schwartz *Adrian Pasdar as Mr. Tierney Production Sadwith says that the film is a mostly-accurate reflection of what he experienced in his real life. He explains, \\"The movie is about eighty-five percent accurate with what happened up to the moment when I went to search for J.D. Salinger, and from that point it‚Äôs about ninety-nine percent accurate.\\" On November 5, 2014, it was announced that Cooper would portray Salinger in this film.

Jhoanna Robledo of Common Sense Media gave the film three stars out of five. Tricia Olszewski of TheWrap referred to the film as \\"a sweet and inviting road trip, taking place in the colorful fall and accompanied by an indie soundtrack that lulls. It‚Äôs also a trip back in time, offering the now-archaic sound of a typewriter‚Äôs taps and the quaintness of a period in which a man and woman had to be married to secure a motel room. The fledgling relationship between Jamie and Deedee is touching, too, with both actors giving natural if not outstanding performances.\\" Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter wrote \\"Sadwith works expertly with all of the castmembers, and he also brings visual flair to the pastoral scenes in New Hampshire.

The film features an ensemble cast of horror icons including Kane Hodder, Barbara Crampton, Bill Moseley, Dee Wallace, Tony Todd and Camille Keaton. Originally written by Hansen, the film started as a concept intended to bring as many well known horror actors together as possible. This is Hansen's final film performance, as it was released two years after his death. Plot FBI agent Toria Boon arrives at Death House, a federal prison and research center where prisoners are confined to virtual environments whose crime simulations allow their behavior to be studied. Upon arrival, Boon is taunted by neo-Nazi criminal Alois Sieg, who she went undercover to capture, but killed a mother and her son to keep her cover. Captain Victor Galan greets Boon before introducing her to Dr. Eileen Fletcher and fellow agent Jae Novak. Galan escorts Boon to a holographic cell where she confronts and executes the serial killer who murdered her mother, after watching a live re-enactment of her mother's death. Fletcher introduces Novak and Boon to her colleague, Dr. Karen Redmane, who explains that Death House uses drugs, machines, and simulations to keep inmates such as \\"Leatherlace\\" and \\"the Icicle Killer\\" docile. Boon and Novak then take a virtual tour of Death House, where they learn that the facility consists of nine levels. The lowest level houses the facility's most dangerous prisoners, The Five Evils, who are supposedly immortal. While showering together, Boon and Novak realize they don't remember details of their lives outside of their work. They later learn that homeless people are used as sacrifices in Death House's murder studies. Outside, a mysterious boy attacks a perimeter guard and plants an electronic device inside the dying guard's stomach. A doctor discovers the electronic device while performing surgery on the injured guard. Removing the device triggers a power failure throughout the facility, trapping Boon and Novak in an elevator with Dr. Fletcher. Sieg and other Death House inmates break loose and begin slaughtering guards. Despite being shot and gutted, Sieg survives and rallies the inmates together to go down to the ninth level and gain freedom through the Five Evils; the inmates kill Dr. Redmane on their way. Boon, Novak, and Dr. Fletcher escape the elevator and fight their way through rioting prisoners, hiding from Sieg by clinging to bodies hanging in a staging room of homeless victims, but Fletcher loses her grip and falls to her death. Reasoning that the Five Evils offer the best chance of escape, Boon and Novak descend down an elevator shaft to the facility's lowest level. When confronted, prisoner Hirace Giger explains that there are multiple Death Houses being used to breed a new race that is neither good nor evil with technology as their new god. Boon and Novak realize that their memories are false, and they were former prisoners and subjects of Death House's experiments. Giger tells the agents that the Evils need to be released so the agents can pursue them in order to maintain the balance of good and evil in the world. Sieg interrupts their meeting and reveals that he has followed the Five Evils to become immortal like them, but Giger replies that Sieg is only a pawn in the Five Evils' escape plan. Gas releases throughout Death House, causing inmates to collapse and Sieg to disintegrate. Boon and Novak escape as the facility comes back online. Outside, the two decide to go find out their true identities.

While the memorials and structures above ground have been removed, the graves themselves are intact. Closure and location of memorials On 31 August 1898, Liverpool's Necropolis Cemetery (Low Hill/Everton), was closed, due to an edict of the City Council, citing the unsanitary conditions spreading to surrounding neighbourhoods, plus the fact that the Cemetery was nearing its full capacity of 80,000 burials. The old headstones were 'dropped' over the graves, and subsequently landscaped in the early 1910s, to make Grant Gardens a public park, which was opened by City Alderman J.R.Grant in 1914. Headstones from 'active' private plots at the Necropolis were removed to Everton Cemetery.

He is currently based in Italy and France. Bartus creates using a wide range of mediums, including painting, drawing, caricature, photography, design and even poetry. In 1969 he wrote \\"Kitsch Art\\", a manifesto promoting street artistic experimentalism. Life and education Upon completing his secondary education at Colegio de la Salle in the city of San Crist√≥bal in Venezuela, where he held his first exhibition of paintings when he was 17 years old, Bartus traveled to Europe and lived in Paris from 1968 until 1974, participating in the student movement that generated the famous Mai 68, and attended some of the most advanced institutes of the time, including the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, the √âcole des Beaux Arts and the University of Vincennes, Paris VIII. His family owned the Sanchez Pernia Estate, one of the largest coffee plantations in the country covering more than 90,000 hectares from 1898 up to the 1960s. However, the newly emerging governments from the 1960s, riding the wave of a new oil boom, began to expropriate the land and reduced the agricultural production of coffee and other crops to a minimum. In the expropriated lands, the government promoted and built the Uribante Caparo Hydroelectric Dam, a project that became detrimental to the eco-systems of three Venezuelan states: T√°chira, M√©rida and Barinas, decreasing the productivity of the traditionally cultivated areas, affecting the rivers, local plants and bird migrations because among other things, this area was a pathway or transit corridor used by birds who migrated from Canada to Argentina and vice verse. These expropriations and the negative effect they had on the environment he grew up in, affected the sensitivity of Bartus. He increasingly devoted his creativity to establishing links between art and water, and he promoted some cultural events that highlight the consequences of human intervention on the environment such as environmental pollution and global warming. Bartus considers the natural environment a legacy that must be protected, and water is the link that keeps all natural environments healthy one way or another. In the early 1970s, away from these trends, he published a new manifesto in San Francisco proclaiming a Transpositionism; a search on new proposals as symbolic calligraphy, haiku and visual art from which he proposed the new denomination Graphi-k√∫ a combination between Haiku and Graphic. In the mid-'70s he returned home and obtained a degree in International Studies (Diplomacy) from the Central University in Caracas. In the late '70s and early '80s he was involved in various activities carried out in Italy and Europe with the group Zeta International promoters of the New Visuality or Poesia Visiva with Carlo Marcello Conti, Lamberto Pignotti, Adriano Spatola, Gerard Jaschke, Eugenio Miccini, Luciana Arbizzani, T. Blittersdorf, Graziella Borghesi, Erio sughi among many others. In the mid-'80s, linked to a diplomatic post, he lived in India and China, where he participated in various cultural events. In New Delhi, the best gallery for artists of his time, Dhoomi Mal Gallery offered the opportunity to exhibit his works and shared art experiences with the exponents of the fine art new symbolism, and neo-tantric in the context of that country, including names that are now referred mandatory in contemporary art from India, such as Swaminathan, Gujurat Satish, Santosh, Francis Souza, and others. In this period he had a great reception by the critics and the international press in India and started his experiments in the painting-object by doubling sequined and including textiles to his art research. Later he studied calligraphy in Beijing, China, and art Bantu, in Libreville, Gabon, Central Africa. At the beginning of the 1990s he returned to Caracas and tried to develop some graphics proposals subscribing to the project to edit Nadja, a magazine with writers JJ Villa Pelayo, Gustavo √Åvila, Milagros Bello, A. Barrios and G. Perez Rescaniere. The group disbanded prematurely due to divergent political conceptions. Bartus returned to Europe in the mid-1990s and began his project on Global Rights of drinkable water, looking to motivate the international community in the creation of large water caves to fill in periods of drought at 65 countries experiencing shortages of fresh water seasonally and with more intensity in recent years by the failure of most governments International Agreements both in the area of Sustainable Development as the environment from Kyoto Treaty.

She was a North Sea and Baltic trader until the British Royal Navy purchased her in 1798. Selbys purchase was one of a number of purchases of armed ships or ship- sloops where the Navy's intent was to use them as convoy escorts. Selby was at the raid on Dunkirk, though she played no real role. The Navy sold her in 1801. She then returned to being a merchantman. She is last listed in 1810, trading between London and Jamaica. Merchantman Selby first appears in published British registries in the 1793 volume of Lloyd's Register. Her master is Woodhouse, and her owner is Woodcock. Her trade is Liverpool to Ostend.Lloyd's Register (1793), Seq.‚ÑñS515. Selby still appears in the 1799 volume of Lloyd's Register, which presumably went to press before her sale to the Navy. Her master is Thompson, and she is sailing between Riga and Portsmouth.Lloyd's Register (1799), Seq.‚ÑñS137. Naval career The Navy purchased Selby in 1798. Between 5 April and 3 May she was at Perry & Co., Blackwall, undergoing fitting-out. Commander Thomas Palmer commissioned Selby in May 1798 at Sheerness. Then on 16 July she moved to Woolwich Dockyard for further work. Selby was at the Nore when at 7:30 in the morning of 3 May 1800 Palmer shot himself. A brief obituary in the Naval Chronicle reported, \\"the unfortunate death ... of Captain Palmer, of the Selby sloop of war, who shot himself in a fit of insanity; which circumstance, however deplorable, will tend, in the eyes of his friends, to lessen the calamity.\\"Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p.420. At some point Commander William Compton took command of Selby and he was her captain between 27 June and 8 July 1800, when Selby participated in the raid on Dunkirk. This was an operation to capture the French frigate D√©sir√©e from Dunkerque harbour and burn other vessels. Contrary winds and a succession of unfavourable tides afforded no opportunity of making the attack until 7 July. Captain Inman, of , was in charge of the operation. He sent , under Patrick Campbell, against the easternmost vessel, and loosed his four fireships, , , , and against the westernmost vessels. Dart captured D√©sir√©e on 8 July. Even though their captains remained on the fireships until the four were engulfed in flames, the three frigates that were their targets cut their cables and escaped down the Inner Channel within the Braak Sand. There one briefly ran aground but her crew got her off again. Inman had kept Selby back, intending that if any French vessels ran aground she could come up and throw carcasses aboard them He stated that his plan had been an error in that if Selby had been forward he was sure that she could have captured that vessel. D√©sir√©e was subsequently purchased into the Service. The officers and crews of many British vessels, Rosario among them, shared in the proceeds of the capture. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Capture of the Desiree\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. On 19 Mar 1801 Selby recaptured Freedom, James Holden, master, that a French privateer had previously taken. The \\"Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy\\" offered Selby, of 348 tons and copper- fastened, for sale at Sheerness on 16 December 1801. She sold on that day for ¬£1850.

First published three- quarters of a century after her death, it offers a firsthand view of life for girls and women in the Pacific Northwest during the second half of the 19th century. Biography Martha Ann \\"Mattie\\" Gay was born in 1837, the sixth of 12 children of Johan \\"Ann\\" Stewart (Evans) Gay and Martin Baker Gay, a farmer. Her father moved the family around several southern states before, in 1851, deciding to emigrate from Springfield, Missouri, to Oregon along the Oregon Trail. The crossing took five months, and the family eventually settled in Lane County, Oregon. During the trip, Martha kept a diary of the family's trials and adventures, and she continued keeping this diary afterwards, right up until her death. In 1871, she married widower James Alfred Masterson. They had three children together, two of whom died young. The couple moved around a good deal and separated after twenty years, and Martha spent her later years with her only surviving child, her daughter Frances. Masterson died in Eugene, Oregon, at the end of 1916. Publications and legacy In 1990, historian Lois Barton published Masterson's diary-cum-reminiscences with explanatory notes under the title One Woman's West: Recollections of the Oregon Trail and Settling of the Northwest Country. This passage gives a sense of her style and subject matter: :If there were any graves near camp we would visit them and read the inscriptions. Sometimes we would see where wolves had dug into the graves after the dead bodies, and we saw long braids of golden hair telling of some young girl's burying place. In 1995, writer Rebecca Stetoff based a nonfiction book for young readers, Children of the Westward Trail, on Masterson's diary. Illustrated with period photographs and drawings, it has been used as reading for Oregon schoolchildren in courses about the settlement of the American West and Oregon history. In 2014, poet Jana Harris published You Haven't Asked About My Wedding or What I Wore, a book of poems based on writings by American pioneer women. One of her poems, \\"The Stove\\", was based on Masterson's diary and includes these lines: :If we found graves, we'd read their inscriptions. :If wolves had broken in :we'd look for the ropey yellow braids :of young girls like ourselves.

Life Waller was brought up in South London, attended Dulwich College, and spent a year in bed with rheumatic fever, during which time he read voraciously and formed a lifelong love of Shakespeare. He took a course in journalism at University College, London, where he also studied philosophy under Professor John Macmurray, whose ideas were another lifelong influence. Waller was on the fringes of the Euston Road School of artists; he became a prot√©g√© of T.S. Eliot, and worked as literary secretary to Sir Desmond MacCarthy. During World War II he served in the Royal Signals and was present at the D-Day landings. Two of his close friends, the artist Graham Bell and the writer John Mair, were killed during the war. After demobilisation he was fortunate to land a post with the BBC's newly established Third Programme, as a producer of talks on philosophy and poetry. Having tired of London, he transferred in 1949 to BBC's Western Region in Bristol; he and his family lived for a time in the house of the novelist L.P. Hartley. For eight years he produced a variety of programmes including poetry, cricket commentary and agriculture. Through this last topic he came to know the agronomist Sir George Stapledon and to develop an ecological outlook. From 1957 to 1962 he worked as a freelance producer and researched his biography of Stapledon, Prophet of the New Age (1962). As a result of his contacts with the environmental movement, he became Editorial Secretary to the Soil Association, where he worked closely with Michael Allaby and persuaded the economist E.F. Schumacher (a Soil Association member since the early 1950s) to play a more prominent role. Waller resigned in 1972 and was for many years an Associate Editor of The Ecologist. During the 1970s he lived in rural Norfolk, moving to Bath in the early 1980s. In his later years he undertook editorial work for the Commonwealth Human Ecology Council (CHEC), and returned to write a column for the Soil Association journal Living Earth. Waller moved to Richmond in the mid-1990s, then, following the death in 2000 of his third wife Sue Dowdall, moved into an Exeter nursing home. Writing and literary activities Robert Waller was a prolific writer throughout his life, contributing to the UCL student journal in the 1930s, and to Hugh Ross Williamson‚Äôs The Bookman. An inheritance enabled him to subsidise himself to write poetry, and in 1939 the Hogarth Press chose him as one of their Poets of Tomorrow. Erica Marx‚Äôs Hand and Flower Press published his long poem The Two Natures in 1951. During this period, influenced by Stapledon, he began to write on agriculture and ecology. His dissatisfaction with the BBC took satirical form in his 1956 novel Shadow of Authority. On Stapledon‚Äôs death in 1960 Waller became his literary executor, writing the biography Prophet of the New Age (1962) and then editing, and providing a long introduction to, Stapledon‚Äôs unpublished notes on environmentalism, Human Ecology. Waller‚Äôs attempt at summing up his own philosophy, Be Human or Die (1973), though not without interest, is over-ambitious and perhaps reflects the confusion of his domestic life at the time he was drafting it. In 1992 he published an autobiographical collection The Pilgrimage of Eros, which covered his pre-war life. Regrettably, he never completed an account of his years with the BBC or the Soil Association. Waller also wrote for The Ecologist and Resurgence; his poetry appeared in The Criterion, Outposts, and New Writing, among other places; and he reviewed for Time and Tide and Books and Bookmen. Environmentalism Waller worked as a Western Region producer of agricultural programmes, with figures such as A.G. Street, Ralph Wightman and Henry Williamson, coming to appreciate the importance of farming for a nation‚Äôs social structure and economy. The grassland authority and plant breeder R.G. (Sir George) Stapledon influenced him in the 1950s as powerfully as John Macmurray had in the 1930s, with his concept of ‚Äúhuman ecology‚Äù: the study of humans in their total environment, including the natural world, society and the inner world of emotion and culture. Waller‚Äôs work on Stapledon‚Äôs biography brought him into contact with the organic husbandry movement, and during his time as editorial secretary of the Soil Association he sought to broaden the organisation‚Äôs appeal to the younger generation of environmental activists concerned by the revelations of Rachel Carson‚Äôs Silent Spring (1962). In the end, the ethos of the Association remained rather too squirearchical for him and he, along with Michael Allaby, found the radical atmosphere of The Ecologist more to his taste.  Publications   Poetry  Contribution to Poets of Tomorrow, Hogarth Press, 1939 The Two Natures, Hand and Flower Press, 1951 Shadow of Authority, Jonathan Cape, 1956. Part romance, part autobiography, predominantly satire, this novel deals with questions of bureaucratic control of the arts, cultural standards, the role - if any - of poetry in the ‚Äúsocial state‚Äù, and the significance of regions in a national organisation. It explores the differences between those who try to preserve their personal integrity, and those content to abandon it for career advancement and security.

Edited by Philip Conford, with the help of Robert Waller's daughter Anne Baillie and her husband Richard, this contains extracts from a wide range of Waller's writings, both prose and poetry, as well as tributes from many of Waller's friends and colleagues. Personal life Waller married three times. In 1939 he married Janet Truman, by whom he had two children: Anne (b.1944) and William (b.1946). William was killed in a road accident in 1963 and Janet died aged 51 in 1970. A second marriage, to Helen Stenhouse-Simpson, was not a success. In 1979 he married Susan Shelley, n√©e Dowdall, former wife of his friend the actor Frank Shelley and herself a successful actress; two decades of happiness followed, ended by her death in 2000. Waller underwent a vivid out-of-body experience during an operation when a young man, which made him lastingly sceptical of materialist philosophies. Describing himself as an ‚Äúundogmatic Christian‚Äù, he developed in many essays and long letters a philosophical outlook that steered between arid rationalism (whether theological or atheistic) and self-indulgent emotionalism or mysticism. Politically, this outlook implied a mistrust of both top-down socialism and the imposition of Thatcherism's free-market economics, against which he frequently inveighed. Waller supported the Green Party for much of the 1980s and 1990s. Robert Waller was a prolific and generous letter-writer, and a close friend of the poet, critic and pacifist Derek Savage, with whom he maintained a correspondence for many years. Archival material Robert Waller's papers are in the process of being lodged with the Special Collections at the University of Reading. Much of the material is already there; more will follow.

The recipe is a generations old traditional preparation made from sun-dried red chillies or fresh green chillies. Blended with citrus extract from a local fruit, the Chamba Chukh preparation is a cooked chilli sauce and Chili pepper paste. Made by women in their kitchens in different parts of the Chamba district, the preparation has been highly regarded in the local region and in adjoining areas. Chamba Chukh is now gradually making its way into a broader market.  Preparation & use  This hot chilli recipe is made from locally grown chillies in the Chamba area, mixed with extract from a local citrus fruit and cooked with Indian spices. It is usually prepared in mustard oil which is commonly used in Indian cooking. The red chilli version of the preparation is usually made from sun-dried chilli peppers and has a smokey flavour. Chukh is usually had as a condiment to go with meals or snacks but also used in cooking. It is consumed as a hot sauce, pickle, and as a food additive.  Recent developments  The District Rural Development Agency (DRDA) in Chamba with the Government of Himachal Pradesh have designated officers to help women groups in the village communities to standardise production and help them produce this chilli sauce per approved recipes. Some of the prominent brands of Chamba Chukh now available include Himachilli Chukh and Sago & Vales, among others. Some variants such as Ginger Chukh and Garlic Chukh are common among most brands, though some of the makers have also recently started to produce their own specific formulations such as Honey Chukh, Dry Fruit Chukh, etc. http://www.chambachukh.com/Chamba_Chukh/index/index.html  References  Condiments Pickles ","title":"Chamba Chukh"},{"id":"51192648","text":"Laurence Joseph \\"Laurie\\" Maher is the former mayor of Gosford City Council and the former CEO of Coast Shelter, a non-profit homelessness service assisting people in the Central Coast region of New South Wales, Australia.

It was in operation from the 12th-century until the Danish Reformation. It was a large landowner and functioned as a girl school for daughters of the nobility. Altarpiece from Ring Abbey now in √òstbirk Church History Ring Abbey was likely founded in the 12th-century, possibly in the early 12th-century. It is mentioned in contemporary documents for the first time in 1203. The Abbey functioned mainly as a school for girls and a retirement home for elder women from the nobility. Initially small, it became a substantial landowner through donations by the families of the noblewomen accepted as nuns in the Abbey. Eventually Ring Abbey owned estates located all over Jylland, mostly rented out to tenants of the peasantry, and had its own market place. The Abbey burnt down two times; in 1300 and in 1430, and was each time enlarged and rebuilt in stone. During the Danish Reformation, Ring Abbey was confiscated by the crown and given to Lord High Treasurer Mogens G√∏ye and then to his son-in-law Admiral Herluf Trolle, who were forced to promise to support the remaining nuns, who were allowed to live in the building for life. In 1571, Ring Abbey were incorporated into Skanderborg parish, and in 1579 lost its market place. The church at Ring Abbey was demolished and the materials used for the expansion and repair of Skanderup Church (Skanderup Kirke) in the Diocese of Haderslev. The altarpiece from 1487 is now in √òstbirk Church (√òstbirk Kirke) in the Diocese of Aarhus. References Other sources * Danmarks Kirker, hefte 48.

It is responsible for roughly 510,000 residents; or 12% of New Zealand's population. The Canterbury District Health Board covers a territory of 26,881 square kilometers and is divided between six territorial local authorities. History The Canterbury District Health Board, like most other district health boards, came into effect on 1 January 2001. In July 2005, The New Zealand Herald reported that the Canterbury District Health Board and Telecom NZ had signed a three-year telecommunications deal. The deal gave Telecom NZ the responsibility for providing all health board telecommunications. There was also a two-year right of renewal clause. Geographic area The area covered by the Canterbury District Health Board is defined in Schedule 1 of the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000 and based on territorial authority and ward boundaries as constituted as at 1 January 2001. The area can be adjusted through an Order in Council. Governance The CDHB, like other district health boards, is governed by a group that is partially elected and partially appointed. Since the 2001 New Zealand local elections, the elected part of the board has been determined as part of the triennial local elections using the single transferable vote system. There are currently eleven board members, seven of whom are elected. The following were elected in the 2019 local elections: *Sally Buck (resigned July 2020; died 9 September 2020) *James Gough *Jo Kane *Naomi Marshall *Aaron Keown *Catherine Chu *Andrew Dickerson The four members appointed by the Minister of Health are: *Sir John Hansen (Chair) *Gabrielle Huria (Deputy Chair) *Barry Bragg *Ingrid Taylor Chairperson At most district health boards, the previous Hospital and Health Service (HHS) board chair was appointed as the inaugural chair, but not so at the Canterbury District Health Board. The acting chairperson of the HHS board, Humphry Rolleston, retired and Syd Bradley was appointed as the inaugural CDHB chairperson by Health Minister Annette King for a 1 January 2001 start. Bradley was succeeded in November 2007 by Alister James, who was appointed chairperson by Health Minister David Cunliffe. After serving as a Christchurch City Councillor until 2004, James successfully stood for the CDHB in October 2004 instead. In the 2007 local elections, he was defeated but Cunliffe made him the government-appointed chair. Health Minister Tony Ryall appointed Bruce Matheson in November 2010 to replace James. Murray Cleverley was appointed chairperson in 2013 by Health Minister Tony Ryall, held concurrently with the chairpersonship for the South Canterbury District Health Board (where he had been chair since January 2010). In February 2017, Cleverley resigned from the district health board positions over alleged fraudulent activity carried out by staff reporting to him at the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA). Sir Mark Solomon, who had been appointed by Health Minister Jonathan Coleman in November 2016 as deputy chair, took over as acting chair from Cleverly. In August 2017, former diplomat and current university chancellor John Wood was appointed by Coleman as the new chair, with Solomon returning to the role of deputy chair. In December 2019, retired judge Sir John Hansen was appointed by Health Minister David Clark to succeed Wood. Demographics Canterbury DHB served a population of 539,631 at the time of the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 56,853 people (11.8%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 72,615 people (15.5%) since the 2006 census. There were 200,694 households. There were 269,550 males and 270,081 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.0 males per female. Of the total population, 98,541 people (18.3%) were aged up to 15 years, 111,957 (20.7%) were 15 to 29, 246,159 (45.6%) were 30 to 64, and 82,968 (15.4%) were 65 or older. Figures may not add up to the total due to rounding. Ethnicities were 81.6% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 9.5% MƒÅori, 3.3% Pacific peoples, 11.8% Asian, and 2.7% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity. The percentage of people born overseas was 24.1, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 51.3% had no religion, 36.7% were Christian, and 5.6% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 98,127 (22.2%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 75,732 (17.2%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $34,200. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 226,362 (51.3%) people were employed full-time, 68,367 (15.5%) were part-time, and 14,703 (3.3%) were unemployed. Performance It has been regarded as a successful accountable care system which has moderated the rate of growth in hospital use by investing in services in the community. GPs and consultants agreed health pathways for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with common medical conditions thereby breaking down barriers between clinicians. Controversy In 2001, after multiple union contracts fell through, more than 1100 staff members of the Princess Margaret Hospital went on strike to protest the uncertainty regarding their jobs at the hospital. However, the scope of the full strike was roughly 3000 people from hospitals throughout the region. In September 2005, the health board was accused of \\"virtually sweat shop conditions\\" by the National Union of Public Employees. The board denied all accusations against them. Following the accusations, roughly 500 personnel from the district started a five day strike for a 30% pay rise. In December 2016, approximately 3974 appointments were postponed due to a payment dispute with the Regional District Health Boards, including Canterbury, and members of the Association of Salaried Medical Specialists. It was estimated that the resident medical officers had forfeited roughly $1.1 million in lost wages.

It provided a range of social services to the poor of its deprived area, and provided accommodation enabling relatively well-educated people to live amongst the people with whom they worked. Origins The settlement movement was a reformist social movement, beginning in the 1880s and peaking around the 1920s, with a goal of getting the rich and poor in society to live more closely together in an interdependent community. Its main object was the establishment of \\"settlement houses\\" in poor urban areas, in which volunteer middle-class \\"settlement workers\\" would live, hoping to share knowledge and culture with, and alleviate the poverty of, their low-income neighbors. The university extension movement was similarly disposed, to bring high quality education to the urban poor by means of the establishment of university settlement houses. An early and prominent example was offered by the formation of Toynbee Hall by Samuel and Henrietta Barnett The Browning Hall settlement was formed by Francis Herbert Stead, a congregationalist minister who served at the York Street Chapel in Walworth. The chapel was in 1890 renamed \\"Browning Hall\\", honouring Robert Browning, who had been baptised there in 1812. The settlement was established along the lines of Toynbee Hall. Initially closely associated with the chapel, the settlement was inaugurated in November, 1895 with an address given by H. H. Asquith. In 1902 it established itself in separate premises at 62 Camberwell Road. Operation The settlement provided accommodation for a number of university-educated volunteers, but also a relatively large proportion of self-taught volunteers, including James Keir Hardie. Browning Hall offered a wide range of services over time, including adult education (including acting as the Walworth centre for the London University Extension Society), social-work training, a savings club, legal aid, organised country holidays, summer camps, and a range of clubs and societies. By design, the settlement had an interest in Labour politics. Its entry in the Directory of Settlements stated: \\"We stand for the Labour Movement in religion. We stand for the endeavour to obtain for Labour not merely more of the good things of life, but most of the best things in life. Come and join us in the service of Him who is the Lord of Labour and the soul of all social reform\\". It became a hub for trade union activity, most notably giving rise to the 1899‚Äì1908 National Committee of Organised Labour, which successfully campaigned for the introduction of general tax funded old- age pensions; and later becoming involved in a further successful campaign for the provision of old-people's homes.

The boat, caught by swift current and hampered by heavy fog, smashed sideways into one of the piers of the railroad bridge between Benwood, WV and Bellaire, Ohio. The boat sank rapidly. Captain Lyons, the pilot and second engineer were trapped inside the pilot house. However, 14 members of the crew made it to shore. Nearly a week later, his body was recovered. Lyons, his wife Katherine, and their daughter Beatrice are all buried in Woodlawn Cemetery, Fairmont. Legacy At least two buildings designed by Lyons have been placed on the National Register of Historic Places, and several more contribute or did contribute to listed historic districts. In 2013, local historian Dr. M. Raymond Alvarez called Lyons \\"the primary architect, literally, of Fairmont‚Äôs transition from a sleepy county seat to a bustling commercial center\\".

He has been implicated in several of Brazil's largest scandals during the past generation. He was a figure in the Banestado scandal, and later was a major target of Operation Car Wash, the official investigation of corruption surrounding Petrobras, the government-controlled oil company. Bloomberg described Youssef in January 2015 as ‚ÄúBrazil‚Äôs black- market central banker, a career criminal who smuggled cash for the rich and powerful‚Äù. In August 2015, The New York Times called him ‚Äúa convicted money launderer and former bon vivant.‚Äù Youssef was arrested in March 2014 for violating the terms of a plea-bargaining agreement. He is currently incarcerated. Early life and activities Youssef is the son of Kalim Youssef, a Lebanese immigrant, and Antoinette Youssef, a Brazilian. He grew up in very modest circumstances in Londrina, a town in the state of Paran√°. When he was a boy, he sold snacks in the streets of Londrina. During his teenage years, after earning a pilot's license, he began smuggling costly electronic items and other merchandise into Brazil from Paraguay, where taxes were far lower, and selling them on. His older sister worked with him on this smuggling operation, which first put Youssef on the government's radar, in the 1980s. Also during his teens, he helped his mother sell food at a shop at the local airport. It was at the airport that he met Jos√© Janene, a businessman and pilot who would later become a member of Congress and helped Youssef with his career. Career Early activities and scandals By the early 1990s, Youssef had left smuggling behind and gone into the business of money laundering. Soon he was considered one of the top doleiros, or black-market currency changers, in Brazil. According to Bloomberg, Youssef began driving an armored car to deliver cash amounts daily. Youssef was arrested both in 2000, and again in 2001, because of a corrupt operation that was based in Londrina and that involved the bribery of bank employees who in return cashed municipal checks, including unsigned checks. He was never put on trial, however, and spent less than a month behind bars. Youssef was also involved with a case of embezzlement in Maring√°, a town near Londrina around the same time as his other arrests. Indicted on charges of criminal conspiracy, he escaped punishment by fingering local government officials who had been involved in the scandal. Banestado scandal Youssef was then charged with money laundering in the Banestado scandal. Banestado was a state-run bank that had been used by many wealthy persons to launder money and thus avoid high Brazilian taxes. Youssef was in charge of the money laundering, and was said to have laundered more than $830 million. Once again, Youssef plea-bargained, turning in other doleiros, whose conviction and imprisonment only enhanced Youssef's standing in his profession. Further activities and scandals In yet another investigation, Youssef got off by telling prosecutors about the manipulation of tax credits at a government power utility. In 2006, Janene was indicted in a scandal involving members of congress who sold their votes. Prosecutors later determined that some of the money generated by this scheme was laundered by Youssef through a Brasilia gas station. After Janene's death in 2010, Youssef took control of Janene's network of corruption in both Brasilia and Petrobras. Petrobras scandal Youssef has been called a \\"principal player\\" in the largest scandal in Brazilian history. It involves money laundering and other corrupt activities at the government-owned oil company, Petrobras, executives of which accepted bribes in return for overpaying construction firms doing work for the firm. Youssef became part of the operation in late 2006 at the invitation of Janene; it was his job to collect the bribes from the contractors. The scandal has been under investigation since March 2014. The investigators' big break came with the discovery of an e-mail by Youssef in which he discussed a Range Rover bought for Paulo Roberto Costa, who had been Petrobras's supplies director from 2004 to 2012. As he had in many other scandals, Youssef agreed to turn state‚Äôs evidence. When he handed his lawyers a piece of paper on which he had written the names of the participants in the Petrobras operation, Reinaldet asked, ‚ÄúAre you serious?‚Äù Reinaldet later told the Times, \\"It was kind of like, in Brazil, we know that corruption is a monster. But we never really see the monster. This was like seeing the monster.\\" Youssef told prosecutors that President Dilma Rousseff, who had served as chairwoman of Petrobras from 2003 through 2010, was aware of the kickback scheme. One investigator said that Youssef's revelations made it clear ‚Äúwe had a case that was 100 times bigger‚Äù than they had originally imagined. Because of his agreement with prosecutors, Youssef, who would ordinally have received a prison sentence of over 8 years, will instead serve only three years for his involvement in Petrobras. Imprisonment Youssef was arrested in March 2014, and in September he was sentenced to four years and four months for having violated the terms of a plea bargain regarding the Banestado case. He is now in Curitiba . Personal life Youssef is married to Joan of Arc Fernandes da Silva Youssef, who separated from him after learning of his extramarital affairs. His mistresses have included Nelma Kodama, a convicted criminal who is now in prison, and Taiana Camargo, a fashion model. In Londrina, he was known as an extravagant spender on parties and women.

It was located in Askeby outside Link√∂ping, Sweden. Askeby Church History Askeby Abbey was founded as a daughter convent of the Vreta Abbey during the second half of the 12th century. It was placed under the authority of the Alvastra Abbey: no member of the abbey was allowed to go outside the walls without a permit from the Abbot of Alvastra, not even the abbess herself, though she could receive guests in the abbey. Erik Lundberg (1964) Vreta kloster ‚Äì Svenska fornminnesplatser nr 6 (Almqvist & Wiksell, Stockholm) Askeby Abbey did not belong to the largest of the Swedish nunneries, but it was wealthy and of some importance and often benefited by important people. Placed by the important road to S√∂derk√∂ping, it functioned as an inn for travelers. The abbey had the income from one third of the crown taxed fishing in Norrk√∂ping. The abbess of the abbey also had the right to appoint the priest of Sankt Olai kyrka at Norrk√∂ping in √ñsterg√∂tland which often caused conflicts with that city. In 1462, the Abbess Anna Jacobi and the nuns were given an official thanks from the Pope after their assistance to his envoy Martinus de Fregano, who had visited Sweden to gather funds for a crusade against the Ottoman Turks. In the late 15th century the discipline was lax; the abbess received guests in her personal chambers, and in 1490 the nuns were threatened with interdict for socializing with the outside world. After the Swedish Reformation of 1527, the valuables of the abbey were confiscated and taken to the royal treasury in accordance with the Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden, and the management of the abbey was given to the abbess of Vreta Abbey. In 1529, all remaining members of the abbey were relocated to Vreta Abbey and Askeby Abbey was thereby dissolved. The buildings burnt down eight years later. The remains of the abbey are gone. Askeby Church Askeby Church (Swedish: Askeby kyrka) was built together with a nunnery during the second half of the 12th century and was used until about 1530 by both the parish and the abbey. The sacristy was probably built in the late 15th or early 16th century. In 1609 the church burned down and the tower was almost completely destroyed. Only two floors of the original tower remain. The western part of the nave under went major rebuilding 1876-1877. The tower rooms regained their medieval character in 1913. In 1951, the interior was restored, the exterior in 1970. Today the church serves the parish of Askeby in the Diocese of Link√∂ping. During 1955, a memorial stone was erected on site to the memory of Askeby Abbey.

Yen Press has released six of the seven manga volumes that have so far been released in Japan. The seventh volume of the series was released on 30 October 2018. Reception The English-language adaptation of Spirits & Cat Ears has received average reviews which mostly were done on the first volume. Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network gave the first volume an overall rating of a C+ citing the theme of bondage as a possible issue for readers. Silverman points out that there are many similar themes to the manga series Inu x Boku SS, while also calling it a \\"sister\\" series or extension. While she praises the good interaction between the characters and the cute artwork, Silverman states that nothing sets the story apart from \\"the standard\\". Brandon Varnell from \\"The Fandom Post\\" also reviewed the first volume, and concurred with Silverman on the story not being very original. Varnell went on to say that he can already tell how the story will end, but has been surprised \\"on occasion\\". He gave the overall content, packaging, and translation a \\"B\\" grade and gave an \\"A\\" for the artwork. Varnell later did a review on the fifth volume calling the series overall \\"the funnest, underrated series of our time\\". Although Varnell highly praised the character development up to this point, his overall grading remained about the same. Sean Gaffney from Manga Bookshelf also pointed out the similarity to \\"Inu x Boku SS\\" saying that he can get the same good things in Spirits & Cat Ears from other better series. Gaffney didn't call the series \\"completely terrible\\", but recommends it for people who like nekomimis and/or a \\"teasing sort-of boyfriend\\" that is into dressing his girlfriend in \\"sexy\\" outfits.

The site, listed since 1992, is a set of four traditionally managed northern hay meadows, now rare in Northumberland. Location and natural features Aules Hill Meadows are situated in the north-east of England, and in the far south-west of the county of Northumberland, west of Slaggyford and north-north-west of Alston. They lie on the west valley of the River South Tyne at approximately above sea level. The site is listed as a rare in Northumberland example of a traditional hay meadow, characterised by the flora found at the site. Once common across the North Pennines, such meadows are now found only in some Yorkshire and Durham dales, and in a very few parts of Northumberland, their loss arising out of contemporary farming methods including the use of inorganic fertiliser and reliance on silage-making. Barrow Meadow and Barrow Burn Meadows in the north of the county are similarly protected hay meadows. Vegetation The meadows are characterised by sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum) and an abundance of herbs including several lady‚Äôs mantle species Alchemilla spp., wood cranesbill (Geranium sylvaticum), ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata), hay rattle (Rhinanthus minor), self-heal (Prunella vulgaris) and pignut (Conopodium majus). Other species found include crested dog‚Äôs tail (Cynosurus cristatus), downy oat grass (Avenula pubescens), Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus), field woodrush (Luzula campestris), pale sedge (Carex pallescens) and red clover (Trifolium pratense). Damp areas within the meadows provide habitat for ragged robin (Lychnis flos-cuculi), great burnet (Sanguisorba officinalis), northern marsh orchid (Dactylorhiza purpurella), devil‚Äôs bit scabious (Succisa pratensis), marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), marsh ragwort (Senecio jacobea) and carnation-grass (Carex panicea). On a steep incline at the eastern edge of the site is found hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) scrub and the common spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii), cat‚Äôs ear (Hypochoeris radicata), bitter vetch (Lathyrus montanus), water avens (Geum rivale) and bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta). The condition of Aules Hill Meadows was judged to be unfavourable-recovering in 2012, in a report noting that a previously observed shortfall in the herb-to-grass ratio appeared to have recovered to a satisfactory 81%.

Plot In the movie's prologue, a young girl with platinum blonde hair witnesses a woman being burned at the stake. In modern times, Rhea Carver awakens from a nightmare. She is the daughter of a reclusive family of witches. Rhea is seen making a dress out of recycled plastic bags as her family practices witchcraft. At school, she begins a rocky relationship with Oliver Sands, a classmate. As the two grow closer, Rhea begins experiencing visions of the young girl with blonde hair, and begins showing her own witchcraft abilities, including bringing a garden of squash back to life and levitating dead tree stumps. Rhea's mother experiences a vision of Rhea laying in a pool of blood and becomes overprotective of Rhea, much to the consternation of Rhea and Rhea's grandmother. As Rhea's powers grow, she shows that she is the chosen one since she possesses all three magical traits: telekinesis, visions, and healing. They inform her of the history of the family and they are the last keepers of the ancient witchcraft tradition. They want Rhea to carry on the family tradition. When she tells them of the visions of the young girl with blonde hair, they mention a prophecy that the daughter of the one who carries all three magical traits will return balance between humans and nature. Rhea's classmates find out she is a witch and several bullies trespass at the Carver home, setting a scarecrow on fire and killing Rhea's pet goat, using its blood to write \\"Witch\\" on the window of her car. Upset at the life they set out for her, Rhea rebels to become \\"normal\\", rejecting her family and Oliver, and beginning a relationship with another classmate named Taylor. During a party, Rhea rides in a car driven by a drunk Taylor. Taylor then crashes his car down a hill and into a tree. She awakens in a pool of blood, but uses her healing power to heal her injuries, and then proceeds to heal and resurrect the other people that were in the car. Rhea returns home, reuniting with Oliver and her family, apologizing for her past actions and promising to fulfill the prophecy.

The building will become Lower Manhattan's tallest residential tower. Excavation started in 2017, but , construction is on hold. History  Site  Swig Equities acquired the 45 Broad Street site, as well as the adjacent Broad Exchange Building, in 2006. Swig planned to demolish a preexisting building at 45 Broad Street and part of the Broad Exchange Building to transfer air rights for a proposed development. Swig wished to build a Nobu Hotel for the site, which was backed by Robert De Niro. The building would have been designed by Moed de Armas and Shannon with a conventional glass curtain wall along with interiors by David Rockwell. The building would have contained a retail base, 128 hotel rooms, and 77 \\"super-luxury\\" condominiums above the hotel on floors 41 through 62. The planned Nobu Hotel would have been 62 stories and in height and was planned for completion in 2010. In January 2009, Swig defaulted on a $49.2 million mortgage from Lehman Brothers, leading to foreclosure on the property. In March 2012, Lehman took control of the property for $76.79 million. In 2014, the parcel was placed on the market, and Madison Equities finalized their acquisition of the land in October of that year. AMS Acquisitions is also an investor in the project, and the building will be constructed by firm Pizzarotti-IBC.  Construction  Real estate site 6sqft released early renderings of the new plans for the site in January 2016. After the release of the renderings, Pizzarotti-IBC Rance MacFarland confirmed that the new structure would be a supertall, residential skyscraper catering to \\"entry- and mid-level buyers\\". More developed renderings were published by The Real Deal in February 2016. Members of the New York real estate industry have expressed doubts that Madison will recoup costs, and the company has faced difficulty receiving funding for the project. These difficulties are in part due to the site's proximity to the New York Stock Exchange Building and the high-level security around that structure. However, the anticipated pricing of units in the building at just under $1 million up to $4 million has attracted additional investors including Gemdale (one of China's largest developers) given the softening super-luxury market. Construction work on the foundation began in April 2017, at which time the building's height was set at , and excavation began in May 2018. The building was approved for construction in December 2019. However, construction was placed on hold in January 2020 when the developers announced that the building would be shortened another to meet Federal Aviation Administration requirements. Usage and amenities The building will be mixed-use with 245 residences and a five-story retail base with dedicated to commercial-retail use and dedicated to a school. Amenities in the building will include a fitness center with a pool, an outdoor garden, and several lounges. Windbreak levels will puncture the facade on the 27th and 43rd floors. The two floors will have 32-foot tall ceilings made open for terrace space. Design The building is being designed by CetraRuddy, which also designed One Madison, and is being built by Pizzarotti LLC. The building's bronze aluminum cladding and its distinctive crown will make it one of the first so-called neo-Art Deco skyscrapers being built in New York City. Subway elevators In July 2016, it was announced that the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission had approved the construction of two new subway elevators outside the entrance to the building, available for public use. They will connect to the existing Broad Street station of the New York City Subway's . The design of the elevators is being overseen by Urbahn Architects. The plans call for two elevators, one for each platform, at the northeastern and southwestern corners of Broad Street and Exchange Place. The New York City Council approved the construction of the elevators in July 2018, and granted the developers 71,391 additional square feet in zoning rights in exchange for building the elevators. However, residents and tenants of 15 and 30 Broad Street opposed construction of glass-and-metal elevators, citing they posed a risk for terrorist attacks.

The line from Afon Wen to Caernarfon was built from the country end, as were the other standard gauge routes to the town, resulting in there being three temporary termini on the edges of Caernarfon. This was eventually resolved by building the \\"Caernarfon Town Line\\"Town line history, via Disused Stations through a tunnel under the historic centre to join the various routes. When this was completed Pant station was closed. The station appears to have been built on rented land, as in November 1868 a Mr Rice Thomas threatened to eject the railway from the station for non-payment of rent. The facilities included a platform and a turntable, both still traceable on the land in the 1940s and a siding which acted as an open air engine shed. Freight and passenger trains passed through the edge of the station site until 7 December 1964, when all services were withdrawn. The line was lifted in 1969. In 1997 the Welsh Highland Railway began running through the edge of the station site, having used part of the trackbed for their narrow gauge line to Porthmadog.

It is an open shrub with very small leaves and clusters of deep pink flowers from late spring to early winter. Description Verticordia tumida is an open shrub with many side-branches and which usually grows to a height of . The leaves are elliptic or egg-shaped, long and about wide. The flowers are scented and arranged in short, spike-like groups near the ends of the branches, each flower on a spreading stalk long. The floral cup is top-shaped, about long and glabrous with thick green appendages long. The sepals are long, spreading, deep pink with 5 or 10 feathery lobes. The petals are a similar colour to the petals, about long, with a fringe long. The style is about long, curved near the tip and hairy. Flowering time is from late October to April, sometimes later. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia tumida was first formally described by Alex George in 1991 from a specimen collected near Tammin by Charles Gardner. The description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (tumida) is a Latin words meaning \\"swollen\\" referring to the appendages on the hypanthium. George placed this species in subgenus Eperephes, section Verticordella along with V. halophila, V. pennigera, V. blepharophylla, V. lindleyi, V. carinata, V. attenuata, V. drummondii, V. wonganensis, V. paludosa, V. luteola, V. bifimbriata, V. mitodes, V. centipeda, V. auriculata, V. pholidophylla, V. spicata and V. hughanii. There are two subspecies: * Verticordia tumida A.S.George subsp. tumida which has 9 or 10 lobes on each of the sepals and a constriction at the base of the floral cup; * Verticordia tumida subsp. therogana A.S.George which 5 to 8 sepal lobes and no constriction of the floral cup. Distribution and habitat Subspecies tumida usually grows in sand, sometimes with loam and clay, in heath and shrubland and mainly occurs between Dowerin, Jitarning and Koolyanobbing. Subspecies therogana grows in sand, often with loam in heath and shrubland between Wickepin and the Peak Charles and the Fitzgerald River National Parks. Conservation Both subspecies of V. tumida are classified as \\"Not Threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Subspecies therogana has been propagated from cuttings more easily than has subsp. tumida. It is also easier to maintain in the garden but not to the degree that it is available in commercial horticulture.

Hoel intended to re-establish the independence of Nantes from Brittany, and Matthew's right to Nantes was hereditary. He bore the Latin title comes Nannetensis.

The film was produced under the banner Madhu Pictures by P. Mallikharjuna Rao. It stars Kanta Rao, Krishna Kumari, Mukkamala and Rajanala.  Plot  Siddhendra Bhattaraka (Mukkamala) is a sage who aims to get immortal powers by practising black magic and by offering three young babies everyday to Black Magic Goddess. King Prabhakara Varma (K. V. S. Sarma), who is furious with Siddhendra's acts even after repeated warnings, orders Siddhendra to be exiled from the kingdom of Tejovathi. While being sent out to a forest, Siddhendra tries to escape and he loses his big toe when he is shot with an arrow by one of the King's soldiers. He hides behind a rock and misguides the soldiers by dropping his big toe in another route. While walking through the forest, he hears a woman screaming and being attacked by a giant vulture. He fights with the vulture and kills it. The woman he saved is a witch called Sarpakesi and the vulture that tried to kill her is a warlock. Sarpakesi is impressed and grants him a boon. She builds a volcano (Jwala Dweepa) for Siddhendra and arranges a secret place inside it for him to perform all rituals in order to achieve immortal powers. She also snatches three small babies every day from the citizens of the kingdom through her black magic and brings them to Siddhendra for Goddess offerings. One day Black Magic Goddess appears and tells Siddhendra that he can never achieve immortal powers in spite of all these offerings as he is considered handicapped due to losing his big toe. With the help of Sarpakesi, Siddhendra drowns the boat of king's army coming to attack him. Sarpakesi recommends Siddhendra to accept one of the servants of the King Prabhakara Varma, Bhallataka Varma (Rajanala Kaleswara Rao) as his disciple and train him to achieve the goal. Bhallataka joins hands with Siddhendra and they conduct worship for five years to Snake God to gain immortal powers. Finally, Snake God blesses Bhallataka with immortal powers with one condition that his hands should never be filled with blood, meaning he can't kill anyone. Bhallataka overtakes the kingdom of Prabhakara Varma and gets the King, the Queen and their four sons imprisoned in the volcano under the control of Sarpakesi. One of the servants manages to escape with the King's fifth son, Anand Varma (Kanta Rao) without Bhallataka's knowledge. Siddhendra creates an immortal girl called Lalasa and gets her married to Bhallataka. In an inauspicious moment, Lalasa gives birth to a baby girl, Aravinda (Krishna Kumari). Fed up with the atrocities, the chief priest curses Bhallataka that his own son-in-law will be killing Bhallataka. Bhallataka first thinks of killing his daughter, but couldn't because he will lose his powers. So, he decides not to get his daughter married. The chief priest is imprisoned and tortured by Sarpakesi. Bhallataka passes a rule that every citizen in the kingdom should worship him as the only God and should remove any idols or pictures of other gods from temples and houses. People like Kanteerava, who opposed this rule are harassed and jailed. The servant who raised Anand reveals the secret that Anand is the son of the King Prabhakara Varma and explains all the crimes of Bhallataka. Anand comes to the Tejovathi kingdom and is jailed for opposing Bhallataka's views by the commander Dalapathi (Kaikala Satya Narayana). Anand, through a small hole in the jail happens to see the princess Aravinda singing and falls for her. Both exchange words and Aravinda also falls for Anand. The rest of the story is all about how Anand married Aravinda and released his family from the volcano (Jwala Dweepa) by killing Bhallataka and Siddhendra.

Sandberg and starring Lotta Losten. The film was released online on 30 December 2013 on both Vimeo and YouTube. The short film was the basis of an eponymous 2016 film adaptation, also directed by Sandberg.  Plot  On a dark and rainy night, a woman (Lotta Losten) comes out of a room and turns off the hallway light, which causes a long- haired, humanlike silhouette to become visible at the other end of the hallway. Surprised, the woman turns the light back on and the silhouette vanishes. Switching the light off and on, she watches the silhouette appear and disappear, stopping when the silhouette suddenly moves so close it's inches away from her face. Gasping, she turns the light back on and tapes the switch in that position to prevent the silhouette from returning. The woman goes to bed, leaving the lamp on her bedside table on and the door leading to the lit hallway ajar. She hears creaking sounds and looks towards the doorway. The hallway light turns off. Scared, she hears footsteps approaching the bedroom and hides under the blanket. After a few seconds of silence, she peeks out. The door opens wider by itself, which terrifies the woman. The lamp flickers. From under the blanket, the woman looks towards the power strip it‚Äôs plugged in to. She nervously reaches out, locates the plug, and pushes it in more firmly. The flickering stops. The hallway light clicks back on and she sees it‚Äôs on again and the door is only slightly ajar again. She calms down, then suddenly sees a monstrous humanoid with all-white eyes and an open mouth at her bedside table. It turns off the lamp, and the screen goes dark. Production The film had practically no budget as it involved only Sandberg and Losten. The film involved two lights and two rooms. In particular, he used a Blackmagic cinema camera with a Tokina 11-16 lens, a Zoom H4N with a R√∏de NTG1 microphone, a paper lantern from IKEA, a 375-watt photo bulb, a Chinese knockoff redhead light from eBay, a Manfrotto tripod, a homemade dolly with PVC pipe, a piece of shelving from Ikea, and skate wheels. The special effects of having the ghost appear and disappear were mostly done by using a split- screen technique. In an interview with The A.V. Club about the 2016 feature- length adaptation, which used the same technique, Sandberg said, \\"Whenever she's in frame with another character, it's basically just a split screen. So you shoot it with her and without her. You turn the camera on with her, you turn it off and she walks off, and then you turn it on again. It's super simple, actually.\\"  Release and reception  The short film was first released for a film festival called the Bloody Cuts Horror Challenge, where it was a finalist and where Sandberg won Best Director. Some months later, the short film became popular online on Vimeo and YouTube, going from about 8,000 views to over 1 million and attracting Hollywood directors and producers. As of May 2020, the video has almost 15 million views on YouTube. The short received critical acclaim.

In 2006, Brazilian singers Lio Junior and Thiago Casarejos created MadHouse, a blend of image and sound mixing styles, aesthetics, personality and musical genres.  History  Lio Junior and Thiago Casarejos met after talking online for some time about musical affinities and a handful of coincidences, such as several common friends, even though they had never seen each other. They talked a lot about music in a train from the city of Mogi das Cruzes to S√£o Paulo and the first ideas for projects sprouted as well as a lifetime musical partnership and friendship. Amongst all the things they had in common was the desire to create a new Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll concept as a duo. They sang together in a band in S√£o Paulo as a test for what was to come next. After one year they moved to the state of Minas Gerais where they started a band named MadHouse with another four members. They wore outfits and makeup that reminded of glam rock bands and were mostly influenced by hard rock and classic rock. Quickly the struggle to keep musicians with their same goals, musical and creative ambitions, led MadHouse to become a duo and they started hiring a band to join them in shows. The contact and exchange they experienced with every different band formation drew them to keep exploring their own musical concept and identity. In Minas Gerais they played with Doctor Sin's guitarist Edu Ardanuy and they were also the opening act for the Zimbo Trio in a local jazz festival. When they moved to S√£o Paulo, where they are well known by several Brazilian artists and celebrities, they started creating their own material and in 2015 they recorded their first original song ‚ÄúVendetta‚Äù., produced by Thiago ‚ÄúBig‚Äù Rabello. Right after that they were invited for a series of shows in the world's musical capital ‚Äì Ibiza ‚Äì where they played a three-month season singing in the trendiest places in the island, which reverberated on local media with interviews on the local radio station and its main communication vehicles. ‚ÄúVendetta‚Äù was the subject of an interview on Global RadioGlobal Radio and White Radio, the two main radio stations in Ibiza. The duo was highlighted in the cultural column of the newspaper Di√°rio de Ibiza where they talked about their stay on the island. MadHouse in Programa do J√¥ After the release of their song ‚ÄúVendetta‚Äù during the summer season in Ibiza, MadHouse returned to Brazil and shot a music video to follow up the release of the song in their home country. The duo started publicizing their single and made their way on highly regarded TV shows, websites and news portals ‚ÄúFalling‚Äù, their second single, was released with a lyric video shot in the city and coastline of S√£o Paulo, followed by the release of its official music video, exploring images of the lyric video merged with studio images. After a series of concerts at Burlesque ‚Äì Paris 6 in 2017, the duo went back to Ibiza and released a special remix of ‚ÄúVendetta‚Äù produced by DJ Deeplick to celebrate the first anniversary of the song. During their stay in Europe, they shot the music video of their third single ‚ÄúNo More‚Äù, and were once again the focus of the local media. The video was released in March 2018 and has several special guests, such as Brazilian influencers Cau√™ Moura and PC Siqueira, visual artist Olivier Mour√£o as well as fashion designers and models from Adlib Moda Ibiza, an association of local designers that is responsible for spreading the fashion from Ibiza throughout Europe. After Ibiza, the duo went to London to search for inspiration for their next single.

History  In 1417, a local artist painted an icon of the Virgin following the design of a local painter Maestro Martello. The image was placed on an oak tree in the countryside, and became a source of veneration, which only increased in 1467 during a scourge of the plague. Miracles were attributed to the icon, and the image was ensconced in a chapel. An altar was erected in 1467 and a chapel commissioned by Pope Paul II.Signorelli Mario, Santuario Madonna della Quercia, Viterbo: storia, arte e culto nei secoli, a cura della Cassa di Risparmio della provincia di Viterbo in occasione del V centenario della Manifestazione miracolosa, Viterbo 1967. The chapel was initially affiliated with the Gesuati order, a Tuscan order which specialized in the aid to pilgrims. The Franciscans within a few years substituted the Gesuati and commissioned this larger church. The church was constructed between 1470 and 1525. On the 8 of April 1578, the church was consecrated by the Cardinal Francesco de Gambara, who is buried in the church. The event was celebrated with a cycle of frescoes at the Palazzo dei Priori, Viterbo. The sanctuary acquired many patrons, including popes. In 1867, Pius IX made the church a minor basilica. The facade is built with rustic stone. The three portal lunettes have terracotta decorations depicting the Madonna, Saints and Angels (1504‚Äì1508), completed by Andrea della Robbia. The bell tower has three orders of columns. The interior has a central nave and two aisles with a ceiling designed by Antonio da Sangallo the younger, depicting the symbols of the Madonna, Pope Paul III, and the Lion symbol of Viterbo. The Campanile, built in 1481‚Äì1505 by Ambrogio da Milano, was demolished in the 17th century. The counter-facade has a fresco (1636) depicting the Miracle of the Priest of Canapina by Angelo Pucciati. The walls of the chapels have 17th and 18th- century frescoes detached from nearby suppressed or destroyed churches.

The company had daily departures to Aarhus and Aalborg and departures one to three times a week to smaller towns such as Frederikshavn, Fredericia, Kolding, Horsens, Vejle, Randers, Aabenraa, Faaborg, Middelfart, Svendborg and S√∏nderborg. The pier was extended to its current length in 1877-1878. Most of the domestic ferry routes gradually disappeared after World War II. They were replaced by the Oslo Ferries in 1974 and a few years later followed the Bornholm Ferries. The Oslo Ferries moved to the northern tip of Amerikakaj in the 2000s while the Bornholm Ferries moved to K√∏ge. The site changed dramatically when the Royal Danish Playhouse opened in 2008. In 2010, Copenhagen City Council approved Realdania's Kv√¶sthus Project and the pier was temporarily converted into a beach setting under the name Ofelia Beach. Ofelia Plads and the underground car park was inaugurated on 29 June 2016. Public space Ofelia Plads The public space runs in the full length of the pier.. Large squares coated with dark grooved concrete, step down in the north and disappear under the water level. It is approximately 450 metres long and has an area of 1,100 square metres. The square is equipped with pavilions containing the entrance to the car park, a caf√©, toilets, ticket sales for the harbour tours and a fly tower for outdoor plays, concerts and other kinds of performance. Furthermore, the square is arranged with the possibility for installing big screens, temporary covers, and is equipped with gear for various street- and beach sports. Stairs and jetties in multiple locations along the edges of the pier makes it possible to access the water. Car park The underground car park is in 3 floors, covers 17.800 square metres and has room for 500 cars. It has high ceilings and allows daylight to reach into all three levels via a grand atrium. The car park is operated by Jeudan. They donate an amount of money per car that uses the facility to the cultural activities. Cultural events Ofelia Plads plays host to a wide array of cultural activities. They include opera, ballet, concerts and reading of storeys to children. The events are curated and organized by the Royal Danish Theatre. Other activities The dock between the pier and the main harborfront will be converted into an ice skating rink in the winter time. A Harbour Bath will open at the tip of the pier in 2017.

At the beginning of the group's recording career, they achieved success with pop and novelty songs. In addition, the band recorded cover albums for Arc Records before venturing into early elements of psychedelic rock with their best-known single \\"Ship of Dreams\\" in 1967. The Quiet Jungle released one more single later in the year before disbanding; however, more recordings are rumored to exist. History Late in 1965, the band started out as the house act at the Pressmen's Club, performing under the name the Secrets, with a line-up which featured Doug Rankine (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Bob Mark (lead guitar), Henry S. Thaler (electric piano), Mike Woodruff (bass guitar), and Rick Felstead (drums). Record producer Brian Macfarlane approached the Secrets with a proposal, in early 1966, to record a novelty song he had composed for Toronto Maple Leafs player Eddie Shack, who was enjoying a breakout season at the time. Titled \\"Clear the Track, Here Comes Shack\\", the single, backed by the lesser-known \\"Warming the Bench\\", was a simplistic, but catchy tune which was released on Canada International, and became a huge commercial success on Toronto's CHUM Charts, where it peaked at number one for two weeks. Rankine, who thought the song was a gift specifically for Shack, recalled the circumstances surrounding its release: \\"We didn‚Äôt know it was going to be released as a single and played across the entire country. Once it was released, we thought (or hoped) it would just disappear into the night and nobody would care about it. As fate would have it, it didn‚Äôt disappear. For some reason people loved it\\". Despite the success of \\"Clear the Track, Here Comes Shack\\", the song was an artistic embarrassment for the Secrets, who desired to maintain a hip image on the coffeehouse and club circuit. The group's follow-up, \\"Cryin' Over Here\\" on Arc Records, did not replicate the first single's sales worth; however, it is generally considered to be one of the Secrets' better releases. Mark penned \\"Cryin' Over Here\\" and assumed the role as the group's chief songwriter, writing or co- writing the band's next four sides. Eager to distance themselves further from \\"Clear the Track, Here Comes the Shack\\", the Secrets adopted the moniker the Quiet Jungle in early 1967. At the tail-end of the band's association with Arc Records, the Quiet Jungle anonymously recorded a cover album devoted to the Monkees' songs called A Little Bit Me, I‚Äôm a Believer, She Hangs Out plus 9 other ‚ÄòTail-Hanger‚Äô Favorites, and the children's album The Story of Snoopy's Christmas. The group released \\"Ship of Dreams\\" in February 1967 on Yorkville Records, making the group believe they had finally \\"turned the corner\\", and could be considered serious musicians. Exhibiting elements of primitive psychedelia with an eerie opening similar to Fever Tree's \\"San Francisco Girls (Return of the Native)\\", \\"Ship of Dreams\\" reached number 31 on the CHUM Charts and was also featured on the Yorkville Evolution compilation album in the same year. However, as Rankine explained, the band could not escape its publicity as the Secrets: \\"Our bookings increased and we were playing right across Canada. Everyone booking us however, wanted the 'Secrets' to play 'Clear the Track Here Comes Shack' and not the group that just released 'Ship of Dreams'\\". For their final release, Yorkville Records issued \\"Too Much in Love\\"; it failed to chart and is considered the rarest of the Quiet Jungle's catalogue. Thereafter, the group slowly began to disband during 1968: first with Woodruff leaving then Rankine, who departed after having doubts of being a serviceable singer in the band. More recordings by the group were made; however, only one song, \\"Four in the Morning\\", is confirmed to exist in the Arc Records vaults. Over the years, the B-side to the \\"Ship of Dreams\\" single, titled \\"Everything\\", has become the most commonly reissued song by the Quiet Jungle. It appears on the compilation albums The Midwest Vs. Canada, Volume 2, Psychedelic Disaster Whirl, and An Overdose of Heavy Psych, among others.

History Project approval was given in 2013, and in 2015, Severnoye Design Bureau was awarded with a contract for the creation of a smaller non-nuclear and heavier nuclear-powered variant of the future destroyer. In 2016, the Krylov State Scientific Center handed the preliminary design of the destroyer to the Russian Navy. Initially, twelve ships were planned to be built and split between Russia's Northern and Pacific fleets. Later, construction of eight vessels was mentioned. A May 2017 report indicated that the Lider-class destroyer had been dropped from the Russia's State Armament Programme for 2018‚Äì2027 due to financing reductions, however in June 2017, United Shipbuilding Corporation announced the Russian Defense Ministry had approved the preliminary design of the Lider class destroyer. In February 2019, a decision was made to build the 19,000 ton nuclear-powered variant of the destroyer, instead of the proposed 12-13,000 ton variant equipped with a gas- turbine powerplant. Two vessels should be built by end of the 2020s at a cost of RUB100 billion per vessel. It is believed the construction of lead vessel could begin as soon as in 2023.

He further reported the new destroyer \\"is meant to replace the s, the main anti-surface warships of the Russian Navy, as well as the s and the anti-submarine destroyers.\\" The new destroyer will have extensive food storage and stores, giving them an independent cruising capability of 90 days.

After finishing secondary school, in 1923, he moved to Leipzig to study the violin with H. Wassermann, followed by specializations in Paris with Lucien Capet in 1924 and 1926, in P√≠sek with the violin pedagogue Otakar ≈†evƒç√≠k in 1925 and 1927, as well as in Berlin at the Stern'sches Konservatorium with Carl Flesch from 1928 to 1930.Encyclopedia of Bulgarian Music Culture.

In 1930, Prokopiev returned to Bulgaria and became a music teacher in the American College of Sofia, establishing his own private music school that existed until 1936. In 1940, he taught at the First Male Gymnasium of Sofia. During the Second World War, Prokopiev had the idea of creating the vocal choir of the Bulgarian army. Soon after the Bulgarian coup d'√©tat of 1944, he established the Representative Choir to the Bulgarian People's Army, renamed afterwards as Ensemble for Songs and Dances of the BPA, and nowadays: Representative Ensemble of the Bulgarian Armed Forces. Prokopiev was conductor of the choir until 1957. The first choir's performance took place in 1944, a concert by 26 vocalists. Later, Prokopiev started attracting instrumentalists, too, as well as some of the finest Bulgarian opera singers of the time, such as Dimitar Uzunov and Nikola Nikolov, as well as the composer Asen Karastoyanov, who composed approximately 50 songs especially for the choir.–ü—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª–Ω–∏—è—Ç –∞–Ω—Å–∞–º–±—ä–ª –Ω–∞ –í—ä–æ—Ä—ä–∂–µ–Ω–∏—Ç–µ —Å–∏–ª–∏ 70 –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∏ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤—è –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –º—É–∑–∏–∫–∞–ª–Ω–∞ –∫—É–ª—Ç—É—Ä–∞ –ø–æ —Å–≤–µ—Ç–∞, –°–∞–π—Ç –Ω–∞ –ë–ù–†, 1 October 2014 In 1941, Prokopiev wrote \\"Methodics of singing\\", in which he developed the topic of singing as a separate subject in Bulgarian schools.

The base was actually in the hamlet of Little Onn which is north west of Wheaton Aston. The base was known locally as Little Onn or RAF Little Onn, but the policy of naming Royal Air Force stations was down to which parish the Station Headquarters was in. The airfield was one of the Royal Air Force's largest training environments in the Second World War with an average of 11,000+ flying hours per month by 1944. History Originally constructed from October 1940 onwards as a relief landing ground for RAF Hixon, the base at Wheaton Aston was completed six months before Hixon was. Instead Wheaton Aston became a satellite airfield of RAF High Ercall under the auspices of the Service Flying Training School (SFTS) at RAF Shawbury and a training base for No. 11 (Pilots) Advanced Flying Unit ((P)AFU). Because of the upturn in training at the base, it eventually went on to have 5 Relief Landing Grounds/Satellite sites of its own (RAF Bratton, RAF Peplow, RAF Perton, RAF Seighford & RAF Tatenhill). Throughout its existence, RAF Wheaton Aston was parented by RAF Shawbury and was dedicated to (P)AFU and Beam Approach Training (BAT). BAT was an early form of instrument landing system using radio beams. Training units based here were No. 11 (P)AFU, No 11 SFTS, No.21 (P)AFU, No. 1511 BAT Flight, No. 1517 BAT Flight and No. 1545 BAT Flight. No. 11 (P)AFU was structured into six flights, three were based at RAF Shawbury with one each at RAF Condover, RAF Perton and Wheaton Aston. Pilots on the Empire Training Scheme at Wheaton Aston received refresher and night training on Airspeed Oxford aircraft before being posted out to an Operational Training Unit with the training extended to foreign as well as domestic aircrews. All the main units that trained at Wheaton Aston used the Airspeed Oxford Aircraft. Throughout the Second World War, Wheaton Aston remained busy and was second only to RAF Lichfield in terms of aircraft movements in Staffordshire. The airfield recorded a flying time of 8,773 hours during daylight and 2,605 at night over the course May in 1944. This was the equivalent of 15 aircraft permanently in the air for 30 days. Training units in the Second World War, particularly those which were satellite or relief land grounds, attracted the need to be doubly insured because of the inherent nature of the training. RAF Wheaton Aston was one of two bases which were insured three times over (the other being RAF Little Rissington) because of the high casualty rate and inexperience of aircrews. The Shropshire Union Canal is just to the east of the site and it is believed that the canal fooled some of the new pilots during night-time training. At least one aircraft, an American P-47 Thunderbolt ended up in the canal, though this was down to an engine failure with the aircraft undershooting the airfield and plunging into the canal. Whilst the pilot avoided serious injury, the aircraft was dragged out of the canal and scrapped. The Luftwaffe dropped a 500lb bomb on the base but according to the locals, due to it being a (P)AFU, the number of crashes in the fields around the station by aircrew under training were just as memorable as the aerial bombardments. With peace in Europe declared, Canadian personnel working at Wheaton Aston were repatriated from the base in June 1945. The same month saw some RAF and WAAF personnel released from service duties to go back to civilian life. The downturn in training did not seem to affect Wheaton Aston at this time as the monthly tally on flying hours reached 9,600, which was only marginally less than the average of flying hours recorded during the training's peak. In October 1946, Aneurin Bevan, who was Minister for Health at the time, flew into the base from Croydon to attend a conference in Stoke-on-Trent. Although training continued, with the end of the Second World War, the base at Wheaton Aston was surplus to requirements and the last unit to operate there, No. 21 (P)AFU was moved to Moreton-in-Marsh in December 1946. The base was abandoned completely by the Royal Air Force in 1947. Post RAF From 1947 to 1965, the former airbase buildings were used to house Polish immigrants, many of whom had been displaced by the Second World War. Some were in transit before going on to America and Canada whilst some stayed behind and upon closure of the camp, were housed locally at Gnosall and in Stafford. One of those who arrived at the former RAF Base and stayed on in Stafford was Zdzislaw Luszowicz, a former SOE agent who had fought in Poland during the Second World War. In the 1950s, Wheaton Aston was a waypoint in the Goodyear Trophy Race. The race involved competitors flying from Wolverhampton Airport (next to the Goodyear plant in Wolverhampton) and back again in a circle via Pillarton Hall, Penkridge, Wheaton Aston, Ackerley and Wolverhampton again in a round trip. Since the mid-1960s, the former base area has been used for pig farming and agricultural purposes, but the outlines of the airfield are still visible on aerial mapping. The airfield, guardhouse and control tower are all registered monuments. Additionally, the eastern perimeter track for the aircraft has been adapted for use as a local road. A study commissioned by the airfield's owners in 2000 declared that the airfield was beyond economic revival.

After the murder of her friend and mentor, the communist pioneer Rosa Luxemburg, she inherited Luxemburg's copious collection of papers, and devoted much time to organising the archive. During the 1930s, with her partner Paul Fr√∂lich, Rosi Wolfstein worked on an important biography of Luxemburg. Life Family provenance and early years Rosalie Wolfstein was born at Witten, then a rapidly growing industrial city west of Dortmund in the Ruhr region. Her father, Samuel Wolfstein (1843‚Äì1901), was a businessman. She was one of her parents' four recorded children. Her elder brother, Paul, later died in the First World War: later still, in 1942, both her sisters, Wilhelmine and Bertha, would be deported to Auschwitz concentration camp and murdered. On leaving the local secondary school Wolfstein undertook a commercial training and embarked on a career as an office worker. In 1908 a change in the law legalised female participation in politics, and Wolfstein lost no time in joining the Social Democratic Party of Germany (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). She had already, the previous year, joined the \\"Women's and Girls' Workers' Education Association\\" (\\"Frauen- und M√§dchen-Arbeiterbildungsverein\\") in Hagen. In 1910 she joined the National Employees Association (\\"Zentralverband der Angestellten\\" / ZdA), part of the Free Trade Union grouping. By 1913 she had become an SPD party activist in her native Lower Rhine region. Rosa Luxemburg It was in 1910 that she first came across Rosa Luxemburg, four years her senior and already established and respected within the party. On meeting Luxemburg, Wolfstein later wrote she was at once in awe and initially disappointed, because Luxemburg was so small in stature and so different from the woman Wolfstein had expected her to be. Initial disappointment was quickly replaced by respect as the two became friends, each recognising in the other a shared political outlook. Between 1912 and 1913 Wolfstein studied as one of Luxemburg's pupils at the party academy in Berlin. For nine years, till 1919, the two of them worked closely together on political matters. One thing they had in common was a talent for public speaking, and the evening before the 1912 General Election - in which their SPD won twice as many votes as the next placed party - Luxemburg and Wolfstein, described by one admirer as a woman of small stature and extraordinary presence, shared a platform at the final major pre-election event. When war broke out in the late summer of 1914 Wolfstein was one of those in the SPD who opposed the party leadership decision to agree a political truce at the outbreak of the war and, more specifically, to vote in favour of \\"war credits\\". During the war she was an activist within the Spartacus League in the Duisburg region and, as a radical pacifist, was several times arrested, spending in total approximately a year in prison during the war. She took part in the illegal youth conference at Jena in Easter 1916, as a delegate from the Duisburg Socialist young Workers. In a secret police report dated 10 May 1917 Wolfstein was identified as a \\"fanatical individual\\" (\\"fanatische Pers√∂nlichkeit\\"): she and her fellow campaigners in Duisburg were frequently characterised as \\"enemy agents\\" (\\"feindliche Agenten\\"). As the scale of the human slaughter on the front line and of the economic destitution on the home front mounted, the number of SPD politicians opposing the war increased, and it was primarily over this issue that the SPD (party) split in 1917. In 1917 Wolfstein was at the founding conference of the breakaway faction, launched as the Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD) at Gotha. She attended as a representative of the Spartacus League, which now became a quasi-autonomous element within the new party. After the war, revolution War ended, formally, in November 1918 and was followed in Germany by an outburst of revolutionary events, especially in the cities, which lasted for about a year. Unusually, in view of her gender, Wolfstein was elected to the Soldiers' and Workers' Council in D√ºsseldorf, which had become the focus of the revolution for the Lower Rhine region. At the close of 1918 she and Rosa Luxemburg were among the five identifiable women among the 127 delegates at what became the founding congress of the German Communist Party in Berlin. Luxemburg was assassinated a couple of weeks later, but Wolfstein subsequently attended the Second World Congress of the Comintern, held in Moscow in July 1920. Getting to Petrograd and from there to Moscow through the chaos of the Russian Civil War involved disguising herself as a man and using a false passport. In Moscow she met, and according to one source quarreled, with Lenin. Rosi Wolfstein was away in D√ºsseldorf on 15 January 1919 when Rosa Luxemburg was murdered in Berlin. Together with her partner, Paul Fr√∂lich, for the next ten years she effectively worked as Luxemburg's literary executor, gathering together the various papers left behind into a coherent archive. One product of this was Fr√∂lich's biography of Luxemburg, \\"Rosa Luxemburg. Thoughts and Action\\" (\\"Rosa Luxemburg. Gedanke und Tat\\"), which was published, initially, in Paris in 1939. Party insider: party splits Between 1921 and 1924 she sat as a \\"United Communist Party\\" member of the Prussian regional legislature (\\"Landtag\\"), where within the parliament she was deputy leader of the party group. Between 1921 and 1923 she was also a member of the party head office and organisation team, where she had responsibility for party publishers. However, use of the word \\"united\\" in the party name reflected a continuing propensity to party infighting through the 1920s, and in 1924, after the Ninth Party Congress, held in Frankfurt am Main, Wolfstein resigned her party and parliamentary posts in protest against the \\"ultra left-wing\\" party leadership around Ruth Fischer und Arkadi Maslow. During the second half of the 1920s she was able to devote more of her energies to her work as an editor with the Malik Publishing House. Together with Paul Fr√∂lich she also worked on producing the first collected edition of the writings of Rosa Luxemburg. Meanwhile, factionalism within the communist party continued, and in 1929, as the \\"hardline\\" faction around Ernst Th√§lmann, set about aligning the party more closely with the Stalinist faction in Moscow, Wolfstein was one of those identified as a right-wing deviant (\\"Rechtsabweichlerin\\"): she was excluded from the party early in 1929. Between 1929 and 1932 she was active within the alternative communist party, known as the Communist Party of Germany (Opposition) (\\"Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (Opposition)\\" / KPDO) created under the leadership of fellow expellees, Heinrich Brandler and August Thalheimer. The KPDO itself split in 1932 and Rosi Wolfstein, together with Paul Fr√∂lich and political allies such as Jacob Walcher and August Enderle, joined with the left-wing breakaway faction that now formed the Socialist Workers' Party (\\"Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands\\" / SAPD). A fellow member of the SAPD was Willy Brandt who became a lifelong friend. Brandt is on record as commending Wolfstein's \\"commitment to a combative and liberal socialism\\" (\\"Engagement f√ºr einen k√§mpferischen und freiheitlichen Sozialismus\\"). More than fifty years later, Brandt still used to visit Wolfstein-Fr√∂lich in the retirement home where she spent her final years: his last visit to her was in March 1987, some nine months before she died. Nazi Germany: exile In January 1933 the political backdrop was transformed when the Nazi Party took power and converted Germany into a one- party dictatorship. Political activity - except in support of the Nazi Party - became illegal. At the end of February the Reichstag fire was instantly blamed on the Communists, and in March 1933 those identified as Communists began to be arrested. In March 1933 Rosi Wolfstein, susceptible to Nazi persecution both because of her political record and on account of her Jewishness, fled to Brussels in Belgium. During or before 1936 she relocated to Paris where it is known she was an activist member of the leadership of the exiled German SAPD (party). In Paris she was among the exiled socialists to sign the call, in December 1936, for a united Popular Front in order to \\"overthrow Hitler, and all who persecute the German people! For Freedom, Peace and Bread!\\" (\\"Sturz Hitlers und aller Peiniger des deutschen Volkes! F√ºr Freiheit, Frieden und Brot!\\"). She signed, however, not with her real name, but using the pseudonym \\"Marta Koch\\". War resumed, for France and Germany in September 1939. For eight months life in France felt little changed, but in May 1940 Germany invaded from the north. During the six weeks that it took for the German army to over- run the northern half of the country, the government set about identifying as enemy aliens thousands of German refugees who had, for reasons of politics and/or race, fled to Paris from Nazi Germany. On 2 September 1940 Wolfstein and Fr√∂lich were arrested, detained and in due course placed in internment camps in the far south of the country. Wolfstein was accompanied by a report from the Paris police dated January 1941 and describing her as a \\"communist journalist and propagandist, dangerous to public order\\" (\\"journaliste et propagandiste communiste dangereuse pour l'ordre public\\") . Detention facilities where she was held included Rieucros and finally Bompard. Paul Fr√∂lich was held at Vernet and Bassens. Many of the camps used for \\"enemy aliens\\" had originally been set up to accommodate republican fighters returning from defeat in the Spanish Civil War, and initially the emphasis was not on security, but during 1941 the authorities began to formulate plans to separate out Jewish internees and ship them to equivalent facilities inside Germany where their circumstances would be more malign. Thanks to the actions of Varian Fry and his Emergency Rescue Committee, in February 1941 Wolfstein and Fr√∂lich were provided with emergency visas. They escaped together to New York City, travelling to North America by way of Lisbon and Martinique. Woflstein and Fr√∂lich lived together in New York from 1941 till 1950. In 1948 they married each other. She was actively involved in various New York based welfare organisations while Fr√∂lich focused on academic work. Final years They returned to Germany in 1951, settling in Frankfurt am Main, which till 1949 had been in the American occupation zone and was now beginning to emerge as a major administrative and commercial hub in a new German state, the Federal Republic (\\"West Germany\\"). Disillusioned with Soviet mandated communism, she now rejoined the Social Democratic Party, forty three years after first having joined it. She nevertheless remained firmly on the left of the party, an advocate, like her husband, of the elusive \\"third way\\" between Communism and Capitalism, and convinced that for historical reasons only the SPD could deliver it.Mario Ke√üler: Heroische Illusion und Stalin-Terror. Beitr√§ge zur Kommunismus-Forschung. Hamburg 1999, p. 152 She was also active in the recently created printers' trades union, IG Druck und Papier and was involved in the establishment of the German Journalists' Union which originated in 1951 as a sub-section of the printers' union. After Paul Fr√∂lich died, his widow managed his literary estate and attended to the publication of some of his writings. She died at Frankfurt, half a year short of what would have been her one hundredth birthday. At her burial, which took place in the city's main cemetery, Holger B√∂rner, the regional Minister-president, gave a speech of tribute, asserting that she \\"always fought with heart and mind for social causes\\" (\\"stets mit Herz und Verstand f√ºr die soziale Sache eingetreten\\") and celebrating her as \\"a second Rosa Luxemburg\\".

Founded in 1935 by Leroy \\"Pop\\" Williams, it was the city's premier club for black jazz performers. Like its Harlem counterpart, the Cotton Club, many of Club Harlem's guests were white, wealthy and eager to experience a night of African-American entertainment. An elaborate all-black revue called Smart Affairs, produced by Larry Steele and headquartered at the club from 1946 to 1971, featured 40 to 50 acts and was on a par with Broadway productions. Performers at the club included Sammy Davis Jr. (who would also invite the white members of the Rat Pack), Dick Gregory, Dinah Washington, Bootsie Barnes, Gladys Knight, Teddy Pendegrass, Hot Lips Page, and Wild Bill Davis. Drummer Crazy Chris Columbo conducted the club orchestra for 34 years. Club Harlem was outfitted with seven bars, two lounges and a main showroom seating over 900. A cocktail lounge had room for 400 guests with continuous entertainment available. Club Harlem was the site of the 1972 Easter morning shootout of a Black Mafia operative by three rival operatives, leaving five dead and 20 wounded, in full view of a show audience estimated at about 600 people. The club closed in 1986 and was demolished in 1992. Mementos salvaged from the club are part of a traveling exhibition which has appeared in Atlantic City and other locales since 2010. History Club Harlem was founded in 1935 by Leroy \\"Pop\\" Williams on the site of a dance hall called Fitzgerald's Auditorium. Williams was a medical student at University of Pennsylvania when he managed to acquire enough money to buy Fitzgerald's; he left college after becoming the owner of the nightclub. Williams gave the new nightclub the name of the Manhattan neighborhood because \\"a lot of black people live there\\". The district, known as \\"Kentucky Avenue and the Curb\\", had become the home for African Americans in the racially segregated city since the end of World War I. The new nightspot joined other popular black entertainment venues in the district such as Grace's Little Belmont, the Wintergarten, and the Paradise Club. Along with Harlem's Cotton Club, it was a place for the moneyed set to enjoy an evening of African-American entertainment. When the club opened in 1935, there were slot machines along with a basketball court on the top floor of the building. In the 1940s the club became known as Clifton's Club Harlem. Club Harlem in 1940 In July 1940, Club Harlem, Little Belmont, the Paradise Club, and the Wonder Bar were targeted in a midnight raid by police officers, accompanied by the newly elected mayor, Tom Taggart, seeking proof of illegal gambling activities. The police confiscated \\"three truckloads of gambling paraphernalia\\" and arrested 32 club owners and employees, then shut down the four clubs. The next day the clubs were open for business as usual. In 1947, showman Larry Steele introduced an all-black revue called Smart Affairs to Club Harlem. The elaborate show, featuring 40 to 50 acts including comedians, singers, showgirls, chorus lines, and dance numbers, was headquartered at the club through 1970, and also toured throughout the United States and abroad between the 1940s and 1960s, including venues in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Adelaide, Australia, and Toronto, Canada. The budget for the \\"Smart Affairs\\" shows ran as high as US$35,000 per week. The shows were on a par with Broadway productions. Smart Affairs productions grossed between $400,000 and $500,000 annually by the early 1960s. Steele also founded the Sepia Revue and Beige Beauties chorus lines at the club. Entertainer Lola Falana was discovered by Sammy Davis, Jr. while working in Club Harlem's chorus line. In 1951 Williams and his brother, Clifton Williams, brought in other partners, including Ben Alten of the Paradise Club. By 1954, Williams and Alten owned the Club Harlem and the Paradise Club, operating both under joint ownership. The club employed 200 people in 1964. Its busiest time was during the tourist season from mid June to Labor Day. Alten described the club's most profitable time as being between 1959 and 1977. On the weekends, between 20 and 25 buses from areas in the Northeastern United States arrived, bringing guests who wanted to see the club's shows. By 1968, Williams began having difficulty booking some African- American entertainers into the venue. He wrote an open letter to baseball star Jackie Robinson, who had a regular column in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper. The entertainers in question did not want to work at venues catering to African Americans. After the death of Pop Williams in 1976, Alten's new business partner was businessman Calvin Brock. Alten and Brock refurbished the club, but business was never as good as it was in the past. Description Club Harlem was outfitted with two lounges and a main showroom seating over 900. A cocktail lounge had room for 400 guests with continuous entertainment available. The club was equipped with seven bars; the front bar alone accommodated nearly 100 people. Guitarist Pat Martino recalled in his biography: \\"In the front room at Club Harlem you had two stages for two different groups. Willis Jackson would do forty minutes, and then Chris Columbo's band would do forty minutes. They'd split sets all night long. And in the large back room you had singers like Sammy Davis with an orchestra. That was an incredible place\\". Weekends at Club Harlem started on Friday night with the two bands alternating sets; the music kept going until Monday morning. Shows The club scheduled matinees, nighttime shows, late-night shows, and a 6 a.m. \\"breakfast show\\" during the summer tourist season. The music played from 10 p.m. Saturday night to 6 a.m. Monday morning. \\"Celebrities, politicians, and tourists\\" often arrived in the early morning hours after the clubs on the white side of town had closed, and white performers such as Frank Sinatra, Milton Berle, and Lenny Bruce would go up on stage. Top-name black musicians also dropped by \\"to jam and develop their skills\\". Musician Kelly Swaggerty, who was with Tadd Dameron's band at the time, remembered a jam session with Clifford Brown, Art Farmer and Joe Gordon that began at the Paradise Club and was continued at Club Harlem as the musicians wanted to continue playing. Long time Atlantic City disc jockey Pinky Kravitz recalled that by 3 a.m., there were up to 1,000 people in line, waiting for the breakfast show to begin. In addition to the show itself, any celebrities sitting in the audience were called up to the stage and would perform. Drummer Chris Columbo, who conducted the club's orchestra for 34 years, remembered that the early morning shows were the most vibrant because the other clubs in town were closed and many of those who were appearing at them were now at Club Harlem jamming with the club's musicians. Johnny Lynch was in charge of the house band of 14 musicians, which was integrated. The band was well regarded among musicians. It was said that if you were in the Club Harlem band for the summer, you were a fine musician. Young men who wanted to become professionals often quit their regular jobs in summer to play with the Lynch band. The leading black entertainers of the day appeared at Club Harlem, including comedians Dick Gregory, George Kirby, Moms Mabley, and Slappy White; singers Cab Calloway, Billy Daniels, Billy Eckstine, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Lena Horne, Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, and Ethel Waters; and jazz musicians Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Nat King Cole, Wild Bill Davis, and Duke Ellington. Daniels first performed his signature song \\"That Old Black Magic\\" at Club Harlem in 1942. Guitarist Pat Martino has stated that as a younger man he would play at Smalls Paradise in New York City for six months and then perform in the summer at the Club Harlem. Racism, however, prohibited many of these performers from appearing at clubs on the south side of town, where white families lived. However, in the 1950s Frank Sinatra came from the 500 Club to Club Harlem to perform with Sammy Davis, Jr., and sang with Davis, a member of the Rat Pack, back at the 500 Club. Lonnie Smith recorded a live album, Move Your Hand, at Club Harlem in 1969. Even in its waning years in the 1970s, Club Harlem continued to attract contemporary black stars such as Harry Belafonte, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Redd Foxx, Marvin Gaye, Leslie Uggams, and Dionne Warwick. The shows at the club were choreographed by Larry Steele for many years, along with those of the nearby Paradise Club, and often featured \\"comedians dressed like clowns, plantation hands, and frumpy old ladies [telling] dirty jokes to start things off\\". A full chorus line called the Sepia Revue featured 12 showgirls dressed in \\"black high heels, skimpy, sequined dresses, long boas and feathered headgear\\" dancing with more and more abandon as the \\"red hot\\" house band backed them up. Another chorus line called Beige Beauties also performed artistic dance numbers. There was no applause at the club. Guests found long wooden sticks with wooden balls at the end called \\"table knockers\\" at their tables. Patrons were to hit the table with their knockers to indicate their appreciation of performances. Not long after its closing, Alten, an owner of the club for 35 years, reminisced about the performers who brought the most guests to the club. He named Gladys Knight & the Pips and Sam Cooke as the two acts who brought the most business into Club Harlem. Alten said the club prevented fights when Sam Cooke performed there by using \\"Sold Out\\" signs which got people to leave without trying to fight to get into the performances. In the offseason, the club accommodated community fundraisers and teen talent shows. Final years and demolition Club Harlem was the site of the 1972 Easter morning assassination of the Black Mafia's \\"Fat\\" Tyrone Palmer, in full view of a show audience estimated at about 600 people. Four rival operatives entered the club and one shot Palmer in the face after the featured singer, Billy Paul, finished his opening song. Palmer's bodyguard and three women were killed in the melee that ensued, and 20 people were injured. Business dropped off after that. The club went into a steep decline between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s as the introduction of casino gambling on the Atlantic City Boardwalk pulled business away from Club Harlem and other nightspots located streetside. In the winter of 1986 it was purchased by a developer for $200,000-well below its valuation of $673,000-and shuttered; it had last opened for two weeks in the summer of 1986; it was the last of Atlantic City's major golden age nightclubs still in operation. When the club closed for good, owner Alten made it clear that the closing was not due to unpaid bills; he referred to it as \\"going out with its face up\\". There had been an effort to sell the property for some years. After the sale, many people expressed a wish to save Club Harlem. Atlantic City's mayor at the time, James Usry, was among those who wanted to preserve the club and took part in a private effort to do so. In December 1992 a nor'easter struck the building, and the building was torn down. Fans retrieved the interior furnishings and vintage photographs before the demolition in the hopes of displaying them in a future museum. A historical marker on Kentucky Avenue commemorates Club Harlem. The building site is now a parking lot where the Kentucky Avenue Renaissance Festival is held each summer. Legacy The African American Heritage Museum of Southern New Jersey, founded by Ralph Hunter, and the Noyes Arts Garage at Stockton University are in possession of the mementos rescued from the club, including \\"costumes, posters, ashtrays, the neon sign\\", and a set of red padded leather double doors illustrated with full-size drawings of Pop Williams and Sammy Davis Jr. The museum has lent the artifacts to a traveling exhibition that appeared at the Atlantic City Public Library in 2010 under the name \\"A Pictorial of Club Harlem and the Way We Were\\". The collection, along with more than 100 historical photographs and newspaper articles, has also traveled to Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Newark. On Kentucky Avenue ‚Äì The Atlantic City Club Harlem Revue, created by Adam and Jeree Wade, who each performed at Club Harlem in different decades, made its New York City debut during Black History Month 2013. It plays every few months at Stage 72. The club served as one of the filming locations for the 1980 film Atlantic City.

Biography  The son of a councilor by the Accounting Chamber and brother of an adviser to Parlement, the Marquis Du Doyer served for fifteen years in the regiment of Aunis which he left to become an oratorian. He remained seven years at the Oratory and became a Jansenist and a zealous convulsionnaire then left the community with feelings that made him consider favorably by the Encyclop√©distes. He devoted himself to the study of science and neglected none, since he had studied theology at the Oratory, to chemistry and mathematics. Frequent readings he made of Bayle completed his drive to skepticism and he eventually believed nothing without mathematical evidence. He was only twenty-two when Claude Joseph Dorat had the opportunity to introduce him to mademoiselle Deligny, young actress of the Theatre fran√ßais. Du Doyer doted on her, and addressed her an epistle in verse, which was printed in the 1766 edition of the Almanach des Muses. Having married her, he composed some plays and lived to the age of 65, still in love with her and always happy, although other records indicate that they did not live in such close intimacy.

Life Schalch was born in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, in 1692. After being employed in the cannon foundry at Douai he came to England, and in August 1716 he was engaged to build the furnaces and provide the utensils for the new brass foundry at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, then called the Warren. Royal Brass Foundry at Woolwich, built 1716‚Äì1717Royal Brass Foundry John's Military History, accessed 29 July 2016. Up to that time it had been used as a depot for stores, and cannon had been proved there, but not manufactured. The only place for casting brass ordnance in England was Matthew Bagley's foundry in Moorfields. A number of people assembled there on 10 May 1716 to see some captured French guns melted down and recast; an explosion occurred in which seventeen people, including Matthew Bagley, were killed and others injured. It was in consequence of this accident that the Board of Ordnance decided on a government foundry. There is a story that Schalch, a young and unknown man, predicted this explosion, having noticed the dampness of the moulds; that after it had taken place he was advertised for, and that the selection of a site for the new foundry was left to him. He has therefore been reckoned the father of the Arsenal. However, the story is unauthenticated. On the contrary, an advertisement has been found (10 July 1716) inviting competent men to offer themselves, after the site had been chosen and the building begun. A good report of Schalch's capacity having been obtained through the British minister at Brussels, his appointment to Woolwich was confirmed in October. A warrant of the Duke of Marlborough as Master-General of the Ordnance formally nominated Schalch master-founder of His Majesty's brass foundry on 16 May 1718. He cast cannons, mortars, howitzers and machine parts. From the 1740s relations between Schalch and the Board deteriorated, because of delays and dissatisfaction with the quality of the guns. Since guns were required for the Seven Years' War (from 1754), Schalch was not dismissed. The Board continued to criticise Schalch's slowness during the 1760s. Government demands were met by two Southwark brassfounders, William Bowen and Richard Gilpin. Schalch retired in January 1770, after the Board began to employ Pieter and Jan Verbruggen. He died at the age of eighty-four, and was buried in Woolwich churchyard. The Gentleman's Magazine records his death as Andrew Schutch (sic), esq., at Greenwich on 5 February 1776.

It was one of two major black jazz clubs in Atlantic City during its heyday from the 1920s through 1950s, the other being Club Harlem. Entertaining a predominantly white clientele, it was known for its raucous floor shows featuring gyrating black dancers accompanied by high-energy jazz bands led by the likes of Count Basie, Jimmie Lunceford, and Lucky Millinder. In 1954 the Paradise Club merged with Club Harlem under joint ownership. History Opened in the 1920s, the Paradise Club was owned by Harold Paul Abrams, who also owned Harold's Club and the Basin Street Club. Abrams was also the general manager of the 500 Club. Abrams promoted the Paradise as \\"the oldest nightclub in America\\". It was the first club to offer \\"breakfast shows\\" after the nightlong entertainment. Willis notes that most of the white clientele came from the Traymore Hotel, a summer resort. While it was fine for them to frequent the all-black shows at the Paradise Club, none of the black performers could use the whites-only beach at the Traymore. Blacks in the racially segregated city were restricted to one section of the beach, but were able to enter attractions on the entire Boardwalk. During the 1946 off-season the club opened the Paradise Swing Room, a musical bar. In May 1954 the Paradise Club announced its merger with Club Harlem. Clifton Williams and Ben Alten of Club Harlem became co-owners with Abrams. With the merger, the elaborate Smart Affairs revue presented by Larry Steele at Club Harlem began appearing at the Paradise Club as well. Like other nightclubs in the district, the Paradise Club succumbed to a drop-off in business from the advent of legalized casino gambling in Atlantic City. By the mid-1980s, only Club Harlem was still operating. The site of the club is now a parking lot. Architecture and interior The club's nondescript exterior and \\"simple neon sign\\" revealed nothing of the raucous goings-on within. The interior was designed like \\"a Prohibition-era roadhouse\\" with darkened rooms, low ceilings, and small tables arranged around the dance floor and stage. During the stage shows, while, amber, and blue colored spotlights played around the room. A girl in a short skirt walked around taking souvenir pictures of the guests. Shows The stage shows opened with singers warming up the crowd with \\"risqu√© vaudeville tunes\\" and comedians dressed in \\"overalls and straw hats [who] told raunchy jokes\\". These were followed by a troupe of six \\"dark-skinned, full-bodied\\" women outfitted in \\"top hats, short black shorts, and tuxedo vests a size or two too small\\" performing as the Sextuplet Dancers, backed by the Count Basie band. Alternate shows featured \\"light- skinned\\" dancers in feather boas and bikinis performing in front of \\"a trio of African American drummers dressed like the natives in a Tarzan movie\\". The gyrating, hip-thrusting dancers were considered a bigger draw for the white audience than the musicians, who included future jazz greats Count Basie, Jimmie Lunceford, and Lucky Millinder. As Johnny Coles, a member of Clifford Brown's band, described it: \\"This gig was about playing the show; it wasn't about playing jazz. . . We'd get a chance to do maybe a jazz tune or two before the show started\\". However, after the last show ended, the musicians would often go over to Club Harlem to jam with their band into the early morning hours, and musicians performing at the Steel Pier would make their way to the Paradise for the same purpose. Popular acts at the Paradise Club included Salt and Pepper, a black female tap dancing duo, Dorcyee Bradley, an exotic dancer, and comedy team Stump and Stumpy. The club also featured novelty acts, such as tap dancer Peg Leg Bates, whose \\"Jet Plane\\" finale, in which he leaped over the stage, landed on his wooden leg, and then executed a series of backward hops accompanied by trumpet blasts from the band, saw his leg puncture the wooden stage floor in the early 1940s. It took half an hour to pull him out. After that, the stage floor was reinforced with metal sheeting. Cholly Atkins and Honi Coles directed a revue at the Paradise in the summer of 1941. In the 1950s Tadd Dameron arranged and conducted the music for the club's revue. Other jazz musicians who played the Paradise included Frankie Manning, Sonny Clay, and Clifford Brown. The Count Basie Orchestra had a summer residency at the club in 1947, opening on 27 June. They agreed to perform for reduced wages for the opportunity for a full summer booking. During the engagement, Basie was on a deep fishing trip and fell overboard while trying to land a fish. Club owner Abrams jumped overboard to save the musician. Illegal gambling The Paradise Club was one of four Atlantic City nightclubs raided by police in July 1940 on suspicion of illegal gambling activities. Led by the new mayor, Tom Taggert, the raiding party confiscated \\"three truckloads of gambling paraphernalia\\" and arrested 32, then shut down the Paradise Club, Club Harlem, the Wonder Gardens, and Grace's Little Belmont. The clubs were doing business as usual the day after the raid. Notes References Sources   * External links * \\"Harold P.

Malalasekera Character Pa√±ca≈õikha is the god who receives messages from the Four Heavenly Kings and their ministers regarding the deeds done in the human world. He would pass information on to MƒÅtali, who in turn informed the king of TrƒÅyastri·πÉ≈õa, ≈öakra. He is also king among the gandharvas, a status granted by ≈öakra. His lover is the female gandharva BhadrƒÅ S≈´ryavarcasƒÅ (Sanskrit; Pali: BhaddƒÅ SuriyavaccasƒÅ). His favorite instrument is the Beluvapanduvƒ´nƒÅ, a stringed instrument that originally belonged to Mara. In Mahayana sources, this is described as a lute made of beryl or lapis lazuli (Ch: ÁêâÁíÉÁê¥ or Áë†ÁíÉÂØ∂Ë£ùÁÆúÁØå). Literature Sakkapa√±ha Sutta/≈öakraparip·πõcchƒÅ S≈´tra Pa√±ca≈õikha makes his most notable appearance in the Sutra of the Questions of ≈öakra; the Sakkapa√±ha Sutta in the Pali Canon and the ≈öakraparip·πõcchƒÅ S≈´tra (Â∏ùÈáãÊâÄÂïèÁ∂ì) in the Taish≈ç Tripi·π≠aka; where his role as interlocutor becomes apparent. ≈öakra, on wishing to see the Buddha appeared with a retinue of gods in the human world above Mount Vediyaka. The light created by their glory was noticed by the residents of the local village, who assumed that the mountain had caught on fire. ≈öakra persuaded Pa√±ca≈õikha to charm the Buddha out of his meditation in order to gain his attention. Pa√±ca≈õikha obliged and went to the cave in which the Buddha was staying. He addressed him with a song about the Three Jewels and romantic love. =Pa√±ca≈õikha‚Äôs Song= ‚ÄúMy lady SuriyavaccasƒÅ, oh my Sunshine‚Äî I pay homage to your father Timbaru, through whom was born a lady so fine, to fill me with a joy I never knew. As sweet as a breeze to one who‚Äôs sweating, or when thirsty, a sweet and cooling drink, so dear is your shining beauty to me, just like the teaching is to all the saints! Like a cure when you‚Äôre struck by fever dire, or food to ease the hunger pain, come on, darling, please put out my fire, quench me like water on a flame. As elephants burning in the heat of summer, sink down in a lotus pond to rest, so cool, full of petals and of pollen‚Äî that‚Äôs how I would plunge into your breast. Like elephants bursting bonds in rutting season, beating off the pricks of lance and pikes‚Äî I just don‚Äôt understand what is the reason I‚Äôm so crazy for your shapely thighs! For you, my heart is full of passion, I‚Äôm in an altered state of mind. There is no going back, I‚Äôm just not able, I‚Äôm like a fish that‚Äôs hooked up on the line. Come on, my darling, hold me, fair of thighs! Embrace me, with your so bashful eyes! Take me in your arms, my lovely lady, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôd ever want or could desire. Ah, then my desire was such a small thing, my sweet, with your curling wavy hair; now, like to arahants an offering, it‚Äôs grown so very much from there. Whatever the merit I have forged by giving to such perfected beings‚Äî may that, my altogether gorgeous, ripen in togetherness with you. Whatever the merit I have forged in this wide open land, may that, my altogether gorgeous, ripen in togetherness with you. Absorbed, the Sakyan meditates, unified, alert, and mindful, the sage aims right at the deathless state‚Äî like me, oh my Sunshine, aiming for you! And just like the sage would be rejoicing, were he to awaken to the truth, so I‚Äôd be rejoicing, lady, were I to end up as one with you. If Sakka were to grant me just one wish, as Lord of the holy Thirty- Three, my darling, you‚Äôre the only one I‚Äôd wish for, so strong is the love I hold for you. Like a freshly blossoming sal tree is your father, my lady so wise. I pay homage to him, bowing down humbly, to he whose daughter is of such a kind.‚Äù =The Buddha's response= The Buddha praised Pa√±ca≈õikha for his ability to harmonize his voice and instrument and asked him when he composed the song. Pa√±ca≈õikha relayed the story of when he fell in love with the goddess BhaddƒÅ SuriyavaccasƒÅ shortly after the Buddha's enlightenment. Other Within Pali literature, Pa√±ca≈õikha is seen in the Pa√±casikha Sutta where he visits the Buddha and asks him why some beings attain arhatship in their present lives while others do not. The BilƒÅrakosiya JƒÅtaka states that in a past life, Ananda held the office of Pa√±ca≈õikha. He also appears in Sanskrit literature such as the AvadƒÅna≈õataka.

His work focused on the political culture of the working classes, and led him to revise a number of myths associated with the history of the Commune. His first book, The War Against Paris, 1871, analyzed the role of the French army in the suppression of the Paris Commune.

The webcomic is gag-a-day, having little overarching story and covering a large variation of topics with strong tonal shifts. Gunshow is well known for spawning the \\"This is fine\\" internet meme in 2013. The webcomic concluded in 2014, as Green moved on to other creative work. Overview Gunshow is written by KC Green, known for other webcomics such as Back, He Is A Good Boy, and Pinocchio. Green has also worked on the Adventure Time episode \\"The Thin Yellow Line\\" and published a graphic novel through Oni Press titled Graveyard Quest. Gunshow features recurring characters, but very little ongoing plot. Alex Borkowski of Heave Media stated that Gunshow defies categorization, as Green covers topics ranging from the nature of compromise to pushing one's limits to an endearing story about a crab falling in love with a lady. The webcomic has run for hundreds of pages and tends to use self-referential humor from time to time. Gunshow frequently features some longer storylines, its most ambitious piece being \\"Anime Club\\", a story about four anime fans who get kicked out of their meeting spot for watching a hentai film. KC Green ended Gunshow in late 2014, as his other webcomics and his Patreon income allowed him to move on from it. \\"This is Fine\\" A 2013 Gunshow strip titled \\"On Fire\\" features an anthropomorphic dog (dubbed \\"Question Hound\\") drinking tea in a room that is burning down. Despite its own body catching fire and beginning to melt, the dog remains perfectly calm throughout the six-panel strip, saying lines such as \\"That's okay, things are going to be okay.\\" The first two panels of the strip, featuring the dog simply sitting in the blazing room saying \\"this is fine\\" became a popular internet meme. The dog's demeanor, described as \\"somewhere between bemused acceptance and outright denial\\" by Slate Magazines Jacob Brogan, proved popular with its full context removed. The sentence \\"this is fine\\" was described by The Verges Chris Plante as a \\"shorthand for when a situation becomes so terrible our brains refuse to grapple with its severity\\". The spread of the two panels was traced back by the Know Your Meme community to September 2014, when the image appeared without attribution on Reddit and Imgur with the caption \\"Basically how I‚Äôm handling life right now\\". The meme has been used on social media as a general comment on bad events or disasters, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Green described the meme's popularity in 2016 as \\"a barometer of current trends\\", indicating that it was an intense year. Brogan stated that the meme is unique because it is infrequently modified from its original version and because its popularity is still climbing. In an interview, KC Green stated that during the period in which he created \\"On Fire\\" he was struggling with himself and getting his anti- depressant dosage right. As the image's popularity surged, Green started selling prints and shirts of the strip on his TopatoCo storefront. Green noted that \\"It's easier to sell the first two [panels] than the entire [comic] where the dog melts into nothingness.\\" In 2016 Green followed up the \\"On Fire\\" comic with a \\"This is Not Fine\\" comic on The Nib, in which the dog abruptly switches from denial of the fire to terror over it, putting it out in a panic while yelling at themselves for letting the fire go so far out of control. Usage in politics In July 2016, the United States Republican Party (or GOP, short for \\"Grand Old Party\\") used the \\"This is fine\\" meme in a Twitter message, adding the text \\"Well ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø #DemsInPhilly #EnoughClinton\\", referring to the Democratic Party selecting Hillary Clinton as their presidential candidate during the 2016 Democratic National Convention. The usage of the meme suggested that Democratic voters were in denial about damage being done by selecting Clinton as candidate, though it may also be that the GOP was simply celebrating what they saw as a \\"Democratic meltdown\\". Green had already anticipated the usage of his webcomic strip for political purposes. First Look Media's webcomic The Nib commissioned Green before the Democratic National Convention to draw a version of the \\"This is fine\\" meme featuring the GOP elephant mascot similarly sitting in a flaming room. The artwork was commissioned to be placed in the Philadelphia Art Gallery in Old City. Once the GOP posted the Twitter message, The Nib responded with \\"We actually paid the artist who made this. Here's what he came up with\\" and a hyperlink to the cartoon. Usage of the meme by the GOP drew backlash from some Democratic voters, webcomic creators, and also from KC Green himself, who criticized the GOP for using his webcomic panels to accomplish their commentary, saying that \\"everyone is in their right to use this is fine on social media posts, but man o man I personally would like @GOP to delete their stupid post.\\" Vox Media compared Green's experience with that of various musicians that had their works appropriated for political purposes, and The New York Observer used the event as an example of how the works of webcomic artists are frequently reposted without proper attribution. Media In January 2016, Jason DeMarco, vice president and creative director of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block, announced that there would be an animated series based on Green's webcomic. The series, animated by Shmorky, was teased by an animated version of the \\"On Fire\\" strip voiced by Dana Snyder.

It derives its shape from originally being built to serve several different purposes; apart from a place of worship, it also served a defensive purpose, i.e. it was a fortified church. The church has been altered successively throughout the centuries. The church porch is not original though it may date from the Middle Ages. The large wooden spire was built in 1666, and a burial chapel for the Spens family was built in 1660. The burial chapel has served as the sacristy since 1810. Among the furnishings, the baptismal font is the oldest and dates from the 13th century. The altarpiece was donated to the church in 1748, while the pulpit was made in 1709. The church has two church bells, the larger of them was made in 1526. The vaults supporting the church ceiling were probably built at the end of the Middle Ages.

It was owned and operated by the Plane Creek Central Mill Company Limited. It was funded with a loan of ¬£65,000 from the Queensland Government under the Sugar Works Guarantee Act. The mill machinery was built by Walkers Limited in Maryborough. A 15-mile tramline connected the mill to a wharf at the mouth of Louisa Creek () for shipping the sugar. The loan from the Queensland Government was fully repaid in 1920. In 1925, a factory was built next to the mill to process the molasses produced by the sugar refining into ethanol. Ted Theodore, the Queensland Premier, hoped to use the ethanol as a motor fuel. In 1926, a wier was built on Plane Creek to provide a more reliable water supply to the mill, with a second weir built in 1935. Sugar cane fields east of Flaggy Rock, 2016 In the 1920s, construction of the North Coast railway line enabled sugar cane to be transported to the mill from a more widespread area, as far south as Flaggy Rock. In 1874 it was sold to Pioneer Sugar Mills and then sold in 1987 by CSR Limited. As of 2016, it is one of the 8 sugar mills in Queensland owned by Wilmar Sugar.

Life He was born in Lyon on 31 January 1814, the son of a manufacturer of silk cloth. He learned the artistic aspects of the silk trade from his father and attended the School of Fine Arts in lyon between 1827 and 1833, studying painting and life drawing. In 1835 he moved to Paris to continue his training in the studio of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. He then attended Fr√©d√©ric Ozanam's college within the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, which advocated Catholic libertarian values (which were condemned by the Pope). This period was inspirational for Fr√©net and inspired his later religious works. Following the closure of Ingres' workshop, Fr√©net, with his friends Louis Janmot and Claudius Lavergne, undertook a study trip to Italy to visit Ingres, where the latter had become Director of the French Academy in Rome. A small colony from Lyon, also including Hippolyte Flandrin, centred around Ingres in the Villa Medici: they drew and painted the Roman monuments. In 1837 Fr√©net visited Florence and then left Italy. Back in Lyon, Fr√©net made his first public exhibition at the 1837 Exhibition, which consisted of works brought back from Italy. In 1840 he made a second trip to Italy and again exhibited his work on his return to France. He thereafter became a recognized member of the School of Lyon. However, art critics were not always kind to him. Failing to win any prizes in Paris, where he exhibited at the Salon in 1841, he decided to relocate to the village of Charly, near Lyon, where he had bought a house. He continued his work, mostly choosing religious subjects. He painted frescoes and designed stained glass for the Saint-Louis-de-la- Guilloti√®re church in Charly. Following the Revolution of 1848, he became involved in municipal politics and was elected Mayor of Charly. He then applied to become a professor at the School of Fine Arts in Lyon, supported by Ingres, but was unsuccessful. His range then diversified to include printmaking, sculpture, and the new field of photography. From 1850 he worked on a large fresco project for the Church of St. Martin in Ainay, but unfortunately moisture caused his work to deteriorate and his sponsors refused to pay. The work was ultimately destroyed. Embittered, Fr√©net didn't produce anything else before his death on 12 August 1889. Photography Around 1850 Fr√©net, met some photography pioneers in Lyon, and used photography to record his unsuccessful frescoes at Ainay. From this time, he becomes passionate about this new medium, and this mentally diverts him from the setbacks with his painting. Fr√©net applies to out of decision stereotypical views of the time involving heavy stagings, and is one of the first to practice the instant, the familiar and intimate subject. Five years before Nadar , it produces psychological portraits and engages in close-up.

He was the eldest son of a Presbyterian minister but was adopted by his maternal uncle, Joseph Taylor, who was an army doctor. Taylor offered to fund Houston's education and on 13 January 1819 Houston moved to Dublin as apprentice to John Shekleton, a surgeon and curator at the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI). Houston completed his apprenticeship in 1824, passing his final examinations and receiving his letters testimonial. On 19 June 1826, he was elected a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland days after the sudden death of his mentor Shekleton. Houston graduated from Edinburgh with a Doctor of Medicine degree in 1826. Career Houston succeeded Shekleton as conservator (curator) at the RCSI museum. In 1830, Houston discovered the transverse folds of the rectum, eponymously known as Houston's valves. In 1834, he published a catalogue of the Museum's normal specimens, followed by a catalogue of pathology specimens in 1840. In 1843, he published a catalogue of the museum specimens at the Park Street School of Medicine. In 1844, Houston published an illustrated scientific paper in the Dublin Medical Press entitled \\"On the Microscopic Pathology of Cancer (with a Woodcut)\\" and is credited with introducing the microscope to Irish medicine. RCSI paid him ¬£150 for his preparation of anatomical specimens. During his 17-year tenure as curator, Houston expanded and catalogued the RCSI museum's extensive specimen collection, described as \\"one of the most valuable in Europe\\" by renowned anatomists Friedrich Tiedemann and Jules Germain Cloquet.http://rcsiheritage.blogspot.ie/2014/05/skeletons-specimens-and- shekleton.htmlhttps://archive.org/stream/b21443348/b21443348_djvu.txt Houston had a keen interest in teaching, working as an anatomy demonstrator at RCSI in 1824 and in 1837 taking a position as lecturer in surgery at the Park Street School of Medicine.The Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science August 1846, Volume 2, Issue 1, p 294.

He was also appointed consultant surgeon at St. Peter's Dispensary, a corresponding member of the Institute of Washington, and a member of the Society of Naturalists and Physicians of Heidelberg. He held private practice on York Street near RCSI. Houston was a member of the Royal Irish Academy.

It naturally occurs on Corsica, Sardinia, on the Ionian islands and in western Greece. It has hairless green to purple stems, and the lower leaves consist mostly of nine leaflets with undersides which may carry felty hairs or are hairless. Its flowers have pink petals and purple filaments. Its vernacular name in Italian is peonia Corsa, and in French pivoine de Corse, both meaning \\"Corsican peony\\".  Description  The Corsican peony is a diploid species (2n=10). It is a perennial herbaceous photosynthesising plant, which dies down in the autumn and reappears above the surface in spring. It flowers in April and May. Fruits may open from August onwards.  Root, stem and leaves  This peony has grey to brown roots shaped like carrots, about in diameter near the attachment of the stems and gradually becoming narrower towards their tips. It has stiff, erect, hairless, green to purple stems of high with five to seven scales at their base. The leaves have green to purple stalks which are hairless or carry soft hairs. The lower leaves further consist of three sets of mostly three rarely incised ovate to elliptic leaflets, each long and wide. These have a wedged to round base, an entire margin, a pointy tip, a hairless upper surface and a variously but mostly densely softly-hairy undersurface.  Flower, fruit and seed  Each stem may carry a single hermaphrodite flower that may be subtended by none or up to three leaflet-like bracts that may form a kind of involucre. The mostly two to five (occasionally as little as one or as much as eight) roundish sepals are unequal in size and vary in color from green to purple. These encircle seven or eight rose-colored inverted egg-shaped petals. Within are many stamens consisting of purple filaments and yellow anthers. A wavy disk of high with a toothed margin encircles the base of mostly two to five (rarely one or as much as eight) green, red or purple carpels. These are mostly covered in goldenbrown curving hairs of about 1¬Ω mm (0.06 in) long, but sometimes hairless. The carpels are widest above midlength and 1¬Ω-3 mm (0.06-0.12 in) long styles on top connect them with the red stigmas. Seeds are black when ripe, round in diameter, and 7√ó5¬Ω mm (0.22 √ó 0.28 in) in size. Seed development is quickened by warmth and arrested by cold. There is approximately a three-month delay between the initial development of the root and that of the earliest part of the stem (or hypocotyl). These responses to temperature make sure seedlings occur above ground at the most favorable time of the year.  Differences with related species  Paeonia cambessedesii currently in the wild limited to Majorca, also has pink flowers and mostly no more than nine leaflets per leaf and is a diploid. But it is entirely hairless, with the main veins and the underside of the leaves remaining purple throughout the season, the upperside greyish, and usually has four to eight carpels per flower, while P. corsica when fully developed has green leaflets, mostly hairy underneath, and two to five carpels per flower. Paeonia coriacea, restricted to Andalucia and Morocco, is a tetraploid, has magenta flowers, is entirely hairless, mostly has ten to fifteen roundish leaflets per leaf, and one or two hairless carpels per flower. P. corsica has pink flowers, ovate leaflets which are mostly hairy below, and one to five mostly softly hairy carpels per flower. Paeonia mascula, is known from northern Spain, France but not Corsica, through Italy including Sicily but excluding Sardinia, Greece excluding the Ionian isles and the adjoining mainland coast, and eastward to Lebanon and Iraq. It is a tetraploid that differs from P. corsica by its often white, or white with pink, (but in the east of its distribution pink or magenta) flowers, long light yellow straight bristly hairs on its carpels and mostly more than nine leaflets per leaf.  Taxonomy   Taxonomic history  Franz Sieber described an almost hairless peony from Corsica in 1828 and named it Paeonia corsica. In 1837 Giuseppe Moris described a form from Sardinia and Corsica that differed in having a covering of soft hairs on the underside of the leaflets and on the carpels, calling it P. corallina var. pubescens. Without appearing aware of Sieber's publication, Ernest Cosson described the glabrous peony in 1850 as P. corallina var. leiocarpa, but he corrected this in 1887 by renaming it as P. corallina var. corsica. In the same publication he dealt with Moris's hairy form as a synonym of P. corallina var. russoi, thinking it was identical to P. russoi described from Sicily by Antonino de Bivona-Bernardi in 1816, and followed Webb (1838) by reducing the status of the taxon. This was supported by Ernst Huth in 1891. In 1875, Heinrich Moritz Willkomm thought P. corsica a junior synonym of P. corallina var. cambessedesii (now P. cambessedesii). In 1893, Georges Rouy and Julien Foucaud reduced the status of the hairless taxon to P. corallina f. corsica, and distinguished two additional forms with hairy carpels, f. ovalifolia - with variable indumentum on the leaflets - and f. triternata - with consistently pubescent undersides of the leaflets -. Adriano Fiori in 1898 regarded P. corallina a subspecies of P. mascula and thus named the taxon P. mascula subsp. corallina var. corsica. Max G√ºrke simplified this in 1903 to P. mascula var. corsica. In 1899 Antoine Legrand described a form with hairless carpels but hairy undersides of the leaflets and called it P. russoi var. reverchoni. Claude Jordan described two new types from Corsica in 1903, one with leaflets with red veins and softly haired undersides, and hairy carpels, he called P. revelieri, and one with hairless leaflets and softly haired carpels, he named P. glabrescens. John Isaac Briquet distinguished a further glabrous taxon, P. corallina var. pubescens f. hypoleuca. Ascherson and Paul Graebner in 1923 regarded P. corallina var. leiocarpa and P. cambessedesii as synonyms of P. corallina var. corsica. F.C. Stern treated this taxon in 1946 as a synonym of P. russoi var. leiocarpa. Zangheri, Sandro Pignatti and Schmitt thought P. corsica synonymous to P. coriacea in 1976, 1982 and 1997 respectively. Dimitris Tzanoudakis distinguished in 1977 three subspecies of P. mascula in Greece, among which P. mascula subsp. russoi from the Ionian islands and the corresponding mainland coastal area he regarded identical to Bivona's taxon. In 2001 Cesca found a form from Sardinia with purplish stems and long hairs on the leaflets' undersurfaces he regarded sufficiently different to create a new species, P. morisii, and it was recognised by Passalaqua and Bernardo in 2004, who also extended the range of P. mascula subsp. russoi to include Calabria. Most recent authors thought P. mascula subsp. russoi described from Sicily also is present on Sardina and Corsica.  Modern classification  Specimens from Corsica, Sardinia and the Ionian isles were all shown to be diploids with ten chromosomes (2n=10), mostly have nine leaflets in the lower leaves, which often have rather hairy undersides with soft curved golden brown hairs of about 1¬Ω mm (0.06 in) long on the carpels, although hairlessness also occurs. The sampled populations from Sicily and Euboea however are all tetraploids (4n=20), mostly with ten to twenty leaflets in the basal leaves, not or sparsely hairy, while the light yellow hairs on the carpels are straight and rather bristly (or hispid) and about long. The peonies of Corsica, Sardinia, the Ionian isles and the adjoining mainland coast are therefore considered conspecific, and should be named P. corsica, while the Sicilian, Calabrian and some of the Greek populations belong to P. mascula.  Distribution and habitat  P. corsica naturally occurs on Corsica, Sardinia and in Greece on the Ionian islands Cephalonia, Lefkada and Zakynthos, and mainland Aetolia-Acarnania. It grows in pine and oak dominated forests, in maquis shrubland and on grassy places on various soils and bedrock (such as limestone, granite and metamorphic).  Cultivation  This species has recently sparsely become available for gardeners. It is praised as a rather low peony, with shiny purple tinged young foliage, that is regarded suitable for sunny rock gardens. It is advised to guard against moisture during the summer.

She is a leader of international teams studying study ecosystems under the ice. Early life and education Mikucki earned her B.A. in 1996 at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, her M.S. in 2001 from Portland State University, and her Ph.D in 2005 at Montana State University. A life-long love of cold and snow helped lead her to a career in Antarctic research. Mikucki conducted her Ph.D research on Blood Falls, a plume of iron-oxide rich water that flows from beneath the Taylor Glacier in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. Mikucki's work on Blood Falls was the first to describe the microbiology and geochemistry of the feature. Career and impact Schematic of drilling to find the brine Mikucki with brine sample As a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University (2006‚Äì07) and Dartmouth College (2008), and a professor at the University of Tennessee, Mikucki continued her work at Blood Falls. Mikucki's work demonstrated that microbes can grow below ice in the absence of sunlight by using sulfate and iron to help them metabolize organic matter. Her continuing work at Blood Falls led to the discovery of a network of salty groundwater beneath Antarctica's McMurdo Dry Valleys, which is likely the source of the Blood Falls outflow, and a habitat for subsurface microorganisms. The work was also the first ever use of airborne resistivity in Antarctica. Mikucki was part of the first team to drill into and sample an Antarctic subglacial lake, which demonstrated the existence of life deep beneath Antarctic ice for the first time.

Built in 1793, it was the home of Joseph Marsh, one of Hartford's early settlers and the first Lieutenant Governor of Vermont. Now the Quechee Inn, the property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Description and history The Marsh House farmstead stands on the north side of Quechee Main Street, near a point where the Ottauquechee River, just across the street, bends south with Dewey's Pond just to the east. The complex includes the main house, three barns, and a wagon shed/hen house. The main house faces south, and consists of a 2-1/2 story main block with a series of ells extending to the rear. The house has modest vernacular Federal styling, with a recessed entry flanked by sidelight windows. The recess opening is framed by pilasters with a crown pediment above. The interior has a typical Georgian center hall plan, and retains many original finishes and hardware fixtures. To the north of the house is a large cow barn, dating to the 1870s, to which a smaller horse barn has been joined at one corner; these buildings have been adapted as facilities of the inn that now occupies the property. To the west of this pair stand a corn barn and the hen house/wagon shed. with The Marsh family was among the first to be granted land in the Quechee area after the town of Hartford was chartered in 1761. Joseph Marsh was a prominent local citizen, leading a regiment of colonial militia in the American Revolutionary War, and serving on the committee that drafted the constitution of the independent Vermont Republic in 1777. He then served as lieutenant governor under Thomas Chittenden. He built this house in 1793. It was originally located a short way east and south of its present location, the move necessitated by a local flood control project conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in the 1960s. It is here that Marsh's son Charles, a noted lawyer and father of George Perkins Marsh, was raised. John Porter, a later owner, was a prominent local businessman and politician, serving in the state legislature and on the boards of several area banks. In 1959, the property was taken by the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) and condemned as part of the North Hartland Dam flood control project. Its owners were able to recover the house and what are now the remaining outbuildings, by moving or raising them above the ACE's mandated high-water elevation. Several outbuildings that were not moved were buried under fill, and remain in situ. In 1975, the property was opened as the Quechee Inn.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. At the time of its nomination the district consisted of 82 resources, including 74 contributing buildings, seven noncontributing buildings, and one noncontributing object. The historic district covers most of the city's central business district in the original town plat. Most of the buildings are two-story, brick, commercial buildings. The commercial Italianate style is dominant, with Queen Anne, Romanesque Revival, and Neoclassical styles included. The Madison County Courthouse (1878) is a Renaissance Revival structure designed by Alfred H. Piquenard. Most of the buildings are brick construction, but four were constructed using locally quarried limestone. The stone buildings include the courthouse, the White, Munger and Company Store (1861), and the Sprague, Brown, and Knowlton Store (1866), all of which are individually listed on the National Register. The period of significance for the district is 1861 to 1965 when most of the buildings were constructed. Unlike many historic downtowns in Iowa, Winterset replaced its initial frame buildings with masonry buildings because of economic prosperity, and not because of fires. In addition to Piquenard, other architects of note who contributed buildings in the district include William Foster (Crawford/Jefferson Block, 1873; Schwaner/Centennial Block, 1876), L.W. Foster (Madisonian Building, 1872; City Hall Block/Jones & Tidrick, 1875), Joseph S. Blake (Firemen's Hall/City Hall/Light Plant, 1888, 1889, 1923), Frank E.

He is a domestic short-haired cat, who, at eighteen months old, assumed the position of Chief Mouser in late June 2016. Gladstone's political namesake is former Chancellor and Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone who served for four separate periods, more than any other Prime Minister. The hope is Gladstone will control mice at the Treasury's 1 Horse Guards Road building. The inception of the position of Chief Mouser at the Treasury follows the creation of similar positions at Number 10 and the Foreign Office, with those positions being held by Larry and Palmerston, as of July 2016. The decision to introduce an official mouser was taken by John Kingman, former acting Permanent Secretary at the Treasury. The appointment of Gladstone as \\"Chief Mouser to the Treasury\\" was officially announced on 29 July 2016. Gladstone was taken to his new home at the Treasury in late June 2016, but the fallout from the referendum on European Union membership delayed the public announcement until late July. Life before the Treasury Chancellor Sajid Javid and Gladstone. Gladstone was brought in by a staff member of Battersea Dogs & Cats Home Lost and Found team in May 2016 as a neglected stray, after trying to get into his cat flap for a few weeks. He had been wandering the streets of London, hungry, and without a microchip, meaning his owners could not be located. At Battersea, he was known as Timmy. Like many homeless cats without access to daily food and water, he would eat too much, too quickly. A special activity puzzle feeder remedied this issue. Work as Chief Mouser Video of Gladstone's view inside the HM Treasury Within 48 hours of moving in, Gladstone made his first catch. Described as \\"a cold-blooded killer\\" he went on to register six catches in his first three months in office. Food for Gladstone is taken care of by Treasury staff, who volunteer the modest sums required for his daily needs. At weekends, the Treasury's facilities and security team look after his domestic needs and personal protection. His employment is at no cost to taxpayers. Recognition as Treasury's Chief Mouser Gladstone sitting on a table on 2018 Christmas Eve On 28 July 2017 Gladstone celebrated his first anniversary at HM Treasury. A few days after his debut on Instagram in July 2016, he had 1,200 followers. 103 picture posts later, currently the number is over 10,000. 'A cat's life ‚Äì after a year in the spotlight, Gladstone sets the record straight', details his life at the Treasury. To date, Gladstone's number of mice caught is 22. In popular culture Gladstone has a social media presence on an official Instagram page, and has been reported on by media outlets as far away as Northern Ireland. A parody account @TreasuryMog, also exists on Twitter. He often receives trinkets such as cat toys, Christmas baubles from Brazil, a personalised collar, and a Halloween handmade knitted scarf from Australia. He appeared on the Treasury's official YouTube site, in 'Where's Gladstone Gone?', for 2016's Open House London, which also appeared on Sky News. In March 2017, Gladstone was featured in the London Time Out magazine's 'Pet Power List: definitive guide to the political animals of Westminster'.

Deputy leader and Shadow Treasurer Simon Crean was elected unopposed as Beazley's replacement, thus becoming Leader of the Opposition. Beazley, the party's leader since 1996, announced his resignation on the night of 10 November 2001, when it became clear that his party had lost the election to John Howard's Coalition. The following day, Crean announced that he would contest the leadership. Shadow Health Minister Jenny Macklin, Shadow Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner, Shadow Industry Minister Carmen Lawrence, and Manager of Opposition Business Bob McMullan were also seen as possible contenders. On 12 November, Macklin announced her intention to stand for the deputy leadership. She and Crean were reported to be running as a ticket, representing the Labor Left and Labor Right factions, respectively. No other MPs declared themselves candidates for either position over the following week, and Crean and Macklin were consequently elected unopposed when the Labor caucus met on 22 November.

She has mediated the history of the Vikings for most of her life, including coordination of notable exhibitions on the Viking Age and authoring several books on the subject. Roesdahl's books have been translated into several languages. Her popular book The Vikings was first published in English in 1991. Biography Born in S√∏nderborg in southern Jutland, Roesdahl is the daughter of two medical doctors, Harald Eyvind Roesdahl and his wife Helene Refslund Thomsen. She and her siblings were brought up in a home where education had a high priority. After matriculating from S√∏nderborg Statsskole in 1960, she studied history and archaeology at Copenhagen University, graduating in 1969. In 1970, she joined Aarhus University where she became a tenured lecturer in the newly formed Medieval Archaeology department in 1981 and ultimately a professor in 1996. Her first major work, Fyrkat : en jysk vikingeborg (1977) was on the Viking fortress at Fyrkat near Hobro in the north of Jutland, which she investigated together with Olaf Olsen. She went on to study other Viking fortifications, publishing her best seller Danmarks vikingetid in 1980, translated into English as Viking age Denmark (1982). Even more popular was her Vikingernes verden (1987), published in English as The Vikings in 1991. Roesdahl has also written many articles on the Vikings and the Middle Ages as well as a short book on the disappearance of Norsemen in Greenland titled Hvalrostand, elfenben og nordboere i Gr√∏nland (1995). Roesdahl has also played a major role in coordinating exhibitions on the Vikings, including Vikingerne i England og hjemme i Danmark (The Vikings in England and their Danish homeland, 1981) also featured in York, England, and Viking og Hvidekrist (From Viking to Crusader, 1992) which travelled to Paris and Berlin before returning permanently to Copenhagen's National Museum of Denmark. Now retired, Roesdahl still takes an active interest in Viking sites, opening the Fyrkat Viking Games in May 2016 and celebrating their 30th anniversary. Awards In 1988, Roesdahl received the S√∏ren Gyldendal Prize, a literary award, and was later honoured as a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog in 1992. In 1995, she was given an honorary doctorate by Trinity College, Dublin.

It includes some of the town's oldest buildings, and is where the founder of the town, Jacob Bayley, first settled and later died. The district is oriented along Oxbow Road west of United States Route 5 and north of the town's main village. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The town of Newbury was chartered in 1763, and was the first European settlement north of Charlestown, New Hampshire on the Connecticut River. Among its founders was Jacob Bayley, who rose to prominence as a local militia general, and as one of the driving forces behind the creation of the Bayley Hazen Military Road during the American Revolutionary War. The area where he settled is near a U-shaped meander in the river (named because of its resemblance to an oxbow, where the river's flood plain is particularly broad and fertile. While Bayley's house does not survive, that of his son does (on the north side of Oxbow Road, built c. 1785), and it is where he died in 1815. with The district is located about one mile north of the present village center of Newbury, at a point where US 5 bends from a north-south orientation to the northeast. Oxbow Road extends westward at this point, creating a triangular junction. The district extends westward from this junction to another triangular junction, where it bends south and Romance Lane continues further west. The district includes twelve houses, most dating to the 19th century, and a district schoolhouse, acquired in 1912 by the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Most of the houses display architectural styling from the mid-to-late 19th century, although some, like the Bayley house, retain a Federal appearance. The Augustine/Kelley House, located near the corner of Romance and Oxbow, is a particularly fine example of Italianate architecture.

In most parts of Nigeria, women are considered subordinate to their male counterparts, especially in Northern Nigeria. It is generally believed that women are best suited as home keepers. Feminism had not appeared in Nigeria until roughly 40 years ago. This has been attributed to Funmilayo Ransome- Kuti. She was born in Nigeria, and was educated through the British schooling system. She supported and fought for women's rights, as well as for women having a larger impact in the Nigerian government. She was a part of the WIDF (Women's International Democratic Federation), which helped more women to gain government positions, furthering what she wished to accomplish with women in Nigeria. Ransome-Kuti died in 1978. One of Nigeria's well-known newspapers referred to her as \\"a progressive revolutionary\\" and \\"a Pan-African visionary.\\"Johnson-Odim, Cheryl. \\"'For Their Freedoms': The Anti-imperialist and International Feminist Activity of Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti of Nigeria.\\" ScienceDirect.

Among the most known are Federation of Nigerian Women's Societies (FNWS), Women in Nigeria (WIN), Kudirat Initiative for Democracy (KIND) and Female in Nigeria (FIN). Still, most of them have failed to bring about significant political, social or economic growth. Though not without protest, new feminist movements and gender awareness are forming in Nigeria.

Her debut poetry collection, Look, was a finalist for the 2016 National Book Award. She currently lives in Oakland, California, and is a Jones Lecturer at Stanford University.  Early life and education  Sharif was born in Istanbul, Turkey as her parents were in the process of immigrating from Iran to the United States; her parents had studied in the US during the 1970s but had returned to Iran during the Iranian Revolution. Newborn Sharif and her family settled first in Texas, where her father finished his studies; the family moved again a few years later to Birmingham, Alabama, where her mother finished her bachelor's degree. After her mother graduated the family finally settled in Los Angeles, California, when Sharif was 11 years old. While living in Los Angeles, Sharif was exposed to the largest Iranian population outside of Iran itself, but was ostracized by her Iranian peers upon her arrival because of her family's struggle assimilating. At sixteen years old, Sharif attended an Iranian Feminist Conference, facilitated by Angela Davis. Here, she discovered the phrase and label \\"women of color\\", from which Davis referred to the audience of women before her. This label was a punctum moment for Sharif, as this is the phrase that she had been searching for to identify with, and to embrace. Wherever she went, she felt out of place. She never felt as though she was included or acknowledged by those around her. This feeling of exile is one of the bigger influences of her \\"exilic intellectual\\" prose- looking at something from the outside and to \\"question and interrogate\\" works of art or literature. Sharif received her BA degree from the University of California, Berkeley, and her MFA degree from New York University.  Career  She currently serves as a lecturer at Stanford University. In 2011, Sharif was awarded the \\"Discovery\\"/Boston Review Poetry Prize. Sharif received a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 2013. She has also received fellowships from the Fine Arts Work Center, Stanford University, and the Poetry Foundation. Sharif won the Theodore H. Holmes '51 and Bernice Holmes National Poetry Prize. She received a scholarship from the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference. Her book Look was a finalist for the 2016 National Book Award for Poetry, a finalist for the 2017 PEN Open Book Award, one of The New York Times Book Review's 100 Notable Books of 2016, a Publishers Weekly Best Book of 2016, a Washington Post Best Poetry Collection of 2016, one of The New Yorker's Books We Loved in 2016, and one of the San Francisco Chronicle's 100 Recommended Books of 2016. Look, Sharif's first book, \\"asks us to see the ongoing costs of war as the unbearable losses of human lives and also the insidious abuses against our everyday speech.\\" Look draws on the U.S. Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, and challenges readers to confront the war's effects on language.  Influences  Some early influences include poems by Walt Whitman, which her mother would read to her as bedtime stories. While studying at UC Berkeley, she was part of the People for Poetry program and studied June Jordan's works. More current influences include Audre Lorde's essay, \\"Uses of Erotics: Erotics as Power,\\" Hannah Weiner's Code Poems, Muriel Rukeyser's The Book of the Dead, Martha Collins Blue Front, and M.

Empowerment is the development of women in term of politics, social and economic strength in nation development. It is also a way of reducing women's vulnerability and dependency in all spheres of life. It can be noted that the aggregate of educational, political, health and legal empowerment are key to women's empowerment in Nigeria. Like many African women, Nigerian women have a subordinate role to their male counterparts. There are twice as many women below the poverty line than men, and up to 19 times as many men in executive positions than women. Social imbalances At the core of Nigeria's social imbalance is a distorted power dynamic in determining family size. This male centered focus points to a critical population problem. Women are eliminated from the decision making process of how many children they are going to have and when they are to have them. There are very few population control guides that targets men to reduce the high fertility rate. In order for anything to work as far as population control, men and women must both have equal power in the household.Frazier, Brionne, et al. ‚ÄúEmpowering Nigerian Women.‚Äù Brown Political Review, 2 May 2016, www.brownpoliticalreview.org/2016/04/empowering- nigerian-women/. There are imbalances within marriage, religious and government institutions and access to good health program. The United Nations, as well as a majority of nations across the globe, have developed and organized programs which aim to ameliorate gender inequalities. Women's development was adopted as the third millennium goal in 2000,the world conference on women in Benjin in 2000, and many others. Political and Financial Constraints Women are nearly non-existent on the Nigerian political scene, more so at the federal and state levels. Male domination of decision-making and violence has led to women not feeling free and comfortable enough to engage in political matters. Additionally, successful political advisors are not likely to support female candidates so it could be difficult for them to pave a path in politics.‚ÄúBrowse the Library.‚Äù Challenges Facing Women Empowerment in Contemporary Nigeria  Gender Hub, www.genderhub.org/get- in-the-know/resource-library/challenges-facing-women-empowerment-in- contemporary-nigeria/. There are major differentiations when it comes to starting businesses and getting credit loans for men vs. women in Nigeria. When women in business have fewer employees and shorter longevity than men, this gender gap becomes even wider. Within the countries of Tunisia and Zimbabwe, women business owners worked in time intervals throughout the day. The time involved in maintaining a business with little pay was undesirably restrictive and directly conflicted with their family responsibilities. There have been experimental techniques to expand women-led businesses in Nigeria such as advocating start-ups and productivity through grants, mentoring and business technical training. A program by the name of YouWiN! gave insight to young men and women on how to carry out their business ideas and conquer certain challenges that come with starting a business.‚ÄúThe Road to Female Economic Empowerment.‚Äù The Republic, 26 Feb. 2017, www.republic.com.ng/vol1-no1/the-road-to-female-economic-empowerment/. Indices In Nigeria, the effect of women empowerment can be measured using indices such as education, literacy rate, employment and leadership roles. Lynne Featherstone has said that \\"High rates of maternal mortality and violence against women make Nigeria one of the toughest places in the world to be born a girl\\". Government Initiative In looking to achieve the Millennium goal on women's development, the Nigerian government initiated the Women's Fund for Economic Empowerment and Business Development for women entrepreneurs, while \\"second chance\\" was meant to re-introduce dropped out women due to pregnancy back to school. At the Sixty-fourth General Assembly it was reported that \\"the number of senior female civil servants was judged to be 22.5 per cent, while judicial appointment across the 36 States constituted about 30 per cent. A national action plan on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in Nigeria was deposited with the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva in July 2009. A chapter was devoted to the rights of women and children. A National Policy on Sexual Harassment in Educational Institutions had also been put in place. Free medical treatment was provided for victims of domestic and sexual violence at temporary shelters that were being established nationwide. Nigeria was also working to improve the education of girls by recruiting more female teachers, creating skill acquisition programmes for girls and women, and providing textbooks at subsidized rates, among other measures. Judges and magistrates were continuously being trained on gender and women's rights. Health system facilities were being scaled up\\". Education Educational statistics have been used as an indicator of gender inequalities versus women's empowerment in Nigeria. The population census conducted in 1991 by the Federal Government of Nigeria found that 61% (41 million) of Nigerian women \\"suffer from intellectual poverty\\". In Africa, there are different forms of education, such as agricultural extension programmes, in-service training, out of school education, audio visual education, mass media education, vocational education, in-service personnel training, community development, cooperative education, evening classes, library services, extra-moral education and trade union education. Report shows that Nigerian women are not favored in the evolution of educational system in the country. In 1965, 37.75% of population in primary schools are girls while only 9% of undergraduates were female. By 1974, the percentage of female undergraduates increased to 25.5%. The major enrollment from girls were only in teaching and social courses. In absolute terms, there were 138,334 male and 50,652 female students in Nigeria universities during this period. The challenges faced by girls were due to the perception of the society on gender qualities.

It was built between the 1780s and early 1790s to designs attributed to Abraham Hargrave. Originally built for the merchant Hayes family, the house was named for Mount Vernon, the home of US president George Washington. Passing through several owners, the house remained largely disused and subject to deterioration from the late 20th century. In 2016 a significant fire largely gutted the house, leading to speculation as to its future. Construction and design Some sources imply that Vernon Mount was built in 1784, while others suggest it was completed after 1789 following the arrival of Abraham Hargrave in Cork. Hargrave designed a number of buildings in the city at this time, including Cork's military barracks. The house was built for and by Atwell Hayes (d.1799) a wealthy brewer and miller. Following the death of his wife, Atwell Hayes did not take up occupancy, but instead leased the estate to his son, Henry Browne Hayes (1762‚Äì1832). Browne Hayes reputedly spent significant sums on the interior of the house, including murals and other artworks by artist Nathaniel Grogan (1740‚Äì1807). Several of Grogan's works adorned doorways and other internal architectural elements, including a work depicting Minerva on a large curved ceiling. The curved elevations, staircase, oval atrium, and interior decorations made Vernon Mount, according to the Irish Georgian Society \\"unique in the history of the Irish villa and [..] a building of national importance\\". History and ownership Following the death of his own wife, Henry Browne Hayes abducted a local heiress named Mary Pike, and in 1797 reputedly forced her into a marriage ceremony at the estate. Hayes was later convicted of kidnap, but had a death sentence commuted to penal transportation to Australia. Passing through several owners, by the late 20th century the Vernon Mount estate was owned for a period by the Cork and Munster Motorcycle and Car Club. The club used the demesne for motocross and similar events. The house was sold to a private investor in the 1990s, though a planning application for redevelopment as apartments and a hotel was not successful. Today The Irish Georgian Society, World Monuments Fund, An Taisce and other stakeholder groups listed the building as a risk, and attempts were made to slow the effects of deterioration, roof damage, water issues and vandalism over a number of decades. Although in private ownership, public funds were allocated by the Department of Arts and Heritage which allowed Cork County Council to undertake roof repairs in 2012. Despite recommendations for a Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) (to bring the building into permanent state ownership and protection), a severe fire in July 2016 reduced the structure to a largely empty shell. Following the fire, there was some speculation as to the future of the house and site. In September 2016, Cork County Council voted in favour of prosecuting the owners of Vernon Mount for \\"fail[ure] to secure the protected structure\\", and to \\"convey to the owners and occupiers of all [other] protected structures the need to uphold their societal responsibility\\". , there were renewed calls to bring the site into public ownership, and to stabilise the structure with a view to preserving its shell.

Life and career  Isaac was one of three children of Lazarus Jacobs, a Jewish immigrant from Frankfort am Main, and Mary Hiscocks, from Templecombe, Somerset. Lazarus moved to Bristol in around 1760, where he began his career as an itinerant glass- cutter. He sold his wares, along with secondhand goods, at Temple Fair in Bristol. In 1774 he set up a glass manufacturing business at 108 Temple Street. Isaac joined his father's business as a partner at age seventeen. Using cobalt oxide imported by William Cookworthy from Saxony, Isaac designed and branded Bristol blue glass as it is known today. The Jacobs family were well-placed to develop Bristol blue glass: German glass engraving was highly prized, and continental Jews worked traditionally with coloured glass. Many of Isaac's glasses, signed by him, can be found in the Victoria and Albert Museum and elsewhere.  The Jacobs and Bristol Jewry  In 1786, Lazarus helped fund a new synagogue, where he was honoured by the Jewish community. At the time, the Jewish community was gradually being accepted into Gentile Bristol society.Madge Dresser and Peter Fleming, Bristol: Ethnic Minorities and the City, 1000-2001, Phillimore & Co, 2007 By the early nineteenth century, Jews were moving from 'the Jew quarter' at Temple, to St James's and Brunswick Square. When Lazarus died in 1796, Isaac took over the business, and was able to move his family to 16 Somerset Square Redcliffe, near the glass factory. As the success of Bristol Blue Glass increased, Isaac became a leading member of the Jewish community, while also adopting aspects of Gentility, reflecting the increasing balance of both worlds. Between 1809 and 1814, Isaac was made a freeman of the city of Bristol, moved to a large house he had commissioned in Weston-super-Mare, was granted a coat of arms, and became a member of the Bristol Commercial Rooms. He was making between ¬£15,000 and ¬£20,000 a year.Madge Dresser, ‚ÄòJacobs, Isaac (1757/8‚Äì1835)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 29 July 2016  The fall of Isaac Jacobs  When the demand for glass dropped, Isaac borrowed money to try and prop up his business. When a loan he made to a friend of ¬£2,000 was not repaid, Isaac could not repay his own debts. In 1820, he was declared bankrupt, and accused of fraud. The charges were dropped, but too late: he sank to being a peddler, returning to the trade of his father. He died in 1835, and was buried in the cemetery he had bought for the Jewish community at St Phillip's twenty years earlier.

Background Governor William Tryon had dispatched Gen. Hugh Waddell to raise militia in Rowan and Mecklenburg counties for the purpose of capturing a force of Regulators under Benjamin Merrill known to be operating in the area. Waddell reached Salisbury and attempted to march north, but was hampered when a large supply of gunpowder and firearms being brought by wagon from Charleston was captured and blown up by Regulators. The battle With little ammunition, Waddell hoped to link up with Tryon's militia but instead found his path blocked at the crossing of the Yadkin River by Merrill and a large force of Regulators. A majority of his militiamen, many of whom sympathized with the Regulators, surrendered, and Waddell was compelled to turn back to Salisbury. A couple of days later, the advance of a company of reinforcements ‚Äì a part of Governor William Tryon's army ‚Äì contravened Merrill's planned rendezvous with forces under Regulator leader Herman Husband encamped at the Great Alamance Creek, and he was forced to turn to the east and deal with the new threat before heading to the rebel camp. Aftermath The several day's delay resulted in Merrill's troop arriving too late to play a role in the Battle of Alamance, and he and several others were captured and executed. Waddell's remaining force eventually linked up with Tryon's troops at Reedy Creek on June 4, 1771, but the uprising was by that time essentially over.

Residing within the zenana were also eunuchs, concubines, members of the royal household, servants, and entertainers, all of which comprised a massive community within itself. As such, the necessity for organizing the administration of zenana life led to the creation of several official posts within the harem. Among these positions was the Tehwildar. Described as the \\"lady accounts officer and cashier to whom all officials, including daroghas, had to apply for their salaries,\\" she was responsible for all of the financial transactions related to the zenana and its residents. The disbursement of salaries may have been the primary responsibility of the cash-keeper. However, other duties included the administration of allowances to the royal women. All requests of funds were first sent to the Tehwildar for approval. She then wrote a memorandum to the applicant who approved her official document.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. The first part of the property that was developed is a cemetery, which is located in the middle of the former VA golf course. It contains 40 plots. The State Industrial Home for the Blind was opened on the site of what would become the Veterans Administration Hospital on January 1, 1892. It remained in operation until April 30, 1900, when the last patient moved out. Two years later the facility was transformed into the State Hospital for Inebriates, which was a place of detention and treatment for males addicted to morphine, cocaine and other narcotics. Local citizens protested, and it was closed a few years later. The buildings sat empty until 1920 when they became a temporary hospital for disabled military veterans. There were initially 125 patients in a facility that had a bed capacity of 171. The US Government bought the property two years later for $200,000. The site contained five brick structures, a greenhouse, and several frame buildings. The city of Knoxville advocated for a permanent hospital facility on the site, which it secured the following year. Buildings 1-5, 8-9, the warehouse, engineering shops, power plant, four resident quarters, three garages, the VA flag pole and a modern dairy barn were built in 1923. Buildings 101 and 102 were the last patient buildings to be constructed in 1944. The bed capacity increased to 1,631. The fire station, laundry facility and education building were renovated in 1996. Later that year it was announced that the Des Moines and Knoxville VA Medical Centers were to be integrated, and they became known collectively as VA Central Iowa Healthcare System in 1997. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony J. Principi announced on January 7, 2005 that the Knoxville facility would close. The last Knoxville patients were moved to the new extended care building in Des Moines on December 18, 2009. By February 2019 the city was negotiating to purchase the campus.

It won Nepal's foremost literary award, the Madan Puraskar. The story starts with the mention of the narrator being on his journey to Ghandruk. Martha(Major Character) was mention as teacher in Prithivi Narayan Campus and in journey along with writer she mentions about Pashchimanchal Campus, popular engineering college. The book being set into the place, which has become one of the most popular tourist destinations of today has also added up to its attraction among the young generation. However, as the book proceeds towards the second part, the story takes another turn where even the narrator seems to have gone out of the story the narrator becomes the third person from the first person. This has made the story telling experimental, however, the language of the book is easy and simple. It also uses some of the English words in between which make the conversation livelier.  Description  The book describes some of the interesting events and incidents, however, even then, the deep philosophy could be sensed and might leave the reader confused as where to focus, in the story or the philosophy. The major characters in the story are (Adiguru) Prashant and (Adimata) Martha and the major focus of the book is the continuous changes that occur in the mental state of these two characters. Both of the characters are dissatisfied with each other and both are guilty about their past. They have both started a journey of ending their dissatisfaction and facing their guilt. Prashat, who had loved Martha has changed into Adiguru after her refusal and Martha, however, realizes the value of love only after she rejects Prashant and she goes on a quest of finding him in the Adi village. But this is the time when Prashant rejects her proposal and instead changes her into Adimata. The emotions and thinking of Martha and her response towards the behavior shown by Adiguru is really interesting. However, the ego that develops as Adiguru is deeper that a normal reader could understand and for understanding the philosophy of the book, one needs to be critical and analytical instead of simply reading the novel, one of the reasons for the story being more popular than its philosophy. The characters, too, are affected by their human weaknesses and the only character who really deserves to be applauded is Prem Murti, who do not possess any bigger human weaknesses. The decisions Prashant makes of deforming the village is quite unpredictable and the book, as a whole is quite interesting for the people. The book Pagal Basti by Saru Bhakta has also been awarded with the most prestigious Madan Puraskar and this deep philosophical book proves to be a good read for those who wants to gain knowledge as well as entertainment at the same time.

The Big Three consisted of Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder, and Barry Zito. Each pitcher in the Big Three was drafted by the Athletics and they played their first couple of years together with the Athletics before splitting up. The Big Three helped the Athletics win three AL West Division titles during their five years together. Formation Tim Hudson was drafted by the Oakland Athletics twice, first in the 35th round of the 1994 MLB Draft and then in the 6th round of the 1997 MLB Draft. Mark Mulder was selected by the Athletics with the #2 overall pick in the 1998 MLB draft. Barry Zito was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the 59th pick of the 1996 MLB Draft and then again by the Texas Rangers in the round of the 1998 MLB Draft, but he did not sign with either team. Barry Zito would sign with the Athletics after they drafted him with the ninth overall pick of the 1999 MLB Draft. Tim Hudson would make his MLB debut on June 8, 1999, where he would allow three runs in five innings as the Athletics lost to the San Diego Padres 5-3. He would record his first career win in his next start, which would occur on June 13, 1999 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Tim Hudson would have an 11-2 record in his rookie season and he would finish 5th in voting for the 1999 AL Rookie of the Year Award. Mark Mulder would make his MLB Debut on April 18, 2000, at 22 years of age and having played less than two years in the minors. Mark Mudler had a rough rookie season, as he 9-10 with a 5.44 ERA in his rookie year. Barry Zito would make his MLB debut on July 22, 2000, and he would allow just one run in five innings in a victory over the Anaheim Angels, thus marking the beginning of the \\"Big Three\\" era. Barry Zito would have a successful rookie season as he had a 7-4 record and a 2.72 ERA in 14 starts and like Hudson, he would finish 5th in voting for the 2000 AL Rookie of the Year Award. \\"Big Three\\" era Led by an AL-high 20-wins from Tim Hudson, the \\"Big Three\\" led the Oakland Athletics to an AL West Division Title in their first season together. The Athletics would end up splitting the first two games of the ALDS with the New York Yankees, and then Tim Hudson would make his postseason debut in Game 3 of the 2000 ALDS. Tim Hudson would pitch a full eight innings in his postseason debut and allow four runs as the A's would fall to the Yankees 4-2 in Hudson's postseason debut. Barry Zito would make his postseason debut in Game 4 of the ALDS, as he would allow only one run in 5.2 innings to lead the Athletics to an 11-1 win in Game 4 to force a deciding Game 5 back in Oakland. The A's would then lose Game 5 7-5 and would then be eliminated from the postseason. The next season, Mark Mulder would have an AL-leading 21 wins to lead the \\"Big Three\\" and the Oakland Athletics into the postseason as a wild card. Mark Mulder would make his postseason debut in Game 1 of the ALDS against the Yankees. Mark Mulder would have a strong postseason debut as he allowed only one run in 6.2 innings to lad the A's to a 5-3 win over the Yankees in Game 1 of the ALDS. Tim Hudson would take the mound for Game 2 and he would pitch eight scoreless innings to lead the A's to a 2-0 win in Game 2 to put the A's ahlead 2-0 heading home and to earn his first career postseason win. Barry Zito would take the mound in Game 3 and would attempt to finish off a sweep against the Yankees, and he would give up only one run in eight innings in his attempt to do so, however, the A's lost the game 1-0. The A's would lose Game 4 9-2, which would mean that it would take a fifth game to decide the series. Mark Mulder would take the mound for Game 5 and would attempt to advance to the ALCS, but his attempt did not go very well as he allowed four runs in 4.1 innings as the A's would lose Game 5 5-3 and would then be eliminated in the ALDS by the Yankees for the second consecutive year. Barry Zito would lead the \\"Big Three\\" and the Athletics the following year with an AL-leading 23 wins, a 2.75 ERA, and 182 strikeouts, and he would win the 2002 AL Cy Young Award and lead the A's to an AL West Division title. Tim Hudson would take the mound for Game 1 of the ALDS against the Minnesota Twins and it would not go well for him as after the A's would jump out to a 5-1 lead after two innings, Tim Hudson would give up three more runs in the next 3.1 innings and would be pulled out after 5.1 innings, as the A's lost the game 7-5. Mark Mulder would take the mound for Game 2 and he would have a strong outing, only giving up one run in six innings to lead the A's to a 9-1 win over the Twins in Game 2. Barry Zito would take the mound for Game 3 and he would go six innings giving up three runs to lead the A's to a 6-3 win over the Twins. Tim Hudson would take the mound again in Game 4 and it would not go well for him as he would give up seven runs in just 3.1 innings and the A's would get blown out by the Twins 11-2. Mark Mulder would take the mound again for the A's in the fifth and deciding game of the ALDS and would attempt to send the A's to the ALCS, and this time, he would give up just two runs in seven innings, but the A's would lose the Game 5-4 and would be eliminated in the ALDS for the third consecutive year. The \\"Big Three\\" were able to lift the A's to an AL West title in 2003, earning them their fourth consecutive postseason appearance. However, Mark Mulder was unable to pitch in the postseason due to injury. Tim Hudson would get things started by going 6.2 innings allowing three runs in Game 1 of the 2003 ALDS, as the A's would beat the Boston Red Sox 5-4. Barry Zito would have a strong outing for the A's in Game 2 of the ALDS as he gave up only one run in seven innings to lead the A's to a 5-1 win over the Red Sox to put them ahead 2-0 leading to Boston. The A's would end up losing Game 3 3-1 in 11 innings. Tim Hudson would exit Game 4 after just one inning due to a strained left oblique, and the A's would end up losing Game 4 5-4. Barry Zito would take the mound for Game 5 and would attempt to send the A's to the ALCS after three consecutive ALDS-Game 5 losses, but after pitching five scoreless innings, he would give up four runs in the sixth inning as the A's would lose the Game 4-3 and would then be eliminated after losing Game 5 of the ALDS for the fourth consecutive year. The following year, Tim Hudson's season would be cut short due to an injury and that would prove to be costly for the A's as they finished second in the AL West and would miss the playoffs for the first time since 1999. Aftermath and Breakup After the 2004 season, Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane shocked many people with two bizarre trades which broke up the \\"Big Three\\", as he traded Tim Hudson to the Atlanta Braves and he traded Mark Mulder to the St. Louis Cardinals just when they were getting to the primes of their career. Tim Hudson would spend nine seasons with the Atlanta Braves before playing his final two seasons for the San Francisco Giants, with whom he would win the 2014 World Series. Mark Mulder would spend four seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals, after which he would be released from the Cardinals after suffering from rotator cuff and other shoulder problems during his time with the Cardinals and after remaining unsigned for a year and a half, he would announce his retirement on June 15, 2010 by saying \\"I guess I have retired.\\" Barry Zito would spend two more seasons with the A's after they traded Mulder and Hudson. In the 2006 season, Barry Zito would have a 16-10 record, a 3.83 ERA, and 151 strikeouts to help lead the Athletics to an AL West Title. Barry Zito had a strong outing for the A's in Game 1 of the ALDS as he would only give up one run in eight innings to lead the A's to a 3-2 win over the Minnesota Twins in Game 1. The A's would end up winning the next two games to sweep the Twins and advance to the ALCS for the first time since 1992, also winning their first postseason series since 1990. Barry Zito would take the mound for Game 1 of the ALCS against the Detroit Tigers, but it would not go well for him as he gave up five runs in 3.2 innings as the A's fell to the Tigers 5-1. The A's would end up losing the next three games and would end up getting swept by the Tigers in the ALCS. After the 2006 season, Barry Zito would sign with the San Francisco Giants, and would play seven seasons with the Giants and after taking a year off from baseball in 2014, Barry Zito spent one last season with the Oakland A's Triple-A Affiliate, Nashville Sounds. Zito was briefly called up to Oakland at the end of the 2015 season following an injury to one of their starters. This call-up, combined with a series against the San Francisco Giants with a scheduled start by Hudson, set up an impromptu reunion of the Big Three. With Mark Mulder in attendance, Barry Zito started for the Athletics against Tim Hudson of the Giants in front of a sold- out crowd at Oakland Coliseum on September 26, 2015 - nearly eleven seasons after they had last played together on the A's. https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/OAK/OAK201509260.shtml After the 2015 season, both Tim Hudson and Barry Zito would retire from baseball.

From 1828 the narrow gauge, horse-drawn Nantlle Railway ran from wharves at Caernarfon through and through the site of the future Nantlle station to slate quarries around the village of Nantlle. In the 1860s the Carnarvonshire Railway built a new standard gauge line southwards from Caernarfon to , replacing the Nantlle Railway's tracks as far south as . The Nantlle quarries and railway were very much still in business, so they continued to send their products to Caernarfon by transhipping them onto the new railway at Tyddyn Bengam a short distance north of Penygroes. This arrangement continued until 1872 when the LNWR repeated the earlier process and built a standard gauge branch partly on the Nantlle Railway trackbed from Penygroes to Talysarn, where it built a wholly new passenger station which it called Nantlle, though in reality the branch only reached half way to the village of Nantlle. This station included a locomotive servicing area at its eastern end. From then onwards products were transshipped from the quarry wagons onto standard gauge wagons in the goods yard at \\"Nantlle\\" station. The narrow gauge wagons were manoeuvred by horse and by hand, a way of working which, remarkably, survived until 1963. Passenger traffic along the branch, which was less than a mile and a half long, was not heavy. The station closed to normal passenger traffic in 1932, though excursion traffic (mostly outbound from Nantlle) continued until 1939. The station closed completely in 1963. The station building was still standing in 2012, though most other infrastructure had long been built over.

He came to national attention in the United States during the 2016 presidential campaign as an example of a Muslim American soldier who sacrificed his life for his country. Born in the United Arab Emirates to Pakistani parents, he moved to the U.S. with his family as a young boy. He attended the University of Virginia, where he was a member of the Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps. Upon graduating in 2000, Khan was commissioned as a second lieutenant and entered active duty service. By 2004, he had been promoted to captain and deployed with his unit for the Iraq War. On June 8, 2004, he was killed in a suicide attack and posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star Medal. During the 2016 Democratic National Convention, his father Khizr Khan stood at the podium with his mother, Ghazala Khan, and delivered a speech condemning then U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump's statements on Muslims. Early life Khan was born in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, to Khizr and Ghazala Khan, who originate from Punjab, Pakistan. They moved to the United States in 1980 and Humayun grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland. As a young child, Khan read extensively about Thomas Jefferson. In high school, he taught swimming to disabled children. Khan graduated from John F. Kennedy High School in 1996, and the University of Virginia in 2000. At the University of Virginia, Khan joined the university's Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps. Career Khan joined the United States Army and had planned on becoming a military lawyer. According to his father, one of his personal heroes was Arizona senator and former prisoner of war John McCain. Khan achieved the rank of captain. In 2004, Khan was assigned to the Headquarters and Headquarters Company of the 201st Forward Support Battalion, 1st Infantry Division in Vilseck, Germany. On 8 June 2004, 120 days into his tour of duty in Iraq, Khan was inspecting a guard post near Baqubah when a suspicious taxicab began approaching quickly. Ordering his subordinates away, Khan ran toward the vehicle and was killed when the bomb in it exploded. The car detonated before it could reach the installation gates or the nearby mess hall where hundreds of soldiers were eating. The blast also killed the two occupants of the vehicle and two Iraqi bystanders. Khan's grave at Arlington National Cemetery bears the star and crescent, one of the official United States Department of Veterans Affairs emblems for headstones and markers, representing Muslim servicemembers. On 15 June, Khan was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. His grave became a frequent destination for visitors to Arlington National Cemetery, who left flowers, US flags, and letters of support. Legacy The first University of Virginia graduate to die in combat since the Vietnam War, Khan was honored by two university ceremonies. Khan was also posthumously awarded the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart. Khan was also honored by the Virginia General Assembly, which passed a resolution noting \\"with great sadness the loss of a courageous and patriotic American.\\" In December 2015, Hillary Clinton, a presidential candidate in the 2016 United States presidential election, spoke about Khan's service praising him as \\"the best of America\\". In 2018, Representative Tom Garrett introduced a bill that would name a Charlottesville, Virginia post office after Khan. Both houses of the 115th United States Congress unanimously passed the bill, and President Trump signed it into law on 21 December 2018. A joint statement by the senators from Virginia Tim Kaine and Mark Warner said, \\"With the dedication of [the Captain Humayun Khan Post Office], we're showing the Khan family that we're forever grateful for his service and sacrifice for our country\\". The post office was officially renamed on 9 September 2019 during a ceremony attended by Kaine and other politicians. 2016 Democratic National Convention Khizr Khan's remarks during the 2016 Democratic National Convention Khan's parents appeared at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, where his father, Khizr Khan, spoke of his dead son and rebuked the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, for his statements about Muslims and his proposed policies concerning them. Trump criticized the appearance of Khan's parents at the Democratic Convention, and suggested that Khan's mother may not have been allowed to speak. Trump's comments about Khan's mother, Ghazala, sparked widespread condemnation and triggered her response as an op-ed in The Washington Post. On 31 July 2016, Ghazala Khan expressed her thoughts and said she had been too overcome by emotion at the convention to speak at the podium. She wrote, \\"Donald Trump said I had nothing to say. I do. My son Humayun Khan, an Army captain, died 12 years ago in Iraq.

It resulted in the immediate deaths of James Allen Beck, a convicted felon, and Hagop \\"Jake\\" Kuredjian, a sheriff's deputy. Ten years later, ATF agent Jeff Ryan succumbed to mental illness resulting from the traumatic ordeal. Background James Allen Beck (January 12, 1966 - August 31, 2001) attended Palisades High and later the Rio Hondo College police academy. He worked for the Arcadia, California Police Department before being fired during the probationary period. Subsequently, he impersonated law enforcement officers, typically a U.S. marshal. Beck worked at odd jobs. He was convicted in separate instances of burglary, receiving stolen property, and possession of an assault weapon. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) had conducted a search of Beck's residence, at another address, prior to 2001 without any resistance. Beck's mother purchased a home for him in Stevenson Ranch, California. He was known for having a large collection of guns at his home. Neighbors noticed surveillance vans targeting him. One tip resulted in the confrontation. Shootout The (ATF) received information in 2000 that Beck, a felon, was buying large amounts of ammunition for assault weapons. On August 31, 2001, eight ATF agents, two U.S. marshals and three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies visited Beck's home to serve a search warrant. Beck refused to come out, and started firing upon the officers. Early in the gunfight one of the deputies, Hagop \\"Jake\\" Kuredjian, was shot by Beck from a 2nd-floor window, killing him instantly. A SWAT team responded. During the gunfight, law enforcement officers fired an estimated 555 rounds at Beck and at neighbors' houses. Beck himself is estimated to have shot \\"hundreds if not thousands\\" of rounds. He fired on sheriff and news helicopters with large caliber ammunition. Four hours into the standoff, a hot tear-gas canister was shot into Beck's home, probably starting a fire. Firefighters worked to prevent the fire's spread to other homes. Because of the ongoing threat, they did not dare try to put out the fire in Beck's house. Shots continued to be fired by Beck until the roof collapsed. The rubble of Beck's burned-out home was too compromised for coroners to determine the cause of his death. Critics of the ATF's actions, including members of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, said that the bureau had failed to prepare for a violent response and did not properly warn the County Sheriff's Department of the potential risks, including Beck's stockpile of weapons. Legacy Hagop \\"Jake\\" Kuredjian Hagop \\"Jake\\" Kuredjian (June 5, 1961 - August 31, 2001), born in Aleppo, Syria, to an Armenian family, was a 17-year veteran of the Sheriff's Department. He had received a medal for saving the life of a woman dangling from a cliff in Malibu. The family of slain deputy Kuredjian received a $650,000 settlement from Beck's home-owner's insurance for a wrongful death claim. In Stevenson Ranch a six-acre park has been named \\"Jake Kuredjian Park\\". The City of Malibu created the \\"Jake Kuredjian Citizenship Award\\", given annually to \\"outstanding individuals who give their time and resources to enhance the quality of recreation programs.\\" A street was named for him in Newhall, California. Seventeen rosebushes, one for each year of his service, were planted in his memory at the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station. An 11-year old neighbor and three of his friends collected over $8,000 for the family.Children Raise Dollars for Family of Slain CA Deputy 9/4/2001 Daily News Heather MacDonald. Donated money went to open a library in a village in Armenia, and to fund scholarships for students interested in law enforcement. Jeff Ryan Jeffrey P. Ryan, (March 17, 1972 - September 19, 2011), had joined the ATF as an agent just 37 days before the shootout, he formerly served with US Air Force from 1990 to 1994 during both of Gulf and Bosnian Wars and served with U.S. Border Patrol from 1996 to 2001. He was next to Kuredjian when the deputy was shot, and the gunfire forced him to stay beside Kuredjian for ten minutes before they could be moved to safety. Ryan suffered from severe post-traumatic stress disorder as a result. Ten years later, he committed suicide, leaving behind a widow and two children. Neighbors The house adjoining Beck's home was mistakenly targeted by law enforcement officers, resulting in more than 100 rounds being fired into the structure. The residents, a married couple with their newborn infant, took shelter on their bathroom floor during the barrage. Unhurt, they subsequently filed a $500,000 claim against the county, alleging \\"deliberate indifference\\" . They settled for $200,000. $32,500 was given to another neighbor who had been trapped in his home during the shootout and whose home was hit by about 30 rounds.

It was directed by Bradley Buecker and written by series co-creator Brad Falchuk. It premiered on September 27, 2016 on Fox Broadcasting Company. The episode centers on Chad's attempt to win Chanel back and facing competition from Dr. Brock. Meanwhile, Chanel #5 finds love with a patient with severe warts around his body. The episode was watched by 1.70 million viewers and received positive reviews from critics. Plot Chanel #5 (Abigail Breslin) is being interrogated by a detective regarding Catherine Hobart's decapitation. She is desperate because nobody believes her, especially Chanel (Emma Roberts) and Chanel #3 (Billie Lourd). Meanwhile, a new patient with a Neurofibromatosis type I, Tyler (Colton Haynes), is being admitted into the hospital, where Dr. Brock (John Stamos) admits that they have a problem: there is a device that could help removing his warts but it is expensive and the hospital does not have it yet, which makes Tyler desperate. Zayday (Keke Palmer) grows suspicious that Dean Cathy Musnch (Jamie Lee Curtis) is hiring the Chanels to the hospital to get rid of them one by one, so she enlists Chamberlain (James Earl) to investigate why Cathy builds a hospital in the first place. Later, Chanel and Dr. Brock goes on a movie date, where all of a sudden his hands uncontrollably grabs Chanel's breast and grips other man's popcorn. Unaffected, Chanel got smitten and they proceed to kiss. Chanel is on a night shift where she got chased by the Red Devil. It turns out to be Chad Radwell (Glen Powell) in disguise and it was revealed that it was him who scared Chanel in the asylum at the end of the first season. He is there to accompany his friend Randall, who has a severe trauma-caused screaming problem, while also planning to win her back. But he soon learn that Chanel is less impressed with Chad's new antics as she is really bewitched by Dr. Brock's charm. Chad challenge Dr. Brock for a squash game to fight over Chanel. He is easily beaten by Brock, but after noticing how his right hand is behaving strangely, he confronts Brock while Brock warns him to back off. Chad hires a private investigator and he discovers that Brock's right hand was donored from a squash player who happened to be a serial killer. He goes to confront him. Zayday and Chamberlain continue their investigation and finds out that in 1986, the entire staff of the old hospital (including Dr. Mike (Jerry O'Connell) and Nurse Thomas (Laura Bell Bundy) were murdered during a halloween party by someone in the Green Meanie costume, and they never found out the killer's identity. In the hallway, they bump into Nurse Ingrid Hoffel (Kirstie Alley) who ask Zayday about the Chanels' schedule to keep on track with them secretively. An unconvinced Zayday is even more repulsed by Ingrid obvious lies to her question. Ingrid angrily tells her off. Later Zayday confronts Musnch about her plans but Musnch revealed her true intentions of opening the hospital; she is trying to find a cure for herself as she has in incurable disease herself and that she might not have a long time, and she burst into tears. Zayday tries to find a cure for her, but after some trials deduce that there is no cure and she only got a year to live. Cathy tells her this must be kept a secret, but unknown to them Ingrid is secretly listening to their conversation. One night, Cathy got ambushed by the Green Meanie in the hospital hallways and is able to defeat it. Just when she is about to unmask the killer, Dr. Cassidy Cascade (Taylor Lautner) and Chanel #3 arrives and distract Cathy. She is furious because the killer's got to escape due to their sudden arrival. Realizing Chanel #5's claims are true, she enlists CIA agent Denise Hemphill (Niecy Nash) to help them investigate, and she suggest to ask Hester Ulrich (Lea Michelle) as she was a killer too. Hester demands to be transferred from the highly secure prison to the C.U.R.E. institute and given some discontinued beauty products and threatens more killings will occur if they refuse. Tyler and Chanel #5 got closer as he comforts her, where she tells him she is depressed of the Chanels' treatment to her and how she is not capable of getting a boyfriend. As a sympathetic Tyler reveals his photo before he has those warts, Chanel #5 is stunned to see how handsome he was and decide to raise funds for his surgery. Chanel and Chanel #3 mocks #5's fund raising video and tell her that as soon as Tyler is healed, he will feel the need to date her out of pity, while #5 is unsure. While both of them are on a dinner, Chanel #5 admits that she likes Tyler's personality despite his warts. She suddenly goes into a rampage when two guys insults Tyler. After calming down she apologizes to him for being uncontrollable but Tyler is impressed. As they grow closer, Chanel seemingly congratulates #5 for being able to look into someone's soul rather than their ugly appearance (she was actually congratulating Tyler, instead) and announces she manipulated Chad to donate for Tyler's surgery. The new couple are facetiming before his supposed surgery, but after it ends, #5 discover that his surgery is not scheduled that day and tells the Chanels about it. In the surgery room, Tyler is shocked to see the Green Meanie instead of the surgeons and the Green Meanie burns him with the laser supposed to be for surgery. The Chanels arrived too late to find him dead. As Chanel #5 mourns his death, Chanel states that they have another serial killer in their hands.

It had a mixed Ku band and Ka band payload and was expected replace Superbird-A at the position at 158¬∞East longitude. It was expected to provided television signals and business communications services throughout Japan, southern and eastern Asia, and Hawaii. While the launch was within the margins specified by the satellite manufacturer, the trajectory analysis had been inexact and the satellite suffered severe life and power degradation. It tried to use a supersynchronous transfer strategy, but Boeing had failed to take into consideration the effect of the Moon. Thus, the lowest part of the orbit dropped too fast and much propellant had to be spent on a fast transit to geosynchronous orbit. Additionally, the solar panels suffered damage from the extreme contact with the atmosphere. Given the damage to the spacecraft, it was never put into service. Satellite description The spacecraft was designed and manufactured by Boeing on the BSS-601 satellite bus. It had a launch mass of , a beginning of life mass of and an end of life mass of . It was designed for a 13-year life. When stowed for launch, it measured . It had two wings with four solar panels each, that generated 4378 W at the end of its design life. When fully deployed, the solar panels spanned , with its antennas in fully extended configuration it was wide. It had a 29-cell NiH2 battery with a power charge of 200Ah. Its propulsion system was composed of a LAE with a thrust of . It also used had 12 bipropellant thrusters for station keeping and attitude control. It included enough propellant for orbit circularization and 13 years of operation. It had a dual Ku band and Ka band payload. The Ku band section had its dual gridded shaped antenna on the West side. It had twenty three transponders powered by TWTA with and output power of 85 Watts. It had a wide beam footprint that covered Japan, southern and eastern Asia, and Hawaii. It's Ka band section had a single gridded shaped antenna on the East side for the wide beam, and a Nadir shaped surface antenna for the steerable beam. It had four 100 MHz transponders powered by TWTA with and output power of 70 Watts. The wide beam covered Japan, southern and eastern Asia, and Hawaii, while the steerable beam could be focus on any zone that had line-of-sight to the satellite. History Space Communications Corporation (SCC) was founded in 1985, the same year as the original companies that later formed JSAT. On September 2001 SCC ordered its third BSS-601 based spacecraft, Superbird-6. It was to use the 158¬∞ East position and offer a Japan wide beam service in Ku band and Ka band, plus steerable Ka band spot beams. It was expected for a Fall of 2003 launch aboard an Atlas IIAS. It was decided to launch Superbird-6 into a 2,895 minutes period supersynchronous orbit with an apogee of 120,679 km, a perigee of 1,138 km and a 25.5¬∞ inclination. This extreme perigee and a six-maneuvers circularization program would reduce the propellant expenditure to its final position in geosynchronous orbit. It was launched on April 16, 2004 by an Atlas IIAS that injected in the supersynchronous orbit specified by the satellite manufacturer, at which point it was named Superbird-A2. But the orbit analysis had failed to take into consideration the influence of the Moon at such high apogees and the perigee started to drop dangerously fast. Most of its propellant had to be spent and the solar panels suffered damage that reduced the power production. It was never commissioned into service.

Animals with this condition have historically tended to come to veterinary attention when they develop difficulties related to opening and closing the arytenoid cartilages of the larynx in the throat of the animal, causing difficulty with breathing and swallowing, and was therefore for many years the condition was believed to be an idiopathic form of laryngeal paralysis, meaning \\"of unknown cause\\". Investigations into idiopathic laryngeal paralysis by two groups (in Michigan and Tennessee) between 2005 and 2013 showed that dogs with ILP did not only suffer dysfunction of the laryngeal nerves; they found that this was just one prominent symptom of what was a very gradually progressing polyneuropathy of old age, which also affected other nerves in the body. This finding, now generally believed correct following further research, has led to the disease commonly being proposed in veterinary discussion and papers, to be renamed from ILP to GOLPP, to better reflect this new understanding since this discovery. Epidemiology Medium-to-large breed dogs are most commonly affected by GOLPP, including the Afghan hound, golden retriever, Irish setter, Labrador retriever, Rottweiler, St Bernard and standard poodle.

As of 1891, it was one of the 128 tehsils in the province. Gholam Muhayuddin Khan served as tehsildar of the Doaba Daudzai tehsil. The areas of the erstwhile Doaba Daudzai tehsil are today part of Pakistan. Geography The Doaba Daudzai tehsil included 159 villages and had an area of 182 square miles. As of 1868 the estimated population of area had been 72,676. The tehsil included the tongue of land lying between the Kabul and Swat rivers above their junction, as well as a piece of land south of the Kabul river. Overall, the lands were fertile with plenty of water supply for agriculture. Foundation The tehsil was founded on 1 April 1872, as the tehsils of Peshawar District were reorganized to create a more balanced distribution of the population between them. Before the creation of the Doaba Daudzai tehsil, Doaba and Daudzai had been two separate tehsils with 53 and 127 villages respectively. With the re-districting of 1872, twenty villages from Daudzai tehsil were transferred to the Nowshera tehsil, and one village of Doaba tehsil (Shahi Kulali) was transferred to the Hashtnagar tehsil. Zails and tribes The Doaba Daudzai tehsil was divided into six zails; Matta (14 villages), Gulbela (60 villages), Ambadher (22 villages), Shah Alam (11 villages), Charpariza (23 villages) and Daudzai (27 villages). All of these zails were dominated by Pathan tribes. The Gigyani tribe was prominent in the Matta and Ambadher zails. The Daudzai tribe was prominent in the zails of Gulbela, Shah Alam, Charpariza and Daudzai. The Sulaimanzai tribe was prominent in the Ambadher zail. The Bahlolzai was prominent in the Gulbela zail. There was also a certain Mohmand presence in Gulbela zail. Towns Two locations in Doaba Daudzai were officially classified as 'towns', Fort Shankargarh and Fort Michni. According to the 1881 census of British India, Fort Shankargarh had 1,367 inhabitants (879 male, 488 female) and Fort Michni had 208 inhabitants (205 male, 3 female). Mafis There were 329 (grants of lands free of revenue) linked to mosques in the tehsil. Covering a combined area of 528 acres, none of the mosque extended more than 10 acres. There were also 6 Hindu , granted by Sikh rulers for an extended period of time. Abolition The Doaba Daudzai tehsil was abolished as per the Punjab Gazette Notifications 379 and 380, issued on 13 May 1893.

The fish weir is a scheduled monument. Location Llanddona fish weir is at the far eastern end of the beach at Red Wharf Bay where a band of rocks turns to sand, and is near the estuary of the brook that passes near St Dona's church. The fish weir lies at the edge of the Penmon Historic Landscape Area. Description Llanddona fish weir is a V-shaped trap, typically used when trapping fish in tidal waters. The two arms of the V run down the beach, starting below the high-water line and almost meet at the tip of the V just above the low-water line, where the fish are caught in a net or a trap when the tide recedes. The sides of the V-shaped trap can be made of stone, wattle fencing, or both. At Llanddona the sea is north of the beach, so the western arm, about 300m long, points north-east, and the eastern arm, about 100m long, starts at the edge of the beach and points north-west. History Llanddona fish weir is first mentioned in the 17th century in the records of the Baron Hill estate and is also shown on a chart of 1748 by Lewis Morris, a hydrographer, surveyor and author from Anglesey. Near the weir there are two buildings named as Godreddi Bach and Godreddi Mawr. The names seem to be a corruption of Goreddi (the plural of gored, meaning weir). This possibly associates the buildings with the weir, and that there may have been more than one weir. Additionally, a double line of stones has been identified on an aerial photograph which may be part of the original construction or part of later rebuilding. Recent history Llanddona fish weir was designated as a scheduled monument in 2002 as being of national importance to improve understanding of medieval or post-medieval maritime agricultural practices and possibly containing archaeological information concerning chronology and building techniques. Access Llanddona fish weir, like most of the beach at Red Wharf Bay, is covered by the sea at high tide, and even at low tide the apex of the weir is still underwater.

Under the influence of the Funen Painters, his style changed from social realism to impressionism and he mostly did landscapes. He maintained an interest in social issues, however, and was often at odds with Faaborg's conservative government. In 1906 he returned to Berlin, where he revisited the shelters, asylums and orphanages and created paintings with new characters in his more mature style.

It forms a staple part of the local cuisine and is considered a rich source of nutrition due to its mix of various greens. It is a popular household dish in Pakistan, India, and among the Sindhi diaspora. Origins The name of the curry is said to be derived from two words of Sindhi language: sai (meaning \\"green\\") and bhaji (meaning \\"vegetables\\"), thus indicating the ingredients used to cook the dish. Sai bhaji is consumed throughout summers and winters, as a night and day meal respectively. It is favoured due to its healthy nutrition and simplicity of preparation. In the dry regions of interior Sindh, seasonal vegetables are dried and stocked for year-round cooking purposes. Ingredients and preparation The main ingredients used in sai bhaji include chopped spinach leaves, as well as smaller quantities of fenugreek, dill and gongura leaves. The greens are mixed with drained lentils (usually channa dal or moong dal) and cooking oil to prepare the stew. Other ingredients added to the gravy include cumin seeds, ginger and garlic, chopped onions and tomatoes, water, salt, green chillies, turmeric and coriander powders, red chilli powder, brinjals and potatoes. The level of spices used is typically mild. The curry has a smooth and creamy texture once cooked.

Swimming  Swimming is another sport open to people in this class. SS1 swimmers may be found in several classes. These include S2, and S5. S5 swimmers with short stature have a height less than 130 cm for women and 137 cm for men. They have an additional disability that creates problem with their propulsion. Because they have intact hands, they can catch water correctly for propulsion. They have full trunk control and usually have symmetrical kicks with their feet but their trunk movements can reduce their propulsion. As they get up to speed, this movement causes turbulence which slows them down and they need additional strokes to compensate. They generally start from the diving platform, though a few swimmers require assistance. They also tend to use a standard kick turn.  Other sports  Powerlifting is one of the sports available to people in this class. Rather than be separated by disability type, people in this sport are separated based on weight classes. Para-equestrian is also open to SS1 sportspeople. Because they are usually ambulant, LAF5 riders may be in Grade 1 or Grade 4. Grade 1 is typically for people with cerebral palsy, les autres and spinal cord injuries who have severe levels of disability.

The film's film festival premiere was at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 2016. Simpson released it himself directly into US cinemas in 2017 and it is still in first-run cinemas in 2019, which makes it the longest first-run theatrical release in the US in over a decade. Due to the success of his self-distributed release, Simpson was asked to give a TEDx Talk on his innovative distribution model. The film stars Chief Dave Bald Eagle in the lead role as a Lakota elder. He was 95-years-old at the time of filming and it was his first starring role in a film. The film also stars Christopher Sweeney as Nerburn, Richard Ray Whitman as Grover, Roseanne Supernault as the twins Wenonah and Danelle, Tatanka Means as Delvin, Zahn McClarnon as Billy and Harlen Standing Bear Sr as Jumbo. The film was primarily shot on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, which borders South Dakota and Nebraska as well as having scenes shot in Los Angeles and Rushville, Nebraska. One scene was shot in the same remote trailer house as a scene in the acclaimed film The Rider. The film is notable for a climactic scene shot at Wounded Knee where the script and the novel was thrown away and Dave Bald Eagle improvised the whole scene from his heart, as his family had a closer connection to the Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890 than even the character he was playing. At the end of filming the scene he turned to Christopher Sweeney who was acting opposite him and said \\"I've been holding that in for 95-years\\". Dave Bald Eagle saw the film before he died and he said \\"it's the only film I've been in about my people that told the truth.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 90% based on reviews from 10 critics. Simpson has also self-distributed the film into other markets like Canada, the United Kingdom and Bulgaria so far.

(October 21, 2011) \\"Dear Occupy Wall Street: 'Move to Amend' (the Constitution)\\" NewsTimes.com Background While Citizens United is the Supreme Court case most cited by advocates for a campaign finance reform amendment, the underlying precedent for extending constitutional rights to corporations under the doctrine of corporate personhood is rooted in more than a century of Supreme Court decisions dating back to the 19th century. The debate of \\"corporate constitutional rights\\" can be parsed into the legal definitions of corporation and personhood, the latter term being controversial in regards to the philosophical debate over where human personhood begins and the legal debate over where legal personhood ends. Under US law, corporations are extended at least some legal rights and responsibilities as natural persons, such as the right to enter into contracts and to sue or be sued. However, the framers of the US Constitution had originally reserved constitutional protections for individual citizens and had not intended such protections to be inherent or inalienable for their organizations incorporated under law. The first time the Supreme Court entertained the idea of corporations having constitutional rights was in 1886's Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company, when Chief Justice Morrison Waite began oral arguments by stating, \\"The court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of the opinion that it does.\\" While the Chief Justice Waite's statement in Santa Clara County was inserted in the headnote, which was not part of the Court's opinion and not considered precedent, the doctrine was clearly affirmed in subsequent cases in Pembina Consolidated Silver Mining Co. v. Pennsylvania (1888) and Minneapolis and Saint Louis Railway v. Beckwith (1889). In the 307 Fourteenth Amendment cases heard by the Supreme Court in the years following Santa Clara County, 288 cases involved corporations compared to 19 cases involving African Americans, its intended recipients. The Court reaffirmed its Santa Clara County precedent in the landmark case Lochner v. New York (1905), which expanded corporate deregulation under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. A year later, the Court extended corporate personhood to include search and seizure protections under the Fourth Amendment in Hale v. Henkel (1906), from which dissenting Justice John Marshall Harlan stated, \\"to look into the books, records and papers of a corporation of its own creation, to ascertain whether that corporation has obeyed or is defying the law, will be greatly curtailed, if not destroyed.\\" The Court later deemed in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon (1922) that a regulation by state government is a form of takings and ruled that corporations are protected from \\"private lands being taken for public use without just compensation\\" and therefore entitled to compensation for lost profit under the Fifth Amendment. During this period known as the Lochner era, the Court cited the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause in halting over 200 regulations intended for corporations. Despite the Court's recognition of corporate personhood under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause would not be applied to women until the case Reed v. Reed (1971). In the case of Citizens United, the extension of corporate personhood to include free speech rights was premised on the First Amendment's Freedom of the Press Clause, which protects associations of individuals, including individual speakers. The Court ruled that Corporations (as associations of individuals) are entitled to free speech rights because the First Amendment does not allow prohibitions of speech based on the identity of the speaker. Furthermore, the Court extended its precedents set in Buckley v. Valeo (1976), which asserted corporate spending to political candidates and parties is the equivalent of free speech, and First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (1978), which established that non-media business corporations can give unrestricted money to \\"influence or affect\\" voter opinions in state political referenda. Proposed amendments Saving American Democracy Amendment The Saving American Democracy Amendment is a United States constitutional amendment proposed in December 2011 by Senators Mark Begich (D-Alaska) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) \\"to expressly exclude for-profit corporations from the rights given to natural persons by the Constitution of the United States, prohibit corporate spending in all elections, and affirm the authority of Congress and the States to regulate corporations and to regulate and set limits on all election contributions and expenditures.\\"112th Congress, S.J.Res.33 The Saving American Democracy Amendment was meant to overturn the 2010 United States Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which stated that freedom of speech prohibited the government from restricting independent political expenditures by a nonprofit corporation.Saving American Democracy AmendmentSaving American Democracy Amendment. 8 Dec 2011. Sanders Senate web site This was the first constitutional amendment proposed by Sanders in his two decades in Congress. The text of the amendment reads as follows: The amendment was introduced in the Senate on December 8, 2011. It was read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. The Saving American Democracy amendment proposed in the Senate was a companion bill to one proposed in the House by Representative Ted Deutch (D-Florida).112th Congress, H.J.Res.90 Deutch's amendment was referred to the House's Subcommittee on the Constitution. Both Sanders' Saving American Democracy Amendment and Deutch's amendment failed to pass. Democracy For All Amendment The Democracy For All Amendment was introduced in both the 113th and 114th Congresses. It would grant Congress and the States the ability to limit the raising and spending of money in campaigns for public office. It would also grant Congress and the States the ability to distinguish between a natural person and an artificial entity, such as a corporation. The resolution was introduced in the Senate by Senator Tom Udall and in the House by Representative Ted Deutch during both congresses. During the 113th congress the resolution received 129 co-sponsors in the House (all Democrats), and 48 co-sponsors in the Senate (46 Democrats, 2 Independents). In the Senate the resolution was never voted on, and in the House it was sent to House Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice. In the 2015 (114th congress) version the resolution received 162 co-sponsors (161 Democrats, 1 Republican) in the House, while in the Senate, the resolution received 42 co-sponsors (40 Democrats, 2 Independents). The resolution was sent to the House Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice, and Senate Committee on the Judiciary, but failed to pass either. We the People Amendment The We The People Amendment is a joint resolution to amend the United States Constitution to abolish the doctrines of corporate personhood and of money equalling political speech. It was introduced by Representative Rick Nolan as on February 23, 2013, and was re- introduced as on April 29, 2015, on January 30, 2017. It was again introduced by Representative Pramila Jayapal as on February 22, 2019. The amendment was proposed in response to the implications presented in the U.S. Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010), a U.S. constitutional law case concerning the regulation of independent political expenditures by corporations, which the nonprofit organization Citizens United challenged on the grounds of purportedly violating the First Amendment's freedom of speech. The We the People Amendment would establish that constitutional rights are reserved for natural persons only, that artificial entities ‚Äî corporations, limited liability companies, and other incorporated entities established by the laws of any state, the United States, or any foreign state ‚Äî have no rights under the Constitution and are subject to regulation through federal, state, or local law, and further establishes that privileges of such entities cannot be construed as inherent or inalienable. It would require federal, state, and local governments to regulate, limit, or prohibit political contributions or expenditures, including those made by a candidate, and would require any permissible political contributions and expenditures to be publicly disclosed. It would also prohibit the courts from construing the spending of money to influence elections as a form of protected speech under the First Amendment or from holding that the amendment would abridge the freedom of the press. The text of the amendment reads as follows: =Introduction= In the 113th Congress, the We the People Amendment received 3 co-sponsors from the Democratic Party. In the 114th Congress, it garnered 23 co-sponsors (22 Democrats, 1 Republican). In the 115th Congress, it had 66 co-sponsors (65 Democrats, 1 Republican). As of July 2019, the joint resolution is in the House Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice under the House Committee on the Judiciary. People's Rights Amendment On November 15, 2011, Representative James P. McGovern introduced the People's Rights Amendment, a proposal to limit the Constitution's protections only to the rights of natural persons, and not corporations. This amendment would overturn the United States Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.112th Congress, Supporters Organizations which advocate for an anti-corporate personhood amendment to the Constitution include Move to Amend, Wolf PAC, Mayday PAC, Free Speech For People and American Promise.

In four seasons on the racecourse he competed in Britain, Ireland, France, Germany, Japan and the United States, winning seven of his twenty-nine contests. He showed great promise as a juvenile in 1986, winning on his debut and then finishing second in both the Mill Reef Stakes and the Dewhurst Stakes. In the following year he took the Easter Stakes in April and was briefly made favourite for The Derby but did not score again until late autumn when he won both the Breeders' Cup Prep Mile and the Marshall Stakes. Shady Heights reached his peak as a four-year-old in 1988 when he won the Tattersalls Rogers Gold Cup in Ireland and the Bayerisches Zuchtrennen in Germany before being awarded the Group One International Stakes on the disqualification of Persian Heights. He also finished second in both the Eclipse Stakes and the Phoenix Champion Stakes. He failed to win in five races in 1989 and was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in Japan. He had little success as a sire of winners. Background Shady Heights was a \\"lengthy, angular\\" bay horse with no white Markings bred by the Duke of Roxburghe at his stud at Floors Castle, near Kelso, Scotland. He was from the fifth crop of foals sired by Shirley Heights who won The Derby and the Irish Derby in 1978. He became a very successful breeding stallion who sired many good winners including Slip Anchor and Darshaan. Shady Heights' dam Vaguely won two minor races from twelve starts in Britain in 1976 and 1977. She was a granddaughter of the broodmare Tantalizer, who also produced the St Leger winner Provoke. As a yearling Shady Heights was offered at the Highflyer Sales and was bought for 110,000 guineas by a representative of George Tong. He was sent into training with Robert Armstrong at his St Gatien Stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career 1986: two-year-old season Shady Heights made a successful racecourse debut in a six furlong race at Windsor Racecourse in September, coming from well off the pace to win impressively. The colt was immediately stepped up in class for the Group Two Mill Reef Stakes over the same distance at Newbury Racecourse later that month and started the 7/2 second favourite behind the outstanding filly Forest Flower. Ridden by the American jockey Steve Cauthen he was briefly outpaced when the filly accelerated two furlongs out before staying on to finish second, beaten half a length. He was five lengths clear of the other runners, who included the subsequent Middle Park Stakes winner Mister Majestic. Cauthen was again in the saddle when Shady Heights contested Britain's most prestigious race for two- year-olds, the Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 17 October. He again finished strongly and finished second, beaten three quarters of a length by Ajdal. Plans to run the colt in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile were abandoned as he was prepared for a three-year-old campaign. 1987: three-year-old season Shady Heights began his second season in the Easter Stakes over one mile at Kempton Park Racecourse and won impressively by four lengths from the Prix Thomas Bryon winner Glory Forever. After the race he was made ante-post favourite for the 1987 Epsom Derby. In May he contested recognised trials for the Derby and failed to maintain his position at the head of the market finishing second to Sir Harry Lewis in the Dee Stakes at Chester and fourth to Ibn Bey in the Predominate Stakes at Goodwood. After a three-month break, Shady Heights returned to the track and was matched against older horses for the first time in the Group One International Stakes at York Racecourse on 18 August. He made little impact as he finished ninth of the ten runners behind Triptych. He was then dropped in class and was beaten by Lockton in the Strensall Stakes at York in September before being sent to France to finish third behind Waajib in the Prix du Rond Point at Longchamp Racecourse on 4 October. He returned to England to run third behind the filly Asteroid Field in the Supreme Stakes at Goodwood before being sent to Doncaster for the Listed Breeders' Cup Prep Mile. He scored his first win since April as he won by four lengths from the Kentucky Derby runner-up Bold Arrangement. He ended his season in the Marshall Stakes (later renamed the Ben Marshall Stakes) at Newmarket and won by one and a half lengths from the filly Azyaa. 1988: four-year-old season Shady Heights was highly tried as a four-year-old, running twelve times in eight months between March and November. In early spring he finished fourth to Rose Or No in the Prix Edmond Blanc at Saint-Cloud Racecourse, third to Media Starguest in the Earl of Sefton Stakes and second to Soviet Star in the Sandown Mile. In May he was shipped to Ireland for the Tattersalls Rogers Gold Cup (then a Group Two race) over ten furlongs at the Curragh and started the 7/4 favourite against nine opponents. Ridden by the South African jockey Michael Roberts he won by half a length from the Vincent O'Brien-trained Fair Judgement. In the Prix d'Ispahan on soft ground at Longchamp two weeks later he finished fifth of the six runners behind Miesque. At Sandown Park Racecourse on 2 July Shady Heights started a 33/1 outsider for the Eclipse Stakes. Ridden by Tony Ives he produced one of his best performances a he led for most of the way before being overtaken in the final strides and beaten a neck by Mtoto in what was described as a \\"knock-down drag-out affair\\". The leading racemares Triptych and Indian Skimmer came home in third and fourth places. Four weeks later he was sent to Germany for the Bayerisches Zuchtrennen in Munich and won by four lengths from the Preis der Diana winner Alte Zeit. On 16 August Shady Heights made his second attempt to win the International Stakes in which he was ridden by Willie Carson. The three-year-old Kefaah started favourite ahead of Persian Heights with Shady Heights joint-third choice in the betting on 7/2 alongside Indian Skimmer. The other two runners were the French challenger Fijar Tango (Grand Prix de Paris) and Lapierre (Prix Jean Prat). Carson settled Shady Heights just behind the leaders and turned into the straight in third place behind Kefaah and Fijar Tango before beginning to make progress on the inside in the last quarter mile. Meanwhile, Persian Heights launched a challenge on the outside but hung to the left, hampering Indian Skimmer before taking the lead a furlong out. Persian Heights crossed the line one and a half lengths in front of Shady Heights with Indian Skimmer a neck away in third. Indian Skimmer's jockey, Steve Cauthen lodged an objection to the winner and the racecourse stewards decided that the interference at the furlong marker had cost the mare second place. Under the rules of racing at the time Persian Heights was relegated to third (behind the horse who had suffered from the interference) and Shady Heights was awarded the victory. Shady Heights' best subsequent run in 1988 came in the Phoenix Champion Stakes at Phoenix Park Racecourse on 4 September when he disputed the lead for most of the way before being beaten three quarters of a length by Indian Skimmer with Triptych and Persian Heights in third and fourth. He appeared to have been hampered by the winner in the closing stages but on this occasion the inquiry by the racecourse stewards left the result unchanged. Later that month he was sent to Germany for a second time and finished unplaced behind Kondor in the Preis von Europa. He was back in England for the Champion Stakes at Newmarket in October and finished fourth behind Indian Skimmer, Persian Heights and Doyoun. After the race he was acquired by Hideto Furuoka and sent to Japan to contest the 2400 metre Japan Cup at Tokyo Racecourse on 27 November. He made no impact and finished unplaced behind the American four-year-old Pay the Butler. 1989: five-year-old season Despite his change of ownership Shady Height remained in training with Armstrong as a five-year-old in 1989. In April he finished fifth in the Earl of Sefton Stakes and fifth behind Indian Skimmer in the Gordon Richards Stakes. After a break of almost four months he made his third and final appearance in the International Stakes and produced his best performance of the season as he finished third behind Ile de Chypre and Cacoethes at odds of 20/1. The horse was sent to the United States to contest the Arlington Million on 3 September and finished unplaced behind Steinlen. On his final racecourse appearance Shady Heights finished fifth behind Creator in the Prix Dollar at Longchamp on 7 October. Assessment In the official International Classification for 1986, Shady Heights was rated the third-best two-year-old colt in Europe behind Reference Point and Ajdal. The independent Timeform organisation gave Shady Heights a rating of 125, seven pounds behind their best two-year-old Reference Point. In their annual Racehorses of 1986 they described him as \\"a genuine classic colt\\". In 1987 he was rated 120 by Timeform who commented that his performances in late autumn had \\"restored his somewhat tarnished reputation\\". Stud record At the end of his racing career Shady Heights was exported to become a breeding stallion in Japan. In eight seasons at stud he sired 116 winners of 335 races but had no top class performers. He was however, the damsire of the Kikuka Sho winner Hishi Miracle. His last covering season was 1997. Pedigree * Shady Heights was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Nasrullah, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

Braitsch and Company Plant is a historic industrial building at 472 Potters Avenue in Providence, Rhode Island. Built in 1892, it played a key role in the development of the silversmithing industry in the city. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Description and history Front view. The Braitsch Company Plant is located in Providence's Elmwood residential neighborhood, at the southeast corner of Potters Avenue and Melrose Street. The principal building of the plant is a three-story masonry building, built out of brick with stone trim. Decorative features include segmented-arched windows set in recessed panels, with brick pilastered piers rising to a projecting cornice. It has a shallow pitch gabled roof covered by membrane. The interior has slow-burning timber frame construction with heavy plank flooring, the frame and floor both having been reinforced by steel in some places. Attached to the main building's east side is a smaller boiler house, and there is on the property a freestanding concrete block \\"dry cleaning room\\" that is of mid-20th century construction. William J. Braitsch was a native of New York City who apprenticed at the studio of Louis Comfort Tiffany in the jewelry trade. He and a partner, John Hearn, moved to Providence in 1887, where they opened a shop from which they manufactured heads for walking canes. Hearn & Braitsch built this plant as a manufacturing facility in 1892, but was dissolved the following year and operated exclusively thereafter by Braitsch. The building was designed by George W. Cady and built by N. B. Horton.Engineering and Building Record 12 June 1890: 96. New York. His business suffered due to the depression years of the 1890s, and eventually closed in 1915. As his business declined, Braitsch leased floor space in the facility to other manufacturers, mainly also in the jewelry business, and the building was taken over in its entirety by what became known as the Colonial Laundry in 1915. The business operated here until 1965, when it was readapted for jewelry manufacture. Since 1987 it has seen low-level uses such as storage.

It is thought to have the largest undeveloped tin deposit in the world. A complete community of 5,000 people was established in the remote location in the Amazon rainforest to support the mining operations, which began in 1982. There have been accidents, but efforts have been made to minimise environmental damage and to restore areas that have been mined. As of 2014 the more accessible alluvial deposits had been exhausted, but mining of primary rock was continuing. Discovery In 1976 the Brazilian Geological Survey detected deposits of cassiterite (tin ore) to the east of the Uaimiri Atroari Indigenous Reservation. Geologists of Brazilian Geological Survey, found traces of cassiterite in 1976 in tributaries of the Pitinga River that is outside the Indian reserve. The ore was reported to assay 2.1 kg/m3, much higher than typical deposits in Rond√¥nia to the southwest. Paranapanema, assisted by Funai and the National Department of Mineral Production, managed to have the reservation downgraded in 1981 to the Temporary Restricted Area for the Attraction and Pacification of the Waimiri Atroari Indians, with a reduced area that excluded the cassiterite deposits. Presidential decree 86.630 of 23 November 1981 removed from the reserve for the tin mining operations. In 1982 the US Bureau of Mines estimated that Brazil had total reserves of 67,000 tonnes of contained tin. In 1986 the Pitinga reserves alone were estimated at 575,000 tonnes of contained tin. The Minera√ß√£o Taboca concession covers in 14 lots, but as of 1992 only were being actively exploited. Primary deposits are found in the hills of the Serra da Madeira and alluvium deposits have been washed down into the forested valleys. The alluvial deposits, now exhausted, consisted of greisens associated with the √Ågua Boa biotite granite and the Madeira niobium-tantalum- tin deposit. The coarse-grained porphyritic albite granite has intruding paleoproterozoic acid volcanic and pyroclastic rocks. It includes Rapakivi granite and Biotite granite. Operations The Pitinga mine began operations in 1982. Minera√ß√£o Taboca built a community in the Amazon forest from Manaus. The complex includes roads, treated water, sanitation and a housing estate with 5,000 people. It has schools, restaurants, health facilities, a bank branch, post office, telephone exchange and supermarket. In 1985 Paranapanema invested US$15 million in infrastructure upgrades, including a 10,000 kilowatt hydroelectric power plant on the Pitinga River, expected to reduce energy costs by US$4 million annually. By 1990 the mine directly employed 2,000 people, and indirectly perhaps as many as 40,000. Trees were cleared, the river diverted and dams and ponds built before the alluvium deposits were processed. Bucketwheel excavator dredges extracted material rich in cassiterite, which was pumped through pipes to floating processing plants that separated the tin ore. The cassiterite is concentrated on site, then shipped to Mamor√© Minera√ß√£o e Metalurgia in the southern state of S√£o Paulo for casting. Columbite ore is also mined, concentrated and processed on site for use in production of FeNbTa metallic alloy. Up to 1990 a total of 120,000 tonnes of metallic tin had been produced. Mamor√© Minera√ß√£o e Metalurgia produced 18,000 tonnes of metallic tin in 1991. About US$200 million had been invested in the Pitinga complex by then, and the mine had earned US$915 in foreign currency. The mine was thought to be the world's most productive. In 2006 Minera√ß√£o Taboca began to extract ore from primary rock in place of the alluvial deposits. Minera√ß√£o Taboca and Mamor√© Minera√ß√£o e Metalurgia were acquired by the Peruvian company Minsur in 2008. In 2014 Minsur had plans to develop the lower deposits, thought to be the largest undeveloped tin mine in the world with deposits estimated at 420,000t. In 2014 the Pitinga mine produced 5,532 tonnes of tin-in-concentrate, and 3,256 tonnes in the first half of 2015. Net costs per tonne of tin in 2015 were US$14,481, allowing for revenues from co-production of tantalum and niobium. At the start of August 2015 water filtrations were found in the dyke of the hydroelectric plant away that supplies power to the plant, and operations had to slow down while repairs were made. Environmental impact Minera√ß√£o Taboca made efforts to minimise environmental damage and to assist recovery of the mined areas. This includes building dams and dykes to hold tailings and to clarify water, replanting areas cleared for mining or road construction, creating drainage systems and so on. Tailings are held in holding ponds as a reserve that may be further processed if justified by a rise in the price of tin. In 1987 the dykes of four ponds broke. The sediment was released into the Alala√∫ River, and the pollution affected the fish downstream in the Waimiri-Atroari Indian Reserve. The Indians reported that the polluted water had made them ill. The company has researched ways of restoring the degraded areas, and has worked with the environmental agencies on plans for recovery. The plans include work by universities, research institutes and specialised companies. As of March 1991 the cost of environmental recovery was estimated at US$50 million.

Early life Born in Lakota, North Dakota on November 9, 1884, his family soon moved to Hope where he spent his formative years. Boise attended the University of North Dakota where he developed an interest in literature, publishing Varsity verse: A selection of undergraduate poetry written at the University of North Dakota with P.B. Griffith in 1908. After graduation Boise found work with the Santa Rita Mining Company in New Mexico. Mining career He gained employment with Formini√®re in the Belgian Congo in 1911, directing the exploration, mining and research operations at the company's Kasai diamond fields. He received promotion to Chief Engineer of the company and remained in the region throughout the First World War. Boise led prospecting expeditions in Southern Africa in 1914 and published Diamond fields of German South West Africa in the South African Mining Journal in July 1915 and The Vaal River diggings in Griqualand West in the Mining Magazine in 1916. After the war Boise established himself in London as a diamond mining consultant. In 1920 he made the first investigation of the diamond fields of the Gold Coast which led to the founding of the Consolidated African Selection Trust. He was also involved with opening the diamond fields in Sierra Leone and the exploration of Northern Rhodesia for copper, which resulted in the creation of the Rhodesian Selection Trust. In 1926 he applied for a British patent (with W. R. Degenhardt) for a machine that could disintegrate clay and mix sand, cement and other materials. He received a patent in the US for the machine in 1929. Boise retired in 1959. Emmetts Garden Boise purchased Emmetts Garden, an Edwardian estate in Kent, in 1927. He was particularly fond of the gardens and built a new rock garden, camelia garden and bluebell dell. His experience with malaria-carrying mosquitos, which thrive in standing water, may have been behind his decision to fill in many of the ponds at Emmetts in the 1930s. He left the gardens to the National Trust after his death.

The amendment would have the effect of limiting legislative tactics such as logrolling, earmarks, and pork barrel spending. It would also discourage the use of very long omnibus spending bills which are difficult for legislators to read and analyze in the time frame needed for a vote, and to which unrelated riders are often added late in the legislative process. As of 2016, 41 states have single-subject rules in their state constitutions, but the federal Congress has no such rule. Many of these state and local provisions are over a century old, and litigation is often used to enforce the provisions. The amendment is promoted by a 527 SuperPAC also called Single Subject Amendment, which is seeking passage of the amendment through either the Congressional route or through calling a convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution. A federal amendment was proposed as early as 1999 in a law journal article by Brannon Denning and Brooks R. Smith. The Florida Legislature in 2014 passed a memorial applying to Congress to call a convention for this purpose.

It presents contemporary and tribal Filipino arts. Its mission is to expand the understanding of American Filipino culture, through sponsoring productions and presentations in the United States. Through its programs of performances, visual arts, community dialogues, and festivals, the organization hopes to advance the spirit and integrity of ancestral Filipino art and cultures. History In 1985, musician Robert L. Henry, dancer Marcella Pabros, and choreographer/director Alleluia Panis founded Kulintang Arts, Inc., now known as Kularts. They chose \\"kulintang\\" in honor of the ancient music tradition of Mindanao, Philippines. Its first office and rehearsal space was in the South of Market Cultural Center in San Francisco. Kulintang Arts's primary program was the work of Kulintang Arts Ensemble (KAE), a ten-member music and dance ensemble which presented contemporary work rooted in the indigenous Filipino traditions. Danongan Kalanduyan, a musician from the Southern Philippines, was KAE's resident artist and kulintang music director/instructor (1985-88). KAE members included Musiban Guiabar, Frank Holder, Joey Maliga, Dana Nu√±ez, Anna Sun Foo, Frances Cachapero, Ric Serrano, Joshua Francisco, Daniel Giray, Sharon Sato, Jesse Bie, among others. Panis choreographed full-evening works: Ancient Rhythms/Urban Sounds (1988); Lm' Ehek: at the heART of the sharpenINg stONE (1989); Cycles: Timeless Rituals to Ancient Icons (1990); and Diwata (1993). KAE performed at the San Francisco Ethnic Dance Festival from 1985 to 1990 and toured nationally and internationally; including the Dance Theater Workshop, New York; Lincoln Center, New York City; the Kennedy Center; the Bumbershoot Festival, Seattle; the Verona Jazz Festival, Italy; the Baguio Arts Festival, the Philippines; and the Asian Arts Festival, Singapore. KAE Music recordings include Fred Ho's 1988 album A Song For Manong, originally released by Asian Improv. Recordings released by Kulintang Arts Inc. include Ancient Rhythms/Urban Sounds; Kulintang Arts Live! In Concert with Jon Jang; and Cycles: Timeless Rituals to Ancient Icons. By early 1992, serious stresses were beginning to affect the performing ensemble. The artists were suffering from burnout as a result of the grueling pace of creating, performing, and touring new works year after year. These stresses forced the leadership to reexamine the mix of Kulintang Arts's program activities, which, up until that time, focused on the KAE dance and music works. Kulintang Arts shifted it activities to presentations and project commissions. After 10 years of performances, creation of major works, national and international tours, KAE officially disbanded in 1995 and the organization Kulintang Arts Inc. took a different route, to become an organization for the commissioning and presentation of works by American Filipino and Philippine-based artists. Through this organizational restructuring, Kularts has developed emerging and established artists. Kulintang Arts Inc. took on the name Kularts to reflect the expansion of its program activities. Kularts is currently directed by Alleluia Panis at Bayanihan Community Center in San Francisco's SoMa Pilipinas.

In plotting his revenge, he manipulates and enslaves spirit deities into conjuring powerful typhoons to sink his enemy's ships off the island. Once shipwrecked, his enemies are separated throughout the island. The chieftain then places a spell on his daughter to seduce his enemy's son. This piece was created in 2014 by choreographer Jay Loyola and creative director/producer Alleluia Panis. Mas√©g is a reinterpretation of Shakespeare's The Tempest. Music was provided by Florante Aguilar, who played each of 17 instruments: guitar, kulintang, sarunai, hegelung, kagul, bungkaka, kubing, , bamboo flute, gambal, cajon, taiko, celesta, African shakers, Brazilian drums, and Logic Pro. Mas√©g: Typhoon premiered at the Brava Theater in San Francisco on November 15 and 16, 2014, and returned for an outdoor showing at the Yerba Buena Gardens in San Francisco on May 23, 2015, as part of the 1st Annual Ma'ARTES Festival and the 15th Annual Yerba Buena Gardens Festival. =Tribal tour= Since 2002, Kularts has provided a tribal tour, giving participants opportunities to explore and discover indigenous Filipino cultures of Mindanao. During the 12-day trip, participants engage in interactions with T'boli, B'laan, Maguindanaon, and Manobo tribal leaders, shamans, healers, and master artists in their ancestral homes. This trip takes participants to Davao del Sur, Sunggani, South Cotabato, and in Maguindanao. This experience allows for hands-on experience in the following subjects: * myths and ancient ways of knowing from the Southern Philippines * traditional rituals led by tribal shamans and ritualists * sacred and secular dances * craft-making through natural dyes, \\"dream weaving\\" of the t'nalak fabric, and \\"lost wax\\" gong- making techniques * a sampling of various Mindanoan cuisines throughout the Southern Philippines =She, Who Can See= She, Who Can See tells the story of a 4th-generation Filipina American whose family comes from a shamanic past and her struggles as she deals with her extraordinary abilities. Ancestral deities begin to appear in her dreams and throughout her life, turning her world upside down as she tries to live the life of a normal working-class Filipina woman. Alleluia Panis created this piece in 2015; it premiered at Bindlestiff Studios in the South of Market district of San Francisco as part of the inaugural Ma'ARTES Festival. Florante Aguilar composed the musical score for the piece, using traditional Philippine instruments and other instruments found across the globe. June Arellano created the costumes, combining cultural outfits into a modern interpretation of the Pilipino experience. Wilfred Galila served as the videographer. =Ma'ARTES Festival= In May 2015, Kularts, in partnership with the Filipino American Development Foundation and the API Cultural Center, created the Ma'ARTES Festival to promote Filipino artists throughout the Bay Area. The festival was inspired by the traditional festivals of the Philippines which celebrated the first of the monsoon rains ‚Äì a symbol of life and promise of the future. The festival hosted various forms of art, to celebrate and honor Filipino creativity, throughout the month of May. Events were hosted at five historically Filipino-American spaces: International Hotel's Manilatown Center; Bindlestiff Studio; Bayanihan Center; Yerba Buena Garden; and Gene Friend Rec & Park.

The law was introduced after calls urging the British Columbia provincial government to intervene in the housing market and curb foreign investment that was seen as a major contributor to the rapid rise in home prices. The Act has four parts: * Vacancy tax: Amendments to the Vancouver Charter to enable the City of Vancouver to impose a municipal vacancy tax on vacant residential property * Foreign-buyers tax: Amendments to the Property Transfer Tax Act, imposing an additional property transfer tax of 20% on all residential property purchased by foreign buyers * Amendments to the Real Estate Services Act discontinuing industry self-regulation of the real estate industry * Creating a new Housing Priority Initiatives special account to fund initiatives in respect to housing, rental, access, and support programs with the new tax revenues resulting from this law. History Vancouver's housing crisis goes back decades. In the late 1970s a book was written by economist Gordon Soules on the subject. At the time Vancouver's ratio of real-estate prices to local earnings was about 3 to 1. Soules interviewed Art Phillips, Bill Vander Zalm and Mike Harcourt for the book and all agreed that immigrants were driving up home prices and that the lax immigration to Canada rules should be tightened. Mike Harcourt also blamed Canadians from other provinces for the problem. Bill Vander Zalm blamed speculators. In 2016 Vancouver's housing was the third most unafforadable in the English-speaking world, with a ratio of real-estate prices to local earnings of 13 to one. Vancouver locals have been complaining for a long time about foreigners purchasing homes and displacing residents who find housing has become unaffordable, and may end up being homeless. There was also a concern expressed that housing purchased by foreigners stays vacant. So, on Aug 2, 2016, the British Columbia government introduced Bill 28. The Act was introduced as a surprise move by the Liberal provincial government. It was announced and went through a first reading on July 25, 2016 without advance notice. It went through second reading a day later, and a final reading by July 29, 2016. It became law on August 2, 2016. The amendments relating to the Property Transfer Tax Act became effective August 2, 2016, while the other legislative amendments have come into effect on the date of royal assent or by regulation of the Lieutenant Governor in Council. Aftermath According to Business News Network, Vancouver area sales dropped nearly 40 percent in October 2016 after the foreign buyers tax was introduced . [Bloomberg News] reported that Chinese international property portal [Juwai.com] saw Chinese buying inquiries in Vancouver drop by at least 25%. Questions of whether the BC government was taking sides against the older homeowners in favour of younger buyers were raised. According to The Globe and Mail, a recent poll determined that a third of boomer homeowner are planning to sell their homes and move to other parts of British Columbia in the next 5 years. According to The Province, in 2016 Vancouver residential prices moved up 18 per cent overall, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver, but cooled off just before the province imposed a 15 per cent foreign buyers tax in August. Towards the end of the year falling sales, and in some cases prices, dominated the housing market. According to The Province, two Victoria city councillors, Ben Isitt and Jeremy Loveday, wanted the foreign buyers tax also applied in the capital region. In addition, they wanted local municipalities to be given the authority to impose a tax on vacant properties. In 2018, the Foreign Buyer's Tax was extended to the Fraser Valley, Capital, Nanaimo, and Central Okanagan Regional Districts, at 20%. Speculation and Vacancy tax The charter was amended to enable the City of Vancouver to impose a municipal vacancy tax on vacant residential property. The number of homes sitting vacant in Vancouver is perceived as a problem. The province saw the tax as an important step in controlling the housing crisis in British Columbia, that has reported sky high rents and an extremely low vacancy rate. A city report pegged the number at 10,800 vacant homes and condos in Vancouver. The thought is that if properties are rented instead of sitting vacant, housing affordability would improve. A proposal by Vancouver's mayor, Gregor Robertson , to tax vacant homes required a change to Vancouver's charter. Robertson is hoping to increase the number of available rental units by encouraging homeowners to put vacant homes up for rent. The vacancy tax will collect $30 million in revenue for its first year. This revenue comes from the owners of 1,200 properties because the majority of properties deemed vacant have either received an exemption, are disputing their vacancy classification, or have not made a declaration regarding the status of their property. Foreign-buyers tax A new 20/15% tax was added to the Property Transfer Tax when a purchaser, who is not a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, purchases residential real estate property in Metro Vancouver. The tax is expected to add a large cost to foreign buyers of homes in Vancouver and increase tax revenue for the provincial government. Government figures showed that foreigners, mainly Chinese, have purchased $1 billion worth of real estate in British Columbia during a five-week period in 2016. When the tax was introduced, Christy Clark the Premier of British Columbia said: \\"There is evidence now that suggests that very wealthy foreign buyers have raised the price, the overall price of housing for people in British Columbia\\". Foreign buyers were blamed by Tom Davidoff of the University of British Columbia (UBC) for large increases in real estate prices experienced in Vanvouver. According to David Ley, also of UBC, taxing foreigners has slowed down rapid real estate appreciation in other countries. Real Estate Services Act The Real Estate Services Act was amended to end self-regulation of the real estate industry in British Columbia. Housing Priority Initiatives special account The Housing Priority Initiatives special account was created to hold the new tax revenues created by this law to fund initiatives in respect of homes rentals, access, and support programs. On September 14, 2016 The Province reported that the housing affordability plan will launch with almost half a billion dollars from windfall real estate taxes. The fund will be used to increase housing supply in the Lower Mainland On 16 September 2016, Michael de Jong, Minister of Finance for British Columbia announced that the government will spend $500 million on housing affordability, while also canceling the planned increase in MSP premiums and possibly increase Welfare rates.

HSX serves the greater Delaware Valley region, including southeastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey.[2]  Background  As a result of the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and other regional healthcare drivers, local planning for HSX began in the summer of 2011. The Health Care Improvement Foundation (HCIF), a regional quality improvement non-profit organization, joined with hospitals, health plans, physicians, government representatives, and safety-net providers to explore how a formalized health information organization could enable better care for patients in the region. Resulting from a number of healthcare market drivers and challenges, HealthShare Exchange was formed as a collaboration among major healthcare stakeholders, including health plans and the acute care hospitals across the five-county region of Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia counties. In May 2016, HSX was awarded a portion of a $3.8 million grant by the Pennsylvania eHealth Partnership Authority, which receives its funding through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Built between 1613 and 1624, the church is attributed to the architect Tommaso Dingli and it is regarded as the finest Renaissance church in Malta. It still retains its original design, with the exception of a belfry and two sacristies which were added in the 18th and 19th centuries. History The Parish Church of St. Mary was built between 1613 and 1624, and its design is attributed to the architect Tommaso Dingli. The sculptures within the church are the work of Dingli himself and Giovanni Attard. Although Dingli had planned a belfry in the church, this was not built until 1718‚Äì19. It is sometimes attributed to the architect Giovanni Barbara, but there is no proof supporting this claim. The belfry has five bells, which were founded between 1713 and 1830. The clock on the belfry was made by Michelangelo Sapiano in 1872. The church was dedicated on 7 May 1730. The sacristy was built in 1740, and its ceiling was decorated by master builder Karm Debono in 1902. Another sacristy was built between 1856 and 1857 under the direction of master builder Mikiel Mamo. This is now used as a crying room. The church's parvis was first built in 1891, but it was damaged during World War II and was rebuilt in 1958. The church is scheduled as a Grade 1 national monument, and it is also listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. Architecture The church and its belfry as viewed from the side The Parish Church of St. Mary is an example of Renaissance architecture, and it is regarded as the finest Renaissance church in Malta. It is attributed to the architect and sculptor Tommaso Dingli, and it is believed to be one of only two surviving churches which retain Dingli's original design, the other one being the old Parish Church of St. Mary in Birkirkara. The church's fa√ßade is framed by Corinthian pilasters, and it is topped by a triangular pediment. The main doorway is located in the centre of the fa√ßade, and the stonework around the portal and the capitals is very ornate, probably being influenced by the Spanish Plateresque style. Six niches containing statues of saints or Biblical figures decorate the fa√ßade, three on either side of the main doorway. The statues were sculpted by Francesco Saverio Sciortino in 1945. The church has a cruciform plan, with a dome and a belfry. It has a choir, two side chapels, a central aisle, two sacristies and ten altars. The ceiling of the aisle and the choir is decorated with frescoes.
