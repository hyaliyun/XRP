Because these engines were retired very early, from 1891 to 1898, their class number was reused for the six-coupled shunter introduced in 1898 and which later became the DRG Class 89.60. The original D II was the smallest standard gauge locomotive ever owned by the Bavarian State Railway. It was based on a design by Krauss which was delivered in numerous variants for different purposes to stations and construction firms. The boiler had a regulator housing behind the chimney instead of a steam dome from which the steam pipes ran to the cylinders on the outside of the boiler. The steam supply was controlled by an outside Allan valve gear. The engines ran on cast iron disc wheels and has a well tank, i.e. the space between sole bars of the locomotive frame was used for the water tank. The driver's cab initially had just a free-standing roof; later the engines were give a full cab with a roof that sloped towards the front. Four engines were delivered with the names: GEIER, STRAUSS, FUCHS and B√ÑR. The D II was used in the early 1870s on the Vizinalbahn lines from Siegelsdorf to Langenzenn, Immenstadt to Sonthofen and Georgensgm√ºnd to Spalt. B√ÑR was deployed to the Immenstadt to Sonthofen line, which had been opened in 1873, and STRAUSS was used on the line from Siegelsdorf to Langenzenn, to be joined later by the other engines.

It is one of the largest auditoriums in the city. It consists of the main hall for orchestral performances with 693 seats, and two smaller venues, the Golden Hall and the Blue Hall, for chamber music concerts.  Construction  The Krak√≥w Philharmonic Concert Hall was designed by architect J√≥zef Pokutynski, with neo-baroque elements inspired by the Brussels' Maison du Peuple. It was sponsored by Prince and Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha, and completed 1931. In 1996, a new 50-pipe organ was installed in the hall, replacing an older one by Karl Schuke. It was designed and built by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn, a family-run company specializing in large-scale projects across the globe. The concert hall is home of the Krak√≥w Philharmonic Orchestra as well as the chamber Capella Cracoviensis.  History Klais organ in the background The first serious attempts to create a resident symphony orchestra in the city go back to the 18th century. The professional team was assembled only in 1909 under the management of composer Feliks Nowowiejski (b. 1877). Since its creation under the foreign Partitions of Poland, and throughout the interwar period, the Krak√≥w Philharmonic maintained also the Polish Professional Musicians Trade Union for performers who worked around the city, including in caf√©s and in the silent movie theatres. The Union's goal was to protect the welfare of its members as well as the artistic level of their performances. Its main contribution to the local music culture was the organising of symphony concerts. The Philharmonic orchestra performed regularly until the Invasion of Poland in September 1939. During the occupation of Poland on the order of Hans Frank, the Nazi Governor of the semi-colonial General Government set up in Krak√≥w, a new Nur f√ºr Deutsche orchestra was formed in July 1940 under Gestapo chief Bruno M√ºller. It was called the General Government Symphony Orchestra. The Symphony Orchestra now residing in the Krak√≥w Philharmonic began in February 1945. It was the first professional symphony orchestra in postwar Poland, under Professor Zygmunt Latoszewski. Principal conductors and Music Directors of Krak√≥w Philharmonic in the past include Witold Rowicki, Prof. Krzysztof Penderecki, Gilbert Levine (1987‚Äì1993),\\"American Asked to Lead Cracow Philharmonic\\" New York Times September 29, 1987 Roland Bader of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Pawe≈Ç Przytocki (March 2009 - September 2012) (Managing Director and Artistic Director) and many other renowned artists.

William Preston Johnston, by Joseph Henry Bush William Preston Johnston (January 5, 1831 - July 16, 1899) was a lawyer, scholar, poet, and Confederate soldier. He was the son and biographer of Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston. He was a president of Louisiana State University and the first president of Tulane University from 1884 (Tulane being renamed from the University of Louisiana that year). Biography Johnston was born in Louisville, Kentucky, to Albert Sidney Johnston and Henrietta Preston Johnston. When he was four years old, his mother died; he was then reared by members of her family. Johnston attended several local schools, including the academy of Samuel Venable Womack in Shelbyville, Centre College in Danville, Western Military Institute in Georgetown, and Yale College. In March 1853, he received his law degree from the Louisville School of Law. On July 6, 1853, he married his first wife, Rosa Elizabeth Duncan, the daughter of John N. Duncan of New Orleans. During the American Civil War, Johnston served as an aide-de- camp to Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States. Johnston was a colonel in the Confederate Army. Johnston was captured with Jefferson Davis at Irwinville, Georgia, at the end of the war, and was imprisoned for several months at Fort Delaware. After the war (at the invitation of Robert E. Lee), he became a professor at Washington College in Virginia. In 1880, he became president of Louisiana State University, but resigned four years later to become the first president of the new Tulane University in 1884. Johnston wrote two books of poetry, My Garden Walk (1894) and Pictures of the Patriarchs and Other Poems (1895). He also wrote The Prototype of Hamlet and Other Shakespearean Problems (1890) as well as a biography of his father, The Life of General Albert Sidney Johnston (1878), a \\"most valuable and exhaustive biography\\". Johnston was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1893.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory His first wife died on October 19, 1885, and he married Margaret Henshaw Avery of Avery Island, Louisiana, in April 1888.

This was similar to the earlier Engerth design which articulated the tender with the main locomotive frame, allowing some of the weight of the fuel and water to be carried on the driving wheels to improve adhesion.

The preliminary research results on permanent magnetic shark repellents were reviewed, judged, and awarded the first place 2006 WWF SmartGear award.2006 WWF SmartGear award In 2008, the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (DPI&F;) and James Cook University (JCU), Australia confirmed that permanent (ferrite) magnets technology repel grey reef sharks, hammerheads, sharp-nosed sharks, blacktip sharks, the vulnerable sawfish and the critically endangered spear tooth shark. In 2014, SharkDefense partnered with SharkTec LLC to commercialize an aerosol semiochemical shark repellent product. Both companies are working to broaden the commercial use of SharkDefense's technologies. History SharkDefense was formed in September 2001 by Eric Stroud and Jean Stroud. Its research program began at the Oak Ridge Shark Laboratory with a search for trace chemical messengers present in decayed shark tissue. In 1943, Burden et al. from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) had reported that decayed shark tissue was successful at halting feeding in captive dusky smoothound sharks (Mustelis canis). In the efforts to develop and test a chemical shark repellent package led by Dr. Harold Coolidge of the Harvard Museum, the WHOI team selected ammonium acetate as the active in the decomposing shark tissue, however, instrumental analysis by the Oak Ridge Shark Lab in 2002 failed to find ammonium acetate. It was hypothesized by SharkDefense that ammonium acetate was an approximation of the ammonium cation (based on the ammonia-like smell of the shark tissue or a urea-urease reaction), and the acetate conjugate base (based on the acetic acid which WHOI had already found to have repellent properties). After 2002, many new compounds were found and catalogued by SharkDefense, who maintains a repellent compound database. Milestones 1\\\\.

While operating in the Caroline Islands, she was severely damaged when struck by what appeared to be a Japanese torpedo. However, she continued her work as well as she could, and, when she returned to the United States, she was considered too damaged to repair. She was sold in her damaged condition, and was eventually scrapped.

The net-layer reached Pearl Harbor on 27 August, delivered her tows, and subsequently pushed on for Majuro, in the Marshall Islands, where she arrived on 15 September. Assigned to Service Squadron 10, Viburnum shifted to Ulithi, in the Caroline Islands, soon afterwards. On 28 October 1944, Viburnum was tending the net installation at Doa Channel, Ulithi. Late that morning, she picked up a net section from the depot ship Tuscana (AKN-3) and proceeded to stretch a double net section early in the afternoon. =Struck by a Japanese mine= At 1457, a sudden, violent explosion blew the port side of the forecastle deck upward, and the ship's commanding officer, Lt. Smith, ordered all hands to stand by to abandon ship. The blast had killed two men and blown a dozen others over the side. The latter were swiftly rescued by a boat from Volans (AKS-9). Arapaho (ATF-68) came alongside Viburnum at 1550, joined shortly afterwards by Zuni (ATF-95); the latter consequently moored the stricken net-layer alongside the destroyer tender Dixie (AD-14) for a thorough check of the damage. The ensuing investigation revealed that a Japanese submarine mine had blown a hole in the starboard side of the ship extending 10 frames' length (from frame 10 to frame 20) and to a point within five feet of the main deck. The explosion had broken the keel, and the hole extended about eight feet up from the keel on the port side. In ensuing days, a work crew from ARB-6 cleared away the wreckage, and the ship's force recovered the bodies of the two men killed. From November 1944 to January 1945, Viburnum received repairs from Jason (ARH-1) and Vestal (AR-4) before she was docked in floating drydock AFDL-32 and repaired enough to resume active operations about 9 February 1945. =End-of-war operations= Viburnum remained at Ulithi, performing limited harbor work in a protected harbor into the spring of 1945. She sailed for the west coast of the United States on 9 May, stopped briefly at Pearl Harbor en route, and arrived at San Francisco, California, on 5 June. Post-war evaluation and disposition Due to the heavy workload on west coast yards for repairs to damaged combatant vessels, the Navy did not desire full restoration of Viburnum. Accordingly, the net-laying ship was decommissioned and placed in an \\"in-service\\" status on 12 July 1945. Viburnum was placed out of service on 3 January 1946, and her disposal was authorized on 17 January. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 21 January, and the former net-layer was transferred to the United States Maritime Commission on 12 August 1947. The vessel was simultaneously delivered to Walter K. Wilms and Co., at Suisun Bay, and was probably scrapped soon afterwards.

Peter Benson's Daughter; April 6, 1823 ‚Äì November 1, 1908) was an American educator, poet, author, and editor. Remembered for her poem \\"Little Things\\", many of her poems were set to music and published in school textbooks, and used in church hymn-books for more than half a century. She died November 1, 1908, in Galesburg, Illinois. Carney had charge of the \\"Poet's Corner\\" in the Boston Trumpet. She furnished articles, both prose and verse, for the Christian Freeman when it was established. Something by her appeared in almost every number of the Rose of Sharon, and also in the Lily of the Valley. In the Universalist Miscellany, her articles bore the pen name of \\"Rev. Peter Benson's Daughter\\". In 1840, she commenced writing for the Ladies' Repository, under the signature of \\"Julia.\\" She was a regular contributor to the Boston Olive Branch. She also wrote two volumes, published by J. M. Usher, entitled Gifts from Julia, and a series of Sunday school question books. Poetry of the Seasons was published by Abel Tompkins. Early years and education Julia Abigail Fletcher was born April 6, 1823 in Lancaster, Massachusetts. She inherited patriotism from Revolutionary ancestors, being a granddaughter of Major Timothy Fletcher, of Lancaster, Massachusetts, and of Major Moses Warren, of Jay, Maine. She had no recollection of a time when she did not express her thoughts in verse. Her older brothers and sister were happy to write down her rhymes many years before she learned to do it herself. Her earliest sorrow was the opinion of a maiden aunt, freely expressed to her mother, that \\"if she let that child go on writing verses, she would never be good for anything else.\\" This advice led to a maternal injunction, \\"Never let me see any more of your poetry.\\" Subsequently, the mother found her daughter's rhymes hidden in the attic and repealed the injunction. Several years of invalidism, the result of scarlet fever at the age of eight years, interfered with her education, but from her couch, she read through the libraries of the neighborhood. Her first works of verse were published in the Lancaster and Concord local papers at the age of fourteen. Educated at Lancaster Academy, her school compositions, chiefly in verse, were sent regularly to several papers and magazines in Boston, whose editors were pleased with the youthful effusions, and constantly encouraged her to write. Career When seventeen, she went to Philadelphia, where her married sister resided, and there remained two years, teaching in a private school. Returning to Massachusetts to the home of her parents, she served a summer's apprenticeship in the district school, where she attracted commendation from the committee by keeping a formerly unruly school in good order without corporal punishment. During her life as a teacher, she wrote many poems and sketches, most of them for radical papers with reform ideas, and also a series of Sunday school instruction books, which were used for many years in liberal churches, until Lesson Papers superseded the use of textbooks. In 1844, she was elected teacher of one of the primary schools in Boston, where she continued to teach until her marriage in the spring of 1849. From 1849, her writing was chiefly prose, and for the Phrenological Journal, Science of Health, Midland Monthly, and our various denominational papers, especially the New Covenant. In 1869 and 1870, she conducted the \\"Home and Fireside\\" department of the New York National Agriculturist, and the Bee- Keepers‚Ä≤ Journal. As she was expected to fill several columns with continued novelties, she surprised her readers with a variety of signatures, including: \\"Minnie May,\\" \\"Frank Fisher,\\" \\"Sadie Sensible,\\" and \\"Minister's Wife\\". Her signature of \\"Julia,\\" however, though known to her friends, was usually dropped by those who copied her articles, and so it happened that those finding favor with the public went the rounds of paper, magazine, and schoolbook, many of them in the books from which she herself taught, without credit, some of them marked \\"Anon.\\" As a writer, using too many signatures became a serious mistake, not only taking parts of her real name, sometimes her husband's, but fictitious ones. This was done, partly to give variety, when under engagement to fill a certain number of columns of \\"Home and Fireside\\" department in a New York City monthly, and partly as a minister's wife, who wanted to criticise the relations of pastor and people without giving offense. She was deeply interested in the reform movements of the time, and often wrote on their behalf. She was also actively engaged in Sunday school work, and was well known as a writer for children. In later life, she wrote chiefly in prose, short sketches of real life, or essays upon temperance, and other serious subjects. Personal life In 1849, she married Rev. Thomas J. Carney (1818‚Äì1871), a Universalist minister. After a year's residence in Maine, and another in Cooperstown, New York, they took up their home in the West. Here, amid the many duties of pioneer life, and the care of little children, she seldom had time for writing. In 1871, the family had removed to Apple Creek Prairie, Illinois where the people had commenced a church under his ministry. He left home on horseback, and was returning to observe their wedding anniversary, when he was thrown from his horse. At first, it was supposed the injury would detain him at home for a few weeks, and he was sure of a speedy recovery; but soon, the lesion of a vein in his back caused unconsciousness from which he never recovered. He died May 4, 1871, and was buried at White Hall, Illinois. The widow was still in mourning when her son William, age 20, died suddenly of sunstroke. Four other children had died in infancy, leaving one daughter and three sons still with her. She moved in with her oldest son, Fletcher Carney, an attorney of Galesburg, Illinois, but made frequent visits to her younger son, Rev. James W. Carney, of Holyoke, Massachusetts.

Geography San Carlos is far from Asunci√≥n at 589 km, 90 km from the Brazilian port of the same name \\"San Carlos do Apa\\" and 200 km from Concepci√≥n. It is located on the border with Brazil. Climate The maximum temperature reaches 40 degrees in summer, while the minimum in winter is up to minus 2 degrees. The average is 24 degrees Celsius. The rainfall times are plentiful from November to January, and the driest months are from June to September. Winds are from the north, east and southeast. Demographics San Carlos has a total of 690 inhabitants, of which 438 are men and 252 women. In urban areas there are 444 people and in rural areas 246. Economy Residents of San Carlos are principally engaged in livestock and agriculture. The city is a reserve of clover plantation. San Carlos has a landing field for light aircraft. Getting there You reach the city by the west through farms, and by the east, passing through agricultural settlements, such as Colony Jose Felix Lopez, \\"Puentesi√±o\\" and Paso Bravo National Park. It has runways for air transport. It is located 680 km north of Asunci√≥n. History The Fortress of San Carlos was built in 1796 by order of Governor of Paraguay, Don Joaquin de Alos y Bru, years after the founding of the Villa Real de la Concepcion, on a small hill a few metres from the Apa River, with the aim of defending the region against the advance of bandits and Mbaya√©s Indians allied with the conquerors from Brazil. There, several battles were fought. The Governor sent the commander of Villa Real de Concepci√≥n, Don Luis Bernardo Ramirez on an expedition to establish a fort on the banks of River Apa. It also had barracks, housing, oratory, storage and cooking places for the soldiers guarding it. It is a sign of the presence of Spaniards since late 1700 and the government of Jos√© Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia. During the Paraguayan War there were fought several battles at the site, in 1867, Cnel. Urbieta defeated Brazilian troops and thus regained control of the fort. Tourist attractions San Carlos is considered historic and touristic, because the ruins of Fort San Carlos del Apa are located there, scenario of numerous battles. The fort has high walls surrounding it and nowadays it receives many tourists. Another attraction of San Carlos is its exuberant nature. The Caxoeira hills, Brazil, and the Cerro Paiva, Paraguay, complement the beautiful landscape next to River Apa. In the river it is possible to navigate and fish. The Fortress of San Carlos is a historical heritage of both Paraguay, and Brazil. It is very close to the Mato Grosso.

Estigarribia and Iturbe St. in Asuncion, the capital city of Paraguay, displays over 650 works of art, paintings, sculptures, ceramics, prints, photographs, Paraguayan and international artists. As well as antique coins, furniture and various objects that belonged to its creator. The museum was founded in 1909 by the collector Silvano Godoi, first director general of Museums and archives Paraguay. In the same building is the National Archives, which houses the largest collection of documents relating to the country's history. History=Arts in Paraguay= Unlike other Latin American countries, which began after the Conquest a virtually continuous production and valuation of works of art, in Paraguay, the evolution of the arts in general was marked by the bumpy course of its history. The rich tradition of craftsmanship ethnicities populated the various territories that make up the country today, had no impact recognized during the colonization process. However, the arrival of the Franciscan and Jesuit missionaries marked a gradual transformation in music, architecture and, more importantly, at the height of images, which played a decisive role the ability of native craft. After the expulsion of the Society of Jesus and the decline in the Franciscan presence, there was a sudden interruption in artistic production. This situation only began to change timidly in the 19th century with the emergence of two Paraguayan painters: Saturio Rios and Aurelio Garcia, whose arrival coincided with European architects and builders who helped define the urban profile of the city of Asunci√≥n, capital of the new republic. Although the Paraguayan War (1864‚Äì1870) hindered the development of the arts, it offered an ideal scenario for the cultivation of satirical illustration. Journals Cabichu√≠ and El Centinela, edited and printed on the front, represent two priceless examples, both from a historical point of view as aesthetic. For the impression his illustrations, both used the technique of etching, taking Gregorio C√°ceres as one of its main creators. The massive influx of immigrants, among them several European artists, scored a valuable imprint on the development of national art. The Italian Guido Boggiani, discovers the indigenous art; academic H√©ctor Da Ponte, is dedicated to the training of young, and French July Mornet, remained seven years in Paraguay, where, among other activities, held a number of paintings that adorned the ceiling of Palace Lopez. Thanks to the efforts of Guido Boggiani and the collaboration of some cultural institutions, several young artists, Carlos Colombino, Juan Samudio, among others, had the opportunity to access scholarships in Italy, where he perfected his techniques in various schools of academic orientation. Upon his return, were devoted mainly to painting landscapes and portraits. =Juan Silvano Godoy= For those same years, Juan Silvano Godoi, (1850‚Äì1926) a politician wealthy Paraguayan family, is given the task of shaping the first collection of plastic arts that come to the country. Due to the difficulties of Paraguayan politics, was forced to travel abroad on numerous occasions, which provided it with the purchase of a valuable collection of paintings and sculptures, among which works outstand Courbet, Murillo, Tintoretto, among others. Juan Silvano Godoi tilted mainly toward the late 19th-century painting, ranging from simple naturalism and academicism. His collection also was enriched by artists from Rio de la Plata. In the early years of the 20th century, the Paraguayan Government expressed the wish that all his works, were reunited within an institution, thereby laying the foundations for the current National Museum of Fine Arts. The Museum Godoy was finally established in 1909 under the direction of itself Godoy, until his death. In 1939, the institution was formalized by the State as National Museum of Bellas Artes. Consolidation phase The works acquired by Juan Silvano Godoi come from artists of the 17th century, Italian and French half of 19th century, creators of Argentines who acquired some significance in subsequent decades and, of course, a whole generation of painters Paraguayans: Andres Campos Cervera, Carlos Colombino, Juan Samudio, Jaime Bestard, Holden Roberto Jara, Pablo Alborno, Modesto Delgado Rodas and Ignacio N√∫√±ez Soler, representatives of a school still in its infancy, but vibrant forces and energies. Among the works of Paraguayan artists stand out the collection of drawings Miguel Acevedo, a satirical vision of the so-called belle √©poque and its characters, composed of fifty- seven original works, considered one of the series more important that the museum owns. From the year 1989 saw a new relationship with the museum's public opening exhibitions of national and foreign artists, performing and organizing various educational and cultural activities, which have earned him recognition by the new generations. Memorable have proved exhibitions of Japanese photographer Daisaku Ikeda, the sample of German contemporary graphic display of fabrics and ethnic Bolivians.

The band was founded (sans a vocalist) in Monroe, Louisiana by members Layne Meylain, Mason Crooks, Brad Thompson, and Mike Butler. They relocated to Murfreesboro, TN to look for a frontman and found Jessie Freeland. The group derived their name (as a joke) from celebrity Tony Danza, upon one of his professions being tapdancing. The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza released four studio albums before disbanding in 2012. History The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza was founded in 2004. They chose their band name after actor Tony Danza; the humorous moniker is occasionally misinterpreted, as older concertgoers have attended shows in hopes of seeing Danza himself. The group signed with Corrosive Recordings in 2005 after self-releasing their debut album. Their second release, Danza II: Electric Boogaloo, was issued in 2007 on Black Market Activities. The album's name is a parody of the Danzig album, Danzig II: Lucifuge, as well as the 1980s film Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo. The album features short, humorous skits interspersed with the songs making fun of their surroundings growing up. The group has toured with Cattle Decapitation, Arsonists Get All the Girls, Veil of Maya, Full Blown Chaos, Despised Icon, The Acacia Strain, Beneath the Massacre, Unearth, See You Next Tuesday, The Red Chord, Shai Hulud, Psyopus, The Number 12 Looks Like You, Lye By Mistake, A Life Once Lost, and Emmure, among others. In March 2008, the band crashed their tour van after playing a show in Lewisville, Texas. Former member Brad Thomson founded Midgets with Machetes, a record label distributed by Uprising Records. On September 24, 2009, the band announced that Layne Meylain and Mike Butler had amicably left the group. At the same time, the band formally announced their next album, Danza III: A Series of Unfortunate Events. The album focuses on lyrical themes such as personal, social, political and global \\"unfortunate events\\" tied around the three musical themes of technical, groove-based and ambient music. It was recorded in November 2009 with Jeremiah Scott and Steve Blackmon. The band released their third album, Danza III: The Series of Unfortunate Events, on July 6, 2010. On the record, Josh Travis performs lead and rhythm guitar on an 8-string guitar as well as the bass. It also marks the first album by the band to include drummer Mike Bradley. The songs \\"I Am Sammy Jankis\\" and \\"The Union\\" were released as singles. During May 2011, the band confirmed that Danza IIII is in the works. In the meantime of its creation, guitarist Josh Travis has joined Jerry Roush's new band Glass Cloud as a side-project with their debut album, The Royal Thousand, being released on July 3, 2012. On October 16, 2012, their album Danza IIII: The Alpha ‚Äì The Omega was released. Dave Mustein of MetalSucks gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars, stating, \\"Danza's bottom end is the single most unified element on The Alpha The Omega. There's no denying that previous Danza releases are heavy[...] but the record's heaviness is primarily due to the fact that all the instrumentation on the album was performed by rhythmic mastermind Joshua Travis[...] The production holds it all together, sounding gritty but professional, digital but uncompressed,\\" but criticized the band for falling \\"into the trap of writing filler; the numerous samples begin to run together, decreasing the impact of songs like Hold the Line. And it's almost impossible to sit through the entirety of the glitchy, gimmicky Some Things Are Better Left Unsaid.\\" On August 23, 2012, Joshua Travis made this statement, regarding Danza's future: \\"For this album, Jessie and I were looking to create more of a visceral vibe than a completely technical vibe. There's parts that do still get a bit chaotic of course, but not nearly as much as the avid listener is used to. Everything about this record is way more to the point, with much more heart put into it rather than just seeing how many notes could be thrown into a part or seeking to create 'the heaviest shit ever' or any of that nonsense. The record being titled The Alpha ‚Äì The Omega, to us symbolized the beginning and the end of Danza. Jessie and I hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed creating it for you all.\\" The band's breakup has led the members to pursue different careers.

Plot  Three girls, a down-and- out stripper named Trixie, a drug-running killer and ex-convict named Camero, and a corporate powerbroker nicknamed Hel, arrive at a remote desert hideaway to extort massive riches from a ruthless sword-wielding killer named Pinky, who is also a notorious underworld figure. None of the three women is who they appear to be: each has an ulterior motive. They kidnap a gangster called Gage and try to force him to reveal where the treasure is buried. He refuses, believing they will kill him anyway, but Hel promises he will not be harmed. Camero shoots him, against the wishes of Hel, saying she made no such promise. His phone rings, and they believe Gage is connected to Pinky. Things become more complicated when a police officer named Deputy Fuchs arrives. Unknown to them, he was in the audience five nights ago when Trixie performed as a stripper to seduce Gage. However, the three women hide the body and are able to convince Fuchs to leave. While digging for the treasure, Camero asks the girls about the best sex each has ever had, believing the answer tells her something important about their character. She admits her best sex ever was with a circus contortionist, although she did not even know the contortionist's name. During a water fight, Trixie falls onto something in the sand. They dig; however, instead of buried treasure they find the dead body of one of Hel's contacts. Trixie goes into the trailer to collect herself as Hel follows her to check on her, only for Trixie to seduce Hel into kissing her, which leads to them having sex until Camero catches them in the act. They are interrupted by Hot Wire and his girlfriend Kinki, whom Camero is familiar with. At gunpoint, the two abuse the women and force them to dig for the buried treasure. Deputy Fuchs returns and attempts to save the women, but instead creates a gunfight, which Hel ends with a high-powered machine gun found in the nearby trailer. Camero asks the meaning of the code Hel uses on the bunker \\"75650\\". At closer inspection it appears that the number 1 is associated with the letter A, 2 with BCD, 3 with E, 4 is with FGH, 5 is with IJK, 6 is with LMN, 7 is with OPQ, 8 is with RST, 9 is with UVW and 0 is with XYZ. With this info the code numbers spell \\"PINKY\\" Hel and Trixie find a concealed bunker full of goods stolen from Pinky, including a mysterious weapon, diamonds, and a beautiful sword, which Trixie takes. Camero, believing she is in the midst of a double-cross, fights Hel for the diamonds. Camero overcomes Hel and sets Trixie afire along with barrels of flammable liquids. Camero leaves Hel in chains while she attempts to drive away with the diamonds; however, Hel quickly uses the super-machine gun to free herself, and fires a rocket that destroys the car Camero was driving. Hel admits to Trixie that she is a secret agent who reports to a man named Phoenix, and that she is on a mission to retrieve the weapon they found in Pinky's lair. Camero returns and again fights Hel. After she beats Hel to the ground, Camero assumes she is dead and moves to kill Trixie. As Trixie will not fight back, Camero attempts to rape her, but stops when she sees a tattoo and realizes Trixie was the mysterious contortionist from her past. Before she can kill Trixie, Camero is shot in the back and killed by Deputy Fuchs, who managed to survive the explosion. However, instead of thanking him, Trixie kills Fuchs using a hidden throwing star. Hel awakens, having survived Camero's attack. Trixie then reveals that she, in fact, is Pinky, and concocted the entire plot to retrieve the sword she took from Gage's bunker, which he had taken from her six months previously.

It is one of the most common to affect the sweet potato, happening during packing and shipping. The disease causes a watery soft rot of the internal portion of the storage root. Strategies to manage the disease include the development of resistant varieties, curing through the use of heat and humidity, and application of decay control products.  Background  Sweet potatoes are susceptible to a number of diseases during the postharvest storage period and during shipping.Harter, L.L., Weimer, J.L, and Adams, J.M.R. 1918. Sweet-potato storage rots. Journal of Agricultural Research 15:337-368.Clark, C.A. and Moyer, J.W. 1988. Compendium of sweet potato diseases. APS Press, St. Paul, MN. 74pp. The most common are Rhizopus soft rot (Rhizopus stolonifer), bacterial soft rot (Erwinia chrysanthemii), Fusarium root rot (Fusarium solani), Fusarium surface rot (Fusarium oxysporum), and black rot (Ceratocystis fimbriata). R. stolonifer is a problematic pathogen as it infects fresh wounds occurring during packing and shipping. There is limited data on the exact losses attributed to Rhizopus soft rot. A study conducted in the New York City retail market found that the majority of culls due to disease were caused by Rhizopus soft rot (approximately 2% decay in survey).Ceponis, M.J. and Butterfield, J.E. 1974. Retail and consumer losses in sweet potatoes marketed in metropolitan New York. HortScience 9:393-394. Anecdotal reports suggest that Rhizopus soft rot is unpredictably sporadic and generally results in heavy losses to entire shipments when it does occur. R. stolonifer has a wide host range and can affect over 300 plant species including fruits, vegetables, and ornamentals.Farr, D.F., Rossman, A.Y., Palm, M.E., & McCray, E.B. (n.d.). Fungal Databases, Systematic Botany & Mycology Laboratory, ARS, USDA. Retrieved May 3, 2007, from . R. stolonifer (Ehrenb. ex Fr.) (syn R. nigricans) was first described in 1818 and first recognized as a pathogen on sweetpotato in 1890.Lunn, J.A. 1977. Rhizopus stolonifer. CMI descriptions of pathogenic fungi and bacteria. No. 524. Kew, Surrey, England: Commonwealth Mycological Institute. 2pp.Halstead, B.D. 1890. Some fungous diseases of the sweet potato. New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station. Bulletin 76.  Symptoms and signs  Symptoms of R. stolonifer infection of sweet potatoes include rapid development of a watery soft rot of the internal portion of the storage root with the periderm generally remaining intact. Infection can occur anywhere on the root but usually initiates at the ends due to the inevitable wounding resulting from harvest, or because a root's tapered ends are more likely to be injured. A milder infection of R. stolonifer occurring away from the ends results in ring rot or collar rot, in which the pathogen typically only causes rotting in a portion of the root. This rotting forms a relatively superficial dry ring around the root. Rhizopus soft rot produces a characteristic fermentation odor. Roots may dry and mummify with only the periderm and root fibers remaining intact because of the inability of the fungus to break down the lignin in these components. Characteristic signs of Rhizopus soft rot include the production of tufts of white hyphae which break through the surface of the root and produce large numbers of brown-black sporangiophores (34 ¬µm diam. by 1000-3500 ¬µm length) which support a sporangium (100-350 ¬µm diam.). Sporangiospores (4-11 ¬µm diam) are produced in the sporangium and are unicellular, ovoid and brown. Sporangiospores serve as the primary inoculum and are passively released when the outer layer of the sporangium breaks down. Other R. stolonifer structures include stolons and rhizoids. Stolons arch over the surface and rhizoids grow into the substrate at each point of contact between stolon and substrate. Sexual recombination is rare and occurs when mycelium of two compatible strains come in contact. Progametangia from each strain grow towards each other and fuse into gametangia, forming a thick-walled zygospore. Zygospores germinate to form sporangiophores bearing a single sporangium. R. stolonifer is incapable of breaching the intact root periderm and requires a wound to initiate infection. The type of wound influences infectivity, with smooth wounds less likely to be infected than impact bruise/crushed tissue wounds.Lauritzen, J.I. 1935. Factors affecting infection and decay of sweet potatoes by certain storage rot fungi. Journal of Agricultural Research 50:285-329.Srivastava, D.N. and Walker, J.C. 1959. Mechanisms of infection of sweet potato roots by Rhizopus stolonifer. Phytopathology 49(7):400-406.Clark, C.A. and Hoy, M.W. 1994. Identification of resistance in sweetpotato to Rhizopus soft rot using two inoculation methods. Plant Disease 78:1078‚Äì1082.Holmes, G.J. and Stange, R.R. 2002. Influence of wound type and storage duration on susceptibility of sweetpotatoes to Rhizopus soft rot. Plant Disease 86:345-348. It has been suggested that smooth wounds (slices or scrapes) lack the quantity of nutrients required for spore germ tube formation. No research has been completed to identify the degree of impact bruising required for infection to be initiated. Disease management Effective management strategies for Rhizopus soft rot on sweetpotato include planting resistant varieties in well- drained soil, preventing injury through handling and transport, crop rotation, proper curing after harvest, and decay control product applications on packinglines. =Resistant varieties= The sweet potato industry readily accepts new cultivars, which leads to a quick shift in the most widely grown cultivar. Beauregard, released in 1987, is currently the dominant cultivar grown in the U.S.Rolston, L.H., Clark, C.A., Cannon, J.M., Randle, W.M., Riley, E.G., Wilson, P.W. and Robbins, M.L. 1987. Beauregard Sweet-potato. HortScience 22(6):1338‚Äì1339. Beauregard is considered to be moderately resistant to R. stolonifer although sporadic, heavy losses during shipping are known to occur. No cultivar has been found that is completely resistant to Rhizopus soft rot. = Curing = Curing immediately after harvest generally eliminates losses to R. stolonifer by healing wounds occurring during harvest. The current recommended curing process is to expose the roots to high temperature at and high relative humidity of 90% for five to seven days.Kushman, L.J. 1975. Effect of injury and relative humidity on weight and volume loss of sweet potatoes during curing and storage. HortScience 10:275-277. Curing induces suberization of wounds followed by new periderm formation (this process was called wound \\"cork\\" or \\"phellum\\" in early research), effectively healing the wounds.Weimer, J.L. and Harter, L.L. 1921. Wound-cork formation in the sweet potato. Journal of Agricultural Research 21:637-647. = Decay control products = R. stolonifer is most commonly managed by packing line applications of dicloran (also known as DCNA or Botran). Dicloran, a chlorinated nitro-aniline, is a broad spectrum fungicide registered for postharvest use on sweet potatoes and in-field use for several fruits, vegetables, and ornamentals. However, the application of such a fungicide directly on the product raises significant concern for regulatory agencies and consumers. There has been a growing interest in the use of biological control organisms for control of postharvest diseases of fruits and vegetables. Control of Rhizopus soft rot of sweet potatoes by biological control products has been variable.

It won the \\"Most Original Game\\" award at the Russian Game Developers Conference, KRI in 2007. The game was released in English-speaking regions on October 23, 2009, and then as a digital download on Steam since December 16, 2009. Synopsis The player takes on the role of a lost soul that accidentally lingers in a place called \\"the Void\\" before meeting its absolute death. The Void is a purgatory- like place, in which the most valuable thing is Color, a liquid that represents lifeforce. Color is scarce, and the void's inhabitants are plagued by famine. These inhabitants are beautiful naked Sisters and monstrously deformed Brothers; two conflicting factions that the player must interact with. Color is a universal resource in the game ‚Äî it functions as the player's health, armor, stats and ammo. With the help of Nameless Sister, the player finds out that there is a way to escape the void and be reincarnated on the \\"surface\\", but in order to do this the player must disguise himself as one of the Brothers and eventually confront them. Over time, the Brothers will reveal themselves later in the game. These Brothers are: Mantid, the \\"Elder\\" of the Brothers, who walks on stilts, and has a spear impaled in his abdomen. Whaler, who wields two blades, and his head is sewn onto his back. Pit, who is fused with a mining drill. Ironclad, who has multiple cannons that fire at the player. Tyrant, who has several limbs and heads along with three visible hearts, and rolls along on a stone wheel. Caterpillar, who is connected to a rolling sphere(s) through tubes in his abdominal area. Warden, who forms a cage made of his ribs, and hangs from the ceiling like a swinging birdcage. Montgolfier, who, in the Russian version, had hair, but in the English version, doesn't. He is fused with a hot air balloon. Triumphator, who is fused with a large, gear-powered phonograph, and acts as a one-man band. And lastly, Patriarch, the oldest of the Brothers, who is similar to a senior in a wheelchair, and appears to have no head. The Brothers, depending on the player's actions, may feel aggressive, unsure, or sympathetic for the protagonist. Patriarch and Montgolfier are said by the other Brothers to be the most fond of him, followed by Caterpillar and Triumphator. Tyrant and Warden are probably the most domineering of the Brothers, along with Pit and Whaler, who assess the player negatively. Mantid and Ironclad are generally neutral, although their behavior may change from the player's actions. Gameplay The Void is played from a first-person perspective. Color, the character's primary resource, exists \\"naturally\\" in the Void as Lympha. However, collected Lympha of Color cannot be used directly and must be processed in the hero's Hearts first, where it is slowly drained out, becoming Nerva. Each Heart also corresponds to a glyph; more complex game actions are done by drawing Nerva-infused glyphs on screen using the mouse. When drawing a glyph, time slows down to allow the player to carefully draw it. Typical game actions are talking to NPCs, fighting predators or Brothers, collecting plants and growing gardens. The Color inside Hearts also acts as the hero's health and character stats. There are seven Colors at the player's disposal ‚Äî Silver, Gold, Violet, Azure, Crimson, Amber and Emerald ‚Äì each one having its own properties while inside Hearts and how they affect the Void when used; for example, Gold increases the Sisters' trust while inside Hearts, lowering the amount of Color required to open their hearts, but when used in the Void it incites jealousy in the Brothers, making them more prompt to rip opened hearts out of the Sisters. The strategic part of the game takes place on the map of the Void. The Void consists of several domains associated with specific Sisters. Each domain in turn consists of several chambers. When the player is on the map, time flows and the hero processes Color in his Hearts. If no Color is left inside, the hero will die. Time stops when the player is in a chamber, so that the player can explore locations without time pressure. The game has a fixed time limit of 35 cycles (a cycle represents a rough equivalent to an in- game day). New Color appears at the beginning of a new cycle, but what color that cycle brings is random. Reception Overall, the game has received positive reviews in Russia and abroad, with the exception being the Polish press, that played the non-director's cut edition. The German version, the director's cut of the Russian version, received more favorable reactions ranging from medium to high scores. In the first international reviews the game got high scores, and enthusiastic praise from Rock, Paper, Shotgun. In the first English-language review, Resolution claimed it to be rarely fun, but offering \\"a viciously beautiful, enormously interesting experience.\\" Rock, Paper, Shotgun wrote an overwhelmingly positive review, saying \\"The Void is the most important game you are GOING TO FUCKING PLAY.\\" =Piracy= The Void was noted in Russia for its developers' reaction to piracy. When the game appeared on the largest Russian torrents.ru tracker, the developers talked to the downloaders in the thread, answered game related questions and encouraged them to buy the game, if they liked it. Also, the developers made an official torrent containing all bonus material from the gift edition. Editions and titles The game was released in several countries under different titles and with minor and major changes. * Turgor ‚Äî the initial Russian release, on April 17, 2008. This edition is available in the form of a two-DVD jewel box, a gift edition and a digital download. The bonus disk contains a full soundtrack, all the trailers ever made for the game, Nikolay Dybowskiy's recordings from KRI, a game music video about Pathologic, and artwork from the game. Though this edition was only released in Russian, there is an official subtitle patch available from one of the developers. * Tension ‚Äî the working English title of the game and the official title in Poland.

It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration and wikis for every project. Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018. GitHub offers its basic services free of charge. Its more advanced professional and enterprise services are commercial. Free GitHub accounts are commonly used to host open-source projects. As of January 2019, GitHub offers unlimited private repositories to all plans, including free accounts, but allowed only up to three collaborators per repository for free. Starting from April 15, 2020, the free plan allows unlimited collaborators, but restricts private repositories to 2,000 actions minutes per month. As of January 2020, GitHub reports having over 40 million users and more than 190 million repositories (including at least 28 million public repositories), making it the largest host of source code in the world.  History  GitHub at AWS Summit The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008. The company, GitHub, Inc., has existed since 2007 and is located in San Francisco. The shading of the map illustrates the number of users as a proportion of each country's Internet population. The circular charts surrounding the two hemispheres depict the total number of GitHub users (left) and commits (right) per country. On February 24, 2009, GitHub announced that within the first year of being online, GitHub had accumulated over 46,000 public repositories, 17,000 of which were formed in the previous month. At that time, about 6,200 repositories had been forked at least once and 4,600 had been merged. That same year, the site was harnessed by over 100,000 users, according to Github, and had grown to host 90,000 unique public repositories, 12,000 having been forked at least once, for a total of 135,000 repositories. In 2010, GitHub was hosting 1 million repositories. A year later, this number doubled. ReadWriteWeb reported that GitHub had surpassed SourceForge and Google Code in total number of commits for the period of January to May 2011. On January 16, 2013, GitHub passed the 3 million users mark and was then hosting more than 5 million repositories. By the end of the year, the number of repositories were twice as much, reaching 10 million repositories. In 2012, GitHub raised $100 million in funding from Andreessen Horowitz with $750 million valuation. Peter Levine, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, stated that GitHub had been growing revenue at 300% annually since 2008 \\"profitably nearly the entire way\\". On July 29, 2015, GitHub stated it had raised $250 million in funding in a round led by Sequoia Capital. Other investors of that round included Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, and IVP (Institutional Venture Partners). The round valued the company at approximately $2 billion. In 2016, GitHub was ranked No. 14 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list. It has not featured on the 2018, 2019 and 2020 lists. On February 28, 2018, GitHub fell victim to the second largest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history, with incoming traffic reaching a peak of about 1.35 terabits per second. On June 19, 2018, GitHub expanded its GitHub Education by offering free education bundles to all schools. In early July 2020, the GitHub Archive Program was established, to archive its open source code in perpetuity (see below). = Worldwide offices = In 2015, GitHub opened an office in Japan that is its first office outside of the U.S. Five years later, GitHub launched in India under the name GitHub India Private Limited. = Acquisition by Microsoft = From 2012 Microsoft became a significant user of GitHub, using it to host open-source projects and development tools such as .NET Core, Chakra Core, MSBuild, PowerShell, PowerToys, Visual Studio Code, Windows Calculator, Windows Terminal and the bulk of its product documentation (now to be found on Microsoft Docs). On June 4, 2018, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire GitHub for US$7.5 billion. The deal closed on October 26, 2018. GitHub continued to operate independently as a community, platform and business. Under Microsoft, the service was led by Xamarin's Nat Friedman, reporting to Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft Cloud and AI. GitHub's CEO, Chris Wanstrath, was retained as a \\"technical fellow\\", also reporting to Guthrie. There have been concerns from developers Kyle Simpson, JavaScript trainer and author, and Rafael Laguna, CEO at Open-Xchange over Microsoft's purchase, citing uneasiness over Microsoft's handling of previous acquisitions, such as Nokia's mobile business or Skype. This acquisition was in line with Microsoft's business strategy under CEO Satya Nadella, which has seen a larger focus on the cloud computing services, alongside development of and contributions to open-source software. Harvard Business Review argued that Microsoft was intending to acquire GitHub to get access to its user base, so it can be used as a loss leader to encourage use of its other development products and services. Concerns over the sale bolstered interest in competitors: Bitbucket (owned by Atlassian), GitLab (a commercial open source product that also runs a hosted service version) and SourceForge (owned by BIZX, LLC) reported that they had seen spikes in new users intending to migrate projects from GitHub to their respective services. In March 2020, GitHub announced that they are acquiring npm, a JavaScript packaging vendor, for an undisclosed sum of money. The deal was closed on 15 April 2020. Company affairs= Organizational structure = GitHub, Inc. was originally a flat organization with no middle managers; in other words, \\"everyone is a manager\\" (self-management). Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (open allocation), but salaries were set by the chief executive. In 2014, GitHub, Inc. introduced a layer of middle management. = Finance = GitHub.com was a bootstrapped start-up business, which in its first years provided enough revenue to be funded solely by its three founders and start taking on employees. In July 2012, four years after the company was founded, Andreessen Horowitz invested $100 million in venture capital. In July 2015 GitHub raised another $250 million of venture capital in a series B round. Investors were Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital and other venture capital funds. As of August 2016, GitHub was making $140 million in Annual Recurring Revenue. = Mascot = GitHub's mascot is an anthropomorphized \\"octocat\\" with five octopus-like arms. The character was created by graphic designer Simon Oxley as clip art to sell on iStock, a website that enables designers to market royalty-free digital images. GitHub became interested in Oxley's work after Twitter selected a bird that he designed for their own logo. The illustration GitHub chose was a character that Oxley had named Octopuss. Since GitHub wanted Octopuss for their logo (a use that the iStock license disallows), they negotiated with Oxley to buy exclusive rights to the image. GitHub renamed Octopuss to Octocat, and trademarked the character along with the new name. Later, GitHub hired illustrator Cameron McEfee to adapt Octocat for different purposes on the website and promotional materials; McEfee and various GitHub users have since created hundreds of variations of the character, which are available on The Octodex.  Services = GitHub.com = Development of the GitHub.com platform began on October 19, 2007. The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon after it had been made available for a few months prior as a beta release. Projects on GitHub.com can be accessed and managed using the standard Git command-line interface; all standard Git commands work with it. GitHub.com also allows users to browse public repositories on the site. Multiple desktop clients and Git plugins are also available. The site provides social networking-like functions such as feeds, followers, wikis (using wiki software called Gollum) and a social network graph to display how developers work on their versions (\\"forks\\") of a repository and what fork (and branch within that fork) is newest. Anyone can browse and download public repositories but only registered users can contribute content to repositories. With a registered user account, users are able to have discussions, manage repositories, submit contributions to others' repositories, and review changes to code. GitHub.com began offering unlimited private repositories at no cost in January 2019 (limited to three contributors per project). Previously, only public repositories were free. On April 14, 2020, GitHub made \\"all of the core GitHub features\\" free for everyone, including \\"private repositories with unlimited collaborators\\". The fundamental software that underpins GitHub is Git itself, written by Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux. The additional software that provides the GitHub user interface was written using Ruby on Rails and Erlang by GitHub, Inc. developers Wanstrath, Hyett, and Preston-Werner.  Scope  The main purpose of GitHub.com is to facilitate the version control and issue tracking aspects of software development. Labels, milestones, responsibility assignment, and a search engine are available for issue tracking. For version control, Git (and by extension GitHub.com) allows pull requests to propose changes to the source code. Users with the ability to review the proposed changes can see a diff of the requested changes and approve them. In Git terminology, this action is called \\"committing\\" and one instance of it is a \\"commit\\". A history of all commits are kept and can be viewed at a later time. In addition, GitHub supports the following formats and features: * Documentation, including automatically rendered README files in a variety of Markdown-like file formats (see ) *Wikis * GitHub Actions, which allows building continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines for testing, releasing and deploying software without the use of third-party websites/platforms * Graphs: pulse, contributors, commits, code frequency, punch card, network, members * Integrations Directory * Email notifications * Option to subscribe someone to notifications by @ mentioning them. * Emojis * Nested task-lists within files * Visualization of geospatial data * 3D render files that can be previewed using a new integrated STL file viewer that displays the files on a \\"3D canvas\\". The viewer is powered by WebGL and Three.js. * Photoshop's native PSD format can be previewed and compared to previous versions of the same file. * PDF document viewer * Security Alerts of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures in different packages GitHub's Terms of Service do not require public software projects hosted on GitHub to meet the Open Source Definition. The terms of service state, \\"By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and fork your repositories.\\" = GitHub Enterprise = GitHub Enterprise is a self- managed version of GitHub.com with similar functionality. It can be run on an organization's own hardware or on a cloud provider, and it has been available since November 2011.https://github.blog/2011-11-01-introducing-github- enterprise/ = GitHub Pages = GitHub Pages is a static web hosting service offered by GitHub since 2008 to GitHub users for hosting user blogs, project documentation, or even whole books created as a page. All GitHub Pages content is stored in Git repository, either as files served to visitors verbatim or in Markdown format. GitHub is seamlessly integrated with Jekyll static web site and blog generator and GitHub continuous integration pipelines. Each time the content source is updated, Jekyll regenerates the website and automatically serves it via GitHub Pages infrastructure. As with the rest of GitHub, it includes both free and paid tiers of service, instead of being supported by web advertising. Web sites generated through this service are hosted either as subdomains of the github.io domain, or as custom domains bought through a third-party domain name registrar. When custom domain is set on a GitHub Pages repo a Let's Encrypt certificate for it is generated automatically. Once the certificate has been generated Enforce HTTPS can be set for the repository's website to transparently redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.All GitHub Pages sites, including sites that are correctly configured with a custom domain, support HTTPS and HTTPS enforcement.Custom domains on GitHub Pages gain support for HTTPS. = Gist = GitHub also operates other services: a pastebin-style site called Gist that is for hosting code snippets (GitHub proper is for hosting larger projects). Tom Preston-Werner presented the then- new Gist feature at a punk rock Ruby conference in 2008. Gist builds on the traditional simple concept of a pastebin by adding version control for code snippets, easy forking, and TLS encryption for private pastes. Because each \\"gist\\" has its own Git repository, multiple code snippets can be contained in a single paste and they can be pushed and pulled using Git. Further, forked code can be pushed back to the original author in the form of a patch, so gists (pastes) can become more like mini-projects. Before February 18, 2018, unregistered users were able to upload text to the site. Since then, uploading gists has been deactivated for unregistered users with the aim to mitigate spamming. = Education program = GitHub launched a new program called the GitHub Student Developer Pack to give students free access to popular development tools and services. GitHub partnered with Bitnami, Crowdflower, DigitalOcean, DNSimple, HackHands, Namecheap, Orchestrate, Screenhero, SendGrid, Stripe, Travis CI and Unreal Engine to launch the program. In 2016 GitHub announced the launch of the GitHub Campus Experts program to train and encourage students to grow technology communities at their universities. The Campus Experts program is open to university students of 18 years and older across the world. GitHub Campus Experts are one of the primary ways that GitHub funds student oriented events and communities, Campus Experts are given access to training, funding, and additional resources to run events and grow their communities. To become a Campus Expert applicants must complete an online training course consisting of multiple modules designed to grow community leadership skills. = GitHub Marketplace service = GitHub also provides some software as a service integrations for adding extra features to projects. Those services include: * Waffle.io: Project management for software teams. Automatically see pull requests, automated builds, reviews, and deployments across all of your repositories in GitHub. * Rollbar: Integrate with GitHub to provide real time debugging tools and full-stack exception reporting. It is compatible with all well used code languages, such as JavaScript, Python, .NET, Ruby, PHP, Node.js, Android, iOS, Go, Java, and C#. * Codebeat: For automated code analysis specialized in web and mobile developers. The supported languages for this software are: Elixir, Go, Java, Swift, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Kotlin, Objective-C, and TypeScript. * Travis CI: To provide confidence for your apps while doing test and ship. Also gives full control over the build environment, to adapt it to the code. Supported languages: Go, Java, JavaScript, Objective-C, Python, PHP, Ruby, and Swift. * GitLocalize: Developed for teams that are translating their content from one point to another. GitLocalize automatically syncs with your repository so you can keep your workflow on GitHub. It also keeps you updated on what needs to be translated. = GitHub Sponsors = GitHub Sponsors allows users to make monthly money donations to projects hosted on GitHub.https://github.com/sponsors The public beta was announced on May 23, 2019 and currently the project accepts wait list registrations. The Verge said that GitHub Sponsors \\"works exactly like Patreon\\" because \\"developers can offer various funding tiers that come with different perks, and they‚Äôll receive recurring payments from supporters who want to access them and encourage their work\\" except with \\"zero fees to use the program\\". Furthermore, GitHub offer incentives for early adopters during the first year: it pledges to cover payment processing costs, and match sponsorship payments up to $5,000 per developer. Furthermore, users still can use other similar services like Patreon and Open Collective and link to their own websites. GitHub Archive Program In July 2020, GitHub stored a February archive of the site in an abandoned mountain mine in Svalbard, Norway, part of the Arctic World Archive and not far from the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. The archive contained the code of all active public repositories, as well as that of dormant, but significant public repositories. The 21TB of data was stored on piqlFilm archival film reels as QR codes, and is expected to last 500‚Äì1,000 years. The GitHub Archive Program is also working with partners on Project Silica, in an attempt to store all public repositories for 10,000 years. It aims to write archives into the molecular structure of quartz glass platters, using a high- precision laser that pulses a quadrillion (1,000,000,000,000,000) times per second.  Controversies = Harassment allegations = In March 2014, GitHub programmer Julie Ann Horvath alleged that founder and CEO Tom Preston- Werner and his wife Theresa engaged in a pattern of harassment against her that led to her leaving the company. In April 2014, GitHub released a statement denying Horvath's allegations. However, following an internal investigation, GitHub confirmed the claims. GitHub's CEO Chris Wanstrath wrote on the company blog, \\"The investigation found Tom Preston-Werner in his capacity as GitHub's CEO acted inappropriately, including confrontational conduct, disregard of workplace complaints, insensitivity to the impact of his spouse's presence in the workplace, and failure to enforce an agreement that his spouse should not work in the office.\\" Preston-Werner subsequently resigned from the company. The firm then announced it would implement new initiatives and trainings \\"to make sure employee concerns and conflicts are taken seriously and dealt with appropriately.\\" = Sanctions = On July 25, 2019, a developer based in Iran wrote on Medium about how GitHub blocked his private repositories, and prohibited access to GitHub Pages. Soon after, GitHub confirmed that it was now blocking developers in Iran, Crimea, Cuba, North Korea, and Syria from accessing private repositories. However, GitHub reopened access to GitHub Pages days later, for public repositories regardless of location. It was also revealed that using GitHub while visiting sanctioned countries could result in similar action occurring on a user's account. GitHub responded to complaints and the media through a spokesperson, saying: > \\"GitHub is subject to US trade control laws, and is committed to full > compliance with applicable law. At the same time, GitHub's vision is to be > the global platform for developer collaboration, no matter where developers > reside. As a result, we take seriously our responsibility to examine > government mandates thoroughly to be certain that users and customers are > not impacted beyond what is required by law. This includes keeping public > repositories services, including those for open source projects, available > and accessible to support personal communications involving developers in > sanctioned regions.\\" Developers who feel that they should not have restrictions can appeal for the removal of said restrictions, including those who only travel to, and do not reside in, those countries. GitHub has forbidden the use of VPNs and IP proxies to access the site from sanctioned countries, as purchase history and IP addresses are how they flag users, among other sources. = Censorship = On December 3, 2014, Russia blacklisted GitHub.com because GitHub initially refused to take down user-posted suicide manuals. After a day, Russia withdrew its block, and Github began blocking to specific content and pages in Russia. 28 days later, India blocked GitHub.com along with 31 other websites over pro- ISIS content posted by users. India lifted the block on January 2, 2015. On October 8, 2016, Turkey blocked GitHub to prevent email leakage of a hacked account belonging to the country's Energy Minister. On March 26, 2015, a massive DDoS attack was launched against GitHub.com that lasted for more than 118 hours (a little less than 5 days). The attack, which appeared to originate from China, primarily targeted GitHub-hosted user content describing methods of circumventing Internet censorship. On April 19,2020, the Chinese police detained Chen Mei and Cai Wei, who are volunteers for Terminus 2049, and accused them of \\"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\\". Terminus2049 is hosted on GitHub. Cai and Chen archived news articles, interviews, and other materials published on Chinese media outlets and social media platforms that have been removed by censors in China. = ICE Contract = GitHub has a $200,000 contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for the use of their on-site product GitHub Enterprise Server. This contract was renewed in 2019, despite internal opposition from many GitHub employees. In an email sent to employees, later posted to the GitHub blog on October 9, 2019, CEO Nat Friedman stated \\"The revenue from the purchase is less than $200,000 and not financially material for our company.\\" He announced that GitHub had pledged to donate $500,000 to \\"nonprofit groups supporting immigrant communities targeted by the current administration.\\" In response at least 150 GitHub employees signed an open letter re-stating their opposition to the contract, and denouncing alleged human rights abuses by ICE. As of November 13, 2019, five workers had resigned over the contract. The ICE contract dispute came into focus again in June 2020 due to the company's decision to abandon \\"master/slave\\" branch terminology, spurred by the George Floyd protests and Black Lives Matter movement. Detractors of GitHub describe the branch renaming to be a form of performative activism and have urged GitHub to cancel their ICE contract instead. An open letter from members of the open source community was shared on GitHub in December 2019, demanding that the company drop their contract with ICE and provide more transparency into how they conduct business and partnerships. The letter has been signed by over 700 people.  Developed projects  * Atom, a free and open-source text and source code editor * Electron, an open-source framework to use JavaScript- based websites as desktop applications.  Prominent users  Some prominent open source organizations and projects use GitHub as a primary place for collaboration, including: * Apertium (migrated from SourceForge) * The Apache Software Foundation (finished migration in February 2019) * Node.js * npm * Express.js * MySQL * Microsoft ** .NET Core ** ASP.NET Core ** Visual Studio Code ** TypeScript ** Windows Calculator ** Windows Console ** Windows Terminal * Google * uBlock Origin * Bootstrap (front-end framework) * U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement * National Security Agency  See also  * Collaborative innovation network * Collaborative intelligence * Commons- based peer production * Comparison of source code hosting facilities * Gitea  References  External links  * Bug and issue tracking software Cloud computing providers Collaborative projects Computing websites Cross-platform software Git (software) Internet properties established in 2008 Open- source software hosting facilities Project hosting websites Project management software South of Market, San Francisco Version control Microsoft acquisitions 2018 mergers and acquisitions Microsoft subsidiaries Microsoft websites Remote companies __FORCETOC__ ","title":"GitHub"},{"id":"18545323","text":"Treaty of Bangkok or Bangkok Treaty may refer to: *Burney Treaty (20 June 1826) *Siamese‚ÄìAmerican Treaty of Amity and Commerce (14 April 1836) *Bowring Treaty (18 April 1855) *Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909 (10 March) *Treaty between Thailand and Japan Concerning the Continuance of Friendly Relations and the Mutual Respect of Each Other's Territorial Integrity (23 December 1940) *Treaty of Amity and Economic Relations (Thailand‚ÄìUnited States) (29 May 1966) *Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia (24 February 1976) *Southeast Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (15 December 1995) ","title":"Treaty of Bangkok (disambiguation)"},{"id":"18545328","text":"Aescin or escin is a mixture of saponins with anti-inflammatory, vasoconstrictor and vasoprotective effects found in Aesculus hippocastanum (the horse chestnut). Aescin is the main active component in horse chestnut, and is responsible for most of its medicinal properties. The main active compound of aescin is Œ≤-aescin, although the mixture also contains various other components including Œ±-aescin, protoescigenin, barringtogenol, cryptoescin and benzopyrones.

Horse chestnut extract may be as effective and well tolerated as the use of compression stockings. Mechanism of action Aescin appears to produce effects through a wide range of mechanisms. It induces endothelial nitric oxide synthesis by making endothelial cells more permeable to calcium ions, and also induces release of prostaglandin F2Œ±. Other possible mechanisms include serotonin antagonism and histamine antagonism and reduced catabolism of tissue mucopolysaccharides.

The team played all of its games at the Duquesne Gardens, and was involved in allowing Harry Peel become the first admitted professional hockey player in 1902. History=Pre-1896= The Keystones' history can be traced to the Keystone Bicycle Club, which consisted of students from Western University (today known as the University of Pittsburgh) and Carnegie Tech. Around 1895 the club gave up bicycling, renamed itself the Pittsburgh Keystones and played ice hockey at the newly built Schenley Park Casino, which was located in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, on Saturday afternoons, as an amateur club. On December 30, 1895, the Pittsburgh Press made mention of a ‚Äúgreat international hockey and polo tournament‚Äù opening game at the Casino. The newspaper reported that a team consisting of ten players from Queen's University played against a group of local players from Western University and Pittsburgh Catholic College of the Holy Ghost (today Duquesne University) and a half hour of exhibition of hockey was played before the ice polo match. The paper noted that 2,500 to 3,000 fans showed up to watch the game, despite claims of bad weather. No score or records were reportedly kept but the paper did note that the team from Queen's University outplayed the Pittsburghers, who had never played the game before. Since the students from Western University participated in the game, it is possible that several of those players later played for the Keystones. The Casino was destroyed in a fire on December 17, 1896 The Yale University hockey team was to have played a series of games against the Keystones, at the Casino, but they were telegraphed and told not to come to Pittsburgh due to the destruction of the arena. =WPHL era= 1902 Pittsburgh Keystones, WPHL Champions Afterwards, the Keystones, and every other amateur team in Pittsburgh, began playing all of their games on the new ice rink at the Duquesne Gardens. The Gardens, because of its artificial ice surface, lured many established hockey players to the Pittsburgh-area from Canada. In 1901 the team became members of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League, with the Pittsburgh Bankers and Pittsburgh Athletic Club. Aside from league play, the teams also played exhibition games against some of the best amateur teams from North America. During the 1901-02 season, Riley Hern, a future member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, began his professional career with the Keystones. In his first season, Hern led the league in victories, with nine in 14 games and was named to the WPHL All-Star Team. However, in the next season, Hern led the league in losses, losing 10 out of 11 games. Joining Hern on the team in 1901 was Arthur Sixsmith who moved to Pittsburgh and turning professional with the Keystones. The Keystones would go on to win the 1901-02 WPHL championship title. First admitted professional player In the summer of 1902 Keystones' player Harry Peel, a Keystones player in 1901-02, admitted that he was paid $35 a week to play in the so-called amateur league and so no amateur teams would play against these teams again without being suspended by either Canadian or U.S. officials. According to Peel \\"[The Keystones] make no bones whatever about paying men. If they do not pay them, they give them fake positions.\\" Peel was later suspended by the Ontario Hockey Association and his appeal was rejected on December 10, 1903 and again on November 30, 1904. However, by the 1902-03 season the WPHL, was known as a fully professional league. =Decline= The next season, the Portage Lakes Hockey Club of Houghton, Michigan began a professional league which continued to play professional exhibition game against the WPHL's Pittsburgh Bankers. However the exposure given by playing Portage Lakes raised the profiles of some of the Pittsburgh players, who were lured away after the season for the promise of better pay in Michigan. The team soon raided Pittsburgh‚Äôs teams for top players like Riley Hern and Bruce Stuart. This led the Keystones to withdraw from the league on January 17, 1903. Their players were then redistributed among the three other WPHL teams.

(Gerhardt Muller, erstwhile professor at the United States Merchant Marine Academy and Manager of Regional Intermodal Planning of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, promotes it from a subcategory to being a third major category of cargo in its own right, alongside general and bulk cargo.)  Description  It comprises goods that are prepackaged, counted as they are loaded and unloaded (as opposed to bulk cargo where individual items are not counted), not stored in containers, and transferred as units at port. Types of neo-bulk cargo goods include heavy machinery, lumber, bundled steel, steel coils, scrap iron, bananas, waste paper, and cars. The category has only become recognized as a distinct cargo category in its own right in recent decades. Ocean vessels that are designed to carry specific forms of neo-bulk cargo, such as dedicated Roll-on/roll-off car-carrying ships, are called neo-bulk carriers. They are specially designed for the individual types of neo-bulk cargoes that they carry, although car- carriers can sometimes double-up to carry different types of cargo on a return journey. In 2000, the largest neo-bulk car carrier in the world was Wallenius Wilhelmsen, with a fleet of 20 carriers, and a total haulage that year of 1.5 million vehicles. Other special designs of neo-bulk carriers include log- carriers that are designed to tip their load over the side of the vessel into the water, relying upon the fact that logs will float, and specialist carriers for newsprint and livestock. = Primary Maritime Cargo Types =References= Reference bibliography =  * Maritime transport ","title":"Neo-bulk cargo"},{"id":"18545466","text":"Alles Bob (\\"Its all Bob\\") is a 1999 German film starring , Martina Gedeck and Miriam Lahnstein, directed by .

It is located on the west coast of the island south of Broadford extending down to the north shore of Loch Eiseort, facing out to the Atlantic to the south west and is in the Scottish council area of Highland.  Etymology  The etymology of the name Heaste is unclear. It is likely that the name is old Norse as are a great many local placenames, not Scottish Gaelic. The anglicised \\"Heaste\\" spelling may have been influenced by the English word ‚Äòhaste‚Äô. Suggested etymologies have included: one been based on a suggestion relating to the tidal island of Eilean Heast which lies just off-shore in the sea-loch Loch Eiseort. This has been compared to Icelandic hestur (nom.sg.) hest (acc.sg.) ‚Äò‚Äôhorse‚Äô‚Äô ( - perhaps an island where horses were confined. Another suggestion is based on ON h√°- ‚Äòhigh‚Äô or else hei√∞r ‚Äòheather‚Äô + sta√∞r ‚Äòstead(ing)‚Äô which therefore would equate to either ‚Äòhigh stead(ing)‚Äô or ‚Äòheath stead(ing)‚Äô and which describes well the location of the old village which also extended onto higher heather moorland, above the present day extent of the modern houses. Many Norse-based placenames of the Hebrides, the Highlands, Orkney and Shetland terminate in the element \\"-sta\\" sometime clipped to -st (in either spelling only or in spelling and in pronunciation to some degree). Examples are Carbost in Skye (clipped in anglicised spelling) and Garrabost in Lewis, but many retain the final schwa and may or may not retain the unclipped -{sta} spelling. This suggests an analysis as two words is warranted in contrast to the first of the above suggested etymologies.  Location  Heaste lies on the northern shore of the Atlantic sea-loch Loch Eiseort On the west coast of Skye. The tidal island of Eilean Heast which lies just off-shore in Loch Eiseort, Eilean Heast can be reached at low tide with great difficulty as the access is extremely muddy. The island shelters the Heaste shore from the worst of the waves from the southwest inti the sea loch. Heaste To the west of Heasta Beinn nan C√†rn dominates the view and blocks the view of the Skye Cuillin mountains. The nearest inhabited settlements as the crow flies are Druim Fhe√†rna to the east, which is at the head of Loch Eishort and An t-√írd On the other side, the south side of Loch Eishort. Neither is directly accessible by road and a very long journey is required back up to the main road near Broadford and then round to the east and south. The northern, highest part of the township, at approximately 130 m altitude is one of the highest inhabited places in Skye and has views of the sea both to the east between Skye and the mainland and of the Atlantic to the west. To the east the Linne Shl√©ibhteach and the mainland mountains of Knoydart including Beinn Sgritheall and Ladhar Bheinn can be seen. To the southwest, the Atlantic can be seen where the sea loch Loch Eishort opens out towards th Small Isles including the mountainous Island of R√πm. From just above the village, with difficulty the very top of the Sgurr of Eilean Eige can just be seen peeping above the hills of the Sl√©ibhte peninsula of Skye.  Employment economic activity and industry  Local industry includes:tourist accommodation; fishing out of Loch Eishort where there is a ‚Äôpontoon', a floating pier supported by buoyancy tanks; and crofting, keeping sheep and cattle. The Broadford Mackinnon Memorial Hospital and Sabhal M√≥r Ostaig are amongst the local providers of employment. There was a fish farm in Loch Eiseort which was worked from Heaste until the end of the 1990s when it was closed. This too provided local employment.  Flora, fauna and animal husbandry  Above the village, deer, golden eagles and buzzards and other birds of prey are to be seen. Occasionally otters and mink have been seen right in the village itself. Every year, in late spring and early summer, several cuckoos can be heard calling back and forth at the north end of the village. Other wildlife includes: slow worms, adders, rabbits, foxes, dragonflies, woodcocks, wrens, voles, mice, rats toads and frogs. In some parts of the village, orchids blanket the ground, with bluebells visible in late spring. There are also patches of marsh marigolds (or ‚Äòking-cups‚Äô). Cattle and sheep roam loose on the township common grazing. There is also a fank on the northern edge of Heasta too, just to the north of the northern edge of the village. There there is a cattle grid which marks the northern boundary of the village and which prevents livestock from entering the village down the road. There is also another cattle grid near the southern end of the Heasta road which similarly prevents entry by livestock. At the fank, sheep are sheared, livestock are rounded up and confined for medicinal treatment and in readiness for transport to market. Some residents keep hens or ducks, and one person has donkeys. As well as working sheepdogs, the usual domestic pets are kept, including cats and pet dogs. As elsewhere, domestic cats threaten the bird life and eat rabbits and rodents; foxes and mink attack hens and ducks from time to time, and dogs are a concern regarding sheep.  Surrounding environment  Within the village though there are trees in the deep clefts by the streams. There are many waterfalls. The road from Heaste to the north towards Broadford rises high over the hills reaching its highest point at the Fireach nan Clach. Here deer can sometimes be seen. From the viewpoint of the Fireach nan Clach looking northward, the mountains of Bl√†-Bheinn and Beinn na Caillich dominate the view to the west. To the north can be seen Broadford Bay and the Inner Sound between Skye and the mainland; the islands of Scalpaigh and Pabaigh in Broadford Bay and to the north east there are the Applecross Mountains (over which runs the highest road in Britain) and the Skye Bridge. To the east, hills block the view of the narrow but extremely navigable channel that separates Skye from the mainland. From Heaste itself the Skye Cuillin mountains cannot be seen because Beinn nan C√†rn blocks the westward view. An ascent of Beinn nan C√†rn provides spectacular 360-degree views of the mainland mountains, the Cuillin on Skye and the Atlantic sea surrounding the small isles Eilean R√πm and Eilean Eige.  Cleared and abandoned neighbouring settlements  Across Loch Eishort, to the south east on its southern (north- facing) shore the ruins of an abandoned village, M√≤rsaig, can be seen with binoculars. M√≤rsaig was abandoned because according to some local informants the environment was too harsh - ‚Äòit was cold‚Äô; certainly it may get less sun than Heaste because it is slightly shadowed by hills to the south when the sun is low. To the west a difficult path westwards up and down towards the shore leads to the abandoned village of Boraraig with all its stone houses still standing. There is also another abandoned village further still to the west along the coast, S√πisinis. The inhabitants of these settlements were forced out of their homes during the Highland Clearances at the end of the 19th century.  Houses  Some inhabitants of these other neighbouring settlements moved to Heaste, thus swelling the population greatly by the early 20th century. Many houses in Heaste have been abandoned, some are those furthest away from the present day road on its west side; some ruins can be seen high up on the moor on the slope of Beinn nan C√†rn. In the 20th century many modern houses were built replacing the older stone ones, but at least one 19th century stone house remains; this was originally thatched and single-storey. The old village schoolhouse which was in use until the mid 20th century still stands, near the shore, in its own small stonewall enclosed garden. The schoolhouse is now used as holiday accommodation. Heaste now contains only domestic residences and has no shops, offices, pub, post office or any such facilities, nor any current operating business premises as of 2019 aside from agricultural sheds.  People  Many of the residents grew up in the village and some of the oldest attended the Heaste school before it closed. There are a number of incomers from outside the local area; from elsewhere in Scotland, many from England and elsewhere. Heaste is typical of the wider local area around Broadford where number of residents have come from other parts of Scotland, from England and outside the UK.  Language  Typically for the area, English is the everyday language of the village for many, at least outside the home. A minority of the inhabitants of Heaste are native speakers of Scottish Gaelic but English is used even by the fluent Gaelic speakers frequently and almost always when outside the home. All Gaelic speakers are fluent in English. Some Gaelic speakers are very willing to speak the language even with learners they know. All Gaelic speakers speak the local dialect; currently there are no Gaelic speakers from other areas. The language can frequently be heard in certain situations in Broadford however, but not when strangers are present.

Concept An L3C is a for-profit, social enterprise venture that has a stated goal of performing a socially beneficial purpose, not maximizing income. It is a hybrid structure that combines the legal and tax flexibility of a traditional LLC, the social benefits of a nonprofit organization, and the branding and market positioning advantages of a social enterprise. The L3C is obligated to be mission-driven so there is a clear order of priorities for its fiduciaries. The L3C is designed to make it easier for socially oriented businesses to attract investments from foundations and additional money from private investors. Unlike the traditional LLC, the L3C's articles of organization are required by law to mirror the federal tax standards for program-related investing. A program-related investment (PRI) is one way in which foundations can satisfy their obligation under the Tax Reform Act of 1969 to distribute at least 5% of their assets every year for charitable purposes. While foundations usually meet this requirement through grants, investments in L3Cs and charities that qualify as PRIs can also fulfill the requirement while allowing the foundations to receive a return. Legislation An L3C is established pursuant to the law of the state in which the entity is formed. To authorize the organization of an L3C, legislation must be passed that amends the state's general limited liability company law. Thus far, legislation has been passed in Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina (authorizing legislation repealed in 2013), North Dakota, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, and Wyoming and the federal jurisdictions of the Crow Indian Nation of Montana and the Oglala Sioux Tribe.Federal and State Taxation of Limited Liability Companies, ¬∂2602.01 (CCH / Wolters Kluwer 2014 Ed.)L3C Legislation was approved in Puerto Rico on December 22, 2015 by Act 233-2015 As of January 11, 2013, the Secretaries of State of the ten states and two Indian Nations that authorize them reported that 711 active L3Cs are in operation. HB 1299 was introduced on January 14, 2013 in North Dakota, which would authorize the organization of L3Cs. Legislation has been written for 26 additional states but has not yet been introduced. In May, 2012, the IRS released proposed regulations that broaden the landscape of what constitutes an acceptable PRI by adding nine new examples of investments that would qualify, along with some general principles.Examples of Program-Related Investments, 77 Fed. Reg. 23429, 23430 (2012). An amendment to the Illinois L3C law that would allow for a more expansive description of the purposes for which L3Cs can be created, consistent with the proposed examples of PRIs set forth by the IRS in 2012, unanimously passed the Illinois Senate on April 17, 2013, and has been referred to the Illinois House Rules Committee.S.B. 2359, 98th Gen. Assem. (Ill. 2013). The expanded clause would make Illinois the first state to authorize L3Cs whose purposes may reflect the whole range of statutorily sanctioned PRIs to include religious, scientific, and literary organizations. Legislation is also pending at federal level that will simplify the process for receiving IRS approval that an investment qualifies as a PRI. As of January 1, 2014, North Carolina no longer authorizes L3Cs; however, current L3Cs can continue to use the designation.

Merrie Melodies cartoon short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on June 4, 1955, and stars Tweety and Sylvester the Cat. The cartoon is the last to use the 1945-1955 version of \\"Merrily We Roll Along.\\" Plot The story centers on Sylvester visiting a circus, where he not only tries to catch Tweety for his meal, but attempt to one-up a lion (an attraction billed as \\"King of the Cats\\"). A carefree Sylvester walks into the circus singing his theme \\"Meow!\\" where he visits the various animal exhibits. There, upon seeing the lion exhibit, the unimpressed cat immediately expresses his displeasure over the large feline's billing. All that changes when he realizes he'd just passed by the Tweety Bird... and thus the chase begins. Tweety runs into the big top, where the lion (now uncaged) is waiting to maul Sylvester for his earlier remarks (not to mention Sylvester clobbering him with a mallet). From this point forward, the lion serves as both an antagonist for Sylvester and a protector of Tweety. Sylvester tries beating what he thinks is a fire hose to free Tweety, unknowing that the \\"hose\\" is an elephant's trunk. The elephant grabs Sylvester with his trunk and‚Äîafter crushing his chest‚Äîthrows the battered puss into the lion's cage, where the lion finishes the job. Other run-ins with the lion, elephant and other animals, all ending with Sylvester getting the worst of things, involve him exploiting his abilities as a high diver (Tweety directs the elephant to \\"drink it all down\\" (referring to the water before Sylvester lands), a fire eater (the lion makes Sylvester eat the fire) and a high-wire walker (\\"hewwooooo, puddy tat!\\"). In the end, Sylvester finally gets rid of the lion ... only to unwittingly lock himself in a cage with even more lions (also the antagonists for Sylvester). Tweety immediately takes a hat and cane and becomes a carnival barker (\\"Huwwy! Huwwy! Huwwy! Step wight up for da gweatest show on Eawth! Fifty wions and one puddy tat!\\") A loud roar erupts, and with Sylvester presumably having met his fate, Tweety changes his spiel: \\"Step wight up!

The movement is designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey, Pakistan, and the GCC. Owing to the outlawed status of the G√ºlen movement in Turkey, some observers refer to the movement's volunteers who are Turkish Muslims as effectively a sub-sect of Sunni Islam; these volunteers generally hold their religious tenets as generically Turkish Sunni Islam. The movement also includes participants from other nationalities and religious affiliations. A U.S.-based umbrella foundation which is affiliated with the movement is the Alliance for Shared Values. The movement has attracted supporters and drawn the attention of critics in Turkey, Central Asia, and other parts of the world. It is active in education and operates private schools and universities in over 180 countries. It has initiated forums for interfaith dialogue. It has substantial investments in media, finance, and for-profit health clinics. Despite its teachings which are stated conservative even in Turkey, some have praised the movement as a pacifist, modern-oriented version of Islam, and an alternative to more extreme schools of Islam such as Salafism. But it has also been reported of having \\"global, apocalyptic ambition\\", a \\"cultish hierarchy\\" and of being a secretive Islamic sect. The G√ºlen movement is a former ally of the Turkish Justice and Development Party (AKP). When the AKP came to power in 2002 the two formed, despite their differences, a tactical alliance against military tutelage and the Turkish secular elite. It was through this alliance that the AKP had accomplished an unprecedented feat in Turkish republican history by securing national electoral victories sufficient to form three consecutive majority governments in 2002, 2007, and 2011. The G√ºlen movement gained influence on the Turkish police force and the judiciary during its alliance with conservative President Erdoƒüan, which saw hundreds of G√ºlen supporters appointed to positions within the Turkish government. Once the old establishment was defeated around 2010 to 2011 disagreements emerged between the AKP and the G√ºlen movement. The first breaking point was the so-called ‚Ä≥MIT crisis‚Ä≥ of February 2012, it was also interpreted as a power struggle between pro-G√ºlen police and judiciary and the AKP.Halil M. Karaveli: The Coalition Crumbles: Erdogan, the G√ºlenists, and Turkish Democracy, The Turkey Analyst, vol. 5, no. 4, Feb. 20, 2012Sebnem Arsu: Intelligence Chief Must Testify, nytimes.com, Feb. 10, 2012Turkey Feels Sway of Reclusive Cleric in the U.S., nytimes.com, April 24, 2012 After the 2013 corruption investigations in Turkey into stated corrupt practices by several bureaucrats, ministers, mayors, and family members of the ruling AKP of Turkey was uncovered, President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan blamed the movement for initiating the investigations as a result of a break in previously friendly relations. President Erdoƒüan said G√ºlen attempted to overthrow the Turkish government through a judicial coup by the use of corruption investigations and seized the group-owned newspaper (Zaman‚Äî one of the most circulated newspapers in Turkey before the seizure) and several companies that have ties with the group. Since May 2016, the G√ºlen movement has been classified as a terrorist organization by Turkey under the assigned names Fethullahist Terrorist Organization () (FET√ñ) and Parallel State Structure () (PDY). After the failed coup attempt in 2016, the government of Turkey blamed the group for the coup and authorities have arrested thousands of soldiers and judges. Over ten thousand education staff were suspended and the licenses of over 20,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked for stated affiliation to G√ºlen. Fethullah G√ºlen condemned the coup and denied any involvement. Description and membership The movement states that it is based on moral values and advocacy of universal access to education, civil society, tolerance and peace. The emphasis among participants is to perform \\"service\\" (also the meaning of the Turkish word \\"hizmet\\") as arising from individuals' personal commitments to righteous imperatives. Along with hizmet, the movement, which has no official name, is termed the G√ºlen movement or cemaat (the latter also used to describe participants in Sufi orders, meaning \\"congregation,\\" \\"community,\\" or \\"assembly.\\") The movement has been characterized as a \\"moderate blend of Islam\\". G√ºlen and the G√ºlen movement are technology-friendly, work within current market and commerce structures, and are savvy users of modern communications and public relations.Ehsan Masood, A modern Ottoman, Prospect, Issue 148, July 2008 In 2008, G√ºlen was described as \\"the modern face of the Sufi Ottoman tradition\\", who reassures his followers, including many members of \\"Turkey's aspirational middle class\\", that \\"they can combine the statist- nationalist beliefs of Atat√ºrk‚Äôs republic with a traditional but flexible Islamic faith\\" and \\"Ottoman traditions that had been caricatured as theocratic by Atat√ºrk and his 'Kemalist' heirs\\". Within Turkey the G√ºlen movement keeps its distance from established Islamic political parties.Clement M. Henry, Rodney Wilson, The politics of Islamic Finance, Edinburgh University Press (2004), p 236. Retrieved 16 July 2016 Sources state that the G√ºlen movement is vying to be recognized as the world's leading Muslim network, one that is more reasonable than many of its rivals. The movement builds on the activities of G√ºlen, who has won praise from non-Muslim quarters for his advocacy of science, interfaith dialogue, and multi-party democracy. It has earned praise as \\"the world's most global movement\\". \\"It is impossible to calculate the size of the G√ºlen movement\\" since the movement is not a centralized or formal organization with membership rosters, but rather a set of numerous, loosely organized networks of people inspired by G√ºlen.Helen Rose Ebaugh, The G√ºlen Movement: A Sociological Analysis of a Civic Movement Rooted in Moderate Islam (Springer, 2009), p. 46. Estimates of the size of the movement vary, with one source stating that between 200,000 supporters and 4 million people are influenced by G√ºlen's ideas (1997 Tempo estimate),Bulent Aras & Omer Caha, Fethullah Gulen and his Liberal \\"Turkish Islam\\" Movement, Middle East Review of International Affairs, Vol. 4, No. 4 (December 2000). and another stating that G√ºlen has \\"hundreds of thousands of supporters\\" (The Guardian, 2000). The membership of the movement consists primarily of students, teachers, businessmen, academics, journalists and other professionals. Its members have founded schools, universities, an employers' association, charities, real estate trusts, student organizations, radio and television stations, and newspapers. The movement's structure has been described as a flexible organizational network.Portrait of Fethullah G√ºlen, A Modern Turkish-Islamic Reformist Movement schools and businesses organize locally and link themselves into informal networks. Akin to Turkey's Sufi tariqas (lay religious orders), banned in Turkey in 1925, The movement skirted Kemalist Turkey's prohibitions against assembling in non-state sponsored religious meetings. (President-to-be of Turkey Tayyip Erdoƒüan, when a young man, had belonged to the then- technically-banned-in-Turkey Naqshbandi tariqa.) Each local G√ºlen movement school and community has a person designated its \\"informal\\" (in the sense of not being Turkish state-sponsored) prayer leader (imam). In the G√ºlen movement, this individual is a layman who serves for a stint within this volunteer position. His identity is kept confidential, generally only purposely made known to those with close connections to those participating in decision-making and coordinating councils within the local group. Above a grouping of such \\"secret\\" (not-publicly-acknowledged) imams is another such volunteer leader. This relationship tree continues on up the laddar to the nation-level imam and to an individuals who consults with G√ºlen himself. (These individuals closest to Gulen, having degrees from theology schools, are offhandedly referred to within the movement as mullahs.) G√ºlen's position, as described in the foregoing, is analogous to that of a shaykh (master) of a Sufi tariqa. Unlike with traditional tariqas, no-one makes pledges of any sort, upon joining the G√ºlen movement; one becomes a movement participant simply by working with others to promote and effect the movement's objectives of education and service. The G√ºlen movement works within the given structures of modern secular states; it encourages affiliated members to maximize the opportunities those countries afford rather than engaging in subversive activities. In the words of the leader himself and the title of a cornerstone of his philosophy, G√ºlen promotes \\"an Ottoman Empire of the Mind\\". Detractors of the movement \\"have labeled G√ºlen community members as secretive missionaries, while those in the Movement and sympathetic observers class it as a civil society organization\\".David Tittensor, The House of Service: The Gulen Movement and Islam's Third Way (Oxford University Press, 2014) p. 172. Critics have complained that members of the G√ºlen movement are overly compliant to the directions from its leaders,Infra note, Berlinski 2012 and G√ºlen's \\"movement is generally perceived by its critics as a religio-political cult\\".Bulent Temel, Candidacy versus Membership: Is Turkey the Greatest Beneficiary of the European Union\\" in The Great Catalyst: European Union Project and Lessons from Greece and Turkey (ed. B√ºlent Temel: Lexington, 2014), p. 375. The Guardian editorial board described the movement in 2013 as having \\"some of the characteristics of a cult or of an Islamic Opus Dei\\". Scholars such as Simon Robinson disagree with the characterization, writing that although \\"[t]here is no doubt that G√ºlen remains a charismatic leader and that members of the movement hold him in the highest respect\\", the movement \\"differs markedly from a cult in several ways\\", with G√ºlen stressing \\"the primacy of the scriptures\\" and \\"the imperative of service\\" and consistently avoiding \\"attempts to institutionalize power, to perceive him as the source of all truth, or to view him as taking responsibility for the movement\\".Simon Robinson, \\"Building Bridges: Gulen Pontifex\\" in Hizmet Means Service: Perspectives on an Alternative Path within Islam (ed. Martin E. Marty: University of California Press, 2015), p. 78. Zeki Saritoprak says that the view of G√ºlen as \\"a cult leader or a man with ambitions\\" is mistaken, and contends that G√ºlen should be viewed in the context of a long line of Sufi masters who have long been a center of attention \\"for their admirers and followers, both historically and currently\\".Zeki Saritoprak, \\"Muslim Perception of Fethullah Gulen and the Hizmet Movement: Accommodating or Hindering Modern Turkey?\\" in Alternative Islamic Discourses and Religious (eds. Carool Kersten & Susanne Olsson: Ashgate, 2013), p. 70. Beginning in 2008, the Dutch government investigated the movement's activities in the Netherlands in response to questions from Parliament. The first two investigations, performed by the AIVD, concluded that the movement did not form a breeding ground for radicalism and found no indications that the movement worked against integration or that it was involved in terrorism or religious radicalization. A further academic study sketched a portrait of a socially conservative, inwardly directed movement with an opaque organizational structure, but said that its members tend to be highly successful in society and thus form no threat to integration. Hizmet- affiliated foundations and businesses were estimated as worth $20-to-$50 billion in 2015. Socio-economic activities=Schools= The movement is active in education (kindergarten‚Äìuniversity) as well as civic opportunities in other areas such as for interfaith dialogue, humanitarian aid, media, finance, and health. Most G√ºlen Movement schools are private. By 2017 it was estimated 1.2 million Turks have passed through Hizmet schools (including Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's son in-law, Berat Albayrak); and its educational footprint extends to over 160 countries. In 2009 it was estimated that members of the G√ºlen Movement ran schools around the world in which more than two million students were enrolled. Estimates of the number of schools and educational institutions vary widely; it appears there are about 300 G√ºlen Movement schools in Turkey and over 1,000 schools worldwide. Beyond the borders of Turkey, many G√ºlen schools can be found in countries with large populations of people of Turkish descent. G√ºlen schools in predominantly non- Turkish Muslim countries provide families with an alternative to madrasa education. G√ºlen schools have received both criticism and praise. Charter schools in the United States In 2011, it was estimated that over 120 charter schools in the United States in 25 states were operated by participants of the G√ºlen movement. The largest numbers of such schools were in Texas (33 schools, Harmony schools, run by the Cosmos Foundation); Ohio (19 schools, known as Horizon Science Academies and operated by Concept Schools Inc.); and California (14 schools, operated by the Magnolia Foundation). The Philadelphia Inquirer reported at the time that G√ºlen schools were one of the largest users of H1B visas, receiving approval for 684 such visas in 2009. The Inquirer reported that the FBI, Labor Department, and Education Department were investigating whether some charter school employees employed via H1B visas misused funds by kicking back a portion of their salaries to movement groups. The investigation had no tie to terrorism, and there was \\"no indication the American charter network has a religious agenda in the classroom\\". A 60 Minutes episode profiled G√ºlen movement-operated charter schools in the U.S. in May 2012. The profile estimated that there were about 130 affiliated schools nationwide, with about 36 Harmony School in Texas, serving \\"mostly underprivileged students\\" and all emphasizing math and science. The episode said that the schools generally received high marks for the quality of education, but also said that G√ºlen's reclusive nature \\"invites conspiracy theories that he's running Turkey from the Poconos and is bent on global Muslim domination\\" and that \\"[o]ne statement involves immigration fraud: that the schools are providing work visas for hundreds of G√ºlen followers from Turkey.\\" Professor Joshua Hendrick of Loyola University Maryland, who studies the movement, said that G√ºlen himself \\"does not have a direct hand in operating\\" the charter schools, and it was reported that G√ºlen has never visited the schools. The Harmony Schools in Texas do not teach religion, and the charter network says that some 7.8% of its teachers are non- Americans. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2016 that around 150 U.S. charter schools were tied to the G√ºlen movement, \\"ranging from networks in Texas, Illinois and Florida to stand-alone academies in Maryland\\".Beckie Strum, Gulen Movement's Charter Schools May Be Caught Up in Turkey-U.S. Standoff, Wall Street Journal (July 19, 2016). The Journal stated that like other charter schools \\"blacks and Hispanics in underserved neighborhoods\\" made up the majority of the student body, with common themes including \\"an emphasis on math and science education, Turkish language classes and sponsored trips to Turkey\\". Hendrick said that in the upheaval following the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, proposed new charter schools and charters up for renewal \\"that are run by Turkish-Americans and are said to be connected with the cleric\\" could run into increased opposition, as the Turkish government has sought \\"to bring down Mr. Gulen through U.S. charter schools they claim are connected to him\\". =Dialogue= G√ºlen and Pope John Paul II The movement's avowal of interfaith dialogue grew out of G√ºlen's personal engagement in interfaith dialogue, largely inspired by the example of one of his influences, Said Nursi. G√ºlen has met with leaders of other religions, including Pope John Paul II, the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, and Israeli Sephardic Head Rabbi Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron. G√ºlen advocates cooperation between followers of different religions as well as those practicing different forms of Islam (such as Sunnism or Alevism). G√ºlen's call for interfaith dialogue has influenced three generations of movement followers. G√ºlen movement participants have founded a number of institutions across the World that promote interfaith and intercultural dialogue activities. Among these are the Journalists and Writers Foundation in Istanbul, the Rumi Forum in Washington and the Indialogue Foundation in New Delhi. = Media = Movement participants have set up a number of media organizations to promote its core values such as love, tolerance, hope, dialogue, activism, mutual acceptance and respect. These media organs include TV stations (Samanyolu TV, Mehtap TV), (Ebru TV) (English), the newspapers Zaman, Today's Zaman (English), magazines and journals in Turkish like Aksiyon, Sƒ±zƒ±ntƒ±, Yeni √úmit, The Fountain Magazine (English), Hira (Arabic), The International Cihan News Agency and the radio station . = Humanitarian aid = The movement runs charity and humanitarian aid organizations which are transnationally active. The leading one among them is the Istanbul-based Kimse Yok Mu Association (KYM). KYM organizes charity campaigns to help those in need in different parts of the world. Like any other activities of the G√ºlen-movement, KYM runs local projects responding to specific needs. KYM holds UN Ecosoc Special status. Another charity organization Embrace Relief was established in New Jersey and is active in the Americas, Asia and Africa. = Professional associations = While being both praised and criticized for being market friendly, the G√ºlen movement has established various professional associations and business networks. Among them Istanbul based TUSKON is the major non-profit business confederation which states to promote economic solutions as well as social and political ones. Another one called TUCSIAD is based in China, in addition to DTIK's Asia-Pacific Group which supports the G√ºlen movement outside of Turkey in China, hoping to influence Turkish politics from the outside. Criticism Fethullah G√ºlen's and the G√ºlen movement's views and practices have been discussed in international conferences. In October 2007 in London a conference was sponsored by the University of Birmingham, the Dialogue Society, the Irish School of Ecumenics, Leeds Metropolitan University, the London Middle East Institute, the Middle East Institute and the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London. Niagara Foundation of Chicago, together with several academic institutions, organized \\"The G√ºlen Movement: Paradigms, Projects and Aspirations\\" conference, which was held at University of Chicago on 11‚Äì13 November 2010. In 2016 the movement was criticized by then the future US National Security Advisor Michael Flynn saying, \\"G√ºlen portrays himself as a moderate, but he is in fact a radical Islamist. He has publicly boasted about his ‚Äúsoldiers‚Äù waiting for his orders to do whatever he directs them to do.\\" Flynn likened the movement to the Muslim Brotherhood by saying \\"Likewise, Hassan al-Banna, defined the first phase of pre-emptive jihad as a long and quiet process that can take as long as a quarter of a century, to prepare the forces for a decisive strike.\\" Flynn further went on saying \\"From Turkey‚Äôs point of view, Washington is harboring Turkey‚Äôs Osama bin Laden.\\" In 2017 German magazine Der Spiegel called the movement a \\"secretive and dangerous cult\\" while calling G√ºlen a suspicious individual. Saying, \\"the movement calls itself a tolerant service movement, while those who have left the movement call it a secretive Islamist organization with Fethullah G√ºlen as its leader\\". The article said pupils attending the \\"cults\\" schools in Germany were under immense pressure from their abi's (tutors) who were telling them which books to read, which movies to watch, which friends to meet and whether to see their families or not. While the abi's were keeping a protocol of all those staying in the cult's dormitories. Der Spiegel also criticized the movement regarding its activities towards freedom of the press. Arguing, despite G√ºlen emphasizing how much he cares of the freedom of the press in interviews, the movement launched a campaign towards the newspaper in 2012 after an article was written regarding the \\"cult\\". During which 2000 readers, all of whom were alike each other were sent by the cult and wrote letters of complaint to the press council. All of which were rejected by the council. Der Spiegel said the movement distorted events and threatened those who spoke against it and accused Der Spiegel of having ties to the Turkish mafia. While Gareth Jenkins of The Sunday Times said, despite portraying itself as a peaceful educational movement, the G√ºlen organization never hesitates using anti-democratic and anti-liberal methods. =Bombing of ≈ûemdinli Bookstore, 2005= On November 9 2005, a bookstore was bombed in ≈ûemdinli. The Prosecutor of the case, Ferhat Sarƒ±kaya, prepared a criminal indictment in which Turkey's Commander of Land Forces Ya≈üar B√ºy√ºkanƒ±t was accused of forming a gang and plotting the bombing. A decade later, prosecutor Sarƒ±kaya confessed that he was ordered by G√ºlenists to include General Ya≈üar B√ºy√ºkanƒ±t into the criminal indictment, in order to prevent his promotion in the army (Chief of General Staff) and to ease the grip on G√ºlenist structures within the army. =Assassination of Hrant Dink, 2007= The role of G√ºlen movement in the assassination of journalist Hrant Dink in Istanbul was brought to public attention. Hakan Bakƒ±rcƒ±oglu, one of Hrant Dink's lawyers, said in an interview with Deutsche Welle that the underaged perpetrator, Og√ºn Samast, had help from third parties, including people connected to the Istanbul and Trabzon police forces. Four prosecutors in the trial have been dismissed from their posts due to their ties with the movement, and for failing to make progress with the case. Furthermore police commissioners Ramazan Aky√ºrek and Ali Fuat Yƒ±lmazer were accused of not sharing their foreknowledge of the attack with the prosecutors, gendarmarie, or the intelligence services despite being briefed of a planned assassination several times. =Ergenekon trials, Sledgehammer trial, 2008= According to investigative journalist Nedim ≈ûener, the G√ºlen movement used the assassination of Hrant Dink, the assassination of priest Andrea Santoro, the Zirve Publishing House murders as well as other events, to create an atmosphere and illusion of a clandestine Kemalist ultra-nationalist organization holding responsible for these misdeeds. With the start of the Ergenekon trials, this alleged organization was called \\"Ergenekon terrorist organization\\". The G√ºlenist media, in particular Taraf, Zaman and Samanyolu Haber TV, were instrumental in shaping the public opinion during these operations. In these court cases, military officials, parliamentarians and journalists were accused of plotting a violent coup to oust the government. It later turned out that these cases were based on fabricated evidence, and that most such fabrications were produced by the G√ºlenists in the police. In 2011, Nedim ≈ûener was included to the Ergenekon trials for being member of Ergenekon and subsequently was arrested and held in pre-trial detention. =Cheating at the Public Service Entry Examinations, 2010 = In 2010, the exam questions and answer keys of the Public Personnel Selection Examination (KPSS) were stolen and handed out to the certain G√ºlenist members. The members with high scores were placed strategically in the critical state bodies. =Redesigning of Turkish political landscape= Members of the G√ºlen movement inside the intelligence agency were accused of reshaping Turkish politics to a more \\"workable form\\" by leaking secretly filmed sex tapes and corruption tapes of both government members and opposition members, with the resignation of main opposition leader Deniz Baykal in 2010 as one of the most notable example. Politicians with no recorded scandalous behavior are believed to be killed like the Great Union Party leader Muhsin Yazƒ±cƒ±oƒülu, who died in a helicopter crash in 2009. =Assassination of Andrei Karlov= Turkish and Russian officials declared the G√ºlen movement to be responsible for the assassination of Russian ambassador Andrei Karlov, and accused the movement of aiming to damage Russia‚ÄìTurkey relations that had been normalizing since the 2016 Turkish coup d'√©tat attempt. =Collaboration with the Kurdistan Workers' Party= Since 2013 G√ºlen movement has been accused by the Turkish Government of collaborating with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). In 2014 the movement reportedly conducted several meeting with the PKK, in parts of Northern Iraq under PKK control. In 2015, Turkish Government said the movement had leaked the identity of 329 Turkish Gendermarie informants to the PKK. Who were then executed by the PKK. On 15 April 2016 during the Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict G√ºlen movement member Brigadier General Ali Osman G√ºrcan deliberately sent 17 soldiers to a house that was packed with IEDs according to the testimony of his companions. Which led to the death of a police officer and wounding of 8 soldiers. The house was marked on a map with the code 'P368' for IED's, which G√ºrcan erased from the map. Leading to a brawl that led to his companions calling him a \\"traitor\\". G√ºrcan later participated in 2016 Turkish coup d'√©tat attempt under the Peace at Home Council. He was arrested after the coups failure and charged with life imprisonment. Designation as a terrorist group G√ºlen movement is deemed a designated terrorist group by the following countries and international organizations: * , since May 2016 * Gulf Cooperation Council, since October 2016 * Organization of Islamic Cooperation, since October 2016 * , since December 2018 Northern Cyprus, recognised only by Turkey and considered by the international community to be part of the Republic of Cyprus, also designated the G√ºlen movement as a terrorist organization in July 2016. In 2017, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and to the British Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee there was no \\"evidence to justify the designation of the G√ºlenists as a terrorist organisation by the UK\\".Repression or recovery? UK's relations with Turkey, Parliament.uk, 25 March 2017 The same year, Gilles de Kerchove, EU Counter- terrorism Coordinator, said that the European Union didn't see the G√ºlen movement as a terrorist organisation and that the EU would need \\"substantive\\" evidence to change its stance.EU says needs concrete evidence from Turkey to deem Gulen network as terrorist, Tulay Karadeniz, Tuvan Gumrukcu, November 30th 2017, Reuters In 2018, in a conference with Turkish President Erdogan, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Germany needed more evidence to classify the G√ºlen movement as a terrorist organization.Germany needs more evidence to declare Gulen movement illegal: Merkel, Reuters Political involvement According to academic researcher Svante E. Cornell, director of the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute & Silk Road Studies Program, \\"With only slight exaggeration, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) as well as the government it has led could be termed a coalition of religious orders.\\" \\"[...T]he G√ºlen movement stayed away from electoral politics, focusing instead on increasing its presence in the state bureaucracy. The Hizmet movement‚Äôs stated success in this regard would initially make it Erdoƒüan‚Äôs main partner, but also his eventual nemesis.\\" =2002‚Äì2013 collaboration with the AKP= From 2002 to 2013, the G√ºlen movement comprehensively collaborated with the Justice and Development Party (AKP) and Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan in obtaining political power in Turkey. Questions have arisen about the G√ºlen movement's possible involvement in the ongoing Ergenekon investigation, which critics have characterized as \\"a pretext\\" by the government \\"to neutralize dissidents\\" in Turkey. In March 2011, seven Turkish journalists were arrested, including Ahmet ≈ûƒ±k, who had been writing a book, \\"Imamin Ordusu\\" (The Imam's Army),Turkish authorities launch raids to censor book before publication in the Guardian of 5 April 2011; accessed on 11 April 2011 which states that the G√ºlen movement has infiltrated the country's security forces. As ≈ûƒ±k was taken into police custody, he shouted, \\"Whoever touches it [the movement] gets burned!\\". Upon his arrest, drafts of the book were confiscated and its possession was banned. ≈ûƒ±k has also been charged with being part of the stated Ergenekon plot, despite being an investigator of the plot before his arrest.Details can be found in English on the site of the Democratic Turkey Forum; accessed on 5 April 2001. In the footnotes to translated passages of the book you can find other works on the subject. In a reply, Abdullah Bozkurt, from the G√ºlen movement newspaper Today's Zaman, said Ahmet ≈ûƒ±k was not being an investigative journalist conducting \\"independent research\\", but was hatching \\"a plot designed and put into action by the terrorist network itself\\".The alleged terrorist network is the Ergenekon organization; see Article of 29 March 2011 ; accessed on 5 April 2011 According to Gareth H. Jenkins, a Senior Fellow of the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute & Silk Road Studies Joint Center at Johns Hopkins University: The G√ºlen movement has also been implicated in what the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) - and after 2013 also President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan - have said were illegal court decisions against members of the Turkish military, including many during the Ergenekon investigation. =2013 AKP corruption scandal= On 17 December 2013, an investigation into stated corrupt practices by several bureaucrats, ministers, mayors, and family members of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) of Turkey was uncovered, resulting in widespread protests and calls for the resignation of the government led by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. Due to the high level of political influence by the G√ºlen movement in Turkey, it is rumored to be facilitated by the movement's influence on the Turkish police force and the judiciary, the investigation was said to be a result of a break in previously friendly relations between the Islamist-rooted government and the movement. President Erdoƒüan and the AKP (the ruling party of Turkey) have targeted the movement since December 2013. Immediately after the corruption statements, the government subjugated the judiciary, media and civil society which were critical of the government's authoritarian trend in recent years. After the corruption statements surfaced, Erdogan labelled it as a \\"civilian coup\\" against his government. Since then, Erdogan has shuffled, dismissed or jailed hundreds of police officers, judges, prosecutors and journalists in the name of fighting against a \\"Parallel State\\" within the Turkish state. =Crackdown against the G√ºlen movement from 2014= On 14 December 2014 Turkish police arrested more than two dozen senior journalists and media executives connected with the G√ºlen movement on various charges. A statement by the US State Department cautioned Turkey not to violate its \\"own democratic foundations\\" while drawing attention to raids against media outlets \\"openly critical of the current Turkish government\\". EU Foreign Affairs chief Federica Mogherini and EU Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn said that the arrests went \\"against European values\\" and \\"are incompatible with the freedom of media, which is a core principle of democracy\\". On 20 January 2015, Turkish police launched raids in Ankara and three other cities, detaining some 20 people suspected of illegally eavesdropping on President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan and other senior officials. The suspects are linked to Turkey's telecommunications authority and to its scientific and technological research center TUBITAK. Local media said the move was aimed at the \\"parallel structure\\" ‚Äî the term Erdogan uses to refer to G√ºlen's supporters in the judiciary, police and other institutions. The Turkish government took over the G√ºlenist Zaman Daily, on 4 March 2016. Turkish police entered the Zaman's headquarters by force and fired tear gas at the protesting journalists and civilians. Hundreds of protestors were injured. In his efforts to eradicate the movement within the country the Turkish National Security Council has identified the movement as the \\"G√ºlenist Terror Organisation\\" (\\"Fethullah√ßƒ± Ter√∂r √ñrg√ºt√º\\", FET√ñ). The government has also been targeting individuals and businessmen who have supported the movement's organizations and activities. =Purge of movement in Turkey after July 2016= In reaction to the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, led by a military faction operating outside the chain of command, the Turkish government quickly stated the coup's leader to be G√ºlen. In following days and weeks, a massive crackdown affected all entities affiliated to the G√ºlen movements, from individuals to businesses, newspapers to schools and universities. Following the assassination of Andrey Karlov, the Turkish government was reportedly investigating the assassin's links to the \\"G√ºlenist Terrorist Organisation\\" (FET√ñ); in a speech, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan said that the perpetrator was a member of FET√ñ. =Prosecutions; extraditions to Turkey; political asylums granted = Among Turkish citizens within Turkey convicted for alleged memberships in the G√ºlen movement are Turkey's honorary president of Amnesty International, Taner Kilic, and A.I.'s Turkish branch, Idil Eser, in July 2020 thusly convicted.https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/turkey/.premium-in-turkey- twitter-is-the-enemy-of-the-people-1.9040612 , Turkey had successfully pressured a number of countries, especially those in Africa and the former Soviet Union, to extradite over 80 alleged g√ºlenists to Turkey. In 2019 it was reported that Interpol had denied Turkey's appeals of the agency's rejections of Turkey's red notice requests regarding 464 fugitives, citing Interpol's legal definition of the 2016 Turkish coup d'√©tat attempt as not terrorism but a failed military putsch. In 2018, bout 25,000 Turkish asylum requests were filed by alleged g√ºlenists in the European Union (a rise of 50 per cent from 2017), with Germany's share 10,000 and Greece's about 5,000. Within the U.S., according to news reports, a number of G√ºlenists successfully receiving political asylum status are resettled in New Jersey.

The CAD $333 million project comprised the construction of three sewage treatment plants and connected various sewage pipe networks with lift stations to treat all sanitary sewage in Halifax and Dartmouth. It was completed in 2010. History For two and a half centuries prior to this project, raw sewage was discharged untreated directly into Halifax Harbour. The harbour waters have been the recipient of approximately 200 million litres of untreated raw sewage every day, enough to fill 25 Olympic-size swimming pools. Shellfish harvesting from the harbour and swimming within the harbour have been prohibited for health reasons. The historic settlements of Halifax and Dartmouth were built with no thought to sewage treatment as a means of waste disposal. Throughout the 19th century, sewers were designed as a single system, with no separation between sanitary sewers, which carried domestic human waste, and stormwater drainage systems. The combined sewers simply emptied into the harbour from dozens of outfalls at the bottom of each street that met the waterfront. By the mid-20th century, it was clear that the system was not environmentally sustainable. Millions of litres of sewage were dumped into the harbour daily, consisting not only of simple human waste, but of pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, fertilizers, and a host of other harmful material. Sewage treatment plants were proposed for both Halifax and Dartmouth beginning in the 1970s, however, the separate municipalities were never able to reach a consensus for system design and construction. That decade saw the Halifax Regional Water Commission begin to charge its customers a pollution surcharge which was intended to fund such a system. Meanwhile, a host of different provincial and federal governments came and went and overall funding was never finalized. It was only following municipal amalgamation which saw the cities of Halifax and Dartmouth dissolved and merged with all municipalities in Halifax County to form the Halifax Regional Municipality in 1996 that the sewage treatment issue gained necessary traction and moved beyond the planning stage. Current project Under the Harbour Solutions Project, a treatment system has been under construction since the early 2000s with three plants being built (one in downtown Halifax, one in downtown Dartmouth, and one in Herring Cove on the southwest side of the harbour) as well as extensive collector piping to close all sewage outfalls into the harbour and redirect sewage into the treatment plants. Total cost of the project is estimated to be approximately CA$333 million. On February 11, 2008, the treatment facility in downtown Halifax officially commenced operation. The Dartmouth plant came online on July 10, 2008 and the Herring Cove plant was expected to open in late fall 2008. Harbour sewage is also mitigated to a lesser extent by the aforementioned existing plants at Mill Cove, in Bedford and another at Eastern Passage. Results The Halifax Regional Municipality announced on July 9, 2008 that the harbour beaches, Black Rock Beach at Point Pleasant Park and the beach at Dingle Park would re-open to swimming on August 2, 2008. Fecal coliform bacteria levels at these locations were either undetectable or at safe levels for swimming. Eleven lifeguards would patrol the beaches. The improved water quality in Halifax Harbour during the summer of 2008 was a direct result of the newly operating Halifax and Dartmouth sewage plants. The clarity of the water improved to the point where the municipal government hired commercial divers to remove debris from the floor of the harbour along the popular boardwalk in the Historic Properties; prior to that summer, the debris was seldom visible due to the opaque water as a result of the untreated sewage. 2009 breakdown However repeated breakdowns of the system in 2008 resulted in regular beach closures again and complaints about foul odours and sewage filled basements. A massive failure of the central plant in January 2009 caused raw sewage to again be poured into the Harbour.*\\"Sewage Treatment Plant Flooded\\" CBC Radio News January 19, 2009 The 2009 breakdown was caused by what Tim Bousquet of The Coast called \\"a perfect storm\\" of technical errors. A Nova Scotia Power electrical outage spurred a technician to activate two backup generators to maintain operation of the plant, but the electrical load was unevenly distributed between the two generators and one became overloaded and failed. A floodgate, designed to close in emergencies to isolate the plant's \\"wet well\\" from the deep pipe feeding sewage to the plant, was powered by the overloaded generator. A switch designed to allow the second generator to power the floodgate happened to fail. Owing to the failed generator, only one of the four sewage pumps could convey sewage out of the wet well, and the volume of sewage began to rise, shorting out the electrical junction boxes placed above the pumps. With the floodgate jammed partially open and all four pumps inoperable, the 85-foot- deep wet well filled with sewage. The electrical control room above the wet well then also filled with sewage, destroying all the equipment there. The incident brought criticism from the federal government and the public, and city officials promised to get the plant back online by Spring 2010. On June 25, 2010, the Halifax Wastewater Treatment Plant was returned to full operation, and it was announced that Black Rock Beach and Dingle Park Beach would be safe for swimming again.*\\"Halifax sewage treatment plant back online\\" CBC News June 25, 2010 Sewage discharged Untreated sewage continues to be discharged into Halifax harbour due to severed sewer lines during construction of the new treatment plant.\\"Untreated sewage still flowing into Halifax Harbour\\" CBC news.

He is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) Basketball Hall of Fame. His 1,122 wins during his 52 seasons at McKendree University of Lebanon, Illinois, are second most by any men's or women's basketball head coach at a four-year college or university in the United States. This includes any and all levels or divisions of the NCAA and NAIA. The only other coaches at a four-year school with 1,000 or more wins are Pat Summitt, Danny Miles, Mike Krzyzewski, Herb Magee, Tara VanDerveer, Geno Auriemma, and Sylvia Hatchell. On March 7, 2012, Statham was named as one of the coaches on the NAIA 75th Anniversary All-Star Team.http://www.naia.org/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=27900&ATCLID;=205389815 Early years Statham was born on May 29, 1937 in Brookport, Illinois. His father, Harry Statham Sr., died of pneumonia and was buried on the day Statham was born. Statham was raised by his mother and his grandfather, Rufus Dye, who encouraged his grandson to get an education and to not smoke or drink.Dodd Statham said of his mom, \\"[She] wanted me to get a college degree. I was raised so that reputation is so important, the family name, strength, honesty, trustworthiness, respectfulness, ambition.\\"Dodd Statham graduated with a bachelor's degree from McKendree College in 1960. He then enrolled at the University of Illinois, where he served as a graduate assistant for the men's basketball and track teams. He earned a master of science degree in physical education from Illinois. Family life Statham is married to Rose Statham; they have no children, and live in Belleville, Illinois. Coaching career=Junior high= Statham began his coaching career while an undergraduate student at McKendree. He guided the boys' basketball team at O'Fallon Junior High School in Illinois while taking college courses at night. =High school= From O'Fallon, Statham moved on to coach the varsity boys' basketball team for two seasons at Manito Forman High School (Manito, Illinois). His 1961-62 squad had a 9‚Äì16 record and his 1962-63 squad finished 10‚Äì13. Statham then moved on to Dwight Township High School (Dwight, Illinois) where he coached for three seasons from 1963 to 1966, posting a cumulative win-loss record of 24‚Äì45.http://www.ihsa.org/school/records/sum0429.htm Illinois HS Records =McKendree University= In his tenure at McKendree, a member of the American Midwest Conference (AMC), Statham has led the Bearcats to post-season play 40 times in 46 seasons. Statham has coached McKendree to all 15 of its NAIA national men's basketball championship tournament berths, including five straight appearances from 1999-2004. Since his first season in 1966-67, Statham's teams have averaged nearly 23 wins per season. His teams have won 20 or more games 35 times. McKendree also ranks among the NAIA's top programs in terms of winning percentage over the past decade.‚ÄúHead Coach Harry Statham.‚Äù Statham has had 70 players receive post-season accolades. Ten of those players have earned NAIA All-America honors. Eric Hobbie, the most recent All-American, garnered first-team NAIA Division I All-America honors in 2009-10 after earning second-team recognition in 2008-09. Additionally, Statham has coached three players who were drafted in the professional ranks: Paul Funkhouser, a supplemental pick of the NBA's Chicago Bulls and the Carolina Cougars of the American Basketball Association; Dale Haverman, a fifth-round pick of the Seattle SuperSonics in 1977; and Matt Laur, a fourth round pick of the National Basketball Development League (D-League) draft by the Columbus Riverdragons. Many McKendree athletes who Statham has coached have gone on to successful coaching careers on both the high school and collegiate levels.‚ÄúHead Coach Harry Statham.‚Äù About his players, Statham said, \\"I always recruit the right kinds of players. We do not want thugs that play good basketball. We want them to be good, solid people. We don't want people that are going to flunk out. We want good people, good students and good basketball players‚Äîin that order.\\"Ellsworth Regarding his coaching philosophy, Statham said, \\"We do things consistently well. Our program is sound. We're very team-oriented, and we've tried to sell that from the very beginning. When you play hard and play together and do things fundamentally sound, you're going to be competitive. Our primary focus is to play hard, play well and try to do it as a team.\\"Ellsworth Statham's on-court demeanor does not include yelling and ref-baiting Dodd Said Statham, \\"I don't like the [television] color commentators (saying) how you gotta work the referee and draw a T. We're trying to play the right way. They're out there saying you've got to bend the rules, step out there a little bit. They turn me off, I really don't enjoy that.\\"Dodd In addition to his coaching duties, from 1966 to May, 2010, Statham served as the university's athletic director, and he is an assistant professor of health and human performance. 1987-88 team This Bearcat squad opened the season with 22 straight victories en route to a school-record 35 wins and the University's first-ever NAIA Tournament berth. In the first round of the tournament, McKendree and its opponent Huron College (S.D.), scored a record 231 points, as the Bearcats triumphed 124‚Äì107. The combined point total set an NAIA Tournament record that stood until 2006. 1996-97 team Statham led this team to a quarterfinal spot in the NAIA Tournament. The Bearcats defeated two higher-ranked opponents to reach the NAIA Elite Eight, the team's best-ever finish at the national tournament until the success of the 2002-03 team. 2002-03 team McKendree compiled a 34‚Äì4 overall record. A 10‚Äì0 mark in the AMC marked the first time that the Bearcats went undefeated in the league. At the 2003 NAIA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, McKendree posted three victories to advance to the NAIA Final Four. The Bearcats lost to eventual national champions Concordia University (California) in the semifinals. During the season, the Bearcats earned their first No. 1 ranking in the NAIA poll and entered the NAIA national tournament as the No. 2 seed, the highest seed ever for McKendree. The Bearcats also notched three winning streaks of at least 10 games during the season. Matt Laur was recognized as NAIA Player of the Year, the first McKendree athlete to earn the award in Division I. Laur also became the Bearcats‚Äô all-time leading scorer in 2002-03. 2006-07 team McKendree used a late season surge and runner-up finish in the American Midwest Conference Tournament to earn its first NAIA Division I National Championship bid in three years. Statham guided the Bearcats to an overall record of 23‚Äì12 and an 8‚Äì4 mark in AMC regular- season play. In the 2007 NAIA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, the Bearcats topped Mountain State (West Virginia) in the first round and lost and were eliminated in the second round by Faulkner University (Alabama). 2007-08 team Statham entered the 2007-08 season with 938 coaching victories and as the all-time wins leader in men's college basketball history at the four-year level. He, Don Meyer, and Bob Knight were at the time the only men's basketball coaches at senior colleges or universities with 900 coaching wins. This team finished the season with a 27‚Äì7 record. In the 2008 NAIA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, the Bearcats beat Texas Wesleyan University in the first round and were eliminated in the second round by Campbellsville University. 2008-09 team At the end of the 2009 season, Statham had won 995 games at McKendree, the most by any men's four-year college coach. The Bearcats won the AMC with a perfect 14-0 record in conference play. The 2008-2009 Bearcats finished 30-6 on the season and made it to the Elite 8 in the 2009 NAIA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. They defeated Northwestern Oklahoma State University by a score of 83-58 in the first round, and defeated Texas Wesleyan University by a score of 87-75 in the second round. Then the Bearcats lost to MidAmerica Nazarene University in the Elite 8, by a score of 59-55. Departure and Controversy On Monday, March 5, 2018, after a 12-16 season, Statham was informed by the McKendree Athletic Director that the school was seeking either his retirement or resignation. The next day, the school announced that Statham's time as coach had ended. Soon after, Statham took to social media, posting \\"\\"The release that came out, from the school, implied I resigned or retired. That was not the case. I am getting phone calls and email from friends who thought I retired,\\" and continued, \\"I said I did not want to retire and didn't want to retire. I said I wasn't a quitter, wanted to leave on a winning note or a winning season.\\"http://www.kmov.com/story/37696272/mckendree-universitys- basketball-coach-benched-after-50-years Milestones #On Nov. 15, 2002, Statham guided the Bearcats to an 88-87 victory against Mountain State, making him the NAIA's all-time leader in career victories with career win No. 817.Cummings, 15 Nov 2002 #On Dec. 1, 2004, Statham led McKendree to an 83‚Äì72 victory over Maryville University, marking his 880th career win, pushing Statham past North Carolina head coach Dean Smith for the all-time wins record among college basketball coaches.Cummings, 1 Dec 2004 #On Nov. 25, 2005, Statham reached the 900-win mark as the Bearcats defeated Freed-Hardeman University, 73‚Äì69. #On January 12, 2008, Statham reached the 950-win mark as the Bearcats defeated Williams Baptist College, 98‚Äì73. #On December 9, 2008, Statham won his 975th game, defeating Olivet Nazarene University 78-75 in overtime, and coached his 1,354th game, tying with former Mount St. Mary's coach Jim Phelan for the most games coached. #On December 16, 2008, Statham won his 976th game, defeating Concordia Seminary and coached his 1,355 game surpassing former Mt.

History of Scouting in London  Baden-Powell House in London For the history of Scouting in London see Scouting, The Scout Association and the British Boy Scouts. The first Commissioner for London of Baden-Powell Boy Scouts was Sir Francis Vane. Vane later became the second President of the British Boy Scouts which had begun in Battersea, London. In 1909, the London Diocesan Boy Scout Corp, was formed by the Church of England. One of the oldest Scout Groups in London is the 1st City of London Scout Group, which is still notable as the only Scout Group in the traditional City of London.

Included in these new Scout counties were districts which had previously been part of the neighbouring home counties, but were now within the borders of Greater London. London Scouts celebrated the centenary of Scouting on 1 Aug 2007 in many ways, including the New Year's Day Parade in which many Explorer Scouts were led by the Enfield District Scout Band, LIVE 07, Festival of Scouting, and a Sunrise Ceremony at the London Eye.

The county is divided into two districts: * Bromley * Bexley = Greater London South West Scout County = Greater London South West Scout County is a Scout County of the Scout Association in the United Kingdom, covering an area stretching from Sanderstead in the South East to Hampton and Whitton in the North West. The county is divided into five districts which have the same boundaries as the five London Boroughs: * Croydon * Richmond upon Thames * Royal Kingston * Sutton * Wimbledon and Wandle (Merton) The county has 3 Scout Bands, Kingston & Malden Scout and Guide Band, 1st Hook Scout and Guide Band and Wimbledon, Wandle and Sutton District's Scout and Guide Band.  Activity Centres and Camp sites  The White House at Gilwell Park Three of the six Scout Association Activity Centres are in Greater London. Baden-Powell House is a hostel and conference centre in central London. Gilwell Park is a camp site and activity centre, as well as a training and conference centre for Scout Leaders. It is close to Chingford, London. The White House at Gilwell Park has been the headquarters of The Scout Association since 2001, although Baden-Powell House (the former headquarters) still facilitates some departments of the Scout Association. Downe Scout Activity Centre is in Kent, but was owned by the Greater London South East Scouts from 1987 to 2005, when the site became under the direct control of The Scout Association. The Greater London Middlesex West Scout County (GLMW) is responsible for the PACCAR Chalfont Heights campsite 30 minutes from London at Chalfont St Peter in Buckinghamshire. Originally purchased in 1938, it was operated by Scout Headquarters until 1970 when it taken over by the Greater London Middlesex West County as its County campsite and Training Centre.Chalfont Heights camp site The current name was adopted following major sponsorship from a charitable foundation owned by PACCAR Inc, the multi-national heavy vehicle manufacturer. Ealing & Hanwell District in GLMW own and run the Walter Davies Activity Centre near Stoke Poges, and the City of Westminster Scout District is responsible for Coombe Farm Campsite, located in Addington.Coombe Farm Campsite Districts in Greater London North Scout Association County own or operate campsites and activity centres at: Danemead Scout Campsite near Broxbourne (Enfield District Scouts with Chingford District in Greater London NE), Scout Park at Bounds Green (Haringey District Scouts) and Frith Grange near Mill Hill (Barnet Borough District Scouts). The Training ship RRS Discovery, Captain Scott's Antarctic expedition vessel, moored on Victoria Embankment near Temple Underground station was used by London Sea Scouts between 1937 and 1979, when it was handed over to Maritime Trust and relocated in Dundee. The Dockland Scout Project was then created. The Project is on the Isle of Dogs, in East London, east of the financial City of London and opposite Greenwich across the River Thames. Districts in Greater London North East Scout Association County own or operate campsites and activity centres at: Crow Camp near Noak Hill (Romford District), Fairmead Scout Campsite near High Beach (East London District), Hargreaves Scout Campsite, Little Heath (Ilford East District), and the Michael Mallinson Centre, Highams Park (Waltham Forest South District). Greater London South Scout Association County owns the South London Scout Centre, the closest camping centre to central London at Dulwich.

It stars Robert Montgomery, Rosalind Russell and Dame May Whitty in her Hollywood film debut at age 72. She reprised her role in the stage drama in London and New York City. A critical success, Night Must Fall was named the best film of the year by the National Board of Review. A 1964 remake stars Albert Finney. Plot Robert Montgomery and Dame May Whitty in Night Must Fall Rosalind Russell and Robert Montgomery in Night Must Fall Mrs. Bramson (Dame May Whitty) is an irascible elderly woman who holds court in a small English village. She pretends to need a wheelchair, and impulsively threatens to fire her maid, Dora (Merle Tottenham), for allegedly stealing a chicken and breaking china. Meanwhile, the household learns that the police have searched a nearby river looking for the missing Mrs. Shellbrook, a guest at the local hotel. Dora distracts Mrs. Bramson by mentioning her Irish boyfriend, Danny (Robert Montgomery), who works at that hotel. Danny comes by to visit Dora, who asks Mrs. Bramson to speak with him. Perceiving that Mrs. Bramson is a hypochondriac who only affects her need for a wheelchair, Danny is charming toward her and says that she reminds him of his mother. He tells Mrs. Bramson that he loves Dora and would marry her if he had a better job. Mrs. Bramson obliges, and he becomes her servant. Mrs. Bramson's niece and companion, Olivia Grayne (Rosalind Russell), is suspicious of Danny, but Mrs. Bramson dismisses her concerns. When Mrs. Bramson's attorney, Justin Laurie (Alan Marshal), arrives to give his client money, he warns her not to keep so much cash in her possession; but she dismisses his concerns, as well. Meanwhile, Justin, who is in love with Olivia, asks her to marry him, but she refuses because their relationship lacks any true romance. Justin leaves, feeling dejected, and Danny sees Mrs. Bramson putting the cash into her safe. Olivia's fears are heightened when she catches Danny lying to Mrs. Bramson about a shawl that allegedly belonged to his mother: Olivia notices that the price tag is still on the shawl. Even so, Olivia cannot help being attracted to Danny. Dora discovers Mrs. Shellbrook's decapitated body in the forest. Olivia accuses Danny of the murder, but he denies it. Again, Mrs. Bramson dismisses her niece's concerns because she has grown very fond of Danny. The rest of the household does not feel comfortable being in the house while a killer is at large, but Mrs. Bramson feels safe enough to stay with Danny. Later that night, Mrs. Bramson hears noises and becomes frightened. When she screams for Danny, he comes in and calms her down by giving her something to drink and trying to lull her to sleep. Then Danny to her shock and horror, suffocates her and empties the safe. Olivia arrives, unexpectedly, as Danny is getting ready to pour kerosene all over the house. She admits to Danny that she was attracted to him in the past, but no longer‚Äî she has discovered her aunt, dead. He talks about his poor childhood and being looked down upon for being a servant, and threatens to kill her, too, so that no one can incriminate him in Mrs. Bramson's murder. Olivia says she will understand if he kills her, but she wants him to know that she is no longer drawn to him, because she sees who he really is. Just then the police arrive, called by Justin when he could not reach Olivia by phone, and they arrest Danny. As he leaves, Danny says, \\"I'll hang in the end, but they'll get their money's worth at the trial.\\" At last, Justin and Olivia embrace.

Whitty and Boulton also appeared in the Broadway production. In an article on TCM.com, Margarita Landazuri reports that Montgomery saw the play in New York and ‚Äúbadgered‚Äù Louis B. Mayer into giving him the role. Apparently the studio was willing to risk a flop In order to get control over Montgomery and his desire for meatier roles. He recalled: ‚Äú... they okayed my playing in it because they thought the fan reaction to me, in such a role, would humiliate me.\\" The actor also agreed to pay part of the cost of the film. Reception The film was a critical but not a financial success. The New York Daily News said Robert Montgomery's performance \\"lifts the MGM actor out of the lower brackets, where he has slipped because of shoddy material, into an eminent position among the top-notchers of Hollywood players.\\" The newspaper Variety proclaimed that \\"the appearance of Montgomery in a part which is the antithesis of his pattern may be art, but it's not box office.\\" Louis B. Mayer personally supervised the making of a trailer which preceded the film, warning filmgoers of its \\"experimental nature.\\"\\"Night Must Fall\\". Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved February 12, 2014. Writing for Night and Day in 1937, Graham Greene gave the film a poor review, describing it as a \\"pretentious little murder play [] made [into] a long dim film\\".

He also served as a Senator of the Republic and as Governor of the State of Tabasco. Life and work Francisco Javier Santamar√≠a was born in 1886 in the rancher√≠a of Cacaos, to a criollo family of modest means. He began his schooling in Macuspana and completed his studies in Villahermosa (then called San Juan Bautista) at the Instituto Ju√°rez, where he graduated with a teaching degree. He subsequently moved to Mexico City to study law, obtaining his license in 1912. Beginning at a young age Santamar√≠a demonstrated a talent for composition and an appreciation for the belles- lettres which would eventually evolve into a prolific career as a writer, lexicographer and linguist; his two most often cited works are the Diccionario General de Americanismos and the Diccionario de Mejicanismos, the second of which is a continuation and completion of Joaqu√≠n Garc√≠a Icazbalceta's original project. At the start of his political career Santamar√≠a was an outspoken critic of Plutarco El√≠as Calles and the Partido Labortista over which he presided. He was also a close friend and political associate of General Francisco R. Serrano (an inveterate enemy of Calles's), and supported the latter's presidential campaign for the 1925-1928 term, an enterprise which would ultimately end in the murderous defeat of Serrano and his closest associates. Santamar√≠a would be the only one on El√≠as Calles's hit list to not fall the night of October 2, 1927, an event known as the \\"Huitzilac Massacre,\\" which resulted in the summary executions of Serrano and twenty six other generals, and which President √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n ordered out of fear of military rebellion. His escape and survival would, however, result in years of exile and poverty in the U.S., an account of which he gives in Cr√≥nicas del destierro: Desde la ciudad de hierro (Chronicles of Exile: From the Iron City). After returning to Mexico Santamar√≠a re-entered politics by joining the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI); eventually going on to serve as a Senator of the Republic for Tabasco from 1940 to 1946. Immediately after the conclusion of his term he was selected by the party as its candidate for the governorship of Tabasco, competed against three opponents and won handily, reportedly receiving 95% of the votes. As governor he worked to improve his state's educational system and general level of cultural and technological development, while continuing to write books and essays on a variety of subjects. Francisco Javier Santamar√≠a was a numerary member of the Academia Mexicana de la Lengua and held seat 23.

In this context, a distinction is made between the distal stimulus (the external, perceived object) and the proximal stimulus (the stimulation of sensory organs). *In experimental psychology, a stimulus is the event or object to which a response is measured. Thus, not everything that is presented to participants qualifies as stimulus. For example, a cross mark at the center of a screen is not said to be a stimulus, because it merely serves to center participants' gaze on the screen. Also, it is uncommon to refer to longer events (e.g. the Trier social stress test) as a stimulus, even if a response to such an event is measured. History The study of the Stimulus in psychology began with experiments in the eighteenth century. In the second half of the 19th century, the term Stimulus was coined in psychophysics by defining the field as the \\"scientific study of the relation between stimulus and sensation\\". This may have led James J. Gibson to conclude that \\"whatever could be controlled by an experimenter and applied to an observer could be thought of as a stimulus\\" in early psychological studies with humans, while around the same time, the term stimulus described anything eliciting a reflex in animal research. Behavioral Psychology The concept Stimulus was essential to behaviorism and behavioral theories of B. F. Skinner and Ivan Pavlov in particular. Within such a framework several kinds of stimuli have been distinguished (see also classical conditioning): Pavlov's Dog Experiment In the theory of Classical Conditioning, Unconditioned stimulus (US) is a stimulus that unconditionally triggers an Unconditioned response (UR), while Conditioned stimulus (CS) is an originally irrelevant stimulus that triggers a Conditioned response (CR). Ivan Pavlov‚Äôs Dog experiment is a well-known experiment that fully interprets these terms. The unconditioned stimulus is the dog‚Äôs food that would naturally cause salivation, which is an unconditioned response. Pavlov then trained the dog by ringing the bell every time before food. The conditioned stimulus is the ringing bell after training, which causes salivation as a conditioned response. Moreover, an eliciting stimulus was defined as a stimulus that precedes a certain behavior and thus causes a response. A discriminative stimulus in contrast increases the probability of a response to occur but does not necessarily elicit the response. A reinforcing stimulus usually denoted a stimulus delivered after the response has already occurred; in psychological experiments, it was often delivered on purpose to reinforce the behavior. Emotional stimuli were regarded as not eliciting a response. Instead, they were thought to modify the strength or vigor with which a behavior is carried out.

After she had been laid down in December 1782, the Admiralty reduced her armament to 36 guns on 11 January 1783, as captains of earlier 38-gun frigates had complained that the extra guns made the upper gundeck too cramped. Melampus was launched on 8 June 1785, and fitted between 3 July and 8 September 1785 for ordinary at Plymouth. She was again fitted between May and 2 July 1790 for Channel service. She had cost ¬£20,785 13s 0d to build, with a further ¬£2,985 being spent in 1790 for fitting out. Early service Her first captain following her May 1790 commissioning was Charles M. Pole. Melampus was paid off again in November 1790, but by 1793 she had been moved to Plymouth, where she was refitted between March and June for ¬£4,726. French Revolutionary Wars She recommissioned in April 1793 under the command of Isaac Coffin, and by April the following year she was under Captain Thomas Wells, serving in Sir John Borlase Warren's squadron. During this time Melampus participated in the Action of 23 April 1794, during which the British took three vessels, , , and . Melampus had five men killed and five wounded. She came under the command of Sir Richard Strachan in September 1794 and was recommissioned in April 1795. She was part of Strachan's force that attacked and destroyed a French convoy in Cartaret Bay on 9 May 1795. The British squadron spotted a convoy of 13 vessels and immediately gave chase. Twelve of the quarry escaped and got close to the shore where a small shore battery, their own armed escorts, and a brig and a lugger offered some protection. Strachan sent in the boats from the vessels in his squadron while Melampus and the ships provided covering fire. The French crews abandoned their vessels at the approach of the British and eventually the shore battery also stopped firing. The cutting out party retrieved all the vessels, save a small sloop, which was hard ashore and which they burnt. Melampus had eight men wounded and in all the British lost one man killed and 14 wounded. They captured a gun brig and a gun lugger, each armed with three 18-pounder guns. They also captured the convoy, which consisted of: Prosperitte (80 tons and carrying cordage), Montagne (200 tons and carrying timber, lead and tin plates), Catharine (200 tons and carrying ship timber), Hyrondelle (220 tons and carrying ship timber and pitch), Contente (250 tons, carrying powder), Nymphe (120 tons carrying fire wood), Bonne-Union (150 tons), Fantazie (45 tons carrying coals), Alexandre (397 and carrying ship timber, cordage, hemp and cannon), and Petit Neptune (113 tons and carrying ship timber). A later prize money report added the names of the escorts, the gun-brig Crachefeu and the gun-lugger Eclair, both of which the Royal Navy took into service under their existing names. On 3 July 1795 Melampus and intercepted a convoy of 13 vessels off St Malo. Melampus captured an armed brig and Hebe captured six merchant vessels: Maria Louisa, Abeille. Bon Foi, Patrouille, Eleonore, and Pecheur. The brig of war was armed with four 24-pounders and had a crew of 60 men. Later she was identified as the 4-gun V√©suve. The convoy had been on its way from √éle-de-Br√©hat to Brest. , and the cutter shared in the prize and head money. The Royal Navy took V√©suve into service as . Melampus came under the command of Captain Graham Moore in August 1796. On 13 November she and Minerva drove a French navy corvette ashore near Barfleur. However the British were not able to get close enough to assure her destruction. Then Melampus and captured another corvette, the Etna. Etna was armed with eighteen 12-pounder guns and had a crew of 137 men under the command of Citizen Joseph La Coudrais. The prisoners stated that both corvettes were carrying military and naval stores and that the corvette that had run ashore was the Etonnant, of eighteen 18-pounder guns. Both were new ships on their first cruise. The Royal Navy took Etna into service as the 20-gun post ship HMS Cormorant. Melampus was also active in operations against French privateers. On 5 October 1797 she captured the French privateer lugger Rayon off the Casquets after a chase of four hours. Rayon was armed with six carriage guns and eight coehorns, and had a crew of 54 men under the command of Jean Baptiste Leonard Gosselin. She had sailed from Cherburg ten hours earlier intending to cruise between the Lizard and Cape Clear for six weeks. Melampus was in company with when they captured the Belliqueux, off the Irish coast on 16 January 1798. She was originally a corvette, but was now a privateer. Belliqueux was pierced for 20 cannon but was armed with fourteen 8-pounder guns and four carronades, and had a crew of 120 men. She was out of St. Malo, and on 11 January had captured His Majesty's packet Prince Ernest, which had been sailing from Tortola. The captain of the packet and all but four of her crew were on board Belliqueux. A few days later, on 23 January, Melampus captured the Volage, after a short, intense engagement. She was a corvette that the French navy had lent to merchants. She was armed with twenty 9-pounder guns and two 18-pounders, and had a crew of 195 men under the command of Citizen Delageneaux, a capitaine de fr√©gate. In the engagement Melampus had two men mortally wounded and three men dangerously wounded; Volage had four men killed and eight wounded. Volage was three weeks out of Nantes, provisioned for a three-month cruise. By the time of her capture, Volage had herself only captured an American ship and destroyed an English brig sailing from Belfast to Lisbon with coal. The Captain and all the officers on Volage were officers in the French navy, but on a three-month leave. Melampus was present at the Battle of Tory Island in October that year, fighting in the main action and then subsequently capturing the in a night action two days later. Together with she captured the 32-gun frigate which the Royal Navy took into service as HMS Proserpine. On 26 February 1799 Melampus captured the French privateer Mercure, which the Admiralty took into service as . Mercure was armed with 16 guns and had a crew of 103 men. She was from Saint Malo and was returning to her home port after having had a successful cruise in the Channel. She was under the command of Captain Jacques Dupuy- Fromy. On 14 April Melampus pursued another French privateer for 25 hours before she was able to capture her quarry. The privateer was the brig Papillon, which was armed with ten 9-pounder guns and four 36-pounder obusiers and had a crew of 123 men. On 18 April Melampus was in pursuit of a privateer when the privateer capsized and sank before Melampus could reach her. The captain of Papillon stated that the privateer was the Nantois, of fourteen 6 and 12-pounder guns, and a crew of 150 men. Furthermore, she had on board the master and part of the crew of the brig Echo, which she had captured earlier. Melampus was then assigned to the Caribbean, sailing for Jamaica in March 1800. On 2 June, Melampus, in company with , captured the French letter of marque Volant, of 140 tons, armed with eight guns, and having a crew of 49 men. She was sailing from Vera Cruz to the Havannah. Melampus also captured Hannibal on 23 July. On 1 October Melampus, Juno, and Retribution were in company when they captured the Aquila. Thereafter she came under the command of Captain Thomas Gosselin in November 1801 before being paid off in June 1802. Lastly, Melampus captured Amistad (29 December) and Falcon Corunnes (30 December). Napoleonic Wars Melampus returned to England, and underwent a large repair at Deptford between August 1803 and October 1804. She was recommissioned in August 1804 under the command of Captain Stephen Poyntz, and commenced cruises off the French coast. Between 12 and 14 February 1805, Melampus was in company with cutter , and the hired armed cutters Frisk and Rhoda. At this time a group of 27 French gunvessels were sailing from Bordeaux to Brest. Melampus succeeded in capturing two gunbrigs carrying two 24-pounder guns and one 18-pounder gun each, with a complement of 50 men each, primarily soldiers. Melampus also captured four luggers, each armed with one 18-pounder gun, and with complements of 25 men,mostly soldiers. The gunvessels Melampus captured were N¬∞s 169, 174, 277, 286, 287, and 311. Frisk succeeded in capturing Gunvessel n¬∞ 288, armed with one 24-pounder gun, and with a complement of 25 men (20 being troops from the 44th Regiment), all under the command of enseigne de vaisseaux P. Roox. Rhoda succeeded in capturing the lugger Gunvessel n ¬∞313, armed with one 24-pounder gun, and with a complement of 22 men (18 of them soldiers), under the command of enseigne auxiliaire Frederick Widsmann. The gunvessel had had one man killed. On 25 June Loire had been chasing a French frigate privateer for some twelve hours when Melampus and came up and cut-off the quarry, forcing her to surrender. She was the Valiant (or , of Bordeaux. She was armed with twenty-four 18-pounder guns on her main deck and six 6-pounders, which she threw overboard while Loire was pursuing her. She had a crew of 240 men. She had been out for 20 days on a four-month cruise but had only captured the Halifax packet Lord Charles Spencer. On 13 July 1805 she captured the Spanish privateer Hydra at sea. Hydra was pierced for 30 cannons and carried twenty-two 9-pounder guns on her main deck, and six 6-pounders on her quarterdeck. She had a crew of 192 men, and she lost three men killed and several men wounded before she struck. Melampus captured her on the 17th day of a four-month cruise and she had not yet captured any British vessels. One week later Melampus recaptured Barzilla, which the French privateer had captured about a week earlier. Melampus shared the salvage money with . Melampus was present, whilst serving as part of a squadron under her old commander Sir Richard Strachan, at the destruction of the 74-gun on 14 September 1806. In September 1807 Captain Edward Hawker took over command, sailing her to North America in 1808. He then took her to the Leeward Islands in 1809. On 16 January 1809 Melampus captured the French navy brig Colibri off Barbuda, after her captain had the \\"temerity\\" to put up a fight as Melampus was sailing alongside. She was armed with fourteen 24-pounder carronades and two 8-pounder guns, had a crew of 92 men, under the command of Mons. Deslandes, Lieutenant de vaisseau. In the engagement, Colibri had three men killed and 11 wounded before she struck. She was a new vessel and was sailing from Cherburg with a cargo of 570 barrels of flour and a great quantity of gunpowder intended for the relief of to San Domingo. On her way she had captured and sunk two British brigs that had been sailing from Newfoundland to Lisbon, the Hannibal and the Priscilla, both of Dartmouth. The Royal Navy took her into service as . On 14 December Melampus captured the French brig corvette Bearnais after pursuing her for 28 hours. Bearnais was armed with sixteen 24-pounder carronades and had a crew of 109 men (including 30 soldiers), under the command of Monsieur Montbazen, Lieutenant de vaisseau. She fought before striking with the result that she had one man killed and some men wounded, and she wounded two men on Melampus. Bearnais was a new vessel and was sailing from Bayonne to Guadeloupe with a cargo of flour and military stores, some of which she had thrown overboard during the pursuit. The Royal Navy took her into service as . Between January and February 1810, Melampus was involved in the capture of Guadeloupe. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Guadaloupe\\" to all surviving claimants from the campaign. Melampus was in company with the sloop when they captured a French corvette brig letter of marque on 28 May. The vessel was the Fant√¥me, of 300 tons burthen (bm), pierced for 20 heavy carronades, and with a crew of 74 men. She had made three captures before being captured herself. The Royal Navy took her into service under her existing name. Transfer Melampus returned to Britain, and by December 1812 was under repair at Isaac Blackburn's yards, at Turnchapel. Work was completed by March 1814, and she was again fitted for sea, between April 1814 and May 1815 at Plymouth Dockyard. She was then sold to the Dutch government in June 1815 for the sum of ¬£35,364. HNLMS Melampus The Bombardment of Algiers, 27 August 1816, painting by George Chambers Sr. On 27 August 1816 Melampus was the flagship of the Dutch squadron under Vice-Admiral Baron T.F. van de Capellen that joined a British fleet under the command of Admiral Lord Exmouth in the bombardment of Algiers. Her captain was Antony-Willem De-Man.James (1837), Vol 6, p.398. In the action Melampus lost three men killed and 15 wounded. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Algiers\\" to the 1328 surviving British claimants from the action. The bombardment was an attempt by Britain to end the slavery practices of the Dey of Algiers. The Anglo-Dutch fleet bombarded ships and the harbour defences of Algiers. By 1822 Melampus was in the Dutch East Indies. In that year she led a squadron of five transports and 24 local vessels carrying Dutch marines and local auxiliaries in a punitive expedition against the Iranun of Sulawesi.

It is the ancient parish church of Hangleton‚Äîan isolated downland village which was abandoned by the Middle Ages and consisted of open farmland until the Interwar period, when extensive residential development took place. History Hangleton existed at the time of the Domesday Book of 1086, although the church was not mentioned; its first known reference is in 1093 when William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey put it under the control of Lewes Priory. The church stood between the manor house and the cottages and houses of the village to the northeast, and was a rectangular building long and , with flint walls thick. Rebuilding began in the 12th century. The nave dates from that century, while the square tower was added in the 13th century and the church was re-roofed at that time (having originally been thatched). The 12th-century chancel was rebuilt in around 1300. There is still a stretch of open downland to the south of the church, although residential development surrounds it on other sides. Before the plague in the 17th century there a small lake at the top of the green (St. Helen's Green) but it was used as a 'plague pit' ‚Äì meaning a mass grave ‚Äì used to dispose of the victims of The Black Death. Hangleton village began to decline in the 14th century. The whole parish, which covered a much wider area than the village itself, had a population of 80 by around 1850. In 1864 it was formally united with the parish of Portslade, having already been administered by Portslade's vicar for the previous 100 years. The condition of the church building worsened, but it never became an unusable ruin and never experienced a period without services‚Äîalthough for a time these were as infrequent as once a year. The churchyard was still used for burials as well. Unlike many other mediaeval churches in the Brighton and Hove area, which were heavily restored and altered in the 19th century, St Helen's was largely overlooked because of its isolation in a bleak, distant spot high on the South Downs above Hove. In 1870, George Cokayne, later a Clarenceux King of Arms, funded a minor restoration of the church. This may have saved the building from ruin, but also preserved its ancient character. Scenes for the 1909 film The Boy and the Convict, directed by Dave Aylott for Williamson Kinematograph Company, were filmed in the churchyard, which includes the grave of Samuel Augustus Barnett (1844-1913). The parish was incorporated into the then Borough of Hove in 1927. The Borough started to use the expanse of open land for housing development soon afterwards. This spread northwestwards from Hove in the mid-1930s and continued until the 1950s, by which time the whole area around the church had been built up. Another partial restoration took place in 1929, followed by a more thorough rebuilding in 1949. This added a porch and a vestry, a new roof (at a cost of ¬£2,500) and some battlements and a pyramidal roof on the tower. Work continued until 1951, at which time the parish was split from Portslade. The new Parish of Hangleton's first priest took over in 1955. Following the 1949 alterations, St Helen's was reopened for regular use, and was granted Grade II* listed status on 24 March 1950. Architecture The triple-headed lancet window in the east face The church is built of flint‚Äîa stone used for many churches in the Downs in Sussex. The doors, windows and quoins are faced with Caen stone, which was used frequently in Norman buildings. The flints in the south wall are laid in a herringbone (opus spicatum) pattern, a style favoured during the Saxon period; the church has been identified by some sources as one of the best surviving examples of herringboning from that era. The roof is now tiled in clay. The basic structural layout‚Äîchancel, nave of three bays and west tower‚Äîhas not changed since the 13th century, although the original chancel arch was removed in the 14th century and the porch and vestry on the northern side are 20th-century additions. There are lancet windows of various sizes in all four faces of the church. The west front has two, there is a large three-pointed window in the east face, and several tiny windows are placed at irregular intervals in the south and north walls. In particular, there is a low window into the chancel whose function has been much speculated on. One theory is that it was used by mediaeval lepers who would stand outside and listen to services through the window rather than enter the church itself. It may also have served as a type of confessional, allowing a priest to sit inside the church and the penitent to stay outside. During the restorations of 1949, ancient wall paintings were discovered on the north wall of the church, along with some scrollwork on one of the windows. The scrollwork was found to date from the early 13th century, while the wall paintings were 14th- and 15th-century in origin. Some restoration of this work was carried out in 1969, at which time some blocked- up windows in the nave were rediscovered. In one corner of the chancel, there is a memorial monument which has been identified as representing the Bellingham family, who lived in the area in the 16th and 17th century. Richard and Mary Bellingham, nine children and five coffins representing children who died soon after birth are depicted. Elsewhere, an early-20th-century stone piet√† commemorates a local brewer and pottery collector, and a carved wooden screen and reredos in the chancel was also donated as a memorial. The pulpit, however, was taken from St Leonard's Church, Aldrington. Burials Clergyman and social reformer Samuel Augustus Barnett, founder of Toynbee Hall in London, and his wife Henrietta, who conceived and helped to create Hampstead Garden Suburb, are buried in the churchyard to the north of the church. Edward Vaughan Hyde Kenealy QC, who lived in Portslade from the 1850s until 1874,Melville‚Äôs Directory and Gazetteer of Sussex (1858) was a barrister who unsuccessfully defended Sir Roger Tichborne in the Tichborne Case, a famous 19th-century trial: it was the longest in British legal history at the time, partly because of Kenealy's erratic, inappropriate behaviour. He was disbarred soon afterwards, but became Member of Parliament for Stoke-on-Trent until shortly before his death in 1880.Hamilton, J. A., rev. R. McWilliam (2004) \\"Kenealy, Edward Vaughan Hyde (1819‚Äì1880)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, accessed 21 July 2008 He is buried in a grave by the south door of the church, marked by an ostentatious black marble tombstone with gold mosaic work. Henry Willett (1823‚Äì1905), a wealthy Brighton brewer, and noted collector of ceramics, paintings and fossils was buried here. He was one of the founders of Brighton Museum. Inside the church there are tombstones (inlaid into the floor of the aisles). The church today St Helen's Church was listed at Grade II* on 24 March 1950. As of February 2001, it was one of 70 Grade II*-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove.

Michael Jackson (August 29, 1958 ‚Äì June 25, 2009) was an American entertainer who spent over four decades in the public eye, first as a child star with the Jackson 5 and later as a solo artist. From the mid-1980s, Jackson's appearance began to change. The changes to his face, particularly his nose, triggered widespread speculation of extensive cosmetic surgery, and his skin tone became much lighter.Taraborrelli, pp. 434‚Äì436 He was diagnosed with the skin disorder vitiligo, which results in white patches on the skin and sensitivity to sunlight. To treat the condition, he used fair- colored makeup and likely skin whitening prescription creams to cover up the uneven blotches of color caused by the illness. The creams would have further lightened his skin. The lighter skin resulted in criticism that he was trying to appear white. Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and that he was not trying to be anything he was not. Jackson and some of his siblings said they had been physically and psychologically abused by their father Joe Jackson. In 2003, Joe admitted to whipping them as children, but he emphatically rejected the longstanding abuse allegations. The whippings deeply traumatized Jackson and may have led to the onset of further health problems later in his life. Physicians speculated that he had body dysmorphic disorder.Posner, Gerald.

At some point during the 1990s, it appeared that Jackson had become dependent on prescription drugs, mainly painkillers and strong sedatives. The drug use was later linked to second- and third-degree burns he had suffered years before. Jackson gradually became dependent on these drugs, and his health deteriorated. He went into rehabilitation in 1993.Campbell (1995), pp. 89‚Äì93 While preparing for a series of comeback concerts scheduled to begin in July 2009, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication after suffering cardiac arrest on June 25, 2009. His personal physician was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in his death and sentenced to four years in prison. Skin color alt= Jackson's skin had been medium-brown during his youth, but from the mid-1980s gradually grew paler. The change drew widespread media coverage, including speculation that he had been bleaching his skin. Jackson's dermatologist, Arnold Klein, said he observed in 1983 that Jackson had vitiligo, a condition characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment. He also identified discoid lupus erythematosus in Jackson. He diagnosed Jackson with lupus that year, and with vitiligo in 1986. Vitiligo's drastic effects on the body can cause psychological distress. Jackson used fair-colored makeup, and possibly skin-bleaching prescription creams, to cover up the uneven blotches of color caused by the illness. The creams would have further lightened his skin, and, with the application of makeup, he could appear very pale. The cause of vitiligo is unknown, but it is believed to be due to genetic susceptibility triggered by an environmental factor such that an autoimmune disease occurs. Taraborrelli said the lupus was in remission. Jackson's physical changes gained widespread media coverage and provoked criticism from the public. Some African-American psychologists argued Jackson was \\"a lousy role model for black youth\\". Dr. Dennis Chestnut said Jackson had given \\"black youth a feeling that they can achieve\\", but might encourage them to believe they had to be esoteric and idiosyncratic to be successful. Dr. Halford Fairchild said Jackson and other African-American celebrities would try \\"to look more like white people in order to get in films and on television\\". Jackson has also been confronted with the reaction of the people around him. Filmmaker John Landis, who directed two music videos for Jackson, said when Jackson showed him his bleached chest, he told Jackson the doctor who had done it was a criminal. 329x329px However, in 1993, Jackson told Oprah Winfrey \\"there, as I know of, there is no such thing as skin bleaching. I've never seen it, I don't know what it is.\\" He said he had a hereditary skin disorder (vitiligo), and would use make-up to even out the uneven skin tone. \\"It is something I cannot help,\\" said Jackson. \\"When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me. It's a problem for me. I can't control it. But what about all the millions of people who sit in the sun to become darker, to become other than what they are. Nobody says nothing about that.\\" Winfrey's interview of Jackson was watched by 62 million Americans. It also started a public discourse on the topic of vitiligo, then a relatively unknown condition.Campbell (1995), pp. 14‚Äì16Lewis pp. 165‚Äì168George, pp. 45‚Äì46'I'm a black man turning white on television'\\", BrisbaneTimes, December 18, 2007 Jackson publicly said that he was proud to be black. He also wrote a letter to photographer William Pecchi Jr. in 1988 which reads: \\"Maybe I look at the world through rose colored glasses but I love people all over the world. That is why stories of racism really disturb me. [...] Because in truth I believe ALL men are created equal, I was taught that and will always believe it. I just can't conceive of how a person could hate another because of skin color. I love every race on the planet earth. Prejudice is the child of ignorance. Naked we come into the world and naked we shall go out. And a very good thing too, for it reminds me that I am naked under my shirt, whatever its color.\\" Shortly following Jackson's death, tubes of Benoquin and hydroquinone were found in Jackson's home. Both creams are skin bleaching agents and may be recommended for adults who have vitiligo on more than 50% of their bodies, to bleach the remaining pigment and make it the same colour as the depigmented skin. Darkening depigmented skin is extremely difficult.Rebecca Howard, Gadsden Times, Michael Jackson's skin condition destroys pigment (February 15, 1993). Depigmentation causes a permanent and extreme sensitivity to the sun. Vitiligo patients are at risk of contracting melanoma, and an annual cancer check-up is recommended. Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. In the music video for \\"Remember the Time\\", all dancers and actors except for Jackson are lightly dressed following the example set by ancient Egyptians.Bush, Michael. The King Of Style. Insight Editions, 2012, p. 146. Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid attention to the disorder.Bush, Michael. The King Of Style. Insight Editions, 2012, p. 40. Jackson's autopsy confirmed that he had vitiligo. His skin was found to have reduced (though not absent) melanocytes, the cells active in skin pigmentation. Vitiligo occurs in three different patterns. Segmental depigmentation means only one side of the body is affected, whereas generalized depigmentation means many parts of the body are affected. Jackson's autopsy report states a \\"focal depigmentation of the skin\\" (i.e., the depigmentation occurs on one or a few areas of the body). In Jackson's case, there were five affected areas. When Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo in the mid-1980s, he started to learn more about the disease. He would often call his dermatologist's nurse and future wife Debbie Rowe to get medical information as well as emotional support.Taraborrelli, p. 570 Jackson's autopsy did not confirm or refute the claim that he had lupus. Cosmetic procedures Jackson at the alt= Over time, Jackson's facial structure changed as well. Surgeons speculated he also had a forehead lift, cheekbone surgery and altered his lips. Those close to the singer estimated that, by 1990, he had undergone around ten procedures. In the biography's original edition published in 1991, Taraborrelli said Jackson had had a total of six nose surgeries including two secondary operations (not considered complete rhinoplasties).Taraborrelli 1992, pp. 533‚Äì534.Taraborrelli 1992, pp. 419‚Äì420. According to Taraborrelli, Jackson had his first rhinoplasty after breaking his nose during a rehearsal session while dancing. However, the surgery was not a complete success, and he complained of breathing difficulties that would affect his career. He was referred to Steven Hoefflin, who performed his second rhinoplasty in 1981.Taraborrelli, pp. 205‚Äì210 Taraborrelli said Jackson had a third rhinoplasty three years later and a fourth in 1986. Jackson wrote in his 1988 autobiography Moonwalk that, in addition to the two rhinoplasties, he also had a dimple created in his chin.Jackson, pp. 229‚Äì230 From 1986 onward he was a regular client of Arnold Klein, a dermatologist who specialized in dermal filler injection, a non-surgical cosmetic procedure. In his book, Jackson attributed the changes in the structure of his face to puberty, a strict vegetarian diet, weight loss, a change in hair style and stage lighting. Jackson denied allegations that he had altered his eyes.Jackson, p. 256 In June 1992, the Daily Mirror ran a full front-page picture, allegedly of Jackson's face, which they described as \\"hideously disfigured\\" by plastic surgery. Jackson sued and, in 1998, the Daily Mirror agreed to an out-of-court settlement. At the High Court, the former Daily Mirror editor acknowledged that after meeting Jackson in person, he believed that Jackson was neither hideously disfigured nor scarred. A Daily Mirror solicitor maintained that the paper had not tampered with the picture. Media reports stated that Jackson's autopsy reported one scar beside each of his nostrils, one scar behind each of his ears, and two scars on his neck, \\"probably\\" from cosmetic surgery, plus cosmetic tattoos on his eyebrows, around his eyes and lips, and on his scalp (at his receding hairline). In the unedited version of the documentary Living With Michael Jackson, which was shown in court in 2005, Jackson said he had two procedures on his nose so that he could breathe better. When he was asked about his cheeks, Jackson answered: \\"These cheekbones? No. My father has the same thing. We have Indian blood.\\"Aphrodite Jones, Michael Jackson Conspiracy, 2007, p. 266 Health concerns=General= Over the years, Jackson had various medical problems that were covered by the media. In early 1984, Jackson was treated for scalp burns after his hair caught fire during a commercial shoot. In June 1990, Jackson was admitted to a Santa Monica hospital with chest pains. According to Dr. Mark Zatzkis, \\"laboratory and X-ray tests of Jackson's heart and lungs revealed no abnormalities\\"; the pains \\"were caused by bruised ribs suffered during a vigorous dance practice\\". Various concerts were canceled owing to illness, and a remaining tour was called off due to addiction. On March 12, 1988, Jackson canceled a show in St. Louis which was rescheduled for March 14; on March 13, Jackson performed in St. Louis although he was fighting a cold. The cold progressed to laryngitis; the show on March 14, was also canceled. Three shows in Tacoma, scheduled from October 31 to November 2, 1988, had to be canceled on his physician's advice because Jackson had the flu. Two shows in Los Angeles were canceled due to swollen vocal cords; three shows in Los Angeles scheduled for November 20, 21 and 22 were also canceled; these five concerts were rescheduled for January 1989. In August 1992, a concert in London, England had to be postponed due to a viral infection. Four days later, Jackson performed in Cardiff, Wales. In September 1992, a concert in Gelsenkirchen, Germany was canceled because Jackson was taken ill with the flu. In Lausanne, Switzerland, an ambulance took Jackson back to his hotel after the show held on September 8; another show in Basel, Switzerland, scheduled for September 11, was also canceled. In October 1992, two concerts in Turkey, Istanbul and Izmir, and another one in Athens, Greece had to be canceled due to loss of voice caused by a cold. His private doctor attended to Jackson in Istanbul. According to organizers, Jackson's \\"vocal cords were irritated.\\" These concerts were supposed to be the last three shows of the tour's European leg. Jackson was seen by a throat specialist in London and was advised to seek further treatment in Los Angeles. In August 1993, two shows of Jackson's Dangerous Tour in Thailand had to be canceled due to dehydration. On August 27, 1993, Jackson \\"returned to the concert stage\\". On August 30, 1993, a show in Singapore had to be canceled due to nausea and a severe headache. In the opinion of his physician, Dr. David Forecast, Jackson \\"was in no condition to perform.\\" A neurology specialist attended to Jackson. The specialist confirmed Forecast's diagnosis of \\"late- onset migraine,\\" and medication was prescribed for Jackson who also underwent tests in a hospital in Singapore.William Branigin, Ian Katz, The Washington Post, Jackson 'Sorry' for Canceling; Accuser's Family to Fight Extortion Allegations, September 1, 1993 The show was held two days later. Jackson consumed a lot of water,name=\\"Bush\\", p.115. preventing dehydration and voice problems. The first concert in Santiago de Chile, scheduled for October 21, 1993, was canceled due to lumbar problems; two days later, Jackson performed at Estadio Nacional. Another concert in Lima, Peru, scheduled for October 26, 1993, was canceled due to a torn muscle suffered during a show in Brazil. Several concerts in Mexico City were canceled due to tooth problems. Two abscessed molars were pulled. However, there were five shows in Mexico City. The last concert of the Dangerous Tour was held in Mexico City on November 11, 1993. In November 1993, Jackson announced the cancellation of the remaining Dangerous Tour due to an addiction to painkillers which had been prescribed after a recent constructive scalp surgery. It was also reported Jackson canceled shows in Russia and Israel; however, these two concerts did take place. The rescheduling of the concert in Israel was not due to health problems. In late 1995, Jackson was rushed to a hospital after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance. Medics cited irregular beats, gastro-intestinal inflammation, dehydration, and kidney and liver irregularities. According to Dr. Neil Ratner, Jackson suffered a back injury in July 1997 after one of the stages collapsed during a concert in Munich, Germany. However, the History Tour continued; there was only one concert canceled after the fatal accident of Princess Diana about two months later. In fact, such an incident happened during a charity concert in Munich in 1999. Jackson was later taken to a hospital. Jackson's promoter Marcel Avram said he [Jackson] received abrasions and bruises. Jackson left the hospital the next morning. On February 15, 2005, Jackson was admitted to the Marian Medical Center in Santa Maria with \\"flu-like symptoms.\\" According to Dr. Chuck Merrill, Jackson was in stable condition and would recover within a few days. Jackson left the hospital on February 16, 2005; Dr. Todd Bailey said Jackson \\"continued to need care for some persistent viral symptoms, but otherwise he was in good spirits.\\" One week later, the jury selection for the child molestation trial resumed in Jackson's presence. On March 10, 2005, Jackson appeared late in court after having received treatment in a hospitalAphrodite Jones, Michael Jackson Conspiracy, p. 80 due to a back problem. During the trial, Jackson occasionally needed help to get to his seat. On June 5, 2005, Jackson was taken to the emergency room at the Santa Ynez Valley Cottage Hospital to seek treatment of a back pain. Jackson's spokeswoman, Raymone Bain, said \\"stress contributed to the back problem.\\" During the trial, Jackson had briefly been in hospital several times. The BBC reported that during his 2005 trial, the singer again suffered from stress-related illnesses and severe weight loss. Dr. Christopher Rogers testified in the trial against Dr. Conrad Murray that, in his opinion, Jackson \\"was healthier than the average person of his age.\\" Rogers said the arteries around Jackson's heart were free of fat and cholesterol, which is unusual for a 50-year-old individual. At some point after his skin began getting pale, Jackson began to wear a cloth face mask in public while traveling, out of fear of getting sick and being unable to perform, as well as a general fear of germs.https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/international/michael-jackson- predicted-coronavirus-like-pandemic-ex-bodyguard In his later years he would have his kids' face covered in public as well for the same reasons, as well as to hide their identity. Jackson would be chided during his lifetime for the practice, but would receive some vindication over a decade after his death when the practice became much more common and in some cases legally mandatory due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson thankful to wearing a mask so she could have a somewhat normal childhood.https://www.smoothradio.com/artists/michael-jackson/daughter-paris- thankful-dad-made-children-wear-masks/ =Childhood and mental health= Jackson as a teenager in 1974. In the 2003 documentary 266x266px Another publicly discussed aspect of Jackson's private life is his childhood, particularly his relationship with his father, Joseph. Although Jackson credited his father's strict discipline with playing a large role in his success,Taraborrelli, 2009, pp. 20‚Äì22. he and some of his siblings said they were physically and mentally abused by Joseph from a young age through incessant rehearsals, whippings, and the use of derogatory names such as \\"big nose\\" for Michael; this abuse affected Michael throughout his life. In one altercation‚Äîlater recalled by Marlon Jackson‚ÄîJoseph held Michael upside down by one leg and \\"pummeled him over and over again with his hand, hitting him on his back and buttocks.\\" Joseph would often trip the boys or push them into walls. One night while Jackson was asleep, Joseph climbed into his room through the bedroom window. Wearing a fright mask, he entered the room screaming and shouting. Joseph said he wanted to teach his children not to leave the window open when they went to sleep. For a number of years afterward, Jackson suffered nightmares about being kidnapped from his bedroom.Taraborrelli, pp. 20‚Äì22 By the early 1980s, Jackson was deeply unhappy; he said, \\"Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room sometimes and cry. It's so hard to make friends... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find someone to talk to. But I just end up coming home.\\"Taraborrelli, p. 206 Although it had been reported for a number of years that Jackson had an abusive childhood, he first spoke openly about it in his 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey. He grimaced when speaking of the childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, acknowledging that he often cried from loneliness. In the same interview, speaking of his father, Jackson said, \\"There were times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick... I'd start to regurgitate. I'm sorry... Please don't be mad at me... But I do love him.\\"Taraborrelli, p. 620 In an interview with Martin Bashir for the 2003 documentary Living with Michael Jackson, Jackson covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse, recalling that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, and that \\"if you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you.\\"Lewis Jones, 2005, pp. 165‚Äì168. Also that year, Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Jackson as a boy, but he and Jackson's mother, Katherine, have disputed the longstanding allegations of abuse, with Katherine stating that while whipping is considered abuse today, it was a common way to discipline children at the time. In 2003, Jackson was accused of child sexual abuse and was acquitted two years later. During the investigation, Jackson's profile was examined by Stan Katz, a mental health professional, who also spent several hours with the accuser. According to Taraborrelli, the assessment made by Katz was that Jackson had become a regressed ten-year-old.Taraborrelli, p. 648 Some medical professionals believe Jackson also had body dysmorphic disorder, a psychological condition whereby the sufferer has no concept of how their physical appearance is perceived by others. =Drug dependency= In none of Jackson's hospitalizations, including the one in late 1995, did medics find drugs in Jackson's system. Taraborrelli states the entertainer took Valium, Xanax and Ativan in 1993.Taraborrelli, p. 518 While Jackson himself does not mention sedatives, he said that painkillers were prescribed to soothe excruciating pain that he was suffering after recent reconstructive surgery on his scalp resulting from his accident in 1984. In a court deposition unrelated to alleged child abuse, Jackson was visibly drowsy, lacked concentration, and repeatedly slurred while speaking. He could not remember the dates of his prior album releases or names of people he had worked with. It took him several minutes to name some of his recent albums.Campbell (1995), pp. 96‚Äì97 Jackson said during the 1993 interview that he began taking painkiller medications regularly in 1984. On January 24 of that year, Jackson was filming a Pepsi commercial when his hair caught on fire from faulty pyrotechnics on stage that were intended to be part of one of many being filmed. He sustained second-degree burns to his scalp and never fully recovered from the injury or from the lingering pain. He reportedly began taking the painkillers in order to deal with the intense pain, despite having refused to do so at first. On November 9, and November 10, 1993, Jackson was questioned about a copyright matter. According to the sworn declaration from the plaintiffs' lawyer, he had been told that Jackson \\"was taking painkillers because of recent oral surgery.\\" In November 1993, Jackson announced that he was addicted to painkillers; he said he had recently undergone a scalp surgery, and the painkillers had been prescribed. Jackson said due to the pressure caused by the child molestation allegations and the energy he needed for the Dangerous Tour, he was \\"physically and emotionally exhausted.\\" He said he had \\"become increasingly more dependent on painkillers,\\" and would seek treatment. His lawyers said Jackson would be treated for addiction overseas for one and a half months to two months. In December 1993, Jackson returned to the United States. Jackson was taken to Charter Nightingale Clinic where he was searched for drugs on entry; vials of medicine were found in a suitcase. He was put on Valium IV to wean him from painkillers. The singer's spokesperson then told reporters that Jackson was \\"barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level.\\" While in the clinic, Jackson took part in group and one- on-one therapy sessions.Taraborrelli, pp. 526‚Äì528 According to Taraborrelli, in January 2004, as his trial approached, Jackson became dependent on morphine and Demerol and was being treated for this dependency by herbalist Alfredo Bowman in Colorado.Taraborrelli, p. 661 In an interview with Aphrodite Jones, Patrick Treacy, a cosmetic surgeon who treated Jackson between July 2006 and early 2007, as well as shortly before his death, said that he would have known if Jackson would have been also treated by another physician and that he never saw any drugs in the house. He also said that Jackson did not have insomnia and never asked him for narcotics. Treacy said Jackson was in good physical health; he said Jackson always insisted on the presence of an anesthetist when Propofol was administered. Jackson was and weighed , which would be within a normal weight range, although he was thin, Dr. Rogers testified in court. According to his costumer Michael Bush, Jackson lost so much weight during a concert due to loss of water that the costumes Jackson wore at the end of the show had to be smaller than those he wore at the beginning of the show; usually, he was a waist. According to Dr. Nader Kamangar, a sleeping expert at UCLA, drugs such as Demerol can cause insomnia. In the case of Jackson, insomnia could have been caused by \\"anxiety for performing\\" as well. Following Jackson's death, a police warrant issued against his attending physician, Conrad Murray, said that Jackson's many doctors had used nineteen distinct aliases, such as \\"Omar Arnold,\\" \\"Josephine Baker,\\" \\"Fernand Diaz,\\" \\"Paul Farance,\\" \\"Peter Madonie,\\" \\"Faheem Muhammad,\\" \\"Roselyn Muhammad,\\" \\"Blanca Nicholas,\\" \\"Jimmy Nicholas,\\" \\"Bryan Singleton,\\" \\"Frank Tyson,\\" and \\"Rob Kaufman\\" while prescribing medications for Jackson.

Cherilyn Lee, a nurse who provided nutritional counseling to Jackson, said that on April 12, 2009, he had asked her for unspecified \\"products for sleep\\". On April 19, 2009, he told her the only medicine that would help was propofol. Lee refused, telling him, \\"Michael, the only problem with you taking this medication ... is you're going to take it and you're not going to wake up.\\" Jackson dismissed the warning, telling her he had been given the drug before by IV injection and that his doctor told him it was safe. He did not name the doctor. An overdose of propofol can cause the patient to stop breathing, leading to a shortage of oxygen and a buildup of carbon dioxide in the body which can lead to arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. It was the last time they met. Due to an inquiry about a cancellation insurance for the upcoming tour, insurance carriers demanded a medical exam by a doctor they trusted. In February 2009, Jackson had an examination performed by Dr. David Slavit of New York. Later, the broker told an AEG senior vice president Jackson had only slight hay fever and had passed the exam \\"with flying colors\\". A second medical exam was supposed to take place on July 6, 2009. According to Lee, she received a frantic call on June 21, 2009, from an aide on Jackson's staff. The aide reported that Jackson was feeling ill. Lee reported overhearing Jackson complain that one side of his body was hot, the other side cold. She believed that somebody had given him something that affected his central nervous system. She advised the aide to take him to the hospital. After his death, the autopsy report revealed that Jackson had a strong heart and was a \\"fairly healthy\\" 50-year-old. According to BBC, his weight was in the acceptable range for a man of his height, but he had punctured arms\\"Punctured arms\\" presumably describes hypodermic needle wounds, while making no effort to distinguish phlebotomy from injection from intravenous therapy, all of which involve hypodermic needles; nor does it distinguish whether hypodermic use was medical or non-medical, medically supervised or unsupervised. and suffered from lung damage and some arthritis. The document shows that Jackson's most serious health problem was his chronically inflamed lungs, but this was not serious enough to be a contributing factor to his death. The post mortem did not uncover any physical problems that may have limited Jackson's ability to perform. \\"His overall health was fine,\\" said Dr. Zeev Kain of the University of California, who reviewed the report for AP but was not involved in the post-mortem examination, \\"The results are in normal limits.\\" The autopsy also revealed that he was partially bald and that his lips, eyebrows, and scalp were tattooed. In 2011, Rogers said in his testimony: \\"The theory that seems less reasonable to me is that Mr. Jackson woke up, and although he was under the influence of sedative medications, managed to give himself another dose.\\" Toxicologist Dan Anderson testified that Demerol was detected in Jackson's system.

The Meath County Council approved the plans however due to controversy over the plans as they were on an area set-aside from redevelopment, the Irish government's Department of the Environment investigated the county for their decision and audited their planning rules.  New plan  In 2012, plans were resurrected for a new Drogheda Stadium. This proposal originally planned for a 3,500 capacity stadium that would be expandable to 8,000. United Park would be demolished and become a local care facility. The plans involved the new stadium being a community stadium with hopes they would be able to host Republic of Ireland youth internationals. In 2018, an agreement was made between the Football Association of Ireland and Louth County Council to construct a new Drogheda Stadium. Construction was delayed due to the FAI struggling to find a buyer for United Park which they had priced at ‚Ç¨2.5 million. The Government of the Republic of Ireland offered no funding for the new stadium, which Drogheda United had been hoping for as they felt they could not proceed with the project without public funds.

(2013). Inoculation theory. In J. P. Dillard & L. Shen (Eds.), The Sage handbook of persuasion: Developments in theory and practice (2nd ed.) (pp. 220-236). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. The theory uses medical inoculation as its explanatory analogy--applied to attitudes (or beliefs) rather than to a disease. It has great potential for building public resilience ('immunity') against misinformation and fake news, for example, in tackling science denialism, risky health behaviours, and emotionally manipulative marketing and political messaging. The theory was developed by social psychologist William J. McGuire in 1961 to explain how attitudes and beliefs change, and more specifically, how to keep existing attitudes and beliefs consistent in the face of attempts to change them. Inoculation theory functions as a motivational strategy to protect attitudes from change‚Äìto confer resistance to counter-attitudinal influences, whether such influences take the form of direct attacks, indirect attacks, sustained pressures, etc., from such sources as the media, advertising, interpersonal communication, peer pressure, and other temptations. The theory posits that weak counterarguments generate resistance within the receiver, enabling them to maintain their beliefs in the face of a future, stronger attack. Following exposure to weak counterarguments (e.g., counterarguments that have been paired with refutations), the receiver will then seek out supporting information to further strengthen their threatened position. The held attitude or belief becomes resistant to a stronger attack, hence the medical analogy of a vaccine. Inoculating messages can be on the same topic as the threatening message (refutational same) or on a similar topic (refutational different). The effect of the inoculating message can be amplified by making the message of vested and immediate importance to the receiver (based on Jack Brehm's psychological reactance theory). Postinoculation talk is also important, as receivers can spread resistance to their social network, and the act of talking to others serves to strengthen their own resistance to attitude change. Therapeutic inoculation is a recent extension in which the treatment messages both persuade and inoculate, that is, both change erroneous attitudes, and at the same time protect against future threats. About Inoculation is a theory that explains how attitudes and beliefs can be made more resistant to future challenges. For an inoculation message to be successful, the recipient experiences threat (a recognition that a held attitude or belief is vulnerable to change) and is exposed to and/or engages in refutational preemption (preemptive refutation, that is, defenses against potential counterarguments). The arguments that are presented in an inoculation message must be strong enough to initiate motivation to maintain current attitudes and beliefs, but weak enough that the receiver will be able to refute the counterargument (Compton, 2013 ; McGuire, 1964McGuire, W. J. (1964). Inducing resistance to persuasion. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in experimental social psychology (Vol. 1, pp. 191‚Äì229). New York: Academic Press.). Inoculation theory has been studied and tested through decades of scholarship, including experimental laboratory research and field studies. Inoculation theory is used today as part of the suite of tools by those engaged in shaping or manipulating public opinion. These contexts include: politics (e.g., Pfau et al., 1990; see Compton & Ivanov, 2013, for a review), health campaigns (e.g., Pfau & VanBockern, 1994; see Compton, Jackson, & Dimmock, 2016, for a review), marketing , educationCompton, J. (2011). Frustration vaccination? Inoculation theory and digital learning. In S. P. Ferris (Ed.), Teaching, learning and the Net generation: Concepts and tools for reaching digital learners (pp. 61‚Äì73). Hershey, PA: IGI Global, and science communication, among others. (See Banas & Rains, 2010, for a meta- analysis, and Compton, 2013, for a narrative overview.) The inoculation process is analogous to the medical inoculation process from which it draws its name; the analogy served as the inaugural exemplar for how inoculation confers resistance. As McGuire (1961) initially explained, medical inoculation works by exposing the body to a weakened form of a virus‚Äîstrong enough to trigger a response (that is, the production of antibodies), but not so strong as to overwhelm the body's resistance. Attitudinal inoculation works the same way: expose the receiver to weakened counterarguments, triggering a process of counterargument which confers resistance to later, stronger persuasive messages. This process works like a metaphorical vaccination: the receiver becomes immune to attacking messages that attempt to change their attitudes or beliefs. Inoculation theory suggests that if one sends out messages with weak counterarguments, an individual can build immunity to stronger messages and strengthen their original attitudes toward an issue. Most inoculation theory research treats inoculation as a preemptive, preventive (prophylactic) messaging strategy‚Äîused before exposure to strong challenges. More recently, scholars have begun to test inoculation as a therapeutic inoculation treatment, administered to those who have the \\"wrong\\" target attitude/belief (see Compton, 2019, for a theoretical overview). In this application, the treatment messages both persuade and inoculate‚Äîmuch like a flu shot that cures those who already have been infected with the flu and protects them against future threats. More research is needed to better understand therapeutic inoculation treatments‚Äîespecially field research that takes inoculation outside of the laboratory setting. Another shift in inoculation research moves from a largely cognitive, intrapersonal (internal) process to a process that is both cognitive and affective, intrapersonal and interpersonal. For example, in contrast to explanations of inoculation that focused nearly entirely on cognitive processes (like internal counterarguing, or refuting persuasive attempts silently, in one's own mind ), more recent research has examined how inoculation messages motivate actual talk (conversation, dialogue) about the target issue. Scholars have confirmed that exposure to an inoculation message motivates more post-inoculation talk (PIT) about the issue. History William McGuire set out to conduct research ‚Äúon ways of inducing resistance to persuasion, under the impression that while much experimental work was being done on factors that increased persuasive effectiveness, little was being done on ways of producing resistance to persuasion‚Äù. McGuire was motivated to study inoculation and persuasion as a result of the aftermath of the Korean War. Nine US prisoners of war, when given the opportunity, elected to remain with their captors. Many assumed they were brainwashed, so McGuire and other social scientists turned to ways of conferring resistance to persuasion.Dewey, R. (2017). Inoculation and forewarning. Chapter 15. Psychology: An introduction. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing. This was a change in extant persuasion research, which was almost exclusively concerned with how to make messages more persuasive, and not the other way around. The theory of inoculation was derived from previous research studying one-sided and two-sided messages. One- sided messages are supportive messages to strengthen existing attitudes, but with no mention of counterpositions. One-sided messages are frequently seen in political campaigns when a candidate denigrates his or her opponent through \\"mudslinging\\". This method is effective in reinforcing extant attitudes of derision toward the opposition and support for the \\"mudslinging\\" candidate. If the audience supports the opposition, however, the attack message is ineffective. Two-sided messages present both counterarguments and refutations of those counterarguments. To gain compliance and source credibility, a two- sided message must demonstrate the sender's position, then the opposition's position, followed by a refutation of the opposition's argument, then finally the sender's position again. McGuire led a series of experiments assessing inoculation's efficacy and adding nuance to our understanding for how it works). Early studies limited testing of inoculation theory to cultural truisms, or beliefs accepted without consideration (e.g., people should brush their teeth daily). This meant it was primarily used toward the attitudes that were rarely, if ever attacked by opposing forces. The early tests of inoculation theory were used on non-controversial issues, (e.g. brushing your teeth is good for you). Few refute that brushing one's teeth is a good habit, therefore external opposing arguments against tooth brushing would not change one's opinion, but it would strengthen support for brushing one's teeth. Studies of inoculation theory currently target less popular or common attitudes, such as whether one should buy a Mac or a Windows-based PC computer or if one should support gay marriage. Implementing inoculation theory in studies of contemporary social issues (from mundane to controversial social issues), and the variety and resurgence of such studies, helps bolster the effectiveness and utility of the theory and provides support that it can be used to strengthen and/or predict attitudes. These later developments of the theory extended inoculation to more controversial and contested topics in the contexts of politics (see Compton & Ivanov, 2013), health, marketing, and contexts in which people have different pre-existing attitudes, such as climate change. The theory has also been applied in education to help prevent substance abuse. Explanation Inoculation theory explains how attitudes, beliefs, or opinions (sometimes referred to generically as \\"a position\\") can be made more resistant to future challenges. Receivers are made aware of the potential vulnerability of an existing position (e.g., attitude, belief). This establishes threat and initiates defenses to future attacks. The idea is that when a weak argument is presented in the inoculation message, processes of refutation or other means of protection will prepare for use of stronger arguments later. It is critical that the attack is strong enough to keep the receiver defensive, but weak enough to not actually change those preexisting ideas. This will hopefully make the receiver actively defensive and allow them to create arguments in favor of their preexisting thoughts. The more active receivers become in their defense the more it will strengthen their own attitudes, beliefs, or opinions. =Key components= There are at least four basic key components to successful inoculation: threat, refutational preemption (preemptive refutation), delay, and involvement. 1\\\\. Threat. Threat provides motivation to protect one's attitudes or beliefs (Pfau, et al. 1997). Threat is a product of the presence of counterarguments in an inoculation message and/or an explicit forewarning of an impending challenge to an existing belief (see Compton & Ivanov, 2012). The message receiver must interpret that a message is threatening and recognize that there is a reason to fight to maintain and strengthen their opinion. If the receiver of an opposing message does not recognize that a threat is present, they will not feel the need to start defending their position and therefore will not change their attitude or strengthen their opinion.. Compton and Ivanov (2012) found that participants who had been forewarned of an attack‚Äìi.e. threat‚Äìbut not given the appropriate tools to combat the attack were more resistant than the control group. In this case, the simple act of forewarning of an attack was enough to resist the counterattitudinal persuasion. 2\\\\. Refutational premeption. This component is the cognitive part of the process. It is the ability to activate one's own argument for future defense and strengthen their existing attitudes through counterarguing (Pfau, 1997).Pfau, M. (1997). The inoculation model of resistance to influence. In F.J. Boster & G. Barnett (Eds.), Progress in communication sciences (Vol. 13, pp. 133‚Äì171). Norwood, NJ: Ablex Scholars have also explored whether other resistance processes might be at work, including affect. Refutational preemption provides specific content that receivers can employ to strengthen attitudes against subsequent change. This aids in the inoculation process by giving the message receiver a chance to argue with the opposing message. It shows the message receiver that their attitude is not the only attitude or even the right attitude, creating a threat to their beliefs. This is beneficial because the receiver will get practice in defending their original attitude, therefore strengthening it. This is important in fighting off future threats of opposing messages and helps to ensure that the message will not affect their original stance on the issues. Refutational preemption acts as the weak strain of the virus in the metaphor. By injecting the weakened virus‚Äìthe opposing opinion‚Äìinto a receiver, this prompts the receiver to strengthen their position, enabling them to fight off the opposing threat. By the time the body processes the virus‚Äìthe counterattack‚Äìthe receiver will have learned how to eliminate the threat. In the case of messaging, if the threatening message is weak or unconvincing, a person can reject the message and stick with their original stance on the matter. By being able to reject threatening messages a person builds strength of their belief and every successful threatening message that they can encounter their original opinions only get stronger. Recent research has studied the presence and function of word-of-mouth communication, or post- inoculation talk, following exposure to inoculation messages. 3\\\\. Delay. There has been much debate on whether there is a certain amount of time necessary between inoculation and further attacks on a persons' attitude that will be most effective in strengthening that person's attitude. McGuire (1961) suggested that delay was necessary to strengthen a person's attitude and since then many scholars have found evidence to back that idea up. There are also scholars on the other side who suggest that too much of a delay lessens the strengthening effect of inoculation. Nevertheless the effect of inoculation can still be significant weeks or even months after initial introduction or the treatment showing that it does produce somewhat long-lasting effects. 4\\\\. Involvement. Pfau, et al. (1997) defined involvement as \\"the importance or salience of an attitude object for a receiver\\" and is ‚Äúamong the most important and widely employed concepts in the scholarly literature on persuasion‚Äù (p. 190). Involvement is critical; an individual's involvement with an issue determines how effective the inoculation process will be, if at all. If an individual does not have a vested interest in the subject, they will not perceive a threat and, consequently, will not feel the need to defend and strengthen their original opinion, rendering the inoculation process ineffective. =Refutational same and different messages= While there are many studies that have been conducted comparing different treatments of inoculation, there is one specific comparison that is mentioned throughout various studies. This is the comparison between what is known as refutational same and refutational different messages. A refutational same message is an inoculation treatment that refutes specific potential counterarguments that will appear in the subsequent persuasion message, while refutational different treatments are refutations that are not the same as those present in the impending persuasive message. Pfau and his colleagues (1990) developed a study during the 1988 United States presidential election. The Republicans were claiming that the Democratic candidate was known to be lenient when it came to the issue of crime. The researchers developed a refutational same message that stated that while the Democratic candidate was in favor of tough sentences, merely tough sentences could not reduce crime. The refutational different message expanded on the candidate's platform and his immediate goals if he were to be elected. The study showed comparable results between the two different treatments. Importantly, as McGuire and others had found previously, inoculation was able to confer resistance to arguments that were not specifically mentioned in the inoculation message. =Psychological reactance= Recent inoculation studies have incorporated Jack Brehm's psychological reactance theory, a theory of freedom and controlBrehm, J. W. (1966). A theory of psychological reactance. New York: Academic Press.Brehm, J. W. (1972). Responses to loss of freedom: A theory of psychological reactance. Morristown, NJ: General Learning Press.Brehm, S. S. & Brehm, J. W. (1981). Psychological reactance: A theory of freedom and control. New York: Academic Press.. The purpose is to enhance or boost resistance outcomes for the two key components of McGuire's inoculation theory: threat and refutational preemption. Such a study is the large complex multisite study of Miller et al. (2103).. The main focus is to determine how to improve the effectiveness of the inoculation process by evaluating and generating reactance to a threatened freedom by manipulating explicit and implicit language and its intensity. While most inoculation studies focus on avoiding reactance, or at the very least, minimizing the impact of reactance on behaviors, in contrast, Miller, et al. chose to manipulate reactance by designing messages to enhance resistance and counterarguing output. They showed that inoculation coupled with reactance-enhanced messages leads to \\"stronger resistance effects\\". Consistent with the medical analogy of inoculation theory, they liken reactance-enhanced messages to a \\"booster shot,\\" increasing the success of the inoculation. Most importantly, reactance- enhanced inoculations result in lesser attitude change‚Äîthe ultimate measure of resistance. The participants in the Miller et al. study were college students, that is emerging adults, who display high reactance to persuasive appeals. This population is in a transitional uncertain stage in life, and are more likely to defend their behavioral freedoms if they feel others are attempting to control their behavior. Populations in transitional stages rely on source credibility as a major proponent of cognitive processing and message acceptance. If the message is explicit and threatens their perceived freedoms, such populations will most likely derogate (criticise) the source and dismiss the message. Two important needs for reactance to a threatened freedom from an emerging adult population are immediacy and vested interestCrano, W.D. (1995). Attitude strength and vested interest. In R.E. Petty & J.A. Krosnick (Eds.) Attituds strength: Antecedents and consequences. The Ohio State University series in attitudes and persuasion (Vol. 4, pp. 131‚Äì157). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum. Miller et al. discuss how emerging adults need to believe their behavioral freedoms, for which they have vestedness, are being threatened, and that the threat exists in real time with almost immediate consequences. Threats that their perceived freedoms will be eliminated or minimized increases motivation to restore that freedom, or possibly engage in the threatened behavior to reinforce their autonomy and control of their attitudes and actions. In addition, that threat does not necessarily need anger to motivate counterargumentation, and simply attempting to provoke anger through manipulation is limited as a technique of gauging negative cognitions. Miller et al. also consider refutational preemption as motivation for producing initial counterarguments and provocation of dissension when contemplating the attack message. A unique feature of their study is examining low-controlling versus high-controlling language and its impact on affect and source credibility. They found reactance enhances key resistance outcomes, including: threat, anger at attack message source, negative cognitions, negative affect, anticipated threat to freedom, anticipated attack message source derogation, perceived threat to freedom, perceived attack message source derogation, and counterarguing. Previously, Miller, et al. (2007)* utilizes Brehm's psychological reactance theory to avoid or eliminate source derogation and message rejection. In this study, their focus is instead Brehm's concept of restoration. Some of their ideas deal with low reactance and whether it can lead to more positive outcomes and if behavioral freedoms can be restored once threatened. As discussed in Miller, et al. (2013), this study ponders whether individuals know they have the behavioral freedom that is being threatened and whether they feel they are worthy of that freedom. This idea also ties into the emerging adult population of the above study and its affirmation that individuals in transitional stages will assert their threatened behavior freedoms Miller et al. (2007) sought to determine how effective explicit and implicit language is at mitigating reactance. Particularly, restoration of freedom is a focus of this study, and gauging how concrete and abstract language informs an individual's belief that he or she has a choice. Some participants were given a persuasive appeal related to health promotion with a following postscripted message designed to remind them they have a choice as a method of restoring the participants' freedom. Using concrete language proved more effective at increasing the possibilities of message acceptance and source credibility. This study is relevant to inoculation research in that it lends credence to Miller, et al. (2013), which transparently incorporates psychological reactance theory in conjunction with inoculation theory to improve the quality of persuasive appeals in the future. =Postinoculation talk= Following Compton and Pfau's (2009) research on postinoculation talk, Ivanov, et al. (2012) explore how cognitive processing could lead to talk with others after receiving an inoculation message in which threat exists. The authors found that message processing leads to postinoculation talk which could potentially lead to stronger resistance to attack messages. Further, postinoculation talk acts virally, spreading inoculation through talk with others on issues that involve negative cognitions and affect. In previous research, the assumption that talk was subvocal (existing only intrapersonally) was prevalent, without concern for the impact of vocal talk with other individuals. The authors deem vocal talk important to the incubation process. Their study concluded that individuals who receive an inoculation message that contains threat will talk to others about the message and talk more frequently than individuals who do not receive an inoculation message. Additionally, the act of postinoculation talk bolsters their attitudes and increases resistance to the message as well as increasing the likelihood that talk will generate a potentially viral effect‚Äìspreading inoculation to others through the act of vocal talk. Real-world applications Most research has involved inoculation as applied to interpersonal communication (persuasion), marketing, health and political messaging. More recently, inoculation strategies are starting to show potential as a counter to science denialism and cyber security breaches. =Science denialism= Science denialism has rapidly increased in recent years. A major factor is the rapid spread of misinformation and fake news via social media (such as Facebook), as well as prominent placing of such misinformation in Google searches. Climate change denialism is a particular problem in that its global nature and lengthy timeframe is uniquely difficult for the individual mind to grasp, as the human brain has evolved to deal with short-term and immediate dangers. However, John Cook and colleagues have shown that inoculation theory shows promise in countering denialism. This involves a two-step process. Firstly, list and deconstruct the 50 or so most common myths about climate change, by identifying the reasoning errors and logical fallacies of each one. Secondly, use the concept of parallel argumentation to explain the flaw in the argument by transplanting the same logic into a parallel situation, often an extreme or absurd one. Adding appropriate humour can be particularly effective. =Cyber security= Treglia and Delia (2017) apply inoculation theory to cyber security (internet security, cybercrime). People are susceptible to electronic or physical tricks, scams or misrepresentations that may lead to deviating from security procedures and practices, opening the operator, organization or system to exploits, malware, theft of data or disruption of systems and services. Inoculation in this area improves peoples resistance to such attacks.Treglia, J., & Delia, M. (2017). Cyber security inoculation. Presented at NYS Cyber Security Conference and Symposium on Information Assurance, Empire State Plaza Convention Center, Albany, NY, June 3‚Äì4. Psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information via the internet and social media is one part of the broader construct of social engineering. =Political campaigning= Compton and Ivanov (2013) offer a comprehensive review of political inoculation scholarship and outline new directions for future work. In 1990, Pfau and his colleagues examined inoculation through the use of direct mail during the 1988 United States presidential campaign. The researchers were specifically interested in comparing inoculation and post hoc refutation. Post hoc refutation is another form of building resistance to arguments; however, instead of building resistance prior to future arguments, like inoculation, it attempts to restore original beliefs and attitudes after the counterarguments have been made. Results of the research reinforced prior conclusions that refutational same and different treatments both increase resistance to attacks. More importantly, results also indicated inoculation was superior to post hoc refutation when attempting to protect original beliefs and attitudes. Other examples are studies showing it is possible to inoculate political supporters of a candidate in a campaign against the influence of an opponent's attack adverts ; and inoculate citizens of fledgling democracies against the spiral of silence (fear of isolation) which can thwart the expression of minority views. =Health= Much of the research conducted in health is attempting to create campaigns that will encourage people to stop unhealthy behaviors (e.g. getting people to stop smoking or prevention of teen alcoholism). Compton, Jackson and Dimmock (2016) reviewed studies where inoculation theory was applied to health-related messaging. There are many inoculation studies with the intent to inoculate children and teenagers to prevent them from smoking, doing drugs or drinking alcohol. Much of the research shows that targeting at a young age can help them resist peer pressure in high school or college. An important example of inoculation theory usage is protecting young adolescents against influences of peer pressure, which can lead to smoking, underage drinking, and other harmful behaviors Godbold and Pfau (2000) used sixth graders from two different schools and applied inoculation theory as a defense against peer pressure to drinking alcohol. They hypothesized that a normative message (a message tailored around the current social norms) would be more effective than an informative message. An informative message is a message tailored around giving individuals information pieces. In this case, the information was why drinking alcohol is bad. The second hypothesis was that subjects who receive a threat two weeks later will be more resistant than those receiving an immediate attack. The results supported the first hypothesis partially. The normative message created higher resistance from the attack, but was not necessarily more effective. The second hypothesis was also not supported; therefore, the time lapse did not create further resistance for teenagers against drinking. One major outcome from this study was the resistance created by utilizing a normative message. In another study conducted by Duryea (1983), the results were far more supportive of the theory. The study also attempted to find the message to use for educational training to help prevent teen drinking and driving. The teen subjects were given resources to combat attempts to persuade them to drink and drive or to get into a vehicle with a drunk driver. The subjects were: 1) shown a film; 2) participated in question and answer; 3) role playing exercises; and 4) a slide show. The results showed that a combination of the four methods of training was effective in combating persuasion to drink and drive or get into a vehicle with a drunk driver. The trained group was far more prepared to combat the persuasive arguments. Additionally, Parker, Ivanov, and Compton (2012) found that inoculation messages can be an effective deterrent against pressures to engage in unprotected sex and binge drinking‚Äîeven when only one of these issues is mentioned in the health message. Compton, Jackson and Dimmock (2016) discuss important future research, such as preparing new mothers for overcoming their health concerns (eg, about breastfeeding, sleep deprivation and post-partum depression). Inoculation theory applied to prevention of smoking has been heavily studied. These studies have mainly focused on preventing youth smokers‚Äìinoculation seems to be most effective in young children. For example, Pfau, et al. (1992) examined the role of inoculation when attempting to prevent adolescents from smoking. One of the main goals of the study was to examine longevity and persistence of inoculation. Elementary school students watched a video warning them of future pressures to smoke. In the first year, resistance was highest among those with low self-esteem. At the end of the second year, students in the group showed more attitudinal resistance to smoking than they did previously (Pfau & Van Bockern 1994). Importantly, the study and its follow-up demonstrate the long-lasting effects of inoculation treatments. Grover (2011) researched the effectiveness of the \\"truth\\" anti- smoking campaign on smokers and non-smokers. The truth adverts aimed to show young people that smoking was unhealthy, and to expose the manipulative tactics of tobacco companies. Grover showed that inoculation works differently for smokers and non-smokers (ie, potential smokers). For both groups, the truth adverts increased anti-smoking and anti-tobacco-industry attitudes, but the effect was greater for smokers. The strength of this attitude change is partly mediated (controlled) by aversion to branded tobacco industry products. However, counter-intuitively, exposure to pro-smoking sdverts increased aversion to branded tobacco industry products (at least in this sample). In general, Grover demonstrated that the initial attitude plays a major role in the ability to inoculate an individual. Future health-related studies can be extremely beneficial to communities. Some research areas include present-day issues (for example, inoculation-based strategies for addiction intervention to assist sober individuals from relapsing), as well as promoting healthy eating habits, exercising, breastfeeding and creating positive attitude towards mammograms. An area that has been underdeveloped is mental health awareness. Because of the large number of young adults and teens committing suicide due to bullying, inoculation messages could be effective. =Marketing= The field of public relations is the perfect place for inoculation theory to be used because the field itself is meant to act on the public, their opinions, and their actions. It took some time for inoculation theory to be applied to marketing, because of many possible limitations. Lessne and Didow (1987) reviewed publications about inoculation application to marketing campaigns and their limitations. They note that, at the time, the closest to true marketing context was Hunt's 1973 study on the Chevron campaign. The Federal Trade Commission stated that Chevron had deceived consumers on the effectiveness of their gas additive F-310. The FTC was going to conduct a corrective advertising campaign to disclose the information. In response, Chevron ran a print campaign to combat the anticipated FTC campaign. The double page advertisement read, \\"If every motorist used Chevron with F-310 for 2000 miles, air pollutants would be reduced by thousands of tons in a single day. The FTC doesn't think that's significant.\\" Hunt used this real- life message as an inoculation treatment in his research. He used the corrective campaign by the FTC as the attack on the positive attitude toward Chevron. The results indicated that a supportive treatment offered less resistance than a refutational treatment. Another finding was that when an inoculative treatment is received, but no attack is followed, there is a drop in attitude. One of the major limitations in this study was that Hunt did not allow a time elapse between the treatment and the attack, which was a major element of McGuire's original theory. Inoculation theory is especially useful with an audience who already has an opinion on a brand. It is the perfect way to convince already faithful customers that they are making the right choice in trusting your company and to keep the customer coming back in the future, and particularly to protect commercial brands against the influence of comparative adverts from a competitor . An excellent example is Apple Computers and their \\"Get A Mac\\" campaign. This campaign expertly followed inoculation theory in targeting those who already preferred Mac computers. The series of ads put out in the duration of the campaign had a similar theme; they directly compared Macs and PCs. Inoculation theory applies here as these commercials are likely aimed at Apple users. These ads are effective because Apple users already prefer Mac computers, and they are unlikely to change their minds. This comparison creates refutational preemption, showing Macs may not be the only viable options on the market. The TV ads throw in a few of the positive advantages that PCs have over Macs, but by the end of every commercial they reiterate the fact that Macs are ultimately the superior consumer product. This reassures viewers that their opinion is still right and that Macs are in fact better than PCs. The inoculation theory in these ads keep Mac users coming back for Apple products, and may even have them coming back sooner for the new bigger and better products that Apple releases - especially important as technology is continually changing, and something new is always being pushed onto the shelves. Inoculation theory research in advertising and marketing has mainly focused on promoting healthy lifestyles with the help of a product or for a specific company's goal. However, shortly after McGuire published his inoculation theory, Szybillo and Heslin (1973) applied the concepts that McGuire used in the health industry to advertising and marketing campaigns. They sought to provide answers for advertisers marketing a controversial product or topic: if an advertiser knew the product or campaign would cause an attack, what would be the best advertising strategy? Would they want to refute the arguments or reaffirm their claims? They chose a then-controversial topic: \\"Inflatable air bags should be installed as passive safety devices in all new cars.\\" They tested four advertising strategies: defense, refutational-same, refutational-different and supportive. The results confirmed that a reaffirmation or refutation approach is better than not addressing the attack. They also confirmed that refuting the counterargument is more effective than a supportive defense (though the refutational-different effect was not much greater than for supportive defense). Szybillo and Heslin also manipulated the time of the counterargument attack, and the credibility of the source, but neither was significant. In 2006, a jury awarded Martin Dunson and Lisa Jones, the parents of one-year-old Marquis Matthew Dunson, $5 million for the death of their son. Dunson and Jones sued Johnson & Johnson, the makers of Infant's Tylenol claiming that there were not enough warnings regarding the dosage of acetaminophenDaly, E.M. (2006, July). Jury awards $5M in infant Tylenol poisoning case. Law360. Retrieved from https://www.law360.com/articles/7709/jury-awards-5m-in-infant- tylenol-poisoning-case What resulted was a Johnson & Johnson campaign that encouraged parents to practice proper dosage procedures. In a review of the campaign by Veil and Kent (2008), they breakdown the message of the campaign utilizing the basic concepts of inoculation theory. They theorize that Johnson & Johnson used inoculation to alter the negative perception of their product. The campaign began running prior to the actual verdict, thus the timing seemed suspicious. A primary contention of Veil and Kent was that the intentions of Johnson & Johnson were not to convey consumer safety guidelines, but to change how consumers might respond to further lawsuits on overdose. The inoculation strategy used by Johnson & Johnson is evident in their campaign script: \\"Some people think if you have a really bad headache, you should take extra medicine.\\" The term \\"some people\\" is referring to the party suing the company. The commercial also used the Vice President of Sales for Tylenol to deliver a message, who may be considered a credible source. In 1995, Burgoon and colleagues published empirical findings on issue/advocacy advertising campaigns. Most, if not all, of these types of advertising campaigns utilize inoculation to create the messages. They posited that inoculation strategies should be used for these campaigns to enhance the credibility of the corporation, and to aid in maintain existing consumer attitudes (but not to change consumer attitudes). Based on the analysis of previous research they concluded issue/advocacy advertising is most effective for reinforcing support and avoid potential slippage in the attitudes of supporters. They used Mobil Oil's issue/advocacy campaign message. They found that issue/advocacy adverts did work to inoculate against counterattitudinal attacks. They also found that issue/advocacy adverts work to protect the source credibility. The results also indicated that political views play a role in the effectiveness of the campaigns. Thus, conservatives are easier to inoculate than moderates or liberals. They also concluded that females are more likely to be inoculated with these types of campaigns. An additional observation was that the type of content used in these campaigns contributed to the campaigns success. The further the advertisement was from \\"direct self-benefit\\" the greater the inoculation effect was on the audience. Compton and Pfau (2004) extended inoculation theory into the realm of credit card marketing targeting college students. They wondered if inoculation could help protect college students against dangerous levels of credit card debt and/or help convince them to increase their efforts to pay down any existing debt. The results were encouraging: Inoculation seemed to protect students' healthy attitudes about debt and some of their behavioral intentions. Further, they found some evidence that those who received the inoculation treatment were more likely to talk to their friends and family about issues of credit card debt.

He spent his entire naval career in the Navy helping to develop the field of surgery and medicine. He was especially prominent‚Äîand praised‚Äîduring the American Civil War. Military service Appointed an assistant surgeon in the United States Navy on 26 March 1834, Pinkney received orders to the sloop of war Erie on 5 May. Ordered to report by 20 June, he joined the ship at Boston, Massachusetts, on 24 June, shortly before she sailed for the Brazil Station. Detached from Erie on 18 September 1837, he began two months of leave on 20 September, later changed to \\"waiting orders.\\" Ordered to duty at the Naval Asylum at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 9 April 1838, he was detached from that duty on 2 April 1839, receiving one month of leave. He then joined the frigate Brandywine, assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron, on 17 August, shortly after she was recommissioned. On 12 February 1840, Commodore Isaac Hull, commanding the squadron, ordered Pinkney to return to the United States, and the assistant surgeon reported his arrival on 24 April. Ordered thence, on 12 October 1840, to the storeship Relief, on the Pacific Squadron, Pinkney later served again on board Erie. He was promoted to surgeon on 27 October 1841. Commodore Alexander J. Dallas, commanding the Pacific Squadron, granted Surgeon Pinkney permission to return to the United States in February 1844, and he arrived there in April of the same year. Ordered to the Receiving Ship and Naval Station, Baltimore, Maryland, on 24 June 1844, he received orders to \\"discharge duties\\" at the Naval Rendezvous (recruiting station) as well, on 21 April 1845. Detached from the Baltimore Station on 19 September 1846 and placed in the status of \\"waiting orders,\\" Pinkney was ordered to Albany on 14 October; he reported to that new sloop of war, assigned to the Home Squadron, a little less than a fortnight later, on 27 October. Transferred to sloop of war Germantown, also in the Home Squadron, three days after Christmas the following year 28 December 1847, he was detached from that ship on 23 February 1848. Carried on the status of \\"waiting orders\\" on 1 January of the following year [1849], Pinkney was ordered to the new sidewheel sloop of war Saranac on 4 February 1850, to report for duty on the 24th of that month. Detached from that ship on 22 July 1851, the surgeon was then ordered [10 September] to review candidates for admission to the U.S. Naval Academy. Following another period of \\"waiting orders,\\" he was ordered to the Naval Academy on 3 April 1852. Detached from the Academy on 5 July 1855, Pinkney subsequently received orders to the sidewheel frigate Susquehanna on 31 March 1856, and served in that ship as she cruised in the Mediterranean and off the coast of Central America, and later operated in assistance of the steam frigate Niagara in her unsuccessful attempt to lay the Atlantic Cable in August 1857. Detached from Susquehanna on 19 April 1858, he was ordered to the U.S. Naval Hospital at Norfolk, Virginia, on 21 October, his actual time of reporting delayed from 1 November to 1 December 1858. Detached from that medical facility ashore on 9 June 1859, Pinkney received orders to join the screw frigate San Jacinto as she prepared for a cruise to the coast of Africa. Illness, however, shortened Pinkney's tour of duty in San Jacinto, as he was detached from the ship at Cadiz, Spain, and ordered home \\"because of ill health\\" on 28 March 1860. Arriving back in the United States on 23 April, he went to Easton, Maryland, where he apparently remained until he was ordered to special duty in Washington, D.C., on 8 June 1861. Detached from duty in the capitol on 12 December 1861, he received orders to report as the Fleet Surgeon, Mississippi Squadron, on the last day 1861. Civil War service Pinkney served in the Mississippi Squadron for the duration of the American Civil War, performing \\"the most arduous duty in caring for the sick and wounded.\\" He succeeded in getting possession of the Commercial Hotel, in Memphis, Tennessee, a building \\"admirably located and well adapted for hospital purposes\\" in March 1863. The shortage of assistant surgeons compelled Pinkney to serve on board the U.S. Navy Hospital Ship Red Rover, \\"where he has been of great service fitting out his department.\\" Acting Rear-Admiral David Dixon Porter, Commanding the Mississippi Squadron, called Pinkney's presence Porter used the occasion to dispel any misgivings about the fleet surgeon's \\"little peculiarities\\" (Pinkney was known to be of \\"a 'peppery' nature and stood firmly on his dignity and rights\\"), writing to Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles on 30 March 1863 of Pinkney that \\"...a more zealous, devoted officer to the profession, and to the country, does not exist anywhere...\\" Soon thereafter, the fleet surgeon directed the provision of new ships fitting out at St. Louis, Missouri, and Cincinnati, Ohio, with medical stores during June, 1863, and later that summer supervised the conversion of a seized Rebel building at Memphis, Tennessee, into a hospital. Pinkney received the wounded from the fall of Fort Pillow in April 1864, on board the Hospital Ship Red Rover, and treated them. Subsequently, one of the nursing Sisters, employed on board Red Rover, wrote to express her appreciation for the kindness Pinkney had extended to them. \\"Through them,\\" Sister Angela, of the Order of the Holy Cross, wrote on 11 August 1864, Post-Civil War service Detached on 15 June 1865, Pinkney, over the next four years (until 8 November 1869), performed a succession of duties, serving as a member of the Board of Visitors of the U.S. Naval Academy, presided over the board that examined candidates for admission to the Academy, and served as a delegate to represent the Medical Department of the Navy to the Medical Department in England. Ordered to duty at Washington, D.C., on 1 October 1870, he was promoted to the rank of Medical Director on 3 March 1871. Final years Detached from the Washington Navy Yard and retired with that rank on 7 June 1873, Pinkney, who received a doctor of laws degree from his alma mater, St. John's College, Annapolis, in 1873, ultimately died in Easton, Maryland, on 15 December 1877. Honored in ship naming The United States Navy ship USS Pinkney (APH-2) which saw action in the Pacific Ocean during World War II was named in his honor.

Biography Borja was the son of Galcer√°n de Borja y Moncada and Tecla Navarro de Alpicat, born in 1446. He was a canon of the cathedral chapter of Valencia and the paborde of Albal as well as a minor cleric.Miranda, Salvador. 1998. \\"Consistory of August 31, 1492 (I)\\". Pope Sixtus IV, also a relative, made Borja protonotary apostolic and an editor of apostolic letters circa 1408. Pope Innocent VIII made him the Governor of Rome. Borja had an illegitimate son named Galcer√°n. He was elected archbishop of Monreale on September 13, 1483, an archdiocese he would never visit but occupy until his death. There is no evidence he was ever ordained a priest or consecrated as bishop. After the papal conclave, 1492, which elected Borja's relative Rodrigo pope as Alexander VI, he was created cardinal-priest of S. Susanna on August 31, 1492. Borja went on to accumulate benefices and their associated revenues: he became the administrator of the see of Olomouc, Moravia from February 8, 1493, to January 30, 1497. He was named legate a latere to Alfonso II of Naples on April 18, 1494. Borja was named bishop of Ferrara on October 29, 1494, taking possession of the see on June 14, 1497, until his death. He was also the bishop of Melfi from September 19, 1494, until December 3, 1498. In May 1494, he attended the coronation of Alfonso II of Naples, along with one patriarch, seven archbishops, and forty bishops; Borja himself crowned Alfronso king on May 18.Chambers, 2006, p. 94. Along with Cesare Borgia and Alexander VI, Juan met with Alfonso on July 12, 1494, in Vicovaro to co-ordinate military strategy against Cardinal Ascanio Sforza (whom Borja would later replace in the office of the Vice-Chancellor in 1500) and his allies as well as Charles VIII of France.Chambers, 2006, p. 95. He brought Alexander VI's terms of peace to Charles VIII on December 25, 1494, in Bracciano before retreating with the pontiff on January 7, 1495, to the Castel Sant'Angelo (and then on May 27, 1495, to Orvieto) to take refuge from French troops.

Ground was broken in 2008 but it wasn't until 2014 that significant building work was undertaken on site. Some of these delays were due to financial reasons, as a decline in property values mean that the new stadium was more dependent on state funding. Planning permission was extended for a further five-year period. Following Finn Harps 2017 AGM in May 2017, Finn Harps announced that following a stall in progress, revised plans would be launched in summer 2017, co-ordinated by former Chief Executive of North West Tourism Paul McLoone. The expected capacity of this updated proposal was projected to be between 5,500-6,000 with a seated capacity consisting of a main stand with 1,954 seats and another seated stand opposite that seating between 2,000-2,500, combined with terraced ends totaling an extra standing capacity of 1,500.

The film is adapted from a story from the 2001 anthology Israeli film Asphalt Zahov. It was filmed on location in Kerala, India and was released in cinemas in India, the US and the UK. Plot Before the Rains is set in 1930s Malabar District of the Madras Presidency of British India, against the backdrop of a growing nationalist movement. An idealistic young Indian man, T.K. Neelan (Rahul Bose) finds himself torn between his ambitions for the future and his loyalty to tradition when people in his village learn of an affair between his British boss and close friend Henry Moores (Linus Roache) and a married village woman Sajani (Nandita Das). Henry and T.K. are working on constructing a road in rural Kerala. The start of the film focuses on the affair between Henry and his house-maid Sajani. They make love near a waterfall, witnessed by two children who flee. Both Henry and Sajani are married to different partners and both know of each other's marriages. Henry's wife Laura and son Peter return from their vacation in England. Sajani is distraught but Henry assures Sajani that she is the one he loves. Sajani's violent husband finds out about her infidelity and brutally beats her. Sajani flees to Henry's house; Henry instructs T.K. to take her away into hiding. T.K tells Sajani never to come back as she is now disgraced and her presence in the village will endanger Henry's life. Sajani does not believe T.K but leaves nonetheless. During this time, resentment towards the British grows stronger; news about an adulterous act between an Indian woman and a British man would be inflammatory. Sajani's love for Henry drives her back to Henry's house. Henry tells her to leave and admits that he does not love her. A distraught Sajani finds T.K's handgun (a gift from Henry), shoots herself in the chest and dies. T.K. and Henry throw her body in the river to conceal her death. Sajani's disappearance garners interest in the village. Sajani's brother Manas and husband gather the men of the village to search the jungle for her. The same two children who discovered Sajani and Henry near the waterfall in compromising position then discover her dead body. It is established that a bullet from an English pistol killed her. A mob led by Sajani's husband attacks T.K., the only Indian man around with a handgun. The bullet and the handgun match and T.K is tried by the village council for murder. T.K is forced to tell the truth to the council, while Henry's wife discovers her husband's affair and his involvement in Sajani's death and leaves her husband to return to England with their son. T.K proves his innocence to the council in a test of fire. The council elders tell T.K. that he has to kill Henry to get his honour back since he aided and abetted in covering up a killing. Sajani's brother and T.K. go to kill Henry. When it comes to the moment for T.K to kill Henry, he cannot pull the trigger but instead tells Henry that no man owns anything, it belongs to everyone. The film ends with the onset of the monsoon. Henry and T.K's road holds and does not yield to the pouring rains. Cast *Linus Roache as Henry Moores *Nandita Das as Sajani *Rahul Bose as T. K.

Concluding that the story was \\"timeless and universal\\", Sivan changed the story's setting to a Nayar community in 1930s Kerala, India. He felt a special affinity with the area as he was born and raised in Kerala. During the 33-day shoot, Sivan endeavoured to capture the feel of cinematographer Subrata Mitra. He used mainly 16mm and 18mm lenses to achieve the film's panoramic wide shots which he recorded in 1.85:1 aspect ratio on Kodak Vision2 film stock. He was also inspired by the work of artist Raja Ravi Varma for the interiors, particularly in the use of lighting. The costume department dressed the principal characters in contrasting colours to highlight their differing backgrounds; Moores was dressed in muted colours while Sanjani wore bright saris and jewellery. Several complications were involved in filming in the area. Since much of the film involves road construction, the production team found an abandoned road and completed it at different stages in three different areas to allow them to shoot all three building stages simultaneously. For one scene Das's character was supposed to float down a river. The water proved to be too cold, so the crew had to set up a large tub of warm water next to the river for the close-up. Release Before the Rains premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. It was also screened at Pittsburgh's Silk Screen Asian American Film Festival, the Tribeca Film Festival, and the Palm Springs International Film Festival. It was released commercially in India on 14 August 2009. =Reception= The film was released in Indian, UK and US cinemas. The movie got a mixed critical reception with Rotten Tomatoes giving it an average rating of 5.2 and Metacritic giving it a 47/100 rating. Sivan's camera work was widely praised. The lead actors' performances, especially that of Rahul Bose was also applauded. The predominant thread of criticism in most of the reviews were that the film stuck to an old-school format and failed to stir emotion or engage the viewer. Soundtrack The film's music is by Mark Kilian who was nominated for a Discovery of the Year award at the 2008 World Soundtrack Awards for his work on the film. It has some Carnatic songs as well that feature Indian percussionist Sivamani. #Main Titles ‚Äì 3:56 #Honey Drive ‚Äì 0:50 #Hand Lines ‚Äì 3:41 #Funeral ‚Äì 2:45 #Sacred Dragonfly ‚Äì 1:34 #Sajani In Water ‚Äì 3:52 #The Search Begins ‚Äì 3:28 #Before The Rains ‚Äì 3:46 #The Kammadan ‚Äì 3:29 #Sajani's Struggle ‚Äì 3:08 #Down The River ‚Äì 1:02 #Did You Kill Her? ‚Äì 2:27 #All Quiet ‚Äì 1:21 #Chase And Standoff ‚Äì 3:36 #Reminiscence ‚Äì 2:21 #Feeling The Loss ‚Äì 1:51 #Coming For TK ‚Äì 2:21 #The Prayer ‚Äì 3:29 #End Credits ‚Äì 3:49 ReferencesExternal links 2007 films 2000s historical drama films 2000s Malayalam-language films English-language films Malayalam-language films British films British historical drama films British Indian films English-language Indian films Films about interracial romance Roadside Attractions films Films directed by Santosh Sivan 2007 drama films ","title":"Before the Rains"},{"id":"18546798","text":"Captain William Newton Lancaster (14 February 1898 ‚Äì 20 April 1933) was a pioneering British aviator. Early life Born in Birmingham, England, Lancaster emigrated to Australia prior to World War I. In 1916, he joined first the Australian Army and later the Australian Flying Corps. He remained in Britain after the war and joined the Royal Air Force, marrying Annie Maude Besant in 1919 and serving in India during the 1920s. He was promoted to flying officer from pilot officer on 30 April 1921. England to Australia In 1927, Lancaster transferred to the RAF Reserve (he continued to hold a commission until 30 April 1930), and decided to make a name for himself by flying from England to Australia. He made this flight in the Avro Avian Red Rose, accompanied by Australian Jessie \\"Chubbie\\" Miller, who helped finance the flight.Love is in the Air - Times Online It was at the time one of the longest flights made in such a small aircraft‚Äîalthough they were overtaken en route by Bert Hinkler in another Avian‚Äîand the first England-Australia flight by a woman.Records Territory A huge crowd greeted them on arrival in Darwin, and on their subsequent tour around Australia.Photo of crowd in Canberra, National Archives of Australia In 1928 Lancaster and Miller moved to the United States on the promise of a Hollywood movie which was never made. Lancaster then made a living selling British aero engines, and Miller became an aviator in her own right, competing in the famous \\"Powder Puff Derby\\" of 1929.History of American Women's Aviation Feats - 1929 Women's Air Race: Aviation History: Wings Over Kansas at www.wingsoverkansas.com Murder trial In 1932, Lancaster had been in Mexico looking for work. At the same time, Haden Clarke, a male American writer, had been living in Lancaster and Miller's Florida home in order to assist Miller's writing of her autobiography. Clarke and Miller had developed a relationship in Lancaster's absence, and Clarke convinced Miller to leave Lancaster and marry him instead. Upon receipt of this news, Lancaster returned promptly to Florida. On 20 April, Clarke was killed by a gunshot wound to the head. Despite that the gun was Lancaster's, and that he admitted forging suicide notes found at the scene (one addressed to Lancaster and another to Miller), forensic evidence provided by the prosecution was confusing to the jury. Albert H. Hamilton, a criminologist with a somewhat dubious past, provided easy-to-understand testimony in Lancaster's favour. Additionally, even though Lancaster and Miller had dissolved their romance and partnership, Miller spoke in Lancaster's defence and the trial judge gave a summing up in his favour. Lancaster was acquitted of murder after 5 hours of deliberation. It is regarded that although the evidence was in doubt, a main factor in Lancaster's acquittal was his calm, straightforward, gentlemanly demeanor in the courtroom; and the portrayal of the victim as depressive, drug-addicted and suicidal. Public opinion may also have played its part in influencing the jury; indeed, at one point the behaviour of those in gallery became so unruly (cheering for Lancaster), that Judge Atkinson interrupted with a firm, \\"This is not a vaudeville show!\\"Great American Trials Vol 1 Final flight After the trial, Lancaster and Miller returned to England. Broke and friendless, Lancaster decided to attempt the hotly contested England-to-South Africa speed record. Purchasing the Avro Avian Southern Cross Minor from Charles Kingsford Smith, he departed England on 11 April 1933. As the Avian was considerably slower than other aircraft of the time, Lancaster would have to make very short stops and get very little sleep to have any hope of achieving the record. Having got lost several times, having not slept for 30 hours and being ten hours behind his intended time, Lancaster departed from Reggane on the evening of 12 April to make a night crossing of the Sahara. The Avian's engine failed after less than an hour's flying, and he crash-landed in the desert far north of his expected flight path. Relatively uninjured and occasionally firing flares he awaited rescue. Searches by aircraft, however, were too far to the south, and a car searching from Reggane was also unsuccessful. He died eight days later, on 20 April 1933, exactly one year after Clarke‚Äôs death. His final message, written on a fuel card on the morning of the 20th, was \\"So the beginning of the eighth day has dawned. It is still cool. I have no water. I am waiting patiently. Come soon please. Fever wracked me last night. Hope you get my full log. Bill\\" Discovery The crash site was discovered by French troops on 12 February 1962, approximately 170 miles south of Reggane in the Tanezrouft region. Lancaster's body had been mummified, and his diary and personal effects had survived intact. The diary was returned to Miller, who allowed it to be published. Lancaster was buried in Algeria. The wreckage of the Southern Cross Minor displayed at the Queensland Museum. The wreck of the Southern Cross Minor was recovered in 1975.The Southern Cross Minor (re)discovered in 1975 It now resides in the Queensland Museum in Brisbane but is now held in storage and no longer on public display. Popular culture A TV miniseries called The Lancaster Miller Affair was made in Australia in 1985.Australiantelevision.net The 2009 movie The Last Flight by Karim Dridi is based on the French novel Le dernier vol de Lancaster by Sylvain Estibal, which is loosely based on the real-life events surrounding the disappearance of Bill Lancaster. In 2014 Andrew Lancaster premiered his 90min family documentary The Lost Aviator which challenges the Lancaster family as to whether Bill Lancaster was guilty of murder in Miami 1931. In 2017, Carol Baxter's book The Fabulous Flying Mrs Miller: an Australian's true story of adventure, danger, romance and murder, which tells Bill and Chubbie's story, was published by Allen & Unwin, Sydney.

He was able to walk around freely and appear in public without being identified, he spent his days at the local kafana \\"Luda kuƒáa\\" drinking slivovitz, singing folk poetry, and playing Gusle (in front of the pictures of Karad≈æiƒá and Mladic on the walls of the cafe). The website of Dabiƒá's company at www.psy-help-energy.com was maintained by Zoran Pavloviƒá of Pavloviƒá Consulting, Belgrade. When interviewed by Belgrade's Blic newspaper, Pavloviƒá stated that he had frequently met with Dabiƒá, discussing alternative medicine, sports and sometimes politics, without the least suspicion of his true identity. He described Dabiƒá as a friendly and eloquent individual towards whom he had felt sympathetic. Dabiƒá had published several articles in the Zdrav ≈æivot (\\"Healthy Life\\") journal of alternative medicine since October 2007. Introduced as a \\"spiritual explorer\\", he also gave lectures comparing meditation techniques practiced by Orthodox monks. On 23 May 2008, Dabiƒá gave a talk at the \\"Third Festival of Healthy Life\\" (Treƒái Festival zdravog ≈æivota) on the topic of \\"how to cherish one's own energies\\" (Kako negovati sopstvene energije). The editor of Zdrav ≈æivot, Goran Kojic, confirmed that Dabiƒá appeared as a highly cultured and sympathetic man, speaking Serbian free of any Bosnian accent. Serbia's Minister of Health Tomica Milosavljeviƒá stated that there was no registration for a Dragan or David Dabiƒá as a licensed physician. The arrest came just two days before the ICTY's chief prosecutor, Serge Brammertz, was due to visit Serbia.\\"Brammertz in Belgrade next week\\".

The Austrian police talked to him during a raid regarding an unrelated homicide case in the area where Karad≈æiƒá lived, but failed to recognize his real identity. He had a Croatian passport under the name Petar Glumac, and claimed to be in Vienna for training. Police did not ask any further questions nor demand to fingerprint him as he appeared calm and readily answered questions. His nephew Dragan Karad≈æiƒá has claimed in an interview to the Corriere della Sera that Radovan Karad≈æiƒá had attended football matches of Serie A, and visited Venice under the false identity of Petar Glumac. Arrest and extradition Karad≈æiƒá's arrest occurred on 21 July 2008 in Belgrade.Staff. Serbia captures fugitive Karadzic, BBC, 22 July 2008 However, UK's Channel 4 News reported that Karad≈æiƒá's lawyer, Sveta Vujaciƒá, stated \\"I'm 100% sure that ... Radovan Karad≈æiƒá was arrested on 18 July at half past nine (in the evening) ...\\"According to the vice-chairman of the Serbian Skup≈°tina Bo≈æidar Deliƒá the fact that the parliament had been dissolved for two weeks of break was correlated with the first version and he has understood the roots for this decision stemming from Karad≈æiƒá' arrest only after several days had elapsed and the news had been publicised (Bo≈æidar Deliƒá' statement, Channel One (Russia); retrieved 24 July 2008. These claims were denied by the president of the National Council for Cooperation with the Hague Tribunal Rasim Ljajiƒá. Milan Dilpariƒá, an investigative judge at Serbia's special war crimes tribunal, terminated the investigation and ruled: \\"all conditions have been met for his transfer to the Hague to face trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The decision could be appealed within 72 hours to the appeals board, and its decision is final. Karad≈æiƒá was examined by a doctor, and would remain in a special detention unit of Serbia's war crimes court pending transfer to the UN tribunal. The Daily Telegraph reported that the former general of the Bosnian Serb army Ratko Mladiƒá gave away the whereabouts of Karad≈æiƒá in order to avoid prosecution from the Hague. It also reported that Mladiƒá, with the help of his people, was talking about giving himself up. A statement issued by the office of President Boris Tadiƒá said: \\"Radovan Karad≈æiƒá was located and arrested tonight [and] was brought to the investigative judge of the War Crimes Court in Belgrade, in accordance with the law on cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.\\" Serbian security forces were credited with having located and captured Karad≈æiƒá, without any further details being given of the circumstances. Sources in the Serbian government told Reuters news agency he had been under surveillance for several weeks, following a tip-off from a foreign intelligence service.\\"Serbia captures fugitive Karad≈æiƒá\\". BBC News, 21 July 2008 Karad≈æiƒá was transferred to The Hague into ICTY custody on 30 July. He was detained in a jail cell that Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá had used. The jail is in a separate wing of a Dutch prison near the seaside resort of Scheveningen. Until acquittal or conviction, he will remain in the center, which has 84 cells, and locked up with 37 other detainees from the 1990 Balkan wars. Each cell (5.1 meters by 3 meters - 17 by 10 feet) has a shower, toilet, wash basin, and desk. Inmates enjoy computers (without Internet access), television channels, and have arts, languages, or sciences courses. Gym, outdoor courtyard, library, recreation room for darts, table tennis and board games are shared. After conviction, however, they serve sentences in countries that have volunteered to imprison them. Karad≈æiƒá will appear before Judge Alphons Orie, in the tribunal, which has sentenced 56 accused since 1993.  The case before ICTY  Karad≈æiƒá is facing charges on 11 counts for genocide, crimes against humanity and severe breaches of the Geneva Convention for his role in the 1992-1995 Bosnian war, especially for the Srebrenica massacre of July 1995. Consolidating two 1995 indictments into one single document, the current indictment against Karad≈æiƒá (IT-95-5/18) was confirmed on 31 May 2000. Specifically, it includes one count of a grave breach of the Geneva conventions of 1949, three counts of violations of the laws or customs of war, two counts of genocide and five counts of crimes against humanity.ICFY case information sheet Karad≈æiƒá announced he will represent himself during the trial.time.com 29 July 2008. If convicted, his sentence could be the longest pronounced by the court, exceeding 40 years, which in practice amounts to a life sentence. Karad≈æiƒá is expected to be tried before a three-judge panel in an open court with a tape-delayed feed; proceedings will be in English with Serbian translation.NYT 24 July 2008 Judge Alphons Orie (Netherlands) was designated to hold a first interview with Karad≈æiƒá on 31 July, with the purpose of establishing whether he understands the charges leveled against him. Orie will also present a first opportunity to Karad≈æiƒá to plead \\"guilty\\" or \\"not guilty\\" to each of the 11 counts. Karad≈æiƒá will be free to delay his plea for 30 days, after which, \\"not guilty\\" will automatically be entered on his behalf in the absence of a \\"guilty\\" plea. He claimed there is a conspiracy against him and refused to enter a plea, therefore the court entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf to all 11 charges. He dismissed the tribunal chaired by Scottish judge Iain Bonomy, as a \\"court of NATO\\" disguised as a court of the international community. Karadzic insists on defending himself (as he is entitled to under the United Nations court's rules) while at the same time is setting up a team of advisers led by his Legal Advisor Peter Robinson of the United States. Judge Bonomy urged Karad≈æiƒá to hire an attorney and set 20 January as a tentative date for a new status conference.\\"Karadzic says defence 'not ready'.\\" Al Jazeera English On 3 September 2010, judges warned that Karad≈æiƒá's trial could take two years longer than expected and stretch into 2014 if prosecutors and Karad≈æiƒá do not speed up the case. On 14 February 2016, the ICTY announced that the judgement in the case will be rendered on 24 March 2016. = Alleged Karad≈æiƒá-Holbrooke deal = On 31 July 2008, a summary of the charges were read out in court. Karad≈æiƒá delayed his plea until 29 August 2008, due to the fact that an amended indictment is being prepared. Karad≈æiƒá said he will enter his plea to the charges on 29 August. During his first hearing, Karad≈æiƒá stated that Madeleine Albright, along with Richard Holbrooke, offered him a deal which would allow him not to be prosecuted for war crimes if he would disappear from public life and politics. According to Karad≈æiƒá, Albright offered him to get out of the way and go to Russia, Greece, or Serbia and open a private clinic or to at least go to Bijeljina in northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. He also said that Holbrooke or Albright would like to see him disappear and expressed the fear for his life by saying \\"I do not know how long the arm of Mr Holbrooke or Mrs Albright is...or whether that arm can reach me here\\". Richard Holbrooke denied such claims, calling them lies in a Spiegel interview shortly after Karadzic's arrest, but Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnian foreign minister at the time, said that a Karad≈æiƒá-Holbrooke deal that was made in July 1996 was indeed in existence, and former Bosnian Serb foreign minister Aleksa Buha claimed that he witnessed the agreement which was made during the night between 18 and 19 July 1996. Claims of such a deal were also investigated by journalists before the capture and trial of Karad≈æiƒá. After the allegations were broadcast internationally, the Serbian newspaper Blic claimed that Karad≈æiƒá was under U.S. protection in exchange for him keeping a low profile and not participating in politics, quoting a \\"U.S. intelligence source\\" as saying that the protection ended in 2000 when the CIA intercepted a phone call of Karad≈æiƒá in which it became apparent that Karad≈æiƒá chaired a meeting of his old political party. Greek newspaper Kathimerini reported on 6 August 2008, that according to a Serbian newspaper, a former court official wrote a book claiming that the United States and other Western states had a deal with Karad≈æiƒá, protected him from arrest, and a U.S. diplomat told Karadzic that he could hide in a NATO base.Kathimerini article (in Greek) =Motion to disqualify= In a 15 August 2008 letter to Fausto Pocar, president of The Hague tribunal, Karad≈æiƒá moved to disqualify and replace presiding Dutch judge Alphons Orie, on the ground of \\"personal\\" interest and bias to convict him in order to reinforce and justify \\"draconian\\" sentences in his earlier ICTY cases against former Bosnian Serbs leaders: \\"There clearly cannot be any question of impartiality on his [Judge Orie's] part. He would now be keen on having that ruling \\"upheld and somehow validated, which could be achieved through, inter alia, partial and biased conduct of the case against me\\". Karad≈æiƒá also asked the other judges of Orie's chamber replaced. Preliminary investigations of tribunal cases are conducted by a judge, but trials are heard by a panel of three. The tribunal has no juries. The Hague tribunal president, Fausto Pocar, replaced the whole judge panel on 21 August 2008. The new presiding judge will be Patrick Lipton Robinson. =Wiretaps= In 2009, the prosecution presented recorded calls and transcripts of Karad≈æiƒá's political speeches. In one Karad≈æiƒá is quoted as saying \\"Sarajevo will be a black cauldron where Muslims will die,\\" and that \\"They will disappear, that people will disappear from the face of the earth.\\" In another Karad≈æiƒá is quoted as saying that \\"Europe will be told to go fuck itself and not come back till the job is finished.\\" =Hearings= The prosecution started its case on 13 April 2010, and completed it on 25 May 2012. The discovery of more than 300 previously unknown bodies in a mass grave at the Toma≈°ica mine near Prijedor in September 2013 caused a flurry of motions which ended with the court denying reopening prosecutorial evidence. The defence began its case on 16 October 2012 and completed it in March 2014; Karad≈æiƒá decided not to testify.

Created by Merrill Heatter (who also produced the show's predecessor Gambit), the series follows three contestants as they play a card game centered on blackjack and trivia. The show is based on a popular online game from GSN's website and aired for four seasons from 2008 to 2011. It was hosted by Alfonso Ribeiro, with actress Mikki Padilla serving as the card dealer. The show received positive critical reception as a whole, the series itself was hailed as \\"a fun game with a solid concept\\" while Ribeiro was praised as \\"hands-down, one of the best game show hosts out there.\\" Additionally, the series was acquired by Bounce TV in 2013, with the network hopeful it could \\"add fuel\\" to the channel's growing momentum. GSN revived the series on October 14, 2019, with Ribeiro returning to host and Witney Carson as the card dealer. Gameplay=Main game=2008 version Three contestants are each given a card to start a blackjack hand from a standard 52-card deck shuffled prior to taping. The host reads questions and the first contestant to answer correctly is dealt a card. The contestant who answers correctly can freeze their hand, preventing them from receiving additional cards or reveal the next card from the top of the deck. After revealing the card, the contestant can either accept it for themselves or pass it to one of their opponents who has not yet frozen. If keeping a card, the contestant in control is given another chance to freeze. However, once a contestant has frozen, the remaining contestants must freeze at a score higher than that contestant, ties are not permitted. A contestant is eliminated from the round if their hand exceeds 21. The process is repeated with additional questions and cards until two contestants have frozen or busted. A contestant whose score reaches 21 exactly instantly wins the round. Beginning in season two of the original series, a bonus prize is given to the contestant regardless of the outcome of the game. If two contestants bust, the remaining contestant automatically wins the round. If only one contestant has not yet frozen or busted, no additional questions are asked; the remaining contestant continues drawing cards until either beating the highest frozen hand or busting. The winner of the round receives a power chip to use in the bonus round, assuming that contestant gets that far. The original series used point scores in the first two rounds, with 100 points awarded for a correct answer, and 500 points for winning the hand. After two rounds, the contestant with the lowest score is eliminated. If there is a tie for the lowest score, the players involved participate in a high-card draw. Each player is given the choice of taking the first or second card off the top of the deck, without being able to see either card before making their selection. The player who draws the higher card advances. The two remaining contestants play one more round involving the same toss-up question format, but point scores are not kept. The contestant who wins the round receives $1,000 and two additional power chips (originally one), then moves on to the bonus round. 2019 revival The 2019 revival changed several rules: * Other than the cards, there is no point scoring in any round. * There is no longer a bonus prize for the first 21. * If two different players win the first two hands, those two players play the third round, the third player is eliminated. If the same player wins the first two hands, a tiebreaker is played between the other two players. * In the tiebreaker (\\"High Card Playoff\\"), an additional trivia question is played. The player who answers correctly is shown the top card from the deck and chooses whether to take that card or pass it to their opponent and take the next card from the deck. The other player is given the second card, the higher card wins. (If there is a tie, an additional question is played). * Winning the final round gives the player their required number of power chips based on the hand or hands they have won. On some episodes, the player is given an additional chip for winning the match. =Bonus round= The winner now controls three separate hands, each staked with one card. A new deck of 52 cards that has been shuffled and cut is used. Cards are drawn for the contestant, one at a time and the contestant then chooses a hand in which to place each card. The contestant can use a power chip to dispose of an unwanted card. If the contestant is in danger of busting on any hand, the contestant can end the round after successfully placing a card, a contestant cannot stop immediately after playing a power chip. Getting 21 in one hand wins $1,000, in two hands wins $5,000, and if 21 is scored on all three hands, the contestant wins the grand prize of $25,000. If the contestant busts on any one of the three hands, they will lose everything except the $1,000 that the winner received earlier. On some episodes in season two, the top prize was increased to $50,000 with the other payouts remaining the same. The 2019 revival has altered the payout structure to a 21 on one hand awarding $2,500, $5,000 for two, and $25,000 for all three. The total with $1,000 from the Main Game are $3,500 for one hand, $6,000 for two hands, and $26,000 for all three hands. =Online game= The television version of the game was based on a popular online version from GSN's website. In this version, the online player has five minutes to make as many hands of 21 as they can using four columns. The player can play a card in any of their columns as long as the subsequent total is 21 or less. If the card cannot be played in any column, it must be discarded. Each hand of 21 earns the player 50 points. Playing exactly five cards in a column earns the player a 50 point bonus (called a \\"5-Card Charlie\\"), making that column worth a total of 100 points. Additionally, the jacks of spades and clubs allow any column to be cleared immediately for 75 points (called a \\"Blackjack Attack\\"). Production The series featured executive producers Scott Sternberg and Merrill Heatter, and premiered on July 21, 2008. The first season consisted of 40 half-hour episodes. Prior to the show's premiere, a 30-minute documentary The Making of a Game Show: Catch 21 aired on GSN, featuring exclusive footage and interviews with production staff and Ribeiro. The name of the show is inspired by Catch-22, a phrase describing a paradox that cannot be avoided due to limits or a rules contradiction. On February 18, 2009, GSN renewed the series for a 65-episode second season on April 6, 2009, which featured the addition of an extra power chip in the bonus round in order to increase contestant's chances of winning the top prize. A third season, which was announced on September 16, 2009, debuted on October 12, 2009, with some episodes featuring celebrities with a common bond (such as three The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air cast members or three former child stars) playing for charity. The show's fourth and final season debuted on August 16, 2010. On March 21, 2019, Adweek reported that GSN would revive Catch 21, producing new episodes for the first time in nearly a decade. Ribeiro was chosen to return as host, Padilla, however, would not return and would be replaced with dancer Witney Carson. The change reunited Ribeiro and Carson, who had previously been partners‚Äîand champions‚Äîon season nineteen of Dancing with the Stars. Contestants cast for the revival were all current Las Vegas residents, which is where the show is filmed. The revival filmed its episodes in July and August, and premiered on GSN on October 14, 2019. Reception Critical reception for Catch 21 was generally positive. Carrie Grosvenor of About Entertainment argued that the series was \\"a fun game with a solid concept. It's definitely worth checking out.\\" Hollywood Junket also praised Ribeiro, calling him \\"hands-down, one of the best game show hosts out there... the fun, brother/sister type chemistry between himself and (Padilla) is rare and benefits the show greatly.\\" Additionally, Bounce TV expressed excitement when announcing their acquisition of the series in 2013, citing the series' popularity among GSN viewers and consistent ratings growth during its original run. The network's chief operating officer Jonathan Katz commented, \\"We are very confident that the broadcast premieres of The American Bible Challenge and Catch 21 will add fuel to Bounce TV's skyrocketing growth.\\" The revival's October 14, 2019 premiere earned 459,000 total viewers with a 0.04 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic.

It is four weeks long, and moves to a different location each year. MathPath is visited by mathematicians such as John H. Conway and Francis Su. It was probably the original, and is still one of the few, international residential high-end summer camps exclusively for mathematics and exclusively for students of middle school age.  History  MathPath was founded in 2002 by George Rubin Thomas, who had previously founded Mathcamp for high school students and has since founded Epsilon Camp for children age 7‚Äì11 (in 2011, originally aged 8-11) and Delta Camp for children 6 and 7 (in 2014 and 2015, now merged with Epsilon Camp). His goal was to inspire and advance the most mathematically gifted middle school age students, through a summer camp.  Subjects  At MathPath, students learn about many math topics that are rarely taught in American schools, or taught in much depth, such as non-Euclidean geometry, advanced Euclidean geometry, number theory, combinatorics, induction, spherical trigonometry, mathematical origami, and the mathematics of card shuffling. They also learn some history of math and work on mathematical writing. Topics vary somewhat each year, depending on instructor interest. As well, students have the opportunity to prepare for contests such as MATHCOUNTS, AMC, or AIME.  Staff  Some staff are regular annual participants. Usually they come for 2‚Äì4 weeks, but a few come for only one week. Notable regular staff include the late John Horton Conway, Sam Vandervelde, and Glen Van Brummelen. Visiting staff are participants for one year or occasional years. Usually they attend for one week, or for a day or two to give a few lectures. Often they are faculty at the host institution or nearby institutions. Notable visiting staff include Gene Abrams and Robin Hartshorne.  Admissions  MathPath is selective. The primary criterion for admission is the applicant's work on the yearly Qualifying Test, though academic and nonacademic references are also required.

The new airport would supplement or replace the city's existing Kingsford Smith Airport. Governments had debated the issue since the 1940s, but for decades had not pursued anything beyond preliminary investigations and precautionary land acquisition. The debate was settled in the 2010s when a site at Badgerys Creek was selected. With an estimated cost of between $6 and $8 billion, construction of the airport began in September 2018 and will be completed in 2026. Since the construction of Kingsford Smith, aviation in Sydney has grown significantly. Between 1985 and 2015 total passenger movements through Sydney more than quadrupled from 9.2 million to 39.8 million. In 2015, 21% of all scheduled flights in Australia landed or took off at Kingsford Smith. The airport dealt with 45% of international passengers in 1998. The Federal government made preliminary investigations and purchased land near Badgerys Creek in the 1980s and early 1990s. In May 2013, the Gillard Government released a technical study into the feasibility of Wilton as an airport site. By the time of the 2013 election, the Australian Labor Party had expressed support for the concept of a second airport, but did not support any particular site, whereas the then-Opposition Coalition was split on the issue, with some ministerial support for an airport at Badgerys Creek site while the then-Opposition Leader Tony Abbott had not committed to constructing an airport at all. The second airport was also opposed by the state government of New South Wales, which instead favoured increasing capacity at Kingsford Smith and building a high-speed rail connection between Sydney and Canberra Airport, although doubt had been cast on the viability of the latter option by a study in 2012. After a further study, on 15 April 2014 the Federal government confirmed that the second Sydney airport will be built at Badgerys Creek, as the Western Sydney Airport. In May 2017 the Federal Government announced it would build (pay for) the second Sydney Airport, after the Sydney Airport Group declined the Government's offer to build the second airport, and announced an investment of $5.3 billion in the project over four years in the 2017‚Äì18 Budget. History In 1962 the state parliament debated the need for a second airport. It was decided that it should be built because Kingsford Smith had little room to expand. However the need was not urgent and it was decided to defer the planning and construction for at least 10 years. A new government body, the State Planning Authority (SPA) was created to oversee the future development of the region. The SPA had the primary task of planning the development of the new airport and the development of housing sites in the Western Sydney area to suit the growth of Sydney as the major city in Australia. The SPA created a \\"no development zone\\" around the Badgerys Creek area in 1964 that would last for 20 years. This would give the government time to plan the airport and the infrastructure for it. This included roads and rail, and flight paths. Sydney was growing fast. Without the SPA, the area would have been subdivided and redeveloped and the airport would have cost far more to build. There was a strong reaction from farmers who owned land in Badgerys Creek. Some wanted to subdivide and take a profit; some wanted to stay and farm the land. Every change of government saw a change to the airport planning and further delays while the politicians tried to buy the now valuable land at a low price and dislodge those who could remember back to 1962 and could see a huge profit from holding out. Around Badgerys Creek 20-litre paint tin lids with crude messages for the SPA were nailed to trees and power poles. These messages stayed until they rusted away and fell off, some lasting 20 years. The planning for second airports in Melbourne and Sydney started at the same time, but Melbourne opened its airport in 1970. At the time of the original planning, the Badgerys Creek flight paths were over farm land to the south and over the sparsely populated suburb of Doonside to the north. Aircraft noise would not have been a problem and land would have been marked as Aircraft noise affected, had the plans been revealed. = 1946‚Äì1969: Towra Point proposal = In 1946, Towra Point in the south of Botany Bay was considered as a site for a second airport. Arthur Gietzelt, a member of Sutherland Shire Council, opposed the proposition, and in March 1969, the then Prime Minister (John Gorton) ruled out Towra Point as a potential site for a second airport, citing community noise problems. In 1973, the then Minister for Transport accused Gorton of ruling out Towra Point as a site to sweeten his chances at the 1969 election. = 1970s ‚Äì 1986: MANS Study = Planning for a second airport for Sydney commenced in the 1970s with the Major Airport Needs of Sydney (MANS) intergovernmental group established to select a site. In 1983 the newly elected Labor Federal Government hoped for quick decision, but it was not until 1986 that recommendations were made: Wilton or Badgerys Creek. The federal government under Bob Hawke decided upon Badgerys Creek, but in 1989 it also made the decision to permit the construction of the third runway at Kingsford Smith. This resulted in a great deal of political fallout, and the Keating Government made limited moves towards the new airport at Badgerys Creek. = 1999: First Badgerys Creek proposal = At the 1996 election, then Australian Prime Minister John Howard announced that he would explore the option of a second airport at Holsworthy, but that option was rejected in 1998 and Badgerys Creek was confirmed as the preferred site in 1999. Commentators doubted if a major second airport for Sydney would ever be built, with a report given to the government in 1999 recommending that regional air travel be shifted to Bankstown Airport, a new general aviation airport be built at Badgerys Creek, a fast train between Sydney and Canberra be established, and investigation made on extension of the fast train to Melbourne and Brisbane. = 2000: Stalled = In December 2000 the Federal Government decided not to build the second airport and also shelved the very fast train scoping study, while keeping regional airlines at Kingsford Smith and expanding Bankstown and Canberra airports. In December 2003 John Anderson, the then transport minister, said \\"following exhaustive examination it is clear the existing airport at Mascot will be able to handle air traffic demands for a long time to come\\". = 2004‚Äì08: More studies = In May 2004 it was revealed that State and Federal parliaments had investigated the possibility of establishing the second Sydney airport at Well's Creek, not far from the townships of Sutton Forest, Berrima and Exeter. Before long however this option was discounted. The issue arose again in 2008, following the 2007 election of the Rudd Government. Convinced that capacity at the current airport would be exhausted, it began a search for a new site. The Federal Government wanted the second airport to be outside the Sydney basin and said it would examine alternatives from the Southern Highlands, to Newcastle and inland. Various options, including a freight-only airport operation, Camden, or converting part or all of RAAF Richmond and Canberra (or its nearby towns) as passenger and freight terminals were to be investigated for feasibility. Bankstown and Badgerys Creek, according to sources, were not to be included. = 2009: Canberra Airport proposal = In 2009, Canberra Airport management proposed that its facility would be the most appropriate location for a second Sydney airport, provided that a high-speed rail link (HSR) was built that reduced travel times between the cities to 50 minutes. Given existing development within the Sydney basin, a HSR link would probably be required whatever site is chosen, yet the Canberra option would potentially be cheaper overall. Existing infrastructure, such as the runways, terminals and navigational aids, would negate the need to develop a greenfields airport site. The estimated cost (in 2009) of the Sydney-to-Canberra link was 8 billion to $10 billion. = 2009‚Äì12: Joint Federal/NSW Government Study = On Friday 2 March 2012 then Federal Transport Minister Anthony Albanese released a 3,200 page joint report costing $8m into Sydney's aviation capacity needs. Commissioned by the minister in 2009, the report was prepared by both state and federal bureaucrats, and private sector representatives. It examined 34 potential airport sites. The study's major finding was that Badgerys Creek was \\"clearly the best site for a much-needed second airport for Sydney\\", describing the area as \\"the logical and most cost-effective site for another airport\\" The report also \\"calls for planning to begin on a second airport at Badgerys Creek\\" Badgerys' has been recommended by planners as an airport site since 1979, where 1700ha of land was acquired from 1986 to 1991 for an international airport, but had been rejected by both Labor and the Liberal- National party coalition politicians. The full report: http://westernsydneyairport.gov.au/sydney_av_cap/files/sydney_aviation_capacity.pdf  Full capacity by 2027  Sydney Airport is struggling to accommodate the demand for flights into and out of the city and, by 2027, the airport will not be able to accommodate any extra flights. The Sydney region passenger demand is forecast to more than double to 87 million passengers by 2035, and to double again by 2060. The study showed another airport was needed by 2030 if Sydney was to keep growing at current rates. The study said this would delay flights across the country.  Economic costs of inaction  * A $60 billion cost to the economy by 2060 due to capacity constraints.  Mascot upgrades  The study \\"advocates keeping the existing 11pm to 6am curfew for flights to Sydney's Mascot airport.\\" But it did recommend lifting the movement cap at Sydney Airport from 80 to 85 flights an hour. Albanese ruled out raising the movement cap. When releasing the document Albanese reiterated that the government would not build an airport at Badgerys Creek. Albanese instead said the government would begin planning studies for the second-best airport site, Wilton; which is considerably further to the south, along the Hume Motorway near Picton. The report said Wilton would probably not attract enough business to be viable before 2030.\\" The then NSW Premier, Barry O'Farrell, opposed a second airport in the Sydney basin, and revived that idea of using Canberra Airport, linked to Sydney by high-speed rail. NSW Minister for Transport, Gladys Berejiklian supported this, but the report stated that this option was not feasible.  New airport construction costs  Single- runway airport: * 1.7 billion for airport at Badgerys Creek or Wilton. $300m for transport links to Badgerys Creek and $2.3b for Wilton. Parallel-runway International airport: * A$5.3 billion for the airport. $1.7 billion for transport links to Badgerys Creek and A$5.7b for Wilton. ** International Terminal $1,812 million ** Domestic Terminal $583 million ** Runways and Taxiways $551 million ** Car parking $202 million ** Project management and design $707 million = 2013‚Äìpresent: Second Badgerys Creek proposal = In 2013 Bob Meyer, planner at Cox Richardson Architects, presented a report that said only 2,913 homes would be moderately impacted by aircraft noise if Badgerys Creek International Airport goes ahead. Most of the land surrounding the 17,000 hectare airport site is slated for industrial development, not residential, as part of the Western Sydney Employment Area. In February 2013 an alliance of Western Sydney councils (WSROC) reversed their position against an airport at Badgerys Creek, with a majority of members now supporting the site, citing economic value to the area. The Gillard Government further made clear it supported a second airport located in Sydney, but was awaiting a report due in March regarding the feasibility of their preferred Wilton location. While in Opposition, the Abbott-led Coalition did not commit to a position on that matter, but prominent shadow ministers, including Joe Hockey, voiced their support for an airport at Badgerys Creek. The NSW Government has remained firm in its opposition to any Sydney location, favouring spending infrastructure dollars on a high-speed rail link to Canberra. The Sydney Airport Corporation continues to claim Kingsford-Smith has sufficient capacity. In October 2013 The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that Treasurer Joe Hockey had nominated a second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek as one of the key infrastructure projects needed to stimulate the slowing Australian economy. The newspaper had earlier that month quoted Infrastructure Minister Warren Truss saying that \\"Badgerys Creek was chosen as the best site decades ago and is government-owned.\\" In response to this news, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Daily Telegraph both reported that Qantas supported the proposal for establishing a curfew-free airport at Badgerys Creek, with Qantas, Jetstar and Qatar Airways saying they would use a Badgerys Creek airport for commercial flights. In March 2014, the Sydney Morning Herald published a poll showing a 72% of NSW voters wanted an airport at Badgerys Creek. On 15 April 2014, the Federal Government announced that Badgerys Creek will be the site of the Second Sydney Airport. (See Western Sydney Airport).  Cost and Design  After the confirmation of Badgerys Creek as the site for Sydney's Second Airport, some Western Sydney residents and local politicians started voicing their opposition to a 24-hour airport. The reaction of most residents in the local area is more towards negative on the subject of the airport in their area. In response, the Federal Government has focused on new jobs and new infrastructure investments including: * $1.25b to build a new motorway from the Northern Road to the M7 * $1.6b to upgrade the Northern road to four lanes from Narellan to the M4 * $500m to upgrade the Bringelly Road to four lanes from the Northern road to Camden Valley Way * New interchanges at Northern Road and Elizabeth Drive * Link the M4 with the new airport at Badgerys Creek The new airport was first proposed as a cargo only facility. One of the negative reactions at that time was that the runway pointed directly at Sydney water stored by Warragamba dam, not far from the dam. The orientation of the runway does not appear to have been changed. If not, this may still be an unaddressed negative because it was calculated at the time that 9 tonnes of aircraft fuel waste per week would potentially be released over the stored water. Critics however point out that this investment will simply route new traffic on to the already clogged M4, M7 and M5 complicating the commute of Western Sydney residents even further. Second Sydney airport ‚Äî timeline of Commonwealth Government preferred sites * On 28 August 1973 the Minister for Transport Charlie Jones announced that Galston had been chosen by the Australian Government to meet Sydney's airport needs for the 1980s. * On 17 February 1986 the Minister for Aviation Peter Morris announced that a second Sydney airport would be built at Badgerys Creek. The Government spent $170 million acquiring land and developing the Badgerys Creek site over the following decade. * In 1997 the Howard Government rejected an airport site at Holsworthy army camp, having spent $8 million investigating the location. * On 14 May 2002 the Minister for Transport and Regional Services John Anderson told the Parliament that Government had concluded that Kingsford Smith Airport would be able to handle air traffic demand over the next decade, and that Bankstown Airport would be made available for any overflow traffic. * On 27 July 2003 Simon Crean announced that Badgerys Creek was no longer a suitable site for Sydney's second airport and that a Labor Government would not build an airport at the site. * In 2012‚Äì13, at the end of their term in government, the Australian Labor Party's preferred site for a second airport was Wilton. * In 2014 Prime Minister Tony Abbott confirmed that the Commonwealth government would proceed with Badgerys Creek as the site of Sydney's second airport with costings to be undertaken during their first term budgets. * In September 2018, construction works began at the Badgerys Creek Airport site.

With a huge supporter base, the club was originally known as Wollongong United Soccer Club. Since then it has also been known as Wollongong Macedonia, as represented in the National Soccer League (NSL) 1990. Upon entering the Premier League in the Illawarra Second division, the club quickly advanced in 1980 to enter the NSW Second division, finishing second at season end on its first attempt. In 1986, the club reached the top competition in NSW Division 1, today known as NSW National Premier League. Wollongong United F.C completed the season undefeated, to this day, the only club in NSW to do so (Except for Eastern Suburbs Hakoah in 1971 and Croatia Sydney in 1981). In 1990 the club claim their first title in NSW Division 1 History, This success led the club to the pinnacle of Australian soccer. =Post-NSL= Between 1991 and 2004, the club played in the NSW State League with a strong, consistent representation in both junior and senior ranks. In 2004 the club evaluated its position and it was deemed, in the best interests of the club, its members, supporters and sponsors to return to the local Illawarra Football Association. In 2005, the club competed in the IFA First Division with an aim to return to the IFA Premier League. Wollongong United finished second and gained promotion into the Premier League for the 2006 season.

This was to be done in such a way that the fundamental theorem of calculus would apply analogously to the theorem in one dimension, with as few preconditions on the function under consideration as possible. The integral also permits analogues of the chain rule and other theorems of the integral calculus for higher dimensions. Definition The construction is based on the Henstock or gauge integral, however Pfeffer proved that the integral, at least in the one dimensional case, is less general than the Henstock integral. It relies on what Pfeffer refers to as a set of bounded variation, this is equivalent to a Caccioppoli set. The Riemann sums of the Pfeffer integral are taken over partitions made up of such sets, rather than intervals as in the Riemann or Henstock integrals. A gauge is used, exactly as in the Henstock integral, except that the gauge function may be zero on a negligible set. Properties Pfeffer defined a notion of generalized absolute continuity ACG^*, close to but not equal to the definition of a function being ACG_*, and proved that a function is Pfeffer integrable if it is the derivative of an ACG^* function. He also proved a chain rule for the Pfeffer integral. In one dimension his work as well as similarities between the Pfeffer integral and the McShane integral indicate that the integral is more general than the Lebesgue integral and yet less general than the Henstock‚ÄìKurzweil integral.

Produced by Prometheus Entertainment in a documentary style, the program presents hypotheses of ancient astronauts and proposes that historical texts, archaeology, and legends contain evidence of past human-extraterrestrial contact. The show has been widely criticized by historians, cosmologists, archaeologists and other scientific circles for presenting and promoting pseudoscience, pseudohistory and pseudoarchaeology. The series started with a TV special of the same name that aired on March 8, 2009, on the History channel. Seasons 1‚Äì3 aired on the same channel until 2011. From season 4 to the middle of season 7, the series aired on H2. On April 10, 2015, episode premieres returned to History channel. Season 15 premiered on January 24, 2020. Production The executive producer of Ancient Aliens is Kevin Burns, who also directed and wrote the pilot episode. Giorgio A. Tsoukalos serves as consulting producer and appeared on screen in the pilot. Erich von D√§niken appeared in the pilot episode, and UFO researcher C. Scott Littleton served as an expert consultant for the show until his death in 2010. Radio talk show host George Noory speaks in over forty episodes, including the pilot. Reverend Barry Downing, known for describing angels in the Bible as ancient astronauts, offered his viewpoints in the pilot episode.

It was directed by Jens Lien after a script by St√•le Stein Berg. The music was composed by the band Calexico. The plot is a drama-comedy from the Norwegian countryside, where the protagonist Jonny Vang is frustrated in his efforts to prosper as a breeder of earthworms. The film was reasonably well received by critics, and was awarded an Amanda Award for \\"Best Actor\\" in 2003. Plot Jonny Vang (Aksel Hennie) lives on the Norwegian countryside, where he is trying to establish a business breeding earthworms. His ambitions to expand are thwarted by the bank manager (Trond Br√¶nne), who will not lend him the necessary money. He lives with his mother Brita (Marit Andreassen) and her difficult friend Odvar (Bj√∏rn Sundquist). On top of all of this, he is also carrying out an affair with Tuva (Laila Goody)the wife of his best friend Magnus (Fridtjov S√•heim). Things get even worse when an unknown assailant knocks him over the head with a shovel.

Lien had previously established himself as a director of television advertisements. He had also been represented twice at the Cannes International Film Festival, with short films. He described the film as \\"a drama comedy, a juicy story, life, lust and rock 'n' roll. It's a dead serious comedy.\\" Lien originally considered Hennie too young for the role, but the actor was persistent, and finally persuaded the director that he was the right man for the part. The movie, where the story takes place in Gudbrandsdalen, was filmed in the town of F√•vang. To get Calexico's permission to use their music in the film, Lien had to travel to the U.S. in person. He brought with him an unfinished version of the film, but the only place where he could play the VHS tape was at a nearby rental store, where 30 customers joined the band and the director, who had to simultaneously translate the plot. The music is a mix of traditional American and Mexican music, and is gathered from the band's albums Spoke (1997), The Black Light (1998) and Hot Rail (2000).  Reception  Jonny Vang was reasonably well received by the Norwegian press. The newspaper Dagbladet gave the film four out of six points, and commended it for good scenes, yet found it somewhat predictable. The reviewer mentioned Calexico's soundtrack as one of the best parts of the movie. Aftenposten's Per Haddal awarded five out of six points, and believed the movie was a well functional comedy. Also Haddal commended the choice of music. International reviewers were less enthusiastic. Variety complimented the actors' performances, but found that the movie did not \\"have a great deal of drive or momentum\\". The reviewer at the Swedish website \\"DVD forum\\" jokingly said that he laughed often, so he hoped it was a comedy. Generally content with the movie, he found Hennie's performance somewhat \\"theatrical\\". Aksel Hennie was awarded an Amanda Award for \\"Best Actor\\" for his effort in the film in 2003. The movie was also nominated in the category \\"Best Film\\", but lost out to Bent Hamer's Salmer fra kj√∏kkenet. Hennie also won the \\"Best Actor\\" award at the Brussels European Film Festival.

Azurin moderates single- electron transfer between enzymes associated with the cytochrome chain by undergoing oxidation-reduction between Cu(I) and Cu(II). Each monomer of an azurin tetramer has a molecular weight of approximately 14kDa, contains a single copper atom, is intensively blue, and has a fluorescence emission band centered at 308 nm. Azurins and pseudoazurins participate in the denitrification processes in bacteria., including the gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, by interacting with cytochrome c551. Azurin from P aeruginosa is a type I blue copper protein (cupredoxin), while cytochrome c551 (9 kDa) is a haem-containing cytochrome. Azurin possesses a relatively large hydrophobic patch close to the active site, and two residues in this hydrophobic patch, Met-44 and Met-64, are believed to be involved in its interaction with the redox partners cytochrome c551 and nitrite reductase. Although unrelated to its electron-transfer property, azurin has been found to have anticancer properties through its interaction with tumor-suppressor protein p53.  Enzyme mechanism  In its oxidized form, azurin (Cu2+Az) receives an electron from its redox partner and is reduced according to the following reaction: Cu2+Az + e‚àí -> Cu+Az The redox potential is 310 mV. The highly-interconnected beta-sheet structure of azurin is strongly coupled with its electron-transfer center (the copper-binding side). Considerable experimental evidence exists to suggest that hydrogen bonds play a role in the long-distance electron transfer mechanism of azurin. Taken together, these observations suggest that electrons tunnel through the enzyme along its polypeptide and hydrogen bonds, making azurin is a useful model system for studying long-range, intraprotein electron transfer (LRET).  Enzyme structure  The copper binding domain of azurin rendered in PyMol, with four of the five copper-binding ligands labeled. The distance (in angstroms) from the copper atom to each individual ligand has been recorded. Azurin is a tetrameric protein. Each monomer weighs approximately 14kDa and is composed of 128 amino acids forming eight beta-strands arranged in a beta-barrel formation. The strands are connected by turns and a single alpha-helical insertion. A single-atom copper binding site is located about 7A below each monomer‚Äôs surface towards its northern end; the copper atom that inhabits it is coordinated by five ligands surrounded by an extensive hydrophobic patch. The three equatorial copper ligands are composed of a thiolate (Cys112) and two imidazoles (His46, His 117), and the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Gly45 and Met121 serve as the two weak axial ligands. With the exception of Gly45, the copper-binding configuration above is common to the structures of all blue type 1 copper-binding proteins determined thus far. Once coordinated, the ligand-metal complex assumes a distorted, trigonal bi-pyramidal geometry that stabilizes the cuprous (Cu(I)) reduced state of the protein relative to the cupric (Cu(II)) oxidized state. Structurally imposed backbonding between the copper d orbitals and its ligand p orbitals may further stabilize the cuprous state. Existing structural information about azurin has largely been derived from X-ray crystallography studies of single-site mutated forms of the protein. Notable structural features elucidated by crystallography include the beta-sandwich motif formed from eight interlocking beta strands, as well as an alpha-helical segment outside the barrel linking beta-sheets 4 and 5. Although the Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox potential is typically higher for azurin than most other copper complexes, structural studies in which Met121 (one of azurin‚Äôs equatorial copper-coordinating ligands) is replaced have demonstrated that the absence of a thiolate copper ligand does not preclude high reduction potentials, as large hydrophobic residues in position 121 also raise the redox potential of the copper atom. Thus, the higher redox potentials have been attributed to the exclusion of water from the metal-binding site, a condition augmented by the presence of bulky hydrophobic residues. Conversely, negatively charged residues lower the redox potential, since they stabilize the more positively charged cupric form of the copper ion.  Biological function  When expressed in nitrogen-fixing organisms, azurin serves as the electron donor to nitrite reductase, an enzyme in the denitrification pathway of the nitrogen cycle. Azurins support oxidative deamination of primary amines by passing electrons from aromatic amine dehydrogenase to cytochrome oxidase, as well as from some c-type cytochromes to nitrite reductases.  Disease relevance  Azurin has garnered significant attention as a potential therapeutic for various diseases, including cancer. In vivo, it has been demonstrated to induce regression of human melanoma and breast cancer tissue with minimal toxic effects to the organism. Azurin enters preferentially into cancer cells via the p28 domain of the enzyme, which roughly corresponds to the extended alpha-helical region of the enzyme. In cancer cells, azurin complexes with p53, stabilizing it and preventing association with E3 uiquitin ligases, which would otherwise bind and mark the protein for destruction. Four azurin molecules bind each p53 monomer with high affinity. The p53/azurin complex travels to the nucleus, where p53 upregulates the transcription of proapoptotic genes Bax and Noxa. P53 also activates the expression of cell- cycle inhibitors, preventing tumor cells from progressing beyond the G1 or S phase. Although this pathway plays a significant role in azurin‚Äôs anticancer activity, the details of the interaction between azurin and p53 are not well understood. A phase I clinical trial in the United States demonstrated both partial and complete tumor regression effects in fifteen stage IV cancer patients treated with the p28 amino-acid fragment of azurin. Another phase I trial with the p28 fragment demonstrated azurin‚Äôs therapeutic effects against pediatric patients with brain tumors; subsequently, the USFDA approved the designation of p28 as an orphan drug for glioma. Azurin‚Äôs other domains may also exhibit strong anticancer activity by binding to cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases such as EphB2 receptors, which induce angiogenesis in cancer cells. This is another mechanism by which azurin has been proposed to exhibit its therapeutic effects.

She was constructed in Seattle, Washington; however, she spent most of her working career on the U.S. East Coast, primarily at Norfolk, Virginia, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Launched in Seattle, Washington The name Arapaho (sometimes spelled Arapahoe) was assigned on 9 May 1914 to a tug that had been laid down unnamed on 16 December 1913 at Seattle, Washington, by the Seattle Construction and Drydock Company. Launched on 20 June 1914, Arapaho was delivered to the Navy on 2 December 1914. Placed in an \\"in service\\" status as befitting a yard craft, Arapaho performed tug and tow duty at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California through 1917. Classified as a fleet tug on 15 December 1915, the ship was commissioned on 8 February 1918 at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Lieutenant A. R. Hunter, USNRF, in command. World War I service Ordered to the Atlantic Fleet, Arapaho departed Mare Island, California on 25 February 1918 and, after transiting the Panama Canal, reached Norfolk, Virginia on 6 April. The tug operated with the Atlantic Fleet, primarily out of Norfolk, Virginia, through the armistice of 11 November. Assigned to the Atlantic Fleet Train, Arapaho towed target rafts and barges and performed routine mooring buoy maintenance at Hampton Roads, Virginia, and occasionally ranged with the fleet to Guantanamo and Guayancanabo Bays, Cuba, and Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. Post-war service During the fleet movement to Guantanamo in January 1920, Arapaho ‚Äî in company with the minesweepers , , , and ‚Äî towed target rafts and barges to Guantanamo for the fleet's use during the annual winter maneuvers there. Although detached from the Train on 1 January 1920, Arapaho was apparently not assigned to the 4th Naval District (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) until 29 February. During the first year of operations out of her new home port and yard, she was classified as AT-14 during the fleet-wide assignment of alphanumeric hull numbers on 17 July. That autumn, in company with , she laid out a torpedo range from 19 October-1 November in the lower Potomac River. Upon completion of this duty, Arapaho returned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard for a resumption of her previous duties. Decommissioning Arapaho remained assigned to the 4th Naval District until decommissioned at Philadelphia on the afternoon of 6 April 1922. She remained in reserve there‚Äîreclassified, while inactive, as a yard tug YT-121 on 27 February 1936 ‚Äî until struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 22 December. Two days later, Arapaho was ordered to be sold, and she was eventually purchased by A. S. Hughes' Sons, Philadelphia on 5 May 1937.

He represented Eastern MƒÅori in the House of Representatives from 1884 to 1887, and again from 1893 to 1905. Pere's strong criticism of the government's MƒÅori land policies and his involvement in the turbulent land wars in the 1860s and 1870s made him a revered MƒÅori leader and he was known throughout his career as an contentious debator and outstanding orator in the use of the MƒÅori language. Biography Wi Pere was born in 1837 at T≈´ranga (Gisborne), the son of English Poverty Bay trader Thomas Halbert and esteemed MƒÅori Rƒ´ria Mauaranui of Te WhƒÅnau-a-Kai hap≈´ of Te Aitanga-a-MƒÅhaki and Rongowhakaata. Pere was baptised William Halbert but commonly went by his Maori name, Wiremu Pere (William Bell). From a young age Pere was noted for his shrewdness and identified by elders as having exceptional intelligence. He was raised largely under the tutelage of his mother and was schooled in tribal lore and genealogy by Te Aitanga-a-MƒÅhaki iwi elders of the Maraehinahina whare wƒÅnanga. This formed the basis of his authority in land dealings and Native Land Court proceedings from the 1870s. The local Anglican mission also identified Pere as an emerging leader, and he became a member of the first standing committee of the Diocese of Waiapu. In 1856, Pere married Arapera Matenga Toti at Waerenga-a-hika. Political career In 1865, as Pai Marire emissaries gained support in Poverty Bay and tensions grew amid local iwi, Wi Pere remained a government supporter and constant to his Anglican allegiance. However, despite this, he protested against the exile of Poverty Bay MƒÅori to the Chatham Islands, and strongly opposed the government's attempts to confiscate their land. Through his work in the Repudiation movement to support MƒÅori land owners, Pere became an important MƒÅori leader in the region and gained wide support in his first bid for Parliament in 1884. Pere attracted much attention when he won the Eastern MƒÅori seat in the 1884 general election. As the fourth representative for the electorate, Pere spoke strongly against the Native Land Court's actions of giving land title to individuals, believing land should be owned by hap≈´ (sub- tribes) or whƒÅnau (family). He also joined the Kotahitanga movement and supported its efforts to establish a separate MƒÅori Parliament. In both the 1887 and 1890 elections Pere lost the Eastern MƒÅori seat to James Carroll, who was opposed to the Kotahitanga separatist movement. When Carroll stood down in 1893 to contest the Gisborne (European) seat, Pere won Eastern Maori back as a member of the Liberal Party. He served a further four terms before losing the seat to ƒÄpirana Ngata in the 1905 general election. Pere was appointed to the Legislative Council on 22 January 1907, where he was effectively the only MƒÅori member. By this time Pere had become a strong empire loyalist. He offered to lead a MƒÅori contingency to the South African war of 1899‚Äì1902 and urged military training for all New Zealanders. Pere was unseated from the Legislative Council in 1912. Death and legacy Wi Pere died on 9 December 1915, and was buried in a vault at Waerenga-a-Hika on 3 January 1916. In his eulogy Apirana Ngata remarked: \\"No man ever did more for his people...never was there a greater fighter for his race than Wi Pere.‚Äù As a final tribute to Wi Pere, a monument was erected along Reads Quay, Gisborne in 1919 to coincide with the return of MƒÅori troops from war. It was unveiled on 9 April 1919 by Hon. James Carroll. MƒÅori historian Rongowhakaata Pere Halbert was a grandson of Wi Pere.

The word was also used during the later years of the Roman Republic and the early Empire, either as a general word for a coin, or to describe the sestertius, which was the standard unit for keeping accounts. History In circa 294, during the Tetrarchy, a new large bronze coin of circa 10 grams weight and 30 mm diameter appeared. Its official name was apparently nummus, although it has until recently been known among numismatists as the follis. The term nummus is now usually applied solely to the 5th‚Äì7th century Byzantine issues. These were small, badly struck coins, weighing less than 1 gram, forming the lowest denomination of Byzantine coinage. They were valued officially at 1‚ÅÑ7,200 of the gold solidus but more usually rated to 1‚ÅÑ6,000 or 1‚ÅÑ12,000. The nummus usually featured the profile of the reigning Byzantine emperor on the obverse and the Byzantine imperial monogram on the reverse, although some coins of Emperor Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565) display its numerical value by the Greek numeral \\"A\\" instead. = Higher denominations = In 498, Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491‚Äì518) reformed the coinage (carried out by the comes sacrarum largitionum John the Paphlagonian) by introducing multiples of the nummus, with denominations of 40 nummi, also known as a follis, 20 nummi (semifollis), 10 nummi (Greek: Œ¥ŒµŒ∫Œ±ŒΩŒøœçŒºŒºŒπŒøŒΩ, decanummium). These were also marked with Greek numerals representing their value: \\"M\\" for the follis, \\"K\\" for the semifollis and \\"I\\" for the decanummium. On the other hand, it appears that issue of the simple nummus was discontinued.. In 513, the weights of these coins were doubled, the pentanummium (Greek: œÄŒµŒΩœÑŒ±ŒΩŒøœçŒºŒºŒπŒøŒΩ, 5-nummi coin marked with \\"E\\") introduced, and the minting of single nummi resumed.. = Decreasing value = In 538/539, Emperor Justinian I introduced further changes to the 40-nummi follis, raising its weight to 25 grams. It was reduced again to 22.5 grams in 541/542, and further reductions followed until the century's end. At this time, a new 30-nummi coin (marked with \\"Œõ\\" or \\"XXX\\") was introduced, but the single follis had ceased to be struck at Constantinople. It survived in the Exarchate of Carthage well into the 7th century however.. During the 7th century, the successive military and financial crises led to further reduction in the weight and a marked deterioration of the quality of bronze coinage; by the time of Emperor Constans II (r. 641‚Äì668), a follis weighed only 3 grams. Consequently, the denominations lower than the semifollis were practically unmintable and abandoned.. Thereafter, the term nummus remained in use as a notional unit for 1‚ÅÑ6,000 of the solidus, and in colloquial usage for \\"small change\\".

It is a two-level mall. Eastridge Center is in between Tully Road, East Capitol Expressway, and Quimby Road. It is accessible from nearby U.S. Highway 101 via Tully Road. Anchor stores are J. C. Penney and Macy's. The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority operates the Eastridge Transit Center bus station on the side of the property near County Route G21 (known locally as the Capitol Expressway). The mall is across Tully Road from Reid-Hillview Airport and was built under the approach corridor to both of the airport's runways. Other nearby landmarks include Lake Cunningham and the Raging Waters San Jose water park. History The mall opened on May 17, 1971, with the original anchors of Macy's, Liberty House, J. C. Penney, Joseph Magnin Co., and Sears. Eastridge Center was the largest enclosed shopping mall in the Western United States. Emporium-Capwell replaced Liberty House when the chain pulled out of California. After Macy's bought Emporium- Capwell, the store was closed. It sat vacant until the 2005 remodel when it was demolished. A scene from Robert Redford's The Candidate (1972) was filmed at the mall, as were several scenes of Logan's Run (1976). In 1993, the Spillman Engineering 3 Abroad carousel, made c.1920 by Allan Herschell Company was restored and placed in the mall. The carousel has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2000. In February 2012, two teenage boys were stabbed and left in critical condition at the mall, which led to J. C. Penney and Macy's closing temporarily. In the wake of the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting, a mysterious package was thrown into an AMC theater at Eastridge during a showing of The Dark Knight Rises, which led to an evacuation of the theater. On July 20, 2012, a fire broke out near the mall at a homeless encampment in a 100-by-100 ft area, but was extinguished before the fire could reach any buildings. On January 15, 2016, a joint adventure between Pacific Retail Growth Partners and Silverpeak Real Estate Partners acquired the mall from GGP for $225 million, excluding the Sears and Macy's stores. The new owners announced that they will invest approximately $15 million to upgrade the mall. In March 2017, a renovation of the mall was announced.

Charlotte began her medical career by entering the New York Medical College for Women. New York Medical College for Women was the first medical school for women in the state of New York and opened the year before Charlotte Denman Lozier entered the school. New York Medical College for Women was founded by her mother-in-law, Dr. Clemence Sophia Harned Lozier.  Early adulthood  Dr. Charlotte Denman Lozier finished medical school in 1867 and soon became a professor of physiology and hygiene for New York Medical College for Women. While working as a professor, Charlotte also presented many lectures on women's rights. Charlotte Denman Lozier married the son of Dr. Clemence Lozier, Dr. Abraham Witton Lozier on January 20, 1866 in Ft. Wayne, Indiana. The two remained in Winona for some time before returning to New York where Charlotte then became the Vice President of the National Working Women's Association. As a feminist, she campaigned for the Women's Suffrage and Working Women's Association as well as other progressive and charitable organizations. Charlotte Denman Lozier and Abraham Lozier had three children. The first born was a boy, Clement Abraham on November 7, 1866. Clement Abraham died at the age of 21. The next to be born was another boy, Robert Ten Eyck, in May 1868 in Connecticut while Dr. Charlotte Denman Lozier was on her way home from a lecture. The last to be born was a girl, Jessie Charlotte, born on January 1, 1870. Jessie Charlotte married Harry S. Payne on January 15, 1896. Jessie and Harry Payne had one son born on July 3, 1898, named Robert Lozier Payne.  Career  Lozier worked as a physician, lecturer, and belonged to Sorosis, which in Latin means sisterhood. Sorosis was a professional women's club, which sought to support women involved in various fields of work. Lozier also served as the first Vice President of the National Working Women's Association. The Working Women's Association was created in 1868 and was formed to protect the rights of women, including better labor conditions for women of all classes. In the late 1860s, Charlotte Denman Lozier defended Hester Vaughn, a woman accused of killing her newborn. Lozier was also well known for defending women such as Caroline Fuller, a young woman whose sexual partner was urging for an abortion. The Charlotte Lozier Institute, named for Lozier, is an anti-abortion think tank founded in 2011. It is a research and education arm of the Susan B. Anthony List, an organization dedicated to electing candidates and pursuing policies that will reduce and ultimately end abortion. The stated goal of the Charlotte Lozier Institute is \\"to promote deeper public understanding of the value of human life, motherhood, and fatherhood, and to identify policies and practices that will protect life and serve both women‚Äôs health and family well-being.\\"  Last years of life  In 1869, Charlotte was pregnant with her third child. On New Year's Eve, Charlotte was on a ladder hanging a curtain when she became light-headed and fell off of the ladder. Charlotte Denman Lozier was taken to the hospital where her third and final child was born two months prematurely. However, Charlotte passed away at age 25 on January 3, 1870. Lozier died from health complications surrounding the pregnancy and birth of her third child, who was born several days before she died. She was survived by this child, her two previous children, and her husband.

The style is marked by the use of \\"geometric motifs, curvilinear forms, sharply defined outlines, often bold colors\\",Dictionary.com, from the Random House Unabridged Dictionary 2006. and a fascination with machinery and modernity.Bevis Hillier, The World of Art Deco, New York (1971), pp. 33-36. This style strongly influenced contemporary architecture, furniture, industrial design, books and posters. Art Deco was named for after 1925 exhibit in Paris Exposition Internationale des Arts D√©coratifs et Industriels Modernes (International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts). The exhibit lasted from April to October 1925 and displayed numerous objects in the new style. Examples of the style, however, are also found in the early twenties. The Art Deco style also influenced postage stamp design in a number of countries in the twenties and thirties. One of the focuses of art deco was transportation and machines, particularly airplanes, and airmail stamps of the period often were designed in this style. Stamps from some countries showed strong art deco influence, while in others it was absent or barely noticeable. The countries whose stamp designs were most influenced by art deco include a number of European countries,Oxford Art Online, entry for \\"Postage Stamps\\". such as France and the Netherlands, as well as several Latin American countries, particularly Mexico, Brazil and Chile. Stamps of the United States and Great Britain, in contrast, followed traditional design and showed little influence of this new style. Notable Art Deco stamps The Art Deco style originally developed in Europe and the earliest Art Deco stamps are from European countries in the 1920s. The style was used in some Latin American countries beginning in the mid-1930s, but never really spread to the United States, whose stamp designs remained traditional and conservative. Notable Art Deco stamps of this period include the following, some of which are small masterpieces of this style: =Europe= *France: In 1925, France issued a set of stamps to commemorate the Exposition Internationale des Arts D√©coratifs et Industriels Modernes.Scott catalogue, France nos. 220-225.Oxford Art Online, entry for \\"Postage Stamps\\". The Paris Exposition Coloniale Internationale of 1931 also was commemorated with a set,THE EXPOSITION COLONIALE INTERNATIONALE DE PARIS, 1931 by Arthur Chandler including a fine art deco image of the head of an African woman under which was block lettering within ruled lines, a common Art Deco device.Scott catalogue, France nos. 258-262. *Germany: In 1925, Germany issued a stamp displaying a bold Art Deco \\"traffic wheel\\" or traffic circle,Scott catalogue, Germany nos. 345-346. in commemoration of the Deutsche Verkehrausstellung M√ºnchen 1925 or Munich Transport Exhibition of 1925. Brochure for the \\"Deutsche Verkehrausstellung M√ºnchen 1925.\\" In 1934, it issued another striking image, two hands grasping a piece of coal, referring to the Saar Plebiscite held the following year which would determine that the coal-rich region would reunite with Germany. *The Netherlands: The stamps of the Netherlands showed influence of the Art Deco style as early as the mid-1920s, when the country issued two stamps honoring the Centenary of the Dutch Lifeboat Society. The stamps depicted highly stylized boats in distress and a lifeboat, with lettering showing some influence of the style. A triangular airmail stamp issued in 1933, depicting a Fokker Pander, was surrounded by a border with bold lettering typical of the style. In 1934, Cura√ßao, then a colony of the Netherlands, issued one of the iconic Art Deco stamps ever created, an airmail stamp carrying the highly stylized profile of the messenger god Hermes. *Austria: Austrian stamps of the 1920s showed influence of the Jugendstil or Art Nouveau style, but the new style made its influence known as the decade progressed. In 1925, Austria began a series of postage due stamps, and which included the country's name and an amount in a simple, bold design. *USSR: USSR's stamps showed some influence of the Art Deco style, particularly in the lettering, beginning about 1929. In 1932-1933 it issued a series of stamps commemorating the 15th anniversary of the October Revolution, which display strong elements of the style. *Switzerland: In 1932, Switzerland issued a stamp honoring the 1932 Disarmament Conference, and depicting an image of Peace in a bold Art Deco style *Portugal: In 1936, Portugal issued a series of airmail stamps with a highly stylized airplane propeller and cloud, forming a fine Art Deco image. =Latin America= The Art Deco style was popular with several Latin American countries, particularly Mexico, Chile and Brazil. *Mexico: Mexico issued some airmail stamps in the mid-1930s with lettering in a distinct Art Deco style.Scott catalogue Mexico, nos. C65-73.In 1939, Mexico issued a stamp with a boldly Art Deco image of the Arch of the Revolution, to commemorate the New York World's Fair. In the early 1940s, Mexico issued a number of stamps, commonly a larger format with strongly Art Deco influenced images Scott catalogue Mexico, nos. 764-766, C100-C102, C111-116, C126-C128. particularly including the artwork of Mexican artist Francisco Eppens. A 1939 stamp with an image by Eppens depicted three modes of transportation‚Äîairplane, train and highway, a common Art Deco subject.Ram√≥n Valdiosera Berman, Francisco Eppens: El Hombre, Su Arte y Su Tiempo, Mexico (1988), p. 42. A 1940 stamp by Eppens shows a helmsman, issued in connection with the Inauguration of Mexican President Manuel √Åvila Camacho. A 1942 stamp, part of a series honoring the Second Inter-American Agricultural Conference with Eppens' artwork, depicts a highly stylized woman sewing wheat. *Chile: In the mid-1930s, Chile issued a series of airmail stamps designed in a style clearly influenced by Art Deco.Scott catalogue Chile, nos. C30-C50. These included a stylized airplane in flight following a radio navigation system from point to point and a stylized condor. *Brazil: During the 1930s, Brazil issued a number of stamps influenced by the Art Deco style, especially in their lettering.Scott catalogue Brazil, nos. 372-73, 387-90. The most striking Art Deco stamps, however, was the 1934 issue commemorating the 7th International Trade Fair, held in Rio de Janeiro, and depicting silhouettes of buildings and a profile of a construction worker with highly stylized Art Deco lettering. =United States= The 1939 stamp depicting the Trylon and Perisphere, the centerpiece and symbol of the 1939 New York World's Fair. Although the Trylon and Perisphere itself is an iconic Art Deco image, the lettering and numbers on the stamp were done in a traditional, not Art Deco, font. With the exceptions of this and the 1942 \\"Win the War\\" stamp, United States stamps showed little or no Art Deco influence until 1998 when the Postal Service issued a stamp in a strong Art Deco depicting Ayn Rand (see Postage stamps and postal history of the United States).(1) Scott Specialized United States, (2006) no. 3308, p. 248 (2) (3)  Revival  The Art Deco style has been revived on stamps.

In the past, a full-day course incorporated lecture, written testing and hands-on skills. Now students study independently, complete an online examination, then attend an in-person skills session.

Martin O. May, Purple Heart and Medal of Honor recipient, died in April 1945 after a three-day standoff on an island near Japan's Okinawa. His courage inspired the Chapter 700 Military Order of the Purple Heart to install a memorial in his honor at Phillipsburg High School, where he attended as a member of the class of 1941.\\" May joined the Army from Phillipsburg in November 1942,WWII Army Enlistment Records and by April 19, 1945 was serving as a private first class in the 307th Infantry Regiment, 77th Infantry Division. On that day and the next two days, at legusuku-Yama on Ie Shima in the Ryukyu Islands during the Battle of Okinawa, he manned his machine gun despite intense Japanese fire. He repeatedly refused to withdraw, even after being seriously wounded, and held his ground until being killed. For these actions, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor on January 25, 1946. May, aged 23 at his death, was buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii. Medal of Honor citation Private First Class May's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > He gallantly maintained a 3-day stand in the face of terrible odds when > American troops fought for possession of the rugged slopes of legusuku-Yama > on Ie Shima, Ryukyu Islands. After placing his heavy machinegun in an > advantageous yet vulnerable position on a ridge to support riflemen, he > became the target of fierce mortar and small arms fire from counterattacking > Japanese.

He broke up a second counterattack by hurling grenades into the > midst of the enemy forces, and then refused to withdraw, volunteering to > maintain his post and cover the movement of American riflemen as they > reorganized to meet any further hostile action. The major effort of the > enemy did not develop until the morning of 21 April. It found Pfc. May still > supporting the rifle company in the face of devastating rifle, machinegun, > and mortar fire.

In its early existence, it was a part of Senning's Park, the site of the first zoo in Louisville. Beginnings as Senning's Park Senning's Park was started in 1902 by a German immigrant to Louisville from Kesse, Germany named Frederick Carl Senning, who immigrated to the city in 1868. Prior to opening the park, he and his wife Minnie founded the Senning Hotel at 2nd and Jefferson in downtown Louisville, as well as the first bowling alley in Louisville, at the corner of 8th and Main, also in downtown. The park started on two and a half acres owned by Fredrika Oswald before he died. It benefited from being only a block from the loop that electric streetcars used on Fourth Street. Initially it did not have a zoo, but instead focused on dancing and dining; picnics and political rallies were common at the facility. The zoo was started during the Prohibition era, and barely survived the Great Depression. In 1920, the Sennings' son William began the zoo operations, with his parents going on a trip to Europe. Animals present in the zoo included alligators, bears, deer, exotic birds, leopards, lions, monkeys, ostriches (for riding), and tigers. However, the keep of the exotic animals became expensive, and in 1939 the park was closed due to Frederick Senning's death. The park was sold at auction for $15,000 the following year. The new owner, B. A. Watson, opened a restaurant on the property called Colonial Gardens, and promptly closed the zoo. Its successor, the current Louisville Zoo, would not open until 1969. Colonial Gardens (1940‚Äìpresent) Front view of Colonial Gardens Colonial Gardens featured big bands during the 1940s. However, it had its own difficulties as well; it lost its right to sell rationed foods in 1944, and was found to have an illegal gambling device on the premises on January 13, 1948. A fire on August 16, 1950 caused $10,000 in damages. In the 1950s it served as both a hangout for teens, as well as a bar. Jerry Lee Lewis is said to have performed at the restaurant; also, local oral history holds that Elvis Presley had an unscheduled performance at the restaurant in 1956, as it was close to the home of his grandparents, whom he was visiting at the time. The last business operating in Colonial Gardens closed in 2003, and the building was then abandoned by its owners. By mid-2008, it was in danger of being demolished by investors interested in developing the property. In hopes of saving the building, a petition to declare the building and adjacent property an \\"Individual Local Landmark\\" was begun simultaneously. One rationale for the petition, among several other historical distinctions, was the fact that the building was the last of the beer gardens that once dominated the South end of Louisville. On November 20, 2008, the petition was passed, and the Louisville Metro Landmarks Commission named Colonial Gardens an Individual Local Landmark. In 2012, Louisville Metro Council member David Yates proposed an ordinance to change how the commission designates an individual local landmark, so residents in the immediate vicinity of the property in question would have more input in the commission's decisions, such as the one regarding Colonial Gardens. The ordinance also would give the council final decision authority. In August, the ordinance was passed 18‚Äì7 over Mayor Greg Fischer's veto. In June 2013, in a 16‚Äì3 vote, the Metro Council approved an ordinance allowing the city to purchase the Colonial Gardens property. The city subsequently sold the property to local developer Underhill Associates for $1 and gave $1.2 million toward the property's redevelopment. In 2017, Underhill is slated to begin construction on a $5 million redevelopment of Colonial Gardens and surrounding property, including renovating in the original building, demolishing a 1939 addition, and building two new one-story buildings. These buildings will be used to house three or four restaurants, which the developer prefers to be locally owned and mid-priced. In May 2019, the first two restaurants were planning to open in June 2019, though this was delayed to August.

W. Reeves or Wally Reeves, (referring to President Hayes' visit to Rhode Island in 1877) was an American composer, cornetist, and bandleader. He developed the American march style, later made famous by the likes of John Philip Sousa, and his innovations include adding a countermelody to the American march form in 1876. Sousa called Reeves \\"The Father of Band Music in America\\", and stated he wished he himself had written Reeves' \\"Second Regiment Connecticut National Guard March\\".James Cutler Chesebrough, \\"The marches of David Wallis Reeves: Performance editions of three marches dedicated to Connecticut organizations\\" (January 1, 2005).

Reeves was born on February 14, 1838, in Oswego, New York. In the early 1850s, he joined the Oswego band as an alto horn player, but soon moved to cornet, the instrument for which he would become famous. He occasionally performed with Jules Levy, another famous cornetist of the period. In 1871, he married Sarah Blanding. Blanding had a daughter from a previous marriage, and they were later to have a son, David W. Reeves, Jr. Reeves was a cornetist with the Dodworth Band of New York before being recruited by the American Brass Band of Providence, Rhode Island in 1866. He joined the ensemble on February 17, and was elected its leader on April 9. His initial compensation was $600 per year, plus the proceeds of one concert, in return for which he agreed to conduct the band on all occasions. He eventually added woodwinds to the formerly all-brass band, which became known as Reeves' American Band. It was known as one of the best marching bands in the country during his tenure. In the 1870s, he created the first local orchestra in Providence, the Providence Symphony Orchestra. In 1892, he accepted the directorship of Patrick Gilmore's Twenty-Second New York Regiment band after Gilmore's death, but returned to the American Band after a year. Later in the 1890s, he served as a judge for the New York Volunteer Firemen's Association's band competitions. Reeves conducting the Gilmore Band circa 1892 In 1878, Reeves led a performance of H.M.S. Pinafore, using a boat for the stage, which Arthur Sullivan took note of. Early in 1900, he contracted Bright's disease. He died on March 8, 1900. His funeral service took place at the First Baptist Church in America, where he had frequently led the American Band as part of Brown University's Commencement ceremonies, and included a performance of his Immortalis by the American Band. Sousa sent 200 roses in his memory. He was buried at Swan Point Cemetery with Masonic honors. By the time of his death in 1900, he had composed over 100 works. In 1926, a marble fountain was built as a memorial to Reeves in Roger Williams Park in Providence. ReferencesExternal links thumb Recordings of D. W. Reeves' music on the National Jukebox * D. W.

He is best known for his time with WWE under the ring name Ezekiel Jackson, where he is a former and final ECW Champion and Intercontinental Champion. He also competed in one season of Lucha Underground as Big Ryck. He is the owner of the Redwood City, California-based professional wrestling promotion and school Bryckhouse Pro Wrestling.  Early life  Stephens attended the University at Buffalo.  Professional wrestling career = World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE= Florida Championship Wrestling (2007‚Äì2008)  Stephens in FCW Stephens signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment in March 2007 and debuted in Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) in late June. In his debut match on June 27, he teamed with Keith Walker to defeat Kofi Kingston and Eric P√©rez. He continued to compete in the promotion in both tag team and singles matches. On February 8, 2008 he competed in a match with tag partner Bryan Kelly in a losing effort against Steve Lewington and Heath Miller in a mini-tournament to face the WWE Tag Team Champions John Morrison and The Miz. On May 6, 2008, Stephens wrestled his final match in FCW before being called up to WWE's main roster.  The Brian Kendrick's bodyguard (2008‚Äì2009)  Jackson with The Brian Kendrick in 2009 After being trained in FCW, Stephens debuted on the July 18, 2008 episode of SmackDown under the name Ezekiel, as The Brian Kendrick's bodyguard. On the August 8, 2008 edition of SmackDown, his ring name was tweaked to Ezekiel Jackson, and he was revealed as being Kendrick's \\"advisor\\". He then began interfering in Kendrick's matches against Jeff Hardy, Finlay, and WWE Champion Triple H. On the October 17 episode of SmackDown, Jackson made his official in-ring debut by quickly defeating Super Crazy, after replacing a supposedly sick Kendrick. In late 2008, Jackson began teaming with Kendrick and both began feuding with the Tag Team Champions The Col√≥ns (Carlito and Primo), although Kendrick and Jackson failed to win the championship. He suffered his first defeat on the February 13, 2009 episode of SmackDown, when he lost a singles match to R-Truth. Jackson made his final appearance on the SmackDown brand in a losing effort against Jeff Hardy on the April 3, 2009 episode.  The Ruthless Roundtable and ECW Champion (2009‚Äì2010)  On April 15, 2009, Jackson was drafted to the ECW brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental Draft, therefore breaking up the team of himself and Kendrick. He made his ECW debut defeating Jack Meridol on the July 9, 2009 episode. Jackson then began an angle with Vladimir Kozlov in which, week after week, after one of them had squashed a local competitor, the other would come out and hit their finishing move on the fallen opponent in a game of one- upmanship. On the August 18 episode of ECW, Jackson formed an alliance with Kozlov and William Regal after betraying the ECW Champion, Christian, during a tag team match to side with them, and attacking Christian at Regal's request. Kozlov and Jackson aided Regal in his feud with Christian over the ECW Championship, but Regal was unable to capture the title. Tribute to the Troops show On the November 24 episode of ECW, Jackson attacked both Regal and Kozlov after Kozlov accused Jackson of costing Regal a match. The following week, Jackson once again betrayed Kozlov and Regal by walking out on Kozlov during a tag team match against Christian and Shelton Benjamin. Jackson, however, realigned himself with Regal, when he was aided by Regal in defeating Kozlov on an episode of ECW. On the January 12, 2010 episode of ECW, Jackson won the ECW Homecoming battle royal to earn a match for the ECW Championship. He faced Christian for the ECW championship at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view but was unsuccessful. On the final episode of ECW on February 16, Jackson defeated Christian to win the ECW Championship in an Extreme Rules match. Upon winning the title, WWE credits Jackson as the final ECW Champion.  The Corre and Intercontinental Champion (2010‚Äì2011)  On the February 19 episode of SmackDown, a video package aired, promoting Jackson's return to the brand. He made his return on the March 5 episode of SmackDown without Regal, who instead joined Raw, and defeated Jimmy Wang Yang. On April 10, 2010 at a house show in Glasgow, Scotland, Jackson suffered a tear in his right quadriceps muscle during a match against Kane, and was expected to be inactive for approximately six months. During his injury, Jackson was drafted to the Raw brand as part of the 2010 WWE Supplemental Draft. Jackson made his return to the ring on September 13, 2010, defeating Zack Ryder in a dark match prior to the Raw tapings. He returned to television on the October 18 episode of Raw, where he was revealed as a member of Team Raw for the Bragging Rights pay-per-view. At Bragging Rights, Jackson was one of the final two remaining members of Team Raw, but they lost to Team SmackDown. On the November 22 episode of Raw, Jackson qualified for the 2010 edition of the King of the Ring tournament by defeating Alex Riley, who replaced Jackson's original opponent The Miz. He faced Drew McIntyre in the quarter-finals, but the match ended in a double countout, so neither advanced. In December 2010, Jackson was traded back to the SmackDown brand. On the January 11, 2011, taping of the January 14 edition of SmackDown, Jackson joined Wade Barrett, Justin Gabriel and Heath Slater in assaulting The Big Show, appearing to form an alliance with the three. The following week the group was named The Corre. On the May 6 episode of SmackDown, Jackson defeated Big Show in a singles match, but refused to celebrate with the other members of The Corre afterward. Backstage, the other members of The Corre attacked him in retaliation, turning Jackson face. Jackson went on to face Barrett for the Intercontinental Championship at Over the Limit, and won by disqualification, which meant that Barrett retained the championship. Jackson continued to feud with the other members of The Corre, winning against Barrett by disqualification and countout respectively. backbreaker rack on Drew McIntyre On June 19, at the Capitol Punishment pay- per-view, Jackson defeated Barrett to win the Intercontinental Championship for the first time. Jackson successfully retained the championship in a rematch against Barrett on the following episode of SmackDown and also successfully defended it against Ted DiBiase on the July 15 episode. On August 12 episode of SmackDown, Jackson lost the Intercontinental Championship to Cody Rhodes, ending his Intercontinental Championship reign at 51 days. He went on to feud with both Rhodes and DiBiase. On the August 19 episode of SmackDown, he lost a rematch for the championship to Rhodes. Jackson was part of a ten-man battle royal for the Intercontinental Championship, but was eliminated by Rhodes.  Final feuds and departure (2012‚Äì2014)  On January 29, 2012 at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view, Jackson entered the Royal Rumble match as the thirteenth entrant, but he was eliminated by the returning Great Khali. Jackson started a losing streak losing to the likes of Jinder Mahal, Drew McIntyre, and David Otunga. Jackson finally ended his losing streak by teaming with The Great Khali to defeat the team of Curt Hawkins and Tyler Reks on the May 16 episode of NXT. Around mid‚Äì2012, Jackson suffered an upper body injury and was inactive for many months. After almost a year of inactivity due to his injury, Jackson returned at a live event for WrestleMania Axxess on April 4, 2013 by teaming up with Yoshi Tatsu to defeat the team of Hunico and Camacho. On January 4, 2014, Jackson announced he was undergoing another surgery. As a result of this, on April 6, 2014, Jackson reported that he had officially parted ways with the WWE. = Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2014) = He made his debut, along with Gene Snitsky, in TNA on the June 25 taping of Impact Wrestling (which aired on July 24) using the ringname Rycklon as a heel; attacking Tommy Dreamer, Bully Ray and Devon, and aligning himself with Dixie Carter. It also marked the very first time that the final champion of the original and the new ECW were in the ring at exactly the same time (Rhino and Rycklon)http://www.pwinsider.com/article/86526/full- impact-spoilers-from-nyc-for-the-717-and-724-episodes.html?p=1 Jun 25, 2014 Rycklon and Snitsky were fired by Dixie Carter on the August 7 edition of Impact Wrestling. Earlier on the show they had competed in an Eight-Man Hardcore War between Team EC3 (EC3, Rhino, Rycklon and Snitsky) in a losing effort against Team Bully (Bully Ray, Devon, Tommy Dreamer and Al Snow). = Lucha Underground (2014‚Äì2015) = In September 2014, Stephens worked at Lucha Underground under the ring name Big Ryck, where he was forming a heel trio named The Crenshaw Crew with Cisco, Bael and Cortez Castro. Ryck feuded with Johnny Mundo and Prince Puma. Their feud concluded in a three-way ladder match, which was won by Mundo. On the October 5, 2014 taping, Ryck participated in an Aztec Warfare Battle Royal to crown the first Lucha Underground Champion but was eliminated. On January 21, 2015, Cisco, Castro and Bael attacked Ryck and burned his eye with a cigar, turning face in the process.

The series aired on TV Tokyo from 1991 to 1992. The show was one of multimedia content strategies‚Äîprevalent in Japan around the early 1990s‚Äî and several renditions of the content were released, that is, in the forms of manga, anime, PC Engine game. In this article mainly the anime version is explored. It contains a lot of parodies from old Japanese anime and live action shows, e.g., Kiki's Delivery Service, and Sailor Moon (since Usagi Tsukino was played by the same voice actress (Kotono Mitsuishi) as a heroine of this show. The game was released in 1991, a side-scroller by NEC Home Electronics. The manga series has two versions: one authored by Eiichi Sait≈ç that ran on Comic Bonbon in 1991, first followed an early version of scenario outlines in the development, but later put an end to that and adapted a new one that by and large follows the anime version's stories; one authored by Kazuhiko Shimamoto that ran on Deluxe Bonbon, one of the Comic Bonbon franchise issued from 1990 to 1995 as a comedy-manga magazine, in 1991, has stories completely different from the anime ones though the names of characters are identical. Plot Agedama Genji is a 4th grader boy in elementary school, and a hero on the training from 'Hero Planet'. Though the cheerful kid is no one special in appearance, he can transforms into a superhero called \\"Agedaman\\" by combining himself with his computer friend called Wapuro. He believes in Kiai power and he tries to handle all the problems that he encounters with that, so his father decided to let him go training on the earth accompanied by only Wapuro on summer vacation. After his arrival to Morisoba city, where an enormously wealthy clan rules arbitrarily, he joined East-Morisoba elementary school, then met a diva girl of the clan named Rei Kuki who has an ambition to conquer the world and, as a first step, attacks the city with a variety of chimera monsters that she and her grandfather create with the , which the rich old man invented. When they plot to attack the city she transforms into a super-villainess called \\"Onyomiko\\". The battles of Agedaman and Onyomiko began! Characters ; Agedama Genji: (voiced by Nozomu Sasaki) : The leading character of the show, born on 26 October, a daredevil boy and doesn't give a damn to any problem he could get. When Onyomiko accompanied by a synthesized monster tries to attack Morisoba city he turns to be a savior but the fact that he's a superhero mustn't be discovered by any earthling. He's got a crush on a girl called Ibuki Heike in his class since the very first day of school‚Äîwhen he fell in love with her at first sight. He uses his characteristic expressions (e.g., 'thanky!' for 'thank you'), and wears a wristwatch-shaped corded phone handset, one of Wapuro's accessories, that enables him to communicate with Wapuro when he's away, also, Wapuro's able to receive phone calls and route them to the handset. When he transforms into Agedaman he use the weapons like Frisbee called 'Double Frisbay,' which the hero in the read-and-white costume wears on each hip, also produces Kiai Cards (looks like ROM called HuCard for PC engine) from his headgear by concentrating his kiai energy, and, by inserting them into a slot that opens on the upper rim of an ornament on the chest of the armor, is able to use special abilities, e.g., Fire Card, Whack-a-Mole Card, Facsimile Card, Cheese Card, and Crab Meat Can Card. but to produce Kiai Cards, Agedaman has to tackle an opponent for a while since, meanwhile, Wapuro's eyes on Agedaman's visor need to analyse the opponent's data and once he founds weak points the hero makes an effort to concentrate his kiai energies and then a particular card that goes straight for the jugular of the opponent pops out from an earmuff of the headgear. By pressing the caps key in a keyboard on his gauntlet, he's able to \\"capitalize\\" his body (a giant form). The family name is named after The Tale of Genji, a classic Japanese literature, and the given name means agedama (also called tenkasu.) The name of the show comes from his name in Japanese naming order, Genji Agedama, and Ts≈´shin in the middle of it literally means communication, but especially telecommunication here on account of his use of the computer friend. ; Wapuro: (voiced by Kumiko Watanabe) : Agedama's best friend, a word processor robot, hence the name (abbreviation for word processor in Japanese), though the body of the type machine is usually football-shaped with retractable feet and a pair of antennas, is able to change it into six other \\"modes\\", that is, Armadillo (when he's in a haunted mansion where he and Agedama, Ebiten and Okame live,) School-Bag (carried on Agedama's back when they're in school,) Pocketbike(running on roads when his best friend wakes up late and hurries,) Jet(which is able to fly in the stratosphere and penetrate the walls of a spacecraft,) Submarine(which protects a passenger with the canopy but the seat is too small for the 10-year-old to get on board,) and Agedaman (combining himself with Agedama: the transforming procedure is called 'Henkan (Â§âÊèõ).' This word processor robot can't help but pronounce all letters, even punctuation when he speaks, e.g., at the end of Agedaman-transformation procedure, he says \\"Henkan is done dot,\\" when he feels at a loss for words hearing dumb words from friends, shuts his mouth and says \\"...(dot dot dot)\\", and, when giving a holler, shouts \\"Agedama!! (Agedama double exclamation)\\". ; Ibuki Heike: (voiced by Kotono Mitsuishi) :The heroine of the show, born on 15 July, is in love with Agedaman (not Agedama because she loves the superhero, who saves the world, but, little by little, gets into his everyday persona which she thinks just talks the talk, too. She cares her little brother and friends and doesn't give way to Rei, the bossy classmate who calls the shots in her class, being fair and square. But sometimes goes crazy: laughs like hell when hearing something funny (inherited this from her mother,) goes insane playing the games of rock-paper-scissors and goldfish scooping, etc. The family is named after The Tale of Heike (a classic novel published centuries ago as well as that of Genji.)On the final Episodes she becomes a superheroine, which makes references of Sailor Moon(Her Transformation scene,Poses and the voice actress). ; Rei Kuki: (voiced by Sakiko Tamagawa) :An antagonist of the series, born on 21 August, takes advantage of her wealthy family, uses her grandfather's authority and scatters money to make everything her way, however, feels very lonely inside her heart because her parents are busy and travel around the world so much that they don't have time to pay attention to their child, thus is in the charge of her grandfather being neglected by them. When wearing an Onyomiko suit she's the commander of a synth-monster and makes that creature play havoc with things that get in the way of her goal. By combining herself with P-Shiro, Kuki's counterpart of the word processor robot, Onyomiko transforms to a stronger form, Hyper-Onyomiko, but hardly wants to do it because she has to be stripped by the robot, who's like a dirty old man, in the transformation procedure. The family name is named after Kuki clan, which consisted of famous samurai. The alias is a portmanteau of On'yomi (one of the two ways of kanji reading) and miko (Shinto priestess) because, in an early stage of scenario development, another storyline‚Äîin which Onyomiko and Bif≈´ Kunreikan (the family name is a portmanteau of Kun'yomi and shireikan (commander)) plot to rule all the kanji around the world and Agedaman comes and fights to save people‚Äîwas laid on the table, the manga versions followed this plot. ; Raizo Kuki: (voiced by Junpei Takiguchi) :An antagonist, Rei's grandfather, a.k.a. Nottoridamus XI, a descendant of a great prophet, Nottoridamus I, whose name is a pun on nottori (Japanese:taking over someone else's property) and damasu (to deceive) and also a spoof of Nostradamus' predictions. He interprets the ancestor's prophecies and, according to interpretations he orders his henchmen to bring ingredients to his underground laboratory in a mansion he lives, and, by putting them into Monster Cooker, creates miscellaneous monsters to achieve his goal: taking over the world. When he was young the rich old man was so poor that he hardly had money to buy small dried fish and umeboshi. But, by interpreting the ancestor's prophecies, he'd bought and sold shares his way to the top and quickly became the world's richest man surpassing Rockefeller family. ;Ebiten: (voiced by Masahiro Anzai) :An old fairy, takes care of Agedama on earth, the small body is always in a rice bowl. The name is a portmanteau of Ebisu (a member of Seven Lucky Gods) and ebi-tempura (shrimp tempura). From the PC Engine game, without a major redesign. ;Okame: (voiced by Masako Miura) :Ebiten's wife, an old fairy, makes food for Agedama, the body is a small jar. Modeled directly after Okame (Noh mask: that of an ugly chubby woman used as a comedy relief between serious performances; its name origin is a Japanese word, kame (jar), since each of its plump cheek looks like a round shape a clay jar; nowadays it's known as the mascot of a natto brand called Okame Natto more than as the traditional mask.) From the game, without a major redesign. ;Oolong-Tea: (voiced by Katsumi Suzuki) :A protagonist, but doesn't side with anyone, wears a Chinese costume, a money grubber, though he's a 4th grader in Agedama's class, looks like a middle aged man. From the game, without a major redesign. ;P-shiro: (voiced by K≈çz≈ç Shioya) :An antagonist, personal computer robot, made by the Monster-Cooker from Rei's stuffed panda (called Pan-chan) that'd been Rei's best friend since she'd been a toddler. Speaks with Kansai accent and always has a cigarette on the lips. The name is a play on words with PC (Japanese pronunciation:pee-shee) and Shiro (a given name for Japanese males or for pets.) ;Kensaku-sensei: (voiced by Tomoyuki Morikawa) :The teacher in charge of Agedama's class wearing a kendo suit. Though he can't resist Kuki's power, the young honest teacher who believes in the power of youth couldn't care less about what he would get when scolding the rich girl who has tantrums, and goes so far to spank her bottom with his hand just worrying about the future of the rude child as a teacher. He's got a crush on a female colleague who he calls Hitomi-sensei. When he was a student the thin man who always carries a bamboo sword was the captain of a sumo club in school, weighed 100kg (220lbs).

Although they're promised that their salary should be 2,000,000 yen per month it's gradually cut down when the henchmen make a blunder or make the boss and bossy girl mad, so they end up getting paid just 50,000 yen (approx. 405 US dollars) every month. these surnames are the top three most common Japanese ones. :;Sat≈ç: (voiced by Tomoyuki Morikawa) :Medium height, lives in a small apartment with his wife (called Nabeko) and baby, from Tokushima prefecture and is enthusiastic about Awa dance‚Äîa local dance of his hometown. :;Tanaka: (voiced by Wataru Takagi) :The tall one, owns a house, honest and, when chosen for a synth-monster ingredient, doesn't hesitate to sacrifice himself thinking about his wife and kids. :;Suzuki: (voiced by Tetsuya Iwanaga) :The short one, the only single person in the group, lives in a small apartment full of noise from the railroad track near it, easy-going and sometimes the colleagues find that he's like lolicon as he has an obsession with knee-high socks and, when seeing a girl wearing a pair, can't help but roll it down to the ankle (he calls that movement 'kutsushita kururun(socks roll)'.

Though the beautiful down-to-earth woman considers relationship, in reality she loves machismo, not to say, chauvinism, so, nurses her emotions and waits for the old-fashioned straightforward teacher to become wild. ; Kodama Heike: (voiced by Satomi K≈çrogi (in episode 6) ‚Üí Ikue ≈åtani (from episode 13 to the final)) :Ibuki's little brother, 3 years old, a big fan of Agedaman who pretends to be the hero and calls himself \\"Agedaman 2,\\" his brother.

When they were in elementary, just after the short man, who looked like Tatsuya Uesugi in the anime/manga series called Touch, asked her what type of socks she preferred from tights, knee-high and medium socks and she hesitantly but immediately answered \\"...knee-high, so?\\" the handsome kid, who would lose that pretty face when grown up, happily said \\"Me too! Let me roll down your knee-highs!\\" and ran to her feet and did 'kutsushita kururun (socks roll) on her leg, then she scarily screamed and ran away from him shedding tears and \\"climbed to a sunset sky (this climbing is a parody of a scene in a Studio Ghibli movie called Only Yesterday, thus, the looks of Suzuki's first love and Taeko Okajima, the leading character of that movie, are identical when they were schoolgirls.

It is also called pharmacopuncture, Korean herb acupuncture and acupuncture with medicinal herbs. Definition Traditional Korean Medicine treatment of injecting herbal medicinal substances on the gyeonghyeol (Á∂ìÁ©¥:Acupuncture points = the points of kyungrak (=meridiansÁ∂ìÁµ°)) which acts as both acupuncture stimulation and direct medicinal dosage. Background Since herbal extracts can be absorbed directly without passing through the gastrointestinal tract, the effects of pharmacopuncture are expected to be realized more quickly than oral herbal medicine. It is also known as Yakchim (Ëó•Èçº) Immunization, Suchim (Ê∞¥Èíà), Yakchimyobeop(a method of treatment of Yakchim), Hyeolwi (Á©¥‰Ωç) needle therapy. It is a type of medical science of Immunity (ÂÖçÁñ´ÂåªÂ≠¶) injecting to the important gyeonghyeol (Á∂ìÁ©¥: acupuncture points) ingredients extracted from oriental medical herbs. It can also be said that the therapy of a needle for acupuncture is a method of treatment stimulating the human body externally and the medication therapy is stimulating the internal organs internally. It has an intention of improving the effectiveness of treatment by enforcing the two therapies simultaneously. In western pharmacodynamic sense, direct injection of medicinal substances into the body promotes quicker steadystate levels of substances either in the local tissue or in the blood stream, thus improving time-efficacy of the medicine (which has been a long concern when treating time-critical patients) It was developed by Nam Sang Chun (ÂçóÁõ∏ÂçÉ) from South Korea who had researched the formation of kyungrak (=meridiansÁ∂ìÁµ°) in 1956 and has strengthened the immunity developing into a specialty of acupuncture field and since 1963 he has examined closely the functioning of kyungrak (=meridiansÁ∂ìÁµ°) using a syringe with herbal medication such as sanjoin (ÈÖ∏Ê£ó‰ªÅ), hwanggi (ÈªÉËä™: Astragalus membranaceus Bunge), ginseng (‰∫∫Ëîò) and nokyong (ÈπøËå∏: the young antlers of the deer). It is distinguished that gyeonghyeol (Á∂ìÁ©¥:Acupuncture points) has an effect by itself only with the stimulation of the needle, but can be achieved greater therapeutic effect with the injection of specific medicinal herbs. It is being researched and developed in several countries like South Korea, China and Japan and others, where the oriental therapies are prevalent. The department of the career of Yakchim has been implemented in the Korean Oriental medicine institute on August 26, 1990 in South Korea and the research and the diffusion about Yakchim (Ëó•Èçº) has been progressing actively. YakChim (Ëó•Èçº) is injecting remedy into the Kyonglak (Á∂ìÁµ°) system in order to maximize the effects and the time. Nowadays YakChim is used widely all around the world at the same time. Injections can be divided into Kije (Ê∞£Âäë) and Yunje. Kije (Ê∞£Âäë) is medicine injected directly injected into Kyonglak (Á∂ìÁµ°), and Yunje (ÊΩ§Âäë) is a medicine that produces Ki (Ê∞£). Yunje works as a lubricating device. Menopausal symptoms In traditional Korean medicine, many menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes, dry mucosa, sleep disorders, and recurrent urinary tract infections, are regarded as being due to a deficiency of yin in the kidneys. The normal functions of the kidneys in Korean medicine include thermoregulation, sexuality, and water homeostasis. Kidney function may decline with increasing age, and especially during the menopause. Yin is identified with receiving and regenerative elements. The hominis placenta is believed to replenish the yin in the kidneys. Thus, the pharmacopuncture treatment for menopausal symptoms are subcutaneous injections of a human placenta extract into four acupoints (CV4, CV6, and bilateral Ex-BB1).

Colour mutations are a natural but very rare phenomenon that occur in either captivity or the wild. About fifteen primary colour mutations have been established in the species which enable the production of many different combinations. Note that this article is heavily based on the captive or companion cockatiel rather than the wild cockatiel species.  Mutations (list)  * Anti-Dimorphic (ADM) Pied/Recessive Pied * Ashenfallow, incorrectly known as either Recessive Silver and/or Silver Fallow in the past * Bronzefallow/Brownfallow * Cinnamon * Dilute, incorrectly known as Pastel Silver in the past * Dominant Silver/Ashen Dilute * Edgedilute, incorrectly known as Spangled Silver in the past * Faded * Sex-linked Ino/Lutino/Albino *Palefaced Ino/Creamino * Non-sex-linked ino/Recessive Ino * Opaline/Pearl * Palefaced, often incorrectly known as Pastelfaced * Pallid, often incorrectly known as Platinum *White-faced * Dominant Yellowcheeks * Sex-linked Yellowcheeks * Yellow-suffusion, incorrectly known as Emerald and/or Olive Cockatiels started with a normal grey colour, and then mutations began popping up because of specific breeding. The first mutations that occurred were pieds, cinnamons, Lutinos and pearlies. The next mutations to occur were white-faces, silvers and albinos. Recently, an orange-crested cock with orange cheek patch extending into the face and crest has occurred; this is a newly discovered mutation.  Normal grey (non-mutated)  A perfect example of a normal grey cockatiel.The normal grey or wild-type cockatiel is one who's colour genes have no mutations. A normal grey cockatiel's plumage is primarily grey with prominent white flashes on the outer edges of each wing. The face of the male is yellow or white, while the face of the female is primarily grey or light grey, and both genders feature a round orange area on both ear areas, often referred to as \\"cheek patches\\". This orange colouration is generally vibrant in adult males, and often quite muted in females and young cockatiels. Visual sexing is often possible with this variant of bird.Normal Cockatiel , Native Cockatiel Society of Australia, 2008 A normal grey cockatiel with some white or yellow feathers on the back of their head is split to the recessive mutation Pied.  White-faced  A white-faced cockatiel (sleeping) White- faced cockatiels have their lutein (yellow and orange) pigments deactivated by the blue gene, resulting in cockatiels with absolutely no lutein pigments whatsoever. This is a result of the same genetic mutation as the genuine Blue genetic mutation in all typical parrot and parakeet species. Consequently, White-faced cockatiels are mainly grey with more or less white throughout their plumage. White-faced cocks display brilliant white faces while hens display basically grey faces with some white streaks. With the availability of the Whiteface mutation, the cockatiel's wide colour varieties are divided into 2 main classes (or series): # Yellow base: with lutein (yellow and orange) pigments. # White base: without lutein pigments Some white-faced cockatiels have entirely white bodies and red eyes. Albino isn't entirely correct terminology, although they are sometimes referred to as such. Albino animals have the Blue genetic mutation, but cockatiels do not have the Blue gene. The more appropriate name for this mutation would be the White-faced Lutino.  Lutino  The Lutino sex-linked recessive mutation is a perfect example of a type of cockatiel that are the hardest to sex visually. Lutinos lack eumelanin pigment (enabling black, brown, grey colours and tones) and are consequently yellow to yellowish-white with orange cheek-patches. Adult female Lutinos as well as immature Lutinos of both genders display yellow bars, dots and/or stripes on the underside of their tail feathers. Mature males, however, can be sexed visually by their always displaying solid white coloured undersides of tail feathers. Unfortunately, a good number of cockatiels of all Lutino mutations and varieties, such as Pale-faced Lutino and Opaline Lutino, are usually affected with a transmittable genetic flaw. This flaw enlarges the bald-spot below the crest, due to irresponsible excessive in-breeding and a general lack of effort, ethics and responsibility breeders to breed it out. Breeders who have been working on reducing the bald patch have been greatly successful in reducing its size. A pet lutino cockatiel. Note the lack of dark pigment, including in the beak, eyes, feathering, feet, skin and toenails.  Pied  Pied cockatiel plumage patterns vary significantly between one individual to another, giving rise to cockatiel breeders and hobbyists' the \\"Heavy Pied\\" and \\"Light Pied\\" distinctions. Unfortunately, the degree in piedness remains quite genetically unpredictable. However, breeding heavily pied specimens together generally produces a higher percentage of heavily pied offspring than breeding lesser pied specimens together. Ultimately, the \\"Pied\\" mutation causes the bird to lack a majority of the typical grey plumage on the breast, belly, and head. Thus \\"Pied\\" cockatiels are characterized by the degree of their yellow or yellow-white colouring in these areas. Last but not least, there are the exceptional Clear-pied individuals that are solid yellowish-white or solid white just like Lutino and/or albino but with normal blackish eyes and out of ADMpied (recessive pied) parentage. A pearl-pied cockatiel. It is important to know that, throughout parrot species the ADMpied gene negates the male's ability to display his species' dimorphic features. Leading to ADMpied cockatiels being notoriously difficult to sex visually but being excellent examples for studies in genetic traits. However, in monomorphic species (i.e. conures, lovebirds, macaws, rosellas, etc.) the anti-di-morphic feature cannot be expressed while piedness still is. Therefore, Pied specimens of these species are called either Recessive Pied and/or Harlequin in budgerigar.  Cinnamons and pearls  Cinnamon and pearl mutations are sex-linked recessive. In Cinnamons, the eumelanin pigment are partially oxidized. Eumelanin granules are stopped at the brown stage of their development to end up in their natural black colour state. They have a specked complexion, with white spots on their secondary feathers and deep brown on their primaries. The pearl cockatiels' gene does not have any visual effect on the colour pigments in the bird but instead, it affects the distribution of the colours that are already present. It actually decreases the spread of the grey family of pigments (melanin) and increases the spread of the yellow pigments (lutein or psittacine). Individual feathers over most of a Pearled bird will have more of the yellow family of pigments visible giving them a scalloped pattern. It is especially interesting to note that males do not retain the pearled colouring. They soon lose this after their first molt. Though you may not be able to see this pattern, it is not essentially gone. It is only covered up by more grey pigment.Cinnamon Cockatiels Pearl Cockatiels  Combined mutations  alt=There are a tremendous number of colour varieties (combined mutations), including ADMpied Cinnamon, White-faced Lutino, Opaline Cinnamon, Creamino, White-faced Cinnamon, White-faced Opaline. Mutations can appear both individually or in a wide variety of combinations such as albino, Pearled Lutino, White-faced Pied, and Opaline-Cinnamon. Still fairly hard to find is the rather new yellow- suffusion mutation. Cockatiels do not actually have green pigment in their plumage, thus yellow-suffusion specimens don't either. The yellow suffusion combined with underlying black (or pure brown in Cinnamon specimens) pigmentation produces an illusion of greenish tones giving rise to the genetically incorrect common names of Emerald for this trait.  Other features  Many mutations retain the normal features (black eyes, grey beak, grey feet/skin, and black toenails) of wild-type (grey) cockatiels. However, Fallow and Lutino mutations have pink to red eyes, pink feet/skin, white- tipped clear (pink) toenails and pinkish-white beaks. Also, Cinnamon specimens look quite essentially alike wild-type (a.k.a. normal grey) specimens, with the exception of being pure-brown and hatching with wine-red eyes (which turn to brown between 5‚Äì15 days of age) and displaying dark brown eyes in adulthood. Sex-linked mutations such as Cinnamon, Lutino, Opaline, Pallid and/or sex-linked yellowcheeks have a higher ratio of female to male offspring due to the mode of inheritance.Cockatiel Genetics , Feather Affair, viewed 20 May 2007Genetic Terms , Cynthia Kiesewetter, North American Cockatiel Society, 2000Cockatiel Color Palette  Sexing without sexual dimorphism  As mentioned above, some mutations don't allow sexing by their feather patterns. This is because some mutations don't vary between males and females. One method of sexing cockatiels involves checking their pelvic bones. This idea is similar to how human pelvic bones differ, where females have wider hips to allow for childbirth; female cockatiels can have wider and more flexible pelvic bones to account for egg laying. This method isn't always accurate when genes cause females to have a narrower pelvis. Another way to sex cockatiels is by their behaviour. Males tend to be more vocal and also have an easier time mimicking noises. Males also sometimes \\"strut\\". This behaviour is categorized by sticking their chest out and parading around, sometimes pacing, typically accompanied by whistling. Females are usually quiet and they're more likely to hiss and bite.

Most outlets are foreign-owned, with media conglomerates like NZME, Stuff, MediaWorks and Sky dominating the media landscape. Most media organisations operate Auckland-based newsrooms with Parliamentary Press Gallery reporters and international media partners, but most broadcast programmes, music and syndicated columns are imported from the United States and United Kingdom. The media of New Zealand predominantly use New Zealand English, but Community Access and several local other outlets provide news and entertainment for linguistic minorities. Following a Waitangi Tribunal decision in the 1990s, the Government has accepted a responsibility to promote the MƒÅori language through Te MƒÅngai PƒÅho funding of the MƒÅori Television Service, the Te Whakaruruhau o Nga Reo Irirangi MƒÅori and other outlets. NZ On Air funds public service programming on the publicly owned Television New Zealand and Radio New Zealand, and on community-owned and privately owned broadcasters. Censorship RSF Press Freedom Index puts New Zealand in the highest category for press freedom. There is limited censorship in New Zealand of political expression, violence or sexual content. Reporters Without Borders rates New Zealand highly for press freedom, ranking it eighth-best worldwide in 2018, up from thirteenth in 2017, and down from fifth in 2016. The country's libel laws follow the English model, and contempt of court is severely punished. The Office of Film and Literature Classification classifies and sometimes censors films, videos, publications and video games, the New Zealand Press Council deals with print media bias and inaccuracy and the Broadcasting Standards Authority and Advertising Standards Authority considers complaints. The Department of Internal Affairs is responsible for Internet censorship in New Zealand and runs a voluntary filtering system to prevent Internet users from accessing selected sites and material that contain sexual abuse or exploitation of children and young people. Internet censorship in Australia is more extensive, and New Zealand has refused to follow suit. Conventional media=Television= Television in New Zealand was introduced in 1960. Provision was first made for the licensing of private radio and television stations in New Zealand by the Broadcasting Act 1976. In addition to a legacy analogue network, there are three forms of broadcast digital television: satellite services provided nationwide by Freeview and Sky, a terrestrial service provided in the main centres by Freeview, and a cable service provided in Wellington and Christchurch by TelstraClear. There are currently 11 national free-to-air channels, 22 regional free-to-air stations and several pay TV networks. Programming and scheduling is done in Auckland where all the major networks are now headquartered. The first nationwide digital TV service was launched in December 1998 by SKY TV, who had a monopoly on digital satellite TV until the launch of Freeview's nationwide digital Satellite service in May 2007. The Freeview terrestrial service, named FreeviewHD is a high definition digital terrestrial television service launched on 14 April 2008. The service currently serves areas surrounding Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga, Napier- Hastings, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin. Digital cable television currently operates in Wellington and Christchurch on TelstraClear's cable TV system. High Definition programming is available from Freeview on terrestrial broadcast only and on SKY TV through the MY SKY HDi decoder. =Radio= Radio New Zealand headquarters in Wellington. New Zealand radio is dominated by twenty-seven networks and station-groups, but also includes several local and low-powered stations. Radio New Zealand operates four public service networks: the flagship Radio New Zealand National, the classical music network Radio New Zealand Concert, the Pacific shortwave service Radio New Zealand International and the Parliamentary broadcasters AM Network. Two companies have a staunch rivalry in the commercial radio market. NZME Radio operates music station Coast, hip-hop station Flava, rock station Radio Hauraki, 80s and 90s station Mix 98.2, talk network Newstalk ZB, sports network Radio Sport, pop station The Hits and youth station ZM. MediaWorks New Zealand operates sport network LiveSport, dance station George FM, New Zealand music station Kiwi FM, MƒÅori station Mai FM, pop station More FM, talk station Radio Live, oldies station The Sound, easy-listening station The Breeze, youth station The Edge and rock station The Rock. Rhema Media operates four evangelical Christian networks, most student networks belong to the Student Radio Network and most public access broadcasters belong to the Association of Community Access Broadcasters. The Iwi Radio Network is funded by Te MƒÅngai PƒÅho and the Pacific Media Network is predominantly funded by NZ On Air. =Print media= The number of newspapers in New Zealand has dramatically reduced since the early 20th century as a consequence of radio, television and new media being introduced to the country. Auckland's The New Zealand Herald serves the upper North Island, Wellington's The Dominion Post serves the lower North Island and Canterbury's The Press and Otago Daily Times serve the South Island. Provincial and community newspapers, such as the Waikato Times daily, serve particular regions, cities and suburbs. Ownership of New Zealand newspapers is dominated by Stuff and New Zealand Media and Entertainment with Stuff (formerly Fairfax) having 48.6% of the daily newspaper circulation. Local and overseas tabloids and magazines cover food, current affairs, personal affairs, gardening and home decor, and business or appeal to gay, lesbian, ethnic and rural communities. In early April 2020, German media company Bauer Media Group announced the closure of several of its New Zealand brands including Woman's Day, New Zealand Woman's Weekly, the New Zealand Listener, The Australian Women's Weekly, North & South, Next, Metro, Air New Zealand's inflight magazine Kia Ora, and Your Home & Garden in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. =Literature= CMS Paihia to publish Bibles during the 19th century. MƒÅori in New Zealand had non-literate culture before contact with the Europeans in the early 19th century, but oratory recitation of quasi-historical and hagiographical ancestral blood lines was central to the culture; oral traditions were first published when early 19th century Christian missionaries developed a written form of the Maori language to publish Bibles. The literature of New Zealand includes many works written in English and Maori by New Zealanders and migrants during the 20th and 21st centuries. Novelists include Patricia Grace, Albert Wendt and Maurice Gee; children's authors include Margaret Mahy. Keri Hulme won the Booker Prize for The Bone People; Witi Ihimaera's novel Whale Rider, which dealt with Maori life in the modern world, ' became a Nikki Caro film. Migrant writers include South African-born Robin Hyde; expatriate writers like Dan Davin and Katherine Mansfield often wrote about the country. Samuel Butler stayed in New Zealand and set his novel Erewhon in the country. Karl Wolfskehl prepared works of German literature during a sojourn in Auckland. New Zealand's lively community of playwrights, supported by Playmarket, include Roger Hall. =Film= A farm near the town of alt=Image shows rolling green hills with dwellings built in to them. These formed the town of \\"Hobbiton\\" in the Lord of the Rings films. These and other sets were constructed near the town of Matamata, in the Waikato region of New Zealand's North Island. The New Zealand film industry is small but successful, boasting directors such as Peter Jackson and Jane Campion. The cinema of New Zealand includes many films made in New Zealand, made about New Zealand or made by New Zealand-based production companies. Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy was produced and filmed in New Zealand, and animation and photography for James Cameron's Avatar was primarily done in New Zealand; both films are among the highest-grossing movies of all time. The New Zealand Film Commission funds films with New Zealand content. Mainstream American, British and Australian films screen in theatres in most cities and towns. Some arthouse films and foreign language films reach cinemas, including weekly Bollywood screenings in many city cinemas. Asian films, particularly from India, China, Hong Kong and Japan, are widely available for rental on videocassette, DVD and similar media, especially in Auckland. New media=Internet= Internet is widely available in New Zealand. There are 1,916,000 broadband connections and just 65,000 dialup connections, with almost every home having an internet connection. Digital subscriber line over phone lines provides two-thirds of broadband, and fibre to the home now covers over a third of the main towns and cities. Parts of Wellington, Kapiti and Christchurch have cable internet access, satellite internet is widely available, most of the country is covered by 3G mobile broadband, and 4G is available in major centres. Broadband pricing is at, or above the OECD average, and most connections have a fixed data cap. There are about 80 ISPs, with two of them having three-quarters of the market. The New Zealand Government is funding two broadband expansion initiatives, with the aim of providing fibre to the home of 75% of the population and bringing broadband to 97.8% of the population by 2019. International connectivity is mainly provided by the Southern Cross Cable. Internet portals like Google New Zealand, Yahoo New Zealand, NZCity and MSN New Zealand have been popular in New Zealand since the outset of internet access.

One list of over 200 \\"author-operated, public discourse\\" blogs in New Zealand (ranked according to traffic, links incoming, posting frequency and comments) suggests New Zealand blogs cover a wide range of ideological positions but a lack female contributors. Some personal blogs have been around since the mid 1990s,Aardvark Bruce Simpson (1995) but there are now blogs about cities, science, lawStephen Marshall and fashion magazines. Political bloggers include current and former party apparatchiks such as David Farrar (Kiwiblog), Jordan Carter, Peter Cresswell and Trevor Loudon, and journalists and commentators such as Russell Brown. New Zealand politicians and political groups operate blogs which, unlike overseas counterparts, allow comments. Craig Foss operates a personal blog. The Green Party expands on party press releases, and Labour MPs discuss policy and Parliamentary business. Blogging is a central campaigning tool for many political lobbying groups.COG Political bloggers have been described as potentially the most powerful \\"opinion makers\\" in New Zealand politics. There is also an active political and non-political New Zealand community on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr and Flickr.

KGN is one of four institutions overseen by the board of Governors (BOG) of Kyoto University of Foreign Studies (KUFS). All institutions share the common philosophy of World Peace through Languages, though KGN was founded on the principles of futohfukutsu. There is no direct translation of this term; however, KGN states the following from the scriptures of Nisshinkan: No matter what difficulties are involved in doing what you need to do and what you have to do, be firm with the mental spirit. As long as you are human, you will be accompanied by struggles. When you do encounter struggles, proceed without fuss and without panic, and you will overcome your struggles and grow as an individual.Kengaku no seishin k≈çkun k≈çka, 2003 Through the principles of futohfukutsu, KGN aims to cultivate strong (tsuyoku), reasonable (tadashiku), and knowledgeable (akaruku) students to contribute towards a developing society through a love of learning, moral principles, and the nourishment of 'self expression' and 'foresight'.Âª∫Â≠¶„ÅÆÁ≤æÁ•û„ÉªÊ†°Ë®ì„ÉªÊïôËÇ≤ÁõÆÊ®ô„ÉªÊ†°Ê≠å Main gate of Kyoto Gaidai Nishi High School with name plate and UNESCO School plate KGN‚Äôs student population of about 950 (fluctuates year by year) mostly commute from within Kyoto City and surrounding communities, with students also commuting from neighboring prefectures Shiga, Osaka, Hyogo and Nara. There is a small student population of returnee students (students who have lived and studied outside Japan for an extended period of time) and students of mixed ethnical backgrounds. Students are provided an array of extracurricular activities in both sports and culture. KGN also strives to provide students with opportunities to explore a range of topics and interests that would not be covered in conventional high school curricula. Since 1990, all grade 12 students of the International & Cultural Studies course participate in the Kansai High School Model United Nations, whose General Assembly is conducted in English. As a result of this and other activities, KGN was recognized as a UNESCO School in 2013 and was chosen to represent Kyoto Prefecture at the 2014 World Youth Forum on Education for Sustainable Development. In 2017, KGN was recognized as a Tokyo 2020 Olympic & Paralympic Education School. In 2018, 75% of KGN‚Äôs graduates moved on to a 4-year university and 15% to a 2-year vocational college. 3% moved into the workforce. Every year, a very small number of students attend college outside Japan. KGN currently offers students 4 tracks of study from which to choose: College Preparatory (Tokushin) Course, International and Cultural Studies (IC) Course, General Academic (GA) Course, and Sports Education Course.  Courses offered = Tokushin Course = The Tokushin Course is an advanced academic course for students whose primary focus is to move on to a four-year university, with either a focus in liberal arts or sciences. = International and Cultural Studies Course = The IC Course is an English co-emersion course with faculty of both Japanese and foreign teachers, and is designed for students who have an interest in foreign language and in engaging in foreign relations as a profession, either domestic or abroad. About a third of IC course students are admitted to KUFS every year. = General Academic Course = The GA Course is designed for students who require additional support in academic studies, or who wish to focus extensively on extracurricular club activities. = Sports Education Course = The Sports Education Course is designed for students who focus extensively on scholastic athletic competition, with additional studies in various athletic-related fields.  International Exchange Program  Students are offered opportunities to both study abroad and become hosts for students studying in Japan. As of 2016, KGN is engaged in sister-school relationships with 6 institutions in New Zealand and Canada, offering 1-month, 6-month, and 1-year opportunities to live and study abroad. KGN is also partnered with institutions in Malaysia, the United States, and Australia, offering short- term opportunities for either studying abroad or international exchange through various social media outlets. Also, a handful of students from around the world have experienced both short-term and long-term stays at KGN with students‚Äô families as hosts through various institutions such as the Rotary Club and AFS Intercultural Programs.

It moved to the Conservative movement, and became egalitarian in the 1980s. Eric R. Slaton became rabbi in 1999. Early history Beth Israel Synagogue () was organized by eight families in 1901 as an Orthodox alternative to Hamilton's existing synagogue, a Reform congregation on High Street that was founded in the 1880s.Jones, Richard O. \\"Beth Israel celebrates 100 years\\" , JournalNews, October 24, 2011.Beth Israel History , Synagogue website. Retrieved December 23, 2011. The founding members were Yiddish- speaking immigrants, more traditional than Hamilton's existing English speaking Jewish community of around 250 families. The new congregation initially worshiped in members' homes, and then a converted warehouse on Hamilton's East Side, at the corner of Fifth and Charles streets. In its early years was served by a series of temporary rabbis, who often also served as ritual slaughterers. It obtained a charter from the State of Ohio as Bais Israel in 1911. By 1919, under the leadership of Rabbi J.H. Goodman, the congregation comprised 42 member families. Services were held in Hebrew, and the congregation's religious school had 45 students and held classes daily.American Jewish Committee. , American Jewish Year Book, Jewish Publication Society, Volume 21 (1919‚Äì1920), p. 532. The Ladies Auxiliary was formed in 1923, and purchased land at Sixth and Butler in 1929. The congregation sold its existing building, and began worshiping at a temporary location on Main Street. That year the rabbi was Gabriel Zacuto. The current synagogue building at 50 North 6th Street was completed in 1931. It consisted of a main sanctuary, capable of seating over 200, a social hall and a kitchen. At the time the congregation had 60 member families. Visiting Zionist leaders used the new social hall to raise money for the creation of the State of Israel. The Great Depression caused the congregation significant financial distress. Zacuto's salary was cut in half, to $25 (today $) per week, and his contract was concelled. He left in 1933, and was replaced by Bernard Kalchman. The congregation opened a religious school in 1939. Post World War II Kalchman left in 1946, and was succeeded the following year by Murray Garson. Garson initiated late Friday night services, but left the following year, and was replaced by Joseph Krickstein, who served until his retirement in the 1960s. He was followed by Rabbis Dworkin, Max Newman, Portnoy and Seth Phillips. Phillips was followed by Mark Warshofsky. An addition to the synagogue building, started in 1960 and completed in 1961, included offices and classrooms. In 1964, a chapel/multi-purpose room was added. The synagogue eventually moved away from Orthodox Judaism, and joined the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism. In 1984 the congregation voted to count women in the minyan.

Founded in 1899 as Bikur Cholim, it was an Orthodox breakaway from Asheville's existing synagogue. It hired its first full-time rabbi in 1909, opened a religious school in 1911, and acquired its first building, which burnt down in 1916, in 1913. The congregation completed its second building in 1924, affiliated with Conservative Judaism in 1949, and changed its name to Beth Israel in 1950. It completed construction of its current building in 1969, and renovated it in 2018. Robert Cabelli joined as rabbi in 2006, and was succeeded by Justin Goldstein in 2014. , Goldstein was the congregation's rabbi. Early history Significant Jewish immigration to Asheville, North Carolina began in 1880, when the railroad link to Asheville was completed. The community founded Asheville's oldest synagogue, Beth HaTephila, as a \\"conservative\\" congregation in 1891, before the Conservative movement was formally founded. By 1899, however, some members of the Jewish community felt Beth HaTephila was not traditional enough, and eight of them founded Bikur Cholim as an Orthodox alternative. Bikur cholim is Hebrew for \\"visitation of the sick\\"; the name was used in recognition of the many people who came to Asheville to recuperate from tuberculosis. The congregation worshiped in a number of locations; for a period, weekly services were held in the Masonic Temple, while High Holiday services were held at the Church Street Odd Fellows Hall. Membership grew very slowly, and the congregation went through a series of rabbis whose terms were generally short. The congregation frequently had no rabbi at all, and High Holiday services were often led by lay members. Solomon Schechter came to Asheville in 1904 to assist in executing a merger of Beth HaTephila and Bikur Cholim, but the negotiations fell through. First full- time rabbi, first building In 1909, Louis Londow was hired as the congregation's first full-time rabbi, though he had to open a grocery store to make ends meet. Londow had been considered the \\"spiritual leader\\" of the congregants since 1897 (before Bikur Cholim had been formally incorporated), when two of the founding members, S.H. Michalove and B. Zageir, had brought him to Asheville from Baltimore. Described as \\"a model of civility\\", he \\"was known to remove his hat whenever he got a phone call from a woman\\". Londow served until 1912, and was succeeded as rabbi by Ellis Fox, though Londow stayed in Asheville to run his store. The congregation opened a Talmud Torah school in 1911. That year the congregation also purchased a lot on South Liberty Street for $1000 (today $), and began construction of a synagogue building. Construction took four years, but services were held in the partially constructed building starting with High Holiday services in 1912. That year, just before Rosh Hashanah, Bikur Cholim's building burned down. The total cost had been more than $11,000 (today $), of which insurance covered only $3000. A replacement building (in the same location) was not completed until 1924; its sanctuary had seating for approximately 80 worshipers. A group broke away from Bikur Cholim in 1916, forming the Anshei Yeshurun congregation. Fox left to become the rabbi of Beth HaTephila in 1917, and was succeeded by Lazarus Lehrer and then D. Hechtor. The members of Anshei Yeshurun rejoined Bikur Cholim in 1921, and the following year a Ladies' Auxiliary (now a Sisterhood) was formed; one of its duties was to bring chicken soup to Jewish patients in Asheville's tuberculosis sanatoria. Londow served again as spiritual leader in the 1920s; other rabbis included Scharfman, Goodcovitz, Kaplivitz, S. Wrubel, G. Berkman, D. Wachfogel, L. Leifer, R. Meier, and J. Seidler. Events since 1940 The synagogue continued to experience difficulty keeping Orthodox rabbis in a small Southern city; it had fourteen different spiritual leaders from 1899 to 1949, and seven from 1940 to 1953. For a number of years the congregation had been moving away from its previous traditionalism, using English (as well as Hebrew) in the prayers, and having mixed seating for men and women. In 1949, it formally affiliated with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism; that year the rabbi was Martin Kessler. Kessler had come to Bikur Cholim from England in 1948 to serve as rabbi; although the congregation liked him, his wife was not happy in Asheville, so they left in 1949. Bikur Cholim changed its name to Beth Israel in 1950. In the 1950s, the congregation also voted to shorten its Shabbat morning service and start it two hours earlier at 8:00am, so that worshipers could open their stores after services; this change was reversed in the 1970s. Alexander Gelberman joined Beth Israel as rabbi in 1956, and stayed until August 1964, when he moved to lead a synagogue in Oak Ridge Tennessee. The following November Samuel A. Friedman joined as spiritual leader. Friedman had previously served for over 20 years as rabbi of Congregation B'nai Israel in Wilmington, North Carolina. In response to rumors that the area around the Liberty Street synagogue was slated for urban renewal, Beth Israel purchased a lot at the corner of Norwood and Murdock Avenues in 1959. The Asheville Development Commission purchased the synagogue property on Liberty Street in the 1960s. After a major fundraising campaign, Beth Israel constructed its current synagogue building at 229 Murdock Avenue in 1969, dedicated by then- rabbi Samuel Friedman. The old property eventually became a parking lot of a Best Western hotel. Membership grew steadily throughout the 1980s and 1990s, from 70 families in 1980, to 100 in 1990, to almost 200 in 1999. The rabbi at that time was Shmuel Birnham. Around 2014, Beth Israel disaffiliated from the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, becoming an independent congregation. According to synagogue members, this action was taken primarily because the congregation disagreed with the Conservative movement's then limited acceptance of same-sex couples and interfaith families. Robert Cabelli joined as rabbi in August 2006. Cabelli had worked as a neurobiologist, research scientist, and professor before being ordained at the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies and joining Beth Israel. By 2009, membership remained at 200 families. Justin Goldstein joined as rabbi in January of 2014. Born and raised near Chicago, he attended Hampshire College where he produced an original translation and commentary of most of the Book of Genesis. Goldstein was ordained in 2011 by the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies. In 2015, the congregation began working on plans to renovate the building at 229 Murdock. In the fall of 2017 they temporarily moved locations to the basement of Congregation Beth HaTephila while the building was being renovated, and returned to 229 Murdock in December 2018. Membership had fallen to 150 families. NotesReferences *Congregation Beth Israel website. Accessed December 25, 2011: **History, Beth Israel website.

It was founded in Coatesville, Pennsylvania in 1904 as Kesher Israel by Eastern European immigrants, and formally chartered as \\"Beth Israel\\" in 1916. It constructed its first building in 1923, and expanded it after World War II. In 1979, Beth Israel became the first Conservative congregation to hire a woman (Linda Joy Holtzman) as a rabbi. Holtzman served until 1985, and was succeeded by Michael Charney. The congregation purchased its current property in 1989, and completed its facility there in 1995. Charney was succeeded in 2015 by Jon Cutler. Early history Beth Israel was founded in 1904 as Kesher Israel by Jewish immigrants to Coatesville, Pennsylvania from Eastern Europe. It established a Sunday school and purchased a cemetery in 1907, and was formally chartered as \\"Beth Israel\\" by the Chester County Court of Common Pleas in 1916. The congregation purchased land on Fifth Avenue and Harmony Street in Coatesville in 1923, and constructed a new synagogue building there, completed in 1924. After World War II, an extension to the building added a chapel/library and classrooms, and expanded the kitchen and social hall. Elihu Schagrin was rabbi from 1945 to 1953. Born in Wilmington, Delaware in 1918, he was ordained at the Reform Jewish Institute of Religion in 1946. During his tenure at Beth Israel he also served as chaplain of Coatesville's Veterans Hospital, and, from 1949 on, was president of the Greater Coatesville Inter- Racial Committee. In 1953 he moved to Temple Concord of Binghamton, New York. Linda Holtzman In 1979, the congregation (which now numbered 110 families) hired Linda Joy Holtzman as rabbi. She had been ordained that year by the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, and was one of thirty applicants. She became the second woman in the United States to serve as the presiding or senior rabbi of a synagogue, following Michal Bernstein. She was the first woman to serve as a rabbi for a Conservative congregation, as the Conservative movement did not then ordain women. The Reform and Reconstructionist movements had previously ordained at least ten women rabbis, but (aside from Bernstein) they all served as assistant rabbis, hospital chaplains, or directors of university campus Hillel organizations. The New York Times described her hiring as \\"a marked breakthrough for the growing numbers of women who have faced obstacles in becoming a rabbi-in-charge\\", and quoted Holtzman as saying \\"the fact that I have an appointment in a small town and that they have entrusted me with functions they believe are important is very significant for women and for the Jewish community\\". At the time, there were only 22 female rabbis in the entire world. Beth Israel hired the Reconstructionist-ordained Holtzman despite the fact that it was a Conservative synagogue. The executive vice president of the Conservative Rabbinical Assembly, Rabbi Wolfe Kelman, described the appointment as \\"an historical breakthrough and simply fantastic\\", and felt that other synagogues would be encouraged to follow suit. At the time, the Rabbinical Assembly did not accept women as members, and the Conservative movement did not ordain its first woman rabbi‚ÄîAmy Eilberg‚Äîuntil 1985. The hiring of a non-Conservative rabbi in itself was not unusual, however; due in part to a shortage of Conservative rabbis, a fifth of all Conservative synagogues in the U.S. had non-Conservative rabbis in place. While Holtzman believed in the tenets of the Reconstructionist movement, she said that members of the congregation could choose to follow either traditional or nontraditional ideas. Beth Israel's membership was 125 families by 1983, and the synagogue building also housed B'nai B'rith and Hadassah chapters. Holtzman served at Beth Israel until 1985, when her contract was up for renegotiation. She had been living in Philadelphia and commuting to Coatesville for several years; although she and her lesbian partner had had an open commitment ceremony in Philadelphia, she had not yet come out to her congregation (but despite living something of a double life, she had enjoyed her time with the synagogue and found it very rewarding). Now she informed Beth Israel's board of directors that she and her partner were planning to have children and that she wanted co-parenting leave, and by her subsequent account, each board member privately indicated they were okay with this but that the other board members were not ready for such a development. She left the synagogue and later that year became spiritual leader of Beth Ahavah, a LGBT congregation in Center City, Philadelphia. Events since 1985 Holtzman was succeeded as rabbi in 1985 by Michael Charney. The son and grandson of rabbis, he was ordained at the Reform Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati, and served congregations in Clearwater, Florida and Bowie, Maryland before coming to Beth Israel. While serving at Beth Israel, he also work as a chaplain at Norristown State Hospital, and taught Hebrew at Arcadia University. Charney retired in 2015, though continued to instruct Bar and bat mitzvah candidates, and died in 2019. The congregation purchased its current property at 385 Pottstown Pike (Route 100) in Upper Uwchlan Township in 1989. Construction on a new synagogue building there began in 1994 and completed in 1995. Designed by Callori Architects, the facility houses a sanctuary, chapel/library, and school wing. Behind the school wing is a Holocaust memorial garden. Jon Cutler became the rabbi of Beth Israel in 2015. A native of Philadelphia, he graduated from Temple University in with a Masters of Arts in Religious Studies, and was ordained by the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College. He then earned his Doctor of Ministry (Counseling) from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. He previously served in congregations in Flemington, New Jersey and Warrington, Pennsylvania. Cutler also had a long career as a chaplain for the U.S. Navy and Marines, retiring as a Naval Reserve captain on April 30, 2017, 32 years to the day after his original commission. A member of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, it holds services Friday evenings, Shabbat mornings, and on Jewish holidays. NotesReferences *Beth Israel Congregation website.

Performance and themes In \\"Johnny 99\\" Springsteen sings about an auto worker who gets laid off in Mahwah, New Jersey and shoots and kills a night clerk while drunk and distraught. As a result, he is apprehended and is sentenced to 99 years in prison, but requests to be executed instead. On the song, Springsteen is accompanied only by his acoustic guitar, although he doubles on harmonica as well. Despite the bleakness of the song's themes - including unemployment, poverty, robbery, murder and possibly execution - the tune is ironically jaunty, with a shuffling rockabilly beat. Like several other songs on the Nebraska album, \\"Johnny 99\\" is a song about complete despair. It has direct links with certain songs on Nebraska: the protagonist in \\"Johnny 99\\" notes that he has \\"debts no honest man could pay,\\" repeating a line used by the protagonist in \\"Atlantic City\\", and, like the title song, \\"Johnny 99\\" is about a murderer ‚Äî though rather than being a psychopath like the protagonist in the title song, \\"Johnny 99\\" is motivated by his economic circumstances. History Like the rest of the Nebraska album, \\"Johnny 99\\" was recorded in January 1982 in a no-frills studio set up in Springsteen's home in Colts Neck, New Jersey. Most likely it was recorded on January 3, 1982, when most of the album tracks were recorded. The background of the song is based on a real-life incident, the closing in 1980 of a Ford Motor Company plant in Mahwah, which had been open since 1955. The song also has antecedents in two folk songs that appeared on the box set Anthology of American Folk Music: Julius Daniels' \\"99-Year Blues\\" and Carter Family's \\"John Hardy Was a Desperate Little Man.\\" Despite its bleak themes, it has been a reasonably popular song in concert, with 379 live performances through May 2014. A live version was released on the album Live/1975‚Äì85. During a September 22, 1984 Born in the U.S.A. Tour concert in Pittsburgh, Springsteen used the introduction to \\"Johnny 99\\" to respond to President Reagan referencing the message of hope in Bruce Springsteen's songs, stating \\"The president was mentioning my name the other day, and I kinda got to wondering what his favorite album musta been. I don't think it was the Nebraska album. I don't think he's been listening to this one.\\" Other artists have recorded \\"Johnny 99.\\" Most famously, Johnny Cash recorded it along with another Nebraska song, \\"Highway Patrolman\\" for an album Cash entitled Johnny 99. The song has also been recorded for Bruce Springsteen covers albums by John Hiatt and Los Lobos. Punk rock band The Loved Ones covered the song on their EP, Distractions. Mark Erelli and Jeffrey Foucault also covered the song for Seven Curses, an album of murder ballads. The band Shovels & Rope covered the song as well and perform it occasionally live. It was also released as B-side of a 2006 single by UK rock band Mystic Knights of The Sea. The A-side of this single was an earlier Springsteen tune, \\"Cadillac Ranch.\\" Critical reception In praising the album Nebraska, \\"Johnny 99\\" is one of the songs that was singled out by Mikal Gilmore of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner. In discussing Springsteen's growth as a writer, he stated that \\"When Springsteen tells Charlie Starkweather and Johnny 99's tales, he neither seeks their redemption nor asks for our judgment. He tells the stories about as simply and as well as they deserve to be told - or about as unsparingly as we deserve to hear them - and he lets us feel for them what we can, or find in them what we can of ourselves.\\" Though never released as a single anywhere, \\"Johnny 99\\" garnered enough album oriented rock airplay to reach #50 on the U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

She was assigned initially to support the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, and was eventually assigned to support Allied forces in the war zones of the Pacific Ocean, resulting in her crew returning home after the war with four battle stars to their credit.  US Navy career The second ship to be so named by the Navy, Arapaho (AT-68) was laid down on 8 November 1941 at Charleston, South Carolina, by the Charleston Shipbuilding & Dry-dock Company; launched on 22 June 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Alice Posey Hatcher; and commissioned on 20 January 1943, Lt. E. H. Wootan in command. = World War II service = East coast operations  The tug conducted her shakedown training in the vicinity of Key West, Florida, and returned to Norfolk, Virginia, to prepare for a transatlantic voyage. On 19 March, she sailed for Casablanca, Morocco. There, she took the torpedo-damaged attack cargo ship Almaack (AKA-10) in tow for the voyage back to the United States. She and her charge arrived back in Norfolk, Virginia, on 20 May. In mid-June, the tug moved south to search the Florida Strait for the submarine R-12 (SS-89), which had sunk as a result of battery explosions. After fruitlessly seeking this ship from 18 to 23 June, Arapaho set sail on 25 June‚Äîapparently from Key West, Florida‚Äîwith a barge in tow on her way to Panama. She left the barge in the Panama Canal Zone and continued her voyage to San Diego, California, where she arrived on 15 July.  Pacific Ocean operations  For the next three months, the tug conducted towing and salvage operations, first along the U.S. West Coast and then, from early in September, out of Pearl Harbor. On 16 October, Arapaho departed Hawaii with two supply lighters in tow, bound for the Ellice Islands. She reached Funafuti on 30 October and began heavy towing operations between the Ellice and Gilbert Islands. For a time, she served as an antisubmarine guard ship at recently captured Tarawa Atoll. On 4 December, Arapaho embarked 12 civilians who had been liberated from a Japanese internment camp on Makin and set sail‚Äîvia Funafuti‚Äîfor Pearl Harbor. From Funafuti, the tug steamed in company with aircraft carrier Independence (CVL-22), severely damaged in the Gilbert Islands operation by an aerial torpedo. The ships arrived at Pearl Harbor on 18 December. Arapaho underwent repairs until near the end of the first week in January 1944. On 6 January, she headed back to the Gilberts. Over the next five months, the tug was based successively at Tarawa and Majuro, though she made numerous tows to other islands in the Gilbert, Marshall, and Ellice groups. By 13 June, she had moved her base of operations to Eniwetok where she engaged in harbor duty and salvage work. On 3 July, Arapaho set a course for Pearl Harbor, which she reached on the 9th to begin a month of repairs. She returned to Eniwetok on 26 August and, except for a round-trip voyage to Guam, operated there until the second week in October.  Ulithi operations  At that time, she put to sea towing auxiliary repair dock ARD-15 and covered lighter (self-propelled) YF-786 to Ulithi, Service Squadron (ServRon) 10's new advanced base, and, following her arrival at that atoll, worked in and out of its lagoon engaged in harbor and salvage duties. Between 4 and 10 November, she assisted Zuni (ATF-95) in towing Reno (CL-96) into Ulithi. The light cruiser had been torpedoed by a Japanese submarine off the San Bernardino Strait on the 3d. In December, the tug towed Houston (CL-81) from Ulithi to Manus in the Admiralty Islands. From there, she towed fuel barge YO-186 to Kossol Passage in the Palau Islands. After towing LST-278 to Guam in January 1945, Arapaho returned to Ulithi on the 23d and began a major overhaul of her main propulsion plant. The ship completed repairs and returned to active duty on 18 March.  Okinawa operations  She operated out of Ulithi until mid-June when she moved to Guam. From there, the tug headed for Okinawa on 5 July with auxiliary repair dock ARD-26 in tow. Arapaho and the auxiliary repair dock arrived in Kerama Retto 10 days later. The tug remained at Okinawa until after the end of hostilities in mid-August. Late that month, she voyaged back to Guam to pick up ARD-21 for tow to Okinawa. She returned to Kerama Retto with her charge on 7 September and resumed local towing duty. = End- of-war decommissioning = That assignment continued until 9 November 1945 when she began the long journey back to the United States. She stopped at Pearl Harbor for a few days early in December and arrived in San Pedro, California, on 27th. Arapaho remained at San Pedro assigned to the inactive fleet awaiting inactivation overhaul for a little more than a year. On 8 and 9 January 1947, she was towed to San Diego, California, where she was decommissioned on 15 January 1947. She remained with the Pacific Reserve Fleet until July 1961. On 1 July 1961, her name was struck from the Navy list. = Honors and awards = Arapaho (ATF-68) earned four battle stars during World War II.  Argentine Navy career On 10 July 1961, she was transferred to the Argentine Navy, which commissioned her that same day as ARA Comandante General Zapiola. The tug remained active with the Argentine Navy until 10 January 1976 when she ran aground on an Antarctic reef and was declared a total loss. Her crew was rescued by the Chilean patrol boat Piloto Pardo.USS Arapaho (ATF-68) NavSource Online  See also  * List of United States Navy ships * List of auxiliary ships of the Argentine Navy  Notes  References NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive - USS Arapaho (ATF-68) ‚Äì ex USS Arapaho (AT-68) (1943 - 1944)  External links  * Cherokee-class fleet tugs Ships built in Charleston, South Carolina 1942 ships World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Ships transferred from the United States Navy to the Argentine Navy Maritime incidents in 1976 ","title":"USS Arapaho (ATF-68)"},{"id":"18548731","text":"An aerial photo of Juniper Island Lighthouse during the fall season. The Juniper Island Light on Juniper Island in Vermont is the oldest light station on Lake Champlain and the oldest surviving cast iron lighthouse in the United States. History A light station was established on the island in 1826, displacing a private beacon consisting of a lantern on a post. The tower constructed was of brick, 30 feet tall, and lit with the lamp and reflector system typical of the period. The light was intended to indicate to ships the proximity of Burlington's harbor. This tower was reported to be in disrepair by 1838. A new tower, also tall, was constructed in 1846. This tower was constructed of four rings of cast iron, attached to a brick keeper's house through a passageway. This tower originally retained the old light's beacon, but was upgraded with a fourth-order Fresnel lens in 1853. Early in the next century, the island was used as a storage depot for fuel, buoys, and other items. The light was deactivated in 1954 in favor of a steel tower placed closer to the water, and the island as a whole was sold at auction to state senator Fred Fayette. Unfortunately the keeper's house was severely damaged by fire in 1962, though the tower and a separate shed for a fog bell were undamaged. Fayette's family inherited the property, and in 2001 they reconstructed the house using bricks from the remains of its predecessor. Two years later a new, taller tower replaced that of 1954. The family plans to restore the old tower, but it is unlikely to be relit (as has been done with other lights on the lake) since trees on the island obscure it from the water.

Biography Educated at the University of Queensland and the Goethe Institute, Bremen, Germany, he is the author of ten novels and short story collections, including The Lulu Magnet, A Night at the Pink Poodle, The Motorcycle Cafe, and The Pillow Fight. The Trout Opera, an epic novel that took him more than ten years to write, examines the Australian character through its chief protagonist Wilfred Lampe, a rabbiter and farm hand who spends his entire life in the township of Dalgety, on the banks of the Snowy River. The Sydney Daily Telegraph described the novel as \\"an instant classic\\". In 2013, Condon published Three Crooked Kings, the first part of a biography of former Queensland Police Commissioner Terry Lewis who was charged in 1989 and later jailed on multiple corruption charges. The book was based on Condon's extensive interviews with Lewis and others as well as archival material. Review by Sybil Nolan in the Sydney Morning Herald. The biography is continued in Jacks and Jokers (2014) and All Fall Down (2015). Condon, who now writes for The Courier-Mail and is the father of two children, is based in Brisbane, Australia.

When the show didn't catch on immediately, NBC put the show on hiatus for seven months, and then brought it back as a retooled show, For Richer, For Poorer. The second version aired from December 6, 1977, to September 29, 1978. The show was created by Harding Lemay and Paul Rauch, who were both also working for the daytime drama Another World. Lovers and Friends was considered to be an indirect spin-off of the former series, and took the place of a direct spin-off (Somerset) on the NBC schedule upon its premiere.New York Times  Lovers and Friends  The show was set in the fictional Chicago suburb of Point Clair, Illinois, and focused on the trials and tribulations of two neighboring families, the wealthy Cushings and the middle class Saxtons. Point Clair was a highly wealthy suburb, allegedly modeled after the real life community of Lake Forest, Illinois, the wealthiest of the North Shore suburbs in the Chicago Metropolitan area. The Cushings were Richard Cushing (Ron Randell), a successful stockbroker who owned a brokerage house called Cushing and Sons, who also had an affair with his secretary, Barbara Manners; his proper and high society wife, Edith (Nancy Marchand, Laurinda Barrett), who stayed in the marriage, even though she knew about and tended to tolerate Richard's infidelity; their college aged son, Austin (Rod Arrants) who was an alcoholic due to his inability to be an artist and finding out his girlfriend, Laurie Brewster was sent to Europe by her mother to break up their relationship; and their daughter, Megan (Patricia Estrin; Darlene Parks) who was unhappily engaged to wealthy and stuffy Desmond Hamilton (David Knapp). She was engaged to him, because she felt that was what was prudent for her upbringing and she feared defying her mother. Also living with and offering some sage, down-to-earth advice and also a touch of humor to the often stuffy Cushing home was Edith's mother, Sophia Slocum (Margaret Barker). It was Sophia, who wasn't constrained by wealth or societal pretensions, who counseled Megan to look into her heart and to marry for love, and not for money or societal propriety, the way she and Edith had. These words of advice from Sophia helped Megan to break off her unhappy engagement. The Cushing's new neighbors were the Saxtons, who were newcomers to Point Clair. The father, Lester (John Heffernan; Albert Stratton) was a former factory worker and alcoholic, who had recently acquired a higher paying job as a warehouse supervisor, thanks to the help of his married daughter, Eleanor Kimball (Flora Plumb) and her husband, wealthy attorney, George Kimball (Stephen Joyce), which also allowed them to purchase the house next door to the Cushings in Point Clair. He was married to the compassionate Josie (Patricia Englund) and was the father of four other children, besides Eleanor, the oldest daughter. Rhett (Bob Purvey, David Ramsey, Tom Happer), the oldest son, a professional photographer who had been engaged to longtime girlfriend, Connie Ferguson (Susan Foster, Cynthia Bostick) until he fell in love with his neighbor Megan Cushing; Jason (Richard Backus) who was somewhat conniving and scheming, always wanting to get ahead, but always meant well; youngest brother, Bentley (David Abbott) and youngest sister, Tessa (Vicky Dawson; Breon Gorman). Both Bentley and Tessa, who were in high school, felt out of place in wealthy Point Clair, and longed to return to Hammond, their former neighborhood in Chicago. In fact, of the siblings, Rhett, Jason and Ellie (as Eleanor was called) were all in approval of the move. Also living with the Saxtons was their cousin Amy Gifford (Christine Jones), who had fallen in love with Austin Cushing. (Christine Jones brought the Amy Gifford character from Another World, hence the ties to Lovers and Friends. Jones would later return to Another World as Steve Frame's sister, Janice.) The Saxtons had moved to Point Clair on the very same day that Edith had thrown an engagement party for Megan and Desmond. She was absolutely appalled at the fact that a new family had moved into the house that the Brewsters once owned, and she was upset at Viola for selling it to the Saxtons in the first place. She made it her mission to keep the lower- class Saxtons out of her family, but her efforts were for naught. The only member of the Cushings, at first, who made them feel welcome, was Sophia, who was a lot more friendly than her snobbish daughter was. After an initial bad impression, Austin and Megan became more friendly with their new neighbors and would often spend more time at their house, because they felt more at ease with the Saxtons than at their own home. Sophia, who herself became a frequent visitor to the Saxton home and became friendly with all of them, became a grandmotherly figure to the youngest Saxton daughter, Tessa. Alcoholic Austin turned to his next-door neighbor, Lester Saxton, (after his grandmother, Sophia, had confided to him about Austin's troubles) who had been through the same situations that Austin was going through, for guidance; and with his support and help, stayed off the booze and faced his problems in Point Clair. Richard had wanted Austin to go into a wealthy sanitarium to dry out, but he impressed his father by taking responsibility for his actions and remained in town to deal with his troubles, being helped along by Lester and Amy, who became his support system. This allowed Richard to become a lot more friendly with the Saxtons, although he knew that would anger his wife, Edith. Both families were astonished though, when Rhett and Megan announced their engagement. The only one, besides Rhett and Megan, who was happy about the engagement was Sophia, who was enthused that Megan had followed her advice and fell for someone she loved and not married for money or society's approval.  Retooling as For Richer, For Poorer  When the show was retooled into For Richer, For Poorer, several major changes had occurred. The show's setting was still Point Clair; Rhett's name was changed to Bill and he did marry Megan; Edith Cushing's husband Richard died, leaving her a widow; the Cushings and Saxtons, although they were now related due to Bill and Megan's marriage, were no longer neighbors; and Amy Gifford married Austin Cushing. Edith had also done a complete about-face in her relations with the Saxtons, as she was now much more friendly to them than she was in the previous incarnation. Also in the story, in both versions of the show, was the Brewster family, whose house the Saxtons had bought when they moved to Point Clair, mother Viola (Patricia Barry) and her daughter, Laurie (Julia MacKenzie). Viola and Edith used to be friends, until she sold her house to the Saxtons, angering Edith. Despite his marriage to Megan, Bill's former fiancee, Connie Ferguson, announced that she was pregnant; the father was never revealed, but it was rumored to be Bill's. Even with the story changes, the series didn't last and was cancelled in 1978.  Title sequences  When the series premiered as Lovers and Friends, the opening titles showed two large houses on a suburban street side by side, supposedly to show the Cushing house and the Saxton house as neighbors to one another. The program's title was then shown in script over the picture of the two houses. When it was rebranded as For Richer, For Poorer, the titles were changed. It showed a road with two different worlds, on the left was a leafy suburban neighborhood and on the right was an urban Chicago neighborhood. Meeting in the middle were a young couple (supposedly Megan Cushing and Bill Saxton) kissing, showing that their worlds were united. The title zoomed out and above the title, a rainbow was shown.  Famous alumni  Notable stars from the series who went on to greater fame in either daytime or primetime series, were Rod Arrants (who married his co-star, Patricia Estrin), Nancy Marchand, Patricia Barry, Christine Jones, Margaret Barker, Nancy Snyder, John Heffernan, and Patricia Englund.

Protestors have locked arms through a combination of pipes and barrels. A sleeping dragon is a maneuver used by protesters to cause disruption. It involves handcuffs and PVC pipe: a series of protesters are handcuffed together through the PVC pipe, which precludes police from simply using bolt cutters to break the handcuffs. Advanced variations include covering the PVC pipe with elements which might make it more difficult to break. Examples include chicken wire, tar, and duct tape. Another variation is filling a barrel with concrete and putting the PVC pipe through the barrel such that it cannot be accessed without first destroying all of the concrete. Often the protesters will chain, lock, or otherwise secure themselves to immovable objects, resulting in a difficult-to- remove human obstacle. This is typically accomplished best with carabiners tied to their wrists so that the protestors can easily unlock themselves, though they cannot be unlocked by outsiders. Removal methods Arkansas State Police officers being trained in the removal of a sleeping dragon, using mannequins. It is sometimes impossible for officers to know what is inside the sleeping dragon without cutting into it. Officers may cut into the pipe with such tools as an angle grinder, rotary saw, or whizzer saw, followed by a pry bar and pliers; or in the case of concrete, chipping hammers, hammer drills, and breakers. Abrasive saws, a band saw, and an angle grinder may be used on steel pipes. Officers may put fire retardant hoods and earmuffs on the protesters to protect them from sparks and noise as tools are used to cut through the sleeping dragon. Once an inspection hole has been made, it may be possible to reach in with bolt cutters and cut the handcuff chain. In 2018, Seattle police established an Apparatus Removal Team (ART) in response to sleeping dragon protests, its officers being trained and equipped to cut through plastic and metal without injuring protesters. Their approach involves cutting into tubing and placing a brightly-colored piece of plastic against the protester's skin, so that the blade will produce visible plastic shavings before it can cause any injury.

Club career Born in Piraeus, Greece, Yiannis began his career at the age of 18, playing for home town club Peiraikos Syndesmos FC. Here Yiannis earned his first taste of success, winning an unofficial Greek Championship in 1923. Peiraikos Syndesmos FC merged with Peiraiki Enosis FC in January 1924 and the Athletic and Football Club of Piraeus was formed. Yiannis was part of the new team and helped them win the 1924 Athens-Piraeus championship. Olympiacos FC The same year around autumn, the new club split in two different squads: One team, led by the Andrianopoulos brothers and goalkeeper Kostas Klidouchakis, formed Olympiakos Omilos, which evolved into Olympiakos FC;http://www.andrianopoulos.gr/xmsAssets/File/Osfp/PDFs/history.pdf the other, led by Kostas Ferlemis, Christos Peppas and Giorgos Hadjiandreou merged, with an independent club named \\"Young Boys\\" to form Peiraikos Omilos, which in turn evolved into Ethnikos Peiraios FC. Following a series of mergers between other Piraeus and Athens based clubs, as well as an Athens football Championship, Yiannis and his brothers went on to create Olympiacos FC in March 1925. Yiannis, Giorgios, Dinos and Vasilis, Leonidas went on to make the newly formed Piraeus Club famous throughout Greece.https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/grizano/History.htm&date;=2009-10-25+23:32:31 Two other brothers, Aristides and Stelios Andrianopoulos, were playing in other Piraeus football clubs. Yiannis was the oldest of seven brothers who, like him, would go on to become famous footballers in the Olympiacos' ranks. As a result, Yiannis and his brothers earned Olympiacos the name Thrylos meaning \\"Legend\\" in Greek, a nickname which the club carries to this day. Yiannis was certainly the brother who made the biggest impact towards the club, even becoming a player-coach; Olympiacos' first coach, from 1925 until 1927. In 1929, Yiannis retired from football, and became Olympiacos' president for 3 years. International Yiannis played for the national side for the 1920 Olympic Games His brother Giorgos was a member of the team too. His brothers at Olympiakos also played for Greece in 1929 and 1930.

It is a loose adaptation of Martin McGartland's 1997 autobiography of the same name. It premiered in September 2008, and stars Jim Sturgess as Martin McGartland, a British agent who went undercover into the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), and Ben Kingsley as Fergus, his British handler. The film is set from 1988 until 1991, the time in which McGartland acted as an undercover agent within the IRA during The Troubles. In 1991, his cover was blown and he was kidnapped by the IRA, although he later escaped from an interrogation and execution, and went into hiding. At the time of the release of the film, McGartland was still in hiding. The film takes its name from McGartland's claim within his book to have saved the lives of fifty people (police officers, soldiers, and prison guards) during his time as an agent. Plot Martin McGartland is a 21-year-old street hustler in Northern Ireland in the late 1980s. The Irish Republican Army wants to recruit him, but he is reluctant because of what he sees as their cruel street justice. Because of his connection to the community, the British police want him to infiltrate and spy on the IRA. Marty agrees because of the car and money he gets from the police and because he despises the IRA. The IRA accepts him as a Volunteer and in that position he learns of various planned attacks. He then informs Fergus, his police contact, to prevent these attacks. He builds up a new sense of self-esteem, but he cannot tell his family and friends about his activities. Even his new girlfriend Lara only notices that he seems to do some work for the IRA, which worries her. All along, the British accept the risk that the IRA may discover that Marty works for them. They do not plan to rescue him in that case. When it happens, the IRA capture and torture Marty, but he manages to escape by throwing himself out of a window. His handler Fergus is now his only ally‚Äîhe finds him and helps him hide. Fergus offers to arrange for Marty and Lara and their children to live in Scotland but Marty realises that she would never be able to feel safe. He then goes on the run to Canada alone, leaving his family behind. As shown at the start of the film, he is shot there by the IRA and survives.

One of the few turkeys not primarily selected for meat production, the Royal Palm is best known as an ornamental bird with a unique appearance, largely white with bands of metallic black. Primarily kept as an exhibition bird, or on small farms, it lacks the size for large scale commercial use. Toms usually weigh 16 to 22 lbs and the hens 10 to 12 lbs. A relative newcomer among turkey breeds, the bird first appeared in the 1920s on a farm in Lake Worth, Florida, apparently as a cross between Black, Bronze, Narragansett, and native turkeys. Years of selective breeding followed to stabilize the coloring, and the Royal Palm was finally accepted by the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection in 1971. In Europe, a turkey with similar coloration is sometimes called the Cr√∂llwitzer, Pied, or Black-laced White. Along with the decline of most heritage turkey breeds after the adoption of the Broad Breasted White by the turkey industry, Royal Palms are a very endangered breed today. The breed is classified as being on \\"watch\\" status with the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy. It is also included in Slow Food USA's Ark of Taste, a catalog of heritage foods in danger of extinction. The Australian and United States both report the breed as Endangered to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The toms are noted for being non-aggressive, and the hens are particularly good mothers.

Set in the American South against the backdrop of the Antebellum South and the American Civil War, the film tells the story of a small-town Midwestern teacher and poet named John Shawnessy, who meets and marries a beautiful Southern belle named Susanna Drake; however, her emotional instability leads to the destruction of their marriage. The leading roles are played by Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor, Eva Marie Saint, and Lee Marvin. In July 1947, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had purchased the film rights of Ross Lockridge Jr's unpublished manuscript for Raintree County for $150,000. Carey Wilson was immediately signed as producer, and prominent actors were considered for leading roles. In January 1948, the book was released and became a national bestseller. In the following year, filming was delayed for two years as the project had grown too expensive. In 1955, the project was revived with Taylor and Clift signed for the two leading roles. Filming began in April 1956 and wrapped in October 1956. It would also mark the first use of a 65-millimeter widescreen process originally called MGM Camera 65. Raintree County had its world premiere at the Brown Theatre in Louisville, Kentucky on October 2, 1957. In December 1957, the film was given a wide release in the United States, where it received mixed reviews from film critics, who praised the production values and the performances of Clift and Taylor, but were critical of the film's plot. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards for Best Actress (Taylor), Art Direction‚ÄìSet Decoration, Best Costume Design, and Best Score. Plot In 1859, idealist John Wickliff Shawnessey (Montgomery Clift), a resident of Raintree County, Indiana, is distracted from his high school sweetheart Nell Gaither (Eva Marie Saint) by Susanna Drake (Elizabeth Taylor), a rich New Orleans girl. He has a brief and passionate affair with Susanna while she is visiting. Following her return to the South, she comes back to Indiana to tell Shawnessey she is pregnant with his child. John marries her out of honor and duty, leaving Nell heartbroken. They travel south to visit Susanna's family. He learns that Susanna's mother went insane and died in a suspicious fire, along with Susanna's father and Henrietta, a slave implied as being the father's concubine. Susanna suspects that Henrietta may have been her biological mother. Gradually Susanna appears to be suffering from mental illness. She tells John that she faked pregnancy to trick him into marriage. An abolitionist in the South, Shawnessey does not fit in with Susanna's family, and they return to Raintree County before the outbreak of the Civil War. John works as a teacher and they have a child, Jimmy, born at the outbreak of the war. In the war's third year, Susanna develops severe paranoia and delusions. She flees Indiana with Jimmy and seeks refuge among her extended family in Georgia. Shawnessey is determined to find her and recover his son. He enlists in the Union Army in hopes of encountering his wife and child. After fighting in terrible battles, he finds Jimmy at an old plantation and learns that Susanna has been placed in an insane asylum. He is wounded while carrying Jimmy back to Northern lines, and is discharged from the Union Army. Johnny searches for Susanna, finding her kept in terrible conditions at the asylum. He brings her back with him to Raintree County. After the end of the war and President Abraham Lincoln's assassination, Shawnessey considers his future. Nell urges him to run for political office. Recognizing that Nell and John still love each other, Susanna sacrifices herself and deludedly enters the nearby swamp in the middle of the night to find the legendary raintree. Four-year-old Jimmy follows her. The search party eventually finds her body. John and Nell find Jimmy alive and carry him out of the swamp, failing to see the tall rain tree glowing in the sunlight.

Two days later, the studio had purchased the film rights for $150,000. With a preliminary budget of $6 million, screenwriter Carey Wilson had been signed as the producer. He stated he had Lana Turner, Ava Gardner, and Janet Leigh in mind for the female roles while Robert Walker and Keenan Wynn were being considered for the leading male roles. On the studio's shortlist, Van Heflin and Gene Kelly were also being considered. Less than a year later, in March 1948, Lockridge Jr. was found dead inside his garage. His death was ruled a suicide from carbon monoxide poisoning. It was also reported that he had been working with the studio on the film adaptation. However, in August 1949, Wilson wrote a letter addressed to Lockridge's widow that the project had been delayed for two years. He wrote, \\"The book, to be filmed as I want it filmed and as the quality of the writing demands it be filmed, will cost more than $6,000,000 and the situation today does not permit such an expenditure.\\" In August 1955, the project had been revived by MGM production head executive Dore Schary with David Lewis being hired as producer. Elizabeth Taylor had been cast as Susannah Drake and Millard Kaufman was hired to write the script.Schallert, Edwin. (September 26, 1955). \\"'Raintree County' May Cost $8,000,000; Curtis Company Formed.\\" Los Angeles Times. Part III, pg. 9 ‚Äì via Newspapers.com. In December of the same year, Montgomery Clift had signed a three-picture deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer with Raintree County to be filmed first. By January 1956, Eva Marie Saint had been offered $100,000 to co-star in Raintree County. Rod Taylor actively campaigned for his role in the film. =Filming= Raintree County was shot at various locations, including Dunleith and Elms Court antebellum mansions, Windsor Ruins, in Natchez, Mississippi; Reelfoot Lake in northwest Tennessee near the Kentucky border; and two locations in Kentucky, the Liberty Hall Historic Site on Wilkinson Street in Frankfort and settings in and near Danville. During filming, Montgomery Clift was injured and nearly killed in a serious automobile accident. On the evening of May 12, 1956, feeling tired and suffering from a hangover, he drove into a telephone pole and wrecked his car. He broke his nose, cut his lip, and fractured his jaw in three places, which had to be wired back together by surgery. As a result, the studio announced that production had been shut down for two to three weeks. At the time, the filming crew had moved to do two months of location shooting throughout most of the Deep South. A week later, after Clift had been discharged from the hospital, filming was further delayed until early July as the studio believed he (Clift) would be able to return to work within three weeks. Although he spent weeks in surgery and recovery, he returned to finish the film. The physical damage to his face was apparent in several scenes filmed after the accident; the left side of his face was partially paralyzed. His performance in the scenes shot after the accident was also markedly different from those shot before; he began to drink heavily and take a concoction of drugs which made his face more haggard and gave his eyes a furtive look, and affected his attitude and posture. Edward Dmytryk later revealed in his autobiography It's a Hell of a Life but Not a Bad Living that he found \\"a hundred containers\\" of every kind of drug and \\"a beautiful leather case fitted with needles and syringes\\" in Clift's hotel room and once found him so drunk that his cigarette had burned itself out between his fingers. During filming in Danville, Clift's behavior grew increasingly erratic and bizarre, ordering his steak \\"blue-rare\\" (nearly uncooked) and adding masses of butter and pepper and eating it with his fingers, and running naked through the town, which resulted in a policeman being stationed outside his hotel room door to prevent him leaving during the night. Elizabeth Taylor also had problems during the production with her period clothing, and on one occasion she collapsed from hyperventilation and was treated with Clift's bottle of Demerol and a syringe, delivered by the doctor. She took over a week to also recover from tachycardia following the incident. On set she was often late for filming and preoccupied with her romance with Mike Todd, who hired a commercial airliner to personally deliver some expensive presents to her in Danville. Raintree County was the first film shot in a 65-millimeter widescreen process originally called MGM Camera 65, later renamed Ultra Panavision 70; it was also used for MGM's 1959 version of Ben Hur. Although MGM expected to release the film in 70mm, the studio ultimately opted not to as the only projectors at the time were being used to screen Mike Todd's Around the World in 80 Days. Due to the major delays in filming due to the issues with Clift and Taylor and the extravagant sets, the film was the most expensive US-based film in MGM's history, and Dmytryk never directed for MGM again. Though a success at the box office, it did not recoup its cost.Stephen Vagg, Rod Taylor: An Aussie in Hollywood, Bear Manor Media, 2010 p54 Release On January 24, 1957, Dmytryk, Lewis, Joseph Vogel, and numerous studio executives drove out to Santa Barbara, California to preview the film at the Granada Theater. The film ran for three hours and six minutes, and it had reportedly received a favorable response from an audience of 1,100 spectators. However, by March 1957, following numerous previews, MGM announced that reshoots would begin that same month so \\"that certain dramatic points will be emphasized by re-shooting in close-up and that extra footage will be added to achieve smoother transitions in the sprawling drama.\\" About 5,000 attendees arrived in Louisville, Kentucky for the film's world premiere at the Brown Theatre on October 2, 1957. It was the climax of two days of festivities which included a parade of limousines featuring stars from the film, receptions, and a costume ball held at the Freedom Hall Coliseum. The next month, it was reported that fifteen minutes would be cut from the film for its general release. For the film's wide release, Panavision president Robert Gottschalk stated Raintree County would be released in certain theaters on large-format 70mm film prints for roadshow theatrical engagements and on standard 35mm film prints. Reception=Critical reaction= Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote \\"It has a beautiful, costly production that is projected onto the screen in a sharp photographic process called Camera 65. It has a farcy cast of performers, headed by Elizabeth Taylor, Montgomery Clift, Eva Marie Saint and Nigel Patrick. And it has a busy musical score by Johnny Green. But Millard Kaufman's screenplay is a formless amoeba of a thing, and therein lies the fatal weakness of this costly, ambitious film.\\" Harrison's Reports felt \\"The picture is, in fact, so verbose that one loses its drift of the story unless he pays close attention to the dialogue. One of the shortcomings in the story is the fact that the motivations of some of the characters, particularly the hero, are not too clear, making for a vagueness that diminishes its dramatic impact...The acting of the entire cast is first-rate, and there are numerous scenes that are most effective dramatically, but on the whole the story falls short of the production's impressive visual beauty.\\" Similarly, Variety described the film as \\"a big picture in terms of pictorial size but the story doesn't always match the scope of the production. Chief story fault lies in its vagueness‚Äîthe not truly specified motivations of the principals and in the conflicts involved in Clift's search for happiness alternately with Miss Saint and Miss Taylor.\\" Among contemporary reviews, Geoff Andrew of Time Out called the film an \\"elephantine bore\\". On the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 11% based on 9 reviews with an average rating of 5.19/10. =Box office= According to MGM records, the film earned $5,830,000 in North America and $3,250,000 internationally.

At the time, Iran Air Flight 291 was the deadliest aircraft disaster in Iranian history.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved was Boeing 727-86 with registration EP-IRD (factory no. 19817, serial no. 537) was built in 1968 and made its first flight on February 17. The aircraft was powered by three Pratt & Whitney JT8D-7B turbofan engines.  Accident  On the day of the accident, Iranian air traffic controllers went on strike, which led to hundreds of domestic flights being cancelled. Then at 16:00 the strike was interrupted, and flights resumed. At 17:40, Flight 291 departed from Mashad Airport bound for Tehran-Mehrabad Airport in Iran. There were 8 crew members and 120 passengers on board (initial reports stated that there were 8 crew members and 116 passengers). At 18:52 local time, the controller at Mehrabad airport in Tehran gave the crew a direct approach to the runway 29. Then at about 19:05, the dispatcher instructed the crew to take a 360¬∞ heading to reach the non-directional beacon of the Varamin approach. Without receiving instructions from the controller, the pilots were 17 miles to the north off course. During the approach, the first officer told the captain that the VORTAC was giving the wrong radial course, but he did not respond to this message. At 19:11 local time, the aircraft collided with the Alborz Mountains, north of Tehran. All 8 crew members and 120 passengers died in the incident, and the plane was destroyed.128 feared dead in Iran Air Crash  Cause  Investigators concluded that the probable cause of the crash was believed to be an inoperable instrument landing system and ground radar. The head of Iran's Civil Aviation Authority and five other officials were charged with manslaughter as a result of the crash of Flight 291.

Shepaug Valley School is the only public secondary school of Regional School District 12, which serves Washington, Bridgewater, and Roxbury.\\"STRATEGIC SCHOOL PROFILE 2012-13 Elementary School K-6 Edition Booth Free School.\\" Regional School District 12. Retrieved on January 20, 2017. It was formerly two separate schools, Shepaug Valley Middle School (SVMS) and Shepaug Valley High School (SVHS). It was chosen as Connecticut's only public high school to receive the blue-ribbon school in 1998, and one of two in New England. History Prior to 2000 the school received block scheduling. In 2012 the superintendent of the school district, Dr. Patricia Cosentino, wanted to establish a \\"flexible schedule\\" (using elements of both block and traditional scheduling) regime for both the middle and high schools, and therefore end block scheduling for high school students. The high school parent council opposed the plan. In 2012 there were about 320 students in the high school, and the enrollment was decreasing. Ground plan Shepaug is a one-floor building housed on an campus. Since the space is shared with students of Shepaug Valley Middle School, who have their own wing in the building, high school students take academic courses in their own section of the building, a long hallway off of which classrooms branch. The rest of the building is shared between middle and high school students. It consists of a cafeteria, a large, central cavity known as \\"the mall\\", a library resource center with more than 10,000 print volumes, gymnasium, planetarium, swimming pool, band and choir practice rooms, fine arts, auto, and woodworking shops, and a professionally equipped theatre. Outdoors on campus, there is a peace pole and reflection area, a swing-set, a pond, and a memorial to former student Tam Farrow. Shepaug also hosts soccer and field hockey fields, a competitive cross country trail, and a track that was recently under renovation. Features Because of its small size, Shepaug is able to provide a number of unique events and services for its students. The most defining of these features is the Senior Project, a year-long course taken during the senior year which results in the student's presentation of a project, performance, or event. Past senior projects have ranged from humanitarian work for http://www.progeriaresearch.org/senior_project_produces_awareness_and_funds_for_prf.html The Progeria Research Foundation to artistic endeavours such as CD production http://www.relatednotes.com/sfom/news_archive_1.htm CD production and even athletic events.

The 1400GTR was introduced in September 2007 and is based on the ZX-14 platform. It replaces the original GTR1000 (Concours), which was built from 1986 to 2006. Etymology The American model name \\"Concours\\" is derived from a gathering of prestigious vehicles in a contest of elegance, such as the French Concours d'Elegance and is pronounced with a silent s, /kawn-koor/. Technology The engine is a transverse-mounted 16-valve inline-four with a displacement of . It has variable valve timing, derived from a Mitsubishi Motors car engine, which allows the phasing of the intake camshaft to be advanced by up to 24¬∞. This continuous alteration happens progressively as the rpm rise and fall. The fuel injected engine on the 2008 and 2009 models has a power output of at 8,800 rpm and produces torque of at 6,200 rpm. The ram-air intake increases power to . Tetra Lever rear drive system The bike's rear suspension-drive system is known as Tetra-Lever and is similar to the BMW Paralever and Moto Guzzi CARC systems. It is designed to handle the conflicting drive and suspension forces (known as shaft effect) typical when shaft-driven motorcycles carry powerful engines. Both the original Concours and the Concour 14 have a slipper clutch that lets the rear wheel freewheel to lessen the risk of sliding when the rider uses excessive engine braking. The 1400GTR is fitted with a keyless ignition, KIPASS (Kawasaki's Intelligent Proximity Activation Start System), which means that no key is needed to start the bike as long as the rider is carrying the coded transponder--typically in a pocket. From launch the 1400GTR had the option of an anti-lock braking system (ABS). In 2010, Kawasaki added KTRC, a traction control system, and replaced the previous ABS systems with K-ACT (Kawasaki Advanced Coactive-braking Technology), an improved system with power-assisted brake force redistribution. K-ACT is also a combined braking system in which both the front and rear brakes are applied in differing amounts depending on whether the front brake lever or rear brake pedal is used. The rider is able to select, using a handlebar switch, the amount of front brake force applied when the rear brake pedal is used. The traction control uses the ABS sensors to detect when the front and rear wheel speeds differ--reducing rear wheel speed by telling the engine management system to reduce power output. Performance Motorcycle Consumer News tested a 2011 Concours 14's top speed at , and the bike's time at 10.56 seconds at . They recorded a time of 2.91 seconds, and of 6.56 seconds. With ABS enabled they achieved a braking distance of . With at 8,750 rpm and a wet weight of , the power to weight ratio is 1:5.12. Model history=2008-2009= The 2008 model year was launched in late 2007. =2010= 2010 model with revised fairing and higher mirrors For 2010, Kawasaki made significant revisions including adding KTRC traction control and K-ACT ABS and brake assist, as well as linked brakes which are optional in some markets and standard in others. The 2010 model has revised bodywork to improve engine cooling and reduce engine heat to the rider, mirrors raised by , the dashbord top was redesigned with vents to help relieve back pressure, a larger wind screen and with memory function and auto-lowering, a heat shield across the midsection of the exhaust pipe, a handlebar-mounted switch to control the dash computer, variable heated grips, an optional \\"Fuel Economy Assistance Mode\\" that tells the ECU to use a leaner, more economical air-fuel ratio only selectable less than 6,000 rpm and road speed less than , an \\"Economical Riding Indicator\\" was added to the dashboard. The tank-mounted storage area was removed and replaced with an auto-locking glove box in the left fairing, the exhaust silencer cap was changed, the two color seat was replaced a single color model, the instrument cluster illumination was changed from red to white, an ambient outdoor temperature display option was added to the computer display, included key sets were changed from two active fobs/keys to one active fob/key and one passive mini fob/key, the front fork fluid levels were increased by 25ml, and the oil pan was modified so that the drain plug faces forward instead of downward to prevent damage. The ECU was programmed to limit top speed to 154 mph. The rear pannier covers were fully painted (instead of leaving a black area at the bottom). Many people refer to the 2010+ models as the 2nd generation (or \\"Gen 2\\") of the C14. =2011= No significant changes were made between the 2010 and 2011 models, although ABS became standard. The front rotors were slightly redesigned. =2012-2014= Starting with the 2012 model, the front rotors were changed slightly to have a smaller carrier to resist warping and Kawasaki started painting the wheels black instead of silver. In 2014 the tire pressure sensors were redesigned with \\"potted\\" circuit boards, making battery replacement impractical. =2015-2017= Kawasaki made numerous minor changes in 2015 that include a revised first gear ratio that is shorter to take advantage of the massive torque for smoother starts, revised fuel mapping to match the transmission and catalyzer changes, different steering stem seal for lighter steering at low speed, stiffer rear suspension for enhanced carrying capacity, an adjustable vent in the windshield, revised ABS programming to reduce the linked braking effect, a new rear luggage base, silver bezels on the analog dash meters, elongated mid-pipe heat shield, change of warning lamp color from red to yellow, tank pad, cushions on passenger pegs, and a revised seat that is narrower at the front with a flatter seat area that will allow riders to reach to the ground. There is also an Accessory Touring Seat for even greater comfort. The revised parts should all be backwards compatible with previous model years. Kawasaki also shifted the North American models to use the oxygen sensor that had previously only been used in the other world markets. 2015 Kawasaki Concours 14 Brochure =2018-2021= Unchanged. Starting with the 2018 model year, the 1400GTR (along with over a dozen Kawasaki models) was discontinued in the European, Asian, Australian, and Brazilian markets; remaining available only in the American, Canadian, and Latin American markets.

Background Due to the exhaustion of both armies in conflict after the long 1813 campaign and the battles of El Membrillar and Quechereguas, the arrival of the English captain of HMS Phoebe, James Hillyar with instructions from the Viceroy of Peru Jos√© Fernando de Abascal to negotiate with the rebels was considered opportune. The treaty was signed on the banks of the Lircay River, about outside the city of Talca by the commander of the Royal Armies in the province of Concepci√≥n, brigadier Gabino Ga√≠nza, and the representatives of the Chilean Supreme Director Francisco de la Lastra, brigadiers Bernardo O'Higgins and Juan Mackenna. It was during these negotiations that O'Higgins met Jos√© Antonio Rodr√≠guez Aldea, who was the secretary of the Royalist Commander, and who later went on to become O'Higgins' minister of finance and one of the main causes of his unpopularity and eventual downfall. The agreement The treaty was composed of 16 articles, plus a preamble. In the preamble, the treaty laid all blame for the destruction of the Kingdom on the Carrera family (without directly naming them). In the document proper the patriots reaffirmed their loyalty to King Ferdinand VII, defined Chile as an integral part of the Spanish monarchy, and promised to financially help the Spanish treasury within the economic possibilities of the country, to send deputies to the Cortes of C√°diz, to abandon the use of their own flag and re-adopt the royal standard and to pull back all patriot troops north of the Lontu√© River. The royalists on the other hand accepted the existence of a Chilean provisional government, and committing to vacate the city of Talca, withdraw most of their forces south of the Maule River and leave the Province of Concepci√≥n. The treaty also included other general dispositions such as the end of all acts of war between both armies, the exchange of prisoners of war, the restitution of all properties confiscated by the Chileans to the Royalist supporters and the payment of the debts incurred by the Royal Army in their Chilean campaign. Results Everything indicated that the treaty was nothing else except a way in which both sides could obtain a truce. Ga√≠nza did not abandon his positions by the agreed date, nor did the rebels live up to the agreement. The only practical results of the treaty were that it caused a cease-fire and created a de facto frontier on the Maule River. After the signature of the treaty, the patriots did not move north of the Lontu√© River and remained garrisoned in Talca. On the other hand, Brigadier Ga√≠nza retreated to Chill√°n but did not leave the area by the time agreed, deciding instead to remain in the city waiting for reinforcements. When his officers remonstrated him for his former concessions, he calmed them down by telling them that he had no intention of complying with those parts of the agreement. In addition, the treaty specified that war prisoners would be released but this measure didn‚Äôt apply to the Carrera brothers who had been captured on March 4 by one of his militia units, commanded by Clemente Lanta√±o. The patriots had inserted a secret clause that established that these men would be handed over to the government and deported later on, due to the political instability that their freedom implied. Nevertheless, Ga√≠nza freed Jos√© Miguel Carrera and Luis Carrera. Upon their arrival to Santiago, Jos√© Miguel Carrera refused to accept the agreements of Lircay and started his second (third for some authorities) dictatorship by deposing Supreme Director Lastra via a coup of State on July 23. In the meantime, Viceroy Abascal was infuriated when he read the text of the Treaty and removed Ga√≠nza from command, replacing him with Brigadier Mariano Osorio and sending the latter to Chile at the head of a new expedition of 5,000 men. Not content with that, he had Ga√≠nza court martialed in Lima, accused of exceeding his orders. Carrera's seizure of power was not accepted by O‚ÄôHiggins, who along with his troops marched towards Santiago, being defeated in the Battle of Tres Acequias (August 26) by soldiers commanded by Luis Carrera. Immediately after the battle, the news of the arrival of the Osorio expedition filtered and this obligated the supporters of O‚ÄôHigginis and of Carrera to stop their infights to unite themselves in the defense of the revolution. However, the patriot forces succumbed before the royalists in the disaster of Rancagua (October 2), which forced most of the patriots to emigrate to Mendoza.

He was probably from Monz√≥n near the border with Catalonia, but he may have hailed from Monz√≥n de Campos in Castile, as Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal believed. He is the subject of the eighth stanza of a famous satire of twelve troubadours by Peire d'Alvernhe. This stanza has different readings: The verse is very unclear. The first reading suggests that Raymond V of Toulouse had heard Pere sing. If Pattison's reconstruction of events surrounding Peire d'Alvernhe's satire is correct, however, Pere de Monts√≥ was attached to the Spanish entourage (possibly as a jongleur) of Eleanor, daughter of Henry II of England and fianc√©e of Alfonso VIII of Castile, who was travelling through Gascony on her way to Spain when she and her entourage were entertained by Peire's satire. Pattison suggest on the basis of this stanza that the troupe had also travelled through the lands of Toulouse and met in the presence of the Count, whose whereabouts at the time are otherwise unrecorded. On the second reading, it is clear that Raymond V is alleged to have composed a tune that was subsequently used by Pere, but whether it was stolen from Pere by a third party or whether Pere was considered a thief for using another's melody is not clear.

He was a prolific writer for Chinese newspapers and other publications, championing socio-political issues, and exposing evils by mercenary businessmen and the Japanese government during the Japanese occupation of Singapore. Lee was a reporter, before and after the war. He was an altruistic man who worked out of his interest in social commentary work, and wrote pr bono for local Chinese newspapers. From 1945 to his death, Lee wrote a total of 132 articles for local newspapers. Through his articles Lee obtrusively voiced his opinions, and offended many important people in the Malayan society. For instance, he once wrote about wealthy people who had a penchant of \\"donating a dollar, and expecting 3 dollars' worth of recognition of patriotism, charity, and generosity\\". As a result, Lee adopted different pen-names to have his work published. Lee died of illness in 1947 at the age of 34. Upon his death, the local literary circle honoured him with an elaborate funeral, and a commemorative feature in the Chinese newspapers, honoring him with the title of Singapore Cultural Warrior. Fang left behind his wife Liu Peh Chin, son Lee Yew Keng and daughters Lee Yew Koon and Lee Yew Hu.

In 1935 he discovered the possible interpretation of Boolean algebra of logic in electro-mechanical relay circuits. He graduated from Moscow State University (1934) and worked there in the General Physics Department almost until his death. Shestakov proposed a theory of electric switches based on Boolean logic earlier than Claude Shannon (according to certification of Soviet logicians and mathematicians Sofya Yanovskaya, M.G. Gaaze-Rapoport, Roland Dobrushin, Oleg Lupanov, Yu. A. Gastev, Yu. T. Medvedev, and Vladimir Andreevich Uspensky), though Shestakov and Shannon defended Theses the same year (1938) and the first publication of Shestakov's result took place only in 1941 (in Russian). In the early 20th century, relay circuits began to be more widely used in automatics, defense of electric and communications systems. Every relay circuit schema for practical use was a distinct invention, because the general principle of simulation of these systems was not known. Shestakov's credit (and independently later Claude Shannon's) is the general theory of logical simulation, inspired by the rapidly increasing complexity of technical demands. Logical simulation requires solid mathematical foundations. Namely these foundations were originally established by Shestakov. Shestakov set forth an algebraic logic model of electrical two-pole switches (later three- and four-pole switches) with series and parallel connections of schematic elements (resistors, capacitors, magnets, inductive coils, etc.). Resistance of these elements could take arbitrary values on the real-number line, and upon the two-element set {0, ‚àû} this degenerates into the bivalent Boolean algebra of logic. Shestakov may be considered as a forerunner of combinatorial logic and its application (and, hence, Boolean algebra of logic as well) in electric engineering, the 'language' of which is broad enough to simulate non- electrical objects of any conceivable physical nature. He was a pioneer of study of merged continual algebraic logic (parametrical) and topological (structural) models.

She and another troubled male teen got caught while they were joy-riding with a stolen car that they crashed. That joy-ride and the subsequent crash were enough for the judge hearing Groda's case, who had no choice but to incarcerate Mary. A social worker took an interest in Mary, who was sixteen years of age by that time, and realized that she struggled with dyslexia. She then helped Mary excel in studies.

Behavioral theories=Introduction= Depression is a significant mental illness with physiological and psychological consequences, including sluggishness, diminished interest and pleasure, and disturbances in sleep and appetite. It is predicted that by the year 2030, depression will be the number one cause of disability in the United States and other high-income countries. Behavioral theories of depression emphasize the role maladaptive actions play in the onset and maintenance of depression. These theories stem from work concerning the principles of learning and conditioning from the early to mid-1900s. Ivan Pavlov and B. F. Skinner are often credited with the establishment of behavioral psychology with their research on classical conditioning and operant conditioning, respectively. Collectively, their research established that certain behaviors could be learned or unlearned, and these theories have been applied in a variety of contexts, including abnormal psychology. Theories specifically applied to depression emphasize the reactions individuals have to their environment and how they develop adaptive or maladaptive coping strategies. =Behavioral activation= Behavioral activation (BA) is an idiographic and functional approach to depression. It argues that people with depression act in ways that maintain their depression and locates the origin of depressive episodes in the environment. While BA theories do not deny biological factors that contribute to depression, they assert that it is ultimately the combination of a stressful event in an individual's life and their reaction to the event that produces a depressive episode. Individuals with depression may display socially aversive behaviors, fail to engage in enjoyable activities, ruminate on their problems, or engage in other maladaptive activities. According to BA theory, these behaviors most often function as avoidance mechanisms while the individual tries to cope with a stressful life event, resulting in a decrease in positive reinforcers or perceived control. Rumination is particularly important in the onset of depression. There are two main coping mechanisms, rumination and distraction. Ruminators spend time focusing on the stressful event and their feelings, while distractors engage in activities that distance them from the event and their feelings. Ruminators are much more likely to become depressed than distractors. =Social skills= Deficits in social skills and positive social interactions have been empirically proven to be main contributors to the maintenance of depression. Individuals with depression typically interact with others less frequently than non-depressed persons, and their actions are typically more dysfunctional. One theory of social skills revolves around the lack of interaction-seeking behaviors displayed by the depressed individual. This lack of interaction results in social isolation that furthers the development of a negative self-concept, loneliness, and isolation. An alternative social skills theory attributes problems within interactions with the maintenance of depression. The \\"pro-happiness social norm\\" causes people to approach social interactions with the expectation of a positive exchange; however, individuals with depression typically violate these expectations. The lack of responsiveness displayed by individuals with depression becomes annoying to their interaction partners, causing the interaction partners to either avoid interactions with the depressed individual or to approach them more negatively in future interactions, generating a self-fulfilling prophecy of continued negative social interactions for both individuals. The depressed individual often sends ambiguous social cues that result in a misinterpretation by their interaction partner, such as a lack of responsiveness that can be interpreted as personal aversion. This misinterpretation leads to a decrease of positive interactions, resulting in a further decreased in social interactions, facilitating the maintenance of depression. =Reinforcement contingencies= Reinforcement contingencies theory asserts that depression results from a loss of adequate reward contingencies. Specifically, when positive behaviors are no longer rewarded in ways that are perceived to be adequate, those behaviors occur less frequently and, eventually, become extinct. The eventual extinction of a large spectrum of behaviors reduces the behavioral repertoire of the individual, resulting in the lack of responsiveness and arousal associated with depression. The loss or ineffectiveness of reinforcement can be attributed to a variety of causes: *The reinforcing event may be removed. This is typically related to the loss of an important or rewarding role, such as a job. *The behavioral capabilities of the affected individual may be reduced. This relates to the ability the individual has to perform activities that previously elicited positive reinforcement. This may be affected by such events as a traumatic injury or event. *The number of events that are rewarding may be reduced. This is typically linked to the biological aspects of depression, including a deficit in serotonin and dopamine that results in reduction of positive emotions during previously rewarding experiences. After the removal of reinforcers, the affected individual begins to interpret their behavior as meaningless due to the lack of obvious consequences. This interpreted lack of control in a given domain is typically generalized, developing into learned helplessness. Learned helplessness is defined as a sense of having no control over outcomes, regardless of one's actions. This may mediate the emergence of the lack of responsiveness and arousal observed in persons with depression after a perceived change in positive reinforcers. Self-regulation Self- regulation is a sub-category of reinforcement contingency theories. Self- regulation theories emphasize the role of self-implemented reinforcers and environment-dependent reinforcers. These self-implemented reinforcers may explain why some individuals who experience an external loss develop depression and others do not. Self-regulation begins with a self-evaluation in which the person recalls past performances and monitors their actions, followed by a reward or punishment. Individuals with depression may have unrealistic expectations for themselves, resulting in extreme self-punishment, or alternatively, may not engage in self-regulatory behaviors, depending completely on external sources of reinforcement. In either circumstance, the individual limits their experiences of positive enforcers, leading to a preoccupancy with negative feelings and depression. =Cognitive behavioral therapy= Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is based on the assumption that depression has its roots in negative thought patterns that then result in negative behavior patterns. Aaron Beck is cited as the first to develop this cognitive-behavioral approach, focusing on the here and now rather than predisposing factors. Beck's theories are based on his cognitive triad: a negative view of self, the world, and the future. Individuals with depression have unwarranted negative views of themselves and the world and, consequently, have overly negative expectations for the future. These negative expectations result in aversive behaviors; however, the behaviors are only a symptom of the original cognitive misconceptions. Personality Personality is defined as consistent patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Beck revised his original cognitive-behavioral theory to include predisposing personality types, which have been expanded upon by other cognitive-behavioral therapists. Silvano Arieti and Jules Bemporad link these consistent patterns of thought and behavior with the development of depression. They define two personality types that are vulnerable to the development of depression: dominant other and dominant goal. Dominant others value the input of others and rely heavily on others for their self-esteem. When individuals with this personality type fail to meet the expectations of those others, they become vulnerable to the development of depression. Alternatively, individuals with the dominant goal personality value personal achievement and success. These individuals become vulnerable to depression when they realize that they cannot or have not reached their goals. More generally, depression has been linked to differences in attributional styles and affect. Negative affect, the tendency to react negatively and to be overly sensitive to negative stimuli, predisposes individuals to depression. Conversely, positive affect, the tendency to react positively and to maintain high energy levels and high amounts of positive emotion, may serve as a buffer against depression. Additionally, the tendency to make negative internal attributions predisposes individuals to the development of hopelessness and depression. The opposite effect is seen for those who make positive internal attributions. = Social psychological social environment theory of depression = According to social psychologist Wendy Treynor, depression happens when one is trapped in a social setting that rejects the self, on a long-term basis (where one is devalued continually), and this rejection is internalized into self-rejection, winning one rejection from both the self and group‚Äî social rejection and self-rejection, respectively. This chronic conflict seems inescapable, and depression sets in. Stated differently, according to Treynor, the cause of depression is as follows: One's state of harmony is disrupted when faced with external conflict (social rejection) for failing to measure up to a group‚Äôs standard(s). Over time, this social rejection is internalized into self-rejection, where one experiences rejection from both the group and the self. Therefore, the rejection seems inescapable and depression sets in. In this framework, depression is conceptualized as being the result of long-term conflict (internal and external), where this conflict corresponds to self-rejection and social rejection, respectively, or the dual needs for self-esteem (self- acceptance) and belonging (social acceptance) being unmet, on a long-term basis. The solution to depression offered, therefore, is to end the conflict (get these needs met): Navigate oneself into an unconditionally accepting social environment, so one can internalize this social acceptance into self- acceptance, winning one peace both internally and externally (through self- acceptance and social acceptance‚Äîself-esteem and belonging, respectively), ending the conflict, and the depression. But what if one cannot find an unconditionally accepting group to navigate oneself into? If one cannot find such a group, the solution the framework offers is to make the context in which one generally finds oneself the self (however, the self must be in meditative solitude‚Äîalone and at peace, not lonely and ruminating‚Äîas stated, a state commonly achieved through the practice of meditation). The framework suggests that a lack of self-acceptance lies at the root of depression and that one can heal their own depression if they (a) keep an alert eye to their own emotional state (i.e., identify feelings of shame or depression) and (b) upon identification, take reparative action: undergo a context shift and immerse oneself in a new group that is unconditionally accepting (accepts the self, as it is)‚Äîwhether that group is one that exists apart from the self or simply is the self [in meditative solitude]. Over time, the unconditional acceptance experienced in this setting will be internalized, allowing one to achieve self-acceptance, eradicating conflict, eliminating one‚Äôs depression. Behavioral therapies Behavior therapy, also known as behavior modification, is a sub-category of psychotherapy. The emphasis is placed on observable, measurable behavior and the alteration of maladaptive behaviors via rewards and punishment. Behavior therapies for depression first emerged in the mid-1960s with Saslow's positive group reinforcement, which focused on increasing social skills. Three alternative therapies emerged over the next 4 years: Lweinsohn's social learning theory, Patterson's anti-depression milieu, and Lazarus' behavioral deprivation. Social learning theory focused on identifying and avoiding behaviors that increased depressive thoughts. Anti- depression milieu encouraged catharsis to overcome depression. Behavioral deprivation therapy denied patients any stimulus for an extended period of time, positing that any future stimulus would elicit positive feelings. Though none of these therapies are practiced in their original form, they formed the basis for all behavioral therapies in use today. Behavioral therapy has been shown to be as effective as cognitive therapy and antidepressants in the treatment of depression. The benefits of behavioral therapy have also been shown to persist after the end of therapy. =Behavioral activation= Behavioral activation therapy emphasizes the role of the individual in creating treatment goals and engaging with their environment in a way that facilitates positive reinforcement. Treatment is typically intended to be brief, intense, and specific to the goals of the individual. Goals are specific and measurable, focusing on single avoidance behaviors. Patients keep activity logs to monitor the feelings associated with different activities and therapists assign graded homework to help patients accomplish their goals. Patients are encouraged to participate in activities that they find pleasurable and to avoid activities that generate feelings of depression. Engaging in more diverse and positively reinforcing activities will, over time, rebuild the individual's behavioral repertoire, providing more variability in their responses and actions. This variability has been linked to a decrease in depressive symptoms and to a typical behavioral profile. The ultimate goal is to engage the individual in a wide range of stable and meaningful reinforcers, consequently alleviating depressive symptoms. Functional analysis Functional analysis is defined as \\"the identification of important, controllable, causal functional relationships applicable to a specified set of target behaviors for an individual\\" and is used for individual evaluation in behavioral activation therapy. In functional analysis, the purpose of the behavior is emphasized in relation to the individual and their environment, i.e. if the behavior is avoidant, rather than the actual topography of the action. Functional analysis is based on the evaluation of an event via the three-term contingency: antecedents, behavior, and consequences. An antecedent is an event that increases the likelihood of a given behavior, the behavior is the individual's response to the antecedent, and the consequence is the reinforcement or lack thereof. Therapists help individuals identify events that typically trigger specific behaviors and the consequences of these behaviors. Then the individual is encouraged to interrupt the three-term contingency pattern for negative consequences by either avoiding the antecedent or changing the behavior. Likewise, individuals are encouraged to seek out antecedents that result in positive reinforcement and to increase the behaviors for which they are positively reinforced. =Social skills training= Social skills training includes all therapies that teach adaptive interaction skills. Training may be specific to a given situation, such as a job interview, or may be more general in nature. Therapists often engage individuals in behavioral rehearsal, a process in which the client practices appropriate social skills for a given situation with the therapist. Social problem solving In social problem solving therapy, therapists help individuals develop adaptive coping mechanisms for daily life stresses, such as confrontation and discomfort, within a social environment. Emphasis is placed on manipulating the individual's responses to social stressors, as well as ways to avoid excessively stressful social situations. There is no pre-determined set of adaptive behaviors, rather, coping mechanisms are created on an individual basis. =Problem solving therapy= Problem orientation therapy (PST) is a sub-category of social problem solving therapy that focuses on changing the manner in which individuals approach social stressors. Problem orientation is an individual's generalized cognitive approach to social problems and coping. Individuals with depression typically display a negative problem orientation, the tendency to become overwhelmed by social stressors and perceive them to be unsolvable, resulting in maladaptive coping. PST emphasizes decreasing negative orientations, increasing positive orientations, enhancing problem-solving skills, and minimizing avoidant and impulsive reactions. Individuals are provided with a series of steps to manipulate their orientation and reaction: the SSTA Toolkit. Therapists instruct clients to stop, slow down, think, and act to encourage rational behavior that is influenced by cognitive processes rather than emotional reactions. The emphasis is placed on generating behavioral modifications that interrupt the individual's typical progression of negative orientation and maladaptive coping, replacing them with positive orientation and useful coping behaviors.

It affects all of the vessels: very small blood vessels (capillaries), medium-size blood vessels (arterioles and venules), or large blood vessels (arteries and veins). If blood flow in a vessel with vasculitis is reduced or stopped, the parts of the body that receive blood from that vessel begins to die. It may produce a wide range of neurological symptoms, such as headache, skin rashes, feeling very tired, joint pains, difficulty moving or coordinating part of the body, changes in sensation, and alterations in perception, thought or behavior, as well as the phenomena of a mass lesion in the brain leading to coma and herniation. Some of its signs and symptoms may resemble multiple sclerosis. 10% have associated bleeding in the brain. Causes \\"Primary\\" angiitis/vasculitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is said to be present if there is no underlying cause. The exact mechanism of the primary disease is unknown, but the fundamental mechanism of all vasculitides is autoimmunity. Other possible secondary causes of cerebral vasculitis are infections, systemic auto-immune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis, medications and drugs (amphetamine, cocaine and heroin), some forms of cancer (lymphomas, leukemia and lung cancer) and other forms of systemic vasculitis such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, polyarteritis nodosa or Beh√ßet's disease. It may imitate, and is in turn imitated by, a number of other diseases that affect the blood vessels of the brain diffusely such as fibromuscular dysplasia and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Diagnosis Cerebral angiography and magnetic resonance imaging, family medical history, symptoms, a complete physical examination, and ultimately biopsy of the brain, are often required for the diagnosis. Also, many lab tests must be done for the diagnosis; tests may reveal anemia (a shortage of red blood cells), a high white blood cell count, a high platelet count, allergic reactions, immune complexes, antibodies (tools the body uses to fight off threats) and elevation of inflammatory markers. Another crucial part in the diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis is the use of imaging techniques. Techniques such as conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to find and monitor cerebral involvement. Treatment Treatment is first with many different high-dose steroids, namely glucocorticoids. Then, if symptoms do not improve additional immunosuppression such as cyclophosphamide are added to decrease the immune system's attack on the body's own tissues. Cerebral vasculitis is a very rare condition that is difficult to diagnose, and as a result there are significant variations in the way it is diagnosed and treated.

It refers to a process by which individuals and businesses can access appropriate, affordable, and timely financial products and services. These include banking, loan, equity, and insurance products. Financial inclusion efforts typically target those who are unbanked and underbanked, and directs sustainable financial services to them. Financial inclusion is understood to go beyond merely opening a bank account. It is possible for banked individuals to be excluded from financial services. Having more inclusive financial systems has been linked to stronger and more sustainable economic growth and development and thus achieving financial inclusion has become a priority for many countries across the globe.Dixit, R., Ghosh, M. (2013). Financial Inclusion for Inclusive Growth of India ‚Äì A Study of Indian States. International Journal of Business Management and Research. 3, 147-156. In 2018 it was estimated that about 1.7 billion adults lacked a bank account. Among those who are unbanked a significant number were women and poor people in rural areas and often those who are excluded from financial institutions face discrimination and belong to vulnerable or marginalized populations. While it is recognized that not all individuals need or want financial services, the goal of financial inclusion is to remove all barriers, both supply side and demand side. Supply side barriers stem from financial institutions themselves. They often indicate poor financial infrastructure, and include lack of nearby financial institutions, high costs to opening accounts, or documentation requirements. Demand side barriers refer to aspects of the individual seeking financial services and include poor financial literacy, lack of financial capability, or cultural or religious beliefs that impact their financial decisions. There is some skepticism from some experts about the effectiveness of financial inclusion initiatives. Research on microfinance initiatives indicates that wide availability of credit for micro- entrepreneurs can produce informal inter-mediation, an unintended form of entrepreneurship. History The term \\"financial inclusion\\" has gained importance since the early 2000s, a result of identifying financial exclusion and it is a direct correlation to poverty according to the World Bank. The United Nations defines the goals\\"Financial Services for the Poor - Aid\\" , Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), March 2010. of financial inclusion as follows: * Access at a reasonable cost for all households to a full range of financial services, including savings or deposit services, payment and transfer services, credit and insurance. * Sound and safe institutions governed by clear regulation and industry performance standards. * Financial and institutional sustainability, to ensure continuity and certainty of investment. * Competition to ensure choice and affordability for clients. Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, on 29 December 2003, said: \\"The stark reality is that most poor people in the world still lack access to sustainable financial services, whether it is savings, credit or insurance. The great challenge is to address the constraints that exclude people from full participation in the financial sector. Together, we can build inclusive financial sectors that help people improve their lives.\\" More recently, Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI) Executive Director Alfred Hannig highlighted on 24 April 2013 progress in financial inclusion during the IMF-World Bank 2013 Spring Meetings: \\"Financial inclusion is no longer a fringe subject. It is now recognized as an important part of the mainstream thinking on economic development based on country leadership.\\"\\"World Bank's Financial Access for All session highlights Maya Declaration, home-grown solutions\\", Alliance for Financial Inclusion, April 24, 2013. In partnership with the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, the UN aims to increase financial inclusion of the poor by developing an appropriate financial products for them and increasing awareness on available financial services strengthening financial literacy, particularly among women. The UN's financial inclusion product is financed by the United Nations Development Programme. Initiatives by country=Financial inclusion in the Philippines= Four million unbanked Filipinos are seen to benefit from the nascent credit scoring industry, a development that is seen to serve the people that is classified at the bottom of the economy an easy access to credit once the service is available to the public. Marlo R. Cruz, president and chief executive officer of CIBI Information, Inc. (CIBI) as one of the accredited credit bureaus in the Philippines, highlighted that this is expected to unlock much economic potential in sectors of the economy that are crucial for inclusive growth. As per Cruz, \\"Many people still do not realize that the value of having a credit opportunity is synonymous to generating financial power. Creditworthiness is the same as to owning a keycard that can be used in navigating to the society of better possibilities.\\" The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) reports on Financial Inclusion Initiatives and Financial Inclusion in the Philippines summarizes the country's accomplishments and significant milestones in financial inclusion. These reports show that 4 out of 10 Filipinos saved money in 2015 (up from 2 out of 10 in 2009). Among Filipino adults, 24.5% never saved and only 31.3% (up from 26.6%) have an account at a formal financial institution. The lack of enough money was cited as the main reason for not having a bank account.http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Economy&title;=role- of-financial-inclusion-in-poverty-reduction&id;=127483 While there has been significant progress, much more must be done. As an emerging country with a sizeable number of people living in poverty, access to financial services is an important challenge. Based on a March 18, 2016 report from the Philippine Statistics Authority, the country's 2015 poverty incidence (the proportion of people below the poverty line versus the total population) is at 26.3% while the subsistence incidence (the proportion of Filipinos in extreme or subsistence poverty) is at 12.1%. This means that there are around 26 million Filipinos who are still living below the poverty line. =Financial inclusion in India= History  The concept of financial inclusion, extending financial services to those who typically lack access, has been a goal for the Government of India since the 1950s.Mahajan, V & Ramola, B.G. (1996). Financial Services for the Rural Poor and Women in India: Access and Sustainability. Journal of International Development. 8(2), 211-224. The nationalization of banks, which occurred from the mid 1950s to the late 1960s, culminating in 1969 with the nationalization of 14 commercial banks by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, brought banking facilities to previously unreached areas of the country. The \\"branching\\" of banks into rural areas increased lending for agriculture and other unserved rural populations and Indira Gandhi spoke of it as a tactic to \\"accelerate development\\" and to address poverty and unemployment. The Lead Bank Scheme followed nationalization as a way to coordinate banks and credit institutions by districts to more comprehensively ensure that rural areas had their credit needs met. In 1975, the Government of India followed this with efforts to specifically reach rural areas by establishing Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) meant to exclusively meet demand in the rural economy and the number of RRBs has significantly increased over the years. By the early 2000's, the term 'financial inclusion' was being used in the Indian context. In 2004 the Khan Commission, created by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), investigated the state of financial inclusion in India and laid out a series of recommendations.\\"Report of the Internal Group to Examine Issues relating to Rural Credit and Microfinance\\" , Reserve Bank of India, July 2005. In response, RBI Governor Y. Venugopal Reddy, expressed concern regarding the exclusion of millions from the formal financial system and urged banks to better align their existing practices with the objective of financial inclusion in both his annual and midterm policy statements.\\"Reserve Bank of India - Annual Policy Statement for the Year 2005-06\\", Reserve Bank of India\\"Statement by Dr. Y. Venugopal Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India on the Mid-term Review of Annual Policy for the year 2005-06\\", Reserve Bank of India, October 25, 2005. The RBI has continued in its efforts in conjunction with the Government of India to develop banking products, craft new regulations, and advocate for financial inclusion. Since financial inclusion was established as a priority for the GOI and RBI, progress has been made. Mangalam, Puducherry became the first village in India where all households were provided banking facilities. States or union territories such as Puducherry, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala announced 100% financial inclusion in all their districts. The Indian Reserve Bank vision for 2020 is to open nearly 600 million new customers' accounts and service them through a variety of channels by leveraging on IT. However, illiteracy, low income savings, and lack of bank branches in rural areas remain a roadblock to financial inclusion in many states, and there is inadequate legal and financial structure.  Financial sector strategies  In India, RBI initiated several measures to achieve greater financial inclusion.These rely on efforts of the financial sector. No frills accounts (NFAs), now known as basic savings bank deposit accounts (BSBDAs) can be opened with zero or minimal balances, removing a cost barrier to banking. Banks are also meant to charge minimal overdraft fees on NFAs. The RBI continues to change and relax policies regarding these accounts in an effort to better serve bank customers. Know-your-customer (KYC) requirements for opening bank accounts were relaxed for small accounts in August 2005, eliminating a documentation barrier to banking. The new procedure only requires an introduction by an account holder who has been subjected to the full KYC screening. Additionally, banks were permitted to accept more easily produced forms of documentation for proof of identity and address. The business correspondents (BC) model was launched in January 2006, when the RBI permitted banks to engage intermediaries in the banking process. This model enables banks to service neglected areas by allowing intermediaries to facilitate transactions and deliver other banking services directly. Originally, a fairly limited number of entities, including NGO's and certain microfinance institutions were eligible to act as BCs, however in 2010 the list was expanded to include for-profit companies In 2018, operators of Common Service Centers(CSCs) who work with local governing gram panchayats also began working as BCs to further improve penetration of banking services. Expanding financial technology, or fintech, has been proposed as an effective strategy to achieve financial inclusion. While incorporation of technology does pose some risks, it is being used to deliver banking services to those in rural and remote areas who are typically unserved. Banks have been advised to make effective use of information and communications technology (ICT), to provide banking services to people directly through the BC model where the accounts can be operated by even illiterate customers by using biometrics, thus ensuring the security of transactions and enhancing confidence in the banking system. In 2018 the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) launched the Bali Fintech Agenda to provide a framework for domestic policy discussions around deepening access to financial services in a variety of different contexts. Unique credit cards are now offered by banks, the most popular being general purpose credit cards (GCCs), and Kisan credit cards. These unique cards offer credit to those in rural and semi-urban areas, farmers, and others with adjusted collateral and security requirements with the objective of providing hassle-free credit. Electronic benefit transfer (EBT) is being implemented by banks at the advice of the RBI with the goal of reducing dependence on cash, lowering transaction costs, and address corruption. Increasing the number of rural banks remains a priority for the RBI. In 2009, the RBI relaxed previous policies requiring authorization before opening new branches in the hopes that simplified authorization would increase branches in underserved areas. Beginning in 2011 the RBI required 25% of new branches opened in a given year be in unbanked rural areas centers to ensure a more even spread of banking facilities. The self-help group (SHG) linkage model has also been proposed to improve financial inclusion by linking community groups to the formal banking sector through government programs, credit cooperatives, NGOs, or other microfinance institutions. Group-based models in which members pool their savings have also been seen as tools for social and economic empowerment, particularly when women are leaders and participants.Valliammal, V. (2018). Socio-economic Empowerment of Women Through Self Help Groups ‚Äì A Study with Reference to Thoothukudi District in Tamilnadu. International Journal of Recent Research Aspects, Special Issue, 159-163.  Government policy strategies  The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is meant to provide supplemental employment at a guaranteed minimum wage and facilitate financial inclusion to empower women and rural laborers.Breitkreuz, R, Stanton, C.J., Brady, N., Pattison Williams, J., King, E.D., Mishra, C., Swallow, B. (2017). The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme: A Policy Solution to Rural Poverty in India? Development Policy Review. 35(3), 397-417. While achieving financial inclusion is not its main goal, the program directly deposits wages into bank accounts as a way to limit corruption, speed delivery of benefits, and connect wage laborers to bank accounts.Reddy, D.N., Reddy, A.A., Bantilan, M.C.S. (2014). The Impact of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) on Rural Labor Markets and Agriculture. India Review. 12(3), 251-273. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana policy scheme was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his 2014 Independence Day Speech and launched in August 2014 in an effort to provide \\"universal access\\" to banking through the creation of basic banking accounts that come with other basic financial services. Modi informed all Indian banks of the initiative and declared it a national priority. On the inauguration day of the scheme, 1.5 crore (15 million) bank accounts were opened and since then, more than 18 million bank accounts have been created. In 2016, the Government of India instituted a sweeping demonetisation policy in an attempt to stop corruption and the flow of black money. This move forced people to deposit their money into banks or see its value evaporate, with the goal of integrating citizens into a cashless and taxable economy and banking system.Taruna & Kumar, N. (2017). Demonetization in rural areas of Lucknow (U.P): Immediate impact make life difficult to live. International Journal of Commerce and Management Research. 3(4), 100-103 While India has seen new bank accounts continue to open in the wake of this policy change, and an overall increase in use of digital payment systems and other financial services, the policy change caused an extreme disruption to the financial system and debate continues on its efficacy.  Measuring financial inclusion  Readily available data outlining gaps in access and contextualizing the situation of financial inclusion is necessary for both service providers and policy makers looking to achieve financial inclusion. Several organizations conduct surveys to measure indicators of financial inclusion and collect both supply and demand side data. MIX is one platform that produces data driven reports to track progress towards financial inclusion across the globe. In 2013, Finance Minister of India, P. Chidambaram launched the CRISIL Inclusix, an index to measure the status of financial inclusion in India.\\"P Chidambaram launches Crisil Inclusix\\", DNA India, June 25, 2013. CRISIL, India's leading credit rating and research company is collecting data from 666 districts in India and ranking on a scale from 0 to 100 based on four parameters of financial services. CRISIL publishes semi- frequent reports based on their findings with regional, state-wise, and district-wise assessments of financial inclusion. Some key conclusions from the 2018 report are: * The all-India CRISIL Inclusix score of 58.0 is above average as of April 2016, this is a significant improvement from 35.4 in 2009. * Deposit penetration is the key driver of financial inclusion‚Äìthe number of deposit accounts (1646 million) is almost eight times the number of credit accounts (196 million). * The top three states are Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Controversy Financial inclusion in India is often closely connected to the aggressive micro credit policies that were introduced without appropriate regulations, oversight, or consumer education policies. As a result, consumers quickly became over-indebted to the point of committing suicide and lending institutions saw repayment rates collapse after politicians in one of the country's largest states called on borrowers to stop paying back their loans.\\"India's oldest microfinance firm on the verge of closure\\", Livemint.com, Jul 27, 2011. The crisis threatened the existence of the $4 billion Indian microcredit industry, has been compared to the subprime mortgage crisis in the United State.\\"India Rocked By Microfinance Crisis\\", NPR, December 09, 2010. The crisis serves as a reminder of the necessity of appropriate regulatory and educational frameworks and it remains a challenge to separate microcredit from the large and complex field of financial inclusion. = Financial inclusion in Tanzania = With a population of 55.57 million people and only 19% of its population enrolled into an account with a formal bank, Tanzania remains largely unbanked. Poverty alleviation is often linked with a given population's access to formal banking instruments, and mobile money can serve as a crucial bridge for offering savings, credit, and insurance to Tanzania's rural population. In 2006 just 11% of Tanzanians had access to a financial account, but with the advent of digital financial services that number has increased to 60%. The current situation in Tanzania has improved steadily over the past 12 years with the introduction of mobile money by Tanzania's main telecom providers. The quick expansion of financial inclusion in Tanzania is almost entirely due to the proliferation of mobile banking options. While a recent cooling effect has taken place due to a government crackdown on counterfeit SIM cards, over half of Tanzania's population has access a degree of financial services through mobile banking. = Financial inclusion in the United States = The United States began to adopt MFI (microfinance) ideals in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Compared to other countries, the United States was late to implement these changes, but nevertheless, once active the US had the experience of other countries to draw upon. According to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the expansion opened a new avenue to disadvantaged communities, primarily African Americans to \\"expand economic opportunities and to foster community economic development\\". This action is tailored to the needs of low- to moderate-income entrepreneurs. One criticism of MFI in the US is that its services didn't extend outside of providing credit, where other MFI programs overseas \\"extended their offerings to deliver education, training, and other relevant services\\". To address this gap, MFI non-profit organizations emerged, many focused on specific minority populations, such as African Americans, who are excluded from mainstream credit. Racial inequality in the United States reduces the opportunity for African Americans to receive financial support compared to White Americans. This is due to the preexisting conflicts in the US that continue to remain relevant in the modern world. Organizations such as Main Street Launch, an Oakland, California‚Äìbased microfinance organization centered on empowering African American entrepreneurs, were able to flourish due to the value they brought to local communities. The big banks viewed microfinance organizations as a \\"tax incentive\\", considering the money they offered these organizations was exempted by the US government. Another beneficial aspect that these MFI organizations brought was economic prosperity to entrepreneurs and most importantly to their local community. Through the empowerment of their local communities, MFI organizations are able to reach larger marginalized communities to support and promote upward mobility. Over the past several decades that MFI organizations have been operating within the United States, they have loaned over several billions over dollars (~15 billion) and have had a ~97% repayment rate. During the COVID-19 pandemic, digital financial exclusion has become more prominent in the US as some businesses no longer accept cash for purchases. = Financial inclusion in Indonesia = Indonesia's national strategy for financial inclusion was established in 2016. The strategy is a guideline for all government institutions in Indonesia and private stakeholders to improve public access to financial services. Priority segments of Indonesia's financial inclusion programs are: * The lowest income families, particularly those with limited access to financial services or without access at all; * Micro businesses and small entrepreneurs with limited resources to expand their business; and * Female, people with disability as well as migrant workers, communities in disadvantaged and remote areas, the elderly, former convicts, homeless communities, students and youth. By the end of 2019, 75 percent of adult population in Indonesia is expected to have access to formal financial services. The National Council for Financial Inclusion, led by the President of Indonesia, is established to coordinate and synchronize the implementation of the strategy, to determine plans and policies in solving problems and obstacles within the implementation as well as to support governors and regent/mayors in determining regional financial inclusion policies at provincial and district/city levels. In 2019, 76.19% of adult population in Indonesia were said to have accessed financial services. Tracking financial inclusion through budget analysis While financial inclusion is an important issue, it may also be interesting to assess whether such inclusion as earmarked in policies are actually reaching the common beneficiaries. Since the 1990s, there has been serious efforts both in the government agencies and in the civil society to monitor the fund flow process and to track the outcome of public expenditure through budget tracking. Organisations like International Budget Partnership (IBP) are undertaking global surveys in more than 100 countries to study the openness (transparency) in budget making process.http://lokkatha.com/150/index.php/26-policy- briefs/national/719-report-of-the-tot-on-open-budgets-for-inclusion There are various tools used by different civil society groups to track public expenditure. Such tools may include performance monitoring of public services, social audit and public accountability surveys. In India, the institutionalisation of Right to information (RTI) has been a supporting tool for activists and citizen groups for budget tracking and advocacy for social inclusion. Financial inclusion and bank stability The theoretical and empirical evidences on the link between financial inclusion and bank stability are limited. Banking literature indicates several potential channels through which financial inclusion may influence bank stability. A recent study appeared in Journal Economic Behavior & Organization a robust positive association between financial inclusion and bank stability. The authors show that the positive association is more pronounced with those banks that have higher retail deposit funding share and lower marginal costs of providing banking services; and also with those that operate in countries with stronger institutional quality. Evidence on the effectiveness of financial inclusion interventions A systematic review of reviews by the Campbell Collaboration in 2019 assessed the available evidence on the effectiveness of financial inclusion programs to improve economic, social, behavioral and gender-related outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. They found that results from research have been mixed and programs to improve access to financial services often have small or inconsistent effects on income, health, and other social outcomes. The review showed that programs geared toward savings opportunities had small but more consistently positive effects, and fewer risks, than credit-oriented programs.

He defines the act of making an arbitrary inference as the process of drawing a conclusion without sufficient evidence, or without any evidence at all. In cases of depression, Beck found that individuals may be more prone to cognitive distortions, and make arbitrary inferences more often. These inferences could be general and/or in reference to the effectiveness of their medicine or treatment. Arbitrary inference is one of numerous specific cognitive distortions identified by Beck that can be commonly presented in people with anxiety, depression, and psychological impairments. Arbitrary inferences tend to derive from emotional disturbances one experienced and gave a distorted meaning. Most of the time that distorted meaning involves blaming the self. In the book Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy a book by David D. Burns, a student of Aaron T. Beck, discusses more in detail the cognitive distortions. Burns explains arbitrary inference or \\"jumping to conclusions\\" with two of the most common examples of arbitrary inference: \\"Mind Reading\\" and \\"The Fortune Teller Error\\". When \\"Mind Reading\\" in arbitrary inference, one will believe other's are thinking negatively about them. When \\"Mind Reading,\\" one is so convinced others are thinking negatively about them, they do not even bother confirming. This acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy when the person avoids or counterattacks the other person, and as a result creating a tension that would not exist had they not applied the inference. In \\"The Fortune Teller Error\\" one would imagine something failing or bad happening, and suddenly they are convinced it will happen, despite the irrationality of it. Similarly to \\"Mind Reading\\" it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. According to Beck (1967), a person goes through life with detrimental schemas and pessimistic point of view, they reinforce their harmful thoughts. People's prior beliefs also tend to reinforce that way of thinking, like when they focus on information that is in alignment with their belief and disregard equally relevant facts that do not align with their schemas. These schemas that dominate the cognitive processes consist of 1) Feeling inadequate and faulty, 2) Believing all actions and experiences will lead to failure, and 3) The future is discouraging. Overtime, these thought processes become automatic. Without time to reflect on the cognitive process, one believes that their illogical reasoning to their conclusion is valid. Attributing the negative and distorted meaning of an event results in latent schemas that are later activated by events and influence how information from the event is processed. When a person creates an arbitrary inference it intervenes and is seen as effective response to the event. In a 2003 study attempting to understand cognitive processes like arbitrary inference on depression, researchers compared 42 patients with chronic depression, 27 patients with major depressive disorder (non-chronic), and 24 patients that had never been psychiatrically ill before. The study included the Attributional Style Questionnaire, a ruminative response style questionnaire, the Schema Questionnaire, and the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale. While studies showed that both of the depressed groups were significantly elevated in every cognitive measure compared to the control group, the depressed group scored higher in the attributional style. Moreover, Beck has also studied the relationships between cognitive distortions and idiosyncrasies, where the inferences made could be based more on one‚Äôs own personality rather than on a depressive state of emotions. This research shows that while common in those with depression, inferences can be made in any number of cases. The main issue covered, however, is how these can negatively affect someone‚Äôs personal schema when coupled with the already negative emotions brought about by anxiety or depression. Cognitive Therapy for Arbitrary Inference Aaron T. Becks approach to helping people with arbitrary inference is to ask them questions about the inference. Beck Leads the people to think about the rationality of the automatic thoughts that happen when one is using arbitrary inference as an explanation to an event. By studying what people thought of themselves when they were depressed, Beck and his associates were able to develop this form of therapy to offer a change in self-opinion. Moreover, different approaches have also been taken in cognitive therapy for these inferences, such as Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM). This involves modification of Beck‚Äôs original theory on depression, coming up with positive views and feelings for situations, as opposed to negative ones. The point of the study was to show that simply thinking positively about something allows one to correctly attribute a situation, rather than ‚Äòarbitrarily‚Äô drawing false conclusions.  In Other Studies  Other scientists have also applied Beck‚Äôs principle of arbitrary inference in studies on emotion in depressive patients. These studies showed that, in support of Beck‚Äôs model on depression, arbitrary inferences were some the most common thoughts during the exercises. This lends to the necessity of cognitive therapy, especially for couples, so as to lessen some of these thoughts. Studies done on CBM (Cognitive Bias Modification) have shown that changing the views one has on the world or on specific events can lead to a decrease in stress and an increase in confident performance. Lester and associates research methods on how to adequately cope with stress or even reduce its effects, and in the scope of Beck‚Äôs research on inferences, they concluded that positive thinking and correct attributions can lead one to live a healthier lifestyle. Some sources have also referenced this phenomenon in counseling, as one of the cognitive distortions proposed by Beck. Among others, arbitrary inference is one of the distortions that causes a person to misrepresent or misinterpret a scenario, which can especially cause problems among couples. Beck‚Äôs theories on depression, specifically about arbitrary inferences, have also been examined by researchers, to prove their validity or their usefulness. This research came before Beck officially published his theory of arbitrary inference in the 1970‚Äôs, when his theory of cognitive therapy was still being argued. Researchers examined his theory, along with those of Bergin and Ullmann, to test their applicable nature to the subject of cognitive therapy. In doing so, Beck‚Äôs thoughts were generally justified, with the research concluding that of the many distortions discussed in the studies, arbitrary inference was one of the commonly present distortions found in participants. Since then, Beck‚Äôs theory has been widely used, more so than Ellis‚Äô Technique of Irrational Beliefs, also called the ABC method or rational emotive behavior therapy.  Examples  One member of a married couple who does not receive a text back from his or her significant other promptly could conclude, \\"He or she must be cheating\\", or someone who has been feeling down on a rainy day could conclude, \\"I have seasonal depression\\". In media, using an arbitrary inference is a common hyperbolic way to express oneself, especially when feeling more anxious or depressed. A person may receive requests to spend time with someone else, and in this state, they may assume it is because something is wanted, that they are going to be used. There is little to no evidence that this is the case, but the person infers that it is so, regardless.

It grows wild in humid mountainous regions in Iran, as well in some adjacent areas. As a spice, its common name in English is 'angelica,' although it is not related to the genus Angelica. Having been introduced in the 1830s, it has spread across Scandinavia. It is now very common in northern Norway, where it is known as the Troms√∏ palm. The plant has also been spotted in Sweden. In Finland, it has been declared as invasive species. Persian hogweed is a polycarpic perennial, that is, a mature plant flowers and bears fruit season after season. Uses=Food uses= The seeds are used as a spice in Persian cooking. The very thin, small seed pods are aromatic and slightly bitter. They are usually sold in powdered form and are often erroneously sold as \\"angelica seeds\\". The powder is sprinkled over broad beans, lentils and other legumes, and potatoes. Golpar is also used in soups and stews. It is often used sprinkled over pomegranate arils. Golpar is also mixed with vinegar into which broad beans are dipped before eating. Golpar can be used in small amounts (1 or 2 tsp per pound) when cooking beans to reduce the effect of gas in the digestive tract associated with consuming beans. Ground golpar (H. persicum) seeds In Persian cuisine, the petals are used in the spice mixture advieh to flavor rice dishes, as well as in chicken, Fish and bean dishes. The tender leaves and leaf stalks can also be pickled (known as golpar torshi). Public health and safety The sap of the Troms√∏ palm contains furanocoumarins, which in combination with ultraviolet light, leads to phytophotodermatitis. There is some anecdotal evidence that H. persicum may be less dangerous than H. mantegazzianum with respect to phototoxicity. Control measures Known ways to fight Troms√∏ palm are the constant cutting of new shoots. When cutting down, protective equipment is recommended, and metal cutting tools should be cleaned after use because the juice is oxidizing.

The Washington Post, 07 November 1978: Metro; C4.) was the chief of the United States Secret Service between 1948 and 1961, under Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy. Baughman was the first Secret Service Chief to pen a memoir concerning the office he held. Entitled Secret Service Chief,Secret Service Chief it was a veritable tell-all on the intricacies and inner workings of the Secret Service and its evolution from a counterfeit detection department to the presidential protection unit. Baughman was appointed to head the Secret Service by President Harry S. Truman shortly after the 1948 election. According to the book American Gunfight, by Stephen Hunter and John Bainbridge Jr., Truman dismissed Baughman's predecessor James J. Maloney in part because he had dispatched most of Truman's Secret Service detail to New York to prepare to guard New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey. Dewey was widely expected to be elected president but was beaten by Truman in one of the greatest upsets in presidential election history. Personal statements=Life of the president= Baughman gave a description of the job of the president to the Senate Appropriations Committee: > [The President] cannot have what is considered a normal life, home or family > relationship.

Of these cases, 74 resulted in arrests, and 72 of those were sent to prison or mental institutions. =Organized crime= In an interview with The Washington Post published on July 26, 1961, the day after his retirement was announced, Baughman emphatically stated that there had been no mafia in the United States for 40 years. He further denied the existence of a national crime syndicate based on talks with other law enforcement officials.\\"Interview with U.E. Baughman\\". The Washington Post, 06 July 1961. =Kennedy assassination= Baughman was immediately critical of the methods used by the Secret Service following the assassination of President Kennedy. He wanted to know why, after the first shot was fired, the Secret Service did not immediately pepper the window with machine gun fire to prevent any further shots from being fired. He was also curious as to why, with an entire Secret Service detail and the Dallas Police Force on hand, the only shots that were fired were from the assassin. He claimed it was basic training for all Secret Service agents that unauthorized people should be kept out of buildings.Joesten, Joachim. How Kennedy was Killed: The Full Appalling Story.

According to the Library Journal it was the second most borrowed fiction book in United States libraries in 2009. Plot An African warlord known as the Tiger, aided by his crew of angry young men, horrifically murders author Eleanor 'Ellie' Cox and her entire family. Alex Cross and girlfriend Bree Stone go investigate, when Alex recalls Ellie had been his one time girlfriend, whom he had loved at one point. He is instantly terrified by this so much he gets no sleep, does no work for the case, and stays up late at night, sitting in his bed. He then figures out the Tiger's next murder, and arrives on time to stop the Tiger and his gang of kids, where most of the villains escape including the Tiger and most of his gang. After gaining access from the CIA he plans on going to Nigeria, where he hopes to find and stop the Tiger, using the knowledge based on the Tiger's whereabouts. After convincing a bitter Nanna and nervous Bree, he goes on a plane trip to Nigeria, where he is annoyed by their customs. He is then kidnapped by 'cops' and put in jail, where his nose is broken, he is horribly injured, and starves as well as having to deal with no water. After nearly three days or more, he is bailed out by American Ian Flaherty who gives Cross advice to flee while he still can. He is then called by Bree who says there has been another murder by the Tiger. Instead of listening to Flaherty, Cross instead goes to Sierra Leone, where he meets veteran and amputee, Moses, who feeds him and gives him water. Later that night, Cross, when alone by himself, is ambushed by the Tiger's gang, however, he escapes with Moses' help and buys a truck which he later gives to Moses. Father Bombata, a priest whom he met during the plane ride to Nigeria, informs him his cousin, Addane Tansi, may be able to help Alex, who meets Addane, a reporter who had, unbeknownst to Alex, befriended Ellie, who had gone to Nigeria some time before her death. Addane introduces Alex to her family and shares a kiss with him, which he refuses to think of because of Bree; Flaherty later reveals that the Tiger's real name is Abidemi Sowande. Alex and Addane go to a hobo camp where they are attacked by Janjaweed, ruthless men who rape, injure, and kill women and children. After barely escaping due to the 'Peacekeepers' who only do it so they gain no bad publicity, especially by Addane. After returning to Nigeria, Cross and Addane discover that Addane's family have been murdered. When trying to get closer, Cross and Addane are taken to jail by cops. Alex witnesses Addane get murdered by Tiger after being raped, and is released afterwards. Heading home, he learns that Alex's family have been kidnapped by the Tiger, who then gives Alex coordinates to the hideout. Alex, Bree, and John Sampson go and defeat the Tiger's gang, while Alex follows Sowande (Tiger). Alex kills the Tiger. Ian Flaherty is revealed to be working with Sownande and is arrested. Shortly afterward, his family are found; Alex instantly thinks the CIA might have worked with the Tiger. Alex calls upon Merrill Snyder and Steven Millard, from the CIA, and arrests them, after discovering they and Flaherty were associated with Tiger. The book ends as Alex gets an alarming phone call from Kyle Craig, who has escaped from prison and wants revenge on Alex Cross after the events in the previous book. Sequels A sequel was released on August 29, 2009 and was titled Alex Cross' Trial and was followed by six others featuring Cross, I, Alex Cross, Cross Fire, Kill Alex Cross, Merry Christmas, Alex Cross, Alex Cross, Run, and Cross My Heart.

His military career led, in 1993, to his rise to Prime Minister and later prison term.The Black Garden by Tom De Waal., ch. 13 Prior to the war After serving in the army in 1977‚Äì1979 and later graduating from the Leninabad Technological Institute,Dmitry Kamyshev.

Surat Huseynov worked as a plumber, a warehouse employee and an assistant operator at the Kirovabad Textile Factory. In 1983‚Äì1984 he resided in Novopavlovsk, Russia. For the next two years he worked as a wool sorter at a storing department in Shaki, Azerbaijan. In 1986 he became senior inspector of a textile factory in Yevlakh and was promoted to manager just before the war. He was considered one of key figures in Soviet Azerbaijan's black market and was known for having funded the sovereigntist Popular Front of Azerbaijan in the late Soviet era. He is married and has two children.

He has been reported to have originated the group in Yevlakh. In summer 1992, his detachment took part in the Azerbaijani offensive which led to the capture of Mardakert on 4 July 1992. Ganja revolt The Popular Front of Azerbaijan blamed Huseynov for treason and for intentionally ceding the villages around Mardakert to Armenians (allowing their advance into Kalbajar region) to benefit Russian geopolitical interests in the region. After the remaining Soviet turned Russian troops left Ganja on 28 May 1993, President Abulfaz Elchibey initiated a military operation called Tufan aimed at arresting Huseynov and disarming his detachments. Elchibey deployed 4,000 troops led by Minister of Defence Dadash Rzayev, Commander of Internal Forces Fahmin Hajiyev and Attorney General Ikhtiyar Shirinov to Ganja. On 4 June 1993, at 6 o'clock in the morning, the two groups confronted each other, however not only did the Presidential Guard fail to disarm Huseynov, but the latter quickly defeated it. The number of casualties on both sides, as well as among civilians, was 69. Attorney General Ikhtiyar Shirinov among others was taken hostage, while Dadash Rzayev and Fahmin Hajiyev fled Ganja. Surat Huseynov demanded that Ikhtiyar Shirinov signed a warrant for President Elchibey's arrest on grounds of conspiracy, murder, and abuse of power, which was exercised immediately. Within several days Huseynov extended his control onto the neighbouring regions without meeting any opposition and started advancing toward the capital city of Baku. Upon Huseynov's approach on 18 June, Elchibey secretly fled the capital to his native village of Kalaki in Nakhchivan. Heydar Aliyev who had just returned to Baku from Nakhchivan City and was elected Chairman of the Supreme Council of Azerbaijan on 15 June, was subsequently voted to take over presidency in the country. On 27‚Äì29 June, Aliyev negotiated with Surat Huseynov, and as a result the latter agreed to stop his advance on the capital city in exchange to becoming Prime Minister of Azerbaijan with extensive authority over the Ministry of National Security of Azerbaijan, Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Internal Affairs. On 30 June, the National Assembly of Azerbaijan elected Huseynov to the requested office. Escape, conviction and later release Surat Huseynov, now Prime Minister, reportedly expressed dissatisfaction with Heydar Aliyev signing the so-called \\"Contract of the Century\\" with the international oil consortium AIOC, which allowed Western companies to extract Azerbaijani oil in the Caspian Sea. According to Huseynov, such infringement of Russian interests in the region would not lead to positive outcomes for Azerbaijan. Some saw that as a manifestation of Huseynov's pro-Russian agenda which went back to his active contacts with Russian military commanders in 1990‚Äì1993. On 5 October 1994, riot squads reportedly accompanied by Huseynov's units attempted a coup d'√©tat, supported by the military, against Aliyev, which was immediately suppressed. Huseynov fled to Russia. Negotiations with the Russian government resulted in Huseynov's extradition to Azerbaijan on 26 March 1997, where he was charged with treason and attempted coup, among other crimes. The arrest was performed simultaneously with the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Azerbaijan and Russia, and a contract by which the Russian oil company LUKoil was to exploit the oil field of Yalama. On 15 February 1999, Surat Huseynov was sentenced to life in prison (highest form of punishment in Azerbaijan).Sentenced to Life by Ekaterina Fartova. –ë–µ–ª–æ—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è –¥–µ–ª–æ–≤–∞—è –≥–∞–∑–µ—Ç–∞. 19 February 1999.

His resulting \\"dynamic-strategy theory\\" has been employed to analyse the fluctuating fortunes of life over the past 4,000 million years (myrs) and of human society over the past 2 myrs; to analyse contemporary economic problems (inflation, financial crises, climate changehttp://econrsss.anu.edu.au/pdf/GDSC/WP010.pdf); to explore socio- political issues (population expansion, the emergence of democracy, the \\"clash of civilizations\\", disease (COVID-19) control, the failure of straegic leadership); to analyse the emergence, operation, and malfunction of the mind; and to make scientific predictions about the future.http://econrsss.anu.edu.au/pdf/GDSC/WP010.pdf New discoveries emerging from Snooks' publications include: existential schizophrenia, strategic frustration, strategic selection, the growth-inflation curve, the strategy function, the logological constant (akin to the cosmological constant), the Snooks‚ÄìPanov Vertical (or the singularity), technological paradigm shifts, the Solar Revolution, and, most importantly, the strategic logos. His body of work challenges the existing paradigms of orthodox (neo-classical) economics, climate-mitigation economics, Marxism, neo-Darwinism, evolutionary psychology, self-organisation theory, and all other supply-side systems.'' For twenty-one years, from 1989 to 2010, Snooks was the foundation Coghlan Research Professor of Economics in the Institute of Advanced Studies at the Australian National University. Currently he is the Executive Director of both the Institute of Global Dynamic Systems and IGDS Books in Canberra. He was educated at Mount Lawley Senior High School (1957‚Äì1961), the University of Western Australia (BEc,1966; MEc, 1968), and the Australian National University (PhD, 1972). Snooks has been elected Fellow of the Australian Academy of Social Sciences (1991), Fellow of the Royal Historical Society (UK) (1990), and Fellow of the Russian Academy of Humanities (2006). Books and articles Graeme Donald Snooks, May 2013 Snooks has published 30 books, including: Depression and Recovery (1974), Domesday Economy (with J. McDonald) (1986), Economics Without Time (1993), Historical Analysis in Economics (1993), Portrait of the Family within the Total Economy (1994), Was the Industrial Revolution Necessary?, (1994), The Dynamic Society (1996), The Ephemeral Civilization (1997), The Laws of History (1998), Longrun Dynamics (1998), Global Transition (1999), The Global Crisis Makers (2000), The Collapse of Darwinism (2003), The Selfcreating Mind (2006), The Coming Eclipse, or The Triumph of Climate Mitigation Over Solar Revolution (2010), Dead God Rising. Religion and Science in the Universal Life-System (2010)., , The Death of Zarathustra. Notes on Truth for the Risk-Taker (2011), Ark of the Sun: the improbable voyage of life (November 2015), Ultimate Reality & its Dissidents (March 2016), and Time's Gateway: a personal quest for ultimate reality (August 2017). Snooks' recent book, Ark of the Sun provides an overview of his thinking over five decades on the dynamics of life and human society and reveals the underlying reality of life - the strategic logos - which is the ultimate complex living system. Ultimate Reality & its Dissidents provides a unique philosophy of life based on his realist general dynamic theory. And Time's Gateway shows how these ideas emerged over the past fifty years. He is currently exploring two major issues. First, the existential dangers of metaphysical systems of thought to the survival of humanity, together with the corrective contribution of realist thinking. And second, the contribution of DNA testing to the exploration of societal dynamics over the past 60,000 years. Articles on the theory of complex living systems have been published by Snooks in Advances in Space Research (2005), Complexity (the journal of the Santa Fe Institute) (2008), and Social Evolution & History (2002, 2005, 2007). In a recent (11 November 2016) article - \\"The Triumph of Trump and the failure of the intellectuals\\" - he applies the dynamic-strategy theory to the recent US Presidential election (see Graeme Snooks, Researchgate) and provides suggestions for the type of dynamic strategy that the USA would need to pursue in order to \\"make America great again\\" and to position itself at the forefront of the forthcoming technological paradigm shift. Snooks's most recent articles include: \\"Exploding the great singularity myth\\" (February 2019), which critically examines the scientific credentials of the futuristic concept known as the Technological Singularity - an issue that can be traced back to his seminal book The Dynamic Society (1996); \\"Exploding the Great Climate Mitigation Myth\\" (May 2019), which explores the existential dangers of massive intervention in the economy; \\"Fight the Virus (COVID-19), Not the Economy! How to Avoid the 'Interventionist Storm'\\" (March 2020), which discusses the dangers of complete economic shut-down; \\"COVID-19 and the Great Lockdown Fiasco\\" (April 2020), which shows that the emerging 'lockdown depression' is the outcome of a failure of strategic leadership in Western Civilization that has been emerging since the late 20th century (see G.D. Snooks, The Global Crisis Makers: An end to progress and liberty?, Macmillan/St Martin's Press, 2000); and \\"Will the world ever recover from the Great Lockdown? Counting the costs of waging war on the economy\\", which estimates and analyses the negative impact of massive government intervention on world real GDP and GDP per capita in both the shortrun and longrun.

Bandai relaunched the card game on July 28, 2017. The game was previously released in other countries before making its debut in the United States. The game features exclusive artwork from all 3 anime series (Dragon Ball, Z, and GT) never before seen in the US. In the 2017 relaunch of the card game, Bandai plans to introduce characters from Dragon Ball Xenoverse. The game has similarities to the other CCG created by Bandai, the Naruto Collectible Card Game. Card Types and Rarity (2008 Version) The original release of the game includes four different types of cards: warrior, technique, event, and wish. Warrior cards are the characters who fight in the game, such as Goku, Gohan, Piccolo, Vegeta, Frieza, and Cell. The technique cards are various attacks that can be used against the opponent in battle, such as the Kamehameha and the Genki Dama (also referred to as the Spirit Bomb). Various events in the series are also used in the game to change the dynamics of a battle. The wish cards are cards based on wishes made in the series that can be used when the seven Dragon Balls are collected. There were different types of cards by rarity: common, uncommon, rare, super rare, and starter-exclusive super rares. There are also gold cards and holographic cards in booster packs. Styles The game features 5 different styles of cards: Super, Earth, Alien, Unique (mostly Namekian), and Villain. =Super= Z Warriors.

Updates are then shown on the user's home page using a timeline, which lists all the updates received in chronological order, and delivered to other users who have chosen to receive them. A unique feature of its timeline is horizontal scrolling which is unlike any other popular social networking or micro-blogging websites like Twitter or Facebook, where users can see more posts running horizontally across the screen, with previous plurks to the right. Each of the threads shows timestamps below the timeline frame, and a counter for the number of responses; a thread can have as many as 300 to a thousand responses. Users can respond to other users' updates from their timeline through the Plurk.com website, by private or instant messaging, or by text messaging via compatible third party applications. According to Alexa, , 70.1% of Plurk's traffic comes from Taiwan. Plurk is also ranked the 48th in Taiwan and the 1,623rd worldwide. History After months of development, Plurk was launched on May 12, 2008. The etymology of the name was explained by the developers as such: * abbreviation of 'people' and 'lurk' * portmanteau of 'play' and 'work' * acronym of peace, love, unity, respect, and karma * verb neologism, similar to how Google was eventually used as a verb While it is difficult to track down the names of the creators of Plurk, and the \\"A-Team\\" link listed under \\"creator\\" leads to a page that lacks any real information, it is known that the current CEO is Alvin Woon. In January 2013, it was announced that the company has been headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan, while it has landed [an] undisclosed amount of funding.\\" Features and technology Plurk's interface shows updates in horizontal form through a scrollable timeline written in JavaScript and updated through AJAX. Users can modify the interface using CSS and HTML scripts as well. Users can post new messages with optional 'qualifiers', which are one-word verbs used to represent a thought (e.g., 'feels', 'thinks', 'loves', etc.). There are also advanced features such as sending updates only to a subset of your friends, posting updates on events earlier in the day, and sharing images, videos, and other media. Followers are allowed, but only limited to accounts that are not set as private. Users can upload media files through YouTube, links and webcam or from their computer. Plurks can also be 'liked', as in other social sites. In addition, it has a birthday reminder feature that places a birthday cake sign on all the user's messages on his/her birthday. Every plurker has his/her own Karma value. It is recalculated based on your activities. Higher Karma can access to more emoticons. Plurk also supports group conversations between friends and allows usage of emoticons together with the usual text micro- blogging. Plurk also supports the upload of users' own pictures as emoticons. The Plurk.com developers allowed public access to the API on December 4, 2009. Due to messages being sent between users in near-realtime, many users use Plurk as an alternative to chat. Availability in other languages To help translate their base list of qualifiers/verbs, Plurk hosts its own translation website where users can submit translations of the Plurk user interface in other languages. As of July 2008, Plurk is translated into over twenty languages. Reception Plurk was occasionally referred to as a rival to Twitter, an earlier micro-blogging service, during its first year. In June 2008, Plurk received online attention when it was featured by Leo Laporte and Amber MacArthur on their net@night show in the TWiT.tv podcast network.

There may be one or more sidecar files for each source file. There may also be \\"metadata databases\\" where one database contains metadata for several source files. In most cases the relationship between the source file and the sidecar file is based on the file name; sidecar files have the same base name as the source file, but with a different extension. The problem with this system is that most operating systems and file managers have no knowledge of these relationships, and might allow the user to rename or move one of the files thereby breaking the relationship.  Examples  ;Amiga Hunk metadata :In AmigaOS, a file with a \`.info\` extension contains metadata for a companion Amiga Hunk executable file. ;Extensible Metadata Platform :Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) metadata is stored in a sidecar file when either a file format doesn't support embedded XMP metadata or if the workflow requires this. ;Connected Web Files and Folders :A file system object that associated two or more files. The file system treats connected files as a unit for purposes of moving, copying, and deleting. Some versions of Internet Explorer and Microsoft Word can save an HTML and its hyperlinked assets as such a unit. ;THM :Many digital cameras will store a .thm (thumbnail) file alongside a recorded movie, with the same base filename as the movie file. These thumbnail files are JFIF-encoded image files. This system allows for quickly displaying a still preview of the movie, and storing camera data which is not supported by the AVI file format. ;INF :Acorn filesystems support metadata such as load and execution addresses that may not be natively supported on other filesystems. A .inf file is used to store this metadata in text format, stored in a file with the same base filename, eg Menu and Menu.inf, Build.src and Build.src.inf. ;JPEG + WAV :Some digital cameras allow for voice/audio annotations with photos. These are then stored as WAV audio files alongside the JPEG photo file, with the same base filename. ;PDF + annotations Pdf viewers which allow the reader to annotate documents with comments and drawings may store these in a sidecar file, such as Xournal's .xoj files. ;RunPacker :The MS-DOS-based self-extracting archive generator RunPacker relied heavily on sidecar files because the proprietary package format PFA (packfile archive) used in it did not natively store file attributes or timestamps. To address this limitation, a backward-compatible system of auxiliary files (as called in official documentation) was implemented to store aforementioned data in volumes without changing their format. These were added to the PFA volume the same way as ordinary files, except they were marked by special characters in their name, and software made aware of this system (sometimes called ePFA, Extended PFA) processed them transparently. Older programs relying on the PFA format would simply read or extract the file along with all others found in the volume. The ePFA format was designed with further extensibility in mind, and has been actually extended with several features over time. ;Meta Information Encapsulation (MIE) :Meta Information Encapsulation sidecar files. The MIE format is an extensible, dedicated meta information format part of ExifTool. MIE files can be used to encapsulate meta information from many sources and bundle it together with any type of file. A variation of this are copies of the source file which contain largely the same information, but in a different format or from a previous version: ;Exif :Since many JPEG editing software used to destroy Exif metadata stored in digital photos, some photo cataloging applications can extract the Exif data and store that in an .exf file, so that the metadata can later be re-inserted into the JPEG file. ;Raw + JPEG :Many digital cameras allow to store both uncompressed raw data and a JFIF-encoded image file when shooting in \\"raw mode\\". This allows for faster previewing the photo, and support by applications that do not support the (often undocumented) raw format. ;TIF + TFW or JPG + JGW :Aerial photos may be supplied with a World File that determines the location, size and rotation of the image. Alternatives Rather than storing data separately, it can be stored as part of the main file. This is particularly done for container files, which allow certain types of data to be stored in them. Instead of separate files on the file system, multiple files can be combined into an archive file, which keeps them together, but requires that software processes the archive file, rather than individual files. This is a generic solution, as archive files can contain arbitrary files from the file system. =Forks= A file system level solution for the same problem are forks, which allow multiple pieces of data to be associated with a single file. Sidecar files can be seen as \\"forks for file systems without native support for forks\\". These can then be manipulated with usual file system tools: because the support is built into the operating system, these resource forks will not show up as separate files, and all applications inherit support for resource forks. However, forks cannot be copied to file systems without support for forks, or transmitted over a channel that does not support forks. For interchange forks are generally instead stored as sidecar file. Mac OS and OS X are notable examples of operating systems with support for forks, in the HFS file system. However, this causes problems with exchanging over ISO 9660 format CD-ROM, FAT format MS-DOS disks, and over internet email, and requires the use of sidecar files to store this information. Microsoft NTFS supports Alternate Data Streams which are similar.

Both sisters were fond of music since childhood, and received inspiration and support from their mother, Kim.The Callen Sisters Interview, Off The Record Magazine, March 7, 2008 They both learned piano at a young age, both played woodwind instruments (Jessa - flute, Beth - clarinet), and then both played guitar. The sisters both played in their school's Jazz band, Jessa on guitar and Beth on bass guitar. Jessa switched to harp after their move to Upstate New York in the late '90s. Jessa later received formal training in composition and harp and earned her BM in music composition with a minor in harp performance. She became a professional harpist and accomplished studio musician, having recorded for several film scores and artists' solo albums.Jessa Callen entry in Harp Mall The sisters had been performing together since high school and both decided to enroll at SUNY Purchase to pursue their musical dreams. A series of family losses, including Karen (their aunt), Kim (their mother) and Dorothy (their grandmother) in the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively, enhanced their closeness. They found refuge in each other and in their music, which enriched their songwriting qualities and deep compassion. This became the catalyst of the formation of The Callen Sisters. Their premiere performance after formation was August 22, 2006 along with Dan Castellani on keyboards, Chris Anderson on bass, and Dave Gluck on drums. Their debut self-titled album was released in October 2007 with Dan Castellani as producer, arranger and keyboardist of the album. Both sisters share songwriting and vocal roles (6 from Jessa and 6 from Beth) with several studio musicians. Their songs deal with the personal experiences, societal insights, and raw emotions of both sisters. Their music is influenced by Fiona Apple and Tori Amos, Jimi Hendrix and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. The interplay between Jessa's harp and Beth's guitar with their voices, creates a unique sound effect. Jessa plays Camac Harps and Beth plays Taylor Guitars.

Initially there were two lines with a central platform as well as side ones according to Billson. Victorian civil engineer Francis Whishaw described the station as: > \\"The elevation next to the road to Nottingham is of plain but neat design. > It consists of a central portion and two wings; the central portion contains > the entrance hall, which is of the whole height of the building. In the > right wing is the booking office for first and second class passengers, with > windows (looking to the hall) at which the passengers receive their tickets; > the third class passengers obtain their tickets at a counter fixed in the > hall. In the left-wing is the boardroom and clerks offices; and in a > building projecting towards the passenger shed in the rear is a waiting room > for ladies.'' The [train] shed is covered with a light iron roof in two > spans, which is supported on the departure side by a brick wall, in which > there are eight windows; and on the arrival side, and along the middle line, > by two rows of cast iron columns, nine in each row.\\" However, Whishaw in 1840 writes the station had grown to four lines. As was usual in those days there were \\"as many turntables without the shed; the cross line intersecting which communicates with the carriage wharf or landing, which is on the arrival side\\". This arrangement would probably be similar to that at Derby, allowing coaches to be manhandled between tracks to form trains. On the north side the station was next to the canal and a small warehouse allowed for transshipment of cargoes between the canal and railway. The original gateposts to the yard and the bridge under the towpath still survive. The first member of the British Royal Family to travel by train was Dowager Queen Adelaide who took a train provided by the Midland Counties Railway from Nottingham to Derby, where another train provided by the North Midland Railway transported Her Majesty to Leeds on 22 July 1840. In view of plans by the Midland Railway, as it had become, to extend the line to Lincoln two extra lines with platforms were added on the south side of the station crossing Carrington Street on the level. However, by the time the Lincoln line opened in 1846, it was clear that the station could not cope. Not only was there additional traffic from the Erewash Valley Line, and a line from Mansfield was planned, the Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway had been approved with running rights over the Midland metals into the station. Accordingly, a new station was built beyond Carrington Street on the West Croft fronting a newly built Station Street. This station Nottingham Midland opened in 1848. The site of the station is now occupied by Nottingham Magistrates' Court.

The station opened with the line on 15 March 1899, and served the Nottingham suburb of Carrington until 1928.  History  The station was opened by the Great Central Railway on its London Extension and was one of only two original stations on the line to have its platforms on each side, rather than having a single central island. It served a relatively affluent residential area about a mile to the north of the city centre along the Mansfield Road, and thus was popular with business people, and was built in a deep cutting 154 yards (140 metres) in length between the Sherwood Rise and Mansfield Road Tunnels. Had it not been for Carrington station the line would have remained underground here.Anderson, P.H., (1985 2nd ed) Forgotten Railways Vol 2: The East Midlands, Newton Abbot: David and Charles There were small waiting rooms on the platforms, but the booking office and main buildings were at street level with a long path leading down to the platforms. However, by the time the station was opened, the city's horse tram network was already well established and by 1901 the tramlines were converted to electricity. This limited the station's usage. It was closed to passenger services on 24 September 1928 - the first station on the Great Central Main Line to close. The line itself closed on 5 September 1966 to passengers and completely on 25 March 1968. There were never any goods facilities at Carrington. The street-level buildings continued to be used at various times as businesses, including the \\"Alldogs Poodle Parlour\\" and a sweet shop, but have now been demolished. The cutting has been filled in to street level, and the Clarendon Park regional facility of the Open University now occupies the site, just north of the east end of Gregory Boulevard, between Sherwood Road and Mansfield Road. Shafts have been provided to maintain access to the tunnels for inspection and maintenance purposes. There was another station in Nottingham called Carrington Street, later superseded by the present Nottingham station.

He and four slaves of the ≈åi temple served in the Jinshin War of 672 and fought at the Battle of Nakatsu-michi. His name appears in the history book Nihon Shoki at the Battle of Nakatsu-michi of Yamato Province at the beginning of the 7th month of the year 672 (by the Japanese calendar). Yamato had been one of the two major fronts of the war. ≈åtomo no Fukei, the commander general of this front for Prince ≈åama's (Emperor Tenmu) side, divided his army into three divisions along the Kamitsu-michi (\\"upper road\\"), Nakatsu-michi (\\"middle road\\") and Shimotsu-michi (\\"lower road\\"). Enemy general Inukai no Isokimi dispatched his commander Ioi no Kujira and sent 200 soldiers against the thin center of Fukei. Five slaves of ≈åi temple, including Tokomaro, took the lead in the defence and shot arrows, which stopped Ioi's advance. Then Fukei's right division broke Inukai's left at Kamitsu-michi, and rushed to the rear of the enemy, turning the flank. Yamato province was won by Fukei soon after this battle.

It is in the town of Ludington in Michigan's Lower Peninsula.  History  The area early in its history attracted several lumbermen because of the abundance of white pine timber. Among these early settlers in the area were Burr Caswell, Charles Mears, James Ludington, and Eber Brock Ward. The area began settlement when Burr Caswell moved to the area in 1847 from the state of New York. He built a frame house from driftwood in 1849. This was the first frame building in Mason County and is still at White Pine Village. Burr Caswell The Caswell farmhouse served as the first official county seat and as the first courthouse structure. Caswell moved his family upstairs and turned the first floor of his farmhouse over to Mason County to use for a courthouse and trading post. There was even a jail below the house. The Mason County Historical Society restored Caswell's house and the house is now part of \\"Historic White Pine Village\\". There were two additional structures before the final present day fourth structure was built in 1893 to serve as Mason County's courthouse. Mason County was officially organized in 1855. The official county seat of Mason County and its courthouse was determined to be at Burr Caswell's farmhouse at that time. Prior to then the area was an unofficial settlement in the upper northwestern part of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. The Caswell farmhouse was the county courthouse until 1861. In 1861 the county seat moved to Little Sable (later called Lincoln Village). In 1873 the permanent county seat moved to the town of Pere Marquette in Pere Marquette Township of Mason County. The town name of Pere Marquette was changed to \\"Ludington\\" because of its developer James Ludington, a wealthy Milwaukee businessman, and officially incorporated as a city the same year. The 1873 brick courthouse was built at 407 E. Pere Marquette Street.Ludington Daily News article by James L. Cabot, November 9, 1991, p. 4, Public library, one of the earliest institutions The land was donated by Charles Resseguie.  Present building  The present multi-story building was erected between 1893 and 1894. The tower clock was built by Nels Johnson as one of his Century tower clocks and installed in 1907. The building was designed by the architect Sidney J. Osgood from Grand Rapids, Michigan. It is a Richardsonian Romanesque structure built of Jacobsville sandstone from Houghton County in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The courthouse is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and also as Michigan Registered Site L0404. Since October 2010 the tower clock has had thirteen strikes of the clock bell at 1 o'clock, day or night.Ludington Daily News, Oct 21, 2010, A4, Reader's Forum, Is the county courthouse haunted?  State Historical Marker  According to a News Release Mason County Courthouse receives State Historical Marker on 18 May 2000 by the Mason County Historical Society, the Director Ronald M.

History The Burns Lake area had numerous small rural schools in operation in the early part of the 1900s. Most students did not continue their education beyond the teen years. Ranching, trapping, farming and saw milling required the help of all family members. The first small group of students entered Burns Lake Superior School in Burns Lake in 1934, but only one student stayed to graduate in 1936. This was William Wren Gilgan (1917‚Äì2012). A special recognition has been placed in the graduate hallway at LDSS to honor Mr. Gilgan. As the population in the area grew a new school replaced the old building in 1951 and was situated along Highway 16. In 1962, the high school became known as Lakes District Secondary and the nickname \\"Lakers\\" was adopted soon after. From 1951 to the late 1980s, this school site was expanded and redeveloped several times. A student residence building was built in 1965 to support students from the rural communities surrounding Burns Lake. After bussing routes improved in the late 1970s, the residence building became a resource center, offices and an alternative school. In the mid-1990s, the building was deemed too old to renovate, so work began on a new high school. Budget delays and government changes pushed the construction back to 2001. In 2003, a new and modern high school was completed adjacent to the old school on Highway 16. Location Lakes District Secondary School (LDSS) is located at 685 Yellowhead Highway 16 in Burns Lake, BC. Burns Lake is located in the heart of northern British Columbia, about 228 km west of Prince George on Highway 16. The Village has a diverse population of 3,649 residents (including Ts'il Kaz Koh and Lake Babine Nation) and serves a surrounding area of approximately 10,000 residents in the Regional District of Bulkley-Nechako. Surrounded by nature, there are numerous options for recreational activities. Such activities include but are not limited to a wide variety of hiking trails, canoeing and kayaking areas and an abundance of lakes to fish and boat on. Burns Lake is also fortunate to have world class mountain biking trails, with more than 13 km (8 miles) of downhill trails and 7 km (4 miles) of cross-country trails, located just five minutes from the Village center on Boer Mountain. Spirit Square adjacent to Radley Beach is a community waterfront park complete with recreation and meeting areas for both residents and visitors alike; Spirit Square also boasts free fitness stations, tennis courts, a playground, skate park, public docks, picnic tables, and a boat launch. Breakfast Program Through donations from local businesses and the Breakfast Club of Canada, LDSS offers a free and healthy breakfast each day for students. A variety of fruits, bagels, yogurts, oatmeal, and cereals are served to \\"feed learning\\". Thursdays feature a hot breakfast from the grill, including waffles and pancakes. The food is served from 8:15‚Äì8:45 from the concession in the Multipurpose Room (MPR) by members of the Student Voice & Interact Club. All donations to the Breakfast program over $100 are eligible for a tax receipt. Energy Monitoring System LDSS has an energy monitoring system that allows students, staff, and community members to view the electrical usage of the building in several formats. LDSS is the first school in the district to have such a device installed. The goal is to reduce energy usage through education, new technology and input from the people that come to LDSS each day. The energy monitor is located just inside the main doors in full public view. Administration *H. Grant, Principal *A. Hogarth, Vice-Principal *C. Seguin, Superintendent of Schools *M.

It is run by the UK-based Poetry Society and accepts entries from all over the world, with over 10,000 poems being submitted to the competition each year. Winning has been an important milestone in the careers of many well- known poets. Carol Ann Duffy, the current UK Poet Laureate, won in 1983 with 'Whoever She Was'. Looking back in 2007 she commented: \\"in those days, one was still called a 'poetess' ‚Äì so it meant a lot, as a young woman poet, to begin to try to change that\\". Christopher James, the 2008 winner, commented \\"if there is an unspoken Grand Slam circuit for poetry prizes, then the National Poetry Competition is definitely Wimbledon ‚Äì it's the one everyone dreams of winning\\". Other prestigious names to have won the competition include Ruth Padel, Jo Shapcott, Sin√©ad Morrissey, Ian Duhig, Colette Bryce and the poet and novelist Helen Dunmore. The competition runs annually, opening in the spring and closing at the end of October. A new team of judges (made up of three respected poets) is announced each year.

Subsequent revisions of the book were published in 1986, 1989, 2000, and 2008. Plot summary The first few chapters following the brief introduction about Bundy's birth and family describe Rule's friendship with Bundy, her first impressions of him, and her reluctance to consider the evidence that he might be responsible for the crimes of which he was accused. She met Bundy in 1971 when he was a psychology student at the University of Washington and contemplating a career in law and politics. They worked together at a crisis center taking telephone calls from those at risk of suicide or facing other difficulties. Rule considered Bundy \\"kind, solicitous, and empathetic\\". Rule and Bundy developed a close friendship, sharing meals and conversations. Over a decade older than Bundy, Rule later stated that she would have trusted Bundy to care for her young children. They fell out of contact in late 1973 after he stopped working at the crisis center. Starting in early 1974, a series of brutal murders of young women in the Seattle area shocked the city and gained major attention. Women were killed at a rate of roughly once every 30 days. Bundy was considered a possible suspect from the summer of 1974, when the unidentified killer was observed by several witnesses talking with two young women who later disappeared at Lake Sammamish State Park. The man was described as tall, handsome and identified himself as \\"Ted.\\" A sketch based on eyewitness descriptions was noted by several people‚Äîincluding Rule‚Äîto resemble Bundy. Rule thought it unlikely that Bundy was a killer but nonetheless reported him to police. However, authorities were overwhelmed with tips regarding the murders and did not initially believe Bundy was a likely suspect due to his superficially respectable persona. Bundy relocated to Salt Lake City in late 1974 after being admitted to law school at the University of Utah. The killings in Seattle suddenly stopped, but young women in Utah, Colorado and Idaho began disappearing and being murdered under similar circumstances to the Seattle-area crimes. Police investigators in several states began sharing information, increasingly narrowing down on Bundy as their suspect in the string of unsolved murders. In September 1975, Bundy telephoned Rule from Salt Lake, requesting help via her police department contacts to know why police in Seattle were serving subpoenas for his school records from Utah. He did not mention that in August 1975 he had been arrested and charged with the November 1974 kidnapping of a young woman who had been abducted by a man who posed as a police officer in Murray, Utah. After a bench trial, Bundy was sentenced to 1 to 15 years in Utah. He was extradited to Colorado to face murder charges, but Rule was still resistant to admitting that her friend was a possible killer. Bundy twice escaped from custody in Colorado, sending letters or postcards to Rule while on the run. He proclaimed his innocence and asked for money to help enter Canada. The fugitive eventually made his way to Florida. In January 1978, he went on a rampage at a Chi Omega sorority house at Florida State University, beating several women (two of whom later died). In The Stranger Beside Me, this incident is narrated in third person, but not omnisciently, as the perpetrator is not identified as being Bundy, thus keeping the documentation of these events in-sync with the knowledge available to officers at the time Rule wrote. Bundy went on to kill another adult woman and rape and kill a 12-year-old girl whom he snatched from outside her school. It is not until Bundy's capture in February 1978, and his subsequent trials in Florida when Bundy represented himself in court, that Rule fully accepts that Bundy is a serial killer. The turning point, Rule states, came after forensic dentists testified that Bundy's teeth matched the deep bite mark on the body of one of the Florida State victims. This was the first physical evidence that definitely linked him to the crimes, making it impossible for Rule to maintain doubt about his guilt. Rule finds the idea shocking to the point that she \\"[runs] to the ladies room and throws up.\\"Rule, Ann. The Stranger Beside Me. Signet, 2000, paperback. 548 pages. . Updated 20th-anniversary edition. pp. 390. An afterword, following Rule's lament for Bundy and his victims, describes the trial of Bundy for the murder of 12-year- old Kimberly Leach in Florida. Bundy was sentenced to death in Florida. He continued to assert innocence for several years, but shortly before execution confessed to over 30 murders in an apparent bid to delay his death. The 1989 update outlines Bundy's execution, and the 2000 update touches on many things, including various women claiming to have encountered Bundy in the 1970s, Robert Keppel's retirement from detective work and his employment at the University of Washington, and Bundy's possible involvement in the unsolved disappearance of Ann Marie Burr, a girl who disappeared in 1961 when Bundy was 14.Rule, Ann. The Stranger Beside Me. Signet, 2000, paperback. 548 pages. . Updated 20th-anniversary edition. A 2008 update of the book includes more stories from women who have contacted Rule with stories of their \\"near-miss\\" contacts with a man they believe was Ted Bundy, and also a \\"Ted Bundy FAQ\\" section in which Rule tries to answer the questions most frequently asked by readers, including the fact that he was not responsible for the 1973 murder of Kathy Merry Devine, for which he was long suspected. DNA profiling linked that killing to an ex-convict named William Cosden, who was subsequently tried and convicted of her murder.
