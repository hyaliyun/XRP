The first official show took place between 21 and 24 April 1900, at the Castle of Valentino, becoming a permanent fixture in Turin from 1938 having shared it with Milan and Rome until that time. From 1972, the show was held biannually and in 1984, it moved into Fiat's shuttered Lingotto factory. By July 2000, the show was to be moved from the time frame of July, to the time frame of April, it was proposed the new show to be held in April 2002. The event was last held in Turin in June 2000, and cancelled from February 2002, resulting in the Bologna Motor Show taking over the role of Italy's International Motor Show. From 2015 to 2019, Turin again held a Motor Show, albeit as an open air festival to keep exhibitors' costs down, and provide free access to the public. It is held in the precinct of the Parco del Valentino.

Born Fanny Mooney in New Orleans, Louisiana, she married Charles Sellins in St. Louis, Missouri. After his death she worked in a garment factory to support her four children. She helped to organize Local # 67 of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union in St. Louis, where she became a negotiator for 400 women locked out of a garment factory. Thus she came to the attention of Van Bittner, president of District 5 of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). In 1913, she moved to begin work for the mine workers union in West Virginia. Her work, she wrote, was to distribute \\"clothing and food to starving women and babies, to assist poverty stricken mothers and bring children into the world, and to minister to the sick and close the eyes of the dying.\\" She was arrested once in Colliers, West Virginia for defying an anti- union injunction. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson intervened for her release. Sellins had promised to obey the judge's order against picketing. She returned to Colliers from Fairmont, W.Va. and immediately broke her promise by challenging U.S. District Court Judge Alston G. Dayton to arrest her. He did. With the help of U.S. Congressman Matthew M. Neely, the UMWA waged a public relations campaign to obtain a presidential pardon for Sellins. The union printed thousands of postcards with a photo of Sellins sitting behind the bars of her jail cell in Fairmont. On the back side of the card was the address of the White House. Philip Murray hired Sellins to join the staff of the UMWA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1919, she was assigned to the Allegheny River Valley district to direct picketing by striking miners at Allegheny Coal and Coke Company. On August 26, she witnessed guards beating Joseph Starzeleski, a picketing miner, who was killed. When she intervened, deputies shot and killed her with four bullets, then a deputy used a cudgel to fracture her skull. Others said that she was attempting to protect miners' children that were on scene. She was buried from St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church in New Kensington, Pennsylvania on August 29 and interred at Union Cemetery in Arnold. A coroner's jury in 1919 ruled her death justifiable homicide and blamed Sellins for starting the riot which led to her death although other witnesses portrayed a different event than the deputies at the scene. The union and her family raised money to hire a lawyer to press a criminal investigation and pressure officials to reopen the investigation. A grand jury in Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, indicted three deputies for the killings but a trial in 1923 ended in acquittal for the two men accused of her murder. The actual gunman, John Pearson, never appeared for his trial and never was seen again.

MGP has a high affinity binding to calcium ions, similar to other Gla-containing proteins. The protein acts as an inhibitor of vascular mineralization and plays a role in bone organization. MGP is found in a number of body tissues in mammals, birds, and fish. Its mRNA is present in bone, cartilage, heart, and kidney. It is present in bone together with the related vitamin K2-dependent protein osteocalcin. In bone, its production is increased by vitamin D.  Genetics  The MGP was linked to the short arm of chromosome 12 in 1990. Its mRNA sequence length is 585 bases long in humans.  Physiology  MGP and osteocalcin are both calcium-binding proteins that may participate in the organisation of bone tissue. Both have glutamate residues that are post-translationally carboxylated by the enzyme gamma-glutamyl carboxylase in a reaction that requires Vitamin K hydroquinone.  Role in disease  Abnormalities in the MGP gene have been linked with Keutel syndrome, a rare condition characterised by abnormal calcium deposition in cartilage, peripheral stenosis of the pulmonary artery, and midfacial hypoplasia. Mice that lack MGP develop to term but die within two months as a result of arterial calcification which leads to blood-vessel rupture.

Her claim to mainstream fame was her sole film role in which she played the interfering grandmother of Amy Irving in Joan Micklin Silver's film Crossing Delancey (1988). She also appeared in a memorable Law and Order episode \\"Night and Fog\\" which aired in season 3. Life and career She was an enduring star of the Yiddish stage in New York City, and earlier in Poland and Argentina, appearing in hundreds of productions, often as a comedian and later as the familiar mother or mother- in-law character who often stole the show. She began acting in the Yiddish theater in Poland at the age of 5 or 6, performing first with her parents and then with Max Bozyk, whom she later married. Max and Reizl Bozyk and their daughter were traveling on performances and were in Argentina in 1939 when the Nazis overran Poland. They had left behind a son, who was killed. They came to New York City in 1941. For nearly three decades, they were inseparable on the Yiddish stage, starring in one play or revue after another. Summers were spent performing in the Borscht Belt. In an interview when Crossing Delancey opened, Bozyk joked that the 37 years spent with her husband had been like 74 because they'd spent their entire days and nights together. In 1970, after a performance at New York's Town Hall, her husband collapsed and died. Reizl continued to appear in performances, touring the country in Yiddish revues. She went on to appear in New York's \\"Town Hall\\" with the celebrated Israeli star Mary Soreano and all star revues. In 1989, she played her first stage role in English, appearing in the comedy Social Security directed by Peter Lowey at the Forum Theater in Metuchen, New Jersey. The following year she recreated her Crossing Delancey role on stage in Florida, and was due to tour again when she suddenly died.

Early years and marriage Lila Mar√≠a Mercedes Mayoral Wirshing was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, in 1942. Her parents were Juan Eugenio Mayoral Renovales (1906‚Äì1967), an industrialist, founder and president of Ponce Candy Industries, and Julita Wirshing Serrall√©s. Her paternal grandparents were Joaquin Mayoral Montalvo (1878‚Äì1911), who was born and died in Ponce, and Maria Renovales Rodriguez (1879‚Äì1964), who was born in Ponce and died in Caracas, Venezuela. She was the second of four sisters: Julita Mercedes, Ana In√©s and Eugenia. She began her studies at the Liceo Ponce√±o in Ponce, and finished high school at the Dana Hall School in Wellesley, Massachusetts. During this time she met Rafael Hern√°ndez Col√≥n, who was a young law student. Mayoral Wirshing and Hern√°ndez Col√≥n married on 24 October 1959. They had four children: Rafael, Jos√© Alfredo, Dora Mercedes and Juan Eugenio. First Lady of Puerto Rico: 1973‚Äì1977 Lila Mayoral became First Lady of Puerto Rico when her husband was elected Governor in the 1972 general elections. She remained in the position until he lost the 1976 elections. As first lady, she distinguished herself for her dedication to the community. For example, after Hurricane Eloise caused significant damage in Puerto Rico, Mayoral organized a benefit concert to aid those affected by the storm. Return to private life and college: 1977‚Äì1984 After her husband was defeated in his bid for another term in La Fortaleza, Mayoral Wirshing returned to college to finish her degree.

Also, after Hurricane Hugo affected the island, Mayoral acted as liaison between the government and the community to synchronize fund-raising efforts to help the victims of that storm. She was president of the board of directors of Dale la Mano a Puerto Rico, a public-private partnership that organized a marathon which raised $15.6 million in help funds. Mayoral led a school anti-drug campaign called \\"Abre tus ojos a un mundo sin drogas\\" (Open your eyes to a world without drugs).

French career  In 1780, Caton was part of the squadron under Guichen, captained by Georges-Fran√ßois de Framond. Caton was later attached to the squadron commanded by De Grasse. She took part in the Battle of Martinique on 17 April 1780, as well as in the two smaller engagements of 15 and 19 May 1780. At the Battle of Fort Royal, on 29 April 1781, Caton was one of the four ships to come reinforce the squadron under De Grasse, along with Victoire, R√©fl√©chi and Solitaire. She took part in the Battle of the Chesapeake on 5 September 1781. On 10 April 1782, in the run-up to the Battle of the Saintes, Caton found herself becalmed and Framond asked for assistance. Despite having been sent a frigate, Framond decided to anchor at Basse-Terre without authorisation from his hierarchy. He thus failed to take part in the Battle of the Saintes, and a few days after, on 19 April 1782, Caton was captured at the Battle of the Mona Passage.  British Career  Caton was captured by the Royal Navy at the Battle of the Mona Passage on 19 April 1782, and commissioned as the third rate HMS Caton. She sailed with the fleet for England on 25 July 1782 but was said to have been lost later that year in a hurricane storm off Newfoundland on 16‚Äì17 September, along with the other captured French prize ships Ville de Paris, and Hector. In fact, she struggled to reach Halifax NS. On 26 January 1783, a small British convoy of eight military transports sailed out of Halifax for England; accompanied by Caton, and escorted by the 36-gun frigate HMS Pallas. Later she became a prison hospital ship at Plymouth and was placed on harbour service in 1798, and sold out of the service in 1815.

Original caption reads: \\"Fight against terrorists in France. Communist terrorist groups are attempting to disrupt the German security measures. The Wehrmachtbericht reports daily on successes against the saboteurs. In the marketplace the first interrogations take place.\\" Wehrmachtbericht (literally: \\"Armed forces report\\", usually translated as Wehrmacht communiqu√© or Wehrmacht report) was the daily Wehrmacht High Command mass-media communiqu√© and a key component of Nazi propaganda during World War II. Produced by the Propaganda Department of the OKW (Wehrmacht Propaganda Troops), it covered Germany's military situation and was broadcast daily on the Reich Broadcasting Corporation of Nazi Germany. All broadcasts were authorized by the Reich Ministry of Propaganda under Joseph Goebbels. Despite the latter's attempts to temper excessive optimism, they often exaggerated the success of the German army, leading historian Aristotle Kallis to describe their tone as \\"triumphalist\\". Both civilian and military authorities considered the Wehrmachtbericht to be a vital instrument of German home-front mobilisation, the civilian contribution to the German war effort, especially after the defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad. According to historians Wolfram Wette and Daniel Uziel, the final 9 May 1945 communiqu√© laid the foundation for the myth of the clean Wehrmacht, the notion that the Wehrmacht had fought honourably and was not implicated in the crimes of the Nazi regime, for which (according to the myth) only the SS bore responsibility. Production During World War II, the Wehrmacht communiqu√© (Wehrmachtbericht ) was the official news communication medium about the military situation of the Reich, and was intended for both domestic and foreign consumption. The communiqu√© was produced by a special propaganda department attached to the Wehrmacht Chief of Operation Staff, general Alfred Jodl, in the Wehrmacht High Command (the OKW). Commanded by general Hasso von Wedel, the department oversaw the growing number of propaganda companies of the Wehrmacht Propaganda Troops (Wehrmachtpropaganda), the propaganda wing of the Wehrmacht (in the army, the air force and the navy) and the Waffen-SS. At its peak in 1942, the propaganda troops included 15,000 men. 1940 exhibition of photographs produced by the propaganda companies during the invasion of Poland. The exhibit was organized by the . The planning for propaganda activities by the Wehrmacht began in 1938. Joseph Goebbels, the head of Ministry of Propaganda, sought to establish effective cooperation with the Wehrmacht to ensure a smooth flow of propaganda materials from the front. He deferred to the military in setting up and controlling the propaganda companies, but provided assistance in supplying personnel. These troops, who were trained soldiers, were responsible for preparing the combat reports to be used as source material for the OKW communiqu√©s. The propaganda companies were only news-reporting units in areas of military operation, as civilian news correspondents were prohibited from entering combat zones. The troops produced the written, audio and film materials from the front and sent them to a processing center in Germany, where they were reviewed by censors, mostly for security purposes. The filtered materials were then forwarded to the Ministry of Propaganda for immediate dissemination. All Wehrmachtbericht broadcasts were authorized by Goebbels's ministry as the controlling institution of the German media. A Ministry of Propaganda official attended daily Wehrmacht conferences, where the initial versions of the communiqu√© were provided to state and party officials. Goebbels's day at the ministry began with his adjutant reading out the text of the communiqu√©s to him. While Goebbels did not have a final say in what went into the communiqu√©s, he made sure that officials from his ministry worked closely with the Wehrmacht Propaganda Department. The first communiqu√© aired with the start of World War II on 1 September 1939 and the last one was issued on 9 May 1945. The communiqu√©s were broadcast daily on the Reich Broadcasting Corporation and published in the press. From 12 May 1940 onwards, Major of the OKW Propaganda Department was given the task of adding commentary to them, both on the radio (21:00 to 21:15) and in the press. The commentaries were aimed at the civilian audience, and were written in layman's language so that the population could easily grasp the daily military developments. The communiqu√©s were read twice, the first at a normal speed, and a second time more slowly, to enable them to be transcribed by listeners. Operation Barbarossa In the summer of 1941, during Operation Barbarossa, the communiqu√©s created an image of uninterrupted successful advances by Germany deep into the Soviet territory, with historian Aristotle Kallis describing the tone of the early Wehrmacht reports as \\"triumphalist\\". As the operation progressed, however, it was more and more difficult to sustain the illusion of a swift and decisive victory. The subsequent reports were at times in stark contrast with the deteriorating situation on the ground, which was noted by the German troops. After the Soviet Yelnya Offensive east of Smolensk in early September 1941, a German infantryman wrote: > Officially it was called a \\"planned withdrawal\\" (...). But to me it was so > much bullshit. The next day, we heard on the radio, in the 'news from the > front' (Wehrmachtbericht) about the \\"successful front correction\\" in our > Yelnya defensive lines and the enormous losses we inflicted on the enemy. > But no single word was heard about a retreat, about the hopelessness of the > situation, about the mental and emotional numbness of the German soldiers. > In short, it was again a \\"victory\\". But we on the front line were running > back like rabbits in front of the fox. This metamorphosis of the truth from > \\"all shit\\" to \\"it was a victory\\" baffled me, and those of my comrades who > dared to think. Starting in August 1941, when it became clear to some in the Propaganda Ministry and the Wehrmacht high command that the war would likely extend into 1942, Goebbels grew increasingly concerned about the triumphant tone of the communiques. However, a string of spectacular victories in September, especially in the Battle of Kiev, removed any restraint from the texts, making propagandists's work more difficult later on, when they had to explain the Wehrmacht's failures to the German public which was rapidly losing confidence in a swift victory. Because of the competing goals, approaches and chains of command, along with the chaotic nature of the regime itself, the propaganda materials produced by Goebbels's ministry, the OKW and Hitler's press chief, Otto Dietrich, did not always agree in tone or assessment of the situation. After the assault on Moscow, Operation Typhoon, began on 2 October 1941, Goebbels described in his diary the \\"excessive optimism\\" that was developing in the population after the announcements about the initial rapid advance of the German forces. Concerned about an \\"almost illusionistic\\" mood, he instructed the press to adopt a more cautious approach and spoke to Jodl about tempering down the tone of the Wehrmacht communiqu√©s. Nonetheless, the broadcast on 16 October announced that the first defensive line in front of Moscow had been broken, being still \\"too optimistic\\" for Goebbels. The Battle of Stalingrad The Wehrmachtbericht communiqu√©s around the 1942 summer campaign and the defeat of the German army in the Battle of Stalingrad provide another case study on their effects on Germany's population and the evolution of the propaganda efforts themselves. In August 1942, the name \\"Stalingrad\\" was featured prominently in the communiqu√©s even before the Wehrmacht reached the outskirts of the city. The communiqu√©s were factual and restrained; nevertheless, Goebbels issued instructions to the German press to exercise \\"cautious optimism\\" so as not to set expectations too high among the population. The Soviet counter-offensive, Operation Uranus, broke the thinly- held German flanks on 19 November; by 22 November, the encirclement of the 6th Army was complete. The concern of the propaganda organisations, both military and civilian, was how to present this military disaster to the public. Initially, every effort was made to hide the true scope of the events from the population. The communiqu√©s published between 19 and 24 November merely mentioned the Soviet attack in the southern sector of the East front, not addressing the extent of Wehrmacht's difficulties. From 24 November onward, the Wehrmacht communiqu√©s began acknowledging the Soviet breakthrough and described \\"heavy fighting\\", but provided no references to the encirclement. The reports by the SD, the security and intelligence service of the SS, indicated that the 24 November report caused alarm among the population. There were periods where the OKW dispatches did not mention Stalingrad at all. Wild rumors describing 100,000 German troops trapped at Stalingrad were beginning to circulate, as some Germans were able to get the news from foreign radio. On 16 January 1943, the dispatch finally mentioned that the 6th Army was fighting the enemy \\"on all sides\\", thus acknowledging the encirclement, but little was said about the situation in subsequent reports. Meanwhile, Goebbels was working behind the scenes to advance his program of mobilisation of the population for the \\"total war\\", using the impending defeat at Stalingrad as a rallying cry. Getting the go-ahead from Hitler, Goebbels launched the effort in the late winter of 1943. The state propaganda after that focused on the home-front mobilization, the civilian contribution to the German war effort, with this message continuing through the rest of the war. Impact Despite occasional mis-alignment of messages, with the tone of the Wehrmacht communiqu√©s being too exuberant for Goebbels, a self-described \\"realist\\", the relations between the military and civilian propaganda organizations proved successful throughout the war. Friction was low, even though several apologetic postwar publications, such as an account provided by Wedel, described the relations between them as problematic. Both Goebbels and Jodl considered the Wehrmachtbericht a vital instrument of the German home-front mobilization, especially after the defeat at Stalingrad. From the onset, according to historian Daniel Uziel, the Nazi propaganda machine regarded the Wehrmacht communiqu√©s as \\"possessing a future value, besides the immediate use as news delivery medium\\". Along with all the other propaganda materials produced by the Wehrmacht, the underlying message was the supposed \\"superiority of the German warrior's spirit and character\\". The final broadcast, issued by the D√∂nitz Government, aired on 9 May 1945 and read in part: > Since midnight the weapons on all the fronts are silent. By the order of the > Grand Admiral D√∂nitz, the Wehrmacht ceased its hopeless fighting. With this, > a nearly 6-year heroic struggle has ended. It brought us great victories but > also heavy defeats. The Wehrmacht has been honorably defeated by superior > forces. The German soldier, in accordance with his oath, has given his > unforgettable effort to his people. Till the end the homeland supported him > with all its strength, under the heaviest sacrifices. The singular > performance of the front and Fatherland shall receive its final honor in the > later, fair judgement. The achievements and sacrifices of German soldiers at > sea, on the land and in the air has not escaped the notice of our enemy. > Therefore, every soldier can hold his head high, and proudly lay his weapon > down. He can start to work bravely and confidently the bitterest hour of our > history, for the eternal life of our people. Those words were intended for public consumption by the now defeated nation. According to Uziel, in this final radio address, the Wehrmacht propagandists hoped to set the frame of reference for the entire war effort of 1939‚Äì45. In this they were successful; the last communiqu√© helped lay the foundation for the legend of the \\"clean Wehrmacht\\", the notion that Wehrmacht had fought honourably and professionally, and was not in any way implicated in the crimes of the Nazi regime, for which (according to the myth) the SS bore sole responsibility. This assessment is echoed by historian Wolfram Wette in his 2006 work The Wehrmacht: History, Myth, Reality. Named reference According to the historian Felix R√∂mer, the named reference in the Wehrmachtbericht (), was an award, among other military decorations. As an award, the named reference in the Wehrmachtbericht was based on the Walther von Brauchitsch decree of 27 April 1940 which was published in the (Army Ordinance Gazette) on 6 May 1940.

It began as a mission in the 1950s along Alexandra Road. Since, it has grown from a small congregation consisting of lesser than 80 members to its present worship attendance of approximately 4,000. Strongly supportive of missionary work, the church is involved in numerous ministries that not only cater to different age groups, but also to foreigners in Singapore, such as the Filipinos.Website of Church of our Saviour It also conducts a Chinese ministry, and is a parish within the Anglican Diocese of Singapore. The church is also an active practitioner of spiritual healing, as evident from the numerous testimonies displayed in its website. It is currently led by Senior Pastor Daniel Wee. Vision Church of Our Saviour defines its vision as, \\"Making people powerful in God. Restoring destinies. Transforming communities.\\" Vision and Beliefs of Church of Our Saviour Missions to foreign lands are hosted and conducted, with an emphasis on cultural sensitivity for relevancy. The beliefs of the church are defined as: * God * Jesus Christ * Holy Spirit * The Bible * Salvation * The Church Choices Choices is a ministry established by Church of Our Saviour in 1991, with the purpose of assisting people \\"who struggle with homosexuality recover their God-intended sexual identity. In overcoming same-sex attractions, clients are empowered to take responsibility in maintaining moral and relational wholeness.\\" Essentially a sexual orientation conversion therapy of a religious nature, Choices uses the instrument of a safe for self-disclosure, self-discovery, change and growth, to achieve its purpose. It also emphasises on having a nurturing environment and network to support the conversion, so as to \\"discover life beyond the control of homosexuality.\\" Choices Ministry To project a scientific basis for its beliefs on homosexuality, Church of Our Saviour, in November 2007, includes in its website a self-prepared document, which is a summation of various documents that speak against homosexuality as being a genetic trait. The document mentions clearly its position is established firmly based on the Christian belief that God abhors homosexuality. It also states that Choices has effectively converted homosexuals, though it offers no numbers or statistics on its website. The website showcases several testimonies from individuals who previously subscribed to the homosexual lifestyle and claim to have found healing with the help of Choices ministry. Controversies Treatment at Choices ministry While both Church of Our Saviour and Choices ministry offer no reliable statistics or qualitative case studies, incidences of treatment failure have surfaced across the Internet. The Singaporean-managed homosexual support website, www.yawningbread.org, features a testimony of an ex-member of Church of Our Saviour, who suffered a nervous breakdown due to the treatment.A proven ministry Opposition to repealing of homosexual conduct penal code 377a In 2007, a review of the Singaporean Penal Code suggested that code 377a, which criminalises homosexual conduct between males, be removed. Church of Our Saviour responded strongly to this, foremost by adding to its website a \\"position statement\\" stating its firm stand against homosexuality, and that homosexuality is a sin against god. In addition, Senior Pastor Derek Hong gave various sermons on the issue. In a sermon in August 2007, titled \\"God's Church and Homosexuality,\\" Hong insisted on the existence of an agenda by gay activists. This agenda allegedly seeks to ultimately silence all Ex-Gay groups, eradicate anti-homosexuality groups such as churches, strive for legalising of same-sex marriages, and strive to promote homosexuality as a viable lifestyle. Hong, however, did not offer any concrete evidence or proof of his accusations.God's Church and Homosexuality An email has also surfaced, allegedly claiming that Hong has circulated an email in April 2007, encouraging acquaintances to mobilise, influence public opinion, and lobby the government.Email from Derek Hong, April 2007 (Alleged) The email recommends a suggested format of writing a protest and also the destination to submit the protest to, namely the Singaporean government feedback website at reach.gov.sg. While there is no evidence that Hong was indeed the author of the email, and Hong himself has issued no statement regarding it, an examination of the forum topics at reach.gov.sg reveals a large number of postings adopting exactly the recommended format.  Takeover of AWARE  Association of Women for Action and Research is an independent advocacy organization in Singapore, noted for its work towards gender equality in the country for 25 years. Its past campaigns led to revisions to the Penal Code, e.g. giving Singaporean women the same citizenship rights as men in 2004. In March 2009, a majority of the management committee were replaced by members of the Church of Our Saviour, after an AGM which was well-attended by members who had only recently joined AWARE. The takeover was organised by Dr Thio Su Mien, former dean of Law at the National University of Singapore, who said she was concerned over AWARE's attempts to redefine marriage and family.

Deputy Prime minister Wong Kan Seng voiced his disapproval of incident that \\"a group of conservative Christians, all attending the same church, which held strong views on homosexuality, had moved in and taken over AWARE because they disapproved of what AWARE had been doing\\", and called for tolerance, cautioning that religion and politics must be kept separate.Comments by DPM and Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng in response to media queries related to AWARE Notes Churches in Singapore Anglican church buildings in Singapore ","title":"Church of Our Saviour, Singapore"},{"id":"14419793","text":"Nethermere (St Neots) Ltd v Gardiner And Another [1984] ICR 612 is a UK labour law case in the Court of Appeal in the field of home work and vulnerable workers. Many labour and employment rights, such as unfair dismissal,s 94 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 in Britain depend on one's status as an \\"employee\\" rather than being \\"self-employed\\", or some other \\"worker\\". This case stands for the proposition that where \\"mutuality of obligation\\" between employers and casual or temporary workers exists to offer work and accept it, the court will find that the applicant has a \\"contract of employment\\" and is therefore an employee.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 3, 116 This case is also notable in that it was one of former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair's last cases as a young barrister. He acted for the employers. He appeared in the Employment Appeal Tribunal on behalf of the employer but his arguments to deny the ladies unfair dismissal rights were emphatically rejected in the judgment. The employers also lost in the Court of Appeal. Facts The applicants (Mrs Taverna and Mrs Gardiner) sewed trouser flaps part-time in the factory of Nethermere Ltd. At different times they became pregnant and had an arrangement to work from home. Each worked 5 to 7 hours a day, and for all but 8 or 12 weeks a year. They used sewing machines provided by Nethermere Ltd. Their hours varied according to the employer's needs, they were paid according to the quantity of trouser flaps they made and they were not formally obliged to accept work. There was a dispute about an entitlement to holiday pay, and when the employer refused to give them the entitlement, they claimed they had been unfairly and constructively dismissed. So the preliminary question on appeal was whether the ladies were \\"employees\\" under a \\"contract of employment\\" and therefore entitled to unfair dismissal rights under s 153 of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 (now s 94 Employment Rights Act 1996). The Industrial tribunal held that there was a contract of employment, applying the test of whether the ladies could be said to be in business \\"on their own account\\". The Employment Appeal Tribunal dismissed the employer's appeal on this point, finding in favour of the ladies. The employer appealed again. Judgment Employment Appeals Tribunal The judge, Tudor Evans J held that the claimants were entitled to holiday pay. He rejected \\"mutuality of obligation\\" as a criterion. However, in the Court of Appeal, \\"mutuality of obligation\\" was accepted as a precondition to a contract, but interpreted in a different way. For the later history, Carmichael v National Power plc [1999] AC 1226, Tony Blair's old pupil master, now the Lord Chancellor Derry Irvine reconfigured \\"mutuality of obligation\\" to mean an expressed continuing duty to provide work. Court of Appeal In the Court of Appeal Stephenson LJ in the majority found, first, that whether a contract created a contract of service (and therefore a contract of employment) rather than a contract for services was one of fact, not of law. This has been followed in Carmichael in 1999 by the House of Lords. Stephenson LJ discussed what \\"mutuality of obligation\\" meant.[1984] ICR 612, 622‚Äì623 It followed that the ladies were under a contract of employment (however compare the definition of \\"mutuality\\" given in Carmichael v National Power plc, by Lord Irvine of Lairg). Significance The Employment Appeals Tribunal ([1983] ICR 319) before appeal to the Court of Appeal is of interest, because a future UK Prime Minister was representing the employer. A key plank of the New Labour election pledge in 1997 was to sustain labour market flexibility, which fits in with the approach of his submissions here. In essence, he was arguing that because the interpretation of a contract is one of law, and because it can only be a contract \\"of employment\\" if there is a continuing mutual obligation on each party to offer wages or work, the home workers were not employees and therefore were not under the protection of unfair dismissal rights.

The project was developed by some of the Folding@home team at Stanford University, from about 2007 through 2011. Function Scientists such as those running Folding@home deal with massive amounts of data, which must be stored and backed up, and this is very expensive. Traditionally, methods such as storing the data on RAID servers are used, but these become impractical for research budgets at this scale. Pande's research group already dealt with storing hundreds of terabytes of scientific data. Professor Vijay Pande and student Adam Beberg took experience from Folding@home and began work on Storage@home. The project is designed based on the distributed file system known as Cosm, and the workload and analysis needed for Folding@home results. While Folding@home volunteers can easily participate in Storage@home, much more disk space is needed from the user than Folding@home, to create a robust network. Volunteers each donate 10 GB of storage space, which would hold encrypted files. These users gain points as a reward for reliable storage. Each file saved on the system is replicated four times, each spread across 10 geographically distant hosts. Redundancy also occurs over different operating systems and across time zones. If the servers detect the disappearance of an individual contributor, the data blocks held by that user would then be automatically duplicated to other hosts. Ideally, users would participate for a minimum of six months, and would alert the Storage@home servers before certain changes on their end such as a planned move of a machine or a bandwidth downgrade. Data stored on Storage@home was maintained through redundancy and monitoring, with repairs done as needed. Through careful application of redundancy, encryption, digital signatures, automated monitoring and correction, large quantities of data could be reliably and easily retrieved. This ensures a robust network that will lose the least possible data. Storage Resource Broker is the closest storage project to Storage@home. Status Storage@home was first made available on September 15, 2009 in a testing phase. It first monitored availability data and other basic statistics on the user's machine, which would be used to create a robust and capable storage system for storing massive amounts of scientific data.

Gresha was educated in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia at the Continental School, and in Sri Lanka. She took to music while she was in Saudi Arabia and even won a 'battle of the bands' contest in her school. When she returned to Sri Lanka she decided to follow her in popular music after she completed her GCE Advanced Levels. Cold Cold Night Christmas Single Gresha has recorded her debut Christmas single 'Cold Cold Night.' The Christmas song was written by father and son duo, the distinguished Sri Lanka-born singer/songwriter Nimal Mendis and his son Paul Marie Mendis. 'Cold Cold Night' was released by Media Eye Music in the United Kingdom in November 2007. The BBC said Gresha Schuilling was attempting to reach the No.1 spot in the Christmas Charts of 2007. Gresha Schuilling is recording her debut album in Colombo and it was scheduled to be released in the summer of 2008. Media Eye Music in London released her 'Cold Cold Night' Christmas single on download through the mediaeyeproductions website.

Sri Lanka's Ambassador for Autism Gresha Schuilling was appointed Sri Lanka's Ambassador for Autism by the Autism Awareness Campaign UK and Sri Lanka. She is determined to make a difference to the lives of all people with autism and Asperger syndrome in her island home. Gresha has been raising awareness of the condition - an estimated 39,000 children in Sri Lanka are on the autism spectrum. Gresha said: ‚ÄúAutistic is the adjective of a development disorder of the brain, NOT a definition of who a person is! Educate yourselves and others on this disorder more common that Down Syndrome or cystic fibrosis. It is four times more common in boys than in girls and is said to be as common as one in every 250 children born in recent years. It is our duty as people who have been given the talent and opportunity to do everything we can to increase awareness of Autism.

The term was first used in the Vagrancy Act 1824. The term continued to be used in the Street Offences Act 1959 which maintained the illegality of street prostitution. Section 1 stated: \\"It shall be an offence for a common prostitute to loiter or solicit in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution.\\" Street Offences Act 1959 The case of Director of Public Prosecutions v Bull [1994] 158 J.P. 1005 determined that the term could only be applied to female, and not male, prostitutes. The term was widely regarded as archaic, stigmatising, and offensive, and a number of failed attempts had been made since the 1920s to enact new legislation which would replace the wording with a solicitation law that applied to both sexes equally, and did not create an offence that could only be committed by a special class of person. In 2007 the government announced that it would introduce new legislation which would eliminate the use of the term, and replace it with new language which would apply equally to males and females. Section 16 of the Policing and Crime Act 2009 amended s.1(1) of the Street Offences Act 1959 to replace the term \\"common prostitute\\" with \\"person\\". The Policing and Crime Act 2009 also introduced tough new measures aimed at men seeking women for the purpose of prostitution. In particular the act makes it an offence for someone to pay or promise to pay a prostitute who has been subject to ‚Äòexploitive conduct‚Äô.Prostitution loitering paying or soliciting a prostitute subjected to force The change made the customer an equal offender with the street prostitute.

It was founded as Parr & Co. in Warrington, then in the county of Lancashire in the United Kingdom. In 1918 it was acquired by London County and Westminster Bank, and it was thus one of the predecessors of NatWest Group. Former Warrington main branch of Parr's Bank  History Writing in 1905, William Howarth described Parr's as \\"one of the great amalgamating banks in the country\\" and \\"a power in the financial world\\".W Howarth: The Banks in the Clearing House (1905) pp177-87 The bank's history dates back to the late eighteenth century, with a possible starting date of 1782. The first partnership was with Joseph Parr, a sugar boiler, his brother-in-law Matthew Lyon, and Walter Kerfoot, a solicitor. Partnership names changed and the firm was variously known as Parr & Co, and Parr, Lyon; more colloquially it was known as The Warrington Bank.T E Gregory, The Westminster Bank, through a century, Vol. II, (1936) Parr's remained essentially a local bank with offices in Warrington, Runcorn and St Helens until 1865 when the it became a joint stock bank under the name Parr's Banking Company. Helped by a series of acquisitions, including the National Bank of Liverpool, Parr's built up its presence in Cheshire, Lancashire and Staffordshire; by 1890 there were 22 branches and 21 sub-branches. The Bank's most important strategic move came in 1891 when it purchased the small London bank of Fuller, Banbury, Nix & Co. This gave Parr's a seat on the London Clearing House and, in contrast to the nearby Bank of Liverpool it immediately moved the head office down to London. With Fuller giving the Bank an initial London presence, the substance was provided by the acquisition of the Alliance Bank in 1892. The Alliance had emerged from the financial reconstruction which had seen it lose its Liverpool and Manchester offices and now had 12 branches in London; in recognition of Alliance's importance the name of the Bank was changed to Parr's Banking Company and the Alliance Bank. Other smaller London banks were acquired and in 1896 it bought the Consolidated Bank, only slightly smaller than the Alliance, but this time a London bank with branches in Manchester. At that point, the name was returned to Parr's Bank. The 1890s also saw Parr's embark on acquisitions in the midlands and the south west, important ones being Pare's Leicestershire Banking in 1902 and Crompton and Evans‚Äô Union Bank of Derby in 1914. However, its most prestigious acquisition was Stuckey's Bank (1909) (the \\"Somersetshire Bank\\") which \\"wielded great power in the west of England and had the largest note circulation of any bank in England outside the Bank of England\\". Stuckey's Bank Samuel Stuckey was a general merchant based in Langport, Somerset; by the 1770s, customers depositing funds with Stuckey had given rise to the embryo banking business. By 1782 Stuckey had London agents and by 1806 banking had grown sufficiently for Stuckey to constitute it separately as the Langport Bank. Branches were immediately opened in Bridgwater and Bristol, separately constituted to avoid the restriction on banks having no more than six partners. Following the 1826 Act, the bank was one of the first to become a joint stock bank, and the branches were formally incorporated into Stuckey's Banking Company. Over the next ten years, Stuckey's acquired seven local banks and opened an office in London. One notable member of the Bank was Walter Bagehot, later editor of The Economist who was appointed the secretary to the management committee in 1855. As well as opening new branches, Stuckey's continued to make acquisitions, the last being Dunsford of Tiverton in 1883. By the time of its acquisition in 1909 Stuckey's deposits were ¬£7 million. compared with Parr's ¬£31 million, making the enlarged bank the sixth largest joint stock bank in England.P T Saunders: Stuckey‚Äôs Bank (1928) Bought by ‚ÄúWestminster‚Äù By the outbreak of war in 1914 Parr's had almost 400 branches and sub-branches. In 1918 Parr's agreed to amalgamate with the London County and Westminster Bank. The Chairman of Parr's made the case: ‚ÄúWe gain access to a very large area in the Home Counties. They gain a first-class introduction to Lancashire and to such leading towns in the Midlands as Leicester and Derby and a very valuable connection in the West of England.‚Äù The enlarged bank was renamed London County Westminster and Parr's Bank, until the name was shortened to Westminster Bank Limited in 1923.

Retrieved February 29, 2016 History The city of Nocera was destroyed in 546 by Totila, and again destroyed by the Lombards in the middle of the 8th century.Cappelletti, p. 14. Authentic Bishops were Felix (412) and Liutardus (824); others were: *Giovanni Marcolini (1446), who restored the cathedral; *Francesco Luigi Piervissani (1800), exiled in 1809 because he refused the oath of allegiance to Napoleon. In 1669, the cathedral was dedicated to S. Rinaldo, and had a Chapter composed of two dignities (the Provost and the Archdeacon, neither of whom had a prebend) and ten Canons. The entire diocese contained some 20,000 inhabitants, and the city of Nocera about 1,000.Ritzler-Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica V, p. 293, note 1. Ughelli, Italia sacra I, p. 1064. In 1768, the cathedral, dedicated to the Assumption of the Body of the Virgin Mary into Heaven, was administered by a Chapter, composed of two dignities (the Provost and the Archdeacon) and ten Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica VI, p. 315, note 1.

Kehr, p. 51 no. 1. Gams, p. 709. Lanzoni, p. 245. :... :[Caelius Laurentius] (attested 499‚Äì501)Kehr, p. 51, points out that Laurentius became bishop of Nuceria in Campania, not Nocera in Umbria. He engaged in an electoral contest with Pope Symmachus and lost; he became a schismatic. :[Aprilis] (attested 502)An Aprilis was present at the Roman synod of Pope Symmachus in 502. The question is to which bishopric he belonged. The manuscripts (following Sbaraglia, Coleti, and Mansi) read: Aprilis Lateranensis. Cappelletti, Le chiese d'Italia V, pp. 13-14, rejects the idea that this can be transmuted into Nocerinus or anything similar; he would rather consider a corruption of Alatrinensis. Gams, p. 709, also rejects Aprilis. Cf. Lanzoni, p. 245. :... :[Numerius] (attested 593)Numerius: Pope Gregory I wrote a letter to the Rector of Campania, asking that Numerius be sent to Rome for consecration. Is this a bishop-elect of Nuceria in Campania? Lanzoni, p. 245. :[Primenius] (attested 598)Primenius: Bishop Primenius is ordered in a letter of Pope Gregory I to install relics of the martyrs in a new basilica. The letter is also addressed to the bishops of Terracina, Sorrento, Porto, Ostia, Naples and Formiae. This is surely Bishop Primenius of Nuceria in Campania.

From 1922 until his death year Harvey appeared in more than 115 films. He was credited for about two-thirds of his film appearances, but some of his roles were uncredited. The burly actor with a mustache mostly played comic supporting roles, often as an innkeeper. His best-known role was Beamish in the first two Tarzan films starring Johnny Weissmuller. Together with Claude Rains, he played in The Invisible Man, as a tavern owner and husband of a hysterical Una O'Connor, and in The Wolf Man. He appeared in two films for Alfred Hitchcock, first in his British silent film The Ring (1927), later in Hitchcock's Hollywood debut Rebecca (1940). A number of reference works incorrectly identify him as having played Little Maria's father in Frankenstein. Harvey's interment was in California.

12, 1990) was an All- American guard for the University of Michigan Wolverines football team from 1936 to 1938. He was a consensus All-American in 1938, the first player from the Gogebic Range area of Michigan's Upper Peninsula to win the honor. His exploits were widely reported in the Upper Peninsula press, where he became a local hero. He played professional football in the National Football League (NFL) with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1939. From 1940 to 1944, he was the line coach for the Virginia Cavaliers football team while attending the University of Virginia School of Law at the same time. After practicing law in New York for a time, he spent a year as a line coach and law professor at Marquette University in 1947. After leaving Marquette, Heikkinen worked as executive secretary and attorney for Studebaker-Packard Corporation. He later joined the legal staff at General Motors (GM), retiring in 1978 after 20 years of service in GM's legal department. Heikkinen also helped initiate and implement a corporation-wide alcohol treatment and education program at General Motors. Youth in the Upper Peninsula Born in Hancock, Michigan in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Heikkinen was the son of Finnish immigrants, and grew up in Ramsay, Michigan, a heavily Finnish American community in the Gogebic Range area. Heikkinen's father, Jacob Heikkinen, was a \\"noted organist\\" who played at St. Paul's Finnish Lutheran Church. He attended A.D. Johnston High School, in Bessemer, Michigan from 1933 to 1935. As a junior in 1933, Heikkinen was elected president of the student council. Heikkinen was a superior student who graduated with high honors student, and finished third in his high school class academically. When a new library opened in Bessemer in 1934, Heikkinen was the first person to check out a book, A.B. Demille's \\"Three English Comedies.\\" He was also an officer in the school's ROTC program, and received honors for his participation in the high school's military, athletics and student affairs programs. Despite weighing only , Heikkinen won a spot on his high school football team; his high school coach Robert Reihsen said he won a spot due to his aggressive play. Local papers reported that Heikkinen's line play during high school was marked by hard tackling and blocking. During his junior season in 1934, Coach Reihsen recalled Heikkinen played every minute of every game. Coach Reihnsen's team was known as the \\"Speed Boys,\\" and gave up only two points in the first four games, outscoring opponents, 65‚Äì2. In November 1934, Coach Reihsen took Heikkinen to Minneapolis to attend his first Big Ten football game, the Little Brown Jug match between Michigan and Minnesota. Reihsen recalled that, after the game, Heikkinen said: \\"Some day I'm going to play in this stadium.\\" University of Michigan Heikkinen won an academic scholarship In July 1935, Heikkinen won an academic scholarship to the University of Michigan. The Bessemer Herald noted: \\"It was no surprise to learn that Ralph Heikkinen of Ramsay has been awarded a University of Michigan Alumni scholarship, although only 50 high school seniors in the state can win the honor each year . . . Ralph is a very good student; he ranked third in scholastic standings in a class of 128 . . . Heikkinen was also an outstanding guard on the B.H.S. football team for two years and he intends to try out for the Wolverine freshman squad this fall.\\" The scholarship was renewed from year to year and covered Heikkinen's tuition. To supplement his income, Heikkinen worked eight-hour days in a Fort Dearborn plant during his freshman year. The president of the Gogebic Range U-M Alumni Club later recalled that Heikkinen won his scholarship by passing a competitive examination. Of those receiving scholarships, Heikkinen was credited with the finest all around record of any undergraduate among the alumni scholarship students. Heikkinen's diminutive stature When Heikkinen graduated from high school, he weighed only and was thought too light to play Big Ten football. His height was reported variously as , , and . Heikkinen was described by the Detroit News as a \\"pigmy\\" compared to Michigan's last great guard, Albert Benbrook, who was and more than . He was also described as \\"the stock atom,\\" and the \\"pint-sized\\" lineman. But Heikkinen viewed his size as an asset: \\"My size had been a help rather than a hindrance. It is easier for a small man to pull out of the line and run interference than a big one. I had no trouble out-charging big men; it was the small men who gave me all the trouble.\\" Freshman and sophomore years Heikkinen did not excel on the freshman team, but was invited by Coach Harry Kipke to spring practice in 1936 to try out for the varsity team. In April 1936, the people back in Bessemer gave Heikkinen a vote of confidence; the school board approved a $55 payment to Heikkinen as \\"advance payment\\" for some form of employment to be given \\"during the coming summer months.\\" However, Heikkinen did not win a starting spot on the 1936 team and was not even ranked among the top sophomore guards on the team. At the end of the 1936 season, the highest praise Coach Kipke could muster was to call him \\"one of the better defensive linemen on the squad.\\" Assistant coach Bennie Oosterbaan said Heikkinen had \\"the right attitude,\\" and coach Wally Weber described him as \\"a hard worker.\\" However, the Michigan Daily noted: \\"The only weakness of the Ramsay boy is his lack of speed. Speedy guards are needed to pull out of the line and lead the interference, and Heikkinen hasn't quite shown that he is fast enough to move in Big Ten competition as yet.\\" Role of Hunk Anderson The first person on the Michigan staff to believe in Heikkinen was Heartley Anderson. A fellow native of the Upper Peninsula (Tamarack City, Michigan), Anderson played guard at Notre Dame from 1919 to 1921 and was Knute Rockne's successor as Notre Dame's head coach in 1931. In 1937, Anderson became Michigan's line coach, and came to the conclusion during spring practice that Heikkinen was Michigan's best football player. After a strong showing in spring practice, Heikkinen \\"hardened up\\" over the summer working at the Wakefield Iron. 1937 season In 1937, Heikkinen won the starting job at right guard, but the team finished 4‚Äì4, and were outscored by opponents 110‚Äì54. They were soundly defeated by Minnesota, 39‚Äì6, and Ohio State, 21‚Äì0. Heikkinen was the one bright spot in the Wolverines' 1937 season. In early November 1937, Anderson described Heikkinen as \\"the smallest but best lineman in the Michigan forward wall.\\" Anderson continued in his praise for Heikkinen: \\"Heik has shown the stuff in both of our tough games against Minnesota and Northwestern . . . Minnesota didn't split our guards more than twice during the game. Heik was responsible for a lot of that. My conception of a good guard is one that stops anything that comes his way on defense and leads the blocking on offense. Heik has done just that. When we have the ball he is our fifth man in the backfield. He pulls out most of our plays and bowls over the opposition. We have made most of the gains through the line over his position.\\" Heikkinen's interception of a forward pass proved to be the key break in a 7‚Äì0 win over Penn. He also blocked kicks for points after touchdown in one-point wins over Illinois (7‚Äì6) and Chicago (13‚Äì12). Without Heikkinen's big plays against Penn, Illinois and Chicago, the Wolverines likely would have been 1‚Äì5‚Äì2 instead of 4‚Äì4. Even in a 21‚Äì0 loss to Ohio State, Heikkinen blocked two kicks. Described at the end of the season as Kipke's \\"pride and joy,\\" Heikkinen averaged 50 minutes a game in 1937, and was the only Michigan player selected to the All-Big Ten team (UP first team; AP second team). He was also voted by his teammates as the team's Most Valuable Player, an honor never before bestowed on a junior. And Anderson noted, \\"if Michigan's record had been better, Heikkinen would have made the All-America. There isn't a better guard in the country; I don't know another as good. Wait til next year.\\" A Detroit newspaper wrote that Heikkinen was the surprise of the 1937 season. \\"Heikkinen has no spectacular record as a high school player to show. He was a reserve guard last season and really just started to show up in spring practice this year.\\" The Bessemer Herald reported on the impressive turnaround of the first player from the Gogebic Range to be named All-Big Ten: \\"Heikkinen, one of the quietest and least boisterous men on the Michigan grid squad, has suddenly shot from obscurity into the Western Conference hall of fame . . . From a lowly bench warmer last year, 'Hike' became one of the most consistent first-stringers this season. He played many if not more minutes than any other member of the squad.\\" After the team's 4‚Äì4 finish, Michigan dismissed Harry Kipke as head coach. Anderson, described by Heikkinen as the \\"greatest line technician in football today,\\" also resigned as line coach. Asked about rumors that players did not like Kipke, Heikkinen said those reports were probably originated by disgruntled players who did not make the squad or were in other ways dissatisfied. However, just over a year later, in February 1939, Heikkinen led the opposition when Kipke ran for the University's Board of Regents and campaigned actively for Kipke's opponent. Political campaigning in 1938 Heikkinen majored in political science and did political organization work for the Young Republicans during the summer of 1938 in Gogebic and Ontonagom Counties. He was the Upper Peninsula field representative for gubernatorial candidate Harry S. Toy in 1938, traveling more than 16,000 miles over the course of the summer. 1938 season In 1938, with Heikkinen returning at guard, a new coach in Fritz Crisler, and sophomores Forest Evashevski and Tom Harmon joining the varsity squad, the Wolverines began to turn things around. They finished with a 6‚Äì1‚Äì1 record and were ranked #16 in the final AP poll. Harmon and Evashevski made immediate contributions, but Heikkinen was once again voted the team's Most Valuable Player. Having been the first junior to win the award in 1937, he became the first player to receive the award twice in 1938. Though line coach Anderson did not return in 1937, Michigan hired Clarence \\"Biggie\\" Munn to replace him. Munn was a unanimous All-American guard for Minnesota in 1931. Under the new coaching staff of Crisler and Munn, Heikkinen became one of the best college football players in the country. After the 1938 season, Heikkinen credited Crisler and Munn for his development. Heikkinen noted that Michigan linemen were taught not to depend on sheer strength. \\"We have not been taught to rear up and hurl back the opposition. We have not been taught to roll it back by power. We have been schooled to out-block and out-trick the other side. Our method is to be alert. We try to catch the other fellows off balance.\\" Michigan won the first game of the season against Michigan State, 14‚Äì0, and Heikkinen drew attention for playing 59 of 60 minutes in the game. The team's only loss was a close 7‚Äì6 defeat to Minnesota in the third game of the season. The fourth game of the season was a 45‚Äì7 win over Yale. An Ann Arbor newspaper reported that Gerald R. Ford, former Michigan center then serving as a scout for Yale, \\"tried to feed Hike a line . . . on how impossibly inferior\\" Yale's team would be. According to the report, Heikkinen, \\"in his typically pungent manner, nipped Ford's eulogies in the bud with some poignant remarks on who was trying to kid who and how.\\" The 1938 Northwestern game ended in a scoreless tie. Heikkinen led a goal-line stand that preserved the tie. Northwestern reached the 11-yard line on a 51-yard pass play. A penalty took the ball to the six-yard line. On first down, they drove to the five, then to the two, and then to the one-yard line for a first down. On first down with a yard to go, Heikkinen stopped Northwestern a foot short of the goal line. Heikkinen called time out and encouraged the players when the ball was on the one-foot line, and the Michigan team kept the Wildcats from the end zone in an impressive goal-line stand. In the Ohio State game, his former coach Anderson said: \\"He was the fifth man in the Ohio backfield. He pulled out of the line to lead the Michigan interference, blocked, went down under punts, smeared Ohio running plays and what not!\\" Detroit News sports editor H.G. Salsinger wrote: \\"He was Michigan's outstanding player for the last two years. He was probably the best offensive guard Michigan ever had, and fitted perfectly into the new Michigan running attack. Fast and powerful, Heikkinen frequently blocked out two defense players. Heikkinen was the fastest charger in the Michigan line. He outmaneuvered opponents. On defense it was impossible to gain through his position, and he had a way of jamming opposing lines and making holes so that his secondary could break through and stop the ball carrier.\\" Ann Arbor newspaper writer, Bud Benjamin, wrote about Heikkinen: \\"If ever a player deserved national recognition it is the brilliant Ralph Heikkinen, 180 pounds of inspired dynamite in a great Michigan line. . . . He came out of a small town in northern Michigan, Hike, did, a sandy haired, extremely reserved Finnish boy with an irrepressible urge to play football.\\" He played between 50 and 60 minutes of every game in 1937 and 1938 and not once was a timeout called on his account or a substitution made for him due to injury. \\"He was on his feet ‚Äì active , explosive, dynamic --all the time.\\" Selection as an All-American Heikkinen was chosen as a consensus first- team All-American by more than 25 sports magazines, newspapers and wire services, including the Associated Press, the United Press, Grantland Rice for Collier's Weekly, the Newspaper Enterprise Association Service, the New York Sun, and Chesterfield Cigarettes as selected by Eddie Dooley. Heikkinen received 226 points in the United Press poll, the fifth highest total in the balloting. The UP noted: \\"He dominated the voting for guards on ballots from the East, West, South and North. He has a trick on defense of jamming the opposition line and making a hole for a teammate to go through and get the ball carrier. On offense, he excels in swinging out to lead the interference and often gets in two blocks on a play. Motion pictures of the Ohio State- Michigan game show Heikkinen jamming opposing linesmen back from one to three yards on almost every play. He is so good that professional teams have approached him, but he wants to study law.\\" In announcing its selection, the Associated Press noted: \\"An all-Big Ten guard for two years, Heikkinen tears down under punts, pulls out of the line to lead interference and tackles hard. He is Michigan's first All-American in five years. A 60-minute performer, seldom fooled by intricate maneuvers, Heikkinen is regarded by Coach Fritz Crisler as the finest guard he has ever seen.\\" The NEA said: \\"Ralph Heikkinen, Michigan senior and Ramsay, was small as guards go. He stood only five feet eight and weighed 182 pounds but he was the fastest guard in the Big Ten . . . one of the best Fritz Crisler ever saw. He had a great offensive charge. A corking blocker, especially when pulling out of the line, he was chosen as the Wolverines' most valuable player in 1937.\\" Another reporter described Heikkinen as \\"Michigan's 182-pound dynamo,\\" who was \\"fast as a halfback, and possessing the quickest charge his coach, Fritz Crisler, has seen.\\" In addition to the All-American honors, Heikkinen finished second in voting for the Chicago Tribune Silver Football trophy as the Big Ten Conference's Most Valuable Player. He was also chosen to play in the East-West Shrine Game in San Francisco on January 1, 1939. And in July 1939, Heikkinen was elected with 846,943 votes (fourth highest vote count of any player) to play in the annual game between the College All-Stars and the NFL New York Giants. The Ironwood Daily Globe boasted that residents of Michigan's sparsely populated Gogebic Range had accounted for 25,000 of Heikkinen's votes. Heikkinen the poet Many of the articles reporting on Heikkinen's All-American selection focused on his academic performance and on his love of poetry. While at Michigan, Heikkinen was also the president of the undergraduate \\"M\\" club in 1938 and president of U-M's senior honor society, \\"Michigamua.\\" Detroit News sports editor H.G. Salsinger wrote that Heikkinen \\"writes poetry, and one of his poems appeared in a literary publication in 1938.\\" The Associated press noted that Heikkinen was \\"a high-ranking student whose hobby is poetry\\" An Ann Arbor paper wrote: \\"He's extremely intelligent, dabbling in such fields as creative writing, drama, and poetry with considerable vim and no little skill during his spare moments. He is completely unassuming, unusually quiet, and above all a real gentleman.\\" In August 1939, Heikkinen was hired by a magazine to write a story on college football. Newspapers reported that Heikkinen was \\"collecting dividends on the reputation he made as a poet and writer as an undergraduate.\\" In 1937, Heikkinen was the subject of an article titled, \\"But He's No Sissy.\\" The articles noted that Heikkinen \\"adheres strictly to a liquid diet\\" and drank a full quart of milk after every game as part of a special diet due to a stomach disorder. Hero of the Upper Peninsula Heikkinen was the first player from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to win All-Big Ten honors in 1938, and he topped that in 1939 as the region's first All-American. His exploits were followed closely both during the summer and during the football season in the Gogebic Range's newspapers, The Ironwood Daily Globe and The Bessemer Herald. When he was named an All-American by the AP, it was front page news, and the sports sections ran banner headlines. The Ironwood Daily Globe reported: \\"Football honors are coming so fast for Ralph I. Heikkinen . . . that it's hard for range fans who have watched Ralph's progress on the gridiron to keep up with the latest developments. The latest and greatest tribute came today with the releasing of the Associated Press all-America team on which he was named for a guard position. Heikkinen has twice been named on the all-conference eleven and twice selected as Michigan's most valuable player, the latter award never before having gone to a Michigan man two years in a row. There remains only one greater honor possible ‚Äì that of being named to Grantland Rice's official all-America team.\\" When he was named to the Grantland Rice team the following week, the Globe reported: \\"Heikkinen's exceptional analytical ability on defense and his near-perfect blocking on offense this last season has gained him a position on every major all-star team chosen this year.\\" On December 8, 1938, the Globe announced that a banquet honoring Heikkinen would be held with \\"Hike\\" himself traveling north to attend. In the week leading up to the banquet, the Globe published an interview with \\"Hike\\"'s high school football coach, Robert Reihsen. On the day of the banquet, the Bessemer Herald ran an editorial urging the city of Ramsay to name a street or park in Heikkinen's honor: \\"Ramsay has never received the national publicity that its native son, Ralph Heikkinen, has brought to it this fall. By newspapers, magazines and radio the Gogebic range's first All- American football star has brought renown to himself, his home town and his school. If Ramsay has any street, public building, park or athletic field, that are now without title, or the names of which can be changed, why not dedicate something to Ralph Heikkinen who has so nobly proved himself to be Bessemer township's leading citizen for 1938? Other communities have done as much for their heroes. As far as the University of Michigan is concerned Heikkinen has already written his name forever on the athletic scroll of honor. He takes his place with a long line of All-American Wolverines. They are never forgotten at the Ann Arbor institution.\\" At the testimonial dinner, Heikkinen's six-year-old brother, Donald Heikkinen, was asked to name the greatest football player in the world and responded, \\"Ralph.\\" Donald offered that Ralph was best because he used \\"proper technique,\\" and found it difficult to choose his older brother's greatest play because \\"there were so many of them.\\" Referring to the Ohio State game, Donald noted, \\"Ralph crushed through and smeared 'em.\\" Heikkinen, or \\"Hike\\" as he was known to Yoopers, was presented with a purse of $36 representing the No. 36 he wore for Michigan. Heikkinen's high school coach was the \\"toastmaster,\\" and the local school superintendent, E.J. Oas, said that Heikkinen is \\"not only all-American, he's all man and all gentleman.\\" A nine-piece orchestra played, and led the community in singing. And the local American Legion post presented him with a medal. The Bessemer Herald reported that \\"friends and admirers of Ralph Heikkinen . . . came from all parts of the Upper Peninsula last night to pay tribute to the football star.\\" The following day, he spoke to students in the assembly room of Bessemer high school where the school band gave a concert and Heikkinen was \\"given a boisterous welcome by the students.\\" The Upper Peninsula press continued to report on Heikkinen's every move, as he returned home shortly before Christmas, before heading west to play in the East-West Shrine Game. On his departure for California, The Bessemer Herald said: \\"Ralph has made every major All America team in the nation this year. . . . Our nation has had many great men to emulate. The children of the Ramsay school not only have these in common with all others, but we have our own local hero who has gained national repute as a gentleman, scholar and last, but not least, a great athlete. To say that we are proud of Ralph is putting it mild. We feel that we are very honored to have had him as a student of the Ramsay school.\\" The celebration resumed again in January 1939 when Michigan coach Fritz Crisler accompanied Heikkinen back to the Upper Peninsula for another banquet. Filmed highlights of Michigan's 1938 season, featuring Heikkinen, were shown at the banquet. Even in April 1939, Heikkinen's appearances at banquets in the Upper Peninsula drew large crowds and wide press coverage. In 1954, Heikkinen was one of the twenty initial inductees into the Gogebic Range Sports Hall of Fame. Professional football Heikkinen signed on as an assistant coach at Michigan in the spring 1939 initially expressing ambivalence about playing professional football. Then, on September 9, 1939 he had accepted an offer to play with the Brooklyn Dodgers of the NFL. Heikkinen had previously refused offers to play pro football, but the persistence of coach Potsy Clark, and Crisler's assurance that a coaching job would be open for him in 1940, persuaded Heikkinen to try professional football. Heikkinen noted on signing, though, that he would definitely return to law school in 1940. It was reported that Heikkinen signed a contract for \\"at least $175 a game\\" with the Dodgers. Heikkinen was cut by the Dodgers after playing only three games. When Heikkinen was released, one writer noted that Heikkinen \\"was perhaps the biggest disappointment among the highly ballyhooed players who came up this season.\\" Brooklyn' coach Clark noted that an \\"All-American man doesn't mean a thing to us\\" in the NFL. Clark said: \\"Heikkinen weighed only 183 pounds and was pretty light for our league. He reported late and didn't give himself a fair chance to show me what he could do. I just didn't think he was in the right physical shape and mental shape. The Upper Peninsula press disputed accounts that Heikkinen had not cut it in the NFL. Heikkinen's friends said that Heikkinen asked for his own release in order to accept the opportunity to study law and coach football at the University of Virginia. One Upper Peninsula paper reported: \\"Had Heikkinen wanted to, he still could be a member of the Brooklyn squad. However, the Dodgers moguls co-operated with Ralph and released him from his contract when he informed them of the Virginia offer.\\" Later years In October 1939, Heikkinen was hired as the line coach at the University of Virginia, where he also studied law. An influential alumnus of Virginia interviewed Heikkinen when the Dodgers played the Detroit Lions and was instrumental in securing Heikkinen's position with Virginia. Heikkinen worked as Virginia's line coach from 1940 to 1944 and graduated first in his class from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1944. Fellow Michigan All-American, Edliff Slaughter, was also a Virginia coach with Heikkinen. During World War II, in 1943, Slaughter and Heikkinen turned from coaching to teaching aerial navigation at the University of Virginia Flight Preparatory School. On March 3, 1941, Heikkinen married Margaret Jackson, in Davenport, Iowa. In March 1947, Hekkinen was appointed line coach at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Heikkinen was line coach under head coach Frank Murray at Virginia and joined Murray again at Marquette. In between the stints at Virginia and Marquette, Heikkinen was a New York attorney. While serving as Marquette's line coach, Heikkinen also carried a full teaching schedule as an assistant law professor on the faculty of Marquette law school. Heikkinen only stayed one year at Marquette, returning to the practice of law in New York in 1948. After leaving Marquette, Heikkinen worked as executive secretary and attorney for the Studebaker-Packard Corporation. He later joined the legal staff at General Motors, retiring in 1978 after 20 years of service in GM's legal department. Heikkinen helped initiate and implement a corporation-wide alcohol treatment and education program at GM. In 1987, Heikkinen was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor. He died of heart failure in Pontiac, Michigan at age 72. He was survived by his wife, Margaret Helen Heikkinen, and six children, Ralph Heikkinen, Jr., James Heikkinen, Peggy Parisen, Elizabeth Heikkinen, Linda Heikkinen, and Pamela Ronci. His funeral was held at St. Paul Methodist Church in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.

A stepped-up basis is often much higher than the before-death cost basis, which is primarily the benefactor's purchase price for the asset. Because taxable capital-gain income is the selling price minus the basis, a high stepped-up basis can greatly reduce the beneficiary's taxable capital-gain income when the beneficiary sells the inherited asset.  General rule  Under IRC ¬ß 1014(a), which applies to an asset that a person (the beneficiary) receives from a giver (the benefactor) after the benefactor dies, the general rule is that the beneficiary's basis equals the fair market value of the asset at the time the benefactor dies. This can result in a stepped-up basis or a stepped-down basis. An example of a stepped-up basis: If Benefactor owned a home that Benefactor purchased for $35,000, then Benefactor's basis in the home would be equal to its purchase price, $35,000, assuming no adjustments under IRC ¬ß 1016, which allows for increases in basis such as home improvements, or decreases in basis such as unrepaired windstorm damage. Continuing the example, the fair market value of Benefactor's home was $100,000 on the day Benefactor died. After Beneficiary inherits the home from Benefactor, Beneficiary's basis in the home is that fair market value, $100,000. In contrast, if Benefactor gives the home to Beneficiary before Benefactor dies, then Beneficiary receives a carryover basis, which is equal to the Benefactor's purchase price for the home, $35,000, again assuming no adjustments under IRC ¬ß 1016.  Simplified Example  \\"Basis\\" is generally the amount you have invested in an asset. Thus, in the very simple case, if you buy a house for $35,000, your \\"basis\\" is $35,000. \\"Gain\\", in the very simple case, is the amount you receive when you dispose of an asset, minus your basis in the asset. Thus, if you sold the house above for $100,000, your gain (what you might be taxed on) would be $65,000 (sales price of $100,000 minus your basis of $35,000), if we ignore complicating factors for purposes of this general example. Normally, when someone receives an asset from you before you die, the person who receives the asset keeps the same basis in the asset that you, the donor, had. For example, if your sister Mary were to receive this house from you before you die, then her basis in the house would also be $35,000, no matter what the fair market value (FMV) of the house was on the date of the gift. Therefore, if your sister were to sell the house for $100,000, she would generally need to pay income tax on the $65,000 of capital-gain income. However, in the case of a beneficiary who receives an asset from a benefactor after the benefactor's death, the beneficiary's basis in the asset is \\"stepped up\\" to the FMV on the date of the death. For example: If, on the date of your death, you had a basis of $35,000 in the house and the house's FMV was $100,000, and your sister received the house from you after your death, then her basis would be $100,000, not $35,000. Therefore, if your sister were to sell the house for $100,000, she would not have to pay any income tax because the sales price ($100,000) minus her basis ($100,000) would be a capital-gain income of zero. See the explanation under \\"Rationale for stepped-up basis\\" (below) for an explanation of why the Tax Code would do this.  Stepped-down basis  Likewise, under ¬ß 1014(a), if a benefactor's adjusted basis in property is higher than the fair market value, the beneficiary's basis will equal the fair market value of the property at the time the benefactor dies. For example, Benefactor owns a yacht whose adjusted basis is $150,000, but at the time of Benefactor's death, the fair market value of the yacht is only $110,000. The beneficiary's basis in the yacht will be the fair market value, $110,000.  Incentive for Taxpayers  Because of this provision, any appreciation of the affected property that occurred during the decedent's lifetime will never be taxed. Thus, this provision provides an incentive for taxpayers to retain appreciated property until death, and sell property that has fallen in market value while alive (although property on which one may take depreciation may still cause a gain ‚Äî even when sold for less its original purchase price‚Äîbecause depreciation subtracts from basis).  ¬ß 2032 Election for Alternate Valuation  Section 2032 provides an alternate method of determining the property's new basis. If the property is not disposed of within six months of the decedent's death, the executor may elect to use the property's fair market value six months after the date of death BUT ONLY IF SUCH AN ELECTION RESULTS IN A DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE GROSS ESTATE.Tony Stinar, CPA, ABV, http://www.otcpas.com/elect-alternate- valuation-date-estate-tax If the executor does not so elect, or if the property is disposed of before the six months have passed, then the property will still assume a basis equal to its fair market value at the time of death.  Definitions  \\"Property acquired from the decedent\\" under IRC ¬ß 1014(b) generally includes property acquired by \\"bequest, devise or inheritance\\", property the decedent gives to his or her estate, and certain revocable trusts.See -(10) for a complete list of \\"property acquired from the decedent.\\"  Rationale for stepped-up basis  One possible explanation for the stepped- up basis rule under IRC ¬ß 1014 is to avoid the difficulty of ascertaining a decedent's adjusted basis in property that could have been held for decades.Samuel A. Donaldson, Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials, 123 (2nd Ed. 2007). A second theory is that a decedent is not likely trying to evade taxes by passing property at death, so mandating carryover basis, which would preserve the gain in the beneficiary, is unnecessary.Id. Third, the federal government imposes estate taxes on transfers of wealth at death based on those assets‚Äô values as of that date.See Title 26 of the United States Code, Subtitle B, Chapter 11, Subchapter A for the federal estate tax. Were no step up in basis allowed, the federal government could potentially receive a windfall from estates subject to estate tax by recovering federal estate tax based on capital assets‚Äô values as of a decedent's date of death, while also receiving capital gains tax when such assets are sold by an estate or a beneficiary based on the difference between the value of the asset when sold and the price at which such asset was purchased by a decedent.

The tactic for keeping the party unnoticed by the authorities was to keep quiet while the train was in the stations. The first Space Hijackers Circle Line Party took place on 10 March 1999. The Space Hijackers was a group originating in the United Kingdom and active between 1999 and 2014http://www.spacehijackers.org that defined itself as \\"an international band of anarchitects who battle to save our streets, towns and cities from the evils of urban planners, architects, multinationals and other hoodlums\\". Time Out magazine described the group as \\"an inventive and subversive group of London ‚ÄòAnarchitects‚Äô who specialise in reclaiming public spaces ‚Äì usually without permission.\\" The group's activities included \\"guerrilla benching\\"Sawyer, Patrick. \\"Guerilla gardeners stage a sit-down protest\\", Evening Standard, 2007-04-04. Accessed 2008-01-10. ‚Äî restoring benches that had been recently removed and bolting them to the ground ‚Äî organising a midnight game of cricket in the centre of the City of London financial district, and satirising the glossy architects' drawings that are displayed on the perimeter of luxury apartments by depicting children‚Äôs playgrounds and other projects they believe to be actually desirable. Many of these activities aimed to bring to people's attention to the role which corporations play in society in a different light. Purpose The Space Hijackers existed mainly to change the public's perception of spaces it regularly uses, mainly by staging unexpected events. Their explicit objective was \\"to effect and change the physical space of architecture\\", and, eschewing violent protest and other forms of transparent direct action, their methods aimed \\"to invade and re-brand corporate space\\". They believed that the use of physical space is becoming more and more politicised, and thus in order to break apart from that politicization they staged events that were typically 'unusual' for that particular space, 'hijacking' it and hoping to change people's perception of the use of that space forever. They believed that increasing politicisation usually leads to increased subordination and discrimination and other forms of domination and control and so Space Hijackers claimed to seek to break down and deconstruct society's notions of space. They sought to effect this by attempting to undermine the authority of the owner's \\"text\\", confusing and re-contextualising it and thereby making apparent the possibility of an alternative future. Protests tended to be non- violent and Space Hijacker projects usually involved a good sense of fun. Protest strategy includes involving passers-by. The Space Hijackers had many contacts with other groups, including but not limited to Critical Mass, Indymedia, Rhythms of Resistance samba band, free media collective iconscious, Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping and evoLhypergrapHyCx. The Hijackers pulled several of these groups together in Anarchitecture Week 2005, a week of anti-building related activities in response to, and hosted at the same time as Architecture Week. Projects Formed in 1999, their first major action was the Circle Line Party - a party on London Underground's Circle Line which attracted around 150 people armed with sound systems, disco lights and bars all disguised as luggage.

Symptoms The symptoms of brain stem tumors vary greatly and can include ataxia, cranial nerve palsy, headaches, problems with speech and swallowing, hearing loss, weakness, hemiparesis, vision abnormalities, ptosis, and behavioral changes. Another possible symptom is vomiting. Headaches related to brainstem tumors may be worse shortly after waking up in the morning.http://neurosurgery.mgh.harvard.edu/abta/primer.htm Diagnosis An MRI is better than a CT scan when a brainstem tumor is in the differential diagnosis. Types of brain stem tumors The most common form of brainstem tumor is the brainstem glioma. Treatment  Treatment typically consists of radiotherapy and steroids for palliation of symptoms. (Proton Beam Therapy should be included here by someone with good knowledge of it; it is more accurate, and very importantly for pediatric cases, has reduced side effects.) Radiotherapy may result in minimally extended survival time. Prognosis Prognosis is very poor, with only 37% of treated patients surviving one year or more. Topotecan has been studied in the treatment of brainstem glioma, otherwise, chemotherapy is probably ineffective, though further study is needed.

The name refers to the fjord leading into the Norwegian capital Oslo, at the time called Kristiania. Launched from its shipyard on 23 November 1912, it was put into service in 1913, the same year as its sister ship, SS Bergensfjord. It embarked on its maiden voyage on 4 June that year, sailing from Christiania (Oslo) through Christiansand, Stavanger and Bergen to New York, with the captain S. C. Hiortdahl. Kristianiafjord had a tonnage of 10,699, and was fitted with wireless and electric light. She could take 1,200 passengers ‚Äì 100 first class, 250 second class and 850 third class. Kristianiafjord remained on the same route for the next four years, but on 15 June 1917 the ship wrecked near Cape Race, Newfoundland due to navigational error. There were 1144 persons on board at the time, but no lives were lost. About two weeks later, on 28 June, the wreck was destroyed and lost in a storm. Other ships by the same name The same name was later used by the company for two other ships. The first one (tonnage 6,759) was purchased in 1921, and sold in 1955 to Marinos & Frangos, Nassau, who renamed it Aghios Stefanos. The last Kristianiafjord (tonnage 17,188) was a bulk carrier, bought in 1981. It had previously been in the possession of D. Lauritzen, Denmark, under the name of Dan Bauta. It was purchased by the Norwegian America Line in 1989, but sold to Vibeke K/S, Oslo, in 1993, and renamed Federal Vibeke.

During the boy's childhood, the family moved from Kidderminster to Stratford-upon-Avon, where Helmore later trained his father's choir and taught in a school which his father had founded. Until the age of sixteen, he was educated at Mill Hill School with his brother Frederick. In 1837, he began his studies at Magdalen Hall Oxford, graduating in 1840. He was ordained in the Church of England in the same year, and took up a curacy at St. Michael's, Lichfield, where he was also a priest-vicar in the Cathedral. Two years later, he was appointed as precentor and vice- principal at St. Mark's College, Chelsea, where the principal was Derwent Coleridge (son of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge). He soon came to be on friendly terms with his new colleague and, in 1844, he married Kate Pridham, who was Derwent Coleridge's sister-in-law. His main duty at St. Mark's was to train the students to sing a daily unaccompanied choral service in the college chapel. In the basic musical training, he was assisted by John Pyke Hullah. The choir's repertoire grew to include such as the anthems of Gibbons and Byrd and the motets of Palestrina, Vittoria and Marenzio. Helmore's growing reputation as a choirmaster led to his appointment in 1846 as master of the choristers in the Chapel Royal, St. James's, where one of his pupils was Arthur Sullivan. He continued as precentor at St. Mark's, however, until 1877. At this time in Anglican and Catholic musical circles, there was a growing interest in plainsong. The sixteenth-century Booke of Common Praier Noted of John Merbecke was republished in 1844. In the same year, Helmore's friend William Dyce brought out his Book of Common Prayer with Plain Song. Helmore himself resolved to research and contribute. His aim was to create a setting which was authentic, but also well fitted to the text in tempo and accentuation. In 1849 he completed The Psalter Noted, the first of a series of similar works. His Primer of Plainsong (1877) came to be regarded as the standard work on the subject. In 1853, the British ambassador to Sweden, G. J. R. Gordon, returned to England with a copy of the sixteenth-century song book Piae Cantiones, which he presented to John Mason Neale, known for his interest in early music. He, in turn, passed it on to Helmore whom he knew to be expert in the interpretation of the mensural notation in which the tunes were given. Neale translated the texts into English or, in a few cases, wrote completely new texts. He and Helmore published 12 of these tunes in that same year as Carols for Christmastide, and the following year 12 more as Carols for Eastertide. The Christmas set included Christ was born on Christmas Day from Resonet in laudibus, Good Christian men, rejoice from In dulci jubilo and Good King Wenceslas as completely new words for the spring carol Tempus adest floridum. Helmore immediately went on to publish a more substantial collection, The Hymnal Noted, where the texts were mostly Neale's translations from the Latin.Margaret Vainio, Good King Wenceslas - an \\"English\\" Carol Helmore was appointed as executor of the will of Chauncy Hare Townshend and, on the latter's death in 1868, together with co-executrix Angela Burdett- Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts, he undertook the responsibility of founding an elementary school in London, which was finally opened in Rochester Street, Westminster, in 1876. His interest in plainsong led him to make several visits, in and after 1875, to the Abbey of Saint Gall in Switzerland, to examine an ancient manuscript supposed to be an accurate copy of a book on Gregorian chant written by Saint Gregory himself. He died at his home in Pimlico on 6 July 1890 and was buried in Brompton Cemetery.

Egan, a young boy, has come here to visit relatives and attend a fair. The village's people are terrified by the noises that come from the top of a small nearby mountain. No one has ever investigated the source of the sound, but the general rumor is that a thing called the \\"Megrimum\\" lives up there, kept at bay only through the use of various charms and offerings Teased by his cousin, Egan decides to make a trek up the mountain to investigate the source of the noises. When he discovers what's really up there, he has a hard decision to make about whether or not to inform the village. When something goes wrong, Egan's cousin Ada tells everyone in the town of Instep that Egan was trekking up the rise. Everyone in the town starts looking for Egan. At the top of the rise Egan discovers that there is no Megrimum; the source of the sound is a boiling spring inside a cave, that echos when it rains. Egan tries to tell everyone in Instep that the Megrimum is fake, but everyone thinks he was lying.

Wayne Townsend (May 1, 1926 - July 3, 2015) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Indiana. A Democrat, he was his party's gubernatorial nominee in 1984. Townsend was defeated by the incumbent Republican Governor Robert D. Orr. Biography Townsend was born on May 1, 1926, on the family farm in Grant County, Indiana, near the town of Upland.Wayne Townsend-obituary A farmer from Hartford City, Indiana, he was the grandson of Indiana Governor M. Clifford Townsend. Townsend received 1,036,832 ballots (47.2 percent of the two-party vote) to Orr's 1,146,497 (52.8 percent). Townsend ran 195,351 votes ahead of his party's presidential nominee, former Vice President of the United States Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota.Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections, 2005 edition In January 1977, Townsend, then a member of the Indiana State Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote to ratify the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. The Senate had been deadlocked 25-25 on ERA. First Lady Rosalynn Smith Carter telephoned Townsend and urged him to switch his vote. Townsend did accordingly change his vote, and the ERA passed, 26-24. Indiana became the 35th and final state to ratify the controversial amendment, which was opposed by a grassroots organization headed by conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, then of Illinois. Thirty-eight states are required for ratification of a constitutional amendment.Donald T.

In 1980, Bayh was unseated by Dan Quayle, as Reagan-Bush electors first carried Indiana. Until 2004, Townsend was a Purdue trustee. In 2007, he received the Frank O'Bannon Public Service Award, named for the former Democratic governor of Indiana who died in office in 2003. In 2004, Townsend, a veteran crusader for liberal causes, was an advocate for presidential hopeful Howard Dean of Vermont, who thereafter became the chairman of the Democratic National Committee.Ballot and Bios for Candidates  Indiana Progressives Townsend began farming in 1951 on a tract, subsequently extended to a operation near Hartford City, the seat of Blackford County in east central Indiana. The farm spills over into neighboring Grant County. Townsend Farms maintains some 2,400 hogs and ships some 1,000 per week to the market.Purdue University - Board of Trustees - Trustees At the age of thirty-two, Townsend was first elected to the Indiana House of Representatives in 1958, a heavily Democratic year nationally. Thereafter, he was elevated to the State Senate. He is a firm advocate of public education, having served on the team that worked for passage of the School Reorganization Act of 1959 and its reauthorization in 1965. Townsend recalls that his late father peppered conversations at the kitchen table with discussion of national and world affairs. Education was rooted in Townsend's upbringing even though neither of his parents went beyond the eighth grade. Despite limited family resources, Townsend completed a degree in agriculture at Purdue. He was also for eight years a trustee of Earlham College, a Quaker institution in Richmond, Indiana, before he was invited to join the Purdue board. In 2006, Townsend campaigned for his nephew, Joseph R. \\"Joe\\" Pearson (born 1943), a Democrat who unsuccessfully challenged Republican Secretary of State Todd Rokita, who won a second term. Pearson, also from Hartford City, graduated from Ball State University in Muncie with a doctorate in education. Townsend declared that Pearson is \\"cut from the same cloth\\" as former Senator Bayh and former U.S. Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, the co-chairman of the 9-11 Commission. Prior to his failed statewide race, Pearson had been the assistant commissioner of agriculture under Governor Evan Bayh (now U.S. senator and son of Birch Bayh), and then Governors O'Bannon and Joe Kernan.decaturdailydemocrat.com/index.php?...&task;=view&id;=168&Itemid;=27 In 2008 Joe Pearson was elected into the Indiana House of Representatives.

Since 1979, Mark Townsend has managed and co-owned Townsend Farms. Wayne Townsend, meanwhile, remains a Purdue benefactor. Townsend's other son, Jay, was a 2010 Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in New York. Townsend died on July 3, 2015 while on a family trip to Michigan. He had amyloidosis, a heart condition.

It is also the title of the accompanying album. Geoffrey Richardson co-wrote one of the pieces.Roche, Henry, Still Life at the Penguin Cafe: Arranged for Piano by Henry Roche, Edition Peters, 2002 The ballet's debut production in 1988 was performed by The Royal Ballet at Covent Garden, in England. The ballet was conceived by David Bintley (at that time resident choreographer at Covent Garden), who approached Simon Jeffes about the music that was to be used in the choreography. The music for the ballet was drawn from several musical pieces composed by Jeffes before the ballet was conceived, composed during the period 1981 to 1987. Most of the pieces were originally written for small ensembles, consisting of, for example, violin, cello, guitar and piano. Jeffes orchestrated the pieces for the ballet, and in the Royal Ballet production, they were performed by a full orchestra. The ballet was filmed in 1988 by London Weekend Television and commercially released. The name of the ballet is derived from that of the Penguin Cafe Orchestra, which was Simon Jeffes' ensemble.  Ballet story  The pieces / sections in the ballet are: # The Penguin Cafe (musical piece Air √† Danser) # Utah Longhorn Ram (musical piece Prelude and Yodel) # Texan Kangaroo Rat (musical piece Long Distance, original title Horns of a Bull) # Humboldt's Hog Nosed Skunk Flea (musical piece The Ecstasy of the Dancing Flea, original title Pythagoras's Trousers) # Southern Cape Zebra (SCZ)(musical piece White Mischief) # Rain Forest People (musical piece Now Nothing) # Brazilian Woolly Monkey (musical piece Music By Numbers) # Conclusion (musical piece Numbers 1-4)  Story line  The ballet begins with a voice-over (by Jeremy Irons) describing how the great auk was very recently made extinct by man. The initial segment is set in a cafe, and several humans and penguins dance. Each subsequent segment prior to the conclusion shows an endangered species (or, in the case of the Rain Forest People, a culture.) The conclusion shows all the characters withstanding a downpour, and gathering on an ark-like boat. The overall theme of the ballet is pro-environment, pro-conservation. The ballet seeks to make the audience more aware of endangered species.

Amitermitinae have as typical characteristics: a usually rounded head with a bilobed clypeus. The mandibles of their soldiers usually has a single median tooth. They have evolved the ability to have many reproductives in their colony, up to a hundred, which allows very large colonies. As with other members of their family, Termitidae, they have lost most of their cellulose-digesting protozoa. Instead, they eat fungi, which digest cellulose and other organic matter. As a result, the Termitidae can make use of a wide variety of foods; not only rotten wood, but also grass, seeds, dung, soil, and detritus MacKay WP (1991) The role of ants and termites in desert communities. p113-150 in; Polis GA ed.

In addition, some species can synthesize nitrogen compounds.Schaefer DA Whitford WG (1981) Nutrient cycling by the subterranean termite Gnathitermes tubiformans in a Chihuahuan desert ecosystem. Oecologia 48; 277-283. Many members of the Amitermitinae have evolved a very effective way of securing food. The Amitermes species especially build a shell of earth by cementing the earth with their saliva and use it to cover vegetation. This smothers the plant and they can then eat the fungi that grow in the safety of the covering. They probably evolved in savanna, monsoon, and desert regions because their runways are not very resistant to rain erosionWeber CE (1993) Cretaceous termites and soil phosphorus. J. Soil Biol.

The battle occurred during the Gunboat War, itself part of the Napoleonic Wars. In the battle, two British frigates captured or destroyed three or four Dano-Norwegian gunboats. The Danish and British accounts of the battle differ. Danish account The Dano-Norwegian Navy had based three gun- schooners Odin, Thor, and Balder, and the gun-barge Cort Adeler at the pilot station on Silda. However, only Thor and Balder, plus a third, smaller gunboat, were involved in the battle. On 23 July the British frigates , Captain Richard Byron, and , Captain William Ferris, launched their assault. One of the Dano-Norwegian boats was able to hit at least one of the British boats, killing several British soldiers. Still, the British captured the station. The crew of one of the Dano-Norwegian boats scuttled their vessel and escaped. The British took the other two captured vessels as prizes and sent their crews as prisoner of war in England. The British also captured merchantmen moored in the vicinity. British account Belvidera and Nemesis were sailing close in-shore of Studtland, Norway. On the evening of 22 July a boat from Belvidera scouting a deep bay sighted three Dano-Norwegian gun- vessels. The next morning seven boats from the two frigates entered the creek and cut out the two larger Dano-Norwegian vessels. The British suffered no casualties, though the Norwegians lost four men killed. The two larger vessels, Balder and Thor, commanded by Lieutenants Dahlreup and Rasmusen, were schooner-rigged. Each mounted two long 24-pounder guns and six 6-pounder howitzers and had a crew of 45 men. The third gun-vessel, Gunboat No. 5, was of a smaller class; she carried one long 24-pounder and had a crew of 25 men. Her crew ran her up a fiord where they abandoned her; the decision was then made to burn her her. The British prize money reckoning refers to three vessels, Balder, Thor, and Fortuna. Fortuna may have been a merchant vessel seized at the time. Aftermath The local Norwegian commander, vicar Gabriel Heiberg, failed to alert other Dano-Norwegian naval vessels nearby that could have helped repel the attack. He also later issued an order to keep out of the way to avoid combat, an action for which he later underwent a court-martial.

(C) Found. ¬´ Pour la science ¬ª The journal Revue de Synth√®se (abbreviation: RSyn) was created by Henri Berr in 1900 under the title Revue de synth√®se historique. It has had a variety of editorial partners since its creation. It is currently published in paper and electronic version by the Springer Verlag publishing company in Paris. Background of the journal In 1900, Henri Berr founded the journal Revue de synth√®se historique to respond to abuses of learning and compartmentalization among disciplines. A venue for interdisciplinary exchanges, particularly between philosophers and historians and between geographers and sociologists, the journal quickly gained legitimacy in the field of scholarly journals and wielded considerable influence in the emergence of a new history that was expressed with the creation of the encyclopaedic collection L'√âvolution de l'Humanit√© run by Henri Berr himself and by Lucien Febvre, and then with the creation, in 1929, of Annales d'histoire √©conomique et sociale by Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch. The Journal has been published under several series: First series 1900-13 1900¬© Found. ¬´ Pour la science ¬ª 1913¬© Found. ¬´ Pour la science ¬ª From 1900 to 1913, the first of these was an expression of Henri Berr's initial project (see the program published in 1900). Second series 1913-30 After ten years (see the overview written in 1910) and in tandem with the creation of the collection L'√âvolution de l'Humanit√©, the second series, published from 1913 to 1930, pursued the same objectives as Revue de synth√®se historique (see the notice for the new series in 1913) and broadened them to include debates that were then surrounding reforms in the mathematical and physical sciences, philosophy and the history of science, and the development of new approaches to social sciences. The Journal became the mouthpiece of the Foundation ‚ÄúPour la science‚Äù and of the Centre international de synth√®se, created in 1925 by Henri Berr Third series 1931-85 1936¬© Found. ¬´ Pour la science ¬ª 1945¬© Found. ¬´ Pour la science ¬ª Some years later, it would be transformed into a third series, published from 1931 to 1985, entitled Revue de synth√®se (see ‚ÄúAu bout de trente ans‚Äù, 1931). It is still published under this title today. Its change of direction in 1931 was contemporary with the creation of Annales. From this point on, Revue de synth√®se welcomed pieces on philosophy, the history of science and the social and human sciences whereas the new journal looked at economic and social history. It became one of the vehicles for the spread of the logical empiricism of the Vienna Circle in the French language. Robert Bouvier, the Swiss philosopher acted as an intermediary with Otto Neurath, translating his texts and maintaining a correspondence with him. Fourth series 1986-2001 The fourth series was published, like its predecessor, in partnership with the √âditions Albin Michel publishing company, from 1986 to 2001. In a context where certainties surrounding economic and social history were disintegrating, it aimed to revive intellectual history and the history of science on the initiative of Jacques Roger, Ernest Coumet and Jean-Claude Perrot (see ‚ÄúAux lecteurs‚Äù, 1986). After sixteen years of collective work, it took up the journal‚Äôs original objective: finding a way to best express the agenda of history and the social sciences by subjecting it to the modern-day dictates of philosophical critique and the requirements of mathematical, physical and biological sciences. Fifth series 2002-2006 A fifth series appeared in partnership with the Rue d'Ulm publishing house at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure and covered the years 2002 to 2006, continuing a long tradition of discreet and rigorous explorations of connections and encounters between separate but necessarily interactive disciplines and the contemporary critical review of sciences and social sciences (see ‚ÄúAux lecteurs‚Äù, 2002). A century after its creation, Revue de synth√®se ran an overview of changes in relations between disciplines and of technical and economic reforms specific to scientific publishing (texts published in 2004, 2006). Sixth series 2007 on In 2007, a sixth series was opened in partnership with the Springer Verlag publishing company, extending its influence on the international scientific scene (see its presentation, 2007). ‚ÄúWe managed to produce the ideal journal‚Äù wrote Henri Berr after just ten years ‚Äúthat would continuously modernize and upgrade, while always doing its best in the right direction\\". Today Revue de synth√®se describes its current activity in these terms: > ‚ÄúThanks to support from scholars in France and abroad, Revue de synth√®se now > welcomes pieces that deal with intellectual history, epistemology, > philosophy, sociology, and economic, social, legal and cultural history.

In a context where disciplinary exchanges are undergoing major changes in France and abroad, Revue de synth√®se is now planning to play its part by returning in full force to its original mission, at the crossroads between philosophy, history, the sciences and social sciences, helping to form future scholars and intervening more easily on the international scene thanks to its partnership with the scientific publisher Springer Verlag, which dates from 2007. The Journal‚Äôs editorial staff notes that such reforms cannot rightfully take place without offering a reflection on the progress of specialized knowledge in the 20th century. As a result, since the early 1990s, it has been deliberately encouraging work on the history of science and the intellectual history of the past century, by organizing research days, granting access to its archives at the Institut pour la M√©moire de l‚Äô√©dition contemporaine (IMEC), publishing specialized works and digitizing its collection in partnership with the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. Revue de synth√®se has been directed by Eric Brian since 1995. Since 2007, it has been prepared by an editorial team that, as of late 2007, is composed of Laurie Catteuw, √âtienne Anheim, Vincent Bontems and Val√©rie Tesni√®re. Its editorial committee is made of Charles Alunni, Claude Blanckaert, Michel Blay, Dominique Bourel, Philippe Boutry, Jean-Pierre Cl√©ro, Jochen Hoock, Dominique Margairaz, Pierre-Fran√ßois Moreau, Jean-Claude Perrot, Dinah Ribard, Olivier Remaud and Jean-Marc Rohrbasser (see the full masthead). The ideas featured in the sixth series are presented in the bilingual article ‚ÄúTravail de synth√®se et diversit√© des langues/Synthesis work and diversity of languages‚Äù, which opens the first issue of 2007. Distributed in both electronic and paper version, Revue de synth√®se will be published quarterly starting with the first issue of 2008. In each edition it either presents the results of a long-standing project or a topical research report enhanced with additional texts or relevant documents. A large part of the publication is reserved for critical reviews, research columns, reports and reader‚Äôs notes (see the keys to the Journal given by Henri Berr in 1911, 1925, 1931).

He was the second of a sequence of five Bontemps to hold the position of Premier valet de la Chambre du Roi (\\"First valet of the king's bedchamber\\"The Chambre du Roi, more important that it might sound to a modern ear, was an essential part of the royal household, the Maison du Roi.) in uninterrupted succession between 1643 and 1766, when an early death, leaving no successor, broke the line.\\"Famille Bontemps\\" on the French Wikipedia has details There were four head or Premier valets de chambre, of whom Bontemps became the most senior in 1665, and thirty-two valets.Da Vinha (online):6 and SS Memoirs:III:40 and n.  Life  Louis XIV by Hyacinthe Rigaud His father, Jean Baptiste Bontemps (1590‚Äì1659), had been surgeon to Louis XIII of France before becoming a Premier Valet in 1643. Alexandre succeeded him on his death in 1659, dying in office in 1701, by which time he was a count and marquis, holding several key offices controlling both the palaces and towns of Versailles and Marly, the Swiss Guard who guarded the King and his palaces, and the household of the Dauphin. He was thus a key figure in maintaining the security of the King, and managing his household. The Governorships of Versailles and Marly had been given to him in 1665 after the death of Blouin, then the senior head-valet, and passed to Blouin's son in turn when Bontemps died.SS Memoirs:I:146 and Da Vinha He was also a member of the Conseil du Roi (the Royal Council) and held a senior rank in the chivalric Order of Saint Lazarus. He seems to have been an amiable figure, entirely devoted to Louis, who in turn trusted him as he did few others. He was twelve years older than the King. He was one of a small handful of witnesses to the secret second marriage of Louis to Madame de Maintenon. Saint-Simon speaks of \\"royal coaches (the kind without armorial bearings on the harness, such as Bontemps used for the King's private missions)\\" and says that \\"all the secret orders, the private audiences, the sealed letters to and from the King, in fact all the mysteries passed through his hands\\".SS Memoirs:I:35 coaches and I:146 mysteries Saint-Simon anecdotes have him arranging the marriage to an obscure country nobleman of an illegitimate daughter of Louis who, unlike many, he did not choose to acknowledge officially,Da Vinha (online):8 and, in Louis's earlier years, leading a minor mistress enveloped in a cloak up the back stairs to the King's study for her assignation; the king having put the key on the outside of the door.The Duke of Lauzun, also involved with the lady, had locked the door and hidden himself and the key in the privy opposite, from where he watched the ensuing frustrations SS Memoirs:III;463-4 He emerges better than most from the Memoirs of Saint-Simon, whose father had been a friend of Bontemps. Saint-Simon asked him for advice on important issues, using him sparingly. The memoirist Choisy wrote that part of his success with Louis came from never asking him for favours,Choisy Memoirs, pp183-4, quoted Riley, op & page cit although Saint-Simon says that he \\"loved procuring favours solely for the pleasure of it ... great numbers of people, some of them highly placed, owed their fortunes to him, and he was modest almost to the point of breaking with them if they so much as mentioned it\\". The two statements are not incompatible, as Bontemps was in a position to ask favours from ministers and other powerbrokers. He says Bontemps was \\"rough and brusque in manner, yet respectful and always in his place.... His only skill lay in serving his master, and he was wholly intent on that... [he had been] influential for the past fifty years, and with the Court at his feet.\\"SS Memoirs:I:146 He once greatly amused Louis, when asked how his wife was, by \\"replying mechanically with a shrug\\".Da Vinha (online):5 He used the Swiss Guards stationed around the Palaces and gardens to report on the behaviour of courtiers, including their church attendance, as well as political and sexual intrigues.Philip F. Riley, A Lust for Virtue: Louis XIV's Attack on Sin in Seventeenth-Century France, p.146, 2001, Greenwood Press, and Da Vinha (online):6, quoting Saint-Simon As Intendant or Governor of Versailles, his control extended to the whole town outside the palaces, where many courtiers had houses.  Premier valet  Chateau de Versailles, in Bontemps' charge The office of head valet dated back to a historically unwise complaint some generations back by the Gentlemen of the Bedchamber, always great nobles, against the more menial aspects of the role. Once established, the valets expanded in number and importance, somewhat at the Gentlemen's expense. One of their number was always a few steps from the King wherever he went, and the four Premiers, rotating quarterly, were alone able to, and presumably did, sleep at the foot of the royal bed.Da Vinha:1-3 In addition one of the ordinary valets was en poste by the King's bed all day, inside the balustrade that separated it, like an altar communion-rail, from the rest of the room. In the morning Lev√©e and evening Coucher ceremonies, the Grand Chamberlain of France and Premier valet did the work, whilst the First Gentleman of the bedchamber (rotating annually among the four holders) had \\"the command of the room\\" (le commandement de la chambre). However, Saint-Simon explains carefully that if the First Gentleman of the year was absent, the Premier valet of the quarter was en commande of the ceremony, attended daily by about a hundred of the greatest courtiers ‚Äì a significant point of prestige.  Private life  Apart from a large apartment in the palace, and a separate house in Versailles, Bontemps had a \\"h√¥tel particulier\\" (townhouse) on the √éle Saint- Louis in the centre of Paris, with thirty rooms and a staff of twelve.Da Vinha 12 According to Saint-Simon, he copied his master with a secret second marriage to the mother of La Roche, head-valet to Louis's grandson, Philip V of Spain. The children of his first marriage married very well, and two generations later a Bontemps married an illegitimate son of the last Prince of Conti, a cadet branch of the Royal Family. Others married into the largest banking families in France. There is a portrait of the Comtesse de La Ch√¢tre, daughter of Louis XV's Bontemps head valet, by Elisabeth Vig√©e-Lebrun in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, dated 1789, the last year of the Ancien Regime.

The Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute (BDRI) is a research and educational centre dedicated to the understanding and conservation of cetaceans and the marine environment in which they live. The Institute's BDRI centre was founded by the biologist Bruno D√≠az L√≥pez in Sardinia, Italy in 2005. In 2014, the BDRI opened a new facility in Galicia, Spain. BDRI concentrates its efforts on research into dolphins because they are predators at the top of their food chain, so their well-being provides an excellent indication of the health of the entire ecosystem on which they, and humans, depend. Whales and dolphins around the world are under threat from marine pollution, over-fishing, getting entangled in nets, whaling and uncontrolled tourism. The BDRI is intended to contribute to the understanding and conservation of dolphins, expand the public's knowledge and concern for the marine environment, and add to the knowledge base of bottlenose dolphins through publications of collected and analysed field data. Using study techniques that neither harm nor seriously disturb the animals, the BRDI is currently engaged in the conduction of a long-term study about the ecology and behaviour of a bottlenose dolphin population, as well as collecting detailed information about their environment. The BDRI has educational and research programmes aimed at providing extra support for scientists early in their careers, science students, local students and scientists from developing countries, including training opportunities in the field, grants, and online and field courses. Significance of BDRI research projects Cetacean populations are affected by man's use of coastal waters, particularly by fisheries activities and habitat modification. BDRI research projects provide scientific data to assist environmental agencies in managing and conserving marine natural resources and to obtain fundamental knowledge about this behaviourally flexible and cosmopolitan species. Their programs are conducted under a Research Permit issued by the Department of Environment of the Galician Government as part of their cooperation with the national network for the study of marine mammals (CEMMA). Additional studies by the BDRI have also been conducted in Italy, Spain and Abu Dhabi to date. Previous and current BDRI research projects BDRI researchers address a wide range of questions to form a multi-dimensional picture of the marine mammals behaviour and ecology and its relationship to the rest of the planet, including human society. The BDRI research has a multidisciplinary approach with a current focus on four main research projects:  Cetacean distribution along Galician coast: Current studies by the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute BDRI research team principally focus on the cetacean species frequenting the inshore waters of the outer Arousa Firth, however, a new area like Galician coastal waters (north-west Spain) allows for new projects and a more diverse range of issues and species. These waters are characterized by high biodiversity and productive fisheries, supported by nutrient input due to upwelling. Twenty species of cetaceans have been recorded in Galician waters, of which the most abundant appear to be short-beaked common dolphins and bottlenose dolphins. Other species present in the area include harbour porpoises, Risso‚Äôs dolphins and long-finned pilot whale. Conservation issues for cetaceans in Galician waters include interactions with fisheries, which may be a significant cause of mortality, overfishing, and oil spills. Hence, the information collected will inform conservation plans by identifying coastal areas of high importance to cetaceans. Wild bottlenose dolphins and humans frequenting the same small areas makes boat interaction more or less inevitable. BDRI researchers provided quantified data about bottlenose dolphin diving behaviour in the presence and absence of boats in Galicia. The data reported by BDRI researchers could be used to implement precautionary management proposals that take into account the potential effects of boat presence on dolphins.Diaz Lopez, B., Shirai, J.A.; Bilbao Prieto, A. & M√©ndez Fern√°ndez, P., 2008. \\"Diving activity of a solitary wild free ranging bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)\\".

Behavioural ecology of dolphins and impact of human activities on their lives: Much of the research work is based upon repeat observations of individually-recognisable dolphins, providing data for a range of long-term and ongoing studies on the abundance, site fidelity, home range, social structure and behaviour of this population. The study of dolphins social structures defines an important class of ecological relationships between individuals and their nearby conspecifics. Common bottlenose dolphins live in fission‚Äìfusion societies within which individuals associate in small groups that change in composition, often on a daily or hourly basis. Fission‚Äìfusion societies limit the effect of within-unit competition through unit splits during periods of high competition, and they enhance cooperative effects through unit cohesion when the ecological costs of aggregating are low or benefits of sociality are high. Human activities can influence the distribution of food resources, which may promote the evolution of social organizations as a response to fluctuations in the costs of feeding competition. Therefore, fission‚Äìfusion societies present a good opportunity to examine the costs and benefits of association in dolphin populations affected by human use of coastal waters, especially by fisheries activities and habitat modification. Individual-based studies focusing explicitly the variability of social unit structure in relation to anthropogenic factors are few. In this project, BDRI researchers will study the patterns of association of different populations of bottlenose dolphins (in Italy and Spain) and will describe the way in which their association behaviour is related to the way they respond to food patches created by human activities. BDRI researchers studied interactions between dolphins and gillnets along the north-eastern coast of Sardinia (Italy). Although dolphins benefit from taking fish entangled in gillnets, the association with gillnets is harmful because it exposes dolphins to additional risk. An observed annual estimate of the number of dolphins caught in gillnets was 3.54%. The extent of the estimated by-catch is worrisome in terms of the ability of bottlenose dolphins off Sardinia to sustain such an annual loss. The higher annual numbers of immature dolphins than adults dolphins caught in gillnets was related with a lack of experience together with and the tendency of immatures to play and/or to spend a lot of time scouting.Diaz Lopez B., Addis A., Fabiano, F., 2013. \\"Ecology of bottlenose dolphins along the north-western Sardinian coastal waters (Italy)\\".

BDRI's researchers have also examined the effects of aquaculture on marine fauna in general, and more specifically, the impacts of aquaculture on dolphins in different marine fin fish farms off the coast of Sardinia, Italy.

In: European Research on Cetaceans - 15 (Ed- P.G.H. Evans).European Cetacean Society ECS, pp 70-73. Cambridge, UK. 2002 Marine aquaculture and, in particular intensive fish farming, have shown a large expansion in most Mediterranean countries over the last ten years. To curb predation, many marine fish farms employ control methods which exclude, harass or remove predators. One such method, predator netting, creates a physical barrier that protects farmed fish from attacks by airborne and underwater predators. The incidental capture of marine mammals by commercial fisheries is often a controversial and emotive issue. A potential impact on marine mammals as a result of aquaculture interaction is death or injury through entanglement in gear. BDRI researchers carried out the first attempt in the Mediterranean basin to obtain information on encounter rate, group size and incidental capture of bottlenose dolphins in a marine fish farm. The regular occurrence of some dolphins suggests individual preferences for the fish farm area. The incidental bottlenose dolphin capture observed in large, loose predator nets is cause for concern, as it is questionable whether or not the bottlenose dolphins in the area can sustain incidental capture of this magnitude. The information gained from this study showed the necessity for further regulations to be established, both in the use of predator nets and management of marine fish farms.Diaz Lopez B. and Shirai, J.A., 2008. \\"Marine aquaculture and bottlenose dolphins social structure\\".

Assessing the consequences of fisheries and habitat modification with relatively obvious effects on marine predators can be difficult. BDRI researchers were the first to show how coastal fisheries and aquaculture are not only directly affecting marine predators but could also indirectly affect their social structure and behaviour. BDRI researchers suggest that the main management issues raised by their studies relates to the dolphins' habitat. The feeding opportunities for dolphins that are created by human activities have become part of their \\"way of life\\", part of their habitat requirements. When top predators display complex social responses to activities not directed at them, the task of studying all possible effects in the food chain can become even more challenging. Further work should focus on elucidating how human activities induce social and spatial changes in marine top predators.Diaz Lopez B., Bunke, M. and Shirai, J.A., 2008. \\"Marine aquaculture off Sardinia Island (Italy):ecosystem effects evaluated through a trophic mass-balance model\\".

BDRI researchers observed that the use of pingers reduces dolphin mortality due to bycatch on gillnets. Definite proof that acoustic devices have a long-term effectiveness has not been found.

Bottlenose dolphins living around coastal regions have received much attention due to their increased vulnerability of inhabiting areas where marine traffic is concentrated. Marine traffic has previously been observed to elicit responses in cetacean behaviours, but the cause and effects of these interactions has yet to be fully understood. BDRI's current study area of Aranci Bay, Sardinia, provides a unique insight into an area where the interactions of bottlenose dolphins and vessels remains largely unchecked. BDRI studies showed that the dolphins were surfacing less regularly in the presence of vessels and this response was further enhanced during vessel approaches. Moreover, by examining the influence of different types of vessel it was evident that the dolphins elicited a stronger response to tourist than fisheries vessels. The behaviour vessels display around the dolphins as well as speed, engine type and distance of approach were all factors that needed to be taken into consideration when analysing the changes observed. Research is contributing to a wider management scheme to ensure that marine traffic is monitored effectively when bottlenose dolphins are present.Underhill, K., Diaz Lopez, B., and Shirai, J.A., 2007. \\"Boat traffic effects on the diving behaviour of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in Sardinia, Italy\\".

Dolphins communication: Bioacoustics research provides important insights into animal behavior. Dolphins (family: Delphinidae) are an extremely vocal mammalian family and vocal communication plays an important role in mediating social interactions. Most BDRI studies of delphinid vocalizations have concentrated on bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus (in the Mediterranean, Italy, and in the Atlantic Ocean, Spain) and T. aduncus (in the Persian Gulf, Abu Dhabi, UAE). Until recently, communication behaviour had a limited role in conservation, being restricted to enhancing captive breeding programs or use in species counts. However, knowledge of how individuals within a population communicate can generate information ranging from measures of habitat use, social relevance, geographical variation, cultural transmission, etc., that can be applied to conservation. Marine mammals use sound for activities essential to survival and reproduction. Bottlenose dolphins are extremely vocal mammalian species, and vocal communication plays an important role in mediating social interactions. Amid the abundant literature pertaining to vocalizations of bottlenose dolphins, very little is known about the vocal repertoire of Mediterranean wild bottlenose dolphins. BDRI bioacoustical studies carried out year round from 2005 represent the first attempt to obtain information on the repertoire and production patterns of bottlenose dolphins resident in an area characterized by important interaction with human activities (tourism, aquaculture and coastal fisheries). Many vocal signals were strongly implicated in social and feeding interactions. Although many of these vocalizations have been previously described in the literature, their association with specific behaviours linked with human activities provides additional contextual information about their potential use as communication signals. One of BDRI's most recent projects shows that the number of whistles recorded in a group increased significantly as the number of mother-calf pairs increased, confirming that whistles may be used as contact calls. These studies use benign techniques to demonstrate the great diversity of communication signals emitted and indicate a functional role of these vocalizations during the observed behaviours.Diaz Lopez, B and Shirai, J.A., 2008. \\"Whistles characteristics and repertoire of wild bottlenose dolphins in Sardinia Island, Italy\\".

Mammalian Biology 76: 180-189. Cetaceans (dolphins, whales and porpoises) are often faced with the challenge of hearing strange sounds in environments with noise from both natural and anthropogenic sources. BDRI researchers have documented that human-introduced noise induces behavioural reactions in bottlenose dolphins. In addition noise pollution is being considered as a cause of displacement of cetaceans from preferred habitats. Short-term noise pollution may not create significant problems. Repeated or long-term noise pollution, however, can cause stress and debilitation and may be related to dolphin mortality. Related scientific publications:  Dolphins in the Persian Gulf: At least ten species of cetacean have been identified in the Persian Gulf, but most of these are considered vagrant or seasonal visitor. Only two species of dolphin, the Indo-Pacific humpback (Sousa chinensis) and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) are thought to be common residents of the Gulf. The finless porpoise (Neophocoena phocaenoides) is thought to be an uncommon resident. The conservation status of these species in Abu-Dhabi waters is totally unknown, largely because of the lack of research on either species. The world conservation status of these species is Data Deficient, that is, there is insufficient information on which to make an assessment. This deficiency hampers conservation and management efforts and the ability to assess the impact of human activities on local populations of this species. BDRI researchers participate in cooperation with the Environmental Agency of Abu Dhabi since 2014, for the first time in Abu Dhabi waters, in a research project in order to obtain accurate data on population estimate, distribution, potential threats and residence patterns of dolphin species observed in coastal waters of Abu-Dhabi (UAE). The final purpose of this project is to inform and improve the design of conservation and management interventions towards these species in Abu-Dhabi waters.D√≠az L√≥pez B, and Methion S, 2015. \\"Abundance estimate, distribution and use of habitat of dolphin species in Abu-Dhabi waters during the summer and winter 2014\\".

Every year new tropical species are catalogued in north Sardinia as having arrived from tropical waters as an effect of global warming, and entire ecosystems are being affected. BDRI researchers are committed to the implementation of proactive measures to help protect and sustain the local and global environment for future generations. The BDRI aims to achieve the objective of improved environmental performance through pollution prevention and continuous improvement. All BDRI members, workers and volunteers are expected to conduct their work in a manner compatible with the BDRI's Responsible Travel policy and objectives.

He played for the Boston Red Sox, Philadelphia Phillies, and Pittsburgh Pirates from 1964 to 1974. He batted and threw right-handed. Ryan was signed as an amateur free agent by the Boston Red Sox in 1960 and played for four of their minor league affiliates until 1964, when the Red Sox promoted him to the major leagues. After spending three full seasons with the organization, he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies. He played there for six years before he was dealt to the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1974. He played his last game on September 10 that year. Playing career Ryan signed with the Red Sox in 1961, beginning his 16-year pro career. After a one-game, late-season trial in 1964 and an extended audition in 1965, Ryan's major league career began in earnest in 1966. In 636 MLB games played, he collected 370 hits in 1,920 at bats for a .193 batting average. Of all non- pitchers since 1930 with at least 1,000 at-bats, only one, Ray Oyler (.175 BA), has a lower average. During Ryan's nine full seasons in the majors, he batted over .200 only three times. As Boston's most-used catcher in 1966, Ryan hit .214 in 116 games. Three years later, again as a first-string receiver who appeared in 133 games with the 1969 Phillies, he hit a career-high 12 home runs and batted .204. Then, in 1973, in limited service backing up regular Bob Boone, Ryan hit .232 in 69 at bats. Ryan was strong defensively, recording a .991 fielding percentage. In 1967, appearing in a team-high 79 games as a catcher, Ryan helped the \\"Impossible Dream\\" Red Sox win the American League pennant. He was the roommate of Tony Conigliaro, before Conigliaro sustained a season-ending injury after being hit by a pitch on August 18. Ryan appeared in Game 4 of the 1967 World Series as a late-inning replacement for starting catcher Elston Howard, going hitless in two at bats against Baseball Hall of Famer Bob Gibson. Then in 1974, Ryan was a reserve on the Pirates team that won the National League Eastern Division. On May 2, 1970, Ryan and Tim McCarver both broke their hands in a game between the Phillies and the San Francisco Giants. With their catching corps depleted, the Phils were forced to use Jim Hutto as a defensive substitute, even though he was an outfielder and first baseman. Ryan was able to return two months later on July 6, but landed on the disabled list again on August 15. Consequently, he played only 46 games that season. Longtime coach After his playing career, Ryan managed and coached in the Pirates' and Phillies' minor league organizations from 1975 to 1979, then coached at the Major League level for the Phillies for 16 seasons, from 1980 until 1995. He had surgery following the 1993 season on his right shoulder, the cumulative result of his years of throwing batting practice and warming-up pitchers. He worked two more seasons with ongoing pain and retired after the 1995 season. He was on the staff of three National League champions in Philadelphia, and the 1980 World Series champion, and worked for seven managers. Ryan's coaching tenure with the Phillies was the longest in franchise history until being surpassed by John Vukovich in 2004. It remains the second-longest coaching stint in franchise history .; Ryan died in his sleep on July 7, 2020, in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, at the age of 78.

Biography Tom Loftus was born in Roscommon town, Co. Roscommon in 1917. His grandmother ran a dispensary and his father was a journalist with the Roscommon Herald. Tom moved to Dublin in 1937 and married Ann Mooney in 1951. For most of his life he worked at the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) in the city. Career Loftus was chairman of The Leinster Council from 1972‚Äì1974, was chairman of the Dublin County Board and was a longstanding member of the organisation. He stood twice for the position of President of the GAA, but was twice pipped at the post, once by his namesake Dr. Michael Loftus. During his period as Dublin Chairman, the team won the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. In 1964, became the first chairman to bring his team to the United States, to raise awareness of the GAA in America. In 1965, Loftus was a member of the first GAA committee to examine Rule 27, which prevented members from playing, attending or promoting other sports. The rule was originally passed in 1902 and was intended as a way of safeguarding the GAA from the influence of non-gaelic sports, but ultimately resulted in the untimely demise of several promising careers within the organisation. The rule read \\"Any member of the association who plays or encourages in any way rugby, football, hockey or any imported game which is calculated to injuriously affect our national pastimes, is suspended from the association.\\" The first GAA committee failed to make any recommendations and it wasn't until 1971 that the ban was removed from the rulebooks. Tom was also well known in Dublin for his weekly column in the Evening Press which he wrote throughout the 1960s and 70s. Tom retired from his post in the ESB in 1977 and quickly became an advocate of junior level GAA, organising and coaching teams in Co. Wicklow, particularly Bray Emmets and Kilmacud Crokes. After his retirement, Tom received numerous awards and recognitions of his contribution to the organisation. Until his death in 2011, he was the oldest living former chairman in the Gaelic Athletic Association Successes ‚Ä¢ 1963 Dublin won the All Ireland Football Final against Galway Team: P. Flynn, L.

Such activity is often illegal. The legal definition in a given location may not specify all activities that would be covered. Indecent exposure may also be referred to as \\"sexual misconduct\\" or \\"public lewdness\\". Legal status History The issue of flashing or indecent exposure can be traced back in the United States as early as the 1870s as demonstrated in this 1874 Sacramento Daily Union article which reads: > A Shameless Fellow Shot in San Jose San Jose, California December 2d. [1874] > For several days past, an Italian, who refuses to give his name, has been in > the habit of standing on the corner of Fourth and Julian Streets in the > city, and making an exposure of his person to school children. This morning > complaint was made at the police office, and the officers Keane and Vance > were detailed to arrest him. About 4 o'clock this afternoon, after the > officers had arrested him ...Sacramento Daily Union, Volume 48, Number 7384, > 3 December 1874 In some areas of the United States of America in the early 1900s, women were expected to wear cumbersome dresses and pantaloon combinations when swimming. In 1907, Annette Kellerman, an Australian swimmer, was arrested on a Boston beach for public indecency for wearing her trademark one-piece swimsuit. After a public outcry at the arrest, the style had become generally acceptable by the 1910s. Laws In the United States, states have differing nudity and public decency laws. In most states, state law prohibits exposure of the genitals and/or the female nipples in a public place, while in other states simple nudity is legal, but evidence of intent to shock, arouse or offend other persons (lewd conduct) is evidence of prohibited conduct. For example, in most states, it is a criminal offense punishable by fines and/or imprisonment, and/or registered sex offender requirements and restrictions. Some states permit local governments to set local standards. Public nudity itself has not been a crime throughout California since a 2000 Appellate Court ruling, and prosecutions and convictions are unheard of, but arrests do still occur, though they also are unusual, and Vermont only prohibits \\"open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior\\" so many forms of public nudity are legal. Indecent exposure is defined as a crime in the United States Armed Forces by Article 120c, Uniform Code of Military Justice. The changes to Article 120c became part of the Manual for Courts-Martial in the 2012 edition. =Exemption for breastfeeding of infants= Most states exempt breastfeeding mothers from prosecution under these statutes. U.S. Public Law 106‚Äì58 Sec. 647., enacted in 1999, specifically provides that \\"a woman may breastfeed her child at any location in a Federal building or on Federal property, if the woman and her child are otherwise authorized to be present at the location.\\"Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act 2000, Cases Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. 501 U.S. 560 (1991) is a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States on freedom of speech and the ability of the government to outlaw certain forms of expressive conduct. The issue was whether Indiana's public indecency law prohibiting total nudity in public places violated the First Amendment. Chief Justice Rehnquist said that the law was clearly within the State's constitutional power because it furthered a substantial governmental interest in protecting societal order and morality. Public indecency statutes reflected moral disapproval of people appearing in the nude among strangers in public places, and this particular law followed a line of State laws, dating back to 1831, banning public nudity. A 21-year-old woman was ticketed in 2003 for appearing naked in a bar in Lincoln, Nebraska and posting the pictures on the Internet. Six male riders were charged with public indecency during the 2005 World Naked Bike Ride Chicago ride and later prosecuted with sentences ranging from fines and non- expungeable conviction to three months court supervision. In a 2003 case out of Massachusetts, three thirteen-year-old girls who were leaving a Catholic school reported that a man, in a nearby car, pulled down his pants, and revealed his bare posterior and a red thong. The man was arrested and read his Miranda rights. The police reported that he waived his rights and spoke to the police. He reportedly stated, \\"You stupid mother fucker, you don't have indecent exposure. I did not pull my prick out. I only pulled down my pants. It's not against the law to pull your pants down and show people your thong.\\" The case was referred to higher courts for clarification of the law. The Supreme Court of Massachusetts ruled that the law could refer to sudden, unexpected exposure of the buttocks, but that the defendant did not have fair warning that his conduct was prohibited.

Blood's a Rover is a 2009 crime fiction novel by American author James Ellroy. It follows American Tabloid and The Cold Six Thousand as the final volume of Ellroy's Underworld USA Trilogy. A 10,000-word excerpt was published in the December 2008 issue of Playboy. The book was released on September 22, 2009. James Ellroy dedicated Blood's a Rover \\"To J.M. Comrade: For Everything You Gave Me.\\" Plot introduction The book's title and epigraph is taken from a poem titled \\"Reveille\\" by A. E. Housman: > Clay lies still, but blood's a rover; > Breath's a ware that will not keep. > Up, lad; when the journey's over > There'll be time enough for sleep.A.E. Housman - \\"A Shropshire Lad\\" Ellroy's literary agent, Sobel Weber Associates, posted a brief blurb for Blood's a Rover on its website in September 2008. It mentioned the novel's three protagonists and briefly outlined some of the novel's major plot points. These include the reappearance of Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover, FBI infiltration into militant black power groups, Mafia activity in the Dominican Republic, and \\"voodoo vibe in Haiti.\\"Blood's a Rover Ellroy on Blood's a Rover Ellroy commented on the scope of Blood's a Rover several times during his tour to promote The Cold Six Thousand. When asked if he still saw Underworld U.S.A. as a trilogy, Ellroy responded, \\"American Tabloid is the first volume of my Underworld U.S.A. Trilogy. The Cold Six Thousand is my second. I will soon begin work on the epic third volume, a ghastly tale of political malfeasance and imperialistic bad juju from 1968 to 1972.\\" He said the book would have \\"a different [prose] style entirely\\" than The Cold Six Thousand. Ellroy said he would steer clear of the Watergate scandal: \\"The Cold Six Thousand... covers the matrix of American politics and crime from 1963 to 1968; the first, American Tabloid, covers 1958 to 1963; a third will proceed to 1972. You can see exactly where the story's going: the '68 election, the Mob's foreign casino plan, Nixon in office, all that. I'll stop short of Watergate, because Watergate bores me.\\" He also told interviewer Robert Birnbaum, \\"[Watergate]'s been done to death. And most of the characters are still alive; thus you can't use them fictionally.\\" Ellroy addresses the book's strong racial overtone in an interview with Rolling Stone. > Oh yeah... You're supposed to be seduced and shocked by the casual racism in > Blood's a Rover. This book is so full of race shit, it's fucking hilarious > shit. There's a lot of scenes of black people and white people cracking > jokes. And as much as the people grandstand about race in this book, they're > driven by racial animus and the idea of racial reconciliation. Because of > political correctness we are losing the outrageousness of humor. I always > think of Frank O'Connor's line from a million years ago: \\"a literature that > cannot be vulgarized is not literature at all and will not last.\\" Style and Structure Ellroy again utilizes the \\"telegraphic\\" writing style previously found in the two previous books in the trilogy. \\"Document Inserts,\\" journal entries, conversation transcripts, and redacted FBI profiles, again show character development and provide insights not readily evident in the narrative. Character development focuses on several main characters: Dwight Chalfont \\"The Enforcer\\" Holly, Wayne Tedrow, Jr., and Donald Linscott \\"Crutch\\" Crutchfield (Don Crutchfield is a real person and private investigator, and Ellroy uses a real and fictional portrayal of him in Blood's a Rover). As well as journal entries from Karen Sifakis and Marshall E. \\"Marsh\\" Bowen. Later in the novel, characters Robert Sinclair \\"Scotty\\" Bennett and Joan Rosen Klein are focused on. Through the evolution of the story, right-winger Holly makes a sharp move to the left, while Tedrow's search for peace and redemption are supported by his relationship with African-American Mary Beth Hazzard, whose deceased husband he had shot and killed. Reviews Reviewers were mostly positive about the book. In The Dallas Morning News, Preston Jones wrote, \\"History is refracted and reflected through Ellroy's peerless paragraphs, lending a fresh urgency and a sense of rediscovery to events thoroughly analyzed. Blood's a Rover commands your attention from the first page and, thanks to its heft, makes reading in piecemeal fashion daunting. Ellroy's latest is American fiction at its finest, a dexterous, astounding achievement.\\" Mark Rahner, in his review for The Seattle Times, stated succinctly, \\"Verdict: so absorbing and satisfying that it's exhausting.\\" He then went on to say: > You could possibly read it as a stand-alone. But why would you want to? And > even having inhaled the previous two like a paint-huffing junkie, I > sometimes felt like I was hanging on by my fingernails to keep everyone and > everything straight in the big cast of characters and sprawling story that > spans Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Chicago, Florida, Haiti and the Dominican > Republic. However, Carlo Wolff, in his review for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, took issue with Ellroy's character development. He stated, \\"... as in the earlier book, Ellroy hasn't lavished enough attention on character, a deficit his stylistic razzle-dazzle can't paper over.\\" He continued, \\"Mastery of the cheap thrill doesn't carry no matter how amusing.\\" Film Adaptation The Mark Gordon Company will produce and finance a film adaptation of Blood's a Rover. Vincent Sieber and Clark Peterson are also producers. Also, a script has been written by Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby The film will be set in 1968 Los Angeles, with characters Dwight Holly, J. Edgar Hoover, Scotty Bennett, and Joan Rosen Klein. References *Ellroy, James (September 2009). Blood's a Rover. Alfred A. Knopf, a division of Random House, Inc. .

It has about 1,600 inhabitants. Jablonec nad Jizerou lies in the surroundings of Giant Mountains, south of the recreation center Rokytnice nad Jizerou. Etymology * Gabella = \\"customs\\" (from Latin) * nad Jizerou = \\"above the Jizera (river)\\" In the base of the name of the river Jizera today we read the ancient Indo-European roots - is-, which has in its name a number of wildly flowing rivers of those countries of Europe where the Celts once lived. Due to its location, there is one more explanation of the name: the word Jablonec could originate from the Latin \\"gabella\\", the customs station.http://www.jablonec-krkonose.cz/o-meste/nazev-mesta Skiareal in Jablonec nad Jizerou History 15th century Jablonec was first documented in 1492. At that time Jablonec was a village. 16th to 19th centuries Under the Thirty Years' War, Jablonec was a small non- agricultural village of thirteen houses, but the significance of the village indicates the existence of the parish church. The Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648) had a catastrophic impact on Jablonec ‚Äì only four houses remained, It took hundred years before Jablonec recovered from the war. But in the second half of the 19th century, Jablonec grew so much that in 1896 Jablonec was given the status of a market town by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. At this time Jablonec was also given the new Coat of arms. Timbered cottage in Jablonec nad Jizerou An already medieval built-up area, which is probably to be found in the vicinity of the St. Procopius Church (originally wooden, from bricks since 1777 thanks to the support of Ernst Adalbert von Harrach) had more diffusive character, also the area from the second half of the 18th century was almost out of order on the slope of the valley. The only organizational factors were contour lines and parcels of land, a completely non-agricultural dwelling were chaotically centered on the link between the church and the mill. Thanks to the large reconstruction of the market town connected with the construction of the railway (1899) and the textile factories along the Jizera, Jablonec nad Jizerou gained the character of a modern mountainous town. 20th and 21st century In 1916 on the request of the market town council, the township name was extended from Jablonec to Jablonec nad Jizerou. In 1930, 1321 inhabitants lived in Jablonec (74% were speaking in Czech language). In 1971 Jablonec nad Jizerou was awarded with the status of town. Today among the new buildings from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries and from the interwar period are sporadically preserved timbered cottages.http://www.jablonec-krkonose.cz/o-meste/historieKarel Kuƒça a Michal L.

Ben Tee ( ) is a Scottish mountain situated in the Lochaber area of the Highland council area, some 15 kilometres north of Spean Bridge. It is rated as one of the best of Scotland's smaller mountains with Hamish Brown saying: Overview Ben Tee forms part of the Loch Lochy hills along with the Munros of Sr√≤n a' Choire Ghairbh and Meall na Teanga which lie to the south west. It has a height of 904 metres (2966 feet) and qualifies as a Corbett and a Marilyn. It is just 10 metres (33 feet) short of being a Munro and it is one of the most recognisable hills in the area with its symmetrical cone making it conspicuous in views for many miles around. The hill lies to the north of Loch Lochy where Glen Garry intersects with the Great Glen. Name The origins of the name Ben Tee is not entirely clear. The most widely accepted translation is \\"Fairy Hill\\" from Gaelic Beinn an t-S√¨thidh. Ben Tee's conical shape is very similar to that of Schiehallion, also a conical \\"fairy hill\\", which gives extra credibility to that translation.\\"Hamish‚Äòs Mountain Walk\\" Page 249 Gives information on translation.\\"The Call of the Corbetts\\" Page 76 Gives information on translation. More fanciful suggestions include a derivation from Beinn an Taighe meaning \\"mountain of the house\\" or Beinn Dh√®, meaning \\"mountain of God\\", a number of years ago leading someone to paint the word GOD on the summit rocks. Local significance An informal local name for Ben Tee is ‚ÄúGlengarry‚Äôs Bowling Green‚Äù,\\"The Call of the Corbetts\\" Page 76 Gives information on ‚ÄúGlengarry‚Äòs Bowling Green. a rather sardonic name because there is hardly any grass on the rocky summit. Local legend says that nearby Invergarry Castle on the northern shores of Loch Oich was built from stone from Ben Tee's summit, with workers passing stone hand to hand down the mountain.\\"Adventure Guide to Scotland\\" Page 373 Gives information on summit stones used to build Invergarry Castle. This story is possibly true as the hill would have great symbolic value to local inhabitants. There is an annual Ben Tee Hill Race, a 14.5 km event starting and finishing at Invergarry shinty club with 900 metres of ascent.Scottish Hill Racing. Gives details of Ben Tee hill race. The winning runner usually takes about 80 minutes to complete the course to the summit and back. Geography Ben Tee is a hill with few outstanding geographical features, it has a broad grassy eastern ridge which sweeps down to the northern end of Loch Lochy and the Laggan lochs and gives one of the most popular approaches to the mountain. The southern slopes of the mountain drop very steeply to the valley of the Allt a‚Äô Choire Ghlais, a stream which drains eastwards entering a steeply wooded gorge where it changes its name to the Kilfinnan Burn. The gorge contains the Kilfillan Falls, a series of waterfalls, as the burn drains to the Great Glen at the north end of Loch Lochy. To the north, the mountain descends to Glen Garry with the trees of the Glengarry forest appearing on the slopes below the 350 metre contour. There are steep slopes to the east which go down to the Bealach Easain, a col with a height of 548 metres which connects to the adjacent Munro of Sr√≤n a' Choire Ghairbh, the col contains a small lochan at its highest point. All drainage from Ben Tee reaches the Great Glen but goes to both the west and east coast of Scotland. Rainfall on the northern part of the hill goes via Glen Garry and the River Garry to reach Loch Oich from where it flows north east through Loch Ness to reach the east coast at the Moray Firth. Rainfall on the southern slopes goes via the Kilfinnan Burn to reach Loch Lochy where it flows south west to reach the sea loch of Loch Linnhe on the west coast. Ascents The most popular ascent of Ben Tee starts at the Laggan locks on the Caledonian Canal at grid reference where there is a car park. The minor road to Kilfinnan on the north side of Loch Lochy is taken and left about 200 metres before the Kilfinnan Burn is reached to strike north west up the steep slopes of Ben Tee. Do not take the path to the Kilfinnan Falls as it is not possible to exit the gorge further up, however the falls are worth visiting but steps will have to be retraced. The route continues across moorland which steepens to reach the broad eastern ridge and then the summit. Approaches are possible from the north and the east, one starts at the bridge over Loch Garry (grid reference ), while another starts at the Forestry Commission's Alt na Cailliche car park near Invergarry (grid reference ). Both these routes are longer than the Kilfinnan approach.\\"The Corbetts and other Scottish Hills\\" Page 143 Gives routes of ascent.

Methods of doing this can include changing the subject, putting off a discussion until later, or simply not bringing up the subject of contention. Conflict prevention can be used as a temporary measure to buy time or as permanent means of disposing of a matter. The latter may be indistinguishable from simple acquiescence to the other party, to the extent that the person avoiding the conflict subordinates their own wishes to the party with whom they have the conflict. However, conflict prevention can also take the form of withdrawing from the relationship. Thus, avoidance scenarios can be either win-lose, lose-lose or possibly even win-win, if terminating the relationship is the best method of solving the problem. The term \\"conflict avoidance\\" is sometimes used to describe conflict prevention. Bacal criticizes this use of terms by asking, Turner and Weed classify concealment as one of the three main types of responses to conflict, describing concealers as those who take no risk and so say nothing, concealing their views and feelings. Concealers are further divided into three types; namely:Conflict in organizations: Practical solutions any manager can use; Turner, Stephen P. (University of South Florida); Weed, Frank; 1983. *Feeling-swallowers who swallow their feelings. They smile even if the situation is causing them pain and distress. They behave thus because they consider the approval of other people important and feel that it would be dangerous to affront them by revealing their true feelings. *Subject-changers who find the real issue too difficult to handle. They change the topic by finding something on which there can be some agreement with the conflicting party. According to Turner and Weed, this response style usually does not solve the problem; instead, it can create problems for the people who use this and for the organization in which such people are working. *Avoiders who go out of their way to avoid conflicts. Controversy The Thomas-Kilmann grid views avoidance as a lose-lose proposition since it does not address the issue at hand. But other sources view avoidance as a useful means of disposing of very minor, non-recurring conflicts whose resolution would expend excessive amounts of time or resources.Timor-Australia Friendship Manual Personality psychology research Research in personality psychology has indicated that the personality trait of agreeableness--one of the five identifiable dimensions of personality--correlates with proclivity toward conflict avoidance. Conflict avoidance in the workplace In the workplace, managers sometimes avoid directly dealing with conflict among co-workers by simply separating them. In workplaces and other situations where continued contact with a person cannot be severed, workers may eschew confrontation as being too risky or uncomfortable, opting instead to avoid directly dealing with the situation by venting to others or engaging in passive aggressive methods of attack such as gossip. Unresolved conflict in the workplace has been linked to miscommunication resulting from confusion or refusal to cooperate, increased stress, reduced creative collaboration and team problem solving, and distrust.Workplace Coach: Companies pay the price when managers avoid dealing with conflict, Maureen, Moriarty, Seattlepi, Oct. 28, 2007.

Constructed at the northwest corner of Hollins and South Poppleton Streets (848 Hollins) and (11-13 South Poppleton), it was often referred to as \\"The Mother Church of West Baltimore.\\" Description The church was built in 1842 to minister to the growing Irish population of old West Baltimore, who had immigrated to the city in vast numbers to work for the B&O; Railroad.Spalding, Thomas W.

Among others, Long also designed the third church for Old St. Paul's (1814-1817) which burned in 1854. and the Franklin Street Presbyterian Church (1847) at Cathedral and West Franklin StreetsDorsey, John & Dilts, James D., Guide to Baltimore Architecture (1997) p. 250. Tidewater Publishers, Centreville, Maryland The design was based on Athens' Temple of Hephaestus.‚ÄúThe Church of St. Peter the Apostle,‚Äù church bulletin, Vertical Files: St. Peter the Apostle, Maryland Room Collection, Enoch Pratt Free Library, Baltimore, MD. The interior of the church features a large, open nave furnished with wooden pews. Behind the altar stood in an apse adorned with white columns, and punctuated with an imposing white marble tabernacle. It contained statues of angels and the holy family, and was topped with a large statue of Saint Peter. The inscription above the tabernacle read, \\"Tu Es Petrus,\\" a reference to the biblical passage, \\"You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church\\" (Matt. 16:18). The church also had a historic tracker organ designed by Henry Niemann. The organ was removed to storage when the building was sold to Carter Memorial Church of God in Christ in 2012. The name of the church was transferred to here upon the closing of the colonial red- brick church, rectory, school and small surrounding cemetery and its subsequent razing in 1841 of the original St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church. This older parish had been founded in 1770 as the first \\"Roman Catholic Congregation of Baltimore Town\\" with new immigrants of Acadians - French Canadians expelled recently from their colony of Acadia, now the British- occupied province of Nova Scotia after the losses by France in North America from the French and Indian War (known in Europe as the Seven Years' War, 1756-1763) who settled along the southwestern shores of \\"The Basin\\" (now Inner Harbor) of the Patapsco River which became known as \\"Frenchtown\\", beyond the intersection of Forest (South Charles) and King George (now West Lombard) Streets. With the joining of some additional Irish settlers, the Roman Catholic population of the new Baltimore Town was growing with the first Mass being said by the Rev. John Ashton from Doughoregan Manor from the Carroll's country estate in the late 1760s to 1770, coming to the town about once a month. The congregation seldom exceeded twenty worshippers and seldom exceeded forty. The original St. Peter's building was the \\"Pro-Cathedral\\" of the Diocese from 1791 to 1821 and the first church used as Roman Catholic Cathedral in the United States. Father John Carroll was named the first bishop for the United States in 1789, installed the following year as Ordinary of the new Diocese of Baltimore, \\"The Premier See.\\" His seat was at old St. Peter's. The older church was located at the northwestern corner of Forest Street (later North Charles) and XXX Lane (later West Saratoga Street), opposite the Old St. Paul's Anglican Parish on the southeastern corner situated above the rugged cliffs to the east overlooking the Jones Falls loop to the northeast around \\"Steiger's Meadow\\", below the new Baltimore County and Town Courthouse (just constructed in the new Courthouse Square at the north edge of the town at Calvert Street between New Church Street (now East Lexington Street) and Fish Lane (now East Fayette Street) a year after when the county seat was re- located here from Old Joppa in 1767. The new path of St. Paul's Lane (later Street/Place) ran north and south just below the heights where the two churches were located. Founded in 1692 as one of the Original Thirty parishes in the Province/Colony of Maryland for the Church of England (Anglican), the Parish Church for the County had been moved shortly after the founding of the new larger town in 1729 on The Basin's headwaters. Its first location was near Colgate Creek on the Patapsco Neck peninsula in southeastern Baltimore County between the Patapsco and the Back River. St. Paul's built the first brick building in town for its worship and took many years to complete until 1739. So it seems an unusual situation of having Catholics and Anglicans facing across from each other for weekly services only forty years after the beginnings of Baltimore and this continued for the next seventy years of its history. In 1821 the bishop's chair was transferred to the new Cathedral. The new cathedral was designed by Benjamin Latrobe and located a block further north on the newly named Cathedral Street and intersecting West Franklin and Mulberry Streets. No longer a pro-Cathedral, Old St. Peter's continued as the downtown community's parish for another twenty years. Gradually the members of the parish began moving northwestward and to the west for other residential areas being constructed as the center became increasingly filled with stores, shops and manufactories. By the early 1840s, the Archdiocese was ready to make a move with a new church building for an old name. The new neighborhood in inner West Baltimore later acquired the name of \\"Union Square\\" for the prominent small landscaped park in its center. This joined a series of other parks and squares such as Arlington and Franklin which dotted the residential landscape of the western side of the burgeoning city as grids of rowhouses were extended north and south as it grew westward. The New Church itself along South Poppleton and Hollins Streets was part of a complex of several buildings, including a church rectory, a convent, and a school. Founded by the Rev. Edward McColgan, who served for over thirty years. The cornerstone for the new church was laid on May 23, 1843, by the Bishop of New York City, the Right Rev. John Hughes assisted by the Right Rev. Kendrick, Bishop of Philadelphia and was dedicated later by Archbishop Samuel Eccleston of Baltimore, and Bishops J. J. Chance, John Hughes and several others on September 22, 1844. Father McColgan was instrumental in having the Sisters of Mercy come to the church later in 1855 to teach at St. Peter School, a female academy adjoining the church and established a handsome residence at neighboring 12 South Poppleton Street. In addition to their educational duties, the Sisters also assisted the poor and sick of the community by opening the \\"House of Mercy for distressed women\\". Father McColgan became the superior of the order in Maryland, was responsible for establishing the first Catholic temperance society in the city in 1849, as he called a mass meeting of meat packers in the western city and encouraged them to \\"take the pledge\\" to abstain from intoxicating drinks which became the nucleus of the St. Peter's Society, the largest Catholic temperance society in Baltimore. Later in 1878, he was appointed vicar-general of the Archdiocese replacing the late Rev. Dubreal. The limits of the parish grew so much in the early years by 1865, that a second church was established (St. Martin's at Fulton Avenue and West Fayette Street) and dedicated in 1867. St. Peter the Apostle was twice enlarged during its first forty years. In the summer of 1868, a thorough renovation was made with several improvements such as the addition of fifty- four pews, the building extended eastwardly, sanctuary rebuilt, gallery reconstructed, stained glass windows installed from Munich, Germany and the ceiling frescoed and ornamented. This phase was rededicated by Archbishop Martin Spalding, April 4, 1869. The dimensions were now 150 feet in length and 73 feet in width, finished in a Corinthian style of architecture although the exterior is with six Doric columns out front.Kujawa, Kathleen. ‚ÄúSt. Peter the Apostle.‚Äù Catholic Review, June 27, 1975. Archbishop James Gibbons consecrated the building on May 1, 1879, assisted by Bishops Thomas A. Becker of Wilmington, Delaware and J. J. Kain of Wheeling, West Virginia. Up to 1881, those who served as assistants at St. Peter's were the Rev. John Hickey, Rev. William D. Parsons, Rev. O'Tool, Rev. Lawrence McCauley, D.D., Rev. John S. Foley D.D., Rev. P. McCoy, Rev. Edmund Didier, Rev. Henry Reardon, and Rev. Gerard H. Nyssen. Assistant pastors were Revs. Owen Corrigan and again Gerard H. Nyssen. A parish cemetery was acquired and was situated on Liberty Road to the northwest.

This attention led to the church being placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 14, 1976. Throughout its history, the congregation of St. Peter the Apostle Church ministered to those in need, and was also active in community organization efforts. In 1965, pastor Thomas J. Donellan formed the Southwest Baltimore Citizens Planning Council, along with four other area churches, to bring identity and renewal to their Hollins Park neighborhood.‚ÄúIn Hollins Park, People Hail From Both Sides of the Track.‚Äù The Baltimore Sun, August 22, 1979. At one time the former convent housed a Christian Life Center, which provided recreation and development programs.‚ÄúParish Profile - IX.‚Äù Catholic Review, October 27, 1978. In later years declining numbers of parishioners and priests limited the number of services that the church held, and the final regularly scheduled Mass was said at St. Peter on Saturday, January 26, 2008. Thereafter the church was only used for weddings, funerals and special occasions. The churches of St. Martin, St. Peter, and St. Jerome merged and formed a new parish known as the Transfiguration Catholic Community. Closing St. Peter's Church was closed after 165 years of service. The church was stripped of everything Catholic, and sold to the Carter Memorial Church of God in Christ 2012. The angels on either side of the Tabernacle were removed and given to St. Ambrose Church. Statues and other relics were removed to other churches in the Archdiocese. The pipe organ, built by Baltimore builder Henry Niemann in 1890 has been placed in storage, pending its location to another church.

It has about 300 inhabitants and it is one of the least populated municipalities with town status in the Czech Republic. Janov is situated in the western part of the Microregion Osobla≈æsko in the Petrovick√Ω stream valley, where the landscape steeply rises up to the ridges of Hrub√Ω Jesen√≠k. History The town was founded in 1251 by Bishop Bruno von Schauenburg and obtained its town rights in 1535 when it was assumed that there are rich deposits of precious metals around the town and its mining will bring prosperity and wealth. Although the assumptions were not met and there are no signs of precious metals mining around Janov, already granted privileges gave the town an urban character featured by a square which has preserved until these days. Geography The town is located deep in the Petrovick√Ω Stream valley where steep mountain ridges with forests and meadows rise up densely riddled with baulks. The natural environment of Janov includes a 500-year-old lime tree situated on the right side of Petrovick√Ω stream. Sights The town has a small square at the town's centre where important monuments may be found, such as the Mining Memorial erected for the 650th anniversary of the town and the baroque statue of the Virgin Mary dated back to 1739. In the western corner of the square there is the Baroque-styled Church of the Holy Trinity built in between 1780 and 1783, with a cemetery located on the grounds. The cemetery includes two artistically valuable chapels built in pseudo-Renaissance and pseudo-Gothic styles. Also of note is the presence of folk architecture in the town, including houses No. 21 and 49. There is also the Museum of Janov and Jind≈ôichov, a small museum which requires visitors make arrangements in advance by telephone, located on the town square which collects valuable geological artifacts about Janov, its history and life at the end of the 19th century.

Parentage He was the son of Henry Villiers-Stuart, 1st and last Baron Stuart de Decies, son of Lord Henry Stuart and his wife, Lady Gertrude Amelia, daughter of George Mason-Villiers, 2nd Earl Grandison.Henry Windsor Villiers- Stuart profile, The Peerage; accessed 8 April 2014.Victim, Beneficiary and Follower of his Father's Legacy ; accessed 8 April 2014. His paternal great- grandfather was John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute, son of Prime Minister John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute. Henry Villiers-Stuart had a younger sister, Pauline, later Lady Wheeler Cuffe (died 5 July 1895).Pauline, Lady Wheeler Cuffe profile, npg.org.uk; accessed 8 April 2014. His mother was Theresia Pauline (n√©e Ott), an Austrian Roman Catholic from Vienna. His parents married on 12 January 1826 in a Roman Catholic service at St James's, Spanish Place, London, and also under Scottish law, but there was uncertainty over whether Theresia was free to marry. As a result of this confusion the younger Henry Villiers- Stuart, after the death of his father in 1874, was unable to establish his claim to the peerage and become the 2nd Baron Stuart de Decies. Theresia's married name became Villiers-Stuart, and, as a result of her marriage, she was styled as Baroness Stuart de Decies on 10 March 1839. She died on 7 August 1867 at Wiesbaden, Hesse, Germany and was interred at Villierstown, County Waterford, Ireland.Profile of Theresia, Baroness Stuart de Decies, The Peerage; accessed 8 April 2014. Career Villiers-Stuart served in the Austrian Imperial Army from 1844‚Äì46. He was in the British Army from 1846-47 as an Ensign in the 20th Regiment of Foot. He afterwards attended University College, Durham and took his BA at Durham University in 1850, graduating with a second-class degree in Classics. In 1849 and still an undergraduate he took his first journey to Egypt, with the intention of visiting sites mentioned in the Bible. 1850‚Äì1885 He was ordained in the Church of England and served as Vicar of Bulkington, Warwickshire from 1852‚Äì55, and of Napton from 1855‚Äì71, when he resigned Holy Orders to pursue a political career and was successfully returned to Parliament for County Waterford in 1873, representing the Liberal Party. His father died the following year and he then resigned his seat so that he could pursue his claim to the barony of Stuart de Decies. However, Stuart-Villiers was unable to satisfactorily claim that his parents were legally married and was not allowed to assume the title. He was again elected to the House of Commons for County Waterford in 1880, a seat he held until 1885. While in parliament he was upfront about the economic difficulties faced by Irish landowners of his class. In 1880, he explained to his colleagues in the House of Commons that he had taken out a loan so he could afford to employ 200 men. Travels and Egyptology Stuart travelled extensively, and published many accounts of his wanderings, notably Adventures amid the Equatorial Forests and Rivers of South America (1891). He was in South America in 1858, in Jamaica in 1881, and he made several journeys through Egypt, and published various works on ancient and modern Egypt. After the British intervention in Egypt concluded with victory at the Battle of Tell El Kebir in 1882 he was sent by the British government to report on the conditions of the people in that country, and produced several books on the topic, including Egypt after the War, which received the special recognition of Lord Dufferin, and his reports were published as a parliamentary blue-book.Villiers-Stuart Collection in University College Cork Library Fund, ucc.ie; accessed 8 April 2014. The Durham University Journal noted in their obituary of Villiers-Stuart that The Funeral Tent of an Egyptian Queen was one of his more popular books. In this book he recalled a journey taken in Egypt in 1879, including a visit to Deir el-Bahari, where he translated some of the hieroglyphics on the tomb of Ramesses I. He also visited a canopy amidst the royal mummeries, recently discovered by Emile Brugsch, that formed the funeral tent of Queen Isi em Kheb, the mother-in-law of Shishak, and inspired the title of the book. He was a member of the Society of Biblical Archaeology. He also joined the Egypt Exploration Fund (EEF) and was concerned about the damage to Egyptian monuments. Like founding member of the EEF Amelia Edwards he noted with alarm how quickly sites were being destroyed. In the winter of 1882 he discovered the alabaster altar and basins in Niuserre's Sun Temple at Abu Ghurab, a discovery that Edwards believed to be very significant. 1885‚Äì1895 He contested East Cork at the 1885 election as an Independent candidate but was unsuccessful, losing out to William John Lane of the Irish Parliamentary Party. Villiers-Stuart was appointed High Sheriff of County Waterford for 1889.Castle and mansion-house of Dromana, County Waterford; accessed 8 April 2014. Personal life Villiers-Stuart married Mary Power, the daughter of Ambrose Power, Archdeacon of Lismore, in 1865. They had five sons and four daughters. He died in October 1895, aged 68, after falling and drowning off Villierstown Quay, near his residence at Dromana, Waterford, having slipped while attempting to enter his boat. His wife survived him by twelve years, dying in September 1907. His youngest son, Patrick Villiers-Stuart, married the author and painter Constance Fielden. Publication * Eve of the Deluge.

Shields's diary, which filled 91 boxes, was longer than those kept by the journalist Edward Robb Ellis (21 million words) and the poet Arthur Crew Inman (17 million words), and 30 times longer than that of Samuel Pepys (1.25 million words).  Contents  Believing that discontinuing his diary would be like \\"turning off my life\\", he spent four hours a day in the office, on his back porch, in his underwear, recording his body temperature, blood pressure, medications, describing his urination and bowel movements, and slept for only two hours at a time so he could describe his dreams. The New York Times summarized the journal as being about anything \\"from changing light bulbs to pondering God to visiting the bathroom\\". He also left behind samples of his nose hair for future study. After his stroke in 1997, Shields tried to continue the diary by having his wife write what he told her to write, but she lacked the compulsion and energy to do so and stopped shortly afterward. Shields's self-described \\"uninhibited\\", \\"spontaneous\\" work was astonishing in its mundaneness, and now fills 91 cartons in the collections of Washington State University, to whom he donated the work in 1999. In a May 2000 interview he said \\"I've written 1200 poems and at least five of 'em are good.\\" He also claimed to have written the story base for Elvis Presley's film Love Me Tender based on the Reno Gang of Seymour, Indiana, where Shields was born. Copies of the manuscript are at the Kansas State Historical Society's E. P. Lamborn collection. Shields based his manuscript on John Reno's 1879 autobiography. The journal for which he became known was not the first he had tried to keep; he had tried to write one at age 17 to chronicle a romantic relationship, but abandoned it after losing interest in the project. Shields died from a heart attack at his home in Dayton, Washington, on October 15, 2007, at the age of 89.

Mongolian manuscript maps usually mapped administrative divisions (leagues, banners or aimags) of Mongolia during the Qing Dynasty. They gave a bird's eye view of the area depicted, making them somewhat similar to pictorial maps. Such manuscript maps have been used for official purposes by the Qing government since the 17th century, and new maps continued to be drawn until at least the 1930s. Although the roots of Mongolian cartography are probably older, the manuscript maps known today were all produced after 1690, when the Lifanyuan in Beijing ordered all Mongolian nobles to produce maps of their territory. Updated maps were to be made every ten years and sent to the Lifanyuan. The maps show major geographic features, and give the positions of those (usually 24 or 48) ovoos that marked the border. The maps normally had Mongolian captions, some were bilingual, others bear small slips of paper with the Chinese translation of the Mongolian names. Walther Heissig, Mongolische Landkarten, in Die Mongolen, Innsbruck/ Frankfurt (Main), 1989, p.268ff Mongolian manuscript maps were first brought to the attention of European scientists by August Strindberg, who in 1878 wrote an article about Dzungarian maps brought to Sweden by Johan Gustaf Renat.Walther Heissig, Die Mongolen.

Illustrations with verse aimed at children, The Brownies was published in magazines and books during the late 19th century and early 20th century. The Brownie characters became famous in their day, and at the peak of their popularity were a pioneering name brand within merchandising.  Characters and story  Brownies are little fairy- or goblin-like creatures who appear at night and make mischief and do helpful tasks. As published by Palmer Cox, they were based on Scottish folktales. Palmer Cox, Brownies at Home - Twelve Vignettes, c. 1893, NGA 56973 Publication history 1895 sheet music. Typically of unauthorized merchandising of the era, the appearance of the Brownies characters is similar to but slightly different from Cox's drawings. The first appearances of Brownie characters in a print publication took place in 1879, but not until the February 1881 issue of Wide Awake magazine were the creatures printed in their final form.The Brownies (1881) at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on February 22, 2018. The first proper story, The Brownies' Ride, appeared in the February 1883 issue of the children's periodical St. Nicholas Magazine. Published in 1899, The Brownies Abroad is considered the first Brownie comic strip, though it was mostly a text comic. It didn't utilise speech balloons until the publication The Brownie Clown of Brownie Town of 1908. From 1903, The Brownies appeared as a newspaper Sunday strip for several years. The first compilation, The Brownies, Their Book, was published in 1887, followed by 16 books in the series until the last in 1918. Palmer Cox died in 1924. Merchandising Beyond print publication, The Brownies was at least twice adapted to stage plays. With the rise in popularity of the Brownie characters, these were used in many venues of merchandising, such as games, blocks, cards, dolls, calendars, advertisements, package labels, mugs, plates, flags, soda pop, a slot machine, a bagatelle game and so forth. George Eastman applied the brand name in promotion of Kodak's \\"Brownie Camera\\", but Palmer Cox reportedly never received any money for the commercial use of his work.

Definition Let {\\\\ }\\\\dot q=f(q,u) be a \\\\ {\\\\mathcal C}^\\\\infty control system, where {\\\\ q} belongs to a finite-dimensional manifold \\\\ M and \\\\ u belongs to a control set \\\\ U. Consider the family {\\\\mathcal F}=\\\\\\\\{f(\\\\cdot,u)\\\\mid u\\\\in U\\\\\\\\} and assume that every vector field in {\\\\mathcal F} is complete. For every f\\\\in {\\\\mathcal F} and every real \\\\ t, denote by \\\\ e^{t f} the flow of \\\\ f at time \\\\ t. The orbit of the control system {\\\\ }\\\\dot q=f(q,u) through a point q_0\\\\in M is the subset {\\\\mathcal O}_{q_0} of \\\\ M defined by :{\\\\mathcal O}_{q_0}=\\\\\\\\{e^{t_k f_k}\\\\circ e^{t_{k-1} f_{k-1}}\\\\circ\\\\cdots\\\\circ e^{t_1 f_1}(q_0)\\\\mid k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N},\\\\ t_1,\\\\dots,t_k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R},\\\\ f_1,\\\\dots,f_k\\\\in{\\\\mathcal F}\\\\\\\\}. ;Remarks The difference between orbits and attainable sets is that, whereas for attainable sets only forward-in-time motions are allowed, both forward and backward motions are permitted for orbits. In particular, if the family {\\\\mathcal F} is symmetric (i.e., f\\\\in {\\\\mathcal F} if and only if -f\\\\in {\\\\mathcal F}), then orbits and attainable sets coincide. The hypothesis that every vector field of {\\\\mathcal F} is complete simplifies the notations but can be dropped. In this case one has to replace flows of vector fields by local versions of them. Orbit theorem (Nagano‚ÄìSussmann) Each orbit {\\\\mathcal O}_{q_0} is an immersed submanifold of \\\\ M. The tangent space to the orbit {\\\\mathcal O}_{q_0} at a point \\\\ q is the linear subspace of \\\\ T_q M spanned by the vectors \\\\ P_* f(q) where \\\\ P_* f denotes the pushforward of \\\\ f by \\\\ P, \\\\ f belongs to {\\\\mathcal F} and \\\\ P is a diffeomorphism of \\\\ M of the form e^{t_k f_k}\\\\circ \\\\cdots\\\\circ e^{t_1 f_1} with k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N},\\\\ t_1,\\\\dots,t_k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R} and f_1,\\\\dots,f_k\\\\in{\\\\mathcal F}. If all the vector fields of the family {\\\\mathcal F} are analytic, then \\\\ T_q{\\\\mathcal O}_{q_0}=\\\\mathrm{Lie}_q\\\\,\\\\mathcal{F} where \\\\mathrm{Lie}_q\\\\,\\\\mathcal{F} is the evaluation at \\\\ q of the Lie algebra generated by {\\\\mathcal F} with respect to the Lie bracket of vector fields.

Plot In a run-down, suburban Bangkok hospital, young Dr. Tar (Wichan Jarujinda) and seven nurses have been running a scheme to sell dead bodies on the black market. However, one nurse, Tahwaan (Chol Wachananont), has found out that her boyfriend, Dr. Tar, has been having an affair with her sister, Nook (Chidjun Rujiphan). Growing tired of the body-selling scam and enraged by her sister and boyfriend's betrayal, Tahwaan threatens to call the police. However, before Tahwaan can take action, the doctor and six resident nurses at the hospital strap Tahwaan to an operating table, kill her, and then wrap her in a black plastic garbage bag. They then dump her in the trunk of the doctor's car, where her corpse will be kept on dry ice until it can be sold. All the women have their own obsessions and weaknesses. The spirit of Tahwaan uses these obsessions to torment and ultimately kill the other six nurses. Scenes shown toward the end of the film indicate that many of these obsessions were in part encouraged by Dr. Tar, or in some cases, used by him to seduce some of the women. For example, Aeh (Kanya Rattanapetch) seems unhealthily attracted to material possession such as jewelry, dresses, and handbags. One brief scene shows Dr. Tar giving Aeh a handbag that was shown sewn to her head and neck earlier in such a manner that when Nook tries to undo the stitching, Aeh is left decapitated. It is eventually revealed that Tahwaan was once a homosexual male who had undergone a sex change so that he could marry Dr. Tar.

The series became very popular, moving onto BBC Radio, international theatre, becoming one of the best-selling audio book releases of all time and included as part of both the A-level and GCSE English syllabus.BBC 7 - Comedy - Talking Heads It was the sixth and final episode of the first series of Talking Heads.  Storyline  \\"A Cream Cracker under the Settee\\" is played out as a monologue by Doris (Thora Hird), a seventy-five-year-old woman who is a widow, following her slip off a pouffe (pronounced 'buffet' in the play). Her disapproval of home-helper Zulema's cleaning leads her to attempt to clean a picture of her and Wilfred, her late husband, and subsequently her fall. Her position, now suffering from a \\"numby\\" leg, prompts her natural desire to find help. Thus she moves from her place on a chair, to the floor near where she fell, and finally to the front door of her house. An exhausted Doris drags herself back to the living room after failing to get help from the front door. Eventually she hears the voice of a policeman, asking if she is all right because - unusually - her lights are off. Instead of asking for his help, she lets him leave, after telling him she was napping. It is assumed by the situation, and by the fact that the conclusions to Bennett's plays are typically bleak, that Doris later dies. Throughout the monologue, she discusses past issues and events in her life, as well as recalling characters and situations. The juxtaposition of humour and sadness is used frequently by Bennett, as it is in many of the Talking Heads monologues to great effect. Such effects include the interaction of passing time. The televised monologue gives the impression of a dark evening as the end of her life is suggested; the passing of time reflecting the passing of her life. Furthermore, the moving from the relatively comfy position of her chair - where she is sitting at the start - possibly indicates the movement from a secure and comfy position in life to her current situation. Issues such as treatment of the aged, growing old and life choices are frequently discussed throughout the monologue. Reception The episode was well received and picked up three nominations at the 1989 BAFTA Awards. Thora Hird won the award for Best Actress ahead of two other actresses from Talking Heads episodes, Patricia Routledge (A Lady of Letters) and Maggie Smith (Bed Among the Lentils). It was also nominated for Best Drama Series and Best Video Lighting.

A beaded mask decorated with soutache. Soutache (, ), also known as Russia braid, is a narrow flat decorative braid, a type of galloon, used in the trimming of drapery or clothing. Soutache is created by weaving a decorative thread around and between two parallel cords and completely covering the cores; this produces a piece of trim with a braided or herringbone pattern. Often woven of metallic bullion thread, silk, or a blend of silk and wool, soutache began to be made of rayon and other synthetic fibers in the 20th century. Soutache is used in passementerie to add decorations to textiles. In clothing soutache is used to conceal seams or add embroidered decorations. Tracing braid is narrow soutache trim used for decorating uniforms. In military uniforms, edgings or loops of soutache in different widths and colors are used to indicate rank, particularly in hats. In athletic uniforms, a contrasting soutache is sometimes used to trim the placket and outline numbers or players' names. The term is also used in bookbinding, where a narrow soutache is applied at the top and bottom of a book back to reinforce the spine and provide a barrier to keep dust out of the binding. Soutache is incorporated into standalone accessories like jewelry, typically with beads.

Douglas Volk and Leonard Wells Volk\\", Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, accessed 4 April 2011 was an American portrait and figure painter, muralist, and educator. He taught at the Cooper Union, the Art Students League of New York, and was one of the founders of the Minneapolis School of Fine Arts. He and his wife Marion established a summer artist colony in western Maine. Early life and education He was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, to Emily Clarissa King (Barlow) Volk and the sculptor Leonard Wells Volk. He was named for his mother's maternal cousin, Stephen A. Douglas, the Democratic Party presidential nominee in 1860, who lost to Republican presidential nominee Abraham Lincoln. Congressman Lincoln posed for a bust by Leonard Volk in early 1860, and the sculptor made plaster casts of his face and hands. Four-year-old Douglas entertained the future president.\\"The Boy who painted Lincoln,\\" Schenectady Gazette, March 3, 1913. Volk spent his childhood in Chicago, but his family moved to Europe when he was fourteen. He began studying art in Rome, and attended the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris (1873 to 1879), where he was a pupil of Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me. At age nineteen, he exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1875.

He returned to the United States, and was hired as an instructor at the Cooper Union in New York City, where he taught from 1879 to 1884 and from 1906 to 1912. He helped to found the Minneapolis School of Fine Arts in 1886, and served as its director until 1893. He taught at the Art Students League of New York (1893 to 1898), the National Academy of Design (1910 to 1917), and intermittently at the Society for Ethical Culture. He was also a working artist, noted for his figure and portrait paintings. He exhibited three works at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, where the group won a medal, his first major award. One of the three, a \\"story picture\\" titled The Puritan Maiden, featured a young woman huddled against a tree in a bleak winter landscape.

In 1881 Volk married the artist Marion Larrabee (1859-1925). She became the first instructor at the Minneapolis School of Fine Arts. Together, they had four children: * Leonard Volk (1882-1891), who died young. * Wendell Volk (1884-1953), a printmaker and woodcarver who married Jessie J.

He died at Fryeburg, Maine on February 7, 1935. Hewnoaks and Sabatos The Volks began spending their summers in Center Lovell, Maine in the 1890s, and in 1904 bought a farmhouse on 25 acres along the shore of Kezar Lake. They renovated the house and added to it, naming it \\"Hewnoaks,\\" and eventually building four additional cottages and an artist's studio for Volk. Numerous artists and craftspeople came to study with them over the years. Many of their friends in the Arts and Crafts Movement were houseguests, including artists J. Alden Weir, Frank Benson, Childe Hassam, and William Merritt Chase; architect John Calvin Stevens, interior designer John Scott Bradstreet, and Swedish-born woodcarver Karl A. von Rydingsv√§rd.\\"Rydingsvard Divorce Case\\", New York Times, 30 September 1897 Von Rydings√§rd carved frames for a number of Volk's paintings, and taught woodcarving to Wendell Volk.\\"Karl von Rydingsgard\\", Art & Decoration, Vol. 5, Artspur Publications, 1914, p. 199. By the turn of the century, Marion Larrabee Volk had begun using traditional area looms to weave textiles and rugs. Rather than cotton, she became known for handwoven woolen work. Her designs were based on motifs from Native American art, and she made her own dyes out of natural materials ‚Äì apple, yellow oak and maple tree bark; goldenrod, barberry, St. John's wort and madder root. In a communal effort with her children and local residents, she produced \\"Sabatos\\" rugs and textiles, named for a nearby mountain. \\"Art Notes\\", New York Times, 7 March 1902, accessed 4 April 2011 Wendell Volk created silkscreen prints for the wool designs, and printed a treatise on the Sabatos work on his hand presses. Sabatos textiles are visible in the background of Douglas Volk's 1914 portrait of his daughter Marion. The Volk family held the large property for 100 years. Jessie McCoig Volk, Wendell's widow, was the last to live there. Following her death in 2004, the property was bequeathed to the University of Maine, and a portion of the family records went to the Smithsonian Institution. University officials arranged for an auction of much of the property's contents and family papers, including art and craftwork by the Volks, and art they had collected. In October 2006, the contents grossed more than $700,000 at auction, drawing especially high prices for two paintings by the illustrator Howard Pyle and photographs of Native Americans by the Norwegian Frederick Monsen (1865‚Äì1929).Mark Sisco, \\"Treasures from Hewnoaks\\" , Maine Antiques Digest, October 2006, accessed 4 April 2011 One item sold at the 2006 auction was Marion Larrabee Volk's first Sabatos rug.Robert Edwards, \\"Sabatos rugs and printed textiles,\\" from American Decorative Art.

Legacy  His students included artists Russell Cowles, Benjamin Orso Eggleston, Susan Ricker Knox, Ada Murphy, Ella Bennett Sherman, Adele Rogers Shrenk, and Helen Maria Turner. He painted at least nine posthumous portraits of Lincoln, basing them on the plaster life-mask that his father had made in 1860. One of them hangs in the Lincoln Bedroom at The White House. Another appeared on a U.S. postage stamp issued in the 1950s, and is now at the National Gallery of Art. His intimate portraits of friends and acquaintances were among his most effective works. These included educator Felix Adler (1914, Metropolitan Museum of Art), art dealer William Macbeth (1917, Brooklyn Museum), and New York governor Alfred E. Smith (1921, New York State Capitol). He was an advocate for teaching drawing and art to children, and published a monograph, Art Instruction in the Public Schools (1894).Douglas Volk, \\"Art Instruction in the Public Schools\\" (part 2), The Art Interchange vol. 35, no. 1 (July 1895), pp. 4-5.

He was on the San Francisco Board of Education from 2001 to 2009, and served as president of the board from 2007 to 2009. Sanchez lost a 2008 election for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in District 9. He was again elected to the San Francisco Board of Education in 2016.https://ballotpedia.org/Mark_Sanchez_(California)#2016 He was elected President of the Board in 2020, having been Vice President since 2018. Biography and political career Mark Sanchez was a long-time teacher in San Francisco. He founded Teachers for Change and Teachers for Social Justice before running for the Board of Education in 2000. In 2000, he became the first Green Party member and the second openly-gay Commissioner on the Board of Education. Sanchez represented the opposition to then-Superintendent Arlene Ackerman. The San Francisco Chronicle blamed Sanchez in part for the tense relationship the Board had with the superintendent: > What (Ackerman) doesn't need is sniping and second-guessing from elected > officials whose job is to set broad policies, not micromanage the > superintendent's daily conduct. Tensions between school board members and > superintendents come with the territory. But in San Francisco, those > tensions had gone far beyond the limits of acceptability. Three board > members in particular--Eric Mar, Sarah Lipson and Mark Sanchez--need to > start working with Ackerman, not fighting with her virtually on a daily > basis.Editors (September 26, 2003) \\"Truce in the Schools.\\" San Francisco > Chronicle. At a September 2003 meeting of the Board of Education, Sanchez was among \\"three board members with whom Ackerman has locked horns said they remain steadfast in their objections to her management of the district, which they characterize as autocratic and unyielding to differing views.\\" Ackerman resigned in 2005. Reported the San Francisco Chronicle, \\"Mayor Newsom said he was saddened but not surprised by Ackerman's resignation considering the ongoing bickering that has gone on between her and a faction of the school board. He said it was a shame to be losing the architect of the improvements within city schools.\\"Knight, Healther (September 7, 2005) \\"Ackerman says she'll quit as schools chief.\\" San Francisco Chronicle. In January, 2007, Mark Sanchez was unanimously elected as the President of the Board of Education. His tenure as President included the hiring of new SFUSD Superintendent Carlos Garcia, the shortening of the Board of Education's regular meetings, the debate over San Francisco's popular JROTC program and a resolution for Lennar Corporation to halt construction in Hunters Point Naval Shipyard because of health concerns. In 2003, commissioners Sanchez and Mar sponsored an anti-war resolution. \\"The original resolution called for promoting a district-wide anti-war rally and creating a curriculum culled from the resources of anti-war groups to be used from kindergarten on up.\\" However, other board members objected to the resolution, calling it one-sided and for taking students out of school to participate in the rally. \\"The proposal failed but a watered-down version that passed the board called for a day of on-campus public discussion about the possibility of a war in Iraq.\\".Knight, Heather (September 25, 2003) \\"Schools chief in S.F. hints at quitting.\\" San Francisco Chronicle. JROTC controversy In 2006, the Board of Education voted to eliminate its Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps program as an anti-war statement. Commissioners Sanchez, Mar, Kelly, and Lipson voted to eliminate the program, with Commissioners Jill Wynns and Norman Yee voting for keeping the 120-year- old program. Commissioner Eddie Chin was absent. \\"Opponents said the armed forces should have no place in public schools, and the military's discriminatory stance on gays makes the presence of JROTC unacceptable.\\" One supporter of the program argued that the program is the only place the kids feel safe. AsianWeek magazine criticized the schoolboard for closing down the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps in San Francisco high schools: \\"Supporters of JROTC acknowledge problems with the U.S. military and gays, but say Mar and (Norman) Yee are discounting the tremendous benefit JROTC has provided to minorities and low-income students.\\"Staff Report (November 10, 2006) \\"End of the JROTC?\\" AsianWeek. In December 2007, during Sanchez' presidency, the Board voted 5-2 to postpone the elimination of JROTC because a replacement program had not been created. S√°nchez and Mar were the only commissioners to vote for immediate elimination. In June, 2008 the board discontinued the awarding of physical education credit due to the threat of a lawsuit. In 2008, San Francisco voters overruled the Board of Education and passed Proposition V, which urged the San Francisco Board of Education to reverse its elimination of the JROTC program. The proposition passed 55 to 45 percent. Campaign for Supervisor In 2008, Sanchez ran for supervisor in District 9. He received the endorsement of the San Francisco Chronicle. He lost the race with only 29 percent of the vote. Principal of Horace Mann Middle School In 2009, the San Francisco school board waived its own rules and offered Sanchez a one-year interim position as principal of Horace Mann Middle School.Tucker, Jill (May 14, 2009) \\"S.F. school board hires Sanchez as principal.\\" San Francisco Chronicle. (Retrieved 11-7-2011.) In order to give Sanchez the position, board members suspended a 30-year-old policy that prohibited the district from hiring or contracting with former board members within two years of the end of their term.Tucker, Jill (May 12, 2009) \\"School board mulls suspending rule for Sanchez.\\" San Francisco Chronicle. (Retrieved 11-7-2011.) In March 2010, Horace Mann Middle School was put on California's 5 percent lowest-achieving schools list. Schools on the list were required to be closed, converted to charter schools, or subjected to a complete staff overhaul, including the principal. However, Sanchez was not replaced because regulations allow schools to keep principals who have been on the job two years or less.Tucker, Jill (March 9, 2010) \\"Tough choices for 12 S.F. schools in bottom 5%.\\" San Francisco Chronicle. (Retrieved 11-7-2011.) In July 2010, Horace Mann Middle School appeared on the state Board of Education's list of 1,000 schools deemed so bad that parents have the right to transfer their children to a better school in their district or any other district.Tucker, Jill (July 16, 2010) \\".\\" San Francisco Chronicle.

LaPolla (2003) suggests that similarities between Gyalrongic and Qiangic may be due to areal influence, while other recent work suggests that Qiangic as a whole may in fact be paraphyletic, with the only commonalities of the supposed \\"branch\\" being shared archaisms and areal features that were encouraged by contact. Geographical distribution The Gyalrongic languages are spoken in Sichuan in China, mainly in the autonomous Tibetan and Qiang prefectures of Karmdzes and Rngaba. These languages are distinguished by their conservative morphology and their phonological archaisms, which make them valuable for historical linguistics. Gyalrongic languages are spoken predominantly in the four counties of Ma'erkang, Li, Xiaojin, and Jinchuan in Aba Prefecture, western Sichuan.Nagano, Yasuhiko and Marielle Prins. 2013. rGyalrongic languages database. Osaka: National Museum of Ethnology (Minpaku). Other Gyalrongic lects are spoken in neighboring Heishui, Rangtang, Baoxing, Danba, and Daofu counties. Classification The Gyalrongic languages share several features, notably in verbal morphology, and are classified into three groups: *Khroskyabs (formerly known as Lavrung) *the Horpa language *the Gyalrong languages The Gyalrong languages in turn constitute four mutually unintelligible varieties: Eastern Gyalrong or Situ, Japhug, Tshobdun, and Zbu. Khroskyabs and Horpa are classified by Lin (1993) as a \\"western dialect\\" of Gyalrong, along with Eastern Gyalrong and the \\"northwestern dialect\\" (Japhug, Tshobdun, and Zbu). Otherwise, the scholarly consensus deems the distance between Khroskyabs, Horpa, and the Gyalrong cluster is greater than that between the Gyalrong languages. For example, Ethnologue reports 75% lexical similarity between Situ and Japhug, 60% between Japhug and Tshobdun, but only 13% between Situ and Horpa. Huang (2007:180)Huang Bufan. 2007.

Original reports suggested that Sch√∂lermann will return to filming in early 2013. But it was since announced that the actor wouldn't return full-time, but in a limited capacity. He returned filming in June 2013, with his onscreen return planned for September. Storyline Christian is the younger brother of Gregor Mann (Andreas Jancke). During his childhood he had to cope with his mother's suicide and his father's gambling addiction. He was convicted when he took the blame for a crime committed by his father, Wolfgang (J√ºrgen Haug), knowing his father wouldn't be able to endure prison with a weak heart. While Christian served his father's sentence, his father died and it is revealed he was \\"in handcuffs\\" while visiting his father's grave. After being released, Christian moved to D√ºsseldorf with Gregor. He goes to prison again because of being falsely accused for assaulting Nico's boss. He starts dating Nico von Lahnstein (Verena Zimmermann), but breaks up with her and starts a relationship with Coco Faber (Mariangela Scelsi), when he discovers Nico made Coco write love letters to him and sign them as Nico, during the time he was in prison. Later, he meets Olivia's cousin and Charlie (Gabriele Metzger) and Lars' nephew Oliver Sabel (Jo Weil), who later shares the apartment with Lars, Christian and Coco. When he learns about Olli's sexuality, he is not comfortable sharing the flat with him but later apologises realising his mistake. Christian begins to have relationship problems with Coco, resulting in her falling in love and sharing a kiss with Oliver, which they decide to keep it as a secret from Christian. as that meant nothing to both of them. However at the same time, Oliver begins to develop feelings for Christian, which are cemented during a camping trip and realizes that he has fallen in love with him. When Christian finds out about Coco's kiss with Oliver, he confronts Oliver and accuses him of pretending to be gay in order to get his girlfriend. At the boxing club later on, Oliver goes to him to clear the misunderstanding but ends up kissing him. Christian shoves him away, stating that he is straight. Oliver sends a sports college application for Christian against his will which makes him angry and confused. Christian starts dreaming and fantasizing about Olli's kiss and becomes confused about his sexuality. He ends up breaking up with Coco as a result. After he admits his confusion to Coco, she leaves for Goa, India taking their dog Pepper with her. He talks about his confused feelings with another man on an anonymous chat room. But when he discovers that the man is Oliver (who was unaware that he was chatting with Christian) the confrontation that ensues brings all their feelings to the front and results in Oliver and Christian having sex for the first time. Afterwards, Christian tells Oliver this first experiment convinced him that he is not gay. Despite this, Christian still thinks about Oliver more and more often and becomes further confused about his feelings and sexuality. Later, his track entrance trial at the sports college doesn't go well, having two false starts, until Oliver shows up to support him which results in him passing with flying colors. On a date with co-worker and friend Miriam Christian feels jealous when he see Oliver dancing with another guy and starts a fight with him. Oliver manages to stop the fight and accuses Christian of being jealous, and follows him upstairs locked in his room. After Oliver stays at Christian's locked door all night, they both confess their mutual feelings and Christian lets Oliver into his room and they make love, finally becoming a couple. They try to hide their relationship from other friends, but it is later discovered by Judith, their flatmate, and Olivia. To Christian and Oliver's surprise, the friends who discovered their relationship are fine with it and promise to keep it a secret. In the meantime, Christian gets a boxing contract. He fires his first manager, a homophobic man, and hires Gregor, who turns out to be supportive when he discovers Christian in bed with Oliver, but he has to keep his relationship with Oliver hidden due to homophobia in the boxing scene, even though he wishes to come out no longer ashamed of his sexuality. Oliver, desperate for Christian's success, even goes as far as convincing Christian to pretend to date Judith as a beard. Christian wins his first fight and then comes out by publicly kissing Oliver in the ring, making himself known as \\"The Gay Boxer\\". However, Axel, the boxer defeated by Christian and who had before mocked Christian for suspecting he was in a gay relationship, attacks Oliver when he finds him alone in No Limits. The charges against Axel are dropped due to lack of evidence. Despite an apparent successful recovery, Oliver develops an aneurysm that puts his life at danger as a result of the attack, and most of Christian partners become supportive of them, and the lesion gives the police enough evidence to arrest Axel. However, some time after this, Christian collapses while in the shower and is discovered by a horrified Oliver who takes him to the hospital. Despite insisting his collapse was a minor thing, it is confirmed that he suffers from a bacterial infection which has spread to his heart muscle called myocarditis, a result of a common cold not healing properly, which impairs him from doing any kind of professional sport. This abrupt change of life causes a short downward spin for Christian, having to give up his passion for boxing, but soon learns to change his life around until his infection heals. After a short time working as a park and forest administrator at the K√∂nigsbrunn Castle, Stella Mann notices that he has a gift for taming horses, and he starts training at K√∂ningsbrunn as a professional Horse Trainer. Christian and Oliver's first relationship trouble is caused by Rob, a party planner who is interested in seducing Oliver, and catches his attention by proposing business deals, while secretly attempting to use Oliver's bar No Limits as a base for drug dealing. Oliver perceives the suspicions of Christian as mere jealousy, and their relationship is further strained when Oliver begins to suspect Christian to becoming attracted towards women again, this being fueled when Christian shares a drunken kiss with Miriam during a party and when Rebecca von Lahnstein develops feelings for Christian and kisses him. Oliver soon bluntly asks him if he's into women again and Christian admits he's not sure, causing them to consider if their relationship is worth trying for. However, after considering all the trials they had gone through together, the two decide to start fresh. In the end, Christian and Oliver reconcile thanks to a romantic trip to New York, and Rebecca manages to expose Rob as drug dealer to the police, who is imprisoned. Christian, soon after their trip to New York, suffers an episode of chest pain and is taken to the hospital by Andi. However, Oliver is not allowed to know any details about him once at the hospital as he's not a relative of Christian, much to his and Christian's annoyance. When Christian goes to Sebastian von Lahnstein in order to file documents to fix any future health concerns for them hospital-wise, he suggests he and Oliver marry to avoid these limitations. Christian is wary of marriage and says he and Oliver are fine with where they are in their relationship. Miriam also suggests the same thing to Oliver, who responds with excitement to propose to Christian and begins making plans to do just so. When Oliver proposes to Christian later on in No Limits, decorating it with Valentine's Day decorations, Christian is clearly shocked. Despite his earlier comments about not being ready for marriage, he says yes to Oliver's proposal. Despite some conflict about how the wedding should be, Christian wanting a small and private wedding whereas Oliver wants a big and grande wedding party, they finally marry, and consider adopting a child. After learning that adoption takes up to several years for gay couples, they make an attempt to get known with a lesbian couple, in order to try for in vitro fertilization. However, the couple demands Christian and Oliver to sign a contract, planning for their future activities and decisions to ensure they will always be close to the child. Christian and Oliver, unwilling to commit to a rigid and tight plan, break up the agreement. Later they start acting as foster parents for Lilly, daughter of a Cameroonian man, during the time he is in prison, and while he looks for a job after his release. Oliver wants to foster another child soon after Lily's parting from their life, but Christian is unable to do this so soon after Lily's departure and still in pain from her leaving. This causing a strain on their relationship. However, Oliver soon realizes that he is willing to be with Christian despite being unable to have a family with him and makes up with him. Their relationship takes a severe downward turn when Christian and Andi Fritzsche wake up after a party with Jessica Stiehl, who claims both of them had sex with her. This fuels Oliver's fear that Christian might leave him for a woman, and he asks Christian to move out. Christian lives at the stud farm in K√∂nigsbr√ºnn for a while, until a fire destroys all his possessions, forcing him to move with Oliver's aunt Charlie, right in front of the apartment in which Oliver lives. The couple drifts even more apart after Oliver witnesses Phillip zu Hohenfelden being hit by a car and thinks himself responsible, falling into depression. Christian starts an affair with Theresa Erzberger, a coworker at the stud farm, but breaks up with her when Theresa sabotages the training of Dana Wolf. Oliver attempts a relationship with Rafael Velasquez, whom he had met at vacations on Ibiza, and both agree to dissolve their marriage. Distressed from Oliver's official departure from his life, Christian seeks for relief by returning to his box training club and accepts a challenge by a friend of Axel's, intending to get revenge for what Axel did to Oliver awhile back. The fight triggers his heart condition and results in a heart attack, which Olli ends up witnessing, sending him to the hospital. The fear of truly losing Christian causes Oliver to realize that he still loves him despite all the trouble the two have gone through together and break up with Rafael, reconciling with Christian and restarting their relationship. The heart episode severely impairs Christian, since any activity or situation that rises his heart rate would endanger his life. On 3 January 2012 Oliver and Christian got married for a second time in the cabin outside which they first fell in love back in 2008. In late 2012, Christian is invited to work in the United Kingdom for several months with a worldwide renowned horse trainer. He and Oliver temporarily depart with a sweet moment and a kiss as Christian leaves. In late 2013, Christian returns to the show, being seen walking through the street with his bags. During this, he gets a phone call which he tells the caller to stop calling him. Later, he hides in Oliver's room in the apartment where he pretends to be an intruder and handcuffs Oliver to a chair before revealing himself and putting on a strip show for him, reuniting the two. The two spend days happy together, but eventually get into an argument over whether or not Christian wants to continue traveling and working, thus spending months apart from each other again. During their fight, Christian leaves to walk throughout the city and, as he is distracted, gets his jacket is stolen from a running thief. Christian is unable to chase after him when he trips. As a result of the robbery, the thief is eventually in an accident which required surgery and is accidentally mistaken as Christian; scaring Oliver when he is called to be told about \\"Christian\\" being in the hospital. In shock, he wanders throughout the city and meets a friend who invites him under his roof to get out of the pouring rain. Oliver accepts and sits, fearing for \\"Christian\\". However, moments later, Christian comes into the room, revealing the big misunderstanding. The eventually make up, and Christian even says he wants to travel with him when they can when Oliver lets Christian take another year working. Once again, the two are happy once again and spend most of their time having sex together until Christian has to leave once again for his work. However, Christian still keeps getting regular phone calls from someone whom he keeps firmly saying to stop calling him. Soon enough, Christian goes into the bathroom after a day in bed with Oliver to phone this mystery person back, talking in English. He tells the person to not call him again. As he goes on, Jessica walks in just in time to hear Christian say to the person, \\"We had sex. Once. And that's the end of the story. It happened because I was drunk!\\" After insisting that he was happily married, he ends the call and sees Jessica standing in the room. He initially hopes she didn't understand since he was speaking in English, but Jessica says that she understands \\"We had sex\\" very well in English. When she scolds him for sleeping with a man while drunk, Christian reveals to her that the person he slept with was actually a woman. Christian details how throughout the year he spent without Oliver, he had gotten lonely and went to a bar for a few drinks. He eventually got drunk and doesn't remember anything that had happened afterward, but woke up in bed with a woman. Jessica says that he can't tell Oliver, reminding him of what happened after their night together and the disastrous effect it had on him and Oliver. Dana walks in to get diapers for Max and Jessica immediately tells her of Christian's one night stand and that Christian can never tell Oliver. Dana is offended, believing it to be the right thing to do and how she (Jessica) had Hagan lie to her for weeks about cheating on her, but Jessica insisted it was different with Christian and that telling the truth would ruin the relationship on account of Christian's past. However, Dana firmly believes that Oliver deserves the truth. Later, Christian is struck with immense guilt and eventually confesses his one night stand to Oliver. When Christian also reveals it was once again with a woman, Oliver points out how every time he has cheated on him it was with a woman, never a man, and that this must mean that he wants something that he (Oliver) can never give him. Oliver leaves in a huff to think and cry over Christian's incapability of being faithful to him. Dana eventually comes in to talk with Christian, and he tells her how he couldn't bear lying to Oliver any longer and had to tell him the truth, even if it meant potentially ruining everything they have together. He brings up how the worst part is that it is the same exact issue as it was in the past; him getting drunk and winding up in bed with a woman. He expresses his fear that Oliver will want to end their marriage together once again and Dana tries to assure him that they worked everything else like last time, but Christian says he promised back then that he would never cheat again. He insists that he loves Oliver, but hates how he still hurts him despite his love for him. Dana says she simply hopes Oliver will forgive him. Some time later, Oliver returns home. He says he thought about how he wants their marriage to be, and doesn't want it like the way it currently is. He directly says that Christian can't be faithful, doesn't want any commitments and wants to sleep with whomever he wants. Christian is left confused, until Oliver declares he doesn't want to break up - he wants an open marriage. As he walks off, Christian is left shell shocked. After this, Christian proposes to stay in Germany in order to regain Oliver's trust since he feels that Oliver does truly want an open marriage, fuming to Jessica later about the many former boyfriends he fears Oliver is going to be with, and is being stubborn. He continues to make many efforts to speak with Oliver, constantly apologizing, but Oliver rejects his offer and his many attempts to make amends. Believing things to be over, Christian books his ticket for Britain. However, hours before the flight, Jessica locks Christian and Oliver in their room together in an effort to force them to talk things through. During this time period, Christian once again declares his love for Oliver and convinces him that he is sincerely repentant over his infidelity. Oliver, still heartbroken, asks from him to give him all the details of his fling in Britain, believing it will help him to forgive him. Christian reiterates his love for Oliver, saying nothing will ever compare to being with him because his love belongs to him, and they eventually kiss and have makeup sex. Afterwards, Christian asks Oliver to come with him in Britain for a while. Oliver accepts his offer, believing that their stay in Britain together will help improve their relationship. Oliver returns to D√ºsseldorf and visits Christian in Britain a few times. Despite Christian promising Oliver they will manage the distance between them, they grow apart. Oliver develops feelings for his roommate Sascha, which aren't mutual. Feeling guilty, Oliver books a flight to England to be with Christian, who isn't happy with Oliver coming over randomly as he is very busy with work. While on the phone with him, Oliver accuses Christian of not being keen to see him at all and flies to Britain anyway. Later, when Christian fails to come to D√ºsseldorf as planned, ruining Oliver's surprise party, Oliver has a one-night stand with a patron at NoLimits. Jessica tries to convince Oliver not to tell Christian as Christian has already cheated on Olli twice before. Oliver calls Christian and says there's something seriously wrong with their marriage. Christian immediately guesses Oliver had a one-night stand and Oliver confesses. Angry, Christian orders Oliver to fly to Britain immediately. When Oliver returns to D√ºsseldorf, he announces their divorce, this time for good. In June 2014, Oliver receives the divorce papers from Christian's lawyers. He signs them, takes off his ring and toasts to new beginnings. This is the end of Chrolli.

It was composed collaboratively by Liu Tieshan (ÂàòÈìÅÂ±±) and Mao Yuan (ËåÖÊ≤Ö) in 1952, inspired by the long drum dance (Áë∂ÊóèÈïøÈºìËàûÊ≠å), a form of traditional festival music of the Yao people of southern and southwest China. It was premiered in Beijing in 1953. History Inspired by the folk songs of Yao people, Liu Tieshan composed Long Drum Dance of the Yao People during a visit to Youling village (Ê≤πÂ≤≠Êùë), Sanpai town (‰∏âÊéíÈïá), Liannan Yao Autonomous County (ËøûÂçóÁë∂ÊóèËá™Ê≤ªÂéø), Qingyuan (Ê∏ÖËøúÂ∏Ç), northern Guangdong province, southern China in 1951. Mao Yuan, another composer, adapted this piece into an orchestral work in 1952. Although it was originally composed for Western instruments, it is generally performed by Chinese traditional instruments (either for solo guzheng,video chamber ensemble, or orchestral).video It is also performed by ensembles or orchestras of Western instruments.video The work achieved wide attention in 1954, when the arrangement for Chinese orchestra by the conductor Peng Xiuwen was disseminated throughout China. Other arrangements have been made by the Taiwanese composers Cheng Si-sum (ÈÑ≠ÊÄùÊ£Æ) and Chen Tscheng-hsiung (Èô≥ÊæÑÈõÑ). Musically, the work is in several sections, some slow and some fast. It begins in 2/4 meter at a slow tempo, moves to 3/4 meter, then returns to 2/4 meter in a faster tempo for the finale. In the late 20th century, the song was used as the basis for several pop songs, in both China and the United States.

It occupies the upper slopes of coastal Mount Cameroon in Cameroon, and the mountains of nearby Bioko island in Equatorial Guinea.  Geography  The ecoregion includes the distinct montane forests on the higher elevations of two volcanic peaks, Mount Cameroon, which lies in Cameroon near the coast, and Bioko, a volcanic island to the southwest in Equatorial Guinea. The montane forests occur as low as 500 meters elevation on Mount Cameroon. They also occur above 1500 meters elevation on three peaks on Bioko, Pico Basil√© (3,011 meters elevation), Gran Caldera de Luba (2,261 m), and Pico Biao (2,009 m). The montane forests are surrounded at lower elevations by the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests ecoregion. Both Bioko and Mount Cameroon are part of the Cameroon Volcanic Line, a line of volcanoes that runs northeast-southwest across the Cameroon Highlands and extending into the Atlantic Ocean as the islands of Bioko, S√£o Tom√©, Pr√≠ncipe, and Annobon. At over 4,000m Mount Cameroon is the highest peak in western Africa, and is still an active volcano. Climate The southwestern slopes of these mountains have a wet climate all-year round.  Flora  The montane forests of Mount Cameroon and Bioko are home to the distinct Afromontane flora of Africa's high mountains. The chief plant communities are montane forests, montane grasslands, and heathlands. At least 42 plant species are strictly endemic and another 50 near-endemic to Mount Cameroon.  Fauna  370 species of birds have been recorded on Mount Cameroon, including some endemics. There is less variety of mammals, and most larger mammals have disappeared, but there are some endemics such as the Cameroon soft-furred mouse (Praomys morio), and a greater variety of reptiles and amphibians including the endemic toad Werneria preussi.  Conservation and threats  The forest of Mount Cameroon is threatened, especially at lower elevations, by conversion to agriculture and logging. Protected areas A 2017 assessment found that 736 km¬≤, or 64%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Only 5% of the unprotected area is still forested.Eric Dinerstein, David Olson, et al. (2017). An Ecoregion-Based Approach to Protecting Half the Terrestrial Realm, BioScience, Volume 67, Issue 6, June 2017, Pages 534‚Äì545; Supplemental material 2 table S1b. Protected areas include Mount Cameroon National Park on Mount Cameroon, and Pico Basil√© National Park and Luba Crater Scientific Reserve on Bioko.

Early life and education Palmer was born in Portsmouth, England and has always remained in the Portsmouth area. From 1945 to 1949 he was educated at St. John's College, Southsea, followed by a National Diploma of Design in painting and engraving from the Portsmouth College of Art and Design. Studying postgraduate courses at the Royal Academy, London, between 1955 and 1959, he was awarded David Murray Landscape Scholarships in 1955, 1956 and 1957, the Leverhulme Scholarship in 1957, and the Royal Academy Gold Medal and the Edward Scott Travelling Scholarship in 1958. Artist career While still at the RA, Palmer began teaching part-time at Winchester School of Art, where he became a full-time tutor in 1962, and in 1966, the head of the Foundation Department. In 1967, he received his first commission, from the Folio Society, to illustrate Three Stories by Herman Melville, which included Palmer's first full-page illustration to Benito Cereno of the head of Babo, the rebellious slave, on a pike in the market square. The Society commissioned him again in 1971 for The Destruction of the Jews, by Josephus, and in 1974 for Moby Dick, by Melville. Similarly the short-lived Imprint Society in Barre, Massachusetts, commissioned Palmer to illustrate H. M. Tomlinson's The Sea and The Jungle in 1971 and Benito Cereno, by Melville, in 1972. The motif of the head of Babo on a pole returned, reflecting changes in Palmer's artistic style. Palmer also illustrated Ship of Sounds, The Gruffyground Press, 1981 (130 copies), a poem by John Fuller. He retired from Winchester School of Art in December 1986, thereafter devoting himself full-time to his art. The Old Stile Press, in Llandogo, persuaded Palmer to return to his boxwood blocks to illustrate The Ballad of Reading Gaol, by Oscar Wilde, in 1994 (225 copies). In February of the same year, Palmer took part in a major examination of art created for Coleridge's Poem, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. \\"The Mariner Imagined, Coleridge's Poem and the Artist, 1831-1994\\", held at Lauderdale House, Highgate Hill, London, also featured works by David Scott, Joseph Noel Paton, Gustave Dore, Willy Pogany, David Jones, Duncan Grant, Mervyn Peake and Patrick Procktor. The following November his work was shown in an \\"Exhibition of Wood Engravings used as Book Illustrations\\", at Oxford University Club, Halifax House, Oxford. His next participation was in the \\"Society of Wood Engravers Touring Exhibition\\", April 1995 - January 1996; An exhibition at Garden Gallery, Pallant House, Chichester, West Sussex, to mark the forthcoming publication of \\"LAND\\", by the Old Stile Press, Llandogo, December 1995 (240 copies), featured landscape wood engraving in Palmer's \\"instantly recognizable style\\"Garrick Palmer and text by Eric Williams and soon sold out. Palmer featured in further exhibitions at the \\"LINE\\" Gallery, Linlithgow, Scotland in January 1996, and Twentieth Century Word Engineering, Exeter City Museums and Art Gallery, February 1997. In November 2012, the Society of Wood Engravers awarded its 75th Anniversary Prize to Palmer for his chef d'oeuvre, \\"Circular Forms\\", which exists in several editions. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers (retired), the Society of Wood Engravers associate of the Royal Engravers, the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers (retired), and the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers (retired). Photography career Since the early 1980s he has had a second career as a photographer. Beginning in 1983, he has had numerous commissions and exhibitions, including: an exhibition of Orkney & Shetland in The Winchester Gallery, 1983; a grant from Southern Arts for a Portsmouth project in 1985; and a commission to produce photographs of sculptures in Hampshire for the newly formed Hampshire Sculpture Trust in January 1987, followed by its opening exhibition in May 1987 and an exhibition of the prints at the Winchester Gallery in July 1987. In November 1987, the City of Portsmouth Museum and Art Gallery held an exhibition of his photographs, entitled \\"Portsmouth, A Personal Reflection\\", which moved to the Havant Museum and Gallery in July 1988. October 1990 saw an \\"Exhibition of Architectural Photographs\\" at the Spitfield Gallery, London. Palmer participated in \\"A Southern Eye\\" - Six Photographers, at the Winchester Contemporary Art Gallery in September 1996. In April, 1997 he exhibited photographs of contemporary sculpture at the New Art Centre, Roche Court. Hampshire County Council awarded Palmer a three-year grant in 1997 to photograph \\"Early Churches in Hampshire\\", a selection of photographs being shown at Winchester Cathedral in 1999. Other exhibitions include: photographs of historic churches and landscapes around the area of Butser shown at the Queen Elizabeth Country Park Centre in August and September, 2001; \\"Photographs of Sculpture\\" at the Hampshire Sculpture Trust Gallery in Winchester, November‚ÄìDecember 2002; \\"FOREST\\", an exhibition at the Winchester Gallery plus a Southern Arts Touring Exhibition 2002‚Äì2003; photographs at the Queen Elizabeth Country Park Centre in 2004. In February‚ÄìMarch 2006, Palmer's show of church interiors, \\"Places of Worship\\", was held at Portsmouth Cathedral; in October‚ÄìNovember 2006 \\"At Any Time\\" was shown at the Winchester Gallery. In 2001 Palmer was commissioned to document the demolition of the site next to Pallant House and the building of the New Pallant House Gallery in Chichester, a project that he worked on until 2006. He has since photographed works by the young New Zealand artist Makoure Scott for Twenty-First Century Works, a limited edition publication, (Paul Holberton, 2006).

Officially announced on June 1, 2009, the game is the second main installment of the Crysis series, and a sequel to the 2007 video game Crysis, and its expansion Crysis Warhead. The story was written by Richard Morgan, while Peter Watts was consulted and wrote a novel adaptation of the game. It was the first game to showcase the CryEngine 3 game engine and the first game using the engine to be released on consoles. A sequel, Crysis 3, was released in 2013. Gameplay Crysis 2 is a first-person shooter. The player assumes the role of a Force Recon Marine called Alcatraz. Similar to its predecessor, it provides freedom to customize weaponry and abilities. Crytek wanted to avoid making another game set in a true jungle environment (as were Far Cry and Crysis); New York City has been dubbed an \\"urban jungle\\". The urban atmosphere offers new options with relation to progressing and planning attacks. Players are able to navigate between floors and buildings, as well as a destroyed cityscape. Campaign The player assumes the control of a Force Recon Marine named \\"Alcatraz\\", who gains ownership of the Nanosuit 2.0 from Army Delta Force officer Laurence \\"Prophet\\" Barnes, who returns from the original Crysis. CryNet Systems has been hunting Prophet to retrieve the suit, inadvertently pursuing Alcatraz, believing he is Prophet. The aliens seen in the original game have undergone a major redesigning, abandoning the ancient, tentacled exosuits seen in the first game for high-tech humanoid armored war machines that stalk Alcatraz through the ravaged New York City. Crytek stated prior to release that their intention was to surpass the original game graphically and gameplay-wise while also having lower system requirements and also supporting true stereoscopic 3D. The new Nanosuit supports new and upgraded features. Suit functionality has been streamlined; multiple modes can easily be used simultaneously whenever the user wishes. The first suit's Strength and Speed Modes have been combined into the new Power Mode, the suit binoculars function has been upgraded with an advanced Tactical mode, the Cloaking Device has been modified to allow increased sensory input and silent melee stealth kills and has been renamed to Stealth Mode, while the Armor Mode has been left more or less as is, with the exception of slightly restricted agility and an ever- decreasing energy level. There are two trailers, with one trailer showing the suit in a wire-frame state, the other showing the suit in a complete state. In-fiction, the suit is to feature many improvements over its predecessor, giving soldiers freedom to upgrade their suits based on their own style of combat. Synopsis Characters and setting Crysis 2 takes place in 2023, three years after the events of the first game, in a destroyed New York City which has since been evacuated due to alien infestation. The game begins with news footage of a large outbreak of the \\"Manhattan\\" virus, a gruesome disease that causes complete cellular breakdown; civil unrest; and panic about an alien invasion by the Ceph, the tentacled, squid-like alien race behind the incident of the previous game, Crysis. Due to the breakdown in social order within New York City, Manhattan is placed under martial law, and under contract from the US Department of Defense, soldiers from Crynet Enforcement & Local Logistics (or simply \\"CELL\\"), a private military contractor run by the Crynet corporation, police the chaos. Plot On August 23, 2023, a United States Marine Corps Force Recon unit is deployed into New York City to extract former Crynet employee Doctor Nathan Gould, who may have vital information on combating the Ceph, the alien race that is trying to destroy humanity. However, the Ceph sink the sub, mortally wounding Force Recon Marine \\"Alcatraz.\\" Delta Force Major Laurence \\"Prophet\\" Barnes saves Alcatraz and kills himself to allow his Nanosuit to assimilate and revive Alcatraz. In a recording, Prophet reveals that he had been infected by the Manhattan virus, and asks Alcatraz to continue his work against the Ceph. Believing Alcatraz is Prophet, Gould contacts Alcatraz and asks him to meet up at Gould's lab. CELL forces, led by Commander Dominic Lockhart, attack Alcatraz, believing him to be Prophet. On his way to Gould's laboratory, Alcatraz collects tissue samples from the Ceph, which cause strange reactions within his Nanosuit. Alcatraz meets with Gould, who becomes aware of Prophet's death, and explains that the suit has been rewriting its own code after absorbing the Ceph's tissue. He speculates that the suit is creating an antibody for the Manhattan virus, and they decide to scan more samples at a Crynet base on Wall Street. The scans are cut short when CELL forces led by Lockhart and Lieutenant Tara Strickland ambush them. As they attempt to transfer Alcatraz to their headquarters, the Ceph attack the CELL personnel. Additionally, a massive alien spire rises from the underground, releasing a spore-based bioweapon that kills most CELL troops in the area. Alcatraz's nanosuit further adapts the spores, but malfunctions, and is rebooted remotely by Crynet director and Hargreave-Rasch Biotechnologies co-founder Jacob Hargreave. Hargreave contacts Alcatraz, claiming to have knowledge of the Ceph, and to have designed the Nanosuit based on stolen Ceph technology to be used as a defense against the aliens. Hargreave directs Alcatraz to another Ceph spire to conduct an experiment for him. On the way, Hargreave reveals to Alcatraz that the Manhattan virus had been spread by the Ceph, to clear out the entire human population from Earth. The Manhattan virus would cause all infected humans to melt down into a liquidated mass, which could then be stored and disposed of. Upon reaching the alien spire, Alcatraz attempts to interface the Nanosuit's systems with the aliens' technology, but fails. Meanwhile, the US Department of Defense rescinds CELL's authority over Manhattan and deploys US Marines in their place under the command of Marine Colonel Sherman Barclay. The American forces order an air strike on the city's flood barrier, in an attempt to drown the aliens out of lower Manhattan. Washed away by the resulting wave of water, Alcatraz is found in Madison Square Park by a squad led by Alcatraz's squadmate Chino, who survived the submarine's destruction. The Marines enlist his aid in evacuating civilians to Grand Central Terminal, the city's primary evacuation point. Hargreave asks Alcatraz to take a detour to the Hargreave-Rasch building, to find a stabilizing agent to facilitate the Nanosuit's analyzing process. Ceph interference causes this to fail, with Hargreave telling Alcatraz to help evacuation efforts at Grand Central. At the terminal, Alcatraz is reunited with Gould, who had somehow escaped Strickland. Grand Central is overrun by Ceph forces, but Alcatraz holds them off long enough for the evacuation to succeed, and he escapes the building. Alcatraz is tasked with defending another evacuation point at Times Square, and this time manages to repurpose the alien spores to be lethal to the Ceph, destroying all Ceph in the area. With the evacuation complete, Gould instructs Alcatraz to head to Roosevelt Island, to infiltrate a Crynet complex named \\"The Prism\\", where Hargreave resides. Alcatraz foils Lockhart's attempts to ambush him, and kills him in the process. However, he is then betrayed and captured by Hargreave, who wants the Nanosuit for himself, to continue the mission in person. Hargreave attempts to remove the Nanosuit from Alcatraz's body, but the Nanosuit resists its removal, having assimilated with Alcatraz. Alcatraz is then rescued by Strickland, who reveals herself to be an undercover CIA operative responsible for Alcatraz's deployment. Strickland instructs Alcatraz to capture Hargreave. In Hargreave's private office, Alcatraz discovers Hargreave's body in a vegetative state stored in a cryonic chamber. Hargreave reveals to Alcatraz that he had been communicating with him through an advanced computer system, having been injured in an encounter with the Ceph at Tunguska. Hargreave gives Alcatraz a Nanosuit upgrade, allowing it to fully interface with the Ceph, as the Ceph invade the island. Hargreave triggers the self-destruct system of the complex, and orders the remaining CELL forces to aid Alcatraz exfiltration. Alcatraz escapes the complex, and reunites with Gould, Strickland and Chino on the shores of Manhattan. Alcatraz is notified by Barclay that the US Department of Defense plans to launch a STRATCOM Tactical Nuclear Strike on Manhattan Island. Thus, Alcatraz has a short period of time to end the conflict with the Ceph before the missile is launched. Alcatraz and his comrades make their way toward the center of the alien infestation, and spot a massive alien \\"litho-ship\\" rising out of the ground beneath Central Park. Alcatraz assaults the floating section of Central Park, and makes his way to the alien spire at its center, which serves as a dispersal point for the alien spores. Alcatraz successfully turns the spire's bio-weapon against the Ceph, causing the death of all the Ceph in the city. After some days, the city begins to recover with the help of Gould, Strickland, and the US Military. Alcatraz, while unconscious, communicates with Prophet, whose memories, experiences, and personality had been stored in the suit. Prophet tells Alcatraz that, while the mission in New York is a success, the Ceph, who had been present on Earth since prehistoric times, had built constructs globally. The Nanosuit then assimilates Prophet's memories into Alcatraz. The Nanosuit then receives a broadcast from Karl Rasch, the other founder of Hargreave-Rasch Biotechnologies, asking for his name. Alcatraz replies: \\"They call me Prophet.\\" Development Crysis 2 was announced at E3 2009 on June 1, 2009, and was in development from 2007. Crysis 2 is the sequel to 2007's Crysis which was lauded for its impressive visuals. German-based studio Crytek, which developed the first game, is the lead developer of the sequel, along with help from Crytek UK, formerly Free Radical. It is the first game using the new engine CryEngine 3. The Microsoft Windows version is built on DirectX 9, with an optional DirectX 11 add-on. Crytek looked to surpass the original Crysis, which was still a benchmark of PC graphical performance in 2011. Crysis 2 did not use EA's online pass system. On April 14, 2014, Crytek announced that the multiplayer mode for Microsoft Windows will be unplayable after GameSpy switches off its servers on May 30, 2014. Marketing Retail versions On August 17, 2010 EA announced that there would be two special editions of the game. The Limited Edition of Crysis 2 is available at the same price as the regular game, but in limited quantities. It comes with bonus experience points to \\"immediately boost the player up to Rank 5, giving access to all the preset class loadouts\\", a digital camo weapon skin for the SCAR, the \\"Hologram Decoy\\" attachment for the SCAR, and unique in-game platinum dog tags. The Indian Version, on pre-order, also includes the Threat Tracer Suit Module (Early Access), and, on buying from the EA store, a gold dog tag and desert camo for SCAR. The Nano Edition of Crysis 2, which was only available through pre- order, includes the Limited Edition copy of the game in a Steelbook case, an 11\\" statue of Alcatraz posed on top of a New York City taxi, an art book, and a Nanosuit backpack \\"modeled after the in-game super suit.\\" The Nanosuit backpack is large enough to accommodate a 17\\" laptop. As of September 26, 2010, the Nano Edition was made available for pre-order on the EA website for a $149.95 price tag but was sold out before March 2011. After the game's launch, those who preordered the Nano Edition had their shipment delayed. EA gave the affected customers a 75% off coupon and later a free digital copy of Crysis 2 Limited Edition as compensation. In May 2012, Crysis 2: Maximum Edition was released for Microsoft Windows. It included the game and previously released DLC, including nine additional multiplayer maps and new game modes for them, two new weapons (FY71 Assault Rifle and M18 Smoke Grenades), the Scar weapon skin, a Scar hologram decoy to attach to the player's weapon, platinum dog tags, and access to bonus XP through custom and preset classes. Also included is the high resolution texture pack. Multiplayer demo EA and Crytek launched a multiplayer demo of Crysis 2 on January 25, 2011. Crytek announced that the demo would only be available until February 4, 2011. The demo was on the Xbox 360, for Gold members to download, although on January 27, Crytek confirmed that there would be a multiplayer demo for Microsoft Windows. The demo featured the maps Skyline and Pier 17, as well as two multiplayer game modes to play: Team Instant Action and Crash Site. Team Instant Action puts two teams against one another in a team deathmatch style, while Crash Site has players defending alien drop pods like control points. Within hours of its release, thousands of complaints were reported after numbers of players were met with disconnects from games, crashing during loading and, oddly, a temperamental incompatibility with the Xbox Wireless WiFi adaptor. Crytek issued a statement telling players it was aware of \\"technical issues\\" with the Xbox multiplayer demo of Crysis 2, and managed to fix most of the issues in time for the PC demo. Some bugs still exist as of the current trial build but are mostly if not entirely visual and do not noticeably affect game play. Speaking at an EA event to PlayStation Universe, Crysis 2 producer Nathan Camarillo said that a PlayStation 3 version was possible, also stating there would be no difference in quality between the PlayStation 3 version of Crysis 2 and the Xbox 360 one, which had seen a pre- release demo. Crytek released the first footage of Crysis 2 running on PlayStation 3 on February 24, 2011. The second Crysis 2 multiplayer demo was released on March 1, 2011 on both Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360. Among bug fixes from the first beta, the map 'Pier 17' was added to the Xbox version and extended to the PC version. PC gamers have commented on Xbox 360 remnants in the PC demo version, such as the prompt to \\"press start to begin\\" or to \\"adjust your TV settings\\" when configuring the game brightness. It has also been reported that the PC version would not be released with support for DirectX 11, which will instead be implemented with a patch \\"later on\\". On April 8, 2011, Crytek announced ‚Äì still without marking delivery date ‚Äì that a DirectX 11 patch was being worked on. On March 15, 2011, a multiplayer demo was released on the PlayStation Network, featuring both of the maps featured on the Xbox 360 version of the demo, being 'Pier 17' and 'Skyline'. On March 18, it was removed from the Store and the servers were shut down due to server connection delays. Leaked beta A beta version of the game dated from January was leaked on multiple torrent sites on February 11, 2011. Online reports indicated that the leaked beta is a partially functioning developer's build compiled on January 13, 2011.Leaked Crysis 2 Beta Hits Torrent Sites. eXophase.com (February 11, 2011).

The leaked version included the entire single-player campaign and multiplayer component, but contained numerous bugs, was plagued by frequent crashes, and was only partially completed with many placeholders and textures missing and was limited to DirectX 9, rather than the DirectX 11 which was expected in the retail game.Crysis 2 PC & Multiplayer Master Key Leaks 39 Days Prior To Release - Voodoo Extreme.

Crytek released a statement saying they were \\"deeply disappointed\\" in piracy, which \\"continues to damage the PC packaged goods market.\\" Some reviewers remarked that Crytek's statement was strange, considering that no PC demo of the game had been released yet, and moreover, the source of the leaked beta was almost certainly an internal employee (rather than pirates). On February 14, 2011, Crytek released a statement by Cevat Yerli that stated that despite their disappointment caused by the leak incident, Crytek is overwhelmed with the support they have received and they can assure the community that PC gaming is very important to them now and in the future.Cevat Yerli: PC gaming is very important to us and will always be important to Crytek in the future.

Crytek producer Nathan Camarillo called the Crysis 2 game leak a \\"really ugly version\\" that the studio did not want people to see: In the beginning of 2012, PC Gamer reported that Crysis 2 was the most pirated PC game of 2011 with 3.9 million downloads. Downloadable content The first post-launch downloadable content (DLC) package, titled Crysis 2: Retaliation, was announced on May 10, 2011. Retaliation features four new multiplayer maps - Park Avenue, Transit, Shipyard, and Compound. It was released on May 18, 2011 for the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.Crysis 2 'Retaliation' map pack arrives next week - first trailer On June 14, 2011 a second map pack entitled Decimation was released for the Xbox 360 and PC. It included five new maps (5th Avenue, Chasm, Plaza, Prism, and Apartments) as well as two new weapons (FY71 Assault Rifle and the Smoke Grenade). Decimation was released onto the PlayStation 3 platform on June 28 in North America and June 29 in Europe. Soundtrack The Crysis 2 Original Soundtrack was composed by Borislav Slavov and Tilman Sillescu with the help of Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe. A new rendition of the song entitled \\"New York, New York\\" by B.o.B was used in the launch trailer. There have been four official releases of the soundtrack. Three albums are available in digital form (via iTunes and Amazon): The Original Videogame Soundtrack, released on the game's launch date, with 15 tracks; Be Fast!, released on April 26, 2011, with 16 tracks; and Be the Weapon!, released on June 7, 2011, with 17 tracks. The most complete version, consisting of two CDs and 46 tracks, was released on April 26, 2011 under La-La Land Records. Reception Crysis 2 received positive reviews from critics. The reviewers praised various graphical attributes as well as the empowering Nanosuit, but criticized the linearity of the gameplay in contrast to its open world predecessors, Crysis and Crysis Warhead, as well as Crytek's acclaimed debut title Far Cry. Review aggregator website Metacritic rated the PC version 86/100, the Xbox 360 version 84/100, and the PlayStation 3 version 85/100. One early review of Crysis 2 was published by Official Xbox Magazine, which gave the game a 9/10. According to the magazine, it was the multiplayer that tipped the balance. It describes the online experience as \\"some of the most exciting, angry and satisfying action you'll ever have\\". The sheer spectacle of the single player campaign also left OXM impressed, and the magazine said the game's Nanosuit \\"is both massively empowering and intelligently balanced by the need to manage its energy levels\\". Gamereactor reviewed all versions simultaneously and awarded the game a 9/10, noting that \\"its design is an exciting contrast to the jungles of the original, and New York is filled with destroyed landmarks, ruined neighbourhoods and the beauty of disaster that Cevat talked about. The amount of detail is insane, and the effects are incredible.\\" On the other hand, the reviewers criticized the story, noting \\"the dialogue often feels over the top and the characters feel flat and uninteresting. Crytek have clearly been inspired by Half-Life 2, but they never even come close to Valve's league despite their high ambitions.\\" They concluded that \\"it would simply be a shame not to call this the best action game so far this year.\\" A review for the PlayStation 3 version only was published by Official PlayStation Magazine, which gave the game an 8/10. OPM calls Crysis 2 \\"excellent - technically strong, visually outstanding and full of welcome fresh ideas.\\" OPMs main gripes are with the shooter's \\"bungled\\" opening section, and their view that it takes several hours of \\"persisting\\" through \\"a thorny, poorly signposted and indifferent shooter\\" until Crysis 2 really kicks off. \\"Developer Crytek has a deserved reputation for pushing gaming hardware to the brink, and its debut work on PS3 is first-rate,\\" it says. \\"It doesn't just look good, it looks different. The Manhattan mix of crooked concrete spires and green urban spaces is refreshing after the relentless dark khaki backgrounds of Call of Duty and Medal of Honor.\\" The Telegraph considered that the game heavily borrowed from the Call of Duty shooters, being much more scripted and linear than Crysis, calling the game a \\"walled in\\" experience. The Telegraph also criticized the enemies' \\"utterly atrocious\\" AI, \\"problematic\\" sound, and \\"uninspiring\\" multiplayer. GameZone gave the game an 8.5/10, stating \\"With plenty of in-game collectibles in both the multiplayer and single-player modes, as well as solid multiplayer gameplay options, players will find plenty of bang for their buck, and the stunning power of the CryEngine needs to be seen to be believed.\\" Unlike the original Crysis, which allowed the user to extensively change various graphical settings, Crysis 2 at launch provided fewer options. However, advanced settings and DirectX 11 features were added in patch 1.8 along with high resolution textures. The high-res texture upgrade can be used in either DX9 mode or DX11 mode (the graphics card must have 768 MB or more video memory), but can only be enabled on 64-bit operating systems. Due to an unresolved bug in Crysis 2, DirectX 11 mode does not function properly on Windows 8. As of June 30, 2011 over 3 million copies of the game have been sold across all platforms, which is less than Crysis on PC only. In April 2012 it was awarded with the Deutscher Computerspielpreis in the category Best German Game. Sequel A sequel titled Crysis 3 was released on February 19, 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

It is the third main game of the Crysis series, a sequel to the 2011 video game Crysis 2. The multiplayer portion of the game was developed by Crytek UK. Crysis 3s story revolves around Prophet, a Nanosuit holder who is on a quest to take revenge on the Alpha Ceph, the leader of the Ceph alien race. The game's story serves as the end of the Crysis trilogy. Gameplay revolves around the use of the Nanosuit, which grants players a variety of abilities such as being invisible. New features introduced in Crysis 3 include a new Nanosuit ability called \\"Rip & Throw\\", a compound bow and the \\"hacking\\" feature, which allows players to hack into enemies' equipment, drones, and security defenses. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic New York City, in an effort to merge the urban landscape of Crysis 2 and the forest setting of the original Crysis. The game introduces the \\"Seven Wonders\\", with each wonder having its own unique landscape and tactical layout. Due to complaints about Crysis 2s linearity, the game's levels were opened up so as to grant players more freedom. The development team also put efforts into creating a more emotional story, and the story's protagonist was inspired by the lead character of District 9. The game was developed by a team of 100 people during its 23-month development cycle. Crytek UK developed the game's multiplayer portion. Officially announced in April 2012, Crysis 3 received positive reviews upon release. Praise was directed at the weapon selection and customization, menus, visuals and multiplayer, while it was criticized for its story, level design, length, and outdated mechanics in comparison to its predecessors. With a budget of $66 million, the game sold 205,000 copies in its debut month, and became a commercial failure for Electronic Arts. The game was later included in The Crysis Trilogy, a bundle released in February 2014. Gameplay A gameplay screenshot of the game. The screenshot shows Prophet using his compound bow, which is one of the new weapons introduced in Crysis 3. Similar to the earlier games in the Crysis series, Crysis 3 is a first- person shooter. Players take control of Prophet as he progresses through New York City to defeat the Ceph, a technologically advanced alien race. Throughout the game, players can slide, sprint, jump and crouch. When encountering enemies, players can defeat them by using guns or a compound bow, utilizing explosives like grenades and C4, or by performing a melee attack. Performing certain movements takes up energy from the Nanosuit, the armor worn by Prophet. Some abilities are not available for players to perform or utilize if the Nanosuit's energy is too low; they must wait until energy is refilled. As a result, players are tasked to manage the use of the energy. The game's artificial intelligence was updated allowing enemies to react more quickly to players' attacks. Enemies can take cover when attacked, and can employ strategy to assist and support each other against attacks. The Nanosuit allows players to identify the threat level, and the weapons held by enemies. Players can tag enemies and items by enabling visor, and can spot enemies using Nano- Vision, which detects the heat of both enemies and allies. Levels are more open-ended than in Crysis 2. Players are given more freedom, and can choose a gameplay style based on direct confrontation, or a more discreet and stealthy approach, in order to deal with enemies and to complete their objectives. There is no definite way to beat the game's seven levels. Instead, players can take different alternate routes to reach their objectives. Players can fight against enemies utilizing a wide array of gadgets and weapons, and by using the abilities granted by the Nanosuit. They can utilize an invisibility cloak to evade enemies, prevent themselves from being detected, or to perform silent takedowns. The nanosuit also has an armor mode, which reduces the amount of damage taken, in exchange for slower movement speed. New weapons are introduced in Crysis 3, such as a compound bow. Players can use the bow while in cloak mode. When using other firearms, the cloak is disrupted and can no longer function until it cools down. Arrows can be collected by players after use. Players can hack into enemies' technology, one of the game's new features. In addition, players can hack security codes, weapon boxes, Ceph technology, mines, lasers, and sentry turrets, which can all be used to fight against enemies. Players can also upgrade and customize their weapons and the Nanosuit. They can change the attachment and ammo types for their weapons. For instance, players can change between explosive arrows and electric arrows for their bow. The Nanosuit can be upgraded by collecting different suit upgrade modules scattered across the world. These upgrades can increase the suit's properties, and strengthen or unlock new abilities for players as they progress through the game.  Multiplayer  Gameplay remains similar when playing the multiplayer mode. Unlike the single-player campaign, when players sprint or boost their armor in the multiplayer modes, it does not use any nanosuit energy. There are 8 different modes, with a total of 12 available maps to play on. They are Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, Crash Site / Spears, Capture the Relay / Extraction, Hunter, Assault, Cell Vs Rebel, Developers Choice, Maximum Team Deathmatch, and Maximum Deathmatch. Scattered throughout each map are special alien weapons with scarce ammo and can be picked up by players. Players also have a new passive ability called Rip and Throw, in which they interact with environmental objects to create obstacles for hostile players and tactical advantages for themselves. This ability to interact with the environment was pushed heavily upon the team by their publisher, EA. A refined kill streak system is introduced in Crysis 3, allowing players to gain rewards by killing hostile players simultaneously while collecting their dog tag. This refined kill system involves collecting dog tags that are dropped by enemy players when killed. The perks gained from this vary from map to map. They are Maximum Radar, Swarmer, Gamma Burst, EMP, and Maximum Nanosuit, which reveals enemy players locations on the mini-map. In addition to traditional multiplayer modes, a new multiplayer mode, the Hunter mode, is featured in the game. It is an asymmetrical multiplayer mode which pits two teams of players, playing as either hunters, or troopers from CELL, against each other. The three CELL classes are equipped with completely different weapons, and defeated troopers respawn as hunters and have to defeat their former teammates. Hunters are equipped with the nanosuit and infinite cloak, as well as the Hunter Bow, which allows the hunter to fire while they're cloaked. The hunters also have access to a Thermite Arrow tip, and the CELL have various explosives and weapons that change depending on class selected. The PC version of the game can accommodate up to 16 players, while the console versions can only support 12 players. Synopsis Setting Players take on the role of Prophet as he returns to New York in 2047, 24 years after the events of Crysis 2. He discovers the city has been encased in a giant Nanodome created by the corrupt CELL corporation. The New York City Liberty Dome is a veritable urban rainforest teeming with overgrown trees, dense swamplands, and raging rivers. Within the Liberty Dome, seven distinct and treacherous environments are known as the Seven Wonders. Prophet is said to be on a \\"revenge mission\\" after uncovering the truth behind CELL's motives for building the quarantined Nanodome. Plot After the events of Crysis 2, Psycho and Prophet travel the world looking for the Alpha Ceph, the ultimate Ceph leader. Prophet and Psycho finally trace the Alpha Ceph in Russia and imprison it. However, shortly afterwards CELL Corporation, now attempting global domination of land and technology, disables Prophet in Siberia and captures all the Nanosuit soldiers, skinning them of their suits to recover the Ceph genetics stored in them. CELL transfers Prophet to a facility in New York, encased within a giant \\"Nanodome\\", to skin him. He is saved by a resistance force, led by Claire Fontanelli and Karl Ernst Rasch, as Prophet is the only Nanosuit holder left who can stop CELL. Psycho, who was saved by Claire after being skinned, explains to Prophet that during his absence, CELL used Ceph technology to generate unlimited energy, and gained a monopoly over the world's power supply. Those who could not pay for energy were enslaved by debt to CELL. The source of CELL's power generation for the entire world, called System X, is located in now abandoned New York. The resistance group wants System X destroyed to free the world from CELL. After Psycho and Prophet disable System X's core, it turns out that it is a system protocol designed to contain the Alpha Ceph while draining energy off of the alien. However, the secondary defense protocol was initiated, causing the power facility to self-destruct. The Alpha Ceph, free from containment, opens a wormhole to the Ceph homeworld. They plan to send an even larger force to invade Earth through the wormhole and terraform it at the expense of all local life's extinction. With the Alpha Ceph no longer dormant, the Ceph coordinator reactivates, and a coordinated Ceph attack ensues. After unlocking his potential ability by removing some neural blocks in his suit, Prophet learns that CELL plans to use Archangel, a satellite-based energy distribution device that can draw power from the world's power grid, as a directed energy weapon to destroy the Alpha Ceph. Firing it would cause a chain reaction that would destroy Earth. They shut off the weapon before it has enough energy to fire. Along the way, Psycho discovers Claire was one of the scientists who reluctantly skinned him, causing friction in his previously romantic relationship with her. Unfortunately, Karl, who had secretly used Ceph technology to extend his lifespan, is possessed by the Ceph and critically wounds Claire while psychically crippling Prophet. Regaining control after Psycho shot him, he sacrifices himself to distract the Alpha Ceph. Prophet, Psycho, and Claire board the VTOL and battles with Ceph ships, eventually crashing. Claire dies in the process. Psycho, saddened by her death, laments to Prophet that he is powerless because he no longer possesses a Nanosuit. Upon being told that his lack of a Nanosuit saved him from Karl's control earlier, Psycho, now going by his real name, Michael, finds another VTOL to take Prophet to the Ceph. Michael and Prophet head towards the Alpha Ceph, but are bogged down by the Ceph Master Mind. Prophet finds his way through the Ceph Army hordes and kills the Alpha Ceph which in turn kills all other Ceph troopers in the area. However, they do not have enough time to destroy the Ceph wormhole structure and the beam powering the wormhole pulls Prophet into space. Now in orbit around Earth, Prophet sees a massive Ceph warship coming through the wormhole. Recalling Archangel's power, Prophet wakes up and hacks into the satellite, and uses it to destroy the warship. The explosion collapses the wormhole and Prophet is pushed back to Earth. He crashlands in the water near the Lingshan Islands where the events of Crysis took place 27 years earlier. When Prophet wakes the next morning, he is in an abandoned hut in Lingshan. A television playing in the background informs him that CELL's assets were frozen by Senator Strickland as the corporation is under investigation. As the neural blocks are removed from the Nanosuit, the suit's outer layer is changed to reform Prophet's former physical body, resurrecting him. He walks out onto the beach and relinquishes his past by throwing his tags into the water. He then decides to use his actual name \\"Laurence Barnes\\" from then on. The game ends with Prophet walking back to the shed and activating his stealth ability. In a post-credit scene, two CELL soldiers are shot by Michael after they rushed three board members into a bunker. Michael later claimed that he would like to make a complaint to the board members regarding his treatment at one of their \\"hospitals\\". Development Crysis 3s development began in February 2011, two months before the release of Crysis 2. The development of the game's campaign was handled by Crytek; its multiplayer was handled by Crytek UK. Its development budget was significantly smaller than that of Crysis 2, as resources and manpower were relocated to develop Homefront 2 and Ryse: Son of Rome. As a result, only about 100 people worked on the game during its 23 months development. The game's budget was about $66 million. Crysis 2 was criticised for abandoning the island setting of the original Crysis. The studio decided to recreate New York City and set the game in a post- apocalyptic environment. To do this, the company introduced a concept called \\"Nanodome\\", a dome set up by CELL to isolate New York City, which had fallen to ruins over the years. Plants have grown significantly, leading to an environment that is a mix between an urban environment and the jungle setting of the past two games. The decision was made to create this environment as the team wanted to stay away from typical urban war field shown in other games of the same genre. Instead of having a rainforest in the abandoned wasteland, the Nanodome is used to fix the shape of the forest, and Crytek hoped that it would define the atmosphere and the narrative of the game. The game's main protagonist is Prophet, a nanosuit holder who had previously appeared in Crysis and Crysis 2. He returns in Crysis 3 as Crytek considered him as the most complex character who has the longest heritage in the series. When designing him, the team took inspiration from the protagonist of District 9. Psycho from the original Crysis and Crysis Warhead returns as Prophet's companion. The game revolves around Prophet attempting to redeem himself by taking revenge after finding his former squad members are dead. The story explores the themes of redemption and revenge as well as the relationship between humans and technology. Mike Read, the game's producer, summed up the game calling it \\"human\\". Unlike Crysis 2s protagonist Alcatraz who does not speak throughout the game, Prophet is voiced in Crysis 3 in an effort to deliver more emotional connection. The company made use of performance capture to record actor's performance, body movements and facial expressions. According to Read, this helps the company to create a more affecting and emotional story. This was not done in the previous games due to technological limitations. Unlike the original Crysis, which gives players more freedom to explore, Crysis 2 was criticized for being too linear. As a result, in developing the game's campaign, Crytek attempted to integrate the two major aspects of the previous installments, the freedom given in the original Crysis and the linearity of Crysis 2. Despite not being as open as the first half of Crysis, maps are significantly larger in this game than in previous installments. Several linear segments were preserved. Crytek referred to the game's map as \\"action bubbles\\", which do not necessarily fix players in a small place but allows them to move around freely. Linearity was preserved as developers considered having such segments present could help players to experience \\"epic\\" moments and \\"massive Michael Bay\\" moments. Crytek hoped that by opening up levels they could give players a sense of control, allowing them to plan and execute strategy. The game's seven levels were developed simultaneously, and the focus phrases of gameplay, art and optimization of a level was about one to two weeks. Another theme featured in the game is \\"hunt\\" and, as a result, many weapons were built around the concept. The studio wanted to stay away from typical weapon design and did not want a weapon to simply differentiate between Crysis 3 and Crysis 2. The team aimed to use weapons to create narrative. The game features a compound bow which is reminiscent of a weapon that a hunter often uses. The game's gameplay is built based on three pillars, access, adapt, and attack. Players are often tasked to do detect, spot, and to learn their enemies' behaviors and patterns before attacking. With the bow, players are encouraged to play the game stealthily, extending the game's combat. A new feature called \\"hacking\\" was developed. According to Crytek, hacking plays a huge role throughout the game. The game's combat was also made more fast-paced than that of its predecessors. One of the major goals in developing Crysis 3 was to \\"push graphics\\", as the company considered that they can effectively assist and drive gameplay and create immersion for the player. The game is powered by CryEngine 3, Crytek's proprietary engine. It utilizes some of the newest features of CryEngine 3, such as volumetric fog shadows, improved dynamic vegetation, dynamic caustics, improved area lighting and diffuse shadows. After Crysis 2 received some criticism from PC gamers because of the design sacrifices made due to the limitations of the older console hardware, Crytek responded that the PC version of Crysis 3 will figuratively \\"melt down PCs\\" due to its high system requirements. The PC version of the game required a DirectX 11 compatible video card and operating system. Similar to Crysis 2, the game is a multi- platform title, and Crytek considered the development of the game's console version a huge obstacle they had to \\"rip the engine to pieces\\" so as to get the game running on console. The multiplayer portion of the game was created by Crytek UK. It was designed to improve the efficiency of the Nanosuit in an online environment. In an effort to create memorable maps, the team designed routes that can only be discovered after a player's first playthrough. Crytek UK hoped that this approach would help players to become more immersed in the game's universe. The Hunter mode, introduced in this game, originated from a TimeSplitters's Gladiator mode. The decision to make sprint energy separated from the nanosuit energy was due to the development team's desire to create larger levels, and help players to navigate the map in a faster way. The game's music was composed by Borislav Slavov, who had previously led the soundtrack development of Crysis 2. New music was composed for the game, while some other themes from the past installments were rearranged. The theme of the game's music is changed so as to fit the game's post-apocalyptic setting. The game's music is dynamic and is designed to reflect players' gameplay style. As a result, when players use a radical approach to complete missions, more exciting background music will be played. In contrast, when players are playing stealthily, the background music will be relatively calmer and quieter. Marketing and release In November 2010, Nathan Camarillo, an executive producer from Crytek, revealed that the Crysis series could potentially be a very long-running franchise, as the company considered the series' universe easy for players to get into and become invested in. He added: \\"As the franchise grows down the line, there's no reason it can't be as big [as Call of Duty]\\". The story elements of the game had already been planned in January 2011. Despite that, Cevat Yerli, Crytek's CEO, claimed that if Crysis 2 was not a successful title, Crytek would not develop its sequel. In March 2012, Crytek teased an \\"absolutely fantastic\\" project and announced that a full reveal of the game would be held in April 2012. The game was accidentally revealed by EA on its web store on 11 April 2012. It was removed immediately from the store but the title was later officially announced on 16 April 2012. Filmmaker Albert Hughes was commissioned to produce The 7 Wonders of Crysis 3, a series of six short stylized videos, each of which features a different aspect of the game. A PC-only closed alpha version of the multiplayer was released to selected Origin users on 31 October 2012. The test began on 2 November and ended on 9 November 2012. A public multiplayer beta containing two maps (\\"Museum\\" and \\"Airport\\") and two game modes (\\"Crash Site\\" and \\"Hunter\\") was available for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 console platforms, as well as for the PC through Origin. The beta was made available on 29 January 2013 and ended on 12 February 2013. Crytek and EA announced that 3 million people participated in the beta. Crysis 3 was released worldwide on 19 February 2013 in the US and 21 February 2013 in the UK for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The Wii U version was cancelled after relations between Nintendo and EA became troubled. The Hunter Edition, which features exclusive in-game items, and early access to the compound bow in the multiplayer portion of the game, was released alongside the game. Players who had pre-ordered the game could also get the original Crysis for free. On 4 March 2015, the game was made available for Android via Nvidia Shield. The Crysis Trilogy bundle was released on 20 February 2014 consisting of the original, the Deluxe Edition of Crysis, along with other games in the series. On 30 May 2013, Electronic Arts announced The Lost Island downloadable content (DLC). The multiplayer-only DLC includes two weapons, four maps, and two competitive multiplayer modes called \\"Frenzy\\" and \\"Possession\\". The downloadable content was released worldwide on 4 July 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. Reception Crysis 3 has received generally positive reviews from critics. Aggregating review websites Metacritic rated the Xbox 360 version 76/100, the PlayStation 3 version 77/100 and the PC version 76/100. The visuals and graphics of the game were widely praised by reviewers. Christian Donlan of Eurogamer praised the game's stable frame rate. Furthermore, he considered the game's environmental design \\"artful\\". Matthew Rorie of GameSpy thought that the game was visually stunning. He applauded the team at Crytek for creating an environment that is \\"both inhospitable and queerly beautiful\\". Matt Bertz of Game Informer praised the visuals powered by CryEngine, and considered the game one of the best- looking games ever created. He especially praised its realistic environments, water effects, and character facial animation. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot also praised the mix of the decayed urban environment and the rainforest, saying that it made the game striking to look at. The game's design was praised by various reviewers. Donlan considered the game's support of stealth a welcoming addition, despite calling the game's last level a forgettable experience. Rorie praised the game's map design; he opined that the opened-up levels encourage exploration. Bertz considered the game's world had successfully captured a balance between the settings of its predecessors, and that the larger levels allowed players to deploy strategy before performing attacks. He added that some of the best missions were featured in the later stages of the game. Tristan Ogilvie of IGN thought that the control was almost perfect, despite criticizing the clumsy control of several segments which require players to control vehicles. VanOrd criticized the game for being too easy for players to play. The game's online multiplayer received positive reviews from critics. Josh Harmon of Electronic Gaming Monthly thought that the game's multiplayer was better than the campaign, and that it made the overall experience more enjoyable. Donlan praised the Hunter mode; he believed that it had delivered a tense experience. Bertz echoed similar thoughts, but felt that the mode's appeal was not as good as typical modes like Domination. As well, he criticized the multiplayer's respawn system and terrain-design. Lorenzo Veloria of GamesRadar thought that some of the game modes were unique and entertaining, despite noting some technical issues. Michael Rougeau of Complex criticized the Hunter mode, calling it \\"unbalanced\\". He furthered criticized the game for lacking a co-operative multiplayer mode. David Hinkle of Joystiq also noted some design errors in the Hunter mode. The story was disliked by critics compared to the game's other aspects. Harmon thought that several emotional segments of the game failed to deliver, as well as criticizing the forgettable storyline and plot twists. Despite that, he praised the game's finale and considered that it brought a proper closure to the Crysis trilogy. In contrast, Donlan commented that it was not quite the conclusion the series deserved. Rorie thought that the story was more mature than its predecessors, despite having a relatively weak start and short length of about six hours. Bertz opined that the story was the most cohesive of the titles in the series. Veloria, however, criticized the game's narrative; he added that it was uninspiring due to the lack of character development and interesting dialogue. In contrast, Ogilvie thought that the game's dialogue and voice-acting were excellent, citing the game's relateable characters that its predecessors failed to achieve. He considered the game's storytelling a massive improvement for the series. Many reviewers considered Crysis 3 was an evolution of the series instead of a groundbreaking revolution. Rorie criticized the game for being unambitious, and that despite the game's overall refinements, it had not strayed far enough from its predecessors. He concluded that Crysis 3 did not achieve the revolution brought by the original Crysis. Veloria thought that the title failed to bring any new element to the genre, but the overall experience delivered by the game was still satisfying. Evan Lahti of PC Gamer commented that the game did not surprise players, and that the title presented a feeling of Crysis 2: Episode 2 instead of a proper sequel. Sales During its debut release week and the next, Crysis 3 was the best-selling retail game in the UK closely followed by Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. It sold 205,000 copies in 12 days in North America during its debut month. The title, along with Dead Space 3, another EA title that was released in the same month, failed to meet the company's sales expectations. Cevat Yerli, Crytek's CEO, was also disappointed by the sales of Crysis 3. Nevertheless, he considered Crysis 3 the best game the studio had produced so far.

Patshull Hall is a substantial Georgian mansion house situated near Pattingham in Staffordshire, England. It is a Grade I listed building and by repute is one of the largest listed buildings in the county. History The Hall was built to designs by architect James Gibbs for Sir John Astley in about 1730. The main fa√ßade is of three storeys with seven bays, three of which are pedimented, and tower wings. The west wing, of monolithic proportions, has four storeys. The house was set in a park of some created by Capability Brown and including a large serpentine lake. The estate was acquired for ¬£100,000 in 1765 by Sir George Pigot, ( Baron Pigot from 1766), on his retirement as Governor of Madras. The Pigot family sold the property to William Legge, 5th Earl of Dartmouth in 1848, whose son and heir Viscount Lewisham took residence. Substantial extensions and improvements were carried out for him by architect William Burn in the 1880s. The Legges later moved their seat to Plas Newydd on Anglesey. During the 20th century the house served as a rehabilitation centre in the 1940s and then until the 1980s as an orthopaedic hospital. In 1990 the estate was broken up and many acres were sold for the creation of a golf course; a classical temple created by Capability Brown was converted to become the clubhouse. 200px During the 1990s the house fell into disrepair and was briefly used as a school. In 1996 the house had suffered extensive decay and had deteriorated so badly that it appeared on the English heritage list of Buildings at Risk. Patshull Hall was bought in 1997 by Neil Avery, a renovation specialist and entrepreneur, as a restoration project and the house was subsequently removed from the Buildings at Risk register. The renovated Hall later fell into administration before being purchased by Liam Wordley in 2015. The house is being renovated and is now used as a private family home.

Water aerobics (waterobics, aquatic fitness, aquafitness, aquafit) is the performance of aerobic exercise in water such as in a swimming pool. Done mostly vertically and without swimming typically in waist deep or deeper water, it is a type of resistance training. Water aerobics is a form of aerobic exercise that requires water- immersed participants. Most water aerobics is in a group fitness class setting with a trained professional teaching for about an hour. The classes focus on aerobic endurance, resistance training, and creating an enjoyable atmosphere with music. Different forms of water aerobics include: aqua Zumba, water yoga, aqua aerobics, and aqua jog. Variation from land-based aerobics While similar to land aerobics, in that it focuses on cardiac training, water aerobics differs in that it adds the component of water resistance and buoyancy. Although heart rate does not increase as much as in land-based aerobics, the heart is working just as hard and underwater exercise actually pumps more blood to the heart. Exercising in the water is not only aerobic, but also strength-training oriented due to the water resistance. Moving your body through the water creates a resistance that will activate muscle groups. Hydro aerobics is a form of an aerobic exercise that requires water-immersed participants. Variation of format An Aqua cycling class New aquatic formats are arising into the exercise world with ideas such as: aqua cycling and water pole dancing. Water aerobics is beneficial to a multitude of participants because the density of the water allows easy mobility for those with arthritis, obesity, and other conditions. Further, it is an effective way for people of all ages to incorporate aerobics and muscle-strengthening into their weekly exercise schedule. Most classes last for 45‚Äì55 minutes. People do not even have to be strong swimmers to participate in water aerobics. The performance of movement while suspended in water where the feet cannot touch the bottom surface, resulting in a non-impact, high-resistant, total body exercise workout, is known as deep water aerobics. Benefits of this method include less stress on the back, hips, knees and ankles. Benefits Most land-based aerobic exercisers do not incorporate strength training into their schedules and therefore adding aquatic exercise can greatly improve their health. As stated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2008), ‚ÄúAdults should also [in addition to aerobic exercise] do muscle-strengthening activities that are moderate or high intensity and involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits.‚Äù Over time water aerobics can lead to a reduction of blood pressure and resting heart rate, which will improve health overall. According to Moreno (1996) and her quotes from Huey an Olympic athlete trainer, the benefits of water resistance training include the activation of opposing muscle groups for a balanced workout. The push and pull of the water allows both increased muscle training and a built-in safety barrier for joints. In fact, before water aerobics water, injury therapy used the benefits of water. The water also helps to reduce lactic acid buildup. Another obvious benefit to water exercise is the cooling effect of the water on the system. The average temperature around 78 degrees in a group fitness pool, this temperature will force the body to burn calories to stay at homeostasis while also maintaining a cool, comfortable atmosphere with less sweat noticeable to the participant. A water aerobics class incorporating flotation devices. The mitigation of gravity makes water aerobics safe for individuals able to keep their heads out of water, including the elderly. Exercise in water can also prevent overheating through continuous cooling of the body. Older people are more prone to arthritis, osteoporosis, and weak joints therefore water aerobics is the safest form of exercise for these conditions. Research studies can teach us about the benefits the elderly can receive by participating in water aerobics. In a study done in Brazil, ‚ÄúEffects of water-based exercise in obese older women: Impact of short-term follow-up study on anthropometric, functional fitness and quality of life parameters‚Äù the effects of long-term water aerobics was tested. Although it did not conclude exactly as planned, their test subjects did experience improved aerobic capacity, muscle endurance, and better overall life quality. The water also provides a stable environment for elderly with less balance control and therefore prevents injury. Disadvantages Water aerobics has a few disadvantages from a practicality standpoint. Aqua aerobics requires access to a swimming pool via facilities, and in addition to any membership fees to access facilities, classes may cost extra. Although aquatic exercise greatly reduces the risk of injury, it is typically seen that not as many calories are burned as would be in some other activities. Though aquatic activities in general expend more energy than many land-based activities performed at the same pace due to the increased resistance of water, the speed with which movements can be performed is greatly reduced.

Also known as Bawdsey Research Station (BRS), the first Chain Home radar station was built there, characterized by eight tall masts, four for transmitting and four for receiving. When the research group moved to Dundee in September 1939, the radar station was left active under the name RAF Bawdsey. The site later hosted a Bristol Bloodhound surface-to-air missile station until 1990. History Bawdsey Manor, dating from 1886, was taken over in March 1936 by the Air Ministry for developing the Chain Home (CH) RDF (radar) system. The station's Superintendent was initially Robert Watson-Watt, later followed by A.P. Rowe. The experimental radar station was located just northeast of the Manor, about distant. When war was declared in September 1939, fears of a possible commando raid on the group led to the development activities being relocated, first to Dundee, Scotland, and later to Worth Matravers near Swanage in Dorset on the southern coast of England, where they became the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE). In the 1950s, the Bawdsey CH station was upgraded as part of the ROTOR programme and gained an underground control centre with living quarters and air filtration to make it capable of operating during nuclear attack. The command centre was accessed by way of a small bungalow which can be seen on the left of the road which runs from Bawdsey village to Bawdsey Manor. The station was stood down for a number of years, but was re-opened in 1978 as a Bloodhound missile site, with the launchers located just to the northwest of the CH site. This site was closed in 1990 when its missiles were moved to RAF West Raynham.

Background The core of the Cretan cuisine consists of food derived from natural sources, whereas food of animal origin was more peripheral in nature. In general, people consumed seasonal products, available in the wider local area, which underwent minimal processing or none at all. The traditional cuisine was widespread in the island until the 1960s when, with improving living standards, alimentary patterns changed towards more meat and other animal-derived produce. Fresh fruit and dried fruits, pulses, endemic wild herbs and aromatic plants, and rough cereals, whose cultivation was favored by the regional climate, were consumed in great amounts and constituted the base of the Cretan cuisine during that period. Dairy products were consumed on a daily basis in low to moderate quantities. Poultry and fish were consumed on a weekly basis in moderate quantities, whereas red meat was consumed only a few times a month. The main supply of fat was effectuated by olive oil, which was used not only in salads but also in cooking, unlike the northern European countries which primarily used animal fat. Another essential feature of the Cretan cuisine was the moderate use of alcohol, mainly red wine which accompanied meals. Finally, the most common dessert was yogurt and fresh fruits, while traditional pastry based on honey had been consumed a few times a week.

Steve Mann (guitarist) in 1967 History Mann broke onto the West Coast music scene in the 1960s. As a student at Valley State College in Los Angeles, Mann began to perform folk music at hootenannies and Los Angeles clubs like The Ash Grove and The Troubadour. He made a number of friends on the folk music scene, including Hoyt Axton, Judy Henske, Gale Garnett, Jimmy Rubin, and Terry Wadsworth (who later joined The New Christy Minstrels). In 1962, Mann was introduced to a young singer named Janis Joplin at an open mic performance at The Troubadour. Mann began accompanying Joplin on guitar and they performed at open mics around the Los Angeles area. They stopped performing together when Mann temporarily relocated to San Francisco. A full account of Mann's association with Janis Joplin can be found at . While in San Francisco, Mann also met singer/songwriter Ivan Ulz with whom he co-wrote two songs, one of which was recorded by Rod McKuen. Mann has also been linked to Margo St. James, Sonny Bono, Dr. John, Frank Zappa, and many more. Around 1967 Mann suffered a mental breakdown and went into partial retirement. His few recordings became collector's items and his music became legendary among blues guitar aficionados. In 2003, Mann moved to Berkeley, California where he began to perform again with the help of friends Will Scarlett and Janet Smith of Bella Roma Music. In 2005, Mann released a new album on CD, Steve Mann: Alive and Pickin'. It includes re-releases of previously recorded material, including performances with Janis Joplin, as well as a new song written and performed by Mann.

Examples of its use are #when an association elects its executive committee; and #when a parliament elects its all-party power-sharing coalition government. Consider the situation in which a parliament elects a government of ten ministers. * The ballot paper is tabular, a matrix, ten by ten: on one axis are listed the ten ministerial posts to be elected, and on the other axis are the ten preferences. * Each MP then casts one vote (of a maximum) of ten preferences, naming the ten ministers in her order of preference, and saying at the same time in which ministerial post she wishes each of her nominees to serve. A full ballot will contain one name in each column, and one name in each row: that is, she identifies, in her order of preference, ten nominees, one for each of the ten ministerial posts. * The count is in two stages: a Quota Borda system (QBS) is used to identify the ten most popular candidates; and then a Modified Borda Count determines which of these successful candidates will serve in which ministry. The matrix vote is proportional. It is ideally suited, therefore, to the formation of power-sharing governments, especially in post-conflict scenarios, and not least because it works without any resort to party or sectarian labels.Designing an All-Inclusive Democracy by Peter Emerson, published by Springer Verlag, 2007, part I pages 61-85, \\"Designing an All- Inclusive Democracy\\" (print) 978-3-540-33164-3 (online)What is a Matrix Vote?

He is a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of McGuireWoods LLP where he is head of the firm's Crisis Response practice and co-head of its white collar team. He is a former United States Deputy Attorney General and acting United States Attorney General. Terwilliger, of Vermont, was nominated on February 14, 1992, by President George H.W. Bush to be Deputy Attorney General at the U.S. Department of Justice. He succeeded William Pelham Barr. As Deputy Attorney General, Terwilliger became the second- highest-ranking official in the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and ran the day-to-day operations of the Department, serving in that position from 1991 through 1993. He was appointed to the position by President George H.W. Bush after serving as the United States Attorney for the District of Vermont, appointed by President Reagan. Early and family life Terwilliger was born June 5, 1950, in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He grew up in Metuchen, N.J., went to public school, graduated from Seton Hall University (B.A., 1973) with a degree in Communications and Antioch School of Law (J.D., 1978). Married, Terwilliger has three children and three grandchildren, and resides in Alexandria and Delaplane, Virginia. His father, George J. Terwilliger, Jr., was a civil engineer and Navy veteran with combat experience in the Pacific in World War II. His mother, Ruth Terwilliger, was a librarian and worked in real estate sales. Career Early government service After admission to the bar, from 1978 to 1981, Terwilliger served as Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia (1978-81) and an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Vermont (1981-86) and then became U.S. Attorney for Vermont (1986-1990) and later Deputy U.S. Attorney General (1991‚Äì93) in the George H. W. Bush administration. Terwilliger specialized in white-collar crime and terrorism. In 1993, Terwilliger \\"briefly took the helm of the Justice Department as acting attorney general after the departure of former Attorney General William P. Barr.\\" Iran-Contra Terwilliger commented on the Iran‚ÄìContra affair in a February 6, 2001 appearance on a CNN titled \\"Burden of Proof: Ronald Reagan's Legal Legacy\\". 2000 Florida recount During the Florida 2000 election recount, Terwilliger was co-leader of Republican President-elect George W. Bush's legal team and was \\"an advisor to the Bush-Cheney Transition and counselor to designated cabinet and other prospective appointees.\\" In June 2001, Bush administration spokesman Ari Fleischer was asked in a White House press briefing whether Terwilliger was a leading candidate to head the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Private legal practice Rather than return to government service, in 2003, Terwilliger co-founded the 527 committee \\"Americans for a Better Country\\" with Frank J. Donatelli, former Ronald Reagan White House political director and secretary and treasurer of the Young America's Foundation, and Craig Shirley, president and CEO of Shirley & Banister Public Affairs. In April 2007 Terwilliger served as a panelist for the Brookings Institution Judicial Issues Forum entitled \\"Politics and the Justice Department: Finding a Path to Accountability\\". As summer ended, Terwilliger was reported among the \\"Top Contenders\\" to replace Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, \\"whose tenure has been marred by controversy and accusations of perjury before Congress\\". Gonzales resigned August 27, 2007, and left office on September 17, 2007. In October 10, 2007, news outlets reported that Gonzales hired Terwilliger \\"to represent him in investigations of mismanagement\\" of the U.S. Department of Justice. \\"Investigators are look[ing] into allegations that Gonzales lied to lawmakers and illegally allowed politics to influence hiring and firing at the department.\\" Terwilliger represented Gonzales through several Inspector General investigations and a subsequent criminal investigation by a special prosecutor. Gonzales was exonerated in all matters. In 2008, the American Bar Association mentioned Terwilliger as a leading candidate for Attorney General under a John McCain presidency. It related that while in the USDOJ during the Reagan Administration, Terwilliger dealt with resolving matters such as investigating BCCI after an international banking scandal and investigating after the savings and loan scandal, environmental cases, antitrust merger reviews and enforcement matters, civil rights and voting cases as well as terrorism and national security cases. Terwilliger was also in charge of all Justice Department operations, including crisis response, such as the 1992 Los Angeles riots. On policy matters, he was a principal in the highest councils of government charged with addressing the broad array of legal policy issues arising in the executive branch. Current high profile work Terwilliger currently represents former U.S. Congressman Aaron Schock, indicted in 2016 after resigning from his legislative position. In March 2017, Terwilliger and his colleagues publicized the involvement of a former Schock staffer who acted as a confidential informant in the case after the indictment.

He was born in Greensburg, Pennsylvania to Lucetta Oliver and Edgar Cowan, a local lawyer. He studied at Jefferson College, but faculty there expelled him for a prank. In 1861, however, he moved to Washington, D.C. to join his father, who was newly elected as a United States Senator from Pennsylvania. His father gave him a clerk position on the Committee on Patents. During this formative period Cowan studied law (he was admitted in 1865 to the Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania bar), and also became a writer of fiction, poetry, nonfiction, and drama. In April 1867 President Andrew Johnson appointed the 22-year-old Cowan as his personal secretary for managing land patents. He worked for Johnson for the next year and a half, then opened his own law practice in Washington after Ulysses S. Grant succeeded Johnson. At this time he also started to study medicine at Georgetown Medical College, from which he graduated in 1869. He returned to Greensburg later that year and married Harriet Jack, daughter of U.S. Congressman William Jack. He opened both a law and medical practice there, and also started a newspaper, Frank Cowan's Paper, focused on Western Pennsylvania and which he edited and published for three years. In 1873 his wife died after child birth, as would the infant son Jack. Cowan then became ill himself, and after a time sought relief by sailing around the world in 1880-81, and again in 1884-85, writing about Australia, Brazil, Hawaii, India, Korea, and New Zealand. He gained some notoriety in 1867 when he partnered with Thomas Birch Florence to write and publish a literary hoax. This scheme to sell newspapers for Florence's struggling Georgetown newspaper did cause sales to skyrocket. The hoax claimed the discovery of the body of an Icelandic Christian woman, who had died in 1051, below the Great Falls of the Potomac River, proving that America had been \\"discovered\\" five centuries before Christopher Columbus. In 1904, knowing that he was terminally ill, Cowan conceived another media hoax connected to the Viking hoax of his youth. He contracted a local carpenter, John Walthour, to build him a model of a fire ship, the funeral vessel of Vikings chiefs. He then gave instructions to be buried beneath a tree at the summit Tollgate Hill, from which he would sail symbolically \\"over the Sea of Appalachia . . . .\\" Cowan died in Greensburg and was buried in St. Clair Cemetery.

Adolfi and starring George Arliss and Bette Davis. The screenplay by Charles Kenyon and Maude T. Howell is based on the story The Adopted Father by Edgar Franklin. The film is preserved in the Library of Congress collection.Catalog of Holdings The American Film Institute Collection and the United Artists collection at the Library of Congress, (<-book title) p.212 c.1978 by the American Film Institute Plot Successful shoe manufacturer John Reeves is annoyed with his staff, particularly his conceited nephew and company general manager Benjamin Burnett (who considers himself the driving force behind the firm), because they are losing ground to their longtime chief rival, headed by former best friend Tom Hartland. The two men had had a falling out after falling in love with the same woman; she married Hartland, and Reeves remained a bachelor. Nevertheless, Reeves is saddened to learn of Hartland's death. When Benjamin begins to muse that his uncle has started down the road to senility, Reeves decides to teach him a lesson. He heads off on a fishing vacation in Maine, leaving his nephew to deal with the business situation by himself. By chance, a large yacht moors near his fishing boat. Jenny and Tommy Hartland, the party-loving offspring and heirs of Tom Hartland, swim over to see if anyone can supply them with liquor, Reeves is a little disgusted with their idle ways. Hiding his identity and calling himself John Walton, he befriends them in order to do a little spying on their company. However, as he gets to know them better, he begins to like them. They take him along with them back to New York, as they are responsible for his minor injury. \\"Walton\\" gets them to take him on a tour of their plant, which he discovers is being deliberately mismanaged by Fred Pettison. He figures out that Pettison is driving it into bankruptcy so he can buy it cheaply later. Reeves persuades Tommy to have him appointed a trustee of the Hartland estate. Tommy and Jenny expect him to do away with the restraints imposed upon them. When two other trustees express their concern about the fisherman's qualifications, Reeves reveals his identity and the fact that he has grown fond of the young people who, if things had turned out differently, could have been his own children. Once he becomes a trustee, he starts making wholesale changes, on both the domestic and business side. He quickly discharges most of the household servants, as the estate is nearly depleted, forcing Jenny and Tommy to mature quickly. Pettison is fired. Tommy begins working at his own company, while his sister, anxious to find out why their shoes are less popular than those manufactured by Reeves, takes a filing job with the rival company under the alias Jane Grey. She finds herself attracted to Benjamin. When Benjamin summons her to his office to fire her for her total lack of business skills, he finds her very attractive. Upon learning the news, she starts crying, and Benjamin reconsiders his decision. In the end, he reassigns her to work in his private office. Meanwhile, Reeves has revitalized the Hartland Shoe Company, and it start making serious inroads into Reeves Company territory. Benjamin is puzzled, as the methods used by Hartland seem strikingly similar to those employed by Reeves. When Pettison shows up in Benjamin's office, looking for a job, he sees Jane. She begs him to keep her secret, but he tells Benjamin who she really is and lies, accusing her of spying on the company. This ends their budding romance. In the end, Benjamin insists on meeting \\"John Walton\\", and Reeves has to reveal his true identity to the Hartlands. Once they get over the shock, and Reeves informs his nephew that Jenny was not a spy, the young couple reconcile. All agree to Reeves' proposal that the two companies merge. Production notes The Warner Bros. release marked the second pairing of George Arliss and Bette Davis, who co-starred in The Man Who Played God the year before. The film had its world premiere at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The 1936 film 20th Century Fox film Everybody's Old Man was based on the same source.

It bisects the downtown neighborhood, as well as the adjacent Over-the-Rhine neighborhood. The street also serves as the dividing line for the \\"east\\" and \\"west\\" sides of the city. All east-west addresses in the city start at zero at Vine Street. It heads mostly north-northeast from the riverfront area through the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood, ascending between Fairview and Mount Auburn until it courses the uptown plateau past the University of Cincinnati. As the eastern perimeter of the campus and the Environmental Protection Agency's regional offices, Vine is called Jefferson Avenue, though it directly connects with Vine Street on its north and south ends. An adjunct, known as Short Vine, essentially parallels Jefferson Avenue and functions as a central artery of the neighborhood of Corryville, an off- campus business district with a number of shops, music venues, and restaurants.http://shortvineonline.com/ Vine Street and Jefferson Avenue were both realigned in the 1970s to provide a bypass around the Corryville Neighborhood Business District. Previously, Vine St and Short Vine formed a five-leg intersection with Auburn Avenue and East and West Corry Streets. The south legs of Vine and North leg of Auburn were removed to make room for a commercial shopping center. However, Vine St and Short Vine still divide the east and west sides of Cincinnati. The Jefferson Avenue \\"bypass\\" is still on the west side of the city. The north end of Short Vine connects to Vine Street at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive intersection. Vine Street (north of Jefferson) descends past the Cincinnati Zoo and the Vine Street Hill Cemetery. Near the bottom of Vine Street Hill, the street leaves the City of Cincinnati and takes a northwestern heading through the independent entities of Saint Bernard, Ohio, home of Ivorydale (Manufacturing heart of Procter & Gamble). In Saint Bernard, it passes beneath the Mill Creek Expressway, as this segment of Interstate 75 is known. After a railroad crossing near Ivorydale, it meets Spring Grove Avenue. Vine Street then enters Elmwood Place and serves as the municipality's central boulevard. Vine continues in a northerly direction through the Cincinnati city neighborhood of Carthage, where it merges with Ohio State Route 4 at the terminus of Paddock Road. The Ronald Reagan Cross County Highway crosses over Vine Street. Passing on through the Cincinnati neighborhood of Hartwell, Vine Street then becomes Springfield Pike when it enters Wyoming, Ohio. Springfield Pike continues through Woodlawn, Ohio. At the north end of Woodlawn, entering Glendale, Ohio, there is a fork in the road. Ohio State Route 4 and Springfield Pike veer off to the left towards downtown Springdale, Ohio, while Ohio State Route 747 continues straight north as Congress Avenue through Glendale, and later as Princeton Pike into Springdale near Tri-County Mall. Most of the buildings on Vine Street are commercial, and represent the city's historic business district.

It lies on U.S. Routes 19, 23, and 74 Business near the interchange of Interstates 26, 40, and 240. Although it is unincorporated, it has a post office, with the ZIP code of 28728.Zip Code Lookup History American Enka The American Enka Company, incorporated in 1928, built what became the nation's largest rayon- producing factory. The Dutch name of the rayon company was Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek, and it is from the Dutch phonetic pronunciation of the initial letters N and K of the firm's name that \\"Enka\\" is derived. The alternative explanation that Enka stands for \\"Eerste Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek Arnhem\\" is incorrect. The Dutch company considered many sites and decided on the Hominy Valley because of its supply of water and labor. In 1929 the company began developing a community plan that included employee houses and became known as Enka Village. Enka Village is now a historic community and is part of the city of Asheville. Fred Loring Seely, an Asheville businessman and son-in-law of Edwin Wiley Grove (see Grove Park Inn) met several influential Dutch businessmen during his time in the Dutch colony of Java in 1901. Seely and his wife, Evelyn Grove Seely, had been sent to Java by Mr. Grove to secure a source for quinine which was used in Grove's famous malarial Chill Tonic. When the Dutch rayon businessmen were searching for a site for an American based factory in 1928 Mr. Seely served as a liaison to lure ENKA to build the rayon fiber factory in Buncombe County. He told the ENKA owners that his county could supply trees for fiber, water for processing and reliable manpower. Thousands of jobs for western NC in 1929 was a lifesaver for many families. American Enka sent Mr. Seely over 1 million dollars to buy 2000 acres and ENKA built a $10 million plant. Nineteen hundred people worked there during the Great Depression, and that number reached 4300 after World War II. At one point 7,000 people worked there. Amenities included a gym, a pool room, a bowling alley, two cafeterias, and a library. Enka Lake Club opened on a lake built to supply the plant with water. Buses delivered employees from the surrounding area. It was said that stricter environmental regulations led to a decline in rayon, and American Enka sold the plant to BASF in 1985. BASF sold the plant to Colbond Inc. in 2000, and as of 2007, rayon was no longer made. The northern section was sold to developers who tore down everything but the clock tower. Enka Lake is generally called Biltmore Lake now, part of Biltmore Farms; However the name has never been officially changed, nor are there any plans to do so. Three buildings became the Enka campus of Asheville‚ÄìBuncombe Technical Community College. The future of Enka On July 6, 2010, the city of Asheville began looking at a proposal for Enka Center, which will take an estimated 14 years to complete. The clock tower of the former American Enka plant would be the centerpiece of a retail center on the northwest section of the site. Portions of the plant still stand, including a campus of Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College; these would remain. Offices, warehouses and industrial areas would locate in the southeastern part of the complex. would remain open space, and a greenway would follow along Hominy Creek. Though as of 2015 about 200 people worked for Bonar Inc. making fabric for commercial carpet backing, and more space was leased to ten other companies, most of the former plant is gone. A school scheduled to open in 2016 will have 20,000 bricks from the plant, a clock tower recalling the one at the plant, and sloped roofs recalling the sawtooth design.

Willcox's first appearance is as the designer of a \\"Suburban Octagonal Cottage\\"The architectural fad in mid-nineteenth-century American house-building is discussed at Octagon house. illustrated in plan and elevation in John Bullock, The American Cottage Builder: A Series of Designs, Plans, and Specifications (New York: Stringer & Townshend) 1854:239f; the design, which could be well executed in wood for about $1500, was described at length in Willcox's own words. In later life Willcox claimed to have been the uncredited architect of Grammar School 51 at 519 West 44th Street, New York City, built in 1858.Christopher Gray, \\"Streetscapes: Readers' Questions\\", The New York Times, 1 September 1991, points out that Willcox was listed at a home address of 445 West 44th Street in 1863-64. (On-line). He served in the American Civil War with the 95th New York Infantry, December 1861 to September 1863, as a topographical engineer who prepared the well-known map of the battle of Antietam for Brig. Gen. Abner Doubleday, and reaching the rank of lieutenant before he was released after Gettysburg.Antietam in the War After his release from service, in partnership with the well-known New York architect Gamaliel King, he assisted in constructing the Kings County Savings Bank in Williamsburgh, Brooklyn, built 1860-67. Willcox relocated to Chicago by 1871, where he was briefly employed by Dankmar Adler.\\"Willcox, William H.,\\" in Jeffrey Karl Ochsner, ed., Shaping Seattle Architecture: A Historical Guide to the Architects (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1994), 354. He opened his own office in Chicago by 1872, practicing in the city until 1879; from 1875 to 1877 he was a partner in the Chicago firm Willcox and Miller. After 1879 Willcox moved to Nebraska, where he remained through 1881. Willcox was architect of the Nebraska State Capitol building (1879-1882, destroyed), as well as several other institutional structures in Nebraska.Willcox's capitol building was replaced in the early 1920s by the current capitol building designed by Bertram Goodhue. Willcox may have returned briefly to Chicago, but by 1882, he had relocated to St. Paul, Minnesota. In 1883 he designed the Cairo, Illinois Public Library, described as a \\"Queen Anne style\\" structure of red pressed brick, with pale brick and terracotta details.,Katharine Lucinda Sharp , Illinois Libraries (University of Illinois) 1906-09:155. but most of his work was in smaller towns and cities in Minnesota and northern Wisconsin. In 1884, Willcox published Hints to Those Who Propose to Build‚ÄîAlso a Description of Improved Plans for the Construction of Churches (St. Paul: Pioneer Press, 1884), which included a list of his most important projects to that date.Jeffrey Karl Ochsner and Dennis Alan Andersen, Distant Corner: Seattle Architects and the Legacy of H. H. Richardson (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2003), 368 n. 141. A copy of Willcox's book may be found at the Minnesota Historical Society in St. Paul. In 1886 Willcox entered a partnership with the younger Clarence H. Johnston, Sr. (1859-1936), whom he may have known in New York.For Willcox and Johnston, see: Paul Clifford Larson, Minnesota Architect: The Life and Work of Clarence H. Johnston (Afton MN: Afton Historical Society Press, 1996), 45-66. Willcox and Johnston never received commercial commissions, but the partnership produced many notable buildings, including the \\"Summit Terrace\\" row (St. Paul), of which one was the F. Scott Fitzgerald House (illustration, above right); the First Baptist Church (Chicago); the main building of Macalester College (St. Paul); the Mercantile Library (Peoria, Illinois);Northwest Architectural Archives, University of Minnesota: abstract of the Johnston papers. and St. Peter's Protestant Episcopal Church, 1888 (Dayton's Bluff, St. Paul)The sanctuary was extended by Johnston in 1905; the church, now a condominium, is the only nineteenth-century structure remaining in \\"Historic Dayton's Bluff\\". Willcox and Johnston dissolved their partnership in 1890. In 1891 Willcox relocated to Seattle, Washington, where he entered a partnership with the established Seattle architect William E. Boone. Boone and Willcox supervised completion of the spectacular New York Building (1889-1892, demolished), which Boone had already designed. HistoryLink: the Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History; see also Heather M. MacIntosh, \\"William E. Boone (1830-1921)\\"; Jeffrey Karl Ochsner, \\"William E. Boone,\\" in Ochsner, ed., Shaping Seattle Architecture: A Historical Guide to the Architects, (Seattle: University of Washington Press) 1994:16-21. Boone and Willcox together were responsible for design of the J. M. Frink Building (Washington Iron Works Building/Washington Shoe Building) (1891‚Äì92), and the Plymouth Congregational Church (1891‚Äì92, destroyed)--this church likely reflects Willcox's extensive experience with church design in the Midwest.Jeffrey Karl Ochsner and Dennis Alan Andersen, Distant Corner: Seattle Architects and the Legacy of H. H. Richardson (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2003), 198-199, 238-240 Boone and Willcox also prepared a plan for the University of Washington campus in 1891, but construction never went forward.Jeffrey Karl Ochsner and Dennis Alan Andersen, Distant Corner: Seattle Architects and the Legacy of H. H. Richardson (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2003), 230-234. The Boone and Willcox plan was abandoned before the University of Washington construction proceeded in 1893. Boone and Willcox dissolved their partnership in June 1892. Willcox had less success on his own, and moved to Los Angeles in 1895 after the Panic of 1893 dried up architectural work in Seattle.Jeffrey Karl Ochsner and Dennis Alan Andersen, Distant Corner: Seattle Architects and the Legacy of H. H. Richardson (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2003), 285. Willcox arrived in California and established a practice in Los Angeles, where directories list his offices at 345 Bradbury Block. In 1896 the architect Henry F. Starbuck, who later practiced in Fresno, maintained his Los Angeles office at the same address in the Bradbury Block.Historic Fresno: William H. Willcox In 1896 Willcox entered a competition for the design of a new Kings County CourthouseThe apparent connection with Kings County, New York is coincidental; other competitors were William J. Cuthbertson of San Francisco, B. G. McDougall of Bakersfield, and S. J. A. Preston of Los Angeles (Historic Fresno: William H. Willcox) and was awarded the commission, though the Board asked the architect to revise his plans to eliminate a central dome and apply the cost savings to a ten-foot basement. In 1898 Willcox was unsuccessful in a suit against the First Baptist Church of Los Angeles to recover design fees for a design submitted the previous year; shortly thereafter he relocated to San Francisco; from San Francisco he designed the public library for Reno, Nevada, in 1904.It was constructed by the local builder W.M. Fletcher, according to the Washoe County Archive. After 1907, Willcox may have reduced his activities as an architect and practiced primarily as a surveyor. He retired from practice in San Francisco shortly before World War I. Willcox was living at a Veterans Home of California Yountville in Yountville, California, when he died in 1929, shortly before his 97th birthday.

In the case of inflammation, it refers to the movement of white blood cells from the capillaries to the tissues surrounding them (leukocyte extravasation, also known as diapedesis). In the case of malignant cancer metastasis it refers to cancer cells exiting the capillaries and entering organs (to form secondary tumors). It is frequently used in medical contexts, either referring to urine, or to blood. More specifically, it can refer to: * Extravasation (intravenous) * Extravasation of infusates * Extravasation of irrigation fluid * Extravasation of urine * Leukocyte extravasation *Angiopellosis (non-leukocyte cell extravastion) Extravasation of irrigation fluid Extravasation of irrigation fluid is the unintended migration of irrigation fluid (e.g. saline) introduced into a human body. This may occur in a number of types of endoscopic surgery, such as minimally invasive orthopedic surgery, i.e. arthroscopy, TURP (trans-urethral resection of the prostate) and TCRE (trans- cervical resection of the endometrium). In arthroscopy, fluid under pressure is used to inflate and distend a joint and make a working surgical space. Arthroscopy is typically performed on shoulder and knee joints; however, hip arthroscopy is becoming more popular. Arthroscopy is done by making surgical portals or puncture wounds into the joint. A surgical instrument called an arthroscope is used to introduce irrigation fluid under pressure to distend the joint. The arthroscope includes a small (typically 4 mm in diameter) optic scope rod to view the joint. Other portals or puncture wounds are made to introduce surgical instruments to perform cutting or repair procedures. If the joint is surrounded by soft tissue, as in the shoulder and hip, fluid under pressure may leak out of the joint space through the surgical portals and collect in the patient's soft tissue. A typical arthroscopy can result in 1-3 liters of irrigation fluid being absorbed into the patient's interstitial tissue. This buildup of irrigation fluid in the soft tissue may cause edema. This swelling can interfere with the arthroscopic procedure by collapsing the surgical space, or migrating into the patient's neck and causing airway blockage. In hip arthroscopy, a feared complication is abdominal flooding where the irrigation fluid leaks from the hip joint capsule and drains into the abdominal cavity. Risk factors for fluid extravasation include procedure length (> 90-120 min), obesity, and age (> 45-50) with accompanying lack of muscle tone. Shoulder arthroscopy is typically limited to about 90-120 minutes before the swelling from fluid extravasation interferes with the procedure, and presents a potential risk to the patient. Typically, fluid extravasation is managed by controlling fluid pressure, or hastening the procedure. Arthroscopic instrumentation such as the newer Extravastat devices to drain extravasated fluid from the soft tissue during shoulder and hip arthroscopy has been reported to be beneficial in reducing fluid extravasation and swelling. Extravasation of infusates Extravasation may also refer to the leakage of infused substances from the vasculature into the subcutaneous tissue. The leakage of high-osmolarity solutions or chemotherapy agents can result in significant tissue destruction and significant complications.

He produced numerous caricatures for the magazine Vanity Fair. Biography Giles was the son of Captain Edward Giles of the Royal Navy who was stationed at Karachi. Godfrey Douglas Giles was a boarding boy at Cheltenham. He was sent to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, to launch his military career, and his first posting was in India in 1875. He saw action in the Second Afghan War with the 1st Sind Horse and the 19th Native Infantry, chiefly on the Khleat and Kandahar fronts, and according to one obituary notice, had been present at Maiwand. He certainly was present at the battle of Khuski-Nakhud in February 1879 and later painted the Charge of the Scinde Horse at Khuski-Nakhud.This painting and several sketches by Giles were reproduced in the Cavalry Journal, Vol. XIV, Jan-Oct 1924, pp. 38-47 and 167-177. He also painted a scene of E/B Battery Royal Horse Artillery at Maiwand which was exhibited in 1893. It was drawn from details supplied by RSM Paton and Sergeant Mullane, VC who had been with the battery. Battle of El Teb (Godfrey Douglas Giles) He accompanied the Gordon Relief Expedition to Sudan and commanded Turkish cavalry at El Teb. Giles also provided a sketch of the battle which was the basis for a large fold-out panorama of the battle published in The Graphic on 1 March 1884, and began painting a scene of the battle when he returned to Cairo shortly after the event. He was also present at the battle of Tamai, and later received a commission from Lieut. P.S. Marling of the 60th Rifles depicting the latter saving Private Morley of the 35th Regiment for which Marling received the Victoria Cross. Subsequently, Giles served as captain in the Loyal Suffolk Hussars and the Artists' Rifle Corps. Having attained the rank of Major, Godfrey Douglas Giles retired from the army in 1884 and went to Paris in 1885 where he studied under Carolus- Duran. He successfully exhibited paintings such as The Battle of Tamai and El Teb at the Paris Salon and the Royal Academy after which he settled in Newmarket where he was able to depict horses and horse-racing scenes. His illustrations also appeared in the weekly Black & White Budget in 1891. After the outbreak of the Boer War in South Africa in 1899, Giles was sent there as war correspondent and artist by The Graphic and the Daily Graphic, and was attached to French's 1st Cavalry Brigade. He witnessed the surrender of General Piet Cronj√© after the Battle of Paardeberg, and was present at the subsequent relief of Kimberley. Later he wrote a piece for The Graphic titled \\"With French to Kimberley and Roberts to Bloemfontein\\" which appeared in The Graphic History of the South African War. Giles contributed greatly to the pictorial record of the Boer War with works on display in museums in both South Africa and England. He was awarded the Queen's South Africa Medal on 12 February 1903. Giles died at the age of 83 in Edinburgh on 1 February 1941.

Upon returning to the Gardens, Peter is shocked to learn from the crow Solomon Caw that he is not still a bird, but more like a humanSolomon says he is crossed between them as a \\"Betwixt-and-Between\\". Unfortunately, Peter now knows he cannot fly, so he is stranded in Kensington Gardens. At first, Peter can only get around on foot, but he commissions the building of a child-sized thrush's nest that he can use as a boat to navigate the Gardens by way of the Serpentine, the large lake that divides Kensington Gardens from Hyde Park. Although he terrifies the fairies when he first arrives, Peter quickly gains favour with them. He amuses them with his human ways and agrees to play the panpipes at the fairy dances. Eventually, Queen Mab grants him the wish of his heart, and he decides to return home to his mother. The fairies reluctantly help him to fly home, where he finds his mother is asleep in his old bedroom. Peter feels rather guilty for leaving his mother, mostly because he believes she misses him terribly. He considers returning to live with her, but first decides to go back to the Gardens to say his last good-byes. Unfortunately, Peter stays too long in the Gardens, and, when he uses his second wish to go home permanently, he is devastated to learn that, in his absence, his mother has given birth to another boy she can love. Peter returns, heartbroken, to Kensington Gardens. Peter later meets a little girl named Maimie Mannering, who is lost in the Gardens. He and Maimie become fast friends, and little Peter asks her to marry him. Maimie is going to stay with him, but realises that her mother must be missing her dreadfully, so she leaves Peter to return home. Maimie does not forget Peter, however, and when she is older, she makes presents and letters for him. She even gives him an imaginary goat which he rides around every night. Maimie is the literary predecessor to the character Wendy Darling in Barrie's later Peter and Wendy story. Throughout the novel, Peter misunderstands simple things like children's games. He does not know what a pram is, mistaking it for an animal, and he becomes extremely attached to a boy's lost kite. It is only when Maimie tells him that he discovers he plays all his games incorrectly. When Peter is not playing, he likes to make graves for the children who get lost at night, burying them with little headstones in the Gardens. Related works Peter Pan statue in Kensington Gardens, London Most of the text of Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens was included as chapters 13‚Äì18 of Barrie's earlier novel The Little White Bird, published in 1902, with minor differences appearing on only nine pages of the separately published 1906 novel. The Little White Bird was published as a novel for adult readers; whereas Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens was published specifically as a children's book. Scholar Jacqueline Rose perceives, however, that the book is not so much a children's book as one for art collectors thanks to the 1906 edition's illustrations by Arthur Rackham. In 1904, Barrie wrote a stage play titled Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Would Not Grow Up, performed in December of that year, although it had not yet been published. The play is not a sequel or adaptation of the earlier novel; it is a different story, though closely based on the literary style, subtext concepts, and the Peter Pan character he had developed in The Little White Bird and Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens. In the play and later novel, Peter Pan as a character is portrayed a few years older than the Peter Pan of Kensington Gardens. The stage play became the basis for Barrie's 1911 novel Peter and Wendy (later published under the title Peter Pan and Wendy in 1921, with subsequent publications using the title Peter Pan). The script of the stage play itself was published later in 1928. Setting The story is set in Kensington Gardens, one of the London Royal Parks, mostly after \\"Lock-Out Time\\", described by Barrie as the time at the end of the day when the park gates are closed to the public. After this time the fairies, and other magical inhabitants of the park, can move about more freely than during the daylight, when they must hide from ordinary people. The fairy inhabitants of the gardens are first described in Thomas Tickell's 1722 poem Kensington Gardens. Illustrations and editions Rackham was commissioned to illustrate the book following the success of his work on the 1905 edition of Rip Van Winkle. The owners of the Leicester Galleries, Brown and Phillips, instigated a preliminary meeting between Barrie and Rackham in June 1905, and he was given almost 18 months to complete the illustrations.Derek Hudson: Arthur Rackham, His Life and Work, Heinemann, 1960, p.62James Hamilton: Arthur Rackham, A Biography (Little, Brown & Co, 1990) p.71 The first edition was released in both a trade edition and a larger signed limited edition of 500 copies. Both versions contain 50 colour plates and 3 black and white line drawings,Richard Riall: A New Bibliography of Arthur Rackham, Ross Press, Bath, 1994) p.74 which were exhibited at the Leicester Galleries from November 1906. In 1912 a revised edition containing some reworking and 9 more black and white drawings was published. This impression also differed in that the plates were placed within the text, whereas the 1906 edition placed all the images at the end of the book, after the text.Riall p.114Fred Gettings: Arthur Rackham (Studio Vista, 1975) p.178 Adaptations In 2019, theatre company Betwixt-and- Between brought Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens to Edinburgh Fringe and Moat Brae.

In 1989, he received a BS in zoology from the University of Maryland. He received a master's degree (1992) and Ph.D. (1994) in neurosciences from the University of California, San Diego, working with Glenn Northcutt.

He studies animal sensory systems, brain organization, and behavior in diverse species including star-nosed moles, water shrews, naked mole-rats, alligators and crocodiles, snakes, earthworms, and electric eels. His studies often focus on predators that have evolved special senses and weapons to find and overcome elusive prey and he is considered an expert in extreme animal behaviors. He studies specialized species because they can reveal general principles about brain organization and sensory systems. But he also believes \\"there is unappreciated beauty and elegance in the behaviors and diverse forms of these extraordinary animals\\". Catania was named a MacArthur Fellow in 2006 and in 2013 he received the Pradel Research Award in Neurosciences from the National Academy of Sciences for \\"highly imaginative investigations of the neural basis of sensory behavior in model organisms\\" and \\"discoveries of fundamental principles of behavior, sensory processing, and brain organization\\".

It can be associated with a calculus.  Mechanism An injury to the urethra leaving Buck's fascia intact results in a collection of urine (extravasation) limited to the penis, deep to Buck's fascia. However, if the injury to the bulb of the penis results in urethral injury accompanying a tear of the Buck's fascia, then extravasated blood and urine would accumulate in the superficial perineal space, passing into the penis (outer to Buck's fascia) as well as the scrotum and lower anterior abdominal wall. Extravasation of urine involving a compromised Buck's fascia can be appreciated clinically by blood collecting in the superficial pouch, resulting in a 'butterfly'-shaped region around the penis. Other Extravasation of urine due to blunt renal trauma or ureteral obstruction can lead to the formation of an urinoma.

History  At one time, Tasley was a bustling railroad town, boasting the first electric power plant, first paved road and first self- organized volunteer fire company in the county.Eastern Shore News March 12, 1997 The Shore's main highway, US 13, ran right through the middle of town. Steamships from Baltimore docked at nearby Onancock; the produce and goods were carried from there to Tasley's busy rail station for fast shipment. In its heyday, Tasley boasted three restaurants, four general stores, a hotel, post office, rail station, two tractor dealerships, two sawmills, volunteer fire company, ice plant, coal sales, car dealerships, several produce grading sheds and power plant. When the railroad ceased passenger service in 1958, the town was dealt a blow, but the coming of the Route 13 bypass in the mid-1960s robbed Tasley of its commercial and industrial status. Today, Tasley is home to A&N; Electric Cooperative, which provides electric power for the entire Eastern Shore of Virginia; the Foodbank of the Eastern Shore is headquartered there and Studebaker's Antiques sells top of the line vintage advertising items worldwide. A new fire station is being planned, and several formerly empty buildings have been purchased and repurposed.

Summary The play is set in the summer of 1878 in the mythical village of Ballybeg, County Donegal, at the house (\\"The Lodge\\") of Christopher Gore, who lives with his son David, and their longtime housekeeper Margaret.Loveridge, Charlotte (2005). \\"Home Place: A Curtain Up London Review\\". Curtain Up. curtainup.com. Retrieved 2017-09-24. Christopher is a widowed land-owner from England (\\"the home place\\" of Kent). Both he and his son David are in love with Margaret. Two guests are staying at The Lodge, Dr Richard Gore, Christopher's cousin, and Dr Gore's assistant, Perkins. Dr Gore is an anthropologist and is traveling throughout Ireland recording the physical characteristics of the locals. Dr Gore's methods and racist hypotheses ignite animosity in the town, where a despised English landlord, Lord Lifford, was recently murdered. Christopher is caught in the middle between his cousin and his allegiance to the locals. The play runs the course of a single day in Ballybeg and centers on the resurgence of the Home rule movement in Ireland. The Lifford killing is based on the actual murder of William Clements, 3rd Earl of Leitrim in April 1878.

He was twice voted American Champion Older Male Horse. Background Devil Diver was foaled at Mrs. Payne Whitney's Greentree Stable in Lexington, Kentucky. A bay colt by Sir Germans, he was out of Dabchick,http://www.pedigreequery.com/devil+diver Devil Diver‚Äôs pedigree and a member of the same foal crop as Shut Out. Devil Diver was trained by the Hall of Fame conditioner John M. Gaver, Sr., who also trained Shut Out. Racing career Both Shut Out and Devil Diver were pointed towards the 1942 Kentucky Derby, especially as Devil Diver had opened his three-year-old season winning the Phoenix Handicap and in the process beating Whirlaway who only the year before had won the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. The Hall of Fame jockey Eddie Arcaro believed Devil Diver to be the superior horse (he hadn't been out of the money in 13 starts), and so chose to ride him in the Derby only to come in sixth as Shut Out won the prestigious race under jockey Wayne Wright by two lengths over Alsab. At three, of the two best Whitney colts, Shut Out prevailed. But at four, Devil Diver came into his own, living up to the promise of his two-and-three year old seasons. At the end of 1943 he was named Champion Handicap Horse by the Daily Racing Form although the rival Turf & Sports Digest award went to Market Wise. In 1944 he was named Champion Handicap Horse in both major polls. In 1944, he came close to American Horse of the Year but lost the Pimlico Special to the filly Twilight Tear in a three horse race that included the very good Megogo.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nc9HAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=fP8MAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1049,484308&dq;=twilight- tear+devil-diver&hl;=en Devil Diver holds a record that has so far never been broken. He won the Metropolitan Handicap in three consecutive years: 1943, 1944, and 1945. One of those wins, 1944, was accomplished under an unbroken record weight of 134 pounds. In his Suburban Handicap win, he gave the champion Stymie thirteen pounds. In 1944, the five-year-old Devil Diver won seven stakes race and in each he carried more than 130 pounds. Better with age, at five he competed at a variety of distances under a variety of weights, all heavy. In his last year, he was voted handicap horse of the season in both polls. Stud record Devil Diver stood at stud at Greentree Farm. He was not outstanding, but over the years sired 18 stakes winners including Beau Diable, Call Over, Lotowhite, and the good broodmare Anchors Aweigh. Devil Diver died in 1961.

He was known throughout Oregon as a witty and wise cowboy philosopher.Oregon Public Broadcasting, \\"The Oregon Experience: Reub Long‚Äôs Oregon Desert\\", first broadcast 30 October 2006 In 1964, he joined E.R. Jackman to write The Oregon Desert, which is still a very popular book forty years after its original publication.  Early life  Reub was born in Lakeview, Oregon on 26 January 1898. His parents bought a ranch in the Fort Rock Valley approximately one hundred and twenty miles north of Lakeview in 1900. The family's ranch was so isolated that they only made the round-trip to Prineville once a year to get supplies. On one of those trips, Reub bought his first saddle for $13.50 using money he had made trading livestock and selling coyote hides. At the time, he was seven years old.Jackman, E.R. and R.A. Long,The Oregon Desert, Canton Press, Caldwell, Idaho: 1964.Friedman, Ralph, \\"The Sage of Fort Rock\\", A Touch of Oregon, Pars Publishing Company, Portland, Oregon, 1970, pp.117-122.\\"Reuben Long, desert writer, rancher, dies\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 30 July 1974, p. 5. The Long ranch had alkaline soil and insufficient water to produce good vegetables. When he was eleven, his parents sent him to the Summer Lake area during the summer to raise a garden. The garden was forty miles south of the ranch, but Reub made a round trip every three days. The first day, he would ride his horse to the garden site. The next day he tended and watered the garden, and then he rode home on the third day. In the fall, Reub's family gathered two wagon loads of vegetables from his garden. Reub had an older brother, Everett, and a younger sister, Anna. The Long children first attended school in Silver Lake. This required them to ride horses eleven mile to school each day, and then another eleven miles to get home each evening. Later, they attended school at a neighboring ranch only three mile from their home. Reub attended high school in Silver Lake, but only when he was not working. As a result, he never finished high school. Rancher Reub lived his entire life on his ranch, adjacent to Fort Rock (now a state park) in northern Lake County. The ranch covered several thousand acres where he raised cattle and allowed wild horses to run free. Ranch life also provided the raw material for his good natured humor. > Once, after standing on the top rails of a corral above the thick dust > covering a bunch of running horses, almost all of them paints, he dropped to > the ground as the gate swung shut and announced, \\"By golly, boys, I'm a rich > man; I've got 42 head of horses!\\" A woman standing close by looked at him in > utter amazement and blurted out, \\"How could you count all those horses, Mr. > Long ... Why ... There was so much dust you couldn't see your hand in front > of your face.\\" Reub looked at the woman almost apologetically and said, \\"Why > it was easy, ma'am, I just counted all the legs and divided by four.\\" In 1938, a team of archeologists from the University of Oregon led by Luther Cressman excavated the Fort Rock Cave located on his ranch.Hatton, Raymond R., High Desert of Central Oregon, Binford and Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1977, pp. 87-89. The team found sandals made of bark and sagebrush that carbon dating proved were 9,300 to 10,500 years old. At the time, these were the oldest human artifacts ever found in North America.Cressman, Luther S., The Sandal and the Cave: Indians of Oregon , Northwest Reprints Series, Oregon State University Press, Corvallis, Oregon: 2005.Tucker, Kathy, \\"Fort Rock Sandals\\" , Oregon History Project, Oregon Historical Society, 2002 The success of the Cressman dig was widely publicized, and as the team's local host, Reub and his stories shared the spotlight.Brogan, Phil F., \\"Geographic Board okays naming cave after Long\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 16 June 1975. When Hollywood film crews came to central Oregon to shoot westerns, Reub supplied horses, wagons, and other ranch equipment. He helped film makers scout locations and advised them on pioneer life. Reub and his wife, Eleanor, also worked as movie extras in two films. Because he was an expert at handling horse teams, Reub participated in a wild and dangerous chase scene in the movie The Indian Fighter with ten covered wagons racing across the desert. Over the years, he participated in three films: Canyon Passage, The Way West, and The Indian Fighter. During these productions, Reub got to know a number of well-known actors including Dana Andrews, Lloyd Bridges, Ward Bond, Andy Devine, Brian Donlevy, Kirk Douglas, and Susan Hayward. Over the years, Reub had considerable influence on a wide range of public policy decisions. He served on a Bureau of Land Management advisory board for many years. He also used his influence to persuade the Bonneville Power Administration and the Federal Government's Rural Electrification Administration to bring electricity to the Fort Rock Valley. As a result, the rural communities of Fort Rock and Silver Lake, Oregon in northern Lake County were connected to the national power grid in 1955.LaLande, Jeff, \\"For Better and For Worse, Part of the Wider World: World War II and the Post-War Boom\\", Oregon History Project, Oregon History Project, Oregon Historical Society, 2005 Throughout his life, Long was a strong advocate and supporter of agricultural education. He was a longtime member of the Oregon's State Board of Agriculture, serving as its chairman for a term.\\"The Reub A. Long Professorship\\", The Campaign for OSU, Oregon State University Foundation, www.campaignforosu.org, Corvallis, Oregon, 24 January 2009. Sage of Fort Rock In 1964, a collection of Reub's anecdotal stories was compiled into a book, co-written with E.R. Jackman. The book, titled The Oregon Desert, recounts with good humor the places, events, animals, and people that made up Reub's Eastern Oregon world. The book \\"successfully blended natural science with cowboy humor and scholarly prose with casual meanderings. It was a celebration of rural Western storytelling, and over the years, it has become a Pacific Northwest classic.\\" As of 2003, the book was in its fourteenth printing. Reub's philosophy was always practical and touched with humor. When he told a story, one topic led to another and then another without a break. > ‚Ä¶You can usually get along if you aren't a specialist. Nowadays men list > their jobs as \\"freight car wheel inspectors\\" or \\"bottle fillers,\\" and if > those particular jobs aren't available, the men are eligible for > unemployment checks.

What you > learn from horses helps in dealing with humans. A horse is good for a boy or > a man. It helps something inside of him. A man trained by a horse for many > years is never quite the same afterward, and is better. Reub died on 28 July 1974. His stories and anecdotes about life in rural Eastern Oregon are his legacy. They have been widely recorded and are often retold. As a result, Reub Long is still one of Oregon's best-known story tellers.Tonsfeldt, Ward and Paul G. Claeyssens, \\"Telling Stories\\", Oregon History Project, Oregon Historical Society, 2004.  Legacy  During his lifetime, Long donated property to the State of Oregon to establish the Fort Rock State Natural Area. He also created a trust that endowed a professorship at Oregon State University's College of Agricultural Sciences. In December 1974, the Oregon Geographic Names Board named a mountain in northern Lake County in Long's honor. Reub Long Butte is a volcanic cone with twin craters. It overlooks Devil's Garden and the Fort Rock Valley to the south. Its highest point is above sea level.Brogan, Phil F., \\"Name of volcano may honor author\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 22 September 1974, p. 31.\\"Name to Honor Rancher-Author\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 14 December 1974, p.

He is the manager of the Offaly senior hurling team. Kelly played for club side Lusmagh and was a member of the Offaly senior hurling team for 19 seasons, during which time he usually lined out at midfield. Kelly began his hurling career at club level with Lusmagh. He broke onto the club's top adult team as a 15-year-old in 1971 and enjoyed his first success in 1973 when the club won the Offaly Junior Championship. Kelly later won an Offaly Senior Championship medal in 1989 when Lusmagh won their first and only title. He ended his club career with the Lusmagh junior B in 2003. At inter-county level, Kelly began his career at minor level in 1973 before progressing onto the Offaly under-21 team. He joined the Offaly senior team in 1974. From his debut, Kelly lined out in a variety of positions, including midfield, half- forward, corner-forward and centre-back, and made a record 171 National League and Championship appearances in a career that ended with his last game in 1993. During that time he was part of two All-Ireland Championship-winning teams ‚Äì in 1981, 1985. Kelly also secured seven Leinster Championship medals and a National Hurling League medal. He announced his retirement from inter- county hurling on 15 September 1993. Kelly won his first All-Star in 1980, before claiming a further All-Star in 1984. At inter-provincial level, Kelly was selected to play in several championship campaigns with Leinster, with his sole Railway Cup medal being won in 1979. As a manager, selector, coach and trainer, Kelly has previously worked with club sides Lusmagh, Loughmore- Castleiney, Kilcormac-Killoughey, Portumna, Shinrone and Coolderry, and inter- county teams Westmeath, Wexford and Roscommon. Playing career Lusmagh Kelly joined the Lusmagh club at a young age and played in all grades at juvenile and underage levels. He was still eligible for the minor grade when he joined the club's top adult team during the 1971 Offaly Junior Championship. On 26 November 1973, Kelly was at wing-forward when Lusmagh faced Ballinamere in the final of the Offaly Junior Championship. He top- scored with 3-01 in the 6-03 to 3-05 victory. On 10 October 1982, lined out at centre-forward when Lusmagh faced St. Rynagh's in their very first Offaly Senior Championship final. He scored a point from play but ended on the losing side following a 2-09 to 0-11 defeat. When Lusmagh qualified for their next final on 22 October 1989, Kelly was switched from the forwards to midfield as well as being player-manager. He remained scoreless throughout the game but collected a winners' medal following a 1-11 to 1-10 defeat of Seir Kieran. On 1 November 1992, Kelly lined out in a third and final Offaly Senior Championship final. He scored 0-02 but ended on the losing side following a 0-10 to 0-09 defeat by St. Rynagh's. Offaly =Senior= Kelly joined the Offaly senior team prior to the start of the 1974-75 National League. He made his first appearance for the team when he lined out at left wing-forward in a 5-03 to 3-08 defeat of Antrim on 13 October 1974. Kelly made his first appearance in the Leinster Championship on 22 June when he was selected at right corner-forward for the 6-06 to 4-12 draw with Kildare. On 13 July 1980, Kelly lined out at midfield when Offaly faced Kilkenny in what was only their second Leinster final appearance in 50 years. He scored a point from play in the 3-17 to 5-10 victory in what was Offaly's first ever provincial title. Kelly ended the season by claiming a first All-Star award. On 12 July 1981, Kelly won a second successive Leinster Championship following Offaly's 3-12 to 2-13 defeat of Wexford in the final. This victory gave Offaly a straight passage to the All-Ireland final against reigning champions Galway on 6 September. Kelly lined out at midfield and collected an All-Ireland winners' medal following the 2-12 to 0-15 victory. Kelly lined out in his by now customary position of midfield when Offaly qualified for a third successive Leinster final on 25 July 1982. Offaly suffered their first provincial defeat in three seasons following a 1-11 to 0-12 defeat by Kilkenny. On 10 July 1983, Kelly lined out at midfield in a fourth successive Leinster final. He scored a point from play in the 1-17 to 0-13 defeat by reigning champions Kilkenny. Offaly reached a sixth successive Leinster final on 8 July 1984, with Kelly once again lining out at midfield. He collected a third winners' medal following the 1-15 to 2-11 defeat of Wexford. Offaly subsequently qualified for an All-Ireland final-meeting with Cork at Semple Stadium on 2 September. Kelly was held scoreless from midfield in the 3-16 to 1-12 defeat. He ended the season with a second All-Star award. On 21 July 1985, Kelly lined out at midfield in his sixth successive Leinster final. He claimed a fourth winners' medal following the 5-15 to 0-17 defeat of Laois. Kelly retained his position at midfield for the All-Ireland final against Galway on 1 September 1985. He remained scoreless throughout the game but collected a second All-Ireland medal following a 2-11 to 1-12 victory. Offaly qualified for an eighth successive Leinster final on 13 July 1986. Kelly was again at midfield, however, he ended up on the losing side following a 4-10 to 1-11 defeat by Kilkenny. For the ninth successive season, Offaly qualified for the Leinster final on 2 August 1987 with Kelly lining out at midfield. Kilkenny ended that game as champions following a 2-14 to 0-17 victory. Offaly continued their dominance of the Leinster Championship by qualifying for a tenth successive final on 10 July 1988. Kelly claimed a fifth winners' medal overall - his first in three seasons - following a 3-12 to 1-14 defeat of Wexford. On 9 July 1989, Kelly lined out in his 11th Leinster final. He scored a point from midfield and collected a sixth winners' medal following the 3-15 to 4-09 defeat of Kilkenny. For the 12th successive season, Offaly qualified for the Leinster final on 1 July 1990 with Kelly lining out at midfield. He scored a point from play and collected a seventh winners' medal following the 1-19 to 2-11 defeat of Dublin. 1991 began well as Offaly captured their first National League title, however, Offaly surrendered their provincial crown to Kilkenny. Kelly played his final championship game for Offaly against Kilkenny in the Leinster semi-final of 1993. Leinster Kelly also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He won one Railway Cup title following a victory over Connacht in 1979. Managerial career Early career Four years before his retirement from inter-county hurling Kelly had already ventured into hurling management. He broke his leg in 1990 which ruled him out of playing for some time. To stay involved in the game he took charge of the Westmeath senior hurling team. In his first year in charge Westmeath won promotion to Division 2 of the National League. In Kelly's second year in charge his team won the All-Ireland 'B' title in Croke Park. After his two- year stint with the Westmeath Kelly joined √âamonn Cregan's Offaly backroom team in 1995. He remained a selector for just over a year, having tendered his resignation after the Leinster final defeat to Wexford in July 1996. At club level Kelly had a two-year spell as manager of Loughmore-Castleiney in Tipperary. In 1997 he devoted his time to the management of Kilcormac- Killoughey. In 1999, he managed the Wexford senior hurling team for one season, ending in a heavy championship defeat to Offaly. In 2008 Joachim was announced as manager of the Offaly Junior Camogie Team which is their main team. In his first year they reached the All-Ireland Junior Camogie Final. They lost to Clare after a late late goal by Shonagh Enright. However just one year later in 2009 they did in fact capture the All-Ireland Camogie title. He has been announced as the trainer for Roscommon senior hurling team for 2014, working with manager Justin Campbell, a former Galway hurler. Coolderry Kelly took over as manager of the Coolderry senior hurling team prior to the start of the 2018 Offaly Senior Championship. On 7 October, he guided the club to their 31st Offaly Senior Championship following a 2-17 to 0-17 defeat of Kilcormac/Killoughey in the final. Offaly Kelly was appointed interim manager of the Offaly senior hurling team on 20 May 2019, following Kevin Martin's removal from the position.

Initially famous as the author of Lettres d'une P√©ruvienne, a novel published in 1747, she became the world's best-known living woman writer after the success of her sentimental comedy C√©nie in 1750. Her reputation as a dramatist suffered when her second play at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, La Fille d'Aristide, was a flop in 1758, and even her novel fell out of favor after 1830. From then until the last third of the twentieth century, she was almost forgotten, but thanks to new scholarship and the interest in women writers generated by the feminist movement, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny is now regarded as a significant French writer of the eighteenth century. Early life, marriage, and widowhood in Lorraine Fran√ßoise d‚ÄôIssembourg d‚ÄôHapponcourt was born in Nancy, in the duchy of Lorraine.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 1. Her father, Fran√ßois d‚ÄôHapponcourt, was a cavalry officer. Her mother, Marguerite Callot, was a great-niece of the famous Lorraine artist Jacques Callot. While she was still a girl, her family moved to Saint-Nicolas-de-Port, where her father was commander of the duke of Lorraine's horse guards.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 8-10. On 19 January 1712, not yet seventeen years old, Mademoiselle d'Happoncourt was married in the church of Saint-Nicolas-de-Port to Fran√ßois Huguet, a young officer in the duke's service.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 11-15. He was a son of the wealthy mayor of Neufch√¢teau, Jean Huguet. Like her father, he was an √©cuyer or squire, the lowest rank of nobility. In honor of the marriage, the groom received from his father the estate at Graffigny and the couple took the title \\"de Graffigny\\" as their name. On her side, the bride received a large house inherited by her mother from Jacques Callot, situated in Villers-l√®s-Nancy, where the couple lived for about six years.Jacques Choux, Dictionnaire des ch√¢teaux de France: Lorraine. Paris: Berger-Levrault, 1978. \\"Villers-l√®s-Nancy\\", p. 238. Fran√ßois de Graffigny seemed to have a promising future, and the couple produced three children within five years: Charlotte-Antoinette (born June 1713, died December 1716); Jean-Jacques (born March 1715, lived only a few days) and Marie-Th√©r√®se (born March 1716, died December 1717).Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 15-16. But he was a gambler, drunk and wife-beater, who was jailed for domestic violence. In 1718, deeply in debt and already living apart, the Graffignys signed a document, which gave her authority to deal with the family's finances and required him to leave Lorraine for Paris. In 1723 she obtained a legal separation.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 16-19. He died in 1725, under mysterious circumstances.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 20-21. As a widow, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny was free from her brutal husband, but she never fully recovered from the financial losses or the emotional trauma of her marriage. Fran√ßoise de Graffigny's mother died in 1727, and her father remarried just months afterward, and moved to a remote town in Lorraine, where he too died in 1733, leaving his daughter free of all family obligations.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 1. By that date, the court of Lorraine had moved to Lun√©ville, where she lived with the support of the duke's widow, the dowager duchess and regent, √âlisabeth Charlotte d'Orl√©ans.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 22-24. There she met a dashing cavalry officer, L√©opold Desmarest, thirteen years her junior, whose father Henry Desmarest was in charge of the court's music; around 1727 he and Fran√ßoise de Graffigny began a passionate affair which lasted until 1743.Michel Antoine. Henry Desmarest (1661-1741): Biographie Critique. Paris: Picard, 1965, pp. 167-69. She also met an even younger man, Fran√ßois-Antoine Devaux, who had trained to become a lawyer but dreamed of being a writer; known to everyone as Panpan, he became her closest friend and confidant, and in 1733 they began a correspondence that continued until her death.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 26-29. This idyllic period came to an end in 1737, when duke Fran√ßois-√âtienne de Lorraine ceded his duchy to France to obtain French support for his marriage to Maria Theresa of Austria. Fran√ßoise de Graffigny's friends and protectors were dispersed and she herself had nowhere to go.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 25, 31-32. From Lorraine to Paris Finally in 1738 she arranged to become a companion to the duchesse de Richelieu; this lady had been Marie-√âlisabeth-Sophie de Lorraine, princesse de Guise, before her marriage in April 1734.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 32. Fran√ßoise de Graffigny planned to join them in Paris in spring 1739, but she needed to bridge the winter months, and wheedled an invitation to Cirey, the ch√¢teau where √âmilie, marquise du Ch√¢telet, had been living since 1734 with her lover, Voltaire.Ren√© Vaillot, Avec Mme Du Ch√¢telet, Oxford: Voltaire Foundation, 1988, pp. 93-115. The journey from Lun√©ville to Cirey took two and half months; she stopped at Commercy, where the dowager duchess of Lorraine and her court had moved into the famous ch√¢teau, and at Demange-aux-Eaux she stayed with a friend, the marquise de Stainville, mother of the future duc de Choiseul.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 33-39. Her two-month stay at Cirey has been the best-known part of her life, because the thirty-odd letters she wrote about it to Devaux were published in 1820.La Vie priv√©e de Voltaire et de Mme Du Ch√¢telet, Paris, 1820. The letters were, however, inaccurately transcribed, severely cut, revised and in fact added to by the anonymous 1820 editor. He or she inserted anecdotes and witticisms to make Voltaire seem more illustrious, and took every opportunity to show Fran√ßoise de Graffigny as a sentimental, foolish and irresponsible gossip.English Showalter, \\"Graffigny at Cirey: A Fraud Exposed.\\" French Forum 21, 1 (January 1996), pp. 29-44. The first few weeks at Cirey seemed like a wonderful dream come true. Voltaire read from his works in progress and joined in performances of his plays. The hostess, √âmilie, showed off her estate, her furnishings, her clothes and jewelry, and her formidable learning. There were constant visitors, including luminaries like the scientist-philosopher Pierre Louis Maupertuis. The conversation ranged over every topic imaginable, always enlivened by Voltaire's sparkling wit. Yet trouble was brewing. Voltaire read from his scandalous burlesque poem about Joan of Arc, La Pucelle. √âmilie intercepted a letter from Devaux which mentioned the work, leapt to the false conclusion that her guest had copied a canto and circulated it, and accused her of treachery. For a month after that, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny was a virtual prisoner at Cirey, until her lover Desmarest passed through en route to Paris and took her on the final leg of her journey.Dainard, ed., Correspondance, vol. 1, letters 60-91.  Paris  Her plan to live as companion to the duchesse de Richelieu worked only for a short time, because the duchess died of tuberculosis in August 1740.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 47-62. She then lived as a boarder in two convents, and stayed with a wealthy friend.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 63-80. Finally, in autumn 1742, she rented her own house on the rue Saint-Hyacinthe.This street no longer exists. It was located in the present 6th arrondissement, near the rue Soufflot and the boulevard Saint-Michel. These first years in Paris were difficult, but not unproductive. She began to make new friends, the most important being the actress Jeanne Quinault, who retired from the stage in 1741, and began to receive her friends from the literary world at casual dinners, called the \\"Bout-du-Banc\\".Judith Curtis, \\"Divine Thalie\\": the career of Jeanne Quinault, SVEC 2007:08. \\"Bout-du-banc\\" means literally \\"end of the bench\\" but idiomatically something like \\"potluck\\". Through Jeanne Quinault, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny met most of the authors writing in Paris in this era ‚Äì Louis de Cahusac, Claude Cr√©billon, Charles Coll√©, Philippe N√©ricault Destouches, Charles Pinot Duclos, Barth√©lemy-Christophe Fagan, Jean-Baptiste- Louis Gresset, Pierre de Marivaux, Fran√ßois-Augustin de Paradis de Moncrif, Pierre-Claude Nivelle de La Chauss√©e, Alexis Piron, Claude Henri de Fuz√©e de Voisenon, and others ‚Äì as well as nobles who enjoyed their company and dabbled in writing themselves, like comte de Caylus, comte de Maurepas, duc de Nivernais, comte de Pont-de-Veyle, and comte de Saint-Florentin. Her lover Desmarest was away much of the time with his regiment, and was trapped in the besieged city of Prague in late 1741; when he returned to Paris without funds to re-equip himself, he accepted money from his mistress even though he had already decided to leave her. The emotional shock of his betrayal never fully healed, but his departure left her free to pursue her own ambitions.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 75-80. She moved into her new house on 27 November 1742. In the summer of 1743 she sublet an upper floor apartment to Pierre Valler√©, a lawyer, and had a brief but intense fling with him, the only liaison besides Desmarest she mentions in her letters.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 81-84. Although relations between them were often strained, he remained with her, as her lodger, legal adviser, and companion, until her death; and he was the principal executor of her will. Her finances remained a problem; in 1744 she staked her hopes on an investment that proved unsound, and she found herself in early 1746 deeper in debt than ever.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 93-106. Writer Yet this was the time when she began the work that would eventually bring her fame and material comfort, if not wealth. As early as 1733, her letters to Devaux mention writing projects, some his, some joint, and some hers. When she went to Paris, she carried with her several of her manuscripts, including a sentimental drama called L'Honn√™te Homme (The Honest Man), an allegorical comedy called La R√©union du Bon-sens et de l'Esprit (The Reunion of Common Sense and Wit), and a verse comedy called H√©raclite, pr√©tendu sage (Heraclitus, alleged sage). In her letters she also mentions a traditional comedy called L'√âcole des amis (The School for friends), a fantastic comedy called Le Monde vrai (The Truthful World) and a short supernatural novel called Le Sylphe (The Sylph). None of these works was ever published, and some of them were destroyed, but others survive in manuscript or in fragments among her papers.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 128-31. Her fellow participants at Jeanne Quinault's Bout-du-Banc insisted that she contribute a piece to their next collective work. Comte de Caylus gave her the outline of a \\"nouvelle espagnole\\", a type of short fiction in vogue since the seventeenth century, which she developed on her own. The volume appeared in March 1745, with the title Recueil de ces Messieurs (Anthology by these Gentlemen); her story was called Nouvelle espagnole ou Le mauvais exemple produit autant de vertus que de vices (Spanish novella, or A bad example leads to as many virtues as vices). Fran√ßoise de Graffigny's contribution was singled out for praise.Smith, \\"Composition,\\" pp. 131-36. This success encouraged her to accept another task from Caylus, the outline of a fairy tale with the title La Princesse Azerolle, published later in 1745 in a collection called Cinq Contes de f√©es (Five Fairy Tales). Although several of her friends knew of her authorship, La Princesse Azerolle was never publicly attributed to Fran√ßoise de Graffigny until the recent publication of her correspondence.Smith, \\"Composition,\\" pp. 136-41. Both of these early short works deserve to be better known. Her confidence restored with the two short stories, she began writing two more substantial works, an epistolary novel, published in December 1747 as Lettres d'une P√©ruvienne (Letters from a Peruvian Woman), and a sentimental comedy, staged in June 1750 as C√©nie. The inspiration for the novel came from seeing a performance of Alzire, Voltaire's play set during the Spanish conquest of Peru; immediately afterwards, in May 1743, she began to read the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega's History of the Incas, which supplied most of the historical background for her story. She was also following Montesquieu's device of a foreign visitor in France as in the Lettres Persanes (Persian Letters).Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 142-58. Vera L. Grayson, \\"The Genesis and Reception of Mme de Graffigny's Lettres d'une P√©ruvienne and C√©nie.\\" Studies on Voltaire 336 (1996), pp. 1-152. Her novel was an immediate success with readers; by the end of 1748 there were fourteen editions, including three of an English translation. Over the next hundred years, more than 140 editions appeared, including an edition in 1752 revised and expanded by the author, several different English translations, two in Italian, and others in German, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish.Smith, \\"Popularity\\". McEachern and Smith, \\"Mme de Graffigny's Lettres d'une P√©ruvienne.\\" After the success of Lettres d'une P√©ruvienne, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny was a celebrity. Thanks largely to her fame, she found new protectors, and her financial situation improved.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 159-210. With renewed energy and self-assurance, she turned her attention to her play, C√©nie. Its composition was more complicated than that of the novel, because she consulted more friends, and getting a work staged required more steps than getting a manuscript published. The premiere took place on 25 June 1750; the play was an instant hit.Grayson, \\"Genesis and Reception\\". Measured by the number of first- run performances, the number of spectators, and the box office receipts, it was one of the ten most successful new plays of the eighteenth century in France.Claude Alasseur, La Com√©die Fran√ßaise au 18e si√®cle, √©tude √©conomique, Paris, La Haye: Mouton, 1967. John Lough, Paris Theatre Audiences, London: Oxford University Press, 1957. A. Joannid√®s, La Com√©die Fran√ßaise de 1680 √† 1900, Paris: Plon-Nourrit, 1901. It was helped by the novelty of having a woman as author, and by the vogue of com√©die larmoyante (tear-jerking comedy). It was revived several times in the next few years, but quickly faded from the repertory. The author's reputation was damaged by the failure of her second play, La Fille d'Aristide (Aristides' Daughter), which was withdrawn soon after its premiere on 27 April 1758.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 313-19. Salon hostess Madame de Graffigny's fame also made her house a popular place for social gatherings, and she was one of the important salon hostesses in mid-century Paris.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 233-51. She was assisted by the presence of her cousin's daughter, Anne-Catherine de Ligniville, a charming young woman whose high nobility and low wealth seemed to condemn her to a convent or a marriage of convenience. Fran√ßoise de Graffigny brought her from a provincial convent to Paris in September 1746, and played a major role in arranging her love-match marriage to the financier philosopher Claude Adrien Helv√©tius on 17 August 1751.D. W. Smith et al., eds., Correspondance g√©n√©rale d'Helv√©tius, Oxford: Voltaire Foundation, 1981, vol. 1. Earlier that same summer, she moved from her house on the rue Saint- Hyacinthe to another on the rue d'Enfer, with an entrance into the Luxembourg Garden.The rue d'Enfer no longer exists; it was incorporated into the boulevard Saint-Michel. Here she received her friends, visitors from all over Europe, and many of the most famous French writers and political figures of the era, including d'Alembert, Diderot, Fontenelle, Montesquieu, Pr√©vost, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Turgot, and Voltaire.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 252-90. She died peacefully at home in Paris on 12 December 1758, after suffering a seizure while playing cards with three old friends.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 325-29. She had been in failing health for a long time. It took Valler√© and others ten years to settle her estate; she left many debts, but in the end her assets covered them all.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 329-33. Her relations with Devaux had cooled over the years, and their correspondence was interrupted by quarrels several times in the 1750s; nevertheless, she continued to write to him until the eve of her death.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 291-312. Although he never undertook the project of editing their letters, a fantasy they had often discussed, he preserved the collection of their letters and her manuscripts.Showalter, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny, p. 334-39. Most of the collection is now in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University, and other parts of it are in the Morgan Library in New York and the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. Beginning in 1985, a team headed by J. A. Dainard has been publishing her letters for the first time. They may well prove to be her most important work, because of her insider's view of French literary life in the heyday of the Age of Enlightenment, her unprecedentedly detailed and intimate account of a woman's life in eighteenth-century France, and her lively colloquial style. Name As explained above, \\"Graffigny\\" is not a family name, but the name of an estate. Spelling was not standardized in the eighteenth century, and one finds the name written and printed many ways. The author herself usually wrote it \\"Grafigny\\". As the Lorraine scholar Georges Mangeot pointed out long ago, however, the place name has been standardized as \\"Graffigny\\" (it is now part of Graffigny-Chemin), and that spelling should be followed.\\"Une Biographie de Mme de Graffigny\\", Pays lorrain 11 (1914-1919), pp. 65-77, 145-153.

The C√©sar website lists La Brioche and Les Effets de la pr√©vention, which were provisional titles for early versions of La Fille d'Aristide. *A play titled Le Fils l√©gitime, drame en 3 actes en prose, was published with the address Lausanne: Grasset, in 1771, and attributed by the publisher to Fran√ßoise de Graffigny. The publisher does not explain the provenance of the manuscript. There is no mention of the play in the alleged author's correspondence and no manuscript of it among her papers. It is probable that she was not the author, and that the publisher put her name on the titlepage, hoping to capitalize on her reputation. *The works of Raoul Henri Cl√©ment Auguste Antoine Marquis, who was born in 1863 in Graffigny-Chemin, died in 1934, and wrote under the pen name Henry de Graffigny, are sometimes confused with those of Fran√ßoise de Graffigny. Henry was immensely prolific, and wrote more than two hundred books, ranging from serious works on aviation, chemistry and engineering for a general audience, to science fiction, adventure stories, and theater. Henry, not Fran√ßoise, wrote Culotte rouge.

M. Barrie, ranging in tone from fantasy and whimsy to social comedy with dark, aggressive undertones. It was published in November 1902, by Hodder & Stoughton in the UK and Scribner's in the US, although the latter had released it serially in the monthly Scribner's Magazine from August to November. The book attained prominence and longevity thanks to several chapters written in a softer tone than the rest of the book, which introduced the character and mythology of Peter Pan. In 1906, those chapters were published separately as a children's book, Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens. The Peter Pan story began as one chapter and grew to an \\"elaborate book-within-a-book\\" of more than one hundred pages during the four years Barrie worked on The Little White Bird. The complete book has also been published under the title The Little White Bird, or Adventures in Kensington Gardens. Plot introduction The Little White Bird is a series of short episodes, including both accounts of the narrator's day-to-day activities in contemporary London and fanciful tales set in Kensington Gardens and elsewhere. Plot summary The story is set in several locations; the earlier chapters are set in the town of London, contemporaneous to the time of Barrie's writing, and involving some time travel of a few years, and other fantasy elements, while remaining within the London setting. The middle chapters that later became Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens are set in London's famous Kensington Gardens, introduced by the statement that \\"All perambulators lead to Kensington Gardens\\". The Kensington Gardens chapters include detailed descriptions of the features of the Gardens, along with fantasy names given to the locations by the story's characters, especially after \\"Lock-Out Time\\", described by Barrie as the time at the end of the day when the park gates are closed to the public, and the fairies and other magical inhabitants of the park can move about more freely than during the daylight, when they must hide from ordinary people. The third section of the book, following the Kensington Gardens chapters, are again set generally in London, though there are some short returns to the Gardens that are not part of the Peter Pan stories. In a two-page diversion in chapter 24, Barrie brings the story to Patagonia, and a journey by ship returning to England at the \\"white cliffs of Albion\\". Characters * Captain W____, the first person narrator, described by author and filmmaker Andrew Birkin as \\"Barrie thinly disguised\\". Captain W____, although narrating the story, also refers to his own writing of the story, within the story, when in the book's conclusion, he gives the newly completed manuscript to the character Mary (mother of David and later Barbara, who has just been born), explaining to her that it is the story of her and her children, which she apparently wanted to write before her daughter was born and which she would have called \\"The Little White Bird\\". * David, A boy child, 6 years old at the start of the book, but who appears at various ages throughout the story, ranging from an unborn baby in the womb to a baby, infant, and up to age 6. The character is based on George Llewelyn Davies, one of several children of the Davies family who provided inspiration for many characters in Barrie's writings. * Mary A____, \\"The Little Nursery Governess\\", David's mother, who shares a name with Barrie's wife (born Mary Ansell) but according to Birkin is \\"closely modelled\\" on Sylvia Llewelyn Davies. During the story, Captain W____ sees Mary progress from young lover, to newlywed, through pregnancy and the birth of David, and as a young mother. The narrator's feelings expressed towards and about Mary vary from affection to anger and jealousy as he competes with her for David's affections. * Peter Pan, A magical boy who escaped from being human as an infant, and ever since flies about and cavorts with fairies. He differs from the better known portrayal of the character, primarily being only a week old rather than an older child. * Maimie Mannering, a four-year-old girl who becomes one of Peter Pan's main cohorts in the Kensington Gardens part of the story. Her part of the adventure begins when she gets stuck inside Kensington Gardens after \\"lock-out time\\" because the fairies changed the large clock in the garden to show an earlier hour, in preparation for the fairy ball planned for that night. The Mamie character is the literary forerunner of the Wendy Darling character of the later Peter Pan play and novel. * Porthos, a very large St Bernard, based on Barrie's dog of the same name; Porthos was the literary forerunner of the character Nana, a Newfoundland appearing in the Peter Pan play and novel as the Darling family's nursemaid. Major themes The main theme of the book is an exploration of the intimate emotional relationship of the narrator, a childless Victorian era retired soldier and London bachelor, with a young boy born to a working-class married couple in the same neighbourhood. The narrator secretly assists the couple financially, while meeting with the young boy in various \\"adventures\\", presented in a disjointed series of episodes in the book in which the narrator seeks to find a feeling of closeness with the boy, expressed as a desire for fatherhood, as well as other less clearly defined ideas. Peter Hollindale, professor of English and Education Studies at the University of York (retired, 1999), has written extensively about James Barrie and the Peter Pan stories. He states that while modern psychology enables readers to find hints of various abnormalities in the story, it also remains \\"strangely innocent and asexual\\". Literary significance and reception The Little White Bird is best known for its introduction of the character Peter Pan. Although it is one of Barrie's better-known works based on that association, it has been eclipsed by the 1904 stage play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, which introduced the characters of Wendy, Captain Hook, and Tinker Bell, along with much of the Neverland mythos. The later version of the character has been the basis of all popular adaptations and expansions of the material. The stage play became the basis for the 1911 novel Peter and Wendy, later published under the titles Peter Pan and Peter Pan and Wendy. The script of the stage play itself was first published in 1928. Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens Illustration for Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens by Arthur Rackham, 1906 Following the highly successful debut of the play about Peter Pan in 1904, Barrie's publishers, Hodder and Stoughton, extracted chapters 13‚Äì18 of The Little White Bird and published them in 1906 under the title Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, with illustrations by Arthur Rackham. The text of this version is almost identical to those chapters, with minor changes to the text to read better without the surrounding story. It was presented as a book for children, many of whom had experienced Peter Pan's exploits in the successful stage play. Although sometimes described as a prelude or (less correctly) prequel to the better- known story told in the play and novel, there are inconsistencies which make the two stories incompatible with each other. Most significant is the character of Peter Pan himself, who is said to be only seven days old, and there isn't \\"the slightest chance of his ever having [a birthday]\\"; in the later story his age is never specified, except that he has his baby teeth and is portrayed as school age.

As a provisional unit, it may be activated or inactivated at any time. It was last known to be active from 14 March ‚Äì 30 April 2008 at Balotesti, Romania, serving briefly as the USAF headquarters for a NATO Summit. During World War II, the group's predecessor unit, the 323d Bombardment Group (Medium) was a B-26 Marauder bombardment group assigned to the Eighth and later Ninth Air Force. History Air Force Reserve The wing was first activated as the 323d Bombardment Wing at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma in June 1949 when Continental Air Command implemented the wing base organization for its reserve units, uniting support organizations and the 323d Bombardment Group under a single headquarters. The wing was ordered to active duty on 10 March 1951 as a result of the Korean War. Its personnel and equipment were used as fillers for other units and it was inactivated on 17 March 1951. 323d Fighter-Bomber Wing The wing was reactivated at Bunker Hill AFB, Indiana on 8 August 1955 and assigned to Tactical Air Command's Ninth Air Force. Initially training with North American F-86Fs, these were quickly upgraded to the North American F-86H Sabre and then to the North American F-100A/D Super Sabre in 1956 to become proficient in tactical air operations. Operational squadrons were the 453rd Fighter Bomber Squadron (453 FBS), 454th Fighter Bomber Squadron (454 FBS) and 455th Fighter Bomber Squadron (455 FBS).http://www.f-100.org/hun087.shtml The wing's aircraft wore a band on the tail and around the nose edged with small black checkers. In 1955, Strategic Air Command (SAC) began stationing units at the base and the Eighth Air Force claimed jurisdiction of Bunker Hill AFB in September 1957. With the turnover of the base from TAC to SAC, the 323d was phased down and replaced by SAC's 401st Air Base Group on 1 September 1957. 323d Flying Training Wing Emblem of the 323d Flying Training Wing The 323rd was reactivated as the 323d Flying Training Wing (323 FTW), an Air Training Command (ATC) undergraduate navigator training (UNT) wing at Mather AFB, California on 1 April 1973, replacing the 3535th Navigator Training Wing which had existed at Mather since 1946. As the sole navigator training wing for the entire Air Force, the 323 FTW also conducted advanced training for newly-winged navigators slated for subsequent as navigator-bombardiers and electronic warfare officers in B-52, FB-111, B-1, EF-111 and RC-135 aircraft as well as weapon systems officers in F-4 Wild Weasel variants. The following operational squadrons were redesignated as a flying training squadrons as result of the 323rd's reactivation: 449th Flying Training Squadron (449 FTS), 450th Flying Training Squadron (450 FTS), 451st Flying Training Squadron (451 FTS), 452d Flying Training Squadron (452 FTS) and the 432nd Flying Training Squadron (432d FTS). The 323 FTW also operated Mather AFB as the \\"host\\" wing for the installation while the Strategic Air Command's 320th Bombardment Wing (320 BMW) and the Air Force Reserve's SAC-gained 940th Air Refueling Group (940 ARG), later 940th Air Refueling Wing (940 ARW), were \\"tenant\\" wings. The 323 FTW also had responsibility for publishing Navigator magazine, a USAF-wide professional publication. The 323 FTW also conducted operational test and evaluation of the T-43A aircraft from 1 August 1973 ‚Äì 31 October 1973 and began conversion from the T-29 to the T-43 shortly afterwards. As the only USAF flight training school teaching air navigation, the wing served not only the active duty USAF, but also the Air National Guard, the Air Force Reserve and friendly foreign nations. With the decommissioning of the U.S. Navy's Training Squadron TWENTY- NINE (VT-29) at NAS Corpus Christi, TX in 1975, the 323 FTW also began training U.S. Navy student Naval Flight Officers destined for land-based naval aircraft, NATO/Allied student naval flight officers under U.S. Navy responsibility also destined for land-based maritime aircraft, and U.S. Coast Guard enlisted navigators for that service's HC-130 aircraft starting in July 1976. Instructor Naval Flight Officers, mostly from the Navy's P-3 community, were administratively assigned to Naval Air Training Unit Mather (NAVAIRTU Mather) and embedded in the 323 FTW, teaching USAF, USN and NATO/Allied students. Support of the Marine Aerial Navigation School (MANS) for U.S. Marine Corps enlisted KC-130 navigators also began in July 1976 when MANS moved from NAS Corpus Christi to Mather AFB. However, MANS conducted its own navigation training independently. In view of this influx of naval personnel, Naval Air Training Unit Mather (NAVAIRTU Mather) was established in 1976 under the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA). In order to place the Navy organization on par with the 323 FTW commander, a USN Captain or Captain- selectee naval flight officer who had already had been the commanding officer of an operational combat P-3 squadron was placed as the commanding officer of NAVAIRTU Mather, with administrative claimancy over all naval personnel (students, instructors and support staff) assigned to the 323 FTW. The 323 FTW began training female USAF navigators in March 1977 and female USN naval flight officers in 1981. Female USAF instructor navigators followed in the 1983‚Äì84 time frame. In 1986, LT Kathryn P. Hire, USN a former navigator and aircraft mission commander in the RP-3D Orion oceanographic research aircraft, became the first female USN NFO Instructor in the 323 FTW. Of note is that in 1993, then-LCDR Hire would become the first female assigned to the combat version of the P-3C Orion, and as a CDR and CAPT, would become a NASA mission specialist astronaut, flying the STS-90 mission in 1998 and the STS-130 mission in 2010. On 15 December 1991, the 323d implemented the objective wing concept and the 449th, 450th, 451st, 452d and 432d FTSs were inactivated and the wing was reorganized to a single squadron of aircraft type. All T-43As were assigned to the 445 FTS and T-37Bs to the 455 FTS. On 1 July 1993, following the disestablishment of the Air Training Command, the wing was assigned to the new Air Education and Training Command (AETC). Under AETC, the T-43 and T-47 aircraft assigned to the 454th and 455th FTSs were assigned tail codes of \\"NT\\", but due to the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)-directed closure of Mather AFB on 30 September 1993, the 323 FTW was inactivated on 1 October 1993. With the wing's inactivation, its mission and most of its T-43 aircraft were reassigned to the 12th Flying Training Wing (12 FTW) and the 558th Flying Training Squadron (558 FTS) at Randolph AFB, Texas. Because of the presence of T-37B aircraft at Randolph AFB for T-37 Pilot Instructor Training (PIT), the Mather T-37s were sent to long-term storage at AMARC at Davis‚ÄìMonthan AFB, Arizona. Expeditionary operations The Wing was provisionally activated for a NATO summit at Balotesti in Romania from 14 March to 30 April 2008.

The devices shared data stored on one or two internal disks via Ethernet links. Description The two models in the Storage Central line were the Netgear SC101 and SC101T. The original SC101 model could hold one or two disks (sold separately) using Parallel ATA (known as \\"IDE\\" at the time) and had a 100 Mbit/sec Ethernet over twisted pair interface. The later Netgear SC101T model could hold one or two Serial ATA disks and had a Gigabit Ethernet interface. The ZSAN technology was licensed in 2005 from Zetera Corporation. Reviews praised the low price and ease of installation, but noted limited software support and passive cooling. At least one reviewer encountered an incompatible disk drive. By January 2010 the Storage Central series was replaced by Netgear storage products using the ReadyNAS name. Software The SC101 provided a block-level storage area network (SAN) interface, as opposed to file-level network-attached storage (NAS). Thus, like any SAN device, specific drivers and software must be installed on any client PC wishing to access the device. Only the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems were supported.  Linux drivers  There was discussion of a driver for Linux in 2008. An open source driver for Linux on Google Code used the network block device technology, but because this is a block level device, the OS is responsible for creating a filesystem. Consequently, a filesystem created by Linux will not be compatible with one created by Windows. However, a 2006 post on kerneltrap.org suggested it may be possible to use NTFS-3g on Linux. If possible, this would allow access from both Windows and Linux machines, at the expense of losing features that the proprietary file system offers, such as sharing the device access across multiple machines, as well as mirroring support.

Saint Paul, Minnesota is noted for its neighborhoods. The city has been called \\"fifteen small towns with one mayor\\", owing to the neighborhood-based life of much of the city. Saint Paul is partially governed by not 15 but 17 City Districts. On Saint Paul's largely blue-collar East Side alone there are more than two dozen well-known, historically significant neighborhoods within four City Districts. District 4, for example, has three historic neighborhoods: Dayton's Bluff, Swede Hollow, and Mounds Park. The most populous districts, 2 and 5, have more than a dozen neighborhoods between them. While Saint Paul has long been recognized for its citizen activism, some neighborhoods receive more individual planning attention than others, because tax funds are doled out to annually elected volunteer neighborhood boards based on City District boundaries, not neighborhood boundaries. These boards are called District Councils. The District Council system was established in 1975 to encourage grass-roots involvement. The Councils were also created to help spend federal funds through the recently created Community Development Block Grants. The District Councils share $1.2 million from the city of Saint Paul. In 2015, community participation funds given to the District Councils ranged from $51,873 to $109,475. The councils also have other revenue streams, such as grants and donations. Most councils have significant power on land-use issues. Besides providing advisory recommendations to city officials on development issues, district councils also identify neighborhood needs, initiate community programs and recruit and nurture neighborhood leaders and volunteers. Many of St. Paul's neighborhoods began as rail-line commuter suburbs, including Merriam Park, St. Anthony Park, Macalester Park, Desnoyer Park, Hazel Park, Union Park, Warrendale, and Burlington Heights.The Street Where You Live, a guide to the place names in St. Paul, Donald L. Simpson, University of Minnesota Press, 111 Third Ave So. Minneapolis, Mn, 2006, p. 88, 285 Burlington Heights was south of downtown along the Burlington's tracks to Hastings. The Heights had two train stations a mile apart. The Highwood station was close to where Highwood Avenue ran into the rail line. The remnants of that early 1880's development are discernable. The neighborhood boundaries were Lower Afton Road, Burlington Road, Ogdan Avenue and the Burlington train track.  District Councils  Battle Creek Regional park  District 1 - Eastview, Conway, Battle Creek, Highwood Hills  These four neighborhoods make up District 1, the southeast corner of Saint Paul. They are predominantly residential communities that vary widely economically, geographically, and culturally. It is the site of both single-family homes on large lots and high density apartment complexes. Beautiful parks overlook the Mississippi River and Pig's Eye Lake, and nestle into 1960s-era neighborhoods. The area's riverfront is part of Saint Paul's working river.  District 2 - Greater East Side  The Greater East Side is among the city's largest, most populous and most diverse districts. It is in St. Paul's northeast corner. Boundaries are the city limits on the north and east; Minnehaha Avenue to the south; and Johnson Parkway to the west. It includes the neighborhoods of Frost Lake, Hillcrest, Prosperity Heights, Hayden Heights, Beaver Lake, Hazel Park, and Phalen Village. Built as bedroom communities for the industries further south on the East Side (3M, Whirlpool, Hamm‚Äôs), the neighborhoods continue to include commuter homes with retail and service industries on White Bear Avenue and in Phalen Village. Riverview Library District 3 - West Side  The West Side is actually to the south and across the Mississippi River from Downtown Saint Paul. It is called the West Side because it is on the west bank of the predominantly north-south river. It is adjacent to the suburban cities of South St. Paul and West St. Paul. The West Side is home to one of the largest Hispanic communities in the Twin Cities, centered along C√©sar Ch√°vez Street. District 4 - Dayton's Bluff  Dayton's Bluff is on the east side of the Mississippi in southeastern Saint Paul. It has a residential district on an elevated plateau bounded by the ridges of the Mississippi River Valley. The name commemorates Lyman Dayton (1810‚Äì1865),\\"Dayton's Bluff History \\". Dayton's Bluff District Council. Retrieved on August 14, 2008 for whom a city and a township in Hennepin County also were named. The area of the neighborhood that had views of the river valley and Downtown Saint Paul was purchased as early as the 1850s, with most of the houses being built in the 1880s. On the edge of the southern and highest part of Dayton's Bluff along the Mississippi River is the Indian Mounds Park. Within the park are six remaining burial mounds from the prehistoric era of the Hopewell mound builders. Dayton's Bluff has undergone much renovation and restoration in recent years. Sunset over Lake Phalen District 5 - Payne-Phalen  The Payne-Phalen city district includes the Railroad Island, Phalen Park, Rivoli Bluff, Vento, Wheelock Park, and Williams Hill neighborhoods, and ranges from a blue-collar area to the south to a middle-class area north of Maryland Avenue, including upscale real estate around Lake Phalen.  District 6 - North End  One of Saint Paul‚Äôs largest residential areas, the North End houses a number of businesses, schools, churches and parks. The neighborhood was developed in the 1870s and 1880s south of Maryland Avenue, where Victorian-era homes were built on narrow lots. The neighborhood's northern half was developed in the 1920s or later; the area along Wheelock Parkway was developed in the 1950s. The main commercial corridor is Rice Street (named after the famous Minnesota politician Henry M. Rice), which became a commercial corridor in the late 1890s with the arrival of streetcars. The North End is home to MaryDale Park, Lewis Park, Sylvan Park, Lyton Park and the Front Avenue Skate Park. The North End houses numerous schools. Some of the state‚Äôs more prominent politicians, such as Henry Sibley, William Marshall and Alexander Ramsey, are laid to rest at Oakland Cemetery. The North End also marks the start of the Gateway Trail, and the Trout Brook Nature Sanctuary and Reserve is found at its eastern border. The Willow Reserve, a bird sanctuary, is a 5.5-acre wetland and home to many species of birds. The North End is rich in history and traditions dating back to the 1800s as well as embracing customs from newer arrivals, being home to the largest population of Karen and Karenni immigrants from Burma.  District 7 - Frogtown (Thomas-Dale)  Frogtown/Thomas Dale is built around University Avenue. Thomas-Dale is colloquially known as Frogtown. Historically, Frogtown was a section of the current Thomas-Dale neighborhood bordered by University Avenue on the south, Van Buren Avenue on the north, Dale Street on the west and Western Avenue on the east. Western Ave Station  District 8 - Summit-University  Summit-U is an ethnically and economically diverse community west of Downtown Saint Paul. It includes the historic Cathedral Hill neighborhood, as well as what remains of \\"old Rondo\\", a former neighborhood of the city. Among the many groups living in Summit-University are the Hmong community as well as the city's other Asian communities, including large numbers of Vietnamese, Laotians and Cambodians. In the 1880s, the southern portion closest to Summit Avenue was the preeminent neighborhood to live in. Housing further north and closer to University Avenue was less grand. Parts of the neighborhood experienced significant urban renewal after the 1960s which resulted in the destruction of the Rondo Neighborhood to make way for Interstate 94. Sections of the neighborhood north of Interstate 94 were torn down and replaced with developments that more closely resembled the suburbs, leaving a striking contrast with the late 19th- and early 20th-century homes south near Ramsey Hill.  District 9 - West Seventh/Fort Road  West Seventh in St. Paul is also known as Fort Road, owing to its location on historic Native American and fur trader paths along the northern bank of the Mississippi River from downtown Saint Paul to Fort Snelling. This area is colloquially known as the \\"West End\\", and is different from the area across the river known as the \\"West Side\\". The West Seventh neighborhood was originally a series of European immigrant neighborhoods along the western bluffs of the Mississippi River, spanning the entire length of West Seventh St. or \\"Old Fort Rd.\\" During the 1880s large populations of Irish, German, Czech, Slovak and (to a lesser degree) Scandinavian immigrants moved to the West End. \\"Saint Paul has a rich history of active and distinct neighborhoods. To support neighborhood participation in governance, the district council planning process was created over 30 years ago.\\" City of St. Paul Website: http://www.stpaul.gov/index.aspx?NID=1859 There are 17 district councils, and the district council of the West End is the Fort Road Federation/District 9 Community Council. \\"Responsibilities of the councils include: planning and advising on the physical, economic, and social development of their areas; identifying needs; initiating community programs; recruiting volunteers; and sponsoring community events.\\" The Federation actually predates the District Council system in St. Paul. \\"...in 1973, a group of about a dozen community members banded together to create the West 7th/Fort Road Federation. They founded the organization on the principle that citizens acting together could maintain and improve the quality of life in their neighborhoods and help commercial endeavors prosper once again. With a $5,000 start-up grant from the Christian Sharing Fund, the young organization headed down a path of community development and support that would continue for many years to come.\\"Twenty- five Years of Facing Change: West 7th/Fort Road Federation 1973-1998 Today, several organizations and task forces serve the neighborhoods that make up the West End. Task forces of the Federation include West End Gardeners as well as the North High Bridge Park Task Forces; the West Seventh Business Association and its Enhancement coalition; the Irvine Park Historic District and Association; Czech and Slovak Sokol Minnesota in its historic hall on the national historic register; and the West 7th Community Center. Como Conservatory Japanese Garden entrance  District 10 - Como Park  Como Park is a neighborhood situated around Como Lake. The Como Park neighborhood has many recreational facilities, including a golf course, bike path, various open fields, a pavilion, a municipal pool, and the Como Zoo, one of two zoos in the Twin Cities (the other being the Minnesota Zoo). The Como area is also home to many of the city's ginkgo trees. There are several schools in Como Park, the public schools in the area being Chelsea Heights Elementary School and the Como Park Elementary School, the only school in the city to have its own planetarium. The primary secondary school in Como Park is Como Park Senior High School, one of the highest rated schools in the state according to Newsweek.. District 11 - Hamline Midway  Hamline Midway derives its name from being halfway between the downtowns of Minneapolis and Saint Paul. The neighborhood includes Hamline University. Famous Midway natives include Peanuts cartoonist Charles M. Schulz and the band Heiruspecs. City Pages and 89.3 The Current present HEIRUSPECS CD Release Show First Avenue.  District 12 - Saint Anthony Park  Saint Anthony Park, known to residents as SAP, is adjacent to the University of Minnesota Saint Paul campus, bordering Northeast Minneapolis on the west and the Minnesota State Fairgrounds on the east. It was the home to three Minnesota governors (William Marshall, 1866‚Äì70; Andrew McGill, 1887‚Äì1889; and Elmer L. Andersen, 1961‚Äì63). In the late 1800s the area was laid out as estates for the wealthy of Minneapolis.http://www.rchs.com/neighborhoods/saint_anthony.htm It is centrally located in the Twin Cities, with a business district that contains independently owned shops and restaurants. A Carnegie Library and St. Anthony Park Elementary School are the neighborhood's focal points. SAP also has two colleges, the St. Paul campus of the University of Minnesota and Luther Seminary, and thus is home to graduate students from across the world. The area's largest park is named for former St. Anthony Park resident Nathaniel P. Langford, who was responsible for the world's first national park, Yellowstone. District 13 - Union Park  Union Park, created from the merger between former Merriam Park, Snelling Hamline, and Lexington-Hamline District Councils, is a residential neighborhood featuring a large stock of early 20th-century housing, boutique-dominated commercial strips on Selby, Cretin and Cleveland avenues, and the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area forming the neighborhood's western border. Many Union Park residents still identify their neighborhoods with the original names. Concordia University and part of the University of St. Thomas are in the district. * Lexington-Hamline: The Lex-Ham neighborhood is bounded by University Avenue, Lexington Parkway, and Summit and Hamline Avenues. The Lexington-Hamline Community Council was established in 1969 as St. Paul's first neighborhood organization. It continues to be the cornerstone for organizing and serving the residents living in this neighborhood, and has representation on the Board. * Snelling Hamline: Between Snelling and Hamline Avenues and bordered by University and Summit Avenues, the Snelling-Hamline neighborhood maintains a distinct identity. It is home both to the long- standing O‚ÄôGara‚Äôs Bar and Grill, and the new Vintage development at the corner of Snelling and Selby Avenues. This area includes \\"Midway Center\\", one of inner-city Saint Paul's key shopping districts.Midway : A Vision for an Urban Center February 25, 2003 University UNITED. * Merriam Park: Constituting a large portion of the Union Park area, Merriam Park lies west of Snelling Avenue and stretches west to the park that bears its name. Merriam Park was actually one of the Twin Cities‚Äô first suburbs, a couple of trolley stops outside of early Saint Paul. Entrepreneur John L. Merriam thought the location would make an ideal suburb for businessmen, professional workers and their families. New streetcar lines were being run through the neighborhood, and by 1880 a railroad line linking the two downtowns ran through the area. Merriam purchased land, built a rail depot in his future neighborhood, and started selling lots to future homeowners. St Thomas campus District 14 - Macalester-Groveland  Macalester (Mac)-Groveland is an established developed neighborhood in western Saint Paul that extends east from the Mississippi River to the Summit Hill neighborhood. The neighborhood is a mix of single-family homes and apartments with corner stores and commercial corridors. The Summit Avenue Historic District, with mansions from the late 1800s, flanks the neighborhood's northern border. In recent years Grand Avenue has developed into a nationally recognized commercial street, with a mixture of national retailers and local vendors. Several colleges and universities, including the University of St. Thomas, Macalester College, and St. Catherine University, are in the neighborhood. The influence of academia and college life is felt throughout the neighborhood, offering residents an array of cultural, athletic, and musical opportunities. Scenic pedestrian and bicycle trails stretch throughout Mac-Groveland, in particular along the Mississippi riverfront. District 15 - Highland Park Highland Park is home to St. Catherine University as well as two private preparatory schools, Cretin-Derham Hall High School and St. Paul Academy and Summit School . For 85 years the neighborhood hosted the Ford Motor Company Twin Cities Assembly Plant, where Ford Ranger and Mazda B-Series pickup trucks were produced. Ford closed the plant in 2011 and the 122 acres of prime real estate along the Mississippi is on track to become a mixed residential and commercial property. In 2018 The Ryan Companies of Minneapolis won the right to develop the property in accordance with a master zoning plan drawn up by the city of St. Paul.https://www.vox.mn/post/st-paul-ford-plant-development Saint Paul cathedral District 16 - Summit Hill Summit Hill is bounded by Summit Avenue and Ramsey St. on the north, Interstate 35E on the south and east, and Ayd Mill Road on the west. One of St. Paul's oldest and most popular neighborhoods, Summit Hill is a regional and local treasure of history, architecture, distinctive pedestrian-oriented shopping and dining experiences, and strong community connections. In the 1880s and 1890s the Crocus Hill and Grand Hill neighborhoods, two residential sections of Summit Hill, became fashionable locations for wealthy families. At that time, many earlier Summit Avenue constructions were renovated or razed to make way for more fashionable, or what were thought to be architecturally significant, houses. Early railroad and lumber barons built on Summit Avenue and in the adjacent areas, with families such as the Burbanks and Weyerhaeusers leading local social life. Summit Avenue was originally conceived as a broad, Gilded Age showcase street, and is lined with mansions named after notable Saint Paul figures, such as railroad tycoon James J. Hill. With its vistas of downtown and the Mississippi River, Summit Avenue is thought to be one of the longest stretches of preserved Victorian mansions in North America. It has been home to artists such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda, Sinclair Lewis, August Wilson, and Garrison Keillor. More notorious residents have included 1930s-era gangsters such as John Dillinger and members of the Barker-Karpis Gang. Downtown Saint Paul  District 17 - Downtown  Downtown Saint Paul is home to Xcel Energy Center (home of the Minnesota Wild), Galtier Plaza across from Mears Park, the McNally Smith College of Music, and Wells Fargo Place. Downtown hosts several parks, most notably Rice Park, one of the oldest parks in the country. The street life has been improving in some areas of downtown, including Mears Park bars and restaurants and along Wabasha and St. Peter Streets, where a small collection of restaurants has developed. The extensive skyway system connecting most of the office buildings has contributed to the removal of foot traffic from the streets.Berg, Steve (Nov. 15, 2007) \\"Urban designers critique Minneapolis and offer this idea: Tear down all those horrible skyways\\" MinnPost See also * Neighborhoods of Minneapolis References External links *Saint Paul neighborhood census facts *Saint Paul Neighborhood, Council Ward, and other maps Saint Paul ","title":"Neighborhoods in Saint Paul, Minnesota"},{"id":"14423093","text":"Zalzala may refer to: * Az-Zalzala, the 99th sura of the Qur'an * Zalzala (1988 film), a 1988 Bollywood film * Operation Zalzala, a 2008 Pakistan Army military offensive manhunt * Zalzala Jazeera, a Pakistani island formed in 2013 by an earthquake ","title":"Zalzala"},{"id":"14423115","text":"The Church of the Holy Comforter, built in 1872, is a historic Carpenter Gothic church located on Main Street, in Brownsville, Minnesota, on the west bank of the Mississippi River in the United States.

It's like a zoo.\\" and \\"The student section is next to the court, and the fans there say some creative stuff.\\" In 2013, the Petersen Events Center, with specific mention of the Oakland Zoo, was ranked as the nation's second best game atmosphere arena by USA Today. Some members of the Oakland Zoo have been known to wear body paint, wigs, masks, or animal-themed costumes that have included, at various times, giraffes, moose, penguins, gorillas, bears, among other species. The Zoo has also been lauded by many notable visitors to the Pete including Dallas Maverick's owner Mark Cuban and national college basketball pundits such as Jay Bilas and Dick Vitale who have described it as a \\"phenomenal\\" and one of the \\"top\\" college cheering sections giving a \\"tremendous home court advantage\\" with an atmosphere demonstrating \\"college hoops at its best\\". The Zoo was an instrumental member of the Inspiring Pitt Pride Committee that won recognition for the University as being one of five institutions that received the Division I-A Athletic Directors Association's \\"Sportsmanship Recognition Award\\" in 2006. In 2011, Pitt debuted custom Nike Hyper Elite jerseys featuring an aerographic with the Oakland Zoo logo on the back. Pitt described this as the first NCAA basketball jersey to ever showcase their respective student section. In December 2011, ESPN's Eammonn Brennan and Dana O'Neil solicited feedback regarding the best student sections in all of NCAA Division I. They later listed their top-5 in a podcast discussion, naming the Oakland Zoo the second best in the nation, behind only Duke and the Cameron Crazies. During the 2011-12 season, the Oakland Zoo, in collaboration with the university's student radio station WPTS-FM, created The Oakland Zoo Show. Broadcast live locally on WPTS and streamed over the internet, the radio show starts 30 minutes before every Pitt men's basketball home game and is cohosted by the entire Oakland Zoo student section. During the broadcast of the game that follows, game stoppages also include live check-ins with the Zoo. Although credited by Pitt coaches, players and opponents alike for creating an intimidating atmosphere for visiting teams which has helped the men's team to a 13-1 record against visiting top 10 ranked teams (9-0 vs top 5), the Oakland Zoo has also been noted for its ability to impress football recruits during visits to Pitt basketball games. Elite high school running back prospect LeSean McCoy credited the Zoo's warm reception for him during a 2007 visit in helping to cement his decision to sign the University of Pittsburgh. Gateway High School linebacker, Shayne Hale, also credited the Zoo with his recruiting. Hale attended a game with high school teammate and friend Cameron Saddler. To the cheers of the Zoo, Hale put on a Zoo shirt and joined the Zoo for a portion of the game. History The Oakland Zoo was independently formed by Pitt students in the winter of 2001. The initial idea for the Zoo came from Matt Cohen and Zack Hale during the January 6, 2001 basketball game against Syracuse where they determined the Pitt student section was too calm. Cohen and Hale rounded up eight of their fellow students from the university's Litchfield Towers dormitory to initiate the club's first appearance at the January 13, 2001 victory over then 15th-ranked Seton Hall. The name \\"Zoo\\" was meant to represent \\"a bunch of kids in a zoo acting crazy\\" whereas \\"Oakland\\" is the neighborhood of Pittsburgh in which the university resides. Students adopted gold t-shirts and eventually grew to consume the majority of the student section at the team's home court then inside Fitzgerald Field House. Originally, upon seeking official sponsorship from the University for the 2001-2002 season, the group was denied and the athletic department attempted to implement their own counterpart to their football student cheering section called the \\"Aero-Zone\\", named after then athletic department apparel sponsor A√©ropostale, and issued free t-shirts to the students emblazoned with this name. However, the \\"Aero-Zone\\" failed to catch on while the Oakland Zoo continued to grow, transitioning into the Petersen Events Center when it was opened in 2002 and filling the larger student section of the \\"Pete\\". The group is now an officially recognized student group of the University, and with over 2,000 members, is the largest such group. The Pitt Athletic Department now also works hand in hand with the Oakland Zoo, using the student leaders of the Oakland Zoo, otherwise known as the Zoo Keeper, as liaisons to the student body to make game experiences better. Following Cohen, other Zoo Keepers include Andy Nagy (2005‚Äì2006), Ian Smith (2006-2007), David Jedlicka (2007-2009), Josh Frantz (2009‚Äì2010), Robert Hogan (2010‚Äì2011), Eric Haybarger (2011‚Äì2012), Joe Lassi (2012-2013), Jordan Shoup (2013-2014), Nick Brenner (2014-2015), Eric Floyd (2015-2016), Charlie Hansen (2016-2017), and Madeleine Shelley (2017‚Äìpresent). Predecessors and noted fans The history of specifically organized student sections and especially notable fans of the University of Pittsburgh basketball extend beyond the formation of the current iteration of the student cheering section named the Oakland Zoo. Tiger Paul \\"Tiger\\" Paul Auslander, an unofficial cheerleader for Pitt basketball in the 1970s and early 80s, was well known by fans for his sideline antics \\"Tiger\\" Paul Auslander served as an unofficial cheerleader at Pitt basketball games in the 1970s and early 1980s. At 5'4\\" and 181, the diminutive graduate of Peabody High School in Pittsburgh earned his nickname from his football coach who encouraged him to hit the blocking sled harder by instructing him to \\"Be a tiger!\\". Following high school he also coached amateur basketball teams in the city and his enthusiasm on the sideline caught the attention of Pitt head coach Tim Grgurich who invited him to Fitzgerald Field House to liven up the crowd. Typically, his routine would involve dressing in outlandish outfits, sprint along the floor, and doing jumping jacks or push-ups. He was once ejected from a game at Temple University for arguing with an official. Auslander drifted away from the basketball scene in the early 1980s and eventually moved to Nevada where he died in 1992. Panther Paul A fan and season ticket holder of the Pitt men's basketball team, Paul Hipp entertained crowds from the late 1980s through the early 1990s. During intermissions and time-outs, Panther Paul would get out of his seat and lead the crowd in cheers with a fist pumping motion. His exuberant nature combined with short stature and portly appearance made him a fan favorite. Field House Fanatics In the late 1980s, the first organized band of students (made up mostly of the baseball team) pooled their efforts and formed the first student cheer group at the University. The Field House Fanatics, deriving their name from Fitzgerald Field House that was the former home facility used by the university's basketball team, sat in one section of bleachers on the baseline behind the basket. (closest to Pitt's bench) The opponents losses were recorded on tombstone like cutouts containing the losing team's name that were hung on a beam overhead of the section, a tradition revived by the Oakland Zoo during the 2008-09 season. T-shirts were made up for the Field House Fanatics, however they lacked the overall coordination and status as an official student group that the current Oakland Zoo section enjoys. They creatively heckled opposing players and worked to distract them while shooting free-throws at the basket in front of the section, but the section slowly diminished in size and disappeared during a slump in basketball quality at Pitt during the mid to late 1990s. Crazy Dancing Lady During the Oakland Zoo era, another noted and passionate Pitt fan, Joyce Joynes Langston, often referred to as the \\"Crazy Dancing Lady\\", became known for her uninhibited dancing at Panther home basketball and football games. Her dancing antics resulted in her making frequent scoreboard appearances and she became a familiar sight at Pitt home games. Langston died on January 5, 2012. Oakland Zoonicorn During the 2017-2018 season, junior student Tyler Vitale began donning a unicorn mask at games and instantly garnered notoriety among fans and beat writers as the \\"Oakland Zoonicorn.\\"https://twitter.com/ASaunders_PGH/status/957354277810462721 Throughout the season, Vitale made numerous appearances on the scoreboard and television, a small bright spot in a season in which Pitt began 0-17 in conference play.http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2018/02/24/pitt- basketball-virginia-defense-acc-kevin-stallings/stories/201802240105 He gained national attention when Pittsburgh Steelers receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster tweeted a photo with him.https://twitter.com/TeamJuJu/status/951267472300060672 Vitale is currently a Vice President of the Oakland Zoo and is attempting to get Pitt basketball to recognize him on Senior Day 2019.https://twitter.com/Torch_Vitale/status/967808156586987523 T-shirts and merchandising Students in the section wear gold T-shirts with an \\"Oakland Zoo\\" logo, whose design is altered for each new season, printed on the front. In some iterations, the back of the shirt resembles a jersey, with the name \\"Panthers\\" printed above a large number 6, which stands for the \\"Sixth Man in the Stands,\\" the fans. The designs for the 2004-05 to 2008-09 seasons were completed by Pitt graduate student and former Oakland Zoo President David Jedlicka, known as \\"the Bald Guy\\". Since the 2010‚Äì11, T-shirt logo designs have been by graphic designer Sean Montgomery and have incorporated various elements from the University of Pittsburgh's seal that itself includes a stylized version of the city of Pittsburgh's coat of arms that in turn is derived from the arms of the namesake of the city, William Pitt. On the backs of these recent t-shirts there is also a depiction of the university's Cathedral of Learning. Symbolizing the link between the basketball team and the student section, the image of the Cathedral of Learning on the back of the Zoo's t-shirts mimics the one found in the aerographic of the Nike game jerseys worn by the team, and likewise, the team's game jerseys' aerographic includes an Oakland Zoo logo in their design. The university's motto, logo, founding date, and various basketball imagery have also been recently incorporated into the t-shirt designs. Oakland Zoo T-shirts are available for purchase by the general public in the University of Pittsburgh's Pitt Shop and other outlets. Other merchandise, including pink ladies Oakland Zoo t-shirts, hoodies, and polo shirts are also available. In addition, the official team store sells limited edition plush animals outfitted with Oakland Zoo t-shirts. Individually numbered Oakland Zoo animals outfitted with 2006-2007 Oakland Zoo t-shirts that were produced in the first edition of the Oakland Zoo collection (with release date) included Corey the Giraffe (12-14-06), Romper the Monkey (1-7-2007), Francis the Polar Bear (1-27-2007), and Porter the Tiger (2-12-2007). The second edition of the Oakland Zoo collection with their release date are as follows: Cagney King of the Jungle (10-31-07), Corbin the Elephant (11-23-07), Hobart the Brown Bear (1-2-08), and Dandy the Duck (1-30-08). A third edition for 2008-09 includes the release of Kirby the Koala and Penelope the Penguin wearing Oakland Zoo VI t-shirts. Legal issues In 2003, Oakland Zoo founder Matt Cohen filed a trademark infringement suit, on behalf of the club, against a local t-shirt vendor Chuck Bonasorte. The Oakland Zoo wanted a percent of money for each t-shirt sold to be used to fund club related events for Zoo members. The judge ruled that there was no way to establish the trademark, and that Bonasorte's business, The Pittsburgh Stop, was selling the shirts before the Zoo. However, Bonasorte did agree to pay royalties to the Zoo. The \\"Oakland Zoo\\" trademark was later registered by the University of Pittsburgh. In-game activities UConn in 2009. A portion of the Oakland Zoo can be seen at the bottom. Pitt won the nationally televised game 70-60. Waiting times for the best seats in the Oakland Zoo section of the Petersen Events Center can extend for hours before the game's tip-off. For more high profile games, Zoo members have camped overnight inside the large lobby of the Petersen Events Center, sometimes having pizza delivered to them by the basketball coaching staff. The Oakland Zoo distributes four page newspapers prior to every home game with details on Pitt players and opponents. The student section uses these papers to mock the opposing team during player introductions for the opponent by feigning disinterest. Also during the introduction of visiting players, the section yells \\"Sucks!\\" after the name of each opposing player is introduced, implying that the opposing players are not very good. After the opposing coach is introduced, the section yells \\"He sucks too!\\" At the start of the introduction for Pitt players, the Zoo tosses their newspapers into the air. After the first point of the game is scored by Pitt, the Zoo throws the discarded papers which in the meantime have been ripped into pieces, into the air to create a shower of confetti. During the playing of the national anthem, the Zoo members lock their arms around their neighbors shoulders in a sign of solidarity with the Pitt players who also lock arms during the national anthem. Currently, Panther Fans sing two fight songs during each game, the \\"Pitt Victory Song\\" and \\"Hail to Pitt\\". Oakland Zoo members are also known from dressing up, although some are known for their lack of dress and painted chests, with particular notoriety for costumes involving various animal themes including gorilla and bear costumes. In 2006, the Oakland Zoo showed solidarity with the Duquesne University basketball team by wearing red ribbons to commemorate the five Duquesne basketball players who were shot earlier in the year. In 2008 the Oakland Zoo wore ribbons again, however this time it was for Pink the Pete. During the Pitt vs. UConn women's game, the Oakland Zoo distributed pink ribbons to everyone in attendance to show support for breast cancer awareness. These ribbons were similar to the 2006 ribbons, but this time had the Oakland Zoo logo printed on them. The tradition was continued with a different pink shirt for the annual Pink the Pete games against Cincinnati in 2009, against Louisville in 2010, and against Connecticut in 2012 . During the 2008‚Äì09 and 2012-13 seasons, the Oakland Zoo revived the tradition, started with the Field House Fanatics, of hanging tombstones for each team defeated by the men's basketball team at the Petersen Events Center. For much of its history, communication between the Zoo leadership and the rest of the student section has been communicated by a whiteboard. In 2013, the university and the zoo collaborated so messages could be communicated to the entire Petersen Events Center via the main scoreboard. Student club The Oakland Zoo also functions as an officially recognized student club by the University of Pittsburgh with over 2,000 members. The group helps participate with the Athletic Department in setting student ticket policy and was instrumental in bringing about a \\"loyalty points\\" program. The Oakland Zoo also holds an annual pre-season event, hosted by the current president of the organization, during which food is served and talks are given by Pitt's men's and women's head basketball coaches. There are also meetings announced via Twitter where members of the Oakland Zoo can come together and brainstorm on new ideas for the Zoo and upcoming opponents. The Oakland Zoo has also been involved in various student activities and charitable events throughout its history. The Zoo held its first annual 3v3 Charity Basketball Tournament on September 30, 2012. Games were held on the court in the Petersen Event Center, and all proceeds from both spectators and competitors were donated to Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Pittsburgh. The charity event raised over $4,000 in its first year.

Fon R.A.M Tebo II of Batibo. Fon R.A.M. Tebo II of Batibo ascended the throne upon the death of his father HRH G.T.T. Mba II in 2005 amidst great political, cultural and economic anxiety in the Batibo Fondom. Early life and education Fon R.A.M. Tebo II of Batibo was born into the royal fondom of Batibo village in the North-West Region of the Republic of Cameroon in 1964. His father was Fon GTT Mba 11 (paramount chief of Batibo). Fon R.A.M. Tebo II's primary education spans from 1970 to 1977. Starting off in Presbyterian primary school Guka, he later transferred to Government Primary School Wumukan where he obtained his F.S.L.C and the following year moved on to pursue his secondary education in C.P.C Bali. After 5 years, he passed the G.C.E 0/L and opted for GHS Mbengwi. Majoring in liberal arts he went on to pass the examination GCE A/L. He then sought and obtained admission to the University of Yaounde where he studied Law in the Faculty of Laws and Economics and in 1989 was awarded a bachelor's degree in Law. Business career Subsequent years were spent in job search and business. Starting in Edea where he owned a small business, he retrained in accounting with the British School of accounting, Douala, and then worked for Guinness Cameroon briefly before leaving for an International transportation company that took him off the shores of Cameroon to Dubai. He returned to Cameroon in the declining days of his father's health; he was enthroned in 2005 upon the death of his father. Though not active in any political party, R.A.M Tebo II is an active member of the Northwest Fons Union (NOWEFU). Personal life Fon R.A.M. Tebo II is married to two wives who have both borne him children. History of the Batibo Palace Batibo Palace Tebo II in front of the palace The history of the Batibo Palace and Fondon is intractably linked to that of the entire Widikum tribe in the North Western Region of Cameroon. It dates as far back as to the mid 17th century, when lovebirds Tembeka and Akumaka defected from a wave of Bantu migrants and settled in Tegheben, in a quarter called Tad in today's Batibo, two miles south of the current Batibo palace. Tegheben is the site of the first palace of the Batibo Fondom. Njei Tegha who succeeded Tembeka evacuated his father's compound and erected his own palace at Gowi quarters, located about a mile north of Tegheben. Njei Tifuh succeeded Njei Tegha and also decided to vacate his fathers compound at Gowi and moved his palace to the current palace grounds, behind what is now the community hall. Fon Mba II subsequently moved the palace from this location to the present site, still within the palace grounds. Palace historian Prince Hansel Mba, the eldest son of Fon Mba II writing in a publication \\"A birds Eye View\\" published by the Batibo Rural Council, notes that much animosity was often nursed against a named successor, and his life was always threatened by his brothers. Consequently, the successor had to change abode while retaining his father's will making him Fon and successor. This explains some of the movements in the early days of the Fondom, and resolves the lingering questions about Wore Tad and Wore Gowi which has led to conjectures that either a Wore Tad or a Wore Gowi would have formed the royal household for the Batibo Fondom. What is obvious is that while the successor vacated his father's home for safety, one of his brothers always remained and governed the rest of the family as quarter head under the authority of the successor and Fon who lived apart. R.A.M. Tebo II has engaged on a modernization of the Batibo palace, building new structures and upgrading some old ones.

Miriam Pirazzini (21 August 1918 ‚Äì 26 December 2016) was a well-known Italian mezzo-soprano. She made her formal debut in Rome, in 1944, as Laura Adorno in La Gioconda. For the next twenty years, she was one of Italy's foremost mezzo-sopranos. Pirazzini was born in Castelfranco Veneto, Treviso, Veneto in 1918. Opposite Maria Callas, Pirazzini appeared as Amneris in A√Øda, at Rovigo (1948), Reggio Calabria (1951) and the Verona Arena (directed by G.W.

By winning the competition to design the Gateshead Viaduct in 1965, Ahm started the firm's new transport group, specialising in bridges. From 1989 to 1992 he was chairman of the firm. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1981. Ahm was an active member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, acting as a Council Member twice, and becoming Vice Chairman of Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief from 1989 to 1993. From 1992 to 1996 he was chairman of the Association of Consulting Engineers.

He later immigrated to Sierra Leone, where he helped found Freetown and became the first Methodist missionary to African indigenous people. He published his autobiography in 1798, which was one of only three by Black Nova Scotians and also notable among slave narratives as a work that was trans-Atlantic. King, who had been born a slave in South Carolina, was apprenticed as a carpenter. He joined the British when they occupied Charleston, as they promised freedom to slaves. Early life and education Boston King was born in South Carolina, the son of a literate slave taken from Africa. His mother knew of herbal preparations from the Native Americans. Boston first joined the British near Charleston; after surviving smallpox, he made his way to New York during the American Revolution, twice escaping capture. In New York, he met and married Violet, an enslaved woman from North Carolina who had also joined the British.\\"Boston King\\", Revolution, Part 2, PBS They had each made their way to New York on the promise of freedom for their contribution to the war effort.Robin W. Winks, The Blacks in Canada: A History, McGill-Queen's Press, 1997, accessed 27 September 2011 The Kings were among the 3,000 black American slaves who were given certificates of freedom, entered into the Book of Negroes, and evacuated with the British; they were resettled in Nova Scotia. Migration to Nova Scotia King, a master carpenter, helped to form a community with his wife in Birchtown, where he worked a number of odd jobs to survive. The Black Loyalists especially struggled through the early years of the colony; there were delays in their land grants and supplies, and it turned out that the soil was too poor to support much farming. Before the Kings decided to leave Nova Scotia, Boston King was appointed as Methodist minister to a congregation at Preston, near Halifax. Immigration to Sierra Leone Although conditions were improving for them in Nova Scotia, King and his wife decided to immigrate to the new British colony, the Province of Freedom (now Sierra Leone) in 1792. It was established for blacks from London and Canada. The Black Canadians, numbering nearly 1200 and traveling on several ships, established their own settlement of Freetown, Sierra Leone. Violet King died of fever soon after arrival.Vincent Carretta, Unchained Voices: An Anthology of Black Authors in the English-Speaking World of the Eighteenth Century, University of Kentucky Press, 2003, pp. 394-395 At first Boston was employed by the company to preach to the native Africans in Sierra Leone, despite the fact that he could not understand their language. Soon he opened a school, late traveling to England to be schooled himself as a teacher. In 1794, the Sierra Leone Company sent King to England for education as a teacher and missionary at the Methodist- Kingswood School near Bristol. He returned to Sierra Leone in 1796 to teach other settlers and act as a missionary to local native peoples. During that period, he wrote his autobiography, which was published in London. Marriage and family King married again in Sierra Leone after Violet died. While serving as a missionary to the Sherbro people, who were located in the coastal area about 100 miles south of Freetown, he and his second wife died about 1802. King was survived by two sons and a daughter, according to the 1802 census of Sierra Leone.  Autobiography  While studying in Bristol, England, he wrote an autobiography, Memoirs of the Life of Boston King (1798), which was published in four installments in the Wesleyan Methodist Magazine in London. It was one of the genre of African American slave narratives, notable as one of three by Black Nova Scotians and one that spanned the Atlantic, as he wrote about his emigration to Sierra Leone.Joe Lockard, \\"Memoirs of Boston King: A Black Preacher\\" , Anti-slavery Literature Website, Arizona State University, accessed 27 September 2011 A new edition was published as The Life of Boston King, Black Loyalist, Minister, and Master Carpenter (2003), by Nimbus Publishing Ltd. and the Nova Scotia Museum.

Gintoki is the protagonist of the series and his name serves as part of the basis of the series' title. He is introduced as a former rebel samurai who lives in a fictionalized version of 1860s Japan after being invaded and transformed by aliens. Gintoki once fought the alien invaders until he realized the lack of sense in doing so, leading to him choosing to instead make a living as a freelancer for hire in Edo alongside his friends Shinpachi Shimura and Kagura in order to pay the monthly rent. Across the series, more details about Gintoki's past are revealed leading him to encounter former friends as enemies. As the main character, Gintoki has appeared in most of the episodes of the anime series, as well as in other media related to the franchise, including the film and all of the spin-off video games and original video animations. Sorachi created the character after suggestions of his editors of having silver-haired samurai. He was originally going to be based on Hijikata Toshiz≈ç, the vice-captain from the Shinsengumi special forces. However, Sorachi changed his mind as he did not want the main character to be working in an organization and further remodeled his design into the present one. In the anime series Gintoki was voiced by Tomokazu Sugita, who enjoyed his character. For the English release of the first movie, he was voiced by Chris Patton, whereas in the Gintama¬∞ episodes Gintoki was played by Michael Daingerfield; later, Roly Guti√©rrez dubbed him in the first anime series. Shun Oguri portrays him in the live-action films. Gintoki's character has received critical response from various reviewers and publications for manga, anime and other media. While Gintoki's reception has been positive, writers have also criticized his characterization in some story arcs. When he once parodied a Japanese politician in 2016, the company behind the manga, Shueisha, expressed pressure as well as laughter. Gintoki has also remained highly popular with Gin Tama fans, ranking first in all of the popularity polls. Merchandise based on Gintoki has also been released, including figurines.  Creation and development  While brainstorming on the name for a manga, Hideaki Sorachi's editor commented, \\"Do you think a silver samurai would be cool?\\" This inspired Sorachi to create the main character after deciding the series should be named Gin Tama. Sorachi's initial plan for his first major series was to center it around a fictionalized version of the Shinsengumi, mostly to ride off the hype for Shinsengumi!, a Japanese drama starring idol actors as the famous Japanese special police force. However, Sorachi's version was planned to be as unrealistic as possible; his force included both men and women possessing bizarre traits that were nothing like the original Shinsengumi, and that would seep into many of the characters that would be part of his eventual manga. One of the characters from this set was a silver-haired man who was to be the representation of prominent member Hijikata Toshiz≈ç. Sorachi particularly liked Hijikata and wanted this character to be the hero of his series despite the lack of similarities with the real Hijikata. While Sorachi loved the design he created for his silver- haired Hijikata, he could not draw out his character or figure out what he would do in the series. He considered dropping the character and his editor nearly forced him to give up on him just as the original Shinsengumi concept was falling apart. Eventually it was decided that the silver-haired character would be an original lead character, while the Shinsengumi would be portrayed as comedic foils. Quickly giving him the nickname of \\"Gin-san\\", the original concept of the silver-haired Hijikata was shattered and Sorachi recreated the character from the ground up into the lazy-eyed freelancer he would be in the series. The concept behind Gintoki's character is that he is a strong person who does not belong to any organization and tends to disregard rules. Although Gintoki was roughly based on Sakata Kintoki, Sorachi did not intend Gintoki to be a descendant of Sakata. Unlike common heroes within manga series, Gintoki does not undergo character development. This is connected with the character's background as several things in his life changed due to the Amanto invasion and wishes some things not change. For the anime series, Gintoki has been voiced by Tomokazu Sugita in Japanese. When learning he was selected to voice the Gin Tamas main character Sugita wanted to show off to fit the character. However, he later took a bigger view on Gintoki's character; understanding that Gintoki lives with a lot of people's support, Sugita changed his mindset when voicing the character. In the English dub of the first movie, he is voiced by Chris Patton, while Michael Daingerfield voices him the Gintama¬∞ series.  Appearances  In GinTama Gintoki Sakata is a freelancer former samurai living in an era where aliens known as the Amanto have come to Earth after the Joi War, a battle in which the latter defeated the former. As a child, he was taught by Shoyo Yoshida, with his classmates being two of his future Joi allies, Kotaro Katsura and Shinsuke Takasugi. Shoyo was unjustly accused of trying to raise an army, which resulted in his capture, with Gintoki and his friends entering the Joi War to rescue their teacher. During that period, he was known as the due to his silver hair and white coat he wore in battle, which, combined with his impressive capabilities as a swordsman, made him famous among his comrades and struck fear into Amanto. During a time in the Joui War when he, Katsura and Takasugi were captured by Tendosho, under orders by Sada Sada, Gintoki was forced to execute his master without any choice before his master's final bidding to him right in front of his comrades' eyes. After his master's death, Gintoki chooses to open a freelance business where he could handle matters his own way, while continuing to live by his own samurai code. In his job, he gets two employees, the samurai apprentice Shinpachi Shimura and the alien girl Kagura and comes to have a close relationship with both of them. The group often have problems to pay the monthly rent for Otose, Gintoki's landlady whom he swore to protect after eating the food offerings meant to her husband's grave. Despite his age, Gintoki often shows various childish behaviour, the most noticeable is his insatiable sweet tooth. However, Gintoki has been warned by his doctor to control his sugar intake. He is also obsessed with reading the manga anthology magazine Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump. Additionally, he is extremely afraid of ghosts and dentists. Though several female characters have shown an interest in Gintoki, he usually does not show any response back and merely puts up with them as annoyances. However, he does have a huge crush on the weather girl, Ketsuno Ana, and once stated he wished to marry her. Gintoki has a great amount of pride for his samurai code. He takes it upon himself to rescue or avenge not only his comrades and friends but also people he barely knows (During the Shinsengumi Crisis arc, he told Kawakami Bansai that the sole reason he fought the Joi War was to protect his friends, not for his country or the samurai way). Despite being a dangerous combatant well-versed in the ways of the sword, he acts like a coward most of the time to avoid needless bloodshed because of the trauma of suffering the loss of most of his friends and allies during the Joui war. He is quite sadistic, much like Okita Sougo. This may explain the reason why Sougo feels a certain attachment to him as he addresses Gintoki as \\"Boss\\" every time they meet. This is can be shown where he always treats Katsura, Sarutobi and Hijikata, in various extreme ways and his tendencies of quitting easily on certain moments which can lead to a punishment and someone's death, in which he can handle easily and even enjoy it. He is very respectful of the memory of his teacher Yoshida Shouyou due to his actions (opening a school for poor children, with Gintoki there as the first student) He is extremely furious when someone dirties the name of being a master; when Jiraia called himself Tsukuyo's teacher yet harmed her emotionally and physically, his idea for what a teacher should be led Gintoki taking out his anger on Jiraia. Although he controls himself, he has shown a dark side in which he wants to slay those who were related in the death of his teacher. As a member of the Four Heavenly Kings, Gintoki is an extremely powerful swordsman. Throughout the series, he has demonstrated tremendous skill in swordsmanship, being able to fight on equal grounds against Utsuro, the evil persona of his master (whom Gintoki has never been able to win a match) or other Amanto that are considered the strongest in their respective class. His swordplay is rough, but far from unrefined. His level of skill has been noted by several esteemed sword masters that his sword style is something not taught, but developed by Gintoki himself. He tends to wield even full- length katanas one-handed, with fairly wide but quick chops. Gintoki is incredibly nimble, on par with the renowned ninja Hattori Zenzou. His strength is also remarkable, breaking through Bansai's strings, stated to be as strong as steel, and pull down his helicopter, with nothing but raw power. In addition, his reflexes (while often downplayed for comedic purposes) are incredible, and he is capable of dodging, deflecting, or in some instances, throwing back knives, arrows and similar projectiles. One of his defining traits is his very high level of physical endurance. Gintoki fights without consideration his own life a majority of the time, giving him the ability to fight without limits, completely apathetic to crippling/massive or mortal injuries he sustains during combat. When he is particularly angered, his speed and reflexes reach insane heights, allowing him to perform absurd feats such as shattering a sword mid-swing with his teeth, or closing meters of distance between him and his opponent in the fraction of a second. However, this is his biggest weakness: despite his physical abilities surpassing his enemies in this state, he's a berserker whose only goal in combat is to kill his enemy. This has led to Gintoki being defeated by enemies equal or stronger than him more than once in the series, as shown in the cases of Jirocho, Oboro, and Jiraia. As part of his brawler-like fighting style, Gintoki regularly uses his fists and legs in combat. As such, he is far less bothered by being caught unarmed than most other swordsmen in the series. He is also noticeably skilled in terms of battlefield tactics, likely due to his extensive experience, capable of developing adaptive strategies as he fights, and knows exactly what to look for in his opponent's fighting style to create openings for himself and exploit them. While he vastly prefers to make use of his incredible swordplay in combat, he is well-versed in other weapons as well, ranging from kunai to naginata. Likely due to his training as a samurai and time spent on the battlefield, he is able to incorporate the use of almost anything he finds in a fight, and frequently catches his opponents off-guard. His weapon of choice is a bokuto with the words \\"Lake Touya\\" inscribed on it. The bokuto he wields is a , which he purchases through a TV shopping program, whenever one is broken. Using this sword, he is often seen cutting, smashing, deflecting and basically destroying all kinds of strong objects such as a metal cannon, or deflecting a beam sword without noticeable damage. Occasionally, though, Gintoki has used other swords, including real ones such as katana, in combat when he needs it due to a tougher encounter. Although Gintoki is more than capable of defeating powerful Amanto warriors and various other samurai, he will not hesitate to use tricks and manipulation if it means a quick and easy victory.  In other media  Though also part of the Gin Tama franchise, Gintoki is also the lead character of the spinoff stories \\"3-Z Ginpachi- Sensei\\", where he is a high school teacher putting up with the idiocies of all of the other characters who are his students at the school. The two OVAs of the series also feature Gintoki with the first featuring multiple sidestories and the latter Gintoki's time in the war against the aliens. Gintoki has been the leading character in the two movies the series had. The first film, Gintama: A New Retelling Benizakura Arc, has Gintoki reprising his role from the Benizakura Arc where he goes in the search of his friend Kotaro Katsura as well as the mysterious sword Benizakura. The second film, Gintama: The Movie: The Final Chapter: Be Forever Yorozuya has Gintoki travelling to a future where Edo has been destroyed and has to stop the threat that ruined the city. Gintoki's character appeared in various video games based on the Gin Tama series. Gintoki has also been featured as a playable fighter in two crossover Weekly Shonen Jump-based video games: Jump Super Stars and Jump Ultimate Stars, both times alongside Kagura. He also appears as a playable character in J-Stars Victory Vs and The King of Fighters All Star. Gintoki's costume is also featured in the video game God Eater 2 as an alternative skin.  Reception  Gintoki remains the most popular character in the series based on polls taken within Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. He has also been featured in various types of merchandise connected to the franchise. In the Newtype Japanese journal, Gintoki has commonly appeared within the top ten of best male characters between the 7th and 8th spot. In another Newtype poll from March 2010, Gintoki was voted as the eighth most popular male anime character from the 2000s. In the Anime Grand Prix polls, Gintoki was voted as one of the most popular male anime character. The Japanese music distributor Recochoku has made two annual surveys of which anime characters that people would like to marry. Gintoki ranked second, then first in the category \\"The Character I Want to Be My Groom.\\" Another poll from Niconico had female fans voting Gintoki as the second most appealing male character in anime. Ike and Momiken from the Japanese rock band SPYAIR commented that Gintoki was their favorite character from the series as both of them found him cool. Gintoki's character has also received critical response from various western publications for manga, anime and other media. While reviewing the fifth volume from the manga Carlo Santos from Anime News Network found Gintoki's personality as one of the sources of comedy in the series, remarking the way he talks as well as his actions through the chapters. In the chapters where Gintoki suffers from amnesia, Santos noted that Gintoki's different personality in such state makes him \\"decidedly not funny\\". On the other hand, About.com writer Deb Aoki found Gintoki's carefree attitude and his desire to protect people as a \\"tradition of other shonen anti-heroes.\\" She also noted his \\"low-blood sugar moments\\" make him look cranky. Michael Aronson from Manga Life criticized Gintoki's expression in the first volumes from the series as he mentions it does not reflect his dialogues. He also commented that series succeeds if it is about Gintoki's job, adding that some of his fights against other characters do not help increasing the series' popularity. While reviewing the first film's Chris Homer from The Fandom Post stated that Gintoki is \\"a typical shounen hero, a bit dumb but has a kind heart and able to access power when he needs to protect his friends\\" with Kagura being more likable than him during the review. When the 2016 season of the anime season started, Gintoki parodied a Japanese politician, Ryutaro Nonomura, crying for misuse of fundings. While this had no negative consequences, the staff at Shueisha, the company that publishes the manga, admitted they felt nervous. Another parody was made by Gintoki in the 2017 release of the anime with he referencing the Gilgamesh Night show due to the series taking its timeslot. Anime News Network writer Amy McNulty had mixed feelings about Michael Daingerfield's work as Gintoki's English actor as she found it too similar to Hijikata and Katsura. On the other hand, Mike Toole, another member from Anime News Network, found Daingerfield's work as appealing as the one from the original cast, Tomokazu Sugita.

It tells the story of Zilia, a young Incan princess, who is abducted from the Temple of the Sun by the Spanish during the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire. In a series of letters to her fianc√© Aza, who is also the Sapa Inca, Zilia tells the story of her capture, her rescue by French sailors, her befriending of the captain D√©terville and her introduction to French society. Like Montesquieu's Lettres persanes, Lettres d'une P√©ruvienne presents a satirical view of French life, particularly the conditions of French women, through the eyes of an outsider. Zilia talks about language, literature, philosophy, education, and child rearing, among other subjects. To a much greater degree than Montesquieu, Fran√ßoise de Graffigny engages readers in a suspenseful story, turning on whether Zilia will be reunited with Aza or whether she will consent to marry D√©terville. Many readers and critics were unsatisfied by the conclusion, but when the author revised and expanded the novel for a new edition in 1752, she refused to change the ending. The inspiration for the novel came from seeing a performance of Alzire, Voltaire's play set during the Spanish conquest of Peru; immediately afterwards, in May 1743, she began to read the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega's History of the Incas, which supplied most of the historical background for the story.Dainard, ed., Correspondance, vol. 4, letters 557-558. Although only a small fragment of a manuscript exists, the process of composition can be followed in the author's correspondence.Vera L. Grayson, \\"The Genesis and Reception of Mme de Graffigny's Lettres d'une P√©ruvienne and C√©nie.\\" Studies on Voltaire 336 (1996), pp. 7-27. The novel was an immediate success with readers; by the end of 1748 there were fourteen editions, including three of an English translation. Over the next hundred years, more than 140 editions appeared, including the revised and expanded 1752 edition, several different English translations, two in Italian, and others in German, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish.See Smith, \\"Popularity\\". Contemporary critics, including Pierre Cl√©ment, √âlie Catherine Fr√©ron, Joseph de La Porte, and Guillaume Thomas Fran√ßois Raynal, wrote long and mostly favorable reviews. Several articles in Diderot's Encyclop√©die quote the novel. A number of sequels were written, often to \\"improve\\" on the author's d√©nouement; the most famous was Lettres d'Aza, by Ignace Hugary de Lamarche-Courmont, published in 1748 and frequently reprinted with the original novel.For excerpts from the reviews and sequels, see Mallinson's edition of the novel. The popularity of Lettres d'une P√©ruvienne faded after 1830, but it enjoyed a strong revival of interest in the last third of the twentieth century, thanks in part to new scholarship and in part to the new interest in women writers generated by the feminist movement.

The screenplay by Laird Doyle, Lillie Hayward and Roy Chanslor based on the novel Women Are Bum Newspapermen by Richard Macauley. Plot Ellen Garfield refuses to marry fellow reporter Curt Devlin until he admits she is as good at her craft as any man. The two work for rival newspapers, and their ongoing efforts to better each other eventually leads to Ellen getting fired when Curt tricks her into misreporting the verdict of a murder trial. The tables are turned when she scoops him by getting the real perpetrator, Inez Cordoza, to confess to the crime. Forced to admit Ellen is a good reporter, he finally wins her hand. Cast * Bette Davis as Ellen Garfield * George Brent as Curt Devlin * Roscoe Karns as Toots O'Grady * Wini Shaw as Inez Cordoza * Walter Walker as Judge Hugo Rickard * J.

The plots of the 1937 release Back in Circulation, allegedly based on a story by Adela Rogers St. Johns, and the 1938 Torchy Blane film Blondes at Work are very similar to Front Page Woman.Front Page Woman at Turner Classic Movies The Warner Bros. release was one of three 1935 films co-starring Bette Davis and George Brent. The two were paired on-screen a total of thirteen times. This was the fourth collaboration for Davis and director Michael Curtiz. The two worked together a total of seven times. Critical reception The New York Times said, \\"The three writers who adapted it . . . did a clever script job and Michael Curtiz directed at a brisk pace. Add to that a cast with a neat sense of comedy and you have an excellent tonic for the mid-July doldrums.\\"New York Times review Variety said, \\"[It] lacks authenticity and is so far fetched it'll hand newsscribes around the country a constant run of ripples.

He has also been made a Reverend for a Dirty Sanchez prank on Matthew Pritchard and Mike \\"Pancho\\" Locke. Joyce married his girlfriend Suzie Hogan in June 2012, he lives with her and their dog Max. In May 2015, Suzie revealed they are expecting their first child together. His first daughter, Margot Joyce, was born on the 23 October 2015. Dirty Sanchez Joyce's role in Dirty Sanchez is not as practical as the others. He is the only English man in the group, making him something of a black sheep when considering the other members' strong Welsh accents. He is well known for his distinctive laugh, something which the other members of Dirty Sanchez have likened to a \\"machine gun\\", and is often clad in fake Burberry clothing, mostly in the form of shirts, jackets or boxers. On the DVD for the first series, a psychologist says that Joyce seems more committed in laughing at and encouraging the rest of the crew's acts than participating, though he does often participate. On some occasions the rest of the crew have mentioned that Joyce cannot take a joke properly, as seen when a man tries to throw him into a tub full of ragworms; Joyce lashes out at him for dirtying his ¬£240 Burberry jacket, but is placated by the others. Joyce denies these claims, and simply says that \\"If it doesn't seem fun, I'm not going to do it\\". Stunts As opposed to performing some of the more pain-related stunts, Joyce is far more willing than the other Sanchez members to performing acts involving ingestion, which include drinking Pancho's fat from the non-anaesthetic liposuction done as part of the movie, eating the end of Pritchard's little finger after having it chopped off (which he spat out), eating pubic hair on a pizza and (attempting) to drink a glass of sweat collected from the Dirty Sanchez team. He is also well known for stunts that end up involving him eating his own, or other people's, vomit. Other appearances He is featured in the Gumball 3000 documentary film, 3000 Miles. He is also featured in a Nitro Circus episode along with Bam Margera where he is seen filming Travis Pastrana and friends doing a base jump from a hotel.

Life  Breitinger studied theology and philology and first earned recognition from 1730 through a new edition of the Septuaginta. From 1731 he worked as Professor of Hebrew and later of Greek in the gymnasium in Z√ºrich. Breitinger was however best known for his collaborations with his friend Johann Jakob Bodmer. In their joint work it cannot always to be distinguished, from whom most of the suggestions came. The main part of the historical collection Thesaurus Historicae Helveticae (1735) may be attributed to Breitinger. Breitinger's principal work Critische Dichtkunst (1740) was a rejection of the traditional poetic principle of imitation of nature for the benefit of the creative imagination; it had a big influence on German literary theory and the burgeoning genius cult. In this context was also the literary-historically significant dispute of Bodmer and Breitinger with Johann Christoph Gottsched.

The recognizable transmission line in the area is the so-called \\"Edison Corridor\\": two double-circuit 345 kV lines (portions of it became single circuit) and two 120 kV lines with one heading toward the northeast starting from the Bismark Substation to the Lenox Substation. This corridor extends through Warren from the Stephens Substation and through Sterling Heights and Utica, and finally Shelby and Washington Townships. ITC Transmission has spent approximately $1.2 billion in capital investments in rebuilding electric infrastructure in the metro-Detroit area since 2003. According to the 2012 SGS Statistical Services Transmission Reliability Benchmark Study, ITC Transmission was also ranked in the top 10% of electric utilities in terms of operational performance based on sustained outage performance data. =Michigan Electric Transmission Company (METC)= In October 2006, ITC Holdings Corp. completed the acquisition of METC, or Michigan Electric Transmission Company. Largely overlapping Consumers Energy's area, METC system uses line voltages of 345,000, 230,000 and 138,000 volts. Consumers retained its radial 138 kV lines. METC installed a line that is designed for 230kv running from Traverse City northeast to Kalkaska, Michigan particularly made of steel poles with three insulators or conductors, known as the Keystone to Clearwater Line. Though the line was constructed for 230 kV operation, it remains operating at 138 kV until further upgrades are completed. METC has four 345 kV interconnections with American Electric Power, via AEP's Indiana Michigan Power division: Palisades-Cook #1, Palisades-Cook #2, Argenta-Robinson Park and Argenta-Twin Branch. METC has six other 138kV interconnections with other utilities: one 138kV interconnection each with Northern Indiana Public Service Company (Barton-Batavia line) and Alpena Power Company; two with the Cloverland Electric Cooperative (on former Edison Sault Electric Company facilities) in the eastern part of Michigan's Upper Peninsula (McGulpin-Straits #1 and McGulpin-Straits #2; these lines are submerged under the Straits of Mackinac); and two 138 kV interconnections with the Lansing Board of Water & Light (Davis-Oneida line and the Davis-Enterprise line). METC also completed capital projects including the 138 kV rebuild project near East Tawas, and the 138 kV Oakland-Tihart line. METC includes 5,600 circuit miles of transmission lines, with 36,900 transmission towers and poles and 98 stations and substations across the majority of Michigan‚Äôs lower peninsula. According to the 2012 SGS Statistical Services Transmission Reliability Benchmark Study, METC was ranked among the top 10% of electric utilities in terms of operational performance based on sustained outage performance data. =Interconnections between ITC Transmission and METC= There are four 345 kV interconnections between the ITC and METC systems to the west of DTE Electric's service area (Majestic-Tompkins line, Majestic-Battle Creek-Oneida line, Jewell-Thetford line, and the Pontiac-Hampton line), plus five 120/138 kV interconnections (the Custer-Whiting line, Genoa-Latson line, Hemphill- Hunters Creek line, Washtenaw-Lark-Blackstone line and the Atlanta-Thetford- Karn line). In addition, the Michigan Thumb Loop line that runs within the DTE service area will interconnect with Consumers / METC's Pontiac-Hampton line at the new Bauer Substation in Tuscola County, northeast of Frankenmuth. Another major interconnection point between the ITC and METC systems is the Morocco Substation in Deerfield Township in Lenawee County, near the county line with Monroe County. The substation serves to connect the two 138kv Beecher-Whiting circuits that run between Adrian and Consumers' J. R. Whiting Generating Complex on Lake Erie with the 345kv Majestic-Lemoyne line. This is designed to relieve stress on the transmission system after the anticipated closure of the Whiting plant in 2016.ITC Capital Project Profile: Morocco substation, February 2015. ITC Midwest ITC Midwest LLC has transmission systems in portions of Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois and Missouri. This subsidiary was created on December 20, 2007 with ITC's acquisition of Interstate Power and Light Company's transmission system. ITC Midwest owns and operates 6,600 circuit miles of transmission lines with 262 stations and substations. Since 2008, ITC Midwest has completed 16 new generator interconnects, adding approximately 2,137 megawatts of wind energy production capacity to the grid. This additional amount is more than the total installed wind capacity that existed in Iowa in 2007. ITC Great Plains ITC Great Plains, a transmission-only utility, is a subsidiary of ITC Grid Development, LLC, which in turn is wholly owned by ITC Holdings Corp. ITC Great Plains became an independent transmission company member of the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) in September 2006. It is the only ITC Holdings operating company with a \\"greenfield\\" business model that is not predicated on acquiring other companies‚Äô systems.

The Providence Painter is the conventional name given to a painter of the Attic red-figure style. He was active around 470 BC. The Providence Painter is considered to have been a pupil of the Berlin Painter. His reputation is that of a careful artist at the transition from Archaic to Classical art. He had difficulties shedding Archaic habits. For example, he tended to faithfully follow Archaic traditions in depicting anatomical detail or clothing. Short narrative scenes are known only from some of his larger vases, such as stamnoi and hydriai depicting groups of deities or mythical events. Usually, however, he painted smaller vases, such as Nolan amphorae or lekythoi. One of his favourite motifs are women under pursuit. Generally, he usually depicts women as running or rushing. He also frequently uses scenes of domestic women, such as weaving. The Providence Painter is often fond of using Athena and Nike (winged woman). Details of his paintings, such as eyes, earrings, ankles or certain plant ornaments are reminiscent of the Berlin Painter. Several of his vases carry a kalos inscription dedicated to Glaukon. The Providence takes his name from a big neck amphora depicting Apollo located in Providence Rhode Island.Gisela Marie Augusta Richter, Attic Red-Figure Vases (Yale University Press, 1958), 74 Although the Providence painter focused on Lekythoi, he did create some amphoras, perhaps because his teacher, the Berlin painter decorated a series of amphoras in his middle period and during this phase the Providence painter learned from the Berlin painter.Martin Robertson, The Art of vase-painting in classical Athens (Cambridge University, 1992), 174 The Berlin Painter was also the first potter to popularize the use of red-figure on smaller pots, such as the lekthoi, as the Providence Painter has done. The Providence Painter also followed his master with the use of his distinctive symmetrical meander pattern. The Providence Painter mirrored many aspects of the Berlin Painter, suggesting he worked for some time in the Berlin painter‚Äôs workshop. But, unlike his master, the Providence painter used white ground with outline drawing on some of his smaller vases, a popular technique of lekythoi pottery. The Providence painter can also be compared to Hermonax, a red-figure Athens painter active between 470 and 440 BC. Hermonax may have also been in the same workshop as the Berlin and Providence painters, as he shows many similarities. Hermonax is seen as the lesser artist though, as his techniques are not as well executed. For example, he does not draw the meander pattern as well as the Berlin and Providence painters.

The saga recounts a war between Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Earl of Orkney, and Karl, whom it calls king of Scots. The question of his identity and historicity has been debated by historians of Scotland and the Northern Isles for more than a century. However a literal translation suggests that the name may simply be an insult. Saga The Orkneyinga Saga says that a dispute between Thorfinn Sigurdsson and Karl Hundason began when Karl Hundason became \\"King of Scots\\" and claimed Caithness. According to the Orkneyinga Saga, in the war which followed, Thorfinn defeated Karl in a sea-battle off Deerness at the east end of the Orkney Mainland. Then Karl's nephew Mutatan or Muddan, appointed to rule Caithness for him, was killed at Thurso by Thorkel the Fosterer. Finally, a great battle at Tarbat Ness on the south side of the Dornoch Firth ended with Karl defeated and fugitive or dead. Thorfinn, the saga says, then marched south through Scotland as far as Fife, burning and plundering as he passed. A later note in the saga claims that Thorfinn won nine Scottish earldoms.Orkneyinga Saga, cc. 20 & 32. Whoever Karl son of Hundi may have been, it is thought that the saga is reporting a local conflict, perhaps with a Scots ruler of Moray or Ross: > [T]he whole narrative is consistent with the idea that the struggle of > Thorfinn and Karl is a continuation of that which had been waged since the > ninth century by the Orkney earls, notably Sigurd Rognvald's son, Ljot, and > Sigurd the Stout, against the princes or mormaers of Moray, Sutherland, > Ross, and Argyll, and that, in fine, Malcolm and Karl were mormaers of one > of these four provinces.Taylor, p. 338; Crawford, pp. 71-74.Taylor's comment > about \\"Sigurd Rognvald's son, Ljot\\" is almost certainly a reference to Earl > Ljot Thorfinnsson, the son of Thorfinn Torf-Einarsson. Canmore states that > the battle at Skitten Mire where Ljot Thorfinnsson was mortally wounded in > battle with Macbeth took place between 943 and 945. He was the only 'Ljot' > that was an Earl of Orkney and there is no other individual with this name > in the index of either Thomson (2001) or Crawford (1987).\\"Upper Bowertower, > Stone Lud\\". Canmore. Retrieved 27 January 2014.Muir (2005) p. 21 Interpretations The identity of Karl Hundason, unknown to Scots and Irish sources, has long been a matter of dispute. William Forbes Skene in his Highlanders of Scotland attempted to reconcile the conflicting witnesses of the Irish annals and the sagas. Skene's proposal was that Karl (or Kali) Hundason should be identified with one \\"Malcolm MacKenneth\\", a son of Kenneth III of Scotland (Cin√°ed mac Duib), presented as the successor of Malcolm II (M√°el Coluim mac Cin√°eda) in the northern parts of the kingdom while Duncan I (Donnchad mac Cr√≠n√°in) ruled in the south.Skene, The Highlanders of Scotland, Volume 1, Chapter 5. This theory was criticised by Robertson as being unnecessarily complex. Instead Robertson proposed that Hundason should be identified with Duncan I.Robertson, Scotland under her early kings, Volume II, pp. 477-479. The most popular candidate to be Karl Hundason is King Macbeth (Mac Bethad mac Findl√°ich),Thus, for example, the Dictionary of National Biography; Williams, Smyth & Kirby, Biographical Dictionary of Dark Age Britain, pp. 106-107. whose father may be called \\"jarl Hundi\\" in Nj√°l's saga.Crawford, p. 72. However, the existence of Karl Hundason rests solely on the Orkneyinga saga, and more particularly on those elements of Arn√≥rr jarlask√°ld's √û√≥rfinnsdr√°pa which are preserved in the saga. A degree of scepticism has been expressed by many writers from Robertson onwards, some going to so far as to suggest that the whole episode is poetic invention.Anderson, ESSH, p. 576, note 7, refers to the account as \\"a fabulous story\\" and concludes that \\"[n]o solution to the riddle seems to be justified\\". See also Robertson, Scotland under her early kings, Volume II, pp. 478-479, where most of the account is rejected. Most recently Alex Woolf has suggested that the identity of Karl Hundason has been in plain sight all along. The Saga, when dealing with Thorfinn's childhood, mentions a brother named \\"Hvelp or Hundi\\" who was taken to Norway by King Olaf Trygvasson and died there.Orkneyinga Saga, c. 12. Woolf proposes that Karl Hundason, rather that being some hitherto unknown Scots king, was the son of Thorfinn's brother Hlodver Hundi.Woolf, pp. 309-310. However, Thomson had already discussed this possibility in 2001, and urged caution as both Orkenyinga saga and St Olaf's saga suggest he only lived \\"a short while\\" and was unlikely to have had a son himself.Thomson, pp. 75-77 Muir (2005) points out that a literal translation of \\"Karl Hundisson\\" is \\"peasant son-of-a-dog\\", an insult that may have been obvious to Norse-speakers hearing the saga and that \\"we can assume this wasn't his real name\\".Muir (2005) p. 47 The implication is that there is no purpose in seeking phonetic parallels with known Scots personages. Thomson points out that both \\"Karl\\" and Hundi\\" are names used in other contexts without disparaging intentions although the combination is otherwise unknown.

It is their most commercially successful album to date, having reached number 34 in the UK Albums Chart. It was the final recording bassist Tony Reeves made with the group, leaving Greenslade shortly after the LP was completed. Cover art Wanting to move away from the style of artwork exemplified by Roger Dean's covers for their first two albums, Greenslade had Marcus Keef do the cover for Spyglass Guest, with the idea of using a live black panther suggested by Dave Lawson. Background and recording As with their first two albums, Greenslade prepared for Spyglass Guest by extensively rehearsing at a church hall in Middlesex. However, whereas half of the songs on their first albums were written collaboratively, on Spyglass Guest the band members did not give any input into each other's songs, writing them individually. Dave Greenslade said he could not say why this was, since they were all getting along well with each other. Their recording efforts were also more individualized: Dave Greenslade did not play on any of the three Dave Lawson compositions, Tony Reeves was absent from all but one of them, and Dave Lawson in turn did not play on \\"Spirit of the Dance\\". This was in part because, due to the band being worked so hard by their management, Dave Greenslade asked Dave Lawson to write a song to be used as a solo spot for himself, in order to reduce rehearsal time. Lawson came up with several pieces, with \\"Red Light\\" being selected as his solo spot, but another, \\"Rainbow\\", was also put on the album due to a shortage of material. While Greenslade had produced their previous album, Bedside Manners Are Extra, by themselves, they felt they needed someone in the studio to provide an outside opinion. They selected Jeremy Ensor (formerly bassist of the Principal Edwards Magic Theatre), who was their roadie at the time. Unlike their previous recording sessions, the band were doing concerts at the time, and so the album took considerably longer to record. Scheduled to start on 13 May 1974, recording actually commenced on 15 May and ended on 6 June. The sessions also broke from the \\"live\\" style of recording used for their first two albums; for example, Dave Lawson's parts on \\"Joie De Vivre\\" were recorded after all the other tracks for the song had already been laid down.Spyglass Guest press kit, 1974. Spyglass Guest includes the only cover song Greenslade ever recorded, \\"Theme for an Imaginary Western\\", which Dave Greenslade and Tony Reeves had already performed with their previous band Colosseum both live and in the studio. The song was recorded against the objections of Dave Lawson, who felt it did not suit his playing style. Despite his objections, and despite the fact that he recorded all of the vocals for Spyglass Guest while being treated for a collapsed lung, most fans regard Lawson's vocal performance on \\"Theme for an Imaginary Western\\" to be a highlight of the track. The album also includes one of only two Greenslade songs to employ an outside songwriter (the other is \\"Hallelujah Anyway\\" from Large Afternoon), \\"Joie De Vivre\\". After coming up with the music and title for the song, Dave Greenslade asked around for someone who could write lyrics that would suit the title and overall atmosphere, and the band's publishing company recommended Martin Hall. When Andrew McCulloch suggested the phrase \\"spyglass guest\\" from Hall's lyrics for the song be used as the album title, the rest of the band happily agreed, though Dave Greenslade admitted in a 2018 interview that he still has no idea what the phrase means. Feeling that they had proven the concept of two keyboardists and no guitars with their first two albums, the band decided to bring in guitarists when they felt the songs called for it. Clem Clempson was Greenslade's former bandmate in Colosseum, while Andy Roberts and violinist Graham Smith both came at the recommendation of Greenslade's wife, who worked as a secretary for Tony Stratton-Smith, founder of the Charisma Records label which Roberts and Smith had both recorded for.

Life and career  Aleramo was born as Marta Felicina Faccio (a.k.a. \\"Rina\\") in Alessandria, Piedmont and grew up in Milan. At 11, she moved with her family to Civitanova Marche, where her father had been appointed manager of a glass factory. Unable to continue her education beyond primary school, Aleramo continued to study on her own, seeking advice from her former teacher about what to read. While employed in the same factory where her father worked, she was raped in an empty office room by Ulderico Pierangeli, a co-worker ten years her senior, when she was only 15. Rina did not tell her parents about the event, and when Pierangeli asked for her hand, she was persuaded by her family to marry him. A year and a half later, at 17, she had her first and only child, Walter.Drake, Richard. Sibilla Aleramo and the Peasants of the Agro Romano: A Writer's Dilemma. Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 51, No. 2 (Apr. ‚Äì Jun. 1990), pp. 255‚Äì272 Pierangeli was abusive and violent and in 1901 Aleramo moved to Rome with her son. After a brief relationship with a young artist, Felice Damiani, she lived together for some years with Giovanni Cena, a writer and journalist, who encouraged her to turn her life story into a fictionalized memoir (and to take on the pseudonym of Sibilla Aleramo). In 1906 her first novel, Una donna (A Woman), a chronicle of a woman's decision to leave her brutal husband, was published. She also became active in political and artistic circles, especially Futurism, and engaged in volunteer work in the Agro Romano, the poverty-stricken countryside surrounding Rome. In those years she also engaged in tumultuous love affairs, with Umberto Boccioni and Dino Campana. (The 2002 film Un viaggio chiamato amore, by Michele Placido, depicts Aleramo's affair with the latter). In 1908, while still involved with Cena, she met Cordula \\"Lina\\" Poletti at a suffragette's congress. The two women started a relationship, later recounted in the novel Il passaggio (The Crossing, 1919), a book in which Aleramo also modified some of the events told in Una donna, arguing that Giovanni Cena had originally convinced her to slightly change her story. In the following years Aleramo became one of Italy's leading feminists. In 1925 she supported the Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals. Later in life, Aleramo toured the continent and was active in Communist politics after World War II. In 1948 she took part to the World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace in Wroc≈Çaw. Aleramo famously said that she felt like she lived three lives. The first one, as a mother and wife, was outlined in her novel Una donna. Her second one was when she volunteered in a shelter for homeless people in Rome run by the Unione Femminile and was active in feminist organizations. Her ‚Äòthird life‚Äô consisted of in the 30 years she spent writing about her life experiences in her work. Aleramo passed away in Rome at the age of 83.  Legacy  Aleramo's life is mostly significant for her trail-blazing trajectory as an independent woman and artist, and as an individual that lived through different ages (Liberal Italy, Fascism, Post- World War II, the advent of the Italian Republic) while always maintaining cultural and political visibility. Her personal correspondence with Poletti have, in more recent years, been studied due to their open-minded view on homosexual relationships. Aleramo's first book in particular, Una donna, is considered a classic of Italian literature, and the first outspokenly feminist novel written by an Italian author.

The ship participated in the Winter War. The ship was originally constructed as the passenger vessel SS Halland by the Swedish shipyard Lindholmens. She was renamed into Bore II during a sejour with another shipping company. She was bought in 1930 by the Finnish businessman Hans von Rettig, who rebuilt the ship into a luxurious yacht, and renamed her SS Seagull. He donated the ship to the Finnish state in 1936, to be used as a presidential yacht. She was then given the name SS Aura. She was taken over by the Finnish Navy when the Winter War erupted in 1939, and since the name Aura already was taken by another vessel, she was given a new name, SS Aura II. The last mission On 13 January 1940, Aura II was escorting a convoy across the Sea of √Öland. The small convoy consisted of the cargo vessels SS Anneberg, SS Hebe and the passenger vessel SS Bore I. When they passed M√§rket Island, the escort vessel Tursas noticed torpedo tracks in the water. Soon thereafter a submarine surfaced 300 m on the port side. Tursas sounded the alarm and tried to ram the Soviet submarine. Aura II followed and dropped three depth charges, and soon an oil slick was seen on the water surface. It was the Soviet submarine ShCh-324, which had been trying to sink the largest of the transport vessels Anneberg. However, the torpedo went between Anneberg and Hebe. Seeing the oil slick, Aura II decided to finish off the submarine. Two more depth charges were fired, but a third depth charge exploded in its thrower. The 135 kg trotyl charge completely tearing the wooden ship apart. 26 men died and 15 were saved.

He served as a Black Loyalist in the American Revolutionary War when the war was lost the British then evacuated him to Nova Scotia. In 1792 he joined nearly 1200 freedmen for resettlement in Sierra Leone, where they set up a colony of free people of color. Harry had been born in Gambia and sold into slavery as a war captive. He was purchased by George Washington, who had plantations in Virginia. During the American Revolutionary War, Harry Washington escaped from slavery in Virginia and served as a corporal in the Black Pioneers attached to a British artillery unit. After the war he was among Black Loyalists resettled by the British in Nova Scotia, where they were granted land. There Washington married Jenny, another freed American slave. In 1792 the couple were among more than 1,000 freedmen chosen to migrate to Sierra Leone, West Africa, where the British had established a new colony of people of African descent. In 1800 Washington joined a rebellion against the British colonial authorities in the Sierra Leone Colony. He was exiled to the Bullom Shore, where he subsequently died. Early life Washington was a saltwater slave (a term for American slaves born in Africa, rather than in North America), born in the Gambia River in West Africa around 1740. In the colony of Virginia, he was purchased in 1763 to be part of George Washington's workforce in the Great Dismal Swamp of southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina.Black Loyalist, Harry Washington, University of SydneyBlackPast.org. Washington later went to work on one of the Washington plantations in Mount Vernon, Virginia Colony.Papers of George Washington: Colonial Series, vol. 7, pp. 300, 314-15, 442-3, 516. In 1771 he escaped from Mount Vernon and took refuge in New York,Henry Wiencek, An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2003. but later returned to his master. He had been working in the stables at Mount Vernon, caring for Washington's horses, when he fled again in 1776 to join the Virginia Ethiopian Regiment, established from escaped slaves by Royal Governor Lord Dunmore during the American Revolutionary War. Dunmore had recruited slaves of rebel masters, promising them freedom if they joined the British military effort. American Revolutionary War Moving to New York in late 1776, Washington served as corporal in the Loyalist Black Pioneers, attached to a British artillery unit and part of the British forces in Governor Lord Dunmore's fleet. The British occupied New York City through much of the war. At the end of the American Revolution, Washington was one of about 3,000 Black Loyalists evacuated from New York by the British and resettled in Nova Scotia. The Crown granted the Loyalists land there. When Sir Guy Carleton's officials included him on the list for evacuation in the \\"Register of Negroes\\", Washington gave his age as forty-three and said he had fled Mount Vernon in 1776. Emigration to Nova Scotia and then Sierra Leone Under General Sir Guy Carleton's policy, Henry Washington took a British ship to Nova Scotia (as did two other former Mount Vernon slaves, a man and a woman).Washington is listed as leaving New York in the Book of Negroes, where he is incorrectly listed with the name Henry. He is called Harry in all other documents. (\\"The Book of Negroes\\", Black Loyalist). He lived for several years in Birchtown, Nova Scotia, Canada, which had become the largest free African-American city in North America. There he married Jenny, another freed slave, and they began to plan for their future. Discontented with conditions in Nova Scotia, he and his wife chose to join the 1,192 black colonists who migrated to Sierra Leone, West Africa (see Nova Scotian Settlers), a new colony founded by the British in West Africa.List of Blacks who gave their name for Sierra Leone\\" in National Archives of the UK, CO217/63. He planned to begin a farm, using scientific farming techniques he had learned at Mount Vernon. Rebellion in Sierra Leone In 1800 Washington was among several hundred settlers who rose up in a brief rebellion against British rule. The precipitating issue was one familiar from the American Revolution: taxation. The Sierra Leone Company, which ran the colony for the British government, required the settlers to pay taxes, called quitrents, for using their land, which land remained the property of the company. The rebels formed a provisional government and wrote a set of laws, which they nailed to the office door of a company administrator. Internal exile and death The Sierra Leone Company responded by sending a corps of recently arrived black Jamaican maroons against the rebels. In the trials that followed the defeat of the rebellion, Washington was among the rebels sentenced to banishment to Bullom Shore, another location in Sierra Leone. He became one of the two leaders of a new settlement but died there of disease.Cassandra Pybus, \\"Washington's Revolution, Harry that is not George\\", Journal of Atlantic Studies, Vol. 3, No. 2, 2006, 183-198.

Latin-based alphabets Background The Latin script was introduced to Fula-speaking regions of West and Central Africa by Europeans during, and in some cases immediately before, invasion. Various people ‚Äî missionaries, colonial administrators, and scholarly researchers ‚Äî devised various ways of writing . One issue similar to other efforts by Europeans to use their alphabet and home orthographic conventions was how to write African languages with unfamiliar sounds. In the case of Fula, these included how to represent sounds such as the implosive b and d, the ejective y, the velar n (the latter being present in European languages, but never in initial position), prenasalised consonants, and long vowels, all of which can change meaning. Major influences on the current forms used for writing Fula were decisions made by colonial administrators in Northern Nigeria and the Africa Alphabet. Post independence African governments decided to retain the Latin alphabet as the basis for transcribing their languages. Various writers in Fula, such as Amadou Hampate Ba and Alfa Ibrahim Sow, wrote and published in this script. Major UNESCO- sponsored conferences on harmonising Latin-based African language orthographies in Bamako in 1966 and Niamey in 1978 confirmed standards for writing Fula. Nevertheless, orthographies for the language and its variants are determined at the country level. So while Fula writing uses basically the same character sets and rules across the region, there are some minor variations. Orthography Some general rules: *Vowels **Long vowels are doubled **Two different vowels are never used together *Consonants **To accentuate a consonant, double the consonant (or write ‚ü®'‚ü© before the consonant; e.g., \\"temmeere\\" = \\"te'meere\\".) Alphabets by country =Senegal, The Gambia, Mauritania= * a, aa, b, mb, …ì, c, d, nd, …ó, e, ee, f, g, ng, h, i, ii, j, nj, k, l, m, n, ≈ã, √±, o, oo, p, r, s, t, u, uu, w, x, y, ∆¥ = Guinea = * a, b, …ì, nb, c, d, …ó, e, f, g, …†, ng, h, i, j, nj, k, l, m, n, …≤, ≈ã, o, p, r, s, t, u, w, y, ∆¥ Prior to adoption of this system in 1989, the Guinean languages alphabet was used. This was based on the simple Latin alphabet with digraphs for the sounds particular to Pular, and is still used by some Pular speakers (in part because it can be typed using commercial keyboards). The character equivalents include: bh = …ì ; dh = …ó ; q = …† ; ny = …≤ (the French digraph gn is also used); nh = ≈ã ; yh = ∆¥. The old system also included: ty = c ; dy = j. = Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Liberia = * a, b, …ì, c, d, …ó, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, mb, n, nd, ng, nj, ≈ã, √±, o, p, r, s, t, u, w, y, ∆¥, ' =Mali, Burkina Faso= * a, aa, b, mb, …ì, c, d, nd, …ó, e, ee, f, g, ng, h, i, ii, j, nj, k, l, m, n, ≈ã, …≤, o, oo, p, r, s, t, u, uu, w, x, y, ∆¥ = Niger, Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic = * a, aa, b, mb, …ì, c, d, nd, …ó, e, ee, f, g, ng, h, i, ii, j, nj, k, l, m, n, ≈ã, ny, o, oo, p, r, s, t, u, uu, w, x, y, ∆¥ = Nigeria = * a, aa, b, mb, …ì, c, d, nd, …ó, e, ee, f, g, ng, h, i, ii, j, nj, k, l, m, n, ny, o, oo, p, r, s, t, u, uu, w, x, y, ['y] Arabic (Ajami) alphabet The Arabic script was introduced into the West African Sahel with Islam several centuries before European colonization. As was the case with other languages such as Hausa, Muslim Fulas who went through Koranic education adapted the script to writing their language. This practice, while never formally standardized, followed some patterns of customary use in various regions. These usages differ on some details, mainly on how to represent certain consonants and vowels not present in the Arabic language. Adlam script During the late 1980s an alphabetic script was devised by the teenaged brothers Ibrahima and Abdoulaye Barry, in order to represent the Fulani language.The Alphabet That Will Save a People From Disappearing, Kaveh Waddell, Nov 16, 2016, The Atlantic After several years of development it started to be widely adopted among Fulani communities, and is currently taught in Guinea, Nigeria, Liberia and other nearby countries. The name adlam is an acronym derived from the first four letters of the alphabet (A, D, L, M), standing for Alkule Danday…óe Le√±ol Mulugol (\\"the alphabet that protects the peoples from vanishing\\"). There are Android apps to send SMS in adlam and to learn the alphabet.Winden Jangen ADLaM: Cellphone Applications On computers running Microsoft Windows, the adlam script is natively supported as part of the upcoming feature update of Windows 10 version 1903 (codenamed 19H1) build 18252.Announcing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 18252 Unicode The extended Latin characters used in the Latin transcription of Fula were incorporated since an early version of the Unicode Standard. At least some of the extended Arabic characters used in Ajami are also in the Unicode standard. The Adlam alphabet was added to the Unicode Standard in June 2016 with the release of version 9.0. Other scripts There has been at least one effort to adapt the N'Ko alphabet to the Pular language of Guinea.

He was also a professional draughtsman. Life and writings Tregellas was the eldest son of John Tabois Tregellas (1792‚Äì1863), merchant at Truro, purser of Cornish mines, and author of many stories written in the local dialect of the county; John Tabois Tregellas married at St. Mary's, Truro, on 23 Oct. 1828, Anne (1801‚Äì1867), second daughter of Richard Hawken. Walter was educated under his uncle, John Hawken, at Trevarth School, Gwennap, from 1838 to 1845, and from 1845 to 1847 at the grammar school of Truro. Tregellas was from youth fond of drawing, and won prizes as an artist at the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society, Falmouth, from 1846 to 1848. He began his active life as a draughtsman in the War Office on 10 July 1855, was promoted to be second draughtsman on 28 February 1860, rose to be chief draughtsman on 24 May 1866, and retained the post until 1 August 1893. He died at Deal on 28 May 1894, and was buried in its cemetery on 30 May. He married at Holy Trinity Church, Brompton, on 2 November 1861, Zoe, third daughter of Charles Lucas (1808‚Äì1869). His wife survived him; they had no issue. Writings Tregellas was the author of an anonymous volume on China, the Country, History, and People, published by the Religious Tract Society (1867).

The most useful tests are Melzer's reagent and potassium hydroxide.  Ammonia  Household ammonia can be used. A couple of drops are placed on the flesh. For example, Boletus spadiceus gives a fleeting blue to blue-green reaction.  Iron salts  Iron salts are used commonly in Russula and Bolete identification. It is best to dissolve the salts in water (typically a 10% solution) and then apply to the flesh, but it is sometimes possible to apply the dry salts directly to see a color change. For example, the white flesh of Boletus chrysenteron stains lemon-yellow or olive. Three results are expected with the iron salts tests: no change indicates a negative reaction; a color change to olive, green or blackish green; or a color change to reddish-pink.  Meixner test for amatoxins  The Meixner test (also known as the Wieland test) uses concentrated hydrochloric acid and newspaper to test for the deadly amatoxins found in some species of Amanita, Lepiota, and Galerina. The test yields false positives for some compounds, such as psilocin.  Melzer's reagent  Melzer's reagent can be used to test whether spores are amyloid, nonamyloid, or dextrinoid. * Spores that stain bluish-gray to bluish-black are amyloid * Spores that stain brown to reddish-brown are dextrinoid This test is normally performed on white spored mushrooms. If the spores are not light colored, a change will not be readily apparent. It is easiest to see the color change under a microscope, but it is possible to see it with the naked eye with a good spore print.  Paradimethylaminobenzaldehyde  In the genus Lyophyllum the lamellae usually turn blue with the application of para-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (PDAB or pDAB).  Phenol  A 2‚Äì3% aqueous solution of phenol gives a color change in some species when applied to the cap or stem.  Potassium hydroxide  A 3‚Äì10% solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH) gives a color change in some species of mushrooms: * In Agaricus, some species such as A. xanthodermus turn yellow with KOH, many have no reaction, and A. subrutilescens turns green. * Distinctive change occurs for some species of Cortinarius and Boletes  Schaeffer reaction  Developed by Julius Sch√§ffer to help with the identification of Agaricus species. A positive reaction of Schaeffer's test, which uses the reaction of aniline and nitric acid on the surface of the mushroom, is indicated by an orange to red color; it is characteristic of species in the section Flavescentes. The compounds responsible for the reaction were named schaefferal A and B to honor Sch√§ffer. Two intersecting lines are drawn on the surface of the cap, the first with aniline or aniline water, the second with an aqueous solution of 65% nitric acid. The test is considered positive when a bright orange color forms where the lines cross. Agaricus placomyces and Agaricus xanthodermus produce false negative reactions.

In September 2011 the gallery announced Amanda Coulson, as the new Director and 4 new staff appointments. John Cox joined the gallery in January 2012 as Chief Curator. The National Art Gallery of The Bahamas (NAGB) was the first institution of its kind in the history of The Bahamas, announced in 1996, by then-Prime Minister, Hubert A. Ingraham, as part of a larger expanded system of museums that would record, preserve and historicize the narrative of the independent sovereign nation, established in 1973. The NAGB is housed in the historic Villa Doyle (see below) situated on West and West Hill Streets, in Historic Charles Towne and on the border of Delancy Town, and is within easy walking distance of Downtown Nassau‚Äôs port and main business quarter. It physically bridges the two districts that are at the core of the nation: bustling Downtown‚Äîthe hub of colonial power and continued wealth through commerce and tourism‚Äîand the ‚ÄòOver-the-Hill‚Äô community‚Äîalso known as the ‚Äònation‚Äôs navel‚Äô‚Äîwhere the Majority Rule leaders were born and raised. Sadly, once a thriving middle class community, the latter is now considerably diminished. The museum boasts four gallery spaces‚Äîthe PE, or permanent exhibition space, on the ground floor, which houses rotating shows drawn on the National Collection; The PS Room, a project space for monthly interventions, also on the ground floor; and two temporary exhibition spaces on the second floor (T1 and T2). The NAGB is partially funded by a governmental subvention but engages a public-private network to operate and is also supported by the community that it serves, in the form of ticket sales, memberships, donations and otherwise. The museum is housed in the Villa Doyle, a mansion built in the 1860s as the home to first Chief Justice in The Bahamas. After the addition of a new wing in the 1920s, it became one of Nassau‚Äôs prized stately homes. Positioned on the rise overlooking the top of West Street, Villa Doyle is typical of great houses of earlier centuries with surrounding verandahs. Left to wrack and ruin in the modern age, many argued for its demolition to obliterate the reminder of our colonial past. Under a campaign lead by historian and founding Chairman, Dr. Gail Saunders, the building was saved as a site where history could be recognized, unpacked and interpreted. The building was subsequently restored in the 1990s to become the NAGB. Villa Doyle‚Äôs restoration took almost seven years to complete involving a team of professionals and consultants under the supervision of architect, Anthony Jervis; Civil Engineer, Mr. George Cox; and the National Art Gallery‚Äôs Committee chaired by Dr. Gail Saunders.

The building is 615 feet (188 meters) tall with 47 floors, and is tied with four other buildings, 750 7th Avenue, the New York Life Building, Tower 49, and The Epic in its position as the 118th tallest building in New York. The building was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.  History  During the mid-1960s, in what the New York Times called \\"one of the most unusual Manhattan real estate transactions in recent years\\", developers of the new skyscraper decided to build around a Third Avenue establishment: P. J. Clarke's bar and restaurant. The property owner at the time refused to sell to the developers. In December 1970, the fifth floor suffered a fire partially destroying part of the floor, injuring 20, and killing three. The building was completed in 1970, and tenant work was still in progress at the time of the fire. Use of the elevators resulted in the three fire deaths when the car inadvertently stopped at the fire floor. Others were almost killed in the same way but were rescued by fire fighters. The City of New York created the most restrictive law of its kind for high-rise buildings. [Local Law # 5 of 1973], more than just steel and concrete as safety measures, adequate fire protection and a process to safely evacuate a high-rise building were introduced as a means to protect property and provide life safety for the occupants. The Local Law # 5 of 1973, called for Fire Safety Directors FAQ NYC Fire Safety Director Course Information and Education to be on duty for each building over 100 feet in height or occupied with more than 100 people above or below the street or more than 500 people in total. The building was occupied principally by carpet manufactures and carpet wholesalers and the fire started in occupancy of the type. The fire was confined for the most part to a specific area by the fire partitions required and the un-pierced horizontal separations. The fire did warp the exterior skin allowing a small amount of fire penetration to the floor above, but for the most part it was contained by the building structure. The fire, though contained, was very intense and did structural damage to the floor systems above. Total property damage to the building and its contents was estimated at $2.5 million. In July 1996, two repairmen almost lost their lives when a gust of wind smashed their scaffold through a window.  Tenants  Notable occupants of 919 Third Avenue include Debevoise & Plimpton, Jenner & Block, Schulte Roth & Zabel, Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomingdale's.

Historian Brian Lavery quotes an entry in the \\"Calendar of State Papers, Domestic\\" series (CSPD; the records of the English, and later, the British, governmental proceedings, dating back to the reign of Henry VIII; also known as the \\"British State Papers\\", and now held by the National Archives) from 9/3/1665 that reports: the King (i.e., Charles II) \\"...is very much pleased with the new frigate built at Portsmouth, the Royal Oak, and has ordered Tippets, the shipwright who built her, to build just such another, and not to mend her in any part, being assured that anything which is not just so cannot be so good...\\" The career of Royal Oak in the Royal Navy was brief, but highly eventful. According to John Charnock's Bibliographia Navalis, Admiral Sir Christopher Myngs was her captain in 1664. The ship fought in most of the major battles of the Second Anglo-Dutch War: Lowestoft, the Four Days' Battle, and the St. James' Day Fight. At the Battle of Lowestoft in 1665, under the command of Vice-Admiral Sir John Lawson, Royal Oak was the flagship of the Van Division of the Duke of York's Red Squadron; Sir John later died of the wounds he received in the battle. After the defeat administered to the Dutch Navy in the 1666 battle on St. James' Day, the English made the mistake of deciding to save money and leave the fleet in ordinary during the ensuing fighting season, a decision ultimately resulting in Royal Oak being burnt by the Dutch during their Raid on the Medway in 1667.

In the Miracleman comic, Miraclewoman is the analog of other feminine super heroines such as Wonder Woman and Mary Marvel. Her given name is Avril Lear, but she also uses the alias of Dr. McCarthy. History She first appears in Miracleman 10. The title page and a later panel shows her red stiletto boots, near the body of Mike Moran, in another dimension called Underspace. There the bodies not currently being used by the Miracleman Family or similar beings are stored. She first appears in her unpowered form, being tracked by two aliens. In issue 11,May 1987 page 5, she is shown watching Mike Moran leaving his home. While he is battling the pair of aliens, who appear to have many available forms tailored for specific purposes, including combat, she enters his home using super speed to move past Liz unnoticed, when Liz opens the door for the doorbell. Her red stiletto boots are depicted in the shadows, which were shown in earlier panels and can also be seen in Issue 10 as well. When, in the height of a losing battle, Miracleman inadvertently thinks of his daughter, Winter, the aliens telepathically find out about the child, whose existence they had not known of previously. One of the aliens leaves for the Moran home, apparently after the child. As death appears imminent for both Liz and Winter, Miraclewoman reveals herself, ambushing the alien from behind and damaging its throat, smartly preventing it from changing form and severely injuring it as well. The aliens subsequently are revealed to be the Qys, and the source of the original alien technology on which the Marvelman characters were based. The alien protocols, which called for the destruction of any of the \\"debased\\" beings, has radically different rules for the situation as a result of the existence of Liz and Miracleman's child, Winter, a \\"natural\\" super being. Issue 12September 1987 tells Miraclewoman's origin story. She was kidnapped as a teenager, much like the other Miracleman Family, and experimented upon in secret by Dr Gargunza. There, unsupervised by the government, his depraved attentions were free to experiment with her, a dog, and a young man named Terrance Rebbeck, who would become Young Nastyman, a Black Adam analog. Like the others of the Miracleman Family she was given the ability to change into a super powered body. Her adventures were nothing more than computer simulations invented by Gargunza. Unlike them, her and Young Nastyman's experiences were more depraved and unsupervised. Her adventures focused on bondage and torture, described in comic as using the sensory input of \\"scented gags and rope burns\\". Rebbeks's simulations were focused on the role of a villain, allowing him to enact depravities, and giving him more control. Young Nastyman eventually went insane and escaped from the lab they were held in. This became the first time the Miracleman family was allowed out, with Gargunza hoping they could catch Young Nastyman in a discreet manner. Miraclewoman is likewise released, with Gargunza's hope of having her and one of the Miracleman Family mate and create a naturally born super child. She locates them using an ability to sense \\"aura traces\\". Separately they search for Young Nastyman. While following Young Nastyman's aura traces she finds the military bunker she was created in, and, when searched, reveals the records of her and Rebbeck's treatment under Gargunza's \\"experiments\\". This includes recordings of Dr Gargunza's sexual abuse of her unconscious body (which she regards with bemusement, not feeling violated in the least). She finally locates Young Nastyman in Iceland, who has gone crazy. Feeling a kinship with him she reveals the truth of their creation and a plan to fake their deaths. Remaining crazed he attacks her and they apparently die while battling in a volcano. This battle and the preceding events would lead to the decision to terminate the Miracleman Family. She uses this to escape notice and took up a new life and trained as a doctor. When she was located by the aliens in Issue 10, she rushed to Miracleman to warn him, having known of his reawakening, and using her ability to track auras to find him. In the following issues Liz leaves Mike due to the stress and horrors plaguing his new life. Avril/Miraclewoman becomes one of his closest allies and in Issue 16 his lover. After successfully rebuilding the world in their image they consummated their feelings. Their lovemaking becomes quite public when they begin mating in the sky and continue a nude chase and sexual encounter, above London's streets, They are both shown surrounded by a white aura (a protective force field discussed earlier in the comic, and referred to as the \\"Tinkerbell Effect\\", but apparently intensified by the sexual activity) and after reaching an apparent orgasm this aura explodes like fireworks in the night sky. They then fall to earth and come to rest at the bottom of a river. Liz later uses Mike's infidelity as one more reason to reject Miracleman and his offer to make her a superwoman. He does not see his relationship with Miraclewoman as wrong, even though he was still married to Liz. He also ponders why she would reject the chance to be like him. Many in-comic references are made to tie Miracleman's allies to the Greek pantheon. Miracleman himself represents Zeus. Their fortress and home is called Olympus, Miraclewoman's origin story in issue 12 is titled Aphrodite, and the firedrake is referred to as Apollo. As Aphrodite she is Miracleman's otherworldly lover. In fact she looks like a feminine Miracleman. Issue 18August 1990 shows her recreating the mythical relationship of Aphrodite and Adonis. She of course in the role of the goddess, and a windmill worker named John Gallaway as the mortal Adonis. Of note is that she is again depicted as being surrounded by a white aura during sex. Her lesson to him is that while she is Miraclewoman she is physically perfect, she then transforms to her Avril Lear form and asks that he love her as she is, as both are her true self. This allows him to break a convention of seeking physical perfection in a lover, and he later reconciles with his ex- wife, in a less than fairy tale ending. In issue #24 a unique plotline is introduced regarding Young Miracleman. Miraclewoman twice states that Young Miracleman is in love with, and sexually attracted to Miracleman. This is stated in both issues 12 and 24. In issue 12 she describes her origin and first meeting with the Miracleman Family and noted Young Miracleman's reaction as immature. In Issue 24, Young Miracleman had been previously resurrected, and, in keeping with her role as Aphtodite, she encourages Miracleman to reach out to him romantically. Convinced by Miraclewoman, he changes his mind stating that he should have seen it as well. His advances are violently rejected, and Young Miracleman flees from him crying. The final panels of the finished comic show the beginnings of a verbal confrontation between Miracleman and Miraclewoman. Due to Eclipse's bankruptcy and the legal battle and confusion surrounding the Miracleman property, we are left without the results of their confrontation. It is also possible that she was correct in assuming Young Miracleman's attraction to Miracleman but he was not psychologically or emotionally mature enough to accept his homosexuality, therefore, he rejected Miracleman's advances in an attempt to belie his true desires. Having been raised during the conservative 50s-60s Britain, Young Miracleman would have likely thought homosexuality immoral and probably refused to accept his feelings and urges and hid them behind a facade of traditional masculinity in emulation of Miracleman.

During the 1980 Purdue game, Lilja's jersey was ripped to the point where he could not go back out and play. When the equipment staff could not locate his backup jersey, they took the jersey of freshman center Doug James, put it on Lilja, and sent him back into the game. After the game, James got calls from friends expressing surprise that the freshman had gotten playing time in a big game. As the 1980 Big Ten Conference Champions, the team played in the 1981 Rose Bowl, which marked the first bowl game victory for head coach Bo Schembechler. It was also Lilja's last game for Michigan, which the Wolverines won 23‚Äì6, over Washington. Teammate Brad Bates later recalled: \\"I was walking off the field with George Lilja, and he said, 'Let's turn around for a Kodak moment,' . . .

Background The first African person in Nova Scotia arrived with the founding of Port Royal in 1605.\\"African Nova ScotianCommunity\\", African Nova Scotian Affairs, Nova Scotia, Canada. African people were then brought as slaves to Nova Scotia during the founding of Louisbourg and Halifax. The first major migration of African people to Nova Scotia happened during the American Revolution. Enslaved Africans in America who escaped to the British during the American Revolutionary War became the first settlement of Black Nova Scotians and Black Canadians. Other Black Loyalists were transported to settlements in several islands in the West Indies and some to London. Recorded in 1783, this 150-page document is the only one to have recorded Black Canadians in a large, detailed scope of work.Nova Scotia Archives & Records Management - African Nova Scotians in the Age of Slavery and Abolition Contents Fraunces Tavern, NYC - Location where Birch assembled the Book of Negroes The document contains records on 3000 Africans; the former slaves recorded in the Book of Negroes were evacuated to British North America, where they were settled in the newly established Birchtown and other places in the colony. According to the Treaty of Paris (1783), the United States argued for the return of all property, including slaves. The British refused to return the slaves, to whom they had promised freedom during the war for joining their cause. The detailed records were created to document the freed people whom the British resettled in Nova Scotia, along with other Loyalists. The book was assembled by Samuel Birch, the namesake of Birchtown, Nova Scotia, under the direction of Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester. Some freedmen later migrated from Nova Scotia to Sierra Leone, where they formed the original settlers of Freetown, under the auspices of the Sierra Leone Company. They are among the ancestors of the Krio ethnic group. Notable people recorded in the Book of Negroes include Boston King, Henry Washington, Moses Wilkinson and Cato Perkins. As the Book of Negroes was recorded separately by American and British officers, there are two versions of the document.

It posits that each time some information is presented to a person, it is neurally encoded in a unique memory trace composed of a combination of its attributes. Further support for this theory came in the 1960s from empirical findings that people could remember specific attributes about an object without remembering the object itself. The mode in which the information is presented and subsequently encoded can be flexibly incorporated into the model. This memory trace is unique from all others resembling it due to differences in some aspects of the item's attributes, and all memory traces incorporated since birth are combined into a multiple-trace representation in the brain. In memory research, a mathematical formulation of this theory can successfully explain empirical phenomena observed in recognition and recall tasks. Attributes The attributes an item possesses form its trace and can fall into many categories. When an item is committed to memory, information from each of these attributional categories is encoded into the item's trace. There may be a kind of semantic categorization at play, whereby an individual trace is incorporated into overarching concepts of an object. For example, when a person sees a pigeon, a trace is added to the \\"pigeon\\" cluster of traces within his or her mind. This new \\"pigeon\\" trace, while distinguishable and divisible from other instances of pigeons that the person may have seen within his or her life, serves to support the more general and overarching concept of a pigeon. Physical Physical attributes of an item encode information about physical properties of a presented item. For a word, this could include color, font, spelling, and size, while for a picture, the equivalent aspects could be shapes and colors of objects. It has been shown experimentally that people who are unable to recall an individual word can sometimes recall the first or last letter or even rhyming words, all aspects encoded in the physical orthography of a word's trace. Even when an item is not presented visually, when encoded, it may have some physical aspects based on a visual representation of the item. Contextual Contextual attributes are a broad class of attributes that define the internal and external features that are simultaneous with presentation of the item. Internal context is a sense of the internal network that a trace evokes. This may range from aspects of an individual's mood to other semantic associations the presentation of the word evokes. On the other hand, external context encodes information about the spatial and temporal aspects as information is being presented. This may reflect time of day or weather, for example. Spatial attributes can refer both to physical environment and imagined environment. The method of loci, a mnemonic strategy incorporating an imagined spatial position, assigns relative spatial positions to different items memorized and then \\"walking through\\" these assigned positions to remember the items. Modal Modality attributes possess information as to the method by which an item was presented. The most frequent types of modalities in an experimental setting are auditory and visual. Any sensory modality may be utilized practically. Classifying These attributes refer to the categorization of items presented. Items that fit into the same categories will have the same class attributes. For example, if the item \\"touchdown\\" were presented, it would evoke the overarching concept of \\"football\\" or perhaps, more generally, \\"sports\\", and it would likely share class attributes with \\"endzone\\" and other elements that fit into the same concept. A single item may fit into different concepts at the time it is presented depending on other attributes of the item, like context. For example, the word \\"star\\" might fall into the class of astronomy after visiting a space museum or a class with words like \\"celebrity\\" or \\"famous\\" after seeing a movie. Mathematical formulation The mathematical formulation of traces allows for a model of memory as an ever- growing matrix that is continuously receiving and incorporating information in the form of a vectors of attributes. Multiple trace theory states that every item ever encoded, from birth to death, will exist in this matrix as multiple traces. This is done by giving every possible attribute some numerical value to classify it as it is encoded, so each encoded memory will have a unique set of numerical attributes. Matrix definition of traces By assigning numerical values to all possible attributes, it is convenient to construct a column vector representation of each encoded item. This vector representation can also be fed into computational models of the brain like neural networks, which take as inputs vectorial \\"memories\\" and simulate their biological encoding through neurons. Formally, one can denote an encoded memory by numerical assignments to all of its possible attributes. If two items are perceived to have the same color or experienced in the same context, the numbers denoting their color and contextual attributes, respectively, will be relatively close. Suppose we encode a total of L attributes anytime we see an object. Then, when a memory is encoded, it can be written as m1 with L total numerical entries in a column vector: ::\\\\mathbf{m_1} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} m_{1}(1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ m_{1}(2) \\\\\\\\\\\\ m_{1}(3) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\m_{1}(L) \\\\end{bmatrix} . A subset of the L attributes will be devoted to contextual attributes, a subset to physical attributes, and so on. One underlying assumption of multiple trace theory is that, when we construct multiple memories, we organize the attributes in the same order. Thus, we can similarly define vectors m2, m3, ..., mn to account for n total encoded memories. Multiple trace theory states that these memories come together in our brain to form a memory matrix from the simple concatenation of the individual memories: ::\\\\mathbf{M} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{m_1} & \\\\mathbf{m_2} & \\\\mathbf{m_3} & \\\\cdots & \\\\mathbf{m_n} \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} m_{1}(1) & m_{2}(1) & m_{3}(1) & \\\\cdots & m_{n}(1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ m_{1}(2) & m_{2}(2) & m_{3}(2) & \\\\cdots & m_{n}(2) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\m_{1}(L) & m_{2}(L) & m_{3}(L) & \\\\cdots & m_{n}(L)\\\\end{bmatrix} . For L total attributes and n total memories, M will have L rows and n columns. Note that, although the n traces are combined into a large memory matrix, each trace is individually accessible as a column in this matrix. In this formulation, the n different memories are made to be more or less independent of each other. However, items presented in some setting together will become tangentially associated by the similarity of their context vectors. If multiple items are made associated with each other and intentionally encoded in that manner, say an item a and an item b, then the memory for these two can be constructed, with each having k attributes as follows: ::\\\\mathbf{m_{ab}} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a(1) \\\\\\\\\\\\a(2) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\a(k) \\\\\\\\\\\\b(1) \\\\\\\\\\\\b(2) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\b(k) \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{a} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b} \\\\end{bmatrix} . Context as a stochastic vector When items are learned one after another, it is tempting to say that they are learned in the same temporal context. However, in reality, there are subtle variations in context. Hence, contextual attributes are often considered to be changing over time as modeled by a stochastic process. Considering a vector of only r total context attributes ti that represents the context of memory mi, the context of the next-encoded memory is given by ti+1: ::\\\\mathbf{t_{i+1}(j)} = \\\\mathbf{t_{i}(j) + \\\\epsilon(j)} so, ::\\\\mathbf{t_{i+1}} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} t_i(1)+\\\\epsilon(1) \\\\\\\\\\\\t_i(2)+\\\\epsilon(2) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ t_i(r)+\\\\epsilon(r) \\\\end{bmatrix} Here, Œµ(j) is a random number sampled from a Gaussian distribution. Summed similarity As explained in the subsequent section, the hallmark of multiple trace theory is an ability to compare some probe item to the pre-existing matrix of encoded memories. This simulates the memory search process, whereby we can determine whether we have ever seen the probe before as in recognition tasks or whether the probe gives rise to another previously encoded memory as in cued recall. First, the probe p is encoded as an attribute vector. Continuing with the preceding example of the memory matrix M, the probe will have L entries: ::\\\\mathbf{p} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} p(1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ p(2) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\p(L) \\\\end{bmatrix}. This p is then compared one by one to all pre-existing memories (trace) in M by determining the Euclidean distance between p and each mi: ::\\\\left \\\\Vert \\\\mathbf{p-m_i} \\\\right \\\\ = \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{j=1}^L (p(j)-m_i(j))^2}. Due to the stochastic nature of context, it is almost never the case in multiple trace theory that a probe item exactly matches an encoded memory. Still, high similarity between p and mi is indicated by a small Euclidean distance. Hence, another operation must be performed on the distance that leads to very low similarity for great distance and very high similarity for small distance. A linear operation does not eliminate low-similarity items harshly enough. Intuitively, an exponential decay model seems most suitable: ::similarity(\\\\mathbf{p,m_i}) = e^{-\\\\tau \\\\left \\\\Vert \\\\mathbf{p-m_i} \\\\right \\\\} where œÑ is a decay parameter that can be experimentally assigned. We can go on to then define similarity to the entire memory matrix by a summed similarity SS(p,M) between the probe p and the memory matrix M: ::\\\\mathbf{SS(p,M)} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n e^{-\\\\tau \\\\left \\\\Vert \\\\mathbf{p-m_i} \\\\right \\\\} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n e^{-\\\\tau \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{j=1}^L (p(j)-m_i(j))^2}}. If the probe item is very similar to even one of the encoded memories, SS receives a large boost. For example, given m1 as a probe item, we will get a near 0 distance (not exactly due to context) for i=1, which will add nearly the maximal boost possible to SS. To differentiate from background similarity (there will always be some low similarity to context or a few attributes for example), SS is often compared to some arbitrary criterion. If it is higher than the criterion, then the probe is considered among those encoded. The criterion can be varied based on the nature of the task and the desire to prevent false alarms. Thus, multiple trace theory predicts that, given some cue, the brain can compare that cue to a criterion to answer questions like \\"has this cue been experienced before?\\" (recognition) or \\"what memory does this cue elicit?\\" (cued recall), which are applications of summed similarity described below. Applications to memory phenomena Recognition Multiple trace theory fits well into the conceptual framework for recognition. Recognition requires an individual to determine whether or not they have seen an item before. For example, facial recognition is determining whether one has seen a face before. When asked this for a successfully encoded item (something that has indeed been seen before), recognition should occur with high probability. In the mathematical framework of this theory, we can model recognition of an individual probe item p by summed similarity with a criterion. We translate the test item into an attribute vector as done for the encoded memories and compared to every trace ever encountered. If summed similarity passes the criterion, we say we have seen the item before. Summed similarity is expected to be very low if the item has never been seen but relatively higher if it has due to the similarity of the probe's attributes to some memory of the memory matrix. ::P(recognizing~p)~=~P(\\\\mathbf{SS(p,M)}>criterion) This can be applied both to individual item recognition and associative recognition for two or more items together. Cued recall The theory can also account for cued recall. Here, some cue is given that is meant to elicit an item out of memory. For example, a factual question like \\"Who was the first President of the United States?\\" is a cue to elicit the answer of \\"George Washington\\". In the \\"ab\\" framework described above, we can take all attributes present in a cue and list consider these the a item in an encoded association as we try to recall the b portion of the mab memory. In this example, attributes like \\"first\\", \\"President\\", and \\"United States\\" will be combined to form the a vector, which will have already been formulated into the mab memory whose b values encode \\"George Washington\\". Given a, there are two popular models for how we can successfully recall b: 1) We can go through and determine similarity (not summed similarity, see above for distinction) to every item in memory for the a attributes, then pick whichever memory has the highest similarity for the a. Whatever b-type attributes we are linked to gives what we recall. The mab memory gives best chance of recall since its a elements will have high similarity to the cue a. Still, since recall does not always occur, we can say that the similarity must pass a criterion for recall to occur at all. This is similar to how the IBM machine Watson operates. Here, the similarity compares only the a-type attributes of a to mab. ::P(recalling~m_{ab})~=~P(similarity(a,m_{ab})>criterion) 2) We can use a probabilistic choice rule to determine probability of recalling an item as proportional to its similarity. This is akin to throwing a dart at a dartboard with bigger areas represented by larger similarities to the cue item. Mathematically speaking, given the cue a, the probability of recalling the desired memory mab is: ::P(recalling~m_{ab})~=~\\\\frac{similarity(a,m_{ab})}{SS(a,M)+error} In computing both similarity and summed similarity, we only consider relations among a-type attributes. We add the error term because without it, the probability of recalling any memory in M will be 1, but there are certainly times when recall does not occur at all. Other common results explained Phenomena in memory associated with repetition, word frequency, recency, forgetting, and contiguity, among others, can be easily explained in the realm of multiple trace theory. Memory is known to improve with repeated exposure to items. For example, hearing a word several times in a list will improve recognition and recall of that word later on. This is because repeated exposure simply adds the memory into the ever-growing memory matrix, so summed similarity for this memory will be larger and thus more likely to pass the criterion. In recognition, very common words are harder to recognize as part of a memorized list, when tested, than rare words. This is known as the word frequency effect and can be explained by multiple trace theory as well. For common words, summed similarity will be relatively high, whether the word was seen in the list or not, because it is likely that the word has been encountered and encoded in the memory matrix several times throughout life. Thus, the brain typically selects a higher criterion in determining whether common words are part of a list, making them harder to successfully select. However, rarer words are typically encountered less throughout life and so their presence in the memory matrix is limited. Hence, low overall summed similarity will lead to a more lax criterion. If the word was present in the list, high context similarity at time of test and other attribute similarity will lead to enough boost in summed similarity to excel past criterion and thus recognize the rare word successfully. Recency in the serial position effect can be explained because more recent memories encoded will share a temporal context most similar to the present context, as the stochastic nature of time will not have had as pronounced an effect. Thus, context similarity will be high for recently encoded items, so overall similarity will be relatively higher for these items as well. The stochastic contextual drift is also thought to account for forgetting because the context in which a memory was encoded is lost over time, so summed similarity for an item only presented in that context will decrease over time. Finally, empirical data have shown a contiguity effect, whereby items that are presented together temporally, even though they may not be encoded as a single memory as in the \\"ab\\" paradigm described above, are more likely to be remembered together. This can be considered a result of low contextual drift between items remembered together, so the contextual similarity between two items presented together is high. Shortcomings One of the biggest shortcomings of multiple trace theory is the requirement of some item with which to compare the memory matrix when determining successful encoding. As mentioned above, this works quite well in recognition and cued recall, but there is a glaring inability to incorporate free recall into the model. Free recall requires an individual to freely remember some list of items. Although the very act of asking to recall may act as a cue that can then elicit cued recall techniques, it is unlikely that the cue is unique enough to reach a summed similarity criterion or to otherwise achieve a high probability of recall. Another major issue lies in translating the model to biological relevance. It is hard to imagine that the brain has unlimited capacity to keep track of such a large matrix of memories and continue expanding it with every item with which it has ever been presented. Furthermore, searching through this matrix is an exhaustive process that would not be relevant on biological time scales.

Dalliance was first performed at the Lyttelton Theatre, London, on 27 May 1986. Plot summary Fritz, who considers himself a man-about-town in 1890s Vienna, is despondent because his affair with a sophisticated, upper- class lady has ended due to the lady's fear her husband might be aware of it. Fritz's friend Theodore tries to cheer Fritz up by introducing him to Christine, a seamstress for the opera. Theodore believes a dalliance with a charming lower-class woman can take a man's mind off his troubles. Almost immediately after the dalliance begins, Fritz receives a challenge from the sophisticated lady's husband. Fritz is not good with a pistol, and the husband has a reputation as an excellent shot, so Fritz knows he has little chance of surviving the duel. In the few remaining days in his life, Fritz and Christine fall in love. Fritz sees the superiority of a simple life of mutual love over the bon vivant life of an urban bachelor. Beyond the addition of Stoppardian wit in the adaptation, Stoppard's major change from the original is to shift the last scene from Christine's apartment to backstage at the opera. A comic opera with a similar plot is taking place on stage when Christine hears the news that Fritz has been killed in a duel.

The colors resemble those seen in soap bubbles and oil on a water surface. It is a type of photometeor. This fairly common phenomenon is most often observed in altocumulus, cirrocumulus, lenticular,Answers.com - Sci-Tech Dictionary:irisation and cirrus clouds. They sometimes appear as bands parallel to the edge of the clouds. Iridescence is also seen in the much rarer polar stratospheric clouds, also called nacreous clouds. The colors are usually pastel, but can be very vivid or mingled together, sometimes similar to mother-of-pearl.PHOTOMETEORS, by Jes√∫s Mart√≠nez-Fr√≠as When appearing near the Sun, the effect can be difficult to spot as it is drowned in the Sun's glare. This may be overcome by shielding the sunlight with one's hand or hiding it behind a tree or building. Other aids are dark glasses, or observing the sky reflected in a convex mirror or in a pool of water. Etymology Irisations are named after the Greek goddess Iris, goddess of rainbows and messenger of Zeus and Hera to the mortals below.The Cloudspotter's Guide By Gavin Pretor-Pinney, Page 233 Mechanism Iridescent clouds are a diffraction phenomenon caused by small water droplets or small ice crystals individually scattering light. Larger ice crystals do not produce iridescence, but can cause halos, a different phenomenon. Irisation is caused by very uniform water droplets diffracting light (within 10 degrees from the Sun) and by first order interference effectsColor and Light in Nature By David K. Lynch, William Charles Livingston, Page 133 (Beyond about 10 degrees from the Sun). It can extend up to 40 degrees from the Sun.PHOTOMETEORS, by Jes√∫s Mart√≠nez-Fr√≠as If parts of clouds contain small water droplets or ice crystals of similar size, their cumulative effect is seen as colors. The cloud must be optically thin, so that most rays encounter only a single droplet. Iridescence is therefore mostly seen at cloud edges or in semi-transparent clouds, while newly forming clouds produce the brightest and most colorful iridescence. When the particles in a thin cloud are very similar in size over a large extent, the iridescence takes on the structured form of a corona, a bright circular disk around the Sun or Moon surrounded by one or more colored rings.

Hermonax was a Greek vase painter working in the red-figure style. He painted between c. 470 and 440 BC in Athens. Ten vases signed with the phrase \\"Hermonax has painted it\\" survive, mainly stamnoi and lekythoi. He is generally a painter of large pots, though some cups survive. Background Forming the beginning of the 'early classic' generation of vase-painters, Hermonax was a pupil of the Berlin Painter and a contemporary of the Providence Painter. Sir John Beazley attributed just over 150 vases to his hand. His work has been found all over the ancient Greek world from Marseille to Southern Russia. Hermonax entered the Berlin Painter's workshop towards its end. As a pupil of the Berlin Painter Hermonax adopted the practice of painting large figural scenes on large vessels. His meander patterns, unlike those of his master, can be careless, as with the Providence Painter. A characteristic of his style is his depiction of the eyes with a concave bottom and a convex top. The largest share of Hermonax' surviving work depicts Dionysiac themes. Appraisal As Beazley states, \\"Sound and able as Hermonax's work generally is, he only once shows himself a remarkable artist, and that is not on any of his signed vases, but on the Munich stamnos...with the Birth of Erichthonios - Hauser has pointed out what was modern in that vase when it was painted; how the painter rejects the old-fashioned agreements of figure, face, and dress, and turns to a new kind of simplicity and truthfulness: new in his day, and fresh still, because the artist put his own thought, his own feeling into his shapes, and that keeps them alive and green.\\" As the 'brother' of the Providence Painter, he is seen as less technically proficient.

He is the bassist and cellist for the pop rock band OneRepublic. Much like OneRepublic's lead vocalist, Ryan Tedder, Brent has also written and performed with various other musicians from both underground music scenes and mainstream acts, including Beyonc√©, Matchbox Twenty, Ellie Goulding, Cobra Starship, Leona Lewis, Kelly Clarkson, √≠sland, Vermeer, Augustine, This Allure, Monarch, Venus Infers, Jessica Dobson, and Kevin Max. Brent has been married to Jackie Leslie since 2017 Biography Early life He attended Ethan B. Allen Elementary and when Kutzle was thirteen, he attended Sarah McGarvin School located in Westminster, California. He also attended La Quinta High School in Westminster, California Baptist University in Riverside and Vanguard University in Costa Mesa. Kutzle began playing piano at an early age with his mother a church organist and piano teacher, and his father a pianist and one of 84 pianists in the Los Angeles 1984 Summer Olympics opening ceremonies. Kutzle was encouraged by his father to take on a second instrument, the cello, because the competition is far less than that of violin. Kutzle is a classically trained composer. Filmography Kutzle has a cameo appearance in the 2008 film, The Eye, starring Jessica Alba. He appears in the opening scene playing cello as a member of the orchestra. He can also be heard playing cello on the title track, \\"Songs Like Rain\\" for the 2006 independent film of the same name. In 2014, Kutzle was asked by the Jamaican diaspora about how many instruments he could play regarding film and he stated, ‚ÄúNot as many as I could in college, but somewhere around a handful.‚Äù http://www.jamaicadiaspora.org/entertainment/he-no-faking-jamaican-fraser- kershaw/ Kutzle scored a soundtrack for the 2016 international feature film Behind the Water which stars activist Fraser Kershaw. OneRepublic Kutzle joined OneRepublic early in 2007 after the band's former bassist left to pursue a solo career. He has played the cello since fourth grade and has commented that he would never play for a band that 'would not let him play his cello'. Kutzle has transformed the sound of the cello for a rock band by using delay, reverb and looping effects. He made his mark on OneRepublic's debut album Dreaming Out Loud on the track \\"All Fall Down\\", which is based on a cello hook that is repeated throughout the whole track. In addition to playing the cello and the bass guitar, Kutzle, along with Zach Filkins, also aids frontman, Ryan Tedder in songwriting and composing music for the band. Many of the songs on the band's second album Waking Up were co-written and co-produced by Kutzle, including the lead single \\"All The Right Moves\\" and the single, \\"Good Life\\" as well as \\"Feel Again\\" and \\"If I Lose Myself\\" which are both singles from their third album Native. At live concerts, he can be seen playing bass guitar, cello, and singing background vocals along with other band members Zach Filkins, Eddie Fisher , and Drew Brown.

Seymour played for the New Zealand national netball team, the Silver Ferns, in 92 test matches spanning 16 years. During her international career she has competed at three Netball World Championships and two Commonwealth Games. She also captained the Silver Ferns in 2002 and again during the last two years of her international career. After two years in the ANZ Championship, Seymour announced her retirement from competitive netball in 2009. She subsequently took on a coaching role at the Canterbury Tactix as assistant coach. Early career Seymour, a physical education teacher at Heretaunga College in Upper Hutt made her debut for the Silver Ferns in 1994. She was again selected for the Silver Ferns the following year to compete at the 1995 Netball World Championships in Manchester, where New Zealand finished a disappointing third place. She missed selection for the Silver Ferns in 1997 and made a return to athletics that year, finishing second in the 800 m at the national track and field championships in 1998. That year also saw the introduction of netball to the Commonwealth Games, and the start of a new domestic netball league in New Zealand. Seymour signed with the Canterbury Flames for the inaugural Coca-Cola Cup (later the National Bank Cup), and was also selected for the Silver Ferns team that won silver at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur. In 1999, she transferred to the Capital Shakers for the Coca-Cola Cup, and joined the Silver Ferns again for the 1999 Netball World Championships in Christchurch. While her World Championships campaign finished with a silver medal, Seymour was named as the official player of the tournament. Silver Ferns captain Seymour returned to the Flames for the 2000 Coca-Cola Cup as captain. In 2002, she was elevated to Silver Ferns captain, after incumbent skipper Bernice Mene retired. That year, Seymour led New Zealand to their second Commonwealth Games netball silver in Manchester. But just ten months into her captaincy she withdrew from the national team after becoming pregnant with her second child. Seymour continued to play domestic netball with the Canterbury Flames until she announced her retirement following the 2004 season. However, she once again returned to the Flames in 2006 after the birth of her third child. She missed out on the 2006 Commonwealth Games team that won gold in Melbourne, but earned a callup to the Silver Ferns later that year following an injury to Casey Williams. Seymour was picked the following year for the 2007 Netball World Championships in Auckland, in which the Silver Ferns finished second. ANZ Championship The Canterbury Flames played their last match of the National Bank Cup in 2007, after which the competition was retired and replaced with a new trans-Tasman league, the ANZ Championship. The Canterbury Flames were one of five New Zealand teams in the new league, and were renamed the Canterbury Tactix. Seymour stayed with the Canterbury franchise and was named captain for the inaugural season in 2008. She also resumed her role as Silver Ferns captain later that year. During Seymour's two years in the ANZ Championship, the Tactix finished in 8th and 6th place, respectively. At the end of the 2009 season, Seymour announced her retirement from all levels of competitive netball, pending the birth of her fourth child. After her retirement, Seymour accepted a position as assistant coach for the Tactix from 2010, under head coach Helen Mahon-Stroud. Personal life Julie Seymour is married to former All Black and long-time New Zealand rugby sevens representative player Dallas Seymour. Dallas and Julie have four children, with all four pregnancies occurring during Julie Seymour's long elite netball career. In the 2003 Queen's Birthday Honours, Seymour was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to netball.

The novel takes its title from two (otherwise unconnected) songs of the same title by Roky Erickson and The Vulgar Boatmen. The original title was Monster Eyes, but Lethem was convinced to change it by his publisher. He later admitted to an interviewer that the association with the two songs \\"made it feel very lucky to me to put it on the book,\\" and that even though the new title \\"isn‚Äôt my phrase, for a book about appropriated language and the way things can be repurposed, it seemed okay. And, it‚Äôs a beautifully passive-aggressive title.\\" Plot summary Lucinda Hoekke is an underemployed woman in her late twenties, playing bass in a fledgling Los Angeles rock group. There are three other members: Matthew, the group's lead singer and Lucinda's ex-boyfriend, who kidnaps a kangaroo from the local zoo to save it from boredom; Denise, the clear-headed drummer, works at \\"No Shame,\\" a sex shop; and Bedwin, the group's composer and lead guitarist, who is very fragile and suffers from writer's block. Bedwin watches the same Fritz Lang movie repeatedly. Lucinda takes a job at a performance art project called, \\"Complaint Line,\\" listening to anonymous callers talk about their grievances. She falls for a regular caller, initially known only as the \\"Complainer,\\" who amuses her with his acerbic reflections about life and self- deprecating humor. She begins using his musings as song lyrics, inspiring her band to new heights of creativity. She becomes obsessed with the complainer, whose name is Carl, and begins an unstable all-consuming love affair with him. The band's unexpectedly successful performance at a loft party leads to an invitation to appear live on Los Angeles' leading alternative music radio program. However, Carl, who uses his lyrics to force his way into the band, disrupts their radio broadcast, leading to romantic and musical consequences. Reception and analysis You Don't Love Me Yet received mixed reviews. In his promotional appearance at Google, Lethem attributed this reaction to the novel's intentionally silly and light tone. He claimed that the novel was supposed to follow the form of a romantic comedy and was his most \\"funny\\" and \\"sexy\\" book. He argued that the novel's central theme was the mystery of artistic influence, borrowing and collaboration, the individual artist's murky relationship to the world around him. He thought that this theme could best be explored in the context of a rock band, since band members are often much greater artists collectively than they are as individuals in a way that is difficult to explain clearly. He also noted that musicians often borrow banal pieces of popular culture and give them new and exciting meanings.

Biography Paco Betancourt owned and operated the Rio Grande Music Co. in San Benito, Texas, which also housed the Ideal Records recording studio. The Rio Grande Music Co. was primarily a coin-operated vending company that owned and serviced jukeboxes and pinball machines. In the 1920s, Paco Betancourt owned and operated the Queen Theatre in Brownsville, Texas, which was the first theatre in the Rio Grande Valley to show talking movies. By the late 1940s and early 1950s, local music of the day--the early Tejano and conjunto music of South Texas--had become a popular genre and good business for record producers and jukebox operators. The local nightclubs, ballrooms, and bars clamored to capitalize on the popularity of the music as well as the singers, musicians, and orchestras of the day. Paco Betancourt's Rio Grande Music Co. opened a studio where many of the recordings of the day were recorded and distributed to the local jukeboxes. Some of the engineering chores were by a gifted young local singer and musician recording for the label named Baldemar Huerta, who would soon be known to the music world as Freddy Fender. Throughout his career of 50 years, Freddy--or Balde, as he was known locally--was always public about his humble beginnings and his early history in the small South Texas town of San Benito. Mr. Betancourt later entered politics and was elected mayor of San Benito, Texas. He died on September 5, 1971. Paco is considered to be a pioneer in the history of South Texas recorded music.

In New York, a reference marker is a small green sign mounted approximately every one-tenth mile on highways maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. This was initiated in response to the Highway Safety Act of 1966 enacted by Congress, in an effort to monitor traffic and identify high- accident locations. New York's system inventories and indexes all touring and reference routes, in addition to service and rest areas, ramps, and reservation roads. New York's system is similar to California's postmile system in maintaining the state's highways and route logs. The New York State Thruway Authority adopted its own reference system for the New York State Thruway system, including I-287. There is a similar reference marker system in use in neighboring Vermont. Description NY 17 (the small square sign next to the sign which warns motorists of New York's ban on cell-phones while driving). The reference markers (popularly referred to as \\"little green signs\\", or \\"tenth-mile markers\\") are green signs that measure wide by high and are placed every on state roads, freeways, and parkways. There are three rows of white numbers. Top row The top row indicates the route number. The letter \\"I\\" is used as a suffix for an Interstate highway, but may instead be a prefix on some markers. If a route is re-numbered, it will retain its old route marker (such as the Watervliet segment of NY 2, which was formerly NY 7 until the mid-1980s). If a route number does not use all four digit spaces, there will be blank areas. When two or more routes run concurrently or overlap, typically only the lower number highway will be present, while in some cases, a higher level highway's number appears instead, such as \\"88I\\" appearing on markers where NY 28 overlaps Interstate 88 near Oneonta. Center row The first digit of the second row indicates the NYSDOT Region (1 through 11, with Region 10 (Long Island) marked by a \\"0\\" and Region 11 (New York City) marked with an \\"X\\"). Within each of the regions, the counties are listed alphabetically and represented by the second digit. Thus, markers in Oswego County bear the designation of \\"34\\" (Region 3, County 4 within said region). Dutchess (left) and Putnam, on NY 9D), making the meaning of the numbers on the marker cleareralt=Two nearly adjacent markers, one slightly defaced with red ink, with slightly different sets of numbers Outside of New York City, the third and fourth digits of the second row indicate the number of counties the route has entered, starting at \\"01.\\" Each county line crossing, no matter how short nor if re-entered, is counted. For example, the irregular boundaries of the counties of Oneida, Herkimer, and Otsego, and the routing of US 20 through where the three counties meet, cause it to have four county crossings between Bridgewater and West Winfield, over a stretch of only . This includes its first entry into Herkimer Country for roughly . US 20 enters Herkimer and Otsego counties three times each before entering Schoharie County, which is number 18 in a sequence of 22 counties the route enters. The direction of inventory is either south-to-north, or west-to-east, as appropriate. Within New York City, a different legend is applied for the third digit. The letter \\"M\\" for Mainline or \\"C\\" for Collector/Distributor road is used, while the letter \\"R\\" appears for some ramps. Bottom row The first digit of the bottom row is the control segment, which starts at 1 at the county line or route's terminus. Control segments usually increment at each crossing of a city line, returning to 1 at the next county line. If a city has a high- and low-tax boundary, or otherwise annexes additional land, the control segments will in practice increment at the high tax (inner) boundary, or at the former boundary, rather than be re-numbered by NYSDOT if city boundaries change. If there are more than nine control segments in a county (such as on the Hutchinson River Parkway in Westchester County), the county counter will increment by one and the control segments reset to one. However, an entire county may be a single control segment; NY 10 enters no cities and all control segments are numbered \\"1,\\" despite its length. In New York City, however, the first digit of the bottom row indicates the direction of travel, since county lines are crossed yet the route is still in the same city. North, South, East and West are represented respectively by 1, 2, 3, and 4. The last three digits of the bottom row represent approximate distance in tenths of a mile from the beginning of the last control segment or county line. Marker placement Markers are placed on flanged posts at approximate one-tenth mile intervals with a tolerance of ¬±0.01 mile. On two-lane roads, they are usually placed in alternate directions of travel. On four-lane roads, they are placed in both directions. If an intersection, impermeable material, or other obstruction exists, a marker may be placed nearby but in violation of the above tolerance, on the opposite side of the road on which it would otherwise be placed, or missing altogether. A missing marker is yet accounted for in the overall sequence. A marker may also be placed on a nearby post that holds other warning or informational signs, or mounted on a bridge railing, guard rail, or other structure. Under the Latham traffic circle, markers for US 9 are mounted to the retaining wall. A marker may be lost or disfigured due to a vehicle accident, maintenance/construction, snowplowing, or vandalism/theft. Markers are not present on roads not maintained by NYSDOT, which include city streets marked as a touring route, or bridges and ramps maintained by the New York State Bridge Authority or other agency. Other circumstances NY 23 matching a sample marker used on many New York commercial maps illustrating their presence Special situations call for the use of different legends in the digits of a marker. One-way couplets When a route is split onto two city streets, each one-way for the specific direction of travel, the northbound or eastbound markers are unchanged. Southbound or westbound, however, the letter \\"V\\" is inserted for the second digit of the third row. The markers are numbered in reverse sequence, so that the numbers match at the southern or western point of split and may be longer or shorter if a different distance is needed for the other direction. For example, both NY 5 and NY 30 in Amsterdam are split: NY 5 is on Main Street westbound and the Amsterdam Arterial, eastbound; NY 30 is on Market Street southbound and Church Street, northbound. Both the southbound and westbound segments of both routes, maintained by NYSDOT, carry the \\"V\\" designation. Interchange ramps When markers are placed on access ramps, if the ramp carries a route, then that ramp's markers are part of the overall sequence. For ramps between two highways, the markers indicate the highway just departed (or the highway about to be entered, if the departed highway is not numbered). On the second row, instead of a county order, an exit order from \\"01\\" is present. This sequence is taken from the exit number of the higher level route (Interstate, over US Highway, over State Highway), and if the same level, the route with the lower number, from south to north or west to east. All markers for the same interchange will use the same sequencing number. If the ramp is for a service area, the sequencing number will use the format of \\"A1\\" through \\"Z9\\", but the letters \\"O\\" and \\"R\\" are not used. On the third row, the first digit is a DOT Residency (further division of a Region). The second is the letter \\"A\\" through \\"M\\", ordered counterclockwise starting with the higher level route's ramp oriented west‚Äìeast or south‚Äìnorth, and is subject to interpretation. The last two digits are sequencing numbers, similar to the distance on a regular marker. Service roads On Service roads, the first row is the same as the mainline route with which the service road is associated, and uses the same second row. The third row begins with the aforementioned DOT Residency, followed by the letters N through Z, sequenced through the same county. The last two digits are the same sequencing number; if they exceed , then the preceding letter will be incremented. Rest areas Rest areas are used the same as ramps, but the county sequence will be replaced by the combination \\"R1\\" through \\"R9\\". Institutional roads (including Indian reservations) A special route number is given to these roads, beginning with \\"9\\", then the digit for the region number (\\"0\\" in New York City), the number \\"1\\", then a letter. Reservation routes will begin the same way, with the third digit being any other than zero, and ending with the letter \\"R\\". The second row will have the same county designation, with the third and fourth digits being a sequence the same as a service road. The third row will begin with: 1, Reservations or Department of Health; 2, Military and Naval Affairs; 3, Education; 4, State Police; 5, Executive-Youth; 6, Conservation; 7, Corrections; 8, Social Services; 9, Mental Hygiene; O, Other. Realignments If a new routing of a highway is constructed that is significantly different from the existing route, the legend will be varied to avoid duplication. If a new county is entered, the next available county order number will be used. For example, NY 3 originally began at NY 104 in Hannibal in Oswego County. Ending in Plattsburgh, the county order ended with 08. Later, NY 3 was extended to the west at NY 104A. With this extension entering Cayuga County, that segment used the county sequence of 09, even though it was to the west of Oswego County's 01. If a realignment would require the use of new sequencing numbers, the first sequencing number (second digit) is increased by one, and the last two digits either start at 00 or at one higher than the end of the existing routing. Examples include the bypass of NY 43 in Rensselaer County, replacing existing routing in and around Rensselaer; the construction of \\"Alternate 7\\" (NY 7 between I-87 and I-787 in Albany County), and the aforementioned NY 3 between the Cayuga County line and its former terminus at NY 104. In the event that the second digit in the third row increments beyond 9, the control segment number will be incremented by one. The control segment will also increment for a discontinuous route in the same county, such as NY 24 in Suffolk County, as well for any crossings of the state line, such as NY 17 (future I-86) when the highway was re-routed around Waverly and into Pennsylvania (see photo above). History NY 51 in Otsego County between Morris and New Lisbon Originally, reference markers were on square signs and the numbers were not reflective. The second and third rows had much smaller digits. In many areas of the state, older markers are still present or are used in combination with newer, reflective ones. In an oddity, the former NY 57 still retains many of its reference markers (in the old style) well after its decommissioning in 1980. This is also the case for former NY 380 in Chautauqua County.

The Polovtsy raid of 1068‚Äì1069 was only the tribe's second major raid into Rus‚Äô (they had negotiated a treaty with Prince Vsevolod Yaroslavich of Pereislavl‚Äô (the father of Vladimir Monomach) in 1055, but the tribesmen broke the treaty and attacked Kievan Rus‚Äô six years later, defeating Vsevolod in battle). In 1068-1069, the Polovtsy penetrated the earthwork defensive lines built up over the years by Prince Vladimir Svyatoslavich (r. ca. 980‚Äì1015) and his son, Yaroslav the Wise (r. 1019‚Äì1054). They were met by a combined army of Yaroslav‚Äôs sons: Grand Prince Iziaslav of Kiev and his brothers, Princes Sviatoslav Yaroslavich of Chernigov, and Vsevolod, which was defeated and fled back to Kiev in disarray.Janet Martin, Medieval Russia 980-1584 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 45 The Polovsty continued to raid throughout the area, prompting the Kievans to call on the grand prince to rearm them so they could march out and meet the threat. Iziaslav refused, prompting the rebellion. The Tale of Bygone Years (in Russian Povest Vremennikh Let), a part of The Lavrentian Chronicle, relates what happened next: > The Kievans who had escaped to their native city held a veche (literally > \\"created a veche\\") on the marketplace and sent the following communication > to the Prince [Iziaslav]: 'The Polovtsy have spread over the country. O > Prince, give us arms and horses, that we may offer them combat once more.' > Iziaslav, however, paid no heed to this request. Then the people began to > murmur against his general (voevoda) Konstantin. From the place of the > assembly, they mounted the hill and arrived before the house of > Konstantin.Lavrentevskaia Letopis (Povest Vremennikh Let), in Polnoe > Sobranie Russkikh Letopisei, Vol. 1, cols. 170-1; see also Boris D. Grekov, > Kiev Rus, trans. by Y. Sdobnikov (Moscow, Foreign Language Publishing House. > 1959), 656-7; Martin, Medieval Russia, 35, 49; Mikhail Tikhomirov, The Towns > of Ancient Rus, trans. by Y. Sdobnikov (Moscow, Foreign Language Publishing > House. 1959), 198-199. The Kievan mob ransacked Konstantin's house, apparently blaming him for the defeat. They then drove out Iziaslav and freed Prince Vseslav of Polotsk, who had been imprisoned earlier by Iziaslav, Vsevolod, and Sviatoslav, and placed him on the Kievan throne in hopes that he could stop the Polovtsy. Iziaslav, for his part, fled to Boleslaw II of Poland, who supported him with arms with which he returned to Kiev the following May (1069) and took back the throne. In Iziaslav's absence, Prince Sviatoslav managed to defeat a much larger Polovetsian army on November 1, 1068 and stem the tide of Polovetsian raids. A small skirmish in 1071 was the only disturbance by the Polovtsy for the next two decades.Martin, Medieval Russia, 49. Thus, while the Battle of Alta River was a disgrace for Kievan Rus' and led briefly to the ouster of the grand prince, Sviatoslav's victory the following year relieved the Polovtsy threat to Kiev and Chernigov for a considerable period and allowed Iziaslav the breathing space necessary to reclaim the throne. The uprising has been seen by a number of Russian and Soviet historians as proof of the power of the veche, which was rather more important in the northwestern Rus' cities of Novgorod the Great and Pskov (and at a later period) and less important in the south, but showed itself to be important here in displacing a Kievan grand prince and bringing in another one. The veche, usually seen as a public assembly and often quite institutionalized in the literature, would, however, appear in this instance to be little more than an angry mob which sacked the voevoda's house and drove out the prince. It does not appear to be anything like a parliament or legislature as it has often been portrayed in the traditional historiography.

In 2002, it became the first pediatric facility in Uganda to provide free anti-retroviral drugs to children. Today, more than 3,000 children have received care and treatment through Aidchild's inpatient and outpatient services, including a laboratory, two clinics, homes and academies in Masaka and Mpigi, Uganda. Aidchild is supported by a mix of government and private donors and income- generating activities. History Aidchild was founded by Nathaniel Dunigan. Dunigan first visited Uganda when he was Deputy Director of the Office of the Governor in Tucson, Arizona. A one-month assignment as a volunteer HIV- prevention educator had taken him to Africa where he met many children who were suffering and dying. On his return to the US, he resolved to make a difference, and completed a feasibility study for his Aidchild concept. At the age of 26, he resigned from his job, sold his car and belongings, and moved to Uganda. He had an initial budget of just $3,500. Two years later, Aidchild was chosen by the Ugandan and American governments as a model of pediatric HIV/AIDS care for the entire continent of Africa. A second center was created just after that, as was a treatment laboratory that has served the needs of more than 3,000 children and adults living with AIDS. Social entrepreneurship Aidchild operates the Equation Gallery, an art gallery and caf√© on the Equator line in Uganda; Ten Tables, a restaurant and screening room in Masaka, and Aidchild's Terrace Club, a rooftop barbecue venue and boutique hostel.

The company incorporated in 1972, with the first franchise following in 1973. In the 1980s and 1990s, Noble Roman's expanded heavily outside of Indiana, opening new locations in Ohio, and other states; and issuing a IPO in 1982. In 1996, Noble Roman's attempted to purchase Papa Gino's, which was in the process of acquiring D'Angelo's Grilled Sandwiches chain from PepsiCo's Pizza Hut division (Noble Roman's notable competitor). But in the next year, the deal fell through, and eventually it was delisted from NASDAQ after it fell to a $1 per share. During the 2000s and 2010s, the company became embroiled in multiple lawsuits with its franchisees. Franchisees have described the company as \\"distinguished...by its high franchisee failure rates, and its insistence on suing franchise owners once they fail.\\" Other franchisees allege that the company \\"has used litigation as a revenue source,\\" and as of 2009, was \\"involved with litigation with every one of their franchisees.\\" During the 2010s, Noble Roman's started to move away from selling pizzas in the traditional sit down and delivery restaurants to focus in selling reheat-and- serve products in supermarkets, and later, hot products for eating inside supermarket cafes such as at Marsh Supermarkets.

It was established in Battersea in 1875 by the Sir Walter St John Trust and moved to larger premises in Streatham in 1936. The school closed when it was amalgamated with Rosa Bassett School, a grammar school for girls, in 1977 to create the new Furzedown Secondary School, a mixed comprehensive school in Tooting. History  Beginnings Although the school was only formally established in 1875 it shares its early history with that of the Sir Walter St John's School in Battersea. The joint history dates back to the late 1660s, when Sir Walter St John, 3rd Baronet founded a school on his estate at Battersea. Sir Walter assured the future of his school by means of an endowment signed on the 7 September 1700, stating in the Trust Deed that \\"being minded to found and forever to establish a charity in the said Parish of Battersea, wherein he now dwelleth for the benefit of the said Parish and Towne, Battersea, and to erect and endow a school for the Education of 20 Free Scholars, he gave a house and garden to be forever hereafter used as a school house for the teaching of scholars therein.\\" The scholars were \\"to be elected and putt into the said schoole in a mannere hereinafter mentioned to read write and to cast accounts.\\" The establishment of Battersea Grammar as a separate school was prompted by the changes resulting from the Elementary Education Act 1870. There was considerable debate as to how best to proceed, but eventually a proposal for a new trust scheme, under the Endowed Schools Act 1869, was put before Parliament and approved at a meeting of the Privy Council on the 9 August 1873. The new scheme would create a new Upper School, with the existing site housing a Public Elementary School and a new Middle School if the Governors so decided. A building for the new school was purchased in 1874, and the post of headmaster of the Sir Walter St John's Upper School advertised. The Rev. Edmund A. Richardson, was appointed to the post on 19 January 1875 and the school opened on 12 April 1875. The old school continued to be known as the Sir Walter St John's School, with both schools under the control of the Sir Walter St John's Schools Trust. The name Battersea Grammar School was not formally recorded in the scheme of the trust until 1893, however the school had been known by that name almost from the beginning. Development and relocation The first few years of the new Battersea Grammar School were not promising, with the number of pupils declining and proposals to close the school. The appointment of William H. Bindley as headmaster in 1880 or 1881 (sources disagree) turned matters around in both the quality of education and pupil numbers, which increased from 48 in 1881 to 160 by 1891. The original school building purchased to house Battersea Grammar School was known as St John's Lodge and stood on St John's Hill, on the corner of Plough Road, Battersea. This was enlarged by the addition of an East Wing in 1906 as the number of pupils rose to 250, and pupil numbers increased still further, reaching 450 by 1919. The St John's Hill site had become increasingly constrained, as land had been purchased from the school by the London and South Western Railway as it expanded around Clapham Junction railway station. Although there had been earlier proposals to move, a decision was not made until 1935, when the LCC offered a site on Abbotswood Road in Streatham. Plans for a new building to accommodate 540 pupils, designed by J. E. K. Harrison, FRIBA, a former pupil of the school, were quickly approved and in September 1936 the school moved to its new location. War years The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 prompted the evacuation of the school from Abbotswood Road. The school initially moved to Worthing, where it was accommodated by Worthing Grammar School. The worsening outlook in 1940 resulted in another move in the middle of that year, this time to Hertford, where it shared the buildings of Hertford Grammar School. The school remained in Hertford until early 1945, when it moved back to Abbotswood Road. The return to Streatham also saw the retirement of Henry Ellis, who had taken over as headmaster from William Bindley in 1918, and he was succeeded by Walter Langford. The war years also saw a significant change in the governance of the school in response to the Education Act 1944. Up until that time the school had been an aided school under the control of the Sir Walter St John's Schools Trust, but the new Act led to the school becoming Voluntary-Controlled, which gave the Local Education Authority (then the LCC, later the ILEA) ten seats on the school's Governing Body, while the Trust retained only five representatives. Amalgamation and closure With the abolition of the Tripartite System, the Inner London Education Authority took the decision to move to a fully Comprehensive System of education. In the case of Battersea Grammar School this was achieved in 1977 by an amalgamation with the Rosa Bassett School, a grammar school for girls, and a move to a new site to create Furzedown Secondary School. The majority of the teaching staff transferred to the new comprehensive school. Following the amalgamation with the Rosa Bassett School, the Abbotswood Road site was no longer used by the new school, except that the playing fields there continued to be used by Furzedown Secondary School. Then, from 1977 until its dissolution in 1991, the South West London College of Further Education occupied the site. Since 1994 the Abbotswood Road site has been the home of the Senior Department (sixth form) of the Streatham and Clapham High School. Headmasters * 1875‚Äìc. 1878: Rev. Edmund A.

Bindley took over as headmaster; it was either 1880 or 1881. He had been a master at the school since its establishment in 1875. House system A system of four houses was established in 1907. The houses were: * St John's ‚Äì named after the founder of the original school, Sir Walter St John. * Bolingbroke ‚Äì named after Sir Walter's grandson Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke. * Spencer ‚Äì after the later lords of the manor of Battersea, the manor having been bought from the last St John in 1763 by John, Viscount Spencer. * Trinity ‚Äì named after a church in the district. In 1919 two additional houses were created: * Erskine ‚Äì after Canon John Erskine Clarke, a former Vicar of Battersea and member of the Sir Walter St John Trust at the time of the establishment of the school. * Dawnay ‚Äì after Sir Archibald Davis Dawnay, Mayor of Wandsworth from 1908 until his death on 23 April 1919 and a benefactor of the school. House colours were: *St John's ‚Äì dark blue; *Bolingbroke ‚Äì yellow; *Spencer ‚Äì green; *Trinity ‚Äì red; *Erskine ‚Äì pale blue; *Dawnay ‚Äì purple. Insignia and motto Both Battersea Grammar and the Sir Walter St John's School used the arms of their founder Sir Walter St John, 3rd Baronet, although in slightly modified forms. The motto Rather Deathe than False of Faythe appears to have been a later addition. Graveney School (which was formed from several schools, including Battersea Grammar) still has the motto above the War memorial. For its blazer badge the school took the gold falcon from the crest of Sir Walter's arms. The crest was changed in 1959 from a gold falcon rising, wings displayed and inverted, to one rising with wings elevated and addorsed. The falcon is ducally gorged with a red, three-pointed crown around its neck, and belled in gold with red jesses.

He is the son of Tanja von Anstetten and Ansgar von Lahnstein. The character was played by child actors Daniel and Simon K√ºhn from 20 March 2006 to 24 November 2008. Hannes was recast with child actor Jonas Enderer, who debuted in the role on 28 November 2008. He was last seen in June 2011 and then recast with Melvin-Maxmilian Eisenstein, who debuted on 21 December 2011. Character's background In early 2006, Tanja returns with her son, Hannes, and wants to start a family together with Ansgar. But he has other plans. At first, he did not accept his son and wants have nothing to do with him or Tanja. But the interest that Hannes is the first child of a new Lahnstein generation makes Ansgar believe, that his son could be used to bring him and his father Johannes closer and that that would him bring back into the family business. After a while, Ansgar really loves Hannes as his son and fights with Tanja over custody. Tanja, as always, doesn't want it to be fate and as her sister Meike Breuer comes to town, she wants her as a nanny for Hannes. But Meike falls in love with Ansgar. He finds out, that Meike is Tanja's sister and uses her to get custody. Later, Ansgar marries Nathalie K√§ppler and she is the new mom for Hannes. But Tanja wouldn't let her and kidnaps her son and makes Nathalie and Ansgar believe, that Nathalie had caused Hannes' death. After Tanja fakes her own death too, she leaves D√ºsseldorf with the help of Adrian Degenhardt. They return in December 2007, when Hannes was kidnapped to bring him back to his father Ansgar. Tanja soon discovers that Adrian was behind that, after Sebastian von Lahnstein, Ansgar's cousin, found out the child was still alive. Tanja only wants to come back to take Hannes again from his father, but her plan doesn't work and instead she soon has problems with the police responsible for kidnapping her own son and faking her death. But Tanja manages to blackmail Ansgar with one of his own intrigues and doesn't need go to prison after he predicates that Tanja had no other choice. Then Ansgar and Tanja fight for custody of Hannes again. But none of them wins, when Carla, Ansgar's sister, becomes the child's legal guardian thanks to Lydia Brandner, who's working for the Children's and Young People's Affairs. He grows up with his cousin Sophia now. Tanja tries to win her son back by trying to bring Ansgar to marry her, so they can win back custody of their son together and can enjoy the millions of the Lahnstein assets, because of a faked last will of Johannes, Hannes is the heir. There is only one problem left for Tanja: Ansgar's has fallen in love with his wife Nathalie. Tanja gets Nathalie behind bars with a scheme and she and Ansgar were married in August 2008. Shortly after, Tanja and Ansgar win the custody back as planned. But Ansgar opens up to Carla about the fake will to protect the family assets from Tanja. He also makes it clear that he still loves Nathalie and has an open affair with her. Right before the wedding, a surprise guest arrives, when Annegret Wittkamp, Tanja's mother, shows up to make peace with her daughter and to learn more about her grandson. Tanja doesn't want to forgive her and tries to get rid of her several times. After she spoke out about the dark truth over Tanja's past, Annegret realizes that Tanja never can forgive her and wants to leave town. After a harsh conversation, Annegret decides to end her life and commits suicide by jumping into the Rhine. After that, Tanja is haunted by her and learns that she wants to give Hannes a real family. That's why she tries to be a good wife to Ansgar and wants to win him back onto her side. After three years, Hannes has his christening in November 2008. Nathalie is planned to be his godmother, but Tanja drugged her and makes it look like she is drinking again. In the end, Carla becomes his godmother. Tanja tries to convince Ansgar to extend their family and team up with her again, but their relationship is too unstable to make anything like that happen. Meanwhile Hannes forms a natural bound with Maria di Balbi, who turns out to be his grandmother after posing as the late Francesca von Lahnstein. Ansgar and Tanya's marriage finally fails, when Ansgar starts up an affair with Lydia, who in the meantime has become the wife of Sebastian. When Lydia turns out to be pregnant, Ansgar makes plans for his newfound love and his two children, which include getting rid of Tanja's interference once and for all. Tanja plans on protecting her son's interest in the Lahnstein fortune and even makes an attempt on the life of Lydia's unborn child. She then discovers that the paternity is in question as Lydia's soon-to-be ex-husband Sebastian could also be the father. Tanja advises Lydia to take matters into her own hands and kill the child inside of her, before Ansgar is going to leave her for the lie she told. Lydia leaves town after the break up with Ansgar. Over 2011, Hannes had gained three and a half-siblings, with the birth of Ansgar and Lydia's son Nick Brandner, the birth of Tanja's daughter Emma von Lahnstein with Sebastian and the discovery that Ansgar fathered Kim Wolf. Currently, Hannes is away at a boarding school in Switzerland and is only visiting from time to time. He returns with Tanja in December 2011, where Hannes is shown as a sassy young boy, who seems to be well aware of his family's power and wealth. While Hannes remains on good terms with Sebastian, who has become his step-father, however he seems to show a little resentment for his baby sister Emma when he looks at her for the first time. Hannes is also known as good poker player even though he's still young.

She stood for Birmingham Ladywood against Neville Chamberlain the Unionist Coalition candidate. Her slogan was 'A soldier's wife for Ladywood'. Although she came third behind Chamberlain and the Labour candidate J.W.Kneeshaw, she forced Chamberlain to address women's issues during his campaign, one of the few candidates who tried. Her papers at the Women's Library at the LSE in London contain a selection of her affectionate letters to her husband who was still in France for the early stages of the campaign. Chamberlain kept his sisters up to date with the campaign and his letters are preserved in the Cadbury Research Library at the University of Birmingham.

Claw who is revived when an eclipse forms the Exoda Ring and the demonic island Shina Dark rises once again. Kingdoms and villages from around the world send over a thousand sacrificial maidens to the island in an attempt to satisfy the demon lord's legendary lust and protect their lands from the unspeakable destruction he will bring. However, the legends are false; Exoda does not possess such lust, and is not interested in destroying the world. He's quite happy to live in peace and to go fishing on the weekends. The girls on the island are now unable to return to their homelands, as others see them as tainted brides of Satan. This presents many practical problems, from simply feeding the abandoned girls to giving their lives purpose. To this end, the demon lord enlists the help of two exiled princesses, Galett from the East Vansable Empire, and Christina from the Kingdom of Estgloria. The two princesses become the Green and Blue Moon Princesses, respectively, symbolic leaders of the new independent nation of Shina Dark, a nation created to give the abandoned girls a new life in a new country.

These legends have been written while Exoda has been asleep and are completely false as in fact he has a laid back and calm personality, despite being very powerful. After waking up and finding that his island is populated with hundreds of women exiled from their homelands as offerings to him, he decides to declare Shina Dark as an independent nation and declare Galett and Christina as its symbolic leaders, who are thus nicknamed the \\"Twin Moon Princesses\\". ; : :Galett is the fourth princess of the wealthy and advanced Vansable Empire, sent to Shina Dark to become Exoda's concubine in order to protect the peace of her home empire. Exoda grants her the title of Green Moon Princess of Shina Dark, one of the Twin Moon Princesses who are symbolic leaders of the nation of Shina Dark. She is a strong sword fighter and has been instrumental in the creation of a militia to protect the townspeople on the island. She was raised to be a knight and follow the codes of chivalry by an adviser of her father's, who she calls Grandfather. She has somewhat of a hard time governing Shina Dark during the time when Christina is recovering. With recent occurrences on the island, she starts to hold affectionate feelings towards Exoda (Satan). She regards Christina as a friend as well as a rival towards love. ; : :Christina is the thirteenth princess of the dwindling Estgloria Kingdom. The ruling Queen of Estgloria has sent Christina to Shina Dark out of hate for Christina's mother. Christina receives the title of Blue Moon Princess, the second of the Twin Moon Princesses. While not strong or possessing any real power which makes her feels useless, Christina later learns she is a skilled strategist, boosting her resolve.

The Shina Dark government is a Constitutional Monarchy with the Princesses as the heads of the government and an elected parliament supporting them, and Exoda as head of state, or monarch. Originally populated by the one thousand women sent as sacrifices, it later grew to include refugees who were invited or came to Shina Dark in search for a better life. ;Zirus Ziriola :One of two nations that lies between the Western and Eastern Continent, the other being the Magical Kingdom of Shumarika. Due to its strategic position, it is a nation heavily focused on trade. Zirus is one of the few known nations to openly trade with Shina Dark. ;Kingdom of Estgloria :A mighty kingdom in the Western Continent, Estgloria is now a shadow of its former self after the death of its King. Ruled by the Corrupt Regent, Queen Catherine S. Langton and her son, the Crown Prince Crispin, they ruled the kingdom without care, heavily taxing their citizens in order to fund theirs and the Nobles lavish lifestyle and hedonistic ways. ;Vansable Empire :Formerly a small kingdom, Vansable miraculously defeated a larger army that invaded them which later led to a series of wars that turn the kingdom into a mighty empire that ruled the Eastern Continent. Ruled by Emperor Galeon Fey Sowauge and Prime Minister Ernst D. Volkoren, the Vansable Empire is the richest and has the most technological advanced armies in the world.

Marcel Valotaire, Joseph H√©mard, Babou and Kahane, Paris, 1929, at pp.19-22. His lasting fame, however, lies in his book illustrations ‚Äì always distinctly French in character and often erotic ‚Äì which he produced for a great number of titles including many classics of French literature such as Le Malade Imaginaire (1920), Gargantua et Pantagruel (1922), Jacques Le Fataliste (1923), Cyrano de Bergerac (1927), and Aucassin et Nicolette (1936).

H√©mard also provided illustrations ‚Äì typically humorous cartoon-like drawings ‚Äì for many unlikely non-fiction works including a variety of technical and reference books. These included drawings for Le Formulaire Magistral, a technical pharmacological manual with formulas for preparing medications, as well as a French grammar and an arithmetic textbook, both of which he also authored, all published in 1927. The following year he published books he wrote and illustrated on French history and geography. Katz, supra, at pp. 172-174. H√©mard also published a number of humorously illustrated law codes, including the family law provisions of Le Code Civil, published in 1925, the Code P√©nal published in about 1929, and, in 1944, he published a lengthy, illustrated tax code of France, the Code G√©n√©ral des Imp√¥ts Directs et Taxes Assimil√©es, all published in Paris. Katz, supra, at pp. 163, 174. The illustrations in these three works, along with many others of H√©mard's, were printed in color using the \\"pochoir\\" (French for stencil) method in which stencils for each color to be printed are hand cut, typically out of celluloid or plastic, and the colors painted on using special brushes.National Museum of History and Technology, Pochoir, Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, D.C. 1977. See also \\"Vibrant Visions: Pochoir Prints in the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum Library\\", on line at . Pochoir produces intensely colored prints with a distinct fresh look and is best known for its use in French Art Nouveau and Art Deco prints in the early 20th century. Katz, supra, at pp. 171-172. H√©mard wrote a brief autobiographical essay, published by Babou and Kahane in French in 1928 and in English translation in 1929, which is largely devoid of factual detail. For example, after a random history of several \\"H√©mards\\", purportedly his ancestors, ending with his birth and two paragraphs on his childhood, he states, \\"And then I drew for books.\\" H√©mard said that he spent four and a half years as a prisoner of war in Germany during World War I, and must have been captured shortly after the war began.Valotaire, supra, at pp. 7-14. France was in the war from August 3, 1914, to November 11, 1918, four years and three months. See Hemard's published notes and sketches while imprisoned, Chez les Fritz (Paris 1919), indicates he was imprisoned no later than November 1914 and remained as late as 22 December 1918, after the war had ended. H√©mard had his most prolific period of book illustrations in the 1920s and 1930s. Although he remained in Paris and continued to work as an illustrator during the War, his anti-Nazi sentiments were expressed in illustrations and stories he contributed to a collection of humorous stories about the Occupation.M. Fougerole (ed.), Gavroche sous La Botte: Les Meilleures Histories Dr√¥les 1940 - 1945, Edition Sauba, Montreuil-Paris, [1945]. H√©mard continued his work at a reduced level after the War.

Franks wore #62 as a varsity letterman in 1941 and #63 in 1942. Franks was the first (or second depending on the source) African- American University of Michigan player to become an All-American in football. Illness cut short his collegiate athletic career. After Michigan, Franks pursued a career in dentistry. He also became an active community leader who contributed his time to public service and who helped to integrate Grand Rapids, Michigan by financing home construction in a majority Caucasian neighborhood. First African-American All-American football player at Michigan Franks, who was born in Macon, Georgia and raised in Hamtramck, Michigan, was named to the Detroit, Michigan, all-city team after the 1939 high school football season. He is the son of Julius Franks, Sr. and Nellie Mae Solomon and father of Daryl, Cheryl, Bobby, Beverly A Grant, Fredrick. After graduating from high school, he attended the University of Michigan, where he became the third African-American to play for the Michigan Wolverines football team. In 1942, he became the first African-American at Michigan to earn All-American honors. He is described as the second to be All-American by some accounts. Head coach Fritz Crisler said Franks was one of the hardest- working players he ever coached. The 1942 Wolverines' offensive line, which included Franks, Al Wistert, Robert Kolesar, Merv Pregulman, and Elmer Madar, was known as the \\"Seven Oak Posts\\". Franks credited the group's success to scrimmaging as rookies against the 1940 offense that included Tom Harmon, Forest Evashevski, and Bob Westfall. Franks was played all 60 minute in his games as a junior in 1942 and was named a first-team All American by the International News Service (Hearst newspapers), Central Press, and Collier's Weekly, and a second-team All-American by the Associated Press and New York Sun. In 1943, Franks and teammate Tom Kuzma came down with tuberculosis and were hospitalized at University Hospital for 25 months as they recuperated. Franks recalled that head coach Fritz Crisler was a regular visitor to his hospital room, and team star Tom Harmon also stopped to visit while on leave from military service. As a result of the hospitalization, Franks missed his senior year as a football player. He obtained his bachelor of science degree in 1947. In 1982, Franks was named to the University of Michigan Hall of Honor in the fifth class of inductees that was inducted in 1983. He was the twelfth Michigan football player to earn this honor. Professional career and community service In 1951, Franks earned his D.D.S. from the University of Michigan Dental School, and practiced dentistry in Grand Rapids, Michigan for more than 40 years. Franks was a leader in the Urban League, United Way, American Red Cross, Boy Scouts of America, and Rotary Club. In 1964, Michigan Governor George Romney appointed Franks to Western Michigan University's first Board of Trustees, where he served as a trustee until 1983. Franks served on several boards: Executive Communication, Vice President, President, 1951‚Äì87; Kent County Dental Society, 1951‚Äì92; Michigan & American Dental Association, 1951‚Äì96; trustee, Western Michigan University, 1964‚Äì82 (trustee emeritus, 1983); Director, Boulevard Memorial Medical Center, 1974‚Äì84; Director, United Way Kent County, 1987‚Äì92. In 1992, Franks contracted Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome, which forced him into retirement. In the 1960s, Franks helped to integrate Grand Rapids. In the early 1960s, African Americans were not welcome in Grand Rapids' \\"white\\" middle-class neighborhoods, and real estate agents would not show them houses. In 1962, Franks' friend, J.E. Adams, found vacant land designated as a potential park site. Adams, Franks, and friends Joseph Lee and Samuel Triplett created a plan to purchase the site and build a middle-class neighborhood for African-Americans. The announcement \\"caused an uproar that resulted in protests, lawsuits and threats.\\" When banks refused to finance the project, the four men purchased the land on their own for $60,000 and started building. The first of 51 houses was completed in 1965. Today, the neighborhood, known as Auburn Hills (not to be confused with Auburn Hills, Michigan), has a population of 542 and the lowest crime rate in Grand Rapids. In 2006, the Michigan Alumni Club gave Franks the \\"Paul G. Goebel, Sr. Distinguished Alumni in Athletics Award\\". In later years, Franks was also a leader with the Urban League, United Way and other groups.

He is the only show jumper to have won five Olympic gold medals and a total of seven Olympic medals, and to compete and win medals in six different Olympic Games. In the 1950s and 1960s Winkler was one of Germany's most popular athletes.  Career  Winkler was born in Barmen, today part of Wuppertal, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, the son of a riding teacher. His father, Paul Winkler, died as a soldier during the last week of World War II. The boy was drafted as a Flakhelfer and was a prisoner of war for a short time. The house of his mother in Frankfurt was destroyed by bombing. He made money, to support his mother and himself, as a groom in the stable of the Landgravine of Hesse in Kronberg im Taunus. He was also a riding teacher of the Americans who occupied the area. He began an apprenticeship in a textile store in Frankfurt in 1948. Winkler participated in show jumping competitions and won for the first time on 10 October 1948, in H√ºnfeld, on Falkner. A new Olympic Committee for Riding (DOKR) was founded in 1949 by Gustav Rau, who moved it to Warendorf. He called Winkler to join in 1950. In the morning, Winkler trained horses for the committee, in the afternoon he worked as a carpenter. Halla was a horse that the committee intended for eventing. Rau found her unsuitable for the task and called her owner and breeder Gustav Vierling in Darmstadt to take her back. Vierling came and asked Winkler to take care of the mare, which he accepted. The mare became an important part of his equestrian career. Winkler won his first German championship in 1952, but could not participate in the Olympic Games in Helsinki that year because he was classified as a professional due to his teaching in the 1940s. On an initiative of , he was qualified as an amateur by the end of the same year. Winkler won the World Championship with Halla in 1954, again in 1955, and became one of the favorites for the 1956 Olympic Games. In 1956 the Equestrian Games were held in Stockholm, as the athletes and their horses were not allowed to travel to Melbourne due to quarantine restrictions. In the first round Winkler pulled a groin muscle at the penultimate obstacle after his mare took off early and threw him out of position. Despite the pain Winkler decided to ride in the second round as the German team would be eliminated without him. After he was given tranquilizers Winkler found that he was comfortable sitting, but riding was difficult and painful. Any drugs that could reduce the pain enough to make him comfortable in the saddle also would reduce his mental capacity, and therefore, he was only given black coffee before his ride to try to help reduce his dizziness and double-vision. Halla apparently sensed that her rider was not right and performed the entire course clear with only steering from Winkler, and their performance won them the individual and team gold. Hans G√ºnter Winkler at the 2012 German show jumping and dressage derby in Hamburg Winkler won five gold medals in jumping (in addition to the four individual medals with the German team) between 1956 and 1976, as well as a silver medal and a bronze medal. He is one of the most successful German Olympic athletes, third only to Isabell Werth and Reiner Klimke for gold medals produced in German equestrian competition. He was German Sportspersonality of the Year in 1955 and 1956. Winkler retired from jumping on 13 July 1986 with the conclusion of the Aachen tournament. Winkler worked as a trainer for the German Olympic teams, along with Paul Schockem√∂hle and Herbert Mayer, leading them to success in Seoul in 1988. He consulted companies who wanted to sponsor equestrian sport, organized tournaments, and worked for the development of young riders. He later published numerous books on riding and in 1991 founded the HGW-Marketinggesellschaft, a sports marketing firm that has helped produce various equestrian competitions. He was also a member of the German Equestrian Federation's Jumping Committee and helped to select the 2000 Olympic Team for Germany. The German Equestrian Federation announced his death in Warendorf on 9 July 2018.  Awards  In May 2000, Winkler was the first recipient of the award, Goldene Sportpyramide, of the . On 12 June 2008, he received the Federal Cross of Merit in Warendorf from , minister of interior and sport in North Rhine-Westphalia. He also received the media prize Bambi Award.

Early life  Dobrowolski was born into an indigent family in Dworszowice Ko≈õcielne, and supported himself from the age of 12 by teaching younger students while a high school student in Warsaw. His involvement in seeking Polish independence led to a conviction to three years imprisonment in the Caucasus, but after two years he escaped and started studying in Switzerland and Belgium.  Belgian Antarctic Expedition  While still a student in biology, physics and chemistry at the University of Li√®ge he took part in the Belgian Antarctic Expedition (1897-1899) as assistant meteorologist. Henryk Arctowski, who was in charge of physical observations, was initially unsuccessfully in convincing expedition commander Adrien de Gerlache to take him on, but when the Belgica had to return to Ostend for repairs and the ship's doctor and a sailor quit, he was contracted as a sailor. However, his substantial scientific contributions prompted de Gerlache to formally promote him in March 1898. Arctowski and Dobrowolski were the first to conduct year-round meteorological and hydrographical observations off Antarctica. In addition he studied ice crystallography and light phenomena in ice clouds. These data enabled him to write a monumental treatise on the crystallography of ice and snow. After his return from the Antarctic he obtained a scholarship in Belgium to study his results and collaborated with Georges Lecointe at the Royal Observatory of Belgium.  Later career  In 1907 Nicholas II of Russia declared amnesty for political refugees, enabling Dobrowolski to return to Warsaw. Until 1914, he worked as a schoolteacher. During the First World War he lived in Sweden, where he studied ice and snow formation. After the war he returned to Poland, where he finished his treatise on the crystallography of ice and snow, Natural History of Ice ('). The concept of the cryosphere can be traced back to this monogram. He also published works on pedagogy and research ethics, while teaching pedagogy at the Polish Free University in Warsaw, and was deeply involved in the organization of education in newly independent Poland. In 1924 he was appointed deputy director, and later director, of the Polish Meteorological Institute in Warsaw. He founded several observatories and the Society of Geophysicists in Warsaw, and actively promoted polar research in Poland. During the second Polar Year (1932-1933) he provided practical help and advice to the Polish expedition that overwintered on Bear Island. He headed the organizing committee of the 1934 Polish expedition to Spitsbergen, and was involved with the 1938 Polish Expedition to Oscar II Land. After the Second World War he pushed for further Polish scientific involvement in Polar research. He died in 1954, without seeing the implementation of his ideas in the Polish participation in the International Geophysical Year. His fellow Polish explorers and scientists regarded him as a \\"father figure\\", and he naturally became a center of Polar knowledge. He died in Warsaw, aged 81.

The proposed line would link stations at Sheringham and Wymondham on the national rail network by using tracks of the two standard gauge heritage railways in the county, and restoring the former Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway line between Holt and Fakenham, creating a circular route which could be used by passenger services. The heritage lines affected are Mid- Norfolk Railway and the North Norfolk Railway, with the route including stations on both of these lines as well as on part of National Rail network and on a disused section between County School and Holt. History The line from Fakenham to Melton Constable was built by the Lynn and Fakenham Railway, later the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway's main line from Peterborough to Great Yarmouth. The line from Melton Constable to Holt was part of the M&GN; branch line to Cromer. The section between County School and Fakenham was part of the Norfolk Railway, later the Great Eastern Railway Wymondham to Wells Branch. The M&GN; main line closed to passengers in February 1959. The branch line remained open, operated as part of the line from Norwich Thorpe, when it was cut back to Sheringham in 1964. The passenger service on the GER line from Fakenham ended in 1964, with the line finally closing in the 1980s. Route The route is planned to run from Sheringham to Dereham via Holt and Fakenham. In January 2019, Campaign for Better Transport released a report listing the line as Priority 2 for reopening, with Priority 2 being described as \\"feasible projects which require further development or changed circumstances (for example, housing development proposals) to assist them in being taken forward\\".The Case for Expanding The Rail Network p.42 The route south from Fakenham, forming part of this scheme, is protected by North Norfolk District Council from any development that would be prejudicial to the restoration of a railway linePolicy CT7 Safeguarding Land for Sustainable Transport Uses. Developments The Midland & Great Northern section =The Sheringham link= The Sheringham link. After 36 years the Bittern line was reconnected to the North Norfolk Railway via an \\"occasional use\\" link between the Network Rail station and the North Norfolk Railway's tracks. Although the length of the link is only a few yards the agreement represents a step towards a permanent link and new interchange station. This link is initially available for occasional use (such as charter trains from Norwich and/or London) and for delivery of rolling stock. The crossing was opened on 11 March 2010, after two months of work. =The Holt link= The NOR trackbed at Holt. The first section of the formation to be purchased by the Norfolk Orbital Railway is located between the North Norfolk Railway's Holt station site and the town bypass, which was built on the railway formation. The NOR plans would see a line relaid on the wide verge beside the road.The plan for bringing the railway back into Holt The company paid ¬£25,000 for the 50-yard stretch of former track bed, and erected a small sign on a tree to indicate that it is now back in railway ownership. The section of formation was cleared of vegetation in 2016  The Great Eastern section  =Fakenham Land= NOR Bridge 1715 at Fakenham. In 2009 the Norfolk Orbital Railway attempted to secure a section of the railway formation in Fakenham, but was outbid by a London developer who claimed not to know of the project. The land was once again auctioned on 10 December 2014, and was secured for the railway project for ¬£24,000. In 2016 the project was awarded ¬£60,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund to help repair the Fakenham bridges, provide an education resource, equipment for the Fakenham Area Conservation Team and to create a walk along the preserved formation for people to enjoy. The walkway is currently maintained by the conservation team, but has also suffered from the attention of local vandals. In August 2019 the Lottery-funded restoration of the formation was completed, with local councillors and land-owners invited to a meeting at County School railway station, followed by a tour of the restored formation footpath.

History After the British evacuation of Boston in March 1776, General George Washington met with members of the Continental Congress to determine future military strategy. Faced with defending a huge amount of territory from potential British operations, Washington recommended forming a \\"flying camp\\", which in the military terminology of the day referred to a mobile, strategic reserve of troops. Congress agreed and on June 3, 1776, passed a resolution \\"that a flying camp be immediately established in the middle colonies and that it consist of 10,000 men ....\\" The men recruited for the Flying Camp were to be militiamen from three colonies: 6000 from Pennsylvania, 3400 from Maryland, and 600 from Delaware. They were to serve until December 1, 1776, unless discharged sooner by Congress, and to be paid and fed in the same manner as regular soldiers of the Continental Army. Congress appropriated $38,500 (in Spanish Dollars at 7s 6d [shillings and pence] per paper Continental dollar) for the Regiments‚Äô support. The pay rate per month was dictated by Congress: Colonel 450s, Lt. Colonel 400s, Major 350s, Captains 300s, Lieutenants 200s, Ensigns 160s, Sergeants 90s, Corporals 60s, and Privates 50s. Mounted dragoons, artillerymen, and militia serving outside their state received a 2s 6d bonus. Brigadier-General Hugh Mercer of Virginia was commissioned as its commandant. Samuel Patterson (a miller from Christiana Bridge, Delaware) was appointed its battalion colonel. The town of Christiana Bridge is located on Old Kings Road, which was one of the first major inland routes in the colonies between Baltimore, MD in the South, and Philadelphia, PA, in the North. The Flying camp was to be composed of troops from Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware for the immediate defense of New Jersey while the Main Army focused on the defense of New York. No such numbers were ever realized for this purpose, the total being under 6,000, but Maryland and tiny Delaware seemingly managed to fulfill their quotas. Delaware was assigned to provide 600 men from among those it had already recruited for one year, and the unit was to be \\"engaged to the first day of December next [1776].\\" Pennsylvania sent some 2,000 men, many of whom were quickly drafted into other service by Washington in New York. (Volo and Volo) Flying Camp Battalions A list of the Flying Camp Battalions initially formed in Delaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania in 1776 includes (Miller): * Delaware: 1st Battalion Flying Camp (Haslet‚Äôs) * Maryland: Captain Philip Maroney‚Äôs Company, Flying Camp * Maryland: 1st Regiment Flying Camp (William Smallwood) * Maryland: Flying Camp Regiment (Colonel Thomas Ewing) * Maryland: Flying Camp Regiment (Griffith's) * Maryland: Flying Camp Regiment (Richardson's) * Pennsylvania: 1st Regiment Flying Camp (Colonel Montgomery) * Pennsylvania: 2d Regiment Flying Camp (McAllister‚Äôs) * Pennsylvania: Baxter's Battalion Flying Camp * Pennsylvania: Clotz' Battalion Flying Camp, Lancaster County * Pennsylvania: Haller's Battalion Flying Camp * Pennsylvania: Watt's Regiment Flying Camp * Pennsylvania: Craig‚Äôs Regiment Flying Camp - Commanding Baxter‚Äôs A further Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment (of the Flying Camp) was authorized June 17, 1776 but was assigned to the Main Army. The Regiment was to consist of the three existing companies, two from Maryland and one from Virginia, plus two new companies to be raised in Maryland, and four new companies to be raised in Virginia. Captain Daniel Morgan‚Äôs company enlisted in (West) Virginia was the first from the South to reach the field. A German Battalion unofficially referred to as the 8th Maryland Regiment composed of eight companies from Pennsylvania and Maryland was also enlisted. Several Maryland militia companies were mustered into service and attached to the 400 that made up the Maryland Line (1st Maryland Regiment) and was ordered to New York, on July 4, 1776. There the Marylanders and those from Delaware took part in the fight at Brooklyn Heights. This was their baptism of fire in the war and a very costly battle for them as well. The soldiers from tiny Delaware, fighting alongside the 1st Maryland Regiment, may well have prevented the capture of the majority of Washington's army, an event that might have ended the colonial rebellion then and there. Some 300 of the 400 men from Maryland died, along with 31 of the men from Delaware. The British buried the dead in a mass grave consisting of six trenches in a farm field. Ultimately, of the original Maryland muster, 96 returned, with only 35 fit for immediate duty. Historian Thomas Field, writing in 1869, called the stand of these troops ‚Äúan hour more precious to liberty than any other in history.‚Äù (Field) Montgomery‚Äôs and McAllister‚Äôs Pennsylvanians were mostly made prisoner at the fall of Fort Washington. The remainder of the Pennsylvania Flying Camp marched home. Despite the best efforts of Gen. Mercer, the flying camp was fraught with difficulties almost from its inception, and never realizing its full potential. Colonel Patterson tallied the number of men remaining during the retreat across New Jersey at 461 (officers included) when the Flying Camp battalion arrived at Perth Amboy on 5 October, and at 480 of all ranks five days later. It was disbanded by the end of November. (Volo & Volo) The Flying Camp was an early and short-lived experiment with the concept of Extra Continental regiments, a \\"national\\" rather than a \\"confederate\\" force, which was to be distinct as having formed without any administrative connection to any individual state. Sixteen additional Continental regiments were approved by Congress as a separate group on December 27, 1776, specifically in response to a request from Washington for more troops other than mere militia, and Congress expressly delegated the formation of these regulars directly to him. All Additional Continental regiments were organized in the spring and summer of 1777. In contrast to both the Extra and Additional regiments, all other infantry regiments of the army were organized and supported under the direct authority of individual state governments .

She was home-schooled in her family's Christian socialist tradition and trained to be a teacher in Liverpool from 1881. She was a teacher at Bishop Otter College in Chichester from 1882 to 1884, and then taught at a working-class infant school in Chelsea until forced to stop by ill health in 1890. From 1893, she became secretary to her aunt, writer, suffragette and trade unionist Emilia Dilke (wife of Sir Charles Dilke). She published The State and Its Children in 1894, opposing child labour. She was involved with the Women's Trade Union League from 1891, and succeeded Emilia Dilke as its President in 1905. In 1908 she became president of the National Federation of Women Workers, and campaigned to protect women from industrial injuries such as lead poisoning and phossy jaw. In 1908 she was described in The Woman Worker newspaper as \\"the power that moves a myriad organizations. Behind a screen of plans to abolish sweating, to organize women, to prohibit poisonous glazes in pottery, to indemnify victimized workers, her alert spirit is tirelessly in motion\\". She retired in 1918, but continued to campaigning on public health issues. After Charles Dilke died in 1911, she, as his literary executor, co-wrote a two- volume biography with Stephen Gwynn (\\"begun by Stephen Gwynn, M. P., completed and ed. by Gertrude M. Tuckwell\\"). After the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 became law on 23 December 1919, Tuckwell was one of the first seven women appointed as a Justice of the Peace, and she was the first woman magistrate in London. She was a founder member of the Magistrates' Association in 1920, and was a member of its council from 1921 to 1940. She was the chair of the National Association of Probation Officers from 1933 to 1941. In 1930 she was inducted into the Order of the Companions of Honour. Tuckwell spent the last twenty years of her life at Little Woodlands, Wormley, Surrey. She died on 5 August 1951 at the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford. Her papers are lodged in the TUC Library Collections at the University of North London. These consist of approximately 700 folders of reports, pamphlets, leaflets and press cuttings accumulated by Tuckwell, regarding women's political and economic struggles from 1890 to 1920.

The Kirkland Lake Miners' Memorial is a memorial in Kirkland Lake, Ontario, dedicated to the city's mining labourers. During the 1930s the town's seven great gold mines (Macassa, Tough-Oaks, Kirkland Lake Gold, Lakeshore, Wright-Hargreaves, Teck-Hughes and Sylvanite) provided one million dollars to the province's economy and employed 4, 640 workers. However, now only a few mines remain, with Mcdermott mine, Hollaway, and Macassa mine is still open and in order to honour all miners, living and dead, the local Miners‚Äô Memorial Foundation constructed the 40-tonne 10 meter tall Miners‚Äô Memorial.  Background of this Grass-roots Project  The Miners' Memorial Foundation was chaired by Steven Yee, a local miner and president of the United Steel Workers ‚Äì District 6 Union. 2,3 The committee was largely made up of local miners and their mission was to create a monument in order to make sure that there was a place so that the miners who built their town could be remembered. After ten years of hard work the Miners' Memorial project culminated on July 25, 1994, when the Monument was completed and donated to the town of Kirkland Lake during its 75th anniversary celebration. The ceremony was attended by hundreds of local people 3. With regards to fundraising, this project was largely a 'grass roots' effort that relied upon community bingos and Nevadas. The federal and provincial governments also made important contributions as did a Rita MacNeil benefit. Even the artists who designed the monument, Rob Moir and Sally Lawrence, were local. Further, once all of the components of the Monument were created, they were assembled by miners who volunteered their spare time to see their project completed.  The Monument: Physical Structure  Overall Appearance This \\"40-tonne 10-meter-high black granite abstraction of a head frame\\" 2 is a monument in every sense of the word. Its black granite stone and bronzed figures speak to the timelessness of the miner, while the lawn and picnic tables in the park surrounding it facilitate the meeting of the past and present. This speaks to the manner in which the monument encourages remembrance and reconciliation with the past in order to provide a basis upon which the community's future can be forged. Physical Components of the Monument Every physical component of the Monument is local. Even the rock was taken from the nearby French River. All of the machinery and equipment was donated by miners or the mines. 2 The mucker, the ladder and even the batteries on the miner's belts are authentic. Further, even the bolts that are used to hold the Monument together are stone bolts taken from a mine. 3 It was important that everything was local and authentic because the Miners‚Äô Monument Foundation wanted the Monument to show as accurately as possible what it was like to work underground and to make the monument as ‚Äòhuman‚Äô and ‚Äòwarm‚Äô as possible. 2The monument was not supposed to be a cold monolith embodying only the danger of underground work, and it is instead a memorial infused with the miners‚Äô experiences. The Figures The emphasis upon facilitating a ‚Äòwarm‚Äô and ‚Äòhuman‚Äô message in the Monument is why the bronzed miner figures were made in the likeness of real miners. This also serves to remind us that even though the miners did hard underground work, they were still human beings. 2,3 The position and actions of the figures also carry with them significant messages. For example, the figure climbing the ladder speaks to the need for the community to continue to move forward, and to climb the proverbial ladder of Health and Safety. It is thus simultaneously a celebration of how far Health and Safety has come, a reminder of the need to continue to improve Health and Safety and a remembrance for those who died in the mines.1  Cultural Framing  Part of the significance of this Monument stems from how it is framed by the 'cultural landscape‚Äô surrounding it. Historians Sherry Lee Linkton and John Russo explain that \\"one way of thinking about a landscape is to view it as a representation, a text that can be read, much like a novel or a painting\\"5 and when this type of analysis is applied to the landscape around the Monument it demonstrates how the cultural landscape adds to its meaning in three important ways. 5 Firstly, the space occupied by the Monument is the former site of a bridge that was an important navigational and cultural landmark.3 Local people used to take pictures of the bridge and everybody knew what you were taking about when you mentioned 'the bridge.' However, the bridge was torn down after it became a safety hazard, leaving a spatial vacuum of cultural significance that the Miners‚Äô Memorial now occupies. 3 Secondly, the Monument was constructed on the former property of Harry Oakes, one of the town's most influential mine owners and a man who was Canada's largest tax payer during the 1930s.3,4 As an historical figure, Oakes is central in many of the town's histories and was the founder of Lakeshore Mine.'6 That the Monument stands upon Oakes‚Äô property is important because it helps brings memories of the town's miners and the mine owners together to present a more complete local history. Thirdly, standing at the town's periphery, the Monument is seen by all who enter it. This is important since part of the Monument's purpose was to act as a symbol of identity for the town, specifically to show anyone who enters the town that they are entering a mining town. 3,8  Community Importance  In addition to the historical, cultural and identity roles of the Monument outlined above, it carries further significance to the community. A few of these are: -The Monument inspired Bernie Jaworsky to write Lamps Forever Lit: A Memorial To Kirkland Lake Area Miners. After Mr. Jaworsky saw the list of the miners‚Äô names he wanted to 'get their stories‚Äô as well. He thus set out collecting stories and photographs from the families, especially the widows, of the miners‚Äô which he consolidated into his memorial-book.2 -The Monument's scaler figure is featured on the cover of Karl Beveridge and Jude Johnston's Marking Our Mark. The fact that of the 13 monuments and murals featured in their book it was Kirkland Lake's Miners‚Äô Memorial that they chose to represent their book. -The figure working the mucker was featured in commemorative mining stamp produced by the Canada Post3 -The Monument and its park are currently host to community picnics and seasonal caroling. Thus it is a site of celebration as well as for remembering a difficult past. 1 -It is featured in many textual discussions about the town, such as Bob Cowen's monograph and the flyer for Lamps7,9  References  1:Beveridge, Karl and Jude Johnston.

Early years Walker was Louisiana's 1972 all-state quarterback and the state's outstanding offensive player while playing for Sulphur High School in Sulphur, Louisiana, where he was tagged with his nickname, \\"Moon\\". Texas A&M; In 1973, at age 17, Walker became the youngest-ever college quarterback. In Walker's first start of his freshman season, Texas A&M; defeated the TCU Horned Frogs, 35‚Äì16. The victory broke a four-game losing streak against the Frogs and was the first of 24 straight the Aggies have won in the series. The Aggies finished the season as the third-highest-scoring team in A&M; history, and Walker was named the U.P.I. Southwest Conference Freshman of the Year. Walker was the quarterback his sophomore season in 1974 and led A&M; through an 8-3 campaign, A&M;'s first winning season since the victorious Cotton Bowl team of 1967. Their 21-14 win against the 5th ranked LSU Tigers, the Aggies' second in 15 tries at LSU's Tiger Stadium, moved the previously unranked squad to #9 in the country. In the game, the Aggies had three ball carriers break the century mark in rushing; Skip Walker with 130, Bubba Bean with 127, and fullback Bucky Sams who finished with 107 yards and scored the winning touchdown late in the 4th quarter. A final game loss at Texas kept them from the Cotton Bowl and the SWC championship, thus allowing Grant Teaff's Baylor team, a 20-0 victim of the Aggies earlier in the season, to claim the crown. The Aggies' Top 15 ranking marked the first time since 1957 the Aggies had been ranked at season's end and only the sixth since their 1939 National Championship. Walker was replaced by Texas All-Stater David Shipman during the 1975 season and did not play. The Aggies rose to #2 and the country's top-ranked defense before ending the season with one-sided losses to Arkansas and Liberty Bowl opponent Southern California. In 1976, he regained the starting QB job for the final six games, all lop-sided victories, including the first win in 20 years on the University of Texas campus in a decisive 27-3 victory in Darryl Royal's final A&M; game as UT's head coach. Walker capped off the season by leading the Aggies to a 37-14 victory over Florida in the Sun Bowl, applying the finishing touches to A&M;'s second consecutive 10 win season, a first in A&M; history and a feat accomplished only 3 times since. In the game Walker was 11 of 18 for 122 yards, including a touchdown pass to fullback George Woodard. Walker also scored in the 2nd quarter on a 9-yard keeper. The Sporting News ranked Texas A&M; #3 and the A.P. had them 7th in the country following the season. It would be 1985 before the Aggies would be ranked again in a final poll. Walker led Texas A&M; to a 37-14 Sun Bowl victory over Florida to cap off the 1976 season and had the Aggies ranked No. 5 in the AP poll after a 33-17 win over No. 7 Texas Tech in 1977. Walker set a Texas A&M; single-game for rushing yards by a quarterback when he carried 27 times for 182 yards in a come-from-behind 38-21 win against SMU. The single-game yardage record stood for more than 30 years until Johnny Manziel rushed for 229 yards against Oklahoma in the 2013 Cotton Bowl Classic. Walker was injured for a game against TCU in the 1977 season, but returned for the final regular season games against top-ranked Texas and the University of Houston to complete the 8-3 season. He then sat out the 47-28 1977 Bluebonnet Bowl loss to USC until the final minutes. Later years In 2011, Walker published a memoir, I'll Tell You When You're Good!: The Memoir of America's Youngest College Quarterback, recounting the difficulties of his college football career. In 2012, he was rated among the top ten quarterbacks in Texas A&M; history. Walker was one of 13 football players inducted into the Sulphur High School Centennial Hall of Fame on April 20, 2013.

Of noble Irish descent, related by birth to the first Earl Castle Stewart and by marriage to the Earl of Tyrone, Hamilton's extensive career and brave service was widely recognised during his life and after his death. Early career John Hamilton was born in Woodbrook near Strabane, County Tyrone, Ireland to James and Elinor Hamilton in 1755. His mother was the niece of the Earl Castle Stewart and through family connections young Hamilton was able to secure a commission in the army of the Honourable East India Company aged only 16 in 1771. Taking a Bengal cadetship and joining the Bengal Light Infantry in 1772, Hamilton was almost immediately pressed into action, participating the British invasion of Cooch Behar at the invitation its rulers who were facing a simultaneous invasion from the Bhutanese to the north. In 1778 Hamilton was promoted to lieutenant and in 1780 was once again in action during the First Anglo-Maratha War, where his troops participated in the storm and capture of Lahar, Gwalior and Bijaigarh from the Maratha Empire. In 1781 at the war's conclusion, Hamilton was promoted again, to captain. In 1788, seeking advancement, Hamilton transferred to the regular British Army, being attached to the new 76th Regiment of Foot in Calcutta as captain. With this formation, Hamilton was engaged in 1794 during the Second Mysore War fought against the Tipu Sultan, when his troops captured the city of Bangalore which later became part of British East India. The same year, Hamilton married Emily Sophia Monck, the daughter of George Paul Monck and Lady Aramita Beresford, daughter of Marcus Beresford, Earl of Tyrone. Hamilton was promoted to brevet major in the aftermath of this operation and in 1795 was sent as a lieutenant colonel with the 81st Regiment of Foot to the West Indies during the British attempt to capture San Domingo. The effort failed due to the ongoing Haitian Revolution, but Hamilton again distinguished himself during the campaign. Napoleonic Wars In 1798 Hamilton was sent to the Cape Colony in South Africa which had only recently been captured from the Dutch. There he and his regiment formed part of the garrison until the Peace of Amiens when he returned to Britain, briefly returning to the Cape at the fresh outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803 before being made a brigadier-general and appointed to the staff in Ireland. Tiring of working in Ireland, Hamilton volunteered in 1809 to be attached to the Portuguese Army, a formation shattered by the French invasion of 1808. In 1809 as he trained and organised a division of Portuguese infantry, Hamilton was promoted to major-general and in his new rank was made Inspector-General of Portuguese Infantry. Hamilton was an efficient officer and with his division, attached himself to Sir Arthur Wellesley's British army on campaign in 1810. In 1811 the Portuguese formation underwent its first major action at the Battle of Albuera, Hamilton's division acting as a ready reserve and being called into the height of the battle to reinforce the Allied centre. Hamilton's forces had in fact been drawn into the fight on the left of the Allied line and took some time to be extracted. In the aftermath of the battle, Hamilton's troops were the steadiest and freshest available and immediately returned to the ultimately unsuccessful Second Siege of Badajoz. It has been said of Hamilton that he \\"evinced the utmost steadiness and courage\\" at Albuera. Hamilton commanded the division until 1813, his troops seeing further action defending the town of Alba de Tormes against an army under Marshal Soult in November 1812. In 1813 after four years continuous campaigning, Hamilton was forced to return to England on sick leave and during his absence he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword by the Portuguese monarchy and was knighted by the Prince Regent as well as being made honorary colonel of the 2nd Ceylon Regiment. Hamilton returned to his division in late 1813 and commanded them during the last of the fighting in the Peninsula War, seeing action at the Battle of Nivelle. Following the Peace of Fontainebleau, Hamilton returned to the British Army, was made lieutenant general in recognition of his service and placed in the quiet command of Duncannon Fort.Hamilton, Sir John, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, H. M. Chichester, Retrieved 27 November 2007 In December 1814, Hamilton was further rewarded with a baronetcy and retirement to his family estates. In 1823 he was made the Colonel-in-chief of 69th Regiment of Foot. He died in 1835 at Tunbridge Wells and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in London, survived by his wife, five daughters and son Sir John James Hamilton, 2nd Baronet.

He was a Labor member of the Australian House of Representatives, representing the Division of Lindsay, in New South Wales, from 2007 until 2013.Australian Parliament ‚Äì David Bradbury profile Bradbury was the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, Assistant Treasurer, Minister Assisting for Financial Services and Superannuation, and Minister Assisting for Deregulation. He is currently the Head of Tax Policy and Statistics at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Centre For Tax Policy and Administration.  Early life and education  Bradbury was born and raised in Fairfield in Western Sydney. He was educated at Patrician Brothers' College, Fairfield, where he was elected College Captain in 1993. Bradbury studied at the University of Sydney where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws with Honours. He subsequently completed postgraduate studies in taxation law, also at the University of Sydney. Career Pre- political career Before entering Parliament, Bradbury was admitted as a solicitor of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 2002. Bradbury was a Senior Associate specialising in taxation law with the corporate law firm Blake Dawson, where he worked as a lawyer from 2002 to 2007. Political career =Before entering Parliament= Bradbury joined the Australian Labor Party in 1994 and quickly became active in the youth wing of the NSW Branch of the party. In 1998, he was elected President of New South Wales Young Labor. In 1999, Bradbury was elected as a councillor to the East Ward of Penrith City Council. He served as a councillor until 2008, which included two terms as Mayor of the Penrith City. When Bradbury was elected Mayor of Penrith in his first term, at the age of 24 years, he was the youngest person to hold that office in the City‚Äôs history. . Bradbury ran for the marginal seat of Lindsay in Sydney‚Äôs west at the 2001 and 2004 Federal elections, where he was unsuccessful. =Election as the Member for Lindsay= Bradbury was elected to the seat of Lindsay in the Australian House of Representatives at the 2007 election as part of Kevin Rudd‚Äôs incoming Labor Government. He served as chair of the Caucus Economics Committee, as well as a member of the House Economics and House Communications committees and the Joint Public Accounts Committee. Bradbury was re-elected to the seat of Lindsay in the 2010 election in a close electoral contest that he narrowly won by 1,865 votes. The result in Lindsay played an important role in helping Julia Gillard form minority government in the weeks after the 2010 election. =Ministerial Office= On 14 September 2010, Bradbury was sworn in as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer in the Second Gillard Ministry. As Parliamentary Secretary, Bradbury had responsibility for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, Corporate Governance, including Executive Remuneration policy, and Financial Literacy. On 5 March 2012, Bradbury was elevated to the role of Assistant Treasurer, and Minister Assisting for Deregulation in a cabinet reshuffle following 2012 Labor party leadership spill a week earlier and the resignation of previous Assistant Treasurer Mark Arbib. As Assistant Treasurer, Bradbury retained responsibility for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs and assumed responsibility in areas such as Taxation Policy, Foreign Investment Policy and the Not-for-Profit sector. On 1 July 2013, following the return of Kevin Rudd to the Prime Ministership, Bradbury was sworn in as Assistant Treasurer, Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, Minister Assisting for Deregulation and Minister Assisting for Financial Services and Superannuation. As part of his ministerial responsibilities in the Rudd and Gillard Governments, Bradbury served on the Expenditure Review Committee of Cabinet and had administrative oversight for a number of the nation‚Äôs key economic regulators, including the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), the Productivity Commission, the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) and the Australian Charities and Not-for- Profits Commission (ACNC). =Corporate and Multinational Tax Avoidance= During his time as Assistant Treasurer, Bradbury was at the forefront of the Labor Government‚Äôs efforts to crack down on corporate and multinational tax avoidance. In November 2012, he outlined a number of concerns about base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) by multinationals, especially the large digital firms. He declared that the government would implement a range of measures to address these concerns. As part of these efforts, Bradbury led a number of ground-breaking initiatives, which included: *a major revision of Australia‚Äôs General Anti-Avoidance Rules, *the modernisation of Australia‚Äôs transfer pricing laws, *the announcement of a wide-ranging BEPS package of corporate tax reforms, which included tightening Australia‚Äôs thin capitalisation rules, *the introduction of new laws requiring greater tax transparency by requiring the publication of details by the Commissioner of Taxation of tax paid by large multinationals. =Defeat at the 2013 Election= In 2013, the Rudd Labor Government was defeated by the incoming Abbott Liberal-National Government. Bradbury was defeated at the 2013 election by Fiona Scott, whom he had defeated in 2010. Post-politics In April 2014 Bradbury took up a position heading the Tax Policy and Statistics Division within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Centre For Tax Policy and Administration. In this role, Bradbury has been leading a team of economists, lawyers and statisticians who provide country- specific and general tax policy advice, carry out economic analysis, and produce internationally comparable tax data and analysis . At the OECD, Bradbury was a key contributor to the delivery of the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project and its implementation. He has also led the OECD‚Äôs involvement with the Task Force on the Digital Economy and led the team responsible for delivering the interim report on the Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation to the G20 Finance Ministers and Leaders. In 2018, Bradbury was ranked No.1 in the International Tax Review‚Äôs Global Tax 50 list of the most influential people in global tax policy . Personal life Bradbury and his wife Kylie have four children. He and his family currently live in Paris, France.

It is based on the theory of John Maynard Keynes presented in his work The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. It is one of the primary simplified representations in the modern field of macroeconomics, and is used by a broad array of economists, from libertarian, monetarist supporters of laissez-faire, such as Milton Friedman, to post-Keynesian supporters of economic interventionism, such as Joan Robinson. Modeling The AD/AS model is used to illustrate the Keynesian model of the business cycle. Movements of the two curves can be used to predict the effects that various exogenous events will have on two variables: real GDP and the price level. Furthermore, the model can be incorporated as a component in any of a variety of dynamic models (models of how variables like the price level and others evolve over time). The AD‚ÄìAS model can be related to the Phillips curve model of wage or price inflation and unemployment. A special case is a horizontal AS curve which means the price level is constant. The AD curve represents the locus of equilibrium in the IS‚ÄìLM model. The two models produce the same results with a constant price level. Aggregate demand curve The AD (aggregate demand) curve is defined by the IS‚ÄìLM equilibrium income at different potential price levels. The downward sloping AD curve is derived from the IS‚ÄìLM model. IS‚ÄìLM diagram, with real income plotted horizontally and the interest rate plotted vertically AD‚ÄìAS diagram, with real income plotted horizontally and the price level plotted vertically It shows the combinations of the price level and level of the output at which the goods and assets markets are simultaneously in equilibrium. The equation for the AD curve in general terms is: : Y=Y^{d}(\\\\tfrac{M}{P}, G, T, Z_1) where Y is real GDP, M is the nominal money supply, P is the price level, G is real government spending, T is real taxes levied, and Z1 other variables that affect the location of the IS curve (any component of spending) or the LM curve (influences on money demand). The real money supply has a positive effect on aggregate demand, as does real government spending; taxes has a negative effect on it. Slope of AD curve The slope of the AD curve reflects the extent to which real balances (i.e., the real value of the money balances held by an individual or by the economy as a whole) change the level of spending (consumption, government, investment), taking both assets and goods markets into consideration. An increase in real balances will lead to an increase in equilibrium spending and income. These increases will be dependent on the value of the multiplier. For example, the smaller the interest responsiveness of money demand, the smaller the effect on spending and income; the higher the interest responsiveness of investment demand, the greater the resulting increase in spending and income. Effect of monetary expansion on the AD curve Aggregate demand curve shifts rightward in case of a monetary expansion An increase in the nominal money stock leads to a higher real money stock at each level of prices. In the asset market, the decrease in interest rates induces the public to hold higher real balances. It stimulates the aggregate demand and thereby increases the equilibrium level of income and spending. Thus, the aggregate demand curve shifts right. Aggregate supply curve The aggregate supply curve (AS curve) describes the quantity of output the firms plan to supply for each given price level. The Keynesian aggregate supply curve shows that the AS curve is significantly horizontal implying that the firm will supply whatever amount of goods is demanded at a particular price level during an economic depression. The idea behind that is because there is unemployment, firms can readily obtain as much labour as they want at that current wage and production can increase without any additional costs (e.g. machines are idle which can simply be turned on). Firms' average costs of production therefore are assumed not to change as their output level changes. This provides a rationale for Keynesians' support for government intervention. The total output of an economy can decline without the price level declining; this fact, in conjunction with the Keynesian belief of wages being inflexible downwards, clarifies the need for government stimulus. Since wages cannot readily adjust low enough for aggregate supply to shift outward and improve total output, the government must intervene to accomplish this result. However, the Keynesian aggregate supply curve also contains a normally upward-sloping region where aggregate supply responds accordingly to changes in price level. The upward slope is due to the law of diminishing returns as firms increase output, which states that it will become marginally more expensive to accomplish the same level of improvement in productive capacity as firms grow. It is also due to the scarcity of natural resources, the rarity of which causes increased production to also become more expensive. The vertical section of the Keynesian curve corresponds to the physical limit of the economy, where it is impossible to increase output. The classical aggregate supply curve comprises a short-run aggregate supply curve and a vertical long-run aggregate supply curve. The short-run curve visualizes the total planned output of goods and services in the economy at a particular price level. The \\"short-run\\" is defined as the period during which only final good prices adjust and factor, or input, costs do not. The \\"long-run\\" is the period after which factor prices are able to adjust accordingly. The short-run aggregate supply curve has an upward slope for the same reasons the Keynesian AS curve has one: the law of diminishing returns and the scarcity of resources. The long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical because factor prices will have adjusted. Factor prices increase if producing at a point beyond full employment output, shifting the short-run aggregate supply inwards so equilibrium occurs somewhere along full employment output. Monetarists have argued that demand- side expansionary policies favoured by Keynesian economists are solely inflationary. As the aggregate demand curve is shifted outward, the general price level increases. This increased price level causes households, or the owners of the factors of production to demand higher prices for their goods and services. The consequence of this is increased production costs for firms, causing short-run aggregate demand to shift back inwards. The theoretical ultimate result is inflation. The mainstream AS-AD model contains both a long- run aggregate supply curve (LRAS) and a short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve essentially combining the classical and Keynesian models. In the short run wages and other resource prices are sticky and slow to adjust to new price levels. This gives way to the upward sloping SRAS. In the long-run, resource prices adjust to the price level bringing the economy back to a full employment output; along vertical LRAS. Shifts in aggregate supply curves The Keynesian model, in which there is no long-run aggregate supply curve and the classical model, in the case of the short-run aggregate supply curve, are affected by the same determinants. Any event that results in a change of production costs shifts the curves outwards or inwards if production costs are decreased or increased, respectively. Some factors which affect short-run production costs include: taxes and subsidies, price of labour (wages), and price of raw materials. These factors shift short-run curves exclusively. Changes in the quantity and quality of labour and capital affect both long-run and short-run supply curves. A greater quantity of labour or capital corresponds to a lower price for both. A greater quality in labour or capital corresponds to a greater output per worker or machine. The long-run aggregate supply curve of the classical model is affected by events that affect the potential output of the economy. Factors revolve around changes in the quality and quantity of factors of production. Fiscal and monetary policy under Classical and Keynesian cases Keynesian Case: If there is a fiscal expansion i.e. there is an increase in the government spending or a cut in the taxes, it will shift the AD curve rightwards. The shift would then imply an increase in the equilibrium output and employment. In the Classical case, the AS curve is vertical at the full employment level of output. Firms will supply the equilibrium level of output whatever the price level may be. Now, the fiscal expansion shifts the AD curve rightwards, thus leading to an increase in the demand for goods, but the firms cannot increase the output as there is no labour force which can be obtained. As firms try to hire more labour, they bid up wages and their costs of production and thus they charge higher prices for the output. The increase in prices reduces the real money stock and leads to an increase in the interest rates and reduction in spending. The equation for the aggregate supply curve in general terms for the case of excess supply in the labor market, called the short-run aggregate supply curve, is :Y=Y^{s}(W/P, \\\\ \\\\ P/P^{e}, \\\\ \\\\ Z_2) where W is the nominal wage rate (exogenous due to stickiness in the short run), Pe is the anticipated (expected) price level, and Z2 is a vector of exogenous variables that can affect the position of the labor demand curve (the capital stock or the current state of technological knowledge). The real wage has a negative effect on firms' employment of labor and hence on aggregate supply. The price level relative to its expected level has a positive effect on aggregate supply because of firms' mistakes in production plans due to mis-predictions of prices. The long-run aggregate supply curve refers not to a time frame in which the capital stock is free to be set optimally (as would be the terminology in the micro-economic theory of the firm), but rather to a time frame in which wages are free to adjust in order to equilibrate the labor market and in which price anticipations are accurate. In this case the nominal wage rate is endogenous and so does not appear as an independent variable in the aggregate supply equation. The long-run aggregate supply equation is simply :Y=Y^{s}(Z_2) and is vertical at the full-employment level of output. In this long-run case, Z2 also includes factors affecting the position of the labor supply curve (such as population), since in labor market equilibrium the location of labor supply affects the labor market outcome. Shifts of aggregate demand and aggregate supply The following summarizes the exogenous events that could shift the aggregate supply or aggregate demand curve to the right. Exogenous events happening in the opposite direction would shift the relevant curve in the opposite direction. Shifts of aggregate demand The following exogenous events would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. As a result, the price level would go up. In addition if the time frame of analysis is the short run, so the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping rather than vertical, real output would go up; but in the long run with aggregate supply vertical at full employment, real output would remain unchanged. Rightward aggregate demand shifts emanating from the IS curve: * An exogenous increase in consumer spending * An exogenous increase in investment spending on physical capital * An exogenous increase in intended inventory investment * An exogenous increase in government spending on goods and services * An exogenous increase in transfer payments from the government to the people * An exogenous decrease in taxes levied * An exogenous increase in purchases of the country's exports by people in other countries * An exogenous decrease in imports from other countries Rightward aggregate demand shifts emanating from the LM curve: * An exogenous increase in the nominal money supply * An exogenous increase in the demand for money supply i.e. liquidity preference Shifts of aggregate supply The following exogenous events would shift the short-run aggregate supply curve to the right. As a result, the price level would drop and real GDP would increase. * An exogenous decrease in the wage rate * An increase in the physical capital stock * Technological progress ‚Äî improvements in our knowledge of how to transform capital and labor into output The following events would shift the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right: * An increase in population * An increase in the physical capital stock * Technological progress Transition dynamics * Movement back to the steady state is fastest when the economy is furthest from its steady state. * This means that as the aggregate supply is shocked by factors of production, it will move away from its steady state. In response, the supply will slowly shift back to the steady state equilibrium, first with a large reaction, then consequently smaller reactions until it reaches steady state. The reactions back to equilibrium are largest when furthest from steady state, and become smaller as they near equilibrium. For example, a shock increase in the price of oil is felt by producers as an increase in the factors of production. This shifts the supply curve upward by raising expected inflation. This slows the adjustment of the AS curve back to its steady state. As the inflation slowly falls, so will the AS curve back to its steady state. Monetarism The modern quantity theory states that the price level is directly affected by the quantity of money. Milton Friedman was the recognized intellectual leader of an influential group of economists, called monetarists, who emphasize the role of money and monetary policy in affecting the behaviour of output and prices. The modern quantity theory also disagrees with the strict quantity theory in not believing that the supply curve is vertical in the short run. Thus, Friedman and other monetarists made an important distinction between the short run and long run effects of changes in money. They said that in the long run money is more or less neutral: changes in the nominal money stock have no real effects and only change prices.

The centre of Hurupaki Mountain lies between Three Mile Bush Road and Dip Road, approximately 1.5 kilometres west of Kamo township. Hurupaki Mountain is visible from State Highway 1. Characteristics Hurupaki Mountain is a high scoria cone that is thought to be about 300,000 years old. It is part of the Puhipuhi-Whangarei volcanic field. This volcanic area is similar to the Auckland volcanic field in that it has formed over a type of hot spot in the mantle, i.e. not at a current plate boundary. The Whangarei Field is older than the Auckland field, in fact Hurupaki is probably one of the younger centres. There is another basaltic field in Northland, and that is the Kaikohe-Bay of Islands field. That also has some young scoria cones and lava flows. Both of these Northland Fields are older than the Auckland Field. Hurupaki Mountain is a steep sided, partly bush-covered scoria cone. It is 1‚Äì2 km in diameter and 170m high, and has been extensively quarried on the west side. One quarry exposes an eruption sequence showing that magma variation occurred during eruption. The east side shows an excellent example of a young scoria cone. A multivented cone forms a smaller knoll approximately 400 metres to the east, less than 150 metres high, on which a few houses stand. This is an east most cone of a group of three centres: (east to west) Hurupaki, Rawhitiroa and Ngararatunua. Pre European History of Hurupaki Mountain Hurupaki is a MƒÅori word and means to cover with a cloak. Hurupaki Mountain was once a large MƒÅori pa with a considerable number of pits and terraces. When occupied, the pa would have been clear of trees. The slopes of the hill were terraced to provide flat areas on which to build houses, construct storage pits and as general living areas. The pa has about 70 pits on it; most of these were probably used as underground storage for kumara and berries, grown on the slopes of the hill. Some of the shallow pits and terraces would have had whares built on them. The Maori chief, Pohe, had his pa on the mountain, and was chief of most of the area within the Whangarei district, as so claimed by his descendants. He was the right-hand man of Hone Heke, and was trusted by Heke to fulfil his role as guardian of the Whangarei Harbour and Kamo West area, known as Nga-rara-i-tunua. Present day Today Hurupaki Mountain is partly farmed (cows and sheep). There is also a small pine tree plantation and the rest is in native bush. There is public access to the top of the mountain, although there is no viewing platform at the top.
