He was born in the theatre, which was then named the Globe, and was named after actor and theatre manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree. He became renowned for attacking props and wandering into the actors' dressing rooms. Beerbohm came to public attention when he wandered across the stage during a 1978 performance by Hinge and Bracket, a trick he repeated throughout his life. Beerbohm retired in 1991 and went to live with the theatre's master carpenter in Beckenham. After his death in March 1995 the news was carried in many national newspapers and he became the first (and so far only) cat to receive a front-page obituary in The Stage.  Biography  The Gielgud Theatre in 2011 Beerbohm was 20 years old when he died, meaning that he was born in 1974 or 1975. According to one writer, he was born in the Globe Theatre (later renamed the Gielgud Theatre after actor and director John Gielgud) in London's West End in the 1970s; however, his obituary in The Stage states that he \\"arrived at the Globe during the run of Donkey's Years in 1976\\". Theatres historically maintained cats on the premises as a means of controlling vermin, but their role increased over time as actors came to see them as good-luck charms and a means of reducing stress. Beerbohm, a tabby cat, was named after Herbert Beerbohm Tree, an actor and theatre manager. Beerbohm the cat soon gained a reputation for wandering into dressing rooms and attacking feathered hats and stuffed birds used as props. He came to public attention when he began a habit of wandering across the stage in the middle of productions. Beerbohm's first appearance was during a performance of the Hinge and Bracket Review in 1978. He is also said to have enjoyed entering the dressing rooms of Michael Gambon and Peter Bowles. He became known as one of the most famous of all theatre cats and counted Paul Eddington and Penelope Keith amongst his biggest fans. As a result of his popularity amongst actors he was mentioned several times on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs. Beerbohm is said to have once been addicted to chocolate (a dependence he successfully overcame) and to have survived being run over by a car on the streets of Soho. He was said to have had a girlfriend at the Lyric Theatre whom he would rush off to see frequently. Beerbohm's career is said to be the longest of any modern-day theatre cat and lasted until his retirement in 1991, when he went to live with Tony Ramsey, the theatre's master carpenter, in Beckenham.\\"Goodbye to carpenter\\", The Stage, 5 September 1991, p. 20.

After World War I, she and her husband struggled for eight years to farm fifty acres in Kent, before deciding to emigrate to homestead in Rhodesia. She sailed for Cape Town in July 1928, travelling on by land to Salisbury.

A \\"stumpy-tailed,\\" \\"portly,\\" and \\"unattractive\\" tabby cat, he was a favourite of Lear's and played an important role as a companion in the poet's lonely later years. Foss is mentioned frequently in Lear's correspondence and appears in his illustrations and at least one poem. Foss is said to have been the inspiration for the pussycat in Lear's illustrations for his poem \\"The Owl and the Pussycat\\". The funeral that Lear provided for Foss, which included an epigraphed headstone, is said to have been more elaborate than Lear's own.  Description Archdeacon William Bevan Foss is said to have been adopted by Edward Lear whilst a kitten in 1873, though Lear later claimed he was older. His full name was the Greek word Aderphos (a variant of Adelphos, \\"brother\\"), but he was generally known by the shortened form of \\"Foss\\" or, particularly by Lear, \\"Old Foss\\". Foss was a tabby cat described as \\"unattractive.\\" His tail was cut short by Lear's servants to try to prevent him from wandering. No photographs survive of the cat, as he jumped out of Lear's arms on the only occasion when one was to be taken. Lear grew fond of Foss and he was said to be his favourite animal. Foss was mentioned often in Lear's correspondence, to the extent that he was said to have been almost as famous as Lear at the time. He was said to roll on Lear's manuscripts to help dry the ink. Many accounts say that when Lear was planning his relocation to Sanremo, he had his architect design his new villa on the same floor plan as his previous home to avoid confusing Foss. Despite this, on his first day in the villa Foss climbed into one of its chimneys. Artistic influence Lear's pussycat Foss is said to have been the model for the pussycat in Lear's \\"The Owl and the Pussycat\\" illustrations, though he chose to depict a full-length tail. Foss is also mentioned in Lear's poem \\"How Pleasant to Know Mr Lear\\": There are also many drawings by Lear of Foss, including the two together and a series depicting Foss in supposed heraldic poses ‚Äì these include couchant, passant, rampant, regardant, and the more fanciful \\"dansant\\" (dancing) and \\"a untin\\" (hunting). The New York Times said that Lear's illustrations of Foss were his best caricatures. Death  Edward Lear Aged 73 and a Half and His Cat Foss, Aged 16 (1885) Foss was a key companion in Lear's later years, at a time when Lear was battling depression and loneliness. Foss died at Lear's Villa Tennyson in Sanremo in November 1887, just two months before Lear's own death. Foss has been reported as being 14, 16 or 17 years old at the time of his death, though Lear was convinced that he was much older and had the age of 31 years engraved on Foss' headstone. Some of Lear's pre-1872 drawings depict a cat very similar to Foss with a stumpy tail, tabby markings, and a portly appearance, and it is possible that Lear, knowingly or otherwise, conflated his imagined cat with the real Foss. Foss was buried under his own headstone ‚Äì with an epitaph composed by Lear ‚Äì beneath a fig tree in the garden at Villa Tennyson. Foss' funeral is said to have had greater pomp and ceremony than Lear's own, which was poorly attended. Foss is mentioned in the song \\"Mr Lear\\" by British folk singer Al Stewart on his 2005 album A Beach Full of Shells.

The firearm has two separate designs. One is intended for tactical, self-defense, and law enforcement applications, whereas the other is designed for competitive disciplines. Despite its intended applications, it is often used by a minority of hunters and sporting clay shooters. The 1301 is a successor to the 1201 Tactical model, and it shares many similarities with Beretta's A400 line of shotguns, which are successors to the A391 series. All modern 1301 shotguns, much like their A400 counterparts, make use of a Beretta proprietary choke constriction system known as \\"Optima-HP..\\" One exception is the early tactical model, which used a fixed cylinder constriction barrel. These barrels are backbored for reduced muzzle rise and improved patterning.  Models = 1301 Tactical = The Beretta 1301 Tactical is the successor to the 1201, and began production in Italy in 2014. As the namesake implies, it is designed solely for tactical applications, encompassing law enforcement and civilian defense. It is often viewed as a competitor to the M4 Super 90 manufactured by Benelli, a sister company of Beretta. In recent years, it has seen small modifications, and new variants are entering the market. = 1301 Competition = The Beretta 1301 Competition, as the name implies, is designed for competitive shooting disciplines, most frequently 3-gun competitive shooting. The shotgun makes use of a traditional bead sight system, and boasts a longer barrel, conducive to shooting targets at greater distances.  Characteristics  All Beretta 1301 shotguns use cold-hammer-forged barrels with chrome-lining and parkerized external finishes. The frames or \\"receivers\\" are made from aluminum with an anodized finish. The stock and forearm are made from polymer, with a rubberized recoil pad fastened to the rear of the stock. While the barrel lengths differ, the barrel chambers are each capable of accommodating up to 3\\" shotgun shells. Despite this, the Competition receiver is designed around 3.5\\" configuration, whereas the Tactical is designed on a 3\\" receiver. As a result, the barrels are model specific, but neither will fire a shotshell greater than 3\\" in length. With a limiter installed in to the shotgun's magazine, the user may load either one or two rounds in to the tube, or a total of four with the limiter removed. This may be coupled with a fifth round loaded in to the chamber, for a maximum total of five rounds. Models sold in other countries may include a magazine extension, with a 6+1 capacity. However, models manufactured with these tubes are not permitted for sale in many countries, including the United States, due to international restrictions governing the export of firearm related components. If a consumer wishes to extend the magazine on a capacity restricted model, they may rely on aftermarket tube manufacturers.  YouTube commentaries  Many YouTube pundits and reviewers have erroneously characterized a feature of the 1301 as being a \\"fatal flaw\\" in the firearm's design. They reference the bolt release lever, a button alongside the frame of the shotgun that is designed for shotshell loading and extraction. A vocal minority believe that the firearm is prone to prematurely releasing a shotshell from the magazine and inducing a malfunction; however, such a malfunction requires intentional user input and manipulation. Additionally, reviewers neglect to disclose that all Beretta semi-automatics share the same loading and unloading characteristics, and are not prone to malfunctions. Regardless, Beretta Italy responded to this by introducing an updated model in 2018 that requires that the button be pulled, rather than pressed. To satisfy those consumers who purchased early models, a shroud kit was introduced to make the button harder to press.

Ren√© C. J√§ggi was the club's chairman following the annual general meeting the year before. FC Basel played their home games in the St. Jakob Stadium. Following their promotion in the 1993‚Äì94 season this was their fourth consecutive season in the highest tier of Swiss football.  Overview  J√∂rg Berger was appointed as the new trainer at the start of the season, but in October 1997 he was sacked and was replaced by Salvatore Andracchio (ad interim) until Guy Mathez was appointed as trainer from 1 January 1998. The club's priority aim was to remain in the top flight of Swiss football. The club made many new signings as the season started. Amongst these, there were many experienced players, such as Oliver Kreuzer from Bayern Munich, Marco Sas from Bradford City, Maurizio Gaudino from Eintracht Frankfurt, J√ºrgen Hartmann from Hamburger SV and Nestor Subiat from Grasshopper Club. There were also young players such as Marco P√©rez from Vaduz, Jan Berger from Grasshopper Club and Fabinho Santos from Joinville (Brazil) as well as Lu√≠s Calapes and Alexander Frei from the club's own youth section. Many players left the club, under them last season's top scorer Gaetano Giallanza who transferred to Nantes and Jean-Pierre La Placa who signed for Toulouse . The season did not start the way that trainer Berger had hoped. Four of the first six games ended in a defeat, the team conceding 12 goals and scoring just three. Berger was put under pressure by the club's board of directors, but things did not improve. Following another six consecutive defeats Berger was sacked. He was replaced ad interim by Salvatore Andracchio, who had helped out the previous season, and the team managed to improve their results, but could not correct the slip into the Relegation Group. During the winter break and the early part of the spring season the newly signed Nemtsoudis and Subiat left the club and the contract with Sas was dissolved. Under new trainer Mathez it seemed that the team was heading for relegation. A dramatic finish with three straight victories over the three better placed teams Young Boys, SC Kriens and finally Solothurn saved Basel from the relegation drop.  Players  The following is the list of the Basel first team squad. It also includes players that were in the squad the day the season started on 1 5 July 1997 but subsequently left the club after that date.

She published articles and made videos to explore the history and impact of colonialism on her Cura√ßao community .After teaching for over two decades, Henriquez became the director of the Center for the Protection of Women. She worked to alleviate domestic violence and provide educational and employment training for low-income women. She has worked with the National Archives and Museum Tula to develop materials to reclaim the history of Afro- Cura√ßaoans and the African diaspora throughout the Caribbean. She was awarded the Cross of Merit from the Government of Cura√ßao for her activism for women and the Afro-Cura√ßaoan communities. Early life Jeanne Dionise Henriquez was born in 1946 in the neighborhood of Otrobanda in Willemstad, Cura√ßao, which at the time was a part of the Netherlands Antilles, to Carmita Nicolasia (n√©e Hernandez) and Plinio Miguel Henriquez. Her father was an analyst for the laboratory at Shell Oil Company and her mother was a dollmaker, whose designs celebrated the culture of Afro-Cura√ßaoans. Henriquez was the oldest daughter, having younger sisters Renee and Sarah. After completion of her secondary education, she began studying to be a teacher in 1962 in Cura√ßao. In 1967, she moved to Breda in the Netherlands, graduating from normal school in 1968. Continuing her schooling, Henriquez enrolled at the State University of Utrecht, studying socio-economic history. She obtained a master's degree and completed a PhD in 1976 evaluating the social and economic impact of the Atlantic slave trade on the history of Cura√ßao. Career After completing her degree, Henriquez returned to Cura√ßao in 1976 and taught history at the Peter Stuyvesant College, now known as the Kolegio Alejandro Paula, Between 1979 and 1980, she left the school to work as the temporary head of the Central Historical Archives of the Netherlands Antilles. She returned to the high school in 1980 and in 1984, when she was appointed as dean. Simultaneously between 1984 and 1989, Henriquez taught at the Teacher‚Äôs Training School in Willemstad. Influenced by Joceline Clemencia, she wrote several articles during this time on the relationship of the island to the Kingdom of the Netherlands and worked with women living in poverty. She also had a son in 1982, Ray Asim Henriquez, and chose to raise him as a single mother. Henriquez worked on the editorial staff of the Historical Archives of the Netherlands Antilles‚Äô bi-annual journal Lanternu from 1984 to 1987. In the 1980s, she worked as the co-editor for the script on a series of fifteen videos, which aimed to present a balanced assessment on the colonial and post- colonial history of Cura√ßao without the Eurocentric view upon which previous textbooks had focused. After the series was presented, the transcripts were published as books. Henriquez was the head of Peter Stuyvesant College until 1988, when she moved to Washington, D. C. to pursue her master's degree. Taking her son with her to the United States, she enrolled in the women's studies program at George Washington University. While she was in school, she worked in a youth program providing educational materials and information on HIV/AIDS for young adults and then through 1991, worked as an intern in a rape crisis center in Washington. Graduating with a master of arts degree in women's studies in 1991, she returned to Cura√ßao as the director of the Center for the Promotion of Women (Papiamento: Sentro pa Desaroyo di Hende Muh√©, SDHM), where she worked until 1998. At SDHM, Henriquez primarily worked with low-income women, providing training and materials written in Papiamento, the lingua franca of the Netherlands Antilles, on the prevention and crisis intervention for domestic violence. She also provided counseling on education and job opportunities. During her tenure at SDHM, Henriquez published several works focused on women and their lives. Included were testimonies of single mothers in Cura√ßao (1990); a poem Appeal from a Mother (1992); video scripts regarding the lives of working women (1994); and biographies of six female prisoners (1996). In 1998, she left SDHM and headed the public relations for the National Archives of Cura√ßao. In that capacity, she staged an exhibit on one of Cura√ßao's pioneering feminists, Ad√®le Rigaud, in 1999 and expanded the program to then cover other influential feminists. In 2002, she led a cooperative conference with UNESCO on the African diaspora. The conference evaluated new methods to study slavery and its impact for the Caribbean. Henriquez retired in 2004 and worked as an independent historical researcher and consultant for the study of Cura√ßaoan emancipation for two years, volunteering at organizations to combat violence against women. Between 2006 and 2010, Henriquez served at a board member of the Network for Women's Health in Latin America and the Caribbean () and simultaneously from 2009 worked as president of Dedima Foundation, an organization which protects the human rights of Cura√ßao‚Äôs women and children. Between 2005 and 2013, she served as project manager and coordinator of Museum Tula, a former plantation, which bears the name of Tula, who led the Cura√ßao Slave Revolt of 1795. The museum strives to exhibit materials focused on the socio-economic development of not only Afro-Cura√ßaoans but the broader Caribbean region. She worked on projects to collect oral history and published a manual on methodologies of oral history in 2013. That same year, she led a project to reconstruct a slave dwelling for the Museum of Afro-Cura√ßaoan Heritage and assisted with the establishment of the Slavery Heritage Knowledge Centre located at the museum. Henriquez received the Foundation Cultrual Bando Bou Award in 2013 for her work at Museum Tula and was the recipient of the Government of Cura√ßao‚Äôs Cross of Merit in 2015.

The hereditary succession in Maratam was at stake, prompting the VOC to field its own candidates in an attempt to gain more influence in central and eastern Java. At the end of the Javanese Wars of Succession, Mataram was carved into three weak Vorstenlanden (\\"Princely Lands\\"), independent in name only, as a consequence of the divide and rule policy of the VOC.  Overview  The Trunajaya rebellion (1674‚Äì1681) lay the seed for the Javanese Wars of Succession. During this uprising, sultan Amangkurat I of Mataram died in 1677, causing a war of succession to break out between his sons Rahmat (Amangkurat II) and Puger (Pakubuwono I). Puger surrendered in 1681 and recognised his brother as the rightful sultan, but when the latter died in 1703, he disputed his brother's succession by his son Amangkurat III, which led to the First Javanese War of Succession. The three Javanese Wars of Succession were: *First Javanese War of Succession (1703‚Äì1708) *Second Javanese War of Succession (1719‚Äì1722) *Third Javanese War of Succession (1749‚Äì1755) In the aftermath of this divide and rule policy on Java, one further partition of Yogyakarta occurred in 1812, increasing the number of Vorstenlanden to four.Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Vorstenlanden\\". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.  Indonesian nationalism  The most prominent leaders on the Javanese side (Untung Surapati, Hamengkubuwono I) were later elevated to national Indonesian heroes in the 19th and 20th century, preceding the independence struggle of the Republic of Indonesia proclaimed in 1945.

It is the most prestigious award for individual players in the AFLW. It is also widely acknowledged as the highest individual honour in the sport of women's Australian rules football. Criteria=Voting procedure= Erin Phillips was the inaugural winner of the award in 2017, and won it again in 2019. To determine the best player, the three field umpires (not the goal umpires or boundary umpires) confer after each home-and-away match and award three votes, two votes and one vote to the players they regard as the best, second-best and third-best in the match, respectively. On the awards night, the votes from each match are tallied, and the player or players with the highest number of votes is awarded the trophy (subject to eligibility ‚Äì see below). The current voting system, which is the same as that of the Australian Football League (AFL)'s Brownlow Medal, has been used since the award's inception. If two or more eligible players score the equal highest number of votes, each wins a trophy. =Ineligibility= The fairest component of the trophy is achieved by making ineligible any player who is suspended by the AFL Tribunal during the home-and-away season. An ineligible player cannot win the award, regardless of the number of votes she has received. A player remains eligible for the award under the following circumstances: * she is suspended during the finals or pre-season; * she serves a suspension in the current season which carried on from, or was earned for an offence committed in, the previous season; * she receives any sort of club-imposed suspension which is not recognised by the AFL Tribunal; * she is found guilty by the AFL Tribunal of an offence which attracts only a financial penalty. Umpires cast their votes for each game independent of eligibility criteria of the players; i.e. umpires can cast votes for players who have already been suspended during that season if they perceive them to be amongst the best on the ground. Award ceremony Docklands Stadium, current home of the W Awards Night The AFL Women's best and fairest is awarded during the W Awards Night, the official AFL Women's awards ceremony, following the AFL Women's Grand Final. The ceremony itself has become increasingly elaborate, with footballers and their dates gradually becoming more fashion-conscious, however it has a much smaller following in comparison to the Brownlow Medal ceremony. The ceremony is currently held at Docklands Stadium in Melbourne.

It was totally destroyed in 1944 and subsequently rebuilt. History The Benedictine Abbey of the Holy Trinity in Lessay was founded in 1056 by , Baron of La Haye-du-Puits, and his wife Emma,Tome 11 of the Gallia Christiana, p. 917 who deeded all their holdings in the Sainte-Opportune parish to the new monastery. This charter was confirmed in 1080 by Eudes au Capel, Turstin's son and William the Conqueror's seneschal. Duke William and Geoffrey de Montbray, bishop of Coutances, signed the abbey's charter, as did the bishops of Canterbury, York, Bayeux, Winchester, and St. Anselm. Eudes au Capel was buried in Lessay Abbey's choir in 1098. When , Archbishop of Rouen, visited Lessay in 1250, the abbey had 36 monks, had 1,400 livres in its treasury and owed 450 to its creditors. When Riguad visited again in 1266, there were 56 monks, but hostilities with the Kingdom of England had caused the monastery significant privations. In 1337, Lessay's abbot had a parish church independent of the abbey built for Sainte- Opportune parish. The monastery bestowed the townships of Anneville-en-Saire and Bolleville with a trade fair in 1423.

The first 760 mm track-side diesel locomotives of the BD≈Ω were built by the German company Henschel & Sohn of Kassel, and were put into operation in Bulgaria in the beginning of 1966. As soon as they arrived, they became the main narrow-gauge locomotive series at the Septemvri depot, took the passenger (from the series 81 and 82) and the freight (from the 600.76 series locomotives) service on the railway lines Septemvri - Dobrinishte and - Pazardzhik. Moreover, due to the higher power of the locomotives, the trip from Septemvri to Dobrinishte was shortened by more than 1 hour. The locomotives were constructed under the technical conditions of BD≈Ω and consisted mainly of: a diesel engine with a power of 1100 hp, a hydraulic gear and the wheelset formula is B'B'. At their creation (the 1960s), they were the world's most powerful diesel locomotives for the 760 mm gauge. For the first time in Bulgaria the concept of using the cavities in the main locomotive frame for fuel tank was applied. The first scrapped locomotive in the series was 75 007.5, which derailed on January 16, 1991, due to a broken track on the open line to the closed stop \\"Dryanov Dol\\". The damage to the locomotive was not so great to force it to be scrapped, but due to the sufficient number of locomotives it was not required to be recovered quickly. Thus it became a \\"donor\\" for spare parts for the other locomotives of the series and eventually in 1994 it was scrapped.

In 1797, at the age of seventeen, he was commissioned into the Bengal Artillery. On arriving in Bengal that same year he was deployed on a military expedition to the Philippines. When the expedition was abandoned he returned from Penang and served in Allahabad. In 1803 the Second Anglo-Maratha War broke out, and he was present at the battles of Aligarh, Delhi and Laswari. In May 1804 he accompanied a force against Rampoora, and later served at the Battle of Deeg and Siege of Deeg where he was mentioned in dispatches.Vibart, H.M. (1894).

He was the son of Johann Rudolf Huber, a Zurich silk manufacturer and studied mechanical engineering from 1855 at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic Institute in Zurich. In 1858 he received his diploma as an engineer and then supplemented his knowledge at the Conservatoire National des Arts et M√©tiers in Paris. He was also in England for a long time, where he was able to acquire more knowledge.http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D30949.php Career His first employment was with Sulzer Brothers in Winterthur, which was then owned by Charles Brown senior (father of Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown). Afterwards he was able to learn new skills at Escher, Wyss & Cie. in Zurich. In 1863 he established the foundry P. E. Huber & Co. in Oerlikon with the English engineer M. M. Jackson. This business was sold for economic reasons in 1867 to the company Daverio, Siewerdt & Giesker in Rorschach and liquidated in 1872. In 1876, the Oerlikon tool and machine factory was established and Huber-Werdm√ºller was appointed president of the board of directors. He drove forward the development of the operation purposefully, incorporated an electrical department in 1884, and appointed Charles Brown senior as its head. Brown brought his two sons, Charles and Sidney, two outstanding engineers, into the factory. The development of Oerlikon's electrical department had a great impact on technical progress in Switzerland and Europe. In 1886, the discoverer of aluminium fused-salt electrolysis, Paul Louis Toussaint H√©roult, ordered a dynamo machine from Oerlikon and, in 1887, he came to Zurich to make electrolytic tests. Huber-Werdm√ºller, who at an early age recognized the importance of aluminium as a material, saw the immense advantages of H√©roult's method. Together with the entrepreneurial personalities Georg Robert Neher and Gustave Naville, President of Escher, Wyss & Cie. in Zurich, he pushed ahead with his idea of an aluminium factory in Neuhausen am Rheinfall. The Neher family owned the water rights to the Rhine Falls, which were to be used for power generation, and their former ironworks was used for the infrastructure at this location. Oerlikon, which at that time produced the largest direct current generators in the world, installed them for the large-scale production of electricity necessary for the enormous power requirements of the H√©roult process. Escher Wyss & Cie. delivered the water turbines. With other shareholders, the Swiss Metallurgical Society was founded in October 1887, from which the company Aluminium Industrie AG emerged. Oerlikon had exhibits at the International Electrotechnical Exhibition of 1891 in Frankfurt am Main and supplied generators for the three-phase transmission line from Lauffen to Frankfurt. Later, Huber's son-in-law Dietrich Schindler-Huber took over the management of the company.https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/gnd128811625.html#ndbcontent Work in public office As of 1867, Huber's public functions focussed on the development of transport infrastructure in and around Zurich. Starting from the office of the municipal council in the Zurich suburb Riesbach, his birthplace, he sat as a board member of the municipal council and promoted a generous road expansion. He also promoted the construction of a functional quayside on Lake Zurich. As a result of the development of the Seefeld he had to deal with the problems of railway construction and became a member of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Northeast Railway. Huber was significantly involved in the founding of the Uetlibergbahn, where he campaigned, against great resistance, that this route be built as an adhesion railway. Huber was also instrumental in introducing trams to Zurich. Huber was one of the co- founders of the Swiss Electrotechnical Association (SEV) in 1889 and was appointed an honorary member in 1909. Family Huber married Anna Marie Werdm√ºller in 1864. They had two sons, Emil Huber-Stockar and Max Huber, and a daughter, Anna Barbara Huber, who married Dietrich Schindler.

They mark battle sites, partisan camps, prisons and other sites where the occupiers committed atrocities, places where illegal partisan hospitals and printing facilities were located, where resistance couriers crossed traffic routes, and at the sites where historical meetings and other important events took place during the war in Slovenia. Partisan monuments are a part of World War II monuments and memorials. They can be found in the territory where partisan fighting went on, most frequently on the Balkans (i.e., the states of former Yugoslavia) and in Albania. They present a historical cultural specificity of the area. In Slovenia, there are about 6,000 partisan monuments, 2,700 of them are registered in the national registry of cultural heritage (they represent the majority of total 2,900 World War II monuments in Slovenia).World War 2 monuments.

The most frequented regions are Gorenjsko, the wider area of Ljubljana, the Coastland and Carinthia (also on the Slovene ethnic territory beyond the Slovenian borders).Partisan monuments Layer on Geopedia, Slovene open access map. They were erected for various jubilee occasions by local war veteran organizations together with local communities and associations. Among partisan monuments, the gravestones, where the bodies of fallen partisans have been transported after the war, are also listed. The data about death are accompanied by the word padel \\"fallen\\" or ustreljen \\"shot\\". The names of those WW II victims who were executed by partisans accused of the collaboration with the German and Italian occupier and the names of the Slovene soldiers mobilized into the German army, are listed on the parish memorial plaques erected around churches after 1990. Partisan memorials are frequently recognizable by five-pointed stars; on some gravestones there are both ‚Äì a star and a cross together. Commemorative plaques are fastened on the native houses of first partisan fighters from 1941, on the houses from where they left into the woods to join the armed resistance, at the places where they were shot, on the graveyards, at town squares or in memorial parks. A number of them are fastened on the fa√ßades of factories, fire brigades or municipal buildings. At the ruins of burned homes, in front of illegal partisan hospitals and printing facilities, information boards replace memorial plaques. Some 10% of all the partisan monuments have been destroyed due to politically motivated vandalism, being stolen and sold to the color metal merchants or because the buildings where they used to be fixed were pulled down. Some have been renewed, some relocated and some deposited into local museums.

In 1875, it ran between 10 and 20 branches; in 1880, it was the second biggest grocery chain in Britain, with between 40 and 50 branches, just ahead of Thomas Lipton's rapidly expanding empire.Jefferys, James B.

Customers were invited to save the checks until they had acquired enough to claim a prize such as a toy, an item of crockery or a household gadget. The checks are now collectors‚Äô items.

A former Associate Deputy Attorney General and former director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF), as of February 2018 Ohr was working in the Justice Department's Criminal Division. He is an expert on transnational organized crime and has spent most of his career overseeing gang and racketeering-related prosecutions, including Russian organized crime.Adam Goldman & Katie Benner, Bruce Ohr Fought Russian Organized Crime. Now He's a Target of Trump., New York Times (August 27, 2018). Ohr was little-known until 2018, when he became the subject of scrutiny when he was involved in the start of the Russian interference in the 2016 election probe. He was criticized by President Donald Trump, who accused Ohr of abusing his access to sensitive information. No evidence has emerged that Ohr was involved in the initiation of the Russia probe or that Ohr mishandled sensitive information. According to a comprehensive review by ABC News, Ohr \\"had little impact on the FBI‚Äôs growing probe into Trump and his associates.\\" The Department of Justice Inspector General reported that Ohr had made \\"consequential errors in judgment\\" in failing to inform his supervisors about his role in the investigation.Inspector general‚Äôs report on Russia probe: Key takeaways. Politico, December 9, 2019 In September 2020, Ohr retired from his position at DOJ. Education Ohr graduated from Harvard College in 1984 with a degree in physics and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1987.  Career  Ohr worked for a law firm in San Francisco before becoming a career civil servant at the U.S. Department of Justice, ultimately rising to the rank of Associate Deputy Attorney General. He was an assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York from 1991 to 1999, and was head of the office's Violent Gangs Unit before joining the Justice Department's Washington headquarters as the head of the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section of the Criminal Division, where Ohr managed teams investigating and prosecuting crime syndicates in Russia and eastern Europe. In 2006, Ohr was one of a number of U.S. government officials who made the decision to revoke the visa of Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch and Vladimir Putin ally. In 2010, Ohr moved to a new position as counsel for international relations in DOJ's Transnational organized crime and international affairs section. In 2014 he became director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF). In 2014‚Äì2016, Bruce Ohr was involved in a wide‚Äìranging clandestine effort by the U.S. government to recruit Russia's richest men close to Vladimir Putin, such as Oleg Deripaska, as informants for the U.S. government. During this time, Ohr had contacts with the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, whom he had first met in 2007. Steele was also involved in this effort. Steele later authored the Trump‚ÄìRussia dossier in 2016. The New York Times reported that this recruitment effort did not \\"appear to have scored any successes\\"; and in Deripaska's case, Deripaska is said to have even notified the Russian authorities about the American effort to recruit him. Ohr later became associate deputy attorney general, but lost that position in late 2017, although he remained director of OCDETF for a time. Ohr was later demoted by the Department of Justice amid the Senate Intelligence Committee‚Äôs discovery of his meetings with Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson.  Russia probe  Ohr had repeated contacts with FBI agents during the fall and winter of 2016-2017, where he shared information he had received from Steele's dossier research. During this time, Ohr failed to inform his supervisors in the Justice Department of his role, actions which were \\"shocking\\" to Rod Rosenstein when he learned of Ohr's role. Rosenstein stated that Ohr \\"appeared to be serving as an 'intermediary' with Steele\\". The dossier was prepared under a contract to the DNC and the Clinton campaign, by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS. During the 2016 election, Bruce's wife, Nellie Ohr, a Russia specialist, worked for Fusion GPS as an independent contractor. Nellie Ohr, according to a Republican-led investigation, conducted \\"research and analysis\\" of Donald Trump for Fusion GPS. An ABC News report stated that Nellie Ohr \\"was not directly involved in the 'dossier' while she worked for Fusion GPS.\\" Steele had been an official source of intelligence for the FBI in the Russian-interference probe before the election, until he was terminated as a source in November 2016 for unauthorized contacts with the media. Following the election, Steele continued to provide information to Ohr at the Justice Department, who forwarded this information to the FBI. FBI agents interviewed Ohr a dozen times regarding contacts with Steele, recording interviews in classified form \\"302 reports\\". Ohr, himself, also documented the contacts in 63 pages of unclassified notes and emails. Ohr's contacts with Steele were mentioned in the controversial Nunes memo, written by Devin Nunes, chair of the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee, which was released in February 2018. The Nunes memo, which focused on the Justice Department's process for obtaining a FISA warrant to wiretap Trump associate Carter Page in October 2016, said that Ohr was aware of Steele's bias against Trump in September 2016. The memo alleged that Steele's reported bias against Trump was not mentioned in the FISA warrant application and that the FISA court was misled. A competing memo by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee said that the FISA warrant made clear that the Steele dossier was paid opposition research likely intended to discredit the Trump campaign in the 2016 election and that the court was therefore not misled. Ohr documented Steele's opinions on Trump in November 2016 (several weeks after the initial FISA warrant against Page had been approved by the FISA court), saying Steele \\"was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.\\" Ohr was not assigned to work in counterintelligence operations and was not known to be involved in obtaining the FISA warrant. According to BBC News, the fact that Ohr recorded Steele's opinions \\"somewhat [undercuts] the accusation of rampant bias within the department, given that a truly compromised individual wouldn't jot that sort of thing down.\\" In 2018, Ohr became the subject of right-wing conspiracy theories which alleged that he played an important role in starting the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The conspiracy theories allege that the origins of the Russia probe were biased and were intended to undermine then-candidate Trump. President Trump and many Republicans have falsely claimed the Steele dossier was used to start the investigation. But in fact the July 2016 launch of the FBI investigation was triggered, not by the dossier, but by a report that Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos knew, before it became public knowledge, that the Russians possessed damaging information about Hillary Clinton in the form of \\"thousands\\" of stolen emails. This origin of the probe is confirmed in the Nunes memo itself. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has stated that as far as he knew, Ohr was not involved with the Russia investigation, and told the House Judiciary Committee that Ohr had \\"no role\\" in the investigation. The claim that the origins of the Russia probe were tainted is unsubstantiated. The FBI did not publicly reveal the ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign during the campaign, in part so as not to hurt his electoral chances, contradicting the claim that the probe was an attempt to undermine Trump's candidacy. Trump called Ohr a \\"disgrace\\" in a tweet in August 2018 and suggested that he would revoke Ohr's security clearance. There is no publicly available evidence that suggests Ohr mishandled sensitive information. Trump's threat to strip Ohr of his security clearance came amid threats to revoke the security clearances of a number of current and former officials who had criticized Trump or been involved in the Russia probe. According to The Washington Post, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her deputy Bill Shine discussed the best timing to announce the revocations as a way of distracting from unfavorable news cycles. Rep. Jim Jordan, a critic of the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, called for Ohr's firing. On August 28, 2018, Ohr gave testimony in a closed hearing to two Republican-led House committees looking into decisions made by the DOJ ahead of the 2016 presidential election.Mary Clare Jalonick & Eric Tucker, Trump target in Russia probe questioned by Republicans, Associated Press (August 28, 2018).

History Organised systems of posthouses providing swift mounted courier service seems quite ancient, although sources vary as to precisely who initiated the practice. By the time of the Achaemenid Empire, a system of Chapar Khaneh existed along the Royal Road in Persia. The second-century BC Mauryan and Han empires established similar systems in India and China. Suetonius credited Augustus with regularising the Roman network, the cursus publicus. Local officials were obliged to provide couriers who would be responsible for their message's entire course. Locally maintained post houses () privately owned rest houses () were obliged or honored to care for them along their way. Diocletian later established two parallel systems: one providing fresh horses or mules for urgent correspondence and another providing sturdy oxen for bulk shipments.

The Four Swans Inn in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire was one of the original post houses set up in the 1500s where men carrying mail, and later the regular mail coaches, could change horses. It was demolished in the late 1960s to make way for the Pavilion shopping centre and multi storey car park.

It was composed in 1908.  Composition  Though initially it was conceived as Eleven Piano Recital Pieces, one of the pieces was dropped and used as a bagatelle in Bart√≥k's Fourteen Bagatelles. However, he was required by a contractual obligation with his publisher to write eleven pieces, so he wrote a dedication which is not numbered but serves to complement the set. For this reason, this set and his set of bagatelles are related, both in their harmonic and rhythmic styles and in their educational vocation. These works were heavily influenced by Bart√≥k's fascination with folk music and by his admiration to Claude Debussy, who had, by then, made a name for himself. Whereas Fourteen Bagatelles is decidedly more difficult for young pianists, this set was planned to serve as an easy contemporary preparation for students. It is, indeed, being used in the intermediate piano repertoire, together with his other set of short pieces, For Children. The set was published a year later, in 1909, by Rozsnyai K√°roly.  Structure  The set consists of eleven pieces in total, although the initial dedication is not numbered. It has an overall approximate duration of 17 minutes. The movement list is as follows: * Dedication * 1. Peasant Song * 2. Frustration * 3. Slovakian Boys' Dance * 4. Sostenuto * 5. Evening in Transylvania * 6. Hungarian Folksong * 7. Dawn * 8. Slovakian Folksong * 9. Five-Finger Exercise * 10. Bear Dance Bart√≥k makes an extensive use of pentatonic scales, modes, novel harmonies and ostinato. All the pieces have a duration of about one or two minutes. Out of all 11 pieces, only three are based on folk tunes: numbers three, six and eight. The rest of the pieces were created in their entirety by Bart√≥k, who used to make a great number of short pieces for piano using folk- like structures and melodies. The dedication uses material that he associated to his friend, the violinist Stefi Geyer, to whom he dedicated his first violin concerto. The motif in this dedication was thoroughly used both in the concerto and in his Two Portraits, as well as in the last of his Fourteen Bagatelles, all of them written between 1906 and 1908. The set begins with a slow motif in the dedication, consisting of just four notes. After that, the first piece is a very simple melody played in unison, marked allegro moderato. The second piece, alternatively translated as Painful Wrestling, has an ostinato bass line while the melody is being played with the right hand. The third piece, which is an arrangement of a folk tune, already presents some of the elements seen in the previous pieces, both unison and accompaniment. The fourth piece, in turn, becomes a slow tenuto piece where the melody is played with both the left and the right hand, but not in unison. The fifth piece is the longest in the set. Its structure is strictly ABABA, and the melody is played exclusively with the right hand. The sixth, an arrangement of a popular folk song, explores rhythm with both hand and the seventh presents melodies in thirds where harmonies clash constantly. The last arrangement in the set is, again, a tenuto-like piece. Then, the ninth piece is a study to practice scales with all five fingers. Finally, the last piece in the set consists of a well-known melody accompanied by a bouncing note in the bass line. Bart√≥k is known to have played pieces five and ten for recording on November 20, 1929, although it is unknown if he ever recorded himself playing the rest of the pieces. Recording whole compositions used for educational purposes was an uncommon practice at the time, since recording at length was expensive.

Taxonomy and etymology This bat was described in 1906 by Danish mammalogist Knud Andersen. He described it as a subspecies of the Gervais's fruit-eating bat, A. cinereus. The holotype had been collected near Bogot√°, Colombia, undoubtedly inspiring the species name \\"bogotensis.\\" Later, beginning in 1987, the taxon was considered a subspecies of the silver fruit- eating bat, A. glaucus. In 2008, researchers proposed that the Bogota fruit- eating bat should be elevated to species rank. Description It has pale brown fur and distinct white stripes on its face. The length of its head and body is . It lacks a tail. Its hind feet are long; its ears are ; and its forearm is long. It weighs . Biology and ecology This bat is frugivorous. It is bimodally polyestrous, meaning that it has two breeding seasons in a year. These breeding seasons correspond to seasonal fruit abundance. Like many bat species, it is nocturnal, roosting in sheltered places during the day such as caves. Range and habitat It has been documented in several countries in South America, including Colombia, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. It has been recorded at elevations from above sea level. It is often found in montane forests. Conservation It is currently evaluated as least concern by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this designation because it has a large geographic range; it occurs in protected areas; and its population size is not likely declining at a rapid rate. Major threats to this species, if any exist, have not been identified.

Pryse entered the military in 1836, before becoming captain of the Carabiniers (6th Dragoon Guards), and retiring in 1846. From 1857 to 1888, he was also Lord Lieutenant of Cardiganshire. Political career Pryse's father, Pryse Pryse (1777‚Äì1849) and brother, Pryse Loveden (1815‚Äì55) had both served as MP for Cardigan Boroughs. On his brother's death in 1855, Edward Pryse declined to contest the seat and John Lloyd Davies was elected as a rare Conservative MP for the constituency at the ensuing by-election. Pryse entered the political fray in 1857 when he emerged as a Liberal opponent to John Lloyd Davies. Although Pryse had little political experience, his connection with the family based at Gogerddan was considered to be a considerable advantage. Shortly after his candidature was announced, Davies had withdrawn from the contest. Pryse came under scrutiny in 1868 amidst suggestions that he was neglecting his parliamentary duties. His absence from a key debate on the disestablishment of the Irish Church was cited as an example of this. Matters came to a head on 29 May when a Liberal conference was held at Aberaeron to consider the representation of both the borough constituency and the Cardiganshire county seat. An editorial in the Welshman complained that the meeting was instigated by the Liberation Society and that prominent Liberals, including Pryse were not invited. Consideration was given to inviting the sitting member for the county, Sir Thomas Lloyd, who wanted to avoid the financial burden of a contested election, to contest the borough seat in place of Pryse. A few days later, Pryse announced at a meeting in Aberystwyth that he would retire from Parliament at the next election. On 16 June he issued and address announcing his retirement from the Commons. =Later life= In later years, Pryse was out of touch with the radicalism of Cardiganshire Liberalism. However he remained president of the Cardiganshire Liberal Association at the time of his death in 1888. Pryse opposed Gladstone's proposals to disestablish the Irish Church. In 1886, he opposed Gladstone's Home Rule proposals and supported David Davies who stood as a Liberal Unionist candidate for Cardiganshire in 1886. Davies was narrowly defeated and it was a blow to the prestige of the House of Gogerddan that the family had supported a losing candidate. Pryse did, however, invite the winning candidate, Bowen Rowlands, to his home shortly after the election, appointed him a JP for the county and \\"generally accepted the situation with the best grace possible\\". As Lord Lieutenant, Pryse appointed more Liberals as magistrates than generally happened in other counties. At the time of his death the Cambrian News stated that Pryse 'believed it was his right and the right of his class to rule.\\" His death was regarded as the end of an era.

Background  During the Bangladesh Liberation War, Mirpur remained pro-Pakistan. Bengalis living in Mirpur were threatened and attacked by pro- Pakistan Biharis. Bengali poet, Meherunnesa, was killed by the Bihari inhabitants of Mirpur along with her family members. Bangladesh became an independent country on 16 December 1971. Mirpur Thana, mostly inhabited by Biharis, remained under the control of pro-Pakistan paramilitary forces even after the independence of Bangladesh. Many of the inhabitants were members of pro-Pakistan paramilitary forces like the Razakars, Al-Badr, and Al-Shams. They possessed weapons and ammunition, given to them by the Pakistan Army. After the Liberation War ended, Bihari neighborhoods were guarded by Indian Army soldiers. On 30 January 1972, Indian Army personnel were withdrawn, as their guarding of Biharis had become a source of tension between Bangladeshis and Indians.  History  On 30 January 1972, the Bangladesh Armed Forces had surrounded Mirpur and began preparations to \\"liberate Mirpur\\". Bengali filmmaker, Zahir Raihan, went to Mirpur after someone called him about his missing brother, Shahidullah Kaiser, who was previously kidnapped by members of the Al-Badr. Zahir Raihan was never seen again. The soldiers started searching Mirpur and Mohammadpur Thana for weapons and curfew was imposed on the area. Biharis in Mohammadpur had shot at a group of Bengali refugees returning home, wounding 6 and killing one. Gunfights broke out in Mohammadpur and Mirpur between Biharis and soldiers of the Bangladesh Armed Forces. Journalists were not permitted to enter while soldiers searched for weapons. United Nations representative, Vittorio Winspeare-Guicciardi visited the camp, where Biharis asked him to help them move to Pakistan.  Legacy  In Bangladesh, 31 January is marked as Victory Day of Mirpur or Mirpur Mukto Dibosh.

Isabel also participated in the workshops Orlando Gonz√°lez Guti√©rrez, conducted by the Curican poet Juan Jofr√© Bustamante; Huel√©n, by Mart√≠n Cerda and Hern√°n Ortega (1982); and when she was living in Santiago, Espacio, by Osvaldo Ulloa (1990‚Äì1991).

They are: *Proserpinaca intermedia - Uncommon in the southeastern U.S.; intermediate in characteristics, and it is unclear if it is best treated as a hybrid *Proserpinaca palustris - Widespread in eastern North America and the West Indies *Proserpinaca pectinata - Native primarily to the Southeast Coastal Plain, with disjunct populations in middle Tennessee Fossil record 15 fossil fruits of ‚Ä†Proserpinaca ervinii from the early Miocene, have been found in the Kristina Mine at Hr√°dek nad Nisou in North Bohemia, the Czech Republic.A review of the early Miocene Mastixioid flora of the Kristina Mine at Hr√°dek nad Nisou in North Bohemia, The Czech Republic, January 2012 by F.

Today getting to the bottom of this storm-in-a-teacup-style affair seems close to impossible. A Liberal Jos√© Garnica y Diaz recorded a string of 6 electoral victories in the district of Liebana between 1884 and 1899, interrupted only by a 1896 triumph of a Conservative, Santiago L√≥pez y D√≠az. Because of his earlier Carlist background and later Carlist militancy it seems unlikely that Diaz Aguado favored Garnica over L√≥pez. However, there might have been other factors ‚Äì e.g. personal ‚Äì in play, or the letter might have been published due to poor editorial supervision in early 1898 he appeared already as an ex- director.La Atalaya 26.04.98, available here Carlist standard D√≠az Aguado returned to Madrid; it is not clear what he did for a living, but in the early 20th century he was referred to as \\"abogado\\".Las Provincias 29.05.06, available here He started to gain name in religious quasi-political activities. Noted in Congregaci√≥n y Circulo de San Luis Gonzaga, a conservative cultural outpost,El Imparcial 21.03.98, available here he was also busy co-organizing massive pilgrimage to Romeexact date is unclear, but since it was intended as a tribute to pope Leon XIII it must have taken place prior to 1903, Artagan 1912, p. 220 and took part in Catholic congresses in Burgos in 1899 and in Santiago in 1902.Artagan 1912, p. 221 He must have been already active in Carlist structures, as in 1904 he emerged as president of Juventud TradicionalistaArtagan 1912, p. 219, El Correo Espa√±ol 20.03.05, available here and vice-president of Junta Directiva of the Madrid C√≠rculo Tradicionalista.El Dia 17.12.04, available here D√≠az Aguado started to gain recognition as an orator and militant discussant. Reportedly it was thanks to his belligerent harangues that politicians like Salmer√≥n demanded that C√≠rculo San Gonzaga be closed as a centre of subversive propaganda;Artagan 1912, p. 220 in discussion centers like the Madrid Ateneo he clashed with Liberal speakers and personalities like Canalejas recognized him as leader of \\"juventud reaccionaria, pero animosa, vibrante y con fe en un ideal\\".\\"juventud reaccionaria, pero animosa, vibrante y con fe en un ideal, m√°s digna de respeto que otras juventudes de alma muerta\\", quoted after Artagan 1912, p. 221 In 1905 D√≠az Aguado was first noted as engaged in Carlist propaganda activities beyond Madrid, e.g. co-opening a municipal party c√≠rculo in Zaragoza.El Correo Espa√±ol 20.03.05, available here Political climax (1905-1914) as deputy, 1912 In the 1905 electoral campaign to the Cortes D√≠az Aguado stood as a joint Carlist and Liga Catolica candidate in Valencia,Luz Sanfeliu, Republicanas: Identidades de g√©nero en el blasquismo (1895-1910), Valencia 2005, , p. 193 the city he had nothing in common with. The party enjoyed some popularity in the region but remained internally divided and its local jefe, Manuel Polo y Peyrol√≥n, opted rather for the senate. Following a brief campaign D√≠az Aguado lost to the increasingly popular writer and militant republican, V√≠cente Blasco Ibanez; his final result is not known, yet partial data suggests he was not far behind the front-runner.El Correo Espa√±ol 11.09.05, available here The defeat did not adversely affect his party career, as during months to come he remained active during various feasts across the countryfor Bilbao in 1906 see El Correo Espa√±ol 24.08.06, available here and was even elected as honorary president ‚Äì along party pundits like V√°zquez de Mella or Polo y Peyrol√≥n ‚Äì of various provincial Carlist organizations.for Galicia see El Correo Espa√±ol 28.06.06, available here, for Andalusia see El Correo Espa√±ol 14.02.14, available here Prior to the 1907 elections D√≠az Aguado was initially rumored to stand in OviedoEl Porvenir 27.02.07, available here but he eventually fielded his candidature in the Gipuzkoan Tolosa, a district which remained a Carlist fiefdom and where a Carlist candidate was almost guaranteed success. Circumstances of his appointment are not clear and were probably related to the fact that previous Carlist deputy from the district, Julio Urquijo, unexpectedly decided not to run.El Siglo Futuro 15.04.07, available here. D√≠ez Aguado was at the time on good terms with Urquijo, who during his trips abroad used to buy Basque books for him, Bernhard Hurch, Maria Jose Kerejeta, Introducci√≥n, [in:] Hugo Schuchardt - Julio de Urquijo. Correspondencia (1906-1927), Donostia 1997, , p. 11 Indeed, the campaign proved an easy triumph and D√≠az Aguado was elected with 3,105 votes out of 3,107 ballots cast.see his official 1907 Cortes ticket, available here In the subsequent campaign of 1910 he again presented his candidature in Tolosa, where this time no-one dared to challenge the Carlist contender; he was declared victorious with no voting taking place and according to the notorious Article 29 of the electoral legislation.see his official 1910 Cortes ticket, available here It is not clear why he did not run in Tolosa in the campaign of 1914; perhaps he lost his almost-guaranteed place due to electoral haggling between the Carlists, the Integrists and other parties.see Las Provincias 09.03.14, available here He was supposed to stand in Seville, but shortly prior to election date he withdrew,La Epoca 06.03.14, available here never to resume his parliamentarian career again. Carlist rural feast, 1910s The Cortes career or 1907-1914 marked D√≠az Aguado's political climax. As the Carlist contingent remained a minoritarian if not marginal faction in the diet his room for maneuvering was limited, yet he used to take the floor willingly,for a sample of his addresses see El Correo Espa√±ol 21.07.10, available here allegedly recognized as \\"polemista habil√≠simo e incansable, une a su palabre f√°cil, de soberania elocuencia, una cultura y una ilustraci√≥n excepcionales\\".Artagan 1912, p. 222 Some of his motions ‚Äì even if pertaining to marginal issues and eventually defeated ‚Äì took days to discuss.e.g. Cortes for 2 days debated on his motion which protested granting the Italian king a status of honorary colonel in the Spanish army. D√≠az Aguado opposed the project due to perceived hostility of Italian state towards Vatican and considered it an insult to the Spanish nation, Fernando Garc√≠a Sanz, Historia de las relaciones entre Espa√±a e Italia: im√°genes, comercio y pol√≠tica exterior: 1890-1914, Madrid 1994, , p. 396 Political agenda of D√≠az Aguado did not differ from standard Carlist program: he opposed centralization effortsRegina Polo Mart√≠n, Centralizaci√≥n, descentralizaci√≥n y autonom√≠a en la Espa√±a constitucional. Su gestaci√≥n y evoluci√≥n conceptual entre 1808 y 1936, Madrid 2014, p. 237 and championed separate local establishmentse.g. in 1909 he championed petitions of provincial diputaciones in defense of their local rights, Idoia Estorn√©s Zubizarreta, La construcci√≥n de una nacionalidad vasca, Donostia 1990, , p. 82 or confronted secularization drive and espoused the Church,Crist√≥bal Robles Mu√±oz, La Santa Sede y II Rep√∫blica, Madrid 2014, , p. 83 though was involved also in other issues like development of credit and insurance.Ilustriaci√≥n Financiera I/9 (1908), available here He reached top echelons in the party structures; apart from touring the country and speaking at various rallies, in the early 1910s he was nominated to Junta Superior Central, the nationwide Carlist political executive.Agust√≠n Fern√°ndez Escudero, El marqu√©s de Cerralbo (1845‚Äì1922): biograf√≠a politica [PhD thesis Complutense], Madrid 2012, p. 444 He achieved recognized public standing, as Liberal press bothered to mock him in dedicated articles.Gede√≥n 26.05.12, available here 4 Disengagement and re-engagement (1915-1930) Don Jaime, 1918 It seems that in the late 1910s, during mounting conflict between the new claimant Don Jaime and key party theorist Juan V√°zquez de Mella, D√≠az Aguado did not take sides. It was especially so as he lost seat in the party executive, which consisted of MPs and regional leaders only. He was occasionally noted as taking part in Carlist feasts,Diario de Valencia 03.02.15, available here though no longer after 1915. None of the works which discuss internal strife within the movement mentions his name.see Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012 notes him only as elected to Junta Superior in 1912, Juan Ram√≥n de Andr√©s Mart√≠n, El cisma mellista: historia de una ambici√≥n pol√≠tica, Madrid 2000, does not mention him at all Instead he was noted as engaged in initiatives flavored with conservatism yet not clearly defined politically, e.g. in a 1916 Catholic syndicalist rally organized by El Debate.El Correo Espa√±ol 03.12.16, available here When in early 1919 the conflict between de Mella and Don Jaime exploded D√≠az Aguado was not listed as a protagonist. One source claims that he distanced himself from the breakaway Mellistas,Melchor Ferrer, Historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol, vol. 28, Sevilla 1960, p. 194 which is not necessarily tantamount to opting for the orthodox Jaimistas. Most likely he was left politically bewildered; in 1920 he was noted as taking part in a meeting organized by the Ciervistas, an offshoot grouping from disintegrating Conservative Party.La Vanguardia 10.11.20, available here According to one author in the early 1920s D√≠az Aguado withdrew from politics;Ferrer 1960, p. 194 indeed the press did not mention him as engaged in any public activity ‚Äì be it political, quasi- political, religious or cultural ‚Äì either during the last years of liberal democracy or during the Primo de Rivera dictatorship era. He remained involved in business, as in the late Restoration period he was engaged in savings and insurance industry; he entered the board of Sociedad de Ahorro y Previsi√≥n La MundialRevista Ilustrada de Banca, available here and for a few years featured in its adverts.Baleares 28.04.17, available here In the mid-1920s La Mundial grew to one of major insurers on the Spanish market with some 79m pesetas of financial assets, and D√≠az Aguado kept holding major though not specified roles within the company.La Opini√≥n 11.08.26, available here It is not clear whether he practiced as abogado, though it seems he went on with his career in law. In 1925 D√≠az Aguado was recorded as prosecutor serving in Audiencia de Alcal√° de Henares and was probably related to fighting juvenile crime, as he supervised operations of the local Escuela Industrial de Jovenes Deliquentes.El Siglo Futuro 20.05.25, available here Carlist rural feast, 1930 D√≠az Aguado resumed his Carlist activities shortly after the fall of Primo de Rivera, taking advantage of political thaw of the Dictablanda. Since early spring of 1930 he started frequenting the Madrid c√≠rculo associated with El Cruzado Espa√±ol and was recorded as one of its more prominent speakers.El Cruzado Espa√±ol 09.05.30, available here In the summer and fall his propaganda engagements got increasingly frequent, as he spoke in closed-door meetings and open rallies in MadridEl Cruzado Espa√±ol 01.08.30, available here but also in VascongadasEl Cruzado Espa√±ol 17.10.30, available here or Catalonia,El Cruzado Espa√±ol 14.11.30, available here often seated next to party heavyweights like its Jef√© Delegado marqu√©s de Villores.El Cruzado Espa√±ol 19.09.30, available here Since campaign prior to local elections gained momentum in early 1931, D√≠az Aguado threw himself into monarchist and Right-wing propaganda;Heraldo de Castell√≥n 08.04.31, available here as pro-Republican feelings were running high he did not hesitate to pronounce that if indeed a republic was to triumph, it \\"would be a parenthesis, a meteor, an ephemerical being.\\"Heraldo de Castell√≥n 11.04.31, available here Republic, war and Francoism (1931-1942) speaking, 1936 In 1931 D√≠az Aguado was rumored to stand as Jaimista candidate for the Cortes in √Ålava;Ahora 11.06.31, available here scholars claim he was rather to stand in Vizcaya or Gipuzkoa. However, the Jaimista electoral partners from PNV demanded that candidates running in Vascongadas be Basques.Estorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, pp. 496-497 This condition ousted D√≠az Aguado, who eventually competed individually in Valencia and lost miserably.he gained some 11,000 votes compared to 40-50,000 votes gathered by victorious candidates, La Correspondencia de Valencia 01.06.31, available here He kept attending Traditionalist rallies as a speaker, touring the country from NavarreEstorn√©s Zubizarreta 1990, p. 456 to Andalusia.Alfonso Braojos Garrido, Tradicionalismo y antimasoner√≠a en la Sevilla de la II Rep√∫blica.

None of the sources consulted notes whether D√≠az Aguado was engaged in Carlist anti-Republican conspiracy. During the July coup D√≠az Aguado was in Madrid and remained trapped in the Republican-held capital. No details about his fate are available. He spent the entire Civil War in Madrid,Pensamiento Alaves 30.03.40, available here reportedly detainedABC 28.04.42, available here, and maltreated by the Republican counter-espionage agency, SIM.Pensamiento Alaves 30.03.40, available here The detention might have been related to his role in Socorro Blanco, an underground Carlist relief and mutual assistance organisation active in the Republican Madrid; according to later press notes he headed the group after its original leader, Pascual Cebollada, had been arrested.Pensamiento Alaves 27.04.39, available here. The information is not confirmed and the source is not entirely trustworthy, e.g. the newspaper distorted the name of his reported predecessor, Pascual Cebollada Garc√≠a, as \\"Cebolleda\\" Scholarly works dedicated to wartime Madrid do not mention D√≠az Aguado as head of Socorro Blanco though they note some members of the Aguado family engaged in other Fifth Column activities.see e.g. frequent references to Luis Rodriguez Aguado and his \\"Organisaci√≥n Rodriguez Aguado\\" in Javier Cervera Gil, Violencia pol√≠tica y acci√≥n clandestina: la retaguardia de Madrid en Guerra (1936-1939) [PhD thesis Complutense], Madrid 2002 Carlists at Francoist rally, 1942 Following the Nationalist takeover of the capital in 1939 he was recorded as taking part in homages to the Carlist dead and other funerals.ABC 19.08.39, available here.html also ABC 19.11.39, availaleble here It seems that he briefly resumed his earlier duties in juridical system and related to fighting juvenile crime, as in the very early 1940s he was nominated inspector nacional del Impuesto of Consejo Superior de Protecci√≥n de Menores.ABC 10.05.42, available here He resumed Carlist activities and remained loyal to the leadership of Manuel Fal Conde; on his behalf D√≠az Aguado used to chair sessions of the Carlist executive, though as an honorary president rather as a political protagonist.Manuel de Santa Cruz, Apuntes y documentos para la historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol, vol. 2, Madrid 1940, p. 26 Despite his loyalty to Fal, he seemed somewhat uneasy about the regency of Don Javier and the Borb√≥n-Parmas as would-be Carlist successors to the throne.D√≠az Aguado considered the Borb√≥n-Parmas the Frenchmen, Manuel de Santa Cruz, Apuntes y documentos para la historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol, vol. 4, Madrid 1942, p. 190 The funeral of D√≠az Aguado turned into a pompous ceremony, attended by minister of justice, minister of defense, jefe de la casa civil of Franco and the mayor of Madrid.ABC 29.04.42, available here See also * Traditionalism (Spain) * Carlism * La Atalaya * Electoral Carlism (Restoration) * Electoral Carlism (Second Republic) NotesFurther reading * B. de Artagan [Reynaldo Brea], Pol√≠ticos del carlismo, Barcelona 1912 External links * Rafael Diaz Aguado at the official Cortes service * Rafael D√≠az-Aguado at Au√±amendi Eusko Entziklopedia service * Por Dios y por Espa√±a; contemporary Carlist propaganda Carlists People from Pamplona Spanish anti-communists Spanish journalists Spanish lawyers Members of the Congress of Deputies (Spain) Spanish monarchists Spanish money managers Spanish newspaper editors Spanish people of the Spanish Civil War (National faction) Spanish prisoners and detainees Spanish prosecutors Spanish publishers (people) Spanish Roman Catholics 1870 births 1942 deaths Navarrese politicians ","title":"Rafael D√≠az Aguado Salaberry"},{"id":"56487476","text":"Palorus ratzeburgii, the small-eyed flour beetle, is a species of darkling beetle in the family Tenebrionidae.Bousquet Y, Thomas DB, Bouchard P, Smith AD, Aalbu RL, Johnston AM, Steiner WE Jr (2018). \\"Catalogue of Tenebrionidae (Coleoptera) of North America\\".

Early and personal life  Huntley's first name was chosen from a combination of her mother reading a novel where the lead had this name (A Sparrow Falls by Wilbur Smith) and an electrical storm outside on the day she was born. Her grandmother refused to use this name for some time. As a toddler, she accidentally poured a kettle of boiling water over herself, causing permanent scarring to her arm, shoulder and neck; she chooses clothing to conceal the scars. Raised in Bishopbriggs in the northern part of Greater Glasgow, she attended Bishopbriggs High School before taking a degree in politics and economics from the University of Glasgow in 2008. She became involved in the university station's Subcity Radio as well as hospital radio, spent time in London with a local community radio company (OnFM) and took a postgraduate diploma in broadcast journalism from the London College of Printing. Television career After a period of unpaid work experience, she found work as a researcher with BBC Scotland, became increasingly interested in weather reporting and took a short meteorology course with the Open University. In June 2014 Huntley joined Scottish Television's new regional STV Glasgow channel, presenting weather forecasts and features on its evening daily Riverside Show. =Current work= Since 2015, Huntley has been involved in two shows on British terrestrial television - the seasonal CBeebies show Down on the Farm and The Wright Stuff/Jeremy Vine.

The episode was a commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the program's debut in January 1993. The event was held in two separate venues in New York City ‚Äì the Barclays Center in Brooklyn and the Manhattan Center Grand Ballroom in Manhattan, the latter of which hosted the first episode of Raw. The show featured appearances from various Hall of Famers and legends from the past.  Background  The card consisted of nine matches, including four dark matches, that resulted from scripted storylines and had results predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands. Storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw, SmackDown Live, and 205 Live, the latter of which is cruiserweight-exclusive. Raw first aired on January 11, 1993, and since became the longest-running weekly episodic program in television history with no reruns. On October 30, 2017, WWE announced that Raw would celebrate its 25 anniversary on January 22, 2018.  Event = Dark matches = Before and during the event, there were a series of untelevised matches for the live crowds in attendance. The first match in the Barclays Center saw Goldust defeat Curt Hawkins and later Gran Metalik and Kalisto defeat Gentleman Jack Gallagher and TJP. The Manhattan Center saw two cruiserweight matches with Mustafa Ali defeating Lince Dorado and Akira Tozawa and Hideo Itami defeating Drew Gulak and Tony Nese. The matches from the Barclays Center were later shown on WWE Main Event. = Preliminary matches = The event opened in the Barclays Center with Vince McMahon and his children Stephanie and Shane celebrating the 25th anniversary of Raw. Later in the segment, Hall of Famer Stone Cold Steve Austin appeared to attack both Shane and Vince with Stone Cold Stunners. In the first televised match at the Barclays Center, Asuka, Bayley, Mickie James, and Sasha Banks faced Mandy Rose, Sonya Deville, Alicia Fox, and Nia Jax. Banks forced Fox to submit to the Banks Statement for the win. After the match, Asuka threw her partners over the top rope, symbolizing eliminating them in the upcoming Royal Rumble match. Later a segment occurred in which Raw General Manager Kurt Angle interacted with various WWE legends, including Jonathan Coachman, Harvey Wippleman, The Brooklyn Brawler, Teddy Long, Brother Love, and The Boogeyman. In the second match, Roman Reigns defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against The Miz. After Reigns collided with an exposed turnbuckle, The Miz executed the Skull Crushing Finale to win the title for the eighth time in his career. The event opened in the Manhattan Center with a segment featuring The Undertaker. In the first match at the Manhattan Center, Bray Wyatt defeated \\"Woken\\" Matt Hardy after executing a Sister Abigail. After the match in a non-televised segment, Jeff Hardy appeared and said that Wyatt will soon be \\"classified as obsolete.\\" Back in the Barclays Center, Chris Jericho made a special appearance, putting Elias on the \\"List of Jericho.\\" Shortly after, Elias was interrupted by John Cena during his musical performance, which led to Elias attacking Cena with a low blow and then hitting him with his guitar. =Main event matches= The main event at the Barclays Center was a tag team match, which saw Heath Slater and Rhyno fight Titus Worldwide (Titus O'Neil and Apollo Crews) to a no contest. Following the match, The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) appeared, with the duo attacking Slater with the Whassup? before putting him through a table with the 3D. Later at the Manhattan Center, D-Generation X (X-Pac, Shawn Michaels, Triple H, and The New Age Outlaws), Razor Ramon, and B√°lor Club (Finn B√°lor, Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson) appeared in the ring to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Raw and to exchange \\"Too Sweets\\" before being interrupted by The Revival (Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson). The interruption led to a tag match between Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson and The Revival, which saw Gallows and Anderson emerge victorious after performing the Magic Killer on Dash Wilder. After the match in a non-televised segment, The Miz appeared and insulted D-Generation X, causing Raw Tag Team Champion Seth Rollins to interrupt and attack The Miz with a curb stomp. The show concluded with a segment from the Barclays Center, which saw Braun Strowman, Kane, and WWE Universal Champion Brock Lesnar brawl. The three wrestlers fought until Strowman put Lesnar through the announcers table with a running powerslam.  Reception  Raw 25 Years received mixed to negative reviews and reactions from critics and WWE fans. The Undertaker's segment in particular was criticized, being said to have \\"made no sense\\" and been \\"too cryptic.\\" Those who attended the event live, particularly those who attended the Manhattan Center portion, were disappointed by what was described as WWE's \\"poor planning\\" of the event. The venue in Manhattan was said to have not provided adequate screens for attendees to watch the portion of the event happening at Brooklyn's Barclays Center, resulting in extra downtime for the live crowd. Although WWE scheduled several non-televised matches at the Manhattan Center, fans became upset with the event and chanted profanities and called for refunds.  Aftermath  Hours prior to the event then-WWE Cruiserweight Champion Enzo Amore was suspended due to a violation of WWE's zero tolerance policy regarding matters involving sexual harassment and sexual assault. WWE released a statement indicating he would remain suspended \\"until the matter [was] resolved.\\" 15 minutes after the show ended, Amore was released by WWE and the Cruiserweight Championship was vacated. The following day on 205 Live, SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan announced that Amore was no longer part of the 205 Live roster and that the show would receive a new on-screen general manager, which later revealed to be Drake Maverick, previously known as Rockstar Spud in Impact Wrestling. Maverick announced a 16-man tournament to crown a new champion with the finals being held at WrestleMania 34. The tournament and title would be won by Cedric Alexander.

In 1944 a sub-project was set up, to give small ships, including destroyers, 3.7 cm Flak M42 anti-aircraft guns. In mid‚Äì1941, the decision was made to upgrade existing guns to either or guns. The decision was made to use the 5.5 cm Flak Ger√§t 58 anti-aircraft guns, which were in development, and which were to be able to fire at a rate of either 120 or 150 rounds per minute, and to be capable of single shot fire. It was to be gas operated and able to work on a triaxial or quad-axial mount. This project never reached fruition, and no guns of the type were ever mounted.

These acts are punishable by law, including a fine of more than $500 or a jail sentence of up to a year for customers of prostitution. Prostitution occurs in bars and nightclubs, and in boats moored in the harbours. W. Somerset Maugham's short story Rain about a missionary trying to get a prostitute to give up her ways is based on Maugham's visit to American Samoa's capital Pago Pago in 1916.Page 244 Samuel J. Rogal, A William Somerset Maugham Encyclopedia. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. Legislation Although an Unincorporated territory of the United States, American Samoa is self-governing and has its own laws. Chapter 37 of Title 46 (Criminal Justice) of the American Samoa Code legislates against prostitution and related activities: * 46.3701 Definitions. (defines terms used in the legislation) * 46.3702 Prostitution. (criminalises the act of prostitution) * 46.3703 Patronizing prostitution. (criminalises purchase of sex) * 46.3704 Prostitution and patronizing prostitution - Sex of parties no defense (makes offences gender neutral) * 46.3705 Promoting prostitution in the first degree. (criminalises forced prostitution and child prostitution) * 46.3706 Promoting prostitution in the second degree. (criminalises pimping, procuring and brothel keeping) * 46.3707 Prostitution houses considered public nuisances. (gives courts the power to close premises used for prostitution for up to a year) Sex trafficking Young women from nearby Samoa are brought to the island, often through family connections, for domestic chores and are subsequently subjected to sex trafficking. In 2007, five Chinese nationals were jailed for trafficking Chinese women into the country to work as prostitutes in bars and nightclubs. The two ringleaders were sentenced to 62 and 63 months imprisonment. The victims had their passports taken away, weren't paid, and weren't allowed to leave until they had paid off their ever- increasing debts. Law enforcement officers raided the U.S. territory's Office of Immigration in January 2010. It was alleged that in the previous 6 months immigration officials had waived through trafficking victims without performing the required checks on people entering the country. Possibly hundreds of victims were brought through in this manner during the period. The women being used by a prostitution ring. The Government of American Samoa introduced specific law to combat human trafficking. The legislation was further strengthened in 2014.

She has taught at the University of Southern California in the Gender Studies and Anthropology departments since 1999. She is recognised as being a world leading expert in bonobo studies.  Education  Parish completed an undergraduate degree at the University of Michigan in 1989. She received her Masters of Science from the University of California-Davis in 1990, where she completed her PhD. Her dissertation focussed on sociosexual behaviour and the female-female relationships of bonobos, under the supervision of Sarah Blaffer Hrdy.  Research  After graduating UCD, Parish moved to University College London, where she worked with Volker Sommer on behavioural patterns of animals. During this time Parish became an expert on bonobos. Whilst studying bonobos at San Diego's Wild Animal Park, she demonstrated a distinct preference of bonobo females for each other's company. Parish moved to the University of Giessen in Germany, where she focussed on reciprocity. Parish uses an evolutionary approach to understand human behaviour. In 1999 Parish joined the University of Southern California. At USC she has taught eighteen different topics in across a range of disciplines, including Anthropology, Gender Studies, Arts and Letters, Health and Humanities, School of Education, Psychology. She taught a course on \\"love, marriage and the experience of being a wife and on the cultural impact of Darwin‚Äôs theories\\". In 2012 she gave a talk at the Natural History Museum, where she revealed \\"bonobos have more sex, in more ways, and for more reasons, than most humans can imagine\\". Whilst at Wilhelma, a zoo in Stuttgart, she observed \\"two females attack a male at the Stuttgart Zoo in Germany and bit his penis in half\\". In 2013 Parish spoke at World Vasectomy Day about the Evolution of Contraception. In 2016 she gave a keynote talk at the In2In Thinking Forum, \\"Apes, Power, and Sex: Why We Make War Not Love\\". Alongside research, Parish teaches English at La Jolla Country Day School.  Darwinian feminism  For centuries, the mainly male evolutionary scientists overlooked the significance of female animals behaviour; treating it as a passive constant in a drama dominated by aggressive males. Darwinian Feminism began when Parish and her then supervisor, Sarah Hrdy, began to reevaluate animal behavior. Their goal has been simple; to pay equal attention to male and female interests. In Bonobos, Parish found a matriarchal society, which she thinks \\"should give hope to the human feminist movement\\". Parish was featured in Angela Saini's 2017 book Inferior: How Science Got Women Wrong and the New Research That‚Äôs Rewriting the Story. Parish has been featured in Ms Magazine, as well as on the television Nova, National Geographic Explorer and Discovery Channel. Her research formed part of the PBS evolution library for teachers and students. She regularly gives public talks about her research. Parish is a fellow of the Los Angeles Institute for the Humanities. She is on the board of the Kids Eco Club. She is the scientific advisor for the Bonobo Conservation Initiative.

The company develops and maintains a popular Influencer Marketing link sharing platform. As of 2016 the company has been a subsidiary of Google, grouped under their YouTube division.  History =Early Beginnings= FameBit was formed in 2013 by high school friends Agnes Kozera, and David Kierzkowski. Kierzkowski had previously co-founded the digital marketing platform, TapClicks, but was wishing to create something more interactive. He was approached by Kozera who was the founder of SeasonsBox, a subscription based gift delivery service, who had been able to perform the majority of her companies advertising through the use of social influencers. The two combined their knowledge to develop FameBit, an interactive link sharing platform that allowed companies to post offers for influencers, and for influencers to search and apply. On September 16, 2013 FameBit received its first round of seed funding from venture companies ‚Äú500 Startups‚Äù & ‚ÄúHighlineVC.‚Äù Following their initial round of funding, Famebit was one of 4 companies invited to the New York Extreme Startups investor convention. In February 2014 FameBit was one of two Canadian based companies, out of over 1,000 applicants, accepted into ‚Äú500 Startups‚Äù venture fund. In September 2014 FameBit received 1.5million in additional seed funding from DeNA, Third Wave Digital, and Science Ventures. =Growth & Success= By 2015 FameBit had signed up over 9,000 YouTubers, and had run over 1600 campaigns for more than 1200 brands. At the time the average subscriber count for a FameBit Influencer was 46,000. By the end of the 2015 that number had risen to 21,000 across 6 social media platforms (Vine, Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram, & YouTube) By 2016 FameBit had helped in the creation of over 25,000 branded videos, with and estimated 2 billion minutes of viewing time. =Acquisition by YouTube= On October 11, 2016, Google acquires Famebit, for initially an undisclosed amount, but was later revealed to be 36 million dollars. At the time of purchase it was stated that FameBit had over 50,000 creators registered on the platform. Google planned to merge the platform within their YouTube division. Since being acquired by Google, FameBit has mostly operated without change. The only major visual change made to FameBit's product was an implementation that allows marketers to retarget videos made on FameBit to viewers via Google's Ads. In January 2018 YouTube announced it was going to demonetize smaller YouTube channels, however, smaller channels will continue to be able to monetize off of the FameBit platform. Business Model Unlike other influencer platforms, FameBit is not subscription based, instead it is free to sign-up, and the company receives 10% of the transaction fees between Influencer & Brands. FameBit's basic business plan allows brands to post products, and have YouTube content creators to produce content advertising those products for a negotiable fee. FameBit refers to this business strategy as ‚ÄúThe Bounty Model‚Äù Product FameBit offers an online marketing platform that allows brands to post offers to advertise their products on specific social media platforms. Content creators can log into the platform, browse offers, and then negotiate their prices. The platform is free to sign-up, w/ FameBit taking a percentage of the transaction fee between brand and influencer.  Controversy  FameBit has been criticized by brands for allowing YouTubers to join without verifying their followers. FameBit has also been criticized by Content Creators for banning them from the platform due to brand disputes. Several employees have claimed that FameBit promotes a toxic work environment, with 3 out of 4 of their glass door reviews awarding the company 1 star.

Archaeological activity  Archaeological activities started after a member of Fundaci√≥n Instituto de Investigaci√≥n y Evoluci√≥n Humana (FIPEH) found archaeological remains suggesting the presence of a potential archaeological site in the area. In 2015, FIPEH carries out the first archaeological campaign resulting in the finding of more than 600 pieces of archaeological material, mainly lithic tools, belonging to Mousterian culture. These pieces place the Cueva de Bedmar in the Middle Paleolithic. The numerous lithic remain leads to hypothesis that this site was exclusively dedicated to flint knapping. During the summer of 2016, a new excavating area within the complex of Cueva de Bedmar, named as ‚ÄòCueva del Portillo‚Äô, is opened. The work done during this campaign allowed to increase the number of archaeological pieces up to about 2500. There are two findings that stand out from all these pieces: two shell made necklaces, one of them complete. The hitherto amount of evidences collected, although currently under study, allows researchers to establish four different levels: the upper most level corresponds to the Neolithic period, where there is presence of ground stones and pottery. The second level belongs to the Upper Paleolithic whose relative datation is 13000 years. In this level, there are lithic tools, and this is the level where the completed necklace was found. The third level relates to Magdalenian culture and it is where the second necklace appeared. Here, there are evidences of occupation and several remains of hearths.

He was a left-handed pitcher for the Trinity College (now Duke University) baseball team in the Deadball Era. Bradsher was most notable for his 582 strikeouts, 15 shutouts, and five no- hitters achieved during his college career between 1901 and 1905. Early years Bradsher was born on January 17, 1883 in Roxboro, North Carolina. His father Charles E. Bradsher was a doctor, and died when Arthur was just four years old. His mother Nancy Malone married O. T. Carver after Charles died. Trinity College Bradsher attended Trinity College from 1901 to 1905 and graduated cum laude. He received his master's degree in 1905. His thesis was entitled \\"Growing tobacco in the State of North Carolina.\\" He was a member of Alpha Tau Omega. =Tombs= In 1903, Bradsher was the principal founder of the Tombs, one of the strongest organizations on the Trinity/Duke campus from 1903 to 1942. Its purpose was to promote Varsity and intramural athletics and to improve team sportsmanship and school spirit. Another objective was to firmly cement relations between Trinity and other schools in the field of sports. The Tombs morphed into the Varsity Club in 1945. It combined the strengths from both organizations. Bradsher returned to the campus often to council the Tombs organization. =Baseball= Bradsher lettered five times at Trinity.

The first was a nineteen-strikeout no-hitter against Wake Forest. He one-hit Guilford two days later, and carried a no-hitter into the ninth inning three days later again against Wake Forest. 1903 His pitching record for his sophomore season was 7‚Äì2‚Äì1. In the 4‚Äì4 tie against Mercer he was called on for the only relief appearance of his career. He pitched six perfect no-hit innings striking out twelve Mercer batters. The game was called for darkness after twelve innings. Bradsher also led the Trinity team with a .354 batting average in 1903. 1904 After beginning the 1904 season pitching two no-hitters and on his way to a third, Bradsher took himself out with a cut finger in the eighth inning against Guilford.

His WHIP average was 0.395. The four walks in 129 innings and in fourteen complete games is a record that still stands. 1905 1905 Team In 1905, Bradsher missed a perfect game against Mercer due to a miscue by his shortstop in the second inning of his no-hit, no walk, ten inning performance. His twenty-two strikeouts in the game was a record that stood until 1965. The game of the year was the loss to Georgia Tech and pitcher Craig Day (dubbed \\"the greatest game played in Dixie\\" until the 1908 Nashville-New Orleans game). John Heisman nicknamed Bradsher ‚ÄúKing of the Southern Diamond.‚Äù Heisman chose Bradsher as his premier player and captain for his All-Southern team. Heisman was quoted in the Atlanta Constitution: ‚ÄúThis young man is beyond all questioning the most prominent player of the season. With most extraordinary ability as pitcher, he combines the advantages of being a good batter and base runner...And, I would have him captain of my team. He has the bearing of a gentleman, the forbearance of a true sportsman, and the ideal temperament of the fighting athlete, ever determined, never dismayed, always strong with a persistent smile to help out. As a captain, he would be a credit and ornament to any team.‚Äù Records Bradsher struck out 15 batters on 10 occasions. Seven times he went to the mound and pitched no-hit ball. Five of those appearances were complete games. Bradsher holds 11 single season Duke pitching records: Most strikeouts in a single season (171), most wins in a single season (13), most innings pitched in a season (134), most games started (14), most complete games in a season (14), least hits given up per 9 innings (2.34), least walks per 9 innings (0.29), strikeout to walk ratio (42.75), whip (0.395), shutouts (5), and lowest ERA (0.0746).

It was launched on 6 February 2018 and was owned by Sony Pictures Television. It aired crime programming targeted at a female audience. History Sony Crime Channel launched in February 2018, replacing the original Sony Channel on all platforms, including Freeview and Freesat. At time of launch, it broadcast a range of crime dramas, including the free-to-air premiere of Orange Is the New Black as well as reruns of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and Hustle. In June 2019, ultimately due to low ratings, Sony announced that the channel would be downgraded, reducing its output to reality crime programming, akin to its now defunct sister channels True Crime and TruTV. Prior to these changes, a month earlier, the channel was withdrawn from Freesat and was moved to the G-MAN multiplex on Freeview, reducing availability to Manchester only and moved to channel 60. Additionally, its broadcast hours were cut down to 4:00 - 6:00 and its +1 service was replaced by Movies4Men +1. These Freeview changes occurred as a result of True Entertainment and True Movies moving to the local multiplex. In September 2019, as part of a revamp of Sony's entertainment portfolio in the UK, Sony Crime Channel was the only channel without any sign of change. The channel swapped places with True Entertainment on Sky prior to Sony Channel's re-launch in the UK. The channel was replaced by Sony Channel +1 on Freeview, and at the end of the following month, Sony Crime Channel +1 closed on Sky. The channel abruptly closed on 9 June 2020.

It was painted in 1488-1490 by the Italian painter Andrea Mantegna and is now in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. It is named after a stone quarry in the right-hand background, where workers are carving out a capital, a slab, part of a column shaft and a sarcophagus, perhaps alluding to Christ future flagellation and burial. The rock on which the Virgin sits may also be intended to represent the summit of Calvary,Camesasca, cit., pag. 380. whilst in the left-hand background are a shepherd and his flock, farmers gathering hay from a field, a castle and a road leading to a distant walled city. Fiocco argues that the background is based on Carrara whilst Kristeller instead identifies it with Monte Bolca between Vicenza and Verona. Some interpret the shift from dark to light moving from right to left across the background as an allegory of redemption through Christ and the Church, with Mary as the mother of both.Hartt Dating Its dating to 1488‚Äì1490 is based on Giorgio Vasari's description of Francesco I de' Medici's collections, which attributes it to Mantegna's time in Rome. Some have linked it to a work commissioned from Mantegna by Lorenzo de' Medici and mentioned in a letter from Lorenzo. Other historians date it differently due to its style and figuration. However, Mantegna's re-use of certain themes like rocky backgrounds throughout his career makes it difficult to date uncertain works definitively.

He is believed to have been born c. 1346, and in office from 27 January 1373 to possibly 1400, although the precise date of his departure is unknown. One of the earliest mentions of him as Abbot is 1373, when he received the homage of Robert Grosvenor for the manor of Lostock. He witnessed a charter between the prior of the Augustinian hermits in Warrington and the convent there in 1379. A few years later, Abbot Stephen provided evidence for the Royal Commission that was enquiring into the case of Scrope v Grosvenor, which sat for three years, concluding its business in 1389. He seems, though, to have more-than-occasionally been on the other side of the law: Soon after his election as Abbot, in 1375, he was involved in violent fighting with the Bulkeley family of Cheadle, and in 1394, he gave sanctuary to a man already convicted of the murder of member of the Bostock family. He was also regularly accused of preventing the arrest or prosecution of members of his own household or Abbey when they were accused of offences as well as taking bribes to allow prisoners to escape. Further, he was accused‚Äîon what appears to be a fairly regular basis‚Äîof cutting down trees and selling the timber, to the detriment of the local forests. Not only was he accused of damaging the forests, however, but in 1395 an inquisition into the state of the Abbey and its estates concluded that over the previous yen years, Stephen had greatly impoverished the institution by selling, alienating, and generally destroying much of the Abbey's Darnhall estates. One particularly notorious incident occurred that same year when Vale Royal was expecting a visitation from the Abbots of Oxford, Croxden, and Dieulacres. They were attacked by a mob composed not only of vengeful members of the Bostock family, but also, two of Vale Royal's own monks. The latter were later accused respectively of theft and of rape. Abbot Stephen was also performed royal service when required. He was a collector of the parliamentary subsidy of 1401 for King Henry IV; there appear to have been concerns of irregularities surrounding his activities on that occasion, as, fourteen years later, he received a royal pardon from Henry V. Abbot Stephen was involved in much litigation, having, for example, two cases on hand simultaneously regarding the manor of Kirkham, Lancashire, in 1401. Although he is known to have taken office in 1373, the date he lost it is unknown, except that it was before May 1415, when he received his pardon, as the document describes him as being the \\"late\\" abbot. He seems, a recent study concluded, \\"to have been incapable of managing the finances of the house or of maintaining internal discipline.\\" NotesReferences=Sources=  14th-century English people Abbots of Vale Royal Abbey ","title":"Stephen, Abbot of Vale Royal"},{"id":"56487995","text":"Saint George is a 66 by 32 cm tempera on panel painting by Andrea Mantegna, dated to around 1460 and now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice.Ettore Camesasca, Mantegna, in AA.VV., Pittori del Rinascimento, Scala, Firenze 2007.

There is a marble border down the left and right hand sides of the painting, though George's elbow protrudes over the left hand border and the dragon's head over the right-hand border - such illusions were a signature trait of Mantegna's work, especially between the end of his Paduan period (by 1459) and the start of his time in Mantua (from 1460).

Composition  There is much speculation about when the set was composed, but some of the most reliable sources point to it being composed somewhere between 1914 and 1918, in a period where Bart√≥k felt very fascinated with folk music from Romania and his native Hungary. Many of the small compositions he wrote when collecting folk music all around these countries was either lost or revamped into later works, and some would never see the light of publication. This set was presumably revised three decades later, between 1941 and 1942. After moving to the United States, Bart√≥k lived in near-poverty, due to the lack of money his music could make him. However, one of his main sources of income was to publish old manuscripts. The set was published by Boosey & Hawkes in 1942.  Structure  The set consists of three short folk tunes. It has a duration of 4 minutes, each movement lasting for about 1 minute. The movement list is as follows: This composition was also presumably arranged for recorder and piano by Bart√≥k himself.

They were championed by Jane Jacobs and intended to be built on a human scale in keeping with her ideals.  History  The houses are scattered in an area bounded by Morton, West, Bank and Washington Streets. New York Mayor Wagner planned to redevelop that area with high rise housing. West Village resident Jane Jacobs lead an effort to stop that development in favor of the West Village Houses which were smaller-scale and preserved existing structures. Perkins and Will designed the buildings. The effort to build the houses was finally approved in 1969, higher costs required a second approval in 1972 and then construction began. Because of their long construction during a period of high inflation, when they were completed in 1975 common charges for prospective residents were high, they had difficulty finding residents and required further subsidy. In 2002 the owner of the property, the Island Capital Group, indicated that it might like to buy out of the Mitchell-Lama Program and convert the units to market rate. The Bloomberg administration worked out an arrangement to sell the units to the tenants but preserve affordability for those who wanted to continue to rent. The tax abatements that facilitated this conversion expire in 2018 and in November 2017 developer Madison Equities offered to purchase the properties and redevelop them as high rises.

She studies the development of gender, with particular focus on how the interaction of prenatal and postnatal experience shape brain development and behavior.  Education  Hines received a bachelor's degree in Psychology from Princeton University. She was in the first group of women enrolled as undergraduates, which could have inspired an interest in gender. She received a PhD from the University of California, Los Angeles. The focus of her thesis was the gender-related behaviour of women whose mothers had taken the synthetic oestrogen diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy.  Research  Hines completed a postdoctoral fellowship in Neuroendocrinology and Neuroscience at the UCLA Brain Research Institute. She investigated hormonal influences on brain development in rodents there and at the University of Wisconsin, Madison where she was a visiting scientist. She received the Shephard Ivory Franz Award for Distinguished Teaching at UCLA. After her postdoctoral fellowship, she was appointed as an Assistant and then Associate Professor at UCLA. During her time at UCLA she trained and was licensed as a clinical psychologist. Hines moved to the UK and joined City University as a Professor of Psychology in 1996. She is a Chartered Counseling Psychologist in the UK (British Psychological Society). In 2006 she joined the University of Cambridge and Churchill College, Cambridge. She is Director of the University of Cambridges's Gender Development Research Centre. Her research focuses on the causes and consequences of sex/gender differences in human brain and behaviour. Based on findings that male and female vervet monkeys show toy preferences that resemble those seen in children, Hines and Alexander suggested that \\"sex differences in toy preferences can arise independent of the social and cognitive mechanisms thought by many to be the primary influences on toy preferences\\". Other research indicates that girls with high levels of testosterone are less interested in dolls, and more interested in toy vehicles, than are other girls. She has appeared on a discussion panel with autism researcher Simon Baron Cohen, who also is interested in hormonal influences on human gender development. Their results have, however, sometimes differed from one another's.  Public engagement  Hines was the President of the International Academy of Sex Research. She is the author of Brain Gender, published in 2004 by Oxford University Press. She spoke at the Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge \\"Women's Word\\" festival in 2011. In 2013 she appeared on BBC Radio 4 discussing the spat between Suzanne Moore and transgender rights activists. In 2014 she was an invited speaker at the Cambridge Science Festival.

She believes that a woman loses her natural traits after enrolling in a grooming school. Her mother persistently pressurizes her to marry and to shape herself into an ideal, well-groomed, upper-class wife; to fulfil her desire to see her daughter get married after constant proposal rejections. She believes that Meera can only be socially acceptable by changing herself by going to Soni Kudi Academy. However, Meera is strongly against the idea and believes that she should only marry someone who loves her the way she is. Vivaan is a rich, business tycoon and a NRI from London. He comes back to India on his sister Amaya's wish and also in search of his long-lost mother, Pammi Kapoor, who left them as a child. Although he has hatred for his biological mother; he secretly yearns to meet her. Vivaan's trust issues stem from his abandonment issues and he promises himself to never marry.

Meera's alliance is fixed with Sumair (Paramvir Cheema) but in a comedy of errors, she ends up meeting Vivaan at the airport. Their opinionated personalities clash and they argue. It is later revealed that Vivaan is the landlord of Kapoor Mansion, of which the Dhingras are caretakers. While Vivaan and Amaya live in the same house, Meera's wedding preparations begin. While Vivaan believes Meera to be a gold digger, Meera hates Vivaan's egoistic personality. Meera secretly harbors the desire to play a qualifying kabaddi match on her wedding day. Vivaan initially befriends Meera to extract information about a bangle in her possession, which resembles his mother's, but over time unbeknownst to themselves they start caring for each other. Sumair, who initially comes across as understanding of Meera's stand, is slowly revealed to be a man who has his own expectations from his wife-to-be. Meera complies for the sake of her family and finding no support from her fiance, decides to groom herself. Vivaan and Meera on the other hand constantly bicker, but Vivaan ends up saving her from sticky situations that she lands in owing to her wedding preparations. While Sumair is gradually shown to be a shallow minded person, Vivaan comes across as a liberal, open-minded individual albeit with his own imperfections. Sumair falls in love with Meera's cousin Silky. He has no regard for Meera and to pull himself out of the wedding, he makes a fake MMS clip of Meera and Vivaan and airs it on the wedding day. He manipulates Meera into believing that it was Vivaan who made the video for which she slaps Vivaan. Meera is abused and bad mouthed by village goons but Vivaan saves her. They marry to save Meera's dignity. But they decide to divorce after their wedding as they're not happy. However they decide to hide their impending divorce from Meera's family till situation cools down. Meanwhile Vivaan's step mother and business partner Roma Kapoor (Shilpa Saklani) comes to live in Kapoor Mansion with the agenda of breaking the couple's relationship. However Meera and Vivaan become friends and gradually start falling in love but this irks Roma. She creates many misunderstandings between the couple and manipulates Vivaan, who already has contempt for his birth mother, into believing that Pammi Kapoor wants to kill Amaya and him. Meera refuses to believe this and this becomes the root cause for clashes and separation between the couple. The divorce keeps coming up between them. Eventually Pammi Kapoor is revealed as Soni Kudi's owner Mrs. Singh. Roma is exposed and all allegations against Pammi are quelled and they reunite as one happy family. Vivaan and Meera decide to express their love for each other but unfortunately happy times do not last long and Pammi and Amaya are kidnapped. Vivaan is blackmailed and a series of events lead to Pammi's death and Amaya being in coma. Vivaan misunderstands Meera and blames her for interfering in the kidnapping mess and thus causing Pammi's death. Meera tries very hard to prove her innocence to Vivaan but to no avail and he decides to divorce her. He starts hating on Meera when she refuses to divorce him and troubles her to no end with harsh words and actions. But a series of events lead Meera and Vivaan to the alleged kidnapper where Meera saves Vivaan from being shot at, by taking the bullet herself. Vivaan's misunderstandings are cleared and tries to win back her love, berating himself for believing a wrong and contrived version of events. Unfortunately, Meera's father gives Meera the ultimatum to choose between himself and Vivaan. Meera chooses her father forcefully and is also hurt because of Vivaan's past actions, but this does not stop Vivaan. He enters the Dhingra household as a cook, to prove he will do anything for Meera. Meera's father creates many problems for Vivaan and continuously insults him. He puts up with it for Meera's sake.

The distance to this system, as determined from its annual parallax shift of , is 719 light years. It is moving further from the Earth with a heliocentric radial velocity of +27 km/s. The variable nature of this star was discovered at the Moscow Observatory by Lidiya Tseraskaya (L. Ceraski) in 1908. It was classified as a U Geminorum-type variable, or dwarf nova. Observation since 1926 showed that this variable undergoes two different types of eruptions: a short maxima lasting around two days that ranged in brightess between 11.6‚Äì12.9 magnitude, and a longer maxima extending for 13 days that ranged between 10.4‚Äì11.8 magnitude. The later event came to be referred to as 'supermaxima'. Similar dwarf novae of this class have since been discovered, and SU UMa is now the prototype for this sub-category of variable stars. This is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of . It consists of a white dwarf star that is acquiring matter from its close companion via an accretion disk. This disk is unstable and undergoes periodic outbursts which increase the luminosity of the system. For SU UMa, the accretion rate from the companion is . X-ray emission has been detected in the vicinity of the white dwarf, which drops by a factor of four during outbursts. This emission is theorized to come from the boundary layer between the white dwarf and its accretion disk.

It was produced in 1505‚Äì1506 by Andrea Mantegna and is now in the National Gallery in London. Like much of Mantegna's output after 1495 it is in monochrome, linked to contemporary sculpture and also part of the trend for illusion and trompe l'oeil favoured by the Mantuan court and especially by Isabella d'Este. History It was commissioned in 1505 by cardinal Marco Cornaro for the study of his brother Francesco, a patrician of Venice. The Cornaro family was said to be descended from the Cornelia gens of ancient Rome - the same cardinal signed himself \\"Marcus Cardinalis Cornelius\\" in a letter asking Francesco II Gonzaga for a work from Mantegna, who was the latter's court painter at the time. Alberta De Nicol√≤ Salmazo, Mantegna, Electa, Milano 1997 The chosen subject was from the history of the Cornelii, specifically the arrival of Cybele's image in Rome during the Second Punic War, as told in Ovid, Appian and Livy. Publius Cornelius Scipio had consulted the Sibylline Books and ordered the image brought from Mount Ida. The Delphic Oracle requested that the most worthy Roman be sent to collect it and so the senate had chosen Africanus' cousin Scipio Nasica for the role. The ship carrying the image back got stuck in the shallows of the River Tiber, but the Vestal Virgin Claudia Quinta proved her virginity by helping to free it.Tatjana Pauli, Mantegna, serie Art Book, Leonardo Arte, Milano 2001. Detail The shepherd Mantegna showed a scene after the image had been brought ashore, just as it arrives at the temple built in Rome for it. He based it on ancient Roman sarcophagi, then starting to be rediscovered and entering collections such as the Gonzaga collection in Mantua. He painted the scene as if it was carved into a piece of marble with two differently mottled layers, one forming the scene and the other the background. Two pyramid tombs to the left bear the names of Nasica's father Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus and Africanus' father Publius Cornelius Scipio - Gnaeus and Publius were brothers. The two bearers in front of the image are turbaned like Moors, and the bearded pair at the back wear tiara-like hats. One of the two rear bearers also holds a laurel branch, as used in a Roman triumph, as does a young slave crouching in front of the bust. The bust wears a corona turrita and stands on a sphere on a precious carpet, with the sphere representing universality. Behind it is a ritual torch, whilst Nasica is shown as a young man kneeling before the bust - his words welcoming it are shown on the lower border. Behind him is another senator, probably Africanus, who is speaking to another man, possibly his fellow-consul Publius Licinius Crassus Dives. The furthest right figure is a shepherd, wearing a Phrygian cap, playing a flute and drum and standing on the steps of the temple to which the image is being brought - a trumpet protrudes from the temple doors. Giovanni Bellini's Continence of Scipio (National Gallery of Art, Washington) was painted as a pendant for it, but two other intended paintings were never produced. Garavaglia cites a spoken assertion by Roberto Longhi that the painting could have been accompanied by the two smaller monochrome works Sofonisba and Tuccia ‚Äì they are certainly the same height as The Introduction, but they are on panel not canvas and no documents support the theory. Pietro Bembo wrote a letter to Isabella Gonzaga in 1505, referring to arguments about payment between the commissioner and the painter, which meant it was still mentioned in the inventory of Mantegna's studio contents after his death in 1506, which refers to it as \\"principiata\\" (ie begun but incomplete). It was completed by Mantegna's son Francesco, by Bellini or another painter. Like other works in Mantegna's studio upon his death, it was acquired by cardinal Sigismondo Gonzaga, who in 1507 finally delivered it to Francesco Cornaro.Ettore Camesasca, Mantegna, in AA.VV., Pittori del Rinascimento, Scala, Firenze 2007.

The waters from the natural lagoon are evaporated to yield the salt. The waters of the lagoon were originally pumped in using wind power, but now electric pumps are used. Up to 2,000-15,000 tons of salt per year can be extracted from the salt flats. The salt that came from the salt flats has been used to preserve fish.

They show the Carthaginian noblewoman Sophonisba poisoning herself to avoid being paraded in a Roman triumph, the Roman Vestal Virgin Tuccia proving her chastity by carrying water in a sieve, Judith with the head of Holofernes and Dido holding Sychaeus's funeral urn. Infrared reflectography has uncovered a signature on the back of Judith reading And.a Mantegnia. . (Andrea Mantegna painted [it]). Sophonisba and Tuccia are egg- tempera on poplar panel, whilst Judith and Holofernes are glue-tempera on linen canvas. All four works are in monochrome or grisaille and imitate relief sculpture, a style very popular in the Mantuan court at the time thanks to the expense of importing marble from neighbouring Italian states and the lack of sculptors at court. Another example was the same artist's The Introduction of the Cult of Cybele at Rome from around the same times. Tuccia and Sophonisba originally had the same dimensions. History All four were attested in the inventory of the belongings of Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, produced in 1542 two years after his death. In 1738 they were next mentioned in an inventory of marshal Schulenburg's collection, though sometimes the paintings are mentioned with dimensions that do not match the current dimensions of any of the four works. They were separated into two pairs at a Christie's auction on 13 April 1775, with Tuccia and Sophonisba entering the Duke of Hamilton's collection and Judith and Dido sold to John Taylor. The two paintings in the Hamilton collection were sold to the National Gallery in London in 1882 when that collection was dispersed, whilst those originally bought by Taylor were sold in 1912 and after a couple of changes of ownership entered the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in Canada; .

Burns concerning the aftermath of a school shooting that takes place in the school library. It was inspired by Dave Cullen's book Columbine about the Columbine Massacre. The original production ran from March 25 to April 27, 2014 at The Public Theater in New York City, directed by Steven Soderbergh and starred Chlo√´ Grace Moretz. Plot The play centers on Caitlin Gabriel, a high-school student in an unnamed town who survives a school shooting, then struggles to relay her version of events against eye-witness reports from fellow survivors that she informed the shooter, who is based on Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, where other students had hidden. Even her own parents accept media reports of this accusation, which spark widespread revulsion towards her in the aftermath of the shooting. Cast * Chlo√´ Grace Moretz * Ben Livingston * Michael O'Keefe * Daryl Sabara * Lili Taylor * David Townsend * Tamara Tunie * Jennifer Westfeldt Reception The New York Times review describes a \\"sound-and-light tsunami\\" that \\"leans without mercy on our alarm buttons\\" and says when the panic subsides, \\"like the characters onstage, we‚Äôre left looking for patterns in the chaos.\\" Playwright Burns doesn't make the mistake of trying to find clear motivations for that crime, the review continues, but considers how such events warp and contaminate those who survive them. The culprit is \\"a media- driven culture that searches for instant heroes, while turning tragedy into profit as fast as it can.\\" The review concludes that there's \\"a more interesting, less schematic play lurking within 'The Library'\\". Disaster brings out both pettiness and heroic traits, but the review found \\"The Library\\" most tantalizing in more seemingly incidental details, such as Caitlin's self-doubt and the possibility that she knew the shooter more than the play exposes. Production The Library is loosely based on Dave Cullen's book Columbine about the Columbine high school massacre. Producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall acquired the rights to Cullen's book, initially with the intention of turning it into a feature film by director David Fincher. The producers ultimately decided against turning the book into a film about the Columbine massacre. Instead, they adapted the book into a play which incorporated themes from the book. Possible future Producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall have expressed their intention to put the play on in other cities across the United States, and possibly around the world.

As the town cafe and natural meeting point, where Nick also rented a room as office space for his salvage company, much of the drama happened in and immediately around Molly's Reach. The original structure was built in 1931, and served a variety of purposes, including a second hand store, a general store, a hardware store and a liquor store, prior to serving as a set for the television show. After the show ended it was turned into an actual restaurant. The Beachcombers was the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's longest running series, one which was re-sold in fifty foreign markets, and fans of the show, both foreign and domestic, seek out the restaurant. The restaurant's walls bear many photos featuring the show's cast and crew. In 2016 the Vancouver Sun called the restaurant Gibsons' \\"most prominent landmark\\". It is located in the middle of town on the main highway, just up the street from the government dock. A made for TV movie, The New Beachcombers, to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the original series first episode, revolved around a fictional fight to prevent the restaurant being torn down and replaced by condominiums. The building was put up for sale on September 22, 2019.

Angalo was the first man, and son of the god of building. Angalo's head touched the sky and he could easily walk from the Ilocos Region to Manila in one step. Through Angalo's actions, he shaped the hills and mountains of Luzon, formed the oceans, and put up the sky, sun, moon and stars. Prehispanic Ilocano people attributed the sound of thunder as Angalo's voice, earthquakes as his movements, and rainbows his hanging G-string. Angalo was not alone, he had a giant wife named Aran and together they had three daughters whom the Ilocano, Aeta and Igorot people are descendants.  Landscape Mythology of Angalo  Throughout the Ilocos Region, Abra and Benguet many geological formations are attributed to Angalo and his family. Small valleys and gulches in the Cordillera Central mountain range are often noted as the giant footprints of Angalo such as found in Sudipen, La Union and San Quintin, Abra. In addition, large caves in the Ilocos Region and Abra are often described as being former shelters for Angalo's wife and his daughters. In Santa Maria, Ilocos Sur the large depressions and pools around Pinsal Falls are said to be created when Angalo knelt and drank from the falls. Pinsal Falls In Santa, Ilocos Sur the Banaoang Gap, a water gap where the Abra River breaks the Ilocos mountain range, is said to be created by Angalo. Long ago, the Abra region east of the Ilocos mountain range was once a lake. One night, Angalo slept on the shore of the lake, and as he slept, he kicked the Ilocos range and in doing so unleashed the lake and created the Banaoang Gap . Banaoang Gap with Abra River  Anecdotes of Angalo = Salt in the Sea = One day, Angalo asked his family to take bags with blocks of salt he harvested from distant lands to Manila. As they walked through the seas, which at the time were not salty, his daughters stumbled and their giant blocks of salt fell into the sea. The blocks of salt melted as they hit the water and created the saltiness of the sea. = Shallow Sea = On a very hot day, Angalo's daughters decided to swim in what is now the South China Sea. The sea was deep at this time, and his daughters did not know how to swim well. When one of his daughters began to drown, Angalo dipped the flap of his baag or loincloth into the sea and it absorbed so much water that his daughter was able to touch the sea floor again. = Hill of Suso Beach = One day, Angalo and his wife Aran were at the what is today called Suso Beach in Santa Maria, Ilocos Sur. While on the beach, Angalo piled up stones, shrubs, and sand to form a hill. When asked about his creation, he told his wife that he made the hill to resemble and honor her breasts. To this day. the hill on the southern side of Suso beach is said to be that hill.

It was blazed in 1858 to carry stagecoach traffic between the Mississippi River port and a major inland town in southeast Minnesota. History Construction of the Lake City and Rochester Stage Road was funded by a group of property owners in Lake City, Minnesota, who hoped to funnel trade from the interior through their river port community. They also subsidized a stagecoach line operated by the Northwestern Express Company, which became the Minnesota Stage Company the following year. Work on the route began in spring 1858 and the stagecoach company was completing daily runs by mid-May. The route was advertised as the shortest between Rochester and the Mississippi River, and superior in condition to all alternatives. In 1859 the U.S. government requested bids from private contractors to deliver mail along the route and received 22, making it one of the most sought-after mail routes in the state. The Lake City and Rochester Stage Road was blazed near the end of a six-year frenzy of road building in southeast Minnesota. These new transportation connections spurred the region's development. The stage road to Lake City was effective in helping the river port flourish. Southeast Minnesota's stage roads diminished in importance in 1867 when a railroad line opened between Waseca and Winona, becoming the preferred route to the Mississippi. The route of the Lake City and Rochester Stage Road was eventually straightened and became a leg of U.S. Route 63. Mount Pleasant Section When the Lake City and Rochester Stage Road was straightened and incorporated into the modern highway system, a curving was abandoned and remains much as it appeared in the mid-19th century. Known as the Mount Pleasant Section for its location within Mount Pleasant Township, it stands on the northwest side of Route 63 about southwest of Lake City. It comprises a dirt path curving through undeveloped woods. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991 as the Lake City and Rochester Stage Road-Mount Pleasant Section for its state-level significance in the theme of transportation.

Youth and education Gilling was the elder son of Richard Gilling, baker, was born at Stogumber, Somersetshire. He was educated at a nonconformist academy in Taunton, maintained (1678‚Äì85) by George Hamond, an ejected minister. John Fox, his relative and biographer, says that when Gilling began to preach ‚Äòhe preached often in the churches, though he was never a regular conformist.‚Äô Career He received presbyterian ordination at Lyme Regis, Dorsetshire, on 25 August 1687, being at that time ‚Äòcurate of Barrington and Seavington St. Mary in Somerset.‚ÄôWilson's Dissenting Churches, 1814, iv. 393 His next employment was at Axminster, Devonshire, as usher in a Latin school; while here he preached to a congregation of independents. He then became pastor of the presbyterian congregation at Silverton, Devonshire. Here he married a lady (from Brampford-Speke) ‚Äòsomewhat deformed,‚Äô but of good estate. From Silverton he was called to the charge of the presbyterian congregation at Newton Abbot, Devonshire, in succession to William Yeo, an ejected minister who died in 1699. Gilling, who was a scholarly and genial divine, kept a flourishing boarding-school at Newton Abbot, and got into trouble during the reign of Anne for doing so without the bishop's license. He was more than once obliged to abscond to prevent arrest, the last occasion being in 1712, when (in a disguise) he accompanied Fox to London. In ecclesiastical politics he was for a consolidation of the dissenting interest, and was an active member of the Exeter assembly, formed in 1691 as a union of presbyterians and independents on the London model. Of this body he was for many years the scribe; his quarto volume of manuscript minutes (to 1718) is preserved in Dr. Williams's library. In the disputes of 1719 he sided with the minority against subscription, and hence was excluded from the assembly and deserted by more than half his hearers, who formed a new congregation under Samuel Westcot. Other disappointments followed; Gilling lost heart, fell into a lingering sickness, and died on 20 or 21 August 1725. His age is not given, but the date of his ordination shows that he could not have been born later than 1662. He was buried in his meeting-house. He had wished to be interred in the church or churchyard at Newton Abbot, but the parish being a peculiar, the ordinary, Sir William Courtenay, refused to permit the interment, saying ‚Äòthey might bury him in one of the marshes.‚Äô Family By his first wife Gilling had a son Isaac, educated as a physician at Paris and entered at Leiden University on 4 October 1723, who did not turn out well, and a daughter, married to John Fox. His second wife, n√©e Atkins, of Exeter, led him into extravagances.

It has a single thin leaf and up to twelve dark purple to dark reddish purple flowers. It is mostly found in heath on the Central Coast and only around fifty plants survive. Description Genoplesium insigne is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin, dark green leaf with a reddish base. The leaf is long, about wide with the free part long. Between five and twelve dark purple to dark reddish purple flowers are arranged along a flowering stem tall and taller than the leaf. The flowers are about wide and as with others in the genus, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long, wide and concave. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide and more or less parallel to each other. The petals are lance- shaped to narrow egg-shaped, long and wide. The labellum is egg-shaped to elliptic, about long, wide with purple hairs up to long on the sides. There is a fleshy, dark purplish black callus in the centre of the labellum and covering less than half of it. Flowering occurs between August and November. Taxonomy and naming Genoplesium insigne was first formally described in 2001 by David Jones who published the description in The Orchadian from a specimen collected in the Lake Macquarie State Recreation Area. In 2002, Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Corunastylis insignis. The specific epithet (insigne) is a Latin word meaning \\"remarkable\\", \\"eminent\\" or \\"distinguished\\". Distribution and habitat The dark midge orchid grows in heath and heathy forest, in four small areas between Chain Valley Bay and Wyong with a further small population near Lake Macquarie. Conservation It is difficult to determine the precise number of plants of the G. insigne because they are difficult to locate and weather conditions affect whether or not the plants flower. There are estimated to be around fifty plants surviving. The species is classed as \\"Critically Endangered\\" under the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act and the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act. The main threats to the species are weed invasion, habitat disturbance, grazing by rabbits and illegal collecting.

A kegger/house party in Oakland and the first \\"official\\" Machine Head show in Las Vegas, NV on August 29, 1992. In 1993, he decided to leave the band, stating, \\"I left the band, because I was very young and new at playing drums, especially double bass. The band called for a lot of double bass. Basically, out of my own insecurities, I self-destructed. I've suffered a lot from the loss and will never forget not playing in my favorite band ever, but I had to do what was healthy for me and the band. I was even asked to rejoin, if I had certain parts very solid on the double bass aspect of it all, but I still felt I couldn't give the band what they needed.\\" He wrote the drums for seven songs from their debut album Burn My Eyes: A Thousand Lies, The Rage to Overcome, Death Church, A Nation on Fire, Blood for Blood, I'm Your God Now, and Block (originally titled Fuck it All).

It is found in the USA.Dean DA (2016). \\"Catalogue of Texas spiders\\". ZooKeys 570: 1-703.  Diet  Hogna lenta eats mostly small insects, such as crickets, waxworms, and mealworms. If individuals cannot find any of these, they will eat beetles and other smaller insects. When they are newly emerged from an egg sac, they eat small fruit flies, and each other. The species is a ground spider, making burrows in the dirt. They lay web tripwires on top of their burrow. When something walks over the web, the spider feels it. They slowly uncover themselves, stalking their prey, before finally pouncing on them. They have a neurotoxin that they inject into the insect through their fangs. It paralyzes the insect immediately while the spider drinks the hemolymph from the insect.  Natural defenses  Hogna lenta is naturally equipped with a venom powerful enough to paralyze a small insect. This venom should pose no threat to a healthy adult human, only feeling like a bee sting. They generally raise their front legs in the air when threatened, to look bigger. If this does not work, they will lunge right in front of their attacker to startle them. Their last defense, is of course, biting the attacker. Due to their sheer size, most animals would not try to attack them. Their diameter is about the same as a 50-cent coin.  Habitat  They primarily live in dense shrubbery and forests. They make small but intricate burrows, infusing the soil with webs. Despite some people's beliefs, they very rarely stray into people's houses. They will, however, wander into camping tents, seeing all the mosquitos there. They have been spotted in Florida and many other southern states.  Lifestyle  Shortly after mating (maybe 1‚Äì2 weeks), the female constructs a large white egg sac bigger than its abdomen containing many eggs. They carry the egg sac on the spinnerets on their abdomen. Spiderlings grow slowly inside the eggs for 5‚Äì8 weeks, before finally hatching. When emerged from an egg sac, they are hardly visible, about the size of a small LED light. They stay on the mother's abdomen for about 1‚Äì4 weeks. When ready, they climb off and run off into the wild. When small, they are extremely agile, making them hard to catch. Many of the young spiders die off within a few days of leaving the mother's back. If they live a few weeks, they molt. This is a process of shedding their old skin. Spiders molt their old skin, as their new skin is malleable. They grow while the new skin is soft, than repeat the process. Young spiders can molt up to 3 times a month.

The bronze statue was commissioned by the city of Dublin in 1717, as a gesture of loyalty towards George I (who had been King of Great Britain and Ireland since August 1714), in the face of support from Irish Catholics for the pretender to his throne, James Stuart. George is shown wearing contemporary clothing, but with a laurel wreath in the Roman style. The work may have been finished by van Nost's students. It was displayed on Essex Bridge (now Grattan Bridge) in Dublin from 1722 until some time between 1753 and 1755, when it was removed by George Semple, who was in charge of rebuilding the bridge, in order to prevent erosion caused by the flow of water around the pedestal on which the statue sat. The statue was re-erected in 1798 in the gardens of the city's Mansion House. It was acquired for the Barber Institute in 1937 (at which time Dublin was the capital of the Irish Free State) by the institute's founding director, Thomas Bodkin, who had arrived there directly from his post as director of the National Gallery of Ireland in 1935. In July 1982, the statue was granted legal protection as a Grade II listed structure, preventing unauthorised removal or alteration.

The museum also has an exhibit which explains the connection between the Phoenix Police and the \\"Miranda Rights\\". There are various educational exhibits in the museum some of which the community can participate and have an interactive experience. History In October 1993, a temporary six-month display of the history of the Phoenix Police was created and exhibited at the Historic Phoenix City Hall located at 17 S. Second Ave.. The response of the public to the exhibit was favorable.ABC15Q&A; The Phoenix Police MuseumDid You Know: Phoenix Police Museum Traces Its HistoryExciting Exhibits for allPhoenix Law Enforcement Association A petition was made by various organizations, such as the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, to the Arizona Humanities Council to help fund a study of police-related artifacts. The study proved that there was enough material in existence to open a small museum. Volunteers, with the help of the donations from local companies, worked on the museum project. Finally, on October 6, 1995, the Phoenix Police Museum opened its doors in the old Barrister Place. The Old Barrister Place was once known as the Old Jefferson Hotel, and is located at 101 S. Central Ave. In 2012, the museum moved to its current location at the Historic Phoenix City Hall. It so happens that the location was actually the home of the Phoenix Police Department from 1928 until 1975. The staff who are in charge of the museum and its guided tour is made up of volunteers who are former Phoenix Police Officers. The museum is a non-profit organization and the admission to the museum is free. Children can try on a real Phoenix Police uniform and get sworn in as a police officer while visiting the museum. Exhibits Early Phoenix Police Department switchboard. The following is a small list of some of the exhibits in the Phoenix Police Museum: *One of the earliest exhibits is that of the \\"Jail Rock\\". Jack Swilling the founder of Phoenix, was named constable before the area even had a jail house. The legs of the prisoners would be shackled to the \\"jail rock\\" to avoid their escape. *A mock of an old wood and brick marshals office complete with a jail, a figure that represents Marshal Henry Garfias, and a prisoner. *An exhibit of the Arizona Rangers and the tools of their trade. *A 1919 Model T Police Cruiser which had a 20-horsepower engine and ran a maximum speed of 45 mph. *Early Gamewell Co. 1920 Police Telegraph (Call Box). The call boxes were used to notify an officer that headquarters wanted him. These were supplemented by a system of horns and flashing lights. *There are various law enforcement exhibits which show the evolution of the department, its officers and weapons from its founding to the present. *A Chevrolet Celebrity Police Cruiser from the 1980s. *The first helicopter, a Hughes 300C model, which was first used by the Phoenix Police Department in 1974. *An original prison cell gate (door). *The museum has a display of police related Patches And Badges. The museum also has a Memorial Room dedicated to the Phoenix Police Employees who have made the ultimate sacrifice with their lives. Plus, there is also an exhibit honoring our K-9 partners who had duty in the line-of-duty. Ernesto Miranda In 1963, Ernesto Miranda was arrested by the Phoenix Police. He was accused and subsequently convicted of robbing, kidnapping and raping an 18-year-old woman. His case went up to the Supreme Court and the ruling changed the way police departments across the country interrogated suspects. In the museum you can view Miranda's official police report, his booking photo and his now-famous confession.

It is attributed to Andrea Mantegna, dated to around 1460. Its poor conservation, including over- harsh restoration to Mary's face, means that some art historians cannot accept it as an autograph work and theorise that it was produced by a follower of Mantegna after an autograph original. Its provenance is unknown before 1891, when it appeared for sale at a London art dealer. It was purchased by Charles Butler, from whom it passed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1926, where it still hangs.Catalogue entry If it is an autograph work, it dates from after Mantegna's trip to Rome and some attribute it to the end of his Paduan period (c.1460), suggested by comparison with the Presentation at the Temple, which has similar fictive marble frame in the foreground. It belongs to a group of small-format Madonnas produced by Mantegna for private devotion - others include Madonna with Sleeping Child (Berlin), the Poldi Pezzoli Madonna and the Bergamo Madonna. The cherubim are in blue and the seraphim in red, whilst the painter has drawn on Donatello's example in showing Mary incline her face towards her son.

Prompted by the Great Depression and corruption in the Squires administration, a peaceful protest degenerated into riots and violence. The riots led to the fall of the Squires government and the defeat of Squires's Liberal Party.  Background  Richard Squires was elected as Prime Minister of Newfoundland in 1928, despite having previously been arrested in a 1923 bribery scandal. Shortly after, the Great Depression arrived in Newfoundland. Newfoundland was hit especially hard by the depression. At the same time, Squires was facing allegations of corruption. His finance minister, Peter John Cashin, resigned in 1932 alleging widespread corruption in Squires' administration and of falsifying minutes to hide secret payments he had received. John Middleton was asked to investigate the charges. His conclusion that there was no sign of falsified records was a major trigger for the riots.  Riots  In the afternoon of April 5, a large crowd of protester had gathered at the Majestic Theatre for a planned march to the Colonial Building. Beginning with 2,000 people, the protest eventually gained an additional 1,500 as they marched toward the Colonial Building. Upon arrival at the building, protest leaders presented a petition demanding investigation of the corruption charges against Squires. Protestors got impatient waiting for a response to the petition, and some started attempting to break through the doors. When the doors were finally breeched, protestors began entering the building and the police attacked everyone they saw with batons, including several uninvolved spectators, both inside and outside the building. In response, protestors began throwing objects through windows, breaking most windows in the building. There were also attempts to set the building on fire, which all failed. Prime Minister Squires exited the building at around 7:30, surrounded by bodyguards, but was found by the crowd, who forced him into a private residence. However, Squire successfully escaped through a back door of the house. Damage was estimated at $10,000.  Aftermath  Squires resigned as Prime Minister while the riot was still in progress, and called new elections. In the resulting election, Squires' Liberal Party won a mere two seats, losing to rival party United Newfoundland Party that won most of the seats. This government was dissolved in 1934 and replaced by the Commission of Government, a non-democratic body with representatives chosen by the British Government. Newfoundland would not see another democratic election until it joined Canada as its tenth province.

The last event of the season is usually the Music City Knockout, which takes place at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee. In 2020, this event was canceled and rescheduling has yet to take place. Major events offer competition in different formats, bonus bulls, and more prize money.

It is a science fiction story, dealing with a tale of a man who has had immortality thrust upon him in a way that does not benefit him at all. It was first published in Kersh's own collection, The Brighton Monster and Other Stories (Heinemann, 1953) and later collected in the anthology One Hundred Years of Science Fiction (Simon & Schuster, 1968), edited by Damon Knight. Plot In July 1945, at the conclusion of the war in Europe, a war correspondent by the name of Kersh is on board the RMS Queen Mary with thousands of American soldiers returning home. He expects to be sent to the Pacific to cover the conflict there. While drinking the last of the whisky he smuggled aboard for the days of the voyage, he is accosted by Corporal Cuckoo, a man apparently about 30 years old covered in battle scars, more than could be had in the latest war, and more than an ordinary man could survive. Cuckoo tells his tale after downing all the remaining whisky. He was born in France in 1507 and named Lecoq, but gained the name \\"Lecocu\\" after he was cuckolded by his wife. Under that name he served as a foot soldier, and was mortally wounded at the Battle of Turin in 1537. He took a deep wound in his skull, but after treatment by Ambroise Par√© using his own \\"Digestive\\", he came back to life. Par√© tried to keep Lecocu for his own study, but Lecocu escaped with a copy of Par√©'s notes on the creation of the Digestive. Lecocu was illiterate but eventually found a student in Paris who could read the notes. The Digestive was originally just turpentine, egg yolks and oil of roses, but Par√© added honey for Lecocu's treatment. Lecocu had by this time realized that any wound he received healed quickly. He intended to recreate the Digestive and sell it, but despite following Par√©'s procedure carefully he could not get the same results. As the years passed he realized he did not age, and could not die. He became a pirate, then returned to soldiering and participated in many famous battles in history. He met figures such as Paracelsus and William Shakespeare. Despite this, he could not be anything other than a simple soldier, unable to hang on to money or learn anything beyond what he already knew. Having fought in World War 2 he intended to live in America, grow roses, and keep chickens and bees. He still wants to recreate the Digestive and use it get rich. Kersh finds the tale incredible, but recognizes the names and battles Cuckoo describes. He cautions him that he may never recreate the Digestive. All the ingredients are products of nature, which vary from place to place, and in the case of honey, sometimes from day to day. The lucky combination that healed him may be impossible to find. Cuckoo gives him a final demonstration of his ability by almost cutting his thumb off and then having it heal within minutes, then becomes angry and storms off, never to be seen again. Kersh ends the story by appealing for anybody who remembers seeing him and can help Kersh to find him again.

It has been formerly thought to have been the transitional between the broad-toothed \\"mako\\" Cosmopolitodus hastalis and the modern great white, but is now considered to be an evolutionary dead-end with the discovery of Carcharodon hubbelli. Fossil examples have been found along northern Atlantic coastlines and in parts of Western and Central Europe. Etymology Carcharomodus is derived from the Ancient Greek Œ∫Œ¨œÅœáŒ±œÅŒøœÇ \\"k√°rkharos\\" meaning \\"jagged\\", œåŒºŒøŒπŒøœÇ \\"omoios\\" meaning \\"similar\\", and Œ¥œåŒΩœÑŒπ \\"donti\\" meaning \\"tooth\\". The name was combined with the genus Carcharodon in reference to the similarity of C. escheri's dentition with that of the modern great white shark. The species name escheri is named in honor of Escher. Thus, the species name literally means \\"Escher's similar to Carcharodon tooth\\". Description C. escheri teeth have been found around northern Atlantic coastal plains of North America, and in Western and Central Europe, with teeth being most common during the Late Miocene-Early Pliocene. Some teeth assigned to the synonym Isurus escheri has been reported in parts of the Pacific Rim including Australia and Peru, but these occurrences now represent a different taxon yet to be evaluated. With tooth size ranging up to 1.6 in (4.2 cm), C. escheri is estimated to have a body length of 13 ft (4 m). Upper teeth of C. escheri from Gro√ü Pampau, Germany. =Teeth= C. escheri teeth share resemblance to those of Isurus, Cosmopolitodus hastalis, and Carcharodon to some extent. Adult anterior upper teeth measure 2.7-4.2 cm and have an average angle between root lobes of 135¬∞. All teeth possess lateral cusplets and crenulated and irregular faint serrated cutting edges, comparable to the edges of emery paper. C. escheri teeth are dignathically heterodontic with pointed and narrow lower teeth for grasping prey and broader blade-like upper teeth for cutting flesh, suggesting an intermediate diet between Isurus and Carcharodon/Cosmopolitodus. =Size= In a 2014 study by Kriwet et al., The size estimates of C. escheri were made based on MNU 071-20 and assuming the species' relation to the modern great white. Using the formula from Gottfried et al. (1996), which bases on the ratio of the upper A2 tooth (the upper A2 tooth in this study's possession was 4.2 cm), a total body length of 3.81 m is calculated. When using an Carcharodon spp. based formula from Shimada (2001), the total body length is calculated to be 3.82 m, nearly identical to the Gottfried et al. (1996) formula. Another one of Shimada's (2001) formulas that was based on Isurus spp. was also used, which calculated a slightly smaller length of 3.67 m. Another formula by Gottfried et al. (1996) was also used, which bases on the size of the vertebral centra. With MNU 071-20's largest preserved vertebral centrum having a diameter of 77.7 mm, a total body length of 4.5 m is calculated. Based on these calculations, the study concluded the average total body length of 4 m. However, larger teeth have been found by others, and one of the largest recorded ones, which measures 5 cm, is calculated to come from a 5 m individual. With average great whites reaching lengths of for males and for females, C. escheri probably grew similar sizes to it. Taxonomy and Evolution=Taxonomic History= The C. escheri holotype tooth was first placed by Agassiz (1843) in the taxon Carcharodon escheri. However, on an earlier page and figure in the same publication he named a pathological tooth of the same species Carcharodon subserratus. In 1927, Leriche revised the taxon as a variation Oxyrhina hastalis var. escheri. In 1961, Kruckow deemed the shark as a subspecies rather than a variation of the then Isurus hastalis and renamed it as Isurus hastalis escheri. By 1969, van den Bosch re-elevated its status from subspecies to species under the name Isurus escheri. A study in 2006 by Cappetta concluded that C. escheri is closely related to the modern great white and moved the taxon back to the genus Carcharodon. In 2014, the discovery of MNU 071-20, the first known disarticulated and partially complete skeleton of C. escheri, led to the conclusion that it is a distinct genus from Carcharodon/Cosmopolitodus and erected the genus Carcharomodus. In 2018, Kent called the species Carcharodon subserratus in a review of sharks from the Calvert Cliffs, deeming Carcharodon escheri a junior synonym and arguing the species shares more similarities with C. hastalis than with Isurus and the creation of a monotypic genus to encompass it was unwarranted. =Evolution= C. escheri teeth has some intermediate traits between Isurus and Carcharodon. Due to this, it has been speculated in the past to be the transitional species between the great white (Carcharodon carcharias) and the ancient makos (Cosmopolitodus hastalis). However, a study by Ehret et al. (2012) pointed out that C. escheri is restricted only to the northern Atlantic and Europe, while both Cosmopolitodus hastalis and Carcharodon carcharias were cosmopolitan, and that it went extinct much earlier before the appearance of Carcharodon carcharias suggesting that the intermediate features were simply a result of convergent evolution. The discovery of Carcharodon hubbelli, which showed stronger transitional features between the two sharks but also filled the missing time periods further supported this claim. Carcharomodus escheri is now believed to be one of the two direct descendants of the narrow-form Cosmopolitodus hastalis, the other being the hooked-toothed mako.

At the time, the crash was the second-worst accident in Argentine aviation history and is currently the sixth-worst involving a Curtiss C-46 Commando. Accident The Curtiss C-46 Commando, registration LV-GED, took off from Buenos Aires at 19:50 local time with five crew members and 47 passengers aboard for an approximately 250-mile flight to Mar del Plata. The aircraft had already been delayed for 35 minutes due to poor weather conditions at its destination. The flight was uneventful and Flight 205 was cleared for landing by controllers on runway 12 as it neared Mar Del Plata Airport. At the time the airport's non-directional beacon (NDB) was not functional, contributing to issues with navigation. As the aircraft passed over the runway at an altitude of , it overshot the runway. Missing the approach, the captain decided to commence a go-around. However, in bad visibility with poor airport lighting, the C-46 stalled and crashed into the sea about away from the airport at 21:40 local time. All members of the crew were killed and the only survivor of the 47 passengers aboard the crash was seriously injured. Causes An investigation of the crash placed most of the blame for the accident on the crew. The pilot was not familiar with the airspace and had miscalculated his instrument approach, resulting in a missed approach. In addition, the crew's mental state contributed to the subsequent stall and loss of control that caused the aircraft to crash. Contributing factors were the non-functioning radio beacon and the poor visibility which made discerning the airport's lights and runway difficult.

Description Genoplesium morinum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin, dark green leaf, long with a purplish base and fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. The leaf sometimes remains attached to the tuber until the plant flowers in the next year. Between ten and twenty dark reddish purple flowers are crowded along of a flowering stem reaching to a height of . The flowers lean downwards, are long, wide and inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, about long and wide with dark red lines. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, wide, point downwards and spread apart from each other. The petals are broadly egg-shaped, about long and wide with darker lines. The petals have irregular edges with coarse, purple hairs up to long. The labellum is dark purplish red, linear to elliptic in shape, about long, wide with purplish hairs up to on its edges. There is a thick, fleshy, dark purplish black callus in the centre of the labellum and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs from November to January. Taxonomy and naming Genoplesium morinum was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected in the Kanangra- Boyd National Park and the description was published in The Orchadian. In 2002, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Corunastylis morina. The specific epithet (morinum) is derived from the Latin word meaning \\"mulberry coloured\\", referring to the flower colour.

For example, her book The Plant Baby and Its Friends, published in 1898, explains botany like the plant is a child. Brown believed in presenting advanced topics to children in an interesting way as a story, not in textbook form.Brown, Kate Louise. Plant Baby and Its Friends. Silver Burdett and Company Publishers, 1898. While she was most famous for her books, Brown also wrote poems for children (\\"Goddesses\\", \\"The Return\\", \\"Clappers\\", \\"The Christ Clappers\\") and music for kindergarten marching plays. Her poems were featured in children's textbooks for school.  Early life  An excerpt of Brown's poem \\"The Little Seed\\" in a children's textbook, Stepping Stones to Literature: A Third Reader\\"The Little Seed.\\" Stepping Stones to Literature: A Third Reader, by Sarah Louise Arnold and Charles B. Gilbert, Silver, Burdett, and Company, 1902, pg. 62. Brown was born in the Berkshire countryside of Massachusetts and grew up spending her time outside, flourishing her love for nature as she studied birds, animals, and plants. After her first poem was published at 9, she was given an encouraging letter by the publisher to keep writing. This initial success drove her to begin writing plays and stories. She even began a weekly magazine alongside two children whose parents were authors. As a child, she drew inspiration from \\"Ode to Evening,\\" by William Collins, \\"Daffodils,\\" also known as \\"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\\", and \\"Cynthia\\" which shaped her future poetry.  Adult life  Her first novel was a story about southern life and slavery with the main protagonist dying at the end. Her later novels greatly contrast this story as she began writing about educational, religious, and science-based topics. Brown's adult life consisted of teaching and writing. During the day, she taught in association with famous children's teachers of the 19th century: Elizabeth Peabody and Mary Tyler Peabody Mann. When she wasn't teaching, she wrote novels, poems, articles, and songs. Some of her most popular novels help children interact with science and nature. Alice and Tom is a book of lessons that follows the lives of the two children and the interaction between nature and humans. She also contributed to religious magazines and periodicals.

It developed through four main stages. Initially the program to set up a joint lobby by the competing cigarette manufacturers was known by the code-name Operation Berkshire. It was formally set up in mid 1977. The first actual organisation with staff was established by Mary Covington on loan from Philip Morris. It functioned under the name ICOSI (International Committee on Smoking Issues), and its main operating subcommittee was SAWP (Social Acceptability Working Party) which tried to find ways to make smoking more acceptable to non- smokers. An Australian ex-member of parliament, Julian Doyle was the main director at this stage. ICOSI was transformed into INFOTAB in 1984 when they decided to fund and staff the organisation to attack the growing political moves against the tobacco industry with the European Community (based in Brussels), and the World Health Organisation (WHO) and International Labor Organisation (ILO) in Geneva. The WHO in particular had a highly active anti- smoking program. The main director of INFOTAB was the Australian newspaper executive Bryan C Simpson.

Gardner, of Quaker ancestry, was born in Nantucket, Massachusetts, in 1816, and died there in 1901. When a girl, she read The Liberator and became interested in the antislavery cause. In 1841, she published the call for the first antislavery meeting in Nantucket, at which Frederick Douglass made his first public speech and electrified his audience. She delivered many lectures during the years immediately preceding the American Civil War, and after the war, she taught in freedmen's schools in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. In 1878, she returned to New York, where soon afterward, she was severely injured in a carriage accident. After many weeks of suffering and a partial recovery, she returned to her old home in Nantucket. She lectured several times before the Nantucket Athenaeum. Gardner was a fluent writer, and in 1881, she published her best work in a volume of prose and verse entitled Harvest Gleanings. Early years Anna Gardner was born on the island of Nantucket, January 25, 1816. Her father, Oliver C. Gardner, was related to most of the prominent families in Nantucket, among whom were the Cartwrights, and through them Gardner was descended from Peter Folger, the grandfather of Benjamin Franklin, and she was thus related to Lucretia Mott, Maria Mitchell, and other distinguished men and women. Through her mother, Hannah Mackerel Gardner, she descended from Tristram Coffin, the first magistrate of Nantucket. Seven generations of her ancestors lived in Nantucket. Gardner's literary tastes and talents were inherited from her mother, who was known for her love of classical poetry. On her father's side, also, she received a literary strain, as the Cartwright family has produced poets in each generation. Career Gardner became aware of slavery at an early age. She became a student, teacher, lecturer, and worker in the cause of human liberty and equal rights. She was a regular reader of The Liberator when she was eighteen years old. In 1841, she was instrumental in calling a remarkable antislavery meeting in Nantucket when she was twenty-five years of age, which was largely attended. At this convention, Frederick Douglass made his first oration as an abolitionist speaker. He had been exhorting in the Methodist Church and was unprepared for the call made upon him. Nevertheless, he responded and electrified his audience. Gardner spent many years in teaching the freed men in the South. Her work was done in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. She returned to the North in 1878, and in Brooklyn, New York, she was injured by a carriage accident. After long weeks of suffering, a partial recovery, and crutches, she returned to her Nantucket home, where she continued to be engaged in teaching those around her, and writing in the interests of truth and philanthropy.

It was printed in numerous editions over many decades from 1720 into the 19th century and updated with engravings by many artisans who worked from drawings of other artists. It featured strip maps. Road from Bristol to Banbury The atlas was based on the earlier work of John Ogilby who published the first British road atlas in 1675. Britannia Depicta was printed in 1720 by Emanuel Bowen and John Owen's firm Bowen & Owen. It was one of Bowen's earliest works. A road atlas, it contains two hundred and seventy three road maps along with drawings of landmarks and miniature county maps of each of the counties of England and Wales. It followed on John Ogilby's original with updated style of historical and heraldic detail. It was an unusual feature of the atlas that the maps were engraved on both sides of each page, and this resulted in a handier-sized book. Cadell & Davies editions Matlock, Derbyshire church from a painting by Joseph Farington Cadell & Davies published its own editions of the Britannia Depicta atlas over many years, with accompanying descriptions by Samuel Lysons.

The storm caused extensive damage and traffic disruption. It was given the name David by M√©t√©o France while the FUB named it Friederike. Meteorological history On 14 January a weak low pressure area in the Southern Caribbean developed a trough to its northeast.http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/sfc/2018/satsfcnps2018011415.gif, retrieved on 18 January 2018 During the formation of the trough, weather in the North Atlantic was dominated by the strong Icelandic Low Fionn (called Evi by the Free University of Berlin) that itself brought windy conditions to Greenland, Iceland and Scotland and bottomed out at a very intense central low pressure of . At that time, a very intense jet stream was prevalent in the North Atlantic, driven by the powerful arctic low. Thus, two of the main global weather prediction centres, GFS and ECMWF, predicted Fionn to steer the new cyclone into Europe, leading to an impact on the British Isles and Continental Europe. By that time, the track and intensity of the new storm were not clear. Likewise it was unclear if the new weather feature would affect Europe as a cyclone or if it would remain an open trough until it arrives. By 16 January the trough now stretched from its Southern Caribbean origin to eastern Newfoundland. During that day, the trough developed a circulation centre near its northern end (Newfoundland), forming closed isobars around ithttp://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/sfc/2018/satsfcnps2018011615.gif, retrieved on 18 January 2018 which indicate a closed wind circulation and qualify the system as an extratropical cyclone. Hours after formation, the storm was caught by Fionn's strong jetstream and started moving to the east, posing a threat to Europe. While crossing the Atlantic, David once again lost some structural definition and opened up into a trough under the strong influence of Fionn.http://www.met.fu- berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Analyse_20180117.gif, retrieved on 18 January 2018, showing David/Friederike while opening up into a trough The weakened David was racing eastward through the North Atlantic, taking aim at the British Isles. Meanwhile, the ECMWF and GFS lowered their predictions concerning David's intensity as it was unclear if the system would be able to recover from the structural deterioration that was inflicted by Fionn. David would cross the North Atlantic in less than two days. While David was approaching Ireland in the evening of 17 January, Fionn started to weaken as its centre began to fill. David managed to redevelop a closed circulation while passing over the British Isles and the North Sea in the morning of 18 January, worsening the risks for Central and Eastern Europe.http://www.met.fu- berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Analyse_20180118.gif, retrieved on 19 January 2018 Britain received some hurricane-force gusts up to . Subsequently, the storm had some hours to gain additional energy while moving quickly over the North Sea before making landfall in the Netherlands. The cyclone's minimal pressure bottomed out at while centred over the North Sea, which was substantially lower than predicted by GFS and ECMWF. Vlieland, an island off the northern Dutch coast, where the storm made the first of its two landfalls in the Netherlands, experienced wind gusts up to . Moving on, the winter storm rampaged in Germany, disrupting public transport services as it already did in the Benelux and causing ten deaths on 18 January. While centred over Germany, the storm still was near peak intensity, having a central pressure between , and caused widespread gusts in the range, with gusts up to on mountains.

David was a compact and fast-moving cyclone, which is typical for systems that are steered by strong Icelandic lows which develop a strong easterly flow on their southern side. Similar to Fionn, David itself had its main wind field located to the south of its centre; the northern semicircle featured comparatively low winds but was more intense in terms of precipitation. Heavy snowfall occurred on the northern flank of the storm, causing blizzard conditions in some areas.

Storm conditions also occurred in other parts of Western and Central Europe in the middle of January 2018 (even affecting Corsica). The intense winds were caused by an extensive \\"squeeze in isobars\\" that, probably amongst other meteorological factors, was caused by Fionn's great depth and extension. During that time, David was crossing the Atlantic and fluctuated in intensity, leading some models to a rather optimistic forecast. Nevertheless, David managed to begin a strengthening trend while crossing the British isles the night between 17 and 18 January. Thus, the fast-moving cyclone delivered winds up to and heavy snowfall in Britain, creating blizzard conditions there. Windthrown trees blocked roads and rail routes. Approximately 140,000 households in Britain were temporarily without power. The Netherlands were even worse affected by the cyclone. All flights were cancelled at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The rail transportation system was also completely defunct due to windthrow. Because of thrown trees and high winds, road traffic was, as well, nearly impossible and life-threatening. Winds up to knocked down trucks and cost three people's lives in the Netherlands. In the neighbouring country of Belgium, similar conditions occurred, leading to the death of one woman. Furthermore, while the cyclone was centred over the Benelux, the northern French region of Hauts-de-France was lashed by winds up to . { class=\\"wikitable sortable floatleft\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 92%;\\" ! colspan=7 style=\\"background:#ccf;\\"  Maximum gusts of Cyclone Davidhttps://kachelmannwetter.com/de/messwerte/ retrieved on 05 February 2018 - !style=\\"text-align:left\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" data-sort-type=\\"text\\"Country !colspan=\\"2\\" Lowland (<200 m) !colspan=\\"2\\" Upland (200 ‚Äì 500 m) !colspan=\\"2\\" Highland or mountains (>500 m) - !data-sort-type=\\"number\\"highest gust !data-sort-type=\\"number\\"alt [m] !data-sort-type=\\"number\\"highest gust !data-sort-type=\\"number\\"alt [m] !data-sort-type=\\"number\\"highest gust !data-sort-type=\\"number\\"alt [m] - !style=\\"text-align:left\\" Ireland       - !style=\\"text- align:left\\" United Kingdom       - !style=\\"text-align:left\\" France       - !style=\\"text-align:left\\" Belgium       - !style=\\"text- align:left\\" Netherlands       - !style=\\"text-align:left\\" Luxembourg       - !style=\\"text-align:left\\" Germany       - !style=\\"text- align:left\\" Switzerland       - !style=\\"text-align:left\\" Austria       - !style=\\"text-align:left\\" Czech Republic       - !style=\\"text-align:left\\" Poland       - !style=\\"text-align:left\\" Slovakia       } Germany received the worst impacts by the cyclone that crossed the country on a track from Lower Saxony to Southern Brandenburg on 18 January. The main wind field on the southern side of the storm led to widespread gusts up to over a region ranging from North Rhine-Westphalia to Saxony. David featured wind gusts higher than on a few German mountains, reaching their maximum on the Brocken in Saxony-Anhalt (). Simultaneously, the northern areas of Germany that were spared by the worst wind received heavy snowfall, especially the northeast. Deutsche Bahn, the country's main railroad company, halted most of its railroad transportation services since the ferocious winds and the subsequent windthrow made many railroad tracks impassable. 100,000 power cuts in North Rhine-Westphalia and 140,000 in Eastern Germany are known to have occurred at some moment on 18 January. Similarly to the situation in the Netherlands, several flights were cancelled in Germany and road transportation was limited. The pilots who were arriving in Germany and the Netherlands had to perform crosswind landings in order to land their planes in the dangerous conditions, although luckily no aviation accidents are known to have occurred because of the storm. German emergency services received thousands of calls. Eight direct fatalities and numerous injuries were caused by David in Germany. Two indirect fatalities occurred in a traffic jam that was caused by the cyclone in Saxony. Despite David's compact structure, the southern neighbor countries of Germany (Austria and Switzerland) were affected by the high winds and intense snowfall of the cyclone as David's outer bands hit the Alps. Furthermore, the traffic of the Alpine countries was negatively affected by the nearly complete halt of rail and road traffic in Germany. Even Italy, where one man died, felt some effects of the storm. In Poland, the weakening system caused traffic disruptions and some infrastructural damage, causing 50,000 power outages. The Czech Republic was inflicted some damage and power outages, too. Road and railroad traffic in Czech Republic was hampered too. In particular, some train lines that connected the Czech Republic to Germany were halted as Germany was the most affected country. 30,000 power outages were registered in the Czech Republic. As a preliminary total, 15 deaths (13 direct and 2 indirect) and 471,000 power outages are known to have occurred Europe-wide due to the effects of the storm. David/Friederike is estimated to have caused ‚Ç¨1bn in damage in Germany alone, while the damage total in whole Europe could be as high as ‚Ç¨2.6bn. Reactions and naming controversy Prior to the arrival on 17 January the cyclone received the names David by M√©t√©o France and Friederike by the Free University of Berlin. In contrast, the Met Office did not give the storm a name from its official naming list. They did not expect the storm to affect the British Isles that is intense enough to justify the usage of a storm name. Only a few hours prior to David's impact, cyclone Fionn was dominating the interaction of the two lows, weakening David into a trough, making the struggling David seem relatively harmless. As David restrengthened just before making landfall on the British Isles and inflicting unexpectedly high damage, the Met Office became subject to criticism by the British public and media. Contrastingly, the DWD (German Meteorological Office) took David seriously and classified it a major windstorm (Orkan) for its widespread hurricane-force (Bft. 12) gusts. In Germany, only exceptionally strong storms are given that title. Most storms in Germany are called Sturmtief (windstorm), a storm category which was assigned to Xavier and Herwart beforehand, two of 2017‚Äì18 season's most important storms in Germany. According to the DWD, David was the worst storm to affect central Germany since Kyrill. As a precaution, many schools in Germany remained closed and entering many forests was forbidden on 18 January.

The initiative would produce an open DNA database of biological information that provides a platform for scientific research and supports environmental and conservation initiatives. A scientific paper presenting the vision for the project was published in PNAS in April 2018, and the project officially launched November 1, 2018.  History  The initiative was inspired by Human Genome Project, and emerged during November 2015 meeting between Harris Lewin (UCD), Gene E. Robinson (IGB) and W. John Kress (Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History). In February 2017, at major conference on genomics and biodiversity organized by the Smithsonian Institution and BGI in Washington, D.C. was supported project's 10-year plan and organizational structure.  Summary  The project is projected to cost US$4.7 billion. It includes already ongoing projects such as i5K (insects), B10K (birds), 10KP (plants), and the Darwin Tree of Life, which aim to sequence the estimated 66,000 eukaryotic species in the United Kingdom. The project is aiming to sequence and annotate the roughly 1.5 million known eukaryotic species in three phases, with first to create \\"annotated chromosome-scale reference assemblies for at least one representative species of each of the ‚àº9,000 eukaryotic taxonomic families\\". According to PNAS paper, several sequencing centers are supporting the project, including BGI (China), Baylor College of Medicine (USA), Wellcome Sanger Institute (UK), Rockefeller University (US), with an additional center to be established for the project in South America by S√£o Paulo Research Foundation. As for bio-observatories which use genomics, examples which meet the project needs are National Ecological Observatory Network, Chinese Ecological Research Network, ForestGEO, and MarineGEO.

Romero was given additional time to make weight, but he weighed in at 185.2 pounds. The commission initially gave him an additional 2 hours, but after an hour Romero was made to stop cutting weight, and the bout proceeded as a non-title contest. He was fined 30 percent of his purse, which went to Whittaker. An interim UFC Welterweight Championship bout between former UFC Lightweight Champion Rafael dos Anjos and Colby Covington (initially linked to UFC 224 a month earlier) served as the co-main event.

Retrieved on February 4, 2018.), aka Victor Rodriguez, is an Argentine man sentenced to death by the state of Texas. He is the sole Argentine sentenced to death in the United States. Salda√±o, from C√≥rdoba, arrived to the United States in 1995, where he was an illegal immigrant and worked as a day laborer. He lived in New York City and later Dallas, where he was the roommate of a Mexican named Jorge Ch√°vez. On November 25, 1995, he and his co-defendant, Ch√°vez, kidnapped Paul Ray King at the grocery store in Plano, Texas by using a gun to force him into a vehicle. At Lavon Lake Salda√±o killed King with five gunshots. Trial, sentencing, and imprisonment He was tried in 1996 and found guilty. Psychologist Walter Quijano stated that Hispanics were more likely to commit crime and that the prison system had too many Hispanics during the portion of the trial in which his sentencing was determined. Salda√±o received a death sentence while Chavez was sentenced to life imprisonment. While on death row, V√≠ctor Salda√±o was originally held at the Ellis Unit. From 1999 to 2000, the death row for men was moved to the Polunsky Unit (formerly the Terrell Unit).Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Turner Publishing Company, 2004. 103; , . The Argentinian government hired lawyers to overturn the sentencing on the grounds of Quijano's testimony. Southwestern Law School constitutional law professor Jonathan Miller stated \\"He is alive today because of the Argentine government.\\" He was retried and sentenced to death in 2004. Collin County assistant district attorney John R. Rolater, Jr. stated that Salda√±o pretended to have mental illness. Miller stated that the verdict was unjust since \\"They locked him in the pressure cooker of death row for seven years and then told everyone, \`Look how dangerous he is.'\\" Salda√±o has since filed two writs of habeas corpus. In 2007, \\"he asserts that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel [...] by trial counsels' failure to preserve certain issues raised in his direct appeal.\\" This claim was reviewed by the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas and dismissed. In 2008, he \\"presents eight allegations in which he challenges the validity of his death sentence.\\" This claim was also reviewed by the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, which partially concurred with only one of Salda√±o's eight allegations, and thus upheld the death sentence. In 2013 Lidia Guerrero, Salda√±o's mother, mailed Pope Francis a letter asking him to help her son avoid execution. On March 20, 2015 and August 2, 2018, Pope Francis publicly announced his opposition to capital punishment in all cases. Legacy Filmmaker Ra√∫l Villaruel made the documentary Salda√±o, el sue√±o dorado (Salda√±o, The Golden Dream), about the case.

It was founded in 2008 by Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) to challenge the prohibition on places of worship from endorsing political candidates. According to The New York Times, ADF's campaign has become \\"perhaps its most aggressive effort.\\" Background In 1954 then Senator Lyndon B. Johnson was running for re-election to the U.S. Senate. In order to neutralize opposition from two nonprofit groups who accused him of being a communist, Johnson introduced an amendment to the Internal Revenue Service code‚Äìthe Johnson Amendment‚Äìwhich prohibited non- profit groups from endorsing political candidates. This legislation had far reaching effects not only on non-profits, but churches, synagogues, and other houses of worship. Before enactment of the Johnson Amendment, religious leaders were free to endorse or oppose candidates for office. Churches registered as 501(c)(3) organizations under the tax code are subject to revocation of their tax-exempt status should the IRS rule that they violated the political speech prohibition. Alliance Defending Freedom opposes the Johnson Amendment. Its position is explained: \\"Churches are not tax-exempt because of some bargain they make with the government. Being tax-exempt is part of freedom of religion; otherwise the government could tax churches out of existence. Now the government is telling churches you can be tax-exempt if you don't speak out on a certain topic\\". In 2017 the Free Speech Fairness Act was introduced in the United States House of Representatives. The legislation proposes to permit political speech in churches. ADF supports passage of the bill. History In 2008 ADF launched Pulpit Freedom Sunday with 35 churches‚Äîincluding several mega-churches‚Äìto directly challenge the Johnson Amendment. In acts of civil disobedience, pastors give sermons on \\"blatantly political\\" topics, which may include providing \\"biblical perspectives\\" on or endorsements of particular candidates, in defiance of IRS regulations and in hopes of triggering a First Amendment court challenge to the provisions. The 2008 event included Minnesota reverend Gus Booth, who encouraged his congregation to vote in the 2008 United States presidential election for Senator John McCain, and prohibited them from voting for Senator Barack Obama because of his position on abortion. By 2014 participation in the event had grown to over 1,800 pastors. That brought total participation since 2008 to more than 3,800 pastors. At the same time the IRS indicated that it would ramp up enforcement of the prohibition against candidate endorsement at churches.

It has a single thin leaf and up to nine greenish brown to reddish flowers with a purplish labellum. It grows with grasses and shrubs on the Southern Tablelands. Description Genoplesium oliganthum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single leaf which is long with the free part long. Up to nine greenish brown to reddish flowers are arranged along of the flowering stem which is taller than the leaf. The flowers are about long and wide and have darker stripes on the dorsal sepal and petals. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is about long and wide with hairless edges and a sharply pointed tip. The lateral sepals are about long, wide and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are about long and wide with hairless edges and a sharply pointed tip. The labellum is elliptic in shape, about long, wide, thick and fleshy with hairy edges and a pointed tip. There is a callus in the centre of the labellum and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs between January and April. Taxonomy and naming Genoplesium oliganthum was first formally described in 2001 by David Jones who published the description in The Orchadian from a specimen collected near Braidwood. In 2002, Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Corunastylis oligantha. The specific epithet (oliganthum) is derived from the Ancient Greek words oligos meaning \\"few, little\\" or \\"scanty\\" and anthos meaning \\"flower\\".

Education and career  Osman received a MFA (1982) and a BA (1979) from Queens College, City University of New York. Over the course of his career, Osman has been making sculptures that are formal contemplations on architecture, structure and space. Made primarily out of wood, paint and construction paper, Osman's works range from more intricate free-standing floor pieces to smaller-scale, more intimate sculptures. Working with materials commonly associated with construction, Osman presents opportunities to examine what can be embedded in homely assemblies. In re-contextualizing objects to form new shapes, Osman's gesture is often one of playful geometry. One sculpture may appear subtly constructed and at once block-like. Critic Jonathan Goodman commented on this tension, saying, \\"Given as they are to an agreeably rough presentation, it would be easy to see his works as entirely improvisatory; close inspection, however, reveals a sharp formal intelligence at work.\\"Jonathan Goodman. Jim Osman: Lesley Heller Workspace. Sculpture Magazine. July/August 2013.

Kansas voters chose nine electors, or representatives to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice- President. Background Kansas had been a powerfully Republican state during the 1920s (as it had been during its first quarter-century of statehood), although it did not possess the isolationist sentiment found in Appalachia or the Upper Midwest.Phillips, Kevin P.; The Emerging Republican Majority, pp. 420-426 In 1928 large-scale anti-Catholic voting swept a state substantially part of the Ozark ‚ÄúBible Belt‚Äù, so that whereas Kansas had been less anti- Democratic than more northerly Plains states in 1920 and 1924, it became Herbert Hoover‚Äôs best state in the entire nation in 1928. The 1930s saw a major drought affect the Great Plains, producing dramatic swings against incumbent President Hoover in 1932 election, which were more overwhelming in Kansas than in states further north, though less so than in the traditionally Democratic Southern Plains that had been vehemently against Al Smith‚Äôs Catholic faith in 1928.Phillips, The Emerging Republican Majority; pp. 214, 317, 352 During the first term of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Kansas twice elected Republican Governor Alfred Mossman Landon, who proved himself a skilled administrator, who was critical of the excesses of the Agricultural Adjustment Act and was the only GOP governor re-elected in 1934.Women in Congress, 1917-2006, p. 118 Landon was to have relatively little trouble gaining the Republican nomination against the popular Roosevelt in 1936. Vote Although some observers thought that Landon could bring back the West and Plains which had completely deserted Herbert Hoover in 1932,Trende, Sean; The Lost Majority: Why the Future of Government Is Up for Grabs ‚Äì and Who Will Take It, p. 14 Landon was not able to achieve this to any significant degree. Although he carried more than thirty counties that had supported Roosevelt in the 1932 election, Landon did not make the hoped-for gains there,Savage, Sean J.; Roosevelt: The Party Leader, 1932-1945, p. 126 and any gains he did make were offset by substantial losses in Kansas‚Äô larger cities, where Landon‚Äôs later anti-New Deal rhetoric was unpopular. Landon consequently improved on Hoover‚Äôs 1932 showing by only 1.71 percentage points even in a state that had known him as governor, although Kansas was Landon‚Äôs fourth-best state by vote percentage behind Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire. This would be the second- last time Kansas would support a Democratic Presidential candidate ‚Äì the only subsequent Republican to lose the state being Barry Goldwater in another landslide loss in 1964. , this is the last occasion the following counties have voted for a Democratic Presidential candidate: Chase, Cheyenne, Decatur, Graham, Greenwood, Harper, Kiowa, Lincoln, Marion, Meade, Mitchell, Morris, Rawlins, Rooks, Scott and Seward.Sullivan, Robert David; ‚ÄòHow the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century‚Äô; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Results=Results by county= { width=\\"75%\\" class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" - ! colspan=\\"1\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" County ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Franklin Delano Roosevelt Democratic ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Alfred Mossman Landon Republican ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Norman Mattoon Thomas Socialist ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" William Frederick LemkeG√©oelections; 1936 Presidential Election Popular Vote (.xlsx file for ‚Ç¨15 on request) Union ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Margin ! colspan=\\"1\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Total votes castScammon, Richard M.

Hotaling was a former prostitute and heroin addict who drew from her personal experiences to create new methods for getting women and men out of prostitution and into what she saw as healthier lifestyles. She founded the San Francisco non-profit SAGE (Standing Against Global Exploitation) in 1992. She championed holistic methods of \\"treatment\\" for former sex workers, and her methods because popular worldwide. As part of her own rehabilitation, Hotaling earned a bachelor's degree in health education from San Francisco State University. In San Francisco, she and SAGE became well known for focusing on men's roles in prostitution by establishing the First Offender Prostitution Program or \\"John\\" school, to combat and lessen the demand for prostitutes by males. In April 2008, Hotaling was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and died eight months later. SAGE continued to operate until 2014. Early life Hotaling was born in Palm Beach, Florida. Her father died when she was three years old. She and her brother were primarily raised by her mother and grandmother. She was sexually abused around the time of her fifth birthday and sexual abuse continued through all her childhood years which were spent in New York and Florida. =Prostitution= Although the details of much of Hotaling's first two decades of life are shadowy, what is certain is that she was working as a prostitute by the time she was eighteen. She moved to San Francisco in the 1980s. Hotaling was addicted to heroin and remained an addict for twenty-one years. However, she had a life-saving realization in the 1980s: \\"I realized that if I stayed in the sex industry, I was going to die. That was clear to me‚Ä¶ It was during the time when AIDS was hitting the streets and people were getting infected.\\" Toward the end of her work in the sex industry, Hotaling was kidnapped by traffickers, driven to a cemetery in Colma, outside of San Francisco, brutally beaten and sexually assaulted. She was left for dead, and the resulting physical injuries required her to have a metal plate installed inside her skull. = Rehabilitation = In 1989, Hotaling turned herself into jail and began her recovery process from drug addiction. She credited her choice to the fact that she had a circle of friends and family members who could serve as role models. As Hotaling healed from her addiction and trauma, she worked in San Francisco's jails as a counselor for prostitutes and addicts. It was during her jail work that she made the personal and institutional connections that became vital to founding and building SAGE. Activism and community role Hotaling was best known for her anti- trafficking advocacy work. She played an active role in changing rehabilitation treatments for prostitutes locally and internationally. In an oral history interview, a SAGE employee under the pseudonym \\"Angela\\" said \\"Treatment as we know it today exists because of people like Norma. She changed the face of treatment as usual in San Francisco by creating trauma- informed care. This led to 'harm reduction,' which was unheard of when we got together and began talking about an organization which was to become SAGE.‚Äù Hotaling was also known for her advocacy for Hepatitis-C awareness. Because she was infected with Hepatitis-C, she was conscious of the high risk of transmission for former prostitutes. Because intravenous drug usage is common among those involved in prostitution, the danger of Hep-C or HIV transmission is high. SAGE's harm- reduction approach to public health was used to prevent risky behavior, for instance, by offering condoms and bleach (for cleaning needles) to those at risk. = Personality = Norma Hotaling was regarded a charismatic woman. She was able to communicate well with the whole spectrum of society, from inmates and prostitutes, to the most politically successful of local, national, and international circles. On one occasion she visited the White House and spoke with President George W. Bush about the conditions of trafficked women. On a local level, she regularly worked effectively with the Sheriff's Office, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris. Hotaling believed that education and training were key factors in the rehabilitation process and undertook the task of replacing prostitution with financially viable, self-affirming employment. Accordingly, she generously enabled a number of employees and members of SAGE to attain bachelor's and master's degrees.  Founding of SAGE (Standing Against Global Exploitation)  SAGE began on a small scale, but the organization ascended to become an internationally recognized agent of change. At its peak, SAGE employed thirty-five to forty full-time employees ‚Äì most of whom had come to SAGE for treatment. The organization owned its own building on Mission Street. Francine, a SAGE employee, said, ‚ÄúNorma was so proud of SAGE and SAGE‚Äôs building at 127 Mission... It was a million-dollar property on Mission Street, three floors, a big building and she would say proudly 'Look, a building owned and run by a prostitute.'\\" SAGE was regarded as a model program, and its mission was emulated by other agencies worldwide. Hotaling worked with groups in France, India, South Korea and other countries who requested her help in established their own rehabilitation programs. One SAGE's greatest attributes was that it was run by survivors of prostitution and trauma who offered peer counseling and other direct help to survivors. = Approach to rehabilitation = Most of the treatment programs at SAGE involved therapy so that survivors could work on past emotional trauma with a person who was not afraid of listening to stories of pain and abuse. SAGE employee Angela said: ‚ÄúWhen we created SAGE, drug treatment had been based on the Synanon model ... They would shave your head and make you wear diapers and dunce caps and signs ... They might have given you a therapist if you were suicidal, but other than that, forget about it... [But] SAGE took a holistic approach to treatment and recovery, and in addition to various conventional therapies, it offered treatment approaches that were considered outside-of-the box: vitamins, bodywork, Chinese medicine, acupuncture, therapy groups, and nourishing food.\\" According to Hotaling,\\"There never was the word ‚Äúsurvivor‚Äù applied to sex workers before SAGE ‚Ä¶ Former SAGE employee Francine (under pseudonym) added, \\"It was a process of learning that we had been victims and that now we were survivors. We needed to first identify that we were victims and that it was maybe not our fault and then be able to each share our personal story and see that we survived all that.‚Äù SAGE was an innovative organization. It was the first to use a holistic approach to rehabilitate its clients, and most importantly, Hotaling insisted that ‚Äúsurvivors of the sex industry are going to be the leaders.‚Äù By establishing the John school in San Francisco SAGE was also one of the first organizations to seriously address the way in which men fuel demand within the sex trade, and to point out that if the demand side for prostitution could be made to decrease, the supply side would decrease as well.\\"There never was an analysis about the demand that is created by men; the focus was always on the woman ‚Äì just get the women off the street. Nobody knew how to talk about the men.‚Äù The work environment at SAGE was conducive to recovery, as Hotaling believed that employee participation in self-care was crucial for healing the many different types of trauma which clients and staff may have experienced. SAGE employee Francine (under pseudonym) said: \\"Over the years there were hundreds of women who came to SAGE who had prostitution issues, criminal justice issues, and substance abuse problems. I would guess at least eighty percent had been sexually abused as children. Norma very much encouraged clients and staff and she would ask: what do you do to take care of yourself? Hotaling set it up that if you were at work and there was an acupuncture session going on, you could go sit in on the group session. You could also get personal session, but not on company time. She encouraged massage, medical care‚Äîall those things were considered important to Norma. Every Friday was a staff meeting and that was important because it was a time when all of us got together to share. Working at SAGE was unique because at most jobs you can‚Äôt do those kinds of things.‚Äù = Community building = SAGE contributed to the health and life of San Francisco community in many ways. SAGE employee Angela (under pseudonym) observed, ‚ÄúSAGE saves the community a ton of money‚Äîmoney that would that otherwise be spent in jail days, spent on a hospital bed, spent on emergency room visits, spent on foster care and a whole bundle of services for children whose mothers were not able to get into a good program and get clean, stay clean, and care for their kids themselves.‚Äù =Death and afterward= Hotaling was diagnosed with late-stage pancreatic cancer in April 2008. She chose not to participate in chemotherapy, opting instead for alternative treatments. She conducted one oral history interview with Luis Enrique Bazan following her diagnosis. She died at the age of 57 on December 16, 2008. Hotaling's death led to significant changes in the community and recovery programs at SAGE. There was a loss of community spirit, Friday-morning meetings and other valued traditions disintegrated. SAGE employee Diana (under pseudonym) said ‚ÄúSAGE was never the same after Norma died. It was never, ever, ever the same. SAGE was like a family. It was more than a place to work, especially to those who were in recovery, which included just about everybody in the building ... What began as 90% survivor-run program became a 60/40 ratio of peer/survivor counselors to professional counselors.‚Äù Honors, decorations, awards and distinctions In 1998, SAGE's First Offender Prostitution Program/John school won the Innovations in American Government Award from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. In 2000, SAGE's Peer Educator Training Program won the Peter F. Drucker Award for Non-Profit Innovation through the Ford Foundation. In 2001, SAGE and Hotaling won the Use Your Life Award from Oprah's Angel Network.

It is similar to carfentanil though with a faster onset of effects, shorter duration of action and a slightly lesser tendency to produce respiratory depression. It is used in veterinary medicine to anesthetise large animals such as impala, usually in combination with other anesthetics such as ketamine, xylazine or medetomidine to reduce the prevalence of side effects such as muscle rigidity.  Side effects  Side effects of fentanyl analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression, which can be life-threatening. Potent pure opioid antagonists such as naltrexone or nalmefene are recommended in the event of accidental human exposure to thiafentanil.Haymerle A, Fahlman A, Walzer C.

During Operation Barbarossa, it was subordinated to the SS and deployed in German-occupied areas, specifically the Army Group Centre Rear Area, of the Soviet Union, as part of Police Regiment South. Alongside detachments from the Einsatzgruppen of the SD and the 1st SS Infantry Brigade of the Waffen-SS, it perpetrated mass murder in the Holocaust and was responsible for large-scale crimes against humanity targeting civilian populations. Background and formation The German Order Police (uniformed police) was a key instrument of the security apparatus of Nazi Germany. During the prewar period, SS chief Heinrich Himmler and Kurt Daluege, chief of the Order Police, cooperated in transforming the police force of the Weimar Republic into militarised formations ready to serve the regime's aims of conquest and racial annihilation. Police troops were first formed into battalion-sized formations for the 1939 invasion of Poland, where they were deployed for security and policing purposes, also taking part in executions and mass deportations. Twenty-three Order Police battalions were slated to take part in the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, known as Operation Barbarossa. Nine were attached to security divisions of the Wehrmacht. Two battalions were assigned to support the Einsatzgruppen, the mobile death squads of the SS, and Organisation Todt, the military construction group. Twelve were formed into regiments, three battalions each, and designated as Police Regiments Centre, North, South, and Special Purpose. The goals of the police battalions were to secure the rear by eliminating the remnants of the enemy forces, guarding the prisoners of war, and protecting the lines of communications and captured industrial facilities. Their instructions also included, as Daluege stated, the \\"combat of criminal elements, above all political elements\\". Along with Police Battalion 45 and 314, Police Battalion 303 was assigned to Police Regiment South. Comprising about 550 men, the battalion was raised from recruits mobilised from the 1905‚Äì1915 year groups. They were led by career police professionals, steeped in the ideology of Nazism and driven by anti- semitism and anti-Bolshevism. The regiment was placed under the command of Hermann Franz, a career policeman who had previously served in the Order Police in the occupied Poland. When the regiment crossed the German-Soviet border, it came under the control of Friedrich Jeckeln, the Higher SS and Police Leader (HSS-PF) for Army Group South in Ukraine. Operational history Police Battalion 303's actions quickly escalated to genocide while in the occupied Soviet Union. During the summer months, the battalion took part in joint actions with the 1st SS Infantry Brigade of the Waffen-SS, both providing support and undertaking independent killings. The brigade's report of 19 August to the Command Staff Reichsf√ºhrer-SS (SS operational staff set up for the invasion) noted that the battalion and the brigade jointly participated in \\"combat of gangs\\". During the massacre at Babi Yar, all three battalions of the regiment took part. The police cordoned off the area, while Sondercommando 4a and a platoon of Waffen-SS men did the shooting. The killing activities of both the Einsatzgruppen detachments and the Police Regiment South slowed down the farther the Wehrmacht advanced, as more Jews were able to escape east and the density of the pre-war Jewish population was lower in Eastern Ukraine. Nonetheless, the murder operations continued, targeting Jews, communists and \\"suspicious elements\\". In July 1942, the regiment was redesignated as the 10th Police Regiment. Aftermath The Order Police as a whole had not been declared a criminal organisation by the Allies, unlike the SS. Its members were able to reintegrate into society largely unmolested, with many returning to police careers in Austria and West Germany.

Found in Brazil, it was described as new to science in 2012. Taxonomy The type collection was made in Chapada dos Guimar√£es National Park, in the state of Mato Grosso. The specific epithet honours polypore specialist Leif Ryvarden. Description Morphological characteristics of this fungus include an irregular hymenophore, with relatively large pores numbering 1 to 3 per millimetre. The structure of the pore surface ranges from daedaloid (maze-like), to somewhat labyrinthic, to gill-like. This hymenophore irregularity helps distinguish it from the similar Daedalea stereoides. D. ryvardeniana also has larger spores, measuring 7.5‚Äì11.0 by 2.5‚Äì3.5 Œºm. The spores feature a unique central concavity next to the apiculum and a tapering tip. The fungus has a dimitic hyphal system, with thick-walled generative hyphae containing a winding lumen. Habitat and distribution The fungus, a saprophyte, grows on logs and fallen branches of angiosperms, in which it causes brown rot. It is found in dry and somewhat xerophytic areas in Caatinga and Cerrado ecosystems located in Cear√°, Para√≠ba, and Pernambuco States. It was later recorded in the Caatinga area of Bahia.

The Ahmarian culturehttps://books.google.com/books?id=KzZCDwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA129 was a Paleolithic archeological industry in Levant dated at 46,000-42,000 BP and thought to be related to Levantine Emiran and younger European Aurignacian cultures. The word ‚ÄúAhmarian‚Äù was adopted from the archaeological site of Erq el-Ahmar (also written Erk el Ahmar), Israel, a rockshelter in the Judean Desert in the northern Dead Sea Rift. It was explored and excavated by French Prehistorian Ren√© Neuville in 1951. The \\"Ahmarian\\" category had only been recognized since the 1980s, and was previously designated as \\"Phase II Upper Paleolithic\\" or \\"Ksar Akil Phase B\\". Ahmarian period The Ahmarian period together with the Emiran period, both from the Levant, are among the very first periods of the Upper Paleolithic, corresponding to the first stages of the expansion of Homo sapiens out of Africa. From this stage, the first modern humans migrated to Europe to form the beginning of the European Upper Paleolithic, including the Aurignacian culture, where they become known as the Cro-Magnons. The European Bohunician culture, probably linked to the Emiran and Ahmarian, may slightly predate the Ahmarian at 48,000 BP. There is also a claim that it is roughly contemporary with the Aurignacian and the Gravettian cultures of Europe, all emerging prior to the Atlitian, which was also contemporary with the Solutrean and Magdalenian cultures of Western Europe. The technical knowledge of the Ahmarian culture, along with the other lithic industries, is considered the likely source of the abrupt and rapid takeover of the world in all directions as evidenced by the crossing of the Bering Strait towards America. Ahmarian technology, which included the complex of blade/bladelet-knapping techniques is also linked to the tools used by the hunter-gatherers of southwestern Asia. Late Ahmarian is called Masraqan.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264357405_The_earlIer_Upper_Palaeolithic_a_VIew_from_The_Southern_Levant =Technology= Ahmarian blades are usually elongated with some curves. The Levallois technique is still in use, but only sparsely, thereby making Ahmarian the first fully Upper Paleolithic period. Ahmarian assemblages can be found throughout the Levant, including Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan. The Lagaman industry in the Sinai can be considered as derivative to the Ahmarian culture. \\"Levantine Aurignacian\\", from the Levant, is a type of blade technology very similar to the European Aurignacian, immediately following chronologically the Emiran and Early Ahmarian in the same area of the Near East, and closely related to them.

Early life and education= Family life = Born Pearl Alice Cooper, Peggy Cafritz belonged to one of the wealthiest African American families in Mobile, Alabama. She later changed her name legally to her childhood nickname, \\"Peggy.\\" The Cooper family gained their wealth through Peggy's father, Algernon Johnson Cooper Sr., who owned insurance and mortuary businesses across the state. Her father and mother, nee Gladys Mouton, were socially acquainted with famous jazz musician Duke Ellington, namesake of the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, which Cafritz would go on to co-found.Blum, Justin (May 21, 2002). \\"A Is for Activist: D.C. Schools President Peggy Cooper Cafritz Raises Her Hand\\". The Washington Post. p. C1. = Elementary school = Cafritz was raised Catholic in the segregated Jim Crow South. As a child, she attended a Catholic elementary school for Black children. Cafritz traces her love of art back to her childhood, at least to the age of seven or eight, when she was mesmerized by her parents' print of the painting Bottle and Fishes by Georges Braque, a French cubist. She studied it closely, rearranging elements of the painting in her head, and, as she got older, making up stories based on it. Her mother furthered this appreciation of visual art by having Cafritz sit with her and look through coffee table books on art. Around this time, she also developed a love of reading from both the library of children's books kept in the family room, as well as from sneaking into her father's private library, which was filled with classics of the Western canon as well as books by and about Black people. Reading James Baldwin's Notes of a Native Son as a child was a formative experience. It introduced her to the idea that one could both love the United States and criticize it, \\"a license which I would use for the rest of my life.\\" In the sixth grade, Cafritz had the opportunity to meet Martin Luther King Jr. With her father, she attended a talk King gave while promoting his book Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story. Afterward, Dr. King came to her family's home and signed a copy of his book for Cafritz, saying \\"that I should aspire to be a quiet, strategic leader like my dad.\\" At the age of 10, Cafritz was sent to a Catholic summer camp in Michigan, where she was the only Black camper. Her father sent here there knowingly, believing it was important for her to get to know the white world. There she was the only camper put into a cabin alone, and she faced racist pranks, such as when other campers would tell her her mother had to come to visit, only for Cafritz to encounter another camper's Black maid. When she called home crying, her father told her she needed to learn how to deal with such racism, because it would happen to her all her life. She was sent back there again the following year. = High school = After her father tried to enroll his eldest son in a whites-only Jesuit high school, Cafritz and her siblings were banned from attending their local Catholic high schools. Instead, she was sent to boarding school at the predominantly white Saint Mary's Academy in Indiana. In 1962, her junior year of high school, she met the family of Dr. Roland Wesley Chamblee and his wife, Dorothy. The Chamblees for years had welcomed many Black students into their home, where they had lively debates about religion, race, and morals. Cafritz credits the Chamblees for influencing not only \\"how I see formal art, but the beauty of my Black body, mind, and soul.\\" Her high school experience furthered her interest in art by providing her many field trips to Chicago, where they attended plays, symphonies, and art exhibits. The summer after graduating from high school, Cafritz and her friends decided to test the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which had recently been passed. They visited Mobile restaurants and, if the restaurant refused to serve them, they would report it to the Justice Department. When Cafritz and her friends buzzed for service at a drive-in restaurant, several white teenage boys approached their car, spat on them, threw soda through their car window, and jumped on the trunk and hood of the car, rocking it back and forth. Two police officers watched from nearby but did nothing. Cafritz and her friends were scared to drive away, afraid they would end up in prison if one of the boys on the car were injured, so they stayed inside the car until the boys left. Cafritz never spent another summer in Mobile. = College and law school = In 1964, during the civil rights movement, Cafritz moved to Washington, D.C. to attend George Washington University (GW). As soon as she arrived, she learned the school had not accepted very many Black students, and that segregation was still the norm there. She later wrote, \\"It almost made me happy. I just knew that I could use the skillset my father had forced me to develop to serve a great plate of change.\\" She began this work on the first day of orientation, when she joined with other Black students to try to join fraternities and sororities, a move that attracted the press, forcing the university to publicly speak about their segregated Greek system. \\"Thus began my career as an activist in D.C.,\\" she wrote. Whille at GW, she helped create the Black Student Union (then called the Black Peoples Union) and worked successfully for the integration of fraternities and sororities. Being in D.C. also gave her the opportunity to visit all the Smithsonian museums and take trips to New York City to visit museums there, as well. She discussed with her friends their shared frustration with the exclusion of Black people from the museum world as well as the performing arts and other cultural institutions. Cafritz went on to attend George Washington University Law School, and received her J.D. degree in 1971. After Cafritz's father died by suicide during her first year in law school, Cafritz took out a loan to keep her youngest brother in boarding school. She said her father's suicide stemmed from financial difficulties. Career Cafritz wanted to bring the money of the white people and the power of the black people in Washington, D.C., together in unity. = Early career = In 1972, Cafritz began work at Post-Newsweek stations, later renamed Graham Media Group, where she was an assistant to Harry Belafonte and M. Carl Holman, president of the National Urban Coalition. She also began making documentaries, a job in which she was tenacious. When she was unable to get an appointment to meet with the painter Jacob Lawrence for a documentary she wanted to make about him, she got his travel schedule and flew to Chicago‚Äôs O‚ÄôHare Airport, where she found him getting off a plane and convinced him to speak with her. The two became lifelong friends. In addition to working at Post-Newsweek, she also worked throughout the 1970s as a documentary producer for the D.C. television station WTOP (now WUSA) and as an arts reviewer at D.C.'s PBS affiliate, WETA. Over the course of this work, she earned both Emmy and Peabody awards. = Duke Ellington School of the Arts = In 1968, while still a student at GW, Cafritz chaired a Black Arts Festival, sponsored by the Black Peoples Union and held in partnership with DC Public Schools and the city‚Äôs Parks and Recreation department. The festival gave city kids an opportunity to be both participants and performers in the arts, while interacting with Black professionals who exposed them to a variety of career paths. One such professional was Emmett J. Rice, future head of the Federal Reserve, and his wife Lois Rice, who served on the College Board and helped create the Pell Grant. While working on the festival, Cafritz became good friends with GW grad student and choregrapher Mike Malone. When she lamented to him that the students at the festival had some real talent and it was a shame they didn‚Äôt have the training to further that talent, the two friends decided to start a school. When she told her father of the plan, he encouraged her to keep the goal a secret so no one could tell them ‚Äúno.\\" Cafritz turned that first festival into a regular summer arts festival. The president of GW, Lloyd H. Elliott, gave her free space at GW but asked her to fundraise for it, connecting her with one donor, who introduced her to others. In the program‚Äôs second year, their faculty included the Emmy-award-winning dancer Debbie Allen. Cafritz and Malone kept the summer festivals, renamed the Workshops for Careers in the Arts, focused on giving the least fortunate among D.C.‚Äôs students an opportunity for arts education they wouldn‚Äôt otherwise have. After six long years, they finally succeeded in opening the public magnet school Duke Ellington School of the Arts in Georgetown in 1974. It was modeled after New York City's High School of Performing Arts. Cafritz and Malone's goal was to start an arts-education program for local children who had shown promise but had no outlet to demonstrate their potential. Ellington was the only public high school in Washington, D.C., to train students with a curriculum in both academics and intensive professional arts training. Cafritz wanted students to defy the common art world belief that artists of color needed to eschew abstract art in favor of making narrative art that addressed inequality. Cafritz‚Äôs ultimate hope was for artists of color to have absolute freedom to make any art they chose, to continue on to higher education, and to take up leadership positions in the art world. Ellington alumni include Dave Chappelle, Denyce Graves, Hank Willis Thomas, and Meshell Ndegeocello. Ellington continued to be important to Cafritz for the rest of her life, and she took on several roles within the school and its fundraising organization, the Ellington Fund. Even years after the school was established, Cafritz wrote, \\"the overwhelming percentage of my energy was spent institutionalizing the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, so that it could permanently serve talented children in D.C., especially those who needed it most.\\" = Contributions to the Art World = Cafritz began her art collection in college by purchasing several pieces of African art brought back from the continent by members of Howard University's Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, some of whom had dropped out of college and supported themselves by reselling art they bought in Africa. Another person from whom she purchased art while still a student was Warren M. Robbins, whose collection of African art would later lead to the creation of the Smithsonian‚Äôs National Museum of African Art. Cafritz's relationship with Conrad Cafritz, who was born into wealth and was also a successful real estate developer, gave her the ability to become a serious art collector. She was critical of the lack of inclusion of and opportunity for Black artists in the mainstream American art world, and her interest in racial equity was linked to her values as an art collector. As she continued to visit museums, and got to know scores of young artists as they graduated from Ellington and fought to begin artistic careers, the more her interest in the arts became enmeshed with her values in the political and social arenas. She got involved in the political side of the arts, and she made it her ‚Äúpurpose that this nation face the absence, the erasure, the impermanence, the non-inclusion of African Americans in our cultural treasure.‚Äù In 1968, she became a founding member of the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities, which she also chaired from 1989 to 1999. In 1989 she became co-chair of the Smithsonian‚Äôs Cultural Equity Committee. She was the youngest trustee ever appointed to the American Film Institute. She joined the Painting and Sculpture Acquisitions Committee at the Whitney Museum of American Art. In 2009, a house fire destroyed her home in D.C.'s Kent neighborhood, ravaging the eight-bedroom architectural landmark where she held salons and kept her art collection, one of the largest private collections of African American and African art. Among those 300 works destroyed in the fire were works by Jacob Lawrence and Romare Bearden. She reached a settlement with the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority over the fire for their inadequate pressure in the hydrants. Cafritz moved to Dupont Circle in 2001 and continued to grow her collection. Included in the Cafritz collection is Carrie Mae Weems, El Anatsui, Chris Ofili, Mickalene Thomas, Glenn Ligon, Simone Leigh, Titus Kaphar, LaToya Ruby Frazier, William Villalongo, Tschabalala Self, Nathaniel Mary Quinn and Njideka Akunyili Crosby, whose work is featured on the cover of a 2018 book about Cafritz's collection. Upon her death, she bequeathed more than 250 works by Black artists to the Duke Ellington School of the Arts and over 400 to the Studio Museum in Harlem, marking the largest gift ever made of contemporary art by artists of African descent. Cafritz was the first collector for many visual artists and has sponsored many projects including Spike Lee's Malcolm X. = Other Positions and Accomplishments = In the 1970s she was the youngest fellow of Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Cafritz was DC school board president from 2000 to 2006.  Personal life  In Cafritz's 2018 book, she called her professional life ‚Äúspectacularly lucky‚Äù but her emotional life ‚Äútumultuous, sometimes tortured.‚Äù Shortly after graduating from law school, while living in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of D.C., she was ‚Äúbrutally raped‚Äù in her apartment. Seeking an emotional escape, she traveled to Europe with a friend. While walking alone in Paris, she was forced into an apartment and gang-raped. She returned to Washington ‚Äúan utter emotional wreck‚Äù and found comfort surrounded by her collection of African masks and other art. The comfort she received from art, she wrote, is one of the things that drove her art collecting, along with its social and cultural impact. In 1981, after living together for eight years, Cafritz married multimillionaire real estate executive Conrad Cafritz, son of the real estate developer and philanthropist Morris Cafritz.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/1990/02/25/cafritz- v-cafritz/9f486a14-9672-4802-802e-0e470a9f1507/ She was Catholic and he was Jewish. Together they had three children, the first of whom was born after the assistance of in vitro fertilization, made necessary by Cafritz's endometriosis. They adopted two other children. The couple divorced in 1998; in the divorce documents, Peggy said her husband had cheated on her and had contempt for her friends and family who were black. Cafritz had many mentees, unofficial foster children, and several godchildren, including Susan Rice and her brother, John. Cafritz was a prominent figure in the Washington, D.C. social scene, socializing with cultural and political figures including Quincy Jones, Gloria Steinem, Bill Clinton, Vernon Jordan, and Alma Powell. Cafritz died in Washington, D.C. on February 18, 2018, from complications from pneumonia after a period of declining health.

It was composed between 1908 and 1911.  Composition  After Bart√≥k's long-lasting depression following his participation in the Rubinstein Competition in Paris in 1906, he decided to embark on a great journey around rural Romania and Hungary, where he found great inspiration from peasant songs. During this journey, he wrote hundreds of pieces, some of which were published during this period. Many compositions from this period were either largely based on peasant and folk music or made from scratch trying to resemble folk music, as can be seen in other sets such as Three Hungarian Folktunes, Four Dirges, Ten Easy Pieces, and Fourteen Bagatelles. The composition of this set spanned this entire period. The first burlesque was composed in 1908; the third, in 1910; and the second, in 1911. It was published by R√≥zsav√∂lgyi soon after its completion, in 1912, and was republished by Boosey & Hawkes in 1950. Bart√≥k is known to have become particularly fond of this set. He decided to perform the second burlesque for recording in November 10, 1929, and later used this same burlesque in an orchestral set of arrangements of old peasant tunes entitled Hungarian Sketches. He asked again to perform the whole set for recording in 1944, when he was in New York but, unfortunately, this would never come true.  Structure  The set consists of three pieces. It has an overall approximate duration of 7 minutes. The movement list is as follows: The term burlesque, used as the title for the pieces in this set, is meant to mean short, lively pieces used as pantomimes, since the term was originally used in literature and theater. Here, social conventions and customs are meant to be exaggerated and parodied, That is, scenes that reflect human vicissitudes, both pleasant and unpleasant. Therefore, the harmonies in this piece are very dissonant and the rhythmic patterns are also jokingly lively.

A total of twelve Specials were built before the outbreak of the Second World War; it is a measure of the esteem in which they were held that 9 of these can be listed individually below. Background Allard had exhibited a keen interest in motor cars from a young age, and had taught himself how to drive by the age of sixteen. On completing his secondary education Sydney was found a job at F. W. Lucas Ltd., a garage and motor dealership, at first as a helper and then as a motor mechanic. He attended evening classes at Battersea Polytechnic and took a correspondence course in engineering, eventually becoming a member of the Institute of Automobile Engineers. Recognising his son's determination to pursue a career in motor engineering, Arthur Allard purchased a building in Keswick Road, Putney, and helped him to setup in business with Alf Brisco, who had been the head mechanic at F. W. Lucas. Allard's first competitive motor race had been with his brother Dennis at Brooklands in 1929, driving a Grand Prix Morgan three- wheeler in a three-lap handicap race, which they won. He subsequently converted the Morgan to four wheels in an attempt to increase its stability, but ultimately its low ground clearance made it unsuitable for trialling, one of Allard's great interests. Adlards Motors, as the new business was called, provided the workshop space to allow Allard to begin serious work on his competition specials. But Sydney's father disapproved of his son's competition activities, regarding them as a distraction from Adlard's regular garage work, so the specials sometimes had to be hidden from view under canvas at the back of the workshop. Each of the Allard Specials is identified by its registration number. 9 of the 12 are described here. The cars=CLK 5= CLK 5 taking part in the 1936 Land's End Trial CLK 5 was the first of Allard's specials, built almost entirely from a damaged 1934 Model 40 Ford V8 except for the bodywork, which came from a two-seater Bugatti. The steering box and column, and the petrol tank, were also cannibalised from the Bugatti. With a ground clearance of more than and plenty of low-speed torque from the Ford flathead V8 engine, CLK 5 was ideally suited for its role as a trials machine. So successful was CLK 5 that two more similar Allards were built. =FGP 750= FGP 750 was the first of the two CLK 5 copies.
