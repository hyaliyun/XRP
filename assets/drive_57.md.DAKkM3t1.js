History Richard Lloyd designed the game of StarMaster beginning in late 1979. Lloyd was involved as Game Designer for the next twelve years. In May 1992, Lloyd decided that the game had been putting unacceptable strain on his personal life and his \\"regular job\\" during that period, and decided with his colleague, Allen, to end the game for at least a year, without licensing the game to another company. In a note to StarMaster players in Paper Mayhem, a magazine for play-by-mail gamers, Lloyd left open the possibility of restarting the game as a fully computerized version in the future. Gameplay Starmaster was a strategic science fiction play-by-mail game that included space exploration, colonization of worlds, and diplomacy or combat with other races encountered. The premise of the game was that new races that achieve \\"faster-than-light\\" space travel would naturally explore and colonize neighbouring star systems, and eventually encounter other developing races. On a beginning player's first turn, the player was given 300 points to design a new race, with each physical advantage costing a certain number of points. (Fangs cost more than mandibles, which in turn cost more than teeth.) Players not wanting to try insectoid, reptile, avian or other exotic races could choose to start with a basic human costing 300 points; they could then customize the race by adding advanced abilities (telepathy for 90 points, for example), while removing ordinary human abilities in order to keep the racial score under 300 points. Other options included whether the race was hive mind, or organized into a caste system that included several very different life forms. The player would also make basic decisions about the size and climate of their home planet. Having established their race, the player's new home world was then placed near the edge of the galactic map, with other \\"new\\" races, so they would have a chance to explore nearby star systems in their \\"neighbourhood\\" before encountering some of the more experienced players closer to the galactic centre. Turns were moderated by a computer. The cost in 1980 was $10 for the rulebook and the first three turns. The cost of each subsequent turn was $2.50. However, since space battles, trade activities, colonies' actions and any special activities each counted as a turn, reviewer Bill Fawcett noted that \\"someone playing Starmaster actively for a year could shell out a small fortune.\\" In 1980, Starmaster had more than 2000 active players. Reception In the May-June 1980 edition of The Space Gamer (Issue No. 28), Jerry Epperson found the ongoing cost of the game to be high, but thought that \\"the game is worth the money; it is entertaining and well run. For many, however, money is better spent elsewhere. I recommend Starmaster to anyone who enjoys SF gaming and play-by-mail games.\\". In the October 1980 edition of Dragon (Issue 42), Bill Fawcett also found the cost per turn to be very high, and suggested that players with a tight budget should look elsewhere for a less expensive PBM game. But Fawcett found the game, and especially the race creation, \\"detailed, entertaining, and well- run... If the cost doesn‚Äôt deter you, the scope and potential variety promise hours of enjoyment. In the April 1983 edition of Dragon (Issue 72), Michael Gray stated \\"Hundreds of people play this game, all in the same galaxy. As with almost all ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù PBM role-playing games, there is no turn deadline. Schubel & Son puts out a Star Master newsletter with all sorts of information about the game, such as strategy tips, news of great alliances, and reports of warfare.\\" See also List of play-by-mail games References Play-by-mail games ","title":"Starmaster (play-by-mail game)"},{"id":"55396402","text":"Events from the year 1921 in Italy.

Gameplay Swordquest is a two- or three-player game in which good, evil and druidic forces search the towns of the land of Tirrane, hoping to find a lost artifact. The designer, R. Vance Buck, wrote in the design notes that he drew heavily upon J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings (LotR) for inspiration: the gameworld is peopled with dwarves, elves, a large dragon, and winged creatures named Wrogs that resemble Tolkien's balrogs. Reviewer Tony Watson noted that the gameplay is also very similar to LotR: a good team led by a white wizard and an evil team led by a sorcerer search for a lost artifact -- in this case, the Sword of Lumina. As in LotR, the good team wants to destroy the artifact in fires found near the evil citadel, while the evil team wants to possess and use the artifact. An optional rule allows a third player to control a team of druids, who seek to possess the sword in order to restore balance between good and evil. The combat resolution system uses a ritualized form of engagement of up to five opponents per side. There are some magical spells in the game, found on scrolls in the cities of the land. Players search the lands for the sword. There are three sword counters, two of which represent counterfeit swords. The player who can get the genuine sword back to his citadel wins the game. Reception Reviewers were unimpressed by Swordquest. John Lambshead reviewed Swordquest for White Dwarf #18, giving it an overall rating of 6 out of 10, and stated that \\"In fact the whole game lacks colour. Players have identical forces and identical victory conditions. I can't see this appealing to the involved fantasy gamer.\\" In the May-June 1980 edition of The Space Gamer (Issue No. 28), Bruce Campbell could not recommend the game: \\"Swordquest has enough good points that I don't feel my money was wasted. However, better games are available for less money, so I don't recommend it for any category of gamer.\\" In the July 1981 edition (Issue 41), David Ladyman was similarly unenthused with an updated version of the game, finding many problems with the rules. \\"Swordquest, in many ways, is a nice game, at a reasonable price. It is not too complex for the new gamer, at which it is primarily aimed. I wish I could recommend it. If you don't mind composing rules as you play, you might check it out.\\" In the August 1980 edition of Dragon (Issue 40), Tony Watson complained that the game setup and abilities of both sides had been so scrupulously balanced that \\"Both sides are too much the same. Adam the White [the good wizard] is no different from Shaymar [the evil sorcerer]. Each side uses the same spells; there is no diversity among 'good' and 'evil' magic. A similar situation exists with the game‚Äôs monsters... the only differences between them are their beginning combat levels and the number of wounds they can take; no unique qualities, no special abilities that could have easily added a lot to the game.\\" Watson also noted that due to the movement rules and the fact that all hidden counters are in towns, \\"action concentrates around the towns and roads, ignoring the map‚Äôs considerable wilderness area.\\" References Board games introduced in 1979 Task Force Games games ","title":"Swordquest (board game)"},{"id":"55396536","text":"Chen Qingying (Chinese ÈôàÂ∫ÜËã±, Pinyin Ch√©n Q√¨ngyƒ´ng ; born 21 October 1941 in Nanchong, Sichuan, Republic of China (1912‚Äì1949) [1]), is a Chinese tibetologist.John Powers, The Buddha Party: How the People's Republic of China Works to Define and Control Tibetan Buddhism, Oxford University Press, 2016, 370 pages, p. 9: \\"Chen Qingying and Wang Xiangyun, two Chinese tibetologists.\\" He is the director of the History Research Institute under the China Tibetology Research Center (Zhongguo Zangxue yanjiu zhongxin).

The Amiri Press or Amiria Press () (Al-Matba'a al-Amiriya) (also known as the Bulaq Press () due to its original location in Bulaq) is a printing press, and one of the main agencies with which Muhammad Ali Pasha modernized Egypt. The Amiria Press had a profound effect on Egyptian literature and intellectual life in the country and in the greater region, as scientific works in European languages were translated into Arabic.  History  A lithography stamp at the Bulaq Press. Wooden letter blocks used at the Bulaq Press in 1820. The Amiria Press was established in 1820 and opened officially during the reign of Muhammad Ali Pasha in 1821. At first, it published military books for the Egyptian army, but it soon developed and started to print literary books, science books, and textbooks. It was also Cairo's most active and important Turkish-language press. In October 1862, Muhammad Sa'id Pasha gave the press to Abdurrahman Bik Rushdi. It was then purchased by Isma'il Pasha who added it to the Da'ira Sunnia (ÿßŸÑÿØÿßÿ¶ÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÜŸäÿ©), or the royal possessions. Publications in this time included a Quran with commentary by Al-Zamakhshari.Brockett, Adrian Alan, Studies in two transmissions of the Qur'an, p11 The Amiria Press returned to the possession of the state in 1880, during the reign of Tewfik Pasha. A typeface developed by the Amiri Press in 1905 served as the primary inspiration for the Amiri font, a naskh script designed by Dr. Khaled Hosny for typesetting body text. In 1924 they published the iconic 1342 Cairo text. A large number of pre-1924 Qurans were destroyed by dumping them in the River Nile.Reynolds, GS Introduction: Qur‚Äôanic studies and its controversies On August 13, 1956, Gamal Abdel Nasser passed Law 312 of 1956 ordering the establishment of the Amiria Press Authority under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Trade & Industry. The first meeting of its administration‚Äîheaded by the Ministry of Trade and Industry's administrator at the time, Aziz Sedky‚Äîwas held on September 1, 1956. The ministry later decided to build a new 35,000 m2 building for the Amiria Press Authority, and equip it with state-of- the-art printing technology to spread its messages. The Amiria Press Authority officially began operations at its new location on July 28, 1973 during the Sadat administration under Ibrahim Salem Muhammadin, Minister of Trade and Industry at the time.

Today Westermarsch I is a part of the East Frisian borough of Norden with about 450 inhabitants (as at 12/2016),Norden.de: Einwohnerzahl nach Ortsteilen spread over an area of 19.42 km¬≤.Norden.de: Ortsteile der Stadt Norden  Name  The name Westermarsch I denotes the place as being in the west of the marshlands in the historical region of Norderland (see Ostermarsch). The Roman numeral in the name of the village distinguishes the former communal municipality (Kommunalgemeinde) from the neighbouring village of Westermarsch II.  Structure, location and communication  As a marsh village, Westermarsch I is characterized by large- scale farming. Within the municipality there are not only isolated Gulf farmhouses, but there are several larger settlements. These include Mittelmarsch, Altendeich and Westermarscherloog. Westermarsch I is bordered to the east by the town of Norden and to the north by Westermarsch II. The North Sea coast forms its natural boundary in the west and the watercourse of the Norder Tief as well as the Norden subdivision of Neuwesteel to the south. The Landesstra√üe 27 connects Westermarsch I with the town of Norden and sea port of Greetsiel. Kreisstra√üe 214 runs from Westermarsch I to Norddeich.  History  The construction of the Fokko Ukena Dyke began in 1425 as part of the dyking of the so-called Westermarsch Neulande (\\"new lands\\"). Until then, as everywhere else in the marshlands, people had built warfts to protect the inhabitants of the Neulande from the sea. The most significant source about the history of the village is the Altendeich School Chronicle (Altendeicher Schulchronik), whose oldest sections date back to 1622 and which, in addition to the development of the school, also describe the history of the place. According to this source, a teacher was already being employed in 1622 to teach the children of farmers and householders. Further data and facts, which are listed in the chronicle, include: * c. 1771, a large cattle epidemic raged in Westermarsch, which led to great economic hardship for the village's population of about 600 * A brickyard with a furnace capacity of some 20,000 bricks was erected on today's Kreisstra√üe 214 in 1774. It lasted until the 1970s. Three years later a sugar feeder was built. * After a dyke burst in 1825, large parts of the village were devastated. * The first regular transport link from Westermarsch to the town of Norden was built between 1873 and 1875. Before this link was built, both large and small various water courses were used as transport routes between the two towns due poor and unreliable road conditions. On 1 July 1972 the municipality of Westermarsch I was incorporated into the borough of Norden.  Religion and social  Well over 90% of the Westermarsch population belong to the Evangelical-Lutheran Church, St. Andrew's Church in Gottfried-Keller-Stra√üe. About 3% are members of the Evangelical free churches. Around 1% are Roman Catholic. There are no church buildings in Westermarsch I. The various church members have always been looked after by Norden. For several years church services were held in the village halls. A ladies group meets there regularly. The AWO playschool meets next to the village hall in an old school. An even older school, which became a nationally known bar after its closure, is today a victim of dilapidation.750 Jahre Norden 1255‚Äì2005: Geschichte Nordener Schulen  Literature and sources  * Karl Leiner: Panorama Landkreis Norden, Norden 1972, pp. 469ff.

The song was written by Jim Lea, Noddy Holder, Don Powell and Dave Hill, and produced by Chas Chandler. It failed to make an appearance in the UK charts. Background After their 1969 debut, Beginnings failed to break the band, then known as Ambrose Slade, into the UK charts, their new manager Chas Chandler encouraged them to begin writing their own material. He also believed they would benefit from a new look and the band soon adopted a skinhead image. Coinciding with this new image, Ambrose Slade changed their name to \\"The Slade\\" and released the failed single \\"Wild Winds Are Blowing\\" in October 1969. \\"Shape of Things to Come\\" followed in March 1970, but again failed to chart. With this, Chandler moved the band from Fontana to Polydor Records, believing a higher profile label would boost sales. The band then began recording material for their second studio album Play It Loud.Beginnings/Play It Loud - 2006 Salvo remaster booklet liner notes The band's Polydor debut, \\"Know Who You Are\\", was released in September 1970, but was also a commercial failure, as was Play It Loud when it was released in November. Lead vocalist Noddy Holder, in his 1999 biography, recalled of the song's failure: \\"When it didn't make the charts, frustration started to set in. We couldn't understand why we weren't more popular by then. We had been with Chas for two years, slogging our guts out and still we hadn't had a hit.\\" Speaking to Goodtimes Magazine in 2015, bassist Jim Lea recalled: \\"We had no hits. Songs such as \\"Know Who You Are\\" or \\"Shape of Things to Come\\" were played on the radio only very infrequently.\\" Afterwards, the band dropped their skinhead image and would achieve their commercial breakthrough with their mid-1971 single \\"Get Down and Get with It\\". \\"Know Who You Are\\" developed from the band's 1969 track \\"Genesis\\", which was an instrumental written by the band and released as a single from Beginnings. During sessions for Play It Loud, the band revisited the song, with drummer Don Powell writing the lyrics. In his 2013 biography, Powell recalled: \\"\\"Know Who You Are\\" is the same as our old instrumental \\"Genesis\\", so Nod and Dave are credited for that one as well as Jim and myself. I wrote the lyrics for it and some of them are about Dave. I don't know how it came about, but the first line that I came up with was \\"H, old babe, sing a song to make out that your playing is easy.\\"\\" Release \\"Know Who You Are\\" was released on 7\\" vinyl by Polydor Records in the UK only. The B-side, \\"Dapple Rose\\", was written by Lea and Powell. Also included on Play It Loud, Powell recalled of his lyrics in a 2009 fan forum interview: \\"I've always had a fondness for horses and where I lived with my parents there were some fields over the back and there were always gypsies camping there. They used to have these horses and donkeys and they always looked dead to me. They were not looked after which was sad.\\" Following its lack of success, \\"Know Who You Are\\" was quickly deleted by Polydor and has since become a collector's item. The Rare Record Price Guide of 2014 valued the single at ¬£80. The song later received greater recognition when a live version was included on Slade Alive!, which became the band's first hit album when released in 1972. In addition, the original studio version was included on the 1973 compilation album Sladest, which topped the UK charts. Promotion The band appeared on the UK show Disco 2 to perform \\"Know Who You Are\\" and the Play It Loud track \\"Sweet Box\\". The performance was broadcast on 31 October 1970. Only a few performances from the show are known to survive, with Slade's performance having not been seen since its original airing.http://urthepob.byethost24.com/rock/RockOnTV70.html The band also performed the song during a BBC studio session around the same time. Track listing ;7\\" Single #\\"Know Who You Are\\" - 2:53 #\\"Dapple Rose\\" - 3:31 Critical reception Upon release, New Musical Express said: \\"A powerful item from the skinhead group, making its Polydor debut. The lyric is forcefully delivered, virtually snarled at times. It's a hard-hitting piece of philosophy with a walloping beat, which explodes into a wall of sound in the title hook. Insistent and gripping, but limited in its appeal.\\"New Musical Express - 19 September 1970 - Singles reviews Record Mirror felt the song had \\"chart chance\\" and commented: \\"Chas Chandler, ex-Animal bassist, states categorically that this group will make it. But then he's said that before. About Jimi Hendrix. Lost momentarily in a skin-head scene, this group is basically most musicianly. This is a strange, staccato sort of production... lead voice stamping, as in bovver boots, on the lyrics. Stark simplicity behind. The effect is very good indeed. Darned near slayed me.\\"Record Mirror - 26 September 1970 - Singles reviews In a review of Play It Loud, New Musical Express noted: \\"Aggressive - that's what the music and vocalising of Slade seems to be, though they vary the volume with great skill, at times quiet, then turning it up and shouting at the listener as in \\"Know Who You Are\\".\\"New Musical Express - 19 December 1970 - Album reviews Joe Viglione of AllMusic retrospectively said: \\"\\"Know Who You Are\\" is a wonderful study here; the band is more proper dipping into that Yardbirds bag again on this original. By the time it was re-released on Slade Alive, only two years later, the song would become part of their glam success. But here, Noddy Holder is kept on key by Chas Chandler, and that restraint makes for an intelligent album of rock which draws from all of the aforementioned sources, Ten Years After, Sabbath, The Move, Yardbirds, as well as the Beatles, Steppenwolf, and Kaleidoscope U.K.\\" Dave Swanson of Ultimate Classic Rock commented: \\"\\"Know Who You Are\\" kicks off side two and remains one of the band's finest-ever songs. Showing off the band well on the way to their definitive sound, it's a Slade classic loaded with that dynamic tension the band would explore to greater success within the next year.\\" In a review of Slade Alive!, Stephen Cook of AllMusic described the song as \\"MC5-esque\\". In a review of Sladest, Gramophone said: \\"The historians are sure to be thrilled when hearing their initial recordings for the Fontana label and their first Polydor efforts, such as \\"Know Who You Are\\"...\\" Terry Staunton of Record Collector stated: \\"In addition to the hits they‚Äôd already amassed, the album showcases a few of the ones that got away, such as the Quo- like boogie of \\"Know Who You Are\\".\\" Personnel ;Slade *Noddy Holder - lead vocals, guitar *Dave Hill - lead guitar, backing vocals *Jim Lea - bass, backing vocals *Don Powell - drums ;Additional personnel *Chas Chandler - producer References 1970 singles 1970 songs Slade songs Song recordings produced by Chas Chandler Polydor Records singles Songs written by Noddy Holder Songs written by Jim Lea ","title":"Know Who You Are"},{"id":"55396843","text":"Ecovia Intelligence (formerly Organic Monitor) is a specialist research, consulting & training company that focuses on the global organic & related product industries.

Dudenhoeffer, 573 U.S. ___ (2014), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court found Employee stockownership (ESOP) fiduciaries have the same prudential duties as non-ESOP fiduciaries, as set by ERISA, except that they are not required to diversify their investments beyond shares of the employer's stock.  Background  Fifth Third Bancorp, a large financial services company, maintained a defined contribution retirement plan / 401(k) (specifically an Employee stock ownership (ESOP)) for its employees. In September 2009, a group of its former employees and current 401(k) participants file a class action lawsuit against Fifth Third and its corporate officers (in their capacity as administrators of the 401(k)), alleging that they violated their ERISA-mandated fiduciary duty under ERISA. Specifically, the employees alleged that Fifth Third and its officers should have known that Fifth Third's stock was overvalued. Per the complaint, the stock was overvalued due to the firm's involvement in risky subprime lending and that officers had made material misstatements about the company's financial prospects to inflate the value of the company's stock. The employees alleged that a prudent fiduciary acting in good faith stewards of the ESOP's assets should have taken steps to address this overvaluation or protect the plan participants from the risks. Instead, they continued to buy and hold Fifth Third stock until the market crashed in July 2007, wiping out over 3/4ths of the company's stock value and leaving the plaintiffs destitute.  In lower courts  The lawsuit, which was filed in the Southern District Court of Ohio, was originally dismissed by that court. The District Court ruled that the 401(k) plan administrators were entitled to a 'presumption of prudence' with respect to their decision to continue buying and holding their own company's stock. The Sixth Circuit reversed the District Court, ruling that additional evidence would be needed before a court could rule on whether the 'presumption of prudence' should apply. First Third appealed the Sixth Circuit's decision to the US Supreme Court in December 2012.  Supreme Court opinion  The Supreme Court vacated the Sixth Circuit's ruling and remanded the case back to the lower courts for further reconsideration. Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Stephen Breyer determined that administrators of ESOPs are not entitled to a special 'presumption of prudence' with respect to their decision-making. Rather, they are held to the same legal standard of care as any other fiduciary under ERISA. The Supreme Court accepted the petitioners' argument that allowing lawsuits against ESOP fiduciaries may discourage employers from offering ESOP plans in the first place (thus contravening Congress's intent), but resolved the dilemma by creating guidelines for lower courts to apply in future cases at the motion to dismiss stage.

In 1628 Hudson graduated from Queen's College, Oxford with an M.A, and became fellow c. 1630. King Charles I gave him various livings; and he was one of the king's chaplains at Oxford. He was scoutmaster to the northern army (1643‚Äì1644) and, along with John Ashburnham, accompanied Charles I to Newark in 1646. At the end of the First English Civil War he was imprisoned. He escaped from prison, but was again captured, 1647, and sent to the Tower of London. In 1648 he escaped again, and promoted a royalist rising in the eastern counties where he was killed while defending Woodcroft Castle. Biography Hudson was born in Westmoreland in 1605, cites Reg. Matric. Oxon. fol. 87 b. and in February 1622 became a \\"poor child\\" and subsequently tabarder of Queen's College, Oxford. He proceeded B.A. in February 1625, and M.A. in January 1628. cites Wood, Fasti Oxon. ed. Bliss, iv. 422, 441. It seems doubtful that he is identical with the Michael Hudson who matriculated from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, 3 July 1623. About 1630 he was elected a fellow of Queen's College, Oxford, married, and was for a time tutor to Charles, Prince of Wales (later Charles II). He was ordained as a priest in 1632 by John Bancroft, Bishop of Oxford. He was rector of Uffington, Lincolnshire, and of Market Bosworth, Leicestershire, but seems to have assigned the former on 19 March 1641 to Thomas South in exchange for the rectory of King's Cliffe, Northamptonshire. Both South and Hudson were sequestrated from the living of Uffington by the Parliamentarian (Roundhead) general Edward Montagu, Earl of Manchester 31 December 1644. On 20 January 1645 he was ejected by the Earl of Manchester from the living at Uffington, on the evidence of four witnesses. On the outbreak of the English Civil War Hudson had joined the Royalists (Cavaliers), and after the Battle of Edgehill (23 October 1642) retired to Oxford, where he was brought into contact with the king, was made one of the royal chaplains, and received a Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) in February 1643. cites Wood, Fasti Oxon. ed. Bliss, iv. 55. His want of reserve and bluntness caused Charles I to nickname him his plain- dealing chaplain. Hudson's known fidelity led to his appointment as scout- master to the army in the northern parts of England, then under the command of the Marquis of Newcastle, a position which he occupied till 1644. In April 1646, when Charles I determined to entrust his person to the Scots army, he chose Hudson and John Ashburnham to conduct him to the Scottish army camp at Newark-on-Trent. Parliament, on 23 May 1646, consequently despatched a serjeant-at-arms for his arrest, but the Scots refused to give him up, cites Rushworth, vi. 271. and after a few days' confinement released him. Shortly afterwards, while endeavouring to reach France, he was arrested at Sandwich, Kent (7 June 1646) and was imprisoned in London House. On 18 June 1646 Hudson was examined by a committee of Parliament, when he detailed the wanderings of the king between Oxford and the Scots camp, On 18 November he escaped, and is said, cites Whitelocke, Memorials of English Affairs, p. 237. to have conveyed letters from the king to Major-general Rowland Laugharne in Wales. In the following January he was again captured at Hull and was imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he was not allowed to see any one except in the presence of a keeper. Here he chiefly employed himself in writing and in perfecting a project to deliver the Tower into royalist hands, which he was unable to put into execution. He again escaped early in 1648 in disguise with a basket of apples on his head. Hudson returned to Lincolnshire where he raised a party of Royalist horse (cavalry) and stirred up the gentry of Norfolk and Suffolk to more activity on the King's side. With the chief body of those who had taken arms under his command, Hudson retired to Woodcroft Castle in the Soke of Peterborough, a strong building surrounded by a moat, where they were speedily attacked by a body of parliamentary soldiery. Hudson, who is believed to have borne a commission as a colonel, defended the house with great courage, and when the doors were forced, went with the remnant of his followers to the battlements, and only yielded on promise of quarter, which was afterwards refused. Hudson was flung over the battlements, but managed to support himself upon a spout or projecting stone until his hands were cut off, when he fell into the moat. In reply to his request to be allowed to die on land, a man, named Egborough, knocked him on the head with a musket (6 June 1648), while another parliamentarian cut out his tongue and carried it about as a trophy. His body was buried at Denton, Northamptonshire. A proposal to reinter it at Uffington does not seem to have been carried out. Family Hudson married in 1633 Elizabeth Pollard of Newnham Courtney, Oxfordshire. He lost by the rebellion the whole of his estates, and after his death his wife and children were supported by charity. Character Augustus Charles Bickley, Hudson's biographer in the Dictionary of National Biography (1895) wrote \\"His boldness, generosity, and almost fanatical loyalty are undoubted\\". John Walker wrote he was a scholar and a plain and upright Christian. cites .

Libris 11931231 Biography Lovisa Mathilda Roos was born 2 August 1852, in Stockholm. Her parents were Malte Leopold Roos (1806-1882), a major at Svea Artillery Regiment, and Mathilda (Tilda) Beata Meurk (born 1821). She was educated at home and at √Öhlinska skolan. Remaining unmarried, she lived with his sister Anna and sometimes also with Laura Fitinghoff, with whom she built the Furuliden house in Stocksund, which later became, as she had hoped, a rest home for women. Roos' novels usually dealt with women's issues and misconduct in society. She was not afraid to address sensitive subjects at that time including lesbian love in Den f√∂rsta k√§rleken (The First Love). A religious crisis in the 1880s affected her later books. In the novel Hvit ljung (White Lung), she takes up the unclear living conditions of a teacher and rape. This is considered to have contributed to a government decision that greatly improved teachers' salaries. In women's political pamphlets, she addressed Ellen Key's ideas, Ett ord till fr√∂ken Ellen Key och till den svenska kvinnan (A word to Miss Ellen Key and to the Swedish woman), 1896.

Description Sandinista lanceolatum is a relatively small spider compared to many other Central America tarantulas. For a pair of Costa Rican specimens, the author Carlos Valerio described a few select attributes such as cephalothorax less than 18 mm long: being 14 mm in his holotype male and 16 mm in the paratype female. Valerio also indicated that the fourth leg is the longest: 43 mm in the holotype male and 54 mm in the paratype female. The body and legs are covered with reddish brown hairs (setae). The \\"brush\\" of hairs (scopula) on the metatarsus of the fourth leg is short, limited to the distal third. The male's palpal bulb is less than 4 mm long; the spermatheca of the female is of slightly less width. Females have larger chelicerae than males . Such attributes are generally not considered as useful subsequent works, for example with males since shown to be highly variable, i.e. see Longhorn and Gabriel 2019. Taxonomy The taxonomic history of this species is somewhat tangled. As now understood, it was first described by Eug√®ne Simon in 1891 as Eurypelma lanceolatum. Under this name it was transferred to the genus Aphonopelma as Aphonopelma lanceolatum in 1993. Separately, in 1980, Carlos Valerio described a species as Brachypelma fossoria, with the specific name referring to the \\"fossorial\\" or burrowing habits of the species. The specific name was amended to fossorium by G√ºnter Schmidt in 1992, as Brachypelma is neuter in gender. In 2019, Stuart Longhorn and Ray Gabriel synonymized Brachypelma fossoria with Aphonopelma lanceolatum, and transferred the species to the new genus Sandinista. In 2020, Jorge Mendoza and Oscar Francke transferred Brachypelma fossoria to the genus Stichoplastoris, without recognizing the synonymy with Sandinista lanceolatum. , the World Spider Catalog uses the name Sandinista lanceolatum. Distribution and habitat Sandinista lanceolatum is found in the Guanacaste Province in Costa Rica in the north-west Pacific lowlands, and several Departments of Nicaragua in similar Western lowlands. It is found in grasslands in dry tropical areas. The female described by Valerio was collected from a horizontal burrow which it shared with several juveniles. The relatively large chelicerae of the females may be connected to their burrowing habit. Conservation All species of Brachypelma, then including Sandinista lanceolatum as B. fossorium, were placed on CITES Appendix II in 1994, thus restricting trade.

After an early career as a merchant that gained him substantial wealth, he began his political career in 1439. His ascent to higher offices was rapid. He is chiefly remembered for his advocacy of a decisive policy against the Ottoman Empire, and his command of Venetian forces as Captain General of the Sea during the lead-up to and the first stages of the First Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War. Origin and early life Vettore Cappello was born to Giorgio Cappello and Coronea Lando. The date of his birth is unknown; his epitaph records that he died at the age of 63, but when he was inscribed at the Balla d'Oro in 1420, he is recorded as being twenty years of age, and serving as a sailor in the trade convoy to Alexandria. His family was engaged in commerce, and Vettore appears to have been active in his family's commercial interests: along with his brothers, he maintained agents at Bruges and London for a decade from 1431 on, and he was patrono (responsible for the equipping and manning of a trade galley) in the muda (annual trade convoy) to Flanders in the years 1428, 1438, and 1441. In 1436 he married Lucia Querini, daughter of Marco, with whom he had six children: Andrea, Lorenzo, Paolo, Alvise, Elena and Paolina. Political and military career Cappello began his political career in October 1439, when he was elected to the savii agli Ordini (commissioners on naval matters). Cappello held the same office again in October 1440 ‚Äì March 1441, then was member of the Ragion Nuove office in 1442, and captain of the trade convoy to Romania (Constantinople and the Black Sea) in 1443. In 1442‚Äì1443 he was also elected to various other offices that he did not carry out: captain of the convoys to Modon and the Barbary Coast, and sopracomito (galley captain) in the guard fleet of the Gulf (the Adriatic Sea). In spring 1444 he commanded the two galleys that brought to Venice , the bride-to-be of Leonello d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara. In August 1444 and again in the next year, he was elected to the Venetian Senate, and in 1447 to the Council of Ten. In September 1448 he was elected to the zonta (extraordinary commission) of the Ten, and served in the Senate until March 1449, when he was elected Captain of the Gulf. Captain of the Gulf On 7 April he was given his orders, which initially included the usual tasks of patrolling the Adriatic. However, events elsewhere soon changed his mission. On 26 April, he received new instructions to proceed with the annexation of the County Palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos, whose cession from the ruling Tocco family was being negotiated. Soon after he arrived at Corfu, however, the Republic reversed course, fearing a lasting military commitment against the Ottoman Turks, and decided to simply establish a Venetian protectorate over the Tocco domains, rather than annex them. Indeed, the Tocco representative, Giacomo Rosso, repeatedly asked for the aid of Cappello's fleet against the Turks, but was rebuffed, in part because Cappello was engaged in the brief conflict that had broken out between Venice and the King of Naples, Alfonso of Aragon, in July. Cappello's actions during the war are not well known; at the start of the conflict, when the new Captain General of the Sea, Alvise Loredan, was still in Venice, he conducted raids against the Neapolitan shores, but in August he was ordered to keep watch over the entry of the Straits of Otranto and prohibit any Aragonese vessels from operating in the area. He was then ordered to join with Loredan in conducting an attack on Messina. In September and November he was sent to escort the returning Flanders trade convoy. Although the Senate decided to extend his mission in early December, by mid-December he had returned with his ships to Venice and demobilized them. Service in Lombardy and the councils of Venice In February 1450, he was re-elected as Captain of the Gulf, but did not take up his duties, and was replaced. With a resumption of the long-standing conflict with the Duchy of Milan being imminent, in May Cappello was sent as capitano (military commander) of Brescia, and was active in restoring its fortifications and preparing its defence. In December he participated in a meeting with the other Venetian governors of the mainland at Crema, to coordinate the defence of the border towards the Adda River and the Bergamasco. In April‚ÄìSeptember 1451 he was active in repairing the fortifications of Asola, supplying Rivalta with men and ammunition, ensuring Brescia's provisions in grain and ammunition, and ensuring the regular payment of the soldiers to reduce desertions. From October 1451 to February 1452, and again from January to June 1453, he served as one of the savii di Terraferma (commissioners on the Terraferma). In August and December 1453, he was re- elected to the post, but both times refused it, and served instead from August 1453 to February 1454 as provveditore of the Venetian Arsenal; in the troubled atmosphere following the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans, Cappello busied himself with rearming the Venetian fleet. A savio \\"recuperandi pecunias\\" of the same name is attested in November 1453 ‚Äì May 1454 and a provveditore of the army with the same name was appointed to Brescia in February 1454, but is doubtful whether they are the same person as Cappello. Embassy to the Morea The Eastern Mediterranean in 1450, just before the Fall of Constantinople. Venetian possessions are in green and red. Within a decade, Ottoman dominions expanded to include the Byzantine Empire (purple) and most of the smaller Balkan states. The news of the Fall of Constantinople caused a widespread rebellion to break out in the Despotate of the Morea among the local Albanian population against the weak rule of the brothers Thomas and Demetrios Palaiologos. The Albanians appealed to Venice and offered to submit to its rule, which the Senate initially accepted; however, as a Venetian military presence in the Morea was sure to invite Ottoman invasion, the Venetians reconsidered their options, and on 21 June 1454 Cappello was appointed as ambassador to the Morea, and tasked with restoring peace between the Despots and their Albanian subjects, as well as to examine reported violations of Venetian rights and of the Republic's territories in the Morea (Modon, Coron, and Nauplia) by Thomas Palaiologos. Venetian suspicions of Genoese naval activity in the area also led to suggestions to try to secure various port towns‚ÄîPatras, Vostitsa, Glarentsa, and Corinth‚Äîfor Venice, to prevent them from coming under the control of \\"another maritime power\\", but this proposal failed to pass in the Senate. Cappello arrived in Venice and began visiting the warring parties in an effort to reconcile them, but in the event, the revolt was ended through the intervention of the Ottoman warlord Turahan Bey in October 1454, who forced the Albanians to submit, and restored the feeble authority of the two Despots. The Senate was left with nothing to do but order Cappello to return to Venice, which he died in February 1455. Embassy to Rome Cappello is next attested on 15 September 1458, when he was selected as one of four ambassadors to the newly elected Pope Julius II. Their mission was delicate, as, aside from conveying the usual messages of congratulation, the envoys were charged with representing the Republic's positions on the location of a general congress of the Christian powers for a coordinated attack on the Ottomans, that the new Pope intended to convene. Mantua as well as Udine, a Venetian city, were proposed, but the Republic considered this as calamitous in view of its diplomatic and commercial relations with the Ottoman Empire. The ambassadors left for Rome in early November, but by that time, the Pope had already decided for Mantua. While two of the ambassadors stayed on to discuss other matters, Cappello and Triadano Gritti were recalled in late November to Venice. In May 1459, Cappello was elected to the governatori alle Entrate (magistrates of revenue). In December and again in January 1460 he was likely ‚Äì unless it was a namesake ‚Äì member of the zonta of the Council of Ten convened to judge the Venetian envoys to the Congress of Mantua. First tenure as Captain General of the Sea On 22 February 1461, he was elected Captain General of the Sea. At the time, he was in all likelihood a member of the Council of Ten. During his tenure, Cappello presided over a tense situation in the Aegean Sea. Following the conquest of the Despotate of the Morea in 1460, Ottoman pressure on the Venetian possessions of Modon and Coron increased, with raids being launched against them by Turkish forces in February 1461. Nevertheless the Republic was anxious to avoid war, and his instructions were specific to that intent. Accordingly he was limited to ensuring the safety of the Venetian possessions, and that the Ottoman fleet did not leave the Dardanelles, although he was free to engage the light fusta vessels that the Turks used to conduct piracy in the Aegean. Even when the Ottomans occupied Lesbos in September 1462, Cappello, heeding his instructions, refused to answer the repeated calls for aid and observed events from Chios. The Senate sent him a letter of approbation. Cappello did nevertheless take care to prepare for the oncoming conflict by overseeing the reinforcement of fortifications in Coron, Modon, Nauplia, Lepanto, and Negroponte, until his tenure expired in November. On his return to Venice, he brought with him the head of Saint George, which the inhabitants of the island of Aegina had given him for safe keeping. Member of the College and outbreak of the First Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War Shortly after his return to Venice on 13 December, Cappello became a member of the Full College, inaugurating an almost uninterrupted period of over three years where he was a member of that body and participated in the most important deliberations of the Venetian government. He served as savio grande in January‚ÄìJune 1463 and again in October 1463 ‚Äì March 1464, then as ducal councillor from July 1464 ‚Äì May 1465, and member of the Ten from September 1465. The main issue facing the Republic during this time was the response to Ottoman expansion. A conflict was considered inevitable, but the interruption to trade it would cause was anathema to the merchant republic, and its outcome was very uncertain. Venice thus hesitated to take active steps that might provoke a war, especially since she would almost certainly be forced to fight it without the support of other Western powers. Cappello initially belonged to the more moderate faction, which advocated a policy of \\"armed neutrality\\", strengthening the fleet and Venetian fortifications overseas, but without entering into commitments with other Christian powers in the Balkans against the Ottomans. The moderates retained the upper hand in the councils of Venice until the Ottoman capture of Argos on 3 April 1463. The event was a shock to the Venetians, and emboldened the hawkish faction, which hoped to not only check the Ottoman expansion by a determined response, but perhaps also conquer the Morea. Cappello now switched to the war faction, and became its most prominent member. When the issue of war was debated in the Senate, he delivered an impassioned speech, recorded by the Greek historian Laonikos Chalkokondyles. Cappello argued that Venetian hesitancy had only emboldened the Ottomans, and led to the loss of Constantinople, the Morea, and Bosnia; that the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed II, was openly coveting Venetian territories; that Venice was decried in Europe for having sacrificed the eastern Christians to her commercial interests; that further passivity would lead to loss of both honour and territories; and that the only viable policy was to conclude an alliance with the Hungarians and attack the Ottomans from north and south, with Venetian forces capturing the Morea as a first step. Cappello's speech ‚Äì which was also effectively the \\"political programme\\" of the war party ‚Äì was instrumental in swaying its audience, and on 28 July, the Senate narrowly voted in favour of war. This was followed by an alliance with Hungary, the Pope, and the Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good. Pope Pius II called for a crusade, a proposal Cappello supported; it was approved both in the Senate (on 8 November) and in the Great Council (on 20 November). The crusade was not popular elsewhere in Italy, however, since the other Italian states feared that any benefits would accrue mostly to Venice, whose hegemonic designs they feared. Eventually, however, the crusade never got off the ground due to the reluctance of the Doge of Venice, Cristoforo Moro, to sail from Venice. Despite mounting dissatisfaction in Venice, the Doge tried to be exempted on account of his age, but was forced to go by Cappello, who argued that the \\"well-being and honour of this land\\" superseded the Doge's own. By the time the Doge's fleet arrived at Ancona to meet with the Pope, however, Pius II was ill from the plague, and died three days later, on 15 August, ending any designs for a crusade. Cappello favoured a decisive campaign in the Morea, and in the early months of the war, he seemed to get his wish; the Venetian forces retook Argos and refortified the Isthmus of Corinth, restoring the Hexamilion wall and equipping it with many cannons. They then proceeded to besiege the fortress of the Acrocorinth, which controlled the northwestern Morea, but after a clash that killed the commander-in-chief, Bertoldo d'Este, on 20 October, the Venetians were then forced to lift the siege and retreat to the Hexamilion. After a while, demoralized and riddled with dysentery, the Venetians abandoned that position too and withdrew to Nauplia, allowing Ottoman reinforcements under Mahmud Pasha Angeloviƒá to enter the Morea unimpeded. In February, Cappello argued for the appointment of Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta as the new commander-in- chief, but his tenure, which lasted through 1465, was ineffective, mostly due to the limited resources and manpower made available to him. The Venetian government, which had entered the war only with great reluctance, did not show great commitment in pursuing the war, and Cappello was unable to effect any change in its stance. On 5 September 1464, as ducal councillor, Cappello was elected as one of the ten envoys to the new pope, Paul II. The embassy was tasked with discussing the ongoing war, papal financial aid to Venice and Hungary, papal intervention with the Italian states hostile to Venice, and the exploitation of the alum mines of Tolfa, whose proceeds Paul II intended to use to finance the crusade. Cappello returned to his home town in December 1464. In September 1465 he was elected a member of the Ten. Second tenure as Captain General and death In the meantime, the Venetian war effort was faltering. Two attacks on Mytilene in 1464 failed, and the Captain General of the Sea, Jacopo Loredan, spent the remainder of his time in ultimately fruitless demonstrations of force before the Dardanelles, and with a diplomatic confrontation, that nearly led to war, with the Knights Hospitaller of Rhodes. Loredan repeatedly asked to be replaced, but it was not until February 1466 that Vettore Cappello was elected for the second time as Captain General of the Sea. Cappello's appointment brought elation and renewed hope for a decisive turn in the war; the provveditore of the Venetian army in the Morea, Giacomo Barbarigo, expressed \\"utmost joy\\" at the news, and the distinguished statesman Andrea Diedo expressed the expectation that Cappello would lead the recovery of the Hexamilion and the conquest of Corinth. Cappello left Venice in April, with instructions that gave him ample freedom in his conduct of the war. He took over command of the fleet at Sapienza, and sailed to Modon, Lepanto, and Negroponte to strengthen their fortifications. At Negroponte he forbade the continuing commerce with the Turks, but the Senate soon revoked his decision. Cappello then took his fleet of 25 galleys to the northern Aegean, capturing the islands of Imbros, Thasos and Samothrace. From there he sailed south again, with 28 ships, and on 12 July landed at Piraeus and marched against Athens, the Ottomans' major regional base. The lower town was taken without serious resistance, but he failed to take the Acropolis of Athens. As a result, in early August he abandoned the enterprise and resolved to march to Patras in the northwestern Morea. The town of Patras had been placed under siege by the Venetians under the provveditore Barbarigo, and was about to fall. Cappello nevertheless came too late: a few days before his arrival, Turahanoƒülu √ñmer Bey with 12,000 horsemen attacked the Venetian forces at Patras and routed them, killing Barbarigo. When Cappello arrived, he tried to avenge the defeat, but was in turn repulsed with heavy losses. Cappello gathered the remnants of his army and returned to Negroponte. In the meantime, the Senate resolved to recommence peace negotiations with the Sultan, and selected the Captain of the Gulf, Antonio Michiel, for the mission; instructions were sent to Cappello in November to be passed on to Michiel or any other of the captains to replace him. Michiel's mission was doomed to fail, as Sultan Mehmed II was not interested in peace, but the conflict nevertheless died down for several months. In the meantime, Cappello had fallen severely ill. His failure at Patras severely demoralized him‚ÄîMarino Sanudo reports that he never smiled thereafter‚Äîand he died of cardiac arrest at Negroponte on 13 March 1467. His body was returned to Venice, where his sons, Alvise, Andrea, and Paolo, buried him in the church of Sant'Elena, and dedicated a funeral monument in the fa√ßade of the church that shows him kneeling before the patron saint, Saint Helena. Variously attributed to the sculptors Antonio Rizzo or Antonio Dentone, it was the first, and for almost a century only, monument of this kind in Venice.

And he possesses a splendid temperament. I summed him up as a clear-thinking lad with a heart as big as his happy outlook on life\\". George Holland made his debut in the Australian championships in 1937 and lost to Arthur Huxley in round one. At the 1938 Australian championships, 19 year old Holland beat Huxley 10‚Äì8 in the fifth set in round one. Then in round two Holland caused a big upset by beating reigning French champion and third ranked player in the world Henner Henkel after losing the first 2 sets. From the third set onwards, Holland \\"followed everything to the net and made some glorious volleys\\" and was in command of the match. \\"His groundstrokes had more penetration, he rarely missed his first serve, and he treated Henkel's cannon-balls in cavalier fashion to take command of the attack\\" according to The Argus. In the quarter finals, Holland lost in four sets to Adrian Quist. In the first round of the 1939 Australian championships, Holland lost in round one to Vivian McGrath in straight sets.

The band consists of founding members Chris Edge (guitar, vocals), Bryan Peel (bass, effects, backing vocals), and recent member Cole O'Neil Robertson (drums, percussion). Formed after the end of Chris and Bryan's previous band, SIN, A Very Loud Death developed a style of conceptual, story telling post- alternative, noise rock music which uses a variety of influences such as jazz, grunge, classical, heavy rock, pop vocals, post-rock, progressive-rock, post- punk, jam band, traditional, and ambient music.  History   2015-2016: Do Away and Luke Campolieta  The band auditioned several drummers before finding gospel drummer Addison Kirkland. They were then, by chance, contacted via email by Patchwerk Studios sound engineer, Luke Campolieta. After hearing one of the home recording demos of the band on soundcloud, he offered to record the band for free. The band took him up on the offer. Luke pushed the band to record based on feeling, wanting to capture the \\"perfect performance, the right energy,\\" which led to a very \\"dark place and sound- honestly, a more honest and real direction\\". Following the recording, the band released the single in a limited, digital-only format.  2016: The Castration of the Idiot/The Addition of Cole O'Neil Robertson  After Do Away and wanting to explore a new direction- the band decided on a concept album vastly different from the dark sound of \\"their first single\\". Over the next few months they decided to again work with Luke Campolieta. Having most of an EP already written, and with studio time booked, Addison left the band due to scheduling. The band auditioned several drummers, before deciding on Cole Robertson. Borrowing from Dostoyevsky's \\"The Idiot\\" the band wrote the EP, utilizing post-punk, surfer, noise, doo-wop, and honky tonk, the 6 song EP marked a drastic foray into new territories for the band. Praised for its \\"brooding, controlling menace\\" the album launched two singles, \\"Mary\\" and \\"The Fleers\\" with both being the first of the band's music to appear on the radio.  2017: Lanterns  After \\"The Castration of the Idiot,\\" the band decided to take some time off to develop their chemistry. During this time they wrote new material which formed into what would be their debut full-length album, \\"Lanterns\\". Working for the third time with Luke Campolieta, the band released the first single, the self-titled track \\"Lanterns\\" on April 25, as a digital only release. They then announced the full album, \\"Lanterns\\", which was released on September 19, 2017. The album received generally positive reviews and international recognition. With UK's Lone Frequencies calling it a \\"Glorious Album\\".

The school was originally called the Handicapped Children's Playgroup, but went on to become the AWWA School. Tambyah also founded a programme called TEACH ME (Therapy and Educational Assistance for Children in Mainstream Education) to try to bring disabled children into mainstream schools, and to provide mobile therapy services to children whose families could not afford to bring them to a hospital.  Biography  Leaena Chelliah was born on 28 June 1937 to the Venerable Dr Devasahayam David Chelliah and his wife Rosalind. She and her family moved from Penang to Singapore in 1940, when her father was appointed as headmaster of Saint Andrew's School. She attended Raffles Girls' School, then Raffles Institution, before moving to England to earn her bachelor's degree in social science at the University of Birmingham. She returned to Singapore in 1960, and the next year began working as an assistant director at the Ministry of Social Affairs.  Special education advocacy  Tambyah left her job at the Ministry of Social Affairs when she became pregnant with the first of her children. She then worked part- time as a social worker and volunteered extensively. During this time she began volunteering at the Asian Women's Welfare Association (AWWA), where she helped run a family service centre. In 1979, she organized the Handicapped Children's Playgroup, a weekly playgroup at the Church of St. Ignatius for a small number of children with multiple disabilities, who at the time were not accepted to mainstream or special needs schools. This was the first school for multiply-disabled children in Singapore. She chaired the playgroup from 1979 until 1985. In 1986, the playgroup won a United Nations Community Excellence Award. The playgroup has since become the AWWA School. Tambyah organized a project called TEACH ME (Therapy and Educational Assistance for Children in Mainstream Education) in 1991. This project brought some children from special needs schools into mainstream schools. It also included a mobile therapy clinic to treat physically disabled children whose parents could not afford to bring them to hospitals for therapy. In 1994, the Family Resource and Training Centre gave TEACH ME the Innovative Programme Award. In 1984, Tambyah was awarded the Public Service Medal for her work. In 1991, she earned a special volunteer award from the Community Chest of Singapore. In 1994, she received the Public Service Star, and was named Her World Woman of the Year for her work to help children with special needs. In 2011, she was given the Special Recognition Award at the President's Volunteerism & Philanthropy Awards. Personal life She first met Dr John Anantharajah Tambyah (1938‚Äì2011) in 1953 while she was attending Raffles Girls' School and he was attending Raffles Institution. They married in 1964, and had a son, Professor Paul Tambyah, and a daughter, Malini Tambyah.

On the day of the Vijayadashami after the conclusion of the ritual worship, married Bengali Hindu women apply sindur on the forehead and feet of the goddess and offer sweets to her. Then they put sindur on each other's faces and offer sweets to each other.  Origin  The exact date and place of origin of the tradition is not known. According to one theory, the tradition originated around 200 years ago in the Durga Pujas of the zamindar houses to usher bonhomie among the housewives. According to a second theory, the tradition of Sindur Khela is as old as Durga Puja itself, around 400 years. The ritual is enjoyed just like a game and hence the name Sindur Khela. Sindur Khela is regarded as one of the most important rituals of Vijayadashami.  Contemporary ritual  Women pose for photographs after Sindur Khela in Sainthia, West Bengal The ritual worship of the goddess concludes with the Visarjan Puja. It is followed by Devi Baran, where the married women bid farewell to the goddess. The women are usually dressed in white saris with red borders and adorn traditional jewelries. Each of the women perform arati and smear the goddess' forehead and feet with sindur. They also offer her sweets and betel leaves. Following that the women smear each other's foreheads with sindur. Then they put sindur on each other's shankha, pala and noa, the conch shell, coral and iron bangles respectively, which are worn by the married Bengali Hindu women. Then they smear each other's faces with sindur. Finally they offer sweets to each other as prasad. According to commonly held belief, if a woman plays Sindur Khela by following the proper custom, she will never be widowed. Sindur Khela symbolizes the power of womanhood in protecting her husband and children from all evil. Through the ritual of Sindur Khela, the Bengali Hindu women pray for long and happy married lives of each other. Family tiffs and petty quarrels between neighbours are settled through this ritual. Unmarried women and widows are barred from participating in the ritual, but a recent campaign by the Calcutta Times has revived the practice of just women - be it married, widowed, transgender individuals or women of the red-light area, to play with Sindoor to show that this is a universal bonding for all women, all sisters and not restricted only to married women. In some parts of West Bengal, Sindur Khela is celebrated before Vijayadashami. In Dubrajpur, the Sindur Khela is celebrated on Mahasaptami itself. After bathing the nabapatrika and the following ritual worship, sindur is applied on the forehead of the goddess. After that the married women engaged in Sindur Khela. In the village of Bijra near Memari in Purba Bardhaman district, the family pujas of Ghosh and Bose family celebrate Sindur Khela on Mahastami. The tradition is almost 500 years old. After the ritual worship on Mahastami, the entire married womenfolk of the village celebrate Sindur Khela. Many people from adjoining areas came to Bijra to see this ritual.  Criticism  The ritual has been criticized in the recent times for multiple reasons. The ritual has been criticized as non- inclusive in character because the participation in the ritual is strictly limited to married women only. In 2017, The Times of India initiated an Internet video campaign featuring Rituparna Sengupta, that called for participation of single women, widows, divorcees, transgenders, lesbians and sex workers in Sindur Khela. The ritual has been criticized by Taslima Nasrin for being patriarchal in nature, because of the over emphasis on the married status of the goddess as well as the women. Bengali Hindu girls grow up seeing the married ladies in their family participate in the playful ritual, which creates among them a sense of life being incomplete without getting married. Critics feel that this can create a regressive impact on young women.  In popular culture  Every year, the Kolkata-based celebrities including the Tollywood actresses engage in Sindur Khela at the Manicktalla Chaltabagan Lohapatty puja pandal in north central Kolkata. Sindur Khela is a colourful, vibrant and spectacular ritual and so it has been the focus of Indian films. Some films and soaps have been titled in the name of the ritual. * Sindur Khela (1999), feature film * Sindoorkhela (2010‚Äì12), television soap * Ki Kore Toke Bolbo (2016) originally titled Sindur Khela, feature film  See also  * Durga Puja * Kali Puja * Holi  References  Durga Puja Culture of West Bengal Bengali Hindus ","title":"Sindur Khela"},{"id":"55397330","text":"Alexander Vasilyevich Kruglov () was a Russian writer, poet, publicist, biographer and editor.

Initially used in fast passenger trains from Stockholm to Rimbo and Hallstavik, they were moved to freight service after the Stockholm-Rimbo Line was electrified in 1946. They hauled iron ore from Dannemora mine and transporter wagons from Uppsala, but were replaced by diesel locomotives during the 1950s. Two locomotives were leased at different times to the narrow-gauge network in V√§sterg√∂tland. Their last service was between Rimbo and Hallstavik in 1960. SRJ 28 has been preserved.  History  Number 27-29, delivered in 1920 from Henschel & Son in Kassel, Germany, were the last steam locomotives ordered by SRJ. Prices were low in Germany at the time, and several Swedish railways bought locomotives from Henschel and other German manufacturers. The 2-6-2 locomotives had superheaters, relatively large bogie tenders, and were initially equipped with feedwater heaters, but the latter were removed as being too difficult to maintain. They were the largest and heaviest steam locomotives ever built for the 891 mm gauge. Intended for fast passenger trains, they were capable of considerably higher speeds than the official limit, but the railway itself only allowed . The locomotives were mostly used on from Stockholm to Rimbo and Hallstavik, occasionally from Rimbo to Norrt√§lje, although tank locomotives dominated on the latter line due to the turntable being too short for tender locomotives. The trains between Stockholm and Rimbo sometimes had fourteen carriages, including direct carriages to Norrt√§lje and Hallstavik. Express trains were introduced in June 1928, running the 57 km between Rimbo and Stockholm in one hour and five minutes. The purchase of the locomotives was partly due to an expected increase in traffic after Faringe-Gimo J√§rnv√§g was opened, but they were hardly ever used on that railway before the Second World War, except in the very first train. SRJ already operated electric local trains near Stockholm, and wartime difficulties with obtaining coal made them extend the electrification, reaching Rimbo in 1946 and Norrt√§lje in 1949. The need for large passenger train locomotives was now drastically reduced. SRJ considered rebuilding number 27-29 to 2-6-4 tank locomotives, and NOHAB offered to do so at a cost of 34,500 Swedish crowns for one locomotive or 89,400 crowns for all three, but it was never done. Instead they were moved to freight service between Rimbo and Hallstavik and iron ore trains between Dannemora and Hargshamn. They were still used in some passenger trains, including a Sunday evening train from Gimo to Rimbo that sometimes had ten bogie carriages. SRJ 28 in Uppsala in 2004. At this time V√§sterg√∂tland-G√∂teborgs J√§rnv√§gar (VGJ) were in need of more locomotives on its large network in V√§sterg√∂tland. SRJ 28 was leased to VGJ in 1947-1948; after returning to SRJ it was overhauled and equipped with roller bearings in the tender bogies. SRJ 27 was leased to the Swedish State Railways (SJ) in 1952-1955 for use on the now nationalized VGJ network. While in V√§sterg√∂tland it received a six-wheeled tender from an SJ locomotive, B2p number 3105, and this tender was also used on SRJ until number 27 was scrapped in 1962. Transporter wagons were introduced in freight trains from Uppsala to Norrt√§lje and Hallstavik in 1955, enabling direct transports to the normal-gauge network. This caused a large increase in freight traffic via Uppsala, and SRJ 27-29 were generally used in these trains. Smaller steam locomotives hauling trains with transporter wagons were prone to get stuck at a gradient near Faringe. Diesel locomotives were however introduced during the 1950s, and steam locomotives were hardly ever seen on the Uppsala-Rimbo line after 1958, but SRJ 28 was used on the line to Hallstavik until the autumn of 1960. That locomotive was then preserved in Faringe before being transferred to the Swedish Railway Museum in 1970. It was returned to Faringe in 1987 on loan to the heritage railway Upsala-Lenna Jernv√§g. The other two locomotives were scrapped in 1962.

Career Caporaletti was born in 1955 and raised in Roseto degli Abruzzi. He was a founding member of the Italian progressive rock group Pierrot Lunaire in the early 1970s, along with Arturo St√†lteri and Gaio Chiocchio. The first self-titled album. was released in 1974.Enrico Deregibus. Dizionario completo della Canzone Italiana. Giunti Editore, 2010. () From this year on, he started to dedicate his attention to the world of jazz, in particular in Rome, collaborating with musicians such as Tony Scott, Giulio Capiozzo and Jimmy Owens. Caporaletti's research activity in musicology started at the end of the 1970s. One of his first researches was a reflection on the concept of Swing (jazz performance style), developed in his MA thesis taken at the University of Bologna. Inside this thesis he set the basis of the epistemological concept of audiotactility, that later has been defined Audiotactile Principle (ATP). On this concept, he built the framework of the Audiotactile Formativity Theory that introduced to musicology the category audiotactile music.Caporaletti, Vincenzo (2000). [La definizione del swing.

He is also Professor at the Conservatorio di Musica \\"Santa Cecilia\\" in Rome, where he teaches Analysis of Performative and Compositional forms in Jazz Music.  Audiotactile formativity theory  Starting from 2000,Caporaletti, Vincenzo, La definizione dello swing. I fondamenti estetici del jazz e delle musiche audiotattili, Teramo, Ideasuoni Edizioni, 2000, 302 pp. () Caporaletti focused his research on the formalisation of a phenomenological and taxonomical model of musical experience, that, in his book, he has defined with the expression \\"audiotactile formativity\\". This model derives from a multidisciplinary reflection which starts from the analysis of the Groove (music)Caporaletti, Vincenzo, Swing e Groove. Sui fondamenti estetici delle musiche audiotattili, Lucca, LIM-Libreria Musicale Italiana, 2014, 386 p. () and swing phenomena and ending with a global perspective on the Musical improvisation. Caporaletti identifies with the term \\"Audiotactile music\\" those musical practices in which, on the one hand, the formativity of the musical text is fused with the musical actions performed by the musician in real time (Improvisation and/or extemporisation) and, on the other hand, are subjected to a process of phono- fixation through recording technologies. This category encompasses musical practices such as jazz, rock, rap, popular music, world music, Brazilian music and so on. In the precedent interpretative theories, they were identified as musical practices that belong to the written music tradition or the oral music tradition Auditactile music theory categorises musical manifestations opposing the visual matrix to the audiotactile one, depending on the embedded cognitive work model required to perform or play that particular music, and not considering the sociological aspects of music making. Considered from a phenomenological point of view, the form, experience and musical concepts that belong to Western written musical tradition, spanning from 18th until the first half of the 20th century, are based on a \\"visual cognitive matrix\\" while the popular one on a \\"audiotactile cognitive matrix\\". The conceptual framework of audiotactile formativity theory, or theory of the audiotactile music is composed of various pieces: the audiotactile principle [ATP], the neoauratic encoding [NAE], the swing-structure and the swing-idiolect. It is rooted on the philosophy developed by Luigi Pareyson,Cfr. Caporaletti, Vincenzo, Il principio audiotattile come formativit√†, in: SBORDONI, Alessandro (a cura di) Improvvisazione oggi; Lucca, LIM-Libreria Musicale Italiana; pp. 29 - 42 () on the semiotics of Umberto Eco, on the anthropological concepts developed by Alan Merriam, on Marshall McLuhan's mediology and on the cognitive psychology of Michel Imberty. Audiotactile Music theory has its roots also in Neurosciences, using them in an athro-cognitive and anthro-cultural perspective for understanding musical experience, starting from the implications of perception and cognitive capacities through the factor constituted by cultural mediation. The distinction between the Audiotactile and Visual matrix, that looms at the bases of Audiotactile Theory, has been scientifically demonstrated. This theory is employed as an alternative epistemological paradigm for the musicological studies in jazz, Brazilian music, progressive rock, world music, improvisational and contemporary music.

Hazelrigg (pen name, C. H. H.; November 23, 1859 ‚Äì 1937) was an American author, educator and reformer. She began teaching school at a young age, and after marriage and removing to Kansas, she taught school and served as principal of a ward school. She generally wrote under the initials of \\"C. H. H.\\", by which signature she was well known in the literary world. Early years Clara H. Espy was born in Council Grove, Kansas, November 23, 1859, or November 23, 1861. She was the youngest living daughter of Col. H. J. Espy. Her mother was Melora E. Cook, a teacher in the schools of Sandusky, Ohio. Her father was apprenticed to learn a trade, but ran away at the age of 13 to become a soldier. For more than 10 years, he was a member of the standing army of the United States. He served with distinction in the Mexican war and was Colonel of the 68th Indiana Volunteers during the American Civil War. He was wounded several times and his injuries caused his death shortly after the close of the war. His four children were left orphans, their mother having died in 1861. Career From the age of 11, Clara supported herself. When 12 years old, she wrote for the press, but she shrank from public criticism and seldom wrote over her own name. At the age of 14, she began teaching in a private school. She also taught in the public schools of Ripley County, Indiana. During the American Civil War, Clara lived in Indiana. She returned, briefly, to Kansas but, upon the death of her father in 1868, she again went to Indiana, where she attended school. On December 27, 1877, she married W. A. Hazelrigg of Greensburg, Indiana. They had one child, a girl. In 1883, or 1884, they moved to Kansas and located in Butler County, where Hazelrigg resumed her work as a teacher. She was also principal of one of the city schools in El Dorado, Kansas. Hazelrigg attended business college at Emporia, Kansas and was elected superintendent of the Butler County schools. After the family moved to Topeka, their vacations were spent at her husband's ranch in New Mexico. Hazelrigg traveled during her vacations, and wrote constantly during the entire year for the press. She wrote for prominent periodicals in various States. She was a department editor for a prominent Chicago paper, and was a regular contributor to the Topeka Lancet. In 1895, she published a History of Kansas; this was her best known literary work. In 1897, Hazelrigg was ordained and began holding revival meetings. Hazelrigg was the pastor who converted Jesse Bader. As an evangelist, she devoted much time to act church work, and covered eight states in the West and Midwest. She was known as \\"the Walking Preacher.\\" Hazelrigg spoke at the national General Missionary Convention held October 10‚Äì17, 1901 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Hazelrigg raised the money to build a church in Topeka, the West Side Christian Church. She was its minister from 1914‚Äì1931. She supported the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the work of the Woman's Relief Corps. She was an active organizer for the Christian Woman's Board of Missions and served as its Kansas secretary. In 1897, she reported traveling 9,000 miles, speaking before state, Sunday School, and Christian Endeavor conventions. Hazelrigg died in 1937.

It is a Grade I listed building. History The original guildhall, which was commissioned by Roger Thornton, was completed in the early 15th century and had to be demolished after being badly damaged in a fire in 1639. The new building was designed by Robert Trollope and completed in 1655. Following a poor harvest, the building was attacked by a crowd of 3,000 angry and hungry local people during a riot on 26 June 1740. Fine woodworks, paintings and court records were destroyed and at least one protestor was shot and killed by the military authorities. Five of the alleged ringleaders of the riot were sentenced to seven years of transportation. By the early 19th century both the north and south elevations had been re-fronted in the classical style. The north elevation, which was re-fronted to the designs of William Newton and David Stephenson in 1794, was given a Palladian style entrance with four Ionic order columns on the first floor. Meanwhile, the south elevation which was re- fronted to the designs of John and William Stokoe in 1809, was given arcading on the ground floor and a Doric order frontage on the first floor. The old Maison de Dieu, which had been completed by Roger Thornton in 1412, was demolished to make way to an eastern extension to the guildhall to the designs by John Dobson in 1823. The mayor and sheriff were allowed to hold the borough courts in the building and it was also the meeting place of Newcastle Town Council until 1863 when the council re-located to larger facilities at Newcastle Town Hall in St Nicholas Square. The interior of the building features a main hall which is long and wide and has an oak ceiling. The \\"Merchant Venturers' Court\\" where travellers, sailing in or out of the River Tyne, would meet, contains a large 17th century chimney piece, some fine oak carvings and some religious decorations, while the mayor's parlour is panelled and decorated with local scenes. The guildhall contains a number of paintings by George Bouchier Richardson (1822‚Äì1877) of local scenes, including the Entrance to the Side, the Pandon Gate, the old Tyne Bridge, the old Maison de Dieu and the old Exchange.

Another woman is running away, holding her red, broad-brimmed hat with both hands.

The film stars Kamal Haasan and Nedumudi Venu reprising their roles from the first film, while new cast consists of Kajal Aggarwal, Siddharth, Bobby Simha, Rakul Preet Singh and Priya Bhavani Shankar. The film features music composed by Anirudh Ravichander, collaborating for the first time with Kamal Haasan and Shankar. Cinematography and editing were handled by R. Rathnavelu and A.

Initial discussions were held with the producer of the original film, A. M. Rathnam of Sri Surya Movies, who stated it was too early to talk about the project. Shankar later became busy with the production of 2.0 (2018) and delayed starting the project, but he continued working on a story theme for Indian 2. In late September 2017, the film was then publicly announced during the finale of the Tamil reality television show Bigg Boss Tamil in Chennai. The show's host Kamal Haasan, who also played the lead in the original film, was confirmed as the lead actor and Dil Raju was announced as the film's producer for his film studio Sri Venkateswara Creations. Allirajah Subaskaran of Lyca Productions took over as the film's producer in October 2017, after Dil Raju opted out. Ravi Varman agreed to cinematography in the film, but production delays meant that he could not commit dates for the films. R. Rathnavelu and T. Muthuraj joined the team as the cinematographer and art director respectively, while Shankar decided to work with Anirudh Ravichander for the first time, rather than his regular collaborators A. R. Rahman and Harris Jayaraj for the film. Writers Jeyamohan, Kabilan Vairamuthu and Lakshmi Saravanakumar were all signed on to help complete the film's script and dialogues. Despite several proposed announcements of starting dates, the film's shoot was delayed throughout 2018 owing to Shankar's commitments with 2.0, which also faced significant production delays. Kamal Haasan also decided to use the time to release his long-delayed Vishwaroopam II (2018) and commit to his political career. Muthuraj began working on the production design during November 2018, as the film's shoot was scheduled to start in early 2019.  Casting  Nayanthara was considered for the leading female role, before Kajal Aggarwal was finalised. For her role, the actress learnt the basics of the Indian martial arts form Kalaripayattu. Siddharth was confirmed to play another role in the film, after the team had initially held discussions with the likes of Silambarasan, Dulquer Salmaan and Arya for the same character. Ajay Devgn agreed to play the antagonist in the film, but production delays meant that he could not commit dates for the films. Akshay Kumar, Abhishek Bachchan and John Abraham were considered as replacements, but neither actor was signed. Other actors including Nedumudi Venu, Delhi Ganesh and RJ Balaji were also signed to portray supporting roles in the film. Although, Balaji opted out of the film in October 2019. Telugu actor Vennela Kishore was announced to play a supporting role and has allotted 70 days for the film, making his Tamil debut. Closer to the start of the second schedule, actors Vidyut Jammwal and Bobby Simha were signed on for roles. Rakul Preet Singh also joined the film to star opposite the character essayed by Siddharth, while Priya Bhavani Shankar joined to replace Aishwarya Rajesh, who opted out of the film. Actors Samuthirakani,Sathish, George Maryan and Vivek also joined the cast in supporting roles.  Filming  A series of promotional posters featuring Kamal Haasan in his character were released in early January 2019 and production subsequently started on 18 January 2019. A week-long shoot was held at a memorial home near Government General Hospital in Chennai, before the team also shot scenes at a nearby film studio. However the film was again delayed after the makers had trouble with the created sets. The shoot was pushed further owing to the Indian general election in May 2019, where Kamal Haasan's political party participated. Throughout the development process in 2018 and early 2019, the makers regularly denied media reports that the film had been shelved. Owing to the long break between the schedules, Ravi Varman also left the project after becoming committed to Mani Ratnam's upcoming film 'Ponniyin Selvan, and was subsequently replaced by cinematographer R. Rathnavelu who previously worked with director Shankar in Enthiran. The second schedule began on 12 August 2019, with scenes featuring Rakul Preet Singh being shot. An action scene involving Kamal Haasan and 2000 junior artistes was shot in Bhopal at the cost of Rs.40 crores. On 5 November 2019, another schedule completed in Gwalior.  Incident  On 19 February 2020, during the shooting of the film, a crane carrying a heavy flash light fell on the sets, resulting in the deaths of 3 crew members, including an assistant director and leaving nine more injured. Kamal Haasan, Shankar and Kajal Agarwal all had narrow escapes.  Music  The soundtrack album and background score are composed by Anirudh Ravichander, who is working with Kamal Haasan and Shankar for the very first time. The lyrics were written by Thamarai, Pa.

Description The perennial sedge typically grows to a height of and has a tufted habit. It blooms between July and March produces brown flowers. The sedge has a short rhizome connecting plants together. The culms are smooth and triangular in cross section, they are a pink-red toward the base. The leaves have a width of and are ridged with deep sharp depression down the middle. Between two and seven inflorescences can be found on each stem. The inflorescence are composed of up to 20 or smaller red-brown spikelets which are in length. After flowering it will form a trigonous dark brown-black nut with a narrow-obovoid shape that is approximately with a diameter of around . Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Martin Vahl in 1805 as part of the work Enumeratio Plantarum The name of the species is often misapplied to Cyperus polystachyos. The species name congestus is Latin and means crowded and probably referring to snug way in which the fruit lies along the spikelet. The only known synonym for the species is Mariscus congestus as described by C.B.Clarke. Distribution It colonises easily and has been introduced into Australia, where it has now become naturalised.

He was nicknamed \\"the hunter of the exiles\\" (œÜœÖŒ≥Œ±Œ¥ŒøŒ∏ŒÆœÅŒ±œÇ). Archias was originally trained as a rhetor under Anaximenes of Lampsacus and Lacritus before becoming an actor. In his career as a tragic actor, he was said to have achieved some renown, performing in Athens and elsewhere. Plutarch mentions him as having been the mentor of the great actor Polus of Aegina, as well as having once won the Lenaia around 330, despite being, as far as Athens was concerned, a \\"foreigner\\". Archias is more known to history as a servant of the Macedonian statesman Antipater, probably for money. He was not an Athenian, but neither was he a Macedonian, and seemed to have no affiliation with any political parties, so later historians have assumed his motivations to have been mercenary in nature. Archias was sent in 322, after the Battle of Crannon, to apprehend the anti-Macedonian orators whom Antipater had demanded of the Athenians, and who had fled from Athens. Archias seized Hypereides, Aristonicos, and Himeraeus, and had them dragged from the sanctuary of Aeacus in Aegina, and transported to Cleonae in Argolis, where they were executed - quite gruesomely in the case of Hypereides. Archias also apprehended the renowned Greek statesman and orator Demosthenes in the temple of Poseidon in Calaureia, leading to Demosthenes's suicide after a memorable exchange recorded by Plutarch. An otherwise unknown \\"Archias\\" is mentioned by Arrian as having escorted Antipater's daughter Nicaea of Macedon to Asia around 322, whom some scholars (such as Karl Julius Beloch) identify with Archias of Thurii. Archias's fortunes at some point afterward took a downward turn. He eventually died of hunger, ending his life in great poverty and disgrace.Plutarch, Dem. 28, 29, Vit. X.

In biochemistry a porphyrinogen is a member of a class of naturally occurring compounds with a tetrapyrrole core, a macrocycle of four pyrrole rings connected by four methylene bridges.porphyrinogens - IUPAC Gold Book They can be viewed as derived from the parent compound hexahydroporphine by the substitution of various functional groups for hydrogen atoms in the outermost (20-carbon) ring. Porphyrinogens are intermediates in the biosynthesis of porphyrins, cofactors with a porphine core which are found in many enzymes and proteins including myoglobin, hemoglobin, cytochromes, and chlorophylls. Porphyrins differ from porphyrinogens by having the four pyrrole rings linked by methine bridges instead of methylene bridges , and by lacking the hydrogen atom in two of the four amine groups, turning them into imines . In the biosynthesis of porphyrins, the parent porphyrinogen is dehydrogenated by protoporphyrinogen oxidase. Because of their limited delocalization, porphyrinogens are colorless. Loss of all four central hydrogen atoms in the core yields a tetravalent anion that can act as a ligand to metal cations, creating a coordination compound. Subsequent biosynthetic intermediates en route to porphyrins are deeply colored and often phytotoxic. Natural porphyrinogens Porphyrogens that occur in living organisms usually have sidechains replacing some or all of the hydrogen atoms in two outermost carbon atoms of each pyrrole ring (as opposed to the hydrogen atoms in the methylene bridges).

These often have side groups that do not occur in nature, and possibly at the carbons in the methylene bridges (meso positions) instead of the pyrrole rings. The Meso-substituted porphyrinogens are intermediates in the so-called Lindsey synthesis of meso-substituted porphyrins. Oxidation turns the central hexahydroporphine core into a porphine core, yielding the desired porphyrin. Under acid catalysis, pyrrole and ketones or aldehydes condense to give many oligomers, including the cyclic ones . The desired porphyrinogens (n = 4) can then be separated. Meso- substituted porphyrinogens with eight non-hydrogen side chains are also called calix[4]pyrroles. These products resist dehydrogenation of the outer ring better than the natural porphyrinogens. For example, condensation with benzaldehyde yields meso-tetraphenylporphyrinogen, which can be oxidized to meso-tetraphenylporphyrin. Condensation with acetone yields meso- octamethyporphyrinogen, parent of meso-octamethylporphyrin. Alternatively, pyrrole with sidechains substituted at carbons 3 and 4 (those not adjacent to the nitrogen) can be condensed with formaldehyde to give porphyrinogens that more closely resemble the natural ones. For example, with 3,4-diethylpyrrole one obtains octaethylporphyrinogen, parent of octaethylporphyrin. File:Me8porphyrinogen.pngMeso-octamethylporphyrinogen (CAS 4475-42-7).

Profoundly deaf and widowed at a young age, she operated a home for women and children, and then later for disabled children. She participated in the Women's Tax Resistance League and was jailed for her refusal to pay tax if she were not allowed the right to vote. She was the first person imprisoned for failure to pay a tax under the Insurance Act. Early life Felicia Catherine Glanvill was born on 13 November 1862 in Peckham, London.Doreen A. Woodford, 'A Deaf Fighter for the Rights of Women.' Deaf History Journal, Vol.2 (3) p.7-21) She married Frank Harvey and had three daughters, before she was widowed. She operated a home in her residence in Bromley for disabled children and was an early practitioner of physical therapy, at a time when Victorian society frowned upon women working in medicine, especially in a field which used physical contact. Suffrage Harvey joined the Women's Freedom League (WFL)‚Äôs Bromley branch and by 1910 was one of the leading members of the organization. She met and became close friends with Charlotte Despard, another widow involved in charitable works, who operated a home for the poor in Wandsworth. The exact nature of their relationship is unknown, but Despard recorded in her diary that \\"the anniversary of our love\\" began on 12 January 1912. Harvey organized the suffrage march which took place in June 1911 as part of the Women's Coronation Procession for George V. Despard, who was president of the WFL, led the suffrage march. As early as 1911 Harvey, who had become a member of the Women's Tax Resistance League, engaged in a protracted battle with the Kent County Council for refusal to pay a stamp tax to obtain a license for her gardener. The Vote, the press organ of the WFL gave constant coverage of the conflict over the next two years. After several months, a warrant was issued for Harvey's arrest and she barricaded herself in her home. Refusing to pay taxes without having the ability to vote for her representation, after eight months, the barricade was broken and some of her property was seized in lieu of payment of the tax. A year later, having built stronger barricades and still refusing to pay, bailiffs broke through using a battering ram. Harvey was arrested and taken to the Bromley Police Court in August 1913, where she was ordered to pay fines under the Insurance Act. She refused to pay and was sentenced to serve two months in Holloway Prison. She was the first person sentenced under the Insurance Act, though two other suffragists had been imprisoned for failure to pay taxes in previous years for such things as dog licenses, carriage duties and inhabitant taxes. Protests to her arrest, attended by both men and women, cited the inequity of her fines being much higher than those imposed upon men for the same offence. After serving only one month of her sentence, Harvey was released because of concerns for her health. In November, authorities attempted to auction her belongings to pay her fines, but were forced to close the sale when no bids were made. She was awarded a medal from suffragists depicting the entry of Holloway Prison. During the war, most suffragists suspended the campaign for enfranchisement, but Harvey and Despard, continued to press for reform and were ardent pacifists, speaking against war. The pair attended the Seventh Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance in Budapest and were interested in promoting the international feminist movement. Both were also involved in the Theosophy movement, believing that moral and spiritual development of the individual would result in societal change. Harvey was described as \\"intensely pious\\" and conducted religious instruction for the children in her care in a chapel she built in her home. In 1916, Harvey and Despard bought a large house together, along with two cottages and a wood shed on twelve acres of land in Upper Hartfield at the edge of the Ashdown Forest. Naming the facility \\"Kurundai\\", they created a thirty-one-bed hospital for women and children. Though initially Despard paid expenses for some of the hospital patients, in 1917, the Theosophical Society became involved and the home was renamed as the Brackenhill Theosophical Home School. It housed children from broken homes, illegitimate children, as well as those who were sick or disabled and was directed by Harvey. In 1920, the Theosophical Society withdrew their support and moved the Theosophical Home School to the Old Rectory in Letchworth but Harvey continued operating the facility at Kurundai. In 1921, Harvey and Despard split up after nine years together when Despard moved to Ireland. Harvey maintained sole ownership of the facility, but between 1923 and 1928 it was operated by the Invalid Children's Aid Association as a convalescent center for children who had rheumatic diseases and she moved to a house near the facility known as \\"Wroth Tyes\\". In 1928, Harvey took over management again and converted Kurundai to a boarding school, which she called Brackenhill Open Air Home School. An open-air, facility, she focused on vegetarianism and physical exercise, providing the children with a \\"natural\\" life where they slept in the open air in shuttered shelters. The sides of the roofed dwellings only were shuttered in extremely poor weather. She continued to live at Wroth Tyes with the headmistress of the school, Helen Smith. The two women operated the school until the advent of the Second World War, when the government repurposed the estate for the war effort. Death and legacy Harvey died at Wroth Tyes, in Hartfield, East Sussex, England on 29 April 1946 and left the Brackenhill property to Smith. In 2005, Harvey's suffragette medal was auctioned by Bonhams bringing ¬£840 and renewed interest in the suffragette.

The report noted that development of OWEP-enabling technologies must currently compete for priority with other Solar System objectives, which is not useful for strategic planning. The report recommends common, multi-mission technical infrastructure and secure funding to develop it. The Roadmaps to Ocean Worlds (ROW) report was submitted and it was published in January 2019. Science goals Artist's cut-away representation of the internal structure of Ganymede. Layers drawn to scale. On Earth, itself an ocean world, liquid water is essential to life as we know it. A question is whether the dark, alien oceans of the outer Solar System could be habitable for simple life forms, and if so, what would their biochemistry might be. The goals of the Ocean Worlds Exploration Program are to \\"identify ocean worlds, characterize their oceans, evaluate their habitability, search for life, and ultimately understand any life we find.\\" Exploring these moons could help to answer the question of how life arose on Earth and whether it exists anywhere else in the Solar System.> It may also be possible to find pre-biotic chemistry occurring, which could provide clues to how life started on Earth. Any life detected at the remote ocean worlds in the outer Solar System would likely have formed and evolved along an independent path from life on Earth, giving us a deeper understanding of the potential for life in the universe. Oceanographers, biologists and astrobiologists are part of the team developing the strategy roadmap. The planning also considers implementing planetary protection measures to avoid contaminating extraterrestrial habitable environments with resilient stowaway bacteria on their landers. Targets Ocean worlds identified in the Solar System so far with reasonable certainty are the major moons Europa, Enceladus, Titan, Ganymede, and Callisto. Of these, Europa and Enceladus have the highest priority because their icy shells are thinner than the others (Europa's is less than 10 km; Enceladus' is about 40 km) and there is some evidence their oceans are in contact with the rocky mantle, which could provide both energy and chemicals for life to form. Enceladus' ice crust has fractures at the south pole that allow ice and gas from the ocean to escape to space, where it has been sampled by mass spectrometers aboard the Cassini Saturn orbiter with tantalizing results. Titan's ocean is the deepest, at 50 to 100 km, and no evidence for active plumes or ice volcanism have been observed. Bodies such as Triton, Pluto, Ceres, Miranda, Ariel, and Dione are considered candidate ocean worlds, based on hints from limited spacecraft observations. Missions The Ocean Worlds Exploration Program (OWEP) is supporting the Europa Clipper orbiter mission to Europa, which is the first planned target of this program. The second is the Dragonfly mission to Titan. The program is also supporting concept studies for a proposed Europa Lander, and concepts to explore the moon Triton with a mission called Trident that was proposed to NASA's Discovery Program in March 2019 and selected as a finalist in 2020.

It was founded in 1914 as the Hoangho Paiho Museum. The museum has three floors and spans an area of 12,000 square meters. Over 380,000 geological and biological specimens are currently held at the museum.  History  The museum was founded in 1914 by √âmile Licent, and was called the Hoangho Paiho Museum. For 25 years since the museum's founding, Licent conducted explorations in the Yellow River Basin and the Haihe River Basin, with the full length of the exploration stretching 50,000 kilometers. During these explorations, Licent collected over 200,000 paleontology, animal, plant, ancient human, and rock specimens. The Hoangho Paiho Museum was eventually renamed the Northern Border Museum. After the People's Republic of China was founded, the Northern Border Museum was hosted by Tianjin University, one of the largest multidisciplinary engineering universities in China. In June 1952, after the establishment of the Tianjin People's Science Museum Preparatory Committee, the Tianjin People's Science Museum was established, and was renamed to the Tianjin Nature Museum in 1957. In 1959, the museum's exhibit's were relocated to 272 Machang Road in the Hexi District. In August 1968, the Tianjin Museum of History, the Tianjin Museum of Art, and the Tianjin Museum of Nature merged to form the Tianjin Museum. In January 1974, the Tianjin Museum was renamed the Tianjin Natural Museum. In 1997, the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee and government invested 100 million yuan to renovate the museum, with the renovation being completed in 1998. In 2013, the museum once again was renovated, and opened in 2014, at a new site in the Tianjin Cultural Center.  Major specimens and exhibitions  The lobby of the museum. The lobby of the museum displays several dinosaurs, including a cast of a Tyrannosaurus Rex and skeletal mounts of Mamenchisaurus, Omeisaurus, and Bellusaurus.  The Ancient Earth and the Modern Earth  The displays on the second floor are divided into two parts: The Ancient Homeland, and the Modern Homeland. The exhibit is organized into eight sections: The Birth of Life, The Cambrian Explosion, Competition for the Ocean, The Transition onto Land, Diversity of Evolution, The Flight of Birds, Mammalian Radiation, and Human Origins and Biological Intelligence. The Birth of Life deals with the beginning of life, 3.8 billion years ago, and features fossils of ammonties and other invertebrates. The Cambrian Explosion deals with the sudden diversity of life in the Cambrian period, Competition for the Ocean deals with life in the ocean, and features modern and prehistoric sea life, such as icthyosaurs, sharks, placoderms, and octopodes, as well as many modern and prehistoric examples of underwater plant life. The Transition onto Land deals with life moving onto land, and features giant sculptures of modern bugs, synapsids like Lystrosaurus, and petrified wood. Diversity of Evolution deals with the appearance of dinosaurs and other archosaurs, in which many large mounts of dinosaurs like Omeisaurus, Triceratops, and Lambeosaurus are featured, as well as a collection of fossilized dinosaur eggs. There are also pterosaur displays, in which a large Dsungaripterus skeleton is laid out. The Flight of Birds deals with the evolution of birds from dinosaurs, and features several filamented non-avian dinosaurs such as Dilong, and several fossils of early birds, such as Confuciusornis. Many modern birds are also exhibited. Mammalian Radiation deals with the rise of mammals as dominant land animals, and has a central display of proboscidean evolution, featuring Platybelodon, Stegodon, and a woolly mammoth. It also features cats like Homotherium, and a display of whale evolution. A modern moose is also displayed. Human Origins and Biological Intelligence deals with the evolution of hominids, and features a bust and several casts of the Peking Man, an example of Homo erectus.  Earth's Ecology  This exhibit spans an area of 3400 square meters, on the third floor of the museum. Tianjin honorary citizen Kenneth Behring donated over 200 rare specimens of wild animals, which are displayed along with the museum's own collection. The exhibit highlights the design of ecosystems, and the vast diversity of different ecosystems around the world. The exhibit is divided into seven sections: Australia: Continent of Living Fossils, South America: The Magical Rainforest, North America: The Wild New World, Antarctica: Snow and Ice, Arctic: Melting Glaciers, Africa: The Original Wild and Dead, and Eurasia: The Symphony of Life.

It is a right tributary of the Sa√¥ne, and thus a sub- tributary of the Rh√¥ne. The river rises in the Cr√©tanne cave in the village of B√®ze, then crosses several communes in its course before entering the Sa√¥ne in Vonges. Its source is the outlet of a vast underground network fed by the Tille and the Venelle. A walk has been laid out around the spring, which is a major tourist attraction in the region. The watershed of the B√®ze river and its main tributary, the Albane, irrigates the Sa√¥ne Vingeanne country, over a total area of Along its course the landscape alternates between forested areas and areas of large crops, livestock meadows and ponds. The basin is home to four natural areas of interest for their ecology, fauna and flora. Human occupation along the river began as early as the Paleolithic. In Roman Gaul the sanctuary of Mirebeau-sur-B√®ze, on an important axis of communication, was an important place in the region. The site was occupied by the Legio VIII Augusta, who built an imposing military camp. In the Middle Ages the river saw the foundation of the Abbaye Saint-Pierre de B√®ze, a gathering place for the pilgrimage of Saint Prudent de Narbonne. In the modern era the Poudrerie nationale de Vonges was founded at the mouth of the B√®ze, which it used for industrial purposes. It remains an important heritage building on the water. The fauna and flora are similar to those associated with the Sa√¥ne ecosystem, with a predominance of trout. Many hydraulic structures, however, have a strong impact on the river species. The water quality of the B√®ze and its tributaries is considered mediocre due to nitrates from agricultural and livestock activities along the river's course. The B√®ze and its watershed do not present any major natural hazards.  Geography and description  Washing station on the B√®ze in B√©zouotte. The source of the B√®ze is north-east of Dijon in the B√®ze village at an altitude of . It rises from a basin at the foot of the Kimmeridgian limestones and immediately forms a river wide. Other sources, connected with the underground river discovered in 1950 by the Dijon Speleo-Club, originate under the old cemetery of B√®ze downstream. The river then travels in a southeasterly direction to discharge into the Sa√¥ne, of which it is a tributary on the right bank, in the commune of Vonges, at an altitude of of altitude, where it is wide. Its average slope is 0.9%. La B√®ze flows through the center of the \\"B√®ze-Albane\\" catchment basin in the heart of the Sa√¥ne Vingeanne country, in the department of C√¥te-d'Or, with a total area of . The river is characterized by its source in B√®ze, a remarkable spring fueled by a large underground network. Its watershed contains three tributaries and is bounded on the south by its confluence with the Sa√¥ne.  Sources  = Location = The B√®ze in C√¥te-d'Or. The source of the B√®ze is one of the most important karst springs in metropolitan France. The river originates in an underground lake in a cave called La Cr√©tanne in the immediate vicinity of the agglomeration of B√®ze, in C√¥te-d'Or, at the foot of a cliff overlooking the spring, in the basin called \\"la douy\\". The lake is discharged into the open through a tunnel similar to the Fontaine de Vaucluse. The tunnel, called the Salle Blanc (White Room), is with a ceiling, and can be entered by a small staircase at the foot of the cliff. The well-known La Cr√©tanne cave is underground. It is about long, with four upstream tunnels and one downstream tunnel, the source of the B√®ze. = Underground network = The underground network of the B√®ze extends over , with a vertical drop of . The source of the B√®ze, the outlet of this hydraulic network, is the most important karst spring of the C√¥te-d'Or department. The Cr√©tanne cave is the best explored part of this vast network. The underground network of B√®ze consists of four sumps, or underground water channels: * The source of the B√®ze sump was prospected by the S.C. Dijon (Speleo Club de Dijon) and the S.C. Paris for the first time on 25 October 1953 along and a depth of . In 1972 the SHAG explored about more and then the S.C. Dijon, in 1974, reached the junction with the cave by crossing this sump of , which proved to be prolonged by side annexes, including a very dangerous downstream duct, for a total of . * The pier sump (or sump 1) was unclogged in 1964, 1966 and 1967. The entrance was cleared during the year 1968. The embedded conduit between two strata runs for . It ends in a flooded well constituting the junction of several galleries. The main one was explored in 1975 up to from the entrance and to a depth of . The junction with the Lac Blanc sump was reached in 1976. In 1976 a secondary downstream gallery, beginning from the entrance, extended for and then emerged into a dry area. * The Lac Blanc sump (or sump 2) was discovered in 1953 by the S.C. Dijon and the S.C. Paris and then explored for in a slightly immersed gallery to a submerged shaft at a depth of . Ancillary sumps, close to the entrance, were explored to about . In 1976 the main water supply was located from the entrance, the \\"Puits de la Chaussette\\". The junction with the pier sump was formed by a fracture long and high. A bell- shaped cavity was then discovered from the entrance. Three extensions were explored in 1978 and 1979: a very narrow crack surfaced in a small duct terminated by a flooded crack, a vast flooded chimney and a small upper network. * The sumps of the scree gallery (or sumps 3 and 4) have no apparent current and contain many clay deposits. The first measures and the second . = Geology = Detail of the cliff that overlooks the upwelling at B√®ze Entrance to the B√®ze cave The Cr√©tanne cave is made of limestone. The set of galleries that constitutes the underground B√®ze river have developed in layers of limestones that are not very thick ( on average) and were formed in the upper part of the Oxfordian or Astartian ageas. This formation overlays a thick mass of limestone of quite variable nature from the Rauracian and Sequanian ages, with thickness of over , which constitutes the basement of the limestone plateaus to the north of B√®ze. The source is covered by limestone and marl of the Kimmeridgian age, which form a small cuesta visible to the southeast of the village of B√®ze, under the compact limestone of the Portland Group. The ceiling of the cave is covered with kaolinite while the walls are covered with manganese oxide in some places. The set of galleries has a slight but steady incline towards the south, where it is covered by patches of Cretaceous rocks and then by the Tertiary sediments of La Bresse. The karst in the region must have been established either at the end of the Oligocene, or during the Miocene. The galleries of the B√®ze cave are parallel to the stratification of the layers. They are wide, with flat roofs that corresponds to the base surface of the limestone beds. It seems that are several levels of galleries. The highest are visible at the base of the first room and are all clogged. The main galleries contain a number of vertical chimneys that could have been formed as a result of upward erosion by water under pressure. The galleries are oriented in two directions. The principal gallery is oriented a few degrees east of north, parallel to the direction of the tectonic faults and the main joints of the region). The second is essentially perpendicular to the previous one and also corresponds to a joint direction. The sediments of the B√®ze cave were the subject of detailed study in the proceedings of the 1st International Congress of Speleology. The filling mud consists of siliceous sands identical to the albian sands found further south of the B√®ze. The sands indicate the existence of the basin of an underground river of an old albian cover that has now disappeared. In addition, the greatest part of the filler consists of fine sand and silt that is increasingly fine towards the top of the series. Several cycles of sedimentation separated by calcite floors can be observed. Finally, varves are present in the upper galleries, formed during flooding, which are separated by darker layers and particles of finer size, deposited during periods of low water. = Hydrology at source = View of the karst spring in B√®ze and the walkway around it The source of the B√®ze consists of two openings: * The first, at the southern end of the underground river, where the water comes almost vertically through a sump obstructed by large collapsed blocks * The second, the main opening, is about further north at the end of the Salle Blanc. The flow is greater than in the other outlet due to the presence of a sump. The Speleo Clubs of Dijon and Paris undertook penetration tests which showed the existence upstream of flooded galleries and then an almost vertical well of in depth leading to more flooded galleries. A sump to drain the waters of the underground river is a short distance from the first water outlet, about from the B√®ze karst spring, but is insufficient to drain all the waters during flood periods. The average annual flow of the river at B√®ze is . There are significant variations, with the low flow rate around and the maximum at times of flood reaching . The flow of the B√®ze at its source was observed during a period of 27 years from 1981 to 2012 at the station in B√®ze called the \\"Ferme de Rome\\" . = Origin of the waters = The river originates in an upwelling of the waters of the aquifer under the forest of Velours in the commune of Lux, C√¥te-d'Or. This is fed by water from the Tille and Venelle rivers. The Speleo-Club of Dijon has explored the source since 14 July 1950. Exploration continues today by scuba diving and by systematic study of the discovered network. H. Tintant says that most of the waters of the B√®ze come from underground drainage of the immense karst plateau consisting of rauracian and sequanian limestones forming a quadrilateral limited to the north by the impenetrable Argovian marls from Cr√©cey-sur-Tille to Occey and the valley of the Vingeanne. Covered by dry valleys and perforated with numerous funnels (several hundred in the Velours forest alone), this plateau, which measures more than , is covered with very permeable rocks with a small but discernible slope to the south. The underground river feeding the B√®ze at its source probably collects 50% of the annual rainfall on the plateau. Fluorescein tests carried out by the Speleo- Club of Dijon in 1970 showed that the waters of Venelle colored those of the B√®ze in the caves of the spring. Asellus aquaticus endemic to the B√®ze cave = Fauna and flora = The B√®ze cave is home to an endemic species, the Burgundy Asellus aquaticus, a freshwater species studied in 1969 by J.-P. Henry and G. Magniez. The underground river is home to crustaceans such as niphargus. Fish such as minnow, sculpin and trout can sometimes be found in one of the sumps. There are five species of bats. The flora is composed of ferns that have colonized the geological chimneys. Various types of moss and some fungi can also be observed. = The spring = The B√®ze spring is at the point where the Sequanian limestone plateau dips under the more clayey or Kimmeridgian cuesta, which is similar to many Ch√¢tillonnais springs at the foot of the Aargau cuesta. The geographer Fran√ßois Robert wrote in 1789 that the B√®ze spring is one of the four most significant in France. The spring is the most photographed place in B√®ze. Some postcard publishers do not hesitate to improve the picture by scratching the glass plate negative for a more impressive outpouring. The walk at the source around the spring is a monument historique site with construction dated to the 18th century and trees that are 200 to 300 years old. = Development = The walkway around the B√®ze spring In 1970 the municipality of B√®ze and its mayor, Robert Poinsot, decided to develop the cave, which is the property of the commune, for tourism. It opened to visitors in April 1971. The caves can be visited by boat over a distance of about on the underground lake at a temperature of . The numerous stalactites and stalagmites with singular forms such as drapes, sombreros or shells are among the attractions of one of the most important tourist sites of the Dijon region. The number of visitors is constantly increasing: 14,390 in 2007, 16,255 in 2008, 18,224 in 2009, 19,341 in 2010 and 20,193 in 2011. Famous stalactites named \\"B√®ze andouilles\\" (B√®ze noodles), referring to the local gastronomy, fell during a flood. The most admired stalactite is the \\"elephant ear\\". Three professional guides escort visitors in boats without motors which are moved by a network of ropes installed on the roof of the cave. The cave is regularly used for training firemen of Dijon and also Paris, and even for the army.  B√®ze-Albane basin  = Description = Map of the river basin (green shading). The B√®ze-Albane catchment area has a continental climate exactly the same as that of Dijon. Summer rains are often stormy since uneven heating of the ground increases the convective phenomena. Winters are wet and relatively harsh, and rarely pass without snowfall. The geology of the basin is composed, at its head, of limestone formations of the secondary era. The center-west of the basin, from Noiron-sur-B√®ze to the source of Albane, consists of secondary formations of the Cretaceous and earlier tertiary formations of the Pliocene. The Cretaceous series forms a monocline with a slight southwest dip where the Cenomanian-Turonian chalk forms a layer above the Albian clays. It typically forms rounded hills. The lowland valleys of the Albane and B√®ze consist of recent carbonate alluvium in the B√®ze basin but clayey-silty soil in the Albane basin. The upstream part of the B√®ze basin is fed by an important karst network replenished in part by losses from the Tille and the Venelle rivers. Some rainwater supplies these aquifers. The source of the B√®ze is the outlet of this important network. = Body of Water = There are many poplar plantations. This one is on the banks of the Albane in Saint-L√©ger-Triey. Located in the Rh√¥ne basin, the B√®ze-Albane catchment area covers an area of . It has a length of of which is the bed of the B√®ze. The main tributaries of the B√®ze are the Albane, Chiron and Pannecul. Several studies have shown that the topographic watershed in the commune of B√®ze, which is only , is at the center of a larger hydrological network, between , probably . The highest land has an elevation of about at the head of the basin. The B√®ze-Albane basin is almost entirely rural, with only 2.1% of the area built up. Forests and fields account for more than 95% of the territory, with twice as much cropland as forest. Grasslands are hardly present, covering 5.5% of the basin and 8.6% of the agricultural land. The main crops are cereals and oilseeds. Woods and forests are numerous in the basin and represent a significant part of the land. The largest wooded areas include the forest of the Mirebeau domain, B√®ze wood, Popin wood, Varve wood, Pont Bourdin wood and the Vervotte forest. There are also large poplar plantations, especially in the lower valleys, notably at Belleneuve, Mirebeau, and Saint- L√©ger. Some grasslands have disappeared over time, in favor of arable crops. These were traditionally present near streams, as shown by the names of farm lots along the B√®ze and Albane on detailed IGN maps. = Hydrology = Topographic map of the B√®ze The B√®ze has moderate seasonal fluctuations in flow, with higher rainfall in winter bringing the average monthly flow rate to between from December to March inclusive, with a maximum in January. Starting in March the monthly flow rate gradually drops to the low summer levels from July to September, with a monthly average flow rate down to in August. However, the minimum flow for 3 consecutive days of the month can drop to during a dry five-year period. The average flow over the year is . The level of the river does not begin to rise slowly until after five or six days of continuous rainfall. File:B√®ze hydrological station - average monthly flow m3 per sec.jpg Average monthly flow m3/s as of 2012 at the B√®ze hydrological station Flooding is never very significant since the river benefits from the regulating effect of the large underground water table. The instantaneous flow for peak flood is and the maximum for a five-year flood is . This rises to for a ten-year period, or a 20-year period and for a fifty-year period. The greatest instantaneous flow recorded was on 18 December 1982, and the greatest daily average was on 21 December 1982. This flood was lower than the 20 year level, so was by no means exceptional. It might be expected every 15 years on average. The amount of water that runs off the B√®ze basin (rainfall less evaporation / absorption) is estimated at annually, which is moderately high but of the same order of magnitude as France as a whole, but less than that of the Sa√¥ne river basin, which has annually. The specific flow reaches per square kilometer of the basin. Landscape of plains and groves, at Noiron-sur- B√®ze = Landscapes = Course of La B√®ze in B√©zouotte The vegetation is mixed, with a marked contrast between the forest and arable land. Reliefs are also mixed with more rolling hills in the northwest of the basin in the communes of Vi√©vigne, Tanay, Belleneuve and in the area of Noiron-sur-B√®ze, Chevigny-Saint-Sauveur, B√®ze and Bourberain. The water courses are more enclosed and the woods and villages are often on the hills. The watershed comprises four main types of Zone naturelle d'int√©r√™t √©cologique, faunistique et floristique (ZNIEFF): * Type II ZNIEFF #260015037, Velours and Fontaine- Fran√ßaise forests, spanning the territories of Lux, Bourberain, Tanay,B√®ze and Vi√©vigne. * Type II ZNIEFF #260015026, B√®ze valley holding all the land near B√®ze river in the communes of B√®ze and Vonges, including the Mirebeau domain forest * Type II ZNIEFF #260015020, Longchamp forest, spanning the municipalities of √âtevaux, Saint-L√©ger-Triey, Lamarche-sur-Sa√¥ne and Longchamp. :Type I ZNIEFF#00550001) is included in the Longchamp forest and covers the lake of Saint-L√©ger-Triey (\\"The Big Pond\\") * Type II ZNIEFF #260015009, Sa√¥ne valley from Vonges to Auxonne. :Type 1 ZNIEFF # 00340001 is in the ZNIEFF II Sa√¥ne valley from Pontailler-sur-Sa√¥ne to Auxonne. = Tributaries and bodies of water = Four bodies of surface water are present in the B√®ze catchment: B√®ze, Albane, Chiron and Pannecul, as well as three bodies of groundwater: The main tributary of the B√®ze is the Albane, which enters the B√®ze on the right bank at Saint-L√©ger-Triey. The B√®ze also receives water from Chaume-et-Courchamp, north-west of B√®ze in the canton of Fontaine- Fran√ßaise. This subterranean link was demonstrated by Speleo-Club of Dijon in 1955, following a sudden rise of muddy waters in the B√®ze and then an exploration of the cavities. There are four minor springs in the catchment area apart from that of the B√®ze: the Albane spring at Magny-Saint-M√©dard, the Creux de Vau spring at Mirebeau-sur-B√®ze, the Fontaine du Gu√© spring at Noiron-sur-B√®ze and the small springs of Tanay. = B√®ze valley = The upstream part of the B√®ze valley is made of limestone formations of the Jurassic. From Noiron-sur-B√®ze, limestone gradually gives way to marl. The valley covers an area of . The B√®ze crosses twelve municipalities, all located in C√¥te-d'Or: B√®ze, Noiron-sur-B√®ze, Mirebeau-sur-B√®ze, B√©zouotte, Cuiserey, Charmes, Marandeuil, Drambon, Tanay, Saint-L√©ger-Triey, Vonges and Pontailler- sur-Sa√¥ne. The basin crosses seven cantons and seven communities of communes, or a total of 41 communes. There are 16,861 inhabitants, or 33.7 inhabitants per square kilometer. Five communes have more than 1,000 inhabitants in the basin: Mirebeau-sur-B√®ze, Belleneuve, Arc-sur-Tille, Pontailler-sur-Sa√¥ne and Lamarche-sur-Sa√¥ne. In Charmes, the land of springs, fountains and water ditches of the B√®ze basin, the water is flush with the soil so that the inhabitants of the region name the place \\"the fishpond\\" . It is in fact the moat of an old castle. There the B√®ze is fed into a small stream, the Gailloux. In Savolles, even though the B√®ze does not cross the territory of this municipality, a reserve of water in case of fire was created on the ridge line between the B√®ze and the Albane, filled in the 1950s during the erection of the water tower. =Albane valley= The Albane at Saint-L√©ger-Triey, towards Vonges. The river joins the B√®ze to southeast. The Albane valley (or \\"Albanne\\" according to Badin and Quantin 1847) has clay-marl soil. The Albane takes its source at the place called \\"La Ferme de l'Albane\\" in the commune of Magny-Saint-M√©dard. It flows for before reaching the B√®ze in Saint-L√©ger-Triey a few kilometers before the confluence with the Sa√¥ne. It crosses the municipalities of Magny-Saint-M√©dard, Savolles, Belleneuve, Binges, Troch√®res, √âtevaux, Marandeuil, Drambon, Saint-L√©ger-Triey, Pontailler-sur-Sa√¥ne and Lamarche-sur-Sa√¥ne. = Economic and tourism activities = There are seven Approved Associations for Fishing and Protection of Aquatic Environments (AAPPMA: Associations agr√©√©es de p√™che et de protection des milieux aquatiques) which cover three quarters of the catchment area. Fishing is, however, a declining practice and the main activity practiced by these associations is stocking. Fish farming is practiced in many artificial ponds. The Bessey, Noiron, Rougeot, Drambon and Marandeuil ponds are on the B√®ze, and the Bouques, Pierre, Grand, Maladi√®re and Bergerie ponds are on the Albane. The only hydroelectric production is one turbine at the outfall at Drambon. Most tourist activity is in the communes of Mirebeau-sur-B√®ze and Pontailler- sur-Sa√¥ne, both green holiday resorts. Walking trails, part of the circuit of the Val de Vingeanne, let visitors discover B√®ze and its surroundings. Human occupation Examples of bifaces found in Burgundy, similar to those found at B√®ze, in the Mus√©e arch√©ologique de Dijon  Paleolithic  The La Ronci√®re site in B√®ze has often been researched. Remains from the old and middle Paleolithic to the Gallo-Roman period were discovered, including stones broken to produce chips or blades of the \\"Orville\\" type, showing that the site was occupied in the middle Magdalenian period. There seem to be signs of two other occupations, one in the Aurignacian and the other in the upper P√©rigordian. Remains of prehistoric animals are present at the entrance of the cave Cr√©tanne such as teeth of mammoths and remains of woolly rhinoceros and hipparion.  Ancient site at Mirebeau-sur-B√®ze  Example of a tile made by troops the Legio VIII Augusta in Mirebeau (This object was found in Strasbourg) Mirebeau-sur-B√®ze is in the Lingones zone between the Aedui and Sequani Celtic tribes. It was an important axis in the network of tracks of eastern Gaul. Recent archaeology shows that the Celtic and Gallo-Roman sanctuary in Mirebeau was present from the end of the 4th century BC. The site was discovered in 1973 by Ren√© Goguey from aerial surveys, and was explored from 1977 to 1982 during construction of a college. New excavations carried out by J.P. Guillaumet from 1983 to 1986 brought to light remains of the La T√®ne culture. In 2001 and 2006 new research resulted in an estimate of the total area of the site at . Several periods of occupation could be distinguished: La T√®ne B2-C1, La T√®ne 2DB, Early Auguste and the Flavian period, during which an aqueduct was built. It seem that the evolution of this sanctuary was influenced by the Roman military presence. A first camp, during the Gallic Wars (58‚Äì40 BC.) initially defended the sacred site. A second camp, east of the ancient settlement hosted the Legio VIII Augusta during the Pax Romana, stationed there from 70 to 90 AD due to disturbances among the Lingones. The Roman camp at Mirebeau-sur-B√®ze measured and had an area of . It could house the 5,500 soldiers of the Legio VIII Augusta. Many structures have been found: housing, a hospital, warehouses, a workshop, forum and baths, as well as stamped tiles. The enclosure was imposing and composed of ditches, then a rampart of earth, wood and stones. Monumental gates guarded the entry. In addition, the meander of the B√®ze has traces of development. The upstream part is widened, forming a kind of canal. The convex shore has not been attacked by erosion, as it should have been normally. In addition, on 4 July 1967, photographs of missions carried out by the Mirage III in the 33rd Reconnaissance Wing uncovered a straight line like the wall of a dock. It seems that there was a canal, accessible to ancient river navigation, used to supply the legion in Mirebeau. The B√®ze would have been used to carry the reputed wheat that the Lingones sent to Rome, since Mirebeau was in the center of fertile valleys and plateaus. The B√®ze is dotted with other sites such as a group of small buildings at \\"La Venelle\\" and two apparently protohistoric enclosures on the left bank. Middle Ages The tower of Oysel in B√®ze, one of the vestiges of the old abbey, dominates the river. The Benedictine Abbaye Saint-Pierre de B√®ze was founded in 630. It was visited by Pope Paschal II in February 1107. The town of B√®ze then belonged to the province of Champagne. In the 8th century the place was called the \\"Fountain of B√®ze\\" (). The Chronique de B√®ze from the first 3rd of the 12th century, describes foundation of the abbey on an unoccupied site. Arnanger, Duke of Atuyer, gave his son Gandelin the order to found a monastery there. The Chronicle says: In 883 the abbey welcomed relics of the martyred Saint Prudent de Narbonne, whose worship was important to B√®ze in the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries. According to Solange de Montenay, in 888 the cave served as a refuge from the Normans for the inhabitants of B√®ze and the monks of the abbey. In 1680, the lawyer Bonyard described Beze: B√®ze also had a castle protected by walls and moats, and a bridge that joined the two sides of the river.  Modern period  Former hydroelectric dam at the exit of B√®ze (Belle-Isle farm in B√®ze, towards Mirebeau-sur-B√®ze). = The B√®ze, central element of the Vonges national powder mill = The history of the national powder factory of Vonges is linked to that of the B√®ze. On 15 July 1753 Emmanuel Piche, the founder of the company, acquired a perpetual lease on the Foullot meadow with a surface area of and a stretch of the river to install powder mills. As early as 1775, according to the Abb√© Claude Court√©p√©e, the village was an important powder production site: \\"Two powder mills on the B√®ze with 24 drums and 24 mortars each, which in 21 hours made 960 pounds of powder. A third mill between the two ... to refine the powder. These mills have grown by four times in 23 years.\\" In 1716 the site required a change in the water level of the B√®ze to meet the industrial needs. A major fire in 1839 forced redevelopment, then works in 1840 and 1841 allowed creation of new circular canal pounds and the installation of hydraulic motors. A royal ordinance of 29 April 1841 regulated the use of water in the Vonges powder mill. It regulated the level of the large weir of the old Vonges mill and that of the small spillway of the powder mill, and fixed the dimensions of the discharge valves. As a result of the extensive development work, and due to numerous complaints from local residents regarding the frequent flooding that transformed grassland around the powder works into unhealthy swamps, on 23 January 1848 a new ordinance was issued concerning the Syndicat de la B√®ze. Its purpose was \\"to prevent the overflow of this watercourse\\". The first work involved the powder works' canal, dug to replace the old winding bed of the B√®ze. Disputes then arose between the residents of the river's left bank and the powder works concerning clearing and maintenance of the old course of the B√®ze. The residents demanded compensation. On 26 June 1928 a complaint concerning the Vonges powder works was filed by the riverine communes near the Lower B√®ze concerning the floods. Since then a union, which meets once a year, is composed of 14 municipalities and has 28 members, two from each commune, chosen from municipal councils. The contribution is paid by some 500 owners, including the national powder factory of Vonges. = De-industrialization of B√©zouotte = Canal at B√©zouotte, former site of the forge The well-known forge and furnace of B√©zouotte disappeared in 1860, ruined by the industrial concentration and free trade policy of Napoleon III. Twenty metallurgists left the village. Around 1870 mills were erected on the sites of the forge and the furnace, but they did not last more than ten years. Hops were cultivated intensively at the end of the 19th century, but then dropped significantly. In addition, several incidents, including a major fire, put an end to the activity. In 1883 the Cuiserey bridge was built on the B√®ze. The same year saw the B√®ze and its region affected by a terrible drought. Around 1900 M. Ratter equipped the forge's canal with a turbine that supplied three-phase electric power to Pontailler. = Mills at Mirebeau-sur-B√®ze = A mill with ten pairs of cylinders and a pair of wheels is in action at Mirebeau-sur-Beze. It is one of the most important in the region, and can grind a hundred sacks of wheat a day. Two metallic walkways allow workers to carry cereals stored in warehouses across the river to the mill. Since 1900 a turbine installed next to the mill can produce power for the entire village. In 1903 the covered washing boat on the rue des Moulins was sold by commune.  Heritage buildings on the water  Former mill and blast furnace at Noiron-sur-B√®ze, shut down 1858 = Cultural heritage = There is a diverse heritage of buildings on the water. There are washing houses in the all villages crossed by rivers in the B√®ze-Albane basin. Some have small valves that are still usable. The remained intact buildings of the former Abbaye Saint-Pierre de B√®ze, including the laundry, were listed as a monument historique in 2010. At Mirebeau a castle, of which two towers and part of the walls remain, as well as traces of the city walls, are located along the B√®ze. Many hydraulic structures dot the course of B√®ze and its tributaries, but only two are still economically useful: the Drambon factory and the Rente de l‚ÄôAlbane in Belleneuve. = Old industrial sites = Plan of the Poudrerie nationale de Vonges in 1884 showing the network of canals from the B√®ze that cross the industrial site Milling activities are historically located on watercourses. The Poudrerie nationale de Vonges, built in 1691, is one of the historically emblematic sites of the B√®ze-Albane Basin. Old industrial sites are dispersed through the basin, and are mainly old forges or communal waste dumps. The Bureau de Recherches G√©ologiques et Mini√®res led a national program that included a census of sites across the Burgundy region. Two studies by the Service r√©gional d‚Äôam√©nagement des eaux (SRAE) in 1981, when measuring the flows of the B√®ze, and a survey when the Canal des Marais diversion was built to irrigate crops in Drambon in the 1830s, help to enrich or confirm the map of lost industries. The largest concentrations are in Pontailler-sur-Sa√¥ne and Mirebeau-sur-B√®ze, where there was an old distillery. Waste dumps have also been recorded at B√®ze, Vi√©vigne, Noiron-sur-B√®ze, and Cirey-les-Pontailler. Old forges are present in almost all the communes crossed by the B√®ze and especially in Drambon, Marandeuil, B√©zouotte and Noiron-sur-B√®ze. These sites represent a potential risk of water pollution, since records confirm that the masters of the B√©zouotte forges poured the waste from their furnaces directly into the river. This would have been common practice at other forges at the time. At Noiron-sur-Beze the land of the island and bordering the mill beside the B√®ze would be full of these residues. According to the owner the waste was partly used to form the island. = Present industrial sites = As of 2009 sixteen industrial sites were active on the course of the B√®ze. Among them, the two powder mills at Pontailler-sur-Sa√¥ne and Vonges are classified under the Seveso II Directive as holding dangerous substances. Other industries are subject to self- monitoring for discharges into the environment: PBI in B√©zouotte, Titanite SA in Pontailler-sur-Sa√¥ne, STPI and the Soci√©t√© nationale des poudres et des explosifs in Vonges.  Human impact  The B√®ze is strongly canalized at Drambon. A weir regulates the flow. The √âtablissement public territorial de bassin (EBTB) Sa√¥ne and Doubs notes that during the 20th century the revolution in farming practices led to intense and widespread upheavals in land use in the valleys, and many sanitation and agricultural drainage ditches have dramatically redesigned the river basin's water flows. The B√®ze is the watercourse least affected by works along its course, by contrast with its tributaries the Albane, Chiron and Pannecul, which have been modified considerably for agricultural purposes. Some parts of these water courses are truly canalized.  Ecology and environment   Fauna and flora  pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) = Species = Trout and \\"Satoille\\" (probably the European river lamprey) were fished in the B√®ze, the Sa√¥ne and Vingeanne in the Middle Ages. Margaret III, Countess of Flanders recounts having tasted the fish in 1382‚Äì83. In 1900 crayfish, which were very common and were fished with a bundle of thorns baited with chicken guts, suddenly disappear as a result of a mysterious epidemic. Surveys of fish since 1995 show the most common species are trout, stickleback (disappearing), common roach (reappearing), stone loach (reappearing), pumpkinseed (decreasing), black bullhead (decreasing) and common minnow. Downstream of Marandeuil the B√®ze has mainly fish of the family Cyprinidae, with the Esox as a reference species. The status of the fish population in the B√®ze-Albane catchment area is provided by the Departmental Plan for the Protection of the Aquatic Environment and the Management of Fish Resources (PDPG, 1998) prepared by the F√©d√©ration de P√™che de C√¥te-d‚ÄôOr. It notes that the fish context from the resurgence of the B√®ze to Marandeuil is a disturbed salmonic context, with trout as a reference species. Only reproduction seems to be disturbed among the three criteria of growth, hatching and breeding. Wetlands in the watershed are limited to drainage ditches, which contain a few macrophyte species, and in the ponds connected to tributaries of the B√®ze and the Albane. Reed beds are present in large numbers. = Human impact = Grid at the entrance to the Vonges powder factory. Some structures built on the B√®ze have an important impact on the reproductive, hatching and growth cycles of the animal species living there. Several factors disrupt wildlife: * The EDF de la B√®ze dam disrupts the reproduction function. * Discharges from the Mirebeau Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) impact the three functions of breeding, hatching and growth. * The presence of livestock disrupts the growth function on the tributaries. * The sluices on the B√®ze disturb reproduction and hatching. * The Vonges powder factory disrupts growth by its discharges. Pike and perch restocking programs were carried out by the Gaul de Vonges association in 1986, 1987 and 1988, and then by the local Association agr√©√©e de p√™che et de protection des milieux aquatiques (AAPPMA). The PDPG recommends better management of sluices, large flood areas and improved treatment of the powder factory effluents. Six hydraulic structures out of the 17 identified in the B√®ze-Albane basin are strictly impassable by fish. This shows the extent of the biological partitioning of the main drainage system of the basin. More than 8.5% of the linear watercourse, or is physically influenced by the presence of hydraulic structures. These works promote warming of the water and growth of algae, and limit the development of fresh water animal species.  Drinking water  In the whole B√®ze catchment area, 11 communes, or 27% of all communes, have not delegated their water supply to a syndicate. Five syndicates are partially present: Arc-sur-Tille (3 of the syndicate's 4 communes), Cl√©nay and Saint-Julien (1 of the syndicate's 10 communes), Sa√¥ne Ognon Vingeanne (5 of the syndicate's 10 communes), V√©ronnes (2 of the syndicate's 3 communes) and Basse Vingeanne (3 of the syndicate's 5 communes ). The main water manager of the basin is the Groupe Saur, with 78% of communes in the basin. SDEI, now Lyonnaise, manages 5%, or 2 municipalities. 17% of municipalities have opted to manage their own water. Eight use the watershed resource and six of these manage sources. The estimated water volumes used in the basin are per year.  Pollution  Cows grazing in Saint-L√©ger-Triey. Agricultural and livestock along the B√®ze have important consequences for the quality of its waters. Nine stations measure the quality of surface water along the course of the B√®ze. The √âtablissement Public Territorial du Bassin (EPTB) Sa√¥ne and Doubs noted a concentration of nitrates in two bodies of water in the B√®ze water catchment. The nitrate quality is poor on all the stations of the basin with a maximum at the outlet of basin. The quality of metals (essentially chrome and nickel micropollutants) is average, but appears to be localized near the former Drambon and Marandeuil forges. The Saint-L√©ger station records contamination by arsenic and nickel. Agricultural activities are the main source of diffuse nitrate pollution. This has serious repercussions, since the potability of the water supply is questionable. The whole of the B√®ze-Albane basin is classed as being in a vulnerable zone for nitrates. This classification aims at protecting the environment, in this case the aquifer of the Sa√¥ne, against contamination by nitrates. A program for establishment of grass strips was decided in 2009. Since then there has been a marked improvement in the quality of water. Planting of saplings is causing a riparian forest to reappear on the river banks. The Departmental Council of C√¥te-d'Or has been monitoring the quality of the surface waters of the B√®ze catchment since 1994 by measurement stations that are monitored every two years. Uncontrolled refuse dumps have been observed and are the target of an awareness campaign.  Agriculture and irrigation  Agriculture is the main economic activity of the Beza watershed. Large-scale intensive crops have generally replaced the river's edge grasslands that were grazed or mowed before. The crops are now drained and only a few farmers are still irrigating their crops, mainly maize and potatoes, from the B√®ze. A water body at the source of the Albane was designed for this purpose. According to the figures of the Mission Inter Services de l'Eau the average annual consumption for irrigation in the catchment area is per year. Almost all of this flow is used from May to September, over five months, with peaks often observed in June and July. These samples would represent about 17% of total basin catchments. The impact of these withdrawals is considered negligible given the absence of modification of flow of streams.  Sanitation  Sewage treatment in the B√®ze catchment area is managed by 23 municipalities through an intermunicipal network, representing 56% of the communes. According to EPTB Sa√¥ne and Doubs, Lamarche-sur-Sa√¥ne, Pontailler- sur-Sa√¥ne and Vonges turn to the Sa√¥ne, which then receives the waste. Vonges is connected to one of the treatment stations of Pontailler-sur-Sa√¥ne. 16 municipalities do not have treatment facilities at present, i.e. 43% of municipalities. Half of the facilities are very recent, and two are licensed to treat nitrogen and phosphorus in accordance with the Urban Wastewater Directive (ERU) 92. The treatment plants in the B√®ze watershed are of three types: activated sludge, filter plant or natural lagooning. Flood of the river at B√®ze on 20 December 1913 caused by a major outburst at the spring  Natural hazards  La B√®ze and its watershed do not containt major natural hazards. Areas at risk of flooding are agricultural areas. The communes vulnerable to this risk according to the Direction r√©gionale de l'environnement (DIREN) are Mirebeau and Bourberain. The confluence zones (Saint-L√©ger-Triey, Vonges and Troch√®res) are particularly affected by the floods. Flood periods are relatively short, with the river usually returning to its bed after one to five days. The main risk of flooding comes from poor management of hydraulic structures, particularly in the communes of B√®ze, Drambon, B√©zouotte and Vonges. The woods around Mirebeau hold poplar trees on the banks of the B√®ze, which can constitute risks for the banks, given the very shallow roots of this tree.

The film stars Cassie Scerbo, Brytni Sarpy, Mason Dye, Harvey Guillen, Luke Baines, Ricardo Hoyos, Alexxis Lemire, Christina Masterson, and Heather Langenkamp. The plot focuses on a group of eight college students who rent a house haunted by a vengeful spirit who lost a game of truth or dare several years earlier. The group decide to play the game and are forced to follow through or face deadly consequences. The film premiered on Syfy on October 8, 2017. It received negative reviews from critics.  Premise  For Halloween, a group of eight college friends rent a house supposedly haunted by a vengeful spirit who lost at a deadly game of truth or dare several years beforehand. When the group decide to play the game, they are forced to answer each humiliating truth honestly and act upon each increasingly alarming dare asking them to do violent acts to themselves and each other or risk death by the spirit.  Plot  In 1983, Donna Boone tells her friend Johnny to jump off the roof to complete the game of Truth or Dare. He rolls off to his death before completing the dare. Horrified, Donna returns inside the house to find writing on a mirror telling her to pour acid on her head. After first covering her head in a paste of baking soda and water, she does so, completing the dare. In the present day, a group of eight friends ‚Äì Carter, Maddie, Tyler, Alex, Jessie, Addison, Holt, and Luke ‚Äì go to a house Carter has rented for a Halloween outing. Carter tells the group that the house became haunted after seven teens played Truth or Dare in 1983 and all but one died horribly. He persuades everyone to play Truth or Dare. Alex is dare to make out with Maddie, which they do. Afterwards, Maddie is asked if she‚Äôs slept with Tyler, Alex‚Äôs boyfriend, and although she initially tries to lie, a mysterious group text forces her to tell the truth. Tyler‚Äôs dare is to put his hands on a hot stove and is told to 'do the dare or the dare does you', and although he attempts to quit, a chair moves by itself and trips him onto the stove, severely burning his hand. An old-fashioned TV displays a warning that the group has 48 hours to complete three rounds of the game. They try to leave, but the doors and windows close, trapping everyone in. Jessie is dared to eat Tyler's burnt skin from the stove, and after eating one piece, the phone rings despite the wires being cut with the message for her to eat all of it. The next person dared is Holt, who is dared to grab onto exposed wiring, electrocuting himself on wires hanging from the ceiling after a chandelier broke off. To keep him alive, Carter rushes at him whilst carrying a blanket to disengage him from the wires. Luke is dared to smash his knee, which Carter eventually does. Addison is asked if she‚Äôs an addict, and she lies that she isn‚Äôt and then tries to leave the house. A mysterious force shoves her off of the porch and onto an exposed pipe, killing her. At the hospital, the group tries telling the police what happened, but are met with skepticism. The next day, the ghost of Addison appears in Carter's dorm room and dares him to hang himself, with a noose falling out of the ceiling. Carter attempts to leave, and the ghost and noose capture him and hang him. After being sent a livestream of the dare, Alex, Maddie, Tyler, and Holt race to Carter's room, but are unable to open the door in time. The four friends see a message that Round Two is beginning. Meanwhile, Alex's research into the haunted history of the house leads her to Donna Boone, the lone survivor of Truth or Dare back in 1983. Donna tells them that the ‚Äòdemon‚Äô running the game feeds on fear and pain, and that they will have to finish the game inside the house in order to survive. She also suggests sharing their dares to outsmart the demon. In his bedroom, Luke receives a dare to rob a gas station, and a gun appears supernaturally on his bed. He pulls up at the gas station with Jessie on the passenger seat and attempts the robbery, but the cashier ends up killing Luke with a shotgun. Shocked, Jessie calls Alex to tell her that Luke was shot during the robbery, and Alex tells her to meet back at the house. Once Jessie returns, the group heads back to the house and Tyler receives a dare to drink a liquid poison. He shares the dare with everyone and they all first chug soda, then drink the poison and vomit it up. Maddie then receives a dare to pull two teeth out. With the help of Tyler, the two complete the dare. Alex then receives a dare to play three rounds of Russian roulette, with Alex surviving the first two and Tyler taking round three from Maddie, fatally shooting himself in the head. Holt then receives a dare to be run over by a car, and confesses to the others that he once paralyzed someone in a hit-and- run accident, but escaped without being disciplined. Jessie tries to start the car to run over Holt‚Äôs foot, but is unable to, and when Holt opens the hood to fix the starter, the hood slams on his hand. The car, driving itself, pulls him in reverse until he falls, then runs him over, crushing him to death. Heading back into the house, Alex realizes that the spirit is punishing them for their obsessions and sins. Jessie is dared to chain herself to a pipe in the cellar, but runs out of time and is devoured by a huge swarm of cockroaches. Then Round Three begins. Maddie receives a phone call instructing her and Alex to remove seven living body parts. Between them, they remove an eyelash, some hair, a fingernail, an earlobe, a finger, and a toe, then Alex chops off Maddie's foot with a cleaver. After completing the dare, they head to the hospital, but a message appears on the car‚Äôs GPS with Alex's final dare ‚Äì \\"kill her\\". Maddie begs Alex to kill her, and Alex slams the car into a tree. After the screen cuts to black after hearing the crash, someone‚Äôs gasps are heard, indicating at least one survivor.

On 30 September 2017, the aircraft suffered an uncontained engine failure and made an emergency landing at Goose Bay Airport, Canada. The outboard right-side Engine Alliance GP7000 engine failed and its fan hub and intake separated southeast of Paamiut, Greenland, while the aircraft was in cruise. This was the second uncontained engine failure suffered by an Airbus A380, following that of a Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine on Qantas Flight 32 in 2010. Engine failure The aircraft diverted to CFB Goose Bay, a military air base also used for civilian flights, and landed at 15:42 UTC (12:42 local time) after suffering an uncontained failure on its number 4 (rightmost) engine while flying southeast of Paamiut, Greenland. The engine had operated 3,527 cycles since new. There were no reported injuries or fatalities among the 497 passengers and 24 crew on board. Passengers were not allowed to disembark from the A380 until another Air France aircraft and a chartered aircraft arrived the next morning (1 October), because the airport (located on the Canadian Forces air base) is not equipped to accommodate a large number of passengers from commercial aircraft. The Air France aircraft (a Boeing 777) landed at Atlanta, requiring a wait for its passengers to board another flight while the chartered Boeing 737 aircraft took passengers directly to Los Angeles with a refuelling stopover at Winnipeg. Pictures and video of the damaged engine were posted to social media by passengers; and of the landing by an observer on the ground. Aircraft The aircraft involved was an Airbus A380-861, registration F-HPJE, powered by four Engine Alliance GP7000 turbofan engines, delivered to Air France on 17 May 2011. Investigation Air France issued a press release stating that an investigation was underway to determine the cause of the engine failure, including representatives of the Bureau d'Enqu√™tes et d'Analyses pour la S√©curit√© de l'Aviation Civile (BEA, the French aviation accident investigation bureau), Airbus and Air France. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is responsible for investigating aviation accidents in Canada and planned to send investigators. However, since the incident occurred over Greenland, the Danish Accident Investigation Board has jurisdiction over the investigation. On 3 October 2017 the Danish aviation authorities delegated the investigation to the BEA. Investigators from Denmark, the US and Canada joined the investigation. Advisors from Airbus, Air France and Engine Alliance (a partnership between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney) also flew to Goose Bay. The first observation was that the engine's fan hub had detached during the flight and dragged the air inlet with it. Some six days later, debris from the aircraft's engine was recovered in Greenland. The BEA stated that \\"the recovery of the missing parts, especially of the fan hub fragments, was the key to supporting the investigation\\" and initiated a large search operation including synthetic-aperture radar overflights on a Dassault Falcon 20, but failed to locate the crucial components in 2018, before returning in 2019. In July 2019, another missing piece of the engine, weighing 150 kg, was located in Greenland and recovered. The BEA released their final report in September 2020. Subsequent action On 12 October 2017, the American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an Emergency Airworthiness Directive (EAD) affecting all Engine Alliance GP7270, GP7272 and GP7277 engines. The EAD required a visual inspection of the fan hub within a timescale of two to eight weeks, depending on the number of cycles an engine had operated since new. In June 2018 the FAA issued another Airworthiness Directive, requiring eddy- current testing of the fan hubs of GP7000 engines, to check for cracks in the slots in the hub that serve to attach the fan blades. In August 2019, the BEA announced that a part from the fan hub recovered from Greenland had been examined by the manufacturer Engine Alliance under BEA supervision. Metallurgical examination of the recovered titanium fan hub fragment identified a subsurface fatigue crack origin. The fracture was initiated in a microtextured area approximately in the middle of the slot bottom. Examination of the fracture was ongoing. Meanwhile, Engine Alliance announced to the affected A380 operators that an engine inspection campaign would be launched soon. https://news.aviation-safety.net/2019/08/21/engine-alliance-to-start- engine-inspection-campaign-over-a380-uncontained-engine-failure/  Recovery and repair  Air France announced plans to ferry the aircraft back to Europe for repair, with an inoperable replacement engine installed, for reasons of weight and balance. Such a flight requires special operating procedures, and thus rehearsal by the crew in a simulator. That plan was revised and the aircraft was subsequently ferried back from Goose Bay Airport to Charles de Gaulle Airport on 6 December 2017 using four operational engines and an Air France crew. The replacement engine was delivered, and the damaged engine flown to East Midlands Airport in the United Kingdom for examination by General Electric during the period 23‚Äì25 November 2017. The aircraft returned to service on 15 January 2018. Recovery of the fan hub from the Greenland ice sheet took place on 29‚Äì30 June 2019 after 20 months and four phases of complex aerial and ground search operations to locate the various elements from the engine.

The 1690 original 4-bay house is center. The 1913‚Äì15 Colonial Revival 4-bay extension is right. Pencoyd (Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania) was a historic house and farm in Bala Cynwyd, Lower Merion Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Located along the north side of what is now City Avenue, the farm originally stretched from the Schuylkill River to Conshohocken State Road (PA Route 23). Settled by John Roberts in 1683, his descendants owned the property for 280 years. The house was built 1684‚Äì1690, and demolished in 1964. Welsh Tract Detail of Thomas Holme's A Mapp of Ye Improved Part of Pensilvania in America, (1687). Pencoyd was part of the parcel marked \\"Edward Jones and Compa~ 17 Families\\" (center) Welsh Quakers faced religious discrimination and harassment in their native land. A group of Welsh Quaker businessmen met with William Penn in London in late 1681, and secured a tract of in his new colony of Pennsylvania. The Welsh Tract was to be contiguous and stretch northwestward along the Schuylkill River from the outskirts of Philadelphia to Valley Forge. The understanding of the businessmen was that the Welsh Tract would be a separate county that they would control, and in which business would be conducted in their native language. The tract's boundaries significantly changed in Thomas Holme's 1687 survey, with two large riverfront estates for Penn's children carved out of it, along with properties that Penn granted to his creditors. In addition to the intrusions by non-Welsh landowners, Thomas Holme's 1687 survey placed most of the Welsh Tract in Philadelphia County, with a significant section in Chester County and miles from the Schuylkill River. John Roberts, maltster, emigrated from Llanengan in North Wales. He joined a syndicate of Quaker families, the Edward Jones Company, that purchased 5,000 acres at the southeast corner of the Welsh Tract, prior to sailing to America. On November 16, 1683, he arrived at Philadelphia aboard the Morning Star, with a servant, and possibly his siblings Richard and Anne. On March 20, 1684, he married fellow passenger Gainor ap Robert, daughter of another member of the syndicate.Thomas Allen Glenn, Merion in the Welsh Tract, (Norristown, PA: Herald Press, 1896). Two of their four children, Robert and Elizabeth, lived to adulthood. His original parcel of land seems to have been 100 acres, with the additional 50 acres extending it to the river the gift of his bride's family. The combined 150-acre (60.7 hectare) parcel was the one closest to Philadelphia‚Äîa rectangle that ran about a mile west from the river along the Blockley Township line, then north a quarter mile, then east to the river, then south to the starting place. Downstream of the parcel, at the Falls of Schuylkill was Netopcum, a Native American seasonal settlement where Lenni Lenape came in spring to fish. Family tradition holds that he began building the stone house on his property in 1684, although scholars date its earliest portion to 1690.James C. Massey, \\"Pencoyd Farm,\\" The Roberts Estate, HABS No. PA-1087, (National Park Service, March 1964). Roberts and his servant cleared the wooded land to plant barley, for making malt.

Roberts, architect, 1962. About 1690, John Roberts built a two-story, four-bay, gambrel-roofed house--exterior dimensions: --with stone walls two feet thick.Harold Donaldson Eberlein and Horace Mather Lippincott, The Colonial Homes of Philadelphia and Its Neighbourhood (Philadelphia and London: J. B. Lippincott Company, 1912), pp. 150‚Äì52. It faced south (City Avenue), and had large stone chimneys at its east and west ends. Its first floor featured four rooms ‚Äî an off-center entrance hall with front and back doors and a stair at the north end; a long room running the depth of the house with a large fireplace (kitchen?) to the west; a smaller room with a corner fireplace (parlor?) at the southeast corner; and another smaller room with a corner fireplace (bed chamber?) at the northeast corner. A datestone--not original, added 1913‚Äì15, and now in the collection of the Lower Merion Historical Society--reads \\"J & G / R / 1683.\\" Under Isaac Warner Roberts the first fire insurance survey was made of the house in 1827. It listed the dimensions of the original house, a one-and-a-half-story stone kitchen, and a \\"new\\" one-story stone wash house. He probably built the hexagonal smokehouse with Gothic windows in the second quarter of the 19th century. An 1835 insurance survey recorded his two-story stone addition, a new kitchen with a bedroom above. Fifteen-year-old George Brooke Roberts drew an elevation of his parents' house in 1849, showing the 1835 addition. In his will, Roberts divided the farm in half (including the section in Blockley Township), bequeathing the western half (with Pencoyd house) to son George, and the eastern half (along the river) to son Algernon Sidney Roberts. In 1866, Rosalinda Roberts (widow of Isaac Warner Roberts) converted the 1835 kitchen into a dining room, built a new stone kitchen, and made other additions, including an entrance porch with ornamental cast-ironwork. She added indoor plumbing and the house's first bathroom--an 8 x 8 ft frame addition built atop posts and attached to the north wall. Access to the bathroom was from the stair landing between the first and second floors, with water supplied from a cedar cistern in the attic. George Brooke Roberts hired architect Allen Evans, of Furness & Evans, to modernize and expand the house, 1883‚Äì84. Evans designed a two-and-a-half-story, gambrel-roofed east wing--anchored by a massive \\"upside down\\" brick chimney--that extended the length of the front (south) fa√ßade to . Evans also may have designed later additions, 1888‚Äì89,Mutual Assurance Company, Policy #4613, George Brooke Roberts, Resurvey May 29, 1890. and 1891‚Äì92. > The house was expanded and altered so greatly that it looked like a quite > different sort of dwelling than before. George tore down the wing which his > father had built and in its place erected an even larger extension, as tall > as the original house but of a different style of architecture. In the > course of time he also added in another direction [north] a new drawing > room, dining room, morning room and sunporch, relocated the driveway and > built various porches and balconies. Indoors the main part of the house was > redecorated to conform to the fashions of the day. Roberts also subdivided his half of the farm into generous lots, which he gave to his six children to build their own houses. T. Williams Roberts inherited Pencoyd, and demolished or refaced his father's Victorian additions. He hired architect Louis Carter Baker, Jr., a fellow vestryman of St. Asaph's Church, to restore the house in a tasteful Colonial Revival style, 1913‚Äì15.\\"Portfolio of Current Architecture,\\" The Architectural Record, vol. 37, no. 4 (April 1915), pp. 370‚Äì73. This included a 4-bay, extension of the front fa√ßade (replicating that of the original house), moving the house's main entrance to the east facade, and removing interior walls to make the original house's entire first floor an expansive livingroom. In 1937, Pencoyd stood on about , among other gentleman's farms.Property Atlas of the Main Line, Penna. (Franklin Survey Company, 1937), plate 8. After World War II, he sold land at the northwest corner of City and Monument Avenues to the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin for WCAU-TV, the newspaper's local television station. Architect George Howe designed the International Style television studio building (1951‚Äì52),WCAU-TV Station, from Philadelphia Architects and Buildings. one of his final works. T. Williams Roberts died in 1962. His nephew, architect George B. Roberts, made measured drawings of Pencoyd. HABS photographer Cortlandt V. D. Hubbard photographed it in 1963, and architect James C. Massey completed his HABS survey of it in 1964. This activity was in expectation of the house's demolition and the property's development as a suburban office campus. The Estate of T. Williams Roberts sold the house in 1964, the same year it was demolished. A Saks Fifth Avenue department store now occupies the house's site.

Farm Algernon Roberts's 1791 stone barn, in 1963. At the end of the 17th century, John Roberts's principal crop was barley (for making malt), but he also grew Indian corn (for livestock) and wheat. His son, Richard, made wheat his principal crop (ground into flour), and provided beef, pork, eggs, fruits and vegetables, and butter to the growing Philadelphia marketplace. By the time of John Roberts 2nd, the wonderfully fertile soil was becoming exhausted. He began mixing lime into the soil, and even built his own kiln for burning lime. The farm's wooden barn was struck by lightning, September 3, 1760, burning it and other outbuildings. He wrote: \\"all that had a farmer[']s store for man and beast were laid to ashes.\\"David Loth, Pencoyd and the Roberts Family (New York: by the author, 1961). A new barn (probably wooden) was built, funded in part by donations from Quaker neighbors. Algernon Roberts concluded that there was more profit to be made in eggs and dairy products than meat. He rented a market stall on Philadelphia's High Street, staffed on market days (Wednesdays and Saturdays) by his tenant farmer and wife. One year, they sold 922 pounds of butter. In 1791, he built a large stone barn at the north end of the farm. The barn's size was considered so extreme that Merion Meeting censured him for \\"excessive ostentation.\\" In 1827, his son, Isaac Warner Roberts, insured the barn for more than the house. The insurance survey listed the barn's dimensions----and \\"noted that there were 20 stalls [for cows] with earth floors, racks and mangers. The rest of the ground floor was taken up by 'fodder gangs, fodder rooms, etc.,' the floors of which were of rough oak planks. Upstairs was a threshing floor of oak boards two inches thick. The rest of the structure was devoted to hay mows. The barn was protected by two lightning rods.\\" The \\"back barn\\" was still standing in 1963, when HABS photographed it. Isaac Warner Roberts insured the stables and a carriage house (east of the main house) in 1827,Mutual Assurance Company, Policy #4614, Isaac Warner Roberts, Survey November 28, 1827. which were altered in 1863, and replaced in 1893. He divided the farm in half between his two sons. On the eastern half, son Algernon Sidney Roberts (and his cousin) opened a specialty iron foundry, Pencoyd Iron Works, along the Schuylkill River. George Brooke Roberts turned the western half into a model dairy farm, with a herd of Guernsey cows. He erected a new farmhouse, tool house and chicken house, and the eaves of the barn were extended into an \\"over shot\\" (shed roof) in 1886. He demolished the old greenhouse in 1890, and replaced it with a new \\"Iron and Wooden one.\\" His farm also featured an ice pond and spring house. A new bridge carrying City Avenue over the Schuylkill River was completed in May 1890. City Avenue was paved and gas streetlights were erected. Farm Road, which separated the two halves of the farm, was renamed Monument Road, and paved in 1891. Some of the farm buildings were converted into residences in the early 20th century. By the time of T. Williams Roberts's death in 1962, the size of the farm was down to about . Church of Saint Asaph Church of Saint Asaph, 1888 perspective drawing by architect Theophilus P. Chandler. Entrance to St. Asaph's Church from Conshohocken State Road (left), in 2019 George Brooke Roberts had been born a Quaker, but became an Episcopalian prior to his 1868 marriage to Sarah Lapsley Brinton. She died the following year, at age 23, after giving birth to their only child, George Brinton Roberts. He married Miriam Williams in 1874, and they had five children together. Roberts was the driving force behind building the Church of Saint Asaph. Roberts obtained permission to create a new Episcopal parish, organized its Board of Trustees, and hosted its first vestry meeting, at Pencoyd, on November 16, 1887.Joan Church Roberts, Our First One Hundred Years, 1888‚Äì1988: The Church of Saint Asaph (Church of Saint Asaph, 1992). At the second vestry meeting, December 12, 1887, several sites along City Avenue were discussed, and the name \\"Saint Asaph\\" was chosen. At the third vestry meeting, January 30, 1888, architect Theophilus P. Chandler, Jr. was an invited guest. He submitted a general plan for a church, which was accepted, and he was elected to the vestry that night. At that same meeting, Roberts announced that he and his sisters wished to donate land at the west end of Pencoyd Farm, along Conshohocken State Road, as the site for the church, which the vestry also accepted. Chandler may have based his design on Saint Asaph Cathedral, a small 14th-century cathedral in Saint Asaph, Denbighshire, Wales. Superficially, both churches share a squat, flat-roofed tower at the crossing. Excavation was to begin in mid-March, but was interrupted by the Great Blizzard of 1888. The church's cornerstone was laid, May 8, 1888. Chandler also designed the church's rectory, which Roberts donated in thanksgiving for the birth of his daughter Miriam that summer. The opening service in the nearly-completed church was held on March 24, 1889. The following Sunday, Chandler placed the signed bill for his services in the collection plate, indicating that he regarded it as paid in full, along with a monetary contribution. Roberts was the church's first rector's warden, serving until his death in 1897. He was initially buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery, but was later reinterred in the church's cemetery. His son, T. Williams Roberts, served as a vestryman for 42 years, and accounting warden for 29 years. Architect Louis Carter Baker, Jr. designed alterations to the church and rectory, and served on the vestry from 1908 to his death in 1915. Pencoyd Iron Works In 1852, Algernon Sidney Roberts (who would later inherit the eastern half of Pencoyd farm) and his cousin Percival Roberts founded the A. & P. Roberts Company, a specialty iron foundry located along the Schuylkill River, opposite Manayunk. The company initially made railroad equipment, but soon began manufacturing iron bridge members.The History of the Pencoyd Iron Works, from Penn Real Estate Group. It won the contract to manufacture all the structural elements for the cast-iron-and-glass Main Exhibition Building and Machinery Hall at the 1876 Centennial Exposition. The Main Exhibition Building was to be the largest building in the world. Designed by Wilson Brothers & Company, it was in length, in width, and enclosed of space. Machinery Hall, also designed by the Wilson Brothers, was in length, in width, and enclosed . After the World's Fair, the buildings were auctioned off, disassembled, and their structural elements were reused in other buildings. Pencoyd Iron Works became a major bridge producer, manufacturing and constructing hundreds of bridges in the United States. The company built Pencoyd Village ‚Äì a community of 70 worker houses, a public school and a public library ‚Äì all squeezed between Pencoyd Farm and West Laurel Hill Cemetery. The company was purchased by J. P. Morgan in 1900, one of 28 companies consolidated into the American Bridge Company. The American Bridge Company became part of United States Steel in 1902. Pencoyd Iron Works closed in the 1940s, and most of the steel mill was demolished in the 1950s for construction of the Schuylkill Expressway. The \\"Pencoyd Bridge over Schuylkill River,\\" a two-span, 1899 iron Parker truss bridge that connected the foundry to Manayunk, is now part of the Pencoyd Trail and open to pedestrians and bikes.

It is a nationally designated Place of Scenic Beauty.  Overview  One onomatological explanation is that it was named \\"Bed of Awakening\\" because the stunning view stimulated even drowsy onlookers such that they would become wide awake. There are naturally occurring eroded granite rock formations here, and some of these are claimed to resemble the shapes of lions, lotus flower, etc. Folk tradition claims that the name derives from Urashima Tar≈ç experiencing an \\"awakening\\" here, that is, the sensation that everything in his life up to then was as if in a dream. It was selected as one of nationally designated places of scenic beauty in Nagano. (17MB file) There used to be rapid currents that created the formation, but the water level has lowered due to such factors as the Kiso Dam upstream that came into operation in 1968 , exposing more of the granite formation which used to be underwater. History There have been waka poetry composed on the Kiso scenery while traveling the Nakasend≈ç that employed \\"nezame\\" as keyword (utamakura). Rinsenji The in Agematsu stands on a cliff overlooking the strange rock formations of Nezame no toko. According to the engi (story of origin) of this temple, which stands nearby overlooking the scenery, Rinsenji originally enshrined the Benten statue which local legend said Urashima had left behind. The temple totally burnt down in 1864, except for the Benten-d≈ç, and rebuilt the following year. A new main hall, restored to its original appearance was erected in 1971. The surviving Benten-d≈ç structure was completed 1712 under the auspices of Tokugawa Yoshimichi, fourth daimy≈ç of the Owari Domain. There is also the Urashima-d≈ç, which is a distinctly separate structure. It has stood on top of the tokoiwa (\\"Bed Rock\\"). The temple's treasure hall houses a fishing pole, alleged to have belonged to Urashima.  Mikaeri no okina  According to folk tradition, there resided in the hamlet of Nezame an old man named who provided wonder- medicine to the folk. The noh play from the late Muromachi Period is based on this tradition. In the Noh play, the Emperor of Japan during the Engi Era hears of the elixir of longevity, and sends a messenger from court to investigate. The old man reveals himself to be an avatar of the Yakushi Nyorai, calling himself , and presents the medicine. It is explained that he has lived at Nezame no toko for a thousand years, and has rejuvenated himself three times with the medicine, earning the name Mikaeri meaning \\"thrice reverted\\".  Urashima Tar≈ç legend  Urashima Tar≈ç and turtle at Fukushima- juku station on the Kiso-kaid≈ç path. Although this is in the mountainous terrain of Kiso and far from any ocean, there has arisen a local tradition associating the spot with Urashima Tar≈ç, the man who went to the Dragon Palace beyond the sea. One of the oldest known records indicating local association of this scenic spot with Urashima Tar≈ç is the mention of the so-called Urashima-ga-tsuri-ishi (\\"Urashima's fishing stone\\") by Zen priest Takuan in his travelogue Kisoji kik≈ç ki. Kaibara Ekken also says in his Kisoji no ki (1685) that he witnessed the \\"Nezame no toko where Urashima fished,\\" but he is skeptical about Urashima ever visiting this area. According to the or story of the founding of Rinsen-ji, Urashima Tar≈ç had returned from the Dragon Palace (Ry≈´g≈´-j≈ç) with three gifts: the \\"jeweled hand box\\" (tamatebako), a Benzaiten statue, and a book of knowledge entitled the Manp≈çshinsho (‰∏áÂÆùÁ•ûÊõ∏). After traveling various parts of Japan, he settled in a beautiful village by Kiso River. He lived here many years fishing for leisure, while peddling the medicine he had learned to conjure using the esoteric book. One day while storytelling to the villagers about the Dragon Palace, he opened his box, and turned into a 300-year-old man. On the 1st year of Tenkei (938) he disappeared from the face of the earth. The Ryaku-engi has gone through many reprints, with the oldest surviving being the revised print of 1756, However, the gist of the legend is thought to have been established earlier, from the near-modern period. From some point in local tradition, The Mikaeri no okina and Urashima Tar≈ç came to be seen as the same personage. The Ryaku-engii also states that Urashima earned the moniker for being the provender of the magical drug to the villagers.„ÄÇ An old, pre-Takemoto j≈çruri called Urashima Tar≈ç was written with this Agematsu area as its setting.

Features  The temple is renowned for a century-old Buddha statue nicknamed the \\"Lifting Buddha\\". Urban legend has it that the statue contains the ability to predict whether a devotee's wishes can be fulfilled. If the statue can be lifted the first time the devotee concentrates on his or her wishes, and subsequently becomes too heavy to lift the second time, then the devotee's wish is indeed attainable. Although founded as a TheravƒÅda Buddhist temple with the layout of Thai tradition, the temple are decorated with various mythical religious creatures of NƒÅgas with the mixture of Hindu and Taoist deities such as the statue of Ganesha which is placed at the main entrance while in the left located a shrine specifically for Guan Yin.

There is some dispute at the local level as to the claim of being the first to establish a local board or health department. At least four cities claim to be the first health department in the United States. The city of Yakima, WA claims to be the oldest in the nation, established in 1911, the city of Petersburg, Virginia, claims it established the first permanent board of health in 1780. The city of Baltimore, Maryland, claims it established the first US health department in 1793, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, followed 1794, claiming its Board of Health as \\"one of the first\\". And Boston, Massachusetts, claims in 1799 it established the first board of health and the first health department, with Paul Revere named as the first health officer.  State health departments  Each state health agency initially followed local moves to create health departments in each state. Louisiana was the first state to create a state board of health in 1855, but it functioned primarily to influence regulations in New Orleans. Massachusetts was the first to establish a state board that functioned throughout its state with statewide authority in 1869.  United States Department of Health and Human Services  At the national level, a simple National Board of Health functioned from 1879‚Äì1883. Not until 1939 was another federal agency established to manage public health on a national level. It went through several iterations a federal agency called the Federal Security Agency that had health functions such as the United States Public Health Service (PHS), and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In 1953, that agency was reorganized and its health functions were elevated to a cabinet-level position to establish the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW), which was renamed in 1980 to become the current and modern United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  Current laws and regulations overview  HHS notes the laws and regulations that it carries out on its website. Every state also has a health department to which HHS has given a description and hyperlink for each state health department. Other levels of government within each state are varied. For example, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has within it a health department in each of its 58 subdivisions called counties, but only three cities. One is in San Francisco: the San Francisco Department of Public Health; and two are in Los Angeles County: the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services and the Pasadena Public Health Department.

It has been found to play a significant role in the antidepressant effects of doxepin. Nordoxepin is a mixture of (E) and (Z) stereoisomers. Whereas pharmaceutical doxepin is supplied in an approximate 85:15 ratio mixture of (E)- and (Z)-stereoisomers and plasma concentrations of doxepin remain roughly the same as this ratio with treatment, plasma levels of the (E)- and (Z)-stereoisomers of nordoxepin, due to stereoselective metabolism of doxepin by cytochrome P450 enzymes, are approximately 1:1. Nordoxepin is pharmacologically active similarly to doxepin, but relative to doxepin, is much more potent and selective as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. In general, the demethylated variants of tertiary amine TCAs like doxepin are much more potent inhibitors of norepinephrine reuptake, less potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake, and less potent in their antiadrenergic, antihistamine, and anticholinergic activities. Nordoxepin is formed from doxepin mainly by CYP2C19 (>50% contribution), while CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 are involved to a lesser extent, and CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are not involved. Hydroxylation of doxepin and nordoxepin is mediated mainly by CYP2D6. Total exposures to both doxepin and nordoxepin differ by almost 10-fold in CYP2D6 ultra-rapid versus poor metabolizers. Both doxepin and nordoxepin are also transformed into glucuronide conjugates. The elimination half-life of nordoxepin is approximately 31 hours, which is almost twice that of doxepin (mean 17 hours).

This style can be applied to interior design, decor and other areas. Vintage design is popular and vintage items have risen in price. Outlets of vintage design have shifted from thrift store to shabby chic stores. Terminology There is debate over what determines if an item is vintage. Some rely on the definition of anything old and of value. Others create a more limited bracket dictating only objects old enough to have been \\"used\\", but not more than two generations old. The terms vintage, retro, and antique are oftentimes used interchangeably and have some overlay, however the words possess different meanings. Retro refers to styles of a previous era, while vintage refers to an older object that contains important value, and lastly antique refers an item of the previous era or at least 100 years old. A related term is antiquity, which indicates something of past eras, or simply put, ancient. Sectors Vintage design contains various subcategories or sectors. Art Deco Art Deco was created in the hopes of looking modern and man made back in the 1920s and 1930s when it was popular. This style features mostly geometric shapes, symmetrical patterns, and idealized human figures. Art Nouveau Art Nouveau is a style containing curved lines, flowers and other plants, contrasting colors, ornate colors, young women, and intricate details. It was created at the end of the 1800s and gained popularity at the start of the 1910s. Vintage badges Badges call back to the late 19th and early 20th century with fonts, and images that represent ink stamped onto paper. Letterpress Letterpress is simple with limited colors and fonts. The style is similar to that of a printing press with indents in the paper or the resemblance of indents. Mid-century modern Mid-century modern style makes use of straight, clear lines, curved objects, wood tones, thin supporting, and oversized objects. It is meant to call back to the mid-20th century. Punk The punk counterculture style of the 1970s is reused today. It contains harsh lines, clashing colors, juxtaposition, and mixed images to create an off kilter picture. Steampunk Steampunk is a mash of Victorian technology and futuristic images to create a steam-powered aesthetic. Atomic Age The Atomic Age creates an idea of a \\"optimistic, modern world based on a 1950s and 1960s vision of space exploration\\". (Kramer 20) Swiss Style Swiss Style (International Typographic Style) contains broad block letters in contrast with a solid background to create a 3D effect. Vaporwave Vaporwave style couples imagery of the 1980s and 1990s with soft pastels to create a picture reminded of what \\"one might see in a video game or a surrealist photograph\\".

The integrated design of the article for both esthetic and functional qualities is also a major part of the process of manufacturing furniture.\\" The popularity of vintage design and vintage inspired items can be seen through media. In 2004 designer Nicolas Ghesqui√®re created a line for Balenciaga which called back to older collections. Tom Ford's collection for her also uses references to the past. Vintage design can also be seen in ads which promote vintage inspired clothing. There are several reasons for vintage designs popularity.

Written by Christopher Hollier & Adam Karp and directed by Steve Pearlman, it premiered on ABC in the United States on December 8, 2017. In the episode, the origins of Rapunzel and her connection to Anastasia is revealed, in a backstory that ties in Victoria's scheme to bait Lucy into bringing Anastasia back to life. Plot Opening sequence Flying lanterns are featured in the background. In the Characters' Past In the New Realm, Rapunzel (a young Lady Tremaine) tries to get radishes from Mother Gothel's garden to save her sick husband and feed their hungry children. Gothel agrees to give her the radishes in exchange for trapping Rapunzel in her tower. After 6 years of captivity, Rapunzel manages to cut off most of her hair and use it as a rope to climb out of the tower. She succeeds in doing so only to find her husband remarried to Cecilia and raising a stepdaughter, Ella. Gothel reappears and tempts her into making Cecilia flee with a mushroom from New Wonderland. Rapunzel at first disagrees, only to become increasingly jealous of Cecilia's bond with her girls and ends up making her flee to New Wonderland. Her husband chases her, but eventually gives up and comes back to Rapunzel to make a perfect family. One winter day, while playing outside, both Anastasia and Ella fall through thin ice. Marcus jumps in, however, he ended up only saving Ella and not Anastasia, since he claims he could only save one of them. A distraught Rapunzel brings her daughter to Gothel, who manages to magically preserve Anastasia's last breath at the price of keeping her in the tower, which explains why Anastasia has been in this comatose state. Unknown to Gothel, Rapunzel snatches the potion that sends people to the tower and uses it on Gothel, leaving Gothel trapped in the tower until someone in her bloodline takes her place, which in the future will be baby Alice. Rapunzel vows to her daughter that she will find a way to save her. In Seattle In the present day, Victoria is confronted by Ivy, who wants her mother to give up her plan to revive Anastasia, which falls on Victoria's deaf ears. Victoria later strikes a deal with Weaver to help him find the Guardian in an attempt to free herself from jail and wake Anastasia. During this confrontation, Victoria and Weaver acknowledge each other as Rapunzel and Rumpelstiltskin, respectively. With Weaver releasing Victoria, a furious Rogers isn't happy about this, so he starts looking into a storage area that Weaver keeps hidden and discovers a treasure trove of information on everything about the residents, including Rogers. Later on with Sabine's help, Rogers discovers that Sabine had once been confronted by Weaver, and that he asked her to clutch a knife. She draws the knife to show Rogers, and it is revealed to be the Dark One's dagger. He catches up with Weaver to demand answers and Weaver tells Rogers that he was doing all this in order to find Belle. Rogers believes him and agreed to help Weaver. After she is released, Victoria strangely gives full custody of Lucy to Jacinda, claiming to be \\"a changed person\\" after jail but used surveillance set up in the apartment to spy on Jacinda and Nick, who later came by to verify the custody papers as authentic, then gave each other a brief and accidental kiss. Victoria then goes on a mission with Weaver to find Henry's original ‚ÄúOnce Upon a Time‚Äù storybook. They are knowingly tailgated by Ivy and Gothel. At the hospital, Victoria shows Lucy her family's life story in the book. Using a deceiving ploy to end her beliefs, she convinces Lucy that happy endings aren't real, since Victoria didn't get hers. She also shows Lucy video footage of Jacinda and Nick kissing and tells her that Henry and Roni left town, but lies about Henry giving up on Lucy. All of this completely shatters Lucy's belief in happy endings, causing her to cry, then run home to Jacinda. Victoria then drops Lucy's tear on Anastasia. Anastasia wakes and is revived, while, at exactly the same time, Lucy collapses at home in Jacinda's arms. Anastasia recognizes her mother, and they embrace, but this is watched from afar by an upset and jealous Drizella/Ivy and she walks away from her sister's hospital room in tears.

He was best known for being the initiator of the Ruo'ao rebellion, a rebellion of Ruo'ao clan against King Zhuang of Chu.  Life  Yuejiao was the son of Dou Ziliang () and the nephew of Dou Guwutu (). His family was a cadet branch of Chu's ruling house Mi-Xiong. The Ruo'ao clan; consists of Dou and Cheng, descended from king Ruo'ao of Chu. When Yuejiao was young, he was said to be resented by his uncle Guwutu. Guwutu, according to Zuo Zhuan, described him a \\"wolf poppy with a savage heart\\"() and believed that Yuejiao will bring disasters to the Ruo'ao clan. Viscount Xuan of Zhao, a retainer of Jin, also had a negative view on the Ruo'ao clan led by Yuejiao. King Zhuang of Chu succeeded Chu's throne in a young age, Cheng Jia () of Ruo'ao was the Lingyin of Chu. The king find himself devoid of any actual political influence over his nation. After Cheng Jia's death, King Zhuang promoted Wei Jia () to the post of Lingyin, weakening Ruo'aos power. Wei Jia was explicitly hostile to Ruo'aos. Under his advice, the King executed prime minister Dou Ban. Although king Zhuang soon appointed Yuejiao as the successor of Ban, Wei Jia was given the post of Sima, the supreme military commander of Chu. This arrangement of power intensified the hostilities between Ruo'ao and Wei clan. Since Wei Jia and King Zhuang's had become imminent threats to the Ruo'ao clan. Yuejiao reacted to this predicament by imprisoning Wei Jia in Liaoyang (Today's Nanyang, Henan province) and killing him. He then organized his troops in Zhengye (Today's Xinye) and openly started an armed rebellion against king Zhuang of Chu in 605 BCE. The rebellion was initially successful and king Zhuang had agreed to truce. However, Yuejiao rejected the king's proposal and fought with him in the battle of Gaohu (Today's Xiangyang). The battle turned out to be a victory of king Zhuang. Yuejiao was killed during the battle. After the rebellion was put down, the majority of Ruo'ao clansmen were executed by King Zhuang of Chu. Only Dou Kehuang, the son of Yuejiao's cousin Dou Ban, was forgiven. The fall of Ruo'aos were still mentioned more than 17 centuries later by Sima Guang in his work Zizhi Tongjian. Even long after the death of Dou Yuejiao, the remaining members of Ruo'ao clan were severely discriminated in Chu. In 530 BCE, more than seventy years after the Ruo'ao rebellion, king Ling of Chu executed Cheng Hu () due to the fact that he was a Ruo'ao. Yuejiao's son Dou Benhuang () fled to the state of Jin and would later avenge his father's death in the battle of Yanling.

Born into an old Alsatian family, he joined an infantry regiment at the age of 14. In 1807 he became the commanding officer of the 1st Cuirassier Regiment. In 1809 he led his cavalrymen at Eckm√ºhl, Ratisbon, Aspern-Essling and Wagram. Promoted to general of brigade, he fought at First and Second Polotsk and the Berezina in 1812. He led a cavalry brigade at L√ºtzen and Bautzen in 1813. Promoted to general of division, he led a cavalry division at Dresden, Leipzig and Hanau. He commanded a cavalry division at Arcis-sur-Aube in 1814. He became an inspector general and a member of the Chamber of Deputies in 1815 and 1816. His surname is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 12. Early career Berckheim was born on 9 May 1775 in Ribeauvill√© in the French province of Alsace. The village later became part of the Haut- Rhin department. The Berckheims were an old Alsatian aristocratic family. His father was Philipp Friedrich de Berckheim (1732‚Äì1812), a captain in the Regiment of Alsace and deputy in the 1787 assembly of Alsace. In 1766 his father married his mother, Marie-Octavie-Louise de Glaubitz. Sigismond was the third of seven children and the first born son. His siblings were Caroline- Octavie-Louise (1771‚Äì1842), Louise-Henriette-Sophie (b. 1772), Louise-Am√©lie (1776‚Äì1855), Fr√©d√©rique-Fran√ßoise (b. 1778), Chr√©tien-Fr√©d√©ric (1781‚Äì1832) and Philippe-Gustave (1783‚Äì1812). At the age of 14, in about 1789, Berckheim entered the Infantry Regiment of Lamarck as a sous-lieutenant and progressed through the grades in rank. Though there are records of his L√©gion d'Honneur awards, the French archive for Berckheim is missing the important document Etat de Services et Campagnes (Statement of Service and Campaigns). The regiments and campaigns in which he served between 1789 and 1805 are unknown. For example, the records for his younger brother Chr√©tien-Fr√©d√©ric exist. These show that Chr√©tien joined the French military service as a guide for Jean Victor Marie Moreau on 22 March 1800 and was promoted to chef d'escadron (major) on 4 November 1813. Empire 1805‚Äì1811 Berckheim became a member of the L√©gion d'Honneur on 6 August 1805. He was appointed colonel of the 1st Cuirassier Regiment on 1 April 1807. As part of the 2nd Cuirassier Division, the 1st Cuirassiers were involved in a skirmish at K√∂nigsberg on 14 June 1807, the same day as the Battle of Friedland, which the regiment missed. According to one source, Berckheim fought at both Friedland and the Battle of Heilsberg. However, the battle honors of the 1st Cuirassiers do not include either action. At the beginning of the War of the Fifth Coalition, the 1st Cuirassiers (793-strong) formed part of the 2nd Heavy Cavalry Division of Raymond-Gaspard de Bonardi de Saint-Sulpice. At first, the division was attached to III Corps, but Emperor Napoleon soon assigned it to a provisional corps led by Marshal Jean Lannes along with another heavy cavalry division under √âtienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty, a cavalry brigade led by Charles Claude Jacquinot and two infantry divisions borrowed from III Corps. At the Battle of Abensberg on 20 April 1809, Lannes' corps and the Bavarian VII Corps smashed the Austrian left flank, killing and wounding 2,700 enemies and capturing 4,000 more. However, one brigade from Saint-Sulpice's division was assigned to guard the defile at Saal an der Donau. The battle honors of the 1st Cuirassiers do not include Abensberg, but they do include the next four major actions in 1809. At the Battle of Eckm√ºhl on the afternoon of 22 April 1809, the key to the Austrian position was the Bettelberg, a hill topped by a 16-gun battery of artillery and defended by the Austrian IV Corps under Franz Seraph of Orsini-Rosenberg. Some Bavarian cavalry tried to overrun the hill but were driven off. Next, Saint-Sulpice's four cuirassier regiments, two W√ºrttemberg cavalry regiments and the rallied Bavarians charged the Bettelberg again. Despite counterattacks by Austrian horsemen and blasts of canister shot from the guns, the Allies seized the hill, capturing most of the cannons. Rosenberg immediately ordered his beaten corps to retreat. At 7:00 pm that evening there was a cavalry melee that involved perhaps 15,000 horsemen. On the Allied side were Nansouty's 24 squadrons of cuirassiers and six squadrons of W√ºrttemberg cavalry in the first line. In the second line were Saint- Sulpice's 16 squadrons and in reserve there were 10 to 14 Bavarian squadrons. They were opposed by 32 squadrons of Austrian cavalry. The more numerous Allied cavalry routed the Austrians. As Saint-Sulpice's division led the pursuit, it encountered two battalions of Austrian grenadiers formed in squares and completely smashed them. At 9:00 pm the pursuit ended due to the exhaustion of the Allied cavalry. Saint-Sulpice's cuirassiers (left) wait in reserve at the Battle of Teugen-Hausen on 19 April 1809. On the morning of 23 April in the Battle of Ratisbon, there was another wild cavalry melee between 56 squadrons of Austrian horsemen and the French cavalry of Nansouty, Saint- Sulpice and Louis-Pierre Montbrun. The struggle went on for two hours before the Austrians withdrew. On 15 May, the 1st Cuirassiers numbered 527 troopers. At the Battle of Aspern-Essling on 21‚Äì22 May, the division of Saint-Sulpice reached the battlefield late on the first day as Napoleon found himself with 31,400 soldiers facing 100,000 Austrians with a river at his back. Reinforced in the night to 50,000 infantry, 12,000 cavalry and 144 guns, Napoleon ordered an advance by his infantry and cavalry on the Austrian center. This attack pressed back the Austrians until their army commander Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen led forward the Reserve Corps. Despite a series of cavalry charges, the French were pushed back into their small bridgehead and forced to retreat that night. At the Battle of Wagram on 5‚Äì6 July 1809, the 1st Cuirassiers numbered 486 men. At mid-morning a crisis arose as the Austrian III and VI Corps advanced menacingly against Napoleon's left flank. The VI Corps brushed aside an isolated French infantry division on the far left while the III Corps threatened to smash the Franco-Allied left center. To gain time, Napoleon ordered Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessi√®res to lead the divisions of Nansouty and Antoine-Louis Decrest de Saint-Germain (leading Saint-Sulpice's former division) in charging the Austrians. While the Austrians were occupied in fending off the French heavy cavalry, Napoleon collected a battery of over 100 artillery pieces backed by Jacques MacDonald's corps and the Imperial Guard. At the same time the French emperor ordered Marshal Andr√© Mass√©na to march his corps from the center to the left flank. A little later, Saint-Germain's horsemen were instructed to cover Mass√©na's maneuver. These measures were successful in halting the Austrian advance, but the heavy cavalry lost 1,200 horses, not counting the human casualties. Berckheim was appointed officer of the L√©gion d'Honneur on 11 July 1809 and promoted general of brigade the following day. He was named a Baron of the Empire on 9 March 1810. His younger brother Chr√©tien-Fr√©d√©ric became his aide de camp on 12 November 1811. Berckheim was appointed aide de camp to Napoleon's equerry Alexis Jean Henri Duverger. 1812‚Äì1814 French Cuirassier in 1809 Berckheim led a cavalry brigade during the French invasion of Russia in 1812. The brigade was part of Jean-Pierre Doumerc's 3rd Cuirassier Division in the III Cavalry Corps under Emmanuel de Grouchy. Like all three of Doumerc's brigades, Berckheim's brigade consisted of only one strong regiment, the 4th Cuirassiers, with 35 officers and 821 rank and file. The other two brigades were led by Samuel-Fran√ßois Lh√©ritier (7th Cuirassiers) and Ignace Laurent Oullenbourg (14th Cuirassiers). At the First Battle of Polotsk on 18 August 1812, Marshal Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr surprised the Russians and drove them back. The Russian commander Peter Wittgenstein ordered a cavalry counterattack led by elements of the Chevalier Guard Regiment that broke through a gap in the Franco-Allied lines. Saint-Cyr repulsed the Russians when he threw in a Swiss infantry regiment and Berckheim's 4th Cuirassiers. Doumerc's division also fought at the Second Battle of Polotsk on 18‚Äì20 October 1812. The 23,000 Franco-Allies fought 40,000 Russians to a draw, but the survivors were so few that they had to retreat. On 26 November, the 3rd Cuirassier Division fought at the Battle of Berezina. That day Marshal Nicolas Oudinot with 11,000 infantry and Doumerc's cuirassiers assumed a position covering the key bridges over which Napoleon's army was escaping. On 27 November, Oudinot's troops repelled enemy attacks, but on the following day the Russians were close to breaking through. Doumerc's horsemen made a climactic charge and crushed the Russians with heavy losses; after that, they declined to close with the French. Berckheim's youngest brother Philippe-Gustave became a captain of cuirassiers and died during the 1812 campaign. At the Battle of L√ºtzen on 2 May 1813, Berckheim commanded the 1st Brigade in √âtienne Tardif de Pommeroux de Bordesoulle's 1st Heavy Cavalry Division in the I Cavalry Corps. The 363-man brigade consisted of the 2nd (151), 3rd (110) and 6th Cuirassiers (102). According to one source, only the 2nd Cuirassiers came into action that day. On 20‚Äì21 May at the Battle of Bautzen, Berckheim's brigade numbered 504 troopers of the 2nd (210), 3rd (199) and 6th Cuirassiers (95). This time only the 3rd Cuirassiers were engaged in action. For the Battle of Dresden on 26‚Äì27 August 1813, Berckheim commanded the 1st Light Cavalry Division in Victor de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg's I Cavalry Corps. The division arrived late on the first day, but participated in Marshal Joachim Murat's grand cavalry attack on the second day. In this action, the 1st Light Cavalry Division attacked an Austrian infantry square and forced it to surrender. Because it was raining hard, most foot soldiers could not fire their muskets, allowing the cavalry to approach very close to the infantry. Berckheim was promoted general of division on 3 September 1813. During the Battle of Leipzig on 16‚Äì19 October 1813, the 1st Light Cavalry Division numbered 1,850 sabers and had nine artillery pieces attached. Both Berckheim and Jean Corbineau are listed as the commander. The three cavalry brigades were led by Hippolyte Pir√©, Aime-Sulpice Pelletier de Montmarie and Cyrille Simon Picquet. Pire's brigade included the 6th, 7th and 8th Hussars; Montmarie's brigade consisted of the 1st and 3rd Chevau-l√©ger Lancers and the 16th Chasseurs √† Cheval; and Picquet's brigade comprised the 5th and 8th Lancers. Montmarie was killed in the fighting. At the Battle of Hanau on 30‚Äì31 October, Berckheim led the 1st Light Cavalry Division. The units which came into action were the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 8th Lancers, 7th Hussars, 16th Chasseurs √† Cheval and 1st Italian Chasseurs √† Cheval. At the beginning of the Allied invasion of France at the end of December 1813, the commander of the V Cavalry Corps, √âdouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud suggested to Napoleon that Alsatian volunteers might be formed into a cavalry-infantry legion. Milhaud recommended that the locally popular Berckheim be appointed its leader. However, Napoleon did not authorize the unit's formation. In March 1814, Berckheim took command of an 1,807-strong cavalry division consisting of two brigades under Jean Nicolas Curely and Pierre Mourier. Curely's brigade was made up of the 1st (406), 2nd (492) and 3rd (179) Provisional Regiments of Hussars, Chasseurs √† Cheval and Lancers. Mourier's brigade included the 1st Provisional Regiment (501) of cuirassiers and carabineers and the 2nd Provisional Regiment (229) of dragoons. On 14 March, the new division arrived in the field with Napoleon's army. On 19 March Napoleon personally accompanied two French cavalry divisions from Plancy-l'Abbaye to M√©ry-sur-Seine. Evidently, these were the divisions of Berckheim and Louis-Michel Letort de Lorville because the next day Letort was recalled to Arcis-sur-Aube with a pontoon bridge that had been captured. In a skirmish with Allied cavalry the following afternoon, Letort's division was driven back to M√©ry despite the assistance of Curely's brigade. That night, Letort set out again, leaving the pontoons with Berckheim. On 21 March, Berckheim's division joined the main army at Arcis. These actions were part of the Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube. On 22 March, Berckheim's division accompanied Napoleon's army as it moved east, crossing the Marne River near Vitry-le-Fran√ßois. Restoration In 1816 Berckheim married Elisabeth Barthodi (1789‚Äì1858). The couple had two children, Gustave (1818‚Äì1824) and Elisabeth Octavie (1820), neither of whom survived childhood. Another source mentioned only a son who died at a young age. After Berckheim's death, Elisabeth remarried Marquis de Boubers from a noble family of Artois. During the Hundred Days, Berckheim rallied to Napoleon. This deeply troubled his older sister Henriette, who was married to the banker Augustin Perier and opposed to Napoleon's return. Under the Bourbon Restoration Berckheim was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for Haut-Rhin on 2 August 1815 and again on 4 October 1816, voting with the Constitutional Royalists. Thanks to the patronage of the Duke of Angoul√™me he was named Inspector General of Cavalry. He was made Chevalier of the Order of Saint-Louis. He died at Paris on 28 December 1819. BERCKHEIM is inscribed on the east side of the Arc de Triomphe. He is buried in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, in the 24th division, 1st line.

Among the United States' biggest 14 cities, San Francisco is near the bottom in the percentage of black residents. The neighboring city of Oakland, across the San Francisco Bay has been more traditionally associated with African-American culture than San Francisco proper, although blacks have always been a minority in Oakland as well. In the mid 20th century, the African American community in the Fillmore District earned the neighborhood the nickname the \\"Harlem of the West\\". About 9 percent of the San Francisco Police Department force was African-American in 2015. History African-Americans began coming to San Francisco during the California Gold Rush. During the Great Migration, San Francisco was a destination for African-Americans coming out of the South. War Manpower Commission recruited African Americans from the South to work the recently owned Naval Docks in Hunters Point of San Francisco. Word soon spread that African Americans could find work in San Francisco, thus began the great migration. Future In 2016, local pastor Amos C.

He is a Fellow of the IEEE and the recipient of several professional awards including the Rutgers School of Engineering Faculty of the Year Award (2017), IEEE Donald J. Fink Award (2014), Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, Distinguished Alumni Award (2012), and the Schwarzkopf Prize for Technological Innovation (2008). Dr. Raychaudhuri is a leading researcher/technologist in the field of wireless networking based on his sustained technology contributions and leadership over the past 38 years. He is acknowledged as a pioneer who helped bring broadband wireless access technology from concept to reality in the 1990s. This is a technology domain (high speed WLAN, WiMax, etc.) which has made it possible for hundreds of millions of people connect to the Internet. Prof. Raychaudhuri is also recognized today in the US academic research community as a forward-looking network architect who is leading National Science Foundation supported R&D; initiatives to innovate the future mobile Internet from a \\"clean slate\\" perspective (FIA), and to develop open, programmable wireless and network testbeds (ORBIT, GENI and COSMOS). Finally, as director of WINLAB since ~2001-, he has led development of an internationally acclaimed academic research center specializing in wireless technology, and in this capacity plays a visible leadership role in advancing basic research and education in the field. Dr. Raychaudhuri has also been active in technology entrepreneurship, helping to incubate startup companies in the wireless networking and media areas over the past 18 years. He serves as technical advisor or board member to several new technology companies, and has previously served on the advisory council of the NJ Economic Development Authority's Edison Innovation Fund. He has also served as editor of several leading journals including IEEE Transactions on Communications, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking and IEEE Communications Magazine. He has participated in several international standards committees in the telecom field, and has been an external advisor for several European and Japanese research projects and is currently a member of the international advisory council of the NICT. Notable Achievements Notable technology innovations by Prof. Raychaudhuri include design and implementation of one of the world's first broadband wireless local area networks. He published his concept for an ATM-based broadband wireless access network in a landmark paper (in IEEE J. Selected Areas in Communications, 1992) - this paper went on to become the 2nd most highly-cited journal paper in the communications field between 1990-2005 according to ISI Thomson-Reuters. Dr. Raychaudhuri's research group at NEC C&C; Laboratories in Princeton subsequently demonstrated the feasibility of reliable 25 Mbps mobile services in the 5 Ghz band and successfully conducted proof-of-concept field trials as early as 1998. Other important research results in his career include design and prototyping one of the earliest VSAT (very small aperture terminal) data networks during the 1980s. This technology enabled the first generation of data networks in the US and is still used to provide Internet access to remote areas all over the world. In the early 1990s he was a co-lead for a multi-company research team which designed one of the first HDTV systems tested by the FCC in 1991, significantly influencing the ‚ÄúATSC‚Äù digital TV standard in wide use today. After joining Rutgers as a Professor, Dr. Raychaudhuri collaborated with Ivan Seskar (Chief Technologist at WINLAB) to build the \\"ORBIT radio grid testbed\\" the world's largest open research testbed for evaluation of future wireless networking protocols. During the period 2010-18, his group at WINLAB has also developed a novel clean-slate mobility-centric future Internet architecture called ‚ÄúMobilityFirst‚Äù, which proposes a new ‚Äúnamed object‚Äù approach to Internet routing based on the use of globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) in place of conventional IP addresses. More recently, his research group at WINLAB has been leading a major NSF project funded under the Platforms for Advanced Wireless (PAWR) program aimed at deploying the city-scale, open/programmable COSMOS testbed in New York City for research on next-generation wireless networks with edge cloud capabilities. Gallery Wireless ATM Prototype Demonstration at the NEC Labs in 1996 The wireless ATM network supports the delivery of multimedia information to portable computing devices of the future. Dipankar Raychaudhuri, Bob Siracusa, Cesar Johnston, Subir Biswas, and Max Ott demonstrate CCRL's WATMnet prototype. The NEC laptop computer in the foreground serves as a personal information appliance (PIA) which retrieves multimedia streams (such as MPEG video) over the microcellular wireless ATM network. The prototype system is capable of supporting standard ATM services at the portable terminal, with Quality-of-Service (QoS) control and handoff of active connections from one macrocell base station to another. The CCRL team has made seminal contributions to the field of wireless ATM, and has played a key role in forming a working group on this subject within the ATM forum.

Her first name is sometimes given as Sira Mori and Siramory, while her last name is sometimes spelled Jabat√©. Biography Diabat√© was born in the village of Kela, in Koulikoro Region. The town is famous for the griots born there, and Diabat√© was from a family notable for its talents. Her grandfather, Kelabalaba, was said to be the first member of his extended family to be the official reciter of the Sundiata Epic, while her father, Bintu'amma, was well known as a musician, especially for his prowess on the ngoni. Diabat√© herself was part of a younger generation, which learned from its roots but which incorporated facets of modern urban life into its performances. She began to develop a regional reputation by the early 1940s, particularly for her song \\"Sara\\", about a young woman torn between the arranged marriage her parents desire and her own wish to marry for love. She also recited the Sundiata Epic; her performances of this and other songs led to interest from French ethnomusicologists, and their recordings increased her popularity even further, to the point that she was better known than most male griots, even. The socialist Malian government presented her as a figure of cultural pride, and regularly played her music on state radio. She continued to be visited by anthropologists and historians into the 1970s. Diabat√© was greatly influential to the next generation of Malian musicians, such as Salif Keita and Rokia Traor√©, and she worked with Western scholars such as Barbara Hoffman as well. She was once described as \\"knowing all the Mand√©\\". It was often rumored that Diabat√© had used supernatural means to affect the quality of her voice. While singing she sometimes accompanied herself on the guitar. Relatively few of her performances survived on disc, although a handful were recorded in 1974 and others several months before her death. These are still available on compact disc. She was married to balafon player Nankoman Kouyat√©; several of their children have also become musicians, and her nephew Kass√© Mady Diabat√© is a singer. Musicologist Jan Jansen, who worked with Diabat√© on research, claimed that he had taken his jamu, or ascribed patronymic, Sidiki Kouyat√©, from the name of her husband, due to the closeness of their association.

An accompanying music video was released on the same day. Music video Synopsis In this video, Reid appears to be going through the motions of his showbiz career and livens up at a house party. We then see Reid sitting contemplating on a roof before eventually joining his friends in a wild, wild house party.

Taxonomic history and synonyms This species was described in 1887 by Frederick DuCane Godman and Osbert Salvin in Biologia Centrali-Americana. They placed it in the genus Thecla. In 1969, William D. Field transferred the species to his newly-circumscribed genus Calystryma. Then, in 1991, Kurt Johnson transferred it his newly-circumscribed genus Klaufera to be its type species. In the same paper, Johnson described a species he named Serratoterga larsoni to honor the American cartoonist Gary Larson; this was the type species of Serratoterga. In 2004, R. K. Robins synonymized the two species and transferred it to the genus Calycopis, making C. larsoni an invalid junior synonym. Distribution It has been found in several parts of Latin America, including Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Honduras, Ecuador, Belize, Mexico (in the states of Veracruz and Oaxaca) and in northern Brazil. H. L. Lewis listed a specimen of C. pisis as being from the island of Trinidad, but other lepidopterists have said they believe this to be an error. A type locality was not initially specified, but the specimen designated as the lectotype was collected in Bugaba, Chiriqu√≠ Province, Panama. The type locality for the junior synonym C. larsoni is Santo Domingo, Ecuador. Description The forewings measure for the males and for the female. The wings' underside for both sexes are the same: they are a pale brownish gray with a slight yellow iridescence and with a pattern of red, eye- like markings on the hindwing around the M3 and Cu1 cells (see the Comstock‚ÄìNeedham system of insect wing nomenclature). The upper surface of the male wings are a purple metallic color. The upper surface of the female forewing is dark brown with some blue tint near the basal area. The upper surface of the female hindwings are also dark brown with iridescent blue, with dark brown spots in the M3 and Cu1 cells.

Premise Halik begins with four people's lives are intertwined in a complicated web of love, lies, and deception. Lino (Jericho Rosales), Jacky (Yen Santos), Jade (Yam Concepcion), and Ace (Sam Milby) get entangled in unpredictable situations where they become hapless victims of circumstance. Will they still be able to redeem themselves and escape the pit they have dug themselves into. The Beginning Halik is a fictional story of two marriages, marred by temptation, discontentment, misunderstandings, and other relationship problems. This fictional teleserye follows the lives of two childhood friends, Jacky Montefalco (Yen Santos) and Lino Bartolome (Jericho Rosales), torn apart by a vengeful man and then thrust together by a cruel twist of fate, and betrayal. Jacky is the heiress of MonteCorp Furniture, a renowned furniture establishment in the Philippines and Asia. She is the only daughter of Mauro and Loida Montefalco (Precious Lara Quigaman), prominent members of society in the country and owners of MonteCorp. Jacky learns early on that she is not the natural offspring of the man she thought was her father. Nevertheless, she longs for her adoptive father's acceptance. Mauro Montefalco (Romnick Sarmenta) is a cruel man who kills his wife's lover in a jealous rage, and raises her daughter as his legal child. This is as far as his benevolence goes as he is extremely cruel and dismissive to his daughter. Though he keeps up with the filial appearances to save his face, he dislikes his daughter and directs his anger on her and the Bartolome family who he blames for his unhappiness. Agustin \\"Gustin\\" Bartolome (Allan Paule) is a talented furniture designer whose pieces are much sought after. It is through Agustin that Loida meets her lover, Robert Oliva. Loida is the suffering wife of the domineering Mauro. The couple fall in love. Loida attempts to leave Mauro to join Robert but he is killed. Jacky is the fruit of their relationship. MonteCorp MonteCorp, originally the Yba√±ez Furniture of Cebu, is a well known furniture company founded by the Yba√±ez family, Loida's parents. Close family friend and furniture designer, Gustin Bartolome designs their furniture products, and when Mauro takes over the reins of Yba√±ez Furniture after his in-laws retire, he keeps Gustin in his employ. Years later and rebranded as MonteCorp, the company expands into the Asian market, but their financial growth and success are marred by his discontented furniture workers who are underpaid and maltreated. Neither does he give credit to his designers for their creations. In a labor dispute with his workers, Gustin Bartolome is killed in a suspicious warehouse fire. Mauro steals Gustin's portfolio, a worn out sketch book containing numerous drawings of furniture that have not yet been executed, all signed by the designer and dedicated to his family. It is this sketch book that Gustin was searching for when the fire started in the factory's storage and lost his life. Gustin's death results to a parting of ways and bitterness between the Bartolomes and the Montefalcos, and the childhood best friends and teenage sweethearts part ways. Years pass. Agustin's son, Lino establishes a furniture design group called Dos Disenyos. His modern, fast forward designs catch the attention of the younger market and he becomes a serious contender to MonteCorp's market share. Lino is certain MonteCorp is using his father's personal sketches but is not able to prove it because of the missing portfolio. He suspects Mauro is responsible for his father's death. Before the tragic fire that took his father's life, Lino spent many years watching his father sketch as he explained each design details and the inspiration behind them. It is this intimate knowledge of his father's designs that Lino is able to recognize his father's personal sketches among MonteCorp's award-winning pieces. Lino and Jade Years later Lino falls deeply in love and marries Jade Flores (Yam Concepcion), and like other couples, have plans and dreams of their future together as a family. They suffer the loss of their first child from a late term miscarriage, an event that significantly impacts Jade. The loss triggers a Postpartum depression, as Jade begins to suffer mood swings and bizarre behavior, and experiences a restlessness she blames on their home life and the extended family living with them. Jade longs for the privacy of a house of their own, independent from her in-laws. Sharing her house with an extended family becomes a bone of contention between the couple and they argue incessantly over it. Meanwhile, as he struggles to understand Jade, Dos Disenyos is on the brink of success, distracts him from Jade's anxieties. Jacky and Ace Meanwhile, Jacky marries Ace Corpuz (Sam Milby), the eldest son of her father's business partner. Jacky is very much in love with him, despite her suspicions of his womanizing. In fact, Ace is a serial womanizer who is glib enough to get away with his philandering. Although Ace has no qualms about his liaisons, he becomes very jealous of Lino when they all run into each other during a furniture trade exposition in Bali, Indonesia. The childhood friends had not seen each other since they broke up a decade ago. Ace's unreasonable jealousy drives him to get back at Lino and he does this the only way he knows how - pursue and seduce Lino's wife. The Affair By a cruel twist of fate, Lino and Jacky's lives collide once more when their spouses, Jade and Ace, are entangled in a scandalous affair. At the same time, Jacky's mother dies from a self inflicted gunshot to her chest, which Jacky refuses to believe. In fact, Jacky's suspicions are not far off when it is revealed that Mauro did shoot Loida accidentally, in a fit of rage when Loida tells him she is leaving him. Mauro bribes the Coroner to fake the autopsy results. Days before her death, she returns Gustin's missing portfolio to Lino and his family. And after years of advising her daughter to defer to her father's wishes, she gives Jacky permission to free herself from her domineering father. Jacky is baffled by her mother's suicide but her death leaves Jacky with a larger stake in MonteCorp, a seat in the board and a significant say in the company. This allows Jacky the freedom to resign from her father without compromising her ownership in the firm. Meanwhile, Jacky and Lino experience the heaviest trial in their respective marriages: the devastating discovery of their spouses' affair. As Mauro and the Corpuzes escalate their revenge against Dos Disenyos with underhanded tactics and industrial espionage, Jacky uses her clout to thwart their plans. Devastated and heartbroken over Ace's betrayal, she throws Ace out of their home. Lino also fights back. He sues Mauro for stealing his father's designs, but the Corpuzes pay the fiscal to drop the case for lack of merit. Completely devastated over Jade's betrayal, Lino struggles to overcome his feelings for her and focuses on moving on. The Aftermath As more secrets and scandals are exposed, the two betrayed spouses, Lino and Jacky, join forces to reckon with their respective spouses and attempt to close the painful chapters of their past. Jacky leaves MonteCorp and joins Dos Disenyos and the duo draw in more projects and the company expands even more. Mauro suffers a debilitating stroke, and the real enemy emerges: Paeng Corpuz. Ace and his father team up to take over MonteCorp, which turns out to be Paeng's plan from the start. They get financing from a mysterious venture capitalist Aliyah Torres who wants to purchase MonteCorp. Unknown to the Corpuzes, Aliyah has another agenda, an axe to grind against Mauro and she intends to destroy MonteCorp with him and the entire Corpuz family. While Mauro is incapacitated, they institute board resolutions that overrules Mauro's directives despite his majority stock control. Mauro is about to lose MonteCorp to the Corpuzes. Jacky wrestles with the dilemma: to help her father who rejected her throughout her entire life and save the company founded by her grandparents? or does she turn her back on the people who give her so much grief? Jacky chooses to save the company founded by her grandparents and resigns from Dos Disenyos. This pleases Mauro, who has, since his stroke, a change of heart towards his daughter. Mauro realizes Jacky's value and thanks her for not giving up on him. Jacky is overwhelmed and they reconcile. Lino and Jacky also face new challenges: a rekindling of their friendship is complicated by Jade's pregnancy and the DNA test confirming Lino is the father. Both are cautious and guarded about their feelings. Unexpectedly, a new love interest comes into Jacky's world, giving rise to Lino's jealousy. But Jade's pregnancy is tenuous, and so he takes her in because he feels responsible for his child. Jade, realizing her mistakes, tries her best to make up for her betrayal, but Lino tells her it is too late. When she overhears Lino tell Jacky that he no longer loves Jade as he once did, the painful realization that she lost Lino for good triggers a premature labor and birth of their son. Memories of their first child shake them up. Parenthood prevails as they try to set aside a barrage of emotions resulting from the complications of their relationship. Meanwhile, Lino understands Jacky's decision to resign and gives his blessings but struggles to control his feelings for her, especially now that her relationship with Yohan Tanaka (Daniel Matsunaga) appears serious. After a month in an incubator, Lino's son (\\"CJ\\") finally comes home from the hospital and the Bartolomes welcome the newest member of the family with joyous anticipation of new beginnings. Unfortunately, happiness does not come easy. Jade suffers Postpartum depression and struggles with nursing her son. Determined to win back Lino, she can't accept that he no longer loves her. Emotions run high in a household hoping the worst has past. Ill feelings create conflict within their family and additional stress on her depressed state. His friendship with Jacky gives rise to unreasonable jealousies. Try as he might, the current set up is not working well for Lino, who despite his desire to do right for his son, is unable to get Jade to understand that they are no longer a couple. Desperate to win back Lino's affection, Jade takes measures in her own hand with disastrous results. Failing to seduce hin, she runs away with baby CJ, and the infant catches the measles and ends up in hospital. Ace is aware of the Bartolomes' movements, and brings Jade and the baby to the hospital. This is what Jacky and Nanay Dolor sees when they get to the hospital. Montefalcos vs Corpuzes Meanwhile, Dos Disenyos' first day without Jacky is uneventful. Bast√© is back as Project Manager and she easily picks up from where Jacky left off. She also shares information she obtained from her investigations. Over at MonteCorp, Jacky and Mauro's first day back is contentious. They are advised that the Board's legal counsel is preparing to execute documents for a corporate takeover. The Montefalcos are dismayed that the additional infusion of funds from Aliyah dilutes Mauro's and Jacky's majority shares in the company. A larger share bloc composed of Aliyah and the Corpuzes now make up the majority. A Board resolution made possible because Paeng Corpuz had obtained Mauro's signed approval to sell a bloc of shares to Aliyah, while sedated in the hospital after his stroke. A catfight ensues between Jacky and Aliyah when MonteCorp's production lead advises Jacky that the company's signature designs are being phased out by Aliyah, despite the fact that these are the company's best selling products. Jacky has Aliyah investigated and learns her real name is Aliyah Vegafria, the only daughter of Manuel Vegafria, an up-and-coming furniture business in Davao in the early 80s who committed suicide. Elsewhere, Aliyah visits a Columbarium where her father's ashes are inurned. She recalls the painful day her father kills himself in front of her school. In their last conversation, he warns her not to trust Mauro Montefalco. Suffering the trauma of her father's suicide, Aliyah swears her revenge on the Montefalcos. Something about the name Manuel Vegafria is also vaguely familiar to Mauro. He pays a visit to a former employee inquiring about Manuel, who reminds him about the day the man burst into their boardroom demanding Mauro to return his family's money. It turns out that Manuel loses all his family's money from his investments in MonteCorp. Alarmed, he warns Jacky about Aliyah and promises he will update her as he gets credible information. Although Mauro barely recalls the incident, he pays Paeng Corpuz a visit to find out more information, well aware of the fact that in those early days, Paeng Corpuz handled all the trouble shooting and fixed issues. Child Custody Jade gives birth prematurely to her baby boy CJ, and uses this to her advantage to get close to Lino who allows her to stay in their home. Her hopes to win back Lino's heart is dashed when Jacky reveals that she is still in love with Lino. Desperate, she runs away with CJ while Lino is away in New York on a business trip. The newborn hasn't had his vaccines yet and as a result, is exposed to measles. Ace, who is stalking the Bartolomes, is notified and takes the opportunity to prey on Jade's fears and tries to win her trust. He feigns a mercy mission to bring Jade and her baby to the hospital. Lino cuts his business trip short when he senses things aren't right back home. Furious when he learns that Jade put their son at risk, he realizes she will never change, her selfishness is a deterrent to any possibility to become a family, to regain back his trust and love he once felt for her. While he tries to figure out their living arrangements, Jade agrees to stay with the Bartolomes and promises to not cause trouble. But despite living in a separate unit downstairs, her in laws can barely tolerate her presence. Maggie taunts Jade about Ace which leads to a physical brawl, with Auntie Fe joining in the fray. Furious, Lino finally throws Jade out of their home and files for sole custody of CJ. Desperate, Jade seeks help from Ace who is eager to create more turmoil in Lino's life. He fakes another DNA test to disprove Lino's previous DNA results and claim his paternity. Accompanied by the local Kagawad and holding falsified DNA results at the Bartolome residence, Jade and Ace demand to take back the child. A violent altercation occurs between Ace and Lino while Jade escapes with CJ. Nanay Dolor collapses from a stroke. Desperation Jacky's return to MonteCorp restores their clients' confidence. Her successful exhibit showcasing MonteCorp's signature classic pieces and her new designs boosts sales for the first time since she resigned and the Corpuzes took over. Meanwhile, Aliyah is frustrated that the Montefalcos have returned, and worse, Jacky is saving the company and regaining the Board's trust. Furious with Ace's distraction over his pursuits towards making Lino's life miserable, she decides to take matters in her hands and attempts to kill Jacky, but is unsuccessful. As Aliyah's plans for revenge unravels, she lashes out at Ace and admits to planning for MonteCorp's downfall, including the Montefalcos and the Corpuzes. She threatens to pull out her funds from the firm. Fearing his family's financial ruin and the failure for his own plans to destroy Lino, Ace decides to stop Aliyah from pulling the plug on the firm. He drugs Aliyah's drink with a fatal dosage of her antidepressants and sleeping pills. In a last desperate attempt to seek help, Aliyah calls Jackie to warn her. But because of the bad blood between them, and her drugged state, Jacky can't quite make sense of Aliyah's phone call. When she sends Ken and Chari to Aliyah's house the next day, they watch Aliyah's corpse being taken to the morgue, her death ruled as suicide. Elsewhere, Bast√© discovers suspicious files recovered from a flash drive she mysteriously receives during the course of her own investigation of Mauro and Paeng months back after she left Dos Disenyos. The files contain land titles of various properties, and fund transfers from the company accounts to the Corpuz' alias bank accounts. She shows the files to Jacky who has Mauro look at them. Mauro confirms the illegal transactions and tells Jackey he will get additional documents to help her. Meanwhile, Lino is desperate to get his child away from Jade who has moved in with Ace. With Gio's and Tet's help, Lino is able to keep track of his son's whereabouts and welfare. Lino's legal team presses him to file Adultery charges against Jade and Ace, arguing that this is the strongest means to get full custody. The lawyers explain that the law always defers to the mother, but Adultery is a crime punishable by jail. With Jade in jail, Lino has rights for full custody. While Lino's lawyers prepare to file for sole custody and substantiate the adultery charges, they advise Lino to stay away from Ace and Jade, to avoid altercations between them are not used against Lino's claims to provide a safe and healthy environment for his son. His legal team builds a strong case against Jade and Ace on the grounds of adultery, with credible testimonies from Jade's friend Tet, Bast√© and Dolor Bartolome. Although Lino is tempted to take his son away, he places his trust in the legal system's due process. When the Fiscal's office find merit in Lino's charges against Jade and Ace, someone tips off Ace that a warrant of arrest is issued against them. Helen provides them two separate units in their building where they hide temporarily so they are not in Ace's unit during the police's first attempt to arrest them. With only a matter of time before the trio are caught, Helen Corpuz devises a plan to save Ace and keep Jade away for good. Knowing full well that Jade would never let CJ out of her sight, Helen bribes Jade's sister to trick Jade with entrusting CJ to her. When Ace and Jade are finally arrested, Helen promises to have them both released on bail, after which Jade and CJ would leave the country for good to escape the Adultery trial. The warrant is successfully served on Jade and she is arrested but to Lino's dismay, CJ is missing. His frantic search for his son leads him to Jade's sister, Ruby. Meanwhile, Helen has Jade's bail raised, delaying Jade's plans to retrieve CJ and run away with Ace. Ruby panics, contacts Ace who brings them to another motel to hideout as they wait for Jade's release. Gio, who is trailing Ace, tips off Lino on Ruby and CJ's new location and rescues CJ. Their joy is short-lived as Jade is released and with the law still on her side, retrieves CJ. Lino has no choice except to wait for Jade and Ace's trial for adultery. In a new turn of events, a mysterious woman calls Jacky offering information regarding Ace, Paeng and Mauro. The caller reveals to be Aliyah, who survived the drug overdose and faked her suicide after being saved by her doctor friend. She executes her revenge on Mauro and succeeds in destroying his newly reconciled relationship with Jacky. Finale The court trial ends with a guilty verdict for both Jade and Ace for the crime of adultery. The emotional testimonies of Lino, Jacky and Dolor sealed the judge's decision. The Corpuzes appeal while Ace arranges to leave the country with Jade through the back door. They plan to kidnap CJ who is safely reunited with the Bartolomes. Meanwhile, Paeng and Helen are on the run as Mauro implicates them. In a last desperate act against the Montefalcos, Paeng plants a chemical gas attack inside the warehouse almost killing its employees, including Ken and Jacky. Luckily, Lino arrives in time to save them. Jacky recognizes Paeng in the CCTV footage. After CJ's christening, Jade abducts CJ and escapes with Ace. Aliyah is waiting for them when they arrive at the private hangar, ready to kill them both. Ace outwits Aliyah and strangles her to death. As Jade witnesses the murder, she realizes her biggest mistake of depending on Ace to provide for her. She tries to escape with CJ but is confronted by Ace. He forces her to join him as he drives off to meet up with his mother, Helen. Tracking Jade's phone, Lino and Jacky arrive at the Hangar and sees investigating authorities surrounding Aliyah's lifeless corpse. Ace and Jade are gone. Shortly after, Jacky comes across Helen carrying CJ. Jacky tries to convince Helen to hand her the baby but Helen pushes them both into the river and escapes. Lino arrives in time to save Jacky and his son. Meanwhile, Jade angrily stops Ace from driving, manages to get the handgun from him and shoots him on his shoulder to stop the car. Remembering Ace's despicable deeds, and her ruined life, she shoots at his manhood. Jade coughs up blood and collapses. At the hospital, Lino informs Jade that she has Tuberculosis which she picked up from the inmates in prison. Jade realizes all her decisions and apologizes to Jacky. Lino promises her that he would raise CJ with no enmity towards his mother. The Corpuzes are arrested and convicted and serve life sentences for their crimes. Ace is raped and humiliated by his inmates. Similar harsh lives are experienced by Paeng and Helen. Jacky visits Mauro in prison to say goodbye before she leaves for San Francisco where she lives for a good part of a decade to heal. She decides to return home after she reads a magazine article on her father who decides to make his life in prison worthwhile by teaching his inmates furniture making skills and gives them personal development courses. He is dubbed a renaissance man. Gio writes Paeng, Helen and Ace letters extending his forgiveness and assured them that he will not stop loving them. Of the three, Ace takes accountability, joins a bible group and resumes a relationship with his brother. Lino becomes even more successful with Dos Disenyos and faithfully visits Jade in prison with CJ. He remains true to his word that CJ will know his mother and love her in return. Jade serves out her term and is released to reunite with an older CJ. On her first night as a free individual, she asks CJ to sleep over and Lino agrees. Lino's annulment case against her is passed and their marriage is already annulled. Lino then visits Jacky who returns to the Philippines.

Romilius was fined 10,000 asses, and Veturius 15,000.Livy, iii. 31.Dionysius, x. 49.. The lex Aternia Tarpeia was introduced in order to regulate such fines. Provisions The law drew upon Athenian precedent, as Solon's laws allowed fines levied in livestock to be transmuted into coinage. After the prosecution of Romilius and Veterius, Roman emissaries were sent to study Greek law; according to tradition, they went to Athens, but they may instead have drawn on the laws of Magna Graecia, a region of Greek colonies in southern Italy. The best known result of this commission was the establishment of the Decemvirs, who held power from 451 to 449, and established the Twelve Tables of Roman law.Livy, iii. 32.Dionysius, x. 54 ff. The lex Aternia Tarpeia seems to have been an earlier result of the commission's findings. It is not mentioned by Livy or Dionysius, but was described by Cicero, Aulus Gellius, and is alluded to by Pliny. Before the new law, fines had generally been levied in livestock; for minor offences, fines ranged from two sheep up to thirty oxen.Cicero, De Republica, ii. 35.Pliny the Elder, Historia Naturalis, xviii. 3. ¬ß 3. Dionysius mentions a maximum fine of two oxen and thirty sheep, although Gellius gives the reverse.Dionysius, x. 50.Gellius, Attic Nights, xi. 1. The value of fines was naturally dependent on the quality of the livestock, which could be highly inconsistent. The lex Aternia Tarpeia is said to have addressed this defect by establishing an equivalence scale: ten asses for a sheep, and one hundred for an ox. Some scholars suggest that the law did no more than regulate the maximum fine, or suprema multa, and that the change from fines of property to fines in bronze was the result of the lex Julia Papiria, a law passed in 430 BC.

Characters Main characters : :The protagonist of the series, born August 10, SC0363 (Star Century 0363). Relative to the series' predecessor Kiddy Grade, she retains elements of √âclair's personality: her recklessness and simple nature, in addition to being spastic and childish. While she and Q-feuille are ES member candidates, they are currently waitresses for the Touch & Go! cafe within the GTO headquarters. She is also known to have a strong love for pumpkin pudding, to the point she would break into the GTO to get some. Her special ability, \\"Push-Pull,\\" is teleportation. She has inherited Trixie's ability to bend space. While powered-up by Di-air's kiss she is able to teleport further, faster and while carrying multiple bodies, however later on has shown she has gotten stronger with her ability to where she doesn't need to kiss Di-air to teleport other people. Her name is French for \\"have heart\\", shown where her pigtails are formed into the shape of small hearts. It is later revealed that her real name is Lieselotte and that Geacht'er is her biological brother, as they share the same rose birthmark, the thought of which has cause her to be very depressed. In episode 21, she freed Q-feuille from her brainwashed state through resonance amidst a kiss. (The resonance was strong enough to overpower \\"Geact'er's\\" ability.) In that same episode, Ascoeur's past was revealed. She, as Lieselotte, was a member of the Nouvlesse and was imprisoned with her brother in an experimental facility when the universe was to become a democracy; members of the Rosenburg family who committed genocide rather than be ruled under the commoners. When their powers first manifested right before she was about to be crushed, she ended up in a cryogenic chamber and was separated from her brother, however lost all of her memories up till that point. : :Her official date of birth is September 21, SC0372. She has qualities reminiscent of Lumi√®re: her intelligence and serious nature, in addition to a heightened sensitivity to embarrassment. She also is an anime otaku, particularly of a Cardcaptor Sakura parody show, Card Getter Sakura. Like Ascoeur, she is an ES member candidate, but currently works as a waitress for the Touch & Go! cafe. Her special ability, \\"Parfum,\\" is foresight, but is seldom used as it seems to be weak, leading her to rely on small Chocolate Bombs, small but powerful bombs that look like chocolate treats. However, with Di-air's kiss she is able to predict actions with precision.Episode 5 She has inherited Troisienne's ability to stop time. Though she should be sixteen- years-old, she reveals to Di-air that she is seven-years-old, like Di- air.Episode 4 Her name is from the French \\"Quatre Feuille\\" or \\"Four leaf\\", as in clover. It is later revealed that she was created only seven years ago by Eclipse, the former director of the GOTT, who died in the process. Later after overusing her Time Ability, she lost all of her memories and currently with the G Society. Shade later brainwashes her into believing she is Geacht'er's little sister. In episode 18, it is shown that Q-feuille's full name is Quatre Feuille IV Lumi√®re; Eclipse, the former GTO director had planned to clone √âclair and Lumi√®re she made three successful generations, but after creating Q-feuille with her quantum abilities Eclipse reached her limit and died leaving Q-feuille without a partner and no fourth generation of √âclair clones.http://anime.thenexxus.org/blog/archives/gimik/kiddy_grade/ :While brainwashed, she takes up a more spoiled child like personality, and always likes to be pampered by her \\"onii-chan\\". She also refers to herself in the third person. : :She is a seven-year-old girl recruited as an ES member candidate, apprenticing under Ascoeur and Q-feuille. Her past is shrouded in a mystery even she does not know, but is implied it was a life of perpetual darkness. Although her hair seems adorned by red hair clips similar to that of Chi from Chobits which she can twitch them at will like ears. Her special ability allows her to increase the magnitude of other people's abilities, through a lips-to-lips kiss. She later displays the ability to both use Time and Space manipulation, how has yet been explained, though with her age it is believed she could be the reincarnation or clone of former GOTT director Eclipse. : : A pocket-sized, lime-green creature whom befriends Di-air and terrorizes Ascoeur and Q-feuille when the trio are assigned to investigate the ruins of the GOTT headquarters. With Di-air's kiss, he was able to gather remnants of nanotechnology to shape-shift into a Genetech Beast. The trio bring him back to the GTO headquarters where Di-air wears him as a pochette. Though they omit his presence from the debriefing, Hiver knows and does not disapprove. He seems to have taken up the position of being Di-air's bodyguard, purposely kissing her to change into a GENETECH turtle to protect her from an attack. Supporting characters =GTO Higher Ups= : :The current Bureau Chief of the GTO (her name is French for \\"winter\\"). Hiver is the reincarnation of Pfeilspitze (Mercredi). She has shown the ability to travel through a dimensional door, which explains how she always seems to appear out of nowhere. : :Chief Hiver's secretary. He appears to be very close to Hiver where he is rarely (if ever) away from her side. His name is German for \\"summer\\". Sommer is the reincarnation of Armbrust. =ES Members= : : Trixie was a skilled, energetic ES member, whom both Ascoeur and Q-feuille greatly admired. It was revealed that she could teleport like Ascoeur, however she was able to carry people and objects, something Ascoeur cannot currently achieve unless \\"powered up\\" by Di-air. Trixie was also able to deflect attacks by bending space around her. She is partners with Troisienne. Her unexpected death had a great impact upon Ascoeur and Q-feuille, as well as representing a change in tone for the series. On Trixie's tombstone is written Trixie III √âclair, when it is later revealed in episode 18 that Eclipse, the former GTO director, had attempted to clone √âclair and Lumi√®re using her quantum abilities and that Trixie was the third generation of √âclair with her predecessors being Uniear and Duerry. : :Troisienne was the quieter, more composed of the two but equally admired by both Ascoeur and Q-feuille, although arguably closer to the latter due to her otaku tendencies (which after revealing they are clones of each other suggests that it is hereditary). Her ability allowed her to literally stop time, but she was only able to do this a few times before becoming fatigued as it produced a great strain on her body. Like Trixie, her sudden and violent death had a great impact upon Ascoeur and Q-feuille, as well as representing a change in tone for the series. On Troisienne's tombstone is written Troisienne III Lumi√®re, like Trixie, Troisienne was clone of Lumi√®re created by Eclipse and is the third generation of Lumi√®re with her predecessors being Uni-ace and Dionie. : :She is seen in the prologue of the first episode, saving a planet from destruction. It is revealed she did so by freezing it and the surrounding space in time. It is later revealed in episode 18 that Eclipse had attempted to clone √âclair with her quantum abilities, she made three generations of clones (including Trixie) but died before making a fourth. She finally makes an appearance in episode 22, when the Space Time was removed by Geacht'er. After the universe was saved, they returned to the GTO as what appears to be receptionists. Despite Ascoeur not being her clone, they are similar in many ways from ability to personal quirks. : :Lumi√®re is the partner of √âclair. She is also seen in the prologue saving a planet from destruction. It is revealed she did so by freezing it and the surrounding space in time. It is later revealed that Eclipse had attempted to clone Lumi√®re and made three generations of clones, the third being Troisienne and the fourth later revealed to be Q-feuille. She finally makes an appearance in episode 22, when the Space Time was removed by Geacht'er. After the universe was saved, they returned to the GTO as what appears to be receptionists. : :Tweedledee is an ES member from the previous series, though appears to not have aged. It is revealed that in training, Ascoeur was assigned to her and her partner, Tweedledum. She is very competitive and has a strong sense of pride, as is shown when Ascoeur and Q-feuille infiltrated a booby-trapped GTO headquarters at night, and Tweedledee took it as a chance to test out the new intruder system. Tweedledee has the ability to control electricity and can create an effect similar to Lumi√®re's \\"Puppet\\". She is able to communicate and even exchange bodies with her brother over great distances using an advanced form of twin telepathy. : :Tweedledum is an ES member from the previous series, and twin brother of Tweedledee. He is the calmer of the two, though has a sister complex and a malicious streak. He seems to dislike Ascoeur, most likely due to jealousy over his sister's attention from when Ascoeur was assigned to them for training. Tweedledum has the ability to control the magnetic fields around him, combining with Tweedledee to create a powerful gravitational force. : :Un-ou is an ES member from the previous series. He and A-ou are first seen in the prologue of the first episode, however only mentioned briefly before appearing in episode 7. Un-ou is the energetic, malicious of the two, balancing out his partner's quiet personality. It is revealed that in training, Q-feuille was assigned to Un-ou and A-ou. Un-ou's \\"Amazing\\" ability allows him to listen to the various life energies which allow them to track down their enemies. Though he is a guy, he has a penchant for dressing in women's clothing. He is also called tsundere by others. : :A-ou is an ES member from the previous series, and partner of Un-ou. The older and more stoic member of the duo, A-ou (unlike his partner) has a stronger sense of honor and justice. He is also more of a pacifist and he often speaks in a profound and meaningful manner, giving him a rather preachy presence among other people. His ability, \\"Amplifier\\" gives him the ability to improve his visual perception tenfold, as well as to see the light of people's lives and how that dims when they die. He also uses the energy seen by Un-ou to increase the power of his physical attacks. =Others= : :Mi Nourose is the very masculine looking chief of \\"Touch & Go!\\", the caf√© Ascoeur, Q-feuille and Di- air work in, as well as the head of the dormitory. Mi Nourose has a penchant for cosplay, and is always seen in a different outfit. At the end of episode 24, Mi Nourose is revealed to be someone of importance as he's seen on top of a ship and has knowledge of the space-frozen time. : :One of the GTO receptionists, and frequent customer of \\"Touch & Go!\\" Alisa has quite a lively spirit and is a keen follower of dramas and yaoi. : :One of the GTO receptionists, and frequent customer of \\"Touch & Go!\\" Belle often speaks common sense when things get out of hand. :: :Chevalier D'Autriche is the adopted son of √âclair, Chevalier was reborn at the end of the Kiddy Grade series as a baby, He appears in episode 12 but his name was shortened to . He revisits the planet every year where his mother is trapped in Frozen Space Time, leaving a wreath for her. At the end of the series he finally was reunited with √âclair. Antagonists =G Society= G Society is a terrorist organization that claims themselves to be a nation. However, they are composed of descendants of the corrupt Nouvelesse (people who are desendences from Mother Earth) whom GTO (then GOTT) removed from power thanks to √âclair and Lumi√®re. These people want revenge and are led by the mysterious Geacht'er, the self-proclaimed only pure-blood Nouvelesse. They also show no care for their own members, regarding the dead body of a man who voice disbelief towards Geacht'er as trash. Despite this they have considerable power over the universe's government, which lead to the temporary suspension of the GTO. Their Shadow Workers are ability-users who enforce their standards, mostly commoners with the exception of Letuchaia and Pauki, though none of the teams trust the other. :: :Geacht'er is the leader and founder of G Society whose goal is to dismantle the GTO. He projects a message to Aineias claiming that the GTO are corrupt and that his G Society will bring peace to the galaxy. His ability is to plant deadly roses onto targets. These roses are white before turning red while the victim is dying. After the death, the rose then turns black. He has also inherited the ability to manipulate time. Many of the G Society believe he is not who he claims to be, but are too scared to voice their thoughts aloud. It is later revealed he was the one who caused the incident 25 years ago, trying to destroy the universe and since then has created the G Society. It is later revealed he has done all of this in an attempt to destroy the universe again, though it is unknown if he used the Nouvelesse's hope to regain their title for his own gain. In episode 15, Geacht'er reveals to Ascoeur that she is his sister Liselotte and that his real name is Alfred, given that they share the same rose birthmark. Since then he seems to have become obsessed to have his little sister with him (which appears to border on an incestuous desire), something that has caused noticeable jealousy with his more devoted Shadow Workers like Saphir, Shade and Letuchaia. Despite his polite and kind personality, he is able to kill anyone in his way without a second thought. Also an interesting note, his most loyal Shadow Workers were the ones who were conscious when he saved them, as well as coming to their aid just when they needed him the most. He claims he has always been alone since his sister disappeared, and has shown to not hesitate to try to kill anyone who is no longer of use to him, this including his own followers or even rigging the G Society ship to explode, killing all 50,000 people on board (including Pauki and Letuchaia's grandmother) if Ascoeur didn't follow his plan. ;Team 1 :Composed of Saphir and Rubis who worked with the Royal Guard as assassins during when the Nobility ruled. However, after the GOTT made the universe a democracy they were imprisoned for 50 years before being sentenced to death. It was then where Geacht'er saved them. However, the universe became a democracy only 25 years ago, the time difference has yet to be explained. ;; :: ::Saphir is a Shadow Worker of G-society, first appearing in episode 4 along with her partner, Rubis. Her ability allows her to create ice at will for attack and defense. Though she is the calmer of the two of her team, she can become very angry if someone insults Geacht'er. Despite her well manners she is a complete slob at home. She is also dating an unnamed man. She is given the nick-name \\"Ice-maiden.\\" Saphir becomes one of the chief antagonists later on, as her loyalty to Geacht'er is so strong that she would even attack her partner Rubis to serve him when she now believes her to be a traitor. Her personality is later no longer the calm cold it once was, as now the plan is near completion she has shown another side, a sadistic love of war and death, seeming to be the only one from the very start of the three teams to know that the removal of Time Space will destroy the universe, and finds joy that all the \\"stupid people\\" will die and the chosen few will survive. This personality has even scared her former partner. She appears to have died when she fell into the energy filled planet. ;; :: ::Rubis is a Shadow worker of G-society, first appearing in episode 4 with her partner Saphir, despite the fact she doesn't like cold temperatures. Her ability allows her to transform into a powerful feral form with extending claws. She also is immune to poison. She is given the nickname \\"Beast woman\\". After seeing the lengths Geacht'er would go without any remorse, she appears to have change sides and repeatedly helps Q-feuille's and Di-Air out. She is last seen in a hospital with a cast. ;Team 2 :Consisting of Torch and Shade, both who possess powers revolving around illusions. They used to be GTO ES Members before betraying them to join the G Society, however this was revealed to because of their corrupt director, who ordered to have them killed to cover up his corruption. They also have a habit of using their powers to become invisible and spy on girls. They are currently acting as Q-feuille's bodyguards while she is brainwashed into believing she is Geacht'er's little sister. ;; :: ::Torch is a Shadow Worker of G-society, first appearing in episode 7 when he attacks Q-feuille, Trixie and Di-air. He uses \\"Illusions\\", attacking the three from a distance but making it appear as though he was right in front of them. Torch is very loyal to his partner Shade and has complete trust in him. It was later revealed that Torch and Shade were former ES members themselves before defecting to G Society. He is well known to be a womanizer, stating he likes to have a woman's company in bed. In episode 19 it is revealed that both Torch and Shade were in the police force and when they wanted to kill off Shade, Torch stayed with him and did not abandon him. In episode 19, even after Geacht'er brainwashed Torch asked him to kill Shade, Shade would rather kill himself as he does not like the idea of having partners fight each other. He is later attacked by Geacht'er when he disobeyed his order by the use of one of his roses, but is later revealed to have survived. ;; :: ::Shade is the partner of Torch, his abilities being similar, the only difference is that his illusions are implanted in the minds of his targets, giving the victim's eyes a purple and green color when under the effects. He is also able to read minds as well as brainwash people. He attacks Ascoeur and Troisienne, and seems to sees something special in Ascoeur. He apparently has somewhat of a rivalry with Saphir as shown in episode 11, most likely with their devotion towards Geacht'er, where they scowl at each other passing in the hall and Saphir causes to freeze part of the hall. In episode 19 it is revealed that both Torch and Shade were in the police force; when Shade learned something that could endanger both of them, he refused to tell Torch to prevent him from getting involved. When Torch asked Shade would comply to Lord Geacht'er's request to kill Torch, Shade does not answer him; the Geacht'er does give the order, Shade refused. He later goes after Torch when he is falling out of the space station, though used his powers on Geacht'er before doing so. He is later seen with Torch living a normal life. Shade also shares the same voice actor as Sinistra from the Kiddy Grade. ;Team 3 :Consisting of Letuchaia and Pauki, two young children. They are the only Nouvelesse Shadow Workers. They are cousins working as Shadow Workers as their service allows their grandmother to get high quality medical treatment. ;; :: ::Letuchaia, whose name comes from the Russian for bat (, ) (where her shoes even have bat wings on them as well as a crest on her chest), is known as the \\"princess\\" of G Society and has a habit of using multiplication to express her feelings (I am 8 times more annoyed and so on). She acts all posh and snobbish and shows respect to only Geacht'er. She has a grudge against the GTO and its actions because her Nouvelesse grandparents were thrown out onto the streets. However, she has becomes extremely jealous over the fact that Q-feuille has taken her \\"little sister\\" position to Geacht'er, leading her to try to get rid of her. Her ability, Crazy Cracker, is to eject energy bolas from her fingers. She is Pauki's cousin. However, her loyalty to Geacht'er has seemed to have vanished after discovering the removal of Time Space was not going to be used for peace, and in fact used to destroy the universe, along with making sure Ascoeur followed his orders by threatening the lives of everyone on G Society, including her grandmother. ;; :: ::Pauki, whose name is Russian for spiders () (wearing a crest of a spider on his chest), is known as Letuchaia's \\"knight\\" and has the same ability as Letuchaia. He is very loyal to Letuchaia to an obsessive degree, highly suggesting he is in love with her. He also has a habit of answering Letuchaia's rhetorical questions, which causes her to scold him. He is Letuchaia's cousin. He later sides with the GTO along with his cousin, and seems to have gained a crush on Tweedledee. Others ; :Shape-shifting nanomachines originally developed by the labs at the GOTT, now used as weapons by terrorists. Traces of the technology litter the abandoned GOTT headquarters. ; : :A secretive maid who first appears in episode 8, she is given special glasses from Letuchaia to spy on the other G Society ES Members and give the information to Geacht'er.

History Canci√≥n mel√≥dica appeared in the first half of the 20th century. Unlike the cupl√©, its 19th century predecessor that was primarily strophic, canci√≥n mel√≥dica was defined through the emphasis it placed on the chorus. The orchestras with vocalists had a fundamental protagonism in the dance parties, which evolved from the popular verbena to \\"more refined circles\\" such as salons and caf√©s. The melodic compositions were accompanied by popular vocalists that appeared in magazines, films and live performances; \\"Musicologists describe [canci√≥n mel√≥dica] as the explanation for the birth of the singer stars in the 1920s.\\" The use of the microphone gave them a greater role‚Äîand through radio broadcasting, an ensemble of composers, lyricists and orchestra directors worked in behalf of the vocalist. The popularization of radio during the 1940s made canci√≥n mel√≥dica a massive phenomenon. Key figures include Jorge Sep√∫lveda, Antonio Mach√≠n, Mario Visconti, Garc√≠a Guirao, Lorenzo Gonz√°lez and Bonet de San Pedro, among others.

Brown discovered 21 new species of fossil reptiles and dinosaurs, a large number of which were described by Robert Broom and Harry Seeley. The defunct genus Browniella and some ten fossil species were named in his honour. Brown's fossils included 7 new species of Triassic fishes, some found by other collectors, three of which were named after him. Brown published a solitary article on his finds - \\"The Dicynodon\\", appearing in the Cape Monthly Magazine (2nd series, 1874, Vol. 9, pp. 83-89). Despite having had no formal training in palaeontology, archaeology or natural history, Brown possessed an enquiring and orderly mind. Though largely home- and self-educated, he was well-read in the sciences with a good command of Latin and Greek. He arrived at Port Elizabeth in 1858, having survived a bout of confluent smallpox on the voyage, and set off to teach in Bloemfontein, but found the post already filled, so that he moved to Aliwal North, remaining there for the rest of his life. In February 1859 he started teaching, often waiving a fee from poverty-stricken parents. In 1860 he took up a post as the town's first librarian, a duty he discharged for 41 years. He filled the role of postmaster and postman from about 1863 to 1882, and in 1865 was appointed as clerk to the resident magistrate; the income from these minor offices amounted to a pittance and Brown remained poor all his life. Brown's consuming interest in fossils was sparked by the surveyor and anthropologist, Joseph Millerd Orpen. The Burgersdorp Formation and the Stormberg Series proved to be a rich source of material, and an undemanding work schedule left Brown with ample time to pursue his interest in natural history. He soon possessed thousands of fossils specimens and archaeological artefacts, and boasted a library of some 2000 books on a wide variety of topics. Some 350 specimens were sent to the comparative anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley, including parts of what seemed like a megalosaurus and eventually named Euskelosaurus browni in Brown's honour. Specimens also went to the geologist Roderick Murchison, but neither Huxley nor Murchison sent Brown copies of the journals in which his finds were described. Still undeterred, Brown sent specimens to the National Museum of Natural History in Paris and in return received some geology and palaeontology books and a collection of 47 fossil shells which he donated to the Albany Museum in 1873. Fossils to the Imperial Natural History Museum in Vienna were ignored. In 1889 the British palaeontologist Harry Seeley visited South Africa, called on Brown and borrowed a substantial number of fossils which were never returned - consequently, some fifteen years later, Brown gifted them to the British Museum of Natural History. He also collected fossil plants from near Aliwal North, some 500 specimens laying the groundwork of the Burgersdorp Formation palaeoflora. His collection was studied by the naturalist Edgar Leopold Layard who named one of the species Odontopteris browni. After his intestate death his fossil collection was put up for auction and acquired by the South African Museum. Broom regarded it as most valuable since it included several type specimens and an outstanding set of South African fossil fish. Brown also made detailed notes on the stratigraphy of the Stormberg Series, though these were never published. He had an enduring interest in the life history and habits of the Cape monitor, Varanus albigularis, keeping some 40 of the animals. He felt that studying the extant reptile would provide a valuable insight into the interpretation of reptile fossils. His observations and thoughts were published in the Anglo-African in May 1869 and in the Cape Monthly Magazine (2nd series, Vol. 3, pp. 24-34) in July 1871. His interest in archaeology may be traced back to 1870 when he contributed to an article on Stone implements in South Africa by Langham Dale, in the Cape Monthly Magazine (2nd series, Vol. 1, pp. 366-367) in which he described rock shelters from near Zastron and other sites. He gathered a large number of stone artefacts and excavated several caves, but refused to give Louis P√©ringuey access to the collection. These artefacts were not marked and careless transporting after his death by the South African Museum resulted in a jumbled pile of little value to science. Brown was short, had an unkempt appearance, was a teetotaller and non-smoker, and had firm religious convictions. His unusual interest in natural history led to his being dubbed \\"Gogga\\" Brown by the local people. He had a retiring nature, shunned intimacy and adopted the lifestyle of a hermit, but at the same time valued his friendship with Daniel Rossouw Kannemeyer, a fellow palaeontologist and collector from nearby Burgersdorp. He maintained a meticulous journal which ran to some 17 volumes, comprising a rich source of information on his life.

Description Tliltocatl kahlenbergi is a relatively small member of the genus. Three males had total body lengths of between 32 mm and 34 mm; the female is larger, one having a body length of 41 mm. The fourth leg is longest, up to 58 mm in males and about 49 mm in females. The body is generally dark with relatively dense covering of red hair on the abdomen and legs compared to the more sparse red hairs in T. schroederi, which this species resembles. The carapace is variable in colour, and can appear quite bright. Like T. schroederi, fewer larger eggs are produced than in most related species, and the spiderlings are correspondingly larger. Taxonomy Tliltocatl kahlenbergi was first described in 2008 by Jan-Peter Rudloff as Brachypelma kahlenbergi. The specimens used in his description came from Herwig Kahlenberg, who was the first to recognize them as a new species. Spiders from Veracruz in Mexico had been sent to Kahlenberg in Germany, where he had distributed offspring. T. kahlenbergi is distinguished from all other species in the genus by the arrangement of the sigilla on the sternum, and by possessing two spines, rather than one, on the prolateral tibial apophysis. In November 2019, it was proposed that Brachypelma kahlenbergi be moved to the new genus Tliltocatl; this has been accepted by the World Spider Catalog. Distribution and habitat Tliltocatl kahlenbergi was described from specimens in captivity, reported to be collected from around Veracruz, Mexico. It lives in burrows in the ground, like other related species. Conservation All species of Brachypelma, then including Tliltocatl, were placed on CITES Appendix II in 1994, thus restricting trade, although T. kahlenbergi had not been described then and is not explicitly listed.

He died in combat at Adwa, and was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor.  Early life  Dabormida was the son of Count Giuseppe Dabormida, an artillery colonel, Minister of War of the Kingdom of Sardinia during the First Italian War of Independence and Foreign Minister in the first Cavour government. He was admitted in the Royal Military Academy in 1859, and graduated in December 1861 as an artillery sub-lieutenant. In March 1862 was attached to the Artillery Staff, then, a year later, assigned to the 5th Artillery Regiment. On 31 December 1863 was promoted to lieutenant. During the 1866 Italo-Austrian War he commanded a supply column, and by December was moved to the Army Staff. A year later he entered the newly founded School of War for a two-year specialization course. Promoted captain in 1868, in 1870 he started teaching courses of Military History in the same institution.  Army Staff and Academic career  Dabormida served as a professor in the School of War for eight years, until promoted Infantry major in 1878. Quite a prolific writer, he published Sunti sullo svolgimento storico dell'arte della guerra prima della rivoluzione francese (trans. \\"Essays on the history of the art of war before the French revolution\\") in 1874, and in 1876 Vincenzo Gioberti e il Dabormida, a defence of his father's actions against the accusations made by Vincenzo Gioberti in 1857. In 1878 he wrote La difesa delle nostre frontiere occidentali in relazione agli ordinamenti militari odierni (trans. \\"The defence of our western borders with respect to current military organization\\"): the increasing attrition with France after the collapse of the Second French Empire led him to analyze the possibility of a conflict between France and Italy. Dabormida urged the usage of Alps as a strong defensive line capable of restoring balance of force in a fight with the more numerous French, against the common opinion based on Napoleonic experience that deemed the mountains as a mere delaying obstacle. The same year he published, on the same matter, a study: Ordinamento militare delle popolazioni alpine (trans. \\"Military organization of Alpine people\\") and, in August 1879, he was back to the School of War as full professor. While maintaining his teaching activity, in May 1880 Dabormida was re-attached to the Army Staff, and by November 1881 he was nominated secretary to the Army Chief of Staff, general Cosenz. Promoted Lt. colonel in 1883, he served in this capacity until June 1887, when he was reassigned to the 3rd Infantry Regiment as provisional commander. In April 1888 he was promoted colonel and confirmed in his role. Two years later, Dabormida was again reassigned to the Army Staff. In 1891, he published in Rome La battaglia dell'Assietta, a study wrote for his students when he was a teacher in the School of War about the 1747 Battle of Assietta. Promoted major general in July 1895, he received the command of \\"Cagliari\\" Brigade. On 12 January 1896, he was shipped to Eritrea and took command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade.  Battle of Adwa and death  On 12 February, pressed by the Prime Minister Francesco Crispi, Baratieri had his forces dug in at strong positions at Sauria, from Menelik's camp. By 27 February, the army had only a few days supply left and the intelligence wrongly reported that the Ethiopians were scattered across the hills of Adwa, foraging. Unable or unwilling to decide between a temporary withdrawal or a small advance, the Governor asked for the advice of his brigade commanders: Giuseppe Arimondi, Matteo Albertone, Dabormida and the newly appointed Giuseppe Ellena. Dabormida joined Arimondi and Albertone in their call for an aggressive approach, reportedly arguing that, since the troops morale was high, a retreat would only bring it down. He declared that Italy would prefer the loss of two to three thousand men to a dishonorable retreat. On 28 February, Baratieri resolved to advance towards the Ethiopian camp at Adwa. His orders on 29 February called for an offensive thrust to occupy a solid position on the hill east of Adwa. From there on he could react according to the moves of the Abyssinians; defend if attacked, keep the position if unmolested or attack the rearguard of the Negus' army if it retreated from Adwa. The field force was ordered to move during the night; Albertone and the Native Brigade on the left flank, was to occupy the Kidane Meret peak, Dabormida on the right flank, the mountain of the Rebbi Arienni and Arimondi, with the center, again the Rebbi Arienni, in a less prominent position. The reserve brigade of General Ellena was stationed behind Arimondi.  Night march  At 21:30 the brigades of Albertone, Arimondi and Dabormida were on their way, each following different roads; Ellena's brigade was to follow Arimondi three hours later, with Baratieri and his staff. Uninvolved in the marching incidents between Arimondi and Albertone, Dabormida reach his intended position at 5:15 on 1 March, fifteen minutes before his colleague. By the time he deployed his men, the isolated force of Albertone on the Kidane Meret was launching its attack on the Ethiopian camp. The Native Brigade at first met little resistance, but was soon repulsed by the larger number of enemy troops.  Dabormida's advance  At 6:45 Baratieri, who had spent a full hour reconnoitering the ground on which he planned to fight, reached the Rebbi Arienni and heard the sounds of the ongoing battle on the left. He ordered Dabormida to advance to the Spur of Belah and support by fire Albertone, whom he assumed to be at the \\"false\\" Kidane Meret or little ahead. Once Dabormida got his brigade to the Spur, he discovered Albertone was much further off than supposed, and continued to slowly march westwards, across difficult ground. By 7:45 his rearguards had left the Hill and Spur of Belah, and, following the terrain's nature, Dabormida's brigade entered the west-east arm of the Mariam Shavitu valley, about 3 miles north of Albertone's Native Brigade. By 8:15 the morning mist cleared: Baratieri climbed the slopes of Mount Eshasho to survey the situation, and discovered that Albertone was heavily engaged. At 8:30 the advanced 1st Native Battalion of Albertone's command was forced to retreat in disarray: Baratieri sent a message to Dabormida, ordering him to aid Albertone, but the messenger decided he could turn back once he had met a courier from Dabormida. The commander of the 2nd Infantry Brigade informed his commanding officer that he was \\"holding out his hand to Albertone\\", and Baratieri assumed the 2nd Brigade was about to link up with Albertone. Baratieri, still assuming Dabormida had a strong hold over the Spur of Belah, sent two other messengers, but neither reach Dabormida. Actually, the major general had left at the Spur only local auxiliaries, and about 9:30 they had been driven off by infiltrating Ethiopians, who also started to attack the isolated 2nd Brigade.

Following amendments to the Constitution of Singapore, the 2017 election was the first to be reserved for a particular racial group under a hiatus-triggered model, and was restricted to candidates from the minority Malay community, who had not held the presidential office since 1970. Background The President is the head of state of Singapore. Following the Westminster system, the position is largely ceremonial, but enjoys several reserve powers including withholding presidential assent on supply bills and changing or revoking civil service appointments.Constitution, Arts. 148A and 148D.Constitution, Art. 22(1). The current system of holding elections for the Presidency began with the 1993 election, with the election of Ong Teng Cheong. Before then, the President was selected by Parliament.Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1991 (No. 5 of 1991), in force on 30 November 1991 except for sections 7 and 16 which came into force on 1 February 1991 and s. 3 which was not brought into force and was subsequently repealed by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1996 (No. 41 of 1996). There are strict requirements for prospective presidential election candidates, and whether a candidate meets the qualifications or not is decided by the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC), who are given the task of issuing a certificate of eligibility (COE) to prospective candidates. The Presidency is, by the rules of the Constitution, required to be nonpartisan. However, the incumbent President, Halimah Yacob had ties with the People's Action Party up until her presidential campaign. She was a member of the party's Central Executive Committee, as well as the chair of the party's Seniors Group. She was also an elected PAP Member of Parliament and Speaker of Parliament prior to her resignation in 2017 to run for President.

Missing in action during the Battle of Pozi√®res, 16 August 1916, and is commemorated on the Thiepval Memorial. The Gloucestershire Regiment was a line infantry regiment of the British Army. Before World War I it comprised two regular battalions, two reserve battalions, and two territorial battalions. During the war an additional 18 battalions were raised. In total 16 battalions of the Gloucestershire Regiment saw active service during World War I; on the Western Front in France and Flanders, Italy, Gallipoli, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, and Salonika.  Background  Bantam battalion. The Gloucestershire Regiment was formed as a result of the Childers Reforms of 1881 by the amalgamation of the 28th and the 61st Regiments, and was headquartered at Horfield Barracks in Bristol.Daniell pp.186-187 The new regiment comprised two regular and four auxiliary battalions. The regiment was further restructured following the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 ‚Äì part of the Haldane Reforms which converted the militia and volunteer auxiliary battalions into the Special Reserve and the Territorial Force ‚Äì and at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 the Gloucestershire Regiment comprised: * 1st Battalion ‚Äì assigned to the 3rd Infantry Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, British Expeditionary Force * 2nd Battalion ‚Äì deployed to Tianjin, China * 3rd (Special Reserve) Battalion ‚Äì based at the regimental depot in Bristol * 4th (City of Bristol) Battalion, Territorial Force ‚Äì based at Queen's Road in Clifton and subsequently Old Market Street in Bristol * 5th Battalion, Territorial Force ‚Äì based at Brunswick Road in Gloucester (since demolished) * 6th Battalion, Territorial Force ‚Äì based at St Michael's Hill in Bristol (since demolished)Daniell pp201-202 During the course of the war the regiment raised an additional 18 battalions. Each of the Territorial Force battalions volunteered for service overseas and raised a second battalion. The six territorial battalions were numbered 1/4th, 2/4th, 1/5th, 2/5th, 1/6th, and 2/6th. The Territorials also raised a 3rd battalion each in 1915 as home-based reserves, though in 1916 these were merged to form the 4th (City of Bristol) Reserve Battalion.Daniell p.423 Another home-based territorial battalion, the 17th, was raised in 1917. Additionally, as volunteers answered Kitchener's call to arms, ten New Army battalions, the 7th to the 16th, were added to the regiment's establishment between 1914 and 1916. Finally, the 18th battalion was raised in 1918 from a cadre of the 5th Battalion, the Ox & Bucks Light Infantry.Bullock, 2009 Of the 24 Gloucestershire Regiment battalions that existed during the war, 16 were to see active service; on the western front in France and Flanders, Italy, Gallipoli, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, and Salonika.Daniell p203.

The French, whose main effort was directed towards Alsace and Lorraine as a prelude to an invasion of Germany, were thrown onto the defensive on their left flank, which included one cavalry and four infantry divisions of the British Expeditionary Force. At the end of a two-week retreat from Mons the French managed to stop the Germans on the outskirts of Paris in the First Battle of the Marne. German forces retreated to the River Aisne and dug in, the first act of trench warfare that was to dominate the war.Sheffield pp32-37 The Gloucestershire Regiment suffered its first casualties of the war on 26 August 1914 during the retreat from Mons, when 1st Battalion fought a rearguard action in the vicinity of Landrecies, southwest of Mons, losing 5 killed and 30 wounded before retiring with the rest of the 1st Division. By the time that the retreat ended the battalion had covered 200 miles in just 13 days. As the Germans fell back to the Aisne, the Anglo-French forces went over to the offensive, and on 13 September 1st Division began crossing the river, their objective being the Chemin des Dames ridge in the area of Cerny and Courtecon. The next day a German attack pushed back the division's 2nd Brigade, and the Glosters' B and C Companies covered the retreat of the now exposed 1st Brigade. For their actions, 2nd Lieutenant Watkins of C Company was awarded the Military Cross (MC), and Privates Orr and Law of D Company were awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM), the first such awards to the regiment in the war.Littlewood pp1-2. Privates Orr and Law crossed 100 yards of open ground under fire to rescue a wounded scout By the time the BEF moved to Ypres in mid-October, total casualties to the battalion in the fighting along the river Aisne had risen to 150 officers and men.Daniell pp204-205  First Battle of Ypres  Battalions involved: 1st 1st Battalion at the Battle of Langemarck, 21 October 1914 With stalemate on the Aisne, the opposing armies attempted to outflank each other in the Race to the Sea, which ended 8 October with the French Tenth Army facing the German Sixth Army close to the coast in the area of St. Omer. Between 11‚Äì18 October the BEF moved from the Aisne and slotted into the allied left flank in the area between St. Omer and Bethune, on the right of the French Tenth Army.Wyrall pp56-58 The allies planned to attack northeast on a line between Ypres and Nieuport, drive the weakened German III Corps against the coast, and wheel right to take the rest of the German Sixth Army in the flank and rear. They had not discovered, however, that behind III Corps the Germans had assembled the Fourth Army, consisting of four fresh corps, and were themselves planning to attack, and the opposing forces clashed in the First Battle of Ypres (19 October - 22 November 1914).Wyrall pp61-62 On 21 October, during the Battle of Langemarck, the opening engagement of the First Battle of Ypres, 1st Battalion occupied a salient around the village of Langemarck, nearly north of Ypres. Elements of C Company commanded by Lieutenant Wetherall, defending the tip of the salient at the hamlet of Koekuit, were particularly hard pressed, beating back repeated attacks until ordered to withdraw after dark. For his stubborn defence Wetherall was awarded the MC.Daniell p205Wyrall pp64-68 Two days later three platoons led by Captain Rising conducted a \\"...stout defence...\\" against a \\"...determined attack by the enemy...\\" on the northern outskirts of Langemarck. Their situation had become critical when the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards was forced back, exposing the Glosters' left flank. Two of the three platoon leaders were killed and the third wounded, and with 51 casualties amongst the other ranks, Rising's group came close to being overwhelmed.Wyrall pp68-69 For their actions Captain Rising was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), Lieutenant Baxter (4 Platoon commander) was awarded the MC, and four men were awarded the DCM.Wyrall pp69-70 The DCM recipients were Sergeants Eddy and Knight, both of A Company, Private Crossman, also A Company, and Private Wilson, D Company. 1st Division was relieved overnight on 24‚Äì25 October, and 1st Glosters marched into reserve positions behind the lines near Gheluvelt, some east of Ypres early on the 25th.Wyrall p71 On 28 October 1st Battalion was notified that it may be called on as a reserve by 1st Brigade. Accordingly a platoon and Lt. Duncan's machine-gun section went into the line alongside the Coldstream Guards at the Kruiseecke crossroads on the Menin road south east of Gheluvelt. At 06:30 the next day Lt.Duncan appeared at battalion HQ to report the loss of his guns; a large German force had emerged from the early morning mist and practically annihilated the Guards battalions. A counter- attack towards Gheluvelt by 1st Battalion broke down into a series of disconnected company actions. C Company advanced into the chateau northeast of the village, but took several casualties early on and ceased to exist as a company when the few officers remaining became separated. A Company advanced close behind C Company and linked up with the remnants of the Black Watch and Scots Guards, but a mixed group of 120 Glosters and Guards were outflanked and forced to surrender. D Company advanced to within of the original front line on the Kruiseecke road, where they helped rally the remnants of the Guards there, but found themselves otherwise alone facing enemy both to the north and east. Outnumbered, they nevertheless stood their ground until the remainder of A Company arrived to their rear, allowing them to fall back . B Company had followed behind D, then turned right to advance on Kruiseecke, but were stopped east of Gheluvelt. In the afternoon 3rd Brigade came up and relieved the surviving Glosters, though a party of some 50 or 60 men under B Company commander Captain Blunt remained in positions in front of the line until the evening. The battalion had lost 7 officers and 160 other ranks.Wyrall pp71-75 As the battle raged on around Ypres the Glosters were repeatedly called upon to participate in costly counter-attacks: on 31 October and 2 November around Gheluvelt; on 6 November towards Zwarteleen some southeast of Ypres; and on 11 November in the Battle of Nonne Bosschen. Casualties had at one stage reduced the battalion to 200 ‚Äì 300 all ranks, around a quarter of its original strength. Other units fared little better, with 3rd Brigade having been reduced to little more than battalion strength. By mid-November the German attempt to capture Ypres exhausted itself, and 1st Battalion was taken out of the line to be rested and brought back up to strength. The Glosters had a month previously marched towards Langemarck with 25 officers and 970 other ranks. Of that number, just 2 officers and not more than 100 men had survived the First Battle of Ypres.Wyrall pp77-88  Winter 1914-1915  On 20 December the Germans attacked the Indian Corps around the village of Givenchy, and 1st Division received orders to assist in its defence. After an overnight march of more than the division arrived in the area on the afternoon of the next day, but the village had fallen and the division was ordered to counter- attack. The Glosters took up positions around Le Plantin, south of Festubert. On their right was 1st Brigade, opposite Givenchy, and on their left, in Festubert, was 1st Battalion South Wales Borderers. The counter-attack, which began at 15:05, was made over water-logged terrain which clogged the rifles with mud, and was immediately subject to heavy artillery and rifle fire. The Glosters advanced with three companies forward and the fourth in support, but lost touch with both Borderers and Guards. The support company was sent to try and find the Guards, without success, and the 2nd Battalion Welch Regiment was ordered into the gap between the Glosters and the Borderers. By nightfall 1st Division had retaken the ground lost the previous day, except for a small pocket in front of Festubert. A further attack the next day was cancelled, and the Glosters remained in the trenches for rest of the month in appalling conditions. Casualties to the battalion this day numbered 7 officers and 158 other ranks.Littlewood p5Wyrall pp89-91 1st Battalion returned to the trenches around Givenchy 12 January. They endured snow and frost, and when a thaw set in the water damaged the parapets, at one stage making it necessary to sap forward and dig new trenches in front of the original line. On 25 January A and D Companies were in the front line, with B Company in local reserve and C Company in brigade reserve, when the Germans launched an attack. Although the Glosters stopped many in front of their trenches, some 60 enemy succeeded in infiltrating into Givenchy, behind the Glosters' positions. In echoes of the regiment's stand at the Battle of Alexandria in 1801, D Company fought for a while back to back until the enemy was eliminated in a counter-attack by 1st Battalion Black Watch. By nightfall the situation was stabilised, and all battalions of the brigade were congratulated on their successful defence by the Commander-in-Chief and Corps commander. The battalion lost 4 officers and 36 other ranks in the fighting, and two MCs and three DCMs were awarded.Wyrall pp94-96  Second Battle of Ypres  Battalions involved: 2nd On 22 April the Germans launched their only offensive of 1915, the Second Battle of Ypres (22 April‚Äì25 May 1915), with a gas attack on the salient north of Ypres. By early May they had pushed back the French and Canadians defending the north and northeast, and forced the allies into a general withdrawal to shorten their lines. The third engagement of the battle, the Battle of Frezenberg Ridge, began 8 May when three Germans Corps attacked the salient in an arc across the Menin road from northeast to southeast. The British 27th Division held the line astride the Menin road, and the Gloster's 2nd Battalion, numbering over 800 men of all ranks, were in the line on the eastern edge of Sanctuary Wood, south of the road.Sheffield p51Nicholson pp71-88Wyrall p101-102 & 105 On 9 May the enemy succeeded in occupying part of the forward trench line held by 2nd Battalion. Some 30 men of B Company were cut off, and two failed attempts to retake the trenches could not rescue them. The survivors eventually managed the perilous journey back to the main line after dark, on a day which cost the battalion 5 officers (including the battalion commander) and 140 men. In the early hours of 12 May Captain Vicary conducted a lone reconnaissance of a small hill that overlooked the British lines and which had been lost the previous day. Finding his route back blocked by the enemy he made a dash for it, only to trip over a wounded German officer, whom he then dragged back to the British lines. Later that day B Company twice took the hill, both times being forced back by heavy artillery fire which cost it some 30 casualties. The Battle of Frezenberg Ridge drew to a close on 13 May, and 2nd Battalion was taken out of the line when 81st Brigade was relieved. On 20 May they were inspected by the BEF commander, Field Marshall Sir John French, who told them \\"Your Colours have many famous names emblazoned on them, but none will be more famous or more well deserved than that of the Second Battle of Ypres\\". The battle had reduced the battalion's strength to about 550 all ranks.Wyrall pp108-113Daniell pp207-208  Battle of Aubers Ridge  Battalions involved: 1st If 9 May 1915 was a severe test for 2nd Battalion, the day went no better for 1st Battalion in the Battle of Aubers Ridge (9 May 1915). In this battle the British First Army attacked in the area of Neuve Chapelle in support of the French Tenth Army offensive to the south (the Second Battle of Artois). The first British objective was the line Rue de Marais - Lorgies - Fromelles, and 1st Division's 3rd Brigade was in the line at Richebourg L'Avoue, southwest of Neuve Chapelle. The Gloster's 1st Battalion was assigned to the reserve and tasked with continuing the advance to Rue de Marais once the assaulting battalions had taken their objectives.Wyrall pp117-118 At 05:30 3rd Brigade's initial assault, by 2nd Battalion Royal Munster Fusiliers and 2nd Battalion Welch Regiment, was cut down as the men left their trenches and failed to take the objective. A poorly coordinated follow-up attack at 07:00 by 1st Glosters and 1st Battalion South Wales Borderers fared even worse, advancing at most and serving only to add to the dead and wounded lying in no-man's land before being recalled. At 16:00, following a barrage as ineffective in softening up the German defences as the first two, the Glosters and Borderers launched a third attack. The enemy did not even take shelter, but lined their parapets to shoot down the British in an attack that reached no further than the enemy wire. 1st Battalion sustained 264 casualties this day - 11 officers and 253 other ranks. The heaviest losses were suffered by D Company which, in the final attack, lost all its officers, most of its NCOs, and about 90 men.Wyrall pp117-118Daniell p208 Daniell gives the casualties as 11 officers and 275 other ranks The attack was an unmitigated disaster for the British. It resulted in 12,000 casualties for no territorial gain, was of doubtful benefit to the French, and the inadequacy of the British artillery precipitated a political crisis in the UK.Sheffield p52Edmonds pp37‚Äì41  Battle of Loos  Battalions involved: 1st, 10th Battle of Loos In the Battle of Loos (25 September‚Äì8 October 1915) the British First Army attacked between Grenay and Givenchy in support of the French Tenth Army attack further south against Vimy (the Third Battle of Artois). 1st Division was at Le Rutoire, in the middle of the line, and was tasked with the sector running from Northern Sap to the Hulluch road. The division's assaulting brigades were the 1st - where the two Guards battalions had in August been replaced by 10th Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment and 8th Battalion Royal Berkshire Regiment - and 2nd, with 3rd Brigade in divisional reserve behind the line.Wyrall pp119-120daniell pp208-209 In the assault, 2nd Brigade was held up by heavy German fire and failed to reach the objective, but on their left 1st Brigade, led by 10th Glosters and 8th Berkshires, fought its way across of no-man's land. The Glosters' progress was slowed in many places by uncut wire, and one company lost all its officers before it was able to cut its way through. Amongst numerous acts of heroism was that of Private Ingles, who rushed the German parapet alone and kept the defenders heads down while the rest of his unit got through the wire. The two battalions took heavy casualties, the Glosters alone losing 459 men, but succeeded in taking the first line of German trenches beyond Bois Carr√©, earning the praise of Field Marshal Sir John French.Daniell pp209-210Wyrall p122. Wyrall states that the 10th Battalion lost all but some 60 men. A search using the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Find War Dead facility for deaths incurred by the 10th Battalion The Gloucestershire Regiment on 25 September 1915 yields 162 names. A letter home from an unnamed Lance-Corporal of the 10th mentions the gallantry displayed that day, and hints at the price paid:Daniell p209 > My word, as soon as the order was given the Gloucesters were out and over > the parapet and soon doing great havoc among the Germans. About 400 yards > separated us from the German first line; and I am sorry to say we lost a lot > of gallant men getting there... In the afternoon 1st Battalion was ordered to make a flanking attack on the Germans who were still holding up 2nd Brigade's advance, but the enemy surrendered before the Glosters could get into position, and the battalion advanced instead to Bois Hugo, in the south east corner of the salient now formed by the British attack. The following morning they were relieved by the 8th Royal Lincolnshire Regiment, but the handover took too long; as dawn broke B and D Companies began to take casualties, and the machine-gun section had to be left behind.Wyrall pp122-123. The Lincolns were later driven from Bois Hugo, and the Glosters' machine-gun section were never heard from again. Some of their bodies were found years later. 1st Battalion returned to the area on 5 October when they occupied the trenches in a chalk pit just behind Bois Hugo, now in enemy hands. On 8 October they took the brunt of an enemy counter-attack there that was estimated at six battalions, which, with support from the artillery of 15th Division, was quickly broken up. The battalion lost about 130 men this day, but \\"...had a good fight; all ranks were overjoyed when the time came to meet the attackers with the bullet, thus to get their own back, not only for the shelling that they had endured earlier in the day, but also for the never-forgotten 9th of May\\".Daniell p211 Quoting Lieutenant- Colonel Pagan, the battalion commander The Battle of Loos ended on 13 October, and in total accounted for 324 casualties of all ranks in 1st Battalion.Wyrall p124-127. 5 officers and 63 other ranks killed, and 5 officers and 251 other ranks wounded  Battle of the Boar's Head  Battalions involved: 13th Before dawn on 30 June, during the Battle of the Boar's Head (30 June 1916), the pioneers of 13th Battalion supported the 116th Brigade attack on a German salient south of Neuve Chapelle known as the Boar's Head. Their task was to dig communications trenches behind the advancing infantry. Due to the considerable troop movement and the failure of the infantry to achieve their main objective only B Company succeeded in reaching the German parapet. On several occasions the men of this company were forced to stop digging in order to defend themselves against German attacks, and for his actions Sgt. Tresise, who assumed command after both officers became casualties, was awarded the DCM. The battalion suffered 61 casualties.Littlewood p159  Battle of the Somme  Overview of the locations where each battalion fought during the Battle of the Somme Battalions involved: 1st, 1/4th, 1/5th, 1/6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 13th, 14th The Battle of the Somme (1 July ‚Äì 18 November 1916) was part of a coordinated allied effort to overwhelm the Austro-German defences that had been agreed at the Chantilly Conferences of 1915. Up until the battle, the Somme had been a comparatively quiet sector, allowing the German Second Army ample time to prepare a defence in depth consisting of wide belts of wire, trenches, fortified villages and deep dug-outs. General Rawlinson, commanding the Fourth Army which would do most of the fighting, adopted a 'bite and hold' approach based on artillery bombardment and limited tactical advances, and the Somme offensive became a succession of battles and a lengthy war of attrition in which nine battalions of the Gloucestershire Regiment saw action.Sheffield pp66-69 = Battle of Albert = On the third day of the Battle of Albert (1‚Äì13 July 1916), the opening engagement of the offensive, 57th Brigade attacked from the west and north of La Boiselle and then entered the village. When a German counter-attack pushed the British from the east end of the village and killed or wounded all the other 57th Brigade commanders, the commander of 8th Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment, Lieutenant-Colonel Adrian Carton de Wiart, assumed control of their commands. The village was finally captured on 4 July, and 8th Battalion was relieved the next day, having lost 6 officers killed, 14 wounded and 282 other ranks killed, wounded or missing.Daniell p223Rawson pp54-558th Battalion War Diary p115 For his actions in averting a serious reverse at La Boisselle Lieutenant-Colonel de Wiart was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC), which he credited to the 8th, \\"for every man in the Battalion has done as much as I have\\".Gliddon = Battle of Bazentin = On 16 July, during the Battle of Bazentin (14‚Äì17 July), the Glosters' 1st Battalion was part of the 3rd Brigade advance from Contalmaison in an intricate night attack which occupied the German front-line and support trenches northwest of Bazentin-le-Petit Wood. The attack cost the battalion three killed and 25 wounded.Daniell pp219-220McCarthy p51 The same day, the regiment's three front-line territorial battalions moved into the line west of Ovillers, to the west of Bazentin-le-Petit. Alongside 1/7th Battalion Worcestershire Regiment, 1/4th Battalion fought for two days to capture first the German trenches west and northwest of Ovillers and then, along with troops of the 25th Division who were attacking from the south, the village itself. The fighting cost the battalion 275 men.Wyrall pp155-158Daniell pp221-222 1/5th and 1/6th Battalions were in action between 19‚Äì23 July, making local attacks against strongpoints to the north and northeast. These actions were costly affairs and in just one example on 21 July 1/6th Battalion lost 3 officers and 101 other ranks.Wyrall pp159-163 On 14 July 18th Division had captured Tr√¥nes Wood, some southeast of Bazentin le Petit Wood, and four days later the bantam 35th Division relieved it. The Glosters' 14th Battalion went into the line at the northern end of the wood, and on 19 July it suffered 107 casualties.McCarthy pp45-46 & 52Westlake p138 = Battle of Fromelles = The Battle of Fromelles (19‚Äì20 July) was not part of the Somme offensive, but was designed to draw German troops away from there. The Glosters' 2/4th and 2/6th were the assault battalions of 183rd Brigade, in the centre of 61st Division's front, and J.D.Wyatt, a company commander in the 2/4th, witnessed the moment the Glosters commenced their assault on 19 July: > Attacking Companies had started to go over the parapet when the bombardment > lifted and were met immediately by a very heavy machine gun fire. The > leading platoons were practically wiped out at once and no one could get any > further. The other Regiments on our flanks got it worse if anything.Papers > of Lt Col J D Wyatt, Imperial War Museum Department of Documents, 4160 Box > 83/12/1 The same inadequate artillery preparation that plagued 1st Battalion's attack at Aubers Ridge the previous year resulted in the same futile losses against strong defences.Lee pp1, 121-122, 137-138, & 152. The other units involved fared even worse than the Glosters. The 61st Division suffered 1547 casualties, while the Australian 5th Division lost 5533 men, making the battle the bloodiest 24 hours in the history of the Australian army Casualties to 2/4th Battalion numbered 7 of its 20 officers and 152 of the 550 other ranks that formed up at the start of the battle, while of the 20 officers and 600 men of the 2/6th, 13 officers and 164 men were lost.War Diaries and papers of the 61st Division. WO 95/3033 Headquarters Branches and Services: General Staff 1915 Sept. - 1917 May Actions by the territorial battalions of the Gloucestershire Regiment during the Battle of Pozi√®res = Battle of Pozi√®res = On the first day of the Battle of Pozi√®res (23 July‚Äì3 September), the Glosters of 1/5th and 1/6th Battalions made supporting attacks against the German trenches about to the west. At the same time, about to the east of the village, 10th Battalion attacked the German trenches known as the Switch Line. Some to the right of the 10th, 8th Battalion attacked the Intermediate Trench which ran south of the Switch Line. All of these attacks were repulsed with heavy casualties. 1/5th Battalion lost 8 officers and 148 other ranks, while 8th Battalion lost 14 officers, including Lieutenant-Colonel de Wiart with a gunshot wound to the neck, and 186 other ranks.Wyrall pp160-163 & p165. Sources do not give details of 10th Battalion casualties, though a search using the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Find War Dead facility for deaths incurred by the 10th Battalion The Gloucestershire Regiment on 23 July 1916 yields 52 names. The 1/6th Battalion reported total casualties for the month of July, which combines losses suffered before and during the Battle of Pozi√®res, as 8 officers killed and 11 wounded, plus 20 killed, 62 missing, and 296 wounded amongst the other ranks.Keech pp69-72 & 76-788th Battalion War Diary p117 8th Battalion was back in action on 30 July in another attack on the Intermediate Trench, which also failed, and for the second time in a week the battalion lost its commanding officer when Major Lord A.G. Thynne, who had taken over command on 24 July, was wounded.8th Battalion War Diary pp117-118 On 17 and 19 August, 10th Battalion made two further unsuccessful attempts against the Intermediate TrenchWestlake p137. Again the sources give no figures for casualties, though a search using the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Find War Dead facility for deaths incurred by the 10th Battalion The Gloucestershire Regiment 17‚Äì19 August 1916 yields 37 names. On 21 August an attack by 1/4th Battalion succeeded in occupying the first two lines of the Leipzig Redoubt, just under west of Pozi√®res.Wyrall pp167-172 On the 1/4th's right, 1/6th Battalion was engaged in two days of fierce fighting before finally subduing the enemy and securing the flank on the morning of 23 July.Wyrall pp169-170 & 172-173 The territorial's final action in the Battle of Pozi√®res was on 27 August, when 1/5th Battalion made a successful assault near Pole Trench in Nab valley, to the east of the Leipzig Redoubt. The battalion captured some 50 prisoners and inflicted an estimated 200 casualties on the enemy for the loss of 6 officers and 98 other ranks.McCarthy p84Wyrall pp173-174. Amongst the fallen was the Fifth Gloster Gazette editor Lieutenant Cyril Winterbotham. = High Wood = 1st Battalion spent a week in the line near High Wood at the end of August, during which time it endured the most intense shelling it experienced in the whole war. After three days the trenches were practically obliterated, forcing the men into the shell holes in front of them, and by the time the battalion was relieved on 28 August it had lost 46 killed and 141 wounded.Wyrall pp166-167 On 8 September the battalion joined the 2nd Welch and 9th Black Watch in an attack which carried the German second line in High Wood, but a lack of reinforcements forced them to withdraw.Wyrall pp175-177McCarthy p97 The attack cost 1st Battalion 3 officers (amongst them the commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Pagan), of whom 5 were killed, and 206 other ranks, of whom 84 were killed, leaving the battalion with just 4 officers and 96 other ranks fit for duty.Wyrall pp177-178 The next day 10th Battalion suffered 122 casualties in a failed attack through the northwest corner of the wood.Rawson p171Westlake p137 = Battle of Guillemont = On 3 September, during the Battle of Guillemont (3‚Äì6 September), 12th Battalion lost 328 men in an attack that succeeded in occupying the German second line from Wedge Wood to the southeastern edge of Guillemont. After the village was captured the battalion pushed on to Leuze Wood, nearly east of Guillemont, completing an advance of by 95th Brigade during the battle.Hussey & Inman pp120-123 The battalion was in action again during the Battle of Morval (25‚Äì28 September) when, along with 2nd Battalion King's Own Scottish Borderers, it captured the southern half of Morval.McCarthy pp115-116Hussey & Inman pp125-126 = Operations on the Ancre = The pioneers of 13th Battalion supported 39th Division in the Ancre sector on the northern flank of the Somme offensive, and were active in the Battle of the Ancre Heights (1 October‚Äì11 November) and the Battle of the Ancre (13‚Äì18 November).Littlewood p160McCarthy p149 8th Battalion was also active on the Ancre when 19th Division relieved 25th Division, and on 26 October the commanding officer, Lt. Col. Carton de Wiart VC DSO, was again wounded.Littlewood p118 On 18 November, the last day of the Battle of the Somme, the battalion advanced with a company from 10th Royal Warwickshire Regiment into the south-western end of the village of Grandcourt, though they were forced to abandon the village the next day.McCarthy pp160 & 162 Casualties to the 8th Battalion in this action numbered 12 officers and 283 other ranks.8th Battalion War Diary p133  Winter 1916-1917  It had been agreed in November that the British Fourth Army would take over the French Sixth Army's positions between Peronne and Roye south of the Somme, and by February 1917 the territorials of 1/4th and 1/6th were in the front line north of Barleux, with 1/5th in reserve at Flaucourt. To their right, 1st Division, with 1st and 10th Battalions, took up positions south of Barleux.Wyrall pp183-184Littlewood p141 In November, 61st Division was transferred to the Fifth Army, and the 2nd line territorials moved into positions on the Ancre around Grandcourt, Thiepval and Aveluy.Littlewood pp51, 73 & 99 8th Battalion spent the rest of 1916 out of the line at G√©zaincourt, Beauval, and Bayencourt, with spells in the trenches around H√©buterne and Courcelles in January and February 1917.8th Battalion War Diary pp133-146 In early October, 12th Battalion went with the 5th Division to the First Army on the Bethune front, and in March 1917 they were transferred again, to the Canadian Corps on the Vimy front.Littlewood pp147-148 In November, 13th Battalion went with the 39th Division to Ypres.Littlewood p160 At the end of August, 14th Battalion went with 35th Division to the Third Army on the Arras front, and in February 1917 they were transferred again, to the Fourth Army to relieve the French 154th Division around Chaulnes and Chilly, over southwest of Barleux.Littlewood p168  German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line  German withdrawal to Hindenburg Line Over the winter the German high command decided to evacuate the Bapaume and Noyan salients created by the Battle of the Somme and withdraw to a more defensible line. The Hindenburg Line ran southwest from the River Scarpe near Arras to San Quentin then south to the River Aisne east of Soissons. British operations on the Ancre in February forced an early retirement there, but the main withdrawal began 16 March 1917, preceded by a week of laying waste to the territory being abandoned.Wyrall p185 Footnotes Notes References Pages 48, 62, 69, 71, 73, 75, 80, 84, 91, 95, 100, 102, 104.     * Gloucestershire Regiment Infantry regiments of the British Army Military units and formations established in 1881 Regiments of the British Army in World War I Military units and formations in Gloucestershire Military units and formations in Bristol Military units and formations disestablished in 1994 1881 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Gloucestershire Regiment in World War I"},{"id":"55403254","text":"Cyperus cunninghamii is a sedge of the family Cyperaceae that is native to Australia.

Ramic moved to the US in 2000, became an American citizen in 2006, but moved to Germany, in 2014, to live with relatives who had settled there, after filing bankruptcy in the USA. In 2012-2013 Ramic worked as a nutrition consultant in Rockford Illinois, for her local schoolboard. The other five individuals were all arrested by American law enforcement officials, when charges were laid. Ramic was arrested by German officials, and chose to waive her right to contest her extradition. Unlike the other five Ramic chose to plead guilty, on September 28, 2015. She was sentenced, on January 5, 2016, to three years imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release. During her sentencing the court was informed Ramic first sent funds to Pazara based on claims on his facebook page that he was helping orphans. The court was informed that Ramic had a long history of supporting humanitarian causes. The prosecution argued that she sent funds to help support Pazara's activities Pazara on three occasions, in 2013, for a total of US$700, even after she learned he was fighting for the al Nusra Front. According to press reports Ramic sent that $700 to Pazara even though the mortgage on her home was in default. Even though Ramic pled guilty in 2016, in 2017 she joined with her alleged co-conspirators in a motion to get their charges dropped. They argued that Pazara should be considered a lawful combatant, claiming he fought with militia's that operated with the support of the US government. Ramic was married, and bore two children.

The site is a double mound, consisting of a large keyhole-shaped kofun with a smaller adjacent circular kofun. Both were collectively designated a National Historic Site in 1956, with the area covered by the designation expanded in 1968. Overview The Raijinyama kofun is the largest in the T≈çhoku region and is located at the top of Natori hill where many large tumuli are concentrated, overlooking the Sendai Plain. It has a total length of 168 meters, and was once partially surrounded by a moat. It was built in steps, partially by utilizing the contours of a natural hill, and was once covered in fukiishi. A portion of the posterior tumulus collapsed during the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake, suggesting that it contained a clay coffin or wooden coffin in a burial chamber. North of the main kofun is a smaller domed tumulus with a diameter of 54 meters called the \\"Kozuka kofun\\". The tomb does not appear in any historical records and the name of rank of the person buried within is unknown. It has only been partially excavated; however, From the style of the mound and the pot-shaped haniwa and Sue ware pottery fragments discovered at the site, archaeologists have dated the kofun to the late 4th or early 5th century AD.

It is protected by the central government as a National Historic Site. Background In the late Nara period, after the establishment of a centralized government under the Ritsury≈ç system, the Yamato court sent a number of military expeditions to what is now the T≈çhoku region of northern Japan to bring the local Emishi tribes under its control. The site is believed to have been the location of the civil administration of Watari District in the Heian period. The name of Watari District appears in ancient records, including the Shoku Nihongi, Nihon K≈çki and the Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku, and the site dates from the same 9th to the early 10th century . The site was excavated by the Miyagi Prefectural Board of Education (1986-1988), and by Watari Town (since 2002). Description The ruins are located on the south bank of the Abukuma River in southern Miyagi Prefecture. The site consists of the remnants of a rectangular enclosure, approximately 180 meters east-west by 200 meters north-south, with remnants of a moat and earthen rampart, presumably surmounted by a wooden palisade. Inside the enclosure, there was a secondary wall 50 x 60 meters, containing the elevated foundation base of a large building. There are traces of the gate on the east and south side of the palisade. Earthenware from the 9th century has been excavated from the south gate. To the south of the central complex were two long buildings, 6 meters east and west and 26 meters north and south, in symmetrical positions in the east and west, forming a ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shape. Both long buildings have been rebuilt once, and were presumably barracks. Up to ten warehouse ruins on the southern end the ruins were surrounded on all sides by a moat of about 150 meters wide. These warehouses were presumably for storing tax rice. This arrangement was common to Heian period county administrative complexes in other parts of the country. The ruins were backfilled after evacuation, and is nothing to be seen at the site today except for a commemorative stone marker. The site is about 10 minutes on foot from ≈åkuma Station on the JR East Joban Line.

Allegorical sculptures on the facade of the House of the Blackheads, made by Volz The fountain in front of the Latvian National Opera. Volz designed both the fountain and the interiors of the opera house. Sculpture by Volz on a house in Tallinn designed by Jacques Rosenbaum August Volz (; 27 February 1851 ‚Äì 20 June 1926) was a German sculptor. Born in Magdeburg, Volz worked mainly in Riga, the present-day capital of Latvia. The workshop of Volz received prestigious commissions in Riga from its opening in 1876 and created several of the most well-known sculptures of the city, for example the Roland statue and sculptures decorating the House of the Blackheads. The firm of Volz was also responsible for the complete or partial decoration of a number of important public buildings in the city. Biography August Franz Leberecht Volz was born as the eleventh child of shoemaker Johann Volz and his wife Johanne, n√©e Morin, in Magdeburg. He received his basic education in the city and began an apprenticeship at a sculptor's workshop in Magdeburg at the age of 1865. In the spring of 1869 he moved to Berlin, where he initially worked in a sculptor's workshop and from autumn studied sculpting at the Prussian Academy of Arts under the tutelage of , Carl Domschke, Friedrich Eggers and Karl Geppert. In 1870, at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, Volz tried to join the military but was refused, the first time because he was underage and the second time because there were already too many volunteers. Throughout his studies, Volz had been working at different workshops. In October 1871, Volz ceased his studies at the academy and began to work full-time for the firm Ende & B√∂ckmann. The firm also took on commissions abroad, and it was through Ende & B√∂ckmann that Volz came to Riga in the autumn of 1875 to work on the sculptural decoration of a large tenement house (on the present-day address Kri≈°jƒÅ≈Üa Barona iela 12). Already on 2 January 1876 he established his own firm in Riga. Riga had at that time a large Baltic German population. In addition to his own work as a sculptor, Volz taught at the Art Academy of Riga after its establishment in 1906. Volz married his first wife Maria, n√©e Thurm, in 1876. The couple had seven children, of which two died before World War I. Maria died in 1909 and in 1911 Volz married his second wife, Olga, n√©e Kalning. The couple had one son. Volz spent the rest of his life in Riga apart from the years of World War I, when he and his family were obliged to go into exile in the small town of Tsivilsk. This was because Volz had retained his German citizenship and the Russian Empire and Germany were at war. In Tsivilsk the family rented a room from the town's notary and were treated civilly by the authorities. His home in Riga, meanwhile, was used by both Russian officers and later Germans but kept intact and after his return in 1917 only his collection of hunting rifles were missing. Volz died in Riga in 1926. His descendants live in Germany. A memorial plaque was put up in 1996 at the site where Volz' workshop was located for many years on the present-day address Kri≈°jƒÅ≈Üa ValdemƒÅra iela 31. Workshop and firm Volz established himself in Riga at a time of great economic expansion of the old Hanseatic town, which was a major port of the Russian Empire. During the years around the turn of the 19th‚Äì20th centuries Riga experienced an unprecedented building activity. At the same time, a professional cadre of local sculptors had not yet formed. Volz' workshop could therefore operate without serious competition, and developed into a large and profitable enterprise. The firm eventually grew to employ about 130 people in the time around 1910, and had already in 1890 employed 40 people. Following the death of August Volz in 1926, his widow Olga continued operating the firm with great skill and energy. On the eve of World War II, because the Volz family was to be forcibly \\"repatriated\\" to Germany following the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, the firm was sold to the stone-carving firm of Oto Dambekalns. Style and scope Stylistically, August Volz had been trained in the classical tradition of the Academic art. Although his firm took on commissions ranging from simple structural elements such as stairs and columns to facades and interiors, portraits, memorial plaques and reliefs, Volz' arguably finest works were freestanding sculpture in the round in the form of free-standing monuments or architectural decoration. A question of dispute is how much the workshop of Volz contributed to providing sculptural elements for the extraordinary flowering of Art Nouveau architecture in Riga. Archival documentation is lacking, and while several sculptures e.g. on the expressive buildings on Alberta iela display characteristics which could certainly link them to the workshop of Volz, it is also known that August Volz himself was dismissive of Art Nouveau as a style. It is however known that Volz supplied the sculptural elements of the highly Art Nouveau buildings by Jacques Rosenbaum in neighbouring Tallinn, and for at least some Art Nouveau buildings in Riga. Works Public buildings One of the first prestigious commissions given to Volz was the decoration of the Nativity Cathedral, designed by architect Robert Pflug in a Byzantine Revival style and built 18876‚Äì1884; it is the largest Russian Orthodox Church in the Baltic states. Volz' company subsequently participated in the decoration of an additional two churches in Riga. One of Riga's most iconic buildings, the House of the Blackheads, underwent a significant alteration to designs by architect Heinrich Scheel in 1886 and Volz was responsible for the extensive sculptural decoration. The facade had already in the 17th century been decorated with four trompe-l'≈ìil paintings depicting four allegorical figures, and Volz thus created four sculptures representing the same deities: Hermes, Poseidon, Peace and Harmony, which each stand in a niche prominently displayed at the centre of the facade. Volz would continue to create sculptures for the House of the Blackheads but it remains unclear exactly which sculptures were made in his workshop; it has been assumed that the Saint George and the Dragon on the corner of the building as well as the two lions at the entrance are from the workshop of Volz. Volz' firm was also took active part in supplying decorations for both the present-day Latvian National Opera and the Latvian National Theatre. The entirety of the interior decoration for the opera was entrusted to Volz, while for the theatre the firm of Volz supplied the Atlas figures flanking the entrance while the interior decoration was entrusted to the firm Otto & Wassil. Volz workshop also supplied the sculpture group adorning the pediment of the present-day Latvian National Museum of Art in 1903. It depicts the Greek goddess Athena surrounded by allegorical figures representing civic and artistic traits. The present-day Art Academy of Latvia (built as a commercial school) also has capitals designed by Volz in a Neo- Gothic style, as well as reliefs and other forms of sculptural decoration. Volz' workshop also provided sculptures for the building of the present-day Ministry of Foreign Affairs, originally built as a bank. In addition, Volz provided sculptures and decorations for schools, factories, banks and monumental tenement houses in Riga. Monuments Volz made the Roland statue on the square in front of the House of the Blackheads in 1894. The presently visible statue is a copy (as are the statues on the House of the Blackheads, which was severely damaged during World War II and later destroyed during the Soviet occupation of Latvia) but the original, damaged statue remains preserved in St. Peter's Church. In 1888 a fountain designed and executed by Volz' company was placed in front of the Latvian National Opera. It draws on Baroque ideas and represents a nymph surrounded by young boys and dolphins. Like the Roland statue, the fountain was damaged during World War II and restored in 1987 by Mirdza Luka≈æa. The workshop of Volz also designed a similar statue of a knight for the Bastejkalns park (destroyed) and sculptures of lions in the Vƒìrmanes Garden. Works outside Riga While Volz' company was mostly active in Riga, the firm did take on some commissions outside the city limits. The company provided decorations and sculptures for no less than nine manor houses in the Latvian countryside; most of these have however been destroyed or damaged during the violent 20th century. The company also supplied sculptures for some buildings in Tallinn (present-day capital of Estonia), notably buildings by architect Jacques Rosenbaum and reliefs for the Estonian Drama Theatre. The company also provided sculptures for the Hludov baths in Moscow.

It is the third most recent quarter after Tidofeld and Leybuchtpolder, because it was only founded on 11 July 1934. On the terrain of the present parish lay the village of Westeel which was submerged in 1373 when the Leybucht bay flooded the area. Parts of the Leybucht were then dyked over the course of the centuries. In earlier centuries this was done manually and using spades, which is why the spade forms part of the Neuwesteel coat of arms. In the years 1928 and 1929 the roughly 600-hectare Leypolder was dyked.Eberhard Rack: Kleine Landeskunde Ostfrieslands, Isensee Verlag, Oldenburg 1998, p. 92 On this polder has stood the village of Neuwesteel since 1934. Initially it was part of the municipality of S√ºderpolder. On 1 October the whole municipality of S√ºderpolder was renamed Neuwesteel. The municipality of Neuwesteel became part of the collective municipality of Leybucht in 1965. As part of the territorial reforms in Lower Saxony in 1972 Neuwesteel was incorporated into the borough of Norden. As an incorporated subdistrict Neuwesteel still has a parish chairman (Ortsvorsteher), who represents the concerns of the roughly 340 inhabitants to the borough of Norden. Because the dyked polder soil is very fertile, the region was used from the very beginning for agricultural purposes. Cattle farming and crops predominate, especially the cultivation of potatoes. In Neuwesteel is the Leybucht Pumping Station, part of the Drainage Association of Norden, which ensures that the lower lying areas are drained via the Norder Tief. In addition to the pumping station is a campsite. Because there are no bridges for several kilometres along the Norder Tief, the river may be crossed in Neuwesteel on a P√ºnte, a type of raft. However, it is only for pedestrians and cyclists.

It premiered on October 2, 2017 and ended on March 31, 2018. The main character is based on Sei Yoshimoto, the co-founder of Yoshimoto Kogyo, one of Japan's largest entertainment companies that especially focuses on comedy. Plot Ten Fujioka is a young girl who lives in Kyoto in the late Meiji era and who loves to laugh. The daughter of a prominent pharmacist, one day she runs into a young entertainer, T≈çkichi Kitamura, who leaves a strong impression on her. Nearly a decade later, she runs into Tokichi again, and finds out that, while never succeeding as an entertainer, he is the eldest son of a prominent rice merchant in Osaka. Against her parents wishes, who expects her to marry a man who will take over the family business, Ten decides to elope with T≈çkichi. Her troubles have only started, however, as T≈çkichi's mother Tsueko initially rejects Ten as a potential bride, and then the rice store goes bankrupt. Toki, her former maid in Kyoto, comes to help her. Reduced to living in a poor tenement, Ten and T≈çkichi still borrow money from Ten's parents and buy a small yose (vaudeville hall) in the outskirts of Osaka. They encounter many difficulties in attracting customers and securing good entertainers, having to work through power-hungry brokers and convince competing factions of rakugo performers to support them. F≈´ta, who worked at the Kyoto pharmacy, first comes to work for the opposition and them switches sides to help Ten, whom he always liked. They begin to see success and buy other yose. Soon Kitamura Shoten comes to dominate the Osaka vaudeville scene and, on the occasion of the Great Kanto Earthquake extends its reach to Tokyo. Toki and F≈´ta end up marrying. T≈çkichi, however, suffers a series of strokes. Fearing his death and hoping to leave a healthy business to Ten, he encourages his old vaudeville buddies Keith, Asari, and Manj≈çme to come up with a modern form of \\"talking\\" manzai, which becomes a huge hit. T≈çkichi dies, leaving Ten to run a major business that is still threatened by new entertainments like the talkies. She brings in an old friend, Shiori In≈ç, who runs a movie studio, as an advisor, and he suggests she develop an entertainment only a woman could produce. Ten asks him to lend her Ririko, her former rival in love over T≈çkichi, who is now a major movie star, and creates a new form \\"non-talking\\" manzai, with Ririko doing all the talking against her bumbling accordionist partner Shir≈ç. The two eventually fall in love. Ten's son Shun'ya, being groomed to take over one day, proposes to put on a real American revue show, The Martin Show, that he saw in America. When he loses a bundle to a con man pretending to be the agent for the Martin Show, Shun'ya is punished, but he has fallen in love with Tsubaki, a woman who was an unwitting participant in the Martin Show affair. Her father, the president of the bank that provided loans to Kitamura Shoten, demands she marry the son of a business partner but she refuses and runs away, with Shun'ya following. Ten is forced to disown him. As the clouds of war approach, Kitamura Shoten is asked to send comedians to the front to entertain soldiers. The company also tries to enter the movie business, but when they try to bring in In≈ç as an advisor, after he was driven out of his own company due to his liberal world view, censors punish them and In≈ç has to leave for America. Shun'ya and many Kitamura comedians are drafted into the military, and air raids destroy many of Ten's theaters. She dissolves the company and escapes to the countryside until the end of the war. Returning to a burnt-out Osaka, Ten works with F≈´ta and In≈ç, newly returned from America, to rebuild Kitamura Sh≈çten with a new comedy show.

They had a flat bottom and the sides sloped only slight outwards. P√ºnten were often fitted with a sail, although this was usually insufficient for propulsion, so that the boat was mostly hauled as well.

It encompasses the Bogor Botanical Gardens and Istana, plus a bustling urban area to the west between the Gardens and the river. Bogor Paledang railway station serves the Bogor-Sukabumi route. Because Paledang includes a busy area along the west boundary of the Bogor Botanical Garden and Istana, it has been proposed that this could act as a \\"buffer zone\\" between the Botanical Garden and the rest of the city of Bogor. The area includes shops, businesses, offices and several places of worship including the Roman Catholic Cathedral (BMV Katedral Bogor), the Batak Christian Protestant Church (Gereja HKBP Paledang Bogor) and several mosques including the Masjid At- Taufiq. An innovative education programme was introduced in the Lembaga Pemasyrakatan (prison) in Paledang to address the economic and health problems that prisoners face after release, due to poverty and unemployment because of prejudice. The programme teaches about personal and family health, and tackles the inaccessibility of expensive medicines by encouraging the use of medicinal plants that can be grown at home in pots.

Founded by James Edward Sugden in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire in 1967, the company is best known as the manufacturer of the Sugden A21 amplifier. Sugden had been involved in the manufacture of scientific equipment since 1960 with his company Research Electronics. Sugden was keenly interested in hi-fi, in particular in overcoming the problem of crossover distortion common in Class B designs at the time. He developed a Class A solid state amplifier, the Si 402, which avoided this, however it was extremely expensive, costing 100 Guineas (¬£105) at the time and few if any were sold. Sugden was the first company to use the Class A design in their amplifiers. The following year Sugden agreed to work with local loudspeaker manufacture Richard Allan, who were a company who manufactured loudspeakers. They would market his amplifiers under their brand name. In April 1968 the A21 amplifier was premiered at an audio fair in London. It would sell for a much more attractive ¬£52 and received good reviews in the audio press. Shortly after they set up a factory at Carr Street in Cleckheaton in West Yorkshire and started producing the A21 amplifier under their own name. They subsequently expanded their range of products to include other amplifiers and tuners. In 1981 they relocated to Valley Road in Heckmondwike where they remain.

In 1966 the Albanian Communist Party issued a decree aimed to wipe out \\"traces of the non-Albanian population\\" in places where significant Slavic minorities still lived. In 1968 one of the demands of Albanian nationalistic demonstration on Kosovo was to remove Serbian Orthodox name Metohija from the name of the province. In 1975 the Albanian Communist Party issued a decree on the Albanization of all place-names and personal names which ordered citizens to give \\"modern revolutionary (Illyrian) names\\" to their children, while non- Albanian toponyms or ones that had religious connotations all over the country were Albanized to better suit the \\"state ideology\\". After the Kosovo War and the entrance of the NATO forces to Kosovo in June 1999 a sweeping Albanization of place-names, organizations, street-names and business took place. In 2005 a special envoy of UN Secretary-General, issued a report submitted to the UN Security Council inviting the Kosovo Albanian leaders to react and bring a halt to the attempts to rewrite the history through \\"albanization\\". The politicians in contemporary Albania continued to support the politics of Albanization, particularly Albanization of Slavic toponyms.  In Albania  Soon after the Second World War substantial Greek population in the southern Albania and other people of non-Albanian ethnicity were required to Albanize their names. The Central Committee of the Albanian Communist Party issued two decrees which Albanized place-names and personal names. The first decree was issued in 1966 aimed to wipe out \\"traces of the non-Albanian population\\" in places where significant Slavic minorities still lived. The 1966 Albanisation of names included personal names of ethnic Macedonians and names of the villages where they lived in compact communities. A Decree on the Albanization of all place-names and personal names was also issued at 7th congress of the Communist Party held in period 26‚Äî29 May 1975. The decree referred to all names which are not aligned with ideological and political guideline of the Communist Party. This decree ordered citizens to give \\"modern revolutionary (Illyrian) names\\" to their children. Tzachristos argues that Christian names were overwhelmingly affected while on the other hand, the use of several Muslim names was allowed in spite their religious connotations. However, French anthropologist Gilles de Rapper states that according to some observations the religious names survived better among Christians than among Muslims.. Page 42: \\"Finally, other observations seem to support the idea of the relatively privileged position of Christians during communism: for instance, and as far as I could determine, the destruction of places of cult in 1967 and afterwards seems to have been more systematic in the case of Muslim places, while Christian places (although closed as cult places and dedicated to secular usage) have more often been spared as ‚Äòcultural monuments‚Äô [41] (monument kulture). Also, as far as I could determine, religious first names, formally forbidden in 1976, seem to have survived better among Christians than among Muslims. They seem to have reappeared more easily after 1990, for newborn children as well as for children and adults who got baptised when religious practices were authorised again. Muslim names, on the contrary, do not seem to have regained favour. \\" Under the same decree geographical name changes occurred all over the country in cases of non- Albanian toponyms or ones that had religious connotations. As a result, names of 13 settlements in Kor√ß√´ and 6 in Sarand√´ regions were changed in order to be in agreement with the \\"state ideology\\". Moreover, the names of Greek and Roman archaeological sites were changed to \\"Illyrian\\". A ban of religious names had deleterious consequences on people of Greek ethnicity who traditionally give religious names to their children. In case of substantial Serb community in northern Albania (Shkod√´r), their family names had been Albanized during dictatorship of Enver Hoxha. The desire of the Greek minority's representatives to be able to use bilingual signposts and signs within municipalities is based on their need for recognition of Greek culture and, more importantly, a fear of its erosion. The December 2007 lawsuit against Omonoia President Vasil Bolano for replacing signs in Albanian with signs in Greek in the municipality of Himara illustrates the issues surrounding toponymy and its symbolic meaning. The situation was the exact counterpoint to the measures of Albanisation of toponyms operated by the communist regime. The politicians in contemporary Albania continued to support the politics of Albanization, particularly Albanization of Slavic toponyms. In 2009 Albanian president Bamir Topi and Prime Minister Sali Berisha proposed establishment of the commission for Albanization of Slavic toponomy. Berisha actually supports Albanization of not only Slavic toponyms but all placenames in Albania. In spite of his proposal, there are no similarly strong attempts to Albanize Latin, Turkish or Greek place names for the time being.  In Kosovo  During the widespread demonstrations in Pri≈°tina and several other towns on Kosovo in 1968, the Albanian nationalists demanded a change of name of the Serbia's province Kosovo and Metohija to Kosovo. They considered an Orthodox name of Metohija as provocative. Their demands were met and less than a month after demonstrations Yugoslav Federal Parliament removed Serbian name Metohija from the official name of the province. After the Kosovo War and entrance of the NATO forces to Kosovo in June 1999 a sweeping Albanization of place-names, organizations, street-names and business took place. In some cases newly forged placenames (i.e. Burim, Besiana or Theranda) are not accepted instead of traditional names. In 2003 UN Secretary-General reported that names of many non-Albanians were \\"Albanized\\" in official documents which include their identity cards. In the same report it is indicated that after becoming award of this activities in some cases UNMIK reissued documents with correct spelling of the name. The Minister for Kosovo in the Government of Serbia informed EULEX that the practice of Albanization of names of Serbs is unacceptable. In 2005 Kai Eide, a special envoy of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, issued a report which was later submitted to the UN Security Council. In this report the Kosovo Albanian leaders are invited to react and bring a halt to the attempts to rewrite the history through \\"albanization\\". Assembly of Kosovo adopted a Law on the Use of Languages which stipulated that non- Albanians have the right to receive all information, documents and other services in any of the Kosovo‚Äôs official languages. It was reported by UNHCR that Kosovo‚Äôs public companies do not respect this law when it comes to their non-Albanian customers, particularly Serbs, whose names are changed to Albanized versions with \\"√ß\\". There is a common practice reported by Ombusdperson institution in 2008 which has serious long-term consequences when municipalities don't respect names in the Serbian, Bosniak and Turkish languages of newborn babies when they are recorded in the registry books.  In Macedonia  During Second World War western part of Macedonia was annexed into fascist Albania. All Macedonian schools were replaced with Albanian while names and surnames of non-Albanian people had to take an Albanian form.

The current commander has been Colonel Giovanni Mario Occhioni since 11 September 2017.  History  Carabinieri during riot control in 2015 Carabinieri Battalions, as a whole, can track their origins to 1920, when Carabinieri Mobile Battalions were formed. The first formation grouping all Carabinieri units tasked with mobile, riot control and combat duties was established as the 11th Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade, in 1963.  1963-2001: 11th Carabinieri Brigade  In 1963, with the 1960s Army and Carabinieri reorganization, the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade was established directly under the General Command, in order to cope with the internal territorial defence needs. The establishment of the new Brigade was in order to adjust the organization of the Battalions and of cavalry units both for strictly military tasks, and those related to the protection of public order. The aim was to ensure Carabinieri Battalions the availability of all elements necessary to be in a position to act in isolation and overcome considerable resistance without having to rely on the competition of other Army Corps or other Armed Forces, to ensure Battalions speed of movement and concentration in large sectors of foreseeable use and a constant high training level. The establishment of the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade was decided also due to the wider Italian Army needs to have only one point of contact to deal with equipment, training and readiness of Carabinier Battalions, framed within military defence system. In the reorganization, former Mobile Battalions were renamed simply Battalions and were marked with a sequential number, while remaining administratively dependent on the relevant territorial Legion; the Battalions Groups were renamed Carabinieri Regiments, and were given the conceptual role of a resolution unit in both riot and tactical tasks. The newly formed Mechanized Brigade exercised its operational and training authority on: * 1st Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Milan): commanding I, II, III and IV Battalions; * 2nd Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Rome): commanding V, VI, VIII and IX Battalions; * 3rd Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Naples): commanding X, XI and XII Battalions; * 4th Mounted Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Rome) with 2 Squadrons Groups (Battalion- level units) and 1 Armoured-motorized Squadron; * VII Battalion (directly under the Brigade Command), under IV Army Corps; despite being the newest Battalion, the unit inherited traditions and number of the second battalion of Rome, which was disestablished. * XIII Battalion (directly under the Brigade Command), under V Army Corps. The command structure of the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade consisted of: * Staff, with personnel management and training bodies; * Services Office, with activation and research tasks; * Army officers of Transmissions and Motorization organizations, with management, technical, inspecting and consulting tasks. The XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade did not exercise operational command tasks, but it did exercise training and readiness duties. Each Carabinieri Battalion was led by a Lieutenant Colonel or a Major and consisted of: 1 Command Company (1 Command Platoon, 1 Services Platoon, 1 Scouts Platoon), 2 Rifle Companies (command platoon, 3 rifle platoons, 1 company weapons platoon each), 1 Mortars Company and 1 Tanks Company (Command Platoon, 3 Tanks Platoons). It was therefore a robust tactical complex. The Carabinieri Battalions had to be used only when the police and the local organization of the Carabinieri they had found insufficient, in order not to deprive the General Command of a valuable combat tool. Overall, Carabinieri Battalions were divided into two groups, according to the main type (motorized or mechanized unit) of unit the unit deployed. Between 1967 and 1968 it was set up the Inspectorate of Mechanized and Training Units (led by a Divisional general), with responsibility on the X Carabinieri Brigade (including schools) and XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade. In 1971 it was established the Inspectorate Schools and Special Carabinieri Units; it controlled the X Brigade (dedicated to training) and XI Brigade. In 1969, Battalions framed within Carabinieri Regiments were reorganized. The new structure consisted of Battalion Command Unit, Command and Services Company (Command and Services Platoon, Scouts Platoon, Transmissions Platoon, Tanks Platoon, Transportations Platoon), 2 Mechanized Rifle Companies (Command and Services Platoon, 3 Rifle Platoons, Mortars Platoons). In 1970, a \\"Rescue Unit\\" is established within each Carabinieri Battalion.p.204 Between 1973 and 1976, the 5th Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Mestre) also existed, including IV, VII and XIII Battalions. In 1975 the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade changed its name in 11th Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade (with Arabic numerals) and in 1976 the formation was renamed 11th Carabinieri Brigade; at the same time, the Brigade Command was tasked to exercise only training and logistical authority. On 1 September 1977, 1st, 2nd and 3rd Carabinieri Regiments were disestablished and their Battalions, including the Battalion based in Mestre, were transferred under the direct operational and training authority of the 11th Mechanized Brigade. On 30 November 1977, the 4th Carabinieri Battalion \\"Veneto\\" was granted the War Flag. With the end of the Cold War, the mobile organization lost its combat-oriented connotation, taking over the role of force mainly devoted to the performance of riot control. The 1st Carabinieri Group in Milan and the 2nd Carabinieri Group in Rome were established in the 1990s within the 11th Brigade; these units were renamed, in 1995, respectively Carabinieri Regiment in Milan and Carabinieri Regiment in Rome. = Operations = In the 1976 Friuli earthquake, the XIII Carabinieri Battalion \\"Friuli Venezia Giulia\\", IV Carabinieri Battalion \\"Veneto\\" and VII Carabinieri Battalion \\"Trentino Alto Adige\\" intervened paying rescue and providing police and utility services. In the 1980 Irpinia earthquake Carabinieri Battalions from Bari, Naples and Rome also intervened.pp. 203‚Äì204  2001-present day: 1st Carabinieri Mobile Brigade  With the transformation of the Arma dei Carabinieri in autonomous Armed Force, the 11th Carabinieri Brigade was split in two Brigades: the 1st Carabinieri Mobile Brigade controlled riot units, the 2nd Carabinieri Mobile Brigade was assigned combat-oriented Carabinieri Regiments. The two Carabinieri Mobile Brigades were grouped in the Carabinieri Mobile Units Division. The 1st Carabinieri Mobile Brigade was initially headquartered in Rome; in 2001 it was transferred in Treviso; in 2013 it was moved back in Rome.

Career Scappucci worked as a r√©p√©titeur and rehearsal pianist for such opera companies as New York City Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago and Santa Fe Opera, the Music Academy of the West, Glyndebourne Festival Opera (six summer seasons), the Metropolitan Opera, and the Vienna State Opera. She also was an assistant to Riccardo Muti over the course of 8 years at the Salzburg Festival, including work as a harpsichord player, in addition to coaching singers and rehearsing choruses from the piano. Scappucci counts Muti as one of her principal influences and mentors. Her career transitioned into conducting over the course of her work as a r√©p√©titeur, without formal academic instruction in conducting. In 2012, Scappucci made her public opera conducting debut with Yale Opera at the Yale School of Music, with Cos√¨ fan tutte, her first ever public engagement as an opera conductor, and the first female conductor ever to conduct a Yale Opera production. She returned to Juilliard for her New York City debut as an opera conductor in November 2014. Her conducting debut with Santa Fe Opera was in July 2015. Outside of the USA, Scappucci made her UK debut as an opera conductor with Scottish Opera in October 2013. At the Vienna State Opera, Scappucci was the fourth-ever female conductor, and the first female Italian conductor, to conduct a production at the Vienna State Opera, for her house debut as conductor in November 2016. In February 2017, she was the first female conductor to direct the orchestra in the annual Vienna Opera Ball, as an emergency substitute for an indisposed Semyon Bychkov. In March 2017, Scappucci made her first appearance with the Op√©ra Royal de Wallonie. Based on her work in this production, in April 2017, the Op√©ra Royal de Wallonie named her its new principal conductor, effective with the 2017-2018 season. This appointment marks her first principal conductorship, and she is the first female conductor to hold this post. Scappucci made her first commercial recording for Warner Classics, of Mozart arias with soprano Marina Rebeka.

EWM was located in an embayment off Natal, South Africa, before the break-up of Gondwana during which it was rotated 90¬∞ anticlockwise. The EWM is named for the Ellsworth and Whitmore mountain ranges. The EWM was deformed during Gondwanan Late Permian‚ÄìLate Jurassic orogenic events and is underlain by Grenvillan crust that much older than the amalgamation of Gondwana. A 90¬∞ anticlockwise rotation of the EWM during the Gondwana break-up is supported by palaeomagnetic data from several primary remanences: the Late Cambrian Frazier Ridge Formation and the Nash Hills. The origin of the crustal blocks of West Antarctica and Zealandia remained enigmatic for decades largely because of their locations on the Pacific margin of Gondwana from where they were transported large distances. The EWM formed part of Gondwana's southern margin, Earth's longest and most long-lived active margin. Stretching from South America over South Africa, West Antarctica, Victoria Land, New Zealand, and Eastern Australia, this margin was the location of the -long Terra Australis orogeny that began during the Neoproterozoic break-up of Rodinia and culminated in the closure of the Adamastor and Mozambique oceans.

Early life Annie was born in 1832 in New York City. She was the daughter of Catharine Leary (1803‚Äì1879) and James Leary (1792‚Äì1862), a hatter who was a childhood friend of William Backhouse Astor Sr. James later bought many beaver pelts from William's father, John Jacob Astor, and operated a shop in the basement of the original Astor House Hotel across from New York City Hall. She had three brothers Arthur, Daniel, and George who made a fortune in shipping during the U.S. Civil War. Arthur was a bachelor who Annie accompanied to society functions in New York City as well as Newport, Rhode Island. It has been suggested that James friendship with the Astors is what led to Arthur, and in turn Annie, being the only Catholics to be included on Mrs. Astor's \\"The 400\\". When Arthur died she inherited his fortune as well as his social prominence. Her maternal ancestors were Dutch immigrants and her paternal grandfather came from Ireland to the United States while he was a boy. Philanthropy After inheriting vast wealth, Annie Leary soon became an ardent philanthropist. Among her first projects was a predominantly Italian church in the Sullivan Street neighborhood where she taught a sewing class and increased the size of the congregation. She gave altars to a large number of churches, both in the United States and abroad. She built and outfitted several churches and brought an order of priests (the Order of the Fathers of the Blessed Sacrament) to the St. Jean Baptiste Church, and an order of sisters (the Sisters of the Order of the Reparation) to the U.S. to carry out her work. She also donated the statue of Christopher Columbus in Columbus Circle. Among her notable bequests was $1,000,000 for the construction of the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament at Bellevue Hospital, the first Catholic chapel at Bellevue, which was donated in 1893 and dedicated in memory of her late brother Arthur in 1897. The Chapel was razed 1938 in order to make way for a Bellevue administration building which encompassed a new chapel where the original stained glass panels including nine made in Munich remain today. In 1903, Pope Leo XIII created her a Papal Countess, the first such title to have been bestowed upon a woman in the United States. Personal life Her closest friend was the businesswoman and financier Hetty Green, who was known as \\"the richest woman in America\\" during the Gilded Age. Leary, who did not marry, died at her home, 1032 Fifth Avenue in New York City, on April 26, 1919. Her funeral was held at St. Ignatius Loyola Church on East 84th Street and Park Avenue. Estate In her will, she allotted $200,000 to the Archbishop of New York for the erection of a sacristy for New York City's new St. Patrick's Cathedral as well as a vault for eight (the Countess and her family) to be placed beneath the altar. It turned out however that the management of her will was delegated to a niece of hers who was not fond of the departed philanthropist and the money was never given to the aforementioned clergyman. Legal action therefore followed, and by the time the will was resolved in 1926 there was no money left to pay for the vault. Subsequently, the Countess's final resting place is in the catacombs of the Old St. Patrick's Cathedral.

She played for Charleston Southern and Quincy University before making a name for herself in Australia with the Lakeside Lightning in the State Basketball League (SBL) and the Perth Lynx in the WNBL. With the Lightning, she won a championship and three consecutive WSBL Most Valuable Player awards. High school career Schwagmeyer attended Central High School in Camp Point, Illinois. She earned four varsity letters in basketball and holds school career records for points (1,950) and steals (500). She was a two-time all- state selection for basketball and was the Herald-Whig Player of the Year in volleyball in 2007. College career As a freshman at Charleston Southern in 2008‚Äì09, Schwagmeyer averaged 8.5 points and 6.8 rebounds per game and earned Big South All-Freshman Team honors. She went on to average 6.9 points and 7.6 rebounds per game as a sophomore. In 2010, Schwagmeyer transferred to Quincy University, where as a junior in 2010‚Äì11, she was named GLVC Player of the Year. She also earned GLVC First Team All-Conference honors and was named Daktronics First Team All-Region. In 28 games, she made 27 starts and averaged 17.6 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. In 27 games for Quincy as a senior in 2011‚Äì12, Schwagmeyer made 26 starts and averaged 18.0 points, 7.9 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.0 steals per game. She subsequently earned first-team All- GLVC honors for the second year in a row. Professional career Germany (2012‚Äì2014) In July 2012, Schwagmeyer signed with the GiroLive Panthers in Osnabr√ºck, Germany, a team playing in the Damen-Basketball-Bundesliga. In 30 games in 2012‚Äì13, she averaged 14.0 points, 8.1 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game. Following the 2012‚Äì13 season, Schwagmeyer returned to the United States and played in a semi-pro league in St. Louis. In the last game, she tore some ligaments in her ankle. She had signed to play in Romania, but that didn't work out. As a result, the GiroLive Panthers heard she was injured and didn't go to Romania, so they called and offered her to come back for a second season. In November 2013, the two parties agreed that Schwagmeyer would re- join the Panthers in January 2014. In 11 games to round out the 2013‚Äì14 season, she averaged 15.2 points, 8.1 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 2.0 steals per game. Kalamunda Eastern Suns (2014) In April 2014, Schwagmeyer moved to Australia to play for the Kalamunda Eastern Suns of the State Basketball League. She made her debut for the Suns in Round 7 of the 2014 season on April 25, recording 14 points, five rebounds, four assists and three steals in an 80‚Äì52 win over the Willetton Tigers. In her second game a day later, she had 21 points, nine rebounds and six assists in a 76‚Äì75 loss to the Mandurah Magic. Following Round 15, she was named Player of the Week for her back-to- back 20-point games. Schwagmeyer averaged 19.1 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 2.4 steals per game for the Suns in 2014, earning All-Star Five honors. Career in limbo Following the 2014 SBL season, Schwagmeyer moved to Romania to play for CSBT Alexandria, the same team she was supposed to play for in 2013. She played just one game for Alexandria, scoring 30 points in 20 minutes, before accepting an offer from a first division team in Spain. She joined Cad√≠ La Seu D'urgell, but she left the team in December after tragedy struck. During the team's Christmas break, she travelled to Germany to spend time with her boyfriend, fellow basketball player Courtney Belger. Upon arriving in Germany, she learned her sister, Angie, had been killed in a car crash in St. Louis. She immediately returned home to be with her family and subsequently put her basketball career on hold. At the time, she wasn't sure if she was going to play again, and over the ensuing year, she served as an assistant coach for the Hannibal‚ÄìLaGrange University women's basketball team while also working at the Quincy YMCA. In November 2015, Schwagmeyer's coach at the Kalamunda Eastern Suns in 2014, Craig Mansfield, contacted her after he was appointed coach at the Lakeside Lightning. He asked her to join him at Lakeside, and after taking some time to think about it, she decided she wanted to try to start her career again. Lakeside Lightning (2016‚Äì2019) On March 1, 2016, Schwagmeyer left the U.S. to return to Perth, Western Australia, to once again play in the State Basketball League (SBL), this time for the Lakeside Lightning. She played through injury most of her first season with Lakeside. Despite this, she still produced standout performances, and with 20.6 points, 6.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.5 steals per game in 23 contests, she was named the WSBL's Most Valuable Player for the 2016 season. Schwagmeyer returned to the Lightning in 2017 as co-captain. She helped the Lightning improve from 11‚Äì11 to 17‚Äì5; played for the South All-Stars in the WSBL All-Star Game; won five Player of the Week awards; and won her second straight WSBL MVP award to go with All-Star Five and All-Defensive Five honors. In 27 games, she averaged 21.9 points, 8.4 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game. Schwagmeyer returned to the Lightning in 2018 for a third season. She won Player of the Week for rounds 5 and 10. She played for the South All- Stars in the WSBL All-Star Game and helped them win 103‚Äì76 behind her MVP performance. She helped the Lightning win the minor premiership with a first- place finish and a 21‚Äì1 record before leading them through to the WSBL Grand Final, where they defeated the Mandurah Magic 75‚Äì64 behind a 25-point performance from Schwagmeyer that garnered her Grand Final MVP honors. To conclude the year, she was named league MVP for the third straight year to go with All-Star Five honors. In 24 games, she averaged 22.4 points, 7.5 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game. Schwagmeyer returned to the Lightning in 2019, but only for the first seven rounds. Perth Lynx (2017‚Äì2020) Schwagmeyer signing autographs in October 2017 Following the 2017 SBL season, Schwagmeyer joined the Perth Lynx of the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) as a training player for the 2017‚Äì18 season, having spent time training with the team throughout the 2016‚Äì17 season also. Perth had now become her second home, and thus applied to become a permanent resident in Australia. The Lynx promised her a position on the squad upon the approval of the application, but such applications take time. Her chance at playing in the top-tier league in Australia came in late October when import guard Courtney Williams was sidelined for three games with a shoulder injury. The Lynx applied for Schwagmeyer to replace Williams as short-term injury cover, but the relevant visa paperwork took a week to be processed, and it wasn't until the final shoot-around prior to their home game on October 27 that the team received the clearance. She stepped straight into the starting five and had a big impact with her defensive energy against the Dandenong Rangers. She finished with 10 points in the 88‚Äì78 win, including seven consecutive points from late in the third quarter to early in the final period. Delays in her permanent residency application saw Schwagmeyer watch from the sidelines for the remainder of the season. The Lynx went on to finish as minor premiers with a 15‚Äì6 record, before losing to the Melbourne Boomers in the semi-finals. At the Lynx Awards Night, Schwagmeyer was named the recipient of the Coaches' Award. Having received her residency in February 2018, Schwagmeyer signed a full-time contract with the Lynx as an unrestricted player on June 14, 2018, rejecting European contracts and the chance to be closer to her partner to play in the WNBL. She averaged 14 points, 4.59 rebounds, 1.95 assists and 1.14 steals in the 2018‚Äì19 season, and was selected in the WNBL Team of the Week in round eight. Round eight featured her best game of the season, with 22 points, five rebounds, three assists, and two steals in a four-point win over the UC Capitals. On April 6, 2019, Schwagmeyer re-signed with the Lynx for the 2019‚Äì20 season. She took a different approach to training in the off-season, shedding 10kg to enter her second full season with the Lynx looking to play lighter. She missed the last three games of the season with a right foot injury. For the season, she earned WNBL Sixth Woman of the Year honors after averaging 15.3 points, 5.6 rebounds and 1.9 assists per game with predominately a bench role. Sydney Uni Flames (2020‚Äìpresent) On July 1, 2020, Schwagmeyer signed with the Sydney Uni Flames for the 2020‚Äì21 WNBL season. Personal Schwagmeyer is the daughter of Mike and Sherry Schwagmeyer. She has one brother, Corey, and three sisters, Lori, Kim and Angie (deceased). In July 2019, Schwagmeyer married long-time boyfriend and fellow basketball player Courtney Belger. He too has played in Germany and in the State Basketball League.

He obtained a B.A. from the University of California, Los Angeles, an M.A. in pharmacy from the University of California, San Francisco, and an M.D. from the UCSF School of Medicine in 1933. As a student, he worked with Gordon Alles and Chauncey D. Leake on the synthesis of amphetamine. Career Prinzmetal completed his medical internship in San Francisco and relocated to St. Louis for his residency at Barnes Hospital. In 1935, he became a fellow at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. This was followed by a fellowship at University College London, where he worked with George Pickering on research into the hormone renin, and another fellowship at the University of Southern California. He returned to Los Angeles in 1938 to take up a research position at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, while also running a private practice. Prinzmetal authored at least 165 publications over the course of his career.

Career Dodd taught initially at several schools, and from 1892 at Owens College, part of Victoria University of Manchester, as \\"first mistress of method\\". This made her the first female member of the university's staff.Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy: The Feminist Companion to Literature in English (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 300. A student of hers at the time recalled, \\"She made us enthusiastic about our profession, giving us ideals to strive for, and above all others, deserves the title of pioneer.\\"Edith Caroline Wilson: Catherine Isabella Dodd, 1860‚Äì1932: a memorial sketch (London: Sidgwick & Jackson, 1936), p. 42. Quoted in ODNB. A colleague of hers at Owens College, Samuel Alexander, interviewed much later, said Dodd had \\"swept her students into the whirlwind of her own energy and enthusiasm and faith in the value of pedagogy.\\"Manchester Guardian, 17 November 1932. Quoted in ODNB. In 1903, Dodd founded privately in Manchester the experimental College House School, based on Froebel principles, which also embraced ideas from the German educational philosopher Johann Friedrich Herbart (1776‚Äì1841). Her publications in that period included Introduction to the Herbartian Principles of Teaching (1898), which remains in print, Hungarian Education (1902), Fairy Tales for Infant Schools and Infant Classes (1904), and The Child and the Curriculum (1906), also still in print.Titles checked at The Book Depository Retrieved 18 November 2017. She pioneered the use of school travel as an educational tool. Dodd moved in 1906 to be Principal of Cherwell Hall teacher training college in Oxford, from where she retired in 1920. Novelist Retirement in Dodd's case meant a new career as a novelist. Basing herself in London, she wrote twelve novels, starting from A Vagrant Englishwoman (1905) and finishing with Paul and Perdita (1932). These mingled mysticism with idealization of the historical past. They reflect something of a shift from the Fabian and feminist ideas of her younger days to a more conservative outlook. She also wrote a biography of Mary Shelley, entitled Eagle Feather (1933). Endowment Catherine Dodd remained unmarried. She died in London on 13 November 1932 and was buried in Marylebone Cemetery. She had in 1931 endowed a fellowship at the University of Manchester and left bequests to several literary organizations in her will. References External links *A. Robertson: \\"Catherine I.

Founded in 1973, the International Crane Foundation is headquartered in Baraboo, Wisconsin on a 250-acre property that includes live crane exhibits with 15 crane species, a visitor center, breeding facilities, a research library and nature trails. The foundation works worldwide and in the US with local partners to raise and conserve cranes. The Foundation maintains a regional base in China and shares program offices with partner organizations in Cambodia, India, South Africa, Texas, Vietnam, and Zambia. The International Crane Foundation's approximately 80 staff work with a network of hundreds of specialists in over 50 countries on five continents. History The International Crane Foundation was founded in 1973 by two ornithology students at Cornell University, Ron Sauey and George W. Archibald, who envisioned an organization that would combine research, captive breeding and reintroduction, landscape restoration, and education to safeguard the world's 15 crane species. In 1973, the Sauey family rented their horse farm to Ron and George for $1 a year to found the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wisconsin. The organization moved to its current location in 1983. Archibald was the organization's director from 1973 to 2000. He pioneered several techniques there to rear cranes in captivity, including the use of crane costumes by human handlers. Archibald spent three years with a highly endangered whooping crane named Tex, acting as a male crane ‚Äì walking, calling, dancing ‚Äì to shift her into reproductive condition. Through his dedication and the use of artificial insemination, Tex eventually laid a fertile egg which hatched a chick named Gee Whiz. The International Crane Foundation's office in Rockport, Texas was demolished in 2017 by Hurricane Harvey, but will be rebuilt. The office was located near the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, an area that sustains the last naturally occurring flock of whooping cranes.

There has been speculation as to why their son Paul was not portrayed and the background to the commission is unclear. Philibert Rivi√®re was likely impressed by the painter's 1804 Bonaparte, First Consul; his own portrait echoes the emperor's pose. Unusually for Ingres, no preparatory drawings are known.

In 1895 she wrote a letter to the editor of the Nevada State Journal: \\"with the ridiculously small State vote, it seems an opportune time to increase the voting population.\\" With her daughter Gertrude, Hazlett compiled a history of Dayton, published by the Nevada Historical Society in 1922 as Historical Sketch and Reminiscenses of Dayton, Nevada, and now available at the Dayton Museum. She was the first vice-president of the Nevada Historical Society. Hazlett was the postmaster of Dayton for twenty years and organized the Helping Hand Library at Dayton. She was one of the oldest women in the world to take a commercial flight in 1922. Personal life Fanny G. Hazlett moved to Nevada in 1862, first settling in Dayton, and later, in 1914, she moved to 701 University Ave., Reno, Nevada. On March 18, 1864 she married Dr. John Clark Hazlett (1828-1895) and had one daughter, Emma Gertrude \\"Gertie\\" Hazlett Randall (1866-1911), who married the sheriff of Lyon County. John C. Hazlett was a practicing doctor, Lyon County Superintendent of Schools, Lyon County's state senator for four years from 1870‚Äì74 and Lyon County District Attorney in 1892.

Transracial people are individuals who assert a racial identity for themselves which differs from their birth race. Examples A well-known example of a self-identified transracial person is Rachel Dolezal, a woman of white ancestry who identifies as black. She successfully passed as black, to the extent that she took over leadership of the Spokane branch of the NAACP in 2014, a year before her \\"outing\\" in 2015. Martina Big, who was featured on Maury in September 2017, is another woman of white ancestry who identifies as black. Big has had tanning injections administered by a physician to darken her skin and hair. Ja Du, a trans woman who was born Caucasian but now considers herself Filipina, created a Facebook page and community for others who self-identify as transracial. Margaret Seltzer, a white suburbanite wrote under the assumed name of Margaret Jones a fictitious memoir about a half-Native American girl raised by a disadvantaged African Americans family. Jessica A. Krug, an associate professor of history and Africana Studies at George Washington University, revealed on September 3, 2020 that she, born to white parents, had been passing as a black woman for her entire professional life. A black teenage woman named Treasure gained national attention when she appeared on Dr. Phil. She claimed that she was white because several of her body parts would resemble a white instead of a black person's. Theoretical approaches In April 2017, the feminist philosophy journal Hypatia published an academic paper in support of recognizing transracialism and drawing parallels between transracial and transgender identity. Publication of this paper resulted in considerable controversy. The subject was also explored in Trans: Gender and Race in an Age of Unsettled Identities, a 2016 book by UCLA sociology professor Rogers Brubaker, who argues that the phenomenon, though offensive to many, is psychologically real to many people, and has many examples throughout history. Controversy over the term Historically, transracial has been used to describe parents who adopt a child of a different race. The use of the term to describe changing racial identity has been criticized by members of the transracial adoption community. Kevin H. Vollmers, executive director of an adoption non-profit, said the term is being \\"appropriated and co-opted\\" and that this is a \\"slap in the face\\" to transracial adoptees. In June 2015, about two dozen transracial adoptees, transracial parents and academics published an open letter in which they condemned the new usage as \\"erroneous, ahistorical, and dangerous.\\"  See also  * Black Like Me * Ethnic plastic surgery * Good hair * Otherkin * Passing (racial identity) * Transabled (body integrity dysphoria) * Transhumanism * Grey Owl, white Englishman who posed as a First Nations man. * Lobsang Rampa  References   Further reading  Cultural assimilation Collective identity Passing (sociology) Race (human categorization) Race and society Subcultures ","title":"Transracial (identity)"},{"id":"55404964","text":"Theresa Rukavina (May 14, 1931 ‚Äì May 10, 2010) was an All-American Girls Professional Baseball League player.

The ISF today counts 41 Member nations. The Federation of Sports at Altitude (FSA) used to be the organization which governed and managed the sports of skyrunning. It has been replaced by the International Skyrunning Federation. Skyrunning  History  There were no traditional roads or asphalt tracks in the olden days . Running in those days involved running on a multitude of terrains, running uphill and downhill. The idea of recognizing this sports discipline led to the creation of The Federation of Sports at Altitude.[1] The Federation of Sports at Altitude was founded by Marino Giancometti who with other fellow climbers conducted high-altitude races across the world's most famous mountain ranges the Himalayas, Rockies, Mount Kenya, and the Mexican Volcanoes.[2]Marino Giancometti conducted skyrunning races as part of the training for high altitude expeditions in 1992.[3] Marino Giancometti formed the Federation of Sports at Altitude (FSA) in 1995.[4] The Federation of Sports at Altitude (FSA) was replaced by the International Sky Running Federation in 2008.[5] Today, this organization holds more than 200 races across the world, with about 50,000 athletes from 65 countries.[6] Marino Giacometti serves as the President of the International Skyrunning Federation Board and the Managing Committee.[7] The federation is also attributed to be the founding organization of the Vertical World Circuit which was formed in 2009. The Vertical World Circuit also is known as Vertical Kilometre World Circuit organizes the vertical kilometre which is a subset of the skyrunning discipline It has the tag line of ‚ÄòLess cloud. More sky‚Äô to inspire its members. It regulates the skyrunning disciplines, which include seven segment that are: SKY, ULTRA and VERTICAL, SKY SPEED, VERTICAL RUNNING, SKYBIKE and SKYRAID. It allows for the training courses that could occur in different environments, like in paths, trail, rocks, or snows. Furthermore, the courses should involve at least 12% of the uphill regions and 6% inclines, but the total altitude should not over 2.000 m. Furthermore, IFS regulates that the total distance should involve no more than 15% of the asphalt.  Aims and Objectives of the Organisation  The Federation is responsible for the following objectives:[9] * To frame rules and ensure that it is followed in competitions in accordance with the principles laid down in the statutes and regulations. * To frame and ensure that the rules are followed in the international competitions and the participation in such competitions is in accordance to the regulations. * To be responsible for determining which international competitions can be officially approved and recognized. * To be responsible for promotion and control of good sporting practices. * To prevent doping and any other practices which go against the IOC Medical code and regulations on doping. * To develop the sports to attain Olympic recognition status. * To ensure that skyrunning values are maintained. * To ensure that the rules of the local skyrunning races are in congruence with the ISFs rules. * To coordinate the calendar of events.  Skyrunning  Skyrunning is a subset of mountain running. Skyrunning is defined as running in mountains which are above 2,000 meters in altitude with an incline over 30% and the difficulty of climbing is not more than II¬∞ grade.[10] Skyrunning is a relatively new sport. Despite its newness, this sport has been gaining interest in more than 65 countries.[11] In the early years of the sports, the sport was simple which included running up and down the mountain as fast as possible but, since it gained attention, the sport has become more extreme with events like the Tromso Skyrace which was held for the first time in 2014 as a result of which it is being called extreme sports.[12] The seven disciplines of skyrunning are sky, ultra, vertical, skyspeed, skyscraper racing/vertical running, skybike, and skyraid; each of these disciplines vary in distance and altitude.[13] Skyrunning is also of a shorter duration compared to ultrarunning, sometimes shorter than a half marathon.[14] The major factor which differentiates skyrunning from other kinds of running is the altitude. The mountain terrain, elevation and distance are the other defining features of skyrunning.[15] Skyrunning is also held indoors using stairs with an incline of over 45% and the International Skyrunning Federation is working on an IOC recognition to the indoor skyscraper racing. Vertical races serve as a special type of skyrunning that include indoor activities. It requires on the over 45% inclines. It provide good environment for specialists to measure the impacts of skyrunning and conduct easy observation. Skyrunning is quite popular in the global domainn. Races for skyrunning have been accept by 36 countries worldwide, and the number of skyrunners reaches 600,000 in the global domain. In particular, there are 75,000 entrants in the 2015. Currently, this sports activity is still male dominant in the global domain, with 80% of the skyrunners being males. However, the ages are quite diverse, ranging from 18 to 83 years old. However, most of the runners are between the age of 25 and 44. The top three countries with the highest number of skyrunners are Europe, the United States, and Japan. IFS initiates 2019 Skyrunning North American Championship with its SKY discipline, which is a strong milestone for this institution. It will work with two local residents, Matt Carpenter and Nancy Hobbs. The former is the skyrunning legend in the United States, while the latter is the direct of American Trail Running Association. The two local residents have started the local championship since 2011, attracting over 300 participants each year from Europe and North America. Thus, working with them is a good way for IFS to build its international reputation and develop impact in the United States.  Skyrunning for New Learners  Skyrunning could be undertaken by anyone who can run and show interests. Although it requires the skills and nerves, one could start with some places that could allow for trainings. For those who expect to have mountain adventures, the choice for starting an intensive course might be a starting point. The places selected should consider the heights and also weather matters since it will affect the duration, the time, and risks for skyrunning. Besides, develop the skills of map checking is essential, as those training courses cannot support for this kill. Usually, runners should try for local navigation camp and orienteering club that would allow them to learn from experts. To prepare for skyrunninng, one should at least involve a pair of outsole which can resist wet soils and hard rocks and have the right size to make the food comfort during the long journey. Furthermore, a backpack might be useful to prepare some simple food, water, and other relevant stuff like windproof jacket with taped seams and trousers, a rescue blanket, a phone, a hat, as well as gloves. Skyrunning also calls for some techniques. Although those experienced runners usually have faster speed and stronger duration, they are quite wise in controlling the speed and be careful in developing the strategy for their speeds. For instance, experience runners intend to be slower in uphill trails, but faster in downhill trails. They usually develop specific gestures to make the move more flexible and cost less energy. The upper bodies are usually relaxed to maintain balance, and repeated practices are required for one to develop strong skills for skyrunning. World Championships of IFS World Championships The world championships of the skyrunning are biannually skyrunning competitions (only the 2nd edition was held after 4 years), organised for the first time in 2010 by ISF. The Federation conducts Skyrunner World Series every year. The 2018 World Series was held in Kinlochleven, Scotland from 13‚Äì15 September 2018. The races were judged on vertical, ultra and sky criterion. The International Skyrunning Federation has recently introduced National Series and Continental Championships. In 2016, the Youth Skyrunning World Championships were introduced.[17]In 2018, 18 countries participated in the Youth Skyrunning World Championship and eleven countries won medals.[18] The 2019 Youth Skyrunning World Championships will be held on 2 and 4 August 2019 in Italy.[19] In 2004, the Migu Run Skyrunner was introduced. The 2019 Migu Run Skyrunner World Series will be held across countries like Japan, China, Spain, France, Greece, Italy, Norway, Bulgaria and Andorra from April to October 2019.[20] Apart from these championships, the Federation also conducts the European Championships and the World Series. The federation has taken the sports to new territories and introduced new challenges in the last few years. The federation has recently announced the Skyrunning Continental Championships called as The Skyrunning Oceans Championships which was held at The Buffalo Stampede, Australia in April 2019.[21] Each year, the Federation puts up these events on the calendar of its website attracting people from all over the world.[22]  Scientific Research  The federation has coordinated with Milan University to conduct scientific studies from 2007 to 2010 on Vertical Sprint races in Milan. The findings of the studies have indicated that skyrunning is ideal for weight loss as 80% of the energy consumed diverts the mass upwards and it has ruled out health risks associated with stair climbing. Studies reveal that such enduring and extreme running on mountains also bring the health benefits such as low energy costs for those runners. Although there are individual differences, those frequent mountain running could develop much slower energy cost system that could be 14% lower than average individuals. As a type of mountain race, sky running could allow for the strong development in the physical competence, like the prolonged running time, faster speed, and other competitive aspects that will allow an individuals to improve their ability in cope with dangers and get survival in some extreme situations. The most important changes in the physical status for different types of mountain runners, including sky runners, is the heart rates. Runners intend to develop stronger physical system with the heart rate stable enough to cope with the extreme situations. that could extend runners‚Äô adaptation to the competition intensity of the races. Heart can be strengthened with improvement in cardiac biomarkers, electro- and echocardiography. Another discovery is that skyrunning will challenge people's physical status for long duration and distance and professional skyrunners usually develop low body mass index and low body fat. Although there are gender differences in the improvement in physical status with women is less strong than male in those indexes, the gender differences are narrowing for those men and women who have participated in those long-distance or long-duration activity. Despite of the healthy benefits, sky running actually face with potential health risks due to its nature of extreme sports. It usually incurs some problems like overuse injuries, which is due to the repetitive activities that lead to the macro- trauma. According to Balendran, S√∏rlie, and Engebretsen (2019), those sky runners usually report high prevalence of overuse injuries. The questionnaire survey indicates 19% of the overuse injuries among the participants, and 8% of substantial overuse injuries. Sometimes without proper protection, runners might face with broken limbs, abrasions, and some contusions. Actually, ISF has listed seven fatalities during the events of skyrunning, which include one head injury, one hypothermia, and five heart failures. Accordingly, it is essential for those runners to conduct some pre-test to ensure that their body could adapt to the extreme sports. Besides, those who have tried the long- duration running usually face with digest problems and they might also suffer more respiratory infections.

As a two-year-old in 1998 he was beaten on his debut but then recorded his biggest success with an emphatic victory in the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes. In the following spring he won the Shergar Cup Sprint but was beaten in his next two races before being exported to South Africa. He won three times in South Africa before being retired to stud but had little success as a breeding stallion. Background Lavery was a bay horse bred in Ireland by the Barronstown Stud, John Horgan and Ron Con Ltd. As a yearling he was consigned to the Tattersalls Houghton Sale where he was bought for 140,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Dermot \\"Demi\\" O'Byrne on behalf of John Magnier's Coolmore organisation. He was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many Coolmore horses the details of the colt's ownership changed from race to race: he was sometimes listed as being owned by Michael Tabor whilst on others occasions he ran for the partnership of Tabor and Susan Magnier. He was from the fifth crop of foals sired by Royal Academy, who won the July Cup and the Breeders' Cup Mile in 1990. At stud, the best of his other winners included Ali-Royal, Bullish Luck, Sleepytime, Val Royal and Oscar Schindler. Lavery's dam Lady Donna showed modest racing ability, winning one minor race as a two-year-old in 1984, but was a half-sister to the 2000 Guineas winner Tirol. Racing career 1998: two-year-old season Lavery made his debut in a maiden race over six furlongs on 12 July at the Curragh in which he was ridden by Christy Roche. Starting at odds of 5/1 he finished sixth of the eleven runners behind the John Oxx-trained filly Takariya. Thirteen days later he was withdrawn at the start of another maiden over five furlongs at the same track after panicking and attempting to break out of the starting stalls. Despite never having won a race the colt was then stepped up to Group 1 class for the Phoenix Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse on 9 August and started at odds of 14/1. The Prix Robert Papin winner Black Amber started joint-favourite alongside Pharmacist (Rochestown Stakes), just ahead of the Marble Hill Stakes winner Access All Areas. Ridden by Walter Swinburn tracked the leaders before taking the lead just inside the final furlong and won in \\"impressive\\" style by one and a half lengths from Access All Areas. After the race Swinburn said \\"Lavery is a fine, big colt who travelled all the way for me, I gave him one smack and he accelerated well\\" whilst Aidan O'Brien commented \\"Lavery has plenty of potential and is engaged in all the major juvenile events around Europe. He got a fright in the stalls at the Curragh, but he had always shown loads of class at home. He has a high cruising speed so I told Walter to take it handy early on. The sky is the limit for this horse\\". In the following month Lavery was sent to England and started 9/4 favourite for the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse. Ridden by Mick Kinane he never looked likely to win and came home fifth of the nine runners behind Auction House. 1999: three-year-old season On 8 May Lavery made his first appearance as a three-year-old at Goodwood Racecourse in the inaugural Shergar Cup, a series of races which pitted European-owned horses against a team representing Middle-Eastern owners. Competing for the European side in the Sprint race, the colt was ridden by Kinane and started at odds of 5/1 in a ten-runner field. After tracking the leaders he went to the front inside the final furlong and drew away to win by two and a half lengths from the Flying Childers Stakes winner Sheer Viking with Pipalong in fourth. Eight days later the colt was sent to France for the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse and finished tenth after fading badly in the closing stages. Lavery then returned to sprinting and was scheduled to compete in the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot but was withdrawn at the start. He returned to action in the July Cup at Newmarket Racecourse on 8 July. Ridden by Willie Supple he started a 20/1 outsider and finished unplaced in a race won by his stablemate Stravinsky. Later career At the end of his 1999 campaign in Europe, Lavery was sent to race in South Africa. He ran sixteen times in South Africa, winning three races and being placed on four occasions. He finished third in the Grade 1 Cape Flying Championship at Kenilworth in January 2001. Stud record After his retirement from racing in 2001, Lavery stood as a breeding stallion in South Africa. He was based at the Summerhill Stud and later moved to the Heversham Park Stud in Gauteng but made little impact as a sire of winners.

He is created by Noah Hawley and portrayed by Jesse Plemons, who was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for this role.  Character overview  Ed is a butcher and the devoted husband of Peggy Blumquist. They live together in their hometown of Luverne, a small city in Minnesota. Ed is perfectly content with their life and believes that he is tracking well, with plans to buy the butcher shop where he works. Peggy, however, is unhappy with their life and feels that it is mundane. These feelings drive her towards psychosis which she displays subtly.  Storyline  On a fateful day in 1979, Ed returns home to his wife making dinner and a noise coming from the garage. He discovers the car's windshield is cracked, and his wife Peggy tells him that she hit a deer on the way home. He then finds a badly injured man, Rye Gerhardt, in the garage. Rye is delirious and attacks him, leading Ed to accidentally kill Rye in self-defense. This is where he gains the first insight into his wife's mental issues. He asks her why, after she hit Rye with her car by accident, had she \\"brought him home, made dinner Hamburger Helper?\\" instead of reporting the incident. Without a sufficient answer, he continues to fulfill the role of the faithful husband and the two begin to plan a cover-up for the accident and disposal of the body. Ed and Peggy decide to crash their car to explain the damage to the car and have Ed dispose of the body after hours at the butcher shop. Sheriff Deputy Lou Solverson walks in on the body grinding process but he doesn't put together what is going on. Later, when Lou begins to put the incident together, he goes to visit and question Peggy and Ed. He also informs them that Rye Gerhardt is a member of the Gerhardt family, the most powerful crime syndicate in Fargo, North Dakota. They deny having anything to do with Rye's death and stick to their story despite Lou's offer of police protection. Following this conversation Peggy tries to get Ed to leave town and move to California with her, but Ed refuses to uproot the life that he works so hard for. Ed is informed that the butcher shop is going to be sold to someone else if he doesn't have enough money by the end of the week. Soon after, he is attacked by two members of the Gerhardt family in the shop. He kills one of them with his butcher's cleaver, and the other one, Charlie, is hit by a ricocheted bullet and is badly injured. The shop was set on fire in the fight, and Ed carries injured Charlie out to safety. After making sure that the butcher's assistant can recount the events to the police, Ed rushes home to Peggy. Upon returning home, Peggy informs him that she sold her car so that they can pay for the shop and stay in Luverne. Ed tells her what happened and that there is no more shop. They know they will soon be pursued by the Gerhardts and the police, and opt to make a run for it. Before they can flee, they are confronted by the police. Dodd Gerhardt, a main member of the Gerhardt family interceded before the police take any action. A skirmish ensues resulting in the incapacitation of the present police officers. Peggy is approached by Dodd but she manage to subdue him and takes him captive. Ed seizes this opportunity and devises a plan to trade him for their freedom. Ed and Peggy take refuge in a remote hunting cabin with their captive. After some failed negotiations with the Gerhardts, they set to meet a rival crime family from Kansas City to trade Dodd for a promise of protection and elimination of the Gerhardts. Before the meeting, Ed returns to find Dodd has escaped his binding, and Peggy is lying on the ground, injured. Dodd attacks him and hangs him nearly to death before Peggy manages to save him. Dodd turns towards them again to kill them, but Hanzee, a Gerhardt who was sent to save Dodd but went rogue bursts in and kills him. The police arrive immediately after and Peggy stabs Hanzee in the back as he escapes. The police take the couple into custody. The couple are offered a deal by the South Dakota State Police where they receive reduced jail time and protective custody in their imminent trial. In exchange, Ed must follow through with the Kansas City meeting and wear a wire. While the police are holding the Blumquists in protection at the hotel, the Gerhardts attack, mistakenly thinking that Dodd is being held there. During the shootout, Ed and Peggy escape and Ed sees a UFO while they are running. Hanzee pursues them and shoots Ed. They keep running and lock themselves in a grocery store's cooler room. Ed sits in anguish and tells Peggy that he can see her problems clearly now and that their relationship is over, even though he still loves her and the idea of their life together. He then succumbs to his wound.  Production  Ed's character (Plemons) and Peggy (Dunst) were the first two characters to be cast for the season, with the announcement made in December 2014. Plemons had to style his appearance in many ways to fit showrunner Noah Hawley's image. He had already gained weight for his role in the film Black Mass, and he was instructed to keep it on against his wishes for Ed's character. The middle hair part that is an iconic element of Ed's appearance was also conceptualized by Hawley. He has since become engaged to marry his costar, Kirsten Dunst.  Reception  Plemons' performance as Ed Blumquist was widely appreciated by audience and critics alike. Plemons won the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Movie/Miniseries. Plemons was additionally nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for 2016-2017 which was awarded to Sterling K. Brown for his role in FX's The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story.

Harvey IV was still a minor when his father died and the Lordship of L√©on was ruled but the Duke of Brittany, John I the Red. Harvey seems to have lived in France, where he married Maud of Poissy, daughter and heiress of William of Poissy and his wife Isabella of Marly, and used the title Lord of Ch√¢teauneuf, which he had inherited from his mother Margaret of Ch√¢teauneuf, until 1260. At this date, Harvey acknowledged John I‚Äôs authority and paid him homage. In September 1281, he gave all his properties in Ch√¢teauneuf and Senonches to King Philip III the Bold. This part of Harvey‚Äôs inheritance then passed to Louis of Valois, Count of Chartres and Alen√ßon (younger son of Charles I, Count of Valois, Alen√ßon and Perche; brother of Philip IV the Fair), who was granted Ch√¢teauneuf-en- Thymerais. Louis died without issue in 1328/29 and King Philip VI gave a part of Louis‚Äô inheritance to his younger son Charles II of Valois, Count of Alen√ßon and Perche, granting him Ch√¢teauneuf-en-Thimerais and Senonches, as well as Champrond, among other lands, in a charter dated May 1335.

She and her husband Morris C. Shumiatcher began supporting the arts community in Regina, Saskatchewan, shortly after their marriage in 1955, an endeavor which she has continued since Morris' death in 2004. The couple were avid collectors of Inuit art and artwork by local artists. In 2014 she donated 1,310 Inuit sculptures and paintings by the Regina Five, worth an estimated C$3 million, to the University of Regina.

On 1 November 2015, he was elected President of the Executive Bureau of the Initiative Group set up to organize the Republican referendum amending the Constitution with regard to the election and direct dismissal of the president by the people, the limitation of parliamentary immunity and the number of deputies from 101 to 71. NƒÉstase has also drafted laws that were subsequently examined and positively endorsed by the Constitutional Court. In December 2015, a part of the Dignity and Truth Platform members, including NƒÉstase, joined the People's Force Party.Platforma DA fuzioneazƒÉ cu Partidul For»õa Poporului Unimedia.info, 11 decembrie 2015 At the extraordinary congress on 13 December 2015, the party was renamed to Dignity and Truth Platform Party (Partidul Politic \\"Platforma Demnitate »ôi AdevƒÉr\\", PPDA), elected new governing bodies, and NƒÉstase was elected as party chairman.Andrei NƒÉstase, noul pre»ôedinte al Partidului Politic Demnitate »ôi AdevƒÉr; A fost edificatƒÉ o alternativƒÉ politicƒÉ Jurnal.md, 13 decembrie 2015 2016 presidential election Andrei NƒÉstase was appointed by the Political National Council of the Dignity and Truth Platform Party to run in the 2016 presidential elections. He was registered on 18 September 2016 as a candidate, the fourth officially registered with the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) for the elections of 30 October 2016. On October 15, 2016, Andrei NƒÉstase officially announced his withdrawal from the race and endorsed Action and Solidarity Party candidate Maia Sandu. 2018 Chi»ôinƒÉu mayoral election At the 2018 Chi»ôinƒÉu mayoral election, after finishing second in the first round with 32.1%, NƒÉstase gained 52.57% of the total number of votes in the runoff, beating Ion Ceban (47.43%). However, on 19 June 2018, the elections were declared void on the grounds of violation of election silence on election day by both candidates, contrary to the provisions of the Electoral Code. As such, the mandate of the elected mayor, Andrei NƒÉstase, was not validated by the magistrates of the Center Sector Court in Chi»ôinƒÉu, a decision maintained on 21 June 2018 by the Chi»ôinƒÉu Court of Appeal, as well as by the Supreme Court of Justice (SCJ), which, on 25 June 2018, gave the final verdict on the validation of the results of the Chi»ôinƒÉu elections. On June 29, 2018 the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) also declared void the local elections held in the capital city. NƒÉstase regarded the decision as politically motivated and considered it to be ordered by Vladimir Plahotniuc. Following this decision, the mayor of Chi»ôinƒÉu will be elected in the 2019 Moldovan local elections and the mayoralty will be headed by an interim mayor. On October 8, 2019, the Chi»ôinƒÉu Court of Appeal has validated the Andrei Nastase's mandate by overturning the ruling issued by the Chi»ôinƒÉu Court that annulled the local elections held in 2018. Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, 2019 At the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), carried out on June 24‚Äì28, 2019, the Republic of Moldova has been represented by Andrei NƒÉstase (head of the Moldovan delegation) ‚Äì PPDA, Vlad BƒÉrtr√Æncea ‚Äì PSRM and Mihai Pop»ôoi ‚Äì PAS. From the Republic of Moldova side, votes in favour of Russia's delegation reinstatement to this institution (the sanction imposed before to Russian because of Crimea annexation to Russian Federation and implication into the rebel conflict in the easten Ukrainina region), came from Andrei NƒÉstase and Vlad BƒÉtr√Æncea. Andrei Nastase was deeply criticized for that decision. His colleague, Alexandr Slusari, the deputy chairman of the DA Platform, has stated that \\"Most probably it was a hard decision. I personally won‚Äôt have voted\\". Ex mayor Dorin ChirtoacƒÉ has criticized the vote granted by Andrei NƒÉstase, asking his resignation: \\"When last year, Nastase has stated that: \\"Unification is a stupidity\\", putting us in a bad light in face of Romania, today it puts us in a state of tension with Ukraine and, asked by nobody, plays along for the Russian Federation. The resignation, Mr. NƒÉstase! You are now in too many position. The resignation from the PACE, the Parliament, the Government, the MAI, from ACUM, from the PPDA and with a self- report in hand, please go to the investigation bodies, after they are reformed, to clear out the privatization of \\"Air Moldova \\"happened in 2000 and raider attack of\\" Victoriabank \\"in 2005.\\" The spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs and European Integration, Alexandru Roitman, has said that the vote within PACE of the Moldovan's officials does not represent the country or the Government position \\"moreover, the Executive does not have the prerogative to recommend to the MPs how to vote\\". 2019 Chi»ôinƒÉu mayoral election On September 21, 2019 Andrei NƒÉstase has launched the election campaign for the general local elections of 20 October 2019, by ACUM Bloc, formed by PAS and PPDA parties. Valeriu Munteanu, his electoral rival and the leader of the Save Bessarabia Union (, USB) has instituted a proceedings against him, because he would infringe the electoral legislation by printing the pictures of Stephen III of Moldavia and the City Hall on his promotional leaflets. By the Ruling of October the 5th, 2019 issued by the Chi»ôinƒÉu Court of R√¢»ôcani District of Chi»ôinƒÉu, Andrei NƒÉstase, the candidate for the position of the general mayor of the Chi»ôinƒÉu municipality, delegated by ACUM Electoral Bloc \\"Dignity and Truth Platform and PAS\\", was obligated to exclude the picture, information/leaflet that contain the public authority ‚Äì the City Hall of the Chi»ôinƒÉu and historical personalities \\"Stephen III of Moldavia\\" and as well, it was prohibited to use the electoral material/leaflet in electioneering and to unmake the remained stock. In the first round of the elections on General Mayor position of the Chi»ôinƒÉu muni of October 20, 2019, Andrei NƒÉstase has gained 31,08% of votes, and his rival Ion Ceban - 40,19%. In the second round of the elections for the position of the General Mayor of the Chi»ôinƒÉu muni of November the 3rd, 2019 Andrei Nastase accumulated 47,61% of votes. Although, he was confident of his victory, Andrei Nastase has lost to Ion Ceban and gained 52,39% of votes. Personal life NƒÉstase is married to Angela NƒÉstase and has three children. His brother, Vasile NƒÉstase, is a journalist, former MP of the first parliament of Moldova, and one of the people who has signed the Declaration of Independence of Moldova. NƒÉstase is the godson of the businessman Victor »öopa.http://www.democracy.md/?article=5760 Andrei NƒÉstase, finul lui Victor »öopa, accesat la 14 decembrie 2018 Controversies As a lawyer, he is known for defending various domestic and foreign investors in national and international courts, such as the German company Unistar, but also those of businessmen Viorel and Victor Topa. This was used in a long-standing smear campaign against NƒÉstase, portraying the two businessmen as fugitive cousins, despite the two being unrelated. The smear campaign was conducted via the media holdings owned by oligarch Vlad Plahotniuc. A Rise imvestigation sheds light on the real reason why Plahotniuc wanted NƒÉstase labelled as \\"The Man of »öopas\\".. Viorel Topa and Victor Topa were illegally stripped of their assets at Victoriabank by Plahotniuc, then blackmailed and forced to seek refuge in Germany. German authorities refuse to extradite them arguing that the Topa's cases are classed as political persecution. Media owned by Plahotniuc wrote that the Open Dialogue Foundation, led by activist Lyudmyla Kozlovska and allegedly funded by Kazakh businessman and politician Muhtar Abliazov, has paid for flight tickets to Brussels for NƒÉstase and Maia Sandu. They claim the two have benefited from funding from the foundation without properly declaring it. Kozlovska was politically persecuted by Plahotniuc's PD, later dropped after Plahotniuc fled Moldova upon losing the parliamentary majority in the 2019 elections. According to statements made by the Liberal Party leader, Dorin ChirtoacƒÉ, NƒÉstase would have harmed Moldova with a loss worth ‚Ç¨7 million. He refers to the involvement of Andrei Nastase in the privatization of state company Air Moldova,https://www.ziarulnational.md/doc-chirtoaca- serial-de-probe-care-ar-demonstra-ca-nastase-e-implicat-in-prima-privatizare- a-companiei-air-moldova-documentele-prezentate-sunt-oficiale/ through which the German company Unistar Ventures, allegedly managed by Victor »öopa, acquired 49% of the airline's shares. This is, in fact, Andrei NƒÉstase winning the case at the European Court of Human Rights, who forced Moldova to pay back material damages caused to the plaintiffs. At Andrei NƒÉstase request, appointed as Minister of the Ministry of the Internal Affairs, Gheorge Balan, a former judge known for his criticism against corruption in the judiciary during Plahotniuc's rule, has been appointed as interim Head of the General Police Inspectorate at the first meeting of the new Government, when Alexandru P√Ænzari was dismissed. Later, Andrei NƒÉstase has introduced the new interim head of the GPI, who has invited his subordinates to the parliament.https://protv.md/politic/andrei-nastase-l-a-prezentat-pe-noul-sef- al-igp-numit-de-guvernul-sandu-gheorghe-balan-i-a-chemat-pe-toti-subalternii- sai-la-parlament-fac-un-apel-catre-toti-politistii-de-buna-credinta-sa-vina- si-sa-luam-decizii-importante-pentru-tara-veniti-sa-ne-luam----2495152.html Andrei Nastase l-a prezentat pe noul sef al IGP, retrieved June 18, 2019 Soon after, NƒÉstase confirmed that him and Gheorghe Balan are in kinship affinity relations (one of several godparents) but that he is qualified to continue as interim Head until the recruitment process finalises. Soon after, the Sandu Cabinet was voted out which had a ripple effect across all institution appointments. Gheorghe Balan has recognized that he and Andrei NƒÉstase a in affinity relations (are the godparents). The newly appointed Minister of Internal Affairs has stated to the media \\"that the affinity that is having Mr. Balan did not have anything in common with his appointment for the position of the acting head of the GPI‚Ä¶ shortly after a competition will be arranged.\\" On February 21, 2019, Andrei NƒÉstase and the candidates of the ACUM electoral bloc, both of the national and uninominal constituency, have signed the public commitment according to which after Parliamentary elections of February 24, 2019 they would not make any coalition with the Party of Socialists, Democratic Party and Shor Party, and if this commitment will be violated they resign from as MPs mandate. After PAS made the unilateral decision to coalise with PSRM to oust Plahotniuc, Platforma DA agreed to accept PSRM votes for the Sandu Cabiet, but insisted on a series of public commitments and anti- oligarchic laws package.

Set in the United Kingdom, Turkey, the Netherlands and Switzerland, the film is directed by Doroth√©e Forma and produced by HUMAN with the support of the Dutch Humanist Association. In 2016, it was succeeded by Non-believers: Freethinkers on the Run, which dealt with the fate of apostates and freethinkers in Dutch refugee camps.  Synopsis  Trailer Among Nonbelievers. Boris van der Ham, president of the Dutch Humanist Association, meets up with ex-Muslims in different countries, listens to their stories and discusses with them what should be done about their situation. First, he visits the Istanbul-based office of Ateizm Derneƒüi, an association that serves the interests of atheists, who are regularly threatened, harassed and discriminated in Turkey. Religion is also exploited by president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan's AKP government as an economic power tool, some activists explain in Istanbul. Next, Van der Ham attends the Secular Conference 2014 in London, organised by the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain led by Maryam Namazie, where 'secular thinkers, filmmakers and experts convene to raise awareness about the problems experienced by nonbelievers.' There, regular calls are made on Western and European humanists to show more solidarity and dedicated to the rights of nonbelievers outside the Western world. Sudanese ex-Muslim Nahla Mahmoud was targeted by an Islamist hate campaign after she criticised British sharia courts. She rebuked the regressive left attitude of some Westerners who dismiss any kind of criticism of Islam as 'islamophobia', and ignore Islamic intolerance in the spirit of 'multiculturalism'. An extra danger is that the far-right will hijack the debate on Islam if the left is too afraid to say anything. Richard Dawkins adds that many liberal critics of Islam fear being called 'racists', even though Islam is not a 'race', and that liberals have the duty to advocate for women's rights and freedom of expression. Van der Ham also goes to Glasgow for conversations with the Ex- Muslims of Scotland, who are threatened and discriminated against by members of their own family, and cannot return to their country of birth, where they face the death penalty for apostasy or blasphemy. He discusses the Charlie Hebdo shooting with Theodor Holman. Together with other Dutch humanists and freethinkers, Van der Ham marches through The Hague to demand freedom of thought. They offer copies of the 2015 Freedom of Thought Report to ambassadors of a number of countries where nonbelievers are being persecuted and oppressed; he conducts a conversation with the Iraqi ambassador. The report is also received in the Dutch House of Representatives by the House Commission of Foreign Affairs. Elizabeth O'Casey, IHEU representative at the United Nations, explains how Muslim-majority countries internationally always invoke the argument of 'defamation of religion' to continue to violate the human rights of their citizens. Finally, Van der Ham holds a plea for freedom of thought against religious intolerance at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.

Scawen's family came from Cornwall, and had an interest at Mitchell. His grandfather Thomas Scawen and great-uncle William Scawen were wealthy merchants in London and acquired large estates in Surrey including Carshalton Park which his father inherited.

The film, was directed by Scott McAboy and produced by Amy Sydorick, starring Casey Simpson, Breanna Yde, Klarke Pipkin, A.J. Louis Rivera Jr., Ty Nicolas Consiglio, Katey Hoffman, and Russell Roberts. Plot Kyle Keeley (Casey Simpson) is an imaginative young boy who solves to solve puzzles created by famous game designer Mr. Luigi Lemoncello (Russell Roberts). One day, Lemoncello unveils his newest creation: a high tech library in which he selects twelve young children to solve puzzles and riddles and whoever gets out first will be the new spokesperson for all things Lemoncello. The twelve are selected: Kyle, his best friend and adventurous Akimi (Breanna Yde), bookworm Sierra (Klarke Pipkin), nerd Andrew Peckleman (A.J. Louis Rivera Jr.), bully Charles Chiltington (Ty Nicolas Consiglio), popular girl Haley Daley (Hayley Scherpenisse), Rose Vermette (Hannah Cheramy), Sean Keegan (Dylan Kingwell), Bridgette Wadge (Lily Killam), helpful Miguel Fernandez (Anantjot S. Aneja), over-eager Kayla Carson (Ombu Ance), and Yasmeen Smith-Snyder (Jenna Skodje). Upon entering the library, Lemoncello and his assistant Dr. Zinchenko (Katey Hoffman) explain how difficult it is going to be and that they can use the devices they are given to opt out which opens a trap door that takes them out of the library. This causes Bridgette and Sean to forfeit and go home. Afterwards, the rules are explained and they are all given a library card which Kayla takes and hits causing her to be eliminated since she did not listen to the rules. After that, the challenge begins. Upon solving the first clue, Chiltington reveals his sly and bullying self when he lies to Yasmeen causing her to be eliminated. Afterwards, they are given four rooms designed based on book genres: horror, fantasy, classic, and children. A holographic librarian named Ms. Tobin (Patti Allan) appears and explains the rules of entering the room including you can only enter each room once. Miguel eagerly offers to enter the horror room to get the clue, but he soon becomes terrified by Count Dracula (Alexander Mandra) and Frankenstein's monster (John DeSantis) and opts out before he can reach The Tell-Tale Heart. Chiltington also gets Rose to opt out due to her own fear. Getting fed up with one another, the six remaining children divide into two teams: on one is Chiltington, Haley, and Andrew and on the other one is Kyle, Akimi, and Sierra. While Kyle's team enters the classic room where they had to ride flying books to solve a clue, Chiltington's team enters the children's section where Chiltington works to put Humpty Dumpty together while Peckleman meets Charlotte (Kari Wahlgren) from Charlotte's Web and Mother Goose. Both respective teams manage to receive their clues although Chiltington lies to everyone he forgot the clue in the children's section. This causes Haley to attempt to get it back, but is disqualified by Ms. Tobin for trying to go back inside: a rule which she did not listen to due to her doing selfies. She is sent down the trap door and is deposited outside as the crowd laughs at her. Lemoncello talks to Dr. Z about Chiltington's trickeries as Dr. Z leaves to go deal with a glitch involving Wilbur the Pig. While making her way to the scene of the glitch, Chiltington and Peckleman state that they aren't cheating as Chiltington secretly takes a golden key which has power over the who library. Kyle's team enters the fantasy section while Chiltington decides to cheat and gets Andrew to follow him into the section as well deciding to cheat and use them to get the clue which Andrew is uneasy about. The troll (Dana Snyder) from Three Billy Goats Gruff has them make out as many words from Lemoncello where the failure will have them be attacked by the giant from Jack and the Beanstalk. Kyle's team solves another riddle and receives a clue. While using the key to collapse the beanstalk and cause the Wicked Witch of the East (Breanna Watkins) to manifest, Chiltington however accidentally destroys the system releasing all the creatures including Count Dracula, the troll, and a werewolf (Brin Alexander) into the library and wrecks havoc. Lemoncello decides to go into the library and help the children. While Mother Goose is shown to have gone over to one of the library sections and brushed up on ninjitsu as mentioned by Charlotte, the kids were able to use the characters' weaknesses like water on the Wicked Witch of the East. Chiltington, regretting what he has done after he and Peckleman were attacked by Hansel and Gretel (Simon Pidgeon and Devyn Dalton) for eating their bread crumbs, also elects to help the team. The group escapes into the vents as they see the giant approaching the exit to the fantasy section. Using dynamite, Lemoncello was able to put some distances between them and the pursuing Count Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, werewolf, and Hansel and Gretel. Making it to the exit, Ms. Tobin tells them how to activate it after she had fought off the troll. They all manage to restore order until a giant pterodactyl appears. The dinosaur was an idea created by Kyle and was released in the idea room when the children had previously entered. Instead of running in terror, Kyle faces his fear and fight off the dinosaur with red balloons he found after Lemoncello tells him not to blame himself for his idea, but embrace it as his own and defeat it using his bravery. Lemoncello, Dr. Z, and the five remaining children exit the game and Lemoncello, impressed by their bravery and creative solutions, declare them all winners and thus spokespeople for his company. Dr. Z states to Lemoncello that she will need a vacation after this as well as getting the book characters back into their respectful sections. Peckleman offers Chiltington his friendship and a ride home after having been previously told that Chiltington's parents could not be here due to work. Lemoncello offers Kyle a job as a summer librarian which he happily agrees to and then, Lemoncello presents Kyle his golden key to hold on to for safe keeping.

Isparta (Sparta) in Pisidia was one of the late regions to develop a carpet- weaving tradition. The Greek Orthodox population played a vital role in this development. As they were keen merchants, they linked their carpet production to the activity of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers, a major company for carpets' production and export from the Ottoman Empire to the European countries and the United States. Pioneers in this process were the Isparta- born and of Greek Orthodox stock carpet-makers such as Prodromos Gregoriades, Iordanis and Damianos Styloglou, Philippos Kahramanoglou, Socrates and Damian Kahramanoglou, Minas Kehagioglou, Theodoris and Ioannis Papazoglou, Athanasios Pesmazoglou, Nikolaos Soutsoglou etc. Carpet weaving in Asia Minor belongs to a long tradition of carpet weaving, intrinsically related to the nomadic life of the turkic tribes which settled this region gradually from the 11th century onwards. As the nomads became sedentary, local styles in flat and pile rugs appeared; therefore we now discern styles according to place-names where these styles were more popular, such as Ushak carpet, Bergama Carpets, Konya carpets etc.ŒíŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ±œÑŒ∂œåŒ≥ŒªŒøœÖ, Œü.,ŒúŒπŒ∫œÅŒ¨ ŒëœÉŒØŒ±, Œó ŒÜŒ≥ŒΩœâœÉœÑŒ∑ Œ†ŒπœÉŒπŒ¥ŒØŒ±, Œó ŒöŒ±Œ∏Œ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒØŒΩŒ∑ ŒïœÄœÑŒ¨ ŒóŒºŒ≠œÅŒµœÇ [Voyatzoglou, Œü., Asia Minor: The Unknown Pisidia, Kathimerini newspaper Seven Days] 16,3,1997  Origins and History Carpet weaving in Pisidian Isparta occurred at the end of the 19th century and was related mainly to the commercial and entrepreneurial skills of the Greek Orthodox population, of which some had the chance to study in Smyrna (modern Izmir) and in other major centres of the Ottoman Empire and Europe. They thus had the chance to learn more about technological innovation and trade precepts of the time.ŒôœÉœÑŒπŒ∫ŒøœÄŒøœçŒªŒøœÖ, Œõ., Œó ŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ œÑŒ±œÄŒ∑œÑŒøœÖœÅŒ≥ŒØŒ± Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∑ œÑŒ±œÄŒ∑œÑŒøœÖœÅŒ≥œåœÇ œÉœÑŒ∑ ŒúŒπŒ∫œÅŒ¨ ŒëœÉŒØŒ± (1860-1922), ŒëŒ∏ŒÆŒΩŒ±: ŒïœÉœÑŒØŒ±, 2000 [Istikopoulou, L., Greek carpet making and carpet making in Asia Minor (1860-1922), Athens, Hestia Publications, 2000]. According to the Greek Orthodox tradition, the first carpet in Isparta was woven at the end of the 1880s by Katina Styloglou, on a pattern designed by her brother, Iordanis Styloglou. Katina was taught how to weave carpets by a lady called Polytimi Kiourtsoglou. Katina Styloglou was married to the doctor Prodromos Gregoriades, originating from Kayseri, a region famous for its carpet-weaving tradition. Gregoriades got personally involved and very active in the process of organizing carpet production in his wife's hometown; in partnership with her brothers Iordanis and Damian, they developed innovative methods in weaving, they organized production on a cartel-based model and they established a wide and effective network for selling their carpets. Thus, Isparta carpets reached Europe, where, due to their low prices, they became quickly very popular among the emerging middle classes. However, another tradition mentions as instigator of this whole process an Ottoman official originating from Isparta. It is possible that both traditions are true and complement each other. In any case, they attest to a general tendency towards the end of the 19th century to organize production according to western standards and to implement cooperation between the Muslim and Christian population.  Production mode  The organization of production in Isparta attests to the first attempts at industrialization in Asia Minor. Several Isparta-born carpet manufacturers attempted at first to circumvent the major Smyrna-based trade houses; pretty soon, however, they realized that this was not possible. Thus, they finally signed business agreements with Oriental Carpet Manufacturers,Wynn, A., Three Camels to Smyrna, Hali Publications 2008 one of the largest companies active in this field, which bought the carpets on a monopoly-based system, whereas it also provided the weavers with primary material, such as dyed yarns, and with technical assistance, namely specialized personnel who could improve the processes and final products. Carpet weaving was mostly a home-based production and the weavers were mainly women or girls over 8 years old, as was customary in those days in all carpet- weaving areas.Quataert, D., ‚ÄúCarpet making‚Äù, in Quataert, D., Ottoman Manufacturing in the Age of the Industrial Revolution, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993, 134-160. In the Ottoman Empire, after all, child work was acceptable and widespread, whereas the age limit for adulthood was lower than today. The price paid was estimated on the basis of \\"knots\\" delivered, in contrast to the central manufactures of Oriental Carpets, where workers were paid on an eight-hours' shift basis.. Isparta weavers were paid much less (probably about half) than those in other traditional carpet-weaving centres, such as U≈üak. This information is attested by the archives of the Oriental Carpets Manufactuers company. The reason is probably that the carpet manufacturers in Isparta wanted to compete successfully against their major rivals and to created a new carpet-weaving centre, having in mind to gradually increase the prices of their carpets and the wages of the workers accordingly.Œ§œÅŒ±Œ∫Œ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ, Œì., Œó Œ≤ŒπŒøŒºŒ∑œáŒ±ŒΩŒØŒ± ŒµŒΩ Œ£ŒºœçœÅŒΩŒ∑ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒµŒΩ œÑŒ∑ ŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒúŒπŒ∫œÅŒ±œÉŒØŒ±, ŒµœÄŒπŒº.

Some sources relate 600 looms and others up to 4,000.Quataert, D., \\"Ottoman manufacturing in the 19th century\\", in Quataert, D.,Manufacturing in the Ottoman Empire and Turkey, 1500-1950, œÉŒµŒª. 109. Quataert believes that in the beginning of the 20th century Smyrna had 800 looms The latter figure is probably exaggerated. In any case, carpet weaving in Isparta developed rapidly, given the fact that it started at the end of the 1880s and lasted up to the expulsion of the Greek Orthodox population in 1922 (at least in the aforementioned form).  Isparta carpets' features  Isparta carpets came in a standard quality, which enhanced their commercial value and demand. Their main feature was the cotton weft and the use of asymmetric knotsStone, P., Oriental Rugs: An Illustrated Lexicon of Motifs, Materials, and Origins Many of them belonged to the prayer-rug type, with triangular patterns which remind of a mihrab. The Isparta type rug, considered by Kahramanos, a standardized product of the 19th century, is woven with double- stranded yarns and in a smaller number of knots; their initial patterns were imitating popular Asia Minor styles, particularly those of U≈üak, with a central medallion, decorated corners and lively colours. Soon, they turned to imitating Persian style, which proved much more popular in the western markets, particularly that of the United States. Later, n the 1920s and 1930s they followed Sarouk patterns.Stone, P., Oriental Rugs: An Illustrated Lexicon of Motifs, Materials, and Origins Initially yarns were dyed with natural, plant-based dyes, but soon, as elsewhere, they changed to chemically-dyed yarns. The original wool on wool fabric was replaced to a combination of lamb's wool for the weft and cotton or linen for the warp.Encyclop√©die m√©thodique, ou, par ordre de mati√®res, vol.2, Paris 1892Gregoriann, A.T., Oriental rugs and the stories they tell, Sribner 1977  Technology and Innovation  Carpet production in Isparta followed the technologically innovative solutions of that time such as the aforementioned replacement of natural dyes by chemical ones, which were cheaper.Goswami, K.K.(ed.), Advances in Carpet Manufacture, 2017 The anilins used at first were proved to be inconsistent, but soon chemistry provided new synthetic dyes with steady and standardized colours; this made the reproduction of the same pattern over and over again possible. The use of millimetric paper for designing the patterns, a technique developed and taught in Isparta by Iordanis Styloglou, allowed workers to reproduce patterns exactly in all their details. This technique also allowed for the import and reproduction of new, original patterns and colours which were popular in the export destination countries.Œ†Œ±œÄŒ±Œ¥Œ¨Œ∫Œ∑, Œô.-Œë., ¬´Œü œÉœÄŒ±œÅœÑŒ±ŒªŒÆœÇ ŒôŒøœÅŒ¥Œ¨ŒΩŒ∑œÇ Œ£œÑœçŒªŒøŒ≥ŒªŒøœÖ (1875-1948).

According to Sherif Mardin, the paradigm set by the Greek Orthodox population was so successful, that the Ottoman authorities decided to found a school for carpet weaving in Isparta in 1891.Mardin, S., Religion and Social Change in Modern Turkey: The Case of Bediuzzaman Said Nursi, State University of New York 1199  Trade Network  Isparta carpet weavers attempted to circumvent the Smyrna tradesmen who acted as middlemen and to collaborate directly with the United Kingdom through the Ottoman consular authorities; however this effort ended up badly and they finally had to accept collaboration with trade houses in Smyrna, run by families of Levantines who had access to the European markets. From 1908 onwards, when the trade house of Smyrna constituted the ‚ÄúOriental Carpet Manufacturers‚Äù, and up to the beginning of World War I in 1914, carpet weaving in Isparta reached its peak. However, the War caused a severe blow to the trade network and the Oriental Carpets Manufacturers started vacillating. In that very year Ispara suffered damage by a destructive earthquake, which affected its production. At the end of the war, however, the Ispartan carpet makers founded their own trade houses in Izmir and went so well that they soon competed against their former \\"boss\\", namely the Oriental Carpets Manufacturers. However, the Greek occupation of Izmir in 1919 worsened the situation, as the land operations inland organized by the Greek army led to upheaval and hostilities. The final blow was struck by the forced deportation dislocation of the male adult population of Isparta in 1921 Kemal Atat√ºrk‚Äôs army and the departure of the rest of the Greek orthodox population of Isparta, in the fall of 1922. Carpet Weaving after the expulsion of the Greek Orthodox population The Greek Orthodox population had started being persecuted from 1915 onwards, when large part of the male population was driven to the \\"amele taburu\\", namely work battalions, as was also the case with most Greek communities in Asia Minor in which hundreds of thousands died. In 1922 the rest of the population, namely women and children, were also forced to leave. Through the port of Antalya they crossed the Aegean and landed in Volos and from there they were dispersed in various locations in Greece. The main bulk of Ispartans and Pisidians in general settled at Podarades and formed the nucleus of the present-day Athenian suburb of Nea Ionia. The choice of this region was deliberate, as there was abundant water from the torrent of Podoniftis, which enabled processing of yarns and thus textile and carpet weaving activities. Indeed, the first settlers borrowed funds from the National Bank or other sources and set up looms in small, artisanal units. The Refugees' Rehabilitation Committee worked vehemently to create the infrastructure for industrial activity, by buying large land plots which were almost given away gratis to entrepreneurs under the condition that the latter had to start producing within a three years' time frame. Some of the carpet manufacturers who developed industrial plants the Styloglou family, the Dourmousoglou family, the Bostantzoglou brothers et al. Carpet weaving activity soon flourished and was industrialized. Roughly 1,200 female carpet weavers worked within the industrial plants, whereas others continued to work at home.ŒåŒªŒ≥Œ± ŒíŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ±œÑŒ∂œåŒ≥ŒªŒøœÖ, ¬´Œó Œ≤ŒπŒøŒºŒ∑œáŒ±ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒµŒ≥Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ¨œÉœÑŒ±œÉŒ∑ œÉœÑŒ∑ ŒùŒ≠Œ± ŒôœâŒΩŒØŒ± - Œ†Œ±œÅŒ¨ŒºŒµœÑœÅŒøœÇ ŒµŒ≥Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ¨œÉœÑŒ±œÉŒ∑œÇ¬ª, œÉœÑŒø œÉœÖŒªŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∫œå œÑœåŒºŒø Œü ŒæŒµœÅŒπŒ∂œâŒºœåœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∑ Œ¨ŒªŒªŒ∑ œÄŒ±œÑœÅŒØŒ¥Œ±, œå.œÄ., œÉœÉ. 150-156 Several of these carpet weavers included also textile manufacturing in their activities, initially of woolen fabrics, then with cotton or even silk fabrics. This side activity allowed them to stand on their feet after 1929, when the American recession caused the demand for carpets to sink, given the fact that almost 90% of the production headed towards the United States and Western European countries. At the same time, many manufacturers originating from Asia Minor started forming trusts in order to have funds to continue their activity. The small manufactures developed into larger industrial units. This was the case with the \\"Sterlina\\" manufactures of the Styloglou brothers, who entered into a trust together with the Efraimoglou and Athanasoglou families, thus founding the wool-weaving company \\"Tria Alfa\\", extant to this day; similar was the path followed by the textile makers \\"Moutalaski\\", which was founded by the Tsalikoglou family and developed into a larger trust together with the Siniosoglou family. In 1924 was founded the first carpet weaving cooperative, called \\"Carpet-weaving copperative of Isparta, Pisidia\\". Its aim was to promote carpet weaving and achieve better funding through the Refugees' Rehabilitation Committee. Two more carpet companies, namely the Hellenic Carpet Company and the Oriental Carpet Company were founded just at the outskirts of the industrial zone of Eleftheroupoli (Nea Ionia-Perissos). In the same period the Hellenic Wool Manufacture, which had been founded in 1918, got on the fast track of development. On the other side of the Aegean Sea, in Pisidia, carpet weaving activity was continued by the Turkish population which remained there and is in fact thriving to this day. Isparta developed, side by side with Izmir and Istanbul, into one of the major carpet washing centres. Washing of carpets is a major step towards their finishing. This was at least attested by a World Trade report in the mid-20th century.Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, World Trade in Commodities, United States 1949, vol. 7, parts 9-24.

Embedded stellar clusters, or simply embedded clusters (EC), are open clusters that are still surrounded by their progenitor molecular cloud. They are often areas of active star formation, giving rise to stellar objects that have similar ages and compositions. Because of the dense material that surrounds the stars, they appear obscured in visible light but can be observed using other sections of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as the near-infrared and X-rays that can see through the cloud material. In our Galaxy, embedded clusters can mostly be found within the Galactic disk or near the Galactic center where most of the star-formation activity is happening. The sizes of stellar objects born in embedded clusters are distributed according to initial mass function, with many low-mass stars formed for every high-mass star. Nevertheless, the high- mass stars of temperature class O and B, which are significantly hotter and more luminous than the low-mass stars, have a disproportionate effect on their interstellar environment by ionizing the gas surrounding them creating H II regions. Many ultra-compact H II regions, the precursors to massive protostars, are associated with embedded clusters. Over time, radiation pressure from the stellar objects will disperse the molecular cloud and give rise to the better known open cluster. Several famous embedded clusters include the Trapezium cluster in the Orion Nebula, L1688 in the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex, NGC 2244 in the Rosette Nebula, the cluster in the Trifid Nebula, NGC 6611 in the Eagle Nebula, and Trumpler 14, 15, and 16 in the Carina Nebula  References  Open clusters Star formation ","title":"Embedded cluster"},{"id":"55406524","text":"1984 Emmy Awards may refer to: * 36th Primetime Emmy Awards, the 1984 Emmy Awards ceremony honoring primetime programming * 11th Daytime Emmy Awards, the 1984 Emmy Awards ceremony honoring daytime programming * 12th International Emmy Awards, the 1984 Emmy Awards ceremony honoring international programming Emmy Award ceremonies by year ","title":"1984 Emmy Awards"},{"id":"55406542","text":"1985 Emmy Awards may refer to: * 37th Primetime Emmy Awards, the 1985 Emmy Awards ceremony honoring primetime programming * 12th Daytime Emmy Awards, the 1985 Emmy Awards ceremony honoring daytime programming * 13th International Emmy Awards, the 1985 Emmy Awards ceremony honoring international programming Emmy Award ceremonies by year ","title":"1985 Emmy Awards"},{"id":"55406552","text":"Redouane Kerrouche (born 26 April 1994) is a French professional footballer who plays as a midfielder.

As of August 2017, the book had peaked at The New York Times No. 4 bestseller in hardcover nonfiction. Content In Why Buddhism is True, Wright advocates a secular, Westernized form of Buddhism focusing on the practice of mindfulness meditation and stripped of supernatural beliefs such as reincarnation. He further argues that more widespread practice of meditation could lead to a more reflective and empathetic population and reduce political tribalism. In line with his background, Wright draws heavily on evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology to defend Buddhism's diagnosis of the causes of human suffering. He argues the modern psychological idea of the modularity of mind resonates with the Buddhist teaching of no-self (anatman). Reception Why Buddhism is True received a number of positive reviews from major publications. A review in The New Yorker by Adam Gopnik stated, \\"Wright‚Äôs book has no poetry or paradox anywhere in it. [...] Yet, if you never feel that Wright is telling you something profound or beautiful, you also never feel that he is telling you something untrue. Direct and unambiguous, tracing his own history in meditation practice‚Äîwhich eventually led him to a series of weeklong retreats and to the intense study of Buddhist doctrine‚Äîhe makes Buddhist ideas and their history clear.\\" The neuroscientist Antonio Damasio, reviewing the book in The New York Times, wrote, \\"Wright's book is provocative, informative and, in many respects, deeply rewarding.\\" Kirkus Reviews called the book a \\"cogent and approachable argument for a personal meditation practice based on secular Buddhist principles.\\" Adam Frank, writing for National Public Radio, called it \\"delightfully personal, yet broadly important\\". The Washington Post gave a more mixed review, writing that \\"while [Wright] does not make a fully convincing case for some of his more grandiose claims about truth and freedom, his argument contains many interesting and illuminating points.\\" In 2020, Evan Thompson questioned what he called Buddhist exceptionalism, \\"the belief that Buddhism is superior to other religions... or that Buddhism isn't really a religion but rather is a kind of 'mind science,' therapy, philosophy, or a way of life based on meditation.\\" Thompson questioned both Wright's version of secularized and naturalized Buddhism and, conversely, Wright's conception of evolutionary psychology that Wright claims Buddhism is uniquely equipped to address.

Synopsis The crew attempt to play a game of poker, with Lister attempting to teach Cat how to have a proper poker face, but Cat failing to understand. Kryten interrupts to report on a resource-rich station to scavenge, which the crew head-off towards onboard Starbug, severely on the fritz to the point it requires an elaborate start-up sequence to work. Due to a powerful sandstorm, they are left temporarily stranded there. The crew venture through the base, encountering \\"cyrobooths\\" bearing the names of Messalina, Vlad the Impaler, Joseph Stalin, and Adolf Hitler. They are then greeted by Professor Shaul Telford, who reveals they were in stasis and their arrival having triggered their release, but that they've also been rehabilitated of their formerly psychopathic ways. They are introduced to these infamous figures, or \\"evils\\" as they're referred to by the crew, over dinner. Surprisingly, they prove to be kind and pleasant, and claim to be completely reformed. After getting to know him, Lister joins Hitler and performs \\"The Happy Wanderer\\" on guitar with him. The rest of the crew pull Lister aside to chastise him for socializing with Hitler, but are all knocked unconscious and put into separate torturous scenarios. After escaping from their traps, the crew meetup and accuse the \\"evils\\" of trying to kill them, however they fervently deny these accusations. They decide to test everybody using a device that scans who among them is a psychopath, which returns the results that of them two are psychopaths, one being the Cat, due to his inherently selfish and vain personality, and the other being Professor Telford. Telford reveals himself as the base's real patient, with the \\"evils\\" having been his android caretakers, who he reprogrammed. Telford holds the crew at gunpoint, but due to not knowing how to start Starbug, offers to take the Cat with him. Cat, seemingly, agrees and requests a gun to kill the other three with, only to immediately kill Telford with it, successfully tricking him. Something which Cat credits to his newly-learned \\"pokey\\" face. Production Originally, \\"Africa\\" by Toto was going to be used in place of \\"The Happy Wanderer\\" during their guitar performance, however the rights were denied when they learned Lister would be playing it alongside Hitler.

Originally broadcast on the British television channel Dave on 19 October 2017, it was made available early on 12 October 2017 on UKTV Play. The crew are kidnapped by a militant group of mechanoid insurgents known as the MILF (Mechanoid Intergalactic Liberation Front), \\"liberating\\" Kryten from his servitude, and converting Lister, Rimmer, and Cat into mechanoids themselves. Synopsis The day starts as any other onboard Red Dwarf with Kryten receiving a multitude of orders from the other three. Later on, Kryten discovers they've located Lister's guitar, previously flushed out into deep space. The crew, though with a very reluctant Rimmer and Cat included, take Starbug over to retrieve it. Once they do, they're taken in by a far larger and greatly intimidating vessel, who get the drop on the crew when they enter; the black beret-adorned mechanoids only take Lister, Rimmer, and Cat as prisoners, however, as they warmly take in Kryten as one of their own. The other three are placed into devices against their will, which one-by-one, transvers their essences into mechanoids resembling themselves. They are informed by the MILF, Areto, that they'll serve as their slaves as Kryten once was to them, and any possibility of refusal will prove impossible. Meanwhile, Kryten is pampered by the other mechanoids, and attends group therapy sessions where he is convinced of his former slave status to the Red Dwarf crew. As the three Kryten-ified others do menial labor for their new masters, they devise an escape plan which Rimmer foils by triggering an alarm, having had his personality completely erased by his new mechanoid programming. Lister and Cat rush into the lower decks of the ship where they meet another group of mechanoids, but these being seen as second-class citizens to the members of the MILF due to being earlier models. Just as they're ambushed by Areto and her reinforcements, Cat becomes fully-converted as well, and Lister flees. Kryten is in the midst of his inauguration into the MILF, when Lister bursts in and pleads against it. In an impassioned speech, Lister proclaims Kryten was never a slave to the Red Dwarf crew, and he was always one of them; Areto and her reinforcements arrive, as Lister also reveals they enslave their own due to them being outdated in-comparison, to which the MILF leader defends as necessary. Kryten realizes his mistake and refuses to join, to which the militants respond by putting him and Lister in a battle to the death, where the loser will be jettisoned into deep space. Lister loses his personality prior to the match, and Kryten loses, not putting up a fight. Before Kryten is thrown off the ship by the now fully-brainwashed Red Dwarf crew, the fabled \\"Siliconia\\" (in actuality a DivaDroid wireless update station) comes into the ship's path and upgrades all the mechanoids, making them all equal. Kryten declines the update and uncoverts the other three using the same machine, leading them back onboard Starbug and back to Red Dwarf. Production The episode was originally titled Kryticus, referencing Spartacus, or more specifically the film of the same name, due to it sharing the theme of rebelling against enslavement. Despite advances in the construction of the Kryten mask for Robert Llewellyn, the rest of the cast had to have their mechanoid masks constructed in the same physical-procedure as earlier series. Siliconia was also the first episode revealed of XI and XII, as it was mentioned at the initial announcement of both series at the Dimension Jump convention in 2015; saying how after years of being asked by the cast to do an episode where \\"everyone is Kryten\\" he'd agree to do one in the upcoming series.

After experiencing a strange time phenomenon, the crew must venture onboard a starship from the 24th century to stop them from crashing into an oncoming gas moon, only to be hindered by its unorthodox anti-criticism law. Synopsis After the crew claim a gas moon rich in Helium-7 for the JMC (an exercise orchestrated mainly by Rimmer), the crew are forced to retreat quicker than anticipated when an incoming solar storm is detected. On the way back onboard Starbug, the crew experience a timewave, which Kryten explains is the aftereffect of an imploding black hole, and that whoever falls victim to one risks the chance of being washed-up into an inhabitable corner of deep space. They discover a ship swept by the timewave, which is on a direct collision- course with the gas moon. After conducting some research, discovering the ship is from 24th century Earth and that it operates on a system of no criticism, they venture onboard to stop it. Greeted by the ship's flamboyant captain, Ziggy, they are guided to the ship's diner. It becomes apparent the ship is in total disarray, and after a bad experience from an unqualified waitress, the crew agree that the ship is a lost cause. However, on their way out, they are stopped by the ship's head policeman, who questions whether they're following the laws of their society. Cat grows fed-up and insults the cop, resulting in their imprisonment on the ship's brig. After a nearly-successful attempt at escape after swaying the policeman against the anti-criticism law, Ziggy returns and orders that they be \\"drained\\" of their critical behavior. Hooked- up to their anti-criticism device, Rimmer is chosen to be the first one drained of his unfavorable characteristics. However, when his critical side proves too strong, it manifests into a being of its own, who, after some reasoning by the crew, is defeated. After the fiasco, Ziggy concludes that the crew's defeating of Rimmer's critical side through criticism proves the ship's anti-criticism law incorrect; Ziggy wises up and redirects the ship away from the gas moon, and offers an apology to the crew with one of his badly-done paintings. Lister, believing Ziggy is now open to criticism, says it isn't very good. Ziggy, enraged, reinstates the law as the crew flee the ship.

Originally broadcast on the British television channel Dave on 2 November 2017, it was made available early on 26 October 2017 on UKTV Play. The machines aboard Red Dwarf grow concerned nobody has their interest in mind, and an election is held between Rimmer and Kryten to determine their new representative. Synopsis Red Dwarf goes into yellow alert, a personal favorite of Rimmer's, where the ship has to respond to an SOS call from another ship. Lister downloads the other ship's data; however, it turns out to really be an \\"SOS virus\\" and, due to Lister not downloading it onto a quarantined drive, it has infected the Red Dwarf computer system with harmful malware, forcing the crew to abandon the ship, which has started drifting towards a black hole. As the crew pack their supplies before escaping in Starbug, nearby vending machines question who'll be taking them to escape as well, before they list their importance. However, the crew explain they have no intention of bringing them along, so the machines combine their total power to defeat the malware infecting Red Dwarf. Due to the machines feeling they have no one on ship with them in mind, they go on strike until the crew come up with a plan. Rimmer initially intends to appoint himself as their new leader, mainly for the power the position would bring, so Kryten decides to run against him in a democratic election held by the machines. Rimmer runs as a member of the \\"Lovely Fluffy Liberal Alliance Party\\" alongside Cat, who he's blackmailing with the information that he needs reading glasses, whilst Kryten runs as a member of the \\"Independent Future Party\\" with Lister, not wanting Rimmer to take control of the ship, as his voluntary running mate. The election gets dirty as Rimmer decides to run a smear campaign on Kryten, airing attack ads on Kryten's mental health concerning his time taking care of the dead crew of the Nova 5. Kryten fires back, airing similar attack ads calling into account Rimmer having killed himself, twice. After some debates, the election is tied; to put the odds in their favour, Kryten and a begrudging Lister travel to the garbage hold where Talkie Toaster has been residing for the last 25 years. After agreeing to Talkie's demands to be put in the sleeping quarters and Lister eating a specified amount of toasted bread products each morning, they win his vote, which puts them over the edge, and Kryten wins the election for machine president. By next morning the crew are enjoying themselves, except for Rimmer, who Cat locked in the garbage hold alongside Talkie (who Lister has refused to take out of the garbage hold, despite getting his vote) until next week, as payback for blackmailing him to be his running mate. True to form, Talkie quickly drives Rimmer to insanity by constantly asking \\"Would you like some toast?\\" Production Even though Talkie's voice actor, David Ross, had since retired from acting, he still lent his voice to the character he last played in 1991, recording his lines at a sound studio in his native Lancashire. \\"Mechocracy\\" marks the fifth time Daniel Barker has voiced a distinct character in an episode, putting him at equal standing with Red Dwarf alumni, Tony Hawks. Doug Naylor had initial concerns bringing back vending machine-centric plots after Series X, but ultimately decided in favor of it as it aided the overall plot and humor of the episode. Reception \\"Mechocracy\\" received positive reviews from critics and fans. Writing for Den of Geek, Mark Harrison referred to the episode as, \\"the first bonafide classic episode of the Dave era.\\" Sophie Davies of Cultbox praised the episode as a strong comeback from prior episode Timewave, \\"[It] could have easily been plucked from a much earlier series, ‚ÄòMechocracy‚Äô is the best episode of Red Dwarf XII so far and one of the best of the show‚Äôs Dave era.\\" References External links Series XII episode guide at www.reddwarf.co.uk Red Dwarf XII episodes 2017 British television episodes Television episodes about elections ","title":"Mechocracy"},{"id":"55406935","text":"\\"Skipper\\" is the sixth episode of Red Dwarf XII and the 73rd in the series run. Originally broadcast on the British television channel Dave on 16 November 2017, it was made available early on 9 November 2017 on UKTV Play. Kryten invents a new device, coined the \\"quantum skipper\\", which Rimmer uses in an attempt to find a universe where he is more successful. Synopsis The crew look through Captain Hollister's files on the crew, where he derides both Lister and Rimmer as terrible employees. While Lister shows little care over it, Rimmer is angered and insults the other three, claiming he should've surrounded himself with people more successful than him (with them claiming they are). Later in the day, Kryten notices a strange phenomenon on the monitors, which turns out to be a disruption in spacetime that reverts their timeline to one where their actions are or aren't taken. Such as switching from the timeline where Cat doesn't cook Lister breakfast to the one where it does. After regrouping, the crew discover it was Kryten's new invention, the quantum skipper, which caused the error in time. After fixing his mistake, Rimmer requests he use the quantum skipper to traverse realities to find a better universe to live in compared to the one he's living in now. Kryten agrees, and the three see him off as Rimmer unceremoniously takes off. The first universe Rimmer travels to sees him on Red Dwarf pre-radiation leak; here, Rimmer is a hologram, unlike in his reality where he was alive before it occurred. After meeting-up with that universe's Holly and Captain Hollister, who was attempting a futile escape on a jammed escape pod, Rimmer escapes to a new universe. In the next one, Rimmer meets a more distinguished version of the crew, only for this universe's Cat to instead be a human-sized rat, known as Mr. Rat, alongside an entire race of rats who, unlike Cat's species, never left Red Dwarf. Rimmer decidedly leaves that one, and travels across several others, all he loathes. Finally, he reaches one where he is an officer on Red Dwarf, is married, and has four boys ‚Äî all of which Rimmer has always wanted. When reporting to the captain, however, he discovers Lister is the captain, having been the one to prevent the initial radiation leak and becoming immensely rich off Red Dwarf stocks when it discovered a valuable gas moon. Despite all his successes, Rimmer decides to abandon that universe, unable to cope with Lister being more successful than him. He returns to his original universe and joins the crew for a game of cards, with Lister remarking even with infinite universes at Rimmer's disposal, \\"infinite clearly wasn't enough.\\" Production With the returns of Holly and Captain Hollister, \\"Skipper\\" marks the return of Norman Lovett and Mac McDonald respectively to the show after their last appearance 18 years previously in the Series VIII finale, Only the Good....

Writing for Cultbox, Sophie Davies summed up her feelings on the episode, \\"Next year will mark 30 years since Red Dwarf first appeared on our screens, and unless Dave commissions some sort of anniversary special sharpish, ‚ÄòSkipper‚Äô functions perfectly well as a celebration of the show.

Beginning of the cremation ceremony The royal urn of King Chulalongkorn, lying in state in the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall of the Grand Palace The cremation proper is preceded by a procession of the Buddha statues and icons and services before the relic urns of past monarchs and deceased members of the Royal Family. The cremation services last for 6 days (from the Friday before up to the Wednesday following). In the past, state funerals lasted a whole 2 weeks (14 days long). Once everything is set for cremation as per Buddhist and Hindu customs, the cremation proper begins with one final late-night service for the deceased officially starting the royal cremation services. The services are held in Bangkok at the Grand Palace and its Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall, where the royal remains have been lying in state for a specific period of mourning in a kot (from Sanskrit ko≈õa, meaning \\"container\\") displayed on a decorated pedestal known as ' inside the hall. In recent funerals, a coffin was used instead of the kot to hold the royal remains, but a kot was still displayed near the coffin in keeping with tradition. The services are presided over by HM the King alongside members of the Royal Family, and Buddhist monks are present, performing the offerings of cloth on behalf of the dead, known as sadappakon, and reciting prayers and chants in Pali (and in recent state cremations, Teochew Chinese, due to the attendance of Thai Chinese Buddhist monks from the local community temples). Funeral procession Transporting the King Pinklao's Funerary Urn upon the Royal Chariot of Great Victory Royal funeral ceremony of King Chulalongkorn in 1911 at Sanam Luang, Bangkok. After the final night service, on the cremation day a farewell morning service occurs at the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall of the Grand Palace in Bangkok, where the urn lay in state for a specific time period and had been earlier stripped of its outer decorations. After the morning service and breakfast served for the monks, a squad from 1st Infantry Regiment King's Own Bodyguard's 1st Battalion escort the urn out of the hall and into the gold Triple-Poled Royal Funeral Palanquin Carriage (Phra Yannamat Sam Lam Khan) outside the throne hall while honors are paid by the 3rd Btn, 1st Infantry Regiment (King's Own Bodyguard). As the covered funeral urn is placed on the carriage, an outer sandalwood cover is placed on it and the carriage, alongside a Royal Nine-Tiered Umbrella mounted atop it. After one more salute is rendered to the urn, the pallanquin and the 60 Royal Thai Army personnel handling it move out of the Deva Phirom gate of the Palace from the west wall into Maharaj Road. A royal procession contingent of battalion size awaits the party, including members of the Royal Family, the Prakhom band under the Bureau of the Royal Household and bearers of the royal regalia, flags, banners and golden umbrellas, led by two cavalry troopers of the Royal Thai Police. As the Funeral Pallaquin Carriage meets the party and a member of the royal guards gives the signal via a clapper, the quick funeral march begins on Maharaj Road, turning left towards Tai Wan Alley and then marches towards the southeastern end of the Palace walls. Here a second, larger funeral contingent of regiment size awaits, as well as the Grand Royal Funeral Carriage (Phra Maha Phichai Ratcharot, also named as the Royal Great Victory Carriage) or the Lesser Royal Funeral Carriage (Vejayanta Ratcharot) and the Supreme Patriarch's Minor Royal Carriage (Ratcharot Noi). These are accompanied by the men and monks escorting them by Sanam Chai Street, nearby Wat Pho Temple, Saranrom Park and the Territorial Defense Command Building of the RTAF, at the eastern end of the Palace complex. The King's Guards guard the front and rear of the party and the royal relatives, students and businessmen form the rear contingents. As the first procession proceeds, a first Palanquin Carriage (Phra Saliang Kleebbua) follows with the Supreme Patriarch or his representative on top with monks and 16 handlers escorting the palanquin. Both processions are lined by cadets of the military academies and enlisted personnel and NCOs of the armed forces. A first gun salute follows the procession. The first Gold Triple-Poled Royal Funeral Palanquin Carriage stops near the Grand Royal Funeral Carriage and its handlers unload the urn, transferring it to the royal conveyor pulley (kroen bandai nak) in the presence of the Royal Family, while a second Royal Nine-Tiered Umbrella, larger in size, is mounted. Then the first Gold Triple-Poled Royal Funeral Pallaquin Carriage and its handlers march off. Prayers are then said by monks, and then the urn, escorted by an attendant in traditional uniforms, is transferred to the Grand Royal Funeral Carriage where its 6 escorts, 216 military handlers and 10 pulley staff (plus 48 King's Guards escorts and 16 pole bearers from the first procession) are assembled. Once the urn is placed atop the carriage and is placed on the butsabok (open-sided roofed structure), a Royal Salute is rendered (and the massed military bands play Sansoen Phra Barami for the King and Queen or Maha Chai for senior members of the royal family). Two additional attendants say prayers at the south and north of the urn, while the Supreme Patriarch (or in his absence his representative) mounts the Ratcharot Noi carrying Buddhist scriptures to read while 74 military handlers pull the ropes. With a clapper sounded and the bugler playing a bugle call, the slow royal funeral march starts with the Traditional Band playing traditional songs and the massed bands playing the slow funeral march Phayasok, composed by His late Royal Highness Prince Nagor Svarga. The Royal Family proceeds at the rear of the funeral carriage, which moves along Sanam Chai Street, then forward across Ratchadamnoen Avenue and towards the Sanam Luang Royal Square and the crematorium area in either the southern or northern portion of the field (where the funeral urn is stationed). During the entire march, a 21-gun salute is fired, at one-minute intervals, by the 1st Artillery Regiment King's Guard if the King or Queen is being cremated (19 for senior members of the Royal Family). Following the royal urn are senior-ranked members of the royal family and the royal pages and attendants, while the urn is preceded by the Prime Minister of Thailand and representatives of the state cabinet. As the royal funeral procession halts on the northwest end of the royal crematorium, the urn is transferred from the Grand Royal Funeral Carriage via a second pulley into either a second Gold Triple-Poled Royal Funeral Palanquin Carriage or to the Royal Gun Carriage (Rajarot Puen Yai) ((for kings who held the title of Head of the Armed Forces or royal family members holding high military ranks in the Royal Thai Armed Forces, a tradition initiated on the wishes of King Vajiravudh in 1926) with a 3rd Royal Nine-Tiered Umbrella attached on it. Upon this happening, the King's Guard render one more Royal Salute as a final procession starts. Most of the remainder of the funeral party, together with the Supreme Patriarch mounted on a second Pallaquin Carriage, march counter-clockwise encircling the crematorium (Merumas after the Hindu-Buddhist Mount Meru) thrice, ending on the third march around. The carriage is unloaded, the urn is placed at a pulley with an escorting attendant, and transferred to a special funeral pyre inside the building while two piphat ensembles play traditional funeral music.  Cremation proper  King Bhumibol Adulyadej offering of sandalwood flowers for royal cremation of King Ananda Mahidol A further memorial service is held in the late afternoon and in the early evening the ceremonial and symbolic first lighting of the funeral pyre is held. As the Royal Family pay their last respects and place sandalwood flowers on the pyre, preceded by the buglers playing the Last Post, the 1st and 3rd Battalions, 1st Infantry Regiment \\"King's Own Bodyguards\\", and the 5th Battalion, 11th Infantry Regiment, King's Guard all mount one last Royal Salute, followed by a three-volley rifle salute and the gun salute as the band plays Phayasok one final time. Designated areas around Bangkok and nationwide offer the general public and tourists to place the traditional sandalwood flower wreaths as a sign of remembrance while the honor guards march off the crematorium area. At around 10pm the cremation proper starts as the urn or coffin of the deceased is transferred, since 2008, to the hydraulic tappet pyre east of the funeral pyre for cremation while the outer covering of the urn is removed beforehand. At this time, to mark the end of the mourning period traditional Thai dances and opera are performed (a tradition reinstated in 1995).  Post-cremation period  King Bhumibol Adulyadej present robes to monks for collecting the Royal Relics of King Ananda Mahidol On the day after the cremation, representatives of the Royal Family receive a memorial urn (phra kot phra atthi) with select ashes and relics (atthi) of the deceased mixed with flower petals, with a second urn (pha-op) carrying the rest of the royal ashes (sarirangkhan) . Both are obtained from the cremation pyre, and prayers and monastic robes are offered first before both the relics and ashes are removed from the pyre. As the urn is enthroned at the monastic pavilion, a breakfast service is held and the Royal Family thanks all the monks who led and assisted in the memorial services. After this, one more procession on the Gold Royal Four-poled Funeral Pallaquin (Rajendrayan, only for the King) or the Gold Triple-Poled Royal Funeral Pallaquin Carriage (for senior-ranked royalty) carries the sacred urns with the ashes and relics from the Sanam Luang Square to the Dustin Maha Prasat Throne Hall of the Grand Palace, where one last memorial service is held the following day for the royal relics, and to the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. This is followed by the transfer of the sacred urn to the Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall where it will be enthroned, ending the cremation services. To signify this, the Royal Family wears their ceremonial uniforms at this time, and not black dresses or black armbands with white court dress. The public also follows suit by wearing normal clothes. One final service is held later at an important royal temple in Bangkok (for the King or Queen) or for senior or junior-ranked members of the Royal Family at the Royal Cemetery at Wat Ratchabophit (inside the Wat Ratchabophit complex itself), where the rest of the ashes are interred in the Royal Family's presence. In recent years, the final procession to the interment temple is a motorized one, with a ceremonial mounted troop from the 29th Cavalry Squadron, King's Guard escorting the vehicle where the royal ashes are carried, which before departure had been loaded from the Temple of the Emerald Buddha where these had been temporarily placed on the day following the royal cremation. As a reminder of this, the Sanam Luang crematorium will be later dismantled and the decorations and awards of the deceased removed from the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall, together with the wreaths that had been placed on the funeral pedestal before.

There are many color variants across the range of the species, originally considered subspecies but no longer recognized; while there is a history of recognizing subspecies within many of the Vespa hornets, the most recent taxonomic revision of the genus treats all subspecific names in the genus Vespa as synonyms, effectively relegating them to no more than informal names for regional color forms.A.H.

It has a versatile diet of both carbohydrates such as tree sap, nectar, fruits and larvae saliva and proteinaceous food such as carrion, paper wasps (Polistinae) and bees (Apidae)). Its diet is mainly composed of liquid foods such as nectar from flowers. It also eats bees and collects meat from freshly dead insects. In Singapore it preys on flies attracted to carrion.‚ÄúVespa affinis‚Äù at http://www.vespa-bicolor.net/main/vespid/vespa-affinis.htm. Accessed on 01.10.2017.Barth√©l√©my, C. (2008).

Nests built in high trees are generally elongated. In tropical areas the nest is pear-shaped or drop- shaped, but in subtropical regions it is oval with a rounded top. Small nests are ball shaped with a side entrance while larger nests are vertically elongated and may have multiple entrances. The nests have an imbricate envelope with many individual overlapping circular layers of papering. It can reach more than 60 cm in length in tropical regions.‚ÄúVespa affinis‚Äù at http://www.vespa-bicolor.net/main/vespid/vespa-affinis.htm. Accessed on 01.10.2017.Barth√©l√©my, C. (2008).

Fenn founded the Montanans for Children, Youth and Families in 1978, and framed the 1972 Montana State Constitution setting forth rights for children, a bill that became a model for other state constitutions. Early life Fenn was born on April 1, 1912, and grew up in a farm in Brookings, South Dakota. She graduated from Brookings High School, and then attended South Dakota State College. In 1929 she was a delegate to the National 4-H Congress in Chicago. In 1933 Fenn graduated with honors in home economics and music from South Dakota State University, obtained a master's degree from George Washington University, Washington, D.C., and did post- graduate works at Colorado State University, Cornell University, New York School for Social Research and Montana State University. Later in life Fenn was honored as a distinguished alumnus (in 1965) and received an honorary doctor of humanities degree (in 1971) by the South Dakota State University. Career At first Fenn taught music and home economics in Castlewood, South Dakota, later becoming principal of the school. She subsequently joined the 4-H International program at South Dakota State University. In 1946 she moved to Montana State University. Fenn was with Montana State University from 1946 to 1967, later becoming associate professor emeritus. She was head of 4-H international programs and acted as Extension liaison with the Peace Corps. In 1950 she was a visiting youth specialist in home economics in Germany and in the 1960s she trained with the Peace Corps volunteers in Ecuador. Due to her work in international education, Montana State University sent one of the first delegates on the International Farm Youth Exchanges program to Europe soon after World War II. Fenn advocated equality for all people, and supported racial integration and the rights of children. In 1953 she visited 12 countries to study the impact of International Cultural Exchange Program participants once they returned home and she often entertained international families in her home. In 1986 she was honored at the national International Cultural Exchange Program. In 1964 she assisted with the Project Lessons project on Race Relations. In particular she highlighted the many Native American things that have been absorbed into the common culture, agricultural products, medicines, type of government, love of outdoors and games. She retired in 1967 and served on Montana's Human Resource Council until 1977. She founded the People Partner Program in 1975, administered by the Montana 4-H Foundation to help youth groups working on community projects. She participated at the Encampment for Citizenship, a program bringing together children from mainstream America, African Americans, and other minorities. Fenn in particular advocated for inclusion of children from Montana, including Native American children, and in 1967 she managed to have the encampment in Great Falls, Montana. In 1969 she was appointed as Community Planning Coordinator for the first project of the new Montana Council on Human Resources. Her task was to facilitate Montana's efforts with children and youth in connection with the 1970 White House program. Working with youth and families since 1933, in 1978 she founded the Montanans for Children, Youth and Families. She became the director and unpaid executive secretary of the association. The pushing factor for founding the association was the 1977 Legislature that did not fund the Montana Advisory Council on Children and Youth of which Fenn was the secretary for since 1969. In 1980 she was a delegate to the White House conference on families. In 2002 she was inducted into the National 4-H Hall of Fame. She received the Epsilon Sigma Phi distinguished alumnus award. Personal life Fenn died in Bozeman, Montana, in 1989, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery, Brookings, South Dakota. Legacy The Gerry Fenn library was established in 1986 and is part of the Montana State University Women's Center. At her death she left a sizeable estate to two associations: $134,957 to the Montana 4-H Foundation with the interest to be used in perpetuity to provide support for the International 4-H Youth Exchange and People Partners. Fenn established the Geraldine Fenn Scholarship Fund for home economics at South Dakota State University.

He travelled to the United States in 1870 and spent most of his career in Northern California where he lived from 1876 until 1903. Many of his paintings were destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. However, the Oakland Museum and the Crocker Art Museum hold two of his landscapes and several more are held in private collections. Life and career Perbandt was born into an aristocratic German-speaking family in Langendorf, East Prussia. He studied painting under Andreas Achenbach and Carl Friedrich Lessing at the D√ºsseldorf Academy, although his determination to become an artist and his refusal to pursue a military career displeased his family. In 1859 he married Maria Treusch von Buttlar-Brandenfels. The couple had two sons, Conradin and Martin. After he served in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, Perbandt and his family went to live on his brother's estate in Falkenhorst, East Prussia. Shortly thereafter he left Prussia \\"under a cloud\\", leaving his wife and children behind. He went first to the east coast of the United States where he was based in New York City and is known to have produced landscape paintings of scenes in New Jersey, Vermont, and Ulster County, New York.Lekisch, Barbara (2003).

He travelled and painted with Jules Tavernier in Monterey and eventually settled in San Francisco in 1877 where at times he shared a studio with Henry Raschen (1854-1937). Raschen was born in Prussia but had emigrated with his family to California when he was a boy. Perbandt and Raschen also travelled together \\"living the bohemian life\\" and painting scenes in Northern California, particularly Sonoma, Humboldt, and Mendocino counties. For a while, they lived in Fort Ross among the Pomo Indians and shared a studio there. In his later years in San Francisco he continued to produce panoramic views of the city and the Golden Gate. After Perbandt's wife died in 1903, he returned to Prussia and lived there until his death in 1911. Many of the paintings he left behind in San Francisco were lost in the 1906 earthquake.

It was originally published in 1970 and is considered to be a bestseller. Set in 1887, it chronicles Anna Brett's scandalous romance with the married ship captain Redvers Stretton. As they sail across the South Seas, tensions build among Anna, Redvers, and everyone else on-board The Serene Lady, and a mystery involving murder, the destruction of ship called The Secret Woman, and a missing fortune of diamonds begins to unravel.  Plot summary  Anna Brett was born in India, due to her father being in the Indian Army, and when she was about eight years old her parents moved her to live in Langmouth, England with her Aunt Charlotte into what is referred to as the Queen's House. While in Langmouth, Anna was educated and began to learn the ways of Aunt Charlotte's antique business as she grew up. On one autumn night, a sailor named Redvers Stretton comes to see Anna and their romantic interest in each other starts to grow. As Aunt Charlotte grows older and weaker, she hires a nurse, Chantel Loman, to look after her. Chantel seems to brighten up the normally dreary Queen's House and quickly becomes close friends with Anna. Then one morning, Chantel finds Charlotte dead from an opium tablet overdose. Because she would have benefited from Charlotte's death, people suspect Anna of killing her aunt, but Chantel successfully defends her and the death is declared a suicide. Chantel takes up a position at the nearby Castle Crediton, caring for Monique Stretton, the wife of Redvers that Anna had not previously known about. Anna discovers she inherited serious debts from Aunt Charlotte and decides to sell her antique furniture and rent out the Queen's House. During her time at the castle Chantel and Rex Crediton, Redvers‚Äô half-brother, begin spending a lot of time together. She finds out that Rex and Monique are going to sail on Redvers‚Äô ship The Serene Lady to Australia and Monique's home island of Coralle. Chantel helps get Anna hired as Red's son Edward's governess while they are away. During the voyage, Edward gets drugged and Anna suspects someone onboard had been planning on throwing him overboard, but most of the passengers assume it was just a prank. Once the ship arrives on the island of Coralle, Red declares his love to Anna and gives her a letter asking for her to wait to be with him just before he departs. There is an increasing sense of tension and doom during Anna and Chantel's two-month stay on the island; Monique grows more and more distraught and angry over the thought that Red doesn‚Äôt love her, and Anna finds out that Chantel had married Rex before they set sail. Upon The Serene Lady‚Äôs return, Chantel gives Anna a long letter explaining that she had been plotting to take over Castle Crediton and that she had in fact been responsible for Aunt Charlotte's death. In order for Chantel and Rex to inherit the castle and the family riches, both Red and Edward would have to be dead, so Chantel had drugged Edward on the ship in an attempt to kill him, but the plan failed. Then, on Coralle, Chantel had poisoned some coffee Monique was going to give Red in order to frame his wife for his murder, but Chantel accidentally drinks the coffee herself and dies. Anna returns to England and continues to be Edward's governess until he begins attending school. She then returns to the Queen's House and one of her maids informs her that Monique died on the island of Coralle. Red returns to England so that he and Anna can finally begin their life together.

Since its initial release several other versions of it have been made; the most recent publication was done by Sourcebooks Casablanca of Sourcebooks, Inc. in Naperville, Illinois in 2014.  Success  The Secret Woman is considered a bestseller of 1970, along with Erich Segal‚Äôs Love Story and John Fowles‚Äô The French Lieutenant‚Äôs Woman. The book's success was likely also bolstered by the success of Hibbert's previous novels such as Mistress of Mellyn and The Shivering Sands. The positive reception of these works eventually gave Hibbert the title of ‚ÄúQueen of Romantic Suspense‚Äù and driving the sales of Victoria Holt novels to over 56 million copies worldwide.

Frank Dobson, MP for Holborn and St. Pancras, was selected to stand, defeating former Leader of the Greater London Council Ken Livingstone and Glenda Jackson, MP for Hampstead and Highgate. Livingstone went on to run as an independent candidate in the Mayoral election, defeating Dobson, who came third behind Conservative candidate Steven Norris. Selection process The Labour candidate was selected via an Electoral College of Labour Party MPs, MEPs, GLA candidates, members and affiliated unions. Individual London Labour members were invited to vote via a postal ballot. Affiliated unions were not obliged to ballot members; instead some cast block votes (plumped for one candidate). Candidates *Frank Dobson, Member of Parliament for Holborn and St. Pancras since 1979; Secretary of State for Health, 1997‚Äì1999. * Ken Livingstone, Member of Parliament for Brent East since 1987; Leader of the Greater London Council, 1981‚Äì1986. *Glenda Jackson, Member of Parliament for Hampstead and Highgate since 1992. Result Livingstone won amongst party members (60% to Dobson's 40%) and among affiliated unions (72% to Dobson's 28%, a more than 2:1 vote). Dobson's landslide victory (173:27 in ratio) amongst the systemic third of votes attributed to MPs, MEPS and GLA candidates saw him win narrowly overall: forming a simple electoral college outcome of 52% to 48%. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" + First round - style=\\"background-color:#E9E9E9\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\" scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" width=\\"125\\"  Candidate ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" width=\\"65\\" Elected members (33.3%) ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" width=\\"65\\"  Individual members (33.3%) ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" width=\\"65\\" Affiliated supporters (33.3%) ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"2\\" width=\\"75\\" Total -style=\\"background- color:#E9E9E9; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\\" -align=\\"right\\"  style=\\"background-color: \\"   scope=\\"row\\" align=\\"left\\"  Frank Dobson  86.5%  35.3%  26.9%  align=center   49.6% -align=\\"right\\"  style=\\"background- color: \\"   scope=\\"row\\" align=\\"left\\" Ken Livingstone  12.2%  54.9%  71.0%  align=center   46.0% -align=\\"right\\"  style=\\"background-color: \\"   scope=\\"row\\" align=\\"left\\" Glenda Jackson  1.4%  9.8%  2.1%  align=center   4.4% } { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" + Second round - style=\\"background-color:#E9E9E9\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\" scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" width=\\"125\\"  Candidate ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" width=\\"65\\" Elected members (33.3%) ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" width=\\"65\\"  Individual members (33.3%) ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" width=\\"65\\" Affiliated supporters (33.3%) ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"2\\" width=\\"75\\" Total -style=\\"background- color:#E9E9E9; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\\" -align=\\"right\\"  style=\\"background-color: \\"   scope=\\"row\\" align=\\"left\\"  Frank Dobson  86.5%  40.1%  28.0%  align=center   51.5% -align=\\"right\\"  style=\\"background- color: \\"   scope=\\"row\\" align=\\"left\\" Ken Livingstone  13.5%  59.9%  72.0%  align=center   48.5% } Aftermath Livingstone described the result as \\"tainted\\" because the election system gave greater weight to the votes of London Labour MPs, MEPs, & GLA candidates, rather than rank-and-file party members and decided to contest the election as an Independent.

The best documented famine in the Iranian history, it affected almost the whole country, however some cities managed to avoid the catastrophe, including Shahrud, Kerman and Birjand. Causes and contributing factors Xavier de Planhol comments that the famine was a result of \\"combined climatic catastrophes made worse by poor administration and the human factors\\". Shoko Okazaki maintains that the two consecutive years of severe drought was the principal factor and rejects that the increase in production of opium and cotton contributed to the famine. He also blames \\"senior bureaucrats, landlords, grain dealers and high-ranking religious officials who engaged in hoarding and market manipulation\\". Cormac √ì Gr√°da endorses the latter reason. Death toll There is no agreement among scholars as to the total number of deaths during the famine, although it is believed that it resulted a considerable decline in Iran's population. Among contemporary observers, Frederic John Goldsmid gave the figure of 0.2‚Äì0.3 million deaths, while Oliver St. John put the total loss at 0.5 million. James Bassett suggested that 3 million lives were lost and J. Belleu who was travelling in Iran during the period, cited 1.5 million. Badaye-negar, a Persian scholar of the time, estimated 2.5 million deaths. Fereydun Adamiyat calculates the death toll around 2 million deaths. Another calculation attributes a decline in the estimated population from 10 million in 1850 to 6 million in 1873, to the catastrophe. Gad G. Gilbar's estimation of 1.5 million deaths, which could be between 15% to 20‚Äì25% of the population, is acknowledged by Shoko Okazaki and Charles P. Melville.

Her first book, Women in War: The Micro-level Processes of Mobilization in El Salvador, is about the role that women played in the Salvadoran Civil War of 1979-1992. It is based on interviews with woman who joined the Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front. Viterna shows that women were initially recruited from the Catholic Church and the peasantry, but later joined the FMNLF to avoid rape. She also shows that women who \\"became organizers in the refugee camps\\" or \\"guerrilla leaders\\" fared better. In a review for the European Review of Latin American and Caribbean Studies, Ralph Sprenkels of Utrecht University suggests Viterna should have delved into the tension between \\"the well-positioned urban minority and the peasant majority inside the FMNLF and its implications for gender roles.\\" However, Sprenkels concludes that the book is \\"a remarkable feat\\" and \\"essential reading for anyone interested in El Salvador's civil war, as well as for students of gender, political and social movements.\\" Reviewing it for Social Forces, David Smilde highlights confusing statements about the occurrence of rape in refugee camps. He also notes that Viterna could have spent more time analyzing the status of \\"non-combatants.\\" Personal life With Jason Beckfield, who is the chair of the Sociology department at Harvard University, she has two children.

The company claims that ¬£323 billion of gold and silver was shipped by the British government between 1914 and 1945. A number of these merchant vessels were sunk by German U-boats during the first and second world wars, and the company aims to locate these sunken vessels and retrieve their cargoes. Research The company claims to have spent 25 years researching lost war-time vessels. Via this research on war-risk insurance payouts and cross-referencing the vessels with insurance records they have identified some 700 vessels that contain bullion. The bullion was being transported to The United States and members of the British Commonwealth to pay for war materials. The company estimates that some 2000 tons of precious metals (mainly gold and silver bullion) was sunk from ships that mainly left from Glasgow and Liverpool. Retrieval The company has not revealed details of which port they are based for security reasons. The first exploration they intend to survey is a group of two first world war and a single second world war British merchant ships sunk by German U-boats whilst en route to Canada. The company has built a special vessel that allows the crew to remain directly over the sunken vessels. From this ship the crew will lower submersibles (to depths of 5,500m) to investigate the ships and prepare for the next stage of retrieving the precious metals. The cost of the first expedition is estimated at ¬£15 million. As the bullion remains in the ownership of the British Government the company will need to negotiate how the retrieved bullion is brough back to the UK. Since 1914 all British warships sunk are classified as both war graves and sovereign territory, merchant vessel wrecks however do not have the same legal protection. Financial backing Britannia's Gold Ltd is backed by private investment but it is also crowd-sourcing an initial ¬£8 million to conduct the first surveys.

It covers an area of 6550 hectares between the communes of Saint-Sa√´ns and Dampierre-Saint-Nicolas, about 20 km south-east of Dieppe and not far from Neufch√¢tel-en-Bray. The village of Ventes-Saint-R√©my is located in the centre of a clearing.  Toponymy  Eawy (pronounced IPA [eavi], but previously <√©vi> [evi]) is an Old French term, derived from the noun eve, ewe an old form of the French word eau, meaning here \\"wet\\".  Natural environment  The forest borders a large ridge which separates the Varenne in the SW from the B√©thune in the NE; it is a small limestone plateau, varying in altitude between 130 and 230 metres, descending in a convex slope to the Varenne. Although the forest is not crossed by any watercourse, the flint clay which covers the limestone retains a fair amount of moisture. Previously an oak plantation, it was transformed into a beech grove in the 19th century by the forestry workers. Thus it now mainly comprises beeches (Fagus sylvatica); there are also some oaks, hornbeams, ashes, wild cherry and sycamore maples. The forest is crossed, at its centre, by the All√©e des Limousins, a mostly straight clearing 14 km long and 20 to 30 metres wide, cut in the 16th century by Gabriel de Limoges.  Climate  There is an oceanic climate, with mean annual precipitation of 950 mm and a mean annual temperature around 10.1 ¬∞C and a narrow temperature range (4.5 ¬∞C in January, 16.5 ¬∞C in August).  History and exploitation  The Eawy Forest is a vestige of the large forests which covered the region in the first millennium AD, but has suffered great clearances. Owned by the Dukes of Normandy, it was seriously damaged during the Hundred Years' War. During World War Two, the forest sheltered launching pads for the German V1 rockets targeting London. The forest was further damaged by these military installations and by Allied bombing. The damaged areas were replanted with conifers after the war. The Eawy forest was long a source of wealth for the inhabitants of the region, providing wood for many sawmills and glassworks. The quality of the oak wood drew many wood workers to settle in the nearby villages, starting in the Middle Ages, making wooden chests. In the 16th century, these wood workers constructed recreational houses for the nobility. The desire for luxury furniture in the Italian style led to a heavy demand for their services. Nowadays, families use the forest for walks and cycle rides. It is also used for hunting and for wood. It is well stocked with game (hunting), including red deer, wild boar and roe deer.  Protection  A Natura 2000 zone covers a part of the plateau, at the north (Croc massif) and south (Cusson camp) extremities, with an area of 692 ha. The forests of Eawy and Arques and the Varenne valley are within a zone naturelle d'int√©r√™t √©cologique, faunistique et floristique.  Curiosities  The forest is crossed by the All√©e des Limousins, a straight line for a motorable part of 14 km from Maucomble to Muchedent (Pubel farm). The Saint-Etienne chapel is a chapel of 12m¬≤ located in the middle of the wood in the town of Rosay, Seine- Maritime. The P√®re Antoine is a hundred year old beech with an exceptional circumference located at Les Grandes-Ventes.

Plowman Idora Elizabeth McClellan Plowman Moore (October 31, 1843 - February 26, 1929) was an American author, \\"one of the first Alabama writers to recognize the pecuniary aspects of local-color writing.\\" She wrote using the pen-name Betsy Hamilton. Early life Idora Elizabeth McClellan Plowman was born near Talladega, Alabama, on October 31, 1844. She was the daughter of Gen. William Blount McClellan (1798-1881) and Martha Thompson Roby (1809-1858). Her father traced the lineage of his family to William Wallace, of Scotland. He was a graduate of West Point, and before the Civil War held the office of Brigadier-General, commanding the militia troops of the counties of Talladega, Clay and Randolph in Alabama. Career Idora M. Plowman, A woman of the century She was known by her pen-name \\"Betsy Hamilton.\\" Betsy Hamilton was the author of innumerable dialect sketches depicting the humorous side of life, life as seen by herself on the old time plantations, and in the backwoods among the class denominated as Southern \\"Crackers.\\" Her first sketch, \\"Betsy's Trip to Town,\\" written in 1872, was printed in the Talladega Alabama Reporter and reprinted in many newspapers and magazines, including the New York Sun. After the death of her husband in 1878, she was regularly engaged for a number of years on the great southern weekly, Sunny South and on the Atlanta Constitution, papers published in Atlanta, Georgia. Her articles were entitled \\"The Backwoods,\\" \\"Familiar Letters,\\" and \\"Betsy Hamilton to Her Cousin Saleny.\\" At the personal request of S.S. Conant, the editor of Harper's Weekly, several of her sketches went to that paper, and were illustrated as they appeared in its columns. Henry W. Grady of the Atlanta Constitution was her warm personal friend and aided much in bringing her talent before the world. Her articles have been copied in some of the European papers. When her father died in 1881 she had to support herself and taught school for a time. While the \\"Betsy Hamilton Sketches\\" gave their author a wide fame and deserved popularity, doubtless her most popular achievements were her public recitations and impersonations. One writer compared her to the comedian Joe Jefferson. She performed in Eatonton, Georgia, New York City, Auburn, Alabama, Oklahoma and South Carolina. In 1921 she released a limited edition of her sketches, Betsy Hamilton: Southern Character Sketches, through the J.S. Dickert Printing Company in Atlanta. Later in life she devoted much of her time to the Alabama Synodical Orphans Home at Talladega, where she established the Betsy Hamilton Scholarship Fund for the education of outstanding students. Personal life On December 19, 1866, Idora Elizabeth McClellan and lawyer Albert White Plowman (1838-1868) of Talladega were married. Her husband died suddenly after a few years of marriage. On 14 March 1892, Plowman married in Atlanta, Georgia, Capt. Martin Van Buren Moore (1837-1900), of the editorial staff of the Atlanta Constitution. They moved to Auburn, Alabama. She died on February 26, 1929, in Talladega and is buried at Oak Hill Cemetery.

Studies crossing the vertical line are inconclusive. Here the summary (and two individual studies) shows that the treatment prevented babies from dying. Further studies like these are not needed. The phrases \\"further research is needed\\" (FRIN), \\"more research is needed\\" and other variants are commonly used in research papers. The clich√© is so common that it has attracted research, regulation and cultural commentary.  Meaning  Some research journals have banned the phrase \\"more research is needed\\" on the grounds that it is redundant; it is almost always true and fits almost any article, and so can be taken as understood. A 2004 metareview by the Cochrane collaboration of their own systematic medical reviews found that 93% of the reviews studied made indiscriminate FRIN-like statements, reducing their ability to guide future research. The presence of FRIN had no correlation with the strength of the evidence against the medical intervention. Authors who thought a treatment was useless were just as likely to recommend researching it further. Indeed, authors may recommend \\"further research\\" when, given the existing evidence, further research would be extremely unlikely to be approved by an ethics committee. Studies finding that a treatment has no noticeable effects are sometimes greeted with statements that \\"more research is needed\\" by those convinced that the treatment is effective, but the effect has not yet been found. Since even the largest study can never rule out an infinitesimally small effect, an effect can only ever be shown to be insignificant, not non- existent. Similarly, Trish Greenhalgh, Professor of Primary Care Health Sciences at the University of Oxford, argues that FRIN is often used as a way in which a \\"[l]ack of hard evidence to support the original hypothesis gets reframed as evidence that investment efforts need to be redoubled\\", and a way to avoid upsetting hopes and vested interests. She has also described FRIN as \\"an indicator that serious scholarly thinking on the topic has ceased\\", saying that \\"it is almost never the only logical conclusion that can be drawn from a set of negative, ambiguous, incomplete or contradictory data.\\"  Addressing the issue  Further research on the Piltdown man was once needed. Academic journal editors were banning unqualified FRIN statements as early as 1990, requiring more specific information such as what types of research were needed, and what questions they ought to address. Researchers themselves have strongly recommended that research articles detail what research is needed. Other commentators suggest that articles would benefit by assessing the likely value of possible further research. Greenhalgh suggests that, because vague FRIN statements are an argument that \\"tomorrow's research investments should be pitched into precisely the same patch of long grass as yesterday's\\", funding should be refused to those making them. She and others argue that more thought and research is needed into methods for determining where more research is needed.  Example  Both the needfulness and needlessness of further research may be overlooked. The blobbogram leading this article is from a systematic review; it shows clinical trials of the use of corticosteroids to hasten lung development in pregnancies where a baby is likely to be born prematurely. Long after there was enough evidence to show that this treatment saved babies' lives, the evidence was not widely known, the treatment was not widely used, and further research was done into the same question. After the review made the evidence better known, the treatment was used more, preventing thousands of pre-term babies from dying of infant respiratory distress syndrome. However, when the treatment was rolled out in lower- and middle-income countries, more pre-term babies died. It is thought that this may be because of a higher risk of infection, which is more likely to kill a baby in places with poor medical care and more malnourished mothers. The current version of the review states that there is \\"little need\\" for further research into the usefulness of the treatment in higher-income countries, but further research is needed on optimal dosage and on how to best treat lower-income and higher-risk mothers.  In culture  The idea that research papers always end with some variation of FRIN was described as an \\"old joke\\" in a 1999 epidemiology editorial. FRIN has been advocated as a motto for life, applicable everywhere except research papers; printed on T-shirts; and satirized by the \\"Collectively Unconscious\\" blog, which reported that an article in the journal Science had concluded that \\"no further research is needed, at all, anywhere, ever\\".

It was first minted using the design by Benedetto Pistrucci in 1820 under the reign of George III and never entered circulation, instead being considered a pattern coin. As a precursor to the modern decimalised ¬£2 coin it shares a similar diameter of 28.4 mm. History The history of double sovereigns can be traced back to 1485 when larger sovereign coins were minted using dies of the standard English sovereign, although not entering circulation they are thought to have been for presentation purposes as piedfort coins.Royal Mint Piedforts Following the introducing of the new British sovereign coin in 1817, a special proof double sovereign was minted in 1820 however like the previous double sovereign it never entered general circulation. In 1887 for Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee another double sovereign was issued, this time entering circulation for the first time. A two pound coin was an occasional feature of the British currency from 1823 until 1996, but has been minted every year since 1997. With the exception of proof coins issued in 1824, 1825, 1826, and 1831, the design of the reverse always featured the George and Dragon of Benedetto Pistrucci, with the year in the exergue under the design. 19th century The coin was normally issued in cased \\"proof\\" condition, although the issues of 1823, 1887, 1893, and 1902 did circulate. The normal weight of the denomination was 16 grams, with a usual diameter of 28 millimetres. The first appearance of the denomination was in 1820 during the final year of the reign of George III. This rare piece was not struck for circulation but only as a pattern. The obverse shows the bust of the king facing right and wearing a wreath, and bears the legend GEORGIUS III D G BRITANNIARUM REX F D 1820. The reverse has no legend and shows the Pistrucci design. The coin first appeared as a 'currency' or circulating coin in 1823 during the reign of George IV. The legend on this coin reads GEORGIUS IIII D G BRITANNIAR REX F D. The date and Pistrucci's George and the Dragon appear on the reverse and DECUS ET TUTAMEN ANNO REGNI IV on the edge. The obverse portrait of the king was designed by Jean Baptiste Merlen. This designer is known primarily for his reverses, with the portrait of the 1823 Two Pounds being the only obverse he engraved, using as a basis a model by Sir Francis Chantrey. Apparently, Pistrucci was unwilling to work from the model of another artist. The quality of the strike was exceptional, producing what some consider to be the most beautiful two pound piece ever produced. The reverse of this coin by Pistrucci has been the basis for the design of this denomination right up to the present day (2009 being the most recent). The 1824-1826 proof coins feature a smaller head of the king, with the legend GEORGIUS IV DEI GRATIA and the date, while the reverse shows a crowned shield within a mantle cape with the legend BRITANNIARUM REX FID DEF. The 1826 coin has the edge inscription DECUS ET TUTAMEN ANNO REGNI SEPTIMO. In 1831 a proof coin of this denomination was produced for the start of the reign of king William IV. The obverse shows a right-facing head of the king with the legend GULIELMUS IIII D G BRITANNIAR REX F D, while the reverse shows a crowned shield with the legend ANNO 1831. There is no edge inscription. The next appearance of the denomination was not until the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887. The Jubilee head was used with the obverse inscription VICTORIA D G BRIT REG F D, while the reverse shows Pistrucci's design of St George slaying the dragon with the only legend being the date in the exergue. The edge of this coin is milled, and it weighs 16 grams. This coin was also (rarely) produced in the mint at Sydney, Australia, which is identified by the letter \\"S\\" above the centre of the date. The Pistrucci reverse was used again in 1893, when the obverse used the \\"Old Head\\" of the queen, with the legend VICTORIA DEI GRA BRITT REGINA FID DEF IND IMP, and the edge is again milled. 20th century In the reign of King Edward VII, ¬£2 coins were issued in 1902 and did circulate. The 1902 Edward VII coin was also minted at Sydney, being identified by an \\"S\\" above the centre of the date. For George V and George VI, ¬£2 coins were only issued in proof sets in the first year of each reign. In the case of Edward VIII's short reign, it was only prepared for approval, which is why his coin is valued at around ¬£175,000. All these four reigns used the Pistrucci George and Dragon obverse with milled edges. The reign of Queen Elizabeth II saw a departure from the normal practice in issuing gold coinage. A small number of gold ¬£2 pieces were struck in 1953 in order to provide continuity of the series, but the striking was not released to the public, with the result that they are now valued at around ¬£75,000. No further ¬£2 gold pieces were struck until 1980. Since then they have been issued somewhat haphazardly in most years. Coins from 1980 to 1984 use the Arnold Machin effigy of the Queen, while the 1985-1996 coins use the Raphael Maklouf effigy and most later coins use the Ian Rank-Broadley effigy. Until 1993, all these years use the Pistrucci reverse except for 1986 which used a gold version of the circulating ¬£2 coin, and 1989 when a completely new design was used to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the first issue of the sovereign coin: the obverse shows the Queen seated on the coronation throne holding the orb and sceptre, with the legend ELIZABETH II DEI GRA REG FID DEF, while the reverse shows a crowned shield within a double rose and the legend ANNIVERSARY OF THE GOLD SOVEREIGN 1489-1989. Double sovereigns continue to be struck by the Royal Mint as bullion coins, with some struck to proof quality for coin collectors, and continue to be legal tender. In 2017 a limited number of piedforts of the standard-size sovereign were minted to mark the 200th anniversary of the British sovereign coin, with the special Garter obverse design; they had the diameter of a sovereign but the weight and gold content of a double sovereign, due to their double-thickness. Piedforts were again coined in 2018 and 2019, in decreasing mintages. Circulating ¬£2 coin Since 1986 circulating ¬£2 coins have been produced in cupronickel, and strikings in gold of some variants of these circulating coins have been struck also, for commemorative purposes/collectors.

It was a failed attempt by combined Irish Royalist and Confederate forces to capture the capital of Dublin which was held by English Republican forces under Michael Jones. It was part of a strategy by Duke of Ormonde, head of an alliance loyal to Charles II, to seize the remaining foothold of Ireland still under the control of the London Parliament. The siege was abandoned following a decisive defeat at the Battle of Rathmines, followed soon afterwards by the arrival of Oliver Cromwell and fresh reinforcements. Background Michael Jones had controlled Dublin since 1647, which had functioned as the base of operations for his forces and their Irish Protestant allies. The execution of Charles I and the declaration of England as a Republic in early 1649 rapidly changed the situation in Ireland. Groups of former enemies now joined forces, pledging allegiance to the Prince of Wales as Charles II. Amongst the factions who joined this coalition were the Catholic Irish Confederates and the Protestant Scottish Covenanters as well as the remnants of the traditional Royal Irish Army The Lord Lieutenant Ormonde returned from exile in France to lead the Royalist alliance, and much of Ireland was rapidly brought under his control. Before long the Republicans were pushed back to the strongholds of Derry, Dundalk and Dublin. Only the assistance of the Ulster Army of the Irish Confederates, led by the renegade Owen Roe O'Neill who had refused to agree terms with Ormonde, prevented Derry falling when it was besieged. Approach On 1 June, Ormonde gathered a substantial force close to Carlow. Once he was joined on 14 June by Lord Inchiquin with troops from Cork he began his march north. Ormonde remained concerned about the threat posed by Owen O'Neill's Ulster Army. He ordered Lord Castlehaven to seize several Leinster towns garrisoned by the Ulster forces, forcing O'Neill to retreat some distance from Dublin. Ormonde established his staging post for the siege at Finglas, having come via Naas. He accepted a proposal from Inchiquin that he lead a detachment north to take out some of the remaining Republican garrisons to prevent them from offering any assistance to Jones in Dublin. Inchiquin, who had a reputation of boldness, moved northwards and captured Drogheda on 11 July. His next target was the port of Dundalk which was held by George Monck. Inchiquin routed a relief column of the Ulster Army under Richard O'Farrell coming to the aid of Monck. After barely two days of siege, the garrison mutinied and switched sides, handing the town over to the Royalist cause. Before returning to rejoin Ormonde, Inchiquin took several other towns including Trim, Newry and Carlingford. Siege preparations Ormonde moved to try and blockade Dublin Harbour, to prevent any further supplies or reinforcements from reaching Jones and his garrison. Proceeding cautiously, he did not attempt an immediate all-out assault in Dublin. He was increasingly short of money with which to pay his troops. Inchiquin had pressed for a direct attack, but Ormonde hoped that members of the garrison might defect to him. Ormonde was concerned about reports of a major expedition under Oliver Cromwell that was being readied to sail for Ireland. Worried that their first target would be to land at Cork, Ormonde dispatched Inchiquin with reinforcements to strengthen the southern coast. In his absence, Ormonde relied on his deputies Castlehaven, Thomas Preston and Lord Taaffe for advice. The blockade of Dublin was constantly disrupted by Jones, who launched raids against the besiegers' lines. Meanwhile a planned Royalist naval blockade under Prince Rupert never materialized because his fleet was itself blockaded in Kinsale by the Republican navy. On 25 July Ormonde shifted his forces, the bulk of which marched to Rathmines to the south of the city while Lord Dillon with 2,500 men remained poised to the north of Dublin. On 28 July Ormonde's troops stormed Rathfarnham Castle located on the southern approach to the city. Ormonde also seized the remains of Baggotrath Castle which had recently been partially destroyed by the city's defenders. He planned to use the site for a large artillery battery. Battle On the morning of 2 August Jones sallied out of Dublin with a combined force of infantry and cavalry. Having initially defeated the Royalist advance guard at Baggotrath he then marched on the main Royalist camp at Rathgar. A surprised Ormonde tried to rally his troops, but the battle quickly turned into a rout. Ormonde's artillery train and supplies were captured. Aftermath After his disastrous defeat at Rathmines, Ormonde abandoned the siege entirely and hastily withdrew to Kilkenny. On 15 August, Oliver Cromwell landed close to Dublin with a large force of New Model Army troops, launching a major campaign to subdue the royalist resistance in Ireland. Jones was acclaimed in London for his victory, but died the same year from fever. Dublin remained a garrison town in Republican hands until 1660 when it returned to royal control following the Irish Restoration. The events of 1649 were often revived in the following years as various figures sought to prove that they had been loyal to Charles during the siege operations when seeking to have lands restored by the Court of Claims.

The office holder is elected annually by the members of the Council. The incumbent is Joe Kavanagh (FG). History of office In 1199 there is a record of the appointment of a Provost of Cork, as chief magistrate of the city. From 1273 under Edward I there were Mayors of Cork, the first record of the office (as Mayor of Cork) is in a charter granted to the city by Edward II in 1318. The title was changed to Lord Mayor in a charter issued by Queen Victoria on 9 July 1900; unlike his counterparts, the Lord Mayor of Dublin and the Lord Mayor of Belfast, the Cork Lord Mayor was not entitled to title The Right Honourable. The title Lord Mayor defines the power of a city when compared to other towns and cities around the country. Only Dublin, Belfast, Armagh and Cork have the privilege of using the title Lord Mayor, as opposed to just simply Mayor. In a ceremony known as Throwing the Dart, the Lord Mayor throws a dart into Cork Harbour at its boundaries, to symbolise the city's control over the port. This tradition was first recorded in 1759, although it is probably older. Election to the office The Lord Mayor is elected to office annually by councillors of Cork City Council from amongst its members. From 1979 to 2014, the position of Lord Mayor was rotated between Fianna F√°il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party on an annual basis as a result of a pact between the three parties which attracted much controversy and public criticism. Following the 2014 local elections, a D'Hondt method was adopted, which rotated the mayoralty between Fianna F√°il, Sinn F√©in, Fine Gael, and independents. Solidarity and The Workers' Party did not join the arrangement, and instead nominated their own candidates. Functions The office is largely symbolic and its responsibilities consist of chairing meetings of the City Council and representing the city at public events. Apart from a few reserved functions, which are exercised by the City Council as a whole, executive power is exercised by the chief executive, a council official appointed by the Public Appointments Service.

King (16 March 1808 ‚Äì 25 September 1886) was a British-born American writer and pioneer. Converting to Mormonism while in England, her family emigrated to the American state of Utah in 1853 where she became endeared to the people of that state. She was the author of Songs of the Heart, several poems, as well as writings addressed to young readers. King was the last woman sealed to Brigham Young. Early years Hannah Dorcas Tapfield was born 16 March 1808 in Sawston, Cambridgeshire, England. Her parents, Mary Lawson and Peter Tapfield, were devoted members of the Church of England, with her grandfather being a rector of that church. Her early days were passed in Cambridge. Career England She married Thomas Owen King Sr., a farmer, on April 6, 1824; they had 10 children. In 1850, she converted to the Mormon faith, and in 1853, the family removed to the United States. Of her life and connections with Mormonism she said:‚Äî She was a literary woman and one of the personal correspondents of the English poet Eliza Cook. Her connection with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) her a respectability in the Cambridge Branch of the LDS Church. Utah King's poems suggest her love of exalted subjects and noble characters. She was enchanted with the part of Queen Isabella and the mission of Columbus. She wished that she could be an Isabella and find and fund a Columbus. Songs of the Heart King created pieces for the Polysophical Society of Salt Lake, founded by Eliza and Lorenzo Snow, as well as other societies and the press. An admirer of the English poet Eliza Cook, King indulged her feelings mainly in that direction, publishing in 1879, Songs of the Heart. The Juvenile Instructor contained many of her most sympathetic writings for children and the youth of Utah. In the pages of the Woman's Exponent, her work was in a different field. Tullidge's Magazine contained her historical prose contributions. King wrote of Ferdinand and Isabella, of Columbus, Salvator Rosa and Disraeli, Napoleon and Josephine, Victoria and Elizabeth, the last of whom she somewhat resembled at times in an imperious manner, though her usual mode was one of sympathy, and her nature, one capable of enduring attachment, and unfaltering love. The women of Scripture was also a theme of hers for thought; she published a volume on this topic. In the line of poetry, she considered the \\"Epic\\" of the Gospel as her crowning work. Personal life She married Thomas Owen King Sr. (1800‚Äì1874) in 1824, and they came to Utah in 1853 with Claudius V. Spencer Company. Of their ten children, only four survived into adulthood: Georgina (b. 1830), Louisa (b. 1833), Bertha Mary, Thomas Owen, Jr. (b. 1840). As her husband was not a member of the LDS Church which held that she could only secure salvation through sealing with a \\"righteous man\\", this occurred in 1872 with Brigham Young. Two years later, after the death of Thomas, whom King had continued to live with, Young sent a gift to King of flour, cornmeal, flour, sago and sugar. She had been pleased to sit beside and dance with Young in 1856, but the sealing was an intention for a life together after death. She died in Salt Lake City on 25 September 1886.

Upmann 1844 brand. At 23 years old he embarked for the New World in 1839 to work for an import / export Company: The Gravenhorst & Co. During the voyage, a Briton persuaded him to stay in Havana where the tobacco business was flourishing. Upmann accepted the suggestion. He learned the processes and secrets of cigar manufacturing, purchased a local cigar factory at 85 San Miguel Street, Havana, and created the H. Upmann 1844 brand, which is among the oldest cigar brands in the world. In 1855 he received the first of many prizes that he would obtain over the following years. He achieved the qualification of \\"Provider of His Majesty Don Alfonso XII, King of Spain\\". His is one of the five largest tobacco factories in Cuba. Hermann Upmann became a director of the Havana Cigar Brand Association, an organization that works to confront the production and sale of counterfeit cigars . He nevertheless found the tropical climate in Cuba difficult, so he decided against a lasting stay. His youngest brother, August Ludwig Upmann (born 1818) started to work with him and thus stayed in Cuba. Hermann Dietrich Upmann returned to Germany in 1848 and founded the cigar company Gebr√ºder Upmann & Co. Bremen. In 1864, his nephew, Heinrich Upmann, arrived in Cuba. With capital contributed mainly by his uncle, they founded an organization dedicated to banking operations - initially catering to tobacco dealers and manufacturers, whose operations were spread through the Antilles. The company grew to such an extent that it was transformed into a vertical operation: they took care of the seedbeds, plant, harvest, manufacture, pack and, with their own shipping company, transported their products to other markets. Hermann Upmann retired in 1890, and was succeeded at H. Upmann & Co. by his nephew, Heinrich Upmann, who continued the business with his partners Heinrich Runken and Theodore Garbade. The later was president of the Union of Cigar manufacturers of the Island. After Heinrich's death in 1914, he was succeeded by his nephews Hermann and Albert (Alberto) Upmann. Hermann Upmann died in Bremen 1894 and is buried in the Upmann family grave at the in Bremen.

Page produced the album, which was released in November 2017 on his own record label. Recording and release The tracks were recorded during the Yardbirds' last American tour in 1968; the live recordings are from their performance at the Anderson Theater on 30 March and studio recordings are demos from sessions at Columbia Recording Studio in April. Previously, the ten live tracks appeared on Live Yardbirds: Featuring Jimmy Page. The album was issued by Epic Records in 1971, but was quickly withdrawn. Most of the eight demos were included on the limited release Cumular Limit in 2000. The live performance follows a typical Yardbirds' set list for the period and includes several of their best- known songs, including \\"The Train Kept A-Rollin'\\", \\"I'm a Man\\", \\"Shapes of Things\\", and \\"Over Under Sideways Down\\". Ryan Reed of Rolling Stone noted that among the songs are three which carried over to Led Zeppelin: \\"Dazed and Confused\\", \\"White Summer\\", and \\"Knowing That I'm Losing You\\", which was later reworked as \\"Tangerine\\". All three surviving members of the 1968 lineup (Jim McCarty, Chris Dreja and Jimmy Page) participated in preparing the album and issued a joint statement: Critical reception In a review for Classic Rock magazine, Ian Fortnam gave the album four out of five stars. While he has favourable comments on some of the demos, he notes \\"the main attraction here is the live set\\" that includes Yardbirds' standards and \\"Dazed and Confused\\".

There are many educational, culture and government institutions on this street, as well as historical monuments. Three building from Volodymyrska Street are depicted on reverses of Ukrainian hryvnia banknotes (Saint Sophia's Cathedral on 2 hryvnias, Tsentralna Rada building on 50 hryvnias and Red University Building on 100 hryvnias).  History   10th to 18th centuries  Volodymyrska Street is one of the oldest in Kyiv. The part of the street between Church of the Tithes and Sofiyska Gate appeared not later than the end of the 10th century. After construction of Saint Sophia's Cathedral at the beginning of the 11th century and Golden Gate around 1037, the street was enlarged to reach both of them and became the main street of the city, which was going through the City of Volodymyr and the City of Yaroslav, which are the oldest parts of Kyiv. Also Irynynsky Church, Georgivsky Cathedral and St. Theodore Monastery were constructed on the street, as well as houses for both the nobility and usual people. After Kyiv was ruined during Mongol invasion of Rus', the street remained in ruins long after. In the 17th century, Saint Sophia's Cathedral was reconstructed and a chapel was built on the place, where Church of the Tithes was. The upper half of Volodymyrska Street became a part of Old Kyiv Fortress. After a long break, at the end of the 18th century, intensive construction started on the part of the street below the Golden Gate. The remains of Kievan Rus' defence walls and Old Kyiv Fortress were demolished.  19th century  After expansion of Kyiv in 1830s the street was expanded far south. In 1837-1842 Red University Building was constructed. From this moment the modern look of the street started to appear. Several 1-2 floor buildings were constructed, followed by 3-5 buildings. Many hotels and administrative, community and residential building buildings were constructed. On the place where remains of Irynynsky Church were found, the St. Irene Column was erected from the ancient stone, which stood till the 1930s. At the end of the 19th century sett was put on the street, gas and later electric lighting appeared. In 1895 the tram line was constructed on the street.  XX century  Volodymyrska Street at the beginning of the 20th century. At the beginning of the 20th century, the new city theatre was constructed to replace the old one, which suffered from fire. A revenue house on the corner with Prorizna Street was also built, which is now a valuable place of interest in Kyiv; Pedagogical museum building, which will be the seat of the Central Council of Ukraine; Olgynska gymnasium building, which is now the seat of Presidium of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine; zemstvo building, which is now the seat of the Security Service of Ukraine. There were no major constructions on the street during the rest of the century, apart from construction of the building for the National Museum of the History of Ukraine. Nowadays, Volodymyrska street is one of the most important streets in Kyiv. It is also a very important tourist site due to historical monuments of the 11th to 19th centuries, including an archaeological complex on Starokyivska Hill at the top of the street.

Corsygedol Vaughan was the son of Richard Vaughan MP and his wife Margaret Lloyd, daughter of Sir Evan Lloyd of Bodidris, Denbighshire. He was educated at Eton College from 1725 to 1727 and was admitted at St Johns College, Cambridge in 1728. He was Constable of Harlech castle from July 1754 and High Sheriff of Denbighshire in 1766-7. He succeeded his brother to Corsygedol in 1775. Vaughan was unwilling to stand at Merioneth in the 1768 general election when his brother William Vaughan declined re-election. J. Pugh Pryse was returned instead and when Pryse's died in January 1774, Vaughan was still reluctant to stand. However he was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Merioneth in the by-election on 24 February 1774. At the 1774 general election soon after he had to fight a contested election, which showed the strength of the Vaughan interest. All his subsequent elections in 1780, 1784 and 1790 were uncontested. There is no record of his having spoken in the House before 1790. Contemporary parliamentary historian Thomas Oldfield described him in 1816 as ‚Äúone of the last independent members of the old constitutional school‚Äù. Vaughan died unmarried on 4 December 1791.
