Family and marriage  Elizabeth was the daughter of Sir James Bourchier, Knt. of Felsted in Essex, a wealthy London leather merchant; and his wife Frances Crane, daughter of Thomas Crane of Newton Tony in Wiltshire. Harris described the Bourchiers as \\"an ancient family;\\" but Noble wrote that it was only in 1610 that Sir James obtained a grant of arms (Sable, three ounces in passant in pale or spotted), and added that the only occasion when the arms of the Bourchiers were quartered with those of the Protector was at his funeral, when they appeared on the escutcheons. Elizabeth, the oldest of twelve children, was born on an unknown date in 1598. On 22 August 1620 at St Giles, Cripplegate, London, she married Oliver Cromwell. This marriage proved professionally advantageous for Cromwell, as her father brought him into contact with the wealthy merchant community of London, and the extensive lands Sir James owned in Essex later guaranteed Cromwell much support from the influential families of the local puritan gentry. At the time of his marriage, however, Cromwell had not yet become an ardent puritan. The Cromwell's marriage seems to have been happy. Cromwell wrote Elizabeth solicitous love letters while away on his military campaigns, and some of these were published in an anthology of love letters edited by Antonia Fraser in 1976. Their marriage produced nine children, eight of whom reached adulthood. Like her husband, Elizabeth was attacked in royalist propaganda and accused of personal vices. In these texts she was often contemptuously styled \\"Joan\\" (at the time, seen as a name with low associations). She was accused of drunkenness and adultery, which John Heneage Jesse concluded were \\"venomous absurdities\\" and \\"unworthy of notice\\". As the charges, however, appear to have been without foundation, the libels fell probably harmless.. Elizabeth is said to have had a defect in one of her eyes. She is known to have been introduced to Charles I when he was a prisoner at Hampton Court but still on good terms with her husband: Ashburnham presented her to the King, by whom, together with the ladies of Ireton and Whalley, she was afterwards entertained.  Protectress (1653-1658)  After Oliver Cromwell was proclaimed Lord Protector in December 1653, Elizabeth became Her Highness the Lady Protector. Martyn Bennett suggests that she \\"was apparently never comfortable with being the wife of the head of state\\". Although Elizabeth seems to have focused on managing the household and avoided becoming embroiled in public political activity, she was still a target for politically motivated abuse. \\"She very frugally housewifed it,\\" says James Heath, \\"and would nicely and finically tax the expensive unthriftiness (as she said) of the other woman [Henrietta Maria] who lived there before her\\". One book, entitled the Court and Kitchen of Mrs. Joan Cromwell, complained about Elizabeth's supposedly parsimonious nature and the supposedly miserly nature of her household arrangements. It suggested that \\"Much ado had she at first to raise her mind and deportment to this sovereign grandeur; and very difficult it was for her to lay aside those impertinent meannesses of her private fortune: like the bride-cat, by Venus's favour metamorphosed into a comely virgin, that could not forbear catching at mice, she could not comport with her present condition, nor forget the common converse and affairs of life. But like some kitchen-maid, preferred by the lust of some rich and noble dotard, was ashamed of her sudden and gaudy bravery, and for a while skulked up and down the house, till the fawning observance and reverences of her slaves had raised her to a confidence, not long after sublimed into an impudence.\\" Elizabeth's behaviour on her elevation is somewhat differently represented by the republican Edmund Ludlow, who knew her personally. He wrote that when the Cromwells changed residence from the cockpit at Whitehall to the royal palace, Elizabeth was at first anything but gratified with the splendid change in her domestic arrangements. Heath, on the contrary asserts, that \\"she was trained up and made the waiting woman of Cromwell's providence, and lady rampant of his successful greatness, which she personated afterwards as imperiously as himself\\". The writer Lilburne implied that Elizabeth had some influence over her husband, since he accused her of having disposed of military appointments during Cromwell's generalship. Granger recorded hearing \\"that she was as deeply interested herself in steering the helm, as she had often done in turning the spit; and that she was as constant a spur to her husband in the career of his ambition, as she had been to her servants in their culinary employments\\". However, Jesse argued that Elizabeth \\"seems to have laudably confined herself to the details of domestic life, nor is there any authenticated instance of her having exercised the slightest political influence over her husband. ... Besides, not one of her relations were partakers of her greatness, and Cromwell's behaviour to her appears throughout to have been rather that of a man who respects his wife as the mother of his children, than for any mental or personal qualifications of her own\\". He also pointed out \\"the singular and undoubted fact that she endeavoured to persuade her husband to recall the young King\\", without success. Only one letter written by Elizabeth is thought to be extant. Contained among Milton's State Papers, it is an affectionate letter addressed to the Protector. Jesse called the orthography \\"wretched, even for the period in which it was written\\". Elizabeth maintained six daughters of clergymen, whom she kept employed at needlework in her own apartments.  Later Years (1658-1665)  After her husband's death in 1658 and her son's abdication in 1659, the Cromwells had lost their influence in affairs of state. However, the army compelled the Parliament to settle on Elizabeth a suitable maintenance. After the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, Elizabeth apparently planned to flee England, and collected a large quantity of valuables with the intention of getting them conveyed out of the kingdom. After these plans became known to the council of state, a survey was ordered and several articles belonging to the royal family were discovered and confiscated, meaning that she was obliged to depart without them. The seizure was announced in the journals of the period: > \\"Whitehall, May 12, 1660. Information being given that there were several of > his Majesty's goods at a fruiterer's warehouse near the Three Cranes, in > Thames Street, London, which were there kept as the goods of Mrs. Eliz. > Cromwell, wife to Oliver Cromwell, deceased, sometimes called Protector, and > it being not very improbable that the said Mrs. Cromwell might convey away > some such goods, the Council ordered persons to view the same\\". citing > Parliamentary Intelligencer, 7 to 14 May > \\"May 16, 1660. Amongst the goods that were pretended to be Mrs. Cromwell's, > at the fruiterer's warehouse, are discovered some pictures, and other things > belonging to his Majesty: the remainder lay attached in the custody of > Lieut. Col. Cox.\\" citing Mercurius Publicus, 10 to 17 May. 1660 Granger believed that after the downfall of her family, Elizabeth resided for some time in Switzerland, but this is unsupported by other evidence. She certainly retired for a short period into Wales, where she remained till the excitement from the Restoration had in some degree subsided. She then moved to the house of her son-in-law, John Claypole, at Norborough in Northamptonshire, where she remained until she died in November 1665 and was buried in Northborough church on the 19th of November.John Jesse states that she died on 8 October 1672 . Mark Nobel speculates that although the register says that Elizabeth Cromwell, the widow of Oliver, was buried in Northbrough, on 19 November 1665 that this was only a political death, because she feared persecution and thought it prudent to be supposed dead. Nobel based this speculation on information provided by the Reverend James Clearke of Peterbrought.  Children  Elizabeth died in 1665 and was survived by five of her nine children, as well as many grandchildren. * Robert (baptised 13 October 1621‚Äì May 1639), cite Noble, i. 132; Forster, Edinburgh Review, January' 1856 died while away at school. * Oliver (baptised 6 February 1623Julian calendar with the start of year adjusted to 1 January (Old Style and New Style dates)‚Äì1644), who became a cornet in Lord St. John's troop in the army of the Earl of Essex, and died of small-pox. cites Noble, i. 132; Gardiner, History of the Great Civil War, i. 369 * Bridget Cromwell (baptised 4 August 1624 ‚Äì 1681), married firstly Henry Ireton (on 15 June 1646), and secondly Charles Fleetwood (in 1652). She had one son and three daughters by her first husband. * Richard Cromwell (4 October 1626 ‚Äì 12 July 1712). In 1658 he succeeded his father as Lord Protector, but the Protectorate collapsed one year later. In May 1649 he married Dorothy Mayor, daughter of Richard Mayor. Richard and Dorothy had nine children, but only four reached adulthood. * Henry Cromwell (20 January 1628 ‚Äì 23 March 1674) Served as Lord Deputy of Ireland. He married Elizabeth Russell with whom he had seven children. * Elizabeth Cromwell (baptised 2 July 1629 ‚Äì August 1658), married John Claypole, with whom she had four children.

A pasquinade entitled The Cuckoo's Nest at Westminster (1648) included ludicrous dialogue between the Protectress and Lady Fairfax. This broadside, printed before Cromwell's inauguration in the Protectorship, exhibits how early and how generally the Lord Protector's public views of personal aggrandizement were challenged by some contemporaries. Henry Neville's scurrilous pamphlet News from the New Exchange (1650) accused Elizabeth of intemperance and a love of intrigue. A seventeenth century satirical pamphlet cookbook, The Court and Kitchen of Elizabeth, Commonly Called Joan Cromwell, the Wife of the Late Usurper, portrayed her insultingly as a parsimonious housekeeper \\"a hundred times fitter for a barn than a palace\\". A miniature of Elizabeth was painted by Samuel Cooper, who described her as \\"neither uncomely or undignified in person.\\". Other writers portrayed her as unattractive, including Abraham Cowley who in his play The Cutter of Colman Street (1661) put the following passage into the mouth of Cutter: \\"He [Worm] would have been my lady Protectress's poet: he writ once a copy in praise of her beauty; but her Highness gave for it but an old half-crown piece in gold, which she had hoarded up before these troubles, and that discouraged him from any further applications to court.\\" Cowley's reference to the hoarding of the half-crown piece also alluded to her supposed thriftiness. Elizabeth Cromwell is a character in Aphra Behn's 1681 comedic play, The Roundheads or, The Good Old Cause. William Fisk depicted Elizabeth and her children supposedly begging Oliver Cromwell to spare the king's life, in his sentimental painting Cromwell's Family Interceding for the Life of Charles I (1840). In the 1970 film Cromwell, Elizabeth Cromwell was played by Zena Walker (with the part of Oliver Cromwell played by Irish actor Richard Harris).

Fought in present-day Higashimurayama, Tokyo at the foot of the Hachikokuyama ridge on May 12, 1333, it pitted the anti-shogunate imperial forces led by Nitta Yoshisada against the forces of the pro-Shogunate H≈çj≈ç Regency led by Sakurada Sadakuni. The battle was an immediate follow on from the previous day's nearby Battle of Kotesashi. The Setting The region from the east side of the Sayama Hills through the Yanagase River was the field of several battles during Japan's Sengoku period. The battlefield was regarded as strategically important because it was on the old road linking the provincial capital of Musashi Province with the capital of K≈çzuke Province and it was also the halfway point between the Iruma and Tama rivers.On site historical signage The battle At dawn on May 12, the Imperial forces advanced upon the Shogunate forces' position at the The exact location of the Kume River is not known as it does not appear on modern maps. Rather, there is an area on the border of Saitama and Tokyo named where the battle was fought. There is more than one river that runs through this area. via the Kamakura Kaid≈ç highway. Since the previous day's battle at Kotesashi was indecisive, both sides had expected the battle to continue. The chosen battlefield was a plain crisscrossed by small rivers and bordered by low-lying ridges. The geography gave the mounted warriors room to maneuver with their commanders overlooking the battle from the surrounding ridges such as where Nitta Yoshisada raised his banner at Hachikokuyama. The Taiheiki chronicles the events. The Shogunate forces formed a large mass with intention of encompassing the Imperial forces. The Imperial forces formed a wedge to protect its center. With neither side gaining immediate advantage, the battle continued until losses forced the Sh≈çgun's forces to retreat. Losses were reported as relatively light for the Imperial forces but heavy for the Sh≈çgun's.McCullough, Helen Craig (1959): pp. 274-285. Result The result was a victory for the Imperial forces; having grown weary from two days of heavy fighting, they rested at the battlefield. The Shogunate forces retreated south to Bubaigawara to await reinforcements.McCullough, Helen Craig (1959): pp. 274-285. Aftermath The two armies fought again three days later at Bubaigawara and Sekido.

A colloid is technically defined as a stable dispersion of particles in a fluid medium (liquid or gas). Spherical platinum nanoparticles can be made with sizes between about 2 and 100 nanometres (nm), depending on reaction conditions. Platinum nanoparticles are suspended in the colloidal solution of brownish-red or black color. Nanoparticles come in wide variety of shapes including spheres, rods, cubes, and tetrahedra. Platinum nanoparticles are the subject of substantial research, with potential applications in a wide variety of areas. These include catalysis, medicine, and the synthesis of novel materials with unique properties.  Synthesis  Platinum nanoparticles are typically synthesized either by the reduction of platinum ion precursors in solution with a stabilizing or capping agent to form colloidal nanoparticles, or by the impregnation and reduction of platinum ion precursors in a micro-porous support such as alumina. Some common examples of platinum precursors include potassium hexachloroplatinate (K2PtCl6) or platinous chloride (PtCl2) Different combinations of precursors, such as ruthenium chloride (RuCl3) and chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6), have been used to synthesize mixed-metal nanoparticles Some common examples of reducing agents include hydrogen gas (H2), sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and ethylene glycol (C2H6O2), although other alcohols and plant-derived compounds have also been used. As the platinum metal precursor is reduced to neutral platinum metal (Pt0), the reaction mixture becomes supersaturated with platinum metal and the Pt0 begins to precipitate in the form of nanoscale particles. A capping agent or stabilizing agent such as sodium polyacrylic acid or sodium citrate is often used to stabilize the nanoparticle surfaces, and prevents the aggregation and coalescence of the nanoparticles. The size of nanoparticles synthesized colloidally may be controlled by changing the platinum precursor, the ratio of capping agent to precursor, and/or the reaction temperature. The size of the nanoparticles can also be controlled with small deviation by using a stepwise seed-mediated growth procedure as outlined by Bigall et al. (2008). The size of nanoparticles synthesized onto a substrate such as alumina depends on various parameters such as the pore size of the support. Platinum nanoparticles can also be synthesized by decomposing Pt2(dba)3 (dba = dibenzylideneacetone) under a CO or H2 atmosphere, in the presence of a capping agent. The size and shape distributions of the resulting nanoparticles depend on the solvent, the reaction atmosphere, the types of capping agents and their relative concentrations, the specific platinum ion precursor, as well at the temperature of the system and reaction time.  Shape and size control  Electron micrographs of Ostwald ripening in Pd nanoparticles dissolved in formaldehyde at 6 (a), 24 (b), 48 (c) and 72 hours (d). The small Pd particles are being consumed as the larger ones grow bigger. Ramirez et al. reported the influence of ligand and solvent effects on the size and shape of platinum nanoparticles. Platinum nanoparticle seeds were prepared by the decomposition of Pt2(dba)3 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) under carbon monoxide (CO). These conditions produced Pt nanoparticles with weakly bound THF and CO ligands and an approximate diameter on 1.2 nm. Hexadecylamine (HDA) was added to the purified reaction mixture and allowed to displace the THF and CO ligands over the course of approximately seven days, producing monodispersed spherical crystalline Pt nanoparticles with an average diameter of 2.1 nm. After the seven-day period, an elongation of the Pt nanoparticles occurred. When the same procedure was followed using a stronger capping agent such as triphenyl phosphine or octanethiol, the nanoparticles remained spherical, suggesting that the HDA ligand affects particle shape. Oleylamine, oleic acid and platinum(II) acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)2) are also used in the synthesis of size/shape controlled platinum nanoparticles. Research showed that alkylamine can coordinate with Pt2+ ion and form tetrakis(amine)platinate precursor and replace the original acac‚àí ligand in Pt(acac)2, and oleic acid can further exchange with acac‚àí and tune the formation kinetics of platinum nanoparticles. When Pt2(dba)3 was decomposed in THF under hydrogen gas in the presence HDA, the reaction took much longer, and formed nanowires with diameters between 1.5 and 2 nm. Decomposition of Pt2(dba)3 under hydrogen gas in toluene yielded the formation of nanowires with 2‚Äì3 nm diameter independent of HDA concentration. The length of these nanowires was found to be inversely proportional to the concentration of HDA present in solution. When these nanowire syntheses were repeated using reduced concentrations of Pt2(dba)3, there was little effect on the size, length or distribution of the nanowires formed. Platinum nanoparticles of controlled shape and size have also been accessed through varying the ratio of polymer capping agent concentration to precursor concentration. Reductive colloidal syntheses as such have yielded tetrahedral, cubic, irregular-prismatic, icosahedral, and cubo-octahedral nanoparticles, whose dispersity is also dependent on the concentration ratio of capping agent to precursor, and which may be applicable to catalysis. The precise mechanism of shape-controlled colloidal synthesis is not yet known; however, it is known that the relative growth rate of crystal facets within the growing nanostructure determines its final shape. Polyol syntheses of platinum nanoparticles, in which chloroplatinic acid is reduced to PtCl42‚àí and Pt0 by ethylene glycol, have also been a means to shape-controlled fabrication. Addition of varying amounts of sodium nitrate to these reactions was shown to yield tetrahedra and octahedra at high concentration ratios of sodium nitrate to chloroplatinic acid. Spectroscopic studies suggest that nitrate is reduced to nitrite by PtCl42‚àí early in this reaction, and that the nitrite may then coordinate both Pt(II) and Pt(IV), greatly slowing the polyol reduction and altering the growth rates of distinct crystal facets within the nanoparticles, ultimately yielding morphological differentiation.  Green synthesis  An ecologically-friendly synthesis of platinum nanoparticles from chloroplatinic acid was achieved through the use of a leaf extract of Diospyros kaki as a reducing agent. Nanoparticles synthesized as such were spherical with an average diameter ranging from 212 nm depending on reaction temperature and concentration of leaf extract used. Spectroscopic analysis suggests that this reaction is not enzyme-mediated and proceeds instead through plant-derived reductive small molecules. Another eco-friendly synthesis from chloroplatinic acid was reported using leaf extract from Ocimum sanctum and tulsi as reducing agents. Spectroscopic analysis suggested that ascorbic acid, gallic acid, various terpenes, and certain amino acids were active in the reduction. Particles synthesized as such were shown through scanning electron microscopy to consist in aggregates with irregular shape. It has been shown that tea extracts with high polyphenol content may be used both as reducing agents and capping agents for platinum nanoparticle synthesis.  Properties  The chemical and physical properties of platinum nanoparticles (NP) make them applicable for a wide variety of research applications. Extensive experimentation has been done to create new species of platinum NPs, and study their properties. Platinum NP applications include electronics, optics, catalysts, and enzyme immobilization.  Catalytic properties  Platinum NPs are used as catalysts for proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), for industrial synthesis of nitric acid, reduction of exhaust gases from vehicles and as catalytic nucleating agents for synthesis of magnetic NPs. NPs can act as catalysts in homogeneous colloidal solution or as gas-phase catalysts while supported on solid state material. The catalytic reactivity of the NP is dependent on the shape, size and morphology of the particle One type of platinum NPs that have been researched on are colloidal platinum NPs. Monometallic and bimetallic colloids have been used as catalysts in a wide range of organic chemistry, including, oxidation of carbon monoxide in aqueous solutions, hydrogenation of alkenes in organic or biphasic solutions and hydrosilylation of olefins in organic solutions. Colloidal platinum NPs protected by Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) were synthesised and their catalytic properties measured. It was determined that they were more active in solution and inactive when phase separated due to its solubility being inversely proportional to temperature.  Optical properties  Platinum NPs exhibit fascinating optical properties. Being a free electron metal NP like silver and gold, its linear optical response is mainly controlled by the surface plasmon resonance. Surface plasmon resonance occurs when the electrons in the metal surface are subject to an electromagnetic field that exerts a force on the electrons and cause them to displace from their original positions. The nuclei then exert a restoring force that results in oscillation of the electrons, which increase in strength when frequency of oscillations is in resonance with the incident electromagnetic wave. The SPR of platinum nanoparticles is found in the ultraviolet range (215 nm), unlike the other noble metal nanoparticles which display SPR in the visible range Experiments were done and the spectra obtained are similar for most platinum particles regardless of size. However, there is an exception. Platinum NPs synthesized via citrate reduction do not have a surface plasmon resonance peak around 215 nm. Through experimentation, the resonance peak only showed slight variations with the change of size and synthetic method (while maintaining the same shape), with the exception of those nanoparticles synthesized by citrate reduction, which did not exhibit and SPR peak in this region..Stepanov, A.L.; Golubev, A.N. and Nikitin, S.I. (2013) Synthesis and Applications of Platinum Nanoparticles: A Review in Nanotechnology Vol. 2: Synthesis and Characterization, pp. 173‚Äì199. Studium Press. Through the control of percent composition of 2‚Äì5 nm platinum nanoparticles on SiO2, Zhang et al. modeled distinct absorption peaks attributed to platinum in the visible range, distinct from the conventional SPR absorption. This research attributed these absorption features to the generation and transfer of hot electrons from the platinum nanoparticles to the semiconductive material. The addition of small platinum nanoparticles on semiconductors such as TiO2 increases the photocatalytic oxidation activity under visible light irradiation. These concepts suggest the possible role of platinum nanoparticles in the development of solar energy conversion using metal nanoparticles. By changing the size, shape and environment of metal nanoparticles, their optical properties can be used for electrontic, catalytic, sensing, and photovoltaic applications.  Applications   Fuel cells application  = Hydrogen fuel cells = Among the precious metals, platinum is the most active toward the hydrogen oxidation reaction that occurs at the anode in hydrogen fuel cells. In order to meet cost reductions of this magnitude, the Pt catalyst loading must be decreased. Two strategies have been investigated for reducing the Pt loading: the binary and ternary Pt-based alloyed nanomaterials and the dispersion of Pt-based nanomaterials onto high surface area substrates. = Methanol fuel cells = The methanol oxidation reaction occurs at the anode in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). Platinum is the most promising candidate among pure metals for application in DMFCs. Platinum has the highest activity toward the dissociative adsorption of methanol. However, pure Pt surfaces are poisoned by carbon monoxide, a byproduct of methanol oxidation. Researchers have focused on dispersing nanostructured catalysts on high surface area supporting materials and the development of Pt-based nanomaterials with high electrocatalytic activity toward MOR to overcome the poisoning effect of CO. = Electrochemical oxidation of formic acid = Formic acid is another attractive fuel for use in PEM-based fuel cells. The dehydration pathway produces adsorbed carbon monoxide. A number of binary Pt-based nanomaterial electrocatalysts have been investigated for enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward formic acid oxidation.  Modifying conductivity of zinc oxide materials  Platinum NPs can be used to dope zinc oxide (ZnO) materials to improve their conductivity. ZnO has several characteristics that allow it to be used in several novel devices such as development of light-emitting assemblies and solar cells. However, because ZnO is of slightly lower conductivity than metal and indium tin oxide (ITO), it can be doped and hybridized with metal NPs like platinum to improve its conductivity. A method to do so would be to synthesize ZnO NPs using methanol reduction and incorporate at 0.25 at.% platinum NPs. This boosts the electrical properties of ZnO films while preserving its transmittance for application in transparent conducting oxides.  Glucose detection applications  Enzymatic glucose sensors have drawbacks that originate from the nature of the enzyme. Nonenzymatic glucose sensors with Pt- based electrocatalysts offer several advantages, including high stability and ease of fabrication. Many novel Pt and binary Pt-based nanomaterials have been developed to overcome the challenges of glucose oxidation on Pt surfaces, such as low selectivity, poor sensitivity, and poisoning from interfering species.  Other applications  Platinum catalysts are alternatives of automotive catalytic converters, carbon monoxide gas sensors, petroleum refining, hydrogen production, and anticancer drugs. These applications utilize platinum nanomaterials due to their catalytic ability to oxidize CO and NOx, dehydrogenate hydrocarbons, and electrolyze water and their ability to inhibit the division of living cells.  Biological interactions  The increased reactivity of nanoparticles is one of their most useful properties and is leveraged in fields such as catalysis, consumer products, and energy storage. However, this high reactivity also means that a nanoparticle in a biological environment may have unintended impacts. For example, many nanoparticles such as silver, copper, and ceria interact with cells to produce reactive oxygen species or ROS which can cause premature cell death through apoptosis. Determining the toxicity of a specific nanoparticle requires knowledge of the particle‚Äôs chemical composition, shape, size and is a field that is growing alongside advances in nanoparticle research. Determining the impact of a nanoparticle on a living system is not straightforward. A multitude of in vivo and in vitro studies must be done to fully characterize reactivity. In vivo studies often use whole organisms such as mice or zebrafish to infer the interaction of the nanoparticle on a healthy human body. In vitro studies look at how nanoparticles interact with specific cell colonies, typically of human origin. Both types of experiments are needed for a complete understanding of nanoparticle toxicity, especially human toxicity, since no one model has complete human relevance.  Drug delivery  A topic of research within the field of nanoparticles is how to use these small particles for drug delivery. Depending on particle properties, nanoparticle may move throughout the human body are promising as site-specific vehicles for the transport of medicine. Current research using platinum nanoparticles in drug delivery uses platinum- based carries to move antitumor medicine. In one study, platinum nanoparticles of diameter 58.3 nm were used to transport an anticancer drug to human colon carcinoma cells, HT-29. Uptake of the nanoparticles by the cell involves compartmentalization of the nanoparticles within lysosomes. The high acidity environment enables leaching of platinum ions from the nanoparticle, which the researchers identified as causing the increased effectiveness of the drug. In another study, a Pt nanoparticle of diameter 140 nm was encapsulated within a PEG nanoparticle to move an antitumor drug, Cisplatin, within a prostate cancer cell (LNCaP/PC3) population. Use of platinum in drug delivery hinges on its ability to not interact in a harmful manner in healthy portions of the body while also being able to release its contents when in the correct environment.  Toxicology  Toxicity stemming from platinum nanoparticles can take multiple forms. One possible interaction is cytotoxicity or the ability of the nanoparticle to cause cell death. A nanoparticle can also interact with the cell‚Äôs DNA or genome to cause genotoxicity. These effects are seen in different levels of gene expression measured through protein levels. Last is the developmental toxicity that can occur as an organism grows. Developmental toxicity looks at the impact the nanoparticle has on the growth of an organism from an embryonic stage to a later set point. Most nanotoxicology research is done on cyto- and genotoxicity as both can easily be done in a cell culture lab. Platinum nanoparticles have the potential to be toxic to living cells. In one case, 2 nm platinum nanoparticles were exposed to two different types of algae in order to understand how these nanoparticles interact with a living system. In both species of algae tested, the platinum nanoparticles inhibited growth, induced small amounts of membrane damage, and created a large amount of oxidative stress. In another study, researcher tested the effects of differently sized platinum nanoparticles on primary human keratinocytes. The authors tested 5.8 and 57.0 nm Pt nanoparticles. The 57 nm nanoparticles had some hazardous effects including decreased cell metabolism, but the effect of the smaller nanoparticles was much more damaging. The 5.8 nm nanoparticles exhibited a more deleterious effect on the DNA stability of the primary keratincoytes than did the larger nanoparticles. The damage to the DNA was measured for individual cells using single-gel electrophoresis via the comet assay. Researchers have also compared the toxicity of Pt nanoparticles to other commonly used metallic nanoparticles. In one study, the authors compared the impact of different nanoparticle compositions on the red blood cells found in the human bloodstream. The study showed that 5‚Äì10 nm platinum nanoparticles and 20‚Äì35 nm gold nanoparticles have very little effect on the red blood cells. In the same study it was found that 5‚Äì30 nm silver nanoparticles caused membrane damage, detrimental morphological variation, and haemagglutination to the red blood cells. In a recent paper published in Nanotoxicology, the authors found that between silver (Ag-NP, d = 5‚Äì35 nm), gold (Au-NP, d = 15‚Äì35 nm), and Pt (Pt-NP, d = 3‚Äì10 nm) nanoparticles, the Pt nanoparticles were the second most toxic in developing zebrafish embryos, behind only the Ag-NPs. However, this work did not examine the size dependence of the nanoparticles on their toxicity or biocompatibility. Size-dependent toxicity was determined by researchers at the National Sun Yat ‚Äì Sen University in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. This group‚Äôs work showed that the toxicity of platinum nanoparticles in bacterial cells is strongly dependent on nanoparticle size and shape/morphology. Their conclusions were based on two major observations. First, the authors found that platinum nanoparticles with spherical morphologies and sizes less than 3 nm showed biologically toxic properties; measured in terms of mortality, hatching delay, phenotypic defects and metal accumulation. While those nanoparticles with alternative shapes‚Äîsuch as cuboidal, oval, or floral‚Äîand sizes of 5‚Äì18 nm showed biocompatibility and no biologically toxic properties. Secondly, out of the three varieties of platinum nanoparticles which exhibited biocompatibility, two showed an increase in bacterial cell growth. The paper introduces many hypotheses for why these observations were made, but based on other works and basic knowledge of bacterial cell membranes, the reasoning behind the size dependent toxicity observation seems to be twofold. One: The smaller, spherically shaped nanoparticles are able to pass through cell membranes simply due to their reduced size, as well as their shape- compatibility with the typically spherical pores of most cell membranes. Although this hypothesis needs to be further supported by future work, the authors did cite another paper which tracked the respiratory intake of platinum nanoparticles. This group found that 10 ¬µm platinum nanoparticles are absorbed by the mucus of the bronchi and trachea, and can travel no further through the respiratory tract. However, 2.5 ¬µm particles showed an ability to pass through this mucus layer, and reach much deeper into the respiratory tract. Also the larger, uniquely shaped nanoparticles are too large to pass through the pores of the cell membrane, and/or have shapes which are incompatible with the more spherically shaped pores of the cellular membrane. In regards to the observation that the two largest platinum nanoparticles (6‚Äì8 nm oval, and 16‚Äì18 nm floral) actually increase bacterial cell growth, the explanation could originate in the findings of other works which have shown that platinum nanoparticles have demonstrated significant antioxidative capacity. However, it must be noted that in order for these antioxidative properties to be exploited, the platinum nanoparticles must first enter the cells, so perhaps there is another explanation for this observation of increased bacterial cell growth. Most studies so far have been size based using an in vivo mouse model. In one study, researchers compared the effects of sun 1 nm and 15 nm platinum nanoparticles on mice. The 15 mg/kg dose of sub 1 nm platinum nanoparticles were found to cause liver damage while the larger particles had no effect. A similar study using a singular injection as an exposure source of platinum nanoparticles into the mouse model found necrosis of tubular epithelial cells for particles under 1 nm, but no effect with those particles of 8 nm. These in vivo studies show a trend that the toxicity of the platinum nanoparticles is size dependent, most likely due to the ability of the nanoparticle to get into a high impactful region within the body. A complete study analyzing the effect of varying sized platinum nanoparticles used both in vivo and in vitro models is used to gain a better understanding what impact these nanoparticles could have. Using mice as a model, they found retention of the platinum nanoparticles by the respiratory tract of the mouse. This was accompanied by a minor to mild inflammation of the surrounding lung tissue. However, their in vitro tests using human and lung epithelial cells found no cytotoxic or oxidative stress effects caused by the platinum nanoparticles despite clear evidence of cellular uptake.

Fitzgibbon spent his early career at Victorian Football Association (VFA) club Brunswick but when the VFA suspended the competition in 1942 due to the war, he decided to switch leagues and joined Carlton. Used mainly as a wingman, Fitzgibbon became one of Carlton's most physically aggressive players which at times saw him front the tribunal. The most notable suspensions came in the 1945 finals series and began with a four-match suspension for king-hitting Collingwood forward Len Hustler in the Preliminary Final, which meant he had to watch that year's premiership from the stands. The Grand Final was marred by many instances of violence, and when teammate Jim Mooring was flattened, Fitzgibbon jumped the fence in his street clothes to take part in a bench-clearing brawl, and exchanged punches with South's Ted Whitfield before police ejected him from the ground. Fitzgibbon was suspended for an additional four matches. He played every game in the 1947 season, including Carlton's one point win over Essendon in the 1947 Grand Final, to ensure the 1945 suspension wouldn't cost him the chance of playing in a premiership.

The post was established in the fall of 1804 by John Sayer, a partner in the North West Company, and built by his crew of voyageurs. The site operated for several years, although its exact period of operation is unknown. It was later destroyed by fire. The discovery of artifacts in the 1930s revealed the site. Excavation in the 1960s added to knowledge about it, enabling accurate reconstruction of the post. The site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is operated as a state historic site. History A display of furs traded at the post The North West Company was formed in Montreal in the mid-1780s from a partnership of British merchants. The company established a large post at Grand Portage and built several other forts to house wintering voyageurs. Besides the Snake River forts, they also established forts at Fond du Lac (now part of modern Duluth), Big Sandy Lake, and Leech Lake in Minnesota. A typical fort would include a dwelling for the clerk, a storehouse, and a bunkhouse for the ten to twenty voyageurs who spent the winter. During the winters, the voyageurs would collect the pelts of beaver, otter, muskrat, deer, bear, marten, and other animals whose hides were useful. Dakota and Ojibwe men would kill and skin the animals, while the women would prepare the hides by stretching and drying them. The hides were typically regarded as the women's property, so they would arrange the sales with the clerk of the trading post. In return, the clerks would supply the Indians with trade goods, such as firearms, blankets, and cooking utensils. The fur trade, which had been going on for more than 100 years further east, was mutually beneficial, since the Indians received the products of early industrialization. The furs were sold to Europeans who made felt hats and fur coats. The site was rediscovered in 1931 by a local Pine City resident, who found artifacts such as musket flints in the soil. He returned to the site over the next three decades to explore it. In 1958, he found a book, Five Fur Traders in the North West, that contained the journal of John Sayer. The Pine City resident contacted the Minnesota Historical Society and explained what he had found. The Minnesota Historical Society performed some field testing in 1963 to determine the character of the site. In 1965 through 1967, a group of Hamline University students excavated the site and recovered hundreds of artifacts. The Minnesota Historical Society reconstructed the post in 1968 and 1969 and opened the site as a historic site in 1970. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The post has been reconstructed and furnished to represent the period from the winter of 1804‚Äì05. The museum is open in the summer, and costumed guides help interpret the site. The visitor center features exhibits about the post's history, a great room, fireplace and retail store. The historic site has previously been known as Connor's Fur Post and the North West Company Fur Post. Its name was changed to the Snake River Fur Post in February 2018.

It is free to use on opensource projects but requires that you buy a commercial license to use to develop with proprietary software. It implements virtually all Subversion features and provides API to work with Subversion working copies, access and manipulate Subversion repositories. Features Major SVNKit features are: * Repository access over http(s)://, svn(+ssh):// and file:// protocols. * Support for all working copy operations. * Repository administration: create, load, dump and replay operations. * Low-level API that allows to interact with Subversion repository directly on Subversion protocol level. * Complete JavaHL API implementation. * SVNKit is known to work on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, BSD, SunOS, OS/2 and OpenVMS. * SVNKit is JDK 1.5 compatible. Features available in the native Subversion client, but missing in SVNKit: * Local access (file://) to Berkeley DB based repositories (SVNKit only provides local access to default FSFS type of repositories). * Experimental \\"Serf\\" HTTP access (SVNKit only provides support for DAV access). * Some of HTTP authentication methods (e.g. SSPI) are not fully supported by the latest version of SVNKit. Command line client Part of SVNKit library is a command line Subversion client implemented on top of SVNKit. It is compatible with the native Subversion command line client and may be used in environments where it is not possible to install native Subversion or from within applications (e.g. Apache Ant scripts) that could not rely on the native Subversion presence. Competition JavaHL is a JNI wrapper of the native Subversion C code. JavaHL could be used instead of SVNKit in most of the use cases. However, SVNKit implements JavaHL API and thus both SVNKit and Subversion JNI wrapper could be used simultaneously to let user choose what suits his environment better. A fair comparison of SVNKit and JavaHL can be found in Subversion Book. Both SVNKit and JavaHL have their own advantages and disadvantages. Licensing SVNKit implements a dual licensing scheme. By default SVNKit is licensed under a licensing terms similar to those of GPL, that means, in general, that there are no restrictions or limitations on SVNKit usage as long as it is being used in an open-source project. For closed-source projects, a commercial license has to be purchased. History In 2005, a software company called TMate Software Ltd. announced the 1.0.0 release of JavaSVN ‚Äî a pure Java Subversion client library. Since then, the project has been renamed to SVNKit. Versions of SVNKit prior to 0.9.3 were licensed under BSD license terms, later licensing scheme has been changed to dual licensing.

It was among the 100 most popular names given to girls born in the United States between 1960 and 1990. It has since fallen in popularity and was ranked the 446th most popular name given to girls born in the United States in 2007. As a male forename it is well known in the United States, being in the 314th rank out of 1,219 in the 1990 U.S. Census. The name has multiple derivations. Dana or Danah, in Arabic, means \\"the most perfectly sized, valuable and beautiful pearl\\". This name is used mainly by Arabs of the Persian Gulf (Eastern Arabia), due to their traditional pearl diving professions wherein they gave different type of pearls names. Dana is an alternate spelling of the name for Danu, a Celtic fertility goddess. In Persian, the word DƒÅnƒÅ literally means \\"Wise\\", and some speculate that the name is first used as a first name in Shahnameh. It may also refer to the mountain Dana or Dena. The name is used in Persian for both female and male sexes. It may also come from \\"Dane\\" (from Denmark), the meaning of the common surname. It is also occasionally regarded as a feminine version of Daniel or a short version of feminine names such as Bogdana or Yordana. In Hebrew, the name Dana means \\"arbiter\\" or \\"God is my judge\\". In Sanskrit and Pali, the word means \\"generosity\\". In Romanian and Czech, it is a feminine name, derived from the name Daniela; the masculine form being Dan/Daniel. Dana is also the name of the ancient goddess of water in slovak cultures, and many rivers in eastern Europe have the letters D and N due to this.

Nicolas V de Neufville de Villeroy (14 October 1598 ‚Äì 28 November 1685) was a French nobleman and marshal of France. He was marquis then (from 1651) 1st duke of Villeroy and (from 1663) peer of France, marquis d'Alincourt and lord of Magny, and acted as governor of the young Louis XIV. His son Fran√ßois succeeded him as duke. He was the lover of Catherine-Charlotte de Gramont. Life He was the son of Charles de Neufville (1566‚Äì1642), marquis de Villeroy et d'Alincourt, and his second wife, Jacqueline de Harlay de Sancy.Nicolas V de Neufville-Villeroy's half-sister, Catherine de Neufville-Villeroy, was the grandmother of Anne de Souvr√©, marquess of Louvois. At the time of her marriage with Louvois, Nicolas de Neufville-Villeroy was Anne de Souvr√©'s tutor. See Luc-Normand Tellier, Face aux Colbert : les Le Tellier, Vauban, Turgot ... et l'av√®nement du lib√©ralisme, Presses de l'Universit√© du Qu√©bec, 1987, p. 170.Etext His grandfather Nicolas de Neufville served as a secretary of state under Charles IX, Henry III, Henry IV, and Louis XIII. Nicolas de Neufville studied at the court of Louis XIII as an enfant d‚Äôhonneur. In 1615, he was made governor of the Lyonnais under his father's supervision ‚Äì an effective governor, he served in that post until his father's death in 1642. He served in Italy with Lesdigui√®res and was promoted to marshal of France on 20 October 1646 thanks to being the prot√©g√© of cardinal Jules Mazarin. In March 1646, the queen- mother made marshal de Villeroy governor of Louis XIV, under Mazarin's authority chosen as \\"surintendent for the government and conduct of the king\\". It is difficult to attribute him any good or bad influence in the young king's education. He was made duke of Villeroy in September 1651Fran√ßois Bluche (in Louis XIV, Paris, Fayard, 1986, p. 43) gives the date as 15 December 1648. and admitted to the peerage of France in 1663. He served as Grand Master of France at Louis XIV's coronation and was made a knight of the Order of the Holy Spirit on 31 December 1661. Louis XIV also made him head of the Conseil royal des finances in 1661, a role (of particular importance at the time of the suppression of the surintendance des finances, but becoming largely honorific) he held until his death. Hotel de Villeroy Detail of a number 5 symbol (for Nicolas V) featured at the bottom of the lower railing of the grand staircase of the Hotel de Villeroy. In 1640 Nicolas de Villeroy built a h√¥tel particulier on 34 rue des Bourdonnais in the center of Paris in the district of les Halles. The House was built on the grounds of a former mansion already belonging to the Villeroy family since 1370. It has a second entrance from 9 rue des Dechargeurs The beautiful courtyard of the building was frequently visited by the young King Louis XIV who lived in the nearby Palais Royal and played there as a child with his brother Prince Philippe d'Orleans. History of the Hotel de Villeroy The Hotel de Villeroy still exists today, and in 1984 it was protected as a historic monument. Hotel de Villeroy listed as a historic monument Part of it is today used by the International Exposition center Cremerie de Paris which hosted in June 2012 the Nike Barber Shop. The Barber Shop was the center of the advertisement campaign of the US company Nike, Inc.

Alternatively, it can be the more general attempt to give a modern name to an ancient and ill-defined scourge or plague. Historical research Retrospective diagnosis is practised by medical historians, general historians and the media with varying degrees of scholarship. At its worst it may become \\"little more than a game, with ill-defined rules and little academic credibility\\". The process often requires \\"translating between linguistic and conceptual worlds separated by several centuries\\", and assumes our modern disease concepts and categories are privileged. Crude attempts at retrospective diagnosis fail to be sensitive to historical context, may treat historical and religious records as scientific evidence, or ascribe pathology to behaviours that require none.Getz, Faye M. Western Medieval Medicine in Darin Hayton, a historian of science at Haverford College, claims that retrodiagnosing famous individuals with autism in the media is pointless, as historical accounts often contain incomplete information. The understanding of the history of illness can benefit from modern science. For example, knowledge of the insect vectors of malaria and yellow fever can be used to explain the changes in extent of those diseases caused by drainage or urbanisation in historical times. The practice of retrospective diagnosis has been applied in parody, where characters from fiction are \\"diagnosed\\". Squirrel Nutkin may have had Tourette syndrome and Tiny Tim could have suffered from distal renal tubular acidosis (type I).

The term retrospective diagnosis is also sometimes used by a clinical pathologist to describe a medical diagnosis in a person made some time after the original illness has resolved or after death. In such cases, analysis of a physical specimen may yield a confident medical diagnosis. The search for the origin of AIDS has involved posthumous diagnosis of AIDS in people who died decades before the disease was first identified. Another example is where analysis of preserved umbilical cord tissue enables the diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus infection in a patient who had later developed a central nervous system disorder.

English scientist Henry Cavendish is believed by some to have been autistic. George Wilson, a notable chemist and physician, wrote a book about Cavendish entitled The Life of the Honourable Henry Cavendish (1851), which provides a detailed description that indicates Cavendish may have exhibited many classic signs of autism.Sacks, Oliver.

Port Phillip, sometimes referred to as Port Phillip Bay, is a large bay in southern Victoria, Australia, 1,930 km¬≤ (476,900 acres) in area, with a coastline length of . The bay is extremely shallow for its size, but mostly navigable. The deepest portion is only 24 m (80 ft), and half the region is shallower than 8 m. Its volume is around 25 km¬≥. The city of Melbourne is located at its northern end, near the mouth of the Yarra River. Port Phillip is home to a vast array of geographic features typically found in bays, such as beaches, points, islands and smaller bays, as well as being the drainage point of many major rivers and creeks in Central Victoria. All features here are listed clockwise from the mouth of the Yarra River. Beacon Cove beach and exclusive apartments in Port Melbourne Beaches Port Phillip hosts many beaches, most of which are flat, shallow and long, with very small breaks making swimming quite safe. This attracts many tourists, mostly families, to the beaches of Port Phillip during the summer months and school holidays. Water sports such as body boarding and surfing are difficult or impossible, except in extreme weather conditions. Most sandy beaches are located on the bay's northern, eastern and southern shorelines, while the western shorelines host a few sandy beaches, there mostly exists a greater variety of beaches, swampy wetlands and mangroves. The occasional pebble beach and rocky cliffs can also be found, mostly in the southern reaches. Major beaches include: St. Kilda Beach from a short pier.

An aquarium (plural: aquariums or aquaria) is a vivarium of any size having at least one transparent side in which aquatic plants or animals are kept and displayed. Fishkeepers use aquaria to keep fish, invertebrates, amphibians, aquatic reptiles, such as turtles, and aquatic plants. The term \\"aquarium\\", coined by English naturalist Philip Henry Gosse, combines the Latin root aqua, meaning water, with the suffix -arium, meaning \\"a place for relating to\\". The aquarium principle was fully developed in 1850 by the chemist Robert Warington, who explained that plants added to water in a container would give off enough oxygen to support animals, so long as the numbers of animals did not grow too large. The aquarium craze was launched in early Victorian England by Gosse, who created and stocked the first public aquarium at the London Zoo in 1853, and published the first manual, The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea in 1854.Katherine C. Grier (2008) \\"Pets in America: A History\\". p. 53. University of North Carolina Press An aquarium is a water-filled tank in which fish swim about. Small aquariums are kept in the home by hobbyists. There are large public aquariums in many cities. This kind of aquarium is a building with fish and other aquatic animals in large tanks. A large aquarium may have otters, turtles, dolphins, sharks, and whales. Most aquarium tanks also have plants. An aquarist owns fish or maintains an aquarium, typically constructed of glass or high-strength acrylic. Cuboid aquaria are also known as fish tanks or simply tanks, while bowl-shaped aquaria are also known as fish bowls. Size can range from a small glass bowl, a few liters in volume, to immense public aquaria of thousands of liters. Specialized equipment maintains appropriate water quality and other characteristics suitable for the aquarium's residents.  History and popularization  Cat and fishbowl, after Isoda Koryusai. Original . Antiquity In 1369, the Hongwu Emperor of China established a porcelain company that produced large porcelain tubs for maintaining goldfish; over time, people produced tubs that approached the shape of modern fish bowls. Leonhard Baldner, who wrote Vogel-, Fisch- und Tierbuch (Bird, Fish, and Animal Book) in 1666, maintained weather loaches and newts.Brunner, B: The Ocean at Home, page 25 It is sometimes held that the aquarium was invented by the Romans, who are said to have kept sea barbels in marble-and-glass tanks, but this is definitely not true. Nineteenth century Goldfish in a glass: portrait of Therese Krones, 1824 An aquarium of the 1850s containing Vallisneria spiralis and coldwater fish from Shirley Hibberd's The Books of the Aquariums and Waters Cabinets. London In 1832, Jeanne Villepreux-Power, a pioneering French marine biologist, became the first person to create aquaria for experimenting with aquatic organisms. In 1836, soon after his invention of the Wardian case, Dr. Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward proposed to use his tanks for tropical animals. In 1841 he did so, though only with aquatic plants and toy fish. However, he soon housed real animals. In 1838, F√©lix Dujardin noted owning a saltwater aquarium, though he did not use the term.Brunner, B: The Ocean at Home, page 35 In 1846, Anne Thynne maintained stony corals and seaweed for almost three years, and was credited as the creator of the first balanced marine aquarium in London.Brunner, B: The Ocean at Home, pages 35‚Äì36 English chemist Robert Warington experimented with a 13-gallon container, which contained goldfish, eelgrass, and snails, creating one of the first stable aquaria. The aquarium principle was fully developed by Warington, explaining that plants added to water in a container would give off enough oxygen to support animals, so long as their numbers do not grow too large. He published his findings in 1850 in the Chemical Society's journal.Brunner, B: The Ocean at Home, page 36 The Jardin zoologique at the Bois de Boulogne included an aquarium that housed both fresh and saltwater animals, 1860 in Paris. The keeping of fish in an aquarium became a popular hobby and spread quickly. In the United Kingdom, it became popular after ornate aquaria in cast-iron frames were featured at the Great Exhibition of 1851. In 1853, the aquarium craze was launched in England by Philip Henry Gosse who created and stocked the first public aquarium in the London Zoo which came to be known as the Fish House.Brunner, B: The Oceans at Home, pages 99 Gosse coined the word \\"aquarium\\", opting for this term (instead of \\"aquatic vivarium\\" or \\"aqua- vivarium\\") in 1854 in his book The Aquariums: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Water. In this book, Gosse primarily discussed saltwater aquaria.Brunner, B: The Ocean at Home, page 38 In the 1850s, the aquarium became a fade in the United Kingdom.Brunner, B: The Ocean at Home, page 57 Tank designs and techniques for maintaining water quality were developed by Warington, later cooperating with Gosse until his critical review of the tank water composition. Edward Edwards developed these glass-fronted aquaria in his 1858 patent for a \\"dark-water-chamber slope-back tank\\", with water slowly circulating to a reservoir beneath. \\"What an Aquarium Should Be\\" ‚Äì a humorous 1876 British engraving, apparently showing Thomas Huxley dreaming about sea creatures Germans soon rivaled the British in their interest. In 1854, an anonymous author had two articles published about the saltwater aquaria of the United Kingdom: Die Gartenlaube (The Garden House) entitled Der Ocean auf dem Tische (The Ocean on the Table). However, in 1856, Der See im Glase (The Lake in a Glass) was published, discussing freshwater aquaria, which were much easier to maintain in landlocked areas.Brunner, B: The Ocean at Home, pages 60‚Äì61 In 1862 William Alford Lloyd, then bankrupt because of the craze in England being over, moved to Grindel Dammthor, Hamburg, to supervise the installation of the circulating system and tanks at the Hamburg Aquarium. During the 1870s, some of the first aquarist societies were appearing in Germany.Brunner, B: The Ocean at Home, page 75 The United States soon followed. Published in 1858, Henry D. Butler's The Family Aquarium was one of the first books written in the United States solely about the aquarium.Brunner, B: The Ocean at Home, page 69 According to the July issue of The North American Review of the same year, William Stimson may have owned some of the first functional aquaria, and had as many as seven or eight.Brunner, B: The Ocean at Home, page 71 The first aquarist society in the United States was founded in New York City in 1893, followed by others. The New York Aquarium Journal, first published in October 1876, is considered to be the world's first aquarium magazine.Brunner, B: The Ocean at Home, pages 76‚Äì77 An antique cast-iron aquarium made by J. W. Fiske & Company in the 1880s, New York City In the Victorian era in the United Kingdom, a common design for the home aquarium was a glass front with the other sides made of wood (made watertight with a pitch coating). The bottom would be made of slate and heated from below. More advanced systems soon began to be introduced, along with tanks of glass in metal frames. During the latter half of the 19th century, a variety of aquarium designs were explored, such as hanging the aquarium on a wall, mounting it as part of a window, or even combining it with a birdcage.Brunner, B: The Ocean at Home, pages 86‚Äì89 Twentieth century Around 1908, the first mechanical aquarium air pump was invented, powered by running water, instead of electricity. The introduction of the air pump into the hobby is considered by several historians of the hobby to be a pivotal moment in its development.Whittall, Robin. \\"How Did It All Begin? The Roots Of Captive Fishkeeping From The Victorians' Perspective.\\" 1999 Pike in an aquarium , at the Belle Isle Aquarium, Belle Isle Park Aquaria became more widely popular as houses had an electricity supply after World War I. Electricity allowed artificial lighting, as well as aeration, filtration, and heating of the water.Brunner, B: The Ocean at Home, page 93 Initially, amateur aquarists kept native fish (with the exception of goldfish); the availability of exotic species from overseas further increased the popularity of the aquarium.Brunner, B: The Ocean at Home, page 78 Jugs made from a variety of materials were used to import fish from overseas, with a bicycle foot pump for aeration.Brunner, B: The Ocean at Home, pages 82‚Äì83 Plastic shipping bags were introduced in the 1950s, making it easier to ship fish.Brunner, B: The Ocean at Home, page 82 The eventual availability of air freight allowed fish to be successfully imported from distant regions. Popular publications started by Herbert R. Axelrod influenced many more hobbyists to start keeping fish. In the 1960s, metal frames made marine aquaria almost impossible due to corrosion, but the development of tar and silicone sealant allowed the first all-glass aquaria made by Martin Horowitz in Los Angeles, CA. The frames remained, however, though purely for aesthetic reasons. Japan played an increasingly important role in shaping aquarium design in the latter part of the twentieth century, with the aquascaping designs of Takashi Amano influencing fishkeepers to treat home aquariums as aesthetically pleasing compositions, rather than simply as a way of displaying fish specimens.Axelrod, Herbert R., Warren E. Burgess, Neal Pronek, Glen S. Axelrod and David E. Boruchowitz (1998), Aquarium Fishes of the World, Neptune City, N.J.: T.F.H. Publications, p. 718, . In the United States, as of 1996, aquarium keeping is the second-most popular hobby after stamp collecting. In 1999, an estimated 9.6 million US households owned an aquarium. Figures from the 2005/2006 APPMA National Pet Owners Survey report that Americans own approximately 139 million freshwater fish and 9.6 million saltwater fish. Estimates of the numbers of fish kept in aquaria in Germany suggest at least 36 million. The hobby has the strongest following in Europe, Asia, and North America. In the United States, 40% of aquarists maintain two or more tanks. Over time, there has been an increasing appreciation of the usefulness of access to an aquarium to provide potential stress reduction and improvement of mood in people observing aquatic life. According to the research of having an aquarium is many health benefits like reduce stress, blood pressure and heart rate improvement, better quality sleep, reduce anxiety and pain, therapy of excited childrens, Alzheimer's therapy and improve productivity.  Design  An 80-litre home aquarium  Materials  Most aquaria consist of glass panes bonded together by 100% silicone sealant, with plastic frames attached to the upper and lower edges for decoration. The glass aquarium is standard for sizes up to about . However, glass as a material is brittle and has very little give before fracturing, though generally the sealant fails first. Aquaria are made in a variety of shapes, such as cuboid, hexagonal, angled to fit in a corner (L-shaped), and bow-front (the front side curves outwards). Fish bowls are generally either made of plastic or glass, and are either spherical or some other round configuration in shape. The very first modern aquarium made of glass was developed in the 19th century by Robert Warrington. During the Victorian age, glass aquariums commonly had slate or steel bottoms, which allowed them to be heated underneath by an open-flame heat source. These aquariums had the glass panels attached with metal frames and sealed with putty. Metal-framed aquariums were still available until the mid-1960s, when the modern, silicone-sealed style replaced them. Acrylic aquariums first became available to the public in the 1970s. Laminated glass is sometimes used, which combines the advantages of both glass and acrylic. Glass aquaria have been a popular choice for many home and hobbyist aquarists for many years. Once silicone sealant became strong enough to ensure a long-term water- tight seal, it eliminated the need for a structural frame. In addition to lower cost, glass aquaria are more scratch resistant than acrylic. Although the price is one of the main considerations for aquarists when deciding which of these two types of aquaria to purchase, for very large tanks, the price difference tends to disappear. An aquarium in the Burj Al Arab in Dubai Acrylic aquaria are now the primary competitor with glass. Prior to the invention of UV stabilization, early acrylic aquaria discolored over time with exposure to light; this is no longer the case. Acrylic is generally stronger than glass, weighs less, and provides a certain amount of temperature insulation. In colder climates or environments, it is easier to achieve and maintain a tropical temperature and requires less capacity from an aquarium heater. Acrylic-soluble cements are used to directly fuse acrylic together. Acrylic allows for the formation of unusual shapes, such as the hexagonal tank. Compared to glass, acrylics are easier to scratch; but unlike glass, it is possible to polish out scratches in acrylic. Large aquaria might instead use stronger materials such as fiberglass-reinforced plastics. However, this material is not transparent. Reinforced concrete is used for aquaria where weight and space are not factors. Concrete must be coated with a waterproof layer to prevent the water from breaking down the concrete, as well as preventing contamination of the water by the concrete. Plywood can also be used when building aquaria. The benefits of using plywood include: lower construction costs, less weight, and better insulation. A popular positioning choice for plywood aquaria is keeping them in a wall. Here the use of plywood is hidden by sinking the aquarium inside the wall. Putting insulation between the two helps with the insulation of a heated tank.  Styles  A MacQuarium Objects used for aquariums include: coffee tables, sinks, gumball machines and even toilets. Another such example is the MacQuarium, an aquarium made from the shell of an Apple Macintosh computer. In recent years, elaborate custom-designed home aquariums costing hundreds of thousands of dollars have become status symbols‚Äîaccording to The New York Times, \\"among people of means, a dazzling aquarium is one of the last surefire ways to impress their peers.\\" =Kreisel= A typical kreisel tank housing several jellyfish A kreisel tank (kreisel being German for \\"spinning top\\" or \\"gyroscope\\") is an aquarium shaped like a horizontal cylinder that is designed to hold delicate animals such as jellyfish and newborn seahorses. These aquariums provide slow, circular water flow with a bare minimum of interior hardware to prevent the inhabitants from becoming injured by pumps or the tank itself. The tank has no sharp angles around its sides and keeps the housed animals away from plumbing. Water moving into the tank gives a gentle flow that keeps the inhabitants suspended. Water leaves the tank through a screen which prevents animals from being drawn into the pump intake or overflow line. There are several types of kreisel tanks. In a true kreisel, a circular tank has a circular, submerged lid. Pseudokreisels are \\"U\\" or semicircle shaped, usually without a lid. Stretch kreisels are a \\"double gyre\\" kreisel design, where the tank length is at least twice the height. Using two downwelling inlets on both sides of the tank lets gravity create two gyres in the tank. A single downwelling inlet may be used in the middle as well. The top of a stretch kreisel may be open or closed with a lid. There may also be screens about midway down the sides of the tank, or at the top on the sides. It is possible to combine these designs; a circular shaped tank is used without a lid or cover, and the surface of the water acts as the continuation of circular flow. =Biotope= Another popular setup is the biotope aquarium. A biotope aquarium is a recreation of a specific natural environment. Some of the most popular biotopes are the freshwater habitats of the Amazon and Rio Negro rivers, the African rift lake environments of Lake Malawi and Lake Tanganyika, and saltwater coral reefs of Australia, the Red Sea, and the Caribbean. The fish, plants, substrate, rocks, wood, coral, and any other component of the display should completely match that of the local natural environment. It can be a challenge to recreate such environments, and most \\"true\\" biotopes will only have a few (if not only one) species of fish and invertebrates. Finally, an emerging concept for the home is that of a wall mounted aquarium, some of which are displayed at the Living Art Marine Center. Aquarium size and volume A aquarium at alt=Photo of yellow plants in water behind glass wall divided into sections. An aquarium can range from a small glass bowl containing less than of water to immense public aquaria that house entire ecosystems such as kelp forests. Relatively large home aquaria resist rapid fluctuations of temperature and pH, allowing for greater system stability. Beginner aquarists are advised to consider larger tanks to begin with, as controlling water parameters in smaller tanks can prove difficult. Unfiltered bowl-shaped aquaria are now widely regarded as unsuitable for most fish. Advanced alternatives are now available. In order to keep water conditions at suitable levels, aquariums should contain at least two forms of filtration: biological and mechanical. Chemical filtration should also be considered under some circumstances for optimum water quality. Chemical filtration is frequently achieved via activated carbon, to filter medications, tannins, and/or other known impurities from the water. Reef aquaria under have a special place in the aquarium hobby; these aquaria, termed nano reefs (when used in reefkeeping), have a small water volume, under .Reef Hobbyist Magazine, pp. 42‚Äì46, Q2 2013 Tunnel at the alt=Photo looking upward through -diameter glass tube into a fish-filled aquarium Practical limitations, most notably the weight of water () and internal water pressure (requiring thick glass siding) of a large aquarium, restrict most home aquaria to a maximum of around 1 cubic metre in volume (1000 L, weighing or ). Some aquarists, however, have constructed aquaria of many thousands of litres. Public aquariums and oceanariums designed for exhibition of large species or environments can be dramatically larger than any home aquarium. The Georgia Aquarium, for example, features an individual aquarium of . = Nano aquariums = A new trend is to have very small aquariums, termed mini aquariums (less than 150 litres or 40 gallons) or nano aquariums (less than 75 litres or 20 gallons). These can be either freshwater or saltwater, and are intended to display a tiny but self-contained ecosystem. Components Filtration system in a typical aquarium: (1) intake, (2) mechanical filtration, (3) chemical filtration, (4) biological filtration medium, (5) outflow to tankalt=Drawing of transparent 3-dimensional rectangle with two boxes and one cylinder above it and one longer, thin cylinder within it. Arrows point from the rectangle long cylinder to the top box, from the top box to the lower box, from the lower box to the other cylinder, from that cylinder back to itself, and from the cylinder to the rectangle. The typical hobbyist aquarium includes a filtration system, an artificial lighting system, an air diffuser and pump, and a heater or chiller depending on the aquarium's inhabitants. Many aquaria incorporate a hood, containing the lights, to decrease evaporation and prevent fish from leaving the aquarium (and anything else from entering the aquarium). Combined biological and mechanical aquarium filtration systems are common. These either convert ammonia to nitrate (removing nitrogen at the expense of aquatic plants), or to sometimes remove phosphate. Filter media can house microbes that mediate nitrification. Filtration systems are sometimes the most complex component of home aquaria. Aquarium heaters combine a heating element with a thermostat, allowing the aquarist to regulate water temperature at a level above that of the surrounding air, whereas coolers and chillers (refrigeration devices) are for use anywhere, such as cold water aquaria, where the ambient room temperature is above the desired tank temperature. Thermometers used include glass alcohol thermometers, adhesive external plastic strip thermometers, and battery- powered LCD thermometers. In addition, some aquarists use air pumps attached to airstones or water pumps to increase water circulation and supply adequate gas exchange at the water surface. Wave-making devices have also been constructed to provide wave action. An aquarium's physical characteristics form another aspect of aquarium design. Size, lighting conditions, density of floating and rooted plants, placement of bog-wood, creation of caves or overhangs, type of substrate, and other factors (including an aquarium's positioning within a room) can all affect the behavior and survival of tank inhabitants. An aquarium can be placed on an aquarium stand. Because of the weight of the aquarium, a stand must be strong as well as level. A tank that is not level may distort, leak, or crack. These are often built with cabinets to allow storage, available in many styles to match room decor. Simple metal tank stands are also available. Most aquaria should be placed on polystyrene to cushion any irregularities on the underlying surface or the bottom of the tank itself that may cause cracks. However, some tanks have an underframe making this unnecessary. Aquarium maintenance Large volumes of water enable more stability in a tank by diluting effects from death or contamination events that push an aquarium away from equilibrium. The bigger the tank, the easier such a systemic shock is to absorb, because the effects of that event are diluted. For example, the death of the only fish in an tank causes dramatic changes in the system, while the death of that same fish in a tank with many other fish in it represents only a minor change. For this reason, hobbyists often favor larger tanks, as they require less attention. Several nutrient cycles are important in the aquarium. Dissolved oxygen enters the system at the surface water-air interface. Similarly, carbon dioxide escapes the system into the air. The phosphate cycle is an important, although often overlooked, nutrient cycle. Sulfur, iron, and micronutrients also cycle through the system, entering as food and exiting as waste. Appropriate handling of the nitrogen cycle, along with supplying an adequately balanced food supply and considered biological loading, is enough to keep these other nutrient cycles in approximate equilibrium. An aquarium must be maintained regularly to ensure that the fish are kept healthy. Daily maintenance consists of checking the fish for signs of stress and disease. Also, aquarists must make sure that the water has a good quality and it is not cloudy or foamy and the temperature of the water is appropriate for the particular species of fish that live in the aquarium. Typical weekly maintenance includes changing around 10‚Äì30% or more of the water while cleaning the gravel, or other substrate if the aquarium has one; however some manage to avoid this entirely by keeping it somewhat self-sufficient. A good habit is to remove the water being replaced by \\"vacuuming\\" the gravel with suitable implements, as this will eliminate uneaten foods and other residues that settle on the substrate. In many areas tap water is not considered to be safe for fish to live in because it contains chemicals that harm the fish. Tap water from those areas must be treated with a suitable water conditioner, such as a product which removes chlorine and chloramine and neutralizes any heavy metals present. The water conditions must be checked both in the tank and in the replacement water, to make sure they are suitable for the species. Water conditions The solute content of water is perhaps the most important aspect of water conditions, as total dissolved solids and other constituents dramatically impact basic water chemistry, and therefore how organisms interact with their environment. Salt content, or salinity, is the most basic measure of water conditions. An aquarium may have freshwater (salinity below 500 parts per million), simulating a lake or river environment; brackish water (a salt level of 500 to 30,000 PPM), simulating environments lying between fresh and salt, such as estuaries; and salt water or seawater (a salt level of 30,000 to 40,000 PPM), simulating an ocean environment. Rarely, higher salt concentrations are maintained in specialized tanks for raising brine organisms. Saltwater is usually alkaline, while the pH (alkalinity or acidicity) of fresh water varies more. Hardness measures overall dissolved mineral content; hard or soft water may be preferred. Hard water is usually alkaline, while soft water is usually neutral to acidic. Dissolved organic content and dissolved gases content are also important factors. Home aquarists typically use tap water supplied through their local water supply network to fill their tanks. Straight tap water cannot be used in localities that pipe chlorinated water. In the past, it was possible to \\"condition\\" the water by simply letting the water stand for a day or two, which allows the chlorine time to dissipate. However, chloramine is now used more often and does not leave the water as readily. Water conditioners formulated to remove chlorine or chloramine are often all that is needed to make the water ready for aquarium use. Brackish or saltwater aquaria require the addition of a commercially available mixture of salts and other minerals. This aquarium features a heated tank and a glass-enclosed top for warmth during winter. Some aquarists modify water's alkalinity, hardness, or dissolved content of organics and gases, before adding it to their aquaria. This can be accomplished by additives, such as sodium bicarbonate, to raise pH. Some aquarists filter or purify their water through deionization or reverse osmosis prior to using it. In contrast, public aquaria with large water needs often locate themselves near a natural water source (such as a river, lake, or ocean) to reduce the level of treatment. Some hobbyists use an algae scrubber to filter the water naturally. Water temperature determines the two most basic aquarium classifications: tropical versus cold water. Most fish and plant species tolerate only a limited temperature range; tropical aquaria, with an average temperature of about , are much more common. Cold water aquaria are for fish that are better suited to a cooler environment. More important than the range is consistency; most organisms are not accustomed to sudden changes in temperatures, which can cause shock and lead to disease. Water temperature can be regulated with a thermostat and heater (or cooler). Water movement can also be important in simulating a natural ecosystem. Aquarists may prefer anything from still water up to swift currents, depending on the aquarium's inhabitants. Water movement can be controlled via aeration from air pumps, powerheads, and careful design of internal water flow (such as location of filtration system points of inflow and outflow).

Another arrow points to the air above the ocean surface and is labeled Water change. Another arrow, labeled Food points from the air to a fish below the surface. A final arrow points to the rectangle labeled Ammonium (). Of primary concern to the aquarist is management of the waste produced by an aquarium's inhabitants. Fish, invertebrates, fungi, and some bacteria excrete nitrogen waste in the form of ammonia (which converts to ammonium, in water) and must then either pass through the nitrogen cycle or be removed by passing through zeolite. Ammonia is also produced through the decomposition of plant and animal matter, including fecal matter and other detritus. Nitrogen waste products become toxic to fish and other aquarium inhabitants at high concentrations. In the wild, the vast amount of water surrounding the fish dilutes ammonia and other waste materials. When fish are put into an aquarium, waste can quickly reach toxic concentrations in the enclosed environment unless the tank is cycled to remove waste. =The process= A well-balanced tank contains organisms that are able to metabolize the waste products of other aquarium residents. This process is known in the aquarium hobby as the nitrogen cycle. Bacteria known as nitrifiers (genus Nitrosomonas) metabolize nitrogen waste. Nitrifying bacteria capture ammonia from the water and metabolize it to produce nitrite. Nitrite is toxic to fish in high concentrations. Another type of bacteria (genus Nitrospira) converts nitrite into nitrate, a less toxic substance. (Nitrobacter bacteria were previously believed to fill this role. While biologically they could theoretically fill the same niche as Nitrospira, it has recently been found that Nitrobacter are not present in detectable levels in established aquaria, while Nitrospira are plentiful.) However, commercial products sold as kits to \\"jump start\\" the nitrogen cycle often still contain Nitrobacter. In addition to bacteria, aquatic plants also eliminate nitrogen waste by metabolizing ammonia and nitrate. When plants metabolize nitrogen compounds, they remove nitrogen from the water by using it to build biomass that decays more slowly than ammonia- driven plankton already dissolved in the water. =Maintaining the nitrogen cycle= Live plants in an aquarium help to complete the nitrogen cycle, by utilizing nitrate as fertilizer. This 60-litre aquarium contains Anubias barteri and Echinodorus bleheri. A heater and small filter are in the background. What hobbyists call the nitrogen cycle is only a portion of the complete cycle: nitrogen must be added to the system (usually through food provided to the tank inhabitants), and nitrates accumulate in the water at the end of the process, or become bound in the biomass of plants. The aquarium keeper must remove water once nitrate concentrations grow, or remove plants which have grown from the nitrates. Hobbyist aquaria often do not have sufficient bacteria populations to adequately denitrify waste. This problem is most often addressed through two filtration solutions: Activated carbon filters absorb nitrogen compounds and other toxins, while biological filters provide a medium designed to enhance bacterial colonization. Activated carbon and other substances, such as ammonia absorbing resins, stop working when their pores fill, so these components have to be replaced regularly. New aquaria often have problems associated with the nitrogen cycle due to insufficient beneficial bacteria. Therefore, fresh water has to be matured before stocking them with fish. There are three basic approaches to this: the \\"fishless cycle\\", the \\"silent cycle\\" and \\"slow growth\\". In a fishless cycle, small amounts of ammonia are added to an unpopulated tank to feed the bacteria. During this process, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels are tested to monitor progress. The \\"silent\\" cycle is basically nothing more than densely stocking the aquarium with fast-growing aquatic plants and relying on them to consume the nitrogen, allowing the necessary bacterial populations time to develop. According to anecdotal reports, the plants can consume nitrogenous waste so efficiently that ammonia and nitrite level spikes seen in more traditional cycling methods are greatly reduced or disappear. \\"Slow growth\\" entails slowly increasing the population of fish over a period of 6 to 8 weeks, giving bacteria colonies time to grow and stabilize with the increase in fish waste. This method is usually done with a small starter population of hardier fish which can survive the ammonia and nitrite spikes, whether they are intended to be permanent residents or to be traded out later for the desired occupants. The largest bacterial populations are found in the filter, where is high water flow and plentiful surface available for their growth, so effective and efficient filtration is vital. Sometimes, a vigorous cleaning of the filter is enough to seriously disturb the biological balance of an aquarium. Therefore, it is recommended to rinse mechanical filters in an outside bucket of aquarium water to dislodge organic materials that contribute to nitrate problems, while preserving bacteria populations. Another safe practice consists of cleaning only half of the filter media during each service, or using two filters, only one of which is cleaned at a time. Biological load A very heavily stocked 19-liter aquarium containing alt=Photo displaying plants, small fish, and tipped-over clay pots The biological load, or bioload, is a measure of the burden placed on the aquarium ecosystem by its inhabitants. High biological loading presents a more complicated tank ecology, which in turn means that equilibrium is easier to upset. Several fundamental constraints on biological loading depend on aquarium size. The water's surface area limits oxygen intake. The bacteria population depends on the physical space they have available to colonize. Physically, only a limited size and number of plants and animals can fit into an aquarium while still providing room for movement. Biologically, biological loading refers to the rate of biological decay in proportion to tank volume. Adding plants to an aquarium will sometimes help greatly with taking up fish waste as plant nutrients. Although an aquarium can be overloaded with fish, an excess of plants is unlikely to cause harm. Decaying plant material, such as decaying plant leaves, can add these nutrients back into the aquarium if not promptly removed. The bioload is processed by the aquarium's biofilter filtration system. =Calculating capacity= Limiting factors include the oxygen availability and filtration processing. Aquarists have rules of thumb to estimate the number of fish that can be kept in an aquarium. The examples below are for small freshwater fish; larger freshwater fishes and most marine fishes need much more generous allowances. *3 cm of adult fish length per 4 litres of water (i.e., a 6 cm-long fish would need about 8 litres of water). *1 cm of adult fish length per 30 square centimetres of surface area. *1 inch of adult fish length per US gallon of water. *1 inch of adult fish length per 12 square inches of surface area. Experienced aquarists warn against applying these rules too strictly because they do not consider other important issues such as growth rate, activity level, social behaviour, filtration capacity, total biomass of plant life, and so on. It is better to apply the overall mass and size of a fish per gallon of water, than simply the length. This is because fish of different sizes produce quite differing amounts of waste. Establishing maximum capacity is often a matter of slowly adding fish and monitoring water quality over time, following a trial and error approach. =Other factors affecting capacity= An academic aquarium at a university, using a variety of tank sizes and styles to care for different fish. One variable is differences between fish. Smaller fish consume more oxygen per gram of body weight than larger fish. Labyrinth fish can breathe atmospheric oxygen and do not need as much surface area (however, some of these fish are territorial, and do not appreciate crowding). Barbs also require more surface area than tetras of comparable size. Oxygen exchange at the surface is an important constraint, and thus the surface area of the aquarium matters. Some aquarists claim that a deeper aquarium holds no more fish than a shallower aquarium with the same surface area. The capacity can be improved by surface movement and water circulation such as through aeration, which not only improves oxygen exchange, but also waste decomposition rates. Waste density is another variable. Decomposition in solution consumes oxygen. Oxygen dissolves less readily in warmer water; this is a double-edged sword since warmer temperatures make fish more active, so they consume more oxygen. In addition to bioload/chemical considerations, aquarists also consider the mutual compatibility of the fish. For instance, predatory fish are usually not kept with small, passive species, and territorial fish are often unsuitable tankmates for shoaling species. Furthermore, fish tend to fare better if given tanks conducive to their size. That is, large fish need large tanks and small fish can do well in smaller tanks. Lastly, the tank can become overcrowded without being overstocked. In other words, the aquarium can be suitable with regard to filtration capacity, oxygen load, and water, yet still be so crowded that the inhabitants are uncomfortable. For planted freshwater aquariums, it is also important to maintain a balance between the duration and quality of light, the amount of plants, CO2 levels and nutrients. The amount of fish on the tank can also affect the nutrients levels. For a given amount of light, if there is insufficient number of plants or insufficient CO2 to support the growth of those plants, so as to consume all the nutrients in the tank, the result would be algae growth. While there are fishes and invertebrates that could be introduced in the tank to clean up this algae, the ideal solution would be to find the optimal balance between the above-mentioned factors. Supplemental CO2 can be provided,https://aquaplantscare.uk/co2-and-the-role- of-carbon-and-liquid-carbon-in-planted-aquariums/ whose quantity has to be carefully regulated, as too much CO2 may harm the fishes. Aquarium classifications alt=Photo showing a tank filled with water and multiple aquatic plants. From the outdoor ponds and glass jars of antiquity, modern aquaria have evolved into a wide range of specialized systems. Individual aquaria can vary in size from a small bowl large enough for only a single small fish, to the huge public aquaria that can simulate entire marine ecosystems. One way to classify aquaria is by salinity. Freshwater aquaria are the most popular due to their lower cost. More expensive and complex equipment is required to set up and maintain marine aquaria. Marine aquaria frequently feature a diverse range of invertebrates in addition to species of fish. Brackish water aquaria combine elements of both marine and freshwater fishkeeping. Fish kept in brackish water aquaria generally come from habitats with varying salinity, such as mangrove swamps and estuaries. Subtypes exist within these types, such as the reef aquarium, a typically smaller marine aquarium that houses coral. Another classification is by temperature range. Many aquarists choose a tropical aquarium because tropical fish tend to be more colorful. However, the coldwater aquarium is also popular, which is mainly restricted to goldfish, but can include fish from temperate areas worldwide and native fish keeping. saltwater aquariumalt=Photo of water, coral, and fish behind a glass wall. Aquaria may be grouped by their species selection. The community tank is the most common today, where several non- aggressive species live peacefully. In these aquaria, the fish, invertebrates, and plants probably do not originate from the same geographic region, but tolerate similar water conditions. Aggressive tanks, in contrast, house a limited number of species that can be aggressive toward other fish, or are able to withstand aggression well. Most marine tanks and tanks housing cichlids have to take the aggressiveness of the desired species into account when stocking. Specimen tanks usually only house one fish species, along with plants, perhaps ones found in the fishes' natural environment and decorations simulating a natural ecosystem. This type is useful for fish that cannot coexist with other fish, such as the electric eel, as an extreme example. Some tanks of this sort are used simply to house adults for breeding. Ecotype, ecotope, or biotope aquaria is another type based on species selection. In it, an aquarist attempts to simulate a specific natural ecosystem, assembling fish, invertebrate species, plants, decorations and water conditions all found in that ecosystem. These biotope aquaria are the most sophisticated hobby aquaria; public aquaria use this approach whenever possible. This approach best simulates the experience of observing in the wild. It typically serves as the healthiest possible artificial environment for the tank's occupants. Public aquaria The 80-meter (260 ft) underwater tunnel in alt=Photo ‚Äì silhouettes of people in foreground. One large fish with many smaller fish in background. Lisbon Oceanarium designed by architect Peter Chermayeff The Baltic Sea Aquarium at Maretarium in Kotka, Finland Most public aquarium facilities feature a number of smaller aquaria, as well those too large for home aquarists. The largest tanks hold millions of gallons of water and can house large species, including sharks or beluga whales. Dolphinaria are specifically for dolphins. Aquatic and semiaquatic animals, including otters and penguins, may also be kept by public aquaria. Public aquaria may also be included in larger establishments such as a marine mammal park or a marine park. These are very popular around the world, especially with a new emergence in the Middle East. Virtual aquariums A virtual aquarium is a computer program which uses 3D graphics to reproduce an aquarium on a personal computer. The swimming fish are rendered in real time, while the background of the tank is usually static. Objects on the floor of the tank may be mapped in simple planes so that the fish may appear to swim both in front and behind them, but a relatively simple 3D map of the general shape of such objects may be used to allow the light and ripples on the surface of the water to cast realistic shadows. Bubbles and water noises are common for virtual aquariums, which are often used as screensavers. The number of each type of fish can usually be selected, often including other animals like starfish, jellyfish, seahorses, and even sea turtles. Most companies that produce virtual aquarium software also offer other types of fish for sale via Internet download. Other objects found in an aquarium can also be added and rearranged on some software, like treasure chests and giant clams that open and close with air bubbles, or a bobbing diver. There are also usually features that allow the user to tap on the glass or put food in the top, both of which the fish will react to. Some also have the ability to allow the user to edit fish and other objects to create new varieties.

Tor Books) Cover artist: Alan Pollack Permanence is a 2002 science fiction novel by Canadian writer Karl Schroeder. Plot The novel tells the story of two characters, Rue Cassels and Michael Bequith, and their encounter with an alien spacecraft Rue has named Jentry's Envy. Schroeder uses the story as a venue for discussing the information economy and philosophy. Rue, on the run from her brother Jentry and out of money, files claim on an undiscovered comet. She expects to profit from the mineral rights, but it turns out that the \\"comet\\" is actually an interstellar cycler, a ship that travels in a light-years length orbit, at relativistic speeds (85% c) carrying cargo and passengers between the Halo Worlds, planets that orbit Brown dwarf stars. The discovery causes a sensation, since the ship is the first to approach the planet Erythrion in ten years. Eventually her claim is upheld, since the cycler is silent, and her mineral rights become salvage rights, making her potentially very wealthy. A rich cousin of hers, Max Cassels, sponsors an expedition to the ship so she can claim it. Intrigue happens on the trip as several factions also want to claim it, such as the planetary government. The cyclers were the centerpiece of the Cycler Compact, but have slowly fallen out of use since the discovery of FTL travel, only possible between \\"lit\\" worlds. When they reach the ship, they are surprised to discover that it is an alien cycler, an unknown because all known aliens use FTL ships. They explore the ship some and jump off as it passes a lit world, Chandaka. Michael Bequith, a NeoShinto monk and aide to Dr. Laurent Herat, an exobiologist, are commandeered by Rear Admiral Crisler of the Rights Economy to join a joint expedition back to the Envy. The RE is interested, because the Envy appears to be a multi-species vessel, something previously unheard of. They are also interested because writing on the craft is the script of an alien species, the Lasa, who have supposedly been extinct for the last two billion years. Rue and her crew are also returning, since under Compact law she can only complete her claim if she can control the Envy. Before they can leave, the city suffers a rebel attack and one of their party, Dr Linda Ophir, is murdered. They travel in a ramscoop ship, the Banshee. When they arrive, they explore various areas of the ship before an explosion damages life support on the Banshee. Michael discovers that Dr. Ophir was murdered because she had discovered pictures of the writing on the Envy had been tampered with. Eventually they discover that part of the Envy is designed as a test to ascertain living conditions for visitors. Rue completes the process and the cycler builds them a new module and a set of controls. The expedition leaves the Envy for Oculus, a Halo world. Rue, now a Cycler Captain by law, is caught up in Compact politics over the course of the Envy. Michael and Dr. Herat arrange with representative of the alien Autotrophs to translate the writing on the Envy. The translation has grave consequences since it implies that the weapon of the Chicxulub, an ancient race that sent out waves of self-replicating machines to wipe out potential competitors, has survived. They realize that Crisler wants to use the weapon to wipe out the rebels. Rue learns from Max that Mallory, a Halo Worlder, wants to dissolve the Compact and join the RE. Rue goes to meet her crew to prepare to leave, but they are ambushed by Crisler and Max is killed. Rue, Michael, Dr Herat and Barents (a Rebel) escape in a submarine, but the attackers destroy the control computer just as they dive. They continue to do so for some hours, eventually getting caught by a cold current. They wind up at a secret undersea research base, where they are rescued by military police. They learn that Rue was believed dead along with her cousin and Crisler and Mallory have already departed for the Envy, having learned its point of origin, Apophis and Osiris, planetless binary brown dwarfs. They expect that he will arrive in sixteen months. The government has a secret way that will get them there, but only for citizens of the Compact. Dr. Herat elects to become a citizen of the compact, but Michael abstains. Michael passes preparation time for the trip by exploring abandoned ice tunnels on the planet with Barents. They discover that the Autotroph plans to leave the planet and warn its race about the weapon. Michel convinces them to let humans handle it. A message from a loyal member of the Envys crew arrives, stating that Crisler is planning a dangerous maneuver that will cut three months off his travel time. Rue takes drastic measures and shanghais Michael on the voyage, a new technology that allows a fleet of 15 small interceptor ships to enter FTL from inside the atmosphere of a brown dwarf. They arrive safely at the Twins (except for one ship) and discover that the Twins are ringed with power tethers that allow resources and power to be extracted. In the orbital center of the system is the construction shack that created the Envy. Her fleet is briefly attacked by the systems defenses, but she learns how to camouflage her ships. The Banshee was less successful and suffered a major hull breach. Rue and the soldiers sneak into the Banshee and free some of her original crew. The rest are in the construction shack, being used as explorers by Crisler. They leave for the construction shack, stealing an antimatter generator to use as cover. They enter the shack by way of burning a hole in the hull. Inside, Michael's team and Crisler's men are engaged in a firefight (literally, as the inside atmosphere is a hydrogen/oxygen mix). Michael shoots out a magnet block controlling the airlock and Crisler's marines are sucked out into space. However, Chrisler soon recaptures them. He reveals that the shack is not the true treasure, but the cycler mother seeds, one of which can regrow a complete cycler construction system. He plans to reverse engineer the technology and use it to wipe out the rebels and their worlds. Since the ships would be unable to distinguish between Rebel and alien worlds, this would amount to genocide on a universal scale. They also discover that the shack was not built by Lasa, but renegade Chicxulub, who embraced the Lasa philosophy. The Crysler's new cycler finishes and the shack launches it. Rue and company escape from Crisler by cutting loose a habitat. Barendts leaves with the seed and Michael pursues him. Rue leaves the habitat to get one of the interceptors and meets Michael, returning with the seed. Later, Rue and her crew watch as Crysler's cycler is launched from the system. The power tethers have redirected power back into one of the dwarfs to create a massive flare to use as an energy beam. On Erythrion, Rue announces her plan to revitalize the Cycler Compact, since the Lasa/Chicxulub technology means that the Halo worlds will at last be able to launch their own cyclers. Rue, however, is already planning her voyage to New Armstrong to reclaim the Envy and capture Crysler and Mallory. Information economy In the \\"rights economy\\", all physical objects are nano-tagged so that payment may be enforced for all uses of proprietary information. The result is a libertarian dystopia. Schroeder assumes solutions to the problems of conducting trade in space conducted almost entirely through intangible goods‚Äîsome form of interstellar money (Pp. 86, 321)‚Äîwithout explaining the underlying problem of creating such a currency or how the solution was devised. Supreme Meme Schroeder recycles Friedrich Nietzsche's myth of the eternal return to critique all organized religion with a plot device he describes as the Supreme Meme. The philosophic question asked is whether or not the subject would choose to relive the same life over again \\"exactly as it was, no detail spared?\\" (pp. 232‚Äì233). Interstellar cycler In Permanence, Schroeder envisions a vehicle that would never slow down, instead using Lorentz force turning to curve its trajectory in a circle, an idea considered by P.C. Norem in a 1969 paper.Interstellar Travel: A Round Trip Propulsion System with Relativistic Velocity Capabilities,‚Äù AAS paper 69-388 (June, 1969). The idea is that the life support for an interstellar vehicle wouldn't have to be accelerated, only the payload, allowing more to be carried for a given energy budget. Literary significance and reception Roberta Johnson in her review for Booklist said \\"by turns exciting and thoughtful, pitiless and romantic, Schroeder's excellent novel is the best kind of coming-of-age novel, one that seizes the imagination and the emotions.\\" Booklist praised the novel saying \\"once again, the plot‚Äîof which the foregoing is barely a hint‚Äîarises organically from the backdrop and characters: thoughtful, well-informed, insightful work, with a sharp yet subtle political subcontext, catapulting Schroeder into SF's front rank.\\" The Library Journal said \\"the author of Ventus showcases his gift for panoramic storytelling in this story of a young woman's struggle to find her place in a world where trust and friendship are rare treasures.\\" Christine C. Menefee in her review for School Library Journal said \\"this suspenseful, complex tale asks many intriguing questions and illustrates more scientific principles than a semester of science labs. Some readers might not quite follow all of the rapid twists and turns, but they will want to hang on to reach the story's satisfying conclusion, where a thoughtful solution emerges amid plenty of fireworks.\\"  See also  *Lunar cycler *Mars cycler Reviews * James Schellenberg * , by Jo Walton Notes References * Schroeder, Karl, 2002.

The genus is native to Eurasia and North America, but the two commonplace species worldwide, T. officinale and T. erythrospermum, were introduced from Europe and now propagate as wildflowers. Both species are edible in their entirety. The common name dandelion ( , from French dent-de-lion, meaning \\"lion's tooth\\") is given to members of the genus. Like other members of the family Asteraceae, they have very small flowers collected together into a composite flower head. Each single flower in a head is called a floret. In part due to their abundance along with being a generalist species, dandelions are one of the most vital early spring nectar sources for a wide host of pollinators. Many Taraxacum species produce seeds asexually by apomixis, where the seeds are produced without pollination, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent plant. Description These are individual pollen grains of the dandelion - Taraxacum officinale. Segment of pappus fiber showing barbs The species of Taraxacum are tap-rooted, perennial, herbaceous plants, native to temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere. The genus contains many species, which usually (or in the case of triploids, obligately) reproduce by apomixis, resulting in many local populations and endemism. In the British Isles alone, 234 microspecies are recognised in nine loosely defined sections, of which 40 are \\"probably endemic\\". In general, the leaves are 5‚Äì25 cm (2\\" to 10\\") long or longer, simple, lobed, and form a basal rosette above the central taproot. The flower heads are yellow to orange coloured, and are open in the daytime, but closed at night. The heads are borne singly on a hollow stem (scape) that is usually leafless and rises 1‚Äì10 cm (\\" to 4\\") or more above the leaves. Stems and leaves exude a white, milky latex when broken. A rosette may produce several flowering stems at a time. The flower heads are 2‚Äì5 cm (1\\" to 2\\") in diameter and consist entirely of ray florets. The flower heads mature into spherical seed heads sometimes called blowballs or clocks (in both British and American English)\\"blowball\\" entry, Collins Dictionary\\"Blowball\\", InfoPlease Dictionary\\"Clock\\", American Heritage Dictionary containing many single-seeded fruits called achenes. Each achene is attached to a pappus of fine hair-like material which enables wind-aided dispersal over long distances. The flower head is surrounded by bracts (sometimes mistakenly called sepals) in two series. The inner bracts are erect until the seeds mature, then flex downward to allow the seeds to disperse. The outer bracts are often reflexed downward, but remain appressed in plants of the sections Palustria and Spectabilia. Some species drop the \\"parachute\\" from the achenes; the hair-like parachutes are called pappus, and they are modified sepals. Between the pappus and the achene is a stalk called a beak, which elongates as the fruit matures. The beak breaks off from the achene quite easily, separating the seed from the parachute. Seed dispersal A number of species of Taraxacum are seed-dispersed ruderals that rapidly colonize disturbed soil, especially the common dandelion (T. officinale), which has been introduced over much of the temperate world. After flowering is finished, the dandelion flower head dries out for a day or two. The dried petals and stamens drop off, the bracts reflex (curve backwards), and the parachute ball opens into a full sphere. When development is complete, the mature seeds are attached to white, fluffy \\"parachutes\\" which easily detach from the seedhead and glide by wind, dispersing. The seeds are able to cover large distances when dispersed due to the unique morphology of the pappus which works to create a unique type of vortex ring that stays attached to the seed rather than being sent downstream. In addition to the creation of this vortex ring, the pappus can adjust its morphology depending on the moisture in the air. This allows the plume of seeds to close up and reduce the chance to separate from the stem, waiting for optimal conditions that will maximize dispersal and germination. The pappus of a dandelion seed which aids in the wind-driven dispersal. Field with flowering dandelions, Tatarstan, Russia False dandelions Hawksbeard flower heads and ripe seeds are sometimes confused with dandelions. A Taraxacum officinale seedhead with only one seed still attached Many similar plants in the family Asteraceae with yellow flowers are sometimes known as false dandelions. Dandelion flowers are very similar to those of cat's ears (Hypochaeris). Both plants carry similar flowers, which form into windborne seeds. However, dandelion flowers are borne singly on unbranched, hairless and leafless, hollow stems, while cat's ear flowering stems are branched, solid, and carry bracts. Both plants have a basal rosette of leaves and a central taproot. However, the leaves of dandelions are smooth or glabrous, whereas those of catsears are coarsely hairy. Early-flowering dandelions may be distinguished from coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara) by their basal rosette of leaves, their lack of disc florets, and the absence of scales on the flowering stem. Other plants with superficially similar flowers include hawkweeds (Hieracium) and hawksbeards (Crepis). These are readily distinguished by branched flowering stems, which are usually hairy and bear leaves. Classification The genus is taxonomically complex, with some botanists dividing the group into about 34 macrospecies, and about 2000 microspecies; about 235 apomictic and polyploid microspecies have been recorded in Great Britain and Ireland. Some botanists take a much narrower view and only accept a total of about 60 species.

History Elizabeth Blackwell 1679 hand coloured print by Maria Sibylla Merian of a dandelion as plant host to the pale tussock moth Dandelions are thought to have evolved about 30 million years ago in Eurasia. Fossil seeds of Taraxacum tanaiticum have been recorded from the Pliocene of southern Russia.The Pliocene flora of Kholmech, southeastern Belarus and its correlation with other Pliocene floras of Europe by Felix Yu. VELICHKEVICH and Ewa ZASTAWNIAK - Acta Palaeobot. 43(2): 137‚Äì259, 2003 Dandelions have been used by humans for food and as an herb for much of recorded history. They were well known to ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans, and are recorded to have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for over a thousand years. The plant was used as food and medicine by Native Americans. Dandelions were brought to North America on the Mayflower for their medicinal benefits. Etymology Leaf resemblance to lion teeth The Latin name Taraxacum originates in medieval Persian writings on pharmacy. The Persian scientist Al-Razi around 900 CE wrote \\"the tarashaquq is like chicory\\". The Persian scientist and philosopher Ibn Sƒ´nƒÅ around 1000 CE wrote a book chapter on Taraxacum. Gerard of Cremona, in translating Arabic to Latin around 1170, spelled it tarasacon.Reported in An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language, by Walter W. Skeat (1888) (Downloadable at Archive.org). In An Etymology Dictionary of Modern English by Ernest Weekley (1921) it is reported that Arabic tarashaqun is derivable in turn from Persian talkh chakok, bitter herb (Downloadable at Archive.org). The English name, dandelion, is a corruption of the French dent de lionS. Potter & L. Sargent (1973) Pedigree: essays on the etymology of words from nature. Collins New Naturalist series Volume 56 meaning \\"lion's tooth\\", referring to the coarsely toothed leaves. The plant is also known as blowball, cankerwort, doon-head-clock, witch's gowan, milk witch, lion's-tooth, yellow-gowan, Irish daisy, monks-head, priest's-crown, and puff-ball; other common names include faceclock, pee-a-bed, wet-a-bed, swine's snout, white endive, and wild endive. The English folk name \\"piss-a-bed\\" (and indeed the equivalent contemporary French ') refers to the strong diuretic effect of the plant's roots. In various northeastern Italian dialects, the plant is known as pisacan (\\"dog pisses\\"), because they are found at the side of pavements. In Swedish, it is called maskros (worm rose) after the small insects (thrips) usually present in the flowers. In Finnish and Estonian, the names (voikukka, v√µilill) translate as butter flower, due to the color of the flower. In Lithuanian, it is known as \\"Pienƒó\\", meaning \\"milky\\", because of the white latex that is produced when the stems are cut. The Danish name m√¶lkeb√∏tte (sometimes fandens m√¶lkeb√∏tte) means \\"milk bin\\" (\\"the devils milk bin\\") and also refers to the milky latex (and its ability to spread). The Welsh (dant-y-llew), German (L√∂wenzahn), Norwegian (l√∏vetann), Portuguese (dente de le√£o) and Spanish (diente de le√≥n) names mean the same as the French and the English names. In Czech it is known as pampeli≈°ka where the \\"li≈°ka\\" part directly translates to a \\"fox\\", possibly due to the colour of the flower. Nutrition Plate of sauteed dandelion greens, with Wehani rice Raw dandelion greens contain high amounts of vitamins A, C, and K, and are moderate sources of calcium, potassium, iron, and manganese. Raw dandelion greens are 86% water, 9% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and 1% fat. A 100 gram (oz) reference amount supplies 45 calories. Phytochemicals The raw flowers contain diverse phytochemicals, including polyphenols, such as flavonoids apigenin, isoquercitrin (a quercetin-like compound), and caffeic acid, as well as terpenoids, triterpenes, and sesquiterpenes. The roots contain a substantial amount of the prebiotic fiber inulin. Dandelion greens contain lutein. Taraxalisin, a serine proteinase, is found in the latex of dandelion roots. Maximal activity of the proteinase in the roots is attained in April, at the beginning of plant development after the winter period. Each dandelion seed has a mass(weight) of 50 micrograms or 0.0005g (1/125 of a grain). Properties Edibility organic dandelion greens for sale at Whole Foods The entire plant, including the leaves, stems, flowers, and roots, is edible and nutritious. Dandelions are found on 6 continents and have been gathered for food since prehistory, but the varieties commercially cultivated for consumption are mainly native to Eurasia and North America. A perennial plant, its leaves grow back if the taproot is left intact. To make leaves more palatable, they are often blanched to remove bitterness, or sauteed in the same way as spinach.saut√©ed Dandelion Greens, ItalianFoodForever.com Dandelion greens have been a part of traditional Kashmiri cuisine, Spanish cuisine, Italian cuisine, Albanian cuisine, Slovenian, Sephardic Jewish, Chinese, Greek cuisine (œáœåœÅœÑŒ±) and Korean cuisines. In Crete, the leaves of a variety called 'Mari' (ŒúŒ±œÅŒØ), 'Mariaki' (ŒúŒ±œÅŒπŒ¨Œ∫Œπ), or 'Koproradiko' (ŒöŒøœÄœÅŒøœÅŒ¨Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œø) are eaten by locals, either raw or boiled, in salads. T. megalorhizon, a species endemic to Crete, is eaten in the same way; it is found only at high altitudes (1000 to 1600 metres, 3000' to 5000') and in fallow sites, and is called pentaramia (œÄŒµŒΩœÑŒ±œÅŒ¨ŒºŒπŒ±) or agrioradiko (Œ±Œ≥œÅŒπŒøœÅŒ¨Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œø). The flower petals, along with other ingredients, usually including citrus, are used to make dandelion wine. Its ground, roasted roots can be used as a caffeine-free coffee alternative. Dandelion was also traditionally used to make the traditional British soft drink dandelion and burdock, and is one of the ingredients of root beer. Dandelions were once considered delicacies by the Victorian gentry, who used them mostly in salads and sandwiches. Dye The yellow flowers can be dried and ground into a yellow-pigmented powder and used as a dye. Allergies Dandelion pollen may cause allergic reactions when eaten, or adverse skin reactions in sensitive individuals. Contact dermatitis after handling has also been reported, probably from the latex in the stems and leaves. Herbalism Dandelion has been used in traditional medicine in Europe, North America, and China. Food for wildlife Dandelion specimen in height Taraxacum seeds are an important food source for certain birds (linnets, Linaria spp.). Dandelions are also important plants for Northern Hemisphere bees, providing an important source of nectar and pollen early in the season. Dandelions are used as food plants by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). They are also used as a source of nectar by the pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), one of the earliest emerging butterflies in the spring. Benefits to gardeners With a wide range of uses, the dandelion is cultivated in small gardens to massive farms. It is kept as a companion plant; its taproot brings up nutrients for shallow-rooting plants. It is also known to attract pollinating insects and release ethylene gas, which helps fruit to ripen. Cultural importance It has been a Western tradition for someone to blow out a dandelion seedhead and think of a wish wanted to come true. Five dandelion flowers are the emblem of White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. The citizens celebrate spring with an annual Dandelion Festival. The dandelion is the official flower of the University of Rochester in New York State, and \\"Dandelion Yellow\\" is one of the school's official colors. \\"The Dandelion Yellow\\" is an official University of Rochester song. As an invasive plant Dandelions can cause significant economic damage as an invasive species and infestation of other crops worldwide; in some jurisdictions, the species T. officinale is listed as a noxious weed. As a source of natural rubber Dandelions secrete latex when the tissues are cut or broken, yet in the wild type, the latex content is low and varies greatly. Using modern cultivation methods and optimization techniques, scientists in the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME) in Germany developed a cultivar that is suitable for commercial production of natural rubber. The latex produced exhibits the same quality as the natural rubber from rubber trees. In collaboration with Continental AG, IME is building a pilot facility. , the first prototype test tires made with blends from dandelion-rubber are scheduled for testing on public roads over the next few years. In December 2017, Linglong Group Co. Ltd., a Chinese company, invested $450 million into making commercially viable rubber from dandelions.

Its last assignment was with Ninth Air Force at Weimar, Germany, where it was inactivated on 25 October 1945. The command was formed as a counterpart to IX Tactical Air Command and XIX Tactical Air Command to support the United States Ninth Army throughout its easterly advance from its formation on 15 September 1944, until VE-Day. Following the end of the war, the unit was converted from a provisional unit to a regular unit. History The unit was formed in France in the fall of 1944 as XXIX Tactical Air Command (Provisional), drawing its cadre from the 84th and 303d Fighter Wings. The two wings served as task force headquarters for the command, with groups and squadrons attached to them as needed.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 407-408Maurer, Combat Units, p. 416 The copmmand's commanding general throughout its existence was Brigadier General Richard E. Nugent The primary mission of the command was to provide tactical close air support of the United States Ninth Army ground forces to interdict concentration of enemy forces, attack communications and ammunition dumps, and harass the enemy's retreat as well as providing reconnaissance to bombing support. It initially attacked enemy forces in occupied France and the Low Countries Targets included bridges, roads, railroads and enemy interceptor aircraft both on the ground as well as in air-to-air combat. The command provided tactical air support in the final reduction of the German forces holding out in the French port of Brest. After the surrender of the town fifteen days later, Ninth Army was sent east to take its place in the line. It came into the line in between Third and First Army. In November, Ninth Army undertook offensive attacks in the Roer River sector to theleft flank of 12th Army Group. On December 16 the enemy opened the last great offensive of the war, the Battle of the Bulge. During the fierce combat, the XXIX attacked enemy targets in the Northern Rhineland during the Rhineland Campaign and supported Operation Grenade, which was the southern prong of a pincer attack coordinated with Canadian First Army's Operation Veritable. These operations had the objective of closing the front up to the Rhine River. By 10 March, the Rhine had been reached in all sectors of Ninth Army's front, and after 20 March that Ninth Army units first crossed the Rhine itself. XXIX Tactical Air Command attacked ground targets in the Ruhr, providing air support as Allied ground forces encircled enemy forces in the Ruhr pocket, essentially ending organized enemy resistance in Western Germany. Ninth Army halted its advance at the Elbe River in late April 1945, the Command engaging targets of opportunity in enemy-controlled areas until combat was ended in May 1945. The command was cited in the Order of the Day of the Belgian Army for the periods 1 October 1944 ‚Äì 17 December 1944 and 18 December 1944 ‚Äì 15 January 1945, for which it was awarded the Belgian Fourrag√®re. The unit remained in Europe after the war as part of United States Air Forces in Europe, performing occupation duty and the destruction or shipment to the United States of captured enemy combat equipment. It was demobilized in Germany and the organization was inactivated on 20 November 1945.

It is intended to remove trace amounts of CO from H2/CO/CO2 mixtures produced by steam reforming and water-gas shift. An ideal PROX catalyst preferentially oxidizes carbon monoxide (CO) using a heterogeneous catalyst placed upon a ceramic support. Catalysts include metals such as platinum, platinum/iron, platinum/ruthenium, gold nanoparticles as well as novel copper oxide/ceramic conglomerate catalysts. Motivation This reaction is a considerable subject area of research with implications for fuel cell design. Its main utility lies in the removal of carbon monoxide (CO) from the fuel cell's feed gas. CO poisons the catalyst of most low-temperature fuel cells. Carbon monoxide is often produced as a by-product from steam reforming of hydrocarbons, which produces hydrogen and CO. It is possible to consume most of the CO by reacting it with steam in the water-gas shift reaction: :CO + H2O H2 \\\\+ CO2 The water- gas shift reaction can reduce CO to 1% of the feed, with the added benefit of producing more hydrogen, but not eliminate it completely. To be used in a fuel cell, feed gas must have CO below 10 ppm. Description The PROX process allows for the reaction of CO with oxygen, reducing CO concentration from approximately 0.5-1.5% in the feed gas to less than 10 ppm. :2CO + O2 -> 2CO2 Due to the prevalent presence of hydrogen in the feed gas, the competing, undesired combustion of hydrogen will also occur to some degree: :2H2 \\\\+ O2 -> 2H2O The selectivity of the process is a measure of the quality of the reactor, and is defined as the ratio of consumed carbon monoxide to the total of consumed hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The disadvantage of this technology is its very strong exothermic nature, coupled with a very narrow optimal operation temperature window, and is best operated between 353 and 450 K, yielding a hydrogen loss of around one percent. Effective cooling is therefore required. In order to minimize steam generation, excessive dilution with nitrogen is used. Additionally the reaction is interrupted with an intermediary cooler before proceeding to a second stage. In the first reaction an excess of oxygen is provided, at around a factor of two, and about 90% of the CO is transformed. In the second step a substantially higher oxygen excess is used, at approximately a factor of 4, which is then processed with the remaining CO, in order to reduce the CO concentration to less than 10 ppm. To also avoid excess CO-fraction loading, the transient operation of a CO adsorber may be important. The instrumentation and process control complexity requirements are relatively high. The advantage of this technique over selective methanation is the higher space velocity, which reduces the required reactor size. For the case of strong temperature rises, the feed of air can simply be broken. The technical origins for CO-PROX lies in the synthesis of ammonia (Haber process). Ammonia synthesis also has a strict requirement of CO-free hydrogen, as CO is a strong catalyst poison for the usual catalysts used in this process.

Quetzalcoatl (Spanish: Quetzalc√≥atl ; (), in honorific form: Quetzalc≈çhuƒÅtzin) is a deity in Mesoamerican culture and literature whose name comes from the Nahuatl language and means \\"Precious serpent\\" or \\"Quetzal-feathered Serpent\\".The Nahuatl nouns compounded into the proper name \\"Quetzalcoatl\\" are: quetzalli, signifying principally \\"plumage\\", but also used to refer to the bird‚Äîresplendent quetzal‚Äîrenowned for its colourful feathers, and cohuƒÅtl \\"snake\\". In the 17th century, Ixtlilx√≥chitl, a descendant of Aztec royalty and historian of the Nahua people, wrote, \\"Quetzalcoatl, in its literal sense, means 'serpent of precious feathers', but in the allegorical sense, 'wisest of men'.\\" The earliest known documentation of the worship of a Feathered Serpent occurs in Teotihuacan in the first century BC or first century AD. That period lies within the Late Preclassic to Early Classic period (400 BC ‚Äì 600 AD) of Mesoamerican chronology; veneration of the figure appears to have spread throughout Mesoamerica by the Late Classic period (600‚Äì900 AD).Ringle et al. 1998 In the Postclassic period (900‚Äì1519 AD), the worship of the feathered- serpent deity centred in the primary Mexican religious center of Cholula. In this period the deity is known to have been named Quetzalc≈çhuƒÅtl by his Nahua followers. In the Maya area he was approximately equivalent to Kukulkan and Gukumatz, names that also roughly translate as \\"feathered serpent\\" in different Mayan languages. Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec god of wind, air, and learning, wears around his neck the \\"wind breastplate\\" ehecailacocozcatl, \\"the spirally voluted wind jewel\\" made of a conch shell. This talisman was a conch shell cut at the cross-section and was likely worn as a necklace by religious rulers, as such objects have been discovered in burials in archaeological sites throughout Mesoamerica, and potentially symbolized patterns witnessed in hurricanes, dust devils, seashells, and whirlpools, which were elemental forces that had significance in Aztec mythology. Codex drawings pictured both Quetzalcoatl and Xolotl wearing an ehecailacocozcatl around the neck. Additionally, at least one major cache of offerings includes knives and idols adorned with the symbols of more than one god, some of which were adorned with wind jewels. In the era following the 16th-century Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, a number of records conflated Quetzalcoatl with Ce Acatl Topiltzin, a ruler of the mythico-historic city of Tollan. Historians debate to what degree, or whether at all, these narratives about this legendary Toltec ruler describe historical events.Nicholson 2001, Carrasco 1982, Gillespie 1989, Florescano 2002 Furthermore, early Spanish sources written by clerics tend to identify the god-ruler Quetzalcoatl of these narratives with either Hern√°n Cort√©s or Thomas the Apostle‚Äîidentifications which have also become sources of a diversity of opinions about the nature of Quetzalcoatl.Lafaye 1987, Townsend 2003, Mart√≠nez 1980, Phelan 1970 Among the Aztecs, whose beliefs are the best-documented in the historical sources, Quetzalcoatl was related to gods of the wind, of the planet Venus, of the dawn, of merchants and of arts, crafts and knowledge. He was also the patron god of the Aztec priesthood, of learning and knowledge.Smith 2003 p. 213 Quetzalcoatl was one of several important gods in the Aztec pantheon, along with the gods Tlaloc, Tezcatlipoca and Huitzilopochtli. Two other gods represented by the planet Venus are Quetzalcoatl's ally Tlaloc (the god of rain), and Quetzalcoatl's twin and psychopomp, Xolotl. Animals thought to represent Quetzalcoatl include resplendent quetzals, rattlesnakes (coatl meaning \\"serpent\\" in Nahuatl), crows, and macaws. In his form as Ehecatl he is the wind, and is represented by spider monkeys, ducks, and the wind itself. In his form as the morning star, Venus, he is also depicted as a harpy eagle. In Mazatec legends the astrologer deity Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, who is also represented by Venus, bears a close relationship with Quetzalcoatl. Feathered serpent deity in Mesoamerica A feathered serpent deity has been worshiped by many different ethnopolitical groups in Mesoamerican history. The existence of such worship can be seen through studies of the iconography of different Mesoamerican cultures, in which serpent motifs are frequent. On the basis of the different symbolic systems used in portrayals of the feathered serpent deity in different cultures and periods, scholars have interpreted the religious and symbolic meaning of the feathered serpent deity in Mesoamerican cultures. Iconographic depictions A photo of La Venta Stela 19, the earliest known representation of the Feathered Serpent in Mesoamerica. Feathered Serpent head at the Ciudadela complex in Teotihuacan The earliest iconographic depiction of the deity is believed to be found on Stela 19 at the Olmec site of La Venta, depicting a serpent rising up behind a person probably engaged in a shamanic ritual. This depiction is believed to have been made around 900 BC. Although probably not exactly a depiction of the same feathered serpent deity worshipped in classic and post-classic periods, it shows the continuity of symbolism of feathered snakes in Mesoamerica from the formative period and on, for example in comparison to the Maya Vision Serpent shown below. The first culture to use the symbol of a feathered serpent as an important religious and political symbol was Teotihuacan. At temples such as the aptly named \\"Quetzalcoatl temple\\" in the Ciudadela complex, feathered serpents figure prominently and alternate with a different kind of serpent head. The earliest depictions of the feathered serpent deity were fully zoomorphic, depicting the serpent as an actual snake, but already among the Classic Maya, the deity began acquiring human features. In the iconography of the classic period, Maya serpent imagery is also prevalent: a snake is often seen as the embodiment of the sky itself, and a vision serpent is a shamanic helper presenting Maya kings with visions of the underworld. The archaeological record shows that after the fall of Teotihuacan that marked the beginning of the epi-classic period in Mesoamerican chronology around 600 AD, the cult of the feathered serpent spread to the new religious and political centers in central Mexico, centers such as Xochicalco, Cacaxtla and Cholula. Feathered serpent iconography is prominent at all of these sites. Cholula is known to have remained the most important center of worship to Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec/Nahua version of the feathered serpent deity, in the post-classic period. During the epi-classic period, a dramatic spread of feathered serpent iconography is evidenced throughout Mesoamerica, and during this period begins to figure prominently at sites such as Chich√©n Itz√°, El Taj√≠n, and throughout the Maya area. Colonial documentary sources from the Maya area frequently speak of the arrival of foreigners from the central Mexican plateau, often led by a man whose name translates as \\"Feathered Serpent\\". It has been suggested that these stories recall the spread of the feathered serpent cult in the epi- classic and early post-classic periods. Represented as the plumed serpent, Quetzalcoatl was also manifest in the wind, one of the most powerful forces of nature, and this relationship was captured in a text in the Nahuatl language: Quetzalcoatl was also linked to rulership and priestly office; additionally, among the Toltec, it was used as a military title and emblem. In the post- classic Nahua civilization of central Mexico (Aztec), the worship of Quetzalcoatl was ubiquitous. Cult worship may have involved the ingestion of hallucinogenic mushrooms (psilocybes), considered sacred. The most important center was Cholula where the world's largest pyramid was dedicated to his worship. In Aztec culture, depictions of Quetzalcoatl were fully anthropomorphic. Quetzalcoatl was associated with the wind god Ehecatl and is often depicted with his insignia: a beak-like mask. Interpretations Vision Serpent depicted on lintel 15 from Yaxchilan. On the basis of the Teotihuacan iconographical depictions of the feathered serpent, archaeologist Karl Taube has argued that the feathered serpent was a symbol of fertility and internal political structures contrasting with the War Serpent symbolizing the outwards military expansion of the Teotihuacan empire.Florescano 2002 p. 8 Historian Enrique Florescano also analyzing Teotihuacan iconography argues that the Feathered Serpent was part of a triad of agricultural deities: the Goddess of the Cave symbolizing motherhood, reproduction and life, Tlaloc, god of rain, lightning and thunder and the feathered serpent, god of vegetational renewal. The feathered serpent was furthermore connected to the planet Venus because of this planet's importance as a sign of the beginning of the rainy season. To both Teotihuacan and Maya cultures, Venus was in turn also symbolically connected with warfare.Florescano 2002 p. 821 Temple of the Feathered Serpent at Xochicalco, adorned with a fully zoomorphic feathered Serpent. While not usually feathered, classic Maya serpent iconography seems related to the belief in a sky-, Venus-, creator-, war- and fertility-related serpent deity. In the example from Yaxchilan, the Vision Serpent has the human face of the young maize god, further suggesting a connection to fertility and vegetational renewal; the Maya Young Maize god was also connected to Venus. In Xochicalco, depictions of the feathered serpent are accompanied by the image of a seated, armed ruler and the hieroglyph for the day sign 9 Wind. The date 9 Wind is known to be associated with fertility, Venus and war among the Maya and frequently occurs in relation to Quetzalcoatl in other Mesoamerican cultures. On the basis of the iconography of the feathered serpent deity at sites such as Teotihuacan, Xochicalco, Chich√©n Itz√°, Tula and Tenochtitlan combined with certain ethnohistorical sources, historian David Carrasco has argued that the preeminent function of the feathered serpent deity throughout Mesoamerican history was the patron deity of the Urban center, a god of culture and civilization.Carrasco 1982 In Aztec culture Quetzalcoatl as depicted in the Codex Magliabechiano. To the Aztecs, Quetzalcoatl was, as his name indicates, a feathered serpent, a flying reptile (much like a dragon), who was a boundary-maker (and transgressor) between earth and sky. He was a creator deity having contributed essentially to the creation of mankind. He also had anthropomorphic forms, for example in his aspects as Ehecatl the wind god. Among the Aztecs, the name Quetzalcoatl was also a priestly title, as the two most important priests of the Aztec Templo Mayor were called \\"Quetzalcoatl Tlamacazqui\\". In the Aztec ritual calendar, different deities were associated with the cycle-of-year names: Quetzalcoatl was tied to the year Ce Acatl (One Reed), which correlates to the year 1519.Townsend 2003 p. 668 Myths  Attributes  Quetzalcoatl as depicted in the Codex Borbonicus. The exact significance and attributes of Quetzalcoatl varied somewhat between civilizations and through history. There are several stories about the birth of Quetzalcoatl. In a version of the myth, Quetzalcoatl was born by a virgin named Chimalman, to whom the god Onteol appeared in a dream.J. B. Bierlein, Living Myths. How Myth Gives Meaning to Human Experience, Ballantine Books, 1999 In another story, the virgin Chimalman conceived Quetzalcoatl by swallowing an emerald.Carrasco 1982 A third story narrates that Chimalman was hit in the womb by an arrow shot by Mixcoatl and nine months later she gave birth to a child which was called Quetzalcoatl. A fourth story narrates that Quetzalcoatl was born from Coatlicue, who already had four hundred children who formed the stars of the Milky Way. According to another version of the myth, Quetzalcoatl is one of the four sons of Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl, the four Tezcatlipocas, each of whom presides over one of the four cardinal directions. Over the West presides the White Tezcatlipoca, Quetzalcoatl, the god of light, justice, mercy and wind. Over the South presides the Blue Tezcatlipoca, Huitzilopochtli, the god of war. Over the East presides the Red Tezcatlipoca, Xipe Totec, the god of gold, farming and springtime. And over the North presides the Black Tezcatlipoca, known by no other name than Tezcatlipoca, the god of judgment, night, deceit, sorcery and the Earth.Smith 2003 Quetzalcoatl was often considered the god of the morning star, and his twin brother Xolotl was the evening star (Venus). As the morning star, he was known by the title Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, meaning \\"lord of the star of the dawn\\". He was known as the inventor of books and the calendar, the giver of maize (corn) to mankind, and sometimes as a symbol of death and resurrection. Quetzalcoatl was also the patron of the priests and the title of the twin Aztec high priests. Some legends describe him as opposed to human sacrifice while others describe him practicing it.Carrasco 1982 p. 145 Most Mesoamerican beliefs included cycles of suns. Often our current time was considered the fifth sun, the previous four having been destroyed by flood, fire and the like. Quetzalcoatl went to Mictlan, the underworld, and created fifth-world mankind from the bones of the previous races (with the help of Cihuacoatl), using his own blood, from a wound he inflicted on his earlobes, calves, tongue, and penis, to imbue the bones with new life. It is also suggested that he was a son of Xochiquetzal and Mixcoatl. In the Codex Chimalpopoca, it is said Quetzalcoatl was coerced by Tezcatlipoca into becoming drunk on pulque, cavorting with his older sister, Quetzalpetlatl, a celibate priestess, and neglecting their religious duties. (Many academics conclude this passage implies incest.) The next morning, Quetzalcoatl, feeling shame and regret, had his servants build him a stone chest, adorn him in turquoise, and then, laying in the chest, set himself on fire. His ashes rose into the sky and then his heart followed, becoming the morning star (see Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli). Belief in Cort√©s as Quetzalcoatl Quetzalcoatl in human form, using the symbols of Ehecatl, from the Codex Borgia. Since the sixteenth century, it has been widely held that the Aztec Emperor Moctezuma II initially believed the landing of Hern√°n Cort√©s in 1519 to be Quetzalcoatl's return. This view has been questioned by ethno-historians who argue that the Quetzalcoatl-Cort√©s connection is not found in any document that was created independently of post-Conquest Spanish influence, and that there is little proof of a pre- Hispanic belief in Quetzalcoatl's return.Gillespie 1989Townsend 2003aTownsend 2003bRestall 2003aRestall 2003b Most documents expounding this theory are of entirely Spanish origin, such as Cort√©s's letters to Charles V of Spain, in which Cort√©s goes to great pains to present the naive gullibility of the Aztecs in general as a great aid in his conquest of Mexico. Much of the idea of Cort√©s being seen as a deity can be traced back to the Florentine Codex written down some 50 years after the conquest. In the Codex's description of the first meeting between Moctezuma and Cort√©s, the Aztec ruler is described as giving a prepared speech in classical oratorial Nahuatl, a speech which, as described in the codex written by the Franciscan Bernardino de Sahag√∫n and his Tlatelolcan informants, included such prostrate declarations of divine or near-divine admiration as: and: Quetzalcoatl in feathered-serpent form as depicted in the Codex Telleriano-Remensis Subtleties in, and an imperfect scholarly understanding of, high Nahuatl rhetorical style make the exact intent of these comments tricky to ascertain, but Restall argues that Moctezuma's politely offering his throne to Cort√©s (if indeed he did ever give the speech as reported) may well have been meant as the exact opposite of what it was taken to mean: politeness in Aztec culture was a way to assert dominance and show superiority. This speech, which has been widely referred to, has been a factor in the widespread belief that Moctezuma was addressing Cort√©s as the returning god Quetzalcoatl. Other parties have also promulgated the idea that the Mesoamericans believed the conquistadors, and in particular Cort√©s, to be awaited gods: most notably the historians of the Franciscan order such as Fray Ger√≥nimo de Mendieta.Martinez 1980 Some Franciscans at this time held millennarian beliefsPhelan 1956 and some of them believed that Cort√©s' coming to the New World ushered in the final era of evangelization before the coming of the millennium. Franciscans such as Toribio de Benavente \\"Motolinia\\" saw elements of Christianity in the pre-Columbian religions and therefore believed that Mesoamerica had been evangelized before, possibly by Thomas the Apostle, who, according to legend, had \\"gone to preach beyond the Ganges\\". Franciscans then equated the original Quetzalcoatl with Thomas and imagined that the Indians had long-awaited his return to take part once again in God's kingdom. Historian Matthew Restall concludes that: Quetzalcoatl as depicted in the post-Conquest Tovar Codex. Some scholarship maintains the view that the Aztec Empire's fall may be attributed in part to the belief in Cort√©s as the returning Quetzalcoatl, notably in works by David Carrasco (1982), H. B. Nicholson (2001 (1957)) and John Pohl (2016). However, a majority of Mesoamericanist scholars, such as Matthew Restall (2003, 2018), James Lockhart (1994), Susan D. Gillespie (1989), Camilla Townsend (2003a, 2003b), Louise Burkhart, Michel Graulich and Michael E. Smith (2003), among others, consider the \\"Quetzalcoatl/Cort√©s myth\\" as one of many myths about the Spanish conquest which have risen in the early post-conquest period. There is no question that the legend of Quetzalcoatl played a significant role in the colonial period. However, this legend likely has a foundation in events that took place immediately prior to the arrival of the Spaniards. A 2012 exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Dallas Museum of Art, \\"The Children of the Plumed Serpent: the Legacy of Quetzalcoatl in Ancient Mexico\\", demonstrated the existence of a powerful confederacy of Eastern Nahuas, Mixtecs and Zapotecs, along with the peoples they dominated throughout southern Mexico between 1200‚Äì1600 (Pohl, Fields, and Lyall 2012, Harvey 2012, Pohl 2003). They maintained a major pilgrimage and commercial center at Cholula, Puebla which the Spaniards compared to both Rome and Mecca because the cult of the god united its constituents through a field of common social, political, and religious values without dominating them militarily. This confederacy engaged in almost seventy-five years of nearly continuous conflict with the Aztec Empire of the Triple Alliance until the arrival of Cort√©s. Members of this confederacy from Tlaxcala, Puebla, and Oaxaca provided the Spaniards with the army that first reclaimed the city of Cholula from its pro- Aztec ruling faction, and ultimately defeated the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan (Mexico City). The Tlaxcalteca, along with other city-states across the Plain of Puebla, then supplied the auxiliary and logistical support for the conquests of Guatemala and West Mexico while Mixtec and Zapotec caciques (Colonial indigenous rulers) gained monopolies in the overland transport of Manila galleon trade through Mexico, and formed highly lucrative relationships with the Dominican order in the new Spanish imperial world economic system that explains so much of the enduring legacy of indigenous life-ways that characterize southern Mexico and explain the popularity of the Quetzalcoatl legends that continued through the colonial period to the present day. Contemporary use  Latter Day Saints movement  Quetzalcoatl Mural in Acapulco by Diego Rivera According to the Book of Mormon, the resurrected Jesus Christ descended from heaven and visited the people of the American continent, shortly after his resurrection. Some followers of the Latter Day Saints movement believe that Quetzalcoatl was historically Jesus Christ, but believe his name and the details of the event were gradually lost over time. Quetzalcoatl is not a religious symbol in the Latter-day Saint faith, and is not taught as such, nor is it in their doctrine that Quetzalcoatl is Jesus.Wirth 2002 However, one president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, John Taylor, wrote:Taylor 1892 p. 201 > The story of the life of the Mexican divinity, Quetzalcoatl, closely > resembles that of the Savior; so closely, indeed, that we can come to no > other conclusion than that Quetzalcoatl and Christ are the same being. But > the history of the former has been handed down to us through an impure > Lamanitish source, which has sadly disfigured and perverted the original > incidents and teachings of the Savior's life and ministry. :‚Äî Mediation and > Atonement, p. 194. Latter-day Saint author Brant Gardner, after investigating the link between Quetzalcoatl and Jesus, concluded that the association amounts to nothing more than folklore.Blair 2008 In a 1986 paper for Sunstone, he noted that during the Spanish Conquest, the Native Americans and the Catholic priests who sympathized with them felt pressure to link Native American beliefs with Christianity, thus making the Native Americans seem more human and less savage. Over time, Quetzalcoatl's appearance, clothing, malevolent nature, and status among the gods were reshaped to fit a more Christian framework.Gardner 1986  In media  Quetzalcoatl was fictionalized in the 1982 film Q as a monster that terrorizes New York City. The deity has been featured as a character in the manga and anime series Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's, Fate/Grand Order - Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia, Beyblade: Metal Fusion and Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid (the latter depicting Quetzalcoatl as a female dragon deity); the Megami Tensei video game franchise; the video games Fate/Grand Order, Final Fantasy VIII, Final Fantasy XV, Sanitarium, Smite (as an alternate costume for his Mayan counterpart, Kukulkan), and Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine; as the main antagonist in the Star Trek: The Animated Series episode \\"How Sharper Than a Serpent's Tooth\\"; and in the last of The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel books. Quetzelcoatl also appeared on (Season 3) of the Animal Planet mockumentary Lost Tapes in an episode entitled \\"Q the Serpent God\\". In 1971 Tony Shearer published a book called Lord of the Dawn: Quetzalcoatl and the Tree of Life, inspiring New Age followers to visit Chichen Itza at the summer solstice when dragon-shaped shadows are cast by the Kulkulcan pyramid. In popular culture Beginning during the crisis at Standing Rock in 2016, in parallel with the phrase \\"Mni Wiconi\\" (\\"Water is Life\\"), support from Mexican, Mexican-American, and Mexican indigenous populations included use of the phrase in Spanish \\"Agua es Vida\\". Frequently pictured with this phrase was either Tlaloc or Quetzalcoatl as a serpent, or at times both. Quetzalcoatl being the teotl of life, and Tlaloc being the teotl of rain and sustenance, they are often paired with each other dating back to pre-Columbian times, and this practice continues today, as was seen in support of the Standing Rock Lakota and in other contemporary struggles for water rights.  Other uses  Mexico's flagship airline Aerom√©xico has a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner painted in a special Quezalcoatl livery.

Both the adults and larvae feed on the emergent leaves of the elm. Repeated heavy infestation rarely kills the tree outright, but weakens it, rendering it vulnerable to disease. Falling branches encourage elm bark beetles to proliferate; the beetles are vectors of Dutch elm disease. However, they do not transmit the disease. Elm leaf beetles become active in the spring once temperatures rise above 52¬∞F (11¬∞C). In fact, weather is one of the most limiting factors in their population growth. A late spring freeze or long winter can kill off entire colonies. The imagines depart their hibernation sites (often houses), the females laying their ova on the underside of the elm leaves. The ova hatch after one week, and the larvae immediately feed on the underside of the leaves. This larval stage lasts between two and three weeks, at the end of which larvae migrate to the lower part of the trees in search of bark crevices in which to pupate. The next generation emerges in midsummer after two to three weeks' pupation, and begins feeding on the leaves. The female can lay about 800 ova, but this ovipositing may be interrupted by shortening of the photoperiod to less than 14 hours, inducing a brief feeding bout before the search for a hibernation site. Hosts are known to include English elm (U. minor 'Atinia'), wych (Scots) elm (Ulmus glabra), American elm (Ulmus americana), Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila), and Chinese elm (Ulmus parvifolia), as well as complex hybrids such as 'Homestead'.http://www.treetec.net.au/elm-leaf-beetle-removal.php The beetle has also been reported on Zelkova serrata.Sinclair et al. 1987 Symptoms The first and most apparent symptoms are of skeletonization. During feeding, elm leaf beetle larvae skeletonize the leaves. They leave the outer edge and veins of the leaf intact, which gives the foliage a net-like appearance. Areas around the feeding site dry up and die, causing the leaf to drop prematurely. Adults, on the other hand, chew small, irregularly shaped holes in the expanding leaves. Trees that lose their leaves often develop a second set, only to have them consumed when the next generation is produced. Controls In North America, there are few natural enemies, but in Europe, the larva of the beetle are often heavily predated by the chalcidoid wasp Oomyzus gallerucae.Meiners, T, and Hilker, M. (1997). Host location in Oomyzus gallerucae (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), an egg parasitoid of the elm leaf beetle Xanthogalereuca luteola (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). Oecologia, Vol. 112, No. 1 / Sept. 1997, pp 87-93. Springer Berlin / Heidelberg. ISSN 0029-8549 (print), 1432-1939 (online) Insecticide sprays are of little use since by the time the infestation is apparent, the application will be too late to be effective. However, tree trunks banded with insecticides can limit repetition the following year by killing the larvae as they descend before hibernation. Soil injection presents a non-invasive alternative to trunk injections with a 2-year effect on the X. luteola population. Since overwintering elm leaf beetles infest the homes of those close to an elm leaf beetle infestation, it is suggested that all cracks outside the house should be sealed. It is discouraged to use insecticides unless there are really heavy colonies. Nearly all chemicals currently used commercially in Australia to treat Elm Leaf Beetle, regardless of brand name or delivery method, are neonicotinoid insecticides. This is the chemical type that has had (2016) a two-year ban placed on it by the European Commission, owing to the association between the widespread use of these chemicals and their impact on bee populations.

He overthrew his father and ruled during the mythological Golden Age, until he was overthrown by his own son Zeus and imprisoned in Tartarus. According to Plato, however, the deities Phorcys, Cronus, and Rhea were the eldest children of Oceanus and Tethys.Plato. Timaeus 40e. Translated by W.R.M. Lamb. Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1925. Cronus was usually depicted with a harpe, scythe or a sickle, which was the instrument he used to castrate and depose Uranus, his father. In Athens, on the twelfth day of the Attic month of Hekatombaion, a festival called Kronia was held in honour of Cronus to celebrate the harvest, suggesting that, as a result of his association with the virtuous Golden Age, Cronus continued to preside as a patron of the harvest. Cronus was also identified in classical antiquity with the Roman deity Saturn.  Mythology  In an ancient myth recorded by Hesiod's Theogony, Cronus envied the power of his father, the ruler of the universe, Uranus. Uranus drew the enmity of Cronus's mother, Gaia, when he hid the gigantic youngest children of Gaia, the hundred-handed Hecatoncheires and one-eyed Cyclopes, in Tartarus, so that they would not see the light. Gaia created a great stone sickle and gathered together Cronus and his brothers to persuade them to castrate Uranus.Hesiod, Theogony 154‚Äì166. 233x233px Only Cronus was willing to do the deed, so Gaia gave him the sickle and placed him in ambush. Hesiod, Theogony 167‚Äì206. . When Uranus met with Gaia, Cronus attacked him with the sickle, castrating him and casting his testicles into the sea. From the blood that spilled out from Uranus and fell upon the earth, the Gigantes, Erinyes, and Meliae were produced. The testicles produced a white foam from which the goddess Aphrodite emerged. For this, Uranus threatened vengeance and called his sons TitenesŒ§ŒπœÑ·øÜŒΩŒµœÇ; according to Hesiod meaning \\"straining ones,\\" the source of the word \\"titan\\", but this etymology is disputed. for overstepping their boundaries and daring to commit such an act.in an alternate version of this myth, a more benevolent Cronus overthrew the wicked serpentine Titan Ophion and in doing so he released the world from bondage and for a time ruled it justly. After dispatching Uranus, Cronus re-imprisoned the Hecatoncheires, and the Cyclopes and set the dragon Campe to guard them. He and his older sister Rhea took the throne of the world as king and queen. The period in which Cronus ruled was called the Golden Age, as the people of the time had no need for laws or rules; everyone did the right thing, and immorality was absent. Painting by Peter Paul Rubens of Cronus devouring one of his children Cronus learned from Gaia and Uranus that he was destined to be overcome by his own sons, just as he had overthrown his father. As a result, although he sired the gods Demeter, Hestia, Hera, Hades and Poseidon by Rhea, he devoured them all as soon as they were born to prevent the prophecy. When the sixth child, Zeus, was born Rhea sought Gaia to devise a plan to save them and to eventually get retribution on Cronus for his acts against his father and children. Rhea secretly gave birth to Zeus in Crete, and handed Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes, also known as the Omphalos Stone, which he promptly swallowed, thinking that it was his son. Rhea kept Zeus hidden in a cave on Mount Ida, Crete. According to some versions of the story, he was then raised by a goat named Amalthea, while a company of Kouretes, armored male dancers, shouted and clapped their hands to make enough noise to mask the baby's cries from Cronus. Other versions of the myth have Zeus raised by the nymph Adamanthea, who hid Zeus by dangling him by a rope from a tree so that he was suspended between the earth, the sea, and the sky, all of which were ruled by his father, Cronus. Still other versions of the tale say that Zeus was raised by his grandmother, Gaia. Once he had grown up, Zeus used an emetic given to him by Gaia to force Cronus to disgorge the contents of his stomach in reverse order: first the stone, which was set down at Pytho under the glens of Mount Parnassus to be a sign to mortal men, and then his two brothers and three sisters. In other versions of the tale, Metis gave Cronus an emetic to force him to disgorge the children.Apollodorus, 1.2.1. After freeing his siblings, Zeus released the Hecatoncheires, and the Cyclopes who forged for him his thunderbolts, Poseidon's trident and Hades' helmet of darkness. In a vast war called the Titanomachy, Zeus and his older brothers and older sisters, with the help of the Hecatoncheires and Cyclopes, overthrew Cronus and the other Titans. Afterwards, many of the Titans were confined in Tartarus. However, Oceanus, Helios, Atlas, Prometheus, Epimetheus and Menoetius were not imprisoned following the Titanomachy. Gaia bore the monster Typhon to claim revenge for the imprisoned Titans. Accounts of the fate of Cronus after the Titanomachy differ. In Homeric and other texts he is imprisoned with the other Titans in Tartarus. In Orphic poems, he is imprisoned for eternity in the cave of Nyx. Pindar describes his release from Tartarus, where he is made King of Elysium by Zeus. In another version, the Titans released the Cyclopes from Tartarus, and Cronus was awarded the kingship among them, beginning a Golden Age. In Virgil's Aeneid, it is Latium to which Saturn (Cronus) escapes and ascends as king and lawgiver, following his defeat by his son Jupiter (Zeus). One other account referred by Robert Graves,Graves, Robert, Hebrew Myths 21.4 who claims to be following the account of the Byzantine mythographer Tzetzes, it is said that Cronus was castrated by his son Zeus just like he had done with his father Uranus before. However the subject of a son castrating his own father, or simply castration in general, was so repudiated by the Greek mythographers of that time that they suppressed it from their accounts until the Christian era (when Tzetzes wrote). The Fall of the Titans, Cornelis Cornelisz van Haarlem, 1596-1598  Libyan account by Diodorus Siculus  In a Libyan account related by Diodorus Siculus (Book 3), Uranus and Titaea were the parents of Cronus and Rhea and the other Titans. Ammon, a king of Libya, married Rhea (3.18.1). However, Rhea abandoned Ammon and married her younger brother Cronus. With Rhea's incitement, Cronus and the other Titans made war upon Ammon, who fled to Crete (3.71.1-2). Cronus ruled harshly and Cronus in turn was defeated by Ammon's son Dionysus (3.71.3-3.73) who appointed Cronus' and Rhea's son, Zeus, as king of Egypt (3.73.4). Dionysus and Zeus then joined their forces to defeat the remaining Titans in Crete, and on the death of Dionysus, Zeus inherited all the kingdoms, becoming lord of the world (3.73.7-8).  Sibylline Oracles  Cronus is mentioned in the Sibylline Oracles, particularly in book three, which makes Cronus, 'Titan' and Iapetus, the three sons of Uranus and Gaia, each to receive a third division of the Earth, and Cronus is made king over all. After the death of Uranus, Titan's sons attempt to destroy Cronus's and Rhea's male offspring as soon as they are born, but at Dodona, Rhea secretly bears her sons Zeus, Poseidon and Hades and sends them to Phrygia to be raised in the care of three Cretans. Upon learning this, sixty of Titan's men then imprison Cronus and Rhea, causing the sons of Cronus to declare and fight the first of all wars against them. This account mentions nothing about Cronus either killing his father or attempting to kill any of his children.  Other accounts  Cronus was said to be the father of the wise centaur Chiron by the Oceanid Philyra, who was subsequently transformed into a linden tree.Tzetzes on Lycophron, 1200Pliny the Elder, Natural History 7. 197Scholia on Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 2.1235 citing Pherecydes The Titan chased the nymph and consorted with her in the shape of a stallion, hence the half- human, half-equine shape of their offspring;Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 2. 1231 ffScholia on Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 1. 554 this was said to have taken place on Mount Pelion.Callimachus, Hymn 4 to Delos 104 ff Two other sons of Cronus and Philyra may have been DolopsHyginus, Fabulae, Preface and Aphrus, the ancestor and eponym of the Aphroi, i.e. the native Africans.Suda s.v. Aphroi In some accounts, Cronus was also called the father of the Corybantes.Strabo, Geographica 10.3.19  Name and comparative mythology   Antiquity  During antiquity, Cronus was occasionally interpreted as Chronos, the personification of time.ŒöœÅœåŒΩŒøœÇ: Cronos ‚Äî Later interpreted as chronos (time): LSJ entry ŒöœÅœåŒΩŒøœÇ The Roman philosopher Cicero (1st century BCE) elaborated on this by saying that the Greek name Cronus is synonymous to chronos (time) since he maintains the course and cycles of seasons and the periods of time, whereas the Latin name Saturn denotes that he is saturated with years since he was devouring his sons, which implies that time devours the ages and gorges.Cicero, De Natura Deorum 25 The Greek historian and biographer Plutarch (1st century CE) asserted that the Greeks believed that Cronus was an allegorical name for œáœÅœåŒΩŒøœÇ (time).These men [the Egyptians] are like the Greeks who say that Cronus is but a metaphorical name for œáœÅœåŒΩŒøœÇ (time). Plutarch, On Isis and Osiris, 32 The philosopher Plato (3rd century BCE) in his Cratylus gives two possible interpretations for the name of Cronus. The first is that his name denotes \\"Œ∫œåœÅŒøœÇ\\" (koros), the pure (Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œ±œÅœåŒΩ) and unblemished (·ºÄŒ∫ŒÆœÅŒ±œÑŒøŒΩ) nature of his mind.Plato, Cratylus, 402b The second is that Rhea and Cronus were given names of streams (Rhea ‚Äì ·ø•ŒøŒÆ (rhoƒì) and Cronus ‚Äì XœÅœåŒΩŒøœÇ (chronos)).Plato, Cratylus, 402b Proclus (5th century CE), the Neoplatonist philosopher, makes in his Commentary on Plato's Cratylus an extensive analysis on Cronus; among others he says that the \\"One cause\\" of all things is \\"Chronos\\" (time) that is also equivocal to Cronus.Proclus, Commentary on Plato's Cratylus, 396B7 Chronos and his child by Giovanni Francesco Romanelli, National Museum in Warsaw, a 17th-century depiction of Titan Cronus as \\"Father Time,\\" wielding a harvesting scythe In addition to the name, the story of Cronus eating his children was also interpreted as an allegory to a specific aspect of time held within Cronus' sphere of influence. As the theory went, Cronus represented the destructive ravages of time which devoured all things, a concept that was illustrated when the Titan king ate the Olympian gods ‚Äî the past consuming the future, the older generation suppressing the next generation.Dronke, Peter. (edit.) Marenbon, John. Poetry and Philosophy in the Middle Ages, Leiden, The Netherlands. BRILL, 2001; pg. 316  From the Renaissance to the present  During the Renaissance, the identification of Cronus and Chronos gave rise to \\"Father Time\\" wielding the harvesting scythe. H. J. Rose in 1928Rose, A Handbook of Greek Mythology 1928:43. observed that attempts to give \\"ŒöœÅœåŒΩŒøœÇ\\" a Greek etymology had failed. Recently, Janda (2010) offers a genuinely Indo-European etymology of \\"the cutter\\", from the root *(s)ker- \\"to cut\\" (Greek Œ∫ŒµŒØœÅœâ (keir≈ç), cf. English shear), motivated by Cronus's characteristic act of \\"cutting the sky\\" (or the genitals of anthropomorphic Uranus). The Indo-Iranian reflex of the root is kar, generally meaning \\"to make, create\\" (whence karma), but Janda argues that the original meaning \\"to cut\\" in a cosmogonic sense is still preserved in some verses of the Rigveda pertaining to Indra's heroic \\"cutting\\", like that of Cronus resulting in creation: This may point to an older Indo-European mytheme reconstructed as ' \\"by means of a cut he created the loftiness of the sky\\".Michael Janda, Die Musik nach dem Chaos, Innsbruck, 2010, 54-56. The myth of Cronus castrating Uranus parallels the Song of Kumarbi, where Anu (the heavens) is castrated by Kumarbi. In the Song of Ullikummi, Teshub uses the \\"sickle with which heaven and earth had once been separated\\" to defeat the monster Ullikummi,Fritz Graf, Thomas Marier, trans. Thomas Marier, Greek mythology: an introduction, 1996 , p. 88. establishing that the \\"castration\\" of the heavens by means of a sickle was part of a creation myth, in origin a cut creating an opening or gap between heaven (imagined as a dome of stone) and earth enabling the beginning of time (chronos) and human history.Janda 2010, p. 54 and passim. A theory debated in the 19th century, and sometimes still offered somewhat apologetically,\\"We would like to consider whether the Semitic stem q r nmight be connected with the name Kronos,\\" suggests A. P. Bos, as late as 1989, in Cosmic and Meta-cosmic Theology in Aristotle's Lost Dialogues, 1989:11 note 26. holds that ŒöœÅœåŒΩŒøœÇ is related to \\"horned\\", assuming a Semitic derivation from qrn.As in H. Lewy, Die semitischen Fremdw√∂rter in Griechischen, 1895:216. and Robert Brown, The Great Dionysiak Myth, 1877, ii.127. \\"Kronos signifies 'the Horned one'\\", the Rev. Alexander Hislop had previously asserted in The Two Babylons; or, The papal worship proved to be the worship of Nimrod and his wife, Hislop, 2nd ed. 1862 (p.46). with the note \\"From krn, a horn. The epithet Carneus applied to Apollo is just a different form of the same word. In the Orphic Hymns, Apollo is addressed as 'the Two- Horned god'\\". Andrew Lang's objection, that Cronus was never represented horned in Hellenic art,Lang, Modern Mythology 1897:35. was addressed by Robert Brown,Brown, Semitic Influence in Hellenic Mythology, 1898:112ff. arguing that, in Semitic usage, as in the Hebrew Bible, qeren was a signifier of \\"power\\". When Greek writers encountered the Semitic deity El, they rendered his name as Cronus.\\"Phil√¥n, who of course regarded Kronos as an Hellenic divinity, which indeed he became, always renders the name of the Semitic god √él or √äl ('the Powerful') by 'Kronos', in which usage we have a lingering feeling of the real meaning of the name\\" (Brown 1898:116) Robert Graves remarks that \\"cronos probably means 'crow', like the Latin cornix and the Greek cor≈çne\\", noting that Cronus was depicted with a crow, as were the deities Apollo, Asclepius, Saturn and Bran.  El, the Phoenician Cronus  When Hellenes encountered Phoenicians and, later, Hebrews, they identified the Semitic El, by interpretatio graeca, with Cronus. The association was recorded c. AD 100 by Philo of Byblos' Phoenician history, as reported in Eusebius' Pr√¶paratio Evangelica I.10.16.Walcot, \\"Five or Seven Recesses?\\" The Classical Quarterly, New Series, 15.1 (May 1965), p. 79. The quote stands as Philo Fr. 2. Philo's account, ascribed by Eusebius to the semi-legendary pre-Trojan War Phoenician historian Sanchuniathon, indicates that Cronus was originally a Canaanite ruler who founded Byblos and was subsequently deified. This version gives his alternate name as Elus or Ilus, and states that in the 32nd year of his reign, he emasculated, slew and deified his father Epigeius or Autochthon \\"whom they afterwards called Uranus\\". It further states that after ships were invented, Cronus, visiting the 'inhabitable world', bequeathed Attica to his own daughter Athena, and Egypt to Taautus the son of Misor and inventor of writing.Eusebius of Caesarea: Praeparatio Evangelica Book 1, Chapter 10.  Roman mythology and later culture  4th-century Temple of Saturn in the Roman Forum. While the Greeks considered Cronus a cruel and tempestuous force of chaos and disorder, believing the Olympian gods had brought an era of peace and order by seizing power from the crude and malicious Titans, the Romans took a more positive and innocuous view of the deity, by conflating their indigenous deity Saturn with Cronus. Consequently, while the Greeks considered Cronus merely an intermediary stage between Uranus and Zeus, he was a larger aspect of Roman religion. The Saturnalia was a festival dedicated in his honour, and at least one temple to Saturn already existed in the archaic Roman Kingdom. His association with the \\"Saturnian\\" Golden Age eventually caused him to become the god of \\"time\\", i.e., calendars, seasons, and harvests‚Äînot now confused with Chronos, the unrelated embodiment of time in general. Nevertheless, among Hellenistic scholars in Alexandria and during the Renaissance, Cronus was conflated with the name of Chronos, the personification of \\"Father Time\\", wielding the harvesting scythe. As a result of Cronus's importance to the Romans, his Roman variant, Saturn, has had a large influence on Western culture. The seventh day of the Judaeo-Christian week is called in Latin Dies Saturni (\\"Day of Saturn\\"), which in turn was adapted and became the source of the English word Saturday. In astronomy, the planet Saturn is named after the Roman deity. It is the outermost of the Classical planets (the astronomical planets that are visible with the naked eye).  Astronomy  A star (HD 240430) was named after him in 2017 when it was reported to have swallowed its planets. The planet Saturn, named after the Roman equivalent of Cronus, is still referred to as \\"Cronus\\" in modern Greek. \\"Cronus\\" was also a suggested name for the dwarf planet Pluto, but was rejected and not voted for because it was suggested by the unpopular and egocentric astronomer Thomas Jefferson Jackson See.

He was described as a god of generation, dissolution, plenty, wealth, agriculture, periodic renewal and liberation. Saturn's mythological reign was depicted as a Golden Age of plenty and peace. After the Roman conquest of Greece, he was conflated with the Greek Titan Cronus, becoming known as a god of time. Saturn's consort was his sister Ops, with whom he fathered Jupiter, Neptune, Pluto, Juno, Ceres and Vesta. Saturn was especially celebrated during the festival of Saturnalia each December, perhaps the most famous of the Roman festivals, a time of feasting, role reversals, free speech, gift-giving and revelry. The Temple of Saturn in the Roman Forum housed the state treasury and archives (aerarium) of the Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire. The planet Saturn and the day of the week Saturday are both named after him. Mythology  The Roman land preserved the remembrance of a very remote time during which Saturn and Janus reigned on the site of the city before its foundation: the Capitol was called .B. Liou Gilles \\"Naissance de la ligue latine. Mythe et cult de fondation\\" in Revue belge de philologie et d' histoire 74 1. pp. 73‚Äì97: 75. . Citing Festus s.v. Saturnia p. 430 L: \\"Saturnia Italia, et mons, qui nunc est Capitolinus, Saturnius appellabatur, quod in tutela Saturni esse existimantur. Saturnii quoque dicebantur, qui castrum in imo clivo Capitolino incolebant, ubi ara diacata ei deo ante bellum troianum videtur.\\" And Ovid \\"Fasti\\" 6, 31: \\"A patre dicta meo quondam Saturnia Roma est\\". The Romans identified Saturn with the Greek Cronus, whose myths were adapted for Latin literature and Roman art. In particular, Cronus's role in the genealogy of the Greek gods was transferred to Saturn. As early as Livius Andronicus (3rd century BC), Jupiter was called the son of Saturn.Saturni filius, frg. 2 in the edition of Baehrens. Saturn had two mistresses who represented different aspects of the god. The name of his wife, Ops, the Roman equivalent of Greek Rhea, means \\"wealth, abundance, resources.\\"Hans Friedrich Mueller, \\"Saturn,\\" Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 222. The association with Ops is considered a later development, however, as this goddess was originally paired with Consus.G. Dum√©zil p. 244. Earlier was Saturn's association with Lua (\\"destruction, dissolution, loosening\\"), a goddess who received the bloodied weapons of enemies destroyed in war.G. Dum√©zil \\"Lua Mater\\" in D√©esses latines et mythes v√©diques Bruxelles 1968 1959 pp. 98‚Äì115. D. compared this Roman figure with Indian deity N√≠r≈óti. Under Saturn's rule, humans enjoyed the spontaneous bounty of the earth without labour in the \\"Golden Age\\" described by Hesiod and Ovid. He became known as the god of time. Etymology and epithets According to Varro,Varro, De lingua latina 5.64. Saturn's name was derived from satus, meaning \\"sowing\\". Even though this etymology looks implausible on linguistic grounds (for the long quantity of the a in SƒÅturnus and also because of the epigraphically attested form Saeturnus),CIL I 2nd 449. nevertheless it does reflect an original feature of the god.Briquel p. 144. A more probable etymology connects the name with Etruscan god Satre and placenames such as Satria, an ancient town of Latium, and Saturae palus, a marsh also in Latium. This root may be related to Latin phytonym satureia.G. Alessio \\"Genti e favelle dell' antica Apulia\\" Taranto Cressati 1949 = Archivio Storico Pugliese 1949 II 1 p. 14. Another epithet, variably Sterculius, Stercutus, and Sterces, referred to his agricultural functions;Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.7.25. this derives from stercus, \\"dung\\" or \\"manure\\", referring to re-emergence from death to life.Frederick Kaufman in Harper's Magazine, February 2008: Wasteland. A journey through the American cloaca. Agriculture was important to Roman identity, and Saturn was a part of archaic Roman religion and ethnic identity. His name appears in the ancient hymn of the Salian priests,Festus, De verborum significatu 432L. and his temple was the oldest known to have been recorded by the pontiffs. Quintus Lucilius Balbus gives a separate etymology in Cicero's De Natura Deorum (On the Nature of the Gods). In this interpretation, the agricultural aspect of Saturn would be secondary to his primary relation with time and seasons. Since Time consumes all things, Balbus asserts that the name Saturn comes from the Latin word satis; Saturn being an anthropomorphic representation of Time, which is filled, or satiated, by all things or all generations. Since agriculture is so closely linked to seasons and therefore an understanding of the cyclical passage of time, it follows that agriculture would then be associated with the deity Saturn. Temple The temple of Saturn was located at the base of the Capitoline Hill, according to a tradition recorded by VarroVarro Lingua Latina V 52. formerly known as Saturnius Mons, and a row of columns from the last rebuilding of the temple still stands.Mueller, \\"Saturn,\\" p. 222. The temple was consecrated in 497 BC but the area Saturni was built by king Tullus Hostilius as confirmed by archaeological studies conducted by E. Gjerstad.In M√©langes A. Grenier Bruxelles 1962 pp. 757-762 as cited by Briquel p. 141. It housed the state treasury (aerarium) throughout Roman history. Festival's time The position of Saturn's festival in the Roman calendar led to his association with concepts of time, especially the temporal transition of the New Year. In the Greek tradition, Cronus was sometimes conflated with Chronus, \\"Time,\\" and his devouring of his children taken as an allegory for the passing of generations. The sickle or scythe of Father Time is a remnant of the agricultural implement of Cronus-Saturn, and his aged appearance represents the waning of the old year with the birth of the new, in antiquity sometimes embodied by Aion. In late antiquity, Saturn is syncretized with a number of deities, and begins to be depicted as winged, as is Kairos, \\"Timing, Right Time\\".Samuel L. Macy, entry on \\"Father Time,\\" in Encyclopedia of Time (Taylor & Francis, 1994), pp. 208‚Äì209. In Roman religion Theology and worship Ruins of the Temple of Saturn (eight columns to the far right) in February 2010, with three columns from the Temple of Vespasian and Titus (left) and the Arch of Septimius Severus (center) The figure of Saturn is one of the most complex in Roman religion. G. Dum√©zil refrained from discussing Saturn in his work on Roman religion on the grounds of insufficient knowledge.G. Dum√©zil La religion romain archa√Øque Paris 1974 part I chap. 5; Italian translation Milan 1977 p. 244-245. Conversely, however, his follower Dominique Briquel has attempted a thorough interpretation of Saturn utilising Dum√©zil's three-functional theory of Indoeuropean religion, taking the ancient testimonies and the works of A. Brelich and G. Piccaluga as his basis.D. Briquel \\"Jupiter, Saturn et le Capitol. Essai de comparaison indoeurop√©enne\\" in Revue de l' histoire des religions 198 2 1981 pp. 131-162. A. Brelich Tre variazioni romane sul tema delle origini Roma 1956. G. Piccaluga Terminus Roma 1974. The main difficulty scholars find in studying Saturn is in assessing what is original of his figure and what is due to later hellenising influences. Moreover, some features of the god may be common to Cronus but are nonetheless very ancient and can be considered proper to the Roman god, whereas others are certainly later and arrived after 217 BCE, the year in which the Greek customs of the Kronia were introduced into the Saturnalia.Briquel 1981 pp. 142 ff. =Briquel's analysis= Among the features which are definitely authentic of the Roman god, Briquel identifies: # the time of his festival in the calendar, which corresponds to the date of the consecration of his temple (the Greek Cronia on the other hand took place in June‚ÄìJuly); # his association with Lua Mater, and # the location of his cult on the Capitol, which goes back to remote times.Macrobius Saturnalia I 7. Cited by Briquel above p. 143. These three elements in Briquel's view indicate that Saturn is a sovereign god. The god's strict relationship with the cults of the Capitoline Hill and in particular with Jupiter are highlighted by the legends concerning the refusal of gods Iuventas and Terminus to leave their abode in the shrines on the Capitol when the temple of Jupiter was to be built. These two deities correspond to the helper gods of the sovereign in Vedic religion (Briquel refers to Dhritarashtra and Vidura, the figures of the Mahabharata) and to the Cyclopes and Hecatoncheires in Hesiod. Whereas the helper gods belong to the second divine generation they become active only at the level of the third in each of the three instances of India, Greece and Rome, where they become a sort of continuation of Jupiter.Iuventas shows a clear Varunian character in the liaison of Romulus with the iuvenes the young soldiers; Terminus has a Mitran character even though he shows Varunian traits in allowing the enlargement of the borders (propagatio finium): Briquel p. 134 n. 8.) Dum√©zil postulated a split of the figure of the sovereign god in Indoeuropean religion, which is embodied by Vedic gods Varuna and Mitra.G. Dum√©zil Mitra-Varuna Paris 1940; Les dieux souverains des Indo-Europ√©√©ens Paris 1977. Of the two, the first one shows the aspect of the magic, uncanny, awe inspiring power of creation and destruction, while the second shows the reassuring aspect of guarantor of the legal order in organised social life. Whereas in Jupiter these double features have coalesced, Briquel sees Saturn as showing the characters of a sovereign god of the Varunian type. His nature becomes evident in his mastership over the annual time of crisis around the winter solstice, epitomised in the power of subverting normal codified social order and its rules, which is apparent in the festival of the Saturnalia, in the mastership of annual fertility and renewal, in the power of annihilation present in his paredra Lua, in the fact that he is the god of a timeless era of plenty and bounty before time, which he reinstates at the time of the yearly crisis of the winter solstice. In Roman and Etruscan reckoning Saturn is a wielder of lightning; no other agricultural god (in the sense of specialized human activity) is one.Briquel p. 151 citing Pliny II 138‚Äì139; Servius Ad Aeneidem I 42; XI 259. Saturn's lightningbolts are those of wintertime. Hence the mastership he has on agriculture and wealth cannot be that of a god of the third function, i.e. of production, wealth, and pleasure, but it stems from his magical lordship over creation and destruction. Although these features are to be found in Greek god Cronus as well, it appears that those features were proper to Roman Saturn's most ancient aspects, such as his presence on the Capitol and his association with Jupiter, who in the stories of the arrival of the Pelasgians in the land of the SicelsDionysius of Halicarnassus Roman Antiquities I.19.1; Macrobius Saturnalia I.7.27‚Äì31 and that of the Argei orders human sacrifices to him.Ovid Fasti V.621‚Äì662, particularly 626‚Äì629. Briquel concludes that Saturn was a sovereign god of a time that the Romans perceived as no longer actual, that of the legendary origins of the world, before civilization.Briquel p. 155. =Roman cult practices= Saturn with head protected by winter cloak, holding a sickle in his right hand (fresco from the House of the Dioscuri at Pompeii, Naples Archaeological Museum) Sacrifices to Saturn were performed according to \\"Greek rite\\" (ritus graecus), with the head uncovered, in contrast to those of other major Roman deities, which were performed capite velato, \\"with the head covered.\\" Saturn himself, however, was represented as veiled (involutus), as for example in a wall painting from Pompeii that shows him holding a sickle and covered with a white veil. This feature is in complete accord with the character of a sovereign god of the Varunian type and is common with German god Odin. Briquel remarks Servius had already seen that the choice of the Greek rite was due to the fact that the god himself is imagined and represented as veiled, thence his sacrifice cannot be carried out by a veiled man: this is an instance of the reversal of the current order of things typical of the nature of the deity as appears in its festival.Briquel p. 148 who cites Servius Ad Aenaeidem III 407. Plutarch writes his figure is veiled because he is the father of truth.Briquel p. 148 n. 63 who cites Plutarch Quaestiones Romanae II. Pliny notes that the cult statue of Saturn was filled with oil; the exact meaning of this is unclear.Pliny, Natural History 15.32. Its feet were bound with wool, which was removed only during the Saturnalia.Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.8.5. The fact that the statue was filled with oil and the feet were bound with wool may relate back to the myth of \\"The Castration of Uranus\\". In this myth Rhea gives Cronus a rock to eat in Zeus' stead, thus tricking Cronus. Although mastership of knots is a feature of Greek origin it is also typical of the Varunian sovereign figure, as apparent e.g. in Odin. Once Zeus was victorious over Cronus, he sets this stone up at Delphi and constantly it is anointed with oil and strands of unwoven wool are placed on it.Robert Graves, \\"The Greek Myths: 1\\" page 41 The stone wore a red cloak,Tertullian, De testimonio animae 2. and was brought out of the temple to take part in ritual processionsDionysius of Halicarnassus, Antiquitates Romanae 7.72.13. and lectisternia, banquets at which images of the gods were arranged as guests on couches. All these ceremonial details identify a sovereign figure. =Cult outside Rome= Little evidence exists in Italy for the cult of Saturn outside Rome, but his name resembles that of the Etruscan god Satres.Found on the Piacenza Liver; see also Martianus Capella 1.58. Mueller, \\"Saturn,\\" p. 222. The potential cruelty of Saturn was enhanced by his identification with Cronus, known for devouring his own children. He was thus used in translation when referring to gods from other cultures the Romans perceived as severe; he was equated with the Carthaginian god Baal Hammon, to whom children were sacrificed, and to Yahweh, whose Sabbath was referred to as Saturni dies, \\"Saturn's day,\\" in a poem by Tibullus, who wrote during the reign of Augustus; eventually this gave rise to the word \\"Saturday\\" in English.Mueller, \\"Saturn,\\" p. 221. The identification with Ba'al Hammon later gave rise to the African Saturn, a cult that enjoyed great popularity until the 4th century. Besides being a popular cult it also had the character of a mystery religion and required child sacrifices. It is also considered as inclining to monotheism.M. Leglay Saturn africaine. Histoire Paris BEFRA 1966. In the ceremony of initiation the ' (initiate) \\"intrat sub iugum\\" (\\"enters beneath the yoke\\"), a ritual that Leglay compares to the Roman tigillum sororium.Leglay pp. 385-386. Even though their origin and theology are completely different the Italic and the African god are both sovereign and master over time and death, a fact that has permitted their encounter. Moreover, the African Saturn is not directly derived from the Italic god, but rather from his Greek counterpart, Cronus. Saturnalia Saturn is associated with a major religious festival in the Roman calendar, Saturnalia. Saturnalia celebrated the harvest and sowing, and ran from December 17‚Äì23. During Saturnalia, the social restrictions of Rome were relaxed. The figure of Saturn, kept during the year with its legs bound in wool, was released from its bindings for the period of the festival. The revelries of Saturnalia were supposed to reflect the conditions of the lost \\"Golden Age\\" before the rule of Saturn was overthrown, not all of them desirable except as a temporary release from civilized constraint. The Greek equivalent was the Kronia.William F. Hansen, Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature (Cornell University Press, 2002), p. 385. Macrobius (5th century AD) presents an interpretation of the Saturnalia as a festival of light leading to the winter solstice.Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.1.8‚Äì9; Jane Chance, Medieval Mythography: From Roman North Africa to the School of Chartres, A.D. 433‚Äì1177 (University Press of Florida, 1994), p. 71. The renewal of light and the coming of the new year was celebrated in the later Roman Empire at the Dies Natalis of Sol Invictus, the \\"Birthday of the Unconquerable Sun,\\" on December 25.see Robert A. Kaster, Macrobius: Saturnalia, Books 1‚Äì2 (Loeb Classical Library, 2011), note on p. 16. Roman legend Relief held by the Louvre thought to depict the veiled throne of Saturn, either a Roman work of the 1st century AD or a Renaissance copy It was customary for the Romans to represent divine figures as kings of Latium at the time of their legendary origins. Macrobius states explicitly that the Roman legend of Janus and Saturn is an affabulation, as the true meaning of religious beliefs cannot be openly expressed.Macrobius Saturnalia I 7, 18. In the mythMacrobius Saturnalia I, 9; Vergil Aeneis VII, 49 Saturn was the original and autochthonous ruler of the Capitolium, which had thus been called the Mons Saturnius in older times and on which once stood the town of Saturnia.Varro Lingua Latina V 42 and 45; Vergil Aeneis VIII 357-8; Dionysius of Halicarnassus Roman Antiquities I 34; Festus p. 322 L; Macrobius Sat. I 7, 27 and I 10, 4; Pliny the Elder Natural History III 68; Minucius Felix Octavius 22; Tertullian Apologeticum 10 as cited by Briquel p. 154. He was sometimes regarded as the first king of Latium or even the whole of Italy.Versnel, \\"Saturnus and the Saturnalia,\\" pp. 138‚Äì139. At the same time, there was a tradition that Saturn had been an immigrant god, received by Janus after he was usurped by his son Jupiter and expelled from Greece.Versnel, \\"Saturnus and the Saturnalia,\\" p. 139\\\\. The Roman theologian Varro listed Saturn among the Sabine gods. In Versnel's view his contradictions‚Äîa foreigner with one of Rome's oldest sanctuaries, and a god of liberation who is kept in fetters most of the year‚Äîindicate Saturn's capacity for obliterating social distinctions.Versnel, \\"Saturnus and the Saturnalia,\\" pp. 139, 142‚Äì143.Alatri's main gate of the cyclopean walls The Golden Age of Saturn's reign in Roman mythology differed from the Greek tradition. He arrived in Italy \\"dethroned and fugitive,\\"Versnel, \\"Saturnus and the Saturnalia,\\" p. 143. but brought agriculture and civilization for which he was rewarded by Janus with a share of the kingdom, becoming himself king. As the Augustan poet Virgil described it, \\"He gathered together the unruly race\\" of fauns and nymphs \\"scattered over mountain heights, and gave them laws ... . Under his reign were the golden ages men tell of: in such perfect peace he ruled the nations.\\"Virgil, Aeneid 8.320‚Äì325, as cited by Versnel, \\"Saturnus and the Saturnalia,\\" p. 143. He was considered the ancestor of the Latin nation as he fathered Picus, the first king of Latium, who married Janus' daughter Canens and in his turn fathered Faunus. Saturn was also said to have founded the five Saturnian towns of Latium: Aletrium (today Alatri), Anagnia (Anagni), Arpinum (Arpino), Atina and Ferentinum (Ferentino, also known as Antinum) all located in the Latin Valley, province of Frosinone. All these towns are surrounded by cyclopean walls; their foundation is traditionally ascribed to the Pelasgians.Mario Pincherle, Giuliana C. Volpi: La civilt√† minoica in Italia. Le citt√† saturnie Pisa Pacini 1990. But Saturn also had a less benevolent aspect, as indicated by the blood shed in his honor during gladiatorial munera. His consort in archaic Roman tradition was Lua, sometimes called Lua Saturni (\\"Saturn's Lua\\") and identified with Lua Mater, \\"Mother Destruction,\\" a goddess in whose honor the weapons of enemies killed in war were burned, perhaps as expiation.Mueller, \\"Saturn,\\" in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome, p. 222. H.S. Versnel, however, proposed that Lua Saturni should not be identified with Lua Mater, but rather refers to \\"loosening\\"; she thus represents the liberating function of Saturn.Versnel, \\"Saturnus and the Saturnalia,\\" p. 144. Gladiatorial munera Saturn's chthonic nature connected him to the underworld and its ruler Dis Pater, the Roman equivalent of Greek Plouton (Pluto in Latin) who was also a god of hidden wealth.H.S. Versnel, \\"Saturnus and the Saturnalia,\\" in Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion: Transition and Reversal in Myth and Ritual (Brill, 1993, 1994), pp. 144‚Äì145. See also the Etruscan god Satre. In 3rd-century AD sources and later, Saturn is recorded as receiving gladiatorial offerings (munera) during or near the Saturnalia.For instance, Ausonius, Eclogue 23 and De feriis Romanis 33‚Äì7. See Versnel, \\"Saturnus and the Saturnalia,\\" pp. 146 and 211‚Äì212, and Thomas E.J. Wiedemann, Emperors and Gladiators (Routledge, 1992, 1995), p. 47. These gladiator combats, ten days in all throughout December, were presented by the quaestors and sponsored with funds from the treasury of Saturn.Eight days were subsidized from the Imperial treasury (arca fisci), and two mostly by the sponsoring magistrate himself; Michele Renee Salzman, On Roman Time: The Codex-Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity (University of California Press, 1990), p. 186. The practice of gladiatorial munera was criticized by Christian apologists as a form of human sacrifice.Mueller, \\"Saturn,\\" in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome, p. 222; Versnel, \\"Saturnus and the Saturnalia,\\" p. 146. Although there is no evidence of this practice during the Republican era, the offering of gladiators led to later theorizing that the primeval Saturn had demanded human victims. Macrobius says that Dis Pater was placated with human heads and Saturn with sacrificial victims consisting of men (virorum victimis).Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.7.31; Versnel, \\"Saturnus and the Saturnalia,\\" p. 146. The figurines that were exchanged as gifts (sigillaria) during the Saturnalia may have represented token substitutes.Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.10.24; Carlin A. Barton, The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans: The Gladiator and the Monster (Princeton University Press, 1993), p. 166. For other Roman practices that may represent substitutes for human sacrifice, see Argei and oscilla, the latter of which were used also at the Latin Festival and the Compitalia: William Warde Fowler, The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic (London, 1908), p. 272. On coins Saturn driving a quadriga on the reverse of a denarius issued by Saturninus In 104 BC, the plebeian tribune Lucius Appuleius Saturninus issued a denarius depicting Saturn driving a four-horse chariot (quadriga), a vehicle associated with rulers, triumphing generals, and sun gods. Saturninus was a popularist politician who had proposed reduced-price grain distribution to the poor of Rome. The head of the goddess Roma appears on the obverse. The Saturnian imagery played on the tribune's name and his intent to alter the social hierarchy to his advantage by basing his political support on the common people (plebs) rather than the senatorial elite.Versnel, \\"Saturnus and the Saturnalia,\\" p. 162.
