He also made allegorical paintings and some portraits. After commencing his career in the Spanish Netherlands, he later migrated to Frankfurt in Germany where he and other members of his extended family of artists played an important role in local artistic developments.Alexander Wied and Hans Devisscher. \\"Valckenborch, van.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 31 August 2020 Life Marten van Valckenborch was born in Leuven in what would become one of the most prominent Flemish families of artists.W. K. Z√ºlch, 'Die K√ºnstlerfamilie Van Valckenborch', Oud-Holland 49 (1932), pp. 221‚Äì228 Spanning three generations, 14 artists are recorded in the family of whom his younger brother Lucas the Elder and his own sons, Frederik van Valckenborch and Gillis van Valckenborch, were the most important personalities.Ulrike Schmidl, Lucas van Valckenborch in Wiener Sammlungen, Diplomarbeit Grad Magistra der Philosophie (Mag. phil.), Universitat Wien, November 2010 Portrait of a scholar, probably Carolus Clusius Marten joined the Guild of St Luke in Mechelen on 13 August 1559. On 3 December 1563 Gysbrecht Jaspers was recorded as his pupil. The early biographer Karel van Mander reported that Marten van Valckenborch learned to paint landscapes in Mechelen, which was known at the time as a center for oil and water-colours and especially landscape painting.Marten van Valckenborch in: Karel van Mander, Het Schilder-boeck, 1604 In 1564 Marten moved to Antwerp, where his brother Geraard van Valckenborch trained with him until 1568. Parable of the sower (month of September) At the start of the iconoclastic fury of the Beeldenstorm in 1566 he left town with his brother Lucas. The brothers made a trip from Li√®ge to Aachen along the Meuse (river), painting river valley views. In 1566 the artist was in Aachen, where he was joined in 1570 by his brother Lucas. In Aachen, the two brothers were also joined for two years by Hans Vredeman de Vries, friend and fellow artist. Hendrik van Steenwijk the Elder also resided in Aachen where he married Marten van Valckenborch's daughter.Martin Papenbrock, Landschaften des Exils: Gillis van Coninxloo und die Frankenthaler Maler, B√∂hlau Verlag K√∂ln Weimar, 2001, p. 46 Marten became a citizen of Aachen in 1573. Marten was recorded back in Antwerp in the years 1575-1576 and was referred to as an ouderman (elder) in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke in 1584. He left the Spanish Netherlands after the Fall of Antwerp in 1585. He was registered in Frankfurt from 1586 onwards.Marten van Valckenborch at the Netherlands Institute for Art History On 7 July 1586 Marten became a citizen of Frankfurt, together with his son-in-law Hendrik van Steenwijk the elder. At the beginning of 1593 his brother Lucas joined Marten in Frankfurt after a residence in Austria.Lucas van Valckenborch at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Marten and his brother operated in Frankfurt a large workshop, which his sons Gillis and Frederik joined. Marten died in 1612 in Frankfurt. Work Marten's subject matter was principally landscapes populated with religious or allegorical themes or depicting agricultural or mining scenes. He also produced some portraits and also collaborated as a staffage painter with the still life painter Georg Flegel. His work has been overshadowed by that of his brother Lucas the Elder, who achieved prominence as the court painter of Archduke Matthias of Austria, during the Archduke's term as governor of the Spanish Netherlands and afterwards. Interior with a couple and a vase of flowers and fruit on a table with Georg Flegel In his early works Marten showed a preference for landscapes of uniform terrain with shallow undulations, in which he always placed oak trees as an articulating element. He also often included large or numerous incidental figures, as he did in the 11 paintings representing allegories of the months (all in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). He later developed towards a more late Mannerist idiom. Landscapes in this late style are characterised by dramatically agitated clouds and large mountains. An example is The tower of Babel (1595, Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister). He thus represented the final iteration of the panoramic, so-called world landscape combining linear and aerial perspective as developed by Pieter Brueghel the Elder. His landscapes meticulously represent topographical details in a limited range of sober colours and are enlivened by the people placed in them.Marten van Valckenborch at de Jonckheere gallery River valley with iron mining scenes, 1611 He painted, like his brother Lucas, a number of mining scenes, which were probably based on his drawings of scenes along the Meuse river valley around present-day Huy in Belgium. There he had likely witnessed and sketched mining activities related to the iron industry. Some of his paintings of mining scenes such as River valley with iron mining scenes provide detailed depictions of the mining and smelting process of the late 16th and early 17th century.Marten van Valckenborch, A River Valley with Iron Mining Scenes at Sotheby's\\"Valckenborch‚Äôs Ironworks\\", Grohmann Museum, Milwaukee School of Engineering. Museum wall text. Marten van Valckenborch regularly returned to the subject of the Tower of Babel, which was also depicted by Pieter Bruegel the Elder and later by a whole range of Flemish artists. The subject of the Tower of Babel is usually interpreted as a critique of human hubris, and in particular o the Roman Catholic Church which at the time was undertaking at great expense large-scale construction projects such as the St. Peter's Basilica. However, it has also been viewed as a celebration of technical progress, which would herald a better and more organized world.Jonathan Sawday, 'Engines of the Imagination: Renaissance Culture and the Rise of the Machine', Routledge, 2007, p. 21 References External links * 1535 births 1612 deaths Flemish Renaissance painters Flemish history painters Flemish portrait painters People from Leuven ","title":"Marten van Valckenborch"},{"id":"31214243","text":"Preben Lundbye (born 1 April 1950) is a Danish football coach previously for Holstebro Boldklub and Silkeborg IF.

William Walker was a Colonial Engineer, a position of some prestige in the Victorian era in the United Kingdom, and hailed from Houghton le Spring,1881 England Census, Class: RG11; Piece: 669; Folio: 38; Page: 15; GSU roll: 1341155. County Durham. Although William had relatively humble origins, a long and successful career meant that Edward was born into an affluent family. William had served a seven-year apprenticeship at the engine works of the Thornley Colliery and afterwards worked at the locomotive works of the North Eastern Railway, Bank Top, Darlington. He then went on to the works of Messrs. Fossick & Hackworth, Stockton-on-Tees and in 1853 moved again, this time to the works of Messrs. Thomas Richardson Sons, Hartlepool. At this company he spent two of his three years as one of their leading hands, and went to sea as engineer in charge of the first three steamers built by the company. In 1856 while with the third steamer he accepted an engagement with the Borneo Company and then was appointed superintendent engineer to the Netherlands India (Java) Mail Company, with whom he remained ten years until the expiration of their mail contract in 1869 continuing afterwards with their successors for a while.Proceedings - Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Volume 47, Parts 3‚Äì4 (Institution of Mechanical Engineers (Great Britain)), 1894 - Technology & Engineering p166 In this time, he had married Anna, from Dundee in 1862. The eldest child within the family was an adopted daughter, Eliza Smith (born in 1859 in Java). During William's time in Java his family expanded. Ralph (born 1865), John H. (born 1867), Annie (also Nancy) born 1871, Catherine (born 1872) and William (born 1873) were all born there. The family returned to the United Kingdom, and Lissie M. was born in Bow, London in 1874 and the Edward was born in 1876 in Norwood. At this point, they were living in the well to do suburb of Dulwich on one of the most affluent roads, Alleyn Park Road. The house they lived in was named Kaliemas,1891 England Census, Class: RG12; Piece: 461; Folio 40; Page 13; GSU roll: 6095571, Census Returns of England and Wales, 1891.

Edward, despite living opposite Dulwich College was sent to Eastbourne to boarding school at Eastbourne College.1891 England Census, Class: RG12; Piece: 772; Folio 5; Page 4; GSU roll: 6095882., Census Returns of England and Wales, 1891. Kew, Surrey, England: The National Archives of the UK (TNA): Public Record Office (PRO), 1891. Edward's older brother was John H. Walker. Edward was referred to in a report on the 1903 tour to South Africa as the brother of \\"Johnny\\" Walker of Durban fame, which is likely a reference to John H. Walker who was caught up in the Boer War in South Africa. He was not a combatant, but gained notoriety due to his escape from the Boers after being captured. He had been surveying in Mapoch's country with the chief, under a strong guard and the chief's protection. However, he was eventually captured and taken to Middelburg. He and a fellow prisoner escaped with their horses, a dog, and a tin of biscuits on which they lived for a week, eventually making their way to the Swazi king, where they were treated well. They then walked to Delagoa Bay and caught the Union steamship SS Natal to Durban. Career In 1901, aged 25, he was living by his means and still in his mother's house. However, his father had died in 1894 and the family had left Alleyn Park Road in Dulwich and moved to the nearby Norwood.1901 England Census , Class: RG13; Piece: 438; Folio: 84; Page: 5., Census Returns of England and Wales, 1901. Kew, Surrey, England It is unclear if Edward did take up a profession, because in 1911 although he had moved to Clifton Gardens in Maida Vale, this was still the family home and he lived there with his mother and two of his sisters (as well as with a cook, parlormaid and housemaid) and stated that he was living by his own means. Rugby career Walker played for a side local to where he had grown up in Dulwich, called Lennox Football Club. The team were based in Dulwich when he started playing for them, though during his time with them they did move elsewhere. With this side he gained an excellent reputation in the South of England as a three-quarter. FOOTBALL. NOTES BY FULL BACK.

Biography Crocker was born in Jamesville, New York to Isaac and Elizabeth Crocker. He earned a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Institute in Troy, New York. He went on to read law in South Bend, Indiana. While there, he started a practice that earned him a reputation as an abolitionist. In April 1849, he visited California. In June 1850, Crocker lost a civil case brought by a slave owner for helping four slaves escaping from Kentucky. In July 1850, Crocker attended the Liberty Party convention in Syracuse, New York, where he retold the story of helping the slaves. In June 1851, he spoke at the Christian Anti-Slavery State convention in Indianapolis, Indiana. In August 1852, he was named a delegate from Indiana to the Free Soil Party convention. In 1852, he and his second wife moved to Sacramento, California. When they arrived in Sacramento, Crocker resumed his legal career. He was also involved in politics. On March 8, 1856, he chaired the state's first meeting of the Republican Party. In 1863, Governor Leland Stanford appointed Crocker as an Associate Justice of the California Supreme Court, which position he held from May 21, 1863, to January 2, 1864. In 1863, elections were held for all seats on the Supreme Court due to an 1862 amendment to California constitution and 1863 enabling law, and Crocker chose to step down rather than seek re- election. The next year, Crocker agreed to serve as legal counsel for the Central Pacific Railroad, a company run by the Big Four, which included Edwin's younger brother, Charles Crocker. Crocker served as the Central Pacific's attorney during the building of the First Transcontinental Railroad, culminating in the ceremony for the driving of the golden spike at Promontory, Utah, on May 10, 1869. Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento, CaliforniaThe stress of all of his work took a toll on Crocker. He suffered from a stroke in June 1869. He retired from his other pursuits and took up less stressful hobbies. With a net worth of a million dollars from railroad investments, Crocker and his family traveled throughout Europe and collected art. His family renovated their home to include an art gallery. Their home and the art that they had acquired would eventually become the Crocker Art Museum. Crocker GravesiteAfter his stroke, Crocker's health never fully recovered. On June 24, 1875, he died in Sacramento. He is interred in the Sacramento Historic City Cemetery in Sacramento, California. Personal life On September 3, 1845, Crocker married Mary Norton in Mishawaka, Indiana. She died on April 12, 1847, in South Bend, Indiana. They had a daughter, also named Mary. On July 8, 1852, he remarried to Margaret Rhodes in New York in a ceremony performed by Henry Ward Beecher. They had four daughters: Aim√©e Crocker, Jennie Louise Crocker Fassett, Nellie Margaret and Kate Eugenie Gunn, and two sons Edwin Clark, who died as a baby, and Elwood Bender, a relative who they adopted.

It was begun separately and without knowledge of the American PFLAG which performs the same functions in the United States. As of November 2014 PFLAG Canada has over 70 chapters and/or contacts in nine Canadian provinces. The board of directors is responsible for six regions across Canada, and includes a president, vice- president, secretary, and treasurer among others. History In Toronto in the 1970s, meetings of non-LGBT but welcoming family members were held under the banner of Parents Of Gays (POG). Changes were accelerated by Rev. Brent Hawkes of the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto, who brought Betty Fairchild, co-author of Now That You Know, to POG meetings. After POG was advertised in Chatelaine, Anne Rutledge of Mississauga contacted June Tattle (a friend of Fairchild and parent of a gay child), after which POG was amalgamated with Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (FFLAG), started by Pauline Martin and her son Russell in October 1981. The new organization was re-styled as Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, or Parents FLAG. After a number of media appearances by Rutledge and other members of Parents FLAG, other chapters were established throughout Canada in the 1980s and 1990s. Finally, in 2003, the movement was nationally consolidated as PFLAG Canada, renamed so as to distinguish the organization from the American NGO of the same name.

Brewer, Historic Resources Inventory, State of California -- The Resources Agency, Department of Parks and Recreation, April 3, 1984; copy accessed from City of Bakersfield Cultural Resources Survey Downtown Area, located in the Local History room of the Beale Memorial Library, Bakersfield, California. Significance The Standard Oil Company entered the substantial oil industry in Kern County in 1902 to develop its holdings in the Kern River Oil Field. With the construction of the Jastro Building, the company moved its Central California operations to Bakersfield. At the time it was built, the building was the first commercial building in the downtown commercial district built across the city's G Street. It is one of the finest examples of its type of architecture to survive the devastating 1952 Kern County earthquake relatively unscathed.

The guildhall is a Grade II listed building. History The guildhall takes its name from the ancient Guild of St Mary and St John the Baptist, whose hall stood from very early times on this site. It is not known when the first guildhall was erected but it is believed to have been around 1387, when King Richard II confirmed the incorporation of the Guild. Following the suppression of the chantries and religious guilds under King Edward VI in 1547, the property passed to the crown. The old prison for felons and debtors is at the rear of the building and has been in existence since 1553. From here have issued various convicts condemned to be publicly hanged at the gallows. The guildhall was rebuilt in 1707 and extended in 1741. Most of the present ground floor, and the smaller rooms at first and second floor level at the rear of the building date from the early 18th century. A century later the building was once more in a very poor state of repair and, in 1844 the Conduit Lands Trust agreed to provide ¬£2,500 and constructed the building. The hall and frontage was rebuilt between 1846 and 1848 by Joseph Potter Jnr. It is these works which created the gothic-style frontage to Bore Street and the panelled main hall on the first floor. This room is 87 ft long by 25 ft wide and, with its high pitched roof and hammer beams, has a fine medieval appearance. At the north end there is a large stone tracery stained-glass window by Betton & Evans of Shrewsbury. This was originally in the north transept of the Cathedral and was transferred to the guildhall in 1891. Below the window, on the outside, are busts of King George V and Queen Mary and a plaque commemorating their coronation. For much of the 20th century the guildhall was the meeting place for Lichfield City Council but it ceased to be the local seat of government after the formation of Lichfield District Council in 1974. Nevertheless, the building has continued to be the meeting place of the local parish council, which is now known as Lichfield City Council. Major refurbishment and repair works were completed in 2010 to restore this building, and to provide improved facilities for its use by the public. The main hall and various smaller rooms are hired out for public meetings, dances and as function rooms, and there is a programme of arts events and concerts run by the Lichfield District Arts Association. Civil marriages can take place at the guildhall. The guildhall is used for civic events including the ancient Court of Arraye and St George's Court. Public rooms include the main hall which accommodates 195 people, the smaller Guildroom which takes about 70 people and the Ashmole Room which has a capacity for 30 people. The Ashmole Room in the guildhall contains some important works of art including a portrait of the antiquary, Elias Ashmole, by an artist refereed to as J. Smith, a portrait of a Mrs Esther Day by James Millar and a portrait of a member of the Dyott family of Freeford Hall by an unknown artist. It also includes a prospect of Lichfield from the south-west by an unknown artist.

It defines the use of PDF as an exchange format optimized for variable and transactional printing. Built on top of PDF/X-4, it is the first variable-data printing (VDP) format which ensures modern International Color Consortium-based (ICC) color management through the use of ICC Output Intents. It adds the notion of encapsulated groups of graphic objects to support optimized efficient processing for repeating text, graphic or image content. Introducing the concept of document part metadata (DPM), it enables reliable and dynamic management of pages for High Volume Transactional Output (HVTO) print data, like record selection or postage optimization based on metadata. While PDF/VT-1 always consists of a self-contained file, other variants of the standard support the use of external graphic content (PDF/VT-2) as well as streaming through the use of multi-part MIME packages (PDF/VT-2s). In addition to being a digital master for VDP printing, it can be shared, viewed and interactively navigated by human operators using a normal PDF reader, though completely accurate rendering requires a PDF/X-4 or PDF/VT conforming viewer. A number of vendors announced their support for PDF/VT upon publication of the standard in 2010. Over the subsequent few years various other PDF/VT- consuming and -producing products also reached the market: * PDF/VT producer: The vendor PDFlib joined the ranks of producing vendors in April 2011 with PDFlib 8 VT Edition which is able to generate valid PDF/VT data. The vendor PrintSoft (now Objectif Lune) since late 2013 provides PReS 6.3.0 which is able to generate valid PDF/VT data. * PDF/VT validator: callassoftware has upgraded its Pre-flight (printing) application \\"pdfToolbox\\" version 5 with the option to check for PDF/VT conformity. * PDF/VT consumers: Adobe have upgraded their Raster image processor software Adobe PDF PrintEngine (APPE) to add support for efficient PDF/VT processing. APPE is embedded and built into many high speed printers made by different vendors. Global Graphics have supported PDF/VT in their Harlequin RIP since v8.2, which was launched at Ipex in April 2010 by Hewlett-Packard in the DFE driving the Indigo Digital Press. The ubiquity of PDF, as well as the fact that PDF itself now is an ISO standard (ISO 32000-1:2008) clearly work in favor of PDF/VT. Nevertheless, it is currently difficult to predict where in the industry PDF/VT will be adopted and how fast that will happen, and how it will be positioned vis-√†-vis other formats and architectures for variable data printing. The practical requirements and benefits of PDF/VT are explained in more detail, along with related recommendations, in a guide from Global Graphics.

He was born November 4, 1930, in Toledo, Ohio, and died by suicide in Philadelphia at age 36, on May 11, 1967. At the time of his death, Brewton was beginning to distinguish himself as one of Philadelphia's premier painters and printmakers. Training and career While in his teens, Brewton studied drawing at the Toledo Museum of Art and painting with John Charvet. At 21, Brewton joined the Marines and served in the Korean War. He did surprisingly well, climbing to the rank of sergeant. Combat changed him, however: He became a pacifist, protesting the Vietnam War and painting antiwar works. Brewton's health was wrecked, and he was increasingly plagued by debilitating spine problems. Although Brewton's style became expressionistic and inspired by graffiti, his training was traditional. Taking advantage of the G.I. Bill, he studied at the Ruskin School at Oxford in 1954-55 and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA) from 1955 through 1958. At PAFA, Brewton was a prot√©g√© of Franklin C. Watkins and Hobson Pittman. Pittman owned a self-portrait by Brewton, which he featured during tours of his art collection (like the one organized by the Radcliffe Club of Philadelphia in 1961)Evening Bulletin, March 29, 1961; photo caption, \\"Hobson Pittman with Brewton's self-portrait\\"; Philadelphia. and exhibited in the show, \\"Paintings, Drawings, Prints, and Sculpture Collected and Owned by Fourteen Philadelphia Artists.\\" Marcel Duchamp was a guest lecturer at PAFA, and Brewton riffed off of Duchamp's work throughout his life. At The Print Club, where Brewton worked on weekends, he first saw the work of Asger Jorn and was greatly impressed by the wildly expressive and colorful work of the CoBrA group. Brewton later befriended Jorn, living in Denmark for months at a time.Aarhuus Stiftstidende Sondag, July 15, 1963; \\"Broget kunstnerkoloni samlet i Funder\\"; DenmarkAndersen, Troels, Asger Jorn: En biografi (Kopenhagen 1994) 2 vols. Translated in German: Asger Jorn: Eine Biographie 1914-1973 (Walther K√∂nig: K√∂ln 2001) Other strong influences were Andr√© Breton and Alfred Jarry. These European, avant-garde inspirations were unusual for a Philadelphia-based artist in the 1950s. Brewton's work won awards and prizes,Wilmington Journal; April 28, 1959; \\"Month-Long Exhibition to Open Friday at Art Center; Paintings by Freeland, Jamison, Brewton Capture $100 Awards.\\"The Philadelphia Inquirer; June 15, 1958; \\"Travel Scholarships Given 17 Students at Academy of Fine Arts.\\" and he was championed by critics in Philadelphia and New York while still a student.The New York Times, November 29, 1959; Canaday, John: Review of American Biennial, (with photo of Brewton's \\"The Suicide of Judas\\").Art in Focus (U.S.-based) Vol. 11, No. 5, February 1960.

He and his then-partner, writer Barbara Holland, lived in Denmark during much of 1962. In early 1964, Brewton lent several works he owned to the Philadelphia Museum of Art's Asger Jorn exhibition.\\"Asger Jorn's Graphic Work,\\" Philadelphia Museum of Art, January 8-February 9, 1964 In the last years of his life, Brewton was represented by Harry Kulkowitz's Kenmore Galleries, on Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia. His prints were selling well, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art holds several in its permanent collection. From his colorful, CoBrA-inspired phase, Brewton had progressed to muted, wall-like pieces incorporating graffiti. By 1965, the works had evolved into a synthesis of graffiti (\\"anonymous and therefore for all mankind\\") The Philadelphia Inquirer; May 1971; Forman, Nessa: \\"Now That He's Dead ‚Äì Has His Time Come?\\" and Alfred Jarry's philosophy of 'Pataphysics. Brewton called these works \\"Graffiti Pataphysic\\" and also continued to paint portraits. By the time he died in 1967, Brewton had \\"had several one-man shows, and museum curators were beginning to exhibit interest,\\" as Nessa Forman wrote in The Philadelphia Inquirer. \\"There was an artist,\\" Forman continued, \\"who was ahead of his time, who was brilliant, sensitive and nonviolent, who loved his art and just wanted to paint. And he committed suicide‚Ä¶.\\"Ibid. Illness and death In pain and facing partial paralysis even if spine surgery were successful, Brewton shot himself at around 3 p.m. on May 11, 1967. Four days after his death, Brewton's work was shown at the Socrates Perakis gallery in Philadelphia, along with that of Jim McWilliams, Thomas Chimes and sculptor Paul Anthony Greenwood. \\"Artist's Suicide Gives Tragic Overtone to Exhibit,\\" ran the headline of Dorothy Grafly's review.Evening Bulletin; May 28, 1967; Grafly, Dorothy: \\"Artist's Suicide Gives Tragic Overtone to Exhibit\\"; Philadelphia.

The band was formed in 2002 by Robert Drakogiannakis. It broke up in 2005, but reunited in 2008. 2002-2005 Formed by guitarist Robert Drakogiannakis, the original trio include Alex Jezdinsky on drums and Jens Bachmann on bass guitar. All three members sang. They signed to Wuppertal Music Label Group and released a debut self-titled album that received some attention on the independent music scene but failed to draw wide attention. In 2003, they released the EP Ich bin kein Amerikaner (eng. \\"I Am not an American\\"). 2004 saw the release of a second album, Alltag f√ºr Alle (\\"routine for all\\"), and another EP, Phantome (\\"Phantoms\\"). In 2005, the band released the live album Pornographie. The band had one television appearance on Newcomer TV in 2005 before separating, with the members joining other projects. 2008 In 2008, Drakogiannakis resumed the band as a solo project, providing all instrumentation, with support live on bass from Dani \\"das Bassm√§dchen\\" Hilterhaus (eng. \\"the bass girl\\"). Initially, live drum support was offered by Martell Beigang, but after Beigang's departure drum support has been supplied by Mirco \\"Caddy\\" Cardeneo and Valentin Mayr. Drakogiannakis released new songs through the Angelika Express blog until late August 2008 and then began financing the planned album Goldener Trash by pre-selling shares to fans, a marketing idea that drew attention from the Heute show on ZDF. In 2009, an EP entitled Was wollt ihr alle? (\\"What do you all want?\\") was published, with an internet video supporting it. At the end of 2009, Hosen runter!

The song was written by bandleader Ric Ocasek. Lyrics and music The lyrics to \\"Gimme Some Slack\\" have a more concrete basis than many songs written by Ocasek. They are influenced by Ocasek's memories of the apartment building on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in which he lived in the early 1970s. Ocasek stated that \\"I remember people hanging clothes out on the roof and having all kinds of dirt in the hallway. So I'd think 'gimme some slack, gimme some rope, please.'\\" Jonathan Takiff of the Philadelphia Daily News points out that \\"Gimme Some Slack\\" and \\"Touch and Go\\" are examples of a \\"subtle, philosophical of first person survival\\" that represents an alternative side of the Cars from the \\"lost and frantic new age romantic\\" side exposed in songs like \\"Candy-O\\" and \\"Just What I Needed.\\" Stuart Mungalies of The News states that \\"Gimme Some Slack\\" sounds like a combination of the Rolling Stones and Devo. Jim Bohen of the Daily Record describes the music as starting with \\"revved up rhythm guitar\\" but then having a refrain on which it is difficult to find the groove. Cars keyboardist Greg Hawkes plays both organ and saxophone on \\"Gimme Some Slack.\\" Release and reception \\"Gimme Some Slack\\" was first released on Panorama, but in 1981, the song was released as the third single from said album. However, the song failed to chart in any countries, making it one of the band's least successful singles. The song has since appeared on the compilation album Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology. In his review of Panorama, AllMusic reviewer Greg Prato stated \\"'Gimme Some Slack' proved to be a fierce rocker.\\" Prato also said, in his review of Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology, that it was \\"previously released album tracks [on the album]\\" that were \\"highlights.\\" In the Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology liner notes, Brett Milano said, \\"Rockers like 'Getting Through' and 'Gimme Some Slack' had a heavier sound than before [Panorama].\\" Boston Globe critic Steve Morse called \\"Gimme Some Slack\\" a \\"true masterpiece.\\" Morse praises how the song \\"paints a seedily phantasmic portrait of a tenement building\\" with the lines \\"the seven floors of walkup/the odor musted cracks/the peeping keyhole intorverts/with the monkeys on their backs/the rooftops strung with frauleins/the pastel pinned up sails/the eighteen color roses/against your face so pale.\\" Morse suggests that the stream of consciousness style of the song was influenced by E.E. Cummings, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Richard Brautigan. B-side The B-side of the song, \\"Don't Go to Pieces\\", features Benjamin Orr on lead vocals. \\"Don't Go to Pieces\\" was first released as the B-side to \\"Don't Tell Me No\\", the single released before \\"Gimme Some Slack\\".

It was founded in 1974 by Rabbi Kalman Epstein and Rabbi Sholom Spitz. It has programs for high school boys, as well as undergraduate and graduate programs that result in Talmudic law degrees. History In 1974, Rabbi Kalman Epstein and Rabbi Sholom Spitz founded Yeshiva Shaar Hatorah-Grodno in Queens at the behest of Rabbi Spitz's teacher, Rabbi Mordechai Elefant. It is officially a branch of Yeshivas Itri in Jerusalem, which was started by Rabbi Elefant. The yeshiva was named \\"Shaar HaTorah\\" after the Grodno Yeshiva where Rabbi Epstein's great-grandfather, Rabbi Shimon Shkop, had been the rosh yeshiva. At the time, Rabbi Epstein gave the lecture shiur in Yiddish to undergraduate students, and Rabbi Spitz headed the graduate program. A year after the founding of the yeshiva, Rabbi Epstein's father, Rabbi Zelik Epstein, joined it. He was made the Rosh Hayeshiva, a post he held until his passing in 2009. Today, Rabbi Spitz gives the shiur to freshman and sophomore students, while Rabbi Kalman Epstein lectures to the junior, senior, and graduate students. Academics The curriculum focuses on Talmudic law, Aramaic texts, theology, philosophy, and epistemology. There is also a secular studies curriculum for high school students. In past years, the yeshiva spent the first month of the summer in Camp Ohr Shraga, a camp in Ellenville, NY that hosts several yeshivos for a month every summer. In recent years, the beis medrash post-high school program has stayed in Queens for that month, while the high school continues to go to Camp Ohr Shraga every summer. In Camp Ohr Shraga, the students continue studying, albeit not necessarily the same tractate of Gemara that they had been studying the rest of the year. They also engage in summer activities, including ball playing.

The game was released in November 2009, and has seen many map expansions released. The game is a strategy game that incorporates turn-based and real-time elements. It sees the player controlling several forts in a group of connected bases, choosing each round which base will create new forces that are used to attack enemy positions. The game's plot sees the player in the role of Alan, leader of the forces of the country Julius, as he follows orders to invade the country's neighbors unprovoked. The game was moderately well-received; reviewers enjoyed the gameplay, though it was noted as derivative, and had mixed opinions on plot, which was generally regarded as overly-dramatic.  Gameplay  Screenshot from the game, showing two players battling over bases. Players navigate their characters across a map attempting to take their opponent's bases. The map is set up as a grid of connected forts, with each player controlling a section of the map. The game is turn-based; each turn the player selects one of their bases to be their main base. At the end of each turn, the main base spawns troops. The amount of forces created depends on the number of held bases. The player then sends these troops either towards their own bases to reinforce them or towards enemy bases in order to capture them. Troops do not travel instantly, allowing circumstances to change at the target base before they arrive. Capturing bases is done by comparing the attacking troops' numbers with the defending, with larger numbers winning. Bases come in several varieties, and some bases, such as mines and castles, provide additional bonuses to the side that holds them, such as increased movement speed or attack power. Other bases, such as ports, form choke points on the map by allowing travel on other terrain such as over water. When a base is captured, it has a chance to give the capturing side an item, which may be consumed later to grant a bonus, such as increased speed or defense, to all the units of that side. The match ends when one player controls the entire map. Each match takes around ten to twenty minutes to complete. Some battles feature more than one enemy player. In addition to the campaign mode, which is ten missions long, there is a free-play mode where the player can fight enemies on the map of their choosing.  Plot  Players control Alan, leader of the forces of the country Julius. When the story begins, Alan is reluctantly following the orders of his king to attack the neighboring country Herbert, which had previously been peaceful with Julius. Over the course of the game, a series of plots and betrays result in Julius fighting against the countries of Frost and Sandia as well. By the end, the war has caused so much devastation that \\"only hills and rivers remain\\".  Development  In early 2009, the IPhone version of the game was shown at the Tokyo Game Show. The game was released by Square Enix on November 26, 2009. A demo version, Hills and Rivers Remain Lite, was also released for free, and contains elements not present in the full game. In Japan, the game was also released as a DSiWare game on October 28, 2009, as well as a cell phone game.  Reception  Levi Buchanan of IGN rated the game a 7.5 or \\"Good\\", praising its depth and complexity and cautioning players about its great difficulty. He praised the simple and precise controls, though he noted that the graphics and presentation were simple and minimal. Andrew Podolsky of Slide to Play, giving it a three out of four, also praised the gameplay, though he noted that the matches tended to start slowly and that the gameplay was derivative of other real-time strategy games, especially Galcon. He said that he enjoyed the \\"tearful, overwrought storyline\\". Peter Lettieri of Touch Arcade also noted the similarities to Galcon, though he called the plot \\"loaded to the brim with clich√©s, uninspired characters, and banter that will likely make one wince\\" and awarded the game three out of five points. Tracy Erickson of Pocket Gamer was less positive towards the game; while he found the game briefly entertaining, they felt that the gameplay lacked depth and did not stand up to repeated play. They additionally disliked the lack of multiplayer, and found the story \\"thin\\" and \\"wince-worthy\\". Bonnie Eisenman of 148Apps also found the game briefly entertaining; she found the game to be too short, and the battles to be both simple and lengthy, and marred by poor controls. She also found the graphics to be serviceable, but not impressive.

The Security Council resolution was proposed by France, Lebanon, and the United Kingdom. Ten Security Council members voted in the affirmative (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, Gabon, Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal, South Africa, and permanent members France, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Five (Brazil, Germany, and India, and permanent members China and Russia) abstained, with none opposed. The resolution formed the legal basis for military intervention in the Libyan Civil War, demanding \\"an immediate ceasefire\\" and authorizing the international community to establish a no-fly zone and to use all means necessary short of foreign occupation to protect civilians. Resolution =Key points= The resolution, adopted under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter: * demands the immediate establishment of a ceasefire and a complete end to violence and all attacks against, and abuses of, civilians; * imposes a no-fly zone over Libya; * authorizes all necessary means to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas, except for a \\"foreign occupation force\\"; * strengthens the arms embargo and particularly action against mercenaries, by allowing for forcible inspections of ships and planes; * imposes a ban on all Libyan-designated flights; * imposes an asset freeze on assets owned by the Libyan authorities, and reaffirms that such assets should be used for the benefit of the Libyan people; * extends the travel ban and assets freeze of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970 to a number of additional individuals and Libyan entities; * establishes a panel of experts to monitor and promote sanctions implementation. =Arming anti- Gaddafi forces= The arms embargo imposed by paragraph 9 of resolution 1970 would have prevented arms being supplied to anyone in Libya. However, the resolution modified resolution 1970 with the wording \\"all necessary measures, notwithstanding paragraph 9 of resolution 1970\\" if doing so would protect civilians. Hillary Clinton argued that, though arming anti-Gaddafi forces was not being proposed at the time, it would be legal to do so.Obama not ruling out arming Libya rebels Voting {class=wikitable - !width=33%Approved (10) !!width=33% Abstained (5) !!width=33% Opposed (0) - valign=top  ''''''  '''''' *''''''  '''''' ''''''  } * Permanent members of the Security Council are in bold. Permanent members China and Russia had reservations about the no-fly zone, including the practicalities of enforcing such a zone and concerns about the use of force when other means had not been exhausted, but had noted requests by the Arab League and the \\"special situation\\" in Libya and therefore abstained. African members of the Security Council condemned the actions of the Libyan regime and supported the text. The following day, Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Germany would not take part in the military operation, but added: \\"We unreservedly share the aims of this resolution. Our abstention should not be confused with neutrality.\\"BBC (retrieved 18 March 2011) However, her foreign minister Guido Westerwelle had publicly stated his opposition to the resolution. India abstained because it perceived the resolution as being based on uncertain information (lack of \\"credible information on the situation on the ground in Libya\\") and as being too open-ended (lacking \\"clarity about details of enforcement measures, including who and with what assets will participate and how these measures will be exactly carried out\\"). Brazil too abstained noting the fundamental contradiction in using force to achieve an \\"immediate end to violence and the protection of civilians\\". They believed that the use of force \\"may have the unintended effect of exacerbating tensions on the ground and causing more harm than good to the very same civilians we are committed to protecting\\". The Brazilian Ambassador Mrs. Viotti further observed that \\"...an important aspect of the popular movement in North Africa and the Middle East is their spontaneous, homegrown nature. We are also concerned about the possibility that the use of military force, as called for in paragraph 4 of today's resolution, could change that narrative in ways that may have serious repercussions for the situation in Libya and beyond.\\" Libyan response On 18 March, Muammar Gaddafi's government announced that they would comply with the resolution and implement a ceasefire. However, it quickly became clear that no ceasefire had in fact been implemented. Libyan opposition forces in Benghazi cheered and fired guns and fireworks into the air as the resolution was adopted. A few hours before issuing the resolution, Gaddafi warned the opposition with a speech saying, \\"We are coming tonight, and there will be no mercy\\". Implementation US Air Force Lockheed EC-130J aircraft broadcasts a naval blockade warning message to Libyan ports during Operation Odyssey Dawn on 20 March 2011. Military intervention in Libya began on 19 March, as fighter jets of the French Air Force destroyed several pro-Gaddafi vehicles advancing on rebel stronghold Benghazi. U.S. and British submarines then fired over 110 Tomahawk cruise missiles at targets throughout Libya, severely disabling the regime's air defense capability and allowing a wider enforcement of the no-fly zone to begin. A coalition of 10 states from Europe and the Middle East initially participated in the intervention, later expanding to 17. On 31 March, NATO assumed command of the operation. The intervention succeeded in preventing pro-Gaddafi forces from capturing Benghazi.

CBR250R  The CBR250R was made from 2011 to 2013 for all Honda markets except Japan and Malaysia, where production continued after 2013. Originally intended primarily for the Thai and Indian markets, the 250R was sold worldwide, including in developed countries in Europe, North America and elsewhere. There was no CBR250R 2014 model in any markets except Japan and Malaysia, but in late 2014 for the 2015 model year, Honda added a larger displacement versions to succeed the CBR250R to keep pace with competitors, the CBR300R sport bike, and CB300F standard bike in all markets except Japan, India and Malaysia where only the CBR250R is sold. =Regional markets= In developing countries where typical motorcycles are displacement, the larger CBR250R is at the higher end of the sport bike range, looking similar to much more powerful sporting machines with its full fairing in Honda's new layered style that was introduced on the 2008 CBR1000RR Fireblade and 2010 VFR1200F.Large displacement sport bikes of and above, like the Yamaha YZF-R1 and Suzuki Hayabusa, were introduced in India and other developing countries in minuscule numbers, around 2008, aimed only at very wealthy buyers. See and In wealthier industrialized countries, the CBR250R enters at the opposite end of the market, as a budget priced beginner or utility bike, practical and fuel efficient, but with limited sporting pretensions. In the US, the new CBR250R is the first major competition the Kawasaki Ninja 250R has faced since the early 1990s. The CBR250R has optional mechanical combined anti-lock brakes, which is unusual at its price. =Design= The CBR250R closely follows the style of the VFR1200F, notable for its Y-shaped headlight and prominent middle cowl, which creates a layered look. This new direction in Honda design debuted at Intermot in 2008 with the V4 Concept Model, and the 2008 CBR1000RR Fireblade. The V4 Concept Model at Intermot 2008 Motorcycle Consumer News design columnist Glynn Kerr observed that new direction in bike design fits the pattern of motorcycle trends imitating, but lagging behind, car styling, in that motorcycles are shifting away from sharp, \\"lithe\\", dart-like shapes of the 2010s toward a heavier, \\"chunky\\" style with a higher, blunter nose, and, in cars, a \\"high waisted\\" middle with short windows and thicker pillars. Kerr cites the Chrysler 300 as the best example, as well as smaller cars like the Audi A3 and Suzuki Swift, commenting that, \\"aggression now comes from appearing strong and assertive, rather than light and dart-like... the arrow has been replaced by the hammer.\\" In motorcycles this translates into a heavy front, reverse rake angle headlight, and the use of little or no color on the rear half of the bike to spotlight the front one-fourth of the bike. In this aspect, Kerr also sees influence from the 1994 Morbidelli V8, the 1991 Yamaha TDM850, and Honda's DN-01 of 2005. On the 2008 CBR1000RR, Kerr thought the dominant vertical line produced an awkward, top heavy look that played against traditional race replica styling of body lines sloping downwards towards the front. The 2010 VFR1200F was visually more successful because the new style better suited the greater proportions of a touring motorcycle, and in spite of Honda's third iteration of the style being a much smaller bike, nonetheless Kerr said, \\"the latest CBR250R carries the look even better than its big brother.\\" The Ottawa Citizens review by David Booth said the CBR250R looked better than the VFR1200F as well, commenting that, \\"Where the various bulges of the big VFR are a little too Jessica Rabbit-like over-the-top, the little CBR250R styling is far more subtle and really looks the classier of the two.\\" =Critical reception= Reviews of the CBR250R generally rate its performance in comparison to its main competitor, which in the US and Canada is the Kawasaki Ninja 250R. The Hyosung GT250, rebadged as the ATK GT250 for 2011, is also a potential competitor in those markets, although it fares poorly in comparison. In India, the Ninja 250R and Hero Honda Karizma R are the leading competition. Though lower in peak power and with a slower top speed than the Ninja 250, the CBR was lauded for having more torque available at lower engine speeds, meaning that it was easier to accelerate from low speed and pulling away required less noise and drama, since the Ninja had to be revved to 9,000 rpm and above to make use of its greater power. This made the CBR250R more pleasant and forgiving to ride than the sportier, but more challenging, Ninja. Complaints from The Economic Times of Mumbai included a tendency to stand up if the rider makes a sloppy mid-corner correction, and brakes and suspension not up to the standards of a track bike. The Indian reviewer also perceived the wet weight as \\"not so light\\", while American journalists considered it a featherweight, \\"incredibly agile, flickable ... almost too light,\\" at lighter than the Ninja 250R. The Ninja 250R's brakes had a better, more linear feel with stronger initial bite and could stop from in , while the CBR250R, with a stopping distance of , was lauded for its combined anti-lock brake option, a boon to beginners in spite of the slightly shorter braking distance achievable on the Ninja 250R by a skilled sport rider. Kevin Ash, at , found the dimensions comfortable for someone of his height, while David Booth cautioned it could be cramped for taller riders. In one head to head comparison, MotorcycleUSA judged the Ninja 250R to be the better bike due to its superior speed and handling. The testers at Motorcycle Consumer News found the CBR250R to be the better choice, given the needs of its presumed prospective buyers in the US, beginners and those looking for a practical motorcycle for long commutes, though \\"if sheer performance is all you're after\\" without regard for fuel efficiency, then the Ninja 250R might be preferable. =Production= The production model was unveiled in the Thailand International Motor Expo 2010 on November 27, 2010,CBR250R Exhibited at Thailand International Motor Expo 2010 Hong Kong's Central District on November 28, 2010,CBR250R Exhibited at Hong Kong Motorcycle Show and EICMA 2010CBR250R Displayed at EICMA 2010 Global models of the CBR250R were produced by Thai Honda Manufacturing in Thailand, with sales beginning in November 2010, followed by spring 2011 in Japan.Honda to Produce New Road Sports Model CBR250R in Asia ~ A strategic global model for export from Thailand and India ~ Indian and South America models were produced by Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) in India beginning in the spring of 2011.  CBR300R  In October 2013 the longer-stroke CBR300R was announced at the China International Motorcycle Trade Exhibition in Chongqing, with engine displacement increased from in response to Kawasaki's Ninja 300. Honda said the new model has increased horsepower, from , and greater torque, from . An optional ABS upgrade is available for these models. The new CBR300R differs from the previous CBR250R in a number of ways. The fairing and headlight are restyled to more resemble the CBR RR line - a departure from the CBR250R resemblance to the VFR1200F. Further external changes include a new exhaust system and revised motor mounts, a new seat and side panels that aid in an easier reach to the ground and a slightly more sporty riding position. Internal changes include new piston, connecting rod and crankshaft along with increase in displacement and taller gearing for better cruising. Tires and suspension remain same as CBR250R. = Performance = The Honda CBR300R is capable of acceleration from 0‚Äì60 in 7.80 seconds. It has a braking distance of 138.9 feet from 60 to 0 mph. Honda CBR300R CB300F In 2015, a naked variant of the Honda CBR300R was launched. In this variant is available with 2 color choices colour red and white. = Design = The CB300F is a slightly lighter ( wet) model with a more upright sitting position. Other than that, most of its specifications are nearly the same as the CBR300R.

He is known for Lyndon words, the Curtis‚ÄìHedlund‚ÄìLyndon theorem, Craig‚ÄìLyndon interpolation and the Lyndon‚ÄìHochschild‚ÄìSerre spectral sequence. Biography Lyndon was born on December 18, 1917 in Calais, Maine, the son of a Unitarian minister. His mother died when he was two years old, after which he and his father moved several times to towns in Massachusetts and New York. He did his undergraduate studies at Harvard University, originally intending to study literature but eventually settling on mathematics, and graduated in 1939. He took a job as a banker, but soon afterwards returned to graduate school at Harvard, earning a master's degree in 1941. After a brief teaching stint at the Georgia Institute of Technology, he returned to Harvard for the third time in 1942 and while there taught navigation as part of the V-12 Navy College Training Program while earning his Ph.D. He received his doctorate in 1946 under the supervision of Saunders Mac Lane.. After graduating from Harvard, Lyndon worked at the Office of Naval Research and then for five years as an instructor and assistant professor at Princeton University before moving to the University of Michigan in 1953. At Michigan, he shared an office with Donald G. Higman;. his notable doctoral students there included Kenneth Appel and Joseph Kruskal. Lyndon died on June 8, 1988, in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Research Lyndon's Ph.D. thesis concerned group cohomology; the Lyndon‚ÄìHochschild‚ÄìSerre spectral sequence, coming out of that work, relates a group's cohomology to the cohomologies of its normal subgroups and their quotient groups. A Lyndon word is a nonempty string of symbols that is smaller, lexicographically, than any of its cyclic rotations; Lyndon introduced these words in 1954 while studying the bases of free groups.. Lyndon was credited by Gustav A. Hedlund for his role in the discovery of the Curtis‚ÄìHedlund‚ÄìLyndon theorem, a mathematical characterization of cellular automata in terms of continuous equivariant functions on shift spaces.. The Craig‚ÄìLyndon interpolation theorem in formal logic states that every logical implication can be factored into the composition of two implications, such that each nonlogical symbol in the middle formula of the composition is also used in both of the other two formulas. A version of the theorem was proved by William Craig in 1957, and strengthened by Lyndon in 1959.. In addition to these results, Lyndon made important contributions to combinatorial group theory, the study of groups in terms of their presentations in terms of sequences of generating elements that combine to form the group identity. Awards and honors The book Contributions to Group Theory (American Mathematical Society, 1984, ) is a festschrift dedicated to Lyndon on the occasion of his 65th birthday; it includes five articles about Lyndon and his mathematical research, as well as 27 invited and refereed research articles. The Roger Lyndon Collegiate Professorship of Mathematics at the University of Michigan, held by Hyman Bass in 1999‚Äì2008, is named after Lyndon.

It is being studied as a radiation protection agent. Chemically, it is the sodium salt of 4-carboxystyryl-4-chlorobenzylsulfone. Clinical trials The results of two Phase I clinical studies in healthy human volunteers indicate that subcutaneously injected Ex-Rad is safe and well tolerated, with \\"no evidence of systemic side effects\\". A study in mice demonstrated the efficacy of Ex-Rad by increasing the survival rate of mice exposed to typically lethal whole-body irradiation. The study tested oral and parenteral administration of Ex-Rad for both pre- and post-exposure radiomitigation. Research on Ex-Rad has involved collaboration with the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI), the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular & Cellular Biology at Georgetown University, Long Island University's Arnold & Marie Schwartz College of Pharmacy, and the Department of Oncological Sciences at the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine. Mechanism of action Onconova reports that Ex-Rad protects cells exposed to radiation against DNA damage, and that the drug's mechanism of action does not involve scavenging free radicals or arresting the cell cycle. Instead, they claim it employs a \\"novel mechanism\\" involving \\"intracellular signaling, damage sensing, and DNA repair pathways\\". Ex-RAD is a chlorobenzylsulfone derivative that works after free radicals have damaged DNA.

Possible identification with Pabtamer It is possible but by no means certain that Pebatjma is identical to a royal woman named Pabtamer (Pa-abt-ta-mer). A stela from Abydos belonging to a general named Paqattereru (Pekatror) records how this general was called upon by Osiris for the burial of his mother Pabtamer who had the beautiful name Meres- Nip (\\"beloved of Napata\\" or \\"She who loves Napata\\"). She holds the titles Chantress of Amun, King's Sister, King's daughter, and Mother of the Adorer of the God. It has been suggested that Pa-abt-ta-mer is an Egyptianization of the name Pebatjma. The problem with the identification is that Pa-abt-ta-mer holds slightly different titles than those recorded for Pebatjma on other monuments. Furthermore, the title of King's daughter is slightly problematic as there is no known king who could be her father. Paqattereru is not a King's son, and these facts may point to Pa-abt-ta-mer being an otherwise unknown wife of either Piye or Taharqa, and the mother of either Shepenupet II or Amenirdis II.

They are characterized by a uniserial radula with tricuspid teeth. Lateral cusps are thickest along the lateral edge, broader and generally longer than the central cusps. The protoconch is large or small, papilliform and often tilted on its vertical axis. Shells are fusiform and show numerous irregular columellar plaits. Distribution Most of the species thrive in the benthic zone between 100 and 300 m on mud and shell grit substrate. Rare bathyal species are brought up from 800 to 1000 m. The distribution of the Fulgorariinae extends along the East coast of Asia, from throughout Japan except the Okhotsk Sea, the Pacific coast, the Japan Sea, the East China Sea and the South China Sea down to the coast of Vietnam. Fossil History Some fulgorariid fossils can be traced back to the Oligocene, but possible ancestors of recent species only appeared during the Pliocene only with an abrupt increase after the Late Pliocene, in which almost all the recent species were established.Yokohama, M.

He was the brother of the architect George Alfred Hall and father of Edwin Stanley Hall, also a noted architect. Biography Born in 1851, the son of architect George Hall, he started independent practice in London in 1876, and is best known for his work designing hospitals. He won the 1894 competition for the design of Hither Green Infectious Diseases Hospital and then a 1908 competition to design the new Manchester Royal Infirmary. The architect John Brooke was cited as \\"joint architect\\" with E T Hall in the design of the Manchester Royal Infirmary opened on 6 July 1909. He also designed two hospitals in Leeds, the Homoeopathic Hospital in Queen Square, London and several hospitals in Sussex as well as the St Giles Hospital in Peckham and the Camberwell Infirmary (both in London). His large architectural practice also designed a number of factories, offices, churches, houses and flats. Amongst these are Sloane Mansions in Sloane Square and St Ermin's Mansions in 1889 (which later became St Ermin's Hotel in 1899) in Westminster. Liberty's Exterior of Liberty's store Hall's most noted work, which he undertook with his son, was the design of the Regent Street department store Liberty & Co., which is now a Grade II* listed building. Although the landowner, the Crown Estate, required all buildings on Regent Street to be in a classical style, Hall constructed the famous black and white timber Elizabethan-style frontage of Liberty's that faces on to Great Marlborough Street. Completed after his death in 1924, its mock Tudor style was designed around the ideas of the store's owner, Arthur Liberty. The timber for the outside fa√ßade was taken from old wooden sailing ships: HMS Impregnable and HMS Hindustan. The frontage on Great Marlborough Street is the same length as the Hindustan. Three light wells form the main internal focus of the building. Each of these wells was surrounded by smaller rooms to create a homely feel. Many of the rooms had fireplaces and some still exist. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner was very critical of the building's architecture, saying: \\"The scale is wrong, the symmetry is wrong. The proximity to a classical fa√ßade put up by the same firm at the same time is wrong, and the goings-on of a store behind such a fa√ßade (and below those twisted Tudor chimneys) are wrongest of all\\". RIBA He was a vice-president of the Royal Institute of British Architects and was an active participant in drawing up the Institute‚Äôs charter in 1887. He was known as \\"Bye law Hall\\" not only because of his incisive legal mind but for the major part he played in drafting the updating of the London Building Acts in the 1890s. The Dulwich Estate Hall was a governor of The Dulwich Estate for 22 years and its chairman from 1908 to 1910. In addition to the Old Library, other local projects included Camberwell Public Library and Council Offices, and the completion of the British Home for Incurables in Streatham. Hall also provided the initial concept for the Sunray Gardens Estate. The advanced concept advocated a garden city layout with innovative integral community facilities.

Peter Sellers was on the film for only one week. McGrath said Sellers \\"insisted on coming and guesting in it\\" and played the role of Queen Victoria on his knees, wearing roller-skates. The film was produced by British pornography producer David Grant, who forced McGrath to put in some nude scenes and used the film as a tax write-off. McGrath also dubbed midget Charlie Atom's lines when he was unavailable for the dubbing of the film. The Great McGonagall was the seventh in a string of flops for Sellers, whose career improved with his next film The Return of the Pink Panther (1975). Critical reception In The New York Times, Richard Eder wrote \\"The Great McGonagall, which opened yesterday at the Cinema Village, is endearing, and parts of it are lovely and hilarious. But it lacks enough of an organizing principle in its chaos to succeed as a movie...The pace is frenetic, the level of reality shifts every two minutes, it is stuffed with visual absurdities, old jokes and take-offs. Some work, some exasperate...McGonagall dies, and you are sorry. Despite his madness, his delusions, his bad poems, you miss him. He is a radiant failure. So, in a way, is his movie, with all bad jokes, carelessness and confusion.\\" Books A related book, The Great McGonagall Scrapbook by Spike Milligan and Jack Hobbs, was published by M & J Hobbs in 1975.

Born in The Hague, van Burg began his career as a singer and conferencier in Paris cabarets. He first appeared as a TV entertainer on the Austrian ORF broadcaster in 1958 and shortly afterwards also on German ARD. When the second German television broadcaster ZDF had launched in 1963, van Burg in the following year became the host of Der goldene Schuss, a game show that quickly reached an immense popularity. Referring to Schiller's Wilhelm Tell, in an early example of an interactive game the contestants, supported by viewers via telephone, had to true up the bolt of a crossbow trying to hit the bullseye on a displayed target. The ritual, accompanied by van Burg's catchphrases (\\"Wunnebar\\"), became a TV classic. On 25 August 1966 the show was even broadcast from the Monte Carlo Casino starring Grace Kelly and in 1967 it was adopted by the British ITV network (The Golden Shot). In the same year however, van Burg had to hand off the show after the yellow press had spread rumours about his private life. In the following years he again worked as a conferencier until he was able to return on the TV screen in 1976, again hosting several game shows on ZDF.

Commercial floating surface algae scrubber uses red LED lights and up-flowing air bubbles to cause algae to grow in the growth compartment. Inside of the compartment is lined with rough textures which enhance algal attachment; ribbons/strings allow further algal attachment. Periodic removal of the algae that has grown inside of an algae scrubber removes nutrients (ammonia, nitrate, phosphate) from the aquarium water, thus providing the needed filtration. An algae scrubber is a water filtering device (not to be confused with a scrubber pad used to clean glass) which uses light to grow algae; in this process, undesirable chemicals are removed from the water.Nutrient Cycling In The Great Barrier Reef Aquarium. Proceedings of the 6th International Coral Reef Symposium, Australia, 1988, Vol. 2 Algae scrubbers allow saltwater, freshwater and pond hobbyists to operate their tanks using natural filtration in the form of primary production, much like oceans and lakes.  Concepts  An algae scrubber filters water by moving water rapidly over a rough, highly illuminated surface, which causes algae to start growing in large amounts. As the algae grow, they consume nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate, nitrite, ammonia, ammonium and even metals such as copper from the water.Algal Response To Nutrient Enrichment In Forested Oligotrophic Stream. Journal of Phycology, June 2008 These nutrients are normally a problem in aquariums and ponds because they cause nuisance algae to grow, and also because they cause sickness and/or other problems in aquarium fish, invertebrates and corals.Fish Disease: Diagnosis and Treatment, Second Edition, 2010 An algae scrubber allows algae to grow, but the algae grow inside the filter instead of in the aquarium or pond. This removes excess nutrients (scrubs the water), diminishing nuisance algae in the aquarium or pond . Nuisance algae in the aquarium or pond are not to be confused with the desired algae in the algae scrubber filter itself. The algae that grow in the algae scrubber can then be removed, or fed back to the livestock. Both iron fertilization and ocean nourishment are techniques that boost the primary production of algae in the ocean, which consumes massive amounts of nutrients and CO2. It is this same consumption of nutrients that algae perform in an aquarium or pond. Algae scrubbers are used in both saltwater and freshwater, and remove nuisance algae of multiple types: cyano or slime, bubble, hair, Chaetomorpha, Caulerpa, and film algae, as well as dinoflagellates and Aiptasia.  History  Dr. Walter Adey The algae scrubber was invented by Dr. Walter Adey, who beginning in the late 1970s, was Director of the Marine Systems Laboratory at the Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution (Washington DC, USA).Smithsonian Institution, Dept. of Botany His research of various types of algae, especially in their ecological role on coral reefs, gave him insight into how the ocean (in particular a reef) \\"recycles\\" nutrients. He designed and built various exhibits ranging in size up to 3000 gallons, and modeled different aquatic ecological systems including a tropical coral reef/lagoon which \\"after 8 years of closure [to the environment], had its chemical parameters controlled solely by an algal turf scrubber. This system, studied by a multidisciplinary team of biologists, demonstrated calcification [coral growth] rates equal to the best 4 percent of wild reefs, and at 543 identified species, and an estimated 800 species, ranked per unit area as the most biodiverse reef ever measured.\\"https://ocean.si.edu/ecosystems/coral-reefs/evolution-reef-aquarium In three editions of his book, Dynamic Aquaria, Dr Adey described his work in detail and discussed in scientific principles the physical, chemical, and biological considerations for building a functioning ecological system within an enclosure, from aquarium size, to microcosm (up to 5000 gallons), or mesocosm size (>5000 gallons). In describing the algal turf scrubber he designed, he explained that removing excess nutrients was not its only function. By operating the scrubber at night when the main tank had shifted to a different respiratory phase (plants were now absorbing oxygen rather than producing it) the scrubber maintained oxygen levels and helped buffer pH by preventing high levels of carbon dioxide from building up. Upflowing scrubber \\"Recycling\\" means how the nutrients go from plants to animals, and back to plants again. On land, you see recycling by following the oxygen flow: Green plants use carbon dioxide and release oxygen; animals use this oxygen and release carbon dioxide. In oceans and lakes, the nutrients go from algae to animals, and back to the algae again. Aquatic nutrient cycle Dr. Adey built several versions of algae scrubbers for aquariums at the Smithsonian. He called them \\"Algal Turf Scrubbers\\", because at the time it was believed that \\"turf\\" algae was the best type of algae to grow in a scrubber. He also was granted the first U.S. patent for a dumping-bucket algae scrubber,U.S. Patent 4333263, Issue Date June 8, 1982 which described a complex dumping device that poured water onto a horizontal surface, thus simulating waves in a reef environment. After several years of development, he participated in a test of a large algae scrubber on the Great Barrier Reef Aquarium: \\"The Reef Tank represents the first application of algal scrubber technology to large volume aquarium systems. Aquaria using conventional water purification methods (e.g. bacterial filters) generally have nutrient levels in parts per million, while algal scrubbers have maintained parts per billion concentrations [much lower], despite heavy biological loading in the Reef Tank. The success of the algal scrubbers in maintaining suitable water quality for a coral reef was demonstrated in the observed spawning of scleractinian corals and many other tank inhabitants.\\" Unfortunately, it was not known at the time (1988) that calcium and alkalinity needed to be added to an enclosed reef tank, in order to replace that which is utilized by the growing calcifying organisms. Even five years after that, the Pittsburgh Zoo was just starting to test a \\"mesocosm\\" scrubber reef tank to see if calcium levels would drop: \\"It was hypothesized that Ca2+ and the substitutive elements Sr2+ and Mg2+ might have reduced concentrations in a coral reef microcosm due to continuous reuse of the same seawater as a consequence of the recycling process inherent in the coral reef mesocosm.\\" [...] \\"The scleractinians (Montastrea, Madracis, Porites, Diploria, and Acropora) and calcareous alga (Halimeda and others) present in the coral reef mesocosm are the most likely organisms responsible for the significant reduction in concentration of the Ca2+ and Sr2+ cations.\\" [...] \\"Ca is not normally a biolimiting element, and strontium is never a biolimiting element; HCO3 [alkalinity] can be. It appears that, because of a minor limitation in the design parameters of the mesocosm, these elements and compounds may have become limiting factors. [...] It is surprising that the organisms could deplete the thousands of gallons of seawater (three to six thousand) of these elements even within two or more years.\\"An Introduction to the Biogeochemical Cycling of Calcium and Substitutive Strontium in Living Coral Reef Mesocosms http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/zoo.1430120505/abstract After other researchers added calcium and/or connected their tanks to the ocean (which also supplies calcium and alkalinity), corals began growing again. Nevertheless, \\"problem\\" nutrients (ammonia, ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, CO2, metals) were always kept at very low numbers. Dr. Adey licensed his patent to very few individuals, who for a short number of years sold a limited number of aquarium scrubbers to hobbyists. The complexity of the design, however, and the cost of the license, caused the scrubber units to be very expensive. This, combined with the fact that the units were noisy, splashy, and unreliable (the dumping mechanism would get stuck) caused the sales to be slow. The scrubbers were just starting to make headway into the aquarium hobby in the 1990s when Adey decided to withdraw his license and no longer allow anybody to make or sell them. He turned his attention instead to commercial and industrial applications, and entered private business making large scale scrubber installations for lakes and rivers.Hydromentia Water Treatment Technologies As the internet developed in the 1990s, aquarium and pond hobbyists began discussing nuisance algae problems, and started noticing a trend: Aquariums and ponds with very high amounts of nuisance algae had no detectable nutrients in the water. This at first seemed odd, since the amount of nuisance algae should increase as the nutrients in the water increased. How could there be a very large amount of nuisance algae, but no measurable nutrients in the water to support this? Biologists then began pointing out that when the amount of nuisance algae became large enough, the algae actually consumed all the available nutrients from the water faster than new nutrients were added. Dr. Adey's principles were at work again. Interest in using algae for nutrient control once again increased, this time in the form of keeping the algae in a \\"sump\\" or other small aquarium which was connected to the main aquarium via plumbing. With added lighting and flow, algae would grow in this area, and the algae would consume nutrients from the water just as Dr. Adey's algae scrubber units did. Sumps or other small aquariums used for this purpose became known as \\"refugiums\\".Reef Invertebrates, 2003, page 46 The name \\"refugium\\" was used because the growing algae provided a safe place for small and microscopic animals to breed and grow, and thus was a \\"refuge\\" from the large fish and invertebrates in the main aquarium that would otherwise consume them. However while the refugiums did indeed consume nutrients from the water, they did not consume them fast enough in all situations; this caused many hobbyists to continue to have nuisance algae problems in their main aquariums.  Modern forms  Original vertical scrubber design More recent variations are built with a simple \\"waterfall\\" driven by gravity, using a simple PVC plumbing pipe to flow water down a piece of plastic knitting screen (also known as \\"plastic canvas\\"), which is roughed up to allow algae to attach. In almost every case, these homemade algae scrubbers reduced the nutrients to very low levels, and this reduced or eliminated all nuisance algae problems. In addition, \\"turf\\" algae, which was the focus of Dr. Adey's dumping-bucket design, is replaced by \\"green hair algae\\".AlgaeScrubber.Net This is because turf algae tends to be dark brown and thick (like artificial turf on sports fields), and it blocks the light and water from reaching the screen. This slows the growth (and filtering) of the algae because the bottom layers of algae that are attached to the screen start to die and detach. Green algae, however (especially light-green hair algae), allows light and water to penetrate all the way down to the screen if the growth is kept less than 20 mm thick,Production within dense mats of the filamentous macroalga Chaetomorpha linum in relation to light and nutrient availability, figure 5. https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/134/m134p207.pdf which allows the algae to grow faster and absorb more nutrients without dying and losing attachment to the screen. This is fortunate because green hair algae is the exact type of algae that grows automatically in a properly constructed algae scrubber. Some models also use up-flowing air bubbles. This version, which is basically the exact opposite of the waterfall, allows the algae scrubber to be placed underwater in the aquarium, sump or pond, instead of above it. This greatly simplifies construction, since the device does not need to be waterproof, and it allows placement of the scrubber into tight areas where there is no room above the water line. The design also keeps the algae from drying out in the event of a power failure, because all the algae is under water, and the design also removes almost all splashing. The up-flowing bubble design falls into three categories: those that attach to and shine through the aquarium (or sump) glass; those that float on top of the aquarium, sump or pond water surface; and those that go completely underwater like a submarine. =Cleaning and harvesting= Generally, and except for specific continuous-filtering or continuous-cultivating versions, algae scrubbers require the algae to be removed (\\"harvested\\") periodically from the scrubber. This removal of algae has the effect of removing undesired nutrients from the water because the algae used the nutrients in order to grow. The algae is generally removed either: *Every 7 to 21 days, or *When it is black, or *When it fills up the scrubber, or *When it starts letting go, or *When nutrients start to rise in the water. For waterfall versions, the screen is removed from the pipe and cleaned in a sink with running water. The pipe is removed also, and the slot is cleaned with a toothbrush, to remove any algae that have grown up into it. After the algae are removed, the screen and pipe are put back in the scrubber. For upflow versions, the cleaning method depends on the type: Glass-attached version: The magnet portion outside the glass is removed, and the inside portion is lifted out of the water. If the growth is thick green hair algae, then it is just removed by hand. If the growth is thin green hair (as occurs in freshwater) or dark slime, then the inside unit is taken to the sink and cleaned with a toothbrush. After cleaning, the inside and outside parts are put back into place on the glass. Floating-surface version: If the growth is thick green hair algae then it is just removed by hand by lifting the LED lid up and pulling the growth out. If the growth is thin green hair or dark slime, then the floating portion is taken to the sink and cleaned with a toothbrush. Drop-in version: The entire unit is lifted out of the water, and the lid is removed. If the growth is thick green hair algae then it is just removed by hand. If the growth is thin green hair or dark slime, then the whole unit is taken to the sink and cleaned with a toothbrush. If the screen is not cleaned like this periodically, the algae will get too thick and block light and flow from reaching the \\"roots\\" of the algae, and these areas will die and let go, putting nutrients back into the water.

Protesters demanded President Serzh Sargsyan release political prisoners, prosecute those responsible for the deaths of opposition activists after the 2008 presidential election and institute democratic and socioeconomic reforms, including the right to organise in Freedom Square in downtown Yerevan. They also protested against Yerevan Mayor Karen Karapetyan for banning the opposition from Freedom Square and barring vendors and traders from the city streets. The opposition bloc Armenian National Congress, which has played a major role in organising and leading the demonstrations, had also called for a snap election and the resignation of the government. The government granted several concessions to the protesters, including agreeing to the opposition's terms for an inquiry into the 2008 protest deaths, granting them a permit to rally in Freedom Square, and releasing several imprisoned opposition activists. Timeline of protests =Street vendor protests= Street vendors in Yerevan, angry over Mayor Karapetyan's decision on 13 January to start enforcing a strict ban on street trading, protested outside the municipal offices of the capital city on 19 January. City officials insisted the ban was necessary for public health and safety, but demonstrators shouted slogans criticizing Karapetyan, a Republican Party of Armenia official elected by the municipal assembly in December 2010 to finish out an incomplete term, and complaining that the municipality's ban has prevented many of them from making enough money to pay for food and shelter for themselves and their families. Some protesters, many of whose signs emphasized their peaceful intentions, called upon Karapetyan to either meet with them or resign. The protests in front of the municipal offices soon became a daily phenomenon stretching into February. =Political protests= With minor protests in Yerevan continuing and a revolutionary wave spreading throughout North Africa and Western Asia, opposition politicians like Stepan Safaryan of the Heritage party and former President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who was defeated by now- President Sargsyan in the disputed 2008 election, of the Armenian National Congress (HAK) suggested in early February that political upheaval could come to Armenia. Ter-Petrosyan called for an opposition rally in Yerevan's Freedom Square on 18 February not just to protest the Karapetyan administration, but to protest the government of President Serzh Sargsyan. The government responded by saying Liberty Square would be off-limits due to \\"sports and cultural events\\". The HAK said it planned to rally in the square regardless of whether the city government and the national government allowed it to do so. Political analysts said national opposition leaders like Ter-Petrosyan were harnessing an existing wave of unrest inspired by the Tunisian Revolution and protests in Egypt and evident in such events as the ongoing street vendor protests, with some predicting that the conditions were right for major protests to gain traction. 18 February On 18 February, the Armenian National Congress held a major protest drawing between 5,000 and 10,000 in the city center of Yerevan. The protesters, including Ter-Petrosyan, complained of low wages, unemployment, inflation, corruption, and a falling quality of living. Speakers at the rally also invoked the specter of the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions, and Ter-Petrosyan compared the Sargsyan administration to those fallen regimes. \\"The plight of our people is no better than the plight of the peoples of those countries, and Armenia's regime is no less dictatorial and hated than the regimes in those countries,\\" the former president said. He urged the government to resign and called for an uprising similar to those seen in Arab countries near Armenia. Ter-Petrosyan also called on street vendors and others already organizing in protest of government policies to \\"politicize\\" their rallies and join with the national opposition in calling for sweeping changes. 1 March The Armenian National Congress organized another rally in Yerevan on 1 March. According to estimates of the opposition, the rally was attended by over 50,000 citizens. The rally marked the third anniversary of post-election violence after Sargsyan's disputed victory in 2008, when 10 protesters were killed. Protesters again demanded early elections and called for Sargsyan to resign. Ter-Petrosyan spoke at the rally, calling the government a \\"bandit regime [that] seized power through falsified parliamentary and presidential elections and the bloody crime committed on 1 March 2008\\" and reiterating the demands aired at the 18 February protest. He also publicly called for the ban on street trading to be lifted and demanded economic reforms, including a higher minimum wage and unemployment benefits. 3 March About 50 street vendors backed by members of both the opposition party Heritage and the Armenian National Congress, including members of parliament, gathered outside a government building in Yerevan. Police moved to disperse them, resulting in a number of clashes. One HAK activist was arrested and one of the Heritage MPs was hospitalized with injuries. In defiance of a statement from Prime Minister Tigran Sargsyan promising an internal investigation into the allegations of police brutality, the police publicly blamed the MPs for inciting violence. The incident prompted renewed comparisons of the Karapetyan and Sargsyan administrations' policies to pre-revolutionary Tunisia by some analysts and opposition parliamentarians. 15 March ‚Äì \\"Fast for Freedom\\" Raffi Hovannisian on hunger-strike near Freedom Square, 16 March Armenian Minister of Parliament and Former Foreign Minister Raffi Hovannisian, a leader of Heritage, began a hunger strike in Freedom Square on 15 March to protest the government and advocate for snap elections. 17 March On 17 March, protesters continued to demand the resignations of the government, many members of which were elected in the disputed elections, in the evening at Freedom Square citing a will to replicate the Arab world protests. Ter- Petrosyan, again a featured speaker at the rally, said that the demonstrations were \\"peaceful\\" in intent. As many as 20,000 Armenians attended the rally, though the government said 9,000 attended and organizers claimed a turnout of 100,000. Hovannisian, now on the second day of his hunger strike, was present in Freedom Square with his supporters but was sidelined by Ter-Petrosyan and other Armenian National Congress leaders, straining relations between Heritage and the HAK. Before the rally, opposition activist Samson Khachatrian was arrested after two plainclothes police officers alleged he assaulted them at the 1 March rally, a move one HAK leader called \\"a provocation\\". Khachatrian was later convicted of the assault, spurring mass outcry from the opposition. 30 March In a ceremony at Freedom Square, Hovannisian ended his public hunger strike by eating a hunk of bread symbolically blessed by an Armenian Orthodox priest. He said health concerns, including warnings from his doctor, as well as the arrival of his daughter's 18th birthday prompted him to call off the 15-day hunger strike, but he claimed the strike had affected \\"the public consciousness\\" even if it had not moved authorities to change their \\"consciousness and policies\\". Hovannisian also acknowledged cracks in the opposition to Sargsyan and the government, but he did not specifically acknowledge the simmering dispute between Heritage and the Armenian National Congress. A Republican Party of Armenia MP criticized the hunger strike, saying it was not the best means of enacting change. 2‚Äì4 April Several female intellectuals, including a Heritage MP, held a sit-in each day in Freedom Square starting on 2 April as a \\"logical continuation\\" of Hovannisian's protest action the month before. During the sit-in, attended by a handful of women each day, protesters sat silently for five hours before departing the square. Some critics within the opposition decried the sit-in as a gimmick, with one calling it a \\"waste of time\\". 8 April On 8 April, Ter-Petrosyan gave a 35-minute speech in Yerevan. The rally, organized by the Armenian National Congress, drew 12,000 attendees to Freedom Square in the city center in violation of an official ban. Despite the ban by the Yerevan city council, police ultimately stood aside in the face of the crowd and permitted the gathering. Ter-Petrosyan said that the Sargsyan administration must fulfill three demands by 28 April: promising an \\"objective inquiry\\" into post-election violence in 2008, giving the HAK the permanent legal right to demonstrate in Yerevan's Freedom Square, and securing the release of political prisoners. The former president also warned the opposition would \\"drastically change\\" its methods of resistance unless its demands were met. At a press conference several days after the rally, Armenian National Congress official Levon Zurabian warned that the opposition saw the political situation as \\"a war, a real war\\". Zurabian added, \\"And if we want to achieve something in that war, we must and we will get ready for war.\\" He suggested that mass striking, sit-ins, large-scale marches, and other acts of civil disobedience could be the next step for the opposition. Zurabian also claimed that, contrary to suggestions from leaders in allied parties that the opposition is ready to negotiate a deal that keeps the Sargsyan administration in power, the goal of the HAK remains forcing Sargsyan to resign and a snap election to be held. 28 April Two days before the planned rally in Freedom Square on 28 April, the municipality of Yerevan reversed its earlier decision not to grant permits to HAK to gather in the square. The mayor's office agreed to a planned route that included a demonstration in Freedom Square, issuing a permit for the first time in over two years for the gathering. The government also said the ban on demonstrations in the square would be lifted from 28 April forward. Reuters reported a turnout of about 5,000 at the rally. Ter-Petrosyan referred to the government's announcement of concessions on access to Freedom Square and the investigation into the 2008 post-election violence and told the crowd, \\"If the door to dialogue is not yet open, it is half open.\\" For the first time since protests began in January and February, he suggested that the grievances of demonstrators could be addressed through negotiation rather than regime change. Ter-Petrosyan also called on President Sargsyan to release jailed political dissidents and activists in time for the next planned rally on 31 May. A significant number of protesters reportedly did not take part in a march through Yerevan following Ter-Petrosyan's speech, with some continuing to occupy the square afterward rather than leave, and the former president elicited some boos, whistles, and jeers when he expressed confidence that the government would release all political prisoners within weeks. Although HAK official Levon Zurabian said the party remains intent on forcing snap elections, Ter-Petrosyan did not mention the resignation of the government or new elections once throughout the speech. 21 May Raffi Hovannisian, the leader of Heritage, held an assembly in the Government Hall of Sessions in Yerevan reportedly attended by hundreds of citizens, including several fellow political figures and famous activists. Three panel discussions comprised the bulk of the town hall meeting, with topics of human rights, civics, and solutions to political differences featured respectively. Hovannisian set 4 June as the next date for an assembly, to be held in the more public setting of Freedom Square. 31 May Despite the general amnesty for jailed anti- government activists issued days before, the HAK held a major rally as scheduled in Freedom Square. The Armenian Police estimated a turnout of about 6,000, though the opposition disputed the figure and said it was much higher. HAK political leaders, including former Prime Minister Aram Sargsyan, former President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, and recently released ex-MP Sasun Mikaelyan, said the government was finally showing a willingness to engage with the opposition and meet its demands, as evidenced by the amnesty, and complimented protesters on their achievement in putting pressure on the government to fulfill the HAK's three preconditions for dialogue. However, Ter-Petrosyan, People's Party of Armenia head Stepan Demirchyan, and amnestied editor Nikol Pashinyan, among others, reiterated the HAK's calls for snap elections, criticizing the current government as the \\"result of rigged elections\\". Ter- Petrosyan also said that in the coming days, opposition leaders would be meeting with the government to present its proposal for a transition toward new elections, though he cautioned that the government would likely have different ideas and present its own agenda. Demirchyan took a less conciliatory tone, saying, \\"If the authorities fail to go for snap elections, we must force them.\\" A Heritage MP also demanded the immediate release of her brother, who she said should have been freed under both recent changes to the Armenian criminal code and the recent amnesty, which purportedly covers him. The rally reportedly concluded with a march around downtown Yerevan, a promise by HAK officials that another rally would be held in June, and mass chants of \\"Levon for President!\\" 30 June At a rally police said was attended by 4,000 demonstrators, HAK luminaries including Pashinyan, Zurabian, and Ter- Petrosyan criticised the Armenian government. Pashinyan called President Sargsian's statement on 22 June in which he said Azerbaijan was better prepared for a war over Nagorno-Karabakh than Armenia \\"one of the most disgraceful...in the diplomatic history of the Third Republic of Armenia,\\" claiming it strengthened Azerbaijan's posture in the ongoing dispute. Zurabian warned that if the government did not engage with the HAK directly in \\"a short time,\\" people would gather in the streets for mass protests. He said the government knew that \\"the only way to avoid a revolution or a social riot is agree to negotiations.\\" Ter-Petrosyan said that unless the government agreed to the opposition's demands, including setting snap elections, by the next scheduled rally on 1 August, the HAK would return to the rhetoric of calling for Sargsian's immediate resignation. The tone of the rally suggested that the d√©tente evident in the spirit of the previous two HAK mass gatherings had decidedly cooled. 30 September At a rally on 30 September, HAK decided to start a \\"non-stop rally\\", which was demanded by the protesters.  1‚Äì8 October sit-in ‘±’¶’°’ø’∏÷Ç’©’µ’°’∂ ’∞÷Ä’°’∫’°÷Ä’°’Ø’∏÷Ç’¥ ’Ä‘±‘ø ’∞’°’∂÷Ä’°’∞’°’æ’°÷Ñ’® ’Ω’Ø’Ω’æ’•÷Å ‘±‘∂‘±’è’à’í‘π’Ö‘±’Ü ’Ä’ê‘±’ä‘±’ê‘±‘ø’à’í’Ñ ‘∏’Ü‘π‘±’Ü’à’í’Ñ ‘∑ ’Ä‘±‘ø ’Ä‘±’Ü’ê‘±’Ä‘±’é‘±’î‘∏ ‘ª’∂’π’´’û ’Ø’∞’°’∂’£’•÷Å’∂’•’∂ ’Ä‘±‘ø-’´ ’∑’∏÷Ç÷Ä’ª÷Ö÷Ä’µ’° ’∞’°’∂÷Ä’°’∞’°’æ’°÷Ñ’∂’•÷Ä’® ’Ä‘±‘ø-’´ ‘±’Ñ’ì’à’ì‘ª’â ‘≤‘±’Ü‘±’Å‘µ’í‘∏ 28 October ’Ä‘±‘ø ’∞’°’∂÷Ä’°’∞’°’æ’°÷Ñ’® ’¥’•’Ø’∂’°÷Ä’Ø’•÷Å ’Ä‘±‘ø ’∞’°’∂÷Ä’°’∞’°’æ’°÷Ñ’® ’°’æ’°÷Ä’ø’æ’•÷Å ‘º’•÷Ç’∏’∂ ’è’•÷Ä-’ä’•’ø÷Ä’∏’Ω’µ’°’∂’´ ’•’¨’∏÷Ç’µ’©’®\` ’Ä‘±‘ø ’∞’°’∂÷Ä’°’∞’°’æ’°÷Ñ’∏÷Ç’¥ ’Ä‘±‘ø ’∞’°’∂÷Ä’°’∞’°’æ’°÷Ñ’® ’¥’•’Ø’∂’°÷Ä’Ø’•’¨ ’ß ’Ä‘±‘ø ’∞’°’∂÷Ä’°’∞’°’æ’°÷Ñ’® ’¥’•’Ø’∂’°÷Ä’Ø’•÷Å 25 November ’Ä‘±‘ø ’∂’∏÷Ä ’∞’º’π’°’Ø’°’£’´÷Ä’® Composition The most prominent demonstrations in the pre‚Äì18 February period of the 2011 protests were held by street vendors. The Armenian National Congress sought to capitalize on the wave of rising dissent, fueled by successful uprisings against regimes in Tunisia and Egypt. As such, the HAK emerged as the leading voice in protests, with its leader Levon Ter-Petrosyan addressing all major rallies in Yerevan from 18 February onward. The HAK strongly encouraged merchants and others disillusioned with the government's policies to join them, and Ter-Petrosyan has aligned his party's goals with those of the street vendors who began the initial protests. However, the HAK has not been the only voice of criticism against the government. Heritage, one of only two opposition parties with seats in the National Assembly, has also been active in galvanizing protest, though its demonstrations have been on a smaller scale and have largely come in the form of civil disobedience actions, such as hunger strikes and sit-ins, and public conferences. On 26 April, leader Raffi Hovannisian released a statement demanding that the government convene a constitutional convention, grant the International Criminal Court jurisdiction over Armenia, and officially recognize the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. He said his supporters numbered in the \\"tens of thousands\\". Another opposition group that emerged in late April, though it has not had any major role in organizing demonstrations, is the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (HHD), or Dashnaktsutyun, the other opposition party with a parliamentary presence. On 28 April, Dashnak leader Armen Rustamian criticized both Ter-Petrosyan and President Serzh Sargsyan, saying neither the HAK nor the Republican Party of Armenia (HHK) represent the interests of Armenians and that Ter-Petrosyan's role in fomenting dissent is self-serving. Rustamian has called for \\"radical\\" change, suggesting that any compromise between the HAK and the HHK will not \\"lead to a meaningful improvement of the existing situation\\". The Dashnaks have reportedly urged Sargsyan, whom their party supported as a coalition partner until 2009, to dismiss the government and hold snap elections. Both HHD and Heritage have adopted a hard line on Nagorno-Karabakh, jointly insisting in late June that the government not accept the terms laid out at a meeting in Kazan, Russia, and warning of massive street protests if Sargsian compromised on the breakaway republic's status. Role of social networking The social networking website Facebook served as an early vehicle for organizing action against the government. Activists set up a new website called Revoforum, shorthand for \\"Revolutionary Forum\\", on 2 April as a discussion board for the political situation in Armenia. Complaints over high cost of living and inflation have reportedly driven historically apolitical but Internet-savvy young Armenians to organize online, and some have used sites like Facebook, Revoforum, and Twitter to get involved with street protests as well. Response Police officials have accused opposition members of subverting peaceful protests, as in the case of the small 3 March protest that turned into a scuffle between protesters and law enforcement. A police statement claimed activists agitating for political reforms tried to \\"provoke fighting between citizens and the police\\" and defended the police response, which injured at least one protester. One government MP said the protest ban on Freedom Square was for activists' sake, suggesting that violence could erupt if demonstrators were permitted to gather in the square. He also said President Sargsyan is not a dictator and is \\"not Gaddafi\\", a reference to Libyan leader Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi, who has faced a sustained uprising against his rule since February. Another HHK official said the government would not make any concessions as long as the opposition continues to make demands. On 31 March, in response to ongoing discontent from vendors petitioning for the re-legalization of street trading, the deputy mayor of Yerevan said of the crackdown, \\"These actions aimed at enforcing the law are resolute and final.\\" He brushed aside the anger of protesters attending a parliamentary hearing on the matter, saying that the municipality already provides for trading in approved markets as a reasonable alternative to vending on the street. On 12 April, the office of Yerevan Mayor Karen Karapetyan reaffirmed its protest ban on Freedom Square, a ban the opposition signaled it would continue to ignore. At a press conference, Karapetyan defended the ban, saying, \\"There are places in all countries of the world where no demonstrations are allowed to be held.\\" The mayor said he did not view the ban as a violation of the opposition's freedom of speech. President Sargsian expressed frustration in a 12 July interview over repeated questions as to the legitimacy of the elections that brought him and many of his parliamentary allies to power. He complained of a lack of civility in Armenian politics and said that just because Ter-Petrosyan and his backers did not congratulate him on his victory or formally concede the election, that did not mean the results were illegitimate. Sargsian has vowed that parliamentary elections scheduled for 2012 will be democratic in keeping with the standards of the Council of Europe. =Concessions= In April, the National Assembly finally passed a bill, which had been under debate for six months, expanding rights to free assembly. The new law gives people the legal right to gather peacefully, as demonstrators have done in Yerevan since January. Armenian police chief Alik Sargsian said on 14 April that he would take a tougher approach to abuses and corruption in the ranks of the republic's law enforcement. \\"Let people understand that impunity is now unacceptable in the police,\\" Alik Sargsian said. He did not specify whether he would focus on punishing police over alleged abuses of detainees and suspects. On 19 April, Samson Khachatrian, the opposition activist convicted of assaulting police during the 1 March 2011 protest, was released after demands from opposition leaders that he be set free. The Sargsyan administration vowed on 20 April to give greater priority to investigating allegations of violence against opposition supporters on 1 March 2008, a key demand of the protesters. \\"I expect new impetus and sharply intensified efforts to investigate the events,\\" said Sargsyan at a conference open to press. Sargsyan also promised new reforms to make the Armenian justice system more effective and efficient. On 21 April, the government's chief investigator said, \\"The examination of the March 1 events will be reviewed entirely.\\" He promised investigators would seek new evidence, review existing evidence, and reconsider its findings. Deputy Speaker Samvel Nikoyan, a parliamentary ally of Sargsyan, said he believed the concessions would prompt Ter-Petrosyan and other major critics in the opposition to consider that \\"language of ultimatum is not expedient while addressing the authorities\\". Nikoyan said he expects the opposition will join in \\"civilized dialogue\\" with the government as a result of the promised reexamination of the case. A HAK official agreed that one of the opposition's demands had been met, but said two other demands‚Äîpresumably the release of political prisoners and access to Freedom Square, which Ter-Petrosyan also mentioned on 8 April‚Äîare outstanding and suggested he would not be fully satisfied by the promise of renewed investigation into the 1 March 2008 violence until the results were made public. Karapetyan fulfilled another of Ter-Petrosyan's demands, at least in the short term, by granting a permit on 26 April for the planned 28 April HAK demonstration in Freedom Square. On 27 April, Sargsyan expressed hope for a peaceful dialogue between the government and the opposition going forward, with Freedom Square as a forum for \\"alternative ideas\\". He said his administration was willing to make the \\"first steps\\" in the hope of achieving compromise and \\"cooperation\\". On 26 May, the National Assembly passed a wide-reaching amnesty plan for hundreds of prisoners, including six opposition activists detained since 2008, thus fulfilling the HAK's third and final precondition for dialogue with the government. Levon Zurabian said the opposition party will enter into negotiations with the Republican Party of Armenia for early elections to be held, as the HAK continues to dispute the legitimacy of the elections that brought Sargsyan and many government parliamentarians to power. Two jailed activists were released the next day, with more purportedly to follow. The government offered another major concession on 9 July, with a spokesman for Sargsian saying the HHK and its two junior coalition partners, Prosperous Armenia (BHK) and Rule of Law (OEK), had agreed to form an ad hoc group to hold negotiations with the HAK. Several senior party officials and lawmakers were appointed to this group, which is intended to meet with a similar HAK delegation to discuss a solution to the standoff over Armenia's governance. In December, Caucasus Institute director Alexander Iskandaryan named the dialogue between the opposition and the government prompted by the protests as one of the most significant developments of 2011, saying it \\"altered the political reality in Armenia\\".

Common themes espoused by demonstrators, many of whom are affiliated with M√ºsavat and the Popular Front Party, the main opposition parties in Azerbaijan, include doubts as to the legitimacy of the 2008 presidential election, desire for the release of political prisoners, calls for democratic reforms, and demands that Aliyev and his government resign from power. Azerbaijani authorities have responded with a security crackdown, dispersing protests and curtailing attempts to gather with force and numerous arrests. The European Union, the United States Department of State, Amnesty International, and other organizations called on the government to release political prisoners and allow for free assembly. Meanwhile, Azerbaijani Prosecutor General Zakir Qaralov vowed to \\"suppress\\" protests, comparing them to incidents in \\"other countries\\" and saying that the government would not allow them to go forward. Background On 29 January, more than 100 activists and politicians not affiliated with the Azerbaijani government gathered in Baku to urge President Ilham Aliyev to dismiss the government and call snap elections. Several critics compared Aliyev to then- President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and warned that Azerbaijan could face popular protests as part of a regional wave of civil unrest, though leaders of the Azerbaijani Popular Front Party and M√ºsavat stopped short of threatening to lead them personally. Around the same time, 20-year-old web activist and APFP supporter Jabbar Savalan gained prominence for posting increasingly provocative invective against the government on Facebook and other social networking websites, eventually calling in early February for a \\"Day of Rage\\" modeled off the protests in Egypt, with major protests to be held in downtown Baku. Authorities reacted by arresting Savalanly in Sumqayit on 5 February and charging him with marijuana possession, a charge his supporters claimed was fabricated. Opposition groups called on authorities to release the young activist and compared his detention to the suppression of dissidents in Egypt and other countries, but police insisted the arrest was not political. On 6 February, an unsanctioned protest was held at the Egypt‚ÄìAzerbaijan Friendship Park outside Baku, in the suburb of Xƒ±rdalan. Several dozen rally-goers, mostly young men and women, waved signs and chanted slogans calling for Egyptian President Mubarak to step down, but also voiced dissent against several recently adopted Azerbaijani government policies, including price increases for services. Police dispersed the gathering within minutes, making no arrests. Political protests =March= Youth activists Elnur Majidli, Bakhtiyar Hajiyev, and others called on Facebook for mass protests on 11 March 2011 to mark the one-month anniversary of both Hosni Mubarak's resignation and the detention of Savalanly on what they called are trumped-up charges. In response, the government reportedly dispatched military forces to Baku to bolster security in the former Soviet republic's capital. Members of the opposition in the National Assembly indicated support for the demonstrators, demanded the release of political prisoners, and called on the cabinet, led by former Communist Party member Prime Minister Artur Rasizade, to resign over its failure to institute reforms. The government claimed the demonstrations were organized by the parliamentary opposition under the guise of grassroots activism, but activists denied this, citing criticism from politically like- minded allies in the National Assembly over the date of the planned protests as an example of where they differ from the opposition parties. 11 March ‚Äì \\"The Great People's Day\\" On 11 March, police foiled several attempted protests, arresting at least 43. The New York Times reported that about 60 people gathered in Baku, the capital city, in response to the scheduled event on Facebook, but security forces quickly clamped down, preventing the demonstration from gaining much steam. 12 March A larger protest in Baku, the capital city, drew several hundred people on 12 March, The New York Times reported. The protest was led by M√ºsavat, in contrast to the smaller youth-led demonstrations of the previous day. Once again, however, police were prepared for the rally and began arresting people on the spot, including at least one person for speaking to a Western journalist, though media reported they had a more difficult time subduing the larger, better-prepared protest than they had on 11 March. About 50 people were arrested on this second day of protests. Although most of the protesters appeared to be supporters of the secular, relatively pro-Western M√ºsavat and similar parties, a number of young protesters representing the Islamist opposition began chanting \\"Allahu Akbar\\", reportedly angering police on the scene. At least 30 people arrested in connection with the protests were sentenced to time in prison, the United States Department of State reported. M√ºsavat demanded that President Ilham Aliyev step down over the incident. The Azerbaijani Human Rights House and the European Union, among others, criticised Aliyev's government and called on authorities to allow people to demonstrate peacefully. Other incidents Reuters reported that at least 150 activists were arrested in Azerbaijan during March, including those detained 11‚Äì12 March. =April= Opposition groups signaled their intention to hold additional protests in April in spite of warnings from authorities not to do so. Officials in Baku pushed government opponents to rally only in a designated part of Bebiheybat, outside the city center of Baku, but the opposition refused any deal by which protesters would not march in downtown Baku. Opposition leader Ali Karimli of the Azerbaijani Popular Front Party said that while activists intended to demonstrate peacefully, \\"In case of a provocation, however, we will not be responsible.\\" 2 April ‚Äì \\"Day of Wrath\\" Another protest was held on 2 April at Fountain Square in Baku's city center, with between 350 and 1,000 demonstrators in attendance. The APFP and M√ºsavat called the demonstration a \\"Day of Wrath\\" and led the rally downtown instead of holding it in a government-approved stadium on the outskirts of the city. Police arrested well over 200 demonstrators, detaining at least two Azerbaijani journalists covering the protest as well. Isa Gambar, the leader of M√ºsavat, responded to the crackdown and the government's charging of four opposition leaders with \\"organizing mass unrest\\" by vowing to intensify protests. On 10 October, four of the arrested activists were given sentences from 18 months to three years in prison.

Kavkazsky Uzel. 10 October 2011. 17 April Police again dispersed an attempted demonstration in Baku's Fountain Square on 17 April, arresting activists chanting pro-democracy slogans, including a mother and her young daughter, and briefly detaining two or three Swedish journalists. The Swedes were later deported. One woman reportedly warned police as they arrested her, \\"Don't think you'll be able to keep your government. A 30-year-old government collapsed in Egypt.\\" Officials said they detained 65 people in total. While the government again attempted to confine demonstrations to a small area on the outskirts of Baku, Gambar and other opposition leaders have vowed to continue holding protests in the city center in defiance of the law, as its requests to be allowed to gather in front of the Narimanov Cinema downtown were denied and the organizers rejected alternative settings proffered by the city council. The crackdown came in defiance of an appeal from human rights watchdog Amnesty International to allow peaceful protests to go forward. 20 April To commemorate the four-year anniversary of Azerbaijani journalist Eynulla Fatullayev, 20 journalists held a one-day hunger strike to protest what they view as his unjust imprisonment. \\"We want to demonstrate our complaints against the arrest of Eynulla Fatullayev [by striking],\\" said editor Aynur Elganesh. =May= Though action by the political opposition was subdued throughout the first half of the month, unrest continued in the capital of Baku. 6 May Police swiftly dispersed a protest on 6 May in Baku. Protesters called on the government to allow Muslim girls to wear the hijab in school. Several dozen were arrested, and police reportedly used batons and pepper spray to subdue some of the demonstrators. 22 May Youth activists rallied on Baku Boulevard to call for the release of \\"political prisoners\\", fellow activists imprisoned on what they believe are trumped-up charges. Four activists and a journalist covering the event were arrested, though the journalist was released later that same evening. The activists were sentenced to between seven and eight days of jail time each. =June= 19 June Police arrested \\"23 of about 80 protesters\\" affiliated with the opposition Public Chamber in Baku in front of the Narimanov Cinema, a frequent site of attempted rallies against the government during the protests of 2011. Interior Minister Ehsan Zahidov insisted that the protesters, by gathering in front of the cinema instead of at the Bibi Heybat settlement on the outskirts of the city, were \\"violating the constitutional rights of citizens\\" and added, \\"If the Public Chamber rally set for 19 June [was] sanctioned by the Baku Mayor's Office and staged in a venue allotted by it, the police would provide security of rally participants.\\" Police were present in the square an hour before protesters arrived, successfully thwarting the rally. =November= Around 30‚Äî35 opposition youth activists organised a protest in front of Baku's City Hall on 15 November chanting \\"Freedom!\\" but were soon violently confronted by police forces. The arrested activists were released within the next hours.

Hijab protests  Hijab protests in Azerbaijan is a consequence of recently changes specially in formal and social aspects of Azerbaijan. The hijab ban in schools and arresting of social activists can be mentioned as these changes. The government of Azerbaijan arrested a few Leaders of Opposition and this caused a new round of protests and rallies inside the country. these parties include the Popular front of Azerbaijan, the Musavat Party, and the Islamic party. Leaders of these parties face long prison terms. Movsum Samadov, leader of the Islamic Party of Azerbaijan, has been charged with preparing an act of terror. Several Demonstrations and Rallies took place in Different cities of Azerbaijan Due to Islam-Fighting Policy of Azerbaijan's Government. Thousands of Azeri Muslims have held demonstrations to protest the new policy. Main dates of these protest include: 11 March, 2 April, 6 and 19 May and 10 December 2011. United States Ambassador, The European Union, Amnesty International, The International Press Institute and peoples of some cities of Iran expressed concern over the Azerbaijani government's response to protests in the county. Tactics Protesters have used social networking sites such as Facebook to spread information about rallies, including when and where to meet. However, BBC News has noted that as many as 80 percent of Azerbaijanis do not use the Internet, which has perhaps contributed to relatively low turnout compared to protests in neighboring Armenia and Iran, among other places. A BBC analyst also remarked upon a strategy seen at the unsuccessful 17 April rally in Fountain Square, with demonstrators slowly gathering while at least initially trying to appear unorganized, very similar to a smart mob. Domestic response The government has striven to keep rallies from gathering much strength, dispersing the initial youth-led protests on 11 March in some cases before they could even start. To accomplish this, authorities have ordered security forces to the scene of planned demonstrations, taking a proactive approach rather than reacting once protests actually break out. Police have generally not hesitated to detain and arrest anyone they judge to be a possible agitator, including Azerbaijanis seen talking to journalists, and on at least two occasions, they have detained journalists themselves. Authorities have cited the relatively small scale of protests as proof that the Azerbaijani public supports the government and does not approve of the opposition parties. They frequently use the descriptor \\"radical\\" to characterize protesters and opposition leaders. Government officials, including Prosecutor General Zakir Qaralov, have also accused opposition leaders like Ali Karimli and Isa Gambar of being agents of foreign governments. In response, Karimli said after being interrogated for over eight hours on 16 April, \\"Speaking about who we are working for, there is only one address: the people of Azerbaijan.\\" While the government has attempted to publicly discredit the main opposition leaders, and both Karimli and Gambar have been summoned for questioning, neither has yet been arrested. Other activists have been charged with such crimes as \\"inciting hatred\\". The government has warned the France-based blogger who first called for the 11 March protests on Facebook that he will be prosecuted and could face up to 12 years in prison if he returns to Azerbaijan. His family has reportedly also faced consequences, with his father and cousins briefly being detained and the government allegedly pressuring his parents' employers to fire them from their jobs. On 25 April, police raided the offices of Gambar's party M√ºsavat in Baku. In mid-May, a top official with the ruling New Azerbaijan Party claimed the only young protesters attending rallies were relatives of opposition leaders, whom he said \\"must step aside and give their place to a new generation and build new relations\\" because they \\"have no popular trust\\" and have failed to offer new ideas since the 1990s. He also said he believed the government's efforts to curb corruption, a key complaint of protesters, were sincere and making an impact. Claims to the contrary, he said, were \\"senseless\\". On 26 May, Aliyev issued an unexpected presidential pardon to journalist Eynulla Fatullayev after four years of imprisonment. Fatullayev was duly released from prison. In an interview the next day, he said that if the government guaranteed freedom of the press and promised him he would not be punished for his reporting, he would return to work as a journalist in Azerbaijan. The government put four APFP members, one M√ºsavat activist, and an unaffiliated anti-government demonstrator on trial on 13 July over their alleged role in organizing protests. Defense lawyers argued that the protests were peaceful and not disruptive, said plainclothes men who helped police to detain the protesters should be subpoenaed for questioning, and suggested Baku city officials violated protesters' right to freedom of assembly by denying permission for the protests, but their arguments were rejected by the judge. =Counter-demonstrations= Trend News Agency reported that about 100 young Azerbaijanis gathered in front of Karimli's house on 13 April to remonstrate against the APFP leader's role in organizing protests. The rally was reportedly broken up by police, with two protesters being detained, as it was officially unsanctioned. International reaction United States Ambassador to Azerbaijan Matthew Bryza expressed concern over the Azerbaijani government's response to protests in March. On 15 April, Bryza denied the government's accusations that the Obama administration supports revolution in the South Caucasian republic. Bryza admitted that U.S. diplomats in Baku had met with Ali Karimli and Isa Gambar in early April, but said he had not been party to the talks and they did not constitute official U.S. backing for the opposition's goals. \\"Our desire is to step up sustainable activity and reform,\\" Bryza said. The United States Department of State has also issued separate admonishments to the Azerbaijani government, seen as a vital U.S. ally in the region, to allow its citizens to assemble peacefully and to guarantee due process for the detained. The European Union criticized Azerbaijan for \\"lack of respect of fundamental freedoms\\" after the 2 April rally was broken up by security forces. The supranational body called on authorities to allow for freedom of speech, free assembly, and freedom of the press, rights it suggested the government's response disrespected. On 13 April, Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov summoned the head of the EU delegation to Azerbaijan to express his government's displeasure over the statement. On 12 May, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in which it sharply condemned the government crackdown and called for the release of political prisoners. Amnesty International also prevailed upon the government to allow peaceful protests. In a letter published in British daily The Guardian on 20 April, its UK affiliate called for the release of Eynulla Fatullayev and other detained journalists and insisted Baku should \\"comply with international standards on human rights ‚Äì specifically the right to assembly and the right to free expression\\". The International Press Institute echoed Amnesty's criticisms, condemning the Azerbaijani government's deportation of three Swedish journalists for reporting on the demonstration in Fountain Square on 17 April. At least one political analyst, a Dubai-based consultant on energy issues, suggested the Iranian government may have lent covert backing to protests. He said Iran has a vested interest in discouraging foreign investment in Azerbaijan, a regional rival for oil and natural gas exports, and Tehran may have sought to spook investors by attempting to destabilize the country. Many activists demanded a boycott of the 2012 Eurovision song Contest after Azerbaijan won in 2011, but it never materialized.

The game employs a unique control scheme: the player moves the road under a car instead of the car itself to achieve the objectives of the game. Story The story begins at a cafe, where a waiter slips a girl a note asking her on a date. The two soon fall in love, buying a car and getting married. The couple has a baby, to whom they give their harmonica. The child grows up and meets a girl, whom he marries. He later goes off to war, where he presumably dies. His family mourns him, and eventually they give his four- year-old son his harmonica. Gameplay In Bumpy Road, players navigate a car through an endless stage by tapping the ground, which creates hills and moves the car. Tapping below the car makes it jump, which can be used to jump on platforms and over water. Along the way, players have to pick up fuel in the form of small circular pellets to avoid stopping. Players can also collect pictures, which tell the story of the two main characters. The game has two modes. Evergreen Ride sees players going as far as they can without falling into water. In Sunday Trip, players drive through a level in an attempt to reach the finish line as fast as possible. Reception The game has a Metacritic score of 86/100 based on 15 critic reviews.

Biography  =Early life and education= Jean Daujat was born on 27 October 1906, in Paris to parents who were non- practicing believers. Daujat was home schooled by his mother until he entered the Lycee Pasteur in 1918. He obtained a BA in philosophy, with honors in mathematics. In September 1923, Daujat entered Lyc√©e Janson-de-Sailly where he studied mathematics. Meanwhile, his former high school biology teacher Pastor Jules Lefevre directed him toward the philosophy of Saint Thomas Aquinas. Daujat also discovered the philosophy of Jacques Maritain, who greatly influenced his own work. Jules Lefevre then introduced him to Am√©d√©e d'Yvignac, who had founded the French Gazette, which was subtitled \\"organ of Christian politics.\\" Jean Daujat collaborated in this review along with Maritain, Henri Massis and Henri Gheon. =Center for Religious Studies= In the fall of 1925 Jean Daujat and a group of seven men began the Centre d'√©tudes religieuses. The creation of the Centre d'√©tudes religieuses would be the focus his work for the rest of his life. In 1926, Jean Daujat entered the Ecole Normale Superieure to study science. Classmates included √âtienne Borne and Merleau-Ponty in the literature department, the mathematician Chevalley, and the physicist and geneticist Rosenfeld Heir. Other influential men who attended alongside Daujat were Raymond Aron, Paul Nizan, Jean-Paul Sartre, Henri Cartan and Jean Dieudonn√©, two of the founders of the Bourbaki group, Louis Neel, Nobel Prize laureate in physics, Olivier Lacombe, also a disciple of Jacques Maritain and specialist in Oriental languages, Henri-Ir√©n√©e Marrou, Maurice Bardeche, Robert Brasillach, Thierry Maulnier and Simone Weil. During this period, Daujat continued his philosophical and spiritual training. With Maritain, he became acquainted with Vladimir Ghika, a Romanian prince who became a Catholic priest. Daujat dedicated a book to Ghika some fifty years later, as well as Father Garrigou-Lagrange. For several years he has collaborated with writer Yvonne ERC Estienne. =Marriage= In 1930 Daujat married Danish painter Sonia Hansen, a talented portraitist and landscape painter. =Work= In 1931, Daujat began teaching himself at the Centre d'√©tudes religieuses, supported by Cardinal Verdier. He begins to write a treatise on theology and spirituality, The Supernatural Life, which appeared in 1938 with a preface by Archbishop Beaussart and Father Garrigou-Lagrange. In 1933 he founded the Monthly Magazine which was published until 1939. In addition to its own articles and those of Yvonne Estienne, there were many prestigious authors who wrote for the magazine, such as Father Garrigou- Lagrange, Mgt Ghika, Father Lallement, Jacques Maritain, Henri Gheon, Charles Du Bos, Stanislas Broth, Robert of Harcourt, Gustave Thibon, Henriette Charasson, Olivier Lacombe, Merleau-Ponty, and Jacques Madaule. Daujat published several books on philosophy and theology. In 1970 The Christian Social Order. And In 1974 Y a-t-il une Verite? was published. After the war, his teaching affected thousands of students. He wrote for several magazines like The New Man or The Catholic France. He published over thirty books, some of which were translated into several languages. In December 1946, he defended a thesis on the history of science on the theory of electric and magnetic phenomena before a jury that included Gaston Bachelard and Louis de Broglie. He published two books on the philosophy of science: Modern Physics and Traditional Philosophy.

A noncontinuous portion exists in Faribault, part of Highway 21. There are several commercial districts along it, including Lyn-Lake in South Minneapolis, Shops at Lyndale in Richfield, and the Oxboro area in Bloomington. Portions of both Interstate 94 and Interstate 35 run on the right-of-way of Lyndale Avenue.  Description of route  Lyndale Avenue in Lowry Hill, Minneapolis In Faribault, Lyndale Avenue is a divided four-lane highway with a 45 mph speed limit. Between Faribault and the Minnesota River, Lyndale Avenue has been replaced by Interstate 35. North of the river, the old Lyndale Avenue resumes in Bloomington. At the south edge of Bloomington, it is a 2-lane road, until 106th Street West. Through most of Bloomington and Richfield, it is an undivided four-lane city street. There are major commercial districts at 98th Street, American Boulevard, 77th Street (Kensington Park and Shops at Lyndale), and 66th Street (Woodlake Center). Shortly after entering Minneapolis, the street becomes a one-way, to connect with Minnesota State Highway 121, a freeway spur connecting Lyndale Ave and Interstate 35W. After their junction at 56th Street West, the road becomes a divided two-lane roadway across Minnehaha Creek and north toward Uptown. Near the intersection with Lake Street, it becomes a four-lane again, a major commercial street which remains continuous until the Virginia Triangle (the commons with Hennepin Avenue). After the Triangle, Lyndale Avenue splits, with matching one-ways on either side of Interstate 94. They join at Plymouth Avenue. The street remains four lanes until Broadway. The two-lane road ends at 57th Avenue North in Brooklyn Center, near the junction of I-94 and Interstate 694.  History  The street was historically a rural route from Minneapolis to Faribault, though most of that route has since been replaced by Interstate 35 and I-35W. The Lyndale Avenue name is not signed on these routes. From 1926 to 1934, U.S. Highway 65 traveled concurrently along Lyndale from the Minnesota‚ÄìIowa state line to Minneapolis and St.Paul via Northfield, where the road split to its various directions, later rejoining north of the downtowns and continuing north towards Littleforkhttp://www.deadpioneer.com/routes/US65/index.htm. Again, the route was not always known as Lyndale Avenue, however. This route also ran through the south metro cities of Lakeville, Burnsville, Bloomington, Richfield and along the east shoreline of Wood Lake before continuing into Minneapolis. The modern portions of Lyndale Avenue is designated as County Road 22 (in Minneapolis) and Minnesota State Highway 21 (in Faribault). Prior to the portion south of Minneapolis being upgraded to a freeway, it was also part of Minnesota State Highway 65.Politics and Freeways: Building the Twin Cities Interstate System In addition, there is a brief location north of Interstate 35W where a short highway is signed as Minnesota State Highway 121, which follows the old US 65 route into south Minneapolis. Lyndale Avenue takes its name from Lyndale Farm, a farm owned by William S. King. The name of the farm was in honor of King's father, Rev. Lyndon King, an itinerant Methodist minister of northern New York, who was named for Josiah Lyndon, colonial governor of Rhode Island in 1768-1769.

Manufactured by Vekoma, the roller coaster is situated in the Fantasyland sections of both parks. The Magic Kingdom version opened to the public on May 28, 2014, as part of a major park expansion called New Fantasyland, while the Shanghai version opened on June 16, 2016. The ride is themed to Walt Disney's 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the first traditional-animated feature film. History The Fantasyland section of the Magic Kingdom underwent a large expansion and renovation from March 2010 through May 2014. As part of the expansion, the Magic Kingdom's original Snow White attraction, Snow White's Scary Adventures, was permanently closed on May 31, 2012 and replaced with Princess Fairytale Hall, a new Disney Princess meet and greet. A new area themed to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, featuring Snow White's cottage and the new Seven Dwarfs Mine Train roller coaster, was dedicated on May 2, 2014 and officially opened on May 28, 2014. The ride soft-opened in the Magic Kingdom on May 21, 2014, fully opening a week later on May 28, 2014, Replacing 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: Submarine Voyage (1971-94) and Pooh's Playful Spot (2005-10). Description =Queue= The queue hosts a few interactive activities. One was a gem- sorting game where guests match up three jewels of different shape but the same color, but has since been replaced with an overlay of immovable physical gems. There is also a spot with barrels full of gems that guests spin to create reflective animations of the Seven Dwarfs on the ceiling. If all of the dwarfs are present on the ceiling, an animation of Snow White appears in the middle of the Dwarfs' animations. Finally there are the \\"musical spigots,\\" a gem washing station with wooden taps carved to woodland animals. There are 12 spigots each representing a note on the chromatic scale. =Attraction= D23 Expo in 2011 The ride travels both indoors and outdoors, similar to Frontierland's major attractions, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and Splash Mountain. Unlike roller coasters such as the Incredicoaster and Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith, this attraction is designed to appeal to a family-oriented crowd with enchanting scenery and cartoonish architecture; it retains details from the original 1937 film. The attraction features a new ride system of a \\"tilting vehicle\\". This new technology simulates the swaying and tipping one would expect to experience in a mine cart. Songs from the film, such as Heigh-Ho, are featured in the attraction. Most of the Audio- Animatronics, including the Dwarf figures of Doc, Happy, Sleepy, Grumpy, and Bashful performing their Yodel Song in the final scene, are recycled from the demolished Snow White's Scary Adventures attraction. Additionally, the vulture figures from the previous attraction ride are perched on a mining structure early in the ride. Many of the figures within the cave are new designs from the animation team, with the most important and recognizable contribution being Doc's high range of motion, two-degree-of-freedom wrist. The ride features two on-ride cameras that provide videos and pictures for guests to buy through Disney's PhotoPass, which it began doing on September 18, 2014. It is one of only two Walt Disney World attraction to provide videos for guests, the other being The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. Unlike the rest of the attractions at Walt Disney World with on-ride cameras (with the exception of Frozen Ever After and Slinky Dog Dash), there are no monitors to view the ride pictures and, instead, they are automatically added to a guest's My Disney Experience account via RFID in the guest's MagicBand linked to the account, if riding with one on their wrist. The ride layouts are the same in the Florida and Shanghai versions of the ride. The major differences between the two are that the Shanghai version has all its songs in Mandarin instead of English, and does not have Snow White dancing in the house with the dwarfs next to the final brake run. Incidents On November 1, 2014, falling embers from Wishes fireworks show landed on the fake grass exterior of the ride, causing a fire near the bridge that the coaster travels on just before entering the mine. This caused the ride and the area around it to be evacuated. The fire was first reported around 10:20 p.m. Reedy Creek Fire Department responded and extinguished the fire within minutes, according to eyewitnesses. By 11 p.m., multiple eyewitnesses said the fire was out. There were no injuries reported. The area around it reopened later that night and the ride reopened at 12:30 p.m. the following afternoon.

Abnormal behavior of birds in captivity has been found to occur among both domesticated and wild birds. Abnormal behavior can be defined in several ways. Statistically, 'abnormal' is when the occurrence, frequency or intensity of a behaviour varies statistically significantly, either more or less, from the normal value. This means that theoretically, almost any behaviour could become 'abnormal' in an individual. Less formally, 'abnormal' includes any activity judged to be outside the normal behaviour pattern for captive birds of that particular class or age. For example, running rather than flying may be a normal behaviour and regularly observed in one species, however, in another species it might be normal but becomes 'abnormal' if it reaches a high frequency, or in another species it is rarely observed and any incidence is considered 'abnormal'. This article does not include 'one-off' behaviours performed by individual birds that might be considered abnormal for that individual, unless these are performed repeatedly by other individuals in the species and are recognised as part of the ethogram of that species. Most abnormal behaviours can be categorised collectively (e.g., eliminative, ingestive, stereotypies), however, many abnormal behaviours fall debatebly into several of these categories and categorisation is therefore not attempted in this article. Abnormal behaviours here are considered to be related to captive housing but may also be due to medical conditions. The article does not include behaviours in birds that are genetically modified to express abnormal behaviour. Behaviors When housed under captive or commercial conditions, birds often show a range of abnormal behaviours. These are often self-injurious or harmful to other individuals, and can include feather and toe pecking, cannibalism, stereotypy, vent pecking, as well as abnormal sexual behaviours such as chronic egg laying. =Feather and toe pecking= Feather pecking is an abnormal behaviour observed in birds in captivity (primarily in laying hens) whereby one bird repeatedly pecks the feathers of another. Toe pecking is a similar occurrence in commercialized hens which includes repeatedly pecking the toes of another. Each of these behaviours have been tied to physiological stress (i.e., extremely enlarged adrenal glands) likely caused by housing conditions in captivity.Huber-Eicher, B. and Sebo, F., (2001). The prevalence of feather pecking and development in commercial flocks of laying hens. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 74: 223‚Äì231Sherwin, C.M., Richards, G.J and Nicol, C.J., (2010). A comparison of the welfare of layer hens in four housing systems in the UK. British Poultry Science, 51(4): 488-499 =Cannibalism= Cannibalism in birds of captivity is a behaviour often linked to feather pecking. With increasing frequency and intensity of feather pecking, the risk and prevalence of cannibalism increases. Since feather pecking leads to increased food consumption due to heat loss through the skin of the bird, and feather pecking is an already aggressive behaviour that consists of cannibalistic qualities, cannibalism is a common consequential effect. Cannibalism is defined as the act of consuming all or part of another individual of the same species as food.Savory, J., (2010). Nutrition, feeding and drinking behaviour, and welfare.

Selection method and early-life history affect behavioural development, feather pecking and cannibalism in laying hens: A review. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 110: 217-228 =Stereotypy= Stereotypies are invariant, repetitive behaviour patterns with no blatant function or objective, and seem to be restricted to captive and/or mentally-impaired animals. Stereotypies are the result of inability of an animal to perform a normal behaviour due to external environmental conditions or circumstance. A common stereotypy in laying hens is pacing which involves the animal constantly walking back and forth in a seemingly ritualistic manner due to no access to a suitable nest site. The pacing stereotypy is also hypothesized to arise from intentional movements of escape, specifically in captive animals such as birds. The overabundance as well as lack of stimulation associated with the sub-optimal environment of captivity are the common factors amongst development of stereotypy behaviours in birds. =Vent pecking= Vent pecking is an abnormal behaviour observed in birds in captivity that involves pecking and causing damage to the cloaca, its surrounding skin, and underlying tissue of another bird. Occurrence of vent pecking is primarily immediately after a bird has oviposited when the cloaca is red and enlarged. Vent pecking, like feather pecking, is a gateway behaviour to cannibalism due to its cannibalistic features of hostility towards another individual that involves the aggressive tearing and damaging of the skin and tissue. Vent cannibalism was found to be the most common type of cannibalism causing death in autopsy results of laying hens.Sherwin, C.M., (2010).

(1985). Abnormal behavior in farm animals: ethological implications. Netherlands Journal of Zoology, 35, 279-299. Birds raised in pet stores tend to be raised with other birds, however, after being sold and taken to the owner's home, birds in captivity are often housed in isolation and in environments lacking abundant resources or complex stimuli. In the United States, it is estimated that forty million birds are kept caged and improperly cared for.‚ÄúThere is no such thing as a cage bird‚Äù. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Because of these inappropriate housing conditions, abnormal behaviour patterns may appear in caged birds kept as pets. Once established, these abnormal behaviours in birds are often not alterable.Ten Cate, C. (1995). Behavioral development in birds and the implications of imprinting and song learning for captive propagation. Research and Captive Propagation, 187-197. When social interactions amongst birds are absent or inadequate, abnormal social behaviour may develop. For example, a study regarding parrots that had been isolated in cages demonstrated that most birds showing this social deprivation had significant behavioural disturbances, such as aggressive behaviour, feather picking, self-mutilation, restlessness, screaming, apathetic behavior, and stereotypies.Lantermann, W. (1993). Social deprivation in Amazon parrots. Animal Behaviour, 38, 511-520. Cannibalism often occurs in large animal husbandry systems, which are usually impoverished environments with a lack of opportunities.Hughes, B.O. & Duncan, I.J.H. (1998). The notion of ethological ‚Äúneed,‚Äù models of motivation and animal welfare. Animal Behaviour, 36, 1696-1707. In addition, studies of caged canaries have revealed two common stereotypies. These include spot picking, where birds repeatedly touch a particular spot in the environment with the tip of their beak, and route tracing, a pacing behaviour associated with physical restrictions in movement imposed by the cage. The absence of song learning in zebra finches has also been implicated as a behavioural abnormality.Slater, P.J, B., Jones, A. & Ten Cate, C. (1993). Can lack of experience delay the end of the sensitive phase for song learning? Netherlands Journal of Zoology, 43, 80-90. In these birds, the social interaction of a young male with his song tutor is important for normal song development. Without the stimulus, the song, which is necessary for mating behavior, will not be learned. Researchers have analyzed ways to alleviate some abnormal behaviours in caged birds. Presenting these birds with novel stimuli e.g. a mirror or plastic birds, and social stimuli, such as a brief view of a bird in another cage, significantly reduced stereotypies.Keiper, R.R. (1970). Studies of stereotypy function in the canary (Serinus canarius). Animal Behaviour, 18, 353-357. In addition, it has been suggested that keeping caged birds in pairs or small groups may reduce the development of abnormal behaviours, however, little quantitative evidence has thus far been collected to support this claim. In addition to the abnormal behaviours exhibited as a result of commercialized captivity such as for poultry, there also exist problematic behaviours that occur as a function of the social deprivation associated with domestication. Social deprivation is the prevention or reduction of normal interaction between an individual and others in their species. Currently the dominant method for rearing domesticated birds is \\"hand-rearing\\" which requires chicks be separated from their parents for periods of time up to several months. The social deprivation associated with this technique of upbringing is one of the most detrimental forms of social deprivation since even short-term disruptions in parental care can cause extreme abnormal behaviour in the affected young. For example, normal sexual and habitat imprinting is altered in both male and female birds as a result of maternal separation, as well as individual ability to adapt to stressors within the environment. Neophobia is the avoidance of novel objects in the environment and is diminished with social deprivation and maternal separation. A lack of neophobia can decrease probability of survival due to the affected animal's lack of hesitation to approach potentially dangerous stimuli. Moreover, many juveniles require a song tutor to accomplish the song learning necessary for successful mating practices. Therefore, socially deprived juveniles may exhibit abnormal vocal and consequent mating behaviours which may be detrimental to their survival. It is important to note that once established, these abnormal behaviours are often not transformable. There is presently little research regarding a solution to the abnormality caused by captivity in birds; however, it has been suggested that keeping domesticated caged birds in small groups or pairs may reduce the likelihood of developing abnormal behaviours.

The transport of peptides into cells is a well-documented biological phenomenon which is accomplished by specific, energy-dependent transporters found in a number of organisms as diverse as bacteria and humans. The proton-dependent oligopeptide transporter (PTR) family of proteins is distinct from the ABC-type peptide transporters and was uncovered by sequence analyses of a number of recently discovered peptide transport proteins.

Adding an annular fin to an object increases the amount of surface area in contact with the surrounding fluid, which increases the convective heat transfer between the object and surrounding fluid. Because surface area increases as length from the object increases, an annular fin transfers more heat than a similar pin fin at any given length. Annular fins are often used to increase the heat exchange in liquid‚Äìgas heat exchanger systems.  Governing Equation  right To derive the governing equation of an annular fin, certain assumptions must be made. The fin must have constant thermal conductivity and other material properties, there must be no internal heat generation, there must be only one- dimensional conduction, and the fin must be at steady state.

T represents the temperature at r and Te represents the temperature of the surrounding fluid. Next, applying Fourier's law :q = -k frac{partial T}{partial r} and dividing by 4œÄŒîr, letting Œîr ‚Üí 0, yields : frac{partial}{partial r} left( r, frac{partial T}{partial r} right)  h_c, r, frac{T - T_e}{k, t} =0.

Definition  The total canonical partition function Z of a system of N identical, indistinguishable, noninteracting atoms or molecules can be divided into the atomic or molecular partition functions zeta Donald A. McQuarrie, Statistical Mechanics, Harper & Row, 1973 : Z = frac{ zeta^N }{ N! } with : zeta = sum_j g_j e^{ -E_j / k_B T} , where g_j is the degeneracy of the jth quantum level of an individual particle, k_B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature of system. For molecules, under the assumption that total energy levels E_j can be partitioned into its contributions from different degrees of freedom (weakly coupled degrees of freedom)Donald A. McQuarrie, ibid : E_j = sum_i E_j^{i} =E_j^{trans}+ E_j^{ns}+ E_j^{rot}+E_j^{vib}+E_j^{e} and the number of degenerate states are given as products of the single contributions : g_j =prod_i g_j^i =g_j^{trans} g_j^{ns} g_j^{rot}g_j^{vib}g_j^{e}, where \\"trans\\", \\"ns\\", \\"rot\\", \\"vib\\" and \\"e\\" denotes translational, nuclear spin, rotational and vibrational contributions as well as electron excitation, the molecular partition functions : zeta=sum_j g_j e^{-E_j/k_B T} can be written as a product itself : zeta =prod_i zeta^i =zeta^{trans} zeta^{ns} zeta^{rot}zeta^{vib}zeta^{e}.  Linear molecules  Rotational energies are quantized. For a diatomic molecule like CO or HCl or a linear polyatomic molecule like OCS in its ground vibrational state, the allowed rotational energies in the rigid rotor approximation are : E_J^{rot}=frac{mathbf{J}^2}{2I}=frac{J(J+1)hbar^2}{2I}=J(J+1)B. J is the quantum number for total rotational angular momentum and takes all integer values starting at zero,i.e. J = 0,1,2,ldots ,, B = frac{hbar^2}{2I} is the rotational constant, and I is the moment of inertia. Here we are using B in energy units. If it is expressed in frequency units, replace B by hB in all the expression that follow, where h is Planck's constant. If B is given in units of cm^{-1} , then replace B by hcB where c is the speed of light in vacuum. For each value of J, we have rotational degeneracy, g_j = (2J+1), so the rotational partition function is therefore : zeta^{rot}=sum_{J=0}^{infty}g_je^{-E_J/k_B T}=sum_{J=0}^{infty}(2J+1)e^{-J(J+1) B /k_B T}. For all but the lightest molecules or the very lowest temperatures we have B << k_B T . This suggests we can approximate the sum by replacing the sum over J by an integral of J treated as a continuous variable. : zeta^{rot} approx int_0^{infty} (2J+1)e^{-J(J+1) B /k_B T} dJ = frac{ k_B T}{B} . This approximation is known as the high temperature limit. It is also called the classical approximation as this is the result for the canonical partition function for a classical rigid rod. Using the Euler‚ÄìMaclaurin formula an improved estimate can be foundG. Herzberg, Infrared and Raman Spectra, Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1945, Equation (V,21) : zeta^{rot} = frac{ k_B T}{B} + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{15} left( frac{B}{ k_B T} right) + frac{4}{315} left( frac{B}{k_B T} right)^2 + frac{1}{315} left( frac{B}{k_B T} right)^3 ldots . For the CO molecule at T=300K, the (unit less) contribution zeta^{rot} to zeta turns out to be in the range of 10^2. The mean thermal rotational energy per molecule can now be computed by taking the derivative of zeta^{rot} with respect to temperature T. In the high temperature limit approximation, the mean thermal rotational energy of a linear rigid rotor is k_B T .  Quantum symmetry effects  For a diatomic molecule with a center of symmetry, such as rm H_2, N_2, CO_2, or rm H_2 C_2 (i.e. D_{infty h} point group), rotation of a molecule by pi radian about an axis perpendicular to the molecule axis and going through the center of mass will interchange pairs of equivalent atoms. The spin‚Äìstatistics theorem of quantum mechanics requires that the total molecular wavefunction be either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to this rotation depending upon whether an even or odd number of pairs of fermion nuclear pairs are exchanged. A given electronic & vibrational wavefunction will either be symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to this rotation. The rotational wavefunction with quantum number J will have a sign change of (-1)^J . The nuclear spins states can be separated into those that are symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the nuclear permutations produced by the rotation. For the case of a symmetric diatomic with nuclear spin quantum number I for each nucleus, there are (I+1)(2I+1) symmetric spin functions and I (2I+1) are antisymmetric functions for a total number of nuclear functions g^{ns} = (2 I + 1)^2 . Nuclei with an even nuclear mass number are bosons and have integer nuclear spin quantum number, I. Nuclei with odd mass number are fermions and had half integer I. For the case of H2, rotation exchanges a single pair of fermions and so the overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric under the half rotation. The vibration-electronic function is symmetric and so the rotation-vibration-electronic will be even or odd depending upon whether J is an even or odd integer. Since the total wavefunction must be odd, the even J levels can only use the antisymmetric functions (only one for I = 1/2) while the odd J levels can use the symmetric functions ( three for I = 1/2). For D2, I = 1 and thus there are six symmetric functions, which go with the even J levels to produce an overall symmetric wavefunction, and three antisymmetric functions that must go with odd J rotational levels to produce an overall even function. The number of nuclear spin functions that are compatible with a given rotation-vibration-electronic state is called the nuclear spin statistical weight of the level, often represented as g_J . Averaging over both even and odd J levels, the mean statistical weight is (1/2) ( 2I+1)^2 , which is one half the value of g^{ns} expected ignoring the quantum statistical restrictions. In the high temperature limit, it is traditional to correct for the missing nuclear spin states by dividing the rotational partition function by a factor sigma = 2 with sigma known as the rotational symmetry number which is 2 for linear molecules with a center of symmetry and 1 for linear molecules without. Nonlinear molecules A rigid, nonlinear molecule has rotational energy levels determined by three rotational constants, conventionally written A, B, and C , which can often be determined by rotational spectroscopy. In terms of these constants, the rotational partition function can be written in the high temperature limit as G. Herzberg, ibid, Equation (V,29) : zeta^{rot} approx frac{sqrt{pi} }{sigma} sqrt{ frac{ (k_b T)^3 }{ A B C }} with sigma again known as the rotational symmetry number G. Herzberg, ibid; see Table 140 for values for common molecular point groups which in general equals the number ways a molecule can be rotated to overlap itself in an indistinguishable way, i.e. that at most interchanges identical atoms. Like in the case of the diatomic treated explicitly above, this factor corrects for the fact that only a fraction of the nuclear spin functions can be used for any given molecular level to construct wavefunctions that overall obey the required exchange symmetries. The expression for zeta^{rot} works for asymmetric, symmetric and spherical top rotors.

By 1916 the company was considered to be among the largest shoe manufacturers in America, with sales that were nationwide and in several countries in Europe, Asia and South America.Rice & Hutchins 1917. A Retrospect 1866-1916 Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England. 54pp. The corporation was dissolved in 1929. Company history A Rice & Hutchins factory in Marlborough, Massachusetts 1902 The Rice and Hutchins Shoe Company was established in October 1866 by business partners William B. Rice as president and Horatio H. Hutchins as vice president, both of whom had experience in shoe making and sales. The company first began by selling shoes manufactured by Felton & Chipman in Marlborough, Massachusetts and other factories around New England. The company faced an early setback by the Boston Fire of 1872 in which much of its stock of shoes at their offices and warehouse at 125 Summer St. in Boston were completely destroyed. Three years later in 1875, Rice & Hutchins purchased their first factory in Marlborough, (the Felton & Chipman factory) to support their steadily increasing sales. Between 1875 and 1885, several factories were established in several New England towns and cities, including Warren, Maine; Rockland, Massachusetts; Marlborough, Massachusetts and Boston. In 1884, they established their first subsidiary distributing house outside of Boston, the Joseph I. Meaney & Company of Philadelphia. In 1885, Horatio H. Hutchins retired from the company and Rice's sons Harry Lee Rice and Fred Ball Rice assumed executive positions as vice president and secretary-treasurer of the company. The years between 1885 and 1909 were a period of great growth of the company. In addition to several new and expanded factories in Massachusetts, Maine and Yonkers, New York, several subsidiary distribution houses were established in New York City, Baltimore, Chicago, Cincinnati, St. Louis, and began international sales in 1893 with a distributorship agreement with a London wholesaler. International sales were expanded in 1903 by establishing the Rice and Hutchins subsidiary of Vera American Shoe Company in Berlin and establishing a distributorship in Manila, in the Philippines. Print advertisement from Rice & Hutchins, Inc. 1907 Rice & Hutchins offices at 20 High Street, Boston 1910 In 1892, the company was first reorganized as a corporation under the laws of New Jersey. Later in 1905, they reorganized again as a Maine corporation. Through all the reorganizations, William B. Rice remained as president of the company and corporations until his death in 1909, when his son Harry L. Rice assumed the presidency of the company. Under the leadership of Harry Rice, the company further expanded international sales in 1914 by establishing subsidiary distributors in Copenhagen, Denmark and in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The company's exhibit at the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition (1915 World's Fair) covering the history of shoes, including advertising and ephemera, complete with over 800 pairs of shoes and a notable display of \\"Educator shoes\\" for the \\"whole family\\", was awarded the medal of honor.American Exporter, Volume 77, Johnston Export Pub. Co., September, 1915, page 74. By the time of the 50th anniversary of the company in October, 1916 they were among the largest manufacturers and distributors of shoes in America. Employees of the Rice & Hutchins factory on Pearl Street in South Braintree, Massachusetts became witnesses in the murder and robbery of Frederick Parmenter, a paymaster, and Alessandro Berardelli, a security guard, coming from the adjacent Slater & Morrill factory on April 15, 1920. The murder occurred on the street directly in front of the Rice & Hutchins factory. Italian immigrants Sacco and Vanzetti were arrested for the crime and convicted based in part by the employees' testimony in the highly publicized trial.Musmanno, Michael A. 1961. The Sacco-Vanzetti Case: A Miscarriage of Justice. American Bar Association Journal 47:28-35. The company continued in operation through most of the 1920s, but it was sold and the corporation was eventually dissolved by the Rice brothers (Harry & Fred) in 1929, as both were looking to retire from the business.

Brady served with that regiment until 1863, when he was promoted to colonel of the 140th Indiana Infantry Regiment. He was promoted to brevet brigadier general just before the end of the war, in March 1865, in recognition of his \\"long and meritorious service.\\" During the war, in 1864, Brady was married to Emeline Wolfe. They would have three children: Arthur, Elizabeth, and Winfield.  Political career  After the war, Brady resumed his law practice in Muncie, forming a partnership with Arthur C. Mellette. Brady also purchased the Muncie Weekly Times in 1868. In 1870, he was appointed consul to St. Thomas, then a part of the Danish Virgin Islands, where he served until 1875. He was appointed commissioner of internal revenue for Ohio and Indiana that year. The following year, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Brady second assistant postmaster-general. In his position with the postal service, Brady became embroiled in the star route scandal. Brady was alleged to have illegally profited in a scheme in which postal officials received bribes in exchange for awarding postal delivery contracts in southern and western areas. President Rutherford B. Hayes sustained Brady in office, but he resigned in 1881. Brady was indicted for conspiracy to defraud the government in 1882. A jury found him guilty, but the judge set aside the verdict. At a second trial the following year, Brady and his co-defendants were found not guilty. Brady moved to Jersey City, New Jersey, where his son, Arthur, was president of the Union Traction Company. He died there in 1904.

Company advertisements explained the pronunciation of the name as \\"Say Peginaw.\\" Varkaris, J. and C., The Pequegnat Story: the Family and the Clocks, Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company, Dubuque, Iowa 1982, p.100 The family of Arthur Pequegnat immigrated from Switzerland in 1874, and initially started a business of importing watches for the local market in Berlin (now Kitchener, Ontario). By 1897, the family started bicycle production, but switched their focus to clock movements in 1904, and later started making their own cases. By 1941, the demands of World War II armament makers for brass, the essential ingredient in clock movements, pressed the company to stop production. The company distinguished itself as a competitor for some of the better American pendulum clocks, such as those made by Seth Thomas. Their clocks often looked like models made by Seth Thomas or Sessions but some of their designs, especially the tall mantle clocks, were unique. For their wooden cases, they favored the heart wood of quarter-sawn white oak that showed off beautiful ray flecks. The designs often had elements of the Arts and Crafts Movement which also favored quarter-sawn white oak. Most of their model names were based on Canadian cities. According to the Canadian Clock Museum, ‚Äúapproximately sixty-five cataloged models of mantel clock are known, as well as sixteen models of wall clock (with variations) and seven models of grandfather (hall) clock.‚Äù Canadian Clock Museum Rare samples exist of Pequegnat clocks built into a sideboard, or a grandfather clock/gramophone combination. Pequegnat was also instrumental in the production of parts for the Franco-American Clock Company whose clocks mimicked the German box or Vienna regulators. Today, their clocks are highly collectible in Canada and command twice the price of similarly styled clocks by well-known American counterparts. One of the aspects that interests collectors is the high number of variants. Collectors can hunt for time-only, time and strike, or either of these with calendar. The company seemed to start a run with one style of trim but then would complete the run with a different style, so that it is not uncommon to find a unique sample that no one else has.

The game was set in a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, overrun by the zombie apocalypse. Players were tasked with commanding, sustaining, and protecting one or more squads of survivors as they roamed the deserted streets and fought for survival. Players assumed the role of an operative taking a satellite view of the situation, and radioing in orders akin to classic early 1990s of the National Emergency Control and Relief Agency (NECRA), a government agency tasked with rebuilding civilization. Players couldn't control the survivors individually, but instead used squad- level controls to accomplish objectives. The game had player vs. player PvP, Faction gameplay and player vs. environment PvE elements. WoTLD: Resurrection ran its first round of Closed Beta Testing in October 2013. The second test began in December 2013, with the game being released to the public on 21 February 2014. WoTLD: Resurrection announced its permanent shutdown on 23 June 2014. In 2016, the heading of the official website changed to 'World of the Living Dead book coming in 2016' along with the website name to 'World of the Living Dead - Do you love reading about zombies?'. Gameplay The interface of WoTLD made use of OpenStreetMap and was set in a post-Apocalyptic Los Angeles . Much of the gameplay consisted of moving around the game world, a grid made up of 500m x 500m squares with occasional skirmishes with the zombies and the injuries that occur from such battles. In each zone, players had options to engage \\"zeds\\" scavenge for items, engage opponents, collect research samples or construct safehouses. There were several thousand locations on the map, once a player had moved his/her team onto these locations several actions became available. These actions ranged from scavenging the zone for resources to tagging the walls to mark your passing. Squads were marked with small icons on the map, and opposing players, as well as notable buildings are scattered around the map. Movement consisted of moving through the game world step by step. Combat was not \\"seen\\" first-hand, instead popping up as a series of combat reports, detailing any injuries, kills and/or deaths. As your characters progress, fear, and fatigue start to take its toll, making your survivors less efficient. With a complex system of needs, food and water became critical resources in the game and players had to manage hunger and thirst. After passing a certain number of days at maximum thirst or hunger, survivors would go AWOL, moving to a random location on the map, from which they needed to be recovered by the player. Hunger and dehydration would also hinder the survivor's performance, slowing him/her down in combat, making them an easier target. Thus, every expedition had to be carefully planned before ordering your people to leave the relative safety of your safehouse. Players who returned between gameplay sessions to their safehouse would see their health recover, and fear and fatigue drop, and these could be sped up through development of the appropriate skills. Instead of defining hordes as specific beings, or even as a number, WoTLD used a unique definition of \\"z-density\\", defining the density of zombies within a block instead of the actual zombie count. Level of density is defined by a scale of colors, providing a better visual at a first glance. Development World of the Living Dead: Resurrection was developed by Irish indie games developer Ballardia, which consisted of Dave Barton and Kulpreet Singh. Dave and Kulpreet were both senior development staff at pre-GameStop Jolt Online, then known as OMAC Industries, founded by Dylan Collins, a successful Irish games and technology entrepreneur. He had previously sold Demonware, to Activision, and secured a license to develop a game base on the Zork series. Dave Barton was Lead Designer for Legends of Zork, and Kulpreet was CTO, and Lead Developer on NationStates 2. WoTLD was originally conceived by Dave Barton in 2007. Development began in mid-2009 with the help of Kulpreet Singh. Open beta was originally planned for December 2010, and featured a game engine that incorporated Google Maps. It went into Closed Beta in late 2010, and Open Beta in 2012. However, the developers encountered a severe problem as the Google Maps API, which the game was built around, could not handle large numbers of concurrent players. This meant that the game, which was built around moving through the game's landscape, reacting in real time to noise and other players, did not scale well. Development of all the gameplay elements continued, and the game continued to receive updates until May 2013 when it was announced to be shutting down the following month, allowing the developers to bring the game forward on the new OpenStreetMap system. In June 2014, servers closed, allowing the developers to refocus all efforts to rerelease the game as World of the Living Dead: Resurrection. In early 2013 the developers chose OpenStreetMap as a replacement. The first phase of Closed Beta Testing began on 10 October 2013 with over 300 testers, which ended in late November 2013 after initial bug fixes were rapidly deployed, and rebalancing of all metrics tweaked regularly. This shut down in November 2013, allowing the developers some time to address many issues, and re-boot the game to run a full cycle of the game, based on achieving a Faction-based end-game goal of researching a solution to the Zombocolypse. The second round of Closed Beta Testing began on 1 December 2013, and ended on 21 February 2014, with the removal of the beta key requirement, a rebalancing of the cooldowns to allow regular solo sessions throughout the day, and updates to allow single players to win the game. The developer have promised a Championship Trophy, which will be webcast, and the winner(s) will have their name engraved on the trophy as Round 1 Winners.

The refuge's boundaries encompass parts of McHenry County, Illinois, and Walworth County, Wisconsin. The refuge will be operated by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, known as USFWS.Staff, \\"NewsFront: Hackmatack National Wildlife Refuge\\", Outdoor Illinois XIX:12 (December 2011), pages 20-21. 85 percent of the refuge will be in Illinois, and 15 percent in Wisconsin. The refuge will cover 11,200 acres of land in Illinois and Wisconsin, which will complement 23,000 acres already acquired for public use or under environmental protection as of 2011. Existing parklands adjacent to the proposed refuge's boundaries include several McHenry County Conservation District areas. The name Hackmatack is an Algonquin term for the American tamarack or Larix laricina, a conifer formerly abundant in regional wetlands. Hackmatack was the word used by many language groups in the Algonquin language group, including the Potawatomi, the tribe that most intensively utilized this ecosystem at the time this area was first mapped in the 17th and 18th centuries. 109 separate threatened or endangered species, including 49 species of birds, are listed within the area being studied for the proposed refuge designation. Examples of endangered fauna that find a home within the boundaries of the proposed refuge include the Blanding's turtle. History The Hackmatack wetlands were a traditional home to the Potawatomi tribe of Native Americans of the United States, who utilized them for fishing, waterfowl hunting, and the gathering of plants used as food and medicine. During the rapid population growth of the 20th century, many of the wetlands within the Hackmatack ecosystem were drained and altered for residential development, while others, such as Volo Bog State Natural Area near Fox Lake, Illinois, were preserved. =Current status= In October 2010, USFWS held four meetings, two each in Illinois and Wisconsin, to discuss plans for the proposed refuge. In addition, the USFWS continued to accept public comments on the proposed refuge into 2011. The USFWS stated that they expected to release a draft environmental assessment of the proposal in late spring 2011. Following this comment procedure, the USFWS designated the proposed refuge for approval in August 2012. The refuge will not be officially established until legal interest in lands are acquired, through purchase or donation. The legal interest may encompass anything from fee simple ownership to conservation easement. Purchase of land interest is dependent upon congressional approval and appropriation of funds. Lands in Lake County, Illinois, Kenosha County, Wisconsin, and Racine County, Wisconsin were considered for inclusion in the new refuge, but were left outside its boundaries in the August 2012 announcement. The State of Illinois announced acquisition of the first parcel land designated for inclusion in the new refuge, a 72-acre plot in northern McHenry County, in February 2013. The acquisition was made for $511,000. Acquisition of the land by a public-sector body triggered the completion of the legal act of creating the new refuge.Chris Young, \\"State buys recreation land for $2.8 million\\", (Springfield, Ill.)

McCormick was interested in applying the ideas he'd had producing electronic music, particularly with regards to structure, to the guitar based music that Harris was coming up with. McCormick had also been profoundly influenced by his experiences making fully improvised music with San Francisco band Whirr. They enlisted bassist Matheson (whose former band had once opened for Kiss) and began experimentation in an artist basement subspace in the Lower Haight. Their neighbor in the subspace, Swedish-native Bjorkbom, had recently given up experimenting hooking up machines to make trance music, and decided to go full tilt back into playing jazz drums. McCormick managed to convince him that he could approach this band's music like jazz. Tucker joined the band after overhearing a phone conversation on the street between McCormick and Harris about needing to find a cellist. That first year they recorded their first demo, resulting in one track which later got released: Steam. Their first public performance was at the Connecticut Yankee in San Francisco in November 2005. Both Australians, Harris and McCormick moved to Melbourne at the end of 2005, but decided to try to keep the band going regardless of geography. They returned to the USA in May 2006 to tour on the West Coast, as well as record their first album, Signs of Life, at Tiny Telephone, San Francisco over 3 days. Post-production was carried out by Harris and McCormick themselves upon return to their Logicpole studio in Melbourne. The album was released in December 2007 via Logicpole. The original lineup came apart after when Bjorkbom and Matheson had issues preventing them traveling to Europe where the band was booked to play. McCormick asked his longtime friend Murray to play bass who enlisted drummer Ardziejewski (pronounced \\"RJFski\\") to join the band. The band toured the USA in August 2008 with this new lineup and then recorded their second album, Invisible Origins, in Portland, Oregon at Klickitat Studios during April 2009. In addition to their usual instrumentation, they incorporated acoustic instruments like piano, vibraphone and trumpet, as well as considerable computer generated/processed sound. Although the mixing was completed by the end of 2009, it took them all of 2010 to select material and complete Invisible Origins. The album was released in February 2011. In November 2011 the People Start Listening EP was released, which saw the band move deeper into ambient and electronic territory.http://www.popstache.com/album-review/beaten-by-them-people-start- listeninghttp://www.thrilljockey.com/thrill/Beaten-by-Them/People-Start- Listening Beaten by Them's fourth album Kinder Machines, which was recorded and mixed by Oz Fritz, was released in October 2012.

The Monkey Quest: Thunderbow app was also removed from the App Store on July 31, 2014. Story The player's monkey entered the land of Ook. The player was then able to travel around and meet new inhabitants of the virtual world. The player needed to complete multiple quests along the way. They could meet friends, buy new objects, visit the Mayor Bumbee, battle monsters and much more. As the user played, their monkey unlocked more lands, discovered more about the legendary Monkey King, and could even become the leader of a tribe.MMOgameingsite Review of Monkey Quest. Website. Retrieved on 2009-03-19 Tribes There were five monkey tribes available: * The Chim Foo * The Sea Dragons * The Ootu Mystics * The Ice Raiders And the fifth and final tribe, the Mek-Tek (Mechanical Technology). This tribe was never playable as the game was shut down before it was released. Quests There were a large number of Quests available throughout the game. There were 4 different kinds of Main Quests could only be done once by every player. As the player leveled up their character, main quests would become more difficult to complete. =Daily Quests= Daily Quests could be done once a day by any player, regardless of their current level. =Side Quests= Side Quests - Quests that could be done in addition to the other quest types. =Multiplayer Quests= Quests that required 2 or more players. Most of these only required 2, but some required 3 players. A Pet could also help in these quests. Stages There were 5 kinds of Quests in Monkey Quest. Each type depended on which section of Ook the player is in. * Mek-Tek (Mechanical Technology), was never available to begin with, due to the fact that the game was shut down before it was ever released. * Sea Dragons * Ootu Mystics * Chim Foo * Ice Raiders Due to an update, all players (non-members and members) could access trails. This followed the deletion of NC Trail Keys and Guest Passes. Gameplay =Controls= To explore the worlds of Ook, players used the arrow keys on their keyboard. Jumping was controlled by pressing the space bar and pressing the arrow keys whilst jumping allowed the player to jump in that direction. Pressing the space bar then the down arrow whilst in midair made the character do a dive bomb towards the ground. The player could also press either the CTRL key or the X key on their keyboard whilst facing an in-game NPC to either access new quests or obtain various information about Ook and its residents. The game had five equippable hot keys (C, V, B, N, and M) to control weapons, potions, pets and any other items players wished to access quickly. =Currency= There were two types of currency in Monkey Quest. The main type of currency was bananas, which were commonly earned from quests and could be used at a vendor to buy items, whilst the other currency, NC (Nick Cash) could be bought with real money or could be earned by leveling up and could be used to buy items from the NC mall which was located at the bottom right corner of the screen in Monkey Quest. =Membership= There were membership plans that allow players to pay real life money for special features in the game such as access to all trails, the ability to join each tribe, along with accessing certain areas only available to paid members. Possibility of a film adaptation In August 2012, Variety reported that Paramount Animation (which like Nickelodeon is owned by Viacom) was in the process of starting development of several animated movies with budgets of around US$100 million. According to Variety, the intellectual property for these films, which is to be supplied by Nickelodeon among others, included Monkey Quest. Closure On August 14, 2014, Nickelodeon announced that after 4 years of operation, Monkey Quest was being shut down permanently on September 26, 2014. Subsequently, every player was given membership for the remaining time of the game. Players were offered refunds for their memberships if they contacted Nickelodeon within a given time before the game shut down. The website was also updated with a closing message on the index page. The Monkey Quest website did not close until January 30, 2016. The game remained open for a month after the announcement, finally closing on the set date, September 26, 2014.

It is a member of the fungal complex called the guava rust (Puccinia psidii) group. The spores have a distinctive yellow to orange colour, occasionally encircled by a purple ring. They are found on lesions on new growth including shoots, leaves, buds and fruits. Leaves become twisted and may die. Infections in highly susceptible species may result in the death of the host plant. As of late 2013, it is infecting around 179 species in New South Wales and Queensland, from 41 genera (around 46% of genera in the Myrtaceae) in Australia. Taxonomy The fungus was first described scientifically in 1884 as Puccinia psidii by G. Winter, then described again in 2006 as Uredo rangelii by mycologists J.A. Simpson, K. Thomas, and Cheryl Grgurinovic. Finally in 2017 the names were synonymised by Beenken in a new genus as Austropuccinia psidii. Development and symptoms Myrtle rust is typically characterised by the appearance of urediniospores on the underside of the leaf, though urediniospores may also be found on the top of the leaf or on young stems. Initially, the disease appears as small purple or red brown flecks with a faint chlorotic halo on the leaf surface, which coalesce to form bright yellow pustules. As the rust develops, these pustules often fade to a grey brown colour. A high degree of pustule coalescence can result in distortion of the leaf. Myrtle rust also makes plants more susceptible to secondary infections, which may occur within days of the initial appearance of the pustules. Favourable conditions that increase the infection rate include: new tissue; high humidity; free water on plant surface for more than 6 hours; moderate temperatures, around 15‚Äì25 ¬∞C. Low light conditions (minimum of 8 hours) after spore contact can increase germination. The main ways in which myrtle rust can be spread are by: the movement of infected plant material, the movement of contaminated equipment, wind, water and gravity, animals, humans and/or vehicles. Myrtle rust may remain on a single host plant to complete its life cycle, which can be as short as 10‚Äì14 days. As an invasive species Puccinia psidii can have very serious consequences to various species of plants in the Myrtaceae. This family includes guava (the original host of this rust in Brazil), eucalyptus, melaleuca, and a number of species native to Hawaii, including some endemic species (found nowhere else on Earth) and at least one important native forest tree. There are numerous strains of the Puccinia psidii rust‚Äîsome known to be established in Florida, and at least one reported from California and there is concern that strains may exist or develop that could be devastating to  ª≈çhi ªa (Metrosideros polymorpha), one of Hawaii's dominant native trees, a foundation species for many remaining Hawaiian native ecosystems. However currently, the major threat of Puccinia in Hawaii is the massive damage it is doing to Eugenia koolauensis, a federally listed endangered species. Myrtle rust was first recorded in Australia in mid-2010 and currently poses a major threat to the continent's ecosystem given that almost 80 per cent of Australian native trees are Mytraceae, most indigenous species rely on healthy trees for their survival. Additionally it poses a major threat to Australia's primary industry sector. Its current range includes much of the eastern coastal fringe of the Australian mainland. Initial detection was in April 2010 in Gosford in the Central Coast region of New South Wales. It was initially quarantined and eradication thought viable. The New South Wales government spent $5 million attempting to eradicate the disease. However, efforts to contain it failed and it spread rapidly north and south along the eastern coast. In response to the increasing threat, a Myrtle Rust National Management Group was formed on 2 July 2010 with the aim of eradication however due to the extent of its spread at that point of time, the group conceded that it had become impossible to eradicate. By December 2010, it had significantly spread north along the coast and recorded in South East Queensland with isolated cases in Far North Queensland cities of Cairns and Townsville. In January 2012, an isolated myrtle rust outbreak was reported in Victoria beginning in Melbourne's southern and eastern suburbs. Initial attempts to contain it were unsuccessful and by April, 2012 it had spread across much of the state via regional cities. By late 2015 myrtle rust was widespread in Queensland, NSW and Victoria. It has reached Tasmania, where it was detected in garden plants in the north-east in February 2015, and the Northern Territory, where it was detected on Melville Island in May 2015. The Tasmanian government is seeking to contain and eradicate myrtle rust from the state while the Northern Territory government has determined it is not possible to contain or eradicate the pathogen. In April 2017, New Zealand's Ministry for Primary Industries reported that myrtle rust had been detected on Raoul Island, off the New Zealand mainland; the following month, myrtle rust was detected within New Zealand itself, in Kerikeri. Host genera Species within the following plant genera have been recorded with the infection: *Acmena *Agonis *Angophora *Asteromyrtus *Austromyrtus *Backhousia *Callistemon *Chamelaucium *Choricarpia *Decaspermum *Eucalyptus *Eugenia *Gossia *Lenwebbia *Leptospermum *Lophomyrtus *Melaleuca *Metrosideros *Myrtus *Pilidiostigma *Rhodamnia *Rhodomyrtus *Ristantia *Stockwellia *Syncarpia *Syzygium *Tristania *Ugni *Uromyrtus *Waterhousea *Xanthostemon Environmental impacts Since first being detected in 2010, myrtle rust has spread rapidly with entire plant species now under threat. In Australia, the family Myrtaceae - which includes eucalypts, melaleuca and lilly pilly - is diverse, widespread and important to many native ecosystems.Carnegie, AJ Amrit Kathuria, Geoff S. Pegg, Peter Entwistle, Matthew Nagel, Fiona Giblin, 2015. Environmental impact of the invasive rust Puccinia psidii on Australian native Myrtaceae. Biological Invasions DOI 10.1007/s10530-015-0996-y ‚Äì; retrieved 2017-03-28 The impact of myrtle rust has now been seen in a range of forest ecosystems including coastal heath, coastal and river wetlands, sand island ecosystems and subtropical and tropical rainforests. A number of plant species are now at risk of becoming extinct with about 40 plant species considered highly susceptible, such as the endangered Rhodamnia angustifolia. Native animals are also likely to suffer significant impacts. Myrtle rust grows in shoots, fruits and flowers, destroying the food relied on by some species of flying foxes, lorikeets and honey eaters. There is the strong possibility that some of these species will become regionally extinct, and their loss could have serious flow-on effects. Management The original plan to eradicate myrtle rust from Australia was declared to be infeasible by the Myrtle Rust National Management Group in December 2010. The Myrtle Rust Response Plan was cancelled and focus was placed on minimising the spread and the impacts on myrtle rust. The Australian Government, through the Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry, established the Myrtle Rust Coordination Group to manage the investment of $1.5 million of research funding. In 2016, The National Environmental Science Programme (http://www.environment.gov.au/science/nesp) hosted a national workshop on myrtle rust to discuss research findings and future management options. Participants included the Cooperative Research Centre for Plant Biosecurity, state and federal agencies, and botanical and plant conservation experts. Discussions centred around the impact on native species in Australia. A key outcome of the workshop included agreement that there is a need for a nationally coordinated approach through a long-term National Action Plan which aims to ensure that no species or ecosystems are lost to its impact. Practical measures to minimise the risk of increasing the distribution of myrtle rust include: not moving plant matter from one site to another; minimising pathogen spread by arriving and leaving each site clean of the pathogen, and avoiding areas that may contain myrtle rust-infected plant matter.

It was an important conduit for the shipping of supplies from Fort Whipple in Prescott to Fort McDowell on what is today the Yavapai Reservation near Fountain Hills. History The Black Mountain in Cave CreekRuins along the Stoneman Mountain Trail. Established in 1865, Fort McDowell was continuously short on supplies and before the Stoneman Road was established, the shortages were especially acute as the connection between the forts required a long route that swung south through Phoenix and north to Prescott. With the establishment of the Stoneman Road, a day‚Äôs ride was eliminated from the trip. The new route was named after forty-eight-year-old Colonel George Stoneman, a Civil War veteran and career Army man by way of West Point. He was assigned to Arizona in May, 1870 and although he was relieved of his Arizona duties one year later, his establishment of the road between Fort McDowell and Fort Whipple was a major accomplishment of his brief command. Stoneman was a trailblazer and sought a way to Prescott that would avoid the southern route. He found his route by following an old Indian trail that covered part of the distance. The trail was widened into a rocky road that led northwest from Fort McDowell through what is now McDowell Mountain Regional Park, and passed to the north of Pinnacle Peak. It‚Äôs believed that soldiers may have camped in the area which is now near 136th Street and Rio Verde Drive.Arizona RepublicTwo TownsSonoran News The road then passed near what would later become Brown‚Äôs Ranch and eventually touched the eastern boundary of the area where The Boulder‚Äôs resort is located today in north Scottsdale. From there it went past the northern slope of Black Mountain and continued west to Cave Creek. A bubbling spring near what is now Rancho Manana, provided a nice respite for weary travelers. After that it was north along the banks of Cave Creek and crossing into what is now Cave Creek Regional Park. From there it passed through the New River Mountains and Black Canyon, then went north through Mayer to Fort Whipple and Prescott. Evacuation Of Fort McDowell Road sign which indicates where the Stoneman Military passed through On April 10, 1890, Fort McDowell was vacated by the US military and became the Fort McDowell Indian Reservation which served the Mohave, Pima, and Apache tribes. As far as the Stoneman Road, with the lack of traffic on it after 1890 combined with the attrition of time and the Arizona weather, only minimal traces are left. Historical Task Force A historical task force has discovered portions of the road in parts of McDowell Mountain Park and near the old Brown‚Äôs Ranch location near north Scottsdale. Another discernible section runs between Stagecoach Pass at Windmill Road northwest to Cave Creek Road ending by a gate going into the Carefree Airport. Running east to west, south of Cave Creek Road, is a short section of the Military Road which is part of the old Stoneman Road. It originally ran toward Cave Creek and by what is thought to be a military remount station from the 1870-1890 era. Other than that, the road has pretty much succumbed to the sands of time.

Between 1970 and 1972 he won five individual NCAA championships for the University of Denver_Pioneers_ski_team while the team won two team championships. After the Sapporo Olympics Tschudi competed for eight seasons on the World Pro Skiing Tour, leading the Rossignol international team. He served as president of the Professional Ski Racers Association and as director of skiing at Winter Park Resort in Colorado. Tschudi later joined the financial-service firm Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, and rose to become a partner and managing director of international sales at Thomas Weisel Partners (now Stifel Financial).

Among his sponsors he recruited Sun Valley Resort, Avis, Air France, Look, Mossant, Swix, Smith and Raichle ski boots. Tschudi graduated the University of Denver in 1974, with combined BS/BA degrees in hotel and restaurant management. Thereafter he focused on skiing-related businesses, launching a line of padded ski racing suits under the label Otto Racing, and (beginning in 1977) serving as director of skiing at Winter Park Resort in Colorado. With sports commentator Larry Zimmer, he hosted a weekly television ski program on Denver‚Äôs NBC affiliate.Thys Morgan, Edith. ‚ÄúOtto Tschudi,‚Äù in Skiing History magazine, March-April 2014 pp 11-12 Meanwhile, he continued to race on the pro circuit, representing fellow racers first as vice president of the International Ski Racers Association (1973-76), then as president of its successor organization, the Professional Ski Racers Association (1981-82). During his pro racing career he represented Rossignol, Atomic and Head skis and Swix ski wax; he also worked on athlete relationships for the International Management Group. In 1982 Tschudi retired from ski racing and joined Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, using his facility with languages and extensive contacts in Europe to sell financial products in the EU. In 1999 he opened the London office of Thomas Weisel Partners. Today (2018), Tschudi is managing director of international sales at Stifel Nicolaus, which acquired Weisel in 2010. Separately, Tschudi owns a land development company in Norway.

It was released for Microsoft Windows on April 8, 2011. The premise of the game is that during World War II, Adolf Hitler found a way to resurrect dinosaurs for use in the war effort. Players can battle online choosing to serve either the Allied nations or Nazis. The game was described as a new twist on \\"the overdone World War II FPS [...] that has become a running joke in the industry and gaming press\\". Gameplay The Allied team fights against a Tyrannosaurus rex Dino D-Day is a first-person shooter where players join one of two teams of other players as they attempt to complete their goal. Players have the choice between the Allied nations or the Axis powers, the latter represented by the Nazis and their dinosaur soldiers. Upon the game's initial release, both the Allies and the Axis had six different classes of soldier. The Allied classes range from assault troops, medics and heavy support. However, the Axis have three human and three dinosaur classes. The human classes comprise assault troops, snipers, and medics; while the dinosaurs comprise an attack Velociraptor, Dilophosaurus, and a Desmatosuchus with a cannon mounted on its back. Additional classes were added to both teams at later dates bringing the total to seven classes for the Allies and nine for the Axis. The Allies gained a dinosaur class of their own, a Protoceratops with a mounted machine gun. The Axis gained a Stygimoloch with a mounted gun, a Compsognathus that acts as a kamikaze bomber with a grenade and a flying Microraptor. In certain maps, an Axis player can also be chosen at random to play as a Tyrannosaurus with a jaw-mounted machine gun. While powerful, the class counts as three kills in a team deathmatch. The initial release consisted of five maps and three game modes that included: team deathmatch, where players must reach a set number of killed enemy players; king of the hill, where teams fight for control of a section of a map; and objective mode, where players are given specific goals to capture including a Fortress Objective where one Axis player takes control of a Styracosaurus with a Panzer IV turret mounted on its back and with his team must make it to their objective point while the allies must stop it with explosives. Development Dino D-Day was originally a mod released in 2009 for the popular Valve game Half Life 2. It was later released as a stand-alone game on April 11, 2011. It has since had many free content updates adding new maps, characters, and bug fixes, the latest of which was released on July 16, 2017 adding a new map and multiple fixes. On September 29, 2014, the Last Stand DLC was released. It could be purchased for an extra charge and added new playable dinosaurs, two new maps, an upgrade system, and co-op survival gameplay. Reception Upon release, Dino-Day met with mixed reviews. The game's controls and graphics were universally singled out as being disappointing and problematic, with the website IGN describing it as \\"a class- based quagmire.\\" Despite complaints regarding balance and playability, the art direction and alternate history setting were praised. Some also noted the game's sense of humour as a positive. Additionally, critics on Metacritic gave the game average reviews, with PC PowerPlay saying the game had \\"amateur execution\\" and PC Gamer saying the game was \\"Like a dinosaur skeleton in your local museum, [...] barebones, missing some pieces, and ancient-looking.\\" In other media In 2013, Icehouse Animation announced that it would produce a Dino D-Day animated series, and named Tommy Blacha as a writer for the show. The series has not been released. On January 9, 2015, the first issue of the Dino D-Day comic was released. It tells the origin story of Jack Hardgrave and Nigel Blythe-Crossley as they attempt to uncover Hitler's dinosaur project hidden in a Nazi submarine base. No further issues have been published.

This pathway is also influenced by fed versus fasting states, stress levels, and a variety of other hormones. When carbohydrates are consumed, digested, and absorbed the pancreas senses the subsequent rise in blood glucose concentration and releases insulin to promote uptake of glucose from the bloodstream. When insulin binds to the insulin receptor, it leads to a cascade of cellular processes that promote the usage or, in some cases, the storage of glucose in the cell. The effects of insulin vary depending on the tissue involved, e.g., insulin is most important in the uptake of glucose by muscle and adipose tissue. This insulin signal transduction pathway is composed of trigger mechanisms (e.g., autophosphorylation mechanisms) that serve as signals throughout the cell. There is also a counter mechanism in the body to stop the secretion of insulin beyond a certain limit. Namely, those counter-regulatory mechanisms are glucagon and epinephrine. The process of the regulation of blood glucose (also known as glucose homeostasis) also exhibits oscillatory behavior. On a pathological basis, this topic is crucial to understanding certain disorders in the body such as diabetes, hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.  Transduction pathway  The functioning of a signal transduction pathway is based on extra-cellular signaling that in turn creates a response that causes other subsequent responses, hence creating a chain reaction, or cascade. During the course of signaling, the cell uses each response for accomplishing some kind of a purpose along the way. Insulin secretion mechanism is a common example of signal transduction pathway mechanism. Insulin is produced by the pancreas in a region called Islets of Langerhans. In the islets of Langerhans, there are beta-cells, which are responsible for production and storage of insulin. Insulin is secreted as a response mechanism for counteracting the increasing excess amounts of glucose in the blood. Glucose in the body increases after food consumption. This is primarily due to carbohydrate intake, but to a much lesser degree protein intake ()(). Depending on the tissue type, the glucose enters the cell through facilitated diffusion or active transport. In muscle and adipose tissue, glucose enters through GLUT 4 receptors via facilitated diffusion (). In brain, retina, kidney, RBC, placenta and many other organs, glucose enters using GLUT 1 and GLUT 3. In the beta-cells of the pancreas and in liver cells, glucose enters through the GLUT 2 receptors (process described below). = Insulin biosynthesis and transcription = Insulin biosynthesis is regulated by transcriptional and translational levels. The Œ≤-cells promote their protein transcription in response to nutrients. The exposure of rat Langerhans islets to glucose for 1 hour is able to remarkably induce the intracellular proinsulin levels. It was noted that the proinsulin mRNA remained stable. This suggests that the acute response to glucose of the insulin synthesis is independent of mRNA synthesis in the first 45 minutes because the blockage of the transcription decelerated the insulin accumulation during that time. PTBPs, also called Polypyrimidine tract binding proteins, are proteins that regulate the translation of mRNA. They increase the viability of mRNA and provoke the initiation of the translation. PTBP1 enable the insulin gene- specific activation and insulin granule protein mRNA by glucose. Two aspects of the transduction pathway process are explained below: insulin secretion and insulin action on the cell. Insulin Secretion process (Figure 1.1.1) = Insulin secretion = The glucose that goes into the bloodstream after food consumption also enters the beta cells in the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. The glucose diffuses in the beta-cell facilitated by a GLUT-2 vesicle. Inside the beta cell, the following process occurs: Glucose gets converted to Glucose-6-Phosphate (G6P) through Glucokinase, and G6P is subsequently oxidized to form ATP. This process inhibits the ATP-sensitive potassium ion channels of the cell causing the Potassium ion channel to close and not function anymore. The closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channels causes depolarization of the cell membrane causing the cell membrane to stretch which causes the voltage-gated calcium channel on the membrane to open causing an influx of Ca2+ ions. This influx then stimulates fusion of the insulin vesicles to the cell membrane and secretion of insulin in the extracellular fluid outside the beta cell; thus making it enter the bloodstream. [Also Illustrated in Figure 1.1.1]. Insulin action on the cell process (Figure 1.1.2) There are 3 subfamilies of Ca+2 channels; L-type Ca+2 channels, Non-L-Type Ca+2 channels (including R-Type) and the T-type Ca+2 channels. There are two phases of the insulin secretion, the first phase involves the L-type Ca+2 channels and the second phase involves the R-type Ca+2 channels. The Ca+2 influx generated by R-type Ca+2 channels is not enough to cause insulin exocytosis, however, it increases the mobilization of the vesicles towards the cell membrane. = Fatty acids and insulin secretion = Fatty acids also affect insulin secretion. In type 2 diabetes, fatty acids are able to potentiate insulin release to compensate the increment need of insulin. It was found that the Œ≤-cells express free fatty acid receptors at their surface, through which fatty acids can impact the function of Œ≤-cells. Long-chain acyl-CoA and DAG are the metabolites resulting from the intracellular metabolism of fatty acids. Long-chain acyl-CoA has the ability to acylate proteins that are essential in the insulin granule fusion. On the other hand, DAG activates PKC that is involved in the insulin secretion. = Hormonal regulation of insulin secretion = Several hormones can affect insulin secretion. Estrogen is correlated with an increase of insulin secretion by depolarizing the Œ≤-cells membrane and enhancing the entry of Ca+2. In contrast, growth hormone is known to lower the serum level of insulin by promoting the production of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). IGF-I, in turn, suppresses the insulin secretion. = Action on the cell = After insulin enters the bloodstream, it binds to a membrane-spanning glycoprotein receptor. This glycoprotein is embedded in the cellular membrane and has an extracellular receptor domain, made up of two Œ±-subunits, and an intracellular catalytic domain made up of two Œ≤-subunits. The Œ±-subunits act as insulin receptors and the insulin molecule acts as a ligand. Together, they form a receptor-ligand complex. Binding of insulin to the Œ±-subunit results in a conformational change in the membrane-bound glycoprotein, which activates tyrosine kinase domains on each Œ≤-subunit. The tyrosine kinase activity causes an auto phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues in the Œ≤-subunit. The phosphorylation of 3 residues of tyrosine is necessary for the amplification of the kinase activity. Once the tyrosine kinase is activated in the insulin receptor, it triggers the activation of the docking proteins, also called IRS (1-4) that are important in the signaling pathway, and then the activation of the PI-3k The two enzymes Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAP-Kinase) and Phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase (PI-3K, Phosphoinositide 3-kinase) are responsible for expressing the mitogenic and metabolic actions of Insulin, respectively. The activation of MAP-Kinase leads to the completion of mitogenic functions like cell growth and gene expression. The activation of PI-3K leads to crucial metabolic functions such as synthesis of lipids, proteins and glycogen. It also leads to cell survival and cell proliferation. Most importantly, the PI-3K pathway is responsible for the distribution of glucose for important cell functions. The activation of PI-3K leads to the activation of PKB (AKT) that induces the impact of insulin on the liver. For example, the suppression of hepatic glucose synthesis and the activation of glycogen synthesis. Hence, PKB possesses a crucial role in the linkage of the glucose transporter (GLUT4) to the insulin signaling pathway. The activated GLUT4 will translocate to the cell membrane and promotes the transportation of glucose into the intracellular medium. Thus, insulin's role is more of a promoter for the usage of glucose in the cells rather than neutralizing or counteracting it. = Regulation of the insulin receptor signal = PI-3K is one of the important components in the regulation of the insulin signaling pathway. It maintains the insulin sensitivity in the liver. PI-3K is composed of a regulatory subunit (P85) and a catalytic subunit (P110). P85 regulates the activation of PI-3K enzyme. In the PI-3K heterodimer (P85-p110), P85 is responsible for the PI-3K activity, by binding to the binding site on the insulin receptor substrates (IRS). It was noted that an increase of P85 a (isoform of P85) results in a competition between the later and the P85-P110 complex to the IRS binding site, reducing the PI-3k activity and leading to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance refers also to Type 2 diabetes. It was also noted that increased serine phosphorylation of IRS is involved in the insulin resistance by reducing their ability to attract PI3K. The serine phosphorylation can also lead to degradation of IRS-1.  Feedback mechanisms  Signal transduction is a mechanism in which the cell responds to a signal from the environment by activating several proteins and enzymes that will give a response to the signal. Feedback mechanism might involve negative and positive feedbacks. In the negative feedback, the pathway is inhibited and the final result of the transduction pathway is reduced or limited. In positive feedback, the transduction pathway is promoted and stimulated to produce more products. = Positive = Insulin secretion results in positive feedback in different ways. Firstly, insulin increases the uptake of glucose from blood by the translocation and exocytosis of GLUT4 storage vesicles in the muscle and fat cells. Secondly, it promotes the conversion of glucose into triglyceride in the liver, fat, and muscle cells. Finally, the cell will increase the rate of glycolysis within itself to break glucose in the cell into other components for tissue growth purposes. An example of positive feedback mechanism in the insulin transduction pathway is the activation of some enzymes that inhibit other enzymes from slowing or stopping the insulin transduction pathway which results in improved intake of the glucose. One of these pathways, involves the PI(3)K enzyme (Phosphoinositide 3-kinase). This pathway is responsible for activating glycogen, lipid-protein synthesis, and specific gene expression of some proteins which will help in the intake of glucose. Different enzymes control this pathway. Some of these enzymes constrict the pathway causing a negative feedback like the GSK-3 pathway. Other enzymes will push the pathway forward causing a positive feedback like the AKT and P70 enzymes. When insulin binds to its receptor, it activates the glycogen synthesis by inhibiting the enzymes that slow down the PI(3)K pathway such as PKA enzyme. At the same time, it will promote the function of the enzymes that provide a positive feedback for the pathway like the AKT and P70 enzymes. The inactivation of the enzymes that stop the reaction and activating of enzymes that provide a positive feedback will increase glycogen, lipid & protein syntheses and promote glucose intake. (Image to help explain the function of the proteins mentioned above in the positive feedback.) = Negative = When insulin binds to the cell's receptor, it results in negative feedback by limiting or stopping some other actions in the cell. It inhibits the release and production of glucose from the cells which is an important part in reducing the glucose blood level. Insulin will also inhibit the breakdown of glycogen into glucose by inhibiting the expression of the enzymes that catalyzes the degradation of Glycogen. An example of negative feedback is slowing or stopping the intake of glucose after the pathway was activated. Negative feedback is shown in the insulin signal transduction pathway by constricting the phosphorylation of the insulin-stimulated tyrosine. The enzyme that deactivates or phosphorylates the insulin-stimulated tyrosine is called tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). When activated, this enzyme provides a negative feedback by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of the insulin receptors. The dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor slows down glucose intake by inhibiting the activation (phosphorylation) of proteins responsible for further steps of the insulin transduction pathway.  Trigger mechanism  Insulin is synthesized and secreted in the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans. Once insulin is synthesized, the beta cells are ready to release it in two different phases. As for the first phase, insulin release is triggered rapidly when the blood glucose level is increased. The second phase is a slow release of newly formed vesicles that are triggered regardless of the blood sugar level. Glucose enters the beta cells and goes through glycolysis to form ATP that eventually causes depolarization of the beta cell membrane (as explained in Insulin secretion section of this article). The depolarization process causes voltage-controlled calcium channels (Ca2+) opening, allowing the calcium to flow into the cells. An increased calcium level activates phospholipase C, which cleaves the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 binds to receptor proteins in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This releases (Ca2+) from the ER via IP3 gated channels, and raises the cell concentration of calcium even more. The influx of Ca2+ ions causes the secretion of insulin stored in vesicles through the cell membrane. The process of insulin secretion is an example of a trigger mechanism in a signal transduction pathway because insulin is secreted after glucose enters the beta cell and that triggers several other processes in a chain reaction.  Counter mechanism  = Function of glucagon = While insulin is secreted by the pancreas to lower blood glucose levels, glucagon is secreted to raise blood glucose levels. This is why glucagon has been known for decades as a counter-regulatory hormone. When blood glucose levels are low, the pancreas secretes glucagon, which in turn causes the liver to convert stored glycogen polymers into glucose monomers, which is then released into the blood. This process is called glycogenolysis. Liver cells, or hepatocytes, have glucagon receptors which allow for glucagon to attach to them and thus stimulate glycogenolysis. Contrary to insulin, which is produced by pancreatic Œ≤-cells, glucagon is produced by pancreatic Œ±-cells. It is also known that an increase in insulin suppresses glucagon secretion, and a decrease in insulin, along with low glucose levels, stimulates the secretion of glucagon.  Oscillatory behavior  When blood glucose levels are too low, the pancreas is signaled to release glucagon, which has essentially the opposite effect of insulin and therefore opposes the reduction of glucose in the blood. Glucagon is delivered directly to the liver, where it connects to the glucagon receptors on the membranes of the liver cells, signals the conversion of the glycogen already stored in the liver cells into glucose. This process is called glycogenolysis. Conversely, when the blood glucose levels are too high, the pancreas is signaled to release insulin. Insulin is delivered to the liver and other tissues throughout the body (e.g., muscle, adipose). When the insulin is introduced to the liver, it connects to the insulin receptors already present, that is tyrosine kinase receptor. These receptors have two alpha subunits (extracellular) and two beta subunits (intercellular) which are connected through the cell membrane via disulfide bonds. When the insulin binds to these alpha subunits, 'glucose transport 4' (GLUT4) is released and transferred to the cell membrane to regulate glucose transport in and out of the cell. With the release of GLUT4, the allowance of glucose into cells is increased, and therefore the concentration of blood glucose might decrease. This, in other words, increases the utilization of the glucose already present in the liver. This is shown in the adjacent image. As glucose increases, the production of insulin increases, which thereby increases the utilization of the glucose, which maintains the glucose levels in an efficient manner and creates an oscillatory behavior.

The identity of the killers has never been determined, though Israel and a number of sources state that unidentified Palestinian terrorists were responsible.see \\"Responsibility\\" Koby Mandell was an Israeli-American, his family having emigrated from the United States to Israel in 1996, and the murders resulted in legislation by the U.S. Congress aimed at strengthening the U.S. response to the killing of Americans overseas. In response to his death, Koby's parents set up the Koby Mandell Foundation to provide support for families bereaved by terrorist attacks. Disappearance and discovery Koby Mandell () and Yosef Ishran () were two Israeli teens, 13 and 14 years old. Koby was a citizen of both the United States and Israel. The boys lived and attended school in the Israeli settlement of Tekoa, Gush Etzion, near the West Bank located Palestinian town of the same name variously referred to in English as Tuqu', Tekoa, and similar spellings. On 8 May 2001, the boys skipped school and went hiking in the Judean desert surrounding their village. At first, their parents did not worry about the boys. They believed that they had gone to school, and then to Jerusalem to participate in a political demonstration. But when the boys did not come home by midnight, their parents informed the authorities. The bodies of two boys were discovered the next morning in a cave near the West Bank settlement where they lived. USA Today reported that, according to the police, both boys had \\"been bound, stabbed and beaten to death with rocks\\". The newspaper continued, \\"The walls of the cave in the Judean Desert were covered with the boys' blood, reportedly smeared there by the killers\\". CNN and the Irish Independent reported that \\"Israel's Channel Two TV said police believed there were at least three assailants who dipped their hands into the boys' blood after the killing and smeared it on the walls of the cave.\\" Miro Cohen, a sheep rancher described the scene to Time: \\"A rock the size of a computer rested on Kobi's smashed skull. Both bodies were covered with stones. Blood smeared the walls, and the dirt floor was muddy with it.\\" The bodies were so badly mutilated and disfigured that dental records had to be used for positive identification. The Jerusalem Post reported that police could not determine whether the boys had been killed outside the cave, or if their bodies were deposited in the cave after the murders. After forensic examination, the bodies, together with blood-stained rocks, were taken out of the cave. The boys' funeral was attended by thousands of people. Responsibility Israeli police made several statements about responsibility for the murders. They were reported variously as stating that thieves, who stole 100 goats from Tekoa the same night, may have been responsible; that there was no clear link between the two crimes; and that there was no link. One police commander however expressed the view that there was \\"no doubt\\" the murders were committed \\"for nationalistic reasons\\". Police said the killings appeared to have taken place during a \\"chance encounter\\" rather than one that had been planned in advance. Israeli security forces arrested 20 Palestinians from nearby villages and imposed curfews and roadblocks in response to the attack. A few of the many news agencies that reported about the murders said that an anonymous person claiming to represent an Islamic militant group telephoned one or more other news agencies to take responsibility. The Irish Independent reported that a call was made to Reuters, and that the call could not be authenticated but purportedly claimed revenge for the killing of an Islamic Jihad militant the previous Saturday as a motive. The Irish Independent did not name any particular group. The Jerusalem Post said in its day-after the event story that an anonymous caller to unnamed \\"foreign news agencies\\" had said he represented a group called \\"Hizbullah-Palestine\\" and that the boys were killed as revenge for the death of a four-month-old Palestinian baby, Iman Hiju, who became the youngest victim of violence when she was killed by an Israeli tank shell a few days previously. That death was apologized for by Ariel Sharon, who stressed that the \\"soldiers did not intend to kill her\\". A subsequent Jerusalem Post story, printed in 2008, suggested that the boys' killings might be attributable to \\"Bedouin shepherds\\". Three books on terrorism that include compilations of terrorist attacks against Israel subsequently listed the murders as being attributable to Islamic Jihad and/or a \\"splinter group\\" of Hezbollah, called \\"Hizbullah-Palestine\\". Another source blames \\"a Palestinian mob\\". The Boston Globe reported that Israeli settlers, among other possible motives, suggested \\"a group of Palestinian youths had staked a claim on the cave during the seven months of violence, and that Israeli youths had been warned not to hike there.\\" Most sources simply blame unidentified Palestinian terrorists. According to a 2004 U.S. Congressional report, there was never a \\"meaningful investigation or prosecution\\" of the case, and apparently, the perpetrators have yet to be apprehended. Reactions The Israeli government condemned the killings. Ariel Sharon blamed the murder on the Palestinian Authority. Sharon said that Palestinian security forces do nothing to stop terrorists from murdering innocent civilians. He said that Palestinian TV was promoting violence \\"by broadcasting music videos filled with images of children throwing stones.\\" The Palestinian Authority condemned the killings. A spokesman for the Authority, Saeb Erekat said, \\"The Palestinian Authority regrets the loss of life of these two boys and all children, be it Israeli or Palestinian, Jewish, Muslim or Christian.\\" He added that killing civilians on either side of the ongoing conflict is a crime, and that \\"the short way for peace and stability is finishing the Israeli occupation.\\" Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestinian National Authority, responded by blaming Israel for \\"victimizing Palestinian children\\". He cited the case of a three-month-old Palestinian girl, Reema Ahmed, wounded by gunfire the previous Wednesday during an Israeli attack on a Palestinian refugee camp. Shlomo Riskin, a rabbi from Efrat, saw \\"a profound distinction\\" between \\"Israel and its enemies\\": > [I]f a child is killed by Israel, it is in an act of defense directed at a > building where shots were fired at soldiers. In the case of Kobi and Yossi > and Shalhevet, the enemy picked out innocent children to destroy them. Ariel Sharon characterized the boys' deaths as a \\"horrific murder\\" and ordered a missile strike on Yasser Arafat's Fatah offices in Gaza City, in which 20 Palestinians were wounded. U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher called the killings of the Israeli boys \\"horrible, brutal\\". Pope John Paul II, speaking in Malta, said he was saddened by \\"news from the Holy Land of terrible violence even against innocent young people.\\" Koby Mandell Act As a result of the murders, several American legislators introduced the Koby Mandell Act, which reprimanded the State Department for, as it said, not doing enough about Palestinian terrorists who had harmed American citizens, and which would create an Office of Justice for Victims of Overseas Terrorism in the Department of Justice. The legislation was spearheaded by Sarah Stern, currently with the Endowment for Middle East Truth and formerly the lobbyist for the Zionist Organization of America, but was not a priority of other Jewish groups, who said that it did more to reprimand the State Department rather than support counter-terrorism: by targeting only Palestinian terrorists, they said, it was too narrow in its scope and would not, for example, have been able to deal with the murder of Daniel Pearl. The provisions of the law which created the office were eventually incorporated into a 2004 omnibus spending bill. The Koby Mandell Foundation and comedy shows The mission of the Koby Mandell Foundation, set up by his parents Seth and Sherri Mandell, is to \\"work to bridge the isolation that bereaved children and adults are struck with after the loss of a loved one.\\" Leonard A. Cole, in his book Terror: how Israel has coped and what America can learn, writes that Koby's parents are determined \\"to take the cruelty of Koby's murder and transform it into kindness.\\" Both Seth and Sherri Mandell reject responding to violence with violence. Seth Mandell says that \\"Throwing stones at Arab houses makes us as bad as the Arabs, and is not an intelligent response.\\" Urging against the violence he says: \\"There's plenty of stuff that can be done that is non-violent and makes a point.\\" Sherri Mandell says that \\"Revenge, to her, means they have won\\". Koby's parents organized comedy shows to commemorate the memory of their son, who they say loved jokes.

Part of the Vorkosigan Saga, it was first published by Baen Books in March 1994, and is included in the 2002 omnibus Miles Errant.  Plot summary  Mark, Miles Vorkosigan's clone, masquerades as him and dupes his mercenary force, the Dendarii, into undertaking a mission to free clones held \\"prisoner\\" on Jackson's Whole, an anything-goes freebooters' planet where Mark was created and raised. These teenage clones are scheduled to have their brains replaced by those of their wealthy, aged progenitors. When Miles finds out, he attempts to rescue his troops and his brother from the mess Mark has made, but is killed by a needle-grenade. He is frozen in a cryonic chamber on the spot, but the medic in charge becomes separated from the rest of the men while retreating under fire. The medic uses an automated shipping system to send the chamber to safety, but is killed before he can tell anyone what he did and where he sent it. The Dendarii flee the debacle and take Mark to Miles's parents on Barrayar. Cordelia accepts him as another son and has him acknowledged legally as a member of the family. After a while, Mark becomes frustrated by Barrayaran Imperial Security's lack of progress; he is convinced that Miles is still on Jackson's Whole, and decides to go there himself to look for him. Cordelia helps by buying him a ship. Meanwhile, the frozen Miles has been resuscitated by the Duronas, a research group cloned from a medical genius and employed by Jackson's Whole magnate Baron Fell. They hope to engage the services of the Dendarii, who have a reputation for difficult extractions, to help them escape from Jackson's Whole. Miles' memory takes some time to return, and the doctors treating him do not know whether he is Mark, Miles or Admiral Naismith (Miles' cover identity as the commander of the Dendarii). Mark finds Miles, but is captured by Miles' old nemesis, Baron Ryoval, and tortured for five days, His personality fragments into four sub-personalities: Gorge the glutton, Grunt the sex pervert, Howl the masochist, and Killer the assassin. Together, the first three protect Mark's fragile persona, while Killer bides his time. When Ryoval's assistant informs him that Mark seems to have adjusted remarkably quickly and is actually enjoying the torture, a frustrated Ryoval decides to study his victim alone. Killer takes the opportunity to kill Ryoval, enabling Mark to escape. Mark sells Ryoval's security access codes to Baron Fell for a large sum of money and the Durona Group's freedom. Miles' short death and revivification have serious repercussions for his health. Mark has his own problems, thanks to his strange upbringing, complicated by the torture. When he asks his mother for help, she sends him to Beta Colony for psychiatric treatment and therapy. By necessity, this novel is told from the viewpoints of Miles and Mark. This was the first novel in the Vorkosigan series to be written this way, though not the first time Bujold has employed this style; the first occasion was in Falling Free.

The Druze canon The full Druze canon or Druze scripture includes the Old Testament, the New Testament, the Quran and philosophical works by Plato and those influenced by Socrates among works from other religions and philosophers. The Druze claim that an understanding of these is necessary, but that their al-  ªUqqƒÅl (ÿπŸÇÿßŸÑ), (\\"the Knowledgeable Initiates\\") have access to writings of their own that supersede these. The Epistles of Wisdom are also referred to as the Kitab al-Hikma (Book of Wisdom) and Al-Hikma al-Sharifa. Other ancient Druze writings include the Rasa'il al-Hind (Epistles of India) and the previously lost (or hidden) manuscripts such as al-Munfarid bi-Dhatihi and al- Sharia al-Ruhaniyya as well as others including didactic and polemic treatises. Description The Epistles of Wisdom were written in the Arabic language and contain one hundred and eleven epistles in total. They are organised into six books first compiled by one of the greatest Druze sages 'Abd-Allah Al-Tanukhi in 1479 AD. According to oral traditions there were originally twenty-four books. Eighteen are reasonably assumed to have been lost, hidden or destroyed. Epistle number six is dated earliest and was written in July 1017 AD by Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad and he is specifically mentioned as the author of thirty more epistles in the first two books. Epistles 109 and 110 are dated latest, written by Al-Muqtana Baha'uddin in 1042 AD. Epistles 36 to 40 are attributed to Isma'il al-Tamimi ibn Muhammad. The first epistle opens with the goodbye message from Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, the original teacher of the Druze. He details his efforts to assist his people's welfare and peace and urges them to remain upright. History The Druze religious establishment's interpretation of taqiyya (ÿ™ŸÇ€åÿ©) and the esoteric nature of the faith led to the restriction of access, inquiry and investigation from even their own uninitiated Druze known as al-JuhhƒÅl (ÿ¨ŸáÿßŸÑ) (\\"the Ignorant\\") or jismaniyeen (\\"the Material Ones\\"). Such restrictions aimed to prevent possible damage to the individual and community if the writings were interpreted incorrectly, since the study of the Epistles of Wisdom is better accompanied by commentary texts and guidance from the higher ranking Druze Uqqal (\\"Knowledgeable Ones\\"). Druze manuscripts are generally written in a language, grammar and diction that, to the uninitiated is hard to understand and includes ambiguous words and highly obscure and cryptic phrases, in- addition to the extensive usage of symbology and numerology in much of the writings. A Syrian physician gave one of the first Druze manuscripts to Louis XIV in 1700, which is now kept in the Biblioth√®que Nationale. Local disturbances such as the invasion of Ibrahim Pasha between 1831 and 1838, along with the 1860 Lebanon conflict caused some of these texts to fall into the hands of academics. Other original manuscripts are held in the Robert Garrett collection at Princeton University.Hitti, Philip K., Origins of the Druze People and Religion, CHAPTER V, DRUZE THEOLOGY AND ITS SOURCES, 1928. The first French translation was published in 1838 by linguist and orientalist Antoine Isaac, Baron Silvestre de Sacy in Expose de la religion des Druzes.Antoine Isaac, Baron Silvestre de Sacy, Expose de la Religion des Druzes (Paris, 1838; republ. Amsterdam, 1964)Traboulsi, Samer., Journal of the American Oriental Society, Article, Les Epitres sacrees des Druzes: Rasa il al-Hikma, volumes 1 et 2, July-Sept, 2009. Another edition of the Rasa'il al- hikma was published by pseudonymous writers in Lebanon in 1986 as part of the highly controversial \\"The Hard Truth\\" series which included several anti- Druze, anti-Alawite and anti-Islamic books and was banned by the authorities for containing misleading information and hate speech, also an unpublished dissertation by David Bryer was prepared on the first two volumes. A French translation and critical examination of these first two volumes (epistles one to forty) from the Epistles of Wisdom was published in 2007 by Daniel de Smet who has provided a doctrinal introduction, notes, a description and inventory of the manuscripts and studies of their contents and characteristics. Contents The epistles contain philosophical discourses about Neoplatonic and Gnostic subjects, Ptolemaic cosmology, Arabic paraphrases of the philosophies of Farabi, Plotinus and Proclus, writings on the Universal Soul along with several polemic epistles concerning other faiths and philosophies that were present during that time and towards individuals who were considered renegades or those who tried to distort and tarnish the reputation of the faith and its teachings such as the \\"Answering the Nusayri\\" epistle and the fifth volume of the Epistles. Most of the Epistles are written in a post- classical language, often showing similarities to Arab Christian authors.Conf√©rences de M. Daniel De Smet., Universit√© Catholique de Louvain, p.149, 2008. The texts provide formidable insight into the incorporation of the Universal Intellect and Soul of the world in 11th century Egypt, when the deity showed itself to men through Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim and his doctrines. These display a notable form of Arabic Neoplatonism blended with Ismailism and adopted Christian elements of great interest for the philosophy and history of religions. It is believed by the Druze from interpretation of the epistles that Al-Hakim did not die, but merely withdrew into occultation and will return one day and reveal the Druze wisdom to the world in order to inaugurate a golden age. Quotes On the concept of God, Hamza ibn Ali wrote On the concept of reincarnation and the universal soul, Baha'uddin wrote On the concept of atheism, Baha'uddin argued Regarding the secrecy of the epistles of wisdom, Hamza ibn Ali wrote However he did remark With regards the unity of God and how to remain in a state of peace of mind and contentment (Rida (Arabic: ÿ±ÿ∂ÿß)) and find knowledge of true love, Hamza ibn Ali left us a message References External links * The Druze Heritage Foundation * The American Druze Society 1479 books Essay collections Gnosticism Religious texts Druze ","title":"Epistles of Wisdom"},{"id":"31217030","text":"Hibbertia aspera, commonly known as trailing Guinea flower, is a small shrub that is native to Australia.

Among these are a famous pool in which Puteri Saadong was believed to have bathed, and three granite rocks at the peak of the hill resembling Puteri Saadong's favourite musical instrument. However, the hill is being negatively affected by excavation of soil for use in land reclamation; local villagers are said to be selling soil from the hill at RM40 for one lorry-load. Aside from the damage to the historical site, this also may introduce the danger of mudslides and landslides during the monsoon season. The state government has offered to purchase the hill from its owners in accordance with the National Heritage Act 2005, in order to prevent further damage.

The holotype specimen makes Atacamatitan one of the most complete titanosaurs from Chile. Discovery and naming In February 2000, with the purpose of looking for Mesozoic fossils in Chile, Chilean and Brazilian researchers established a preliminary expedition that was organized by the Chilean National Museum of Natural History and the National Museum of Brazil heading to Antofagasta Region. During the expedition, they discovered the deposits of the Tolar Formation, located about 150 km north of Calama town and 50 km east from El Abra cooper mine. The deposits of this formation consists of well-stratified, red succession of breccias, conglomerates and sandstones. In July 2001, a second expedition was organized and with this, the excavation of the formation. The results ended on the discovery of the holotype of Atacamatitan: SGO-PV-961. The fossil remains were found in an outcrop surface of 2 m¬≤ near Conchi Viejo town, Atacama Desert in Antofagasta Region, and they were associated to a single individual. The geological age of this formation is uncertain, ranging from the Late Cretaceous to the Paleocene. However, the discovery of Atacamatitan seems to support a Cretaceous age. Atacamatitan was later named and described by Alexander et al. 2011, becoming one of the most complete titanosaur known from Chile. The generic name, Atacamatitan, is in reference to the Atacama desert, were the remains were found, and the greek word Œ§ŒπœÑŒ¨ŒΩ, meaning titan. The specific name, chilensis, refers to Chile. The holotype is currently housed at the Chilean National Museum of Natural History. Description Skeletal diagram of the holotype compared to a 1.8 m tall human The holotype, SGO-PV-961, consists of a right femur, the proximal end of a humerus, two dorsal vertebrae, posterior caudal vertebrae, dorsal ribs and a possibly fragmentary element of the sternum, other fragmented caudal vertebrae and indeterminate bones. Most elements are slightly distorted, have a reddish coloration and are quite ponderous, due to extensive permineralization. Although the body estimates are quite uncertain, Thomas Holtz estimated its possible weight between . Genus List for Holtz 2012 Weight Information According to Kellner et al. 2011, Atacamatitan can be recognised in having dorsal centra with pleurocoels that are curved and do not point posteriorly, dorsal vertebrae with concave ventral surface, posterior caudal vertebrae with laterally compressed neural spine having a blade-like anterior margin, femur with the proximal end getting gradually reduced until two thirds of its total length. =Vertebrae= Life restoration The two preserved dorsal vertebrae are fragmented, with partial neural arches. Both vertebrae are opisthocoelic. Dorsal vertebra SGO-PV-961a features an elongated centrum, with pleurocoels in the lateral sides that are rounded and less elongated compared to other titanosaurs. The neural arch is missing, and due to the preserverd dimensions, it is likely that it was wider than high. The second dorsal vertebra SGO-PV-961b is antero-posteriorly compressed with the neural arch partially preserved. These dorsal vertebrae differ from other titanosaurs such as Gondwanatitan, Saltasaurus, Trigonosaurus and Uberabatitan, due to the strongly concave ventral margin of the centrum. By taking into account all the characteristics of the dorsal vertebrae, Atacamatitan differs from other titanosaurs by having pleurocoels rounded and less elongated not pointing posteriorly. Although some caudal vertebrae were discovered, only two are well preserved. Both vertebrae came from the middle and posterior end of the tail. Caudal vertebra SGO-PV-961c was preserved only the centrum, it is dorsoventrally compressed and lacking pleurocoels. The centrum preserve two processes to attach chevrons, and the ventral and lateral surfaces are curved. Second caudal vertebra SGO-PV-961h is nearly complete, only lacking right prezygapophysis. The centrum is similar to SGO-PV-961c, only being smaller and posteriorly oriented. The prezygapophyses are elongated and reach nearly 30% of the anterior centrum. Postzygapophyses are reduced and positioned at the ventral margin of the neural spine. The neural arch is preserved in the anterior half of the centrum. =Forelimb and hindlimb= Ribs were unearthed too, the most complete is SGO-PV-961d, though it is unknown if the ribs of Atacamatitan had pneumatic foramina as evidenced in other titanosaurs. It is anteroposteriorly compressed with the dorsoventral diameter longer than the anteroposterior one. Capitulum and tuberculum are fragmented. The fragmentary sternal plate is thin and has a smooth border; due to its fragmentary nature, it is unclear the form. The right humerus is very fragmented, only preserving the proximal end and although the distal expansion is missing, it has a notable reduced distal end. Anteriorly, it preserves a developed depression for muscular attachment. The preserved right femur is more gracile compared to other elements, indicating that the animal had stronger forelimbs. This is seen as a possible and potential autapomorphy for this species. It measures , the femoral head is missing and posteriorly, it preserves a well developed fourth trochanter, extending to the proximal quarter. Classification In the original description, Atacamatitan was placed in the Titanosauridae. However given the fragmentary nature of the holotype, most cladistic analysis exclude Atacamatitan. Nevertheless, in 2012, Rubilar-Rogers and Gutstein conducted a preliminary cladistic analysis which ended in a polytomy within Nemegtosaurus, Rapetosaurus, Titanosaurus and the Saltasauridae. Atacamatitan was placed within the Lithostrotia.

As in all Agnostina, Acmarhachis has two thorax segments. When Agnostina are enrolled, a tiny opening between the cephalon and the thorax becomes visible (the cephalothoracic aperture) that uniquely distinguishes this group from the Eodiscina. A feature shared with all Agnostoidea is that the frontal lobe of the central raised area of the cephalon (or glabella) is not laterally expanded compared to the backward lobe, like in the Condylopygoidea. In Acmarhachis the furrow at midline between the front of the glabella and the border is weak or absent. The glabella has a long ogival to subquadrate front lobe, and the furrow defining it at its back is straight. The back lobe of the glabella is accompanied by two triangular basal lobes of moderate to large size. On the pygidium the axis or rhachis reaches the border. It is divided along its length in three lobes. It is shaped a bit like an amphora, the back pointed and strongly constricted across the middle lobe. The middle lobe also carries a node where it contacts the posterior lobe.

The film, starring Raghubir Yadav as Adolf Hitler and Neha Dhupia as Eva Braun, was directed by Rakesh Ranjan Kumar and produced by Anil Kumar Sharma under the production house Amrapali media vision. It was screened at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival where it received negative reviews. Film Business Asia quoted that \\"despite the provocative title, the film is not a tribute to the murderous F√ºhrer\\". It premiered in India on 29 July 2011. Plot The film is set during World War II and centres upon the letters written by Mohandas Gandhi (Avijit Dutt) to Adolf Hitler (Raghubir Yadav), and around the relationship of Hitler with his long-term lover Eva Braun (Neha Dhupia), whom he married in his final days in the Berlin bunker in which they died. The film depicts the difference between the ideologies of Gandhi and Hitler and claims the superiority of Gandhism over Nazism. Cast * Raghubir Yadav as Adolf Hitler * Neha Dhupia as Eva Braun * Nalin Singh as Joseph Goebbels * Nasir Abdullah as Albert Speer * Jatin Sarna as Shaqir * Lucky Vakharia as Amrita Kaur * Nikita Anand as Magda Goebbels * Bhupesh Kumar Pandey as Subhas Chandra Bose * Avijit Dutt as Mohandas Gandhi * Hanuman Prasad Rai as Otto G√ºnsche Production Anupam Kher had originally agreed to play the role of Hitler, but he backed out after Jewish organisations in India condemned him for playing the part because of Hitler's massacre of millions of Jews. The filmmakers accused Kher of not returning the 4 lakh (400,000 rupees) he had been paid after signing the contract and consequently sued him for 2.5 crore (25 million rupees). However, Kher perceived it as a way of filmmakers to promote their film before the release. It is the only mainstream Bollywood film to refer to the Indian Legion, a Waffen-SS unit recruited from Indian volunteers. Criticism and controversies Domestic Poster British newspaper, The Guardian, declared the film to be profoundly misguided and to show a shocking ignorance of history. Noah Massil, president of the Central Organization of Indian Jews in Israel (COIJI) stated that \\"he would write to President Pratibha Patil and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to intervene in order to prevent bringing disrepute to our entertainment industry\\", but the filmmakers claimed that the film does not glorify Hitler, but rather juxtaposes him against Gandhi's ideology of peace. Reception The film was met with negative reviews. The Times of India gave the film 2 stars out of 5, calling it an \\"unnecessary play with history\\". The Daily News and Analysis gave the movie one star. NDTV criticised the movie for using Indian actors to play all non-Indian characters, using India itself as a stand-in to Europe, and for its \\"strands\\". Koimoi gave the film 0.5/5; although it praised Yadav's performance as Hitler, it criticised the film's script, direction, technical values, soundtrack, and the performance from other actors.

It is black with yellow dots along its tail. Description Female Australian emperor. The Australian emperor is a very large dragonfly, up to 70 mm long. Its abdomen is marked boldly in black and yellow. The thorax is greenish-grey. The head is yellow with a T-shaped mark on the forehead (frons). The eyes are yellow-green. The leading edges of the wings are yellow. The insect habitually hunts fairly slowly, patrolling up and down like other hawkers, with short bursts at high speed. Their wingspan is . Males and females are similar.Description Distribution and habitat The Australian emperor is found throughout Australia. In the state of Victoria, it has a split distribution: below about 600 metres in altitude, and above about 1200 metres, apparently because it avoids forested areas. It is also found in New Zealand, New Guinea, the Cocos-Keeling Islands, Java, Sumba and New Caledonia.Esperance Fauna Retrieved 16 January 2012Theischinger, 2006. The Australian emperor is widespread and common on larger bodies of water with tall vegetation on the banks. Like other hawkers, it may hunt far from water. It flies throughout the summer from September to May.Hemianax papuensis Retrieved 16 January 2012 Behaviour Australian emperor laying eggs, guarded by the male in tandem position The Australian emperor is notable as the dragonfly in which motion camouflage was studied by Mizutani et al.: males of Anax papuensis are fiercely territorial, and approach and attack rivals, the males choose a flight path that keeps their image as seen by the target still with respect to a landmark point. The attacking dragonfly thus looms larger in the target's eyes, but otherwise does not seem to move until it is very close. The males are very protective of their females. In case of intrusion of another individual, he will drive it away by engaging in a series of noisy air battles. Females lay their eggs under water.

In jazz, such a group of twelve players is sometimes called a \\"twelvetet\\". The corresponding German word is duodezett. The French equivalent form, douzetuor, is virtually unknown (in sharp contrast to dixtuor, the French word for decet). Unlike some other musical ensembles such as the string quartet, there is no established or standard set of instruments in a duodecet. History Of the ensemble types named according to the number of musicians in the group, the decet, undecet, duodecet, tredecet, etc., are names less common in music than smaller groupings (quartet, quintet, etc., up to nonet). In the eighteenth century, twelve-part ensembles were most often encountered in the genre of the wind serenade, divertimento, nocturne, or partita‚Äîfor example, Josef Reicha's Parthia ex D, for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 3 horns, 2 bassoons, and double bass, and the partitas for the same instrumentation by Reicha's colleague Johann Georg Feldmayr . In fact, the titles \\"serenade\\" and \\"suite\\" continue through the 19th century to be the preferred term for ensembles of twelve or thirteen instruments, especially winds (e.g., Wilhelm Berger's op. 102 for 12 winds, Felix Mendelssohn's op. 24 for 11 or 12 winds, Max Reger's Serenade for 12 winds, or Richard Strauss's opp. 4 and 7, for 13 winds). The word \\"duodecet\\" remains rare as a genre title in the 20th century (exceptions are found amongst the works of Polish composers Barbara Buczek and Bogus≈Çaw Schaeffer), where works for twelve instruments or singers most often are given either a true title, or a genre title describing the form (e.g., \\"concertino\\", \\"suite\\", \\"variations\\"), often followed by a designator such as \\"for twelve instruments\\". The three \\"twelve-part inventions\\", variations 3 (12 solo violins), 5 (10 violas and 2 double basses), and 11 (12 wind instruments), in Stravinsky's Variations: Aldous Huxley in memoriam (1963‚Äì64) have been designated \\"duodecets\\" by his biographer Eric Walter White (; ).

It is the oldest known fossil from the infraorder Anomura, and is most closely related to Eocarcinus praecursor. Stratigraphy The holotype of P. akaina was found in the United Arab Emirates on the Musandam Peninsula ‚Äì the peninsula which separates the Persian Gulf from the Gulf of Oman. From the Permian to the Cretaceous, the area was near the shore of the Tethys Sea, which produced carbonate sedimentary rocks. The strata that contained Platykotta were part of the Ghalilah Formation, of Norian‚ÄìRhaetian age. These rocks contain extensive networks of burrows, and various other fossils, including bivalves of the families Megalodontidae and Wallowaconchidae, brachiopods, crinoids, sponges and corals. The holotype was found at approximately and has been deposited in the Natural History Museum of Geneva, Switzerland. Description Platykotta is characterised by a broad, triangular sternum, unlike the very narrow sternum seen in Astacidea (true lobsters and freshwater crayfish) and Glypheoidea. A similar sternal form is seen in the spiny lobsters and slipper lobsters, and also several families of Anomura, including Galatheidae and Chirostylidae (squat lobsters), and Aeglidae. Unlike other anomurans, however, the carapace is considerably longer than wide. The pattern of grooves on the carapace indicates clear affinities with the Anomura. Systematics Platykotta is placed in its own family, Platykottidae, which sits alongside Eocarcinidae (containing only Eocarcinus) in the superfamily Eocarcinoidea. Eocarcinus was previously treated as the earliest true crab, but is now thought, like Platykotta, to show too little carcinisation to be a true crab, and is placed instead among the Anomura.

By profession, he was a banker. Family and education Thornton was born in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, the son of Edward Parry Thornton C.B. and Louisa Chicheliana Plowden. Edward Thornton was the grandson of Samuel Thornton, former Governor of the Bank of England and was Commissioner of Rawalpindi from 1849 to 1858 under Lord Lawrence, and Judicial Commissioner for the Punjab from 1858 to 1862. He was awarded the C.B. in 1860 in recognition of his services. Between 1867 and 1869, Alfred attended Harrow School. In his final year at Harrow, he was a member of the school football team. Two elder brothers, Richard Chicheley Thornton and Robert Milnes Thornton, attended Harrow from 1861 to 1864 and 1867 respectively; Richard joined the 77th (Middlesex) Regiment in 1867, attaining the rank of Lieut.-Colonel, while Robert joined the 5th Fusiliers in 1867. A younger brother, George Walter Thornton, also attended Harrow (from 1869 to 1871); he died at Avranches in Normandy on 2 May 1873. Football career Thornton was a member of the Wanderers club, to whom he was probably introduced by E. E. Bowen, a master at Harrow School. In March 1870, along with Bowen, he was invited to play for the English XI in a match arranged by C. W. Alcock against a side representing Scotland. This was the first of a series of matches played over the next two years, before the first official football international in November 1872. There was no score in the match until 75 minutes had elapsed, when the English goalkeeper moved out of goal to play upfield; the Scots took advantage of the exposed goal when Robert Crawford scored with a shot from distance: > . . . the game progressed until within a quarter of an hour of the time > determined for the cessation of play, when the English rashly removing their > goalkeeper paid the penalty by witnessing the reduction of their fortress to > a long shot by R.E. Crawford. England fought back to score through Alfred Baker to salvage a draw a minute from the end of the game.Glasgow Herald (Glasgow, Scotland), Monday, 7 March 1870; Issue 9415. As well as being a member of the Wanderers, Thornton played for the Harrow Chequers. On 14 October 1871, he played for Harrow Chequers against the Wanderers; the teams played out a 0‚Äì0 draw. The Morning Post mentioned Thornton as \\"conspicuous for excellent play\\". Three days later, Thornton played for the Wanderers in a 1‚Äì0 victory over the Civil Service. Professional career On leaving school, Thornton became a banker progressing to manager of the Old Bank and Brewery at Windsor. The bank and brewery were owned by Nevile, Reid & Co. and was founded as Ramsbottom & Baverstock in 1780. In 1914, the bank was acquired by Barclays Bank. The brewery was acquired by Noakes & Co. of Bermondsey, London in 1918, eventually becoming part of the Courage Brewery. In the 1881 census, he was shown as living at 51 Thames Street, Clewer, Berkshire; his occupation was \\"banker\\". Thornton was also a J.P. for the County of Berkshire.

The main purpose of this statute is to allow local California governments to work together to get financing in a way that will conceivably lower borrowing costs. Underlying this concept is the belief that money can be saved through economies of scale by selling one large bond issue to finance several small projects. Through this legislation, local municipalities and other political subdivisions can join together by signing a Joint Powers Agreement, which creates a Joint Powers Authority (\\"JPA\\"). In its broadest terms, the Marks-Roos Act authorizes JPAs to issue Marks-Roos bonds and loan the proceeds to local governmental agencies and non-profit corporations to finance public capital improvements, working capital or insurance programs. Alternatively, JPAs can purchase the bonds of local agencies with the proceeds of Marks-Roos bonds. Marks-Roos bonds do not require voter approval. Instead they are approved by resolution of the JPAs. However, there is a requirement for the JPA to make the finding that the financing would result in significant public benefit prior to bond. Background In 1978 Californians enacted Proposition 13, which limited the ability of local public agencies to increase property taxes based on a property‚Äôs assessed value. This change in law, combined with sharp cuts in federal aid to state and local governments, severely limited local government‚Äôs ability to fund public infrastructure. The Marks-Roos Bond Pooling Act was thus created with the intent of providing a flexible alternative method of financing needed improvements, along with the benefit of reduced borrowing costs through the use of bond pools.

She is married to the film director Fred Schepisi.  Background  Schepisi was born Mary Rubin into a Jewish family in New York City. Her father, the son of Polish immigrants, operated a company supplying industrial uniforms. Her mother migrated to the United States from England. Always supportive of Schepisi's interest in the arts, her parents enrolled her in the Art Students League of New York at the age of 10, where she came to study with many leading figures in the formative art movements of the 1960s, including the painters Jean Liberte and Milton Glasier. She attended Birch Wathen School on the Upper East Side and Boston University's College of Fine Arts. Schepisi spent her early career in the fashion and modeling industries. She has one sister, Leslie Slatkin, a nephew, William Slatkin, one son, Nicholas Schepisi, who currently works in film in New York, and six step-children.  Work  Schepisi's figurative-based works involve drawing, painting, collage, needlework and a range of mixed media applications. When signing her smaller works Schepisi on occasion uses the lower-case monogram \\"mrs\\". Her art practice is notable for the high level of engagement she pursues with her subject matter. From the political to the personal, covering topics from perestroika to domestic violence, Schepisi often develops a close working partnership with her subjects as each body of work takes shape. Schepisi's early work comprised small-scale pieces undertaken in her travels to film locations with her director-husband Fred Schepisi. One notable exhibition from these years was Glasnost/Perestroika (1990) shown in different configurations in London, Los Angeles and Melbourne, which was executed in 1989 during the shooting of The Russia House in Moscow, the first American production granted permission to film in the Soviet Union.The Washington Post, December 21, 1990 With access to many leading figures in Russian film circles, including Raisa Fomina, Masha Chugunova (assistant to Andrei Tarkovsky), the producer Leonid Vereschagin and the famed director Elem Klimov, the artist employed painting and collage‚Äîclipping reports in the morning newspaper and gathering ephemera from her daily travels in Moscow‚Äîto chronicle the rapidly changing cultural landscape under Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of perestroika.

In Speculations (2004), Schepisi asked a large number of women to write often highly personal biographical essays before painting their portraits.Mary Schepisi website The essays and paintings were then hung unmatched, leaving it to the viewer to connect each woman's life story to her portrait. In recent years Schepisi has turned to needlework to address both the personal and political from her strongly feminist perspective. The subject matter for these pieces varies widely, from images of handguns and household cleaning products to indigenous Australian iconography and text-based invectives.The Hook art review, February 22, 2010 A current work-in-progress entails a body of needlepoint revealing an exchange of imagined love letters sent between her Polish grandmother and the fictive Leipzig artist Johann Dieter Wassmann (1841‚Äì1898).

Memory is the faculty of the brain by which data or information is encoded, stored, and retrieved when needed. It is the retention of information over time for the purpose of influencing future action. If past events could not be remembered, it would be impossible for language, relationships, or personal identity to develop. Memory loss is usually described as forgetfulness or amnesia. Memory is often understood as an informational processing system with explicit and implicit functioning that is made up of a sensory processor, short-term (or working) memory, and long-term memory. This can be related to the neuron. The sensory processor allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli and attended to various levels of focus and intent. Working memory serves as an encoding and retrieval processor. Information in the form of stimuli is encoded in accordance with explicit or implicit functions by the working memory processor. The working memory also retrieves information from previously stored material. Finally, the function of long-term memory is to store data through various categorical models or systems. Declarative, or explicit, memory is the conscious storage and recollection of data. Under declarative memory resides semantic and episodic memory. Semantic memory refers to memory that is encoded with specific meaning, while episodic memory refers to information that is encoded along a spatial and temporal plane. Declarative memory is usually the primary process thought of when referencing memory. Non-declarative, or implicit, memory is the unconscious storage and recollection of information. An example of a non- declarative process would be the unconscious learning or retrieval of information by way of procedural memory, or a priming phenomenon. Priming is the process of subliminally arousing specific responses from memory and shows that not all memory is consciously activated, whereas procedural memory is the slow and gradual learning of skills that often occurs without conscious attention to learning. Memory is not a perfect processor, and is affected by many factors. The ways by which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved can all be corrupted. The amount of attention given new stimuli can diminish the amount of information that becomes encoded for storage. Also, the storage process can become corrupted by physical damage to areas of the brain that are associated with memory storage, such as the hippocampus. Finally, the retrieval of information from long-term memory can be disrupted because of decay within long-term memory. Normal functioning, decay over time, and brain damage all affect the accuracy and capacity of the memory. Sensory memory Sensory memory holds information, derived from the senses, less than one second after an item is perceived. The ability to look at an item and remember what it looked like with just a split second of observation, or memorization, is the example of sensory memory. It is out of cognitive control and is an automatic response. With very short presentations, participants often report that they seem to \\"see\\" more than they can actually report. The first experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were precisely conducted by George Sperling (1963) using the \\"partial report paradigm.\\" Subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters, arranged into three rows of four. After a brief presentation, subjects were then played either a high, medium or low tone, cuing them which of the rows to report. Based on these partial report experiments, Sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately 12 items, but that it degraded very quickly (within a few hundred milliseconds). Because this form of memory degrades so quickly, participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items (12 in the \\"whole report\\" procedure) before they decayed. This type of memory cannot be prolonged via rehearsal. Three types of sensory memories exist. Iconic memory is a fast decaying store of visual information, a type of sensory memory that briefly stores an image that has been perceived for a small duration. Echoic memory is a fast decaying store of auditory information, also a sensory memory that briefly stores sounds that have been perceived for short durations. Haptic memory is a type of sensory memory that represents a database for touch stimuli. Short-term memory Short-term memory is also known as working memory. Short-term memory allows recall for a period of several seconds to a minute without rehearsal. Its capacity, however, is very limited. In 1956, George A. Miller (1920-2012), when working at Bell Laboratories, conducted experiments showing that the store of short- term memory was 7¬±2 items. (Hence, the title of his famous paper, \\"The Magical Number 7¬±2.\\") Modern estimates of the capacity of short-term memory are lower, typically of the order of 4‚Äì5 items; however, memory capacity can be increased through a process called chunking. For example, in recalling a ten-digit telephone number, a person could chunk the digits into three groups: first, the area code (such as 123), then a three-digit chunk (456), and, last, a four-digit chunk (7890). This method of remembering telephone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits; this is because we are able to chunk the information into meaningful groups of numbers. This is reflected in some countries' tendencies to display telephone numbers as several chunks of two to four numbers. Short-term memory is believed to rely mostly on an acoustic code for storing information, and to a lesser extent on a visual code. Conrad (1964) found that test subjects had more difficulty recalling collections of letters that were acoustically similar, e.g., E, P, D. Confusion with recalling acoustically similar letters rather than visually similar letters implies that the letters were encoded acoustically. Conrad's (1964) study, however, deals with the encoding of written text; thus, while memory of written language may rely on acoustic components, generalizations to all forms of memory cannot be made. Long-term memory Olin Levi Warner, Memory (1896). Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building, Washington, D.C. The storage in sensory memory and short-term memory generally has a strictly limited capacity and duration, which means that information is not retained indefinitely. By contrast, long-term memory can store much larger quantities of information for potentially unlimited duration (sometimes a whole life span). Its capacity is immeasurable. For example, given a random seven-digit number, one may remember it for only a few seconds before forgetting, suggesting it was stored in short-term memory. On the other hand, one can remember telephone numbers for many years through repetition; this information is said to be stored in long-term memory. While short-term memory encodes information acoustically, long-term memory encodes it semantically: Baddeley (1966) discovered that, after 20 minutes, test subjects had the most difficulty recalling a collection of words that had similar meanings (e.g. big, large, great, huge) long-term. Another part of long-term memory is episodic memory, \\"which attempts to capture information such as 'what', 'when' and 'where. With episodic memory, individuals are able to recall specific events such as birthday parties and weddings. Short-term memory is supported by transient patterns of neuronal communication, dependent on regions of the frontal lobe (especially dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and the parietal lobe. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is maintained by more stable and permanent changes in neural connections widely spread throughout the brain. The hippocampus is essential (for learning new information) to the consolidation of information from short-term to long-term memory, although it does not seem to store information itself. It was thought that without the hippocampus new memories were unable to be stored into long-term memory and that there would be a very short attention span, as first gleaned from patient Henry Molaison after what was thought to be the full removal of both his hippocampi. More recent examination of his brain, post-mortem, shows that the hippocampus was more intact than first thought, throwing theories drawn from the initial data into question. The hippocampus may be involved in changing neural connections for a period of three months or more after the initial learning. Research has suggested that long-term memory storage in humans may be maintained by DNA methylation, and the 'prion' gene. =Multi-store model= right The multi-store model (also known as Atkinson‚ÄìShiffrin memory model) was first described in 1968 by Atkinson and Shiffrin. The multi-store model has been criticised for being too simplistic. For instance, long-term memory is believed to be actually made up of multiple subcomponents, such as episodic and procedural memory. It also proposes that rehearsal is the only mechanism by which information eventually reaches long-term storage, but evidence shows us capable of remembering things without rehearsal. The model also shows all the memory stores as being a single unit whereas research into this shows differently. For example, short-term memory can be broken up into different units such as visual information and acoustic information. In a study by Zlonoga and Gerber (1986), patient 'KF' demonstrated certain deviations from the Atkinson‚ÄìShiffrin model. Patient KF was brain damaged, displaying difficulties regarding short-term memory. Recognition of sounds such as spoken numbers, letters, words and easily identifiable noises (such as doorbells and cats meowing) were all impacted. Visual short-term memory was unaffected, suggesting a dichotomy between visual and audial memory. =Working memory= The working memory model In 1974 Baddeley and Hitch proposed a \\"working memory model\\" that replaced the general concept of short- term memory with an active maintenance of information in the short-term storage. In this model, working memory consists of three basic stores: the central executive, the phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad. In 2000 this model was expanded with the multimodal episodic buffer (Baddeley's model of working memory). The central executive essentially acts as an attention sensory store. It channels information to the three component processes: the phonological loop, the visuo-spatial sketchpad, and the episodic buffer. The phonological loop stores auditory information by silently rehearsing sounds or words in a continuous loop: the articulatory process (for example the repetition of a telephone number over and over again). A short list of data is easier to remember. The visuospatial sketchpad stores visual and spatial information. It is engaged when performing spatial tasks (such as judging distances) or visual ones (such as counting the windows on a house or imagining images). The episodic buffer is dedicated to linking information across domains to form integrated units of visual, spatial, and verbal information and chronological ordering (e.g., the memory of a story or a movie scene). The episodic buffer is also assumed to have links to long-term memory and semantical meaning. The working memory model explains many practical observations, such as why it is easier to do two different tasks (one verbal and one visual) than two similar tasks (e.g., two visual), and the aforementioned word-length effect. Working memory is also the premise for what allows us to do everyday activities involving thought. It is the section of memory where we carry out thought processes and use them to learn and reason about topics. Types Researchers distinguish between recognition and recall memory. Recognition memory tasks require individuals to indicate whether they have encountered a stimulus (such as a picture or a word) before. Recall memory tasks require participants to retrieve previously learned information. For example, individuals might be asked to produce a series of actions they have seen before or to say a list of words they have heard before. =By information type= Topographical memory involves the ability to orient oneself in space, to recognize and follow an itinerary, or to recognize familiar places. Getting lost when traveling alone is an example of the failure of topographic memory. Flashbulb memories are clear episodic memories of unique and highly emotional events.T.L. Brink (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. \\"Unit 7: Memory.\\" p. 120 People remembering where they were or what they were doing when they first heard the news of President Kennedy's assassination, the Sydney Siege or of 9/11 are examples of flashbulb memories. Anderson (1976) divides long-term memory into declarative (explicit) and procedural (implicit) memories.  Declarative  Declarative memory requires conscious recall, in that some conscious process must call back the information. It is sometimes called explicit memory, since it consists of information that is explicitly stored and retrieved. Declarative memory can be further sub-divided into semantic memory, concerning principles and facts taken independent of context; and episodic memory, concerning information specific to a particular context, such as a time and place. Semantic memory allows the encoding of abstract knowledge about the world, such as \\"Paris is the capital of France\\". Episodic memory, on the other hand, is used for more personal memories, such as the sensations, emotions, and personal associations of a particular place or time. Episodic memories often reflect the \\"firsts\\" in life such as a first kiss, first day of school or first time winning a championship. These are key events in one's life that can be remembered clearly. Research suggests that declarative memory is supported by several functions of the medial temporal lobe system which includes the hippocampus. Autobiographical memory ‚Äì memory for particular events within one's own life ‚Äì is generally viewed as either equivalent to, or a subset of, episodic memory. Visual memory is part of memory preserving some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. One is able to place in memory information that resembles objects, places, animals or people in sort of a mental image. Visual memory can result in priming and it is assumed some kind of perceptual representational system underlies this phenomenon.  Procedural  In contrast, procedural memory (or implicit memory) is not based on the conscious recall of information, but on implicit learning. It can best be summarized as remembering how to do something. Procedural memory is primarily used in learning motor skills and can be considered a subset of implicit memory. It is revealed when one does better in a given task due only to repetition ‚Äì no new explicit memories have been formed, but one is unconsciously accessing aspects of those previous experiences. Procedural memory involved in motor learning depends on the cerebellum and basal ganglia. A characteristic of procedural memory is that the things remembered are automatically translated into actions, and thus sometimes difficult to describe. Some examples of procedural memory include the ability to ride a bike or tie shoelaces. =By temporal direction= Another major way to distinguish different memory functions is whether the content to be remembered is in the past, retrospective memory, or in the future, prospective memory. Thus, retrospective memory as a category includes semantic, episodic and autobiographical memory. In contrast, prospective memory is memory for future intentions, or remembering to remember (Winograd, 1988). Prospective memory can be further broken down into event- and time-based prospective remembering. Time-based prospective memories are triggered by a time-cue, such as going to the doctor (action) at 4pm (cue). Event-based prospective memories are intentions triggered by cues, such as remembering to post a letter (action) after seeing a mailbox (cue). Cues do not need to be related to the action (as the mailbox/letter example), and lists, sticky-notes, knotted handkerchiefs, or string around the finger all exemplify cues that people use as strategies to enhance prospective memory. Study techniques =To assess infants= Infants do not have the language ability to report on their memories and so verbal reports cannot be used to assess very young children's memory. Throughout the years, however, researchers have adapted and developed a number of measures for assessing both infants' recognition memory and their recall memory. Habituation and operant conditioning techniques have been used to assess infants' recognition memory and the deferred and elicited imitation techniques have been used to assess infants' recall memory. Techniques used to assess infants' recognition memory include the following: * Visual paired comparison procedure (relies on habituation): infants are first presented with pairs of visual stimuli, such as two black-and-white photos of human faces, for a fixed amount of time; then, after being familiarized with the two photos, they are presented with the \\"familiar\\" photo and a new photo. The time spent looking at each photo is recorded. Looking longer at the new photo indicates that they remember the \\"familiar\\" one. Studies using this procedure have found that 5- to 6-month- olds can retain information for as long as fourteen days. * Operant conditioning technique: infants are placed in a crib and a ribbon that is connected to a mobile overhead is tied to one of their feet. Infants notice that when they kick their foot the mobile moves ‚Äì the rate of kicking increases dramatically within minutes. Studies using this technique have revealed that infants' memory substantially improves over the first 18-months. Whereas 2- to 3-month-olds can retain an operant response (such as activating the mobile by kicking their foot) for a week, 6-month-olds can retain it for two weeks, and 18-month-olds can retain a similar operant response for as long as 13 weeks. Techniques used to assess infants' recall memory include the following: * Deferred imitation technique: an experimenter shows infants a unique sequence of actions (such as using a stick to push a button on a box) and then, after a delay, asks the infants to imitate the actions. Studies using deferred imitation have shown that 14-month-olds' memories for the sequence of actions can last for as long as four months. * Elicited imitation technique: is very similar to the deferred imitation technique; the difference is that infants are allowed to imitate the actions before the delay. Studies using the elicited imitation technique have shown that 20-month-olds can recall the action sequences twelve months later. =To assess children and older adults= Researchers use a variety of tasks to assess older children and adults' memory. Some examples are: * Paired associate learning ‚Äì when one learns to associate one specific word with another. For example, when given a word such as \\"safe\\" one must learn to say another specific word, such as \\"green\\". This is stimulus and response. * Free recall ‚Äì during this task a subject would be asked to study a list of words and then later they will be asked to recall or write down as many words that they can remember, similar to free response questions. Earlier items are affected by retroactive interference (RI), which means the longer the list, the greater the interference, and the less likelihood that they are recalled. On the other hand, items that have been presented lastly suffer little RI, but suffer a great deal from proactive interference (PI), which means the longer the delay in recall, the more likely that the items will be lost.Baddeley, Alan D., \\"The Psychology of Memory\\", pp. 131‚Äì132, Basic Books, Inc., Publishers, New York, 1976, * Cued recall ‚Äì one is given a significant hints to help retrieve information that has been previously encoded into the person's memory; typically this can involve a word relating to the information being asked to remember.Goldstein, E. B. (2014). Cognitive psychology: Connecting mind, research and everyday experience. Nelson Education. This is similar to fill in the blank assessments used in classrooms. * Recognition ‚Äì subjects are asked to remember a list of words or pictures, after which point they are asked to identify the previously presented words or pictures from among a list of alternatives that were not presented in the original list. This is similar to multiple choice assessments. * Detection paradigm ‚Äì individuals are shown a number of objects and color samples during a certain period of time. They are then tested on their visual ability to remember as much as they can by looking at testers and pointing out whether the testers are similar to the sample, or if any change is present. * Savings method ‚Äì compares the speed of originally learning to the speed of relearning it. The amount of time saved measures memory. * Implicit-memory tasks ‚Äì information is drawn from memory without conscious realization. Failures The garden of oblivion, illustration by Ephraim Moses Lilien. * Transience ‚Äì memories degrade with the passing of time. This occurs in the storage stage of memory, after the information has been stored and before it is retrieved. This can happen in sensory, short- term, and long-term storage. It follows a general pattern where the information is rapidly forgotten during the first couple of days or years, followed by small losses in later days or years. * Absent-mindedness ‚Äì Memory failure due to the lack of attention. Attention plays a key role in storing information into long-term memory; without proper attention, the information might not be stored, making it impossible to be retrieved later.  Physiology  Brain areas involved in the neuroanatomy of memory such as the hippocampus, the amygdala, the striatum, or the mammillary bodies are thought to be involved in specific types of memory. For example, the hippocampus is believed to be involved in spatial learning and declarative learning, while the amygdala is thought to be involved in emotional memory. Damage to certain areas in patients and animal models and subsequent memory deficits is a primary source of information. However, rather than implicating a specific area, it could be that damage to adjacent areas, or to a pathway traveling through the area is actually responsible for the observed deficit. Further, it is not sufficient to describe memory, and its counterpart, learning, as solely dependent on specific brain regions. Learning and memory are usually attributed to changes in neuronal synapses, thought to be mediated by long- term potentiation and long-term depression. In general, the more emotionally charged an event or experience is, the better it is remembered; this phenomenon is known as the memory enhancement effect. Patients with amygdala damage, however, do not show a memory enhancement effect. Hebb distinguished between short-term and long-term memory. He postulated that any memory that stayed in short-term storage for a long enough time would be consolidated into a long-term memory. Later research showed this to be false. Research has shown that direct injections of cortisol or epinephrine help the storage of recent experiences. This is also true for stimulation of the amygdala. This proves that excitement enhances memory by the stimulation of hormones that affect the amygdala. Excessive or prolonged stress (with prolonged cortisol) may hurt memory storage. Patients with amygdalar damage are no more likely to remember emotionally charged words than nonemotionally charged ones. The hippocampus is important for explicit memory. The hippocampus is also important for memory consolidation. The hippocampus receives input from different parts of the cortex and sends its output out to different parts of the brain also. The input comes from secondary and tertiary sensory areas that have processed the information a lot already. Hippocampal damage may also cause memory loss and problems with memory storage. This memory loss includes retrograde amnesia which is the loss of memory for events that occurred shortly before the time of brain damage. Cognitive neuroscience Cognitive neuroscientists consider memory as the retention, reactivation, and reconstruction of the experience- independent internal representation. The term of internal representation implies that such a definition of memory contains two components: the expression of memory at the behavioral or conscious level, and the underpinning physical neural changes (Dudai 2007). The latter component is also called engram or memory traces (Semon 1904). Some neuroscientists and psychologists mistakenly equate the concept of engram and memory, broadly conceiving all persisting after-effects of experiences as memory; others argue against this notion that memory does not exist until it is revealed in behavior or thought (Moscovitch 2007). One question that is crucial in cognitive neuroscience is how information and mental experiences are coded and represented in the brain. Scientists have gained much knowledge about the neuronal codes from the studies of plasticity, but most of such research has been focused on simple learning in simple neuronal circuits; it is considerably less clear about the neuronal changes involved in more complex examples of memory, particularly declarative memory that requires the storage of facts and events (Byrne 2007). Convergence-divergence zones might be the neural networks where memories are stored and retrieved. Considering that there are several kinds of memory, depending on types of represented knowledge, underlying mechanisms, processes functions and modes of acquisition, it is likely that different brain areas support different memory systems and that they are in mutual relationships in neuronal networks: \\"components of memory representation are distributed widely across different parts of the brain as mediated by multiple neocortical circuits\\". * Encoding. Encoding of working memory involves the spiking of individual neurons induced by sensory input, which persists even after the sensory input disappears (Jensen and Lisman 2005; Fransen et al. 2002). Encoding of episodic memory involves persistent changes in molecular structures that alter synaptic transmission between neurons. Examples of such structural changes include long-term potentiation (LTP) or spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The persistent spiking in working memory can enhance the synaptic and cellular changes in the encoding of episodic memory (Jensen and Lisman 2005). * Working memory. Recent functional imaging studies detected working memory signals in both medial temporal lobe (MTL), a brain area strongly associated with long- term memory, and prefrontal cortex (Ranganath et al. 2005), suggesting a strong relationship between working memory and long-term memory. However, the substantially more working memory signals seen in the prefrontal lobe suggest that this area play a more important role in working memory than MTL (Suzuki 2007). * Consolidation and reconsolidation. Short-term memory (STM) is temporary and subject to disruption, while long-term memory (LTM), once consolidated, is persistent and stable. Consolidation of STM into LTM at the molecular level presumably involves two processes: synaptic consolidation and system consolidation. The former involves a protein synthesis process in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), whereas the latter transforms the MTL-dependent memory into an MTL-independent memory over months to years (Ledoux 2007). In recent years, such traditional consolidation dogma has been re-evaluated as a result of the studies on reconsolidation. These studies showed that prevention after retrieval affects subsequent retrieval of the memory (Sara 2000). New studies have shown that post-retrieval treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors and many other compounds can lead to an amnestic state (Nadel et al. 2000b; Alberini 2005; Dudai 2006). These findings on reconsolidation fit with the behavioral evidence that retrieved memory is not a carbon copy of the initial experiences, and memories are updated during retrieval. Genetics Study of the genetics of human memory is in its infancy though many genes have been investigated for their association to memory in humans and non-human animals. A notable initial success was the association of APOE with memory dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. The search for genes associated with normally varying memory continues. One of the first candidates for normal variation in memory is the protein KIBRA, which appears to be associated with the rate at which material is forgotten over a delay period. There has been some evidence that memories are stored in the nucleus of neurons. =Genetic underpinnings= Several genes, proteins and enzymes have been extensively researched for their association with memory. Long-term memory, unlike short- term memory, is dependent upon the synthesis of new proteins. This occurs within the cellular body, and concerns the particular transmitters, receptors, and new synapse pathways that reinforce the communicative strength between neurons. The production of new proteins devoted to synapse reinforcement is triggered after the release of certain signaling substances (such as calcium within hippocampal neurons) in the cell. In the case of hippocampal cells, this release is dependent upon the expulsion of magnesium (a binding molecule) that is expelled after significant and repetitive synaptic signaling. The temporary expulsion of magnesium frees NMDA receptors to release calcium in the cell, a signal that leads to gene transcription and the construction of reinforcing proteins.Neihoff, Debra (2005) \\"The Language of Life 'How cells Communicate in Health and Disease'\\" Speak Memory, 210‚Äì223. For more information, see long-term potentiation (LTP). One of the newly synthesized proteins in LTP is also critical for maintaining long-term memory. This protein is an autonomously active form of the enzyme protein kinase C (PKC), known as PKMŒ∂. PKMŒ∂ maintains the activity-dependent enhancement of synaptic strength and inhibiting PKMŒ∂ erases established long-term memories, without affecting short-term memory or, once the inhibitor is eliminated, the ability to encode and store new long-term memories is restored. Also, BDNF is important for the persistence of long-term memories. The long-term stabilization of synaptic changes is also determined by a parallel increase of pre- and postsynaptic structures such as axonal bouton, dendritic spine and postsynaptic density. On the molecular level, an increase of the postsynaptic scaffolding proteins PSD-95 and HOMER1c has been shown to correlate with the stabilization of synaptic enlargement. The cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is a transcription factor which is believed to be important in consolidating short-term to long-term memories, and which is believed to be downregulated in Alzheimer's disease. =DNA methylation and demethylation= Rats exposed to an intense learning event may retain a life-long memory of the event, even after a single training session. The long-term memory of such an event appears to be initially stored in the hippocampus, but this storage is transient. Much of the long-term storage of the memory seems to take place in the anterior cingulate cortex. When such an exposure was experimentally applied, more than 5,000 differently methylated DNA regions appeared in the hippocampus neuronal genome of the rats at one and at 24 hours after training. These alterations in methylation pattern occurred at many genes that were down-regulated, often due to the formation of new 5-methylcytosine sites in CpG rich regions of the genome. Furthermore, many other genes were upregulated, likely often due to hypomethylation. Hypomethylation often results from the removal of methyl groups from previously existing 5-methylcytosines in DNA. Demethylation is carried out by several proteins acting in concert, including the TET enzymes as well as enzymes of the DNA base excision repair pathway (see Epigenetics in learning and memory). The pattern of induced and repressed genes in brain neurons subsequent to an intense learning event likely provides the molecular basis for a long-term memory of the event. =Epigenetics= Studies of the molecular basis for memory formation indicate that epigenetic mechanisms operating in brain neurons play a central role in determining this capability. Key epigenetic mechanisms involved in memory include the methylation and demethylation of neuronal DNA, as well as modifications of histone proteins including methylations, acetylations and deacetylations. Stimulation of brain activity in memory formation is often accompanied by the generation of damage in neuronal DNA that is followed by repair associated with persistent epigenetic alterations. In particular the DNA repair processes of non-homologous end joining and base excision repair are employed in memory formation. In infancy Up until the mid-1980s it was assumed that infants could not encode, retain, and retrieve information. A growing body of research now indicates that infants as young as 6-months can recall information after a 24-hour delay. Furthermore, research has revealed that as infants grow older they can store information for longer periods of time; 6-month-olds can recall information after a 24-hour period, 9-month-olds after up to five weeks, and 20-month-olds after as long as twelve months. In addition, studies have shown that with age, infants can store information faster. Whereas 14-month-olds can recall a three-step sequence after being exposed to it once, 6-month-olds need approximately six exposures in order to be able to remember it. Although 6-month-olds can recall information over the short-term, they have difficulty recalling the temporal order of information. It is only by 9 months of age that infants can recall the actions of a two-step sequence in the correct temporal order ‚Äì that is, recalling step 1 and then step 2. In other words, when asked to imitate a two-step action sequence (such as putting a toy car in the base and pushing in the plunger to make the toy roll to the other end), 9-month-olds tend to imitate the actions of the sequence in the correct order (step 1 and then step 2). Younger infants (6-month-olds) can only recall one step of a two-step sequence. Researchers have suggested that these age differences are probably due to the fact that the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the frontal components of the neural network are not fully developed at the age of 6-months. In fact, the term 'infantile amnesia' refers to the phenomenon of accelerated forgetting during infancy. Importantly, infantile amnesia is not unique to humans, and preclinical research (using rodent models) provides insight into the precise neurobiology of this phenomenon. A review of the literature from behavioral neuroscientist Dr Jee Hyun Kim suggests that accelerated forgetting during early life is at least partly due to rapid growth of the brain during this period. Aging One of the key concerns of older adults is the experience of memory loss, especially as it is one of the hallmark symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. However, memory loss is qualitatively different in normal aging from the kind of memory loss associated with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's (Budson & Price, 2005). Research has revealed that individuals' performance on memory tasks that rely on frontal regions declines with age. Older adults tend to exhibit deficits on tasks that involve knowing the temporal order in which they learned information; source memory tasks that require them to remember the specific circumstances or context in which they learned information; and prospective memory tasks that involve remembering to perform an act at a future time. Older adults can manage their problems with prospective memory by using appointment books, for example. Gene transcription profiles were determined for the human frontal cortex of individuals from age 26 to 106 years. Numerous genes were identified with reduced expression after age 40, and especially after age 70. Genes that play central roles in memory and learning were among those showing the most significant reduction with age. There was also a marked increase in DNA damage, likely oxidative damage, in the promoters of those genes with reduced expression. It was suggested that DNA damage may reduce the expression of selectively vulnerable genes involved in memory and learning. Disorders Much of the current knowledge of memory has come from studying memory disorders, particularly amnesia. Loss of memory is known as amnesia. Amnesia can result from extensive damage to: (a) the regions of the medial temporal lobe, such as the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, subiculum, amygdala, the parahippocampal, entorhinal, and perirhinal cortices or the (b) midline diencephalic region, specifically the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus. There are many sorts of amnesia, and by studying their different forms, it has become possible to observe apparent defects in individual sub-systems of the brain's memory systems, and thus hypothesize their function in the normally working brain. Other neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease can also affect memory and cognition. Hyperthymesia, or hyperthymesic syndrome, is a disorder that affects an individual's autobiographical memory, essentially meaning that they cannot forget small details that otherwise would not be stored.Forgetfulness is the Key to a Healthy Mind. New Scientist, February 16. 2008. Korsakoff's syndrome, also known as Korsakoff's psychosis, amnesic- confabulatory syndrome, is an organic brain disease that adversely affects memory by widespread loss or shrinkage of neurons within the prefrontal cortex. While not a disorder, a common temporary failure of word retrieval from memory is the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon. Sufferers of Anomic aphasia (also called Nominal aphasia or Anomia), however, do experience the tip-of- the-tongue phenomenon on an ongoing basis due to damage to the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain. Influencing factors Interference can hamper memorization and retrieval. There is retroactive interference, when learning new information makes it harder to recall old information and proactive interference, where prior learning disrupts recall of new information. Although interference can lead to forgetting, it is important to keep in mind that there are situations when old information can facilitate learning of new information. Knowing Latin, for instance, can help an individual learn a related language such as French ‚Äì this phenomenon is known as positive transfer. Stress Stress has a significant effect on memory formation and learning. In response to stressful situations, the brain releases hormones and neurotransmitters (ex. glucocorticoids and catecholamines) which affect memory encoding processes in the hippocampus. Behavioural research on animals shows that chronic stress produces adrenal hormones which impact the hippocampal structure in the brains of rats. An experimental study by German cognitive psychologists L. Schwabe and O. Wolf demonstrates how learning under stress also decreases memory recall in humans. In this study, 48 healthy female and male university students participated in either a stress test or a control group. Those randomly assigned to the stress test group had a hand immersed in ice cold water (the reputable SECPT or 'Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test') for up to three minutes, while being monitored and videotaped. Both the stress and control groups were then presented with 32 words to memorize. Twenty-four hours later, both groups were tested to see how many words they could remember (free recall) as well as how many they could recognize from a larger list of words (recognition performance). The results showed a clear impairment of memory performance in the stress test group, who recalled 30% fewer words than the control group. The researchers suggest that stress experienced during learning distracts people by diverting their attention during the memory encoding process. However, memory performance can be enhanced when material is linked to the learning context, even when learning occurs under stress. A separate study by cognitive psychologists Schwabe and Wolf shows that when retention testing is done in a context similar to or congruent with the original learning task (i.e., in the same room), memory impairment and the detrimental effects of stress on learning can be attenuated. Seventy-two healthy female and male university students, randomly assigned to the SECPT stress test or to a control group, were asked to remember the locations of 15 pairs of picture cards ‚Äì a computerized version of the card game \\"Concentration\\" or \\"Memory\\". The room in which the experiment took place was infused with the scent of vanilla, as odour is a strong cue for memory. Retention testing took place the following day, either in the same room with the vanilla scent again present, or in a different room without the fragrance. The memory performance of subjects who experienced stress during the object- location task decreased significantly when they were tested in an unfamiliar room without the vanilla scent (an incongruent context); however, the memory performance of stressed subjects showed no impairment when they were tested in the original room with the vanilla scent (a congruent context). All participants in the experiment, both stressed and unstressed, performed faster when the learning and retrieval contexts were similar. This research on the effects of stress on memory may have practical implications for education, for eyewitness testimony and for psychotherapy: students may perform better when tested in their regular classroom rather than an exam room, eyewitnesses may recall details better at the scene of an event than in a courtroom, and persons suffering from post-traumatic stress may improve when helped to situate their memories of a traumatic event in an appropriate context. Stressful life experiences may be a cause of memory loss as a person ages. Glucocorticoids that are released during stress, damage neurons that are located in the hippocampal region of the brain. Therefore, the more stressful situations that someone encounters, the more susceptible they are to memory loss later on. The CA1 neurons found in the hippocampus are destroyed due to glucocorticoids decreasing the release of glucose and the reuptake of glutamate. This high level of extracellular glutamate allows calcium to enter NMDA receptors which in return kills neurons. Stressful life experiences can also cause repression of memories where a person moves an unbearable memory to the unconscious mind. This directly relates to traumatic events in one's past such as kidnappings, being prisoners of war or sexual abuse as a child. The more long term the exposure to stress is, the more impact it may have. However, short term exposure to stress also causes impairment in memory by interfering with the function of the hippocampus. Research shows that subjects placed in a stressful situation for a short amount of time still have blood glucocorticoid levels that have increased drastically when measured after the exposure is completed. When subjects are asked to complete a learning task after short term exposure they often have difficulties. Prenatal stress also hinders the ability to learn and memorize by disrupting the development of the hippocampus and can lead to unestablished long term potentiation in the offspring of severely stressed parents. Although the stress is applied prenatally, the offspring show increased levels of glucocorticoids when they are subjected to stress later on in life. Sleep Making memories occurs through a three-step process, which can be enhanced by sleep. The three steps are as follows: # Acquisition which is the process of storage and retrieval of new information in memory # Consolidation # Recall Sleep affects memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain's abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn't enhance every memory. It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. During sleep, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory. When one does not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower retention rate of memories. Sleep deprivation makes it harder to focus, resulting in inefficient learning. Furthermore, some studies have shown that sleep deprivation can lead to false memories as the memories are not properly transferred to long-term memory. One of the primary functions of sleep is thought to be the improvement of the consolidation of information, as several studies have demonstrated that memory depends on getting sufficient sleep between training and test. Additionally, data obtained from neuroimaging studies have shown activation patterns in the sleeping brain that mirror those recorded during the learning of tasks from the previous day, suggesting that new memories may be solidified through such rehearsal. Construction for general manipulation Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, this is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime.Schwarzel. M.& Mulluer. U., \\"Dynamic Memory Networks\\", \\"Cellular and Molecular Life Science\\", 2006 In fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed: \\"current hypotheses suggest that constructive processes allow individuals to simulate and imagine future episodes, happenings, and scenarios. Since the future is not an exact repetition of the past, simulation of future episodes requires a complex system that can draw on the past in a manner that flexibly extracts and recombines elements of previous experiences ‚Äì a constructive rather than a reproductive system.\\" People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them. To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked, \\"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\\" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \\"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\\" Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they had seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that they had seen broken glass than those who had been asked the question with hit. There was no broken glass depicted in the film. Thus, the wording of the questions distorted viewers' memories of the event. Importantly, the wording of the question led people to construct different memories of the event ‚Äì those who were asked the question with smashed recalled a more serious car accident than they had actually seen. The findings of this experiment were replicated around the world, and researchers consistently demonstrated that when people were provided with misleading information they tended to misremember, a phenomenon known as the misinformation effect. Research has revealed that asking individuals to repeatedly imagine actions that they have never performed or events that they have never experienced could result in false memories. For instance, Goff and Roediger (1998) asked participants to imagine that they performed an act (e.g., break a toothpick) and then later asked them whether they had done such a thing. Findings revealed that those participants who repeatedly imagined performing such an act were more likely to think that they had actually performed that act during the first session of the experiment. Similarly, Garry and her colleagues (1996) asked college students to report how certain they were that they experienced a number of events as children (e.g., broke a window with their hand) and then two weeks later asked them to imagine four of those events. The researchers found that one-fourth of the students asked to imagine the four events reported that they had actually experienced such events as children. That is, when asked to imagine the events they were more confident that they experienced the events. Research reported in 2013 revealed that it is possible to artificially stimulate prior memories and artificially implant false memories in mice. Using optogenetics, a team of RIKEN-MIT scientists caused the mice to incorrectly associate a benign environment with a prior unpleasant experience from different surroundings. Some scientists believe that the study may have implications in studying false memory formation in humans, and in treating PTSD and schizophrenia.\\"A mouse. A laser beam. A manipulated memory.\\" (video) ‚Äî the scientists' June 2013 TED talk. Memory reconsolidation is when previously consolidated memories are recalled or retrieved from long-term memory to your active consciousness. During this process, memories can be further strengthened and added to but there is also risk of manipulation involved. We like to think of our memories as something stable and constant when they are stored in long-term memory but this isn't the case. There are a large number of studies that found that consolidation of memories is not a singular event but are put through the process again, known as reconsolidation. This is when a memory is recalled or retrieved and placed back into your working memory. The memory is now open to manipulation from outside sources and the misinformation effect which could be due to misattributing the source of the inconsistent information, with or without an intact original memory trace (Lindsay and Johnson, 1989). One thing that can be sure is that memory is malleable. This new research into the concept of reconsolidation has opened the door to methods to help those with unpleasant memories or those that struggle with memories. An example of this is if you had a truly frightening experience and recall that memory in a less arousing environment, the memory will be weaken the next time it is retrieved. \\"Some studies suggest that over-trained or strongly reinforced memories do not undergo reconsolidation if reactivated the first few days after training, but do become sensitive to reconsolidation interference with time.\\" This, however does not mean that all memory is susceptible to reconsolidation. There is evidence to suggest that memory that has undergone strong training and whether or not is it intentional is less likely to undergo reconsolidation. There was further testing done with rats and mazes that showed that reactivated memories were more susceptible to manipulation, in both good and bad ways, than newly formed memories. It is still not known whether or not these are new memories formed and it's an inability to retrieve the proper one for the situation or if it's a reconsolidated memory. Because the study of reconsolidation is still a newer concept, there is still debate on whether it should be considered scientifically sound. Improving A UCLA research study published in the June 2008 issue of the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry found that people can improve cognitive function and brain efficiency through simple lifestyle changes such as incorporating memory exercises, healthy eating, physical fitness and stress reduction into their daily lives. This study examined 17 subjects, (average age 53) with normal memory performance. Eight subjects were asked to follow a \\"brain healthy\\" diet, relaxation, physical, and mental exercise (brain teasers and verbal memory training techniques). After 14 days, they showed greater word fluency (not memory) compared to their baseline performance. No long-term follow-up was conducted; it is therefore unclear if this intervention has lasting effects on memory. There are a loosely associated group of mnemonic principles and techniques that can be used to vastly improve memory known as the art of memory. The International Longevity Center released in 2001 a report which includes in pages 14‚Äì16 recommendations for keeping the mind in good functionality until advanced age. Some of the recommendations are to stay intellectually active through learning, training or reading, to keep physically active so to promote blood circulation to the brain, to socialize, to reduce stress, to keep sleep time regular, to avoid depression or emotional instability and to observe good nutrition. Memorization is a method of learning that allows an individual to recall information verbatim. Rote learning is the method most often used. Methods of memorizing things have been the subject of much discussion over the years with some writers, such as Cosmos Rossellius using visual alphabets. The spacing effect shows that an individual is more likely to remember a list of items when rehearsal is spaced over an extended period of time. In contrast to this is cramming: an intensive memorization in a short period of time. the spacing effect is exploited to improve memory in spaced repetition flashcard training. Also relevant is the Zeigarnik effect which states that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed ones. The so- called Method of loci uses spatial memory to memorize non-spatial information.  In plants  Plants lack a specialized organ devoted to memory retention, and so plant memory has been a controversial topic in recent years. New advances in the field have identified the presence of neurotransmitters in plants, adding to the hypothesis that plants are capable of remembering. Action potentials, a physiological response characteristic of neurons, have been shown to have an influence on plants as well, including in wound responses and photosynthesis. In addition to these homologous features of memory systems in both plants and animals, plants have also been observed to encode, store and retrieve basic short-term memories. One of the most well- studied plants to show rudimentary memory is the Venus flytrap. Native to the subtropical wetlands of the eastern United States, Venus Fly Traps have evolved the ability to obtain meat for sustenance, likely due to the lack of nitrogen in the soil. This is done by two trap-forming leaf tips that snap shut once triggered by a potential prey. On each lobe, three triggers hairs await stimulation. In order to maximize the benefit to cost ratio, the plant enables a rudimentary form of memory in which two trigger hairs must be stimulated within 30 seconds in order to result in trap closure. This system ensures that the trap only closes when potential prey is within grasp. The time lapse between trigger hair stimulations suggests that the plant can remember an initial stimulus long enough for a second stimulus to initiate trap closure. This memory isn't encoded in a brain, as plants lack this specialized organ. Rather, information is stored in the form of cytoplasmic calcium levels. The first trigger causes a subthreshold cytoplasmic calcium influx. This initial trigger isn't enough to activate trap closure, and so a subsequent stimulus allows for a secondary influx of calcium. The latter calcium rise superimposes on the initial one, creating an action potential that passes threshold, resulting in trap closure. Researchers, to prove that an electrical threshold must be met to stimulate trap closure, excited a single trigger hair with a constant mechanical stimulus using Ag/AgCl electrodes. The trap closed after only a few seconds. This experiment gave evidence to demonstrate that the electrical threshold, not necessarily the number of trigger hair stimulations, was the contributing factor in Venus Fly Trap memory. It has been shown that trap closure can be blocked using uncouplers and inhibitors of voltage-gated channels. After trap closure, these electrical signals stimulate glandular production of jasmonic acid and hydrolases, allowing for digestion of the prey. The field of plant neurobiology has gained a large amount of interest over the past decade, leading to an influx of research regarding plant memory. Although the Venus flytrap is one of the more highly studied, many other plants exhibit the capacity to remember, including the Mimosa pudica through an experiment conducted by Monica Gagliano and colleagues in 2013. To study the Mimosa pudica, Gagliano designed an appartus with which potted mimosa plants could be repeatedly dropped the same distance and at the same speed. It was observed that the plants defensive response of curling up its leaves decreased over the 60 times the experiment was repeated per plant. To confirm that this was a mechanism of memory rather than exhaustion, some of the plants were shaken post experiment and displayed normal defensive responses of leaf curling. This experiment also demonstrated long term memory in the plants, as it was repeated a month later and the plants were observed to remain unfazed by the dropping. As the field expands, it is likely that we will learn more about the capacity of a plant to remember.

Retrieved on March 18, 2011 History of establishment of State Council of Heraldry at the Parliament of Georgia  After restoration of statehood independence of Georgia (April 9, 1991), the necessity appeared to prepare heraldry and vexillology issues and to establish the relevant survey service. On the basis of the Resolution of December 16, 1993, the \\"Working Group on Proposals for State Symbols of Georgia\\" was established at the Parliament of Georgia. The aim of the group was to prepare the proposals on issues of alteration of the state symbols. On February 7, 1994, the \\"Working Group on Preparation of State Symbols of the Republic of Georgia\\" was established at the Government of the Republic of Georgia. The aim of this group was to submit own considerations and projects on elaboration of the new Constitution to the State Constitutional Commission. (The high officials of all Ministries and instances were involved in the above-mentioned group on the social basis). Thus, on August 19, 1994, the personal composition of the Commission on Martial Flag and Honor Awards of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Georgia was established and their action plan was ratified. The Commission was chaired by the Prime Minister of the country. On January 17, 1996, the Deputy-Chairman of the \\"Working Group on State Symbols of Georgia\\", Eldar Shengelaia, in his speech at the Parliament of Georgia, raised the question of establishment of the Standing State Heraldry Board at the President of Georgia. On August 12, 1996, the President issued the Decree \\"On Establishment of the State Commission on Symbols of Georgia\\". The Commission, chaired by the President of the country, was assigned to prepare and announce the contests on creation of the new state symbols, to provide public consideration and exposition of the contest material, to create the contest juries etc. The Commission was also assigned to prepare the issue for provision of united state policy in the sphere of heraldry, also to establish the standing State Heraldry Board in view of definition, usage and protection of the legal status of state symbols. In 1997, in view of elaboration of the state symbols of Georgia and provision of united state policy in the sphere of heraldry, the Infrastructure Group was established at the Parliament, which was assigned to jointly work with Commission on Symbols on state attributes. On August 12, 1996, the specialists of the Commission on State Symbols of Georgia established the NGO \\"Georgian Heraldry Society\\", working on symbol issues. On the basis of the Decree of the President of March 2, 2004, the \\"Temporary Commission on State Attributes and Proposals\\" was established, which provided holding of the contest on the state coat of arms. On August 14, 2004, in view to provide the unite state policy in the sphere of heraldry, to define the legal status of state symbols, to use and protect thereof, the Heraldry Commission at the President of Georgia was established in accordance with the Decree of the President ‚Ññ 333, on the basis of which, with the Resolution of the Parliament of Georgia of February 29, 2008 (‚Ññ 5778-IR), the State Heraldry Council at the Parliament of Georgia was established. The Council is the standing authority, facilitating conduct of unite state policy on heraldry issues in the country.  The primary tasks and objectives of the State Heraldry Council  The primary tasks of the State Heraldry Council are as follows: a) elaboration of the proposals on state symbols; b) elaboration of the proposals on usage of state symbols; c) participation in creation of the symbols of Abkhazia and Ajara Autonomous Republics and Self-governance Units and definition of usage rules thereof, also elaboration of corresponding recommendations; d) elaboration of the proposals on creation and usage of the state symbols and the differential signs; e) heraldic expert examination of the state symbols and the differential signs and preparation of the corresponding conclusions on creation and usage thereof; f) consideration of the draft normative acts on inculcation of the new state symbols and differential signs and preparation of the corresponding conclusion; g) issue of heraldic material within the scope of own competence; h) promotion of state symbols and significance thereof in the country; i) improvement and support of the official site of the State Heraldry Council; j) solution of other issues, related to regulation of state symbols; k) implementation of other tasks, imposed under the legislation of Georgia and the hereby provisions.

It was originally released for the Neo Geo MVS arcade cabinet on July 28, 1992. It is ADK's first game in the fighting game genre, as well as their earliest attempt in the fighting game trend of the '90s that was popularized by Capcom's 1991 arcade-hit Street Fighter II. It was even the last game with the \\"Alpha\\" logo labeled within the game before the developer became \\"ADK\\"; however, the \\"Alpha\\" logo was last used on one of the arcade flyers of its sequel. Due to its success in the market, World Heroes was followed by a sequel released less than a year later titled World Heroes 2.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot showcasing Hanz≈ç Hattori performing a throw with Kim Dragon. World Heroes is controlled with three of the four buttons (\\"A\\" to punch, \\"B\\" to kick and \\"C\\" to throw) used along with an 8-way joystick on the Neo Geo MVS arcade cabinet. The punches and kicks have two levels, weak and strong. In order to get each strength with just two buttons, the punch and kick buttons have to be pressed briefly for weak and longer for strong. This same mechanic even can be performed with special moves. The throw button C, if close enough to the opponent, grabs and throws the opponent across the stage; however, if holding the joystick in the opposite direction at the right time, the opponent would be tossed the opposite direction. Introduced in the fighting game genre by World Heroes are some abilities exclusive to some characters that were used in several later fighting games, such as multi-jumping using Hanzou and Fuuma, and shooting projectiles from the air using Rasputin. There are eight playable characters in the roster and two different play modes for players to choose from: \\"Normal Game\\" and \\"Death Match\\". In \\"Normal Game\\", players have to defeat the other seven playable characters in a random order, followed by a battle against the final boss Geegus (misspelled as \\"Gee Gus\\" in localized English versions), all by using the chosen character. If the player defeats an opponent, the player moves on to the next opponent. After the third battle, the player has a bonus round to carve a block of stone into a statue in ten seconds with repeated hits. After the sixth battle, the player has another bonus round to break falling pots in ten seconds before they hit the ground. \\"Death Match\\" acts like Normal Mode with a difference. Players will fight in a ring with environmental hazards such as electrical barriers, spiked walls, oil puddles and others which players must avoid while fighting. Players also can force their opponents against the environmental hazards to their advantage. Also, unlike the normal game where battles take place in various locations, all death match battles take place in a closed boxing-esque arena setting, and take place in front of a live audience. Plot In the distant future, Dr. Sugar Brown: a well-renowned and famous scientist is determined to figure out on who the strongest fighter of history is and has gone to great lengths in order to finally gain the answer of his own question. Through the use of a time machine that he had built, Dr. Brown has brought together eight fighters from the distant past (each of whom are based on actual historical figures) so that all of them can compete and take part in a fighting tournament that Dr. Brown has organized, the tournament itself being used as a way to determine on who the strongest fighter of history is. Little does Dr. Brown and the participating fighters know and realize that an unknown threat is secretly watching them during the progression of the tournament and that this unknown threat could easily endanger them and the rest of the world.

Whelan (July 27, 1933 ‚Äì December 1, 2012) was a journalist and historian who served as the first editor in chief of The Washington Times, holding the position from 1982 to 1984. He is also known as the author of several books, most of them on the recent political history of Latin America. He was born in Buffalo, New York. Early career Whelan began a career in journalism in 1952, much of it spent in Latin America including Chile, Venezuela, and Mexico. He started as a local correspondent for United Press International (UPI). In 1964, while UPI manager for Venezuela, he was named a Nieman Fellow. He later served as managing editor of The Miami News. He graduated from Florida International University in 1975 with a bachelor's degree. He served as vice president and editor of The Sacramento Union. The Washington Times In 1982 Whelan resigned from The Sacramento Union to work at the newly created Washington Times, serving as its first editor in chief and publisher. It was owned by the News World Communications, at which Whelan was later made an executive, which is affiliated with the Unification Church, although Whelan himself is not a member of the church. Whelen had initially rejected the offer to work at the new publication, but a persistent recruiting effort from Colonel Bo Hi Pak eventually changed his mind. In response to concerns over its church associations, Whelan promised the paper would be independent, citing a contract that promised autonomy. At a National Press Club luncheon in 1983, he complained about the sloppiness and hypocrisy of complaints made about the relationship with the church, stating that he himself had met the church's leader Sun Myung Moon only twice. In 1984 Whelan unexpectedly left the paper. At a news conference, Whelan claimed that \\"senior members of the Unification Church Movement‚Äîthe so-called Moonies‚Äîhave seized direct control\\" of The Washington Times, and that this led to his sacking by Bo Hi Pak. Smith Hempstone, Whelan's successor, denied this, saying that a group of executives and editors, none of whom were members of the church, felt Whelan's removal would be better for the paper's \\"continued integrity.\\" Later career After leaving the Times, Whelan worked for the Latin American News Service. He lived in Chile, serving as visiting professor at the University of Chile and writing on the nation's history. In 2008 he moved back to the United States and lived in Miami. Death He died of multiple organ failure at 79, at his home in Miami, Florida. Bibliography * Allende, Death of a Marxist Dream.

He was especially known as a television comedian, but also performed in theatres, on radio, and in about thirty movies. He was nicknamed \\"Il Re della barzelletta\\" (\\"the King of jokes\\") for his burlesque comic style, which was largely based on his skill at telling funny stories. His jokes were sometimes as quick as a cut and thrust, and bordering on surrealism. They have been collected in a series of books, such as 50 chili fa (\\"50 kilos ago\\", a collection he published after dieting). Gino Bramieri in 1971 Bramieri was born in Milan, Italy, into a humble family. He made his stage debut in 1943, with the prose company in prose of Egisto Olivieri. He later graduated in accountancy at night school. In 1948 he got married and had a son. Bramieri's career was launched by Erminio Macario, who entered him in his revue company in 1949. In his career, he has performed together with many prominent Italian comedians and actors, including Franco Franchi and Ciccio Ingrassia, Peppino De Filippo, Aldo Fabrizi, Ave Ninchi, Nino Taranto, Raimondo Vianello, Renato Rascel, and Tot√≤. His career in television reached its apex in the 1960s‚Äì1970s, with RAI television shows such as Tigre contro tigre, Il signore ha suonato?, E noi qui and others; in the 1980s, he conducted a show named after him, the Gino Bramieri show (aka G.B.

He built the Fifth Avenue Hotel and many other developments on the streets of Broadway and Fifth Avenue, where he established a prominent family fortune of 20 to 40 million U.S dollars. Early life Amos Richards Eno was born November 1, 1810, in Simsbury, Connecticut. Business ventures Amos R. Eno began his career as a merchant of dry goods who expanded into real estate in New York City having built the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City and much valuable real estate in New York City where he established a prominent family fortune. Having clerked in a small general store in Hartford, Connecticut, he married Lucy Phelps, also of Simsbury, and moved to New York, where he and his cousin John Jay Phelps opened a profitable dry goods business. While making a fortune in the dry goods business, Amos Eno parlayed his profits into real estate investment in Manhattan, New York, buying corner lots and occasionally full undeveloped city blocks. His brownstone-fronted store at 74 Broadway had the reputation of having been the first use of brownstone in the city. Retiring from active participation as a merchant, he concentrated in 1856‚Äì59 in building the famous Fifth Avenue Hotel at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street in Madison Square, Manhattan, and the adjacent Madison Square Theatre in 1863. North of Madison Square, Eno built a brick four-storey house at 233 Fifth Avenue, between 26th and 27th Streets, that served as his residence for many years. In April 1890, Eno sold it to The Reform Club for $240,000 (). Anson Phelps Stokes was in 1888 its founding president. Before moving into Eno's mansion, the club had been located at 12 East 33rd Street. The structure at 233 Fifth Avenue, still much in its original form, currently is the home of the Museum of Sex. Eno and relatives, in April 1882, chartered the Second National Bank of New York, headquartered in the hotel. In 1884 scandal hit the family bank when one of Amos' sons, John Chester Eno, president of the bank, embezzled millions of dollars and then fled to Canada to avoid prosecution. Eno never closed the bank, though three to four million dollars were withdrawn in panic, and made good his son's embezzlement, \\"though he never recovered from the shock\\". He held the greater part of a full block facing Broadway in Longacre Square (now Times Square). His last real estate speculations were in open lots in the Upper West Side. Retirement After settling his son's debts, Amos retreated to the family summer residence in Simsbury, the Amos Eno House (1820, on the National Register of Historic Places) which had been erected by Eno's father-in-law, Elisha Phelps. Every summer the Eno family would visit the house, which was enlarged by Eno and by his daughter Antoinette Eno Wood. He was a founding benefactor of the Simsbury Free Library, among other local philanthropic gestures. Death and estate Amos R. Eno died February 21, 1898. At time of his death his wealth was evaluated from 20 to 40 million dollars. Notes Eno's portrait by Eastman Johnson, commissioned by his family in 1899, was a posthumous one, based on photographs; it is conserved in the New York State Museum.New York State Museum: Portrait of Amos R.

The service distributed games and related media online, with a primary focus on small independent game developers rather than larger companies. Desura contained automated game updates, community features, and developer resources. The client allowed users to create and distribute game mods as well. Many independent developers (for example Scott Cawthon) and small companies published their content on Desura including Frozenbyte, Frictional Games, Introversion Software, Basilisk Games, S2 Games, Linux Game Publishing, RuneSoft, Running with Scissors, Interplay Entertainment, and Double Fine Productions. Desura sold many games that were previously included in Humble Bundle initiatives, as well as numerous other commercial titles. Desura also provided several freeware and free software games. Originally, the platform was developed by DesuraNET; it was later sold to Linden Lab, and then to Bad Juju Games, which filed for bankruptcy in June 2015. In October 2016, Desura was acquired by Danish company OnePlay a subscription-based online rental service intending to relaunch Desura. Desura's website is currently down, as is OnePlay.com.  Features  The Desura client was tied to its website through the use of the Chromium Embedded Framework. Most of its services were provided through its online interface, with the exception of the game launcher, installer, and update features. This means that the Desura interface remained consistent across multiple platforms. The interface itself offered various selections based on what feature a user may want to access, with installed games being offered through the \\"Play\\" tab, games available for download or purchase being offered through the \\"Games\\" tab, user interaction and social networking features from the \\"Community\\" tab, information and features for game developers through the \\"Development\\" tab, and technical support and client settings through the \\"Support\\" tab. Desura did not implement digital rights management, and Desura employees have commented against its use in the past, recommending that content creators ship without DRM or use a CD Key system instead. However, Desura itself was DRM-neutral, and publishers and developers could sell games that require such technologies to be used. Desura made sure users purchasing these titles are aware of the DRM it ships with and how it works. = Competitors = Desura competed in the same market as Valve's Steam platform. However, Scott Reismanis, the founder of DesuraNET, did not consider it a competitor, but rather an attempt to address a different segment of the market. Desura primarily hosted indie games, which are games by smaller developers who do not have enough popularity or power to negotiate deals with Steam. Desura believed that its tighter links to a dedicated community would foster better relationships between players and developers. Desura used to be tied to the Mod DB community, as both were run by the same company. Desura therefore highlighted content distribution for mods as one of its features.  History  Desura was initially developed in secret by DesuraNET for many years. The project was first publicly announced on December 16, 2009. Near its launch, it publicized itself by offering free keys for games to augment the purchases of the same games made through Humble Indie Bundle #2. The Desura Windows client was released to the public on December 18, 2010. On July 10, 2013, Desura was bought by Linden Lab. = Linux support = Development on a Linux client was announced during the Summer of 2011, utilizing wxWidgets and GTK+ as the toolkit, and was introduced as a limited beta program in the Fall. The client was publicly available for download and execution, but users could not log into the online service unless they were a selected beta tester. On November 16, 2011 the Desura Linux client was publicly released with an initial offering of over 65 games. (Desurium on GitHub) Although Desura was not the only game distribution platform available for Linux, predated by several traditional online sellers such as Tux Games, Gameolith and Wupra, as well as many Linux distributions distributing games through their package management systems, Desura was the first and most prominent purely digital Linux game distributor with a dedicated client delivery application. The Ubuntu Software Center began selling commercial software packages just prior to the Linux Desura client release, but was not specialized for games, offering a substantially smaller catalog. = Source release = On November 9, 2011 it was announced that Desura would be made partially free software in order to facilitate its further development. The client itself would be released under the GNU General Public License, while the server-side portion of the distribution platform would remain proprietary. The media assets and trademarks would also remain property of DesuraNET. The free software release and development was handled in a manner similar to Google's Chromium project. The free project, named \\"Desurium\\", was publicly made available on January 21, 2012. = Ownership changes = On July 10, 2013, Linden Lab announced that they had acquired Desura. The service would continue uninterrupted for current customers and the team and technology become a part of Linden Lab. After acquiring Desura, Linden Lab changed their Terms of Service to include the wording that they have future rights to use and adapt content from their virtual citizens. It was announced on November 5, 2014 that Linden Lab had sold the Desura service to Bad Juju Games. Bad Juju later filed for bankruptcy in June 2015. The Desura service went offline on March 19, 2016, but came back on March 29. Desura went offline again in September 2016, and has remained disconnected since then. On October 28, 2016, the desura.com home page showed the following message: \\"OnePlay has recently bought the Desura and Royale assets from Bad Juju. We are working hard behind the scenes to relaunch your favorite indie gaming platform.\\" The change in ownership news is dated October 21, 2016.

He was a member of the van Valckenborch dynasty of painters who painted mainly landscapes. Unlike his family members, he is mainly known for his large-scale compositions with many swirling figures depicting scenes from ancient history or mythology.Gillis van Valckenborch, The marriage of Peleus and Thetis at Lempertz While his landscape drawings evidence his interest in landscape art no landscape paintings have been attributed to him.K. Goossens, Gillis van Valckenborch in the Nationaal Biografisch Woordenboek, IV, p. 849 Life Gillis van Valckenborch was born into a well-known family of artists. Fourteen known painters are recorded in the family history. Of these, his father Marten van Valckenborch (1535-1612), his brother Frederik van Valckenborch and his uncle Lucas van Valckenborch the elder achieved notable fame as painters.Alexander Wied and Hans Devisscher. \\"Valckenborch, van.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 25 February 2016 The van Valckenborch family was particularly known in the Spanish Netherlands for landscape painting. The marriage of Peleus and Thetis Originally from Leuven, Marten van Valckenborch moved to Antwerp in the 1560s. Like many other families in the region who had become Calvinists, Marten moved with his family from the Spanish-occupied Spanish Netherlands to the more liberal environment of Frankfurt am Main, which was a German imperial outpost. The van Valckenborchs thrived in their new home town, quickly establishing themselves as authorities in the arts. They had an important influence on the artistic developments in Frankfurt am Main.Alexander Wied, \\"Marten van Valckenborch I\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 26 February 2016 Gillis van Valckenborch received his earliest training in Antwerp possibly from his brother Frederik. It is believed Gillis and his brother Frederik travelled to Italy in 1590‚Äì1592, although there is no evidence for this trip other than a drawing of an Italian landscape by Gillis.Hans Devisscher. \\"Valckenborch, van.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 26 February 2016 On 4 October 1596 or 1597 Gillis van Valckenborch married Barbara van Hilden of Frankfurt. The couple had many children of whom their son Gillis the younger became a painter. Gillis the elder was accepted as a burgher of Frankfurt am Main on 24 February 1597. Just like his brother Frederik he was required to undergo a theological test before he was admitted as a burgher since they were suspected of being Gnesio-Lutherans. He remained active in his adopted hometown where he died. Work Gillis van Valckenborch left only seven fully signed and dated paintings. His Defeat of Sanherib in the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum is one of his fully signed paintings. His known oeuvre of about 40 works has been attributed on the basis of his few signed paintings.Gillis van Valckenborch, Banquet of the Gods at Dorotheum He worked in a late Mannerist style.Gillis van Valckenborch at Sotheby's Fire in a Village Gillis van Valckenborch painted biblical and mythological scenes and figures, as well as protagonists from Greek and Roman history set in landscapes. Gillis van Valckenborch's many large-scale compositions are populated by an abundance of dynamic figures. Most of his surviving works are on large canvases of an oblong format, a type also favoured by his uncle Lucas.Gillis van Valckenborch, The wedding of Neptune and Amphitrite at Sotheby's A characteristic feature of his work is the lively colouring, for which he primarily used pink and light blue hues.Gillis van Valckenborch (Antwerp c. 1570‚Äì1622 Frankfurt am Main), The Return of Jephthah at Dorotheum He often returned to the theme of the Feast of the Gods. The most famous rendering of this theme is kept in the collection of Count Sch√∂nborn-Wiesentheit in Pommersfelden castle. He drew inspiration from the innovative works by the School of Prague such as Bartholomeus Spranger and the movement of international Mannerism. Two pendant works depicting a scene of a fire in a village in the National Gallery of Slovenia have been attributed to van Valckenborch based on the traditional record Valkenburg, with which the paintings were catalogued in the Landesbildergalerie in Graz, on the style, and also on the motif. The paintings show close affinity with Gillis' signed painting of \\"The Rescuing of the Israelites in the stadium of Alexandria\\" in the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum in the presentation of the forms and in the brushwork, which interprets motifs and models of northern Mannerism. It is not entirely clear what the pendant paintings depict, whether it is some historical event, or that they have some moral meaning such as fire as punishment for the sinners carousing in the tavern in one of the paintings. That fire was one of his favourite motifs is testified by a lost painting said to have depicted The Burning of Troy, which was also in the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum until 1714.Gillis van Valckenborch, Fire in a village at the National Gallery of Slovenia Notes Temple of Sybil in Tivoli External links 1570 births 1622 deaths Flemish Renaissance painters Flemish history painters Artists from Antwerp Artists from Frankfurt ","title":"Gillis van Valckenborch"},{"id":"31218188","text":"Clive Parker with Big Country 1981 Clive Parker (born 1960) also known as Clive Parker-Sharp, is an English drummer, active in the punk, post-punk and new wave genres.

According to their mission statement, Ginbot 7's goal is \\"the realization of a national political system in which government power and political authority is assumed through peaceful and democratic process based on the free will and choice of citizens of the country.\\" According to the US State Department Human Rights report of 2011, Ginbot 7 \\"espouses violent overthrow of the (Ethiopian) government\\"..

Patriotic Ginbot 7 Movement for Unity and Democracy Ginbot 7 allied with many political organizations and freedom movements. In October 2016 it signed an understanding to work with Afar Peoples Party, Sidama Peoples Democratic Movement, Tigray Peoples Democratic Movement (TPDM) and Oromo Democratic Front (ODF).https://ethsat.com/2016/10/newly-formed-movement-hope-regime-change- ethiopia/ On January 2015 it signed a unification agreement with Ethiopian Peoples Patriotic Front, the first movement that stood on Eritrean soil to make a military struggle to overthrow the EPRDF/TPLF government. Before 2015 the EPPF Movement was led by Meazaw Getu as Chairman, Mengistu W/Sillasie as Political Head, Kifetew Assefa as Head of Intelligence and Information and Nurjeba Assefa as Foreign Affairs Head. Ginbot 7 at the time had Berhanu Nega as Chairman, Abebe Bogale as Vice Chair, and Ameneshewa Tahelew a.k.a. Assefa Maru as Head of Military Operations before the unification.https://www.tesfanews.net/ethiopia-ginbot-7-and-eppf-military- wings-merged/ After unification their name changed to 'Patriotic Ginbot 7 Movement for Unity and Democracy'. From the unification afterwards a new committee of 82 members with 41 members from each Front was formed. And a new executive committee with Berhanu Nega as a Chairman, Meazaw Getu as Vice Chair, Zemene Kassie as Political Head and Ameneshewa Tahelew a.k.a. Assefa Maru as Head of Military Operations. This unification was fruitful and in the interest of many Ethiopians. It brought some hope in the Ethiopian camp at the time of hopelessness and oppression (especially after the kidnapping of the Ginbot 7 Secretary General Andargachew Tsige while transiting through Yemen). As the objective of these two movements was the same, their unification was natural. Ginbot 7 was much of a collection of active politician's that fled Ethiopia in fear of persecution and some even having a death sentence on their head.. Ethiopian Peoples Patriotic Front leaders and members, on the other hand, spent their lives in the front for decades, having a well-tested military skill and determination. After unification the Movement was getting stronger as the people's resistance in Ethiopia was becoming strong and fierce against the government. In the middle of the chaotic situation in Ethiopia in Nehase 2009 E.C. the Patriotic Ginbot 7 Movement for Unity and Democracy has made a leadership change. It also asserted a three-year plan to overthrow the TPLF/EPRDF government. The new central committee of the Movement has 13 members.

It can be used as a therapy for children with limited communication skills. \\"Sensory Room\\" is an umbrella term used to categorize a broad variety of therapeutic spaces specifically designed and utilized to promote self-organization and positive change. There are multiple types of sensory rooms and purposes for use that have been created and implemented in different practice areas to date. When used appropriately, sensory rooms: *Help to create a safe space *Facilitate the therapeutic alliance *Provide opportunities for engagement in prevention and crisis de- escalation strategies, as well as a host of other therapeutic exchanges (to teach skills, offer a variety of therapeutic activities, etc.) * Promote self- care/self-nurturance, resilience & recovery  History  Ad Verheul The history of the sensory room dates back to the Netherlands' in the late 1970s and was invented by psychologists Ad Verheul and Jan Hulsegge. The original name for sensory rooms was, 'snoezelen' and originated from a fusion of the two Dutch words, 'snuffelen' which means to sniff and 'doezelen' which means to doze or snooze. Over time this term has evolved to sensory room, multi- sensory room, and multi-sensory environments (MSE). Originally, Verheul and Hulsegge worked together with individuals suffering from severe disabilities in an institution. The idea behind the sensory room was to provide an environment in which an individual can be exposed to various different forms of stimuli to awaken and release sensory perception. The concept and usage of the sensory room has spread across Europe and the United States in the past fifty years to treat individuals with various different disabilities, disorders, and conditions.  Equipment  Sensory rooms are often stocked full of many different types of equipment. This equipment is used to assist students in focusing on the present moment and to better process sensory information. Stocked equipment may be provided for balance and movement (trampolines, balance bars, swings), calming pressure (blankets, stuffed animals), or fidgeting behavior (fidget spinners, puzzles). Sensory Fidget Equipment Multi-sensory equipment is a vital and effective part in the treatment of sensory disorders with children and adults alike. Some examples include: projectors and effect wheels, bubble tubes, music equipment, fibre optics, vibrating devices, aroma diffusers and sound equipment. Many schools have \\"Sensory Kits\\" which are personalized items of sensory stimulating equipment that are meaningful to the owner. These kits are held in Sensory Rooms as bins, boxes, bags, etc. to be used for preventative purposes and for any crisi that may occur. These kits are also used to help children create self organization skills that can increase cognitive processes and future life skills. Multi-sensory room Sensory equipment can help develop key life skills including vocalization, gross motor skills, color recognition and tracking. Examples include sensory rooms, sensory pools, sensory bathrooms, and sensory gardens. They are also sometimes called \\"multi sensory room\\", \\"white room\\", or \\"quiet room\\".  Benefits  The benefits of sensory rooms haven't been researched that much, however, there are significant ways that sensory rooms can help many. The main benefit of sensory rooms is that they are a humane and effective way for individuals to manage their stress levels. They can also help to manage negative thoughts and emotions. Sensory rooms can be beneficial for those that have a history of aggression, because they can be useful in de- escalating aggressive behavior. Adults that have an intellectual disability can use multi-sensory environments to allow emotional exploration and the chance to seek different kinds of stimulation, which can possibly be therapeutic. Relaxation is an important aspect of sensory rooms, and the different variables of multi-sensory rooms can possibly help reduce different kinds of problem behavior in patients. Hospice care patients can benefit from using sensory environments because they can enhance their end-of-life experience. These environments introduce a variety of new and familiar routines that include the five different senses.  Dementia  Dementia is a problem that impacts many people as they grow old after all our memories are not going to be what they used to be in our youth. One of the interesting ways that sensory rooms are being utilized is with patients with Dementia. Sensory information is helpful in improving the quality of life for people who have dementia and potentially other memory problems. In a recent study they tested out various forms of Multi-sensory therapies. They found that there were positive effects for those with issues with agitation. They were able to help reduce agitation but there was no deeper healing from having dementia patients spend time in a sensory room. Not all studies were in support of using sensory rooms for those suffering from dementia. In a recent study they found that the use of sensory rooms was not able to bridge the gap between academic information and implementation of new information. This impacted the view of nursing home staff and they became reluctant to let the residents use them. With varying outcomes, we cannot make a solid judgment on whether or not sensory rooms impact dementia in a positive way for all patients.

Purpose  While the idea for a European network such as this was first proposed by the Council of Europe, it became an independent association in 1995 and groups a wide variety of members together some with extensive experience and others which have been relatively recently created or organized. This diversity fosters a network with a wide range of abilities which facilitates the exchange of ideas and pools experience from various bodies in related fields.  Improving Public Administration  One of the primary purposes behind ENTO lies in the strengthening of local democracy which is essential for democratic society. As a result of its work, fundamental reforms have been implemented in many European countries. These have created greater efficiency of officials and elected representatives at all levels of government starting at the local level. The reforms have also helped to support both the Council of Europe (more particularly the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe) and the European Union initiatives and efforts to improve public administration throughout Europe but particularly in Central and Eastern Europe.

Research  Sagvolden's research career started with his work for his PhD, which he obtained in 1979 from the University of Oslo based on a thesis entitled Behavioral Changes in Rats with Septal Lesions: Effects of Water- Deprivation Level and Intensity of Electrical Shocks. Sagvolden is best known for the discovery that the SHR rat strain is hyperactive. Over the next decades, he then went on to demonstrate that this strain is a valid animal model for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Subsequently, Sagvolden also showed that the WKY/NCrl rat strain showed inattention, but no impulsivity or hyperactivity, and validated this strain as an animal model of inattentive ADHD. Over the course of his career, Sagvolden worked not only with rats, but also with humans and pigeons.  Editorial activities  Sagvolden was the founding editor-in-chief of the scientific journal Behavioral and Brain Functions, from the time of its establishment in 2005 to his death in 2011. In 1989 he co-edited, together with Trevor Archer, a book summarizing current research on ADHD, followed in 1998 by a special issue on ADHD for Behavioural Brain Research.  Community service  Sagvolden was a member at large of the executive committee of the European Brain and Behaviour Society from 1986-1989 and its secretary from 1990 to 1995. Over the last two decades of his life, he was an active supporter of the Society of Neuroscientists of Africa (SONA) and in 1993 played a significant role in its founding. He was subsequently member of SONA's International Advisory Committee and an official internal adviser from 1999-2004. In 2000, Sagvolden organized the first IBRO school in Africa at the University of the North (Pietersburg, South Africa). In addition, Sagvolden was one of the \\"founding fathers\\" of the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies, where he represented Norway on the council from the foundation of the federation until his death. Outside of the scientific community, Sagvolden was also active in local politics. He was a member of the Lier municipal council for the Conservative Municipal Group from 2003 until his death, and served in the areas of health, culture, childhood, education. In 2003, he was one of the top five candidates to run for mayor.  Notable works  According to the Web of Science, Sagvolden published over 103 articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals. , these articles have been cited over 3400 times, resulting in an h-index of 30.

() is a 2011 South Korean crime thriller film based on a true story about an unsolved murder case. Plot The film is based on the true story of the Frog Boys of Daegu. On March 26, 1991, the local elections are being held. Since it is a school day off, the five boys set off to the nearby mountain and never return. Their parents try to get the police to investigate right away, but the authorities are more concerned about guarding the election poles. Days later, thousands of police set on the mountain to search for clues as to what may have happened but nothing turns up. The parents take their pleas for the boys‚Äô return to the airways where their story captures the heart, mind and sometimes imagination of the nation. Various theories such as the involvement of North Korean spies and alien abduction comes up. In 1996, a career-driven documentary maker, Kang Ji-seung is transferred to the small town after being disgraced for rigging an award-winning documentary. He then decides to investigate the case in the hopes of making a comeback. He teams up with an equally ambitious professor who hopes to make a name for himself by solving the crime where police failed. The professor‚Äôs theory, which seems to have quite a bit of compelling evidence behind it, takes the pair in a direction that the police were reluctant to investigate. The professor has the telephone recording of someone claiming to be one of the missing boys calling up his parents' home. However, the mother does not appear to be shocked to receive a call from her son. This leads the professor to suspects that the father and mother of this boy may know more than they have been letting on. While visiting the boys' home, everyone, from the boy's parents to his grandmother act strangely. The professor convinces the authorities to dig up the boy's home, but they find nothing. Nevertheless, the accusation destroys the family's reputation and the father dies without having cleared his name. Kang Ji-seung is soon transferred back to the city while the professor loses his job at the university. Then in September 2001, the remains of the children are found in the woods on the same mountainside the children said they were visiting by two men who were gathering acorns. At first police claim it seemed likely that the boys got lost and froze to death during the night. The parents refuse to believe this since their sons used to play in the area all the time. Also, the search party have searched this area as well but nothing came up at the time. After learning that the remains were found, Kang Ji-seung visits the forensic lab and learns that two of the skulls bear large holes and one has strange indentations made from an unidentified instrument. Their clothes were tied into knots used by sailors and bullet casings were found in the shallow, makeshift grave. Meanwhile, Seoul is shaken by the news of the disappearance of two children in the city. Kang Ji-seung meets with the police officer who investigated the missing boys' case ten years ago. The officer reveals that on the night after the boys disappeared, he came across a mysterious young man who is always seen fishing in the area. However, the man fled in his jeep when the officer approached him. The officer decided to keep this a secret since Korea has a statute of limitation on major crimes and in 2006 it ran out on the case. Even if the killer was found at this point, he cannot be prosecuted. So, the officer decided to wait for him to commit another crime in order to trap him. To add to the mystery, the area where the remains were found had been searched numerous times since the boys were known to play there and yet, almost a decade later, their bodies suddenly show up there. Through his license plate, Kang Ji-seung tracks the man down and breaks into his apartment when he is not home. To Kang Ji-seung's horror, there is a box containing little things owned by children. He also finds stacks of books tied up in knots used by sailors. Kang Ji-seung decides to wait for the culprit outside his apartment building to confront him when he gets home. However, Kang Ji- seung falls asleep and the culprit, realizing he is being watched, takes a picture of the reporter's car. The next morning, Kang Ji-seung's daughter goes missing. However, she is found soon after and claims she was helped by a man driving a passing by truck. Kang Ji-seung chases the truck down to a slaughter house. He confronts the suspect, who refuses to confess but hints that he might be the killer. Since Kang Ji-seung has no evidence to have the man arrested, he watches as the suspect walks away, presumably to escape from the city.

The family has played an important role during the Dutch Golden Age. They were at the centre of Amsterdam oligarchy from the beginning of the 17th century until the early 1650s. Since 1815 the family belongs to the new Dutch nobility with the honorific of jonkheer or jonkvrouw.Nederlands adelsboek, p. 24  The Bicker family during the Dutch Golden Age  During the Dutch Golden Age, the Bicker family was very critical of the influence of the House of Orange. They belonged to the republican political movement, also referred to as the ‚Äòstate oriented‚Äô, as opposed to the Royalists. Together with the Republican political leader Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt and the republican-minded Cornelis de Graeff, the Bickers strived for the abolition of stadtholdership. They desired the full sovereignty of the individual regions in a form in which the Republic of the United Seven Netherlands was not ruled by a single person. Instead of a sovereign (or stadtholder) the political and military power was lodged with the States General and with the regents of the cities in Holland. During the two decades from the 1630 to the 1650s the Bicker family had a leading role in the Amsterdam administration, the city was at the peak of its political power. In 1646, seven members of the Bicker family, called the Bicker's league, simultaneously held some political position or other. The Bickers provided silver and ships to Spain, and were very much interested in ending the Eighty Years War. This brought them in conflict with the stadtholder, some provinces, like Zeeland and Utrecht, and the Reformed preachers.Israel, J. (1995) The Dutch Republic, Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477-1806. Clarendon Press, Oxford, p. 545. After the Peace of M√ºnster (1648) was signed, the Bickers were of the opinion that it was no longer necessary to maintain a standing army, bringing them into vehement conflict with prince Willem II.Israel, J. (1995) The Dutch Republic, Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477-1806. p. 602. To regain power William went on the march towards Dordrecht and Amsterdam with an army. His troops got lost in a dense fog and were discovered by the postal courier on Hamburg. The mayors of Amsterdam had the civic guard called out, the bridges raised, the gates closed and the artillery dragged into position. After that the leader of the family, Andries Bicker, was purged from the vroedschap, as was his brother Cornelis Bicker, as one of the conditions of the treaty that followed, led by Joan Huydecoper van Maarsseveen.Israel, J.

With a history dating back to the 12th century, it is one of the castles in the Valley of the Seven Castles. Location Standing on level ground in the valley of the stream of Goeblange, the castle's impressive keep and external walls blend harmoniously with the Baroque church and the old houses in the centre of the village. History The Grevenschlass, now known as Koerich Castle, was built by Wirich I, Lord of Koerich and Seneschal of Luxembourg at the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th century in late Romanesque style. It was expanded in 1304 by Godefroid of Koerich who gave it a more Gothic appearance. The keep, now 11 m tall, was certainly much higher when it was built. With a base measuring 12 by 11.6 m and walls up to 3.5 m thick, it is one of the most impressive in the entire region. A spiral staircase inside one of the walls provided access to the different floors. Surrounded by a moat, the castle originally had a fortified entrance with a portcullis. From 1380, Gilles of Autel and Koerich converted the stronghold into a more comfortable residence by building two 12-m towers at either end of the south wall. The south-western tower which still stands, houses a chapel on the ground floor. In 1580, the new owner Jacques de Raville made further changes, demolishing part of the property and adding two Renaissance wings. The stately fireplace on the first floor and large rectangular windows testify to the castle's palatial splendor at the time. The south wing was again altered in 1728, this time with Baroque additions. After the death of the Ravilles in the second half of the 18th century, the castle started to fall into ruin owing to lack of maintenance. In 1950, Pierre Flammang, the last private owner, carried out some essential structural repairs before the castle finally came into the hands of the State.R. Krantz and N.

Through this exchange businesses access lower costs of financing than they would get at a bank and the public are able to become lenders and in doing so make a return on their capital. As of September 2019, Funding Circle has facilitated over ¬£8 billion in loans to small and medium-sized firms. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange. History =2010-13; Founding = In a public house in 2008 Samir Desai, James Meekings and Andrew Mullinger, friends from University of Oxford, first discussed the idea of a peer-to-peer lending marketplace. This 2008 meeting occurred during the 2007-09 financial crisis; a period in Britain when to banks were cutting back on \\"lending to strengthen their balance sheets and meet regulatory demands\\". It was this content that the peer-to-peer lending industry grew rapidly in Britain (as reported by Reuters in 2015) by providing a needed alternative source of capital. In 2009 Desai, Meekings and Mullinger quit their jobs to co-found the company that would launched in August 2010 under the name Funding Circle. In 2012 the British government used the platform to lend 20 million pounds ($32 million) to small businesses. From launching in 2010 to October 2013 Funding Circle had facilitated ¬£160 million of loans. =2013-15; Expansion through merging & acquisition = In 2013 Accel Partners led the $37 million round of funding along with Ribbit Capital, Union Square Ventures and Index Ventures bringing the company‚Äôs total funding to $58 million to fund Funding Circle US market entry. With the $37 million round recent capital raising in October 2013 Funding Circle merged with San Francisco-based Endurance Lending Network to gain access to the US market. As a US firm Endurance Lending Network is regulated on a state-by-state basis and as of 2013 was regulated in 31 states. The Endurance Lending Network changed its name to Funding Circle, and Reuters reported: \\"Unlike Funding Circle, Endurance Lending‚Äôs site is only open to accredited and institutional investors, due to differences in regulation\\". In October 2015 Funding Circle to access markets in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands acquired Zencap. In September 2018, global asset management firm Alcentra agreed to purchase up to $1 billion worth of business loans from the Funding Circle US platform, on behalf of its clients. The loans would be financed by Credit Suisse over a period of three years and were expected to be provided to around 8,000 U.S. businesses. =2018; Initial public offering= The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange in September 2018 with an initial valuation of ¬£1.5 billion. The company raised around ¬£300 million in the initial public offering ('IPO'). The IPO accounted for 29.3% of the company shares. Danish billionaire and owner of Bestseller, Anders Povlsen anchored the float by agreeing to purchase a minimum of 10% of the shares. However, the shares fell 24% from the float price of 440p on the first day of trading. =2019-present; Since becoming a public company= As a public company Funding Circle starting in 2019 began reporting their financial account the first of which included 55 percent increase in year on year revenues and that pre-tax losses climbed from ¬£36.3m to ¬£50.7m; being losses increase 40% while the company spent more on marketing and staff. In April 2019 the board of Funding Circle SME Income Fund announced that it would wind itself up and return its capital to shareholders. The company referred to a halving of revenue growth amid an \\"uncertain economic environment\\" in July 2019. The Guardian suggested was that this had been driven by Brexit rather than anything fundamentally wrong with the company's business model. Then in August 2019 it announced an increase of 15% in first half losses due to UK bad debts. In September 2019 the Press Association noted that lenders face a near 100-day wait to sell off unwanted loans and get their money back, compared with just eight days in January 2019, reflecting a lack of liquidity in the product. In October 2019 Funding Circle wrote to investors in an effort to allay some of these concerns. Then in November 2019 the company's IPO was cited as an example of why hopes of a 2019 listings rush had been left unfulfilled. On 9 April 2020 Funding Circle announced the temporary suspension of their secondary market for loan parts stating \\"we have taken the decision to pause the secondary market while we continue to evaluate the potential impact of Covid-19.\\" Operations Funding Circle is an online marketplace that enables investors to offer money direct to small companies. Businesses can borrow up to ¬£1 million in the UK, up to $500,000 in the US, and up to ‚Ç¨250,000 in Germany and the Netherlands for up to 60 months. Initially the loan rate was set through an auction process, but since September 2015, Funding Circle determines the loan rate offered based on risk category and loan term. Regulatory As of 2012 Britain‚Äôs Financial Services Compensation Scheme does not cover lending by crowd funding or peer-to-peer lending and therefore Funding Circle's customers are not protected and cannot turn as a last resort to the FSCS. In December 2012 it was announced by the UK Treasury that beginning in April 2014 the UK's new Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) would regulate peer-to-peer lenders, including Funding Circle. It further announced that during 2013 there would be consultation to decide how the new rules would work.

The term is generally translated as \\"perseverance\\", \\"patience\\", or \\"tolerance\\". A related term, , a compound with tsuyoi (strong), means \\"suffering the unbearable\\" or having a high capacity for a kind of stoic endurance. Gaman is variously described as a \\"virtue\\", an \\"ethos\\", a \\"trait\\", etc. It means to do one's best in distressed times and to maintain self-control and discipline. Gaman is a teaching of Zen Buddhism. Analysis Gaman has been attributed to the Japanese-Americans and others held in United States' internment camps during World War II and to those affected by the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami in northern Japan. In the internment camps, gaman was misperceived by the non-Japanese as introverted behavior or as a lack of assertiveness or initiative rather than as a demonstration of strength in the face of difficulty or suffering. Gaman and the related term yase-gaman are, in Japanese society, closely related to complying with conformity, and silent heroism, which seems to be hidden pride for compensation for sacrifice and be satisfied to pay reciprocal service in advance, or to be seen themselves as victims by folks. Gaman toward authority, 'unquestioning obedience' or 'blind obedience' is supposed to be unfit to a healthy democracy. After the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, the resilience, civility, lack of looting and ability of the Japanese to help each other was widely attributed to the gaman spirit. The 50‚Äì70 workers who remained at the damaged and radiation-emitting Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant despite the severe danger demonstrated what was regarded as gaman as well. Gaman is also used in psychoanalytic studies and to describe the attitudes of the Japanese. It is often taught to youth and largely used by older Japanese generations. Showing gaman is seen as a sign of maturity and strength. Keeping your private affairs, problems and complaints silent demonstrates strength and politeness as others have seemingly larger problems as well. If a person with gaman were to receive help from someone else, they would be compliant; not asking for any additional help and voicing no concerns.

Its debut performance was at the Palace Theatre, Manchester in July 2011, as part of the 2011 Manchester International Festival. The opera is based on the life of John Dee, medical and scientific advisor to Elizabeth I. Background An engraving of John Dee, 1845 Damon Albarn became associated with the Manchester International Festival through a 2006 concert production by his band Gorillaz, Demon Days Live, a 2007 Chinese opera, Monkey: Journey to the West, and a 2009 immersive theatre production, It Felt Like a Kiss, for which he wrote music. An opera titled Doctor Dee was originally planned as a collaboration between Albarn, Gorillaz partner Jamie Hewlett and comic book author Alan Moore. According to Moore, he was approached by Albarn and Hewlett to collaborate on an opera featuring superheroes, but instead he suggested John Dee as a subject. He withdrew from the project when expected contributions from Albarn and Hewlett to his magazine Dodgem Logic failed to materialise. Moore is credited for \\"inspiration\\" in the opera's official programme and his incomplete libretto was published in Strange Attractor magazine. Production Dr Dee ran from 1 to 9 July 2011 at the Palace Theatre, Manchester. It was commissioned by the Manchester International Festival, English National Opera and the London 2012 Festival. It was subsequently performed from 26 June to 7 July 2012 at the London Coliseum, as part of the London 2012 Festival. The opera was scored for a band combining Elizabethan English instruments (viola da gamba, shawm, dulcian, crumhorn, recorder, lute) with the African kora and the distinctive drumming of Nigerian percussionist Tony Allen. Damon Albarn played acoustic guitar and harmonium and sang on a number of songs. A twenty-piece conventional orchestra was provided by the BBC Philharmonic and conducted by Andr√© de Ridder. John Dee, a non-singing part, was played by Bertie Carvel. Dee's wife, Katherine, was played by Anna Dennis. Francis Walsingham was played by Steven Page. Edward Kelley was played by Christopher Robson, whose singing was described as \\"sublime\\" by Albarn. =Reception= The Guardian gave the Manchester production four stars, saying that it \\"reaches to the heart of the tragedy of an overreaching intellect destroyed by a deal with a second-rate Mephistopheles\\". The Independent also awarded four stars, saying that the production was \\"mostly a triumph, but the opening dumb show and final song don't work\\". Rupert Christiansen in The Daily Telegraph gave the same star-rating, describing the opera as \\"fresh, original and heartfelt\\". The NME described it as \\"visually sumptuous and musically haunting\\".

It is located within the Southwest Penang Island District, at the southwestern coast of Penang Island. Gertak Sanggul is an agricultural village, with fisheries and pig farming as its economic mainstays.  Etymology  According to urban legend, Gertak Sanggul was named during World War II, when Penang was under Japanese occupation. The Malay ladies in the area, who typically tied their hair into buns (Malay: sanggul), would ride their bicycles along the area's uneven roads, causing their buns to come undone. The Japanese administrators on Penang Island henceforth referred to the area as Gertak Sanggul.  Demographics  According to the 2010 National Census conducted by Malaysia's Department of Statistics, Gertak Sanggul contained a population of 925. Ethnic Chinese formed of Gertak Sanggul's population, whilst the Malays made up close to 36% of the population.  Transportation  The main thoroughfare within Gertak Sanggul is Jalan Gertak Sanggul, which forms part of the pan-island Federal Route 6.

Biology The larvae feed on Schizachyrium scoparium. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as a narrow gallery near the midrib on the upperside of the leaf. The linear mine follows the midrib for quite a while, gradually widening until it occupies half the leaf from the midrib to the edge, before the top of the leaf the larva passes the midrib and starts feeding downwardly. So far the whole mine is filled with frass. The lower and final part of the mine is without frass and walls are lined with silk. Pupation takes place in this part with the pupa in upwards position and the cremaster firmly attached to the silk lining. When emerging the adult leaves the mine through a semi-circular slit. Adults have been collected in June and July in Michigan, in southern states of the United States from April to May and in August‚ÄìSeptember, in Brazil in March to May and in December. Larvae from Michigan collected in August hibernated inside the mines and emerged in May‚ÄìJune the following year. This gives the indication that the species is univoltine in the north, but bivoltine in the southern United States. In Brazil the species is probably multivoltine.

In 1986 he became a member of the Church of England‚Äôs Doctrine Commission and contributed to two reports: We Believe in the Holy Spirit (1989) and The Mystery of Salvation (1995).See the front matter to Contemporary Doctrine Classics (London: Church House Publishing, 2005). During the latter half of his time on the Commission he also served as its Deputy Chair. In 1990 Brown was appointed as the Van Mildert Professor of Divinity at Durham University and Residentiary Canon of Durham Cathedral, succeeding Daniel W. Hardy and then in 2007 being succeeded by Mark McIntosh. In 2002, while still at Durham, he was elected as a Fellow of the British Academy, and served as a member of the Council from 2008‚Äì11. At Durham Cathedral he served as Canon Librarian and chaired several artistic projects involving stained glass, altar frontals, and painting.For a major comprehensive study coordinated by Brown, see David Brown, ed. Durham Cathedral: History, Fabric and Culture (New Haven: Yale, 2015). In 2007 Brown was appointed to a personal chair as Wardlaw Professor of Theology, Aesthetics, and Culture, at St Mary's College, University of St Andrews. He was simultaneously appointed as a Professorial Fellow of the Institute for Theology, Imagination and the Arts (ITIA), and was acting Director of ITIA in 2014‚Äì15. In 2012 Brown was awarded a D.Litt. from Edinburgh University‚Äînot an honorary degree but a higher doctorate earned on the basis of submitted published work‚Äîand in the same year was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He retired from St. Andrews in 2015 and is currently an Wardlaw Professor Emeritus of the University.Online: https://risweb.st- andrews.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/david-william-brown(0f026ecf-a32f-44be- ac1c-19538985fd9a).html He served as President of the Society for the Study of Theology (SST) in 2015‚Äì16.Online: http://www.theologysociety.org.uk/pastcommittee.asp  Intellectual profile  Brown‚Äôs scholarship has focused on four areas: the relation between philosophy and theology, sacramental theology, theology and the arts, and Anglican studies.See, for example, the section on Brown in Benjamin J. King, Robert MacSwain, and Jason A. Fout, \\"Contemporary Anglican Systematic Theology: Three Examples in David Brown, Sarah Coakley, and David F. Ford,\\" Anglican Theological Review 94 (2012): 319‚Äì34, specifically 325‚Äì29. His period at Oxford was primarily concerned with philosophical theology, and during his tenure as Fellow and Chaplain he worked closely with his Oriel colleagues Basil Mitchell and Richard Swinburne, two successive Nolloth Professors of the Philosophy of the Christian Religion.See David Brown, \\"‚ÄòNecessary‚Äô and ‚ÄòFitting‚Äô Reasons in Christian Theology,\\" in The Rationality of Religious Belief: Essays in Honour of Basil Mitchell, ed. W. J. Abraham and S. W. Holtzer (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987), 211‚Äì30; and \\"Did Revelation Cease?,\\" in Reason and the Christian Religion: Essays in Honour of Richard Swinburne, ed. Alan Padgett (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1994), 121‚Äì41. He was identified at this point with analytic philosophy of religion, but also with a rigorously historical-critical approach to Scripture. While at Oriel he published The Divine Trinity (1985), a critique of contemporary deism and unitarianism and a defense of continuing divine action, progressive revelation, the full personhood of the Holy Spirit, and a social model of the Trinity. For a recent assessment see Fergus Kerr, \\"Trinitarian Theology in the Light of Analytic Philosophy,\\" in The Oxford Handbook of the Trinity, ed. Gilles Emery OP and Matthew Levering (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), 339‚Äì47, discussion on 340‚Äì42. Brown did not explicitly defend a kenotic model of the Incarnation in this volume, but his sympathetic treatment of kenosis here was much later developed into a full study and defense in Divine Humanity (2010/2011). For a summary and critique, see Kathryn Tanner, \\"David Brown‚Äôs Divine Humanity,\\" Scottish Journal of Theology 68 (2015): 106‚Äì13. In 1985 he published an influential article titled \\"No Heaven Without Purgatory\\". Originally published in Religious Studies 21 (1985): 447‚Äì56; now reprinted in David Brown, God in a Single Vision: Integrating Philosophy and Theology, ed. Christopher R. Brewer and Robert MacSwain (London and New York: Routledge, 2016), 171‚Äì80. This article has been widely cited in subsequent discussions of personal eschatology in Christian theology and philosophy of religion. Also during his time at Oxford Brown explored the influence of French and German philosophy on Christian doctrine, the conclusions of which were published in Continental Philosophy and Modern Theology (1987). After moving to Durham, and partly through the influence of his new colleague Ann Loades, Brown‚Äôs research and teaching broadened to include sacramental theology and the relationship between theology and the arts. See their co-edited volumes, The Sense of the Sacramental: Movement and Measure in Art and Music, Place and Time (London: SPCK, 1995) and Christ: The Sacramental Word: Incarnation, Sacrament and Poetry (London: SPCK, 1996). For a more recent statement, see Brown‚Äôs chapter \\"A Sacramental World: Why it Matters,\\" in The Oxford Handbook of Sacramental Theology, ed. Hans Boersma and Matthew Levering (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 603‚Äì15. These interests gradually coalesced into five major volumes with Oxford University Press. The first two‚ÄîTradition and Imagination (1999) and Discipleship and Imagination (2000)‚Äîdefended a positive understanding of developing tradition in Christianity and other religions as a vehicle of progressive divine revelation and a necessary creative response of human imagination. The following three‚ÄîGod and Enchantment of Place (2004), God and Grace of Body (2007), and God and Mystery in Words (2008)‚Äîdefended an expansive account of sacramentality and religious experience mediated through natural and built environments, painting, bodies, food and drink, music, literature, and drama. According to Brown, the \\"fundamental thesis\\" underlying all five volumes is that \\"both natural and revealed theology are in crisis, and that the only way out is to give proper attention to the cultural embeddedness of both.\\" David Brown, God and Mystery in Words: Experience through Metaphor and Drama (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), 269. He also sought to reclaim and revitalize the category of \\"natural religion\\" in contrast to traditional \\"natural theology.\\" See David Brown, God and Enchantment of Place: Reclaiming Human Experience (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), 8‚Äì9. And yet, at the same time, he presented the Incarnation of God in the human person Jesus as the lens through which all of these issues are ultimately best understood. See, for example, David Brown, Tradition and Imagination: Revelation and Change (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 1. In a volume of essays engaging specifically with these books, co-editor Robert MacSwain wrote that the five volumes inaugurated by Tradition and Imagination \\"present many detailed arguments across a vast canvas through a sophisticated blend of philosophy, theology, biblical studies, classical studies, church history, comparative religion, comparative literature, and a wide range of other disciplines and cultural studies, particularly those related to the fine and performing arts, up to and including pop culture in its various manifestations and media. The primarily analytic and empirical approach of The Divine Trinity was not totally abandoned, but has now been thoroughly integrated into a much deeper and richer context, one that more faithfully represents the genuine complexity of the Christian tradition and which is thus more fruitful in interpreting, assessing, and defending it.\\" Robert MacSwain, \\"Introduction: Theology, Aesthetics, and Culture,\\" in Theology, Aesthetics, and Culture: Responses to the Work of David Brown, ed. Robert MacSwain and Taylor Worley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), 1‚Äì10, citation from 5. A Scottish Episcopalian initially ordained in the Church of England, Brown belongs to the Anglo-Catholic tradition that developed out of the 19th century Oxford Movement, and has written studies of Anglican figures such as Joseph Butler, David Brown, \\"Butler and Deism,\\" in Joseph Butler‚Äôs Moral and Religious Thought, ed.

Brown‚Äôs perspective has been described as a \\"Critical Catholicism\\": \\"instead of seeking to go beyond (or around) ‚Äòsecular‚Äô reason, it accepts native British empirical standards in both philosophy and history, does not object to metaphysics and natural theology in principle, sees special revelation as building upon general revelation, and rather than isolating Christian faith in a protected world of its own seeks to integrate it fully with what is known in other fields of human inquiry. At the same time, such ‚ÄòCritical Catholicism‚Äô takes seriously the basic contours of Nicene Christianity and works as much as possible within those parameters, adjusting them only when it seems absolutely necessary in light of new knowledge.\\" Editor‚Äôs introduction to David Brown, God in a Single Vision: Integrating Philosophy and Theology, ed.

Career  In 1660, Winch was elected Member of Parliament for Bedford in the Convention Parliament. History of Parliament Online - Humphrey Winch He was created a baronet of Hawnes in the County of Bedford on 9 June 1660. In 1661 he was elected MP for Bedfordshire in the Cavalier Parliament and sat until 1679. He was a diligent MP who sat on numerous committees in the Commons, and was regarded as a reliable supporter of the Crown. He sold the estate of Hawnes in 1667 to Sir George Carteret, Bt, and moved to Harleyford Manor, near Great Marlow. He was MP for Great Marlow from 1679 to 1681 and from 1685 to 1689. He was a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty between 1679 and 1684. Winch died at the age of 81. Family  Winch married Rebecca Browne, daughter of Alderman Martin Browne of London. He had two daughters, Judith, who married Sir Humphrey Forster, 2nd Baronet, and the younger Rebecca, who married Sir Thomas Lawley, 3rd Baronet, but no sons, and the title became extinct on his death in 1703, although it was erroneously assumed by his nephew, Humphrey Winch, of Branston, Lincolnshire. He had settled his Lincolnshire estates on his brother Richard. His descendants through his grandson Sir Robert Lawley gained the title Baron Wenlock. His widow died in 1713: her manuscript book of family recipes and herbal remedies has survived. It contains some useful information on the family's history, such as the early death of nearly all the Lawley grandchildren (of fourteen children of Sir Thomas Lawley and Rebecca, only three reached adulthood).

It is an interdisciplinary program of Cornell University that focuses on the development of graduate training and research opportunities on the languages and cultures of Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Cornell is known for being one of the world's greatest centers for the study of Southeast Asia.  Overview  Since 1958, the U.S. Department of Education has continuously recognized SEAP as a Title VI National Resource Center. As such, it trains experts on the region and strives to meet strategic national needs in government, business, science and professional fields, as well as provides K-16 Outreach. SEAP offers instruction at four levels of study in Burmese, Indonesian, Khmer, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. As an interdisciplinary program, SEAP coordinates resources and facilities for Cornell undergraduates, graduate students, and other scholars specializing in the culture, economy, history, politics, development, and society of contemporary, colonial, and traditional Southeast Asia. Its graduate student community organizes the weekly lunchtime Ronald and Janette Gatty Lecture Series, which brings scholars from Cornell and other institutions to present an informal lunchtime lecture on their work. SEAP graduate students also hold an annual graduate student conference in the spring. For undergraduate students, SEAP coordinates a number of study abroad opportunities and internships in Southeast Asia. It also makes funding available for coursework, research, travel, and summer language study opportunities, including the Southeast Asian Summer Studies Institute at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison.  John M. Echols Collection on Southeast Asia  SEAP is home to the John M. Echols Collection on Southeast Asia, the largest collection on the region with over 500,000 monographs in 162 indigenous languages. The Southeast Asia Collection was named in 1977 in honor of John M. Echols, professor of linguistics and literature in SEAP, who devoted three decades to its development. The Echols Collection has been a joint undertaking of the university, the library, and SEAP with the goal of acquiring a copy of every publication of research value produced in the countries of Southeast Asia and publications about the region published in other parts of the world.  George McT. Kahin Center for Advanced Research on Southeast Aisa  The George McT. Kahin Center for Advanced Research on Southeast Asia is located in the handsome and historic \\"Treman House\\". When it was built in 1902, the house at 640 Stewart Ave boasted a hand-operated elevator, electric bells, speaking tubes, and central heating. The house was built by Robert Henry Treman, son of an enterprising local family and the first member of that family to attend Cornell University and be elected to its board of trustees. This historic house, dedicated on May 11, 1992, as the George McT. Kahin Center for Advanced Research on Southeast Asia is home to SEAP graduate students, visiting fellows and scholars, faculty members, and SEAP's Publication and Outreach offices. To quote George Kahin, it serves as SEAP'S \\"spiritual epicenter\\", where a diverse group of students and faculty whose interests span a range of disciplines can draw upon each others' experiences and knowledge of Southeast Asia. A variety of events take place in the Kahin Center, including SEAP's Ronald and Janette Gatty Lecture Series (scheduled at 12:00 pm each Thursday during the academic year), as well as other student- or faculty- sponsored symposia and conferences.  SEAP Publications  SEAP Publications, an imprint of Cornell University Press, publishes and distributes academic books and a semi-annual journal on Indonesia. SEAP Publications seeks to make scholarship on Southeast Asia widely available to interested readers. SEAP books are divided into these four main series: * Studies on Southeast Asia Series (SOSEA). The Studies on Southeast Asia Series (SOSEA) is made up of substantial scholarly books, essay collections, and monographs, usually in the fields of history, anthropology, or political studies. * Southeast Asia Program Series (SEAPS). The Southeast Asia Program Series (SEAPS) was conceptualized as a successor to the earlier Southeast Asia Program Data Papers Series, which began publication in 1951. These books offer current research by young scholars. * Cornell Modern Indonesia Project (CMIP). The Cornell Modern Indonesia Project was initiated in 1956 with translations of significant documents and literature concerned with modern Indonesia. This series includes many translations of primary source materials, along with original studies of the nation's contemporary political events and the evolution of its government through the twentieth century. * Language books. Cornell offers instructional language textbooks for students of Indonesian, Khmer, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese.  Benedict Anderson  Political scientist and historian Benedict Anderson (1936‚Äì2015) was a notable SEAP alumnus and former director of the program. He earned a classics degree from Cambridge University in 1957 before attending Cornell University, where he concentrated on Indonesia as a research interest and in 1967 received his Ph.D. in government studies. His doctoral advisor at Cornell was Southeast Asian scholar George Kahin. Anderson was best known for his 1983 book Imagined Communities, which explored the origins of nationalism. He was the Aaron L. Binenkorb Professor Emeritus of International Studies, Government & Asian Studies at Cornell University; he was a polyglot with an interest in southeast Asia. His work on the \\"Cornell Paper\\", which debunked the official story of Indonesia's 30 September Movement and the subsequent anti-communist purges of 1965‚Äì1966, led to his expulsion from that country. He was the brother of historian Perry Anderson.

Biology The larvae feed on Ipomoea neei. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as an irregular gallery, later widening and branching. The larva constructs a silken gallery at the beginning of the mine from where most of the frass is rejected. Later some frass is heaped in the branches of the mine. The larva change mines and the second mines are irregular blotch mines, occupying a considerable part of the leaf. Pupation takes place inside the mine. Although Ipomoea santillanii also occurred next to the food plant the mines were not found on this plant. Adults have been collected in May. Etymology The species is dedicated to the wife of the species author, Etmy Laura Koster-Keuter.

Somerville was also recorded as a Warden of the Scottish Borders in 1424. As Somerville of that Ilk, he sat on the assize at Stirling Castle in May 1425 that condemned Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany.

The Hall is very close to the village of Lawshall, and part of the Coldham estate is located within this parish. Description Coldham Hall is a large Tudor country house that was constructed in 1574 for Sir Robert Rookwood (or Rokewood) of Stanningfield. A notable feature of this two-storey building is the great hall, with a long gallery in the roof space some 32 metres long, running from east to west. Internal alterations undertaken around 1770 include a Roman Catholic chapel with delicate plasterwork, leading from the long gallery. Mid-nineteenth century alterations, including loggias on the east and south side, are now removed, but various window alterations at the rear and a service wing at the north end remain. The house was restored around 1980. History Entrance lodges to Coldham Hall Following its construction by Robert Rookwood in 1574, Coldham Hall remained the property of the Rookwood family for almost three centuries, until 1869. The Hall has had a number of famous residents including Ambrose Rookwood who was involved in the Gunpowder plot and was executed in 1605. The Rookwood family continued in the Roman Catholic faith, as shown by the two chapels and several priest holes at Coldham. A remarkable feature of the history of Stanningfield and Lawshall has been the continuity of Roman Catholicism from the Middle Ages to the present day, in a predominantly Protestant area. While the property remained in the Rookwood family until 1869, the estate passed through the female line to the Gages of Hengrave and was let to a tenant, Robert Taylor in the 1840s. In 1869 the estate was sold to Richard Holt-Lomax, whose family held it until 1893. The purchaser in 1893 was Lieutenant Colonel Henry Trafford-Rawson who developed Coldham as a shooting estate, enlarging old clumps of woodland and planting new blocks, some very close to the Hall. After the death of the Colonel's son, Captain John Henry Edmund Trafford-Rawson (of the West Yorkshire Regiment like his father), on the Somme during the Great War,https://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/816907/trafford-rawson,-john- henry-edmund/ the Coldham estate was purchased in 1918 by Colonel Everard Hambro, who lived there until his death in 1952. In 1952 the estate was purchased by Richard Duce who owned the property for 27 years before selling it to David Hart, an adviser to Margaret Thatcher, in 1979. Since then the estate has been owned by Jens Pilo; and more recently Matthew Vaughn and his supermodel wife Claudia Schiffer, the current owners. A fire on the property in 2014 destroyed several buildings in the grounds, but did not reach the hall itself. Gardens and grounds Duckpond at Coldham Hall The house is approached down an avenue of trees and by crossing two small lakes in the valley bottom, which drain to the River Lark. From time out of mind there has been a footpath alongside the grounds of the Hall, giving parishioners past and present a view of the mansion. Community In the past Coldham Hall had strong links with the local communities of Lawshall and Stanningfield, with many local women working in service at the main house and local men employed on the estate as agricultural workers or grooms. In the 1920s Christmas parties for the children of the employees at Coldham Hall were held in the Emancipation Chapel at Stanningfield. The field near the main entrance on to the Bury Road, Lawshall was actively used for both football and cricket for many years. The clubs relocated more than 40 years ago but the Coldham Hall Football Club still plays in the Bury & District Sunday Football League, and the Hartest & Coldham Hall Cricket Club in the Hunts County Bats Suffolk Cricket League. David Hart maintained a rapport with the local community by inviting local residents to Coldham Hall on 5 November, Guy Fawkes Night, to acknowledge the estate's link with the Gunpowder plot with a fireworks display and synchronised music from a brass band. Folklore A tunnel is said to have run from Coldham Hall to the 16th-century Lawshall Hall in Lawshall, a mile to the south. Notable former and current residents The following residents lived at the Coldham Hall: * Ambrose Rookwood - a member of the failed 1605 Gunpowder Plot, a conspiracy to replace the Protestant King James I with a Catholic monarch. * David Hart - an adviser to Margaret Thatcher, a British writer and businessman who lived at Coldham Hall and Chadacre Hall. The current residents are: * Matthew Vaughn - an English film producer and director. * Claudia Schiffer - a German supermodel and actress.

Some ethanolamides are naturally occurring, such as anandamide, palmitoylethanolamide and prostamides, which play physiological roles as lipid neurotransmitters and autacoids.

He held the WBA (Regular) super featherweight title from 2015 to 2016; the WBA interim featherweight title from 2012 to 2013; and challenged for the IBF lightweight title in 2018. Early life Fortuna was raised in La Romana, Dominican Republic, where he trained in boxing with his older brother Jonathon Alexander Fortuna. Amateur career Fortuna was a member of the Dominican National Team. During his amateur career, he won a Pan American silver medal and a gold medal at the Dominican National Championships. Pro career Fortuna is promoted by Lou DiBella's company DiBella Entertainment. In March 2011, Fortuna knocked out Florida prospect Derrick Wilson to win the WBC Youth Intercontinental Featherweight Championship. He later followed this up with a first-round knockout over prospect Yuandale Evans and a second-round knockout over former IBF and IBO Featherweight Champion Cristobal Cruz. =WBA interim featherweight title fight= On the undercard of Manny Pacquiao vs. Juan Manuel Marquez IV on December 8, 2012, Fortuna faced previously unbeaten Irish fighter Patrick Hyland for the WBA Interim Featherweight Title. Fortuna started fast, throwing power punches in bunches, but the Irishman stayed on his feet and began to put the pressure on Fortuna. Fortuna seemed to fade late but had built enough of an early lead to earn a unanimous decision and hand Hyland his first loss as a professional. =WBA regular super featherweight title fight= On the undercard of Amir Khan vs. Chris Algieri on May 20, 2015, Fortuna faced the Costa Rican Bryan V√°zquez for the WBA (Regular) Super Featherweight Title. Fortuna started strong, throwing a lot of punches and making Vasquez look slow. Fortuna kept his game plan until the last round and won his second world title as a professional. In his first title defence, Fortuna faced Carlos Velasquez. Fortuna started strong, and managed to drop Velasquez in the second round. Fortuna continued to be in control for most of the fight and started punishing Velasquez badly, until the tenth round when the referee stepped in and waved off the fight. On 20 January, 2018, Fortuna was scheduled to fight Robert Easter Jr for his IBF lightweight belt. However, Fortuna was not able to make weight and Easter Jr's IBF belt was not on the line. Easter Jr ended up victorious, via a debatable split-decision. Two judges scored the fight in favor of the champion, 115-112 and 114-113 and one in favor of Fortuna 114-113. On 16 June, 2018, Fortuna battled Adrian Granados. In an accidental clash, Fortuna was pushed out of the ring and had to be carried out of the arena on a stretcher.

It has inadequate facilities to handle demand, and many Guineans cannot afford its services. More than once in recent years the hospital has had to deal with a major influx of patients wounded in civil disturbances. Facilities Donka is a University Teaching Hospital, one of two in Conakry, the other being Ignace Deen Hospital. It is located to the northeast of the Conakry Grand Mosque and across the main road from the infamous Camp Boiro. It is the largest public hospital in the country, built in 1959 just before independence. The Soviet Union assisted in its construction. Sewage is treated by autonomous wastewater treatment plants funded by the World Bank. The hospital receives priority supply of electricity, but blackouts were frequent in 2006 when oil prices soared. The hospital did not have enough money to pay for fuel for the main back-up power generator. The Orthopedic Department was established in February 1982. At that time, the main problems it addressed were neglected poliomyelitis cases. In 2004, the West Africa Health Organization (WAHO), working with the Guinea Government, began giving two-year courses in ophthalmology for General Practice Doctors, with intensive theoretical and practical training. Facilities were insufficient. CBM, Sightsavers and WAHO arranged to build a new facility in the teaching hospital compound, which was opened on 9 April 2010. Treatment Pediatric doctors at Donka Hospital reviewing measles cases during an epidemic in 2009. A 1989 study found that maternal mortality at the hospital was 12.47 per 1,000, an extremely high figure. Causes include lack of primary health care or peripheral obstetrical services, poor training of nurses and midwives and lack of general health education among the public. In March 2011, the general wardroom for pre-mature babies in the Maternity Center had four incubators, but only one was working. It held five babies. The center is not equipped to handle the demand. About 80% of premature babies die within a few days. The Donka Hospital Institute of Nutrition and Child Health is the only children's hospital in Conakry. Between January and the end of September 2006, 623 malnourished children were admitted, a significant increase over previous years. The \\"dark, airless wards\\" were overcrowded, with some children sleeping two to a bed. The hospital's dialysis department has five dialysis machines and can only treat 21 patients. There are private dialysis centers, but most patients cannot pay the $100 cost of the treatment. The Donka hospital provides training for mass marketing, communication and marketing aspects of prevention of HIV/AIDS, funded by the World Bank and other sources. Patient charges The hospital has built up debt over the years, and cannot persuade the government or aid agencies to help with repayments. It therefore enforces a rigorous pay-as-you-go policy, which puts treatment and drugs out of reach of many poor people. New patients must first be tested for life-threatening illnesses such as tuberculosis, AIDS, cholera, malaria and cancer. The cost of a measles vaccine is as low as US$1. Since many Guineans do not have enough money to pay for the blood test, they cannot get medical attention at the hospital. The director of the hospital, Dr Taibou Barry, acknowledged the problem in 2003, saying: \\"The families are poor and when they come to the hospital, they have to pay for everything, and that‚Äôs probably all the money they have, so they must choose to eat or to come to the hospital\\". A 2008 report from IRIN described the case of Aboubacar Traor√©, who took his two- year-old daughter to the hospital for emergency medical treatment. Although the fee for consultation was $5, as shown on a sign on the wall, the doctor demanded more. Another doctor at the hospital said she was not surprised. She said \\"I have seen colleagues here persuade patients that only they can treat them, and once the patient has gained trust in that doctor, he or she bribes the patient\\".  Civil unrest  At the start of 2007, strikes and protests were called due to rising commodity prices and falling living standards, coupled with pervasive corruption and political unrest. In the ensuing violence, about 180 people died and over 1,000 were injured. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provided six vehicles to take wounded people to Donka Hospital on 22 January 2007. 119 patients were admitted, most with bullet wounds. The ICRC supplied a surgical kit for treating up to 150 gunshot victims to the hospital. Donka hospital cared for at least 800 wounded people, assisted by M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res. According to Djoulde Barry, director general of the hospital, 33 dead were registered there. On 28 September 2009 a demonstration against the military junta at a city stadium was violently suppressed by security forces, with dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries. Women reported that soldiers had raped them in public in the stadium. Medical records from Donka Hospital showed that at least 32 of the women protesters were raped. More than 220 first aid workers from the Red Cross Society of Guinea gave emergency medical assistance to more than 350 wounded people and took the most serious cases to the hospitals, mostly to the Donka National Hospital. The injured packed the emergency room. Military from the Presidential Guard and Anti-Drug and Anti-Organized Crime Unit showed up around 3:00 pm that day. They fired their rifles into the air, destroyed medicines and yelled at the wounded to leave the hospital. They prevented anyone else from entering the building. The register of people treated was later lost. Following the 28 September violence, the ICRC gave essential medical and surgical items to Conakry's hospitals, including kits to treat bullet wounds, masks, gloves and saline solution, and also provided body bags. The ICRC and the Red Cross Society of Guinea tried to reunite family members, particularly children, who had been separated in the violence. The NGO Terre des hommes was providing meals to patients in the Hospital, with the Health Ministry and private donations assisting in the supply of food. As follow-up to the violence, the ICRC helped Donka Hospital revise its emergency plan for handling a large influx of patients with bullet wounds. Further violence occurred before the October 2010 Presidential run-off elections. Supporters of the candidate Cellou Dalein Diallo of the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea threw stones at police, who responded with gunfire. Two people were killed and at least 29 people were injured, treated in private clinics or Donka Hospital. The victims included \\"13 adolescents and three young girls\\". Violence continued after the elections, which were disputed. On 16 November 2010, Donka hospital reported treating 30 gunshot wounds, mostly direct shots rather than from stray bullets. Western attention The bleak conditions in the hospital were the subject of a 1996 documentary Donka, radioscopie d'un h√¥pital africain by the Belgian director Thierry Michel. On 27 January 2009, a group of Marines from the U.S. Embassy delivered toys to each of the children at the Pediatric Hospital. The actress Mia Farrow, who serves as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, visited the hospital in May 2010. She saw three newborn infants in one incubator in the maternity ward. She met mothers of severely malnourished children, and saw children fighting measles and other preventable childhood killer diseases. She said \\"It is wrenching to watch a child dying of a disease that is completely preventable. This is a result of Guinea's failing health system\\".

It was built from 1941 to 1950 by Townsville City Council as a World War II memorial. The baths were added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 January 1995. The Tobruk Memorial Baths features a Olympic-size swimming pool, a heated pool used for children's swimming, lessons and physiotherapy and a toddlers pool. There is an on-site kiosk. The facade is a vibrant blue-and-white art deco design.  History  Tobruk Memorial Baths were commenced in 1941 and completed in 1950. An initiative of the Townsville City Council, the baths were intended initially simply as a civic amenity, to replace older city baths. In December 1941, however, the Council decided to name the baths in honour of the Australian servicemen who had taken part in the Siege of Tobruk (Tubruq). Tobruk Memorial Baths were erected on a site associated with sea bathing since at least the 1870s. The first European settlement at Townsville was concentrated in the area of Flinders Street East and The Strand, and The Strand and Cleveland Bay foreshore developed as one of the earliest recreation venues in Townsville. As early as 1866, Townsville's more affluent residents were constructing homes along the beachfront, and by 1872, three hotels had been erected opposite the present Anzac Memorial Park. The Strand was unformed at this time, being little more than a track along the foreshore, and there were no shade trees, but the beach was popular with bathers (mainly male) from at least the late 1870s. In 1881 the town council planted 30 cedar trees along the foreshore, and added cocoa and betel nut trees in early 1882. In 1883, following strong public demand, a road was made along the beach front to Kissing Point. By 1889, The Strand, between King Street and Kissing Point, made a glorious promenade on a moonlight night when the breeze blows straight and cool from Magnetic Island, and a temporary reserve for public baths (R.182) adjacent to the present Anzac Memorial Park and opposite a quarry was gazetted in February that year. This reserve comprised an area of nearly 7 acres, extending from low water mark to a little above high water mark, on which the Townsville Municipal Council spent approximately ¬£1,000 in erecting sea baths. Part of this reserve was occupied later by the Tobruk Memorial Baths. The whole of the foreshore between King and Howitt Streets was gazetted a temporary reserve for public purposes in February 1901. A section of this, between the Cleveland and King Streets, was proclaimed a permanent reserve for park purposes in June 1912, and extended as far as the sea baths in 1926. From at least the 1920s, The Strand Park was a focus for Anzac Day activities. A memorial clocktower was erected in the park in 1923‚Äì1924, and in 1934 the name of the park was changed to Anzac Memorial Park. When the Tobruk Memorial Baths were constructed 1941‚Äì1950, their location along The Strand reflected not only the long association of the area with public swimming, but also with commemorative activity, iconography and place. Work on the baths commenced in late 1941, as a City Council initiative to provide Townsville with an Olympic standard pool. At the time there was considerable public opposition to the use of Council finance for such an amenity during a war, and a petition was raised to the Queensland Government to have the project stopped. Cabinet found that the Townsville City Council had complied with the necessary formalities in relation to war-time building restrictions, the petition was rejected, and work went ahead until Townsville became an important base for the Allied offensive in the Pacific War in the first half of 1942. In December 1941, at the height of the controversy, the Townsville City Council decided to name the baths as a memorial to the Australians who had fought and died during the Siege of Tobruk (Tubruq), in the Libyan desert campaign against Germany's \\"invincible\\" General Rommel. In one of the most famous sieges in Australian military history, Australia's 9th Division joined British forces in holding Tobruk against the German advance for 8 months. The Australian infantry, raiding and patrolling by day and night, dominated the no-man's land surrounding the Tobruk perimeter and took many prisoners. After the war, work on the baths re-commenced, but was hampered by labour and materials shortages. Tobruk Memorial Baths finally opened to the public on 14 October 1950. They were opened officially on 26 November 1951 by Major-General WJ Windeyer, who was a senior officer at Tobruk. At the time, it was the only public memorial in Australia dedicated specifically to those who had participated in the Tobruk campaign. Inside the main entrance, the Townsville Sub-Branch of the Rats of Tobruk Association erected a marble plaque with the inscription: > This memorial stone is dedicated to the sacred memory of fallen comrades who > served with the Navy, Army, and Air Force during the memorial siege of > Tobruk, Western Desert, Great War II, from April 9, 1941 to December 13, > 1941. We shall remember them. Tobruk Memorial Baths were designed and constructed by the Townsville City Council's engineering and works departments, at a cost of approximately ¬£60,000. When completed, the baths comprised a standard 8 lane, long Olympic pool, graduating in depth from to , with the depths marked on the side, and a diving platform at the deep end; a toddlers' pool with depths ranging from a few inches to ; dressing sheds with central courtyards to permit natural light and ventilation; a cafe; manager's accommodation; tubular metal grandstands with seating for 250 spectators, along the ocean side of the pool and above the service rooms at the northwestern end of the pool; concrete paving to three sides of the enclosure ‚Äì the fourth, facing The Strand, was grassed; fencing; and gardens in front of the entrance pavilion, facing Anzac Memorial Park. Particular attention had been paid to lighting, with underwater lamps along the side of the pool, floodlights at either end of the pool which illuminated the length, and enclosure lighting. The main pool was tiled in blue and white, with the lanes demarked by black tiling, at a cost of ¬£6,000. Externally, the entrance pavilion was painted \\"mist green\\", and internal walls were in \\"harvest buff\\". The opening of the Tobruk Memorial Baths in 1950 re- introduced competitive swimming to Townsville, swimming carnivals having been discouraged during the war with the closure of the old city pool. In 1953, the Reserve for Public Baths was amended as a 3 roods 17 perches site between the high water mark and the road reserve, containing the Tobruk Memorial Baths only. The sea baths, although no longer part of the Reserve, were maintained by the Townsville City Council until collapsing in 1981, at which time the Council decided not to replace them. View of the Tobruk Memorial Baths with adjacent sea baths, 1957 With the absence of indoor Olympic pools in Australia at that time, the Tobruk Memorial Baths in Townsville was chosen as the best warm climate pool in Australia for winter training for the Australian swimming squad for the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games and 1960 Rome Olympic Games. Team members include Australian swimming legends Dawn Fraser, Murray Rose and Lorraine Crapp. Six world records and 13 Australian records were set there in one night in 1956, with the footage featured on the first day of television broadcast in Melbourne. Training camps were also held prior to the 1958 Cardiff Commonwealth Games, and for the women's 1964 Tokyo Olympic Team. The 1956 and 1960 teams were the most successful at world level of any Australian swimming teams. The manager of the Tobruk Memorial Baths at that time was Allan \\"Stumpy\\" Lawrence. His son, Laurie Lawrence is also well known as one of Australia's leading swimming coaches. Since 1987 the Townsville City Council, which previously operated the pool under a manager, now leases the complex to private enterprise. It remains a popular recreational venue in Townsville.  Description  Tobruk Memorial Baths has a rendered masonry pavilion containing an entrance and changing rooms, with an open air Olympic size pool behind. A toddlers pool is between the entrance and the Olympic pool. There is a pitched corrugated iron roof hidden behind a parapet and the central entrance section is two-storeyed. The pavilion has three entrance doors containing etched glass panels with fish and sea horse motifs. The Tobruk Memorial Baths have an attractive landscape setting, comprising grassed surrounds, linear perimeter plantings of Royal Palms (Roystonea regia) and other tropical vegetation including frangipani (Plumeria rubra).  Heritage listing  Tobruk Memorial Baths was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 January 1995 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Tobruk Memorial Baths, constructed over the period 1941‚Äì50, are significant as Australia's most substantial public memorial to the Australians who fought and died during the Siege of Tobruk (Tubruq), a coastal town on the edge of the Libyan desert, from 9 April to 13 December 1941. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Tobruk Memorial Baths is an example of a number of swimming pool complexes built in Queensland in the late 1940s and 1950s to commemorate the sacrifices made by those who served in the Second World War. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Tobruk Memorial Baths are a fine example of civic design, and incorporate motifs relating to swimming and the sea in the etched glass of the entrance doors. Tobruk Memorial Baths are situated adjacent to Anzac Memorial Park and The Strand. The baths and grounds contribute strongly to the aesthetic quality of the area through the distinctive architectural style of the entrance pavilion and the attractive landscaped setting. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Tobruk Memorial Baths are significant for their close association with Australia's preparation for the 1956 and 1960 Olympic Games, being the winter training venue for some of our most successful gold medallists, including Dawn Fraser and John and Ilsa Konrads, who raised the status and popularity of swimming as a competitive sport in Australia.

Owned by the United States Coast Guard, Casco Cove CGS is located west of Anchorage, Alaska. Also known as LORAN Station Attu, the facility was closed on August 27, 2010, but the airfield remains available for emergency use.  History  Established as Naval Air Facility Attu on June 7, 1943, just seven days after Attu Island was declared secured. The base was built by Seabees of the Naval Construction Battalion 4.  Overview  The Casco Cove Airport was a LORAN navigation station operated by the United States Coast Guard. The USCG personnel lived in a group quarters facility. There were no families stationed at Attu. All services needed for staff in this facility were available. Electricity was provided by USCG Generator. Auxiliary health care was provided by USCG emergency medical staff. Casco Cove is one of the most isolated and remote airports in the United States. Flying into and taking off from the airport was hazardous, as the weather is characterized by persistently overcast skies, high winds, and frequent cyclonic storms. Winter squalls produce wind gusts in excess of 100 knots (115 mph). During the summer, extensive fog forms over the Bering Sea and North Pacific. The island is protected as part of the National Parks Trust territory and few people visit the island or area, as it is restricted. Gun emplacements for over twenty guns are still present around the airfield.  Facilities  Casco Cove CGS resides at elevation of 88 feet (27 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 2/20 with an asphalt surface measuring 5,998 by 150 feet (1,828 x 46 m).  Incidents  On January 1, 1945, 2nd Lt. Robert L. Nesmith flying from Alexai Point, crashed his Lockheed P-38G-10-LO Lightning in Temnac Valley, just west of Attu Station, while on a low-level training mission over Attu. This aircraft was recovered in 1999 and is now static-restored and on display at Elmendorf AFB.

They mine the leaves of their host plant. They mine a small basal leaf in the spring, eating out almost the entire substance of the leaf. Just before pupation, it enters one of the lower stem leaves, in which it makes a small inconspicuous mine, scarcely larger than the larva, but broadening at its anterior end towards the tip of the leaf, slightly inflated, and showing us a convexity on the upper surface of the leaf. Within this cavity, which is silk-lined, pupation takes place. Beyond the pupation chamber, the mines extends a short distance forwards, but is scarcely visible except at its end, where the epidermis is almost eaten through, permitting the emergence of the imago. Adults fly in June and July in the North, early April to June farther South.

Although they lack a uniform approach to quantifying linguistic distance between languages, practitioners of linguistics use the concept in a variety of linguistic situations, such as learning additional languages, historical linguistics, language-based conflicts and the effects of language differences on trade. Measures =Lexicostatistics= The proposed measures used for linguistic distance reflect varying understandings of the term itself. One approach is based on mutual intelligibility, i.e. the ability of speakers of one language to understand the other language. With this, the higher the linguistic distance, the lower is the level of mutual intelligibility. Because cognate words play an important role in mutual intelligibility between languages, these figure prominently in such analyses. The higher the percentage of cognate (as opposed to non-cognate) words in the two languages with respect to one another, the lower is their linguistic distance. Also, the greater the degree of grammatical relatedness (i.e. the cognates mean roughly similar things) and lexical relatedness (i.e. the cognates are easily discernible as related words), the lower is the linguistic distance. As an example of this, the Hindustani word pƒÅnch is grammatically identical and lexically similar (but non-identical) to its cognate Punjabi and Persian word panj as well as to the lexically dissimilar but still grammatically identical Greek pent-List of Greek and Latin roots in English#P and English five. As another example, the English dish and German tisch 'table' are lexically (phonologically) similar but grammatically (semantically) dissimilar. Cognates in related languages can even be identical in form, but semantically distinct, such as caldo and largo, which mean respectively 'hot' and 'wide' in Italian but 'broth, soup' and 'long' in Spanish. Using a statistical approach (called lexicostatistics) by comparing each language's mass of words, distances can be calculated between them. In technical terms, what is calculated is the Levenshtein distance. Based on this, one study compared both Afrikaans and West Frisian with Dutch to see which was closer to Dutch. It determined that the Dutch and Afrikaans (mutual distance of 20.9%) were considerably closer than Dutch and West Frisian (mutual distance of 34.2%). However, lexicostatistical methods, which are based on retentions from a common proto- language ‚Äì and not innovations ‚Äì are problematic due to a number of reasons, so some linguists argue they cannot be relied upon during the tracing of a phylogenetic tree (for example, highest retention rates can sometimes be found in the opposite, peripheral ends of a language family).http://www.elisanet.fi/alkupera/Problems_of_phylogenetics.pdf Unusual innovativeness or conservativeness of a language can distort linguistic distance and the assumed separation date, examples being Romani language and East Baltic languages respectively. On the one hand, continued adjacency of closely related languages after their separation can make some loanwords 'invisible' (indistinguishable from cognates, see etymological nativization), therefore, from lexicostatistical point of view these languages appear less distant then they actually are (examples being Finnic and Saami languages). On the other hand, strong foreign influence of languages spreading far from their homeland can make them share fewer inherited words than they should do (examples being Hungarian and Samoyedic languages in the East Uralic branch). =Other internal aspects= Besides cognates, other aspects that are often measured are similarities of syntax and written forms. ... vocabulary, grammar, written form, syntax and myriad other statistics ... this scalar measure of \\"linguisitic distance\\" is demonstrated through an analysis of the determinants of English language proficiency among immigrants ... To overcome the aforementioned problems of the lexicostatistical methods, Donald Ringe, Tandy Warnow and Luay Nakhleh developed a complex phylogenetical method relying on phonological and morphological innovations in 2000s. =Language learning= A 2005 paper by economists Barry Chiswick and Paul Miller attempted to put forth a metric for linguistic distances that was based on empirical observations of how rapidly speakers of a given language gained proficiency in another one when immersed in a society that overwhelmingly communicated in the latter language. In this study, the speed of English language acquisition was studied for immigrants of various linguistic backgrounds in the United States and Canada.

The protocol and sample applications are specified in RFC 7600. Features IPv4 Residual Deployment has three main features: *Mesh topology: between two endpoints, IPv4 packets take the same _direct routes_ as IPv6 packets. *Shared IPv4 addresses: to deal with the unavoidable IPv4-address shortage, several customers can be assigned a common IPv4 address, with disjoint TCP/UDP port sets assigned to each (an application of the general A+P model of RFC 6346). *Stateless operation: conversions of IPv4 packets into IPv6 packets at domain entry, and the reverse at domain exit, are stateless (i.e., one where no per-customer state is needed in domain edge nodes). Compared to other IETF-specified mechanisms having the same main features, i.e., MAP-E (RFC 7597, RFC 7598, RFC 2473) and MAP-T (RFC 7599, RFC 7598, RFC 6145), its distinctive property is that it simultaneously supports: *Full IPv4-fragmentation transparency: with this feature, support of the path MTU Discovery of RFC 4821, recommended in RFC 6349, is preserved. Without it, wherever firewalls filter ICMP packets (as they too commonly do), end systems that support RFC 4821 lose their ability to _take advantage of paths that support large packets_ . *Applicability of IPv6 packet inspections to IPv4: when traversing IPv6-only domains, converted IPv4 packets are ordinary IPv6 packets, with their contents unchanged and valid in IPv6. Thus, IPv6 filters that are performed within the IPv6-only domain, e.g. for Access Control Lists, Web caches, Deep packet inspections, are, implicitly and automatically, effective on domain-traversing IPv4 packets. MAP-E only supports the former, and MAP-T only supports the latter. If an ISP wants to offer residual IPv4 service across an IPv6-only domain, and provides customer-premises equipment to all its customers of this domain, it can choose any of MAP-E, MAP-T, or 4rd, with due awareness that MAP-E and MAP-T are specified in standards-track RFCs, while 4rd is, at least so far, specified in an experimental-track RFC (see the History section below): the chosen mechanism remains purely internal to each domain. Principles The key that permits to combine IPv4-fragmentation transparency with IPv6 deep packet Inspection in a single design is the use of a reversible packet translation at Domain Entries and Exits. This is possible because IPv6 packet headers, duly complemented with their Fragment headers whenever needed, are large enough to encode in them, in an ad hoc way detailed in RFC 7600, all useful IPv4-header information. (This was not possible in 6rd, the tunneling mechanism for IPv6 across IPv4-only domains, because IPv4 headers are too small to contain all IPv6-header information). IP-layer options of IPv4 are not supported in 4rd, but without practical consequence because end systems are already adapted to the fact that, for security reasons, IPv4 IP-layer options are filtered by many routers. Another issue about which the 4rd specification goes beyond those of MAP-E and MAP-T concerns fragmented IPv4 datagrams. In MAP-E and MAP-T specifications, the only fully described behaviors involves datagram reassembly at domain entry before forwarding. In order to improve user- perceived performance, to reduce domain-entry processing, and to reduce attack opportunities, the 4rd specification includes an algorithm whereby received fragments of large datagrams are forwarded one by one on the fly.  History  The first \\"4rd\\" specification, unlike the current one of RFC 7600, used IPv4 encapsulation in IPv6 packets, the only known tunneling approach at that time to ensure complete IPv4 preservation across IPv6-only domains. It was the first proposal that combined stateless address mapping, mesh topology, and A+P. Another stateless-mesh-A+P approach was next proposed, called dIVI. Instead of encapsulation, it used two successive translations (from IPv4 to IPv6 and then conversely), based on the existing SIIT one-way translations of RFC 2765. Compared to encapsulation, it had the advantage of making IPv6 packet inspections applicable to translated UDP and TCP IPv4 packets, but, due to limitations of SIIT, lacked full compatibility with IPv4 fragmentation (and consequently, as mentioned above, compatibility with path MTU Discovery recommended in RFC 6349). In this context, approval of one of the two designs as single standard seemed out of reach, despite the general wish for standard unicity. Two different directions were then taken. * One proposed to rename the 4rd encapsulation solution as MAP-E, to rename the double SIIT translation as MAP-T, and to associate them into a combined specification named MAP. The idea was that, to satisfy the standard unicity objective, a specification having two variants (among which a choice remains needed for each IPv6-only domain), might be considered as equivalent to a single standard. But no consensus was reached on this interpretation. *The other was based on discovery that, as mentioned above, an upgraded IPv4-IPv6 double translation algorithm was possible that combined applicability of IPv6 packet inspections to IPv4, like MAP-T, and full compatibility with IPv4 fragmentation like MAP-E. As the \\"4rd\\" acronym was no longer used for the encapsulation solution, this solution was named _4rd_. A proposal to take this approach for a unique standard was made. But, despite a validation of its principle on an implementation, did not raise interest from supporters of either MAP-E, or MAP-T. After a long debate, the Softwire working group decided, in August 2012, that MAP-E alone would be standardized, and that work could continue on both 4rd and MAP-T, but only as experimental. Finally, in December 2014 the Softwire working group changed its previous decision, and decided to put MAP-T on Standards Track in parallel with MAP-E, provided a note in the MAP-T RFC would signal its incompatibility with the path MTU Discovery of RFC 4821. This left 4rd alone in the Experimental category (yet with ISPs' possibility to deploy it, for its functional advantages, in domains where they provide customer premises equipment to all their customers).  Real-world deployment  The French ISP Free is deemed to have deployed 4rd for its experiment of FTTH in \\"lesser-dense areas\\", starting from December 2015. The implementation of the A+P model implies the attribution of four contiguous port ranges to different customers for each IPv4 address. Free was also known to be the first implementer of 6rd.

Built in 1898 as a company store as well as the main offices for the expansive Spade Ranch, the store was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. History In the early 1890s, Ellsworth located on the Burlington Railroad line, offered only a depot, school, and section house. In about 1898 the Spade Ranch erected a store, a hotel, and stockyards. The store building, built by W.T. Merrit, served as business office for the ranch, a general supply store and a post office. At the height of the Spade Ranch operations, a 10 horse-team freight wagon made trips from the Ellsworth Store to the Store and Post Office located at the Spade Headquarters 23 miles north east every three days. In 1927 after the foreclosure of the ranch, the store building was sold to Abbott Interest who hired Lawrence Graham to assume its management. Between 1928 and 1950, Lawrence and his wife, Hazel, operated the store, living in the apartment above. During this time, gasoline pumps were added. In 1950, Lawrence and Hazel Graham purchased the store from Abbott Interest. After Lawrence's death in 1960, Hazel and her son, Roy, continued to operate the store until 1967. The store remained vacant from 1967 until 1971, when it was sold to Veldon Morgan, a former Spade Cowboy, and son Wade Morgan who built two large warehouse additions to the original store for use as a western tack and saddle manufacturing plant with over 100 employees. Morgan's western equipment was sold nationwide and achieved much success throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Beginning in the early 1990s Morgan's began to downsize until 2000 when all factory operations ceased because of shifting markets. Today Wade Morgan operates as a ranch supply and general store, serving Ellsworth and the surrounding area.

As a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, he is best-known for being one of a few players who sought to delay their entry into military service to begin a professional sports career under conflicting guidelines established in 2005 and 2008. Education  White grew up in Midland, Texas, and later attended Midland High School. Upon graduation, he attended West Point. Feeling that he \\"needed to do something\\" after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, which took place during his junior year of high school, White eventually turned down an offer from Texas Tech University and several junior colleges in favor of Army. Prior to White joining the Army, the only member of his family with any military experience is his grandfather on his mother's side, Michael Carroll, who was in the Navy during World War II. While at Army, White played baseball for the Army Black Knights. During his college playing career, he was named the 2005 Patriot League Rookie of the Year and the 2007 conference player of the year. He led all Patriot League players in hit-by-pitch during his junior year which earned him the\\"Stay Tight\\" team award. He finished what he called \\"the best four years of his life\\" baseball-wise by leading his team to the 2008 Patriot League regular-season championship, primarily as a pitcher and outfielder.\\" Military service In the spring of 2008, he graduated from West Point and was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates that June, and assigned to the State College Spikes. However, due to a United States Army policy, all West Point cadets are required to serve two years of active duty upon graduation. While the Alternative Service Option in 2005 allowed professional athletes to delay this obligation until the conclusion of their playing careers, new guidelines in 2008 stated that any cadet interested in pursuing a professional sports career must serve two years of active duty before applying for a release from the military.\\" Cole though had a five-year commitment to the Army. The rule states: > Cadets accepted into the program, \\"will owe two years of active service in > the Army, during which time they will be allowed to play their sport in the > player-development systems of their respective organizations and be assigned > to recruiting stations. If they remain in professional sports following > those two years, they will be provided the option of buying out the > remaining three years of their active-duty commitment in exchange for six > years of reserve time.\\" Prior to his call-up to the Army, White obtained a .366 batting average in over 71 at-bats with the Spikes. He returned to West Point, where he enrolled in an officer training program while serving as an intern in the athletic department. He later served as a first lieutenant, serving as a tank platoon leader with the 1st Cavalry Division. During his 2-year Army career, White was stationed at West Point, Fort Sill in Oklahoma, Fort Knox in Kentucky and Fort Hood in Texas. He arrived at Fort Hood a month before the 2009 terrorist shootings by Army psychiatrist Major Nidal Malik Hasan.\\" Return to baseball In June 2010 the Assistant Secretary of the Army, Thomas R. Lamont, gave White an early release from his 5-year active-duty commitment. He then rejoined the Pirates organization, who reassigned him back to the State College Spikes. At the end of his professional career, White would still owe three more years of service to the Army. In 2010, White had a batting average of .250 in 144 at-bats. In April 2011, White was promoted to Pirates' Single A-Advance team, the Bradenton Marauders. In May 2011 the Pirates moved White down from Bradenton to the Low-A West Virginia Power. At 26, White was the oldest player on the Power roster by more than two years. However, with the Power, he hit .288 with 23 RBIs in 35 games. Once Marauders first baseman Aaron Baker was dealt to the Baltimore Orioles - as part of the Pittsburgh Pirates' trade for Derrek Lee - on July 30, 2011, White returned to Bradenton. In his first 18 at-bats since being called-up, White posted at .440 batting average, going 8-18. White retired prior to the 2012 season.

Introduction Azerbaijani tea is usually served first when a host receives guests. Tea serving and drinking is an important component of Azerbaijani culture. Armudu, which translates as \\"in the shape of a pear,\\" or Boƒümalƒ±, which translates as \\"narrow\\", as it is also called, suggests the shape of a pear and is sometimes associated with the figure of a hostess in Azerbaijani culture. The Armudu is made from a variety of materials: glass, porcelain, faience, and silver. Besides its aesthetic qualities, the Armudu also has thermophysical advantages. The narrower middle portion of the glass does not allow the hot liquid in the bottom of the glass to flow upwards but returns the warm flow to the bottom. This allows the tea to remain hot until it is consumed in full. The Armudu tea glasses are often 100 grams in weight. The tea is poured into the glass but not up to the top. Usually a gap of 1‚Äì2 cm, which is called \\"dodaq yeri\\" (\\"place for lips\\" in Azerbaijani), is left for the consumer's lips for comfortable drinking. right Shape Armudu There are three reasons why the shape of the glass matters. Firstly, this type of glass is easy to hold because its top edge is wider than the middle which prevents it from slipping out of hands. Secondly, because the top part becomes less hot, it prevents burning one's hands. Thirdly, it was proven that, unlike regular glasses and cups in which hot liquids cool evenly, the hot tea in Armudu glasses provides proportional cooling at the time of drinking allowing cooling of the tea in the top portion of the glass while keeping the bottom part hot.

The position of their eyes suggests that they had a very well developed sense of vision. The eye position of Tyrannosaurus rex was similar to that of modern humans, but their eyes and optic lobe were much larger than that of modern humans. T. rex, unlike most dinosaurs, had a combination of powerful eyesight and a great sense of smell. =Ceratosauria= Ceratosaurs had eyes placed closer to the side. This widened their field of vision, but decreased their depth perception.

Deel 3 De Witt ‚Äì Genealogie The family have played an important role during the Dutch Golden Age. They were at the centre of Dordrecht and Holland oligarchy from the end of the 16th century until 1672.  The De Witt family during the Dutch Golden Age  During the Dutch Golden Age, the republican De Witt family opposed the royalists associated with the House of Orange-Nassau. With other republican political leaders at Dordrecht, such as the Van Slingelandts, and at Amsterdam with the Bicker and De Graeff families, the De Witts worked to abolish stadtholdership. They sought full sovereignty for individual regions, so that the Republic of the United Seven Netherlands would not yield to authoritarianism. Instead of a sovereigns (or stadtholder), political and military power would be entrusted to the States General and Holland's city regents. From 1650 into the 1670s, the De Witts played leading roles in Dutch government. Republicans called this era the Ware Vrijheid (True Freedom), the First Stadtholderless Period. The De Witt family lost its leadership role in Rampjaar 1672, when Orangists resumed leadership and murdered brothers Johan and Cornelis de Witt.

The Coalition won a substantial majority ‚Äì the Liberals winning 61 seats and the Country Party 21 ‚Äì with the Labor Party winning 41 and 1 Independent in the Australian House of Representatives (representing the largest parliamentary majority in 65 years).http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/holt/elections.aspx The Coalition had governed since 1949, and the Liberal Party had replaced the retiring Robert Menzies with Holt in January 1966.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/holt/in-office.aspx Following the 1966 election, Gough Whitlam replaced Arthur Calwell as Leader of the Opposition. On 17 December 1967, Holt disappeared in heavy surf while swimming off Cheviot Beach, near Melbourne, becoming the third Australian Prime Minister to die in office.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/holt/in- office.aspx#section5 Country Party leader John McEwen served as Prime Minister from 19 December 1967 to 10 January 1968, pending the election of a new leader of the Liberal Party of Australia.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/mcewen/ McEwen ruled out maintaining the Coalition if deputy Liberal leader William McMahon became Prime Minister. John McEwen, leader of the Country Party, had been sworn in as caretaker Prime Minister until a new Liberal leader was elected. McEwen had ruled out further participation in the Coalition if William McMahon, the deputy Liberal leader, became Prime Minister. The Minister for External Affairs, Paul Hasluck, Minister for Labour and National Service Leslie Bury and Minister for Immigration Billy Snedden, also nominated for election to the leadership. Gorton won the leadership election with a small majority and resigned from the Senate to stand for election to Higgins, the House of Represensatives seat formerly held by Harold Holt, which he achieved on 24 February 1968.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/gorton/before- office.aspx =John Gorton= Gorton being sworn in as Prime Minister on 10 January 1968. John Gorton had studied Politics, History and Economics at Oxford University and served as pilot in the Royal Australian Airforce during the Second World War. His aircraft crashed during the defence of Singapore, and Gorton was badly injured. His face remained forever scarred, but Gorton managed to escape, only for his ship to be torpedoed at Batavia ‚Äì where, by clinging to an improvised raft, he again escaped death and was able to return to Australia for medical treatment and to serve in the air defence of Northern Australian and New Guinea. Gorton obtained a seat as a Liberal Senator at the 1949 Election and was promoted by Robert Menzies to become Minister for the Navy 9 years later and he went on to serve in various portfolios in both the Menzies and Holt Governments. In 1967, Prime Minister Harold Holt appointed Gorton as Leader of the Government in the Senate. Soon after, Holt drowned and Gorton decided to run for the office of Prime Minister, though he lacked a House of Representatives seat. Liberal Patriarch Robert Menzies favoured Paul Hasluck. Future Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser firmly backed Gorton. The leadership ballot was fervently contested.Brian Carroll; From Barton to Fraser; Cassell Australia; 1978 In his 2010 Memoir, Lazarus Rising, long serving Liberal Prime Minister John Howard wrote that Gorton was the first person to win the leadership of an Australian party \\"through the force of his television appearances\\". In the lead up to the leadership vote, Gorton was little known but appeared on television, where, wrote Howard, he gave direct answers and his \\"relaxed, laconic manner, coupled with his crumpled war-hero face, really appealed to viewers\\".John Howard; Lazarus Rising: A Personal and Political Autobiography; Harper Collins; 2010. Political commentator Alan Reid said:Brian Carroll; From Barton to Fraser; Cassell Australia; 1978 Gorton's leadership style Gorton in 1968. Gorton, a former World War II RAAF pilot, with a battle scarred face, said he was \\"Australian to the bootheels\\" and had a personal style which often affronted some conservatives. Gorton told the media that he saw the role of Prime Minister not as being like the chairman of committee, who should submit to majority votes of Cabinet, but rather that a Prime Minister should put his position to Cabinet as what ought to be done, and \\"if he believes strongly enough that it ought to be done, then it must be done\\". Accordingly, he visited President Johnson of the United States in 1968 without taking any advisors from External Affairs and interfered heavily in the preparation of Treasurer William McMahon's budgets. According to political historian Brian Carroll:Brian Carroll; From Barton to Fraser; Cassell Australia; 1978 Domestic policy =Social policy= The Gorton Government increased funding for the arts, setting up the Australian Council for the Arts, the Australian Film Development Corporation and the National Film and Television Training School. It passed legislation establishing equal pay for men and women and increased pensions, allowances and education scholarships, as well as providing free health care to 250,000 of the nation's poor (but not universal health care).http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/gorton/in-office.aspx The government also passed the Copyright Act 1968, the first national copyright legislation of Australian origin; previously Australia had simply used the British Copyright Act 1911. The new act, which came into effect on 1 May 1969, \\"completely overhauled the copyright law and introduced new provisions\\", and remains in force although some amendments have been made. The bill had been first introduced by the Holt Government in 1967, based on the Spicer Committee's report of 1959. The Australian Metric Conversion Act 1970 created the Metric Conversion Board to facilitate conversion to the metric system. With a few exceptions, metrication was completed by the end of 1974. =Energy= Gorton had been an advocate of nuclear power since the 1950s. In his policy speech at the 1969 election, he pledged to \\"take Australia into the atomic age\\". Later that year, he secured cabinet approval for the construction of a nuclear reactor in the Jervis Bay Territory, which would have been Australia's first nuclear power plant (though not the first nuclear reactor). Tenders were issued for the plant's construction and some construction was begun, but the project was cancelled in June 1971 after McMahon became prime minister. A 2002 documentary, Fortress Australia, claimed that the real motive for the creation of the plant was to allow Australia to build its own nuclear weapons. =Centralism= Gorton had earned a reputation as a centralist during his time as an active Education Minister ‚Äì a responsibility formerly considered the preserve of state governments. As prime minister, it was his decision to seek control of offshore mineral resources for the Commonwealth which cemented this reputation. =Other= In December 1970 Gorton announced that the previous 50-year public access rule for classified cabinet documents would be reduced to 30 years. Foreign policy President Richard Nixon of the United States, meeting with Gorton on 26 April 1971. Gorton maintained good relations with the United States and Britain, but pursued closer ties with Asia. Gorton's government kept Australia in the Vietnam War but stopped replacing troops at the end of 1970.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/gorton/in-office.aspx =Defence= Gorton initially considered support for a \\"Fortress Australia\\" defence policy that would involve building Australia's independent industrial and military capacity. The Gorton Government opposed expansion of Australia's commitment to the Vietnam War. It also faced the withdrawal of British forces from Malaysia and Singapore and after extended consideration of the development, committed to retaining forces in Malaya ‚Äì but stressed that they could not be used to maintain civil law and order.Brian Carroll; From Barton to Fraser; Cassell Australia; 1978 Gorton appointed his supporter, Malcolm Fraser, as Defence Minister ‚Äì but the relationship between the pair deteriorated and Fraser resigned in 1971, precipitating a leadership crisis. 1969 election and leadership tensions Gorton with William McMahon shortly after the unsuccessful leadership challenge in 1969. The Gorton government experienced a decline in voter support at the 1969 election. State Liberal leaders saw his policies as too Centralist, while other Liberals did not like his personal behaviour. Prior to the 1969 election, Gorton had largely retained the Holt-McEwen ministry he inherited. After the 1969 election, Malcolm Fraser replaced the retired Allen Fairhall as Minister for Defence, Don Chipp, Senator Bob Cotton, Senator Tom Drake-Brockman (Country Party), Mac Holten (Country Party), Tom Hughes, James Killen and Andrew Peacock were promoted into the ministry. In his 2010 memoir, John Howard wrote of the 1969 Election that Whitlam outperformed Gorton during the Election campaign. In Howard's assessment, Gorton had an \\"appealing personality, direct style and was extremely intelligent\\" but it was his \\"lack of general discipline over such things as punctuality that did him damage\\". After the election, Gorton faced leadership challenges from David Fairbairn, a senior minister from New South Wales and from Deputy Leader Bill McMahon. Of the period Howard wrote: \\"By this time John McEwen had dropped his veto of McMahon, a sure sign that the Country Party had grown uneasy with Gorton's governing style.John Howard; Lazarus Rising: A Personal and Political Autobiography; Harper Collins; 2010. Gorton resignation Defence Minister Malcolm Fraser resigned in March 1971, precipitating a leadership crisis. Tensions within the government came to a point when David Fairbairn, the Minister for National Development, announced a refusal to serve in a Gorton Cabinet. Fairbairn and Treausurer William McMahon, unsuccessfully challenged Gorton for leadership of the Liberal Party. McMahon was removed from Treasury to External Affairs and Leslie Bury was appointed Treasurer.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/gorton/in- office.aspx The Government performed poorly in the 1970 half senate election adding to pressures on Gorton's leadership. Defence minister Malcolm Fraser developed an uneasy relationship with Gorton and in early 1971, Fraser accused Gorton of being disloyal to him in a conflict with Army officials over progress in South Vietnam.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/fraser/before- office.aspx Fraser was engaged in a struggle over authority with service chiefs, when in 1971, journalist Alan Ramsay published an article quoting Defence Chief Sir Thomas Daly as having described Fraser as extremely disloyal to the army and to its junior minister, Andrew Peacock. Ramsay had conferred with Gorton prior to publishing the article, but Gorton had not repudiated its contents. Fraser seized upon the report, resigned and accused Gorton of intolerable disloyalty.Brian Carroll; From Barton to Fraser; Cassell Australia; 1978 On 9 March Fraser told Parliament that Gorton was \\"not fit to hold the great office of Prime Minister\\".http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/gorton/in- office.aspx Fraser accused Gorton of obstinacy and a dangerous reluctance to take advice from Cabinet or the Public Service.Brian Carroll; From Barton to Fraser; Cassell Australia; 1978 John Howard wrote of Gorton-Fraser relationship that Fraser had been one of Gorton's key backers in 1968, when Gorton secured the leadership after the death of Holt, yet \\"it was Fraser quitting the Government, followed by a searing resignation speech, which triggered the events producing Gorton's removal\\".John Howard; Lazarus Rising: A Personal and Political Autobiography; Harper Collins; 2010. On 10 March, the Liberal party room moved to debate and vote on a motion of confidence in Gorton as party leader, resulting in a 33‚Äì33 tie. Under Liberal rules of the time, this meant Gorton retained the leadership. However, Gorton declared that a tie vote was not a true vote of confidence, and resigned the leadership. Former treasurer, William McMahon, replaced Gorton as Prime Minister.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/mcmahon/in- office.aspx Aftermath Gorton was elected deputy leader and was appointed as Minister for Defence by Prime Minister William McMahon. Soon after however, Gorton wrote a series of articles for the Sunday Australian entitled \\"I did it my way\\", enabling McMahon to ask for and receive Gorton's resignation from Cabinet and as Deputy Leader. Gorton became an internal critic of the party. John Howard wrote in 2010 that the \\"personal animosity which flowed from the manner of Gorton's removal as prime minister was the most intense that I have ever seen in politics. Gorton never forgave Fraser for his perceived betrayal. In March 1975, when Malcolm Fraser was elected Leader of the Liberal Party, Gorton, who had voted for Snedden, immediately the result of the ballot was announced, walked out of the party room, slamming the door behind him, and never returned to the room again.\\" Gorton contested the 1975 Election an independent candidate for the Senate.John Howard; Lazarus Rising: A Personal and Political Autobiography; Harper Collins; 2010. McMahon's premiership ended when Gough Whitlam led the Australian Labor Party out of its 23-year period in Opposition at the 1972 Election.

Building Built by the architects of firm Schack and Huntington, the structure is commonly placed into the Beaux arts style of architecture. This is important in that previously churches in the area had been built in what is commonly considered the Gothic Revival style of architecture. This shift is considered to be the result of a progressive change in order to reference the new age of the 20th century. The change is thought to be a representation of a new simpler time as shown with the simple, yet still elegant exterior terracotta reliefs, and the harmonious synchronization of how these pieces become a whole. The building's base measures at by with a maximum height of from street level. The form is a centrally planned Bastille like structure modeled after classical churches such as the order of Saints Sergius and Bacchus in Constantinople. The rectangular base rises from the ground with a terracotta vine pattern relief cornice, which has since been removed. The fa√ßade is a large beige brick with a light cream colored terracotta trim. All four sides of the base have been extruded to create 4 alcoves. There lie fenestrations on three of the four sides of the base, with original elegant stained glass windows laid into each of the openings. In the final alcove the structure houses a full pipe organ, as well as a stage which was previously used as the church's altar. On top of the base lies a cylinder with stained glass windows that allows light into the interior shaft. Above that is a 64‚Äô in diameter dome that is covered in red terracotta tile paneling. The main room is a large auditorium. This space is 3 stories tall going from the floor to the top of the dome measures 66‚Äô in height. The ground level houses enough seating for 1,224 people. The west alcove is where the altar lies. In the other three are the entrance to the east, and the stairs to the three upper galleries which house an additional 600 seats. The basement houses the footing for the primary columns which extend up 72‚Äô from the base. This below grade basement houses rooms that were previously meant as a classroom, suit for the pastor, a parlor, a banquet hall, a kitchen, and a few small multi-purpose rooms. The building includes \\"highly artistic stained glass windows\\" attributed to Povey Brothers Glass Company. (includes 40 photos) History The organ, 2007 The early history of the structure was that the ground was broken, and the foundation stone laid in 1907. First Methodist Episcopal Church (the 1853 - 1939 name of the congregation now known as First United Methodist Church) had moved from an older church on 3rd Avenue and Marion Street when the building when it opened in 1908. In 1950 the church had the addition of an education wing added to the South side of the structure. This structure ranged from 2 to 4 stories in height. The addition was to accommodate the large need of the church for a space for community outreach and religious studies. Along with this addition to the education wing, the front entrance was also the tear down and reconstruction on the front stairs on 5th avenue was completed. Due to the new design a scheme, the main entrance is now entered from each side and the back of the main room. This eliminated the original sequence of movement from street to sanctuary, and created a wall along Fifth Avenue.Bhatt, Sanjay. \\"Deal Preserves Downtown Church; Congregation Will Move.\\" Seattle Times May 30, 2007, Print. Then in 1984 there was a petition submitted to the National Register of Historic Places to put the site on the list.Larry, Kreisman. United States. National Register Nomination For 5th Avenue and Marion Street. 1984. Print. This motion failed due to the opposition of the church itself needing to gain enough money from the sale to relocate to a more convenient location. The church, city, and preservationists were in a battle until a deal was brought to the table, and agreed upon in 2007. The church was eventually listed on the National Register on January 3, 2011. The elaborate cornice of the sanctuary was removed in 1990. This removal of the cornice still affects the appearance of the building today. The city approved plans put up by the Rainier Club for a skyscraper on the site in 2004. The plan met a great deal of resistance from preservationists. The church never reached a deal with the new development, as such the plan was never implemented.National Trust for Historic Preservation, . Seattle, WA: Print. In 2007 Daniels Development took over the land, and as the deal stated in 2008 the church education wing on the southern side of the sanctuary was torn down.Bhatt, Sanjay. \\"Historic Church Sanctuary Will Remain.\\" Seattle Times May 22, 2007, Web.

March 23, 2009. More than 57 noontime concerts were presented over 6 years, and many other evening concerts and events were also booked in the Hall. Many of these concerts were filmed and aired on the local television show Crescendo! by International Artists Records. The television program originally aired on SCANTV, and later on Seattle Community Media (SCM) at North Seattle College. Crescendo! also has aired across the country on Time Warner Cable. These concerts continued until December 2014, when preparation for reconstruction of the Recital Hall in 2015 began.Stiles, Marc. \\"Should auld acquaintance be forgot: Last concert ‚Äì for awhile ‚Äì at historic Seattle church\\" Puget Sound Business Journal.

Preservation For 25 years preservation of the church was a contested issue between the city, the First United Methodist Church, preservationists, and developers. The first attempt to preserve the church was in 1984. At this time Larry Kreisman presented an application to the national historic registry to have the sanctuary placed on its list of historic places. After the city designated the sanctuary a landmark in 1985, First United won a state Supreme Court decision in 1996 that declared all religious buildings exempt from landmark status. In 1990 the cornice was removed from the sanctuary. This was the first major change to the church itself in terms of preservation since the 1950 addition and remodel. The visual effects of this are still visible on the exterior of the church today. Then in 2004, plans for a tower to be placed on the site gained city approval. This proposal met resistance from preservationists, as well as church officials, for its plan of tearing down the nearly 100-year-old structure. The plan was never implemented, though it led to the city asking the church about its intentions for what would happen to the land and the building. Although the church needed to sell the land to obtain the money necessary to relocate, they did not want the sanctuary itself to be torn down. Discussions continued between the church, the city, preservationists, and developers until 2007 when Kevin Daniels and his company Nitze-Stagen & Co., developed a deal.Matlick, Justin. \\"Saving Historic Church With Perseverance and a Prayer.\\" Puget Sound Business Journal June 3, 2007, Web. This deal was approved by all parties. The plan was to tear down the education wing that was built in 1950. The developer would repurpose the sanctuary itself, and build an economically feasible tower in the empty space where the educational wing once stood. The church sanctuary has since been repurposed into a recital hall, and has housed concerts and other events since 2009. Demolition of the educational wing took place in 2008, and construction on the F5 Tower began in October 2014 and was completed in May 2017.

'China's Leaders See a Calendar Full of Anniversaries, and Trouble'. The New York Times, 9 March 2009. Under the campaign, all provinces and municipalities were required to establish temporary 6521 taskforces under the local Communist Party and Public Security leadership. Authorities at the township and county levels were also required to implement the 6521 project, reporting on their progress to municipal or provincial taskforces above them.Cary Huang, ‚Äò‚ÄòTaskforces Set Up To Keep Lid on Protests,‚Äô‚Äô South China Morning Post, 28 February 2009Congressional Executive Commission on China. \\"2009 Annual Report\\" , 10 Oct 2009. In parallel to the 6521 Project, a top-level coordinating body was created under the direction of Zhou Yongkang, called the \\"Central Committee for Comprehensive Management of Social Order.\\" The committee identified a series of potential threats to social order, and prescribed measures to suppress them. The threats named included ethnic separatism in Tibet, Falun Gong, protests triggered by unemployment, land grabs, tainted products and labor disputes, crime, and the illicit installation of satellite receivers and illegal publishing. The Committee set out 33 measures to ensure social stability. It also revived a network of volunteer informants in schools and neighborhoods, and established a joint responsibility system that holds heads of households, work units, and local governments accountable in the event of protests or other destabilizing events.Ching Cheong. \\"China Acts to Defuse 'Crisis Year'\\".

MALPAS is well suited to the independent static analysis required by the UK's Health and Safety Executive guidance for computer based protection systems for nuclear reactors due to its rigour and flexibility in handling many programming languages.Computer based safety systems - technical guidance for assessing software aspects of digital computer based protection systems,  Technical Overview  The MALPAS toolset comprises five specific analysis tools that address various properties of a program. The input to the analysers needs to be written in MALPAS Intermediate Language (IL); this can be hand- written or produced by an automated translation tool from the original source code. Automatic translators exist for common high-level programming languages such as Ada, C and Pascal, as well as assembler languages such as Intel 80*86, PowerPC and 68000. The IL text is input into MALPAS via the \\"IL Reader\\", which constructs a directed graph and associated semantics for the program under analysis. The graph is reduced using a series of graph reduction techniques. The MALPAS toolset consists of 5 analysers:Industrial Perspective on Static Analysis.

Marsh. http://www.ida.liu.se/~TDDC90/papers/industrial95.pdf # Control Flow Analyser. This examines the program structure, identifying key features: Entry/Exit points, Loops, Branches and unreachable code. It provides a summary report drawing attention to undesirable constructs and an indication of the complexity of the program structure. # Data Use Analyser. This separates the variables and parameters used by the program into distinct classes depending upon their use. (i.e. Data that is read before being written, Data that is written without being read or Data that is written twice without an intervening read). The report can identify errors such as uninitialised data and function outputs not written on all paths. # Information Flow Analyser. This identifies the data and branch dependencies for each output variable or parameter. Unwanted or unexpected dependencies can be revealed for all paths through the code. Information is also provided regarding unused variables and redundant statements. # Semantic Analyser (also known as symbolic execution). This reveals the exact functional relationship between all inputs and outputs over all semantically-feasible paths through the code. # Compliance Analyser. This compares the mathematical behaviour of the code with its formal IL specification, detailing where one differs from the other. The IL specification is written as Preconditions and Postconditions, as well as optional code assertions. Compliance analysis can be used to gain a very high level of confidence in the functional correctness of the code in relation to its specification.  History  The original research and initial generations of the toolset were created by the UK's Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE) in Malvern, England (hence the derivation of the name, MALvern Programming Analysis Suite). It was used extensively in the civil nuclear and weapons field in the 1980's, when it was supported by Rex, Thompson and Partners, who set up the MALPAS User Group, with the first chair being David H Smith (now of Frazer-Nash) and then subsequently by Advantage Technical Consulting (bought by Atkins in 2008). The first large scale static analysis task was on the primary reactor protection system for the Sizewell B power station. This was the UK's first nuclear power station to employ a computer- based protection system as its first line of defence against a catastrophic failure. Further to this, CEZ in the Czech Republic employed MALPAS to increase the confidence in the reactor protection system in the Temelin Nuclear Power Station. In 1995 the UK's Royal Air Force commissioned independent analysis of the Lockheed Martin C130J's avionics software assessed as safety-critical. MALPAS was used for the analysis of this software, apart from the Mission Computer software, which was written in Spark Ada and verified with the Spark Toolset.Static Code Analysis on the C-130J Hercules Safety-Critical Software  References  Formal methods tools Software testing tools Theorem proving software systems Model checkers Static program analysis tools ","title":"MALPAS Software Static Analysis Toolset"},{"id":"31220624","text":"March√© Medina is a market in Conakry, Guinea and one of the largest markets in West Africa.

Background Based upon a true story, the film was shot on locations in Sri Lanka and Germany. The inspiration came from the actual case of the 2004 incident, where a fake Sri Lankan national handball team tricked its way into a German tournament, lost all of their matches, and subsequently vanished. Production spent several weeks speaking with people in the less fortunate areas of Colombo and used the people met through that research to create the backgrounds of the main characters. When director Uberto Pasolini heard of the incident, he stated \\"I fell in love with the story so much that I decided to shoot it myself\\". Under the working title of Handball, the film was produced and financed by Redgrave Films (UK), RAI Cinema (Italy), Babelsberg Films (Germany), and Shakthi Films (Sri Lanka), and had its premiere at the Venice Film Festival in August 2008, where it received a 10-minute standing ovation. After the film completed its rounds of film festivals, it had commercial theatrical debut in Italy in September 2009, and was then picked up by UGC for theatrical distribution in Germany, France, Switzerland, Canada, Belgium, Norway and Sweden, and by Yume Pictures for theatrical release in the United Kingdom October 2009 and DVD distribution April 2010. Synopsis Two friends, Manoj (Gihan De Chickera), a bartender, and Stanley (Dharmapriya Dias), a fruit vendor, wish to immigrate to the West to seek their fortune, but have difficulties getting their visa applications approved. They come across an application to a handball tournament in Bavaria, and not even knowing what the game is, they submit themselves and a group of friends as the \\"Sri Lanka National Handball Team\\". For appearance's sake, they begin minimal training and then seek travel visas from the German Embassy. Manoj leaves the group at the last moment, but the rest fly to Germany. Their plans to simply escape into the West upon arrival in Germany are thwarted by the quick appearance of the tournament organizers and an arena of fans eager to see the powers of the Sri Lanka National Handball Team. After losing the first matches without any goals, the team finally shoots a goal, which makes them overjoyed. The next morning, the police arrives and ransacks the hotel, but could not find any trace of the Sri Lankan Handball team. Later, it is shown that each member goes on his own path to various different countries in Europe.

Gusto and underlying honesty make it a winner.\\" The Guardian began their review by writing, \\"There is more ingenuity, guts and brilliance in the developing world as depicted in Uberto Pasolini's film than anything Hollywood can cobble together.\\" The reviewer wrote that the film was \\"one of the most important films to come out of the developing world in recent years\\", and one of the best films about illegal immigration that he'd seen. He praised the film's sense of \\"genuine authenticity\\", in its \\"rendering the reality of Colombo street life in all its vivid squalor, frustration, humanity and comedy\\", and noted that Sri Lankans have taken the film \\"to their hearts and claimed entirely as their own.\\" Noting the film as being based on an actual event, the reviewer wrote \\"There had never been a single handball team in the whole country, let alone a national side, and the scam has to go down as one of the most ingenious illegal immigration ploys ever undertaken.

Born near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Hooker has achieved his largest successes with Roman Catholic-themed music, including Singing the Rosary and Our Priests. His latest album, Heaven's On Its Way, was released in March 2011. Personal life Hooker was born in Wilmington, Delaware and raised in Linwood, Pennsylvania, a Philadelphia suburb. He wrote mainly secular pop and rock-n-roll music with positive, patriotic, inspirational or environmentalist messages until the early 1980s, when he felt God calling him to focus his music more directly on spiritual themes. For a time, he put his secular music aside to devote his time to \\"Singing the Rosary,\\" a fully sung and orchestrated version of the holy rosary. The first of its kind, \\"Singing the Rosary\\" was given to Pope John Paul II in 1991. Eventually his faith, and his self-admitted need for conversion, led him to Medjugorje, in present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, where on Easter Sunday of 1990, he met his wife, Bridget, an American also on a pilgrimage. The two were married soon after, and his wife often accompanies him on his albums as a producer, backup vocalist and co-composer. Hooker is known in Pennsylvania's Delaware Valley for his advocacy and untiring environmentalist efforts as president of We Are the People, Inc., an environmental advocacy group that he founded to fight pollution in his neighboring town of Marcus Hook. Hooker is a photographer and the copyright holder of two photographs, \\"The Good Shepherd\\" and \\"The White Cross\\", both taken in Medjugorje that have attained worldwide attention. These photos depict what many claim is a \\"miracle\\" or a \\"divine manifestation\\" in the clouds. Hooker and Hylak's first son, Luke John, died as a child from liver cancer; this tragedy has profoundly influenced Hooker's later music and spirituality. The family now resides in West Grove, Pennsylvania, where they own a multilingual web design and ASCAP music publishing company, Come Alive Communications, Inc. Career =Our Priests= Perhaps Hooker's greatest acclaim came in 2009 with Our Priests, a short album whose eponymous lead single garnered awards from Roman Catholic societies worldwide. This first track voices support for the countless Catholic priests who live selfless lives of devotion to the Church while a relative few fuel the institution's scandal. Pope Benedict XVI bestowed an Apostolic Blessing on the work in February 2010.

Biography Born to Edward Hitchcock Sr., the geologist and President of Amherst College, and wife Orra White, Hitchcock attended Williston Seminary as a boy and continued his education while following in his father's footsteps by entering Amherst College in the fall of 1845. Hitchcock Jr. graduated from Amherst college in 1849. From 1850 to 1861, with the exception of a single year (1852‚Äì53), he was teacher of elocution and natural science at Williston Seminary. In 1853, he obtained the degree of doctor of medicine from the Harvard Medical School. The same year, after receiving his doctorate, he married Mary Judson. They had ten children; three of whom died in infancy. Hitchcock Jr. returned to Amherst College in 1861 as professor of Hygiene and Physical Education. Hitchcock Jr. was the first ever physical educator. History Colleges had hired physical educators since the early 1820s, but Edward Hitchcock Jr. is generally credited with being the first formal physical educator at the collegiate level. He believed in the importance of sound physical health for college students, so that the mind could accomplish its best work and students could look forward to \\"the promised labor of a long life.\\" To achieve that goal, he developed systems of physical training intended to appeal to the students both mentally and physically. His program at Amherst became a model for college and secondary school programs nationally and internationally. The development of this first college program was Hitchcock's major contribution to the field of physical education. Contributions Edward Hitchcock Jr. contributed to Amherst College not only with his enlightened ideas concerning physical education, but also with his genuine personality. Hitchcock Jr. was noted as a kind, broad- minded, vigorous, optimistic, honest, faithfully religious man with shrewd common sense and an intense loyalty to the college.

She campaigned successfully to have some of her female trainees accepted into the all-male Navy, thereby originating the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service (WRANS). Some 12,000 servicemen passed through her signal instruction school in Sydney, acquiring skill in Morse code and visual signalling (flag semaphore and International Code of Signals). She set up her own electrical contracting business in 1918, and apprenticed herself to it, in order to meet the requirements of the Diploma in Electrical Engineering at Sydney Technical College and in 1922 she was the first Australian woman to take out an amateur radio operator's licence. Through the 1920s and 1930s, her \\"Wireless Shop\\" in Sydney's Royal Arcade was renowned amongst Sydney radio experimenters and hobbyists. She founded The Wireless Weekly in 1922, established the Electrical Association for Women in 1934, and wrote the first \\"all-electric cookbook\\" in 1936. She also corresponded with Albert Einstein in the postwar years. Family and education Florence Violet McKenzie was born Florence Violet Granville on 28 September 1890 in Melbourne although, before her marriage to Cecil McKenzie at the age of 34, she was known as Violet Wallace. Other sources cite 1892 as her birth year. Wallace was her stepfather George's surname; he was a commercial traveller. When Violet was an infant, the family moved to Austinmer, south of Sydney. From a young age, Violet had an independent interest in electricity and invention. As she recalled in an oral history interview in 1979: > I used to play about with bells and buzzers and things around the house. My > mother would sometimes say \\"Oh, come and help me find something, it's so > dark in this cupboard\\" ‚Äì she didn't have very good eyesight‚Ä¶ So I'd get a > battery and I'd hook a switch, and when she opened that cupboard door a > light would come on‚Ä¶ I started sort of playing with those things.

By March 1922, she had won the diploma.\\"Women and Wireless\\" in The Mercury, 18 March 1922, p. 14 column 3. In December 1923, McKenzie graduated from the Sydney Technical College. She later gave her Diploma ‚Äì the first of its kind awarded in Australia to a woman ‚Äì to the collection of the Powerhouse Museum, also in Ultimo. Violet McKenzie and husband Cecil McKenzie c1935 Cecil Roland McKenzie was a young electrical engineer employed by the Sydney County Council's Electricity Undertaking. He too was a radio enthusiast, and one of Violet's customers at the shop. They were married at the Church of St Philip in Auburn on New Year's Eve 1924. They built a house at 26 George Street, Greenwich Point complete with a wireless room in the attic. Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. The house remains, but has been extensively renovated since the McKenzies lived there. The McKenzies had a daughter, stillborn, in 1926.Sydney Morning Herald, 19 July 1926, p. 10 column 1. They sometimes took in the two sons of Violet's only sibling, Walter Reginald Wallace, from Melbourne. According to the Sands Directory these boys, Merton Reginald Wallace and Lindsay Gordon Wallace, later operated their own radio shop in Prahran, Melbourne.. Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. Early employment and interests The Wireless Shop Miss F.V. Wallace, electrical engineer Violet taught mathematics at Armadale, before deciding to take a course in electrical engineering. Throughout her studies, Miss Wallace worked as an electrical contractor, installing electricity in private houses, such as that of politician Archdale Parkhill in Mosman, and in factories and commercial premises, including the Standard Steam Laundry on Dowling Street, Woolloomooloo. She was an enthusiastic wireless experimenter, being licensed to receive from late 1922 shortly after the commencement of the new Wireless Regulations of 1922 (callsign 2GA, later A2GA, OA2GA, VK2GA). She passed the Amateur Operator's Proficiency Certificate in 1925 (the first woman to do so) and thereafter was permitted to transmit. She held her licence continuously till the commencement of WW2 in 1939 when all amateur transmitting privileges were withdrawn for the duration. When amateur licensing resumed in 1946, her allocated callsign was VK2FV. In 1922 Miss Wallace opened \\"The Wireless Shop\\", after purchasing the entire stock of the wireless vendor who preceded her ‚Äì billing itself as \\"the oldest radio shop in town\\" Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. ‚Äì in the Royal Arcade (which ran from George Street through to Pitt Street ‚Äì replaced in the 1970s by the Hilton hotel).Ric Havyatt quoted in Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. McKenzie later said it was schoolboys visiting her shop who first introduced her to Morse code. Australia's first weekly radio magazine was conceived at the shop, by Miss Wallace and three co-founders. \\"The Wireless Weekly\\" became the monthly magazine \\"Radio & Hobbies\\", then \\"Radio, Television & Hobbies\\", and finally Electronics Australia, and remained in circulation until 2001. McKenzie working with the wireless radio c1922 In 1924 McKenzie became the only female member of the Wireless Institute of Australia. That same year she travelled to the United States for business reasons, and in San Francisco was welcomed at radio 6KGO: 'Miss Wallace, an electrical engineer from Australia, will now talk from the studio.' She reportedly used her time on air to comment on the difference between the tram systems in San Francisco and those in Sydney. Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. In 1931 she also notes that she experimented with improving the science of television through the use of chemistry: > \\"[I] have a pronounced kink for television work and devote most of my spare > time in experimenting that branch of the science. Have a deep-rooted > conviction that chemistry is going to provide the solution and am working > along those lines.\\" Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. The McKenzies had a mutual interest in tropical fish and had an enormous fishpond in the front yard. Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. She spoke of heating water electrically to house tropical fish at home in the early 1920s, and of having given talks on Radio 2FC about tropical fish in the days when she was doing electrical contracting work. In January 1933 the American journal Aquariana published an article written by McKenzie concerning 'Some interesting inhabitants of Sydney seashores', in which she recommended keeping sea horses in a salt-water tank. Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. McKenzie join the British based Women's Engineering Society in the 1930s (at that time the only organisation for women engineers in the world) and was described by as \\"our most distant\\" member in an article in The Woman Engineer journal 1942. Women's technical education The rooms of the Electrical Association for Women, c1936. McKenzie sitting at the piano In the 1930s, McKenzie turned her attention increasingly to teaching other women about electricity and radio. She had observed the need over years of working in the field herself. In 1925, she told the Australian Woman's Mirror: \\"[T]here are such a lot of women experimenters [amongst my customers] that I would like to form a Women's Wireless Club.\\" In 1931 she told a Sunday Sun reporter that she wanted to see a course of lectures on domestic radio and electricity established in girls' schools and technical colleges. Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. The following year she took matters into her own hands, opening a Women's Radio College on Phillip Street in 1932. She persuaded employers to take on some of her trainees, as one of them later recalled: > During the Depression I joined Mrs Mac's electrical school in Phillip > Street. It was the first time girls were involved with electrical circuits, > Morse and making radio sets. Later Mrs Mac decided it was time to use our > skills in industry, so she persuaded Airzone Ltd to take one of us (me) on > trial in their radio section. Soon the others followed from the school, and > we started the component parts section, and we were absorbed into many other > sections. Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. McKenzie believed that electricity could save women from domestic drudgery, writing that... \\"To see every woman emancipated from the \\"heavy\\" work of the household by the aid of electricity is in itself a worthy object.\\" Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. To this end in 1934 she founded an educational initiative, the Electrical Association for Women (EAW) at 170 King Street in the centre of Sydney, later moving a few blocks away to 9 Clarence Street. Concerned with safety when using electrical appliances, and no doubt drawing on her own experience in receiving an accidental electric shock that knocked her out for an hour, McKenzie delivered at least one talk on resuscitation, advising that conventional resuscitation should proceed for up to three- quarters of an hour following electrocution. She knew of one case where recovery took 4 hours.Cairns Post, 25 January 1935, p. 14 column 5; Australian Women's Weekly, 24 June 1933, p. 6. By 1936, McKenzie had sold the Wireless Shop, and was busy at the Electrical Association for Women. She gave electric cooking demonstrations in the EAW kitchen, which was fitted out with show electrical appliances by the Sydney County Council. She compiled the EAW Cookery Book, Australia's first \\"all-electric\\" cookery book, which ran into seven editions and remained in print until 1954. She wrote an illustrated book for children about electrical safety called The Electric Imps in 1938. In July 1938, McKenzie was one of 80 women in attendance at the inaugural meeting of the Australian Women's Flying Corps (later known as the Australian Women's Flying Club) held at the Feminist Club of New South Wales at 77 King Street. McKenzie was appointed treasurer and instructor in Morse code to the organisation. Women's Emergency Signalling Corps In 1939 McKenzie established the Women's Emergency Signalling Corps (WESC) in her Clarence Street rooms ‚Äì known affectionately as \\"Sigs\\". Her original idea was to train women in telegraphy so that they could replace men working in civilian communications, thereby freeing those skilled men up to serve in the war. Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. By the time war broke out, 120 women had been trained to instructional standard. Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. Women's Royal Australian Naval Service Dressed in the practical green uniforms designed by McKenzie, Corps members spell out W E S C in flag semaphore. McKenzie campaigned energetically to have some of her female trainees accepted into the Air Force and Navy as telegraphists. She encountered a great deal of official resistance. In 1940 she wrote to the Minister of the Navy, former Prime Minister WM (Billy) Hughes, saying \\"I would like to offer the services of our Signalling Corps, if not acceptable as telegraphists then at least as instructors.\\" Despite her suggestion being dismissed, some time later McKenzie and six trainees were provided third-class train tickets to Melbourne to meet with the Naval Board for testing. In early January 1941, Commander Newman, the Navy's Director of Signals and Communications, visited the WESC headquarters on Clarence Street to test McKenzie's trainees. Finding they were highly proficient, he recommended the Navy admit them. Hughes still took some convincing. After McKenzie threatened to take her offer to the Air Force instead, the urgent need for trained telegraphists prevailed, and on 21 April a Navy Office letter authorised the entry of women into the Navy. Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. This was the beginning of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service ‚Äì the WRANS. The minister's condition was that \\"no publicity...be accorded this break with tradition\\". On 28 April 1941, McKenzie accompanied 14 of her WESC trainees (twelve telegraphists and two domestic helpers). They had their medical test on 25 April and arrived at in Canberra on 28 April 1941. The women were dressed in their green WESC uniform which had been designed by McKenzie herself Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. ‚Äì it was several months before a female Navy uniform was ready. Francis Proven became WRANS number 1. From this initial intake of 14, the WRANS ranks expanded to some 2,600 by the end of the war, representing about 10 per cent of the entire Royal Australian Naval force at the time.Margaret Curtis-Otter, W.R.A.N.S.: The Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, The Naval Historical Society of Australia, Garden Island NSW, 1975, p 5. Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. All told, McKenzie trained about 3,000 women, one-third of whom went into the services. Many others remained at the Clarence Street school as instructors. In May 1941, the Air Force appointed McKenzie as an honorary flight officer of the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, so she could legitimately instruct Air Force personnel. Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. This was the only official recognition McKenzie received during the war for her efforts. Postwar wireless training Violet McKenzie helped with rehabilitation after the war, keeping her school open for as long as there was a need for instruction in wireless signalling. In the postwar years, she trained men from the merchant navy, pilots in commercial aviation, and others needing the trade qualification known as a \\"signaller's ticket\\". In 1948, a reporter from Sky Script visit to the school and described the scene, and the diversity of students: Mrs McKenzie with overseas naval personnel, c1953 > At a table in a corner recently there were six elementary trainees: One was > a Chinese quartermaster, another a half-Burmese.

In another corner > there's an ANA commander preparing for his 20-word-a-minute exam: an English > ship's wireless officer...an ex-RAF Wing-Commander...an Indian Navy man... > [and] groups of airline 'types' also on the job. McKenzie told a journalist that, after the war, \\"All the airmen came back and wanted to join Qantas, but they needed to build up their Morse speed and learn to use the modern equipment.\\" Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. The Department of Civil Aviation fitted out a room at the school with transmitters, receivers and radio compass so that pilots could train for their wireless ticket at the school. From 1948, McKenzie held a First Class Flight Radio Telephony Operator Licence. One of the ex-RAAF airmen who retrained for a civilian career with McKenzie wrote: > Being unemployed, we spent almost all of each weekday at the school, so if a > tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of > money.

McKenzie also trained Mervyn Wood, later Commissioner of Police in New South Wales, and the principals of the Navigation Schools at both the Melbourne and Sydney Technical Colleges.Resume of FV McKenzie's achievements prepared by the Ex- WRANS Association and held in the archives of the Ex-WRANS Association at the Naval Heritage Centre, Spectacle Island. Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. According to a People magazine profile of McKenzie written in January 1953, McKenzie received an unceremonious notice from the owners of 10 Clarence Street to quit the premises. The Sands Directory indicates that she moved her operation briefly to No 6 Wharf at Circular Quay in 1953, before retiring to her home at Greenwich Point in 1954. McKenzie wrote that she closed the school when the airlines established their own school and the government added a signals training section to the Navigation School at the Technical College. She continued to help the occasional pupil with special difficulties at her home. Later life =Correspondence with Einstein= In early 1949 McKenzie started writing to Albert Einstein. Her first letter to him wished him a speedy recovery from recent illness.Letter from FV McKenzie to Albert Einstein, 7 February 1949, held in the Albert Einstein Archives, Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. Two of her letters are held in the Einstein archives in Jerusalem. It is clear from the second letter that he wrote back to her at least once. Some accounts claim that McKenzie corresponded regularly with Einstein for as long as 15 years before his death in 1955, Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. but the documentary record suggests such reports exaggerate the extent of the correspondence. She also sent him several gifts over the years including shells (for his daughter) that airmen would collect across the Pacific on her request and a boomerang which had been brought to her from Central Australia by an airline pilot. She wrote that, \\"Some of your mathematical friends might like to plot its flight!\\"Letter from FV McKenzie to Albert Einstein, 28 February 1949, held in the Albert Einstein Archives, Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Cited in Dictionary of Sydney. There are other reports that she sent him a didgeridoo, and a recording of didgeridoo music when he replied that he couldn't work out how to play the instrument. =Awards and honours= On 8 June 1950, McKenzie was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her work with the WESC. In 1957 she was elected a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Navigation. In 1964 she became Patron of the Ex-WRANS Association. In 1979 she was made a Member of the Royal Naval Amateur Radio Society. In 1980 a plaque celebrating her \\"skills, character and generosity\\" was unveiled at the Missions to Seamen Mariners' Church, Flying Angel House. The Church has since relocated to 320 Sussex St, where the plaque can be seen in the garden. =Final years= Violet McKenzie was nine years older than her husband Cecil, but she outlived him by 23 years. After his death in 1958, she shared her house for a time with Cecil's sister Jean, a primary school teacher. In May 1977, after a stroke paralysed her right side and confined her to a wheelchair, McKenzie moved to the nearby Glenwood Nursing Home. She died peacefully in her sleep on 23 May 1982. At her funeral service, held at the Church of St Giles in Greenwich, 24 serving WRANS formed a Guard of Honour. McKenzie was cremated at the Northern Suburbs Crematorium. The June 1982 edition of the newsletter of the Ex-WRANS Association was devoted to their former teacher and patron. Amongst the memories recorded therein is a statement McKenzie made two days before she died: \\"...it is finished, and I have proved to them all that women can be as good as, or better than men.\\" Cited in Dictionary of Sydney.

The statue of two seated nude beings (possibly a male and female) with large skulls and thin bodies has writing on the back of one of the figures that has yet to be identified. Traces of dark pigment suggest that it was once painted. Vincent and Olga Diniacopoulos, who amassed a large collection of antiquities, brought the work to Canada in the 1950s. The sculpture was exhibited in the 1950s at their family-owned Galerie Ars Classica on Sherbrooke Street in Montreal. The name Saqqara refers to the burial ground of Memphis, Egypt. How the name came to be attached to the artifact is not known. The statue has been at Concordia University since 1999. Experts from the University of Cambridge, the British Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, the Israel Museum and the Royal Ontario Museum have all been consulted, without success. The script has been determined to not be Aramaic, Demotic, Egyptian, Hebrew, or Syriac. One expert, Clarence Epstein, suggests that it represents a pair of conquered captives.

This technique is very similar to one of the four forbidden techniques in Judo, the Do-Jime or Trunk hold. The main characteristic of the Body Triangle that distinguishes it from hooks is the commitment to the position, i.e. once executed the position is difficult to escape; however, it also severely limits the offensive options of the practitioner employing it.  Technique  Execution is achieved by first crossing the ankles, grasping the heel of one foot and pulling that foot into the opposite knee, this creates the signature ‚Äú4‚Äù shape for which the figure- four gets its name. As a secondary effect, it creates a significant amount of pressure against the ribs of the practitioner's opponent, hindering normal breathing and perpetuating swift fatigue. If executed with enough force, the resulting trauma to the ribcage can be substantial, in some cases even causing compressive asphyxia.  Offensive options  = Submission options = The most predominant submission attack associated with the body triangle is the rear naked choke. The resultant limited ability of the opponent to gain breath during the body lock compounds the effectiveness of the chokehold significantly, making this the ideal attack. Other attacks include variations on the neck crank, wrist locks and shoulder locks, but have a considerably lower percentage of success. The Body Triangle itself will sometimes cause an opponent to submit, however this tends to be less frequent due to the relatively high level of conditioning most practitioners of grappling arts possess. = Striking options = Due to the somewhat secure nature of the position, striking from the body triangle position has the potential to be advantageous; it gives the practitioner a stable platform from which to mount offensive strikes, especially to the head, and leaves little opportunity for escape. However, from a combat sport standpoint some of these striking techniques, especially attacks to the back of the head, are unallowable due to the considerable risk they pose to the practitioners.NSAC Regulations: CHAPTER 467 - UNARMED COMBAT. Nevada State Athletic Commission. Retrieved April 28, 2011  Defensive options  In order to escape or reverse the body triangle the first priority is to unlock the figure-four; this can be quite difficult depending on the skill of the practitioner performing the technique, and consequently often leaves a practitioner vulnerable to attack, either by striking or submission. Striking options are also severely limited when a practitioner is subject to a body-lock, the most common being a rear elbow strike to the head of the opponent.

The building is the seat of the Union di Ladins de Gherd√´inaUnion di Ladins de Gherd√´ina a cultural organisation for the keeping of the Ladin language and heritage in Val Gherd√´ina. In addition to the museum, the building hosts a library specialized in Ladin language and culture. The collections of the Gherd√´ina Museum enable the visitor to gain an informative insight into the cultural and natural world of Val Gherd√´ina. The collections are distributed over two floors and cover the following themes: wood carving art of the last three centuries, old locally produced wooden toys, a collection of paintings by local artists, the local archaeology, the region's fossils, minerals and the local flora and fauna.  Sections  = Entrance = At the entrance, the exhibition starts with several art objects like the Crucifix of S√´urasass (1932) by Baptist Walpoth and Vinzenz Peristi, as well as the oil painting by Josef Moroder-Lusenberg depicting Urtij√´i in the year 1860 and three modern canvasses by Franz Noflaner. = Interiors from the St. Jacob church = The first exhibition room is dedicated to the original sculptures from St.James church in Urtij√´i ascribed to Melchior (1622‚Äì1689) and Kassian (1710‚Äì1789) Vinazer. The local woodcarving Vinazer dynasty has had a lasting influence on the artistic production of Gherd√´ina. Also from St.James church is the original altarpiece (1751) by Franz Sebald Unterberger. The painting shows the Virgin Mary with child and the saints James and Henry. = Wooden sculptures from four centuries = The second exhibition room is dedicated to plastic art and offers a historical overview of the wood carving tradition of Gherd√´ina. To this collection belong works which range from those of the first famous woodcarving families Trebinger (1580‚Äì1689) and Vinazer (1622‚Äì1817) to a Saint Philomena of Rome by Dominik Mahlknecht (1796‚Äì1876), the sculptors of the 20th century Albin Pitscheider, Luis Insam-Tavella, Vinzenz Peristi and others. In addition, this room offers a wide variety of small sculptures ranging from the 18th to the mid-20th century, e.g. clock stands, caricatures, allegorical figures, cribs and crib figures and animal figurines. Of particular artistic interest as woodcarvings are the 120 figures by Albin Pitscheider (1877‚Äì1962), donated by his daughters. There is also a display of paintings by Josef Moroder-Lusenberg (1846‚Äì1939) and other local artists (e.g. Sontheimer, Demetz, Piazza). = Natural history of the Dolomites = Cymbospondylus, Ichthyosaurus from Seceda The third exhibition room is dedicated to natural history. The visitor is introduced to the evolution of the geological structure of the western Dolomites by way of didactic charts and illustrations arranged in cooperation with Prof. Broglio and Prof. Posenato of the University of Ferrara with a collection of local fossils, rocks and minerals. Among the fossils on show, special mention should be made of carbonized remainders of plants (Ortiseia), various gastropod imprints, a fossilized fish (Archaeolepidotus leonardii Accordi) and the reconstructed skeleton of an Ichthyosaurus, as well as coral colonies and ammonites. In addition to a cross-section of local minerals, including those typical of Mont S√´uc, this room also contains a collection of minerals from other alpine deposits (e.g. Teis, Ahrntal, Pfitsch) and from abroad, such as rock crystal, garnet, beryl, apophyllite, aragonite, sulphur, Celestine and amethyst. In the same room, another section offers an insight into the many-sided alpine flora and fauna by way of a herbarium and a collection of stuffed animals, e.g. an albino roe deer and local birds, and a butterfly collection. In the staircase to the second floor, the museum displays the Fastentuch (Lenten cloth) from the St.James's church in Urtij√´i (1620‚Äì30). = Wooden toys = In this room, you can find the old wooden toys from Gherd√´ina, one of the thematic highlights of the museum. This collection was, for the most part, brought together by Johann Senoner-Vastl√© before the Second World War. It consists of a most representative selection of toys, offering an overview of the diversity of articles produced in Gherd√´ina between 1750 and 1940. The typical Gherd√´ina jointed doll, called as well dutch doll, peg doll or stick doll, can be seen in many different sizes. = Prehistory of Gherd√´ina = A separate section on the second floor is dedicated to the prehistory of the valley. On show are the remarkable Stone Age finds from Plan de Frea under the Gardena Pass consisting of flint tools among the most ancient traces found in the Gherd√´ina region (ca. 7000-5000 B.C.) as well as the evidence from the Bronze Age (ca. 1700-750 B.C.), such as the bronze dagger from the Balest mountain or the bronze needles from Resciesa and Mastl√© in the Gherd√´ina Valley. The Iron Age finds from the large complex of Col de Flam a hill near Urtij√´i, e.g. burial offerings from cremation graves, in particular fibulae, rings and iron lance heads, single glass beads and bronze pendants as well as various tools (400-15 B.C. Lat√®ne period). = Luis Trenker = On the second floor the other section is dedicated to the writer, actor, film director and rock climber Luis Trenker (Urtij√´i 1894 ‚Äì Bolzano 1990), that presents objects of personal possessions, honorary deeds, medals for bravery, film prizes (e.g. Golden Globus, Filmband in Gold) publications and other material of the Luis Trenker central archive donated by the Trenker family to the museum in March 2004.

The operation was part of an international coalition aimed at enforcing a Libyan no-fly zone in accordance with the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 which stipulated that \\"all necessary measures\\" shall be taken to protect civilians. The coalition operation was designated by NATO as Operation Unified Protector, by the US as Operation Odyssey Dawn. The Canadian participation as Operation Mobile and the French participation as Op√©ration Harmattan. It was confirmed in December 2011 that the cost of the operations was ¬£212m ‚Äì less than was estimated, including ¬£67m for replacing spent munitions, is all expected to be met from the Treasury reserve. The no-fly zone was proposed during the Libyan Civil War to prevent government forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi from carrying out air attacks on anti-Gaddafi forces. Several countries prepared to take immediate military action at a conference in Paris on 19 March 2011. The randomly generated codename, \\"Ellamy,\\" is an alternative spelling of the Early Modern English word, Elami (E-la-mi), a musical solmisation designating the note E in the context of a tetrachord. The spelling \\"Ellamy\\" is found in a poem frequently attributed to John Skelton, \\"The Harmony of Birds\\".  Background to operation  The UN Security Council Resolution 1973 passed on the evening of 17 March 2011 gave a mandate to countries wishing to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya militarily. A conference involving international leaders took place in Paris on the afternoon of Saturday 19 March 2011. International military action commenced after the conference finished, with French military fighter jets being the first to participate in the operation only a few hours after the conference finished in Paris with the first shot fired at 1645 GMT against a Libyan tank.

From the start of Operation Ellamy up until 12 April, RAF aircraft had engaged over 100 main battle tanks, artillery pieces, armoured vehicles and SAMs. ;Day 31‚Äì18 April 2011 RAF Tornados and Typhoons attacked a pair of multiple rocket launcher vehicles and a light artillery piece reportedly firing on Misrata, as well as a self-propelled gun and tank. HMS Triumph was reported by the MoD to have launched two salvoes of Tomahawk missiles against command and control facilities, alongside precision strikes by RAF Tornados, Typhoons and coalition aircraft. HMS Liverpool intercepted the vessel heading for Tripoli, conducting a boarding party search with Royal Marines and finding trucks potentially of use to the Gaddafi regime. The merchant vessel was ordered to divert to Salerno in Italy. ;Day 32 ‚Äì 19 April 2011 The Foreign Secretary announced that a British Military Liaison Advisory Team would to be sent to Benghazi to advise the NTC on how to improve their military organisational structures, communications and logistics. ;Day 43 ‚Äì 30 April 2011 destroyed a buoyant mine containing over of high explosive. Using her sonar and underwater mine disposal system, Seafox, the mine was destroyed from the entrance to Misrata harbour, making the waters safe for aid ships to enter. ;Day 49 ‚Äì 6 May 2011 RAF Tornados attacked a site south of Sirte based on analysis of intelligence by RAF Tactical Imagery Wing. 20 FROG-7 launchers and a significant number of Scud canisters were reported as either completely or partially destroyed. RAF aircraft also destroyed one tank and two armoured vehicles in the area of Misrata and one mobile rocket launcher south of Tripoli. ;Day 55 ‚Äì 12 May 2011 An RAF Typhoon was reported to have destroyed two Palmaria 155 mm howitzers near Sirte. While engaged in surveillance operations off the coast of the rebel-held Libyan city of Misrata, HMS Liverpool came under fire from a shore battery, making her the first Royal Navy warship to be deliberately targeted since the Falklands War. HMS Liverpool had been tasked with other NATO warships, to intercept small, high- speed inflatable craft spotted approaching the port of Misrata, the type which had been used previously to lay mines in the entrance of the port. Libyan rocket artillery on the coast fired an inaccurate salvo of rockets at the ship. HMS Liverpool returned fire with her 4.5-inch main gun, silencing the shore battery, in the Royal Navy's first use of the weapon since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. ;Day 59 ‚Äì 16 May 2011 Royal Navy Tomahawk missiles reportedly fired from HMS Triumph, and Paveway IV bombs released by RAF Tornado aircraft were reported to have struck intelligence agency buildings and a training base used by Colonel Gaddafi's Executive Protection Force. RN and RAF attacks were reported to have damaged or destroyed over 300 targets since the start of Operation Ellamy. ;Day 62 ‚Äì 19/20 May 2011 RAF Tornado GR4s hit two s in Al Khums naval base and destroyed a facility in the dockyard constructing fast inflatable boats which Libyan forces had reportedly used to mine Misrata and attack vessels in the area. ;Day 63 ‚Äì 20 May 2011 RAF aircraft destroyed five multiple rockets launchers around Tripoli. ;Day 67 ‚Äì 24 May 2011 RAF aircraft attacked four armoured vehicles deployed near the Libyan city of Zlitan.

After initially ignoring the first shell, a further three were fired and the vessels were forced to return to their port of departure. ;Day 107 ‚Äì 3 August 2011 Several rockets were fired at HMS Liverpool. She returned fire with her 4.5-inch main gun. The attack came after the ship had fired a barrage of illumination rounds in support of an air attack on the stronghold of Zliten. ;Day 145 ‚Äì 10 August 2011 RAF Tornados launched direct from RAF Marham in Norfolk to target command and control and air defence targets with Stormshadow cruise missiles. ;Day 151 ‚Äì 16 August 2011 Since the start of military operations on 19 March, Royal Air Force, Royal Navy, and Army Air Corps precision strikes were reported to have damaged or destroyed some 870 former regime targets. HMS Liverpool was involved in the most intense shore-bombardment of the war. Liverpool had been tasked by a patrol aircraft to fire illumination rounds over the city of Zlitan. While conducting this mission, Liverpool came under fire from a Loyalist shore- battery. Liverpool responded by firing three rounds from her 4.5 inch gun, silencing the battery. Later on the same day, a patrol aircraft spotted a large pro-Gaddafi vehicle convoy carrying weapons and ammunition. Liverpool fired 54 shells from her 4.5-inch gun at the convoy, destroying or severely damaging many of the vehicles. During the ensuing chaos on the ground, NATO aircraft destroyed the remainder of the convoy.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building,. The church stands in Albury Park, to the northwest of Albury Hall, and between the villages of Albury and Shere. History The nave of the church may date from the Anglo-Saxon era but has been considerably altered from the 14th century onward. The tower, of which the lower parts contain pre- Conquest masonry, may stand on the site of an earlier chancel, but was extended outwards and upwards in the 12th century. During the following century the chancel and south transept were added. The south aisle was added in the 14th century, and the north porch in the early 16th century. In 1819 the Albury Park estate was bought by Henry Drummond, a London banker. During the following year the spire on the tower was replaced by a cupola (a small dome). Drummond became involved with the foundation of the Catholic Apostolic Church in the 1830s, and built a church for this religious movement on his estate. The residents of Albury village had been coming to worship at their parish church in the estate, and Drummond proposed to close this church and to build a new Anglican church nearer the centre of the village. Building of both the new churches began in 1839. Drummond then commissioned A. W. N. Pugin to convert the south transept of the old church into a mortuary chapel. Architecture =Exterior= The plan of the church consists of a nave and chancel separated by a centrally-placed tower. The nave has a south aisle and there is a south transept projecting from the tower. There is a north porch towards the west of the nave. The tower is in three stages with a battlemented parapet, and a small north window. In the chancel is an east window dating from the late 13th century, and a lancet window in the south wall. The transept has two two-light windows in its east wall, and a five-light south window. At the west end of the church are two gables, an arched window, and a round window. The porch is gabled and has a bargeboard pierced with quatrefoils, rosettes and tracery. The church is constructed in ironstone and sandstone rubble. The dressings are in Bargate stone and clunch. Part of the north wall is rendered, and the north porch is timber-framed. The nave is roofed with Horsham slabs, the aisle and porch with tiles, and the transept with slates. The cupola is shingled with wood, and has a metal finial. =Interior= Pugin window in the south aisle The nave is separated from the south aisle by a three-bay arcade carried on octagonal pillars. The timber nave roof dates from the 14th century. Around the walls are monuments dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. A 14th-century marble coffin slab is set into the floor of the aisle. In the west wall is a niche for a statue. Over the south door is a 15th-century wall painting of Saint Christopher. In the south wall of the aisle is a 14th-century piscina. The south transept (later the Drummond Chapel) contains Drummond's marble chest tomb. The walls of the chapel are painted in red and gold by T. Early, and the windows contain stained glass by William Wailes. The ceiling is panelled, and decorated in a quatrefoil pattern. William Oughtred, the mathematician who invented the multiplication sign, was buried in the church. He was rector of Albury for fifty years.ODNB External features In the churchyard is a chest tomb inscribed \\"Tupper Vault\\", that commemorates the artists Arthur Devis and Anthony Devis. The tomb is designated as a Grade II listed building.

It counts among the \\"most visible\\" in the field. A collaboration among the University of Maryland College of Arts and Humanities, Libraries, and Office of Information Technology, MITH cultivates innovative research agendas clustered around digital tools, text mining and visualization, and the creation and preservation of electronic literature, digital games, virtual worlds. History Made possible by a challenge grant in late 1998 by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), MITH began operations during the fall semester of 1999, under Martha Nell Smith, Professor of English at the University of Maryland. Smith left the directorship in 2005 and was replaced by Neil Fraistat, who assumed the role first in a one-year \\"acting\\" capacity and then, permanently, in 2006. Projects MITH is involved in several on- going projects, including the following: *BitCurator, is a joint effort led by the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (SILS) and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) to develop a system for collecting professionals that incorporates the functionality of many digital forensics tools. *Black Gotham Archive, links an interactive web site, smart phones, and the geographical spaces of Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn to create a deeper understanding of nineteenth-century black New York. The project is an extension of the book, Black Gotham: A Family History of African Americans in Nineteenth-Century New York City, written by Carla Peterson. The Archive incorporates various new media forms to enable greater flexibility, interactivity, and potential for reaching a broader audience.Black Gotham Archive *centerNet, is an international network of digital humanities centers formed for cooperative and collaborative action to benefit digital humanities and allied fields in general, and centers as humanities cyberinfrastructure in particular. It developed from a meeting hosted by the U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities and the University of Maryland, College Park, April 12‚Äì13, 2007 in Washington, D.C., and is a response to the American Council of Learned Societies report on Cyberinfrastructure for the Humanities and Social Sciences, published in 2006.CenterNet *Corpora Space, which allows scholars to work at the cutting edge of digital humanities and textual analysis research. It is a space in which they can discover, analyze and curate digital texts across the 450 years of print culture in English from 1473 until 1923, along with the texts from the Classical world upon which that print culture is based. *Digital Cultures and Creativity (DCC), provides an innovative curriculum and learning community that combines art, imagination, and global citizenship with new media and new technologies. Depending on individual interest, DCC students pursue activities as varied as digital music and video production, digital art, computer game design, creative electronic writing, virtual worlds, and developing online communities. *Digital Mishnah, a digital edition of the Mishnah, a Jewish legal treatise from roughly 200 CE. An artifact of great significance to cultural, religious, and social history, this text manifests itself in several forms dating roughly from the eleventh to the fifteenth century, including a significant 1492 printed edition. *Foreign Literatures in America (FLA), is a project devoted to the recovery and understanding of the significance of foreign authored literary works, as well as immigrant authored literary works, in the U.S. throughout U.S. history. *MITH‚Äôs Vintage Computers, is a website devoted to MITH‚Äôs sizable (and growing) collection of vintage computers, retro software, and other artifacts from the early era of personal computing. The centerpiece of the site is a considered metadata and modeling approach to computing hardware, whereby individual components of the vintage machines are documented, contextualized within their relation to the system as a whole, and expressed using Dublin Core. The site gathers links to other recent MITH projects in born-digital cultural heritage, and serves as a clearing house for our expanding portfolio in this area. It also includes newly written non- specialist‚Äôs documentation for the FC5025 Floppy Disk Controller, a device used to retrieve data off of obsolescent media formats. *Music Theatre Online, is a digital archive of texts, images, video, and audio files relating to musical theater. The best printed editions of musical theater texts cannot fully provide the experience of simultaneous expression of verbal, musical, and terpsichorean languages so necessary to fully understand the art form. Using the multimedia capabilities of the modern web browser, we created a better framework for studying these important works of drama.Music Theatre Online *Open Annotation Collaboration, The overarching goals of the Open Annotation Collaboration (OAC) are to facilitate to emergence of a Web and resource-centric interoperable annotation environment that allows leveraging annotations across the boundaries of annotation clients, annotation servers, and content collections, to demonstrate the utility of this environment, and to see widespread adoption of this environment. *Preserving Virtual Worlds I & II, a project that explores methods for preserving digital games, interactive fiction, and shared real time virtual spaces.Preserving Virtual Worlds *Project Bamboo, a partnership of ten research universities building shared infrastructure for humanities research. Within Bamboo, MITH is leading Corpora Space. We are designing research environments where scholars may discover, analyze and curate digital texts across the 450 years of print culture in English from 1473 until 1923, along with the texts from the Classical world upon which that print culture is based.Project Bamboo *Review, Revise, Requery, Using advanced computational methods, this project challenges longstanding critical assumptions about ekphrasis: that poets will ultimately comment on the stillness and muteness of the visual work of art; that ekphrastic speech turns upon the typically gendered axis of inter-arts rivalry; that descriptions of art and descriptions of nature in verse are indistinguishable in style and form. *The Shelley-Godwin Archive. MITH is creating the project‚Äôs infrastructure with the assistance of the New York Public Library‚Äôs digital humanities group, NYPL Labs. With the Archive‚Äôs creation, manuscripts and early editions of texts from Percy Bysshe Shelley and his Circle will be made freely available to the public through an innovative framework constituting a new model of best practice for research libraries.The Shelley-Godwin Archive Resources MITH is the host of the Deena Larsen Collection, a personal collection of early-era personal computers and software.Deena Larsen Collection Digital Dialogues MITH hosts the Digital Dialogues series, which invites prominent scholars from the digital humanities, new media, and information technology fields to give a presentation on their current research.

He was a right-handed batsman and bowled at a medium fast pace. Born in the town of Burnley, he made his first-class debut for Lancashire in August 1935 at the age of 22. Nutter spent 10 years with Lancashire, during which time he played 70 matches for the side. In June 1939, he achieved his highest ever first-class score of 109 not out in the County Championship match against Nottinghamshire. During the same summer he spent one match as the club professional at Accrington Cricket Club in the Lancashire League. During the early 1940s, while the County Championship was suspended due to the Second World War, Nutter played for many representative teams including the North of England, the West of England, a British Empire XI and the Royal Air Force. In 1945, he returned to the Lancashire League to play a season as the professional for Nelson Cricket Club, the club's first English professional for 24 years. Nutter joined Northamptonshire in the summer of 1948 and had his most successful season as a bowler, taking 105 wickets at an average of 22.88. He achieved career-best figures of 7‚Äì52 against Kent in July of that year. In April 1949, he played one match for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Essex.

Lighting efficiency improvements in the United States can be seen through different standards and acts. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 laid out changes in lighting legislation for the United States. This set up performance standards and the phase-out of incandescent light bulbs in order to require the use of more efficient fluorescent lighting. EISA 2007 is an effort to increase lighting efficiency by 25-30%. Opposition to EISA 2007 is demonstrated by the Better Use of Light Bulbs Act and the Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act. The efforts to increase lighting efficiency are also demonstrated by the Energy Star program and the increase efficiency goals by 2011 and 2013.  Incandescent light bulbs  incandescent lighting was the most common type used in homes, delivering about 85% of household illumination. To produce light, incandescent light bulbs convert electricity to heat, heating a filament to the point where it glows; a portion of the heat is thus converted to light. The conversion of heat to light requires a filament to be heated to high temperature, typically > 3000 K. Incandescent lamps have a low luminous efficacy, 10-22 lumens per watt, a short average operating life, 750‚Äì2500 hours, and a relatively low purchase cost. The three most common types of incandescent lamps are standard incandescent lamps, tungsten halogen lamps, and reflector lamps. Standard incandescent lamps have an efficacy of 10-17 lumens per watts and a lifetime of 750‚Äì2500 hours. Tungsten halogen lamps have an efficacy of 12-22 lumens per watts and a lifetime of 2000‚Äì4000 hours. Finally reflector lamps have an efficacy of 12-19 lumens per watts and a lifetime of 2000‚Äì3000 hours.  Compact fluorescent light bulbs  Fluorescent lighting converts ultraviolet light to visible light. In order to produce ultraviolet light, electrons flow through the fluorescent lamp and collide with mercury atoms. The collision with mercury causes photons of UV light to be released; the UV light is then converted to visible light as it passes through the phosphor coating in the glass tube. The conversion process for fluorescent lighting is more efficient than the incandescent process, resulting in 25% of the total energy consumed used to generate light (compared to 5% for incandescent light bulbs) and a 10,000 hour lifetime. The complete compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) includes the Edison screwbase and plastic housing, the electronic ballast, and the fluorescent lamp which is formed into a spiral shape. Improvements in technology have allowed fluorescent lamps with color temperature and color rendition comparable to incandescent lighting. Compact fluorescent lamps are available in a variety of styles and shapes. Some have tubes and ballasts permanently connected, while others are separate allowing you to change the tube without changing the ballast. There are also CFLs enclosed in a glass globe, which look similar to conventional incandescent light bulbs. CFLs fit most fixtures designed for incandescent lamps, although only some can be dimmed.  Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007  The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (Pub.L. 110-140) laid out the changes in legislation regarding lighting in the United States in Title III, Subtitle B. In this, the different bulbs being affected by the standards changes are first defined. Along with higher standards being created for bulbs, the ballasts are also required to increase efficiency. It is also outlined within EISA 2007 that there are lighting requirements within public buildings. The General Services Administration (GSA) set minimum energy efficiency standards for leased spaces, which includes energy efficient lighting fixtures and bulbs, including the use of Energy Star and Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) designated products. = Incandescent phase- out = EISA 2007 set new performance requirements for certain common light bulbs, requiring that these bulbs become approximately 25-30% more efficient than the light bulbs of 2008 by 2012-2014. Overall, the intent of this was to bring into the market more efficient light bulbs. Some new incandescent products could be introduced by the effective dates of the law, including a bulb by General Electric that will decrease the amount of energy required. Non-incandescent bulbs, such as compact fluorescent (CFL) and light emitting diodes (LED) already meet the Tier I standards introduced. Some companies worked to stop the sales of incandescent bulbs in anticipation of the standards changes. For example, the home decor and furniture company IKEA phased out the stock and sale of incandescent bulbs at their stores in the US and Canada, starting in August 2011. =Defunding of incandescent phaseout= In December 2011, the U.S. Congress defunded enforcement of EISA light-bulb performance requirements as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act in the 2012 federal budget.Stephen Dinan. \\"Congress Overturns Incandescent Light Bulb Ban\\". Washington Times. 16 December 2011. Retrieved 20 April 2012. However, a representative of the American lighting industry said that \\"the industry has moved on\\" and that American manufacturers have already retooled production lines to make other bulbs.Amy Bingham. \\"Congress Defunds Ban on Incandescent Light Bulbs but Doesn‚Äôt Quite Save Them\\". The Note at ABCNews.com. 16 December 2011. Retrieved 20 April 2012. =Rollback of energy efficiency standards for lightbulbs= In September 2019 the Trump administration rolled-back the EISA 2007 energy efficiency standards for lightbulbs with the Energy Department's Federal Register.  U.S. lighting standards  There are various codes and programs which attempt to characterize U.S. lighting standards. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Pub.L. 109-58) provided an energy-efficient commercial building tax reduction program for lighting systems that exceed code lighting. Based on estimates by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), lighting represents 40% of the electrical consumption in a commercial building, through the improvement of these systems the DOE believes this could be significantly decreased. The tax deduction includes a portion of installation costs. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) provides lighting standards in ASHRAE 90.1-2004. EPAct of 2005 set a deadline for states to adopt the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 standards. ASHRAE has recently published the 90.1-2010 with improved lighting standards, this includes: * Automatic shutoff control must be met for lighting alterations, including lamp and ballast retrofits when 10+% of connected lighting load is replaced * Automatic shutoff is no longer limited to buildings greater than 5,000sq.ft. * Occupancy sensors are now required * Parking garage lighting controls are now required * Hotel/motel lighting control has expanded * Stairwell lighting must now include a control device that reduces lighting power by 50% when unoccupied * All building landscape lighting must be turned off on a schedule or with photosensor * Advertising signage lighting must be reduced by 30% * Lighting control devices and systems must be functionally tested (this includes occupancy sensors, time switches, programmable schedule controls and photosensors) Advanced lighting control is an effort made by ASHRAE 90.1-2010 to significantly reduce the energy used for lighting by commercial buildings. The U.S. Department of Energy is improving residential codes by 30% by 2012, in an effort to move to net zero energy homes by 2020. The International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) embodies the goals of the DOE, increasing efficiency by 15% since its 2006 predecessor. The 2009 IECC requires that 50% of all permanent lamps be high efficacy lighting. The 2009 IECC, chapter 2 defines high efficacy lamps as compact fluorescent lamps, T-8 or smaller diameter linear fluorescent lamps, or lamps with a minimum efficacy of: * 60 lumens per watt for lamps > 40 watts, * 50 lumens per watt for lamps > 15 watts and ‚â§ 40 watts, and * 40 lumens per watt for lamps < 15 watts There are 14 states that have adopted the 2009 IECC, six have an effective date set for late 2010 early 2011. Within the next three years, approximately 33 states will have adopted and implemented IECC 2009 In September 2019 the Trump administration rolled back energy efficiency standards for lightbulbs with the Energy Department's Federal Register filing preventing the January 1, 2020 deadline. It has been argued that filament bulbs provide for a wide spectrum light and bulbs are much cheaper to purchase than CFLs and LEDs. However, they are more expensive than CFLs and LEDs over the life of the bulb due to higher running costs and shorter life.  Failed legislation  In response to the impending phase out of incandescent bulbs with increasing standards for light bulbs, there have been multiple bills proposed in opposition to the changes made in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. = Better Use of Light Bulbs Act = The Better Use of Light Bulbs Act (BULB Act), or H.R. 91 (introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives January 5, 2011) would have repealed provisions from EISA 2007 regarding lighting energy efficiency. There are eight provisions to be repealed by this bill, and include those that: prescribe energy efficiency standards for general service incandescent lamps, rough service lamps, and other designated lamps; direct the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to conduct and report to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on an annual assessment of the market for general service lamps and compact fluorescent lamps; direct the Secretary to carry out a proactive national program of consumer awareness, information, and education about lamp labels and energy-efficient lighting choices; prohibit a manufacturer, distributor, retailer, or private labeler from distributing in commerce specified adapters for incandescent lamps; authorize the Secretary to carry out a lighting technology research and development program; set forth minimum energy efficiency standards for incandescent reflector lamps; sets forth requirements for the use of energy efficient lighting fixtures and bulbs in public building construction, alteration, and acquisition, and; require metal-halide lamp fixtures and energy efficiency labeling for designated consumer electronic products to be included within the Energy Policy and Conservation Act's (EPCA) regulatory oversight. This bill was introduced by Rep. Joe Barton of Texas, with 54 co-sponsors. Upon being introduced, it was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and House Energy and Commerce Committee. Since, it has also been referred to the Subcommittee on Energy and Power and the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management. On July 12, 2011, H.R. 2417 failed to pass by the required two-thirds majority. = Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act = The Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act, or H.R. 849 (introduced 3/1/2011), also amends provisions from the EISA 2007, but is less restricting than H.R. 91. These provisions concern energy efficiency standards for general service incandescent lamps, rough service lamps, and other designated lamps, as well as incandescent reflector lamps. This bill requires that the Comptroller General present to Congress a report within six months of the Act's enactment. This report would need to include information that proves that: (1) consumers will obtain a net savings in terms of dollars spent on monthly electric bills and expenses for new light fixtures to accommodate the use of the light bulbs required by such provisions, compared to dollars spent before their enactment; (2) the phase-out of incandescent light bulbs required by such provisions will reduce overall carbon dioxide emissions by 20% in the United States by 2025; and (3) such phase-out will not pose any health risks, including risks associated with mercury containment in certain light bulbs, to consumers of the general public, including health risks with respect to hospitals, schools, day care centers, mental health facilities, and nursing homes. This report would also include monthly and yearly projections of expenses for electric bills and new light fixtures from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2017. Federal legislators, as well as state lawmakers in places like South Carolina, had proposed measures designed to circumvent or overturn the federal lighting performance standards. This bill was introduced on March 1, 2011 by Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, along with eight co-sponsors. Upon being introduced, it was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. On March 8, 2011, it was referred to the Subcommittee on Energy and Power, where it died. = H.R. 739 = H.R. 739 (introduced February 16, 2011) amends the EISA 2007 to prohibit any federal or state requirement to increase energy efficient lighting in certain buildings. Any hospital, school, day care center, mental health facility, or nursing home would not be required to install or utilize energy efficient lighting that contains mercury. This bill was introduced to the 112th Congress on February 16, 2011 by Rep. Michael C. Burgess of Texas. This bill was introduced to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and was referred to the Subcommittee on Energy and Power. It was also referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and was referred to the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit where it died. = South Carolina Incandescent Light Bulb Freedom Act = H. 3735 (Introduced in the South Carolina State House on February 23, 2011 and in the state Senate on April 13, 2011) is sponsored by state Reps. Bill Sandifer and Dwight Loftis. The bill states that if traditional incandescent light bulbs can be made and sold in South Carolina, they are not covered by federal law. The bill has been assigned to the Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce and Industry where it died. Energy Star Program The Energy Star program adheres to strict energy efficient guidelines which are set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The criteria was based on the lighting industry standards and test procedures. Light fixtures which have earned Energy Star combine quality design with the high energy efficiency. To qualify for an Energy Star rating light fixtures must: * Uses 1/4 the energy of traditional lighting * Reduced energy bills and bulb replacement. * Lifetime is at least 10,000 hours * Even light distribution Those selling Energy Star approved luminaries will be required to participate in quality assurance testing, which uses independent, third-party, qualified testing facilities. Third-party testing provides an active system to verify the quality of Energy Star qualified SSL Luminaire products. Qualified products are selected on a random basis as well as through a nomination process. The manufacturer of each selected luminaire will be required to commission third-party testing, each being tested for: total luminous flux, luminaire efficacy, correlated color temperature, color rendering index, steady state package/module/array temperature, and maximum power supply case. If a product fails quality assurance testing, the entire product grouping is de-listed, if two ore more variations of a product qualified under a product grouping fail, the applicant is place on a probationary list. The DOE reserves the right to terminate any partnership agreements with a manufacturer whose products repeatedly violate the ENERGY STAR specifications. The EPA announced updated standards for lighting fixtures to qualify for Energy Star labels. The next standards will be effective October 1, 2011, light fixtures will need to increase efficiency 30 percent about currently qualified fluorescent-based fixtures. In 2013, performance requirements will increase further, requiring 40 percent higher efficiency. The fixtures will continue to meet the strict performance; ensuring high quality light output as well as reduced toxins in fixture materials. A range of options will qualify under the new requirements, including fluorescent and LED lighting.

Among the factors contributing to the escalation of sexual violence against women, during the occupation of Poland, was a sense of impunity on the part of individual Soviet units left to fend for themselves by their military leaders. In search of food supplies and provisions ‚Äì wrote Dr Janusz Wr√≥bel of IPN ‚Äì the marauding soldiers formed gangs ready to open fire (as in Jƒôdrzej√≥w). Livestock was being herded away, fields cleared of grain without recompense and Polish homes looted. In a letter to his Voivode, a ≈Å√≥d≈∫ county starosta warned that plunder of goods from stores and farms was often accompanied by the rape of farmhands as in Zalesie, Olech√≥w, Feliksin and Huta Szklana, not to mention other crimes, including murder-rape in ≈Åagiewniki. The heavily armed marauders robbed cars, horse-drawn carriages, even trains. In his next letter to Polish authorities, the same starosta wrote that rape and plunder is causing the population to fear and hate the Soviet regime.Janusz Wr√≥bel,* \\"Wyzwoliciele czy okupanci? ≈ªo≈Çnierze sowieccy w ≈Å√≥dzkiem 1945‚Äì1946.\\" (PDF, 1.48 MB) Biuletyn Instytutu Pamiƒôci Narodowej 2002, nr 7.

Red Army Winter Offensive of 1945 Regions of occupied Poland upon the Soviet westward offensive Cases of mass rape occurred in major Polish cities taken by the Red Army. In Krak√≥w, Soviet entry into the city was accompanied by the wave of rapes of women and girls, and the widespread theft of personal property. According to Prof. Chwalba of Jagiellonian University, this behavior reached such a scale that the Polish communists installed in the city by the Soviet Union, composed a letter of protest to Joseph Stalin himself. At the Krak√≥w Main station, Poles who tried to rescue the victims of gang rape were shot at. Meanwhile, church masses were held in expectation of the Soviet withdrawal. Polish women in Silesia were the target of mass rape along with their German counterparts even after the Soviet front moved much further west. In the first six months of 1945, in Dƒôbska Ku≈∫nia 268 rapes were reported. In March 1945 near Racib√≥rz, 30 women captured at a linen factory were locked in a house in Makowo and raped over a period of time under the threat of death. The woman who gave her testimony to the police, was raped by four men. German and Polish women were apprehended on the streets of Katowice, Zabrze and Chorz√≥w and gang raped by drunken soldiers, usually outdoors. According to Naimark, the Red Army servicemen did not differentiate along the ethnic lines, or between victims and occupiers.Norman M. Naimark. The Russians in Germany: A History of the Soviet Zone of Occupation, 1945-1949. Harvard University Press, 1995. pp. 106-7. Polish and German women in Warmia and Masuria endured the same ordeal, wrote Ostrowska & Zaremba. One letter from the Recovered Territories claimed that in the city of Olsztyn/Allenstein in March 1945, practically no woman survived without being violated by the Soviet rapists \\"irrespective of their age\\". Their ages were estimated to range from 9 to 80. Sometimes, a grandmother, a mother and a granddaughter were among the victims. Women were gang raped by as many as several dozen soldiers. In a letter from Gda≈Ñsk/Danzig dated 17 April 1945, a Polish woman who acquired work around the Soviet garrison reported: \\"because we spoke Polish, we were in demand. However, most victims there were raped up to 15 times. I was raped seven times. It was horrible.\\" A letter from Gdynia, written a week later, said that the only resort for the women was to hide in the basements all day. Ostrowska, Zaremba: \\"Kobieca gehenna\\". Krytyka Polityczna, 4 March 2009. Source: Polityka nr 10/2009 (2695). The coming of spring There is evidence that a loophole in the Soviet directives might have contributed to even greater number of rapes committed on Polish women by the Red Army soldiers, according to Jerzy Kochanowski from the University of Warsaw. Professor Jerzy Kochanowski from the Institute of 20th Century History of the University of Warsaw, served as deputy Editor-in-chief of the historical journal M√≥wiƒÖ Wieki in 1994-1995. He specializes in Polish-German and Polish- Russian affairs. German women were protected (at least partially) by strict instructions about their treatment during transfer, issued by the Soviet command. However, there were no such instructions, or any instructions whatsoever about the Poles. In the County of Leszno some \\"war commanders\\" began to openly claim that their soldiers needed to have sex. At the same time, the farms given to Poles arriving from Kresy were robbed of anything of value by the Red Army, especially agricultural equipment left behind by the Germans. According to Ostrowska & Zaremba, the month of June 1945 was the worst. A 52-year-old victim of gang rape from Pi≈Ñcz√≥w testified that two Soviet war veterans returning from Berlin told her that they fought for Poland for three years and thus had the right to have all Polish females. In Olkusz twelve rapes were recorded in two days. In Ostr√≥w county, 33 rapes were recorded. The local Militia report stated that on June 25 near Krak√≥w a husband and child were shot dead before a woman was raped in one village, while in another, a 4-year-old girl was sexually assaulted by two Soviet males. According to statistics of the Polish Ministry of Health, there was a pandemic of sexually transmitted diseases across the country, affecting around 10% of the general population. In Masuria up to 50% of women were infected. According to historian Wies≈Çaw Niesiobƒôdzki, in East Prussia (Prusy Wschodnie) many ethnic German women, alarmed by the Nazis, fled ahead of the Soviet offensive, leaving the Polish women to endure rapes and witness the systematic burning of ransacked houses, for example in the town of I≈Çawa in late January 1945 under the Soviet Major Konstantinov. Eye witness Gertruda Buczkowska spoke of a labor camp near Wielka ≈ªu≈Çawa employing two hundred ethnic Belarusian women. In late January 1945 Buczkowska saw their bodies in the snow while fleeing with her mother and five German women of Hamburg who had joined them. The five Germans were found naked and dead in a basement of a house on Rybak√≥w street in I≈Çawa a few days later.Wies≈Çaw Niesiobƒôdzki, Jak to z tym ‚Äûwyzwalaniem‚Äù by≈Ço (What sort of \\"liberation\\" was it).

He is the author of 12 books of history and the society, published between 1984‚Äì2008, including the Historical Guide to I≈Çawa (Przewodnik Historyczny I≈Çawy) released for the 690th anniversary of the city. Return from forced labour According to Ostrowska and Zaremba, Polish women taken to Germany for slave labour were raped on a large scale by Soviet soldiers as well as former prisoners of war. In May 1945, at the conference of delegates of various repatriation offices, the final resolution stated: \\"through Stargard and Szczecin/Stettin, there is a mass movement of Polish people returning from forced labour in the Third Reich. They are the subject of constant attacks by individual soldiers as well as organized groups. Along the journey, Poles are frequently robbed, and Polish women raped. In our response to the question posed to the Polish delegation of whether the rapes of Polish women could be regarded as exceptional, management of the local repatriation office declared, on the basis of permanent contact with the returning Poles, that women are the target of violent aggression as a matter of course, not the opposite\\". Russian historian Ia. S. Drabkin suggested in a 1989 interview that it was \\"not the soldiers who caused most of the problems with rape in the occupation administration, but former Soviet POWs and Soviet citizens working for SVAG, who often wore uniforms\\" which looked the same.Per interview with Ia.S. Drabkin, Moscow, July 1989. (In) See quotation in Google Books. Ia. S. Drabkin was a political officer in the Information Department of SVAG following the defeat of Nazism. In 1947-1948 Drabkin wrote for Sovetskoe slovo (Soviet Word), the Russian-language paper of the Soviet occupation zone. Drabkin, a Russian historian specializing in Germany, is the author of \\"'Hitler‚Äôs War' or 'Stalin‚Äôs War'?\\" published in the Journal of Russian and East European Psychology, Vol. 40, No. 5. (2002). Sometimes, even the presence of militia could not provide adequate protection, since the militiamen were frequently disarmed. For the women, moving trains and the train stations were especially dangerous, as in Bydgoszcz or around Radom and Legnica/Liegnitz. The grave situation in Pomerania was described in a report by one agent of the Delegatura RzƒÖdu na Kraj, quoted by Ostrowska & Zaremba. In some counties there were virtual \\"orgies of rape\\". The commandant of Polish militia headquarters in Trzebiat√≥w issued a warning to all Polish women not to walk outside without escort. \\"With nearly two million Russian deserters and former POWs at large in Soviet-occupied Europe, it is no wonder that banditry on their part became a serious problem for the occupation,\\" wrote Naimark.Norman M. Naimark. The Russians in Germany: A History of the Soviet Zone of Occupation, 1945-1949. Harvard University Press, 1995. pp. 74-75. The number of Polish victims of rape in 1944‚Äì1947 would be hard to estimate accurately. The biggest difficulty in estimating their number comes from the fact that the ethnic makeup of the victims was not always stated in Polish official reports. Generally speaking, the attitude of Soviet servicemen toward women of Slavic background was better than toward those who spoke German. According to Ostrowska & Zaremba, whether the number of purely Polish victims could have reached or even exceeded 100,000 remains a matter of guesswork.

For individual consumers, smart grid technology offers more control over electricity consumption. Typically, the goal is greater overall energy efficiency (for example, programming home appliances to run at specific times when electrical demand is lowest). The reliability and efficiency of the electrical grid can be enhanced by implementing smart grid technologies. However, this will require modifications to the current electrical system, and advances towards smart grid adoption in the United States have been slow. Key federal legislation driving the development of smart grid-related technology for the American electrical system includes Title XIII of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). Further smart grid regulations will help to further drive the adoption of smart grid technology in the United States.

Smart Grid on a broad scale, refers to an advanced distribution system, which accommodates for the ‚Äúflow of information from a customer‚Äôs meter in two directions: both inside the house to thermostats, appliances, and other devices, and from the house back to the utility‚Äù. Smart Grid is designed to support operational and energy measures such as smart meters and appliances, renewable energy resources, as well as energy efficiency resources. The Department of Energy (DoE) is required by Section 1304 of the act to conduct Smart Grid research, development, and demonstration. In addition, the National Institute of Standards and Technology is to establish protocols and standards for Smart Grid equipment and systems. Smart Grid technology is subsidized by the creation of a program within the DoE that ‚Äúreimburses 20% of qualifying Smart Grid investments‚Äù. On a state level, utilities providers are encouraged to employ Smart Grid technology and to recover Smart Grid investments through rates. Section 1301: Statement of policy on modernization of electricity grid The most comprehensive discussion of Smart Grid technology and its potential implementation in the United States is outlined in Title XIII of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. This portion of the legislation states the policy position of the United States government to ‚Äúsupport the modernization of the Nation‚Äôs electricity transmission and distribution system to maintain a reliable and secure electricity infrastructure that can meet future demand growth...‚Äù as well as to achieve several characteristic aspects of the Smart Grid. These aspects include smart metering, the use of digital controls to improve the efficiency, reliability, and security of the grid, deployment of smart technologies, and other key developments that would enhance the U.S. electric grid. Section 1302: Smart grid system report According to Title XIII Section 1302, reports are to be made to Congress one year after enactment and every two years subsequently to give ‚Äúthe status of smart grid deployments nationwide as well as any regulatory or government barriers to continued deployment‚Äù. The Smart Grid Task Force established in section 1303 will assist with this, and provide the current status and prospects of the smart grid including ‚Äúinformation on technology penetration, communications network capabilities, costs, and obstacles‚Äù. This task force can make recommendations for State and Federal policies or actions to ease in the transition to a smart grid. Section 1303. Smart grid advisory committee and smart grid task force Title XIII Sec. 1303(a-b) provides for the creation of a Smart Grid Task Force and Advisory Committee. The purpose of the Smart Grid task force is to undertake research and development about the smart grid, developing relevant standards and protocols, defining the relationship between smart grid technologies and practices and current electric utility regulation, as well as researching the development of smart grid infrastructure. The task force is intended to collaborate with the Smart Grid Advisory Committee, whose purpose is to advise policymakers on the development of smart grid technologies and the progress of the country in adopting and transitioning to these technologies. Section 1302 of Title XIII calls for a biyearly Smart Grid system report to be generated by the Secretary of Energy and the Smart Grid Task Force with contributions from the Smart Grid Advisory Committee to brief Congress on the status of smart grid deployments throughout the country as well as ‚Äúany regulatory or government barriers to continued deployment‚Äù. The report is to address the current status and outlook of the development and implementation of the smart grid. Section 1304. Smart grid technology research, development and demonstration Sec. 1304(a) also calls for the implementation of a program to develop power grid digital information technology, such as developing sophisticated techniques for determining peak load reductions and energy-efficiency savings from smart metering and other smart grid components. Other responsibilities of this program include creating algorithms to use in electric transmission system software applications and to investigate potential access by electric utilities to the electricity stored in alternative vehicles to meet peak demand loads. A smart grid regional demonstration initiative was also established by EISA Title XIII Sec. 1304(b) that is composed of demonstration projects aimed towards advanced technologies in the power grid. The goals of the ‚ÄòInitiative‚Äô include demonstrating the potential benefits of investing in advanced grids and facilitating in the transition from the current grid system to the smart grid. These and other goals are to be carried out in the form of demonstrations in different electricity control areas. Section 1305. Smart grid interoperability framework A Smart Grid Interoperability Framework is mandated by Section 1305(a-e) of Title XIII whose purpose is to develop protocols and standards for the management of information so that smart grid devices and systems can interoperate within the existing electrical grid. The overarching goal of this framework is to ‚Äúalign policy, business, and technology approaches in a manner that would enable all electric resources, including demand-side resources, to contribute to an efficient, reliable electricity network‚Äù. Section 1306. Federal matching fund for smart grid investment costs Sec. 1306(a) provides for a federal matching fund for smart grid investment costs in which 20% of qualifying smart grid investments will be reimbursed by the grant program. Qualifying investments that are provided for in section 1306(b) include certain household appliances, specialized electricity-using equipment like motors and drivers, metering devices and transmission and distribution equipment. The computer software that enables devices to engage in Smart Grid functions is also considered qualifying investments, as well as hybrid vehicles. Section 1307. State consideration for smart grid Section 1307 provides that electric utilities in individual states should consider and report to the state on investing in a qualified smart grid system based on a variety of economic, social, and technological factors. These factors listed in Sec. 1307(a)(16)(A)include the total costs and cost-effectiveness, \\"improved reliability, security, system performance, and societal benefit\\". State electric utilities are also permitted in Sec. 1307(a)(16)(B)to recover any capital, operating expenditure, or other costs of the electric utility relating to the deployment of the smart grid, from ratepayers. Electricity purchasers are likewise entitled to direct access to information from their electricity provider on the smart grid such as prices, usage, intervals and projections, and sources from which their power was generated. Purchasers are also allowed to access their power information through the internet or other means as granted through Sec. 1307(a)(17)(B). Section 1308. Study of the effect of private wire laws on development Studies on both the effect of private wire laws on the development of combined heat and power facilities as well as on security attributes of smart grid systems are also provided for in this piece of the legislation. A study of the laws and regulations affecting the siting of privately owned electric distribution wires on and across public rights-of-way is to be conducted according to Sec. 1308(a)(1). The required evaluation must address the purposes of the laws and the ‚Äúeffect the laws have on the development of combined heat and power facilities‚Äù. The study must also determine whether a change in the laws would have any major impacts on electric utilities and the customers of the utilities. Lastly, it must assess whether privately owned electric distribution wires would result in ‚Äúduplicative facilities‚Äù and whether these are necessary or desirable. Section 1309. DoE study of security attributes of smart grid systems This section requires that a report be submitted to Congress that ‚Äúprovides a quantitative assessment and determination of the existing and potential impacts of the deployment of Smart Grid systems on improving the security of the Nation‚Äôs electricity infrastructure and operating capability‚Äù according to Sec. 1309(a). The report should address how Smart Grid improves or disrupts the security of the nation's electrical grid, reliability, stability during emergencies, and potential risks of the system. Development Barriers There are many technological barriers to achieving a smart grid. One of the largest is the deployment of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) technology. These devices receive market data and adjust household consumption accordingly. The ability to measure bidirectional flow of power and offer dynamic pricing by AMI technology is essential to the successfulness of the deployment of other technologies such as distributed generation, demand response measures, or automated distribution schemes.Abel, A. (2007). Smart grid provisions in H.R. 6, 110th Congress (Order Code RL34288). Washington, DC: Congressional Research Office. https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL34288.pdf Additionally, the aging distribution system raises questions as to whether it will be able to reliably handle smart technology and distributed distribution. Investments will need to be made in distribution infrastructure and management practices to handle the increase in smart technology deployment. Consumer products such as washers, driers, and water heaters need to be designed or retrofitted to handle dynamic communication of market signals from AMI devices. Finally, the widespread sharing of data and control of personal devices presents large legal, privacy, and security risks that must be addressed.Pernick, R. & Wilder, C. (2007). The clean tech revolution: The next big growth and investment opportunity. New York, NY: HarperCollins Future Regulation and Policy Since the federal government has stated the goal of promoting smart grid-technology, future legislation and incentives will address technical implementation and budgetary barriers. The Department of Energy (DoE), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are the primary government agencies developing smart grid policy. The DoE is working towards the development of smart grids through investment grants, demonstration pilot programs, and research and development.Effectively transforming our electric delivery system to a smart grid: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment of the House Committee on Science and Technology. 111th Cong., 1st Sess. (2009). http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg50954/pdf/CHRG-111hhrg50954.pdf In addition, they are responsible for monitoring the progress of smart grid deployment and must submit a biannual report to Congress. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has the authority to regulate the wholesale distribution of electricity. FERC is collaborating with the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop the hundreds of standards necessary to regulate smart grid technology. The development of regulations and standards for the wide range of technology involved is essential to remove legal barriers and facilitate the development of technological solutions. =Department of Energy= In 2009, the DoE elected 9 pilot projects to demonstrate different smart grid technologies under the Distributed Systems Integration Program. Each program is expected to reduce peak loads by 15%. Projects are located in Hawaii, California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Illinois, West Virginia, and New York. The technologies being tested for each project vary widely based on the resources available in the region. For example, in Las Vegas, Nevada where residential energy demand is high due to the desert climate, the ‚ÄúHybrid‚Äù Home project by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas aims to reduce residential peak load demand by developing photovoltaics and energy storage with advanced meters for automated demand response. In Illinois on the other hand, the Never-Failing Perfect Power Prototype by the Illinois Institute of Technology aims to integrate advanced meters, power controller systems, and demand response controllers to create a more robust distribution grid that reduces peak loads and reduces the risk of blackouts. These pilot projects are important research opportunities both to develop the new technology and to point out policy and regulation concerns that must be addressed.Department of Energy. (2009). Enhancing the smart grid: Integrating clean distributed and renewable generation. Washington, DC: Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability. In addition to funding research and pilot programs, the DoE is tasked with monitoring the development of smart grids and reporting to Congress every two years. In their first report in 2009, the DoE set forth 20 metrics by which current smart grids deployment was rated and can be measured. The report found that policy and regulatory progress was at a low level of maturity but was increasing at a moderate trend. The report also stated that policy and regulation should be emphasized to enable the development of new smart grid products, services, and markets.Department of Energy. (2009) Smart grid system report. =Federal Energy Regulatory Commission= FERC's primary responsibilities and jurisdiction require it to establish rates and terms and conditions for wholesale interstate transmission and sale of electricity. Under EISA it is given the authority to develop standards but has not been mandated to or given the authority to make standards mandatory. Their efforts, therefore, have been to collect information and concerns from stakeholders such as the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and assist the NIST in developing standards relevant to FERC's jurisdiction. FERC identified two major policy issues to address, system security and inter-system communication. In addition, it identified wide-area situational awareness, demand response, electric storage, electric vehicles, advanced metering, and distribution system automation as six areas of functionality that must be given priority.Testimony of Mason W. Emnett, Associate Director, Office of Energy Policy and Innovation, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Before the Technology and Innovation Subcommittee Of the Committee on Science and Technology United States House of Representatives. 111th Cong. (2010). http://www.ferc.gov/EventCalendar/Files/20100701105022-Emnett- Testimony-07-01-10.pdf =National Institute of Standards and Technology= In January 2010, the NIST published the Framework and Roadmap for Smart Grid Interoperability Standards, Release 1.0. The publication identified 75 standards ranging from telecommunications, internet, and power industry topics that are applicable to smart grids. In addition, it identified 16 priority areas that are essential to addressing policy and regulatory gaps. The NIST also formed the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel of 22 stakeholders to continually provide input on the regulations being developed. This panel will play a major role in the second release of the standards, on which work began in October 2010. In a future phase fully consistent with NIST‚Äôs core mission and its charge under 2007 EISA, the integrated testbed will also serve as an on-going permanent resource to the electric power industrial sector for smart grid standards validation and development of advanced smart grid measurements suggested by the evolution of the grid. The testbed will implement network communication by way of a home microgrid protocol and the Building Automation and Controls Network (BACnet) data protocol. The testbed will involve approximately 15 NIST personnel already working on related topics with the Smart Grid and Cyber-Physical Systems Program Office, and involved in Smart Grid Interoperability Panel 2.0, Inc. activities =States= At the state level, several states have created legislation to facilitate the development of smart grids. California Senate Bill 17 requires the California Public Utility Commission (California PUC) to create a smart grid deployment plan by July 1, 2001, and electrical corporations must submit a smart grid deployment plan to the California PUC by June 1, 2011. The bill required that standards be adopted for California that complied with standards from NIST, the Gridwise Architecture Council, the International Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the North America Electric Reliability Cooperation, and FERC. If utilities fail to meet the standards or present a plan to meet them by the June 1 deadline, they will be vulnerable to millions of dollars in penalties. In Illinois, utilities must reduce peak load by 0.1% every year for 10 years according to the Illinois Power Agency Act, Senate Bill 1592. While this does not specifically require the development of smart grids, it has resulted in several state utilities investing in smart grids including the deployment of several hundred thousand smart meters. A similar policy has been enacted in Maryland. According to the EmPOWER Maryland Energy Efficiency Act of 2008, Senate Bill 205, utilities must reduce peak demand by 15% by 2015. The law tasks the Maryland Public Service Commission with determining the effectiveness of smart grid technology and gives it the authority to mandate the deployment of smart grid technology by utilities. In Colorado, the city of Boulder is acting as a case study on smart grid technology. A major concern of the state legislature is the security of information being transmitted over the grid, the findings in Boulder will play a significant role in the development of policy for the rest of the state.Flick, T. & Morehouse, J (2011).

It was Ohio's largest interurban, connecting Toledo, Lima, Dayton, Columbus, and Cincinnati. At its peak it operated of track. Never financially healthy, the company went bankrupt in 1921 and was dissolved into its constituent companies. History The Ohio Electric Railway was formed on May 16, 1907. The organizers of the new company were Randal Morgan, W. Kesley Schoepf, and Hugh J. McGowan. Beginning in September 1907 and continuing into 1908 the new company acquired or leased the fourteen other companies which would comprise its system: * Cincinnati, Dayton and Toledo Traction * Columbus and Lake Michigan Railroad * Columbus, Buckeye Lake and Newark Traction * Columbus, Grove City and South Western Railway * Columbus, London and Springfield Railway * Dayton and Muncie Traction * Dayton and Western Traction * Dayton, Springfield and Urbana Electric Railway * Fort Wayne, Van Wert and Lima Traction * Indiana Columbus and Eastern Traction * Lima and Toledo Traction * Lima Electric Railway and Light * Springfield and Western Railway * Urbana, Bellefontaine and Northern Railway The Ohio Electric proved to be financially unsound. It paid no dividends during its corporate existence and lost $1.5 million as a result of the Great Dayton Flood in 1913. In 1918 it spun off its Cincinnati‚ÄìDayton line to the Cincinnati and Dayton Traction company. This trend continued in 1920 when spun off the Dayton and Western Traction in its entirety.

Destroyed in World War II, it was re-created in cast metal by Albert Mazzotti Jr in 1953. The statue now stands in a small square in the Old Quarter of M√ºnster. In 1987 American sculptor Jeff Koons created a replica of the design in polished cast stainless steel. 1896 statue The original statue, like its successors, depicted a kiepenkerl (literally \\"pannier guy\\": a travelling merchant or pedlar [US: peddler] with a carrying basket, whistle, knot stick and linen smock. It was carved from Baumberger sandstone by August Schmiemann and was inaugurated in M√ºnster on 16 October 1896. The statue was destroyed by a US tank in World War II. 1953 statue Albert Mazzotti Jr's 1953 re-creation of the 1896 Kiepenkerl statue by August Schmiemann that was destroyed in World War II A competition for a new statue was held immediately after the war ended. However, the new designs were vetoed by the mayor of M√ºnster, Karl Zuhorn (de). Subsequently, Albert Mazzotti Jr was commissioned to create a statue in bronze. It was inaugurated on 20 September 1953 by Federal President Theodor Heuss. Its location is Kiepenkerl Square, in the Old Quarter of M√ºnster (). 1987 statue The 1987 replica of the Kiepenkerl statue by Jeff Koons For the 1987 Sculpture Projects M√ºnster, American sculptor Jeff Koons created a replica of the statue in polished cast stainless steel.

Actually he is a \\"K√∂tter\\" (a tenant farmer). The statue, created by > an academic sculptor, became especially popular when, during the war, > everything was burnt down, only the statue remained standing and then was > blasted by a tank crew. The will to survive during the hoarding times: as > early as 1953, the city of M√ºnster still in ruins, Theodor Heuss inaugurated > a new life-size Kiepenkerl monument in bronze. Bronze is art. That is the > only art in this restoration monument. Jeff Koons now has recast it in > stainless steel which he calls the \\"material of the masses\\" (a highly > complicated procedure: as the form does not correspond to any industrial > standard, the various parts had to be smelted at 1800 degrees Centigrade and > cast one by one and then welded together) and finally gave it a high mirror > polish to create a \\"false front of luxury\\".
