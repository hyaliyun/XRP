His fame rests largely on his masterwork Chronicles of the City of Perugia 1492-1503 which has become a primary source for many later historians of the Italian Renaissance and in particular the city of Perugia. Life Although the exact date of his birth in unknown, it is believed that Matarazzo was born about the year 1443 in the small town of Deruta, near Perugia. Little is known of his family, but he is said to have been of noble descent, which would have guaranteed him an extensive education. As a teenager he was chosen to compose the Latin inscriptions that were inscribed beneath the portraits of famous citizens of Perugia that Braccio Baglione had painted to decorate his palace in the city. In 1464 he was teaching in the University of Ferrara and three years later he was assistant to the celebrated humanist teacher Ognibene da Lonigo at Vicenza. In 1472, he traveled to Greece and settled in Rhodes to study the Greek language. Writing to a friend he reported, \\"I already speak the language with such fluency that you might think I had been born and brought up in Greece.\\" After wide-ranging travels in the Mediterrean, he settled in Perugia circa 1475 where we find him designated as reverendi domini Perusinae civitatis secretarius dignissimus. The next seventeen years of his life were spent in his native city. On 7 March 1485, in celebration of the feast of St. Thomas Aquinas at the Basilica of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome, Matarazzo delivered the annual encomium in honor of the \\"angelic doctor\\" to the members of the Dominican studium generale, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum.http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/francesco- maturanzio_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ Accessed 15 May 2013; Reprinted in G. Zappacosta, Il Gymnasium perugino e altri studi sull‚Äôumanesimo umbro (con testi inediti e rari), ed. V. Licitra, Rome 1984, pp. 112-125; cf. 16-36, 97-214. In 1486 he was appointed Professor of Rhetoric in the University of Perugia. In 1492 he succeeded Ognibene as Professor of the Humanities at Vicenza where he spent four or five years. The magistrates of Perugia ordered his return to the city under penalties and upon his return Matarazzo, contrary to his own expectations, was given a warm reception. \\"Men do me honour; as I pass through the streets I am saluted; I am loved by the Baglioni, and by all other citizens besides.\\" The following year he was appointed Professor in the University of Perugia at a salary of 110 ducats, guaranteed by the taxes of two villages which were assigned to him. The rest of his life was spent in Perugia in an honourable position, in which, according to the usage of the time, political and literary employment were assigned to him in turns. He was frequently charged with the composition of funeral orations over distinguished citizens. In 1503 he became the State Chancellor; he went as ambassador to Rome and Florence and to other States, and continued in active service of the State till 1513. Concerning his death we have the chronicle of his friend Teseo Alfani, which reads: \\"On this Friday morning, August 20, 1518, before dawn, died the most excellent Francesco Matarazzo, who had been down with fever for about a month. All the city was sore at heart, for the man had great qualities, and stood indeed above all others, not only in our city, but almost in the whole of Italy. May God have pardoned his sins. He was about seventy- five years old.\\" Chronicles of the City of Perugia 1492-1503 At the time this chronicle was written, the city of Perugia was one of the many Renaissance centers of political strife, moral outrage and ruthless violence. The book relates the story of two rival families, the Oddi and the Baglioni, who are locked in a deadly struggle for possession of the city. In 1492 the victorious Baglioni are the reigning overlords of the Republic. The Oddi family and its attendant army live in exile in the valley between Perugia and Assisi where they conduct a long and oppressive guerrilla war against their rivals; and in the process devastate the Umbrian land and impoverish the common citizen. Considering that Matarazzo wrote under the patronage of the Baglione, many critics regard the author as biased in his selection and presentation of historical material.\\"What is the value of a source like Matarazzo's chronicles? Was he not a partisan himself, bent upon building up a heroic reputation for the Baglione...?\\" Heller, p. 40. Several sheets of the manuscript have been lost and the story begins and ends abruptly.

It was derived from the Khitan script, which in turn was derived from Chinese (Han characters). The script has only been decoded to a small extent. The Jurchen script is part of the Chinese family of scripts. History A medallion with the Jurchen translation of the Chinese couplet, M√≠ngw√°ng sh√®n d√©, s√¨ y√≠ xi√°n bƒ´n (\\"ÊòéÁéãÊÖéÂæ∑.ÂõõÂ§∑Âí∏Ë≥ì\\": \\"When a wise king is heedful of virtue, foreigners from all quarters come as guests\\"). The image was preserved in a Ming Dynasty catalog of molds for making ink cakes. After the Jurchen rebelled against the Khitan Liao Dynasty and established the new Jin dynasty in 1115, they were using the Khitan script.Kane (1989), p. 3. In 1119 or 1120,The date of the creation of the script (1119 or 1120) varies in different sources. Franke (1994) says that \\"[t]he Jurchens developed ... [the large script] ... in 1119\\". Kane (1989) (p. 3) quotes the Jin Shi, which states that \\"[i]n the eighth month of the third year of the tianfu period (1120), the composition of the new script was finished\\". The two dates can be reconciled as one may imagine that the work started in 1119 and was completed in August‚ÄìSeptember (the eighth month of the Chinese calendar) of 1120. Wanyan Xiyin, the \\"chancellor\\" of the early Jin Empire, acting on the orders of the first emperor, Wanyan Aguda, invented the first Jurchen script, known as \\"the large script\\".Franke (1994), pp. 31‚Äì34. The second version, the so-called \\"small script\\", was promulgated in 1138 by the Xizong Emperor, and said to have been created by the emperor himself. According to the Jin Shi, in 1145 the small script characters were used officially the first time. There is no historical information about any original books that were written in Jurchen,Jing-shen Tao, \\"The Jurchen in Twelfth-Century China\\". University of Washington Press, 1976, . Chapter 6. \\"The Jurchen Movement for Revival\\", Page 81. but during the reign of Emperor Shizong of Jin (1161‚Äì1189) a large number of Chinese books were translated into Jurchen.Tao (1976), pp 76‚Äì77. The translation program started in 1164; among the translations were Confucian and Taoist classics, histories, and exam study guides. However, not even a single fragment of any of the books survived. Most of the samples of the Jurchen writing available to modern researchers are epigraphic ones (those on monuments etc.), as well as a few short inscriptions on seals, mirrors, ceramics, graffiti, etc. A total of nine epigraphic inscriptions are known so far.Kane (1989), p. 42 The best known (and traditionally thought to be earliest of them) is the Jurchen inscription on the back of \\"the Jin Victory Memorial Stele\\" (Â§ßÈáëÂæóÂãùÈôÄÈ†åÁ¢ë, D√† Jƒ´n d√©sh√®ngtu√≥ s√≤ngbƒìi), which was erected in 1185, during the reign of Emperor Shizong, in memory of Wanyan Aguda's victory over the Liao. It is apparently an abbreviated translation of the Chinese text on the front of the stele.Hoyt Cleveland Tillman, Stephen H. West, China Under Jurchen Rule: Essays on Chin Intellectual and Cultural History. Published by SUNY Press, 1995. . Partial text on Google Books. Pp 228‚Äì229 However, the undated inscription from Qingyuan (Ky≈èngw≈èn) in northern Korea is now thought to be older, surmised to have been created between 1138 and 1153.Kane (1989), p. 59 The only inscription dating from after the end of the Jin dynasty is the one on the stele erected in 1413 by the Ming eunuch admiral Yishiha on the Tyr Cliff, on the lower Amur River.Kane (1989), p. 63 No paper or silk manuscripts in Jurchen were knownKane (1989), p. 75‚Äì76. until 1968, when a Jurchen manuscript was discovered by E.I. Kychanov among the Tangut papers in the Leningrad branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies (now the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences). It is written on two sheets of paper and dates to 1217. Writing in 1990, Herbert Franke (perhaps, not aware of N√ºzhen zishu, below) describes the Leningrad document as \\"unique\\" and not yet deciphered. Even more importantly, in 1979 Chinese scholars Liu Zuichang and Zhu Jieyuan reported the ground-breaking discovery of an eleven- page document in the Jurchen script in the base of a stele in Xi'an's Stele Forest museum. This manuscript, containing 237 lines of Jurchen script (around 2300 characters), is thought to be a copy of N√ºzhen zishu (Â•≥ÁúüÂ≠óÊõ∏, \\"Jurchen Character Book\\"), written by Wanyan Xiyin himself soon after his invention of the large-character script. According to its discoverers, this manuscript was a type of textbook, a list of large-script characters, each one usually representing a complete word. This is different from the epigraphic inscriptions, which also contain phonetic symbols.Kane (1989), pp. 8‚Äì9. The Jurchen script was apparently fairly widely known among Jurchens, which is attested by numerous graffiti (unfortunately, mostly illegible) left by Jurchen visitors in Bai Ta Pagoda in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia.Kane (1989), p. 77. Jurchen script must have become much less known after the destruction of the Jin dynasty by the Mongols, but it was not completely forgotten, because it is attested at least twice during the Ming Dynasty: on Yishiha's Tyr stele of 1413 and in a Chinese‚ÄìJurchen dictionary included in the multilingual \\"Chinese‚ÄìBarbarian Dictionary\\" (ËèØÂ§∑Ë≠ØË™û) compiled by the Ming Bureau of Translators (ÂõõÂ§∑È§®).Kane (1989), pp. 90‚Äì91. During the Yuan and Ming dynasty the Jurchen language continued to be spoken in Manchuria, where it later developed into the Manchu language. The latter, however, was written first in Mongolian script (1601),Kane (1989), p. 99. and later in a new Manchu script derived from the Mongolian script (1632), neither of which has any relation to the Jurchen script. The last Jurchen inscription is dated to 1526. Structure of the script Jurchen script was based on the Khitan script, inspired in turn by Chinese characters. Apparently, both semantic and phonetic borrowing took place. Many Jurchen characters can be described as copies, or distorted copies, of Chinese and/or large-script Khitan characters with similar meaning; others apparently were derived from Chinese characters whose sound was similar to that of Jurchen words, without semantic connection.Kane (1989) pp. 21‚Äì24 There seem to be few Jurchen characters whose shapes can be related to the Khitan small-character script; however, the idea of using phonetic symbols for grammatical endings, for phonetics transcription of Chinese loanwords, or for writing words for which there were no special ideograms, may have been inspired by the Khitan small-character script. The Jurchen characters can be divided into two classes, according to their role: * Ideographic characters, used to record either: ** a whole word (one to three, but usually two, syllables long), or ** the first one or two syllables of a word, to be followed by one or several phonetic symbols. * Phonetic characters, usually recording a CV syllable, a Vn ending, or single vowel.Kane (1989) pp. 25‚Äì28 However, the boundary between the classes was not precise, as some ideographic characters were also used for their phonetic value as parts of other words. Comparing Wanyan Xiyin's N√ºzhen zishu with later inscriptions and Ming Dynasty dictionaries, one can detect the direction of the writing system's development from ideographic to combined ideographic-phonetic. Many words originally written with a single character were later written with two or even three, the character originally designating the entire word being later used only for its beginning, and a phonetic character (or two) being used for the last one or two syllable(s),Kane (1989) pp. 28‚Äì30 However, because Chinese is an isolating language and the Jurchen and Khitan languages are agglutinative, the script proved to be cumbersome. Study of the script Jurchen inscription dated 1196, on a rock in Mongolia Da Jin huang di dutong jingl√ºe langjun xingji (Â§ßÈáëÁöáÂºüÈÉΩÁµ±Á∂ìÁï•ÈÉéÂêõË°åË®ò) Due to the scarcity of the surviving samples of Jurchen writing, it was often difficult to determine for the 19th-century (or sometimes even 20th-century) scholars, whether a given inscription was in the \\"large\\" or \\"small\\" Jurchen script, or whether it was in Jurchen script at all. Thus, it was commonly thought in the 19th century by the Chinese and Western researchers that the Da Jin huang di dotong jingl√ºe langjun xingji (Â§ßÈáëÁöáÂºüÈÉΩÁªüÁªèÁï•ÈÉéÂêõË°åËÆ∞) inscription represented the Jurchen large script until, in 1922, the Belgian missionary L. Ker discovered the Liao Imperial Tombs in Qingling, where this very script was used, in parallel with Chinese text, for the epitaph of Emperor Xingzong of Liao and Empress Renyi. Thus the Khitan script was discovered, and the Jin dynasty's Da Jin huangdi dotong jingl√ºe langjun xingji inscription, long thought to be written in Jurchen script, turned out to be written in the (still undeciphered) Khitan script and, most likely, Khitan language, after all.Kane (1989), pp. 4‚Äì6Kane (1989) refers to the Khitan stele that originally was thought to be in Jurchen both as Da Jin huangdi dotong jingl√ºe langjun xingji (pp. 2, 13, 14) as Da Jin huangdi jingl√ºe langjun xingji (pp. 4, 5, 6, 10); apparently, he is talking about the same monument, and the latter name is simply a shorter form of the former The pioneering work on studies of the Jurchen script was done by Wilhelm Grube in the end of the 19th century.Herbert Franke, \\"The forest people of Manchuria: Khitans and Jurchens\\". A chapter in: Denis Sinor, \\"The Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia\\". Published by Cambridge University Press, 1990. . Partial text on Google Books. Page 422. Jurchen small script According to the History of the Jin Dynasty there were two different Jurchen scripts: a \\"large script\\" that was devised in 1120 by command of Wanyan Aguda, the first emperor of the Jin dynasty; and a \\"small script\\" that was created in 1138 by the Emperor Xizong (r. 1135‚Äì1150), but which was first officially used in 1145.Kiyose (1977), p. 22 However, all the extant examples of Jurchen writing, including the Sino-Jurchen Vocabulary of the Bureau of Interpreters (N«özhƒìn Y√¨y«î Â•≥ÁúüË≠ØË™û) and various monumental inscriptions, are written in basically the same script, which is similar in form to the Khitan large script. Various theories have been suggested to account for the apparent lack of a Jurchen small script in the extant corpus of monumental inscriptions and manuscript texts. Daniel Kane has suggested that the large and small Jurchen scripts are points on a single script continuum: the large script was the earliest form of the Jurchen script, as represented in the manuscript Jurchen Character Book (N«özhƒìn Z√¨sh≈´ Â•≥ÁúüÂ≠óÊõ∏) that was discovered in Xi'an in 1979; and the small script was the later form of the Jurchen script, as represented on the Monument recording the names of successful candidates for the degree of jinshi (N√ºzhen jinshi timing bei Â•≥ÁúüÈÄ≤Â£´È°åÂêçÁ¢ë) and in the Sino-Jurchen Vocabulary. The earlier and later forms of the script use basically the same set of characters, but whereas the characters in the Jurchen Character Book are largely logographic is nature, many of the characters in the Sino-Jurchen Vocabulary and monumental inscriptions have developed a phonetic function, and can thus be used to express grammatical endings. Kane considers the \\"large script\\" to refer to characters used as logograms, and the \\"small script\\" to refer to character used as phonograms.Kane (1989), p. 10 On the other hand, Aisin-Gioro Ulhicun believes that there were actually two separate Jurchen scripts, a \\"large\\" logographic script modelled on the Khitan large script, and a \\"small\\" phonographic script modelled on the Khitan small script. During the 1970s a number of gold and silver paiza with the same inscription, apparently in the small Khitan script, were unearthed in northern China. Aisin-Gioro has analysed the inscription on these paiza, and although the structure of the characters is identical to the Khitan small script she concludes that the script is not actually the Khitan small script but is in fact the otherwise unattested Jurchen small script. She argues that this small script was only used briefly during the last five years of the reign of its creator, Emperor Xizong, and when he was murdered in a coup d'√©tat the small script fell out of use as it was less convenient to use than the earlier large script.

He previously played in MLB for the San Francisco Giants and Boston Red Sox. He stands tall, and weighs . Nicknamed \\"Kung Fu Panda\\", Sandoval is a two-time All-Star and won three World Series championships with the Giants. He hit three home runs in Game 1 of the 2012 World Series, becoming the fourth player to hit three home runs in a World Series game, leading to his being named that year's World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP). During the offseason, Sandoval plays for the Navegantes del Magallanes of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League (VPBL). In 2002, Sandoval was signed by the San Francisco Giants. Sandoval worked his way through the minor leagues and debuted with the Giants in 2008, batting .345 in 41 games. Capable of playing first base, third base, and catcher, he became the Giants' starting third baseman in 2009, ceasing to catch that year and playing first base only occasionally. In 2009, Sandoval finished second in All-Star Final Vote balloting, batting .330 with 25 HRs and 90 runs batted in (RBIs) in his first full season in the majors. However, Sandoval struggled in 2010 and was benched during the playoffs for the 2010 World Series, which the Giants won. He lost weight before 2011 and hit .315 with 23 home runs in 117 games. Injuries limited Sandoval to 108 games in 2012, but he was selected to his second- straight All-Star Game. Then, in Game 1 of the 2012 World Series, Sandoval joined Babe Ruth, Reggie Jackson, and Albert Pujols as the only players to hit three home runs in a World Series Game. For his contributions, Sandoval was named the World Series Most Valuable Player, as the Giants swept the Detroit Tigers. In 2013, he appeared in 141 games, batting .278, with 14 home runs, and 79 RBIs. A free agent after the 2014 season, Sandoval signed a five-year contract with the Red Sox that offseason. Due to poor performance, the Red Sox released him in 2017. Sandoval then re-signed with the Giants, but the Red Sox remained responsible for paying his salary through the end of the 2019 season.  Early life  Sandoval was born to Pablo Sr. and Amelia Sandoval in Puerto Cabello, Carabobo, Venezuela. He grew up an avid baseball fan, following the careers of Omar Vizquel and Andr√©s Galarraga. He practiced baseball in an empty two-car garage with his older brother, Michael. His favorite players were Omar Vizquel (later his teammate on the Giants) and Andr√©s Galarraga. He was born left-handed, but wanted to be able to play shortstop like Vizquel. Thus, at nine, he taught himself to throw right-handed as well. He can still throw with both hands, but throws right-handed during games.  Professional career   Minor leagues  Sandoval received notice from scouts in 2002, when he went to the Dominican Republic for a scouting tournament. A scout for the Texas Rangers told Sandoval he would come to Venezuela to sign him, but he did not show up. After two weeks, Ciro Villalobos, a scout for the San Francisco Giants, offered Sandoval a contract, and he signed. Sandoval began his professional career as a catcher in 2004 with the rookie AZL Giants, hitting .266 with no home runs and 26 runs batted in (RBI) in 177 at bats. In 2005, he was used almost entirely as a third baseman while playing for the Single-A short season Salem-Keizer Volcanoes. He hit .330 (second in the Northwest League to Mike Mooney's .342) with three home runs and 50 RBIs (one behind Luis Valbuena's total). His batting average slumped in 2006 to .265. He had one home run and 49 RBIs with the Single-A Augusta GreenJackets of the South Atlantic League that year, splitting time between first and third base. In 2007, he played for the Single-A advanced San Jose Giants, hitting .287 with 11 homers and 52 RBIs. That season, he was used as a catcher and first baseman, and he helped San Jose win the California League championship. In 2008, he spent time with two minor league teams, San Jose and the Double-A Connecticut Defenders of the Eastern League, before being called up to the majors. In 273 at bats for San Jose, he hit .359 with 12 home runs and 59 RBIs. In 175 at bats with Connecticut, he hit .337 with eight home runs and 37 RBIs. In total, he hit .350 with 20 home runs and 96 RBIs in 2008.  San Francisco Giants (2008‚Äì2014)  = 2008 = Sandoval catching for the San Francisco Giants. Sandoval was called up to the Majors on August 13, 2008. He debuted the next day, going 0-for-3 in a 7‚Äì4 loss to the Houston Astros. In his first Major League Baseball (MLB) plate appearance, he hit an RBI sacrifice fly. He got his first hit against Mike Hampton in the second inning of his next game, August 16, on his way to going 3-for-5 in an 11‚Äì5 loss to the Atlanta Braves. In 41 games in 2008, he hit .345 with three home runs and 24 RBI, striking out 14 times and grounding into six double plays in 154 at- bats. He hit his first MLB home run on August 27 off Liv√°n Hern√°ndez in a 4‚Äì1 triumph over the Colorado Rockies. On defense, Sandoval was used at first base, at third base, and at catcher. Teammate Barry Zito gave Sandoval the nickname \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" (after the then-recent movie); in a Zito win on September 19, the rotund Sandoval scored a run against the Los Angeles Dodgers by acrobatically jumping over the tag of catcher Danny Ardoin. = 2009 = Sandoval made the Giants' Opening Day roster out of spring training in 2009 as the Giants' starting third baseman and backup catcher. He served as a personal catcher for Zito at the beginning of the year. On May 12, Sandoval hit his first walk-off home run against Joe Beimel to beat the Washington Nationals 9‚Äì7. Following an elbow injury to Sandoval in May, the Giants called up Eli Whiteside to serve as the backup catcher on May 24; since then, Sandoval has not been used at all as a catcher. After 73 games played, San Francisco Chronicle columnist Scott Ostler wrote that Sandoval had made the most impressive transition from the Giants farm system since 1986 when Will Clark and Robby Thompson were rookies. Sandoval's first days in the majors were marked by a tendency to free swing. Giants hitting coach Carney Lansford noted that Sandoval contributed to the team's drawing the fewest walks in the National League at a time when the overall number of walks throughout baseball had increased. \\"As much as I try to get him to be disciplined, it's like caging a lion. He leaves the dugout ready to swing the bat. I literally tell him before every at-bat, 'Swing at a strike.'\\" Sandoval himself characterized his approach as \\"See ball, swing.\\" In July 2009, he was named a Sprint Final Vote candidate for the 80th annual All-Star Game for the final roster spot on the National League team. He was edged by Shane Victorino of the Philadelphia Phillies on the last day of voting. On July 6, Sandoval hit his first career grand slam at home at AT&T; Park against Sean West of the visiting Florida Marlins in a 5‚Äì4 victory. He hit his first home run into McCovey Cove on July 30, the 50th anniversary of the MLB Debut of Willie McCovey, who was in attendance. Sandoval said after the game, \\"It's special right now. I hit McCovey Cove and McCovey's here. He talks to me every time he's in the clubhouse.\\" Sandoval set a record for most hits by a Giants switch-hitter in a single season with 189 in 2009. Sandoval finished the 2009 season with 25 home runs and 90 RBI in 153 games. He had the second-highest batting average among NL hitters, at .330 (behind Hanley Ram√≠rez's .342), and finished seventh in NL MVP voting. Due to his service time in 2008, he was ineligible for the NL Rookie of the Year Award, which went to Chris Coghlan. = 2010 = During the offseason, the Giants had Sandoval work on losing weight. Sandoval, however, saw a sophomore slump in 2010. He struggled all season to come close to his 2009 totals and saw himself dropped to eighth in the batting order in a game on June 5. One bright spot in the season came on August 12, when Pat Burrell and Sandoval hit back-to-back home runs against Randy Wells of the Cubs in an 8‚Äì7 victory. Sandoval's home run snapped a 46-game home run drought. Sandoval finished the season with a .268 batting average, 13 home runs, and 63 RBI. He saw his batting average, as a right-handed hitter, plummet over 150 points from his 2009 batting average; he dropped from .379 to .227. His batting average with runners in scoring position also dropped during this period, from .301 in 2009 to .208 in 2010. Overweight and unproductive, he was benched during the 2010 National League Championship Series for Juan Uribe and limited to three at-bats in the 2010 World Series. However, Sandoval earned his first World Series ring as the Giants won their first World Series since 1954, securing the championship in five games over the Texas Rangers. = 2011 = Sandoval tagging Anderson Hern√°ndez at third base. Entering 2011, the Giants made a publicized campaign called \\"Operation Panda\\", which was aimed at getting Sandoval into better shape during the offseason. By the end of 2010, he had weighed . Sandoval hired Triple Threat Performance of Tempe, Arizona, to help him lose weight and help improve his performance. He lost over , and it led to results on the field for Sandoval. After a subpar 2010 season, Sandoval returned to his 2009 form. He got off to a good start in 2011, but suffered a broken right hamate bone in late April and missed 41 games. He was activated off the disabled list (DL) on June 14 and had a 22-game hitting streak from June 19 through July 14. On July 10, 2011, Sandoval was selected to the National League All-Star team, becoming the first All-Star position player for the Giants since Barry Bonds in 2007. In his first All-Star at bat, Sandoval hit an RBI ground-rule double against Brandon League, helping the NL win the 2011 MLB All-Star Game. On September 15, 2011, Sandoval hit for the cycle at Colorado against pitcher Jhoulys Chac√≠n. He had (in order) a two-run HR in the first, single in the second, double in the fifth and a triple in the sixth. On September 19, 2011, Sandoval earned his first career \\"NL Player of the Week\\" Award. In 2011, Sandoval hit .315/.357/.552 with 23 home runs and 70 RBIs, a significant improvement from 2010. He only had 426 at bats for the season, down significantly from his totals from 2009 and 2010 due to the injury he suffered. = 2012 = On April 26, 2012, Sandoval hit a single in the fourth inning of a game against the Cincinnati Reds at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati. This was the 19th consecutive game since Opening Day in which Sandoval had a hit, setting a Giants franchise record for longest consecutive hitting streak to begin a season. The previous record ‚Äì of 18 games ‚Äì was set by Johnny Rucker in 1945. Sandoval ran it up to 20 before it was snapped. However, in May, Sandoval fractured his left hamate bone, an injury which kept him out until early June. Giants' head athletic trainer Dave Groeschner said the day before Sandoval had surgery, \\"I guess the good news is both [hamate bones] will be gone tomorrow and he can't do it again.\\" On July 1, 2012, it was announced that Sandoval had beaten out David Wright for his second All-Star team, as the starting third baseman for the National League. The choice was considered somewhat controversial by fans and executives (particularly Sandy Alderson), as David Wright had a significantly higher batting average than Sandoval at the time. Wright made the team as a reserve, and as a reporter pointed out, Sandoval in 2009 \\"outperformed Wright, who was the fans' choice to start.\\" On July 10, at Kansas City's Kauffman Stadium, Sandoval highlighted the NL's five-run opening inning with the first bases-loaded triple in the history of the Midsummer Classic, off of reigning American League (AL) Cy Young Award winner Justin Verlander.

In 108 games (396 at bats), Sandoval batted .283 with 112 hits, 12 home runs, and 63 RBI. On October 24, 2012, in Game 1 of the 2012 World Series, Sandoval hit three home runs ‚Äî two of them off Justin Verlander. He joined Babe Ruth, Reggie Jackson, and Albert Pujols as the only players in MLB history to hit three home runs in a World Series game, and is the first in history to hit those home runs in his first three plate appearances (in the first, third, and fifth innings). On October 28, Sandoval was named the World Series MVP. He also won the Babe Ruth Award for his overall postseason performance. Sandoval set a new Giants franchise record for most hits in a postseason with 24, which included six home runs. = 2013 = With the Giants trailing 1‚Äì0 in the ninth inning on April 30, 2013, Sandoval hit a two-run home run against J. J. Putz to give them a 2‚Äì1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. At the end of April, he had 35 hits, tied for the NL lead with Starling Marte and, since 1900, the largest April total by a Giant. On May 21, at AT&T; Park and fighting the flu, he hit a 10th-inning, two-run home run against Yunesky Maya to give the Giants a 4‚Äì2 victory over Washington. From June 9 through June 23, he was on the DL with a left foot injury. On August 16, he had four hits and reached safely in all six plate appearances during a 14‚Äì10 victory over the Miami Marlins. He hit three home runs on September 4 in a 13‚Äì5 victory over the Padres. With that performance, Sandoval joined Ruth, Jackson, Pujols, George Brett, and Adri√°n Beltr√© as the only players to have three-homer games in both the regular season and the playoffs. In 141 games, Sandoval batted .278 with 146 hits, 14 home runs, and 79 RBI. = 2014 = By the end of 2013, Sandoval again needed to lose weight. Encouraged by several of his teammates and Giants' general manager Brian Sabean, he showed up at spring training several pounds lighter. The weight loss did not lead to immediate results for Sandoval, who batted .167 with just six RBI in his first 31 games through May 6. However, over his next 42 games through June 21, he batted .351 with seven home runs and 27 RBI. In the 2014 NLDS, with a game-tying, RBI double in the top of the ninth inning against the Washington Nationals, Sandoval extended his National League postseason hitting record to 13 consecutive games. In Game 3 of the 2014 World Series, his post-season on-base streak ended at 25. In Game 4, while ailing with the flu, his 13th multi-hit post-season game brought him to second in that category in franchise history, behind Frankie Frisch. In Kansas City, in Game 7 of the World Series, Sandoval recorded his 26th hit of the postseason, setting a new record and caught Royals batter Salvador P√©rez's pop-up foul ball for the final out to clinch the World Series championship for the San Francisco Giants. It was the Giants' third World Championship in a span of five seasons. Sandoval became a free agent after the season ended.  Boston Red Sox (2015‚Äì2017) = 2015 = Sandoval with the Red Sox On November 24, 2014, Sandoval came to an agreement with the Boston Red Sox on a five- year, $90 million contract with a sixth year club option of $17 million or a $5 million buy-out. The deal was officially announced on November 25. Sandoval said, \\"It was a tough decision for me. It took me a long time to be sure that I was going to make the right decision... But I want a new challenge. I made that choice to be here in Boston because I need a new challenge.\\" In 126 games of 2015, Sandoval batted .245 with 10 home runs and 47 RBI, all career lows since his first full season in 2009. He swung at 47.8% of pitches outside the strike zone (the highest percentage in the majors). = 2016 = Jeff Passan of Yahoo! Sports reported in January 2016 that Sandoval had switched agents and was now represented by Rick Thurman and Rafa Nieves of Beverly Hills Sports Council. Looking to improve upon his first season in Boston, an overweight Sandoval struggled in spring training, and was replaced by Travis Shaw as the starting third baseman. On April 13, Sandoval was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a shoulder strain. On May 3, Sandoval underwent surgery on his left shoulder, sidelining him for the remainder of the season. On September 24, manager John Farrell told reporters that Sandoval was progressing ahead of schedule in his rehab, and could be an option for the Red Sox in the postseason should a need arise, as the team did acquire Aaron Hill during the season to help with third base depth. Sandoval also made an effort at improving his fitness, losing 15 pounds by August while working at the Red Sox facility in Fort Myers. Due to the injury Sandoval ended his 2016 season with six at bats. = 2017 = Heading into the 2017 season, Sandoval battled in spring training to become the third baseman, competing against Josh Rutledge and a few others.

With the 2017 Giants, Sandoval appeared in 47 games, batting .225 with five home runs and 20 RBIs; defensively, he made 38 appearances at third base and nine appearances at first base. = 2018 = The Giants picked up Sandoval's option, worth the league minimum, for 2018. He had a strong spring training, hitting four home runs as part of a .302/.333/.585 slash line. He made the opening day roster out of spring training as a bench player, likely as a backup to newly acquired third baseman Evan Longoria. On April 28, Sandoval debuted as a pitcher in a 15‚Äì6 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. He pitched a perfect ninth inning, inducing three groundouts with mostly curveballs averaging around 70 mph. In 92 games for the Giants, he hit .248/.310/.417 with 9 home runs and 40 RBIs. = 2019 = Sandoval appeared in more than 100 games for the Giants in 2019, playing at 3rd and 1st bases, and pitching in one game.

It includes a subrange of the Inyo Mountains called the Chocolate Mountains, a northwestern section of the Last Chance Range and the upper end of Eureka Valley which is immediately north of Death Valley National Park. The highest peaks of the wilderness are in the Chocolate Mountains and include Mount Nunn (7,815 feet) and Lime Hill (6,532 feet). The wilderness's namesake Piper Mountain (labeled 'Chocolate Mountain' on topo maps) rises to an elevation of .  Topography  The vehicle corridors that break the continuity of the Piper Wilderness Area into three parts were a concession made when the area was added to the California Desert Protection Act. * The western section is the largest of the three and includes the east side, the steep west side and the crest of the Chocolate Mountains subrange. * The central section is separated from the western portion by a road linking State Route 168 to Death Valley Road. A colorful and deeply dissected bahada rising to a subrange of the Last Chance Mountains characterize the central section. * The third and smallest section of the wilderness is separated from the central portion by Loretto Mine Road and Horse Thief Canyon and is a continuation of the Last Chance subrange with its border being the Eureka Valley Road and Death Valley National Park. Flora and fauna Piper Mountain Wilderness Desert vegetation include xeric shrublands of Creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) in the lower valleys. Plants in the higher elevations include: Shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia), Littleleaf Horsebrush (Tetradymia axillaris), Stansbury cliffrose (Purshia stansburiana), Desert-olive (Forestiera pubescens) and Mormon tea (Ephedra californica) on . North-facing high elevation slopes are studded with Single- leaf Pinyon (Pinus monophylla) and California juniper (Juniperus californica). Within the wilderness grows one of the northernmost stands of Joshua Tree (Yucca brevifolia), at the base of the Inyo Mountains. Rare wildflowers include black milkvetch or Funeral Mountain milkvetch (Astragalus funereus), and the cactus Redspined fishhook cactus or Mojave fish hook cactus (Sclerocactus polyancistrus), which grows in Joshua tree \\"woodland\\" communities. There are three areas within the wilderness that are habitat for the Desert Bighorn Sheep. Recreation Recreational opportunities are day- hiking and backpacking with solitude almost guaranteed as the wilderness is very lightly used. The Bureau of Land Management oversees the Piper Wilderness and does not require any permits for visitors. Because the Piper Mountain Wilderness Area received federal protection so recently, the of trail are actually closed four-wheel drive roads.  Water and recreation  Water is the single most limiting factor when exploring this desert wilderness. Caching water is possible in many locations because of the road corridors through the area. The majority of visitors are students from Deep Springs College in Deep Springs Valley, located between highway 168 and the western edge of the wilderness.

He served on the Western Front in World War I where he was mortally wounded. Education and legal career He was born in 1882, the eldest son of John Barnes, 1st Baron Gorell. After an education at Winchester, Trinity College, Oxford (MA 1908), and Harvard, he was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple in 1906. He worked as a secretary to his father when he was on the Bench, and later as secretary of the Royal Commission on Divorce. He succeeded his father in the peerage in 1913. He was a very active English Freemason, and a member of Oxford's Apollo University Lodge.Burke's Peerage: 'Gorell'.Obituary, Annual Register for 1917, p. 155. Military career and death Gorell was a pre-war officer in the part-time Territorial Force, having been commissioned as a Second lieutenant in the 18th County of London Battery, 7th County of London Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, on 2 September 1909.London Gazette, 5 October 1909. He was promoted to Captain on 19 April 1912, and on the outbreak of World War I he was acting commander of 19th County of London Battery detached at Shepherd's Bush.Monthly Army List, August 1914. He went with his battery to the Western Front where he commanded it as a Temporary Major. When the infantry of 47th (1/2nd London) Division succeeded in capturing High Wood on the Somme after bitter fighting on 15 September 1916, the first gun battery to come up in support across the deeply- cratered ground was Gorell's. He later made a dangerous reconnaissance of the whole divisional front. For these actions he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order.DSO citation, London Gazette 14 November 1916.Maude, pp. 65‚Äì6; Appendix G. On 15 January 1917, while serving in the Ypres Salient, Gorell was returning from observing for his battery in the front line when he was mortally wounded by an enemy shell in a communication trench. 'A pre-war Territorial officer of high professional attainments, and at times almost reckless courage, his loss was universally mourned'.Maude, p. 87. He died the next day, having served one year and ten month's continuous service abroad. He is buried at Lijssenthoek Military Cemetery near Poperinge, West Flanders, Belgium.CWGC entry.

In interface design, natural-language interfaces are sought after for their speed and ease of use, but most suffer the challenges to understanding wide varieties of ambiguous input.Hill, I. (1983). \\"Natural language versus computer language.\\" In M. Sime and M. Coombs (Eds.) Designing for Human-Computer Communication. Academic Press. Natural-language interfaces are an active area of study in the field of natural-language processing and computational linguistics. An intuitive general natural-language interface is one of the active goals of the Semantic Web. Text interfaces are \\"natural\\" to varying degrees. Many formal (un-natural) programming languages incorporate idioms of natural human language. Likewise, a traditional keyword search engine could be described as a \\"shallow\\" natural-language user interface. Overview A natural-language search engine would in theory find targeted answers to user questions (as opposed to keyword search). For example, when confronted with a question of the form 'which U.S. state has the highest income tax?', conventional search engines ignore the question and instead search on the keywords 'state', 'income' and 'tax'. Natural-language search, on the other hand, attempts to use natural-language processing to understand the nature of the question and then to search and return a subset of the web that contains the answer to the question. If it works, results would have a higher relevance than results from a keyword search engine. History Prototype Nl interfaces had already appeared in the late sixties and early seventies.Natural Language Interfaces to Databases ‚Äì An Introduction, I. Androutsopoulos, G.D. Ritchie, P. Thanisch, Department of Artificial Intelligence, University of Edinburgh *SHRDLU, a natural-language interface that manipulates blocks in a virtual \\"blocks world\\" *Lunar, a natural-language interface to a database containing chemical analyses of Apollo-11 moon rocks by William A. Woods. *Chat-80 transformed English questions into Prolog expressions, which were evaluated against the Prolog database. The code of Chat-80 was circulated widely, and formed the basis of several other experimental Nl interfaces. An online demo is available on the LPA website. *ELIZA, written at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966, mimicked a psychotherapist and was operated by processing users' responses to scripts.

On the part of the user, this has led to unrealistic expectations of the capabilities of the system. Such expectations will make it difficult to learn the restrictions of the system if users attribute too much capability to it, and will ultimately lead to disappointment when the system fails to perform as expected as was the case in the AI winter of the 1970s and 80s. A 1995 paper titled 'Natural Language Interfaces to Databases ‚Äì An Introduction', describes some challenges: ;Modifier attachment :The request \\"List all employees in the company with a driving licence\\" is ambiguous unless you know that companies can't have driving licences. ;Conjunction and disjunction :\\"List all applicants who live in California and Arizona\\" is ambiguous unless you know that a person can't live in two places at once. ;Anaphora resolution :resolve what a user means by 'he', 'she' or 'it', in a self-referential query. Other goals to consider more generally are the speed and efficiency of the interface, in all algorithms these two points are the main point that will determine if some methods are better than others and therefore have greater success in the market. In addition, localisation across multiple language sites requires extra consideration - this is based on differing sentence structure and language syntax variations between most languages. Finally, regarding the methods used, the main problem to be solved is creating a general algorithm that can recognize the entire spectrum of different voices, while disregarding nationality, gender or age. The significant differences between the extracted features - even from speakers who says the same word or phrase - must be successfully overcome. Uses and applications The natural-language interface gives rise to technology used for many different applications. Some of the main uses are: * Dictation, is the most common use for automated speech recognition (ASR) systems today. This includes medical transcriptions, legal and business dictation, and general word processing. In some cases special vocabularies are used to increase the accuracy of the system. * Command and control, ASR systems that are designed to perform functions and actions on the system are defined as command and control systems. Utterances like \\"Open Netscape\\" and \\"Start a new xterm\\" will do just that. * Telephony, some PBX/Voice Mail systems allow callers to speak commands instead of pressing buttons to send specific tones. * Wearables, because inputs are limited for wearable devices, speaking is a natural possibility. * Medical, disabilities, many people have difficulty typing due to physical limitations such as repetitive strain injuries (RSI), muscular dystrophy, and many others. For example, people with difficulty hearing could use a system connected to their telephone to convert a caller's speech to text. * Embedded applications, some new cellular phones include C&C; speech recognition that allow utterances such as \\"call home\\". This may be a major factor in the future of automatic speech recognition and Linux. * Software development: An integrated development environment can embed natural-language interfaces to help developers. Below are named and defined some of the applications that use natural-language recognition, and so have integrated utilities listed above. Ubiquity Ubiquity, an add-on for Mozilla Firefox, is a collection of quick and easy natural-language-derived commands that act as mashups of web services, thus allowing users to get information and relate it to current and other webpages. Wolfram Alpha Wolfram Alpha is an online service that answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from structured data, rather than providing a list of documents or web pages that might contain the answer as a search engine would. It was announced in March 2009 by Stephen Wolfram, and was released to the public on May 15, 2009. Siri Siri is an intelligent personal assistant application integrated with operating system iOS. The application uses natural language processing to answer questions and make recommendations. Siri's marketing claims include that it adapts to a user's individual preferences over time and personalizes results, and performs tasks such as making dinner reservations while trying to catch a cab.

After extensive service in Europe, North America and the east Indies, York was decommissioned in 1765 and broken up at Plymouth in 17712. Naval career York was commissioned in February 1755 under Captain Hugh Pigot, in the months before the outbreak of the Seven Years' War. She was immediately assigned to the British fleet at sea under Admiral Edward Hawke. On 10 April 1757 she captured two French vessels, Le Henri and Le Rubis,which were revealed to be sailing under letters of marque to hunt British merchant ships. Further victories followed, with the defeat of French privateers Le Mars, La Cybelle, Les Deux Amis and Le Dromadaire, all in June 1757. In January 1758 Captain Pigot received orders to sail for North America to add York to the fleet assembling to support British advances against French Canadian strongholds. York was thereafter present at the failed Siege of Louisburg. This was Pigot's final engagement as Yorks captain; in early 1759 he was promoted to command of the 84-gun Royal William in the fleet of Sir Charles Saunders. Pigot was replaced by Captain Vincent Pearce, who took York to the East Indies to support British efforts against the French. Captain Pearce died in December and was replaced by Captain Richard Hughes. In February 1761 command transferred from Hughes to Captain Henry Cowell. War with France concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in February 1763. York remained in the East Indies, but was ordered to be returned to England after Cowell's death in April 1765. She reached Plymouth in July 1765, where she was paid off and her crew discharged to other vessels. She remained tied up at Plymouth for the next five years. A marine survey was conducted in April 1771, but no repairs were made. York was finally broken up at Plymouth in June 1772.

Also known as the Cameron Rifles or the Second German Rifle Regiment, the men were mostly German immigrants. Organized in July 1861, three months after the outbreak of war, the 68th saw service in the Eastern and Western theaters. As a part of the Army of the Potomac, it was initially assigned to the defenses of Washington, D.C. Later, the 68th was transferred to the Shenandoah Valley and fought at the Battle of Cross Keys. The men of the 68th were then reassigned to central Virginia and found themselves in the thick of the fighting at Second Bull Run. After returning to the nation's capital, the regiment fought in Chancellorsville and was routed by Confederate forces. At Gettysburg, they saw battle on two of the three days and took heavy losses. The regiment was then transferred to the west and participated in the Chattanooga Campaign. The 68th fought in the battles of Wauhatchie and Missionary Ridge, assisting in the Union victories there. The regiment marched to relieve the siege of Knoxville, and then spent the last year of the war on occupation duty in Tennessee and Georgia, before being disbanded in November 1865. Raising the regiment Robert Julius Betge was the first colonel of the 68th New York. On July 22, 1861, the United States War Department authorized Robert J. Betge to raise a volunteer infantry regiment in New York.Phisterer, p. 427 Recruited to serve for three years, the men came mostly from Manhattan (New York City), and also from New Jersey, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. The mostly German immigrants were also called the \\"Second German Rifles\\" (the First German Rifles, raised several months earlier, were the 8th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment), but Betge called the regiment the \\"Cameron Rifles\\", after Secretary of War Simon Cameron.Fritsch, p. 19 The officers were also German, and many had served in the armies of Austria, Prussia, and other German states.Kummer, p. 566 In all, 1,020 men filled the ranks when the regiment had finished recruiting. Accepted into service on August 19, the 68th left New York the next day, traveling by train from Perth Amboy, New Jersey, to Washington, D.C., to join the brigade of Brigadier General Louis Blenker in the Army of the Potomac. Blenker was a German immigrant himself, a refugee of the Revolutions of 1848, and many of the units under his command were heavily German-American.Coffey, pp. 12‚Äì13 Encamped at Roach's Mills, Virginia, the 68th participated in the defense of Washington, losing three men in their first combat, a minor skirmish with a Confederate patrol. In November, the Army was reorganized; the 68th was shifted to Colonel Adolph von Steinwehr's brigade and Blenker moved up to command the division. They encamped at Hunter's Chapel, Virginia, for the remainder of the winter. There, Betge was brought before a court-martial, accused of \\"conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman\\": confiscating two horses and other property from \\"loyal\\" Virginia citizens, and taking a bribe to hire the 68th's regimental sutler. He was not convicted, and was permitted to return to the regiment. Shenandoah Valley In March 1862, the Army was again reorganized and Blenker's brigade was merged into the II Corps, led by Maj. Gen. Edwin Vose Sumner. That month the 68th moved to Warrenton, Virginia, where it came into contact with Confederate cavalry; three of the officers were captured.Fritsch, p. 20 The following month, Blenker's brigade was moved into Maj. Gen. John C. Fr√©mont's Mountain Department, necessitating a march to Winchester, Virginia, where the 68th and the rest of Fr√©mont's army guarded the western part of the Shenandoah Valley against incursions by Confederate forces under Lt. Gen. Stonewall Jackson. Their long march had left the 68th bereft of supplies and low on rations. Colonel Betge protested against the mistreatment of his regiment, and was placed under arrest, surrendering command to Lt. Col., John H. Kleefish.Fritsch, p. 21 The initial action in Jackson's Valley Campaign took place to their east, but in June Fr√©mont's force of 15,000 joined the 10,000-man division of Brig. Gen. James Shields to converge on Jackson south of Massanutten Mountain.Foote, v.1, pp. 451‚Äì452 Jackson was determined to attack the two Union columns separately and arranged half of his troops to block Shields on the right side of the mountain, while the other half, commanded by Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, blocked the left side.Foote, v.1, pp. 457‚Äì458 Jackson's wish was realized when, on June 8, Fr√©mont's army attacked. Fr√©mont, believing he was striking Jackson's rear, instead attacked Ewell head-on, and Jackson soon brought his whole force to bear on the Union troops in the Battle of Cross Keys.Foote, v.1, pp. 460‚Äì461 The men of the 68th came under concentrated fire for the first time but were not heavily involved in the battle, although two men were killed. The battle was a defeat for the Union, and Fr√©mont's force did not attack again, being blocked instead by a small holding force from Ewell's wing. The rest of Jackson's force then turned to attack Shields's army the next day at Port Republic, but Fr√©mont's infantry did not figure in the battle, another Confederate victory, though his artillery shelled the enemy from long range.Foote, v.1, pp. 462‚Äì463 After the battle, the 68th marched to Cedar Creek and the army was placed under the overall command of Maj. Gen. John Pope; Fr√©mont's force was designated the First Corps of the Army of Virginia.Foote, v.1, pp. 527‚Äì528 Fr√©mont, who outranked Pope, resigned in protest, and President Lincoln accepted the resignation. Lincoln replaced him with Maj. Gen. Franz Sigel, who had been commanding troops in the Western theater. Sigel was, like many in the First Corps, a German immigrant, and the 68th and the other German regiments in the First Corps were happy for the change in commanders. Sigel ordered the 68th to Luray for picket duty. When they arrived, Betge resigned his commission and Kleefish continued to command the regiment until a new colonel could be assigned. Second Bull Run Major Carl von Wedell briefly commanded the regiment when his superiors had all resigned or been killed. The regiment remained in the Shenandoah Valley until August 1862 when they joined Pope's army and moved south to engage Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. They arrived the day after the Battle of Cedar Mountain, and joined Pope's army in its retreat from that Confederate victory.Kummer, p. 567 After a series of minor actions along the Rappahannock, Pope's forces met Jackson's half of Lee's army near Manassas Station.Foote, v.1, pp. 619‚Äì620 Lee had divided his army into wings led by Jackson and Lt. Gen. James Longstreet and sent Jackson's force to raid Pope's rear to cut his supply line. Pope believed he had a chance to destroy the Army of Northern Virginia one half at a time, and made the decision to attack.Foote, v.1, p. 623 Jackson's men struck the first blow, however, and drove off a portion of the Union force.Foote, v.1, p. 626 The next day, having taken up a strong defensive position along an unfinished railroad, Jackson awaited Pope's advance.Foote, v.1, pp. 631‚Äì633 Pope obliged him, sending the Army forward against Jackson's lines. The 68th and the rest of Sigel's corps occupied the middle of the advancing line. They were unable to break Jackson's lines, and withdrew. The Cameron Rifles had seen some action at Cross Keys, but this was their first experience of fierce fighting and they acquitted themselves well, despite the failure of the attack. By the afternoon, Longstreet joined Jackson with the other half of Lee's army and attacked the Union left. Longstreet believed it was too late for an attack, and did not attack that day, other than in a minor clash where his lines met some federal units at dusk.Foote, v.1, pp. 633‚Äì634 The next day, August 30, Pope attacked Jackson again at 3:00 p.m. in the afternoon.Foote, v.1, p. 637 Again, the attacking forces could not overcome their enemies' positions, and this time Longstreet counterattacked and forced them back toward their original positions.Foote, v.1, pp. 638‚Äì639 Sigel's forces, which did not take part in the initial Union assault, held firm against the Confederate counterattack, but after heavy casualties the army retreated.Foote, v.1, p. 640 Among the casualties were 22 killed from the 68th (including Kleefish) and 59 wounded, making Second Bull Run one of the unit's bloodiest engagements. The Army of Virginia retreated nearly all the way back to Washington.Foote, v.1, p. 641 Pope was relieved and Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan placed in charge of the army once more.Foote, v.1, pp. 646‚Äì647 After burying Kleefish in Washington, the 68th redeployed to Fairfax, Virginia.Fritsch, p. 22 With Kleefish dead and Betge having resigned, command of the regiment fell temporarily to Major Carl von Wedell. The officers then petitioned the Governor Horatio Seymour to commission Gotthilf von Bourry d'Ivernois as their new colonel, which he did. Von Bourry, a veteran of the Austrian army, had served on Blenker's staff as a captain and had impressed the officers of the 68th with his tales of heroism in the Second Italian War of Independence. Army of the Potomac Chancellorsville Gotthilf von Bourry d'Ivernois commanded the regiment from 1862 to 1863, when he was cashiered for drunkenness. The 68th spent September and October 1862 defending Washington where they were attached to Alexander Schimmelfennig's 1st Brigade of the XI Corps in the Army of the Potomac (the re-numbered I Corps formerly of the Army of Virginia) still commanded by Sigel. In November, they advanced to Centreville with the rest of the Army, now under the command of Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside.Foote, v.1, p. 755 Burnside, who had taken over the Army when McClellan was relieved of command earlier that month, was determined to bring battle to the enemy, and he ordered the Army to advance once more to the Rappahannock.Foote, v.2, pp. 20‚Äì21 The 68th, however, remained in reserve with the rest of the XI Corps, and so was spared any part in the defeat that befell the Union Army at the Battle of Fredericksburg. The Army retreated once again, and the 68th joined them in winter quarters at Stafford, Virginia. Morale was low in the Army after Fredericksburg and the retreat that followed, and Burnside was replaced in command by Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker.Foote, v.2, pp. 107, 127‚Äì133 Several corps commanders were also replaced, including Sigel, whose XI Corps passed to Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard on April 2, 1863, when he resigned in protest because he believed he deserved a larger corps.Fritsch, pp. 31‚Äì32; Foote, v.2, p. 251 In a corps of mostly German regiments, Howard was immediately unpopular and his distribution of religious tracts to the troops did not improve the relationship.Foote, v.2, pp. 290‚Äì291 The regiment was smaller, too, than it had been: just 259 present for duty.Kummer, p. 568 Their new commander in the XI Corps's 3rd Brigade was another German, Brig. Gen. Carl Schurz. Hooker brought the Army to the Rappahannock for a third time, but rather than crossing directly into the defenses of the Confederates, he divided his much larger force to attack Lee's army from two sides simultaneously.McPherson, p. 639; Foote, v.2, pp. 264‚Äì266 This time, the 68th and the other regiments of the XI Corps were part of the action, crossing the river with Hooker's main force on May 1, 1863, to attack Lee's left.Foote, v.2, pp. 276‚Äì277 Despite Hooker's careful planning, the Battle of Chancellorsville was another Union defeat. After crossing the Rappahannock, Hooker had ordered the wing including the XI Corps to halt and await the Confederate attack.Fritsch, pp. 41‚Äì42; McPherson, p. 640 Faced with attacks on two sides, Lee daringly divided his smaller force to engage both: the pause allowed Lee to send Jackson with the bulk of the army to meet the Union advance and outflank their right wing the next day, May 2.Foote, v.2, pp. 282‚Äì287 Although he was warned of the impending attack, Howard did not order the units under his command to entrench, and when Jackson's men arrived the XI Corps was caught unprepared.Fritsch, pp. 45‚Äì46; McPherson, p. 642; Foote, v.2, pp. 290‚Äì292 At about 5:15 p.m., Jackson's force of 21,500 men caught the XI Corps in the flank and by surprise as the men were preparing their dinner. Schurz ordered his brigade to shift to meet the assault, and the 68th jumped to action, but they were still overwhelmed by the force of numbers and began a disorganized retreat an hour into the attack.Foote, v.2, pp. 296‚Äì297; Keller, p. 61 After falling back, the 68th and the other retreating units rallied to avoid a complete rout and held off the Confederates until nightfall.Keller, p. 62 The XI Corps suffered nearly 2,500 casualties, including 5 dead, 16 wounded, and 32 missing from the 68th. The next day, the XI Corps held the left of the Union line and was again attacked, but unlike the previous day, they were not at the focus of the Confederate attack.Foote, v.2, pp. 310‚Äì312 The entire army retreated across the Rappahannock the next day, defeated once more. Gettysburg In the wake of Chancellorsville, newspapers heaped scorn on the German regiments, blaming the 68th and the others for the defeat.Fritsch, pp. 68‚Äì69; McPherson, p. 642; Keller, pp. 1‚Äì4 The XI Corps suffered from low morale, and several officers resigned their commissions, including Lt. Col. Carl Vogel and five others from the 68th.Keller, p. 95 The Army of the Potomac pulled back from the Rappahannock, and was soon on the move as the Army of Northern Virginia slipped past and marched north toward Pennsylvania.Foote, v.2, pp. 455‚Äì465 Led by still another new commander, Maj. Gen. George Meade, the Union army followed the Confederates north. The 68th, now with 267 present for duty, had been shifted to the XI Corps's 1st Brigade under Brig. Gen. Leopold von Gilsa when the Army of the Potomac prepared to meet the rebels at the Battle of Gettysburg. The XI Corps was among the first to arrive on the scene on July 1, 1863. Schurz's brigade arrived first, and he ordered them to take up defensive positions north of the town.Foote, v.2, pp. 471‚Äì472 The other two divisions arrived next, and Howard arrayed them to resist the rebel onslaught he knew was coming soon. The landscape was mostly devoid of features that would aid in defense, but Gilsa's men were able to entrench on one low rise, Blocher's Knoll.Fritsch, pp. 75‚Äì77; Pfanz, pp. 244‚Äì245 The 68th was sent forward to skirmish, along with the 54th New York and part of the 153rd New York,Valuska & Keller, pp. 135‚Äì136 and were the first to be attacked and ousted from their positions when Lt. Gen. Jubal Early's Confederate division came on in numbers and outflanked them.Fritsch, pp. 77‚Äì81; Foote, v.2, pp. 475‚Äì476; Valuska & Keller, p. 137 The army retreated south of the town, but Howard, after arguing with Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock over who was in command in Meade's absence, rallied the troops there and ordered them to entrench.Foote, v.2, pp. 482‚Äì484 The 68th began the second day in a more defensible position on Cemetery Hill. This placed them at the center of the Union line, and most of the day's early action was on the flanks.Fritsch, pp. 82‚Äì86 In the evening, however, Early's forces attacked again; the charging Confederates quickly reached the top of the hill and some hand-to-hand combat broke out, but losses were light because the growing darkness made it difficult for soldiers on both sides to shoot accurately.Foote, v.2, pp. 517‚Äì519 Reinforcements from the II Corps arrived and helped the XI Corps hold the position.Foote, v.2, pp. 519‚Äì520 On the third day, the 68th remained in that position, but the major attack of the day, Pickett's Charge, was to their left.Fritsch, pp. 87‚Äì88 The 68th performed better than they had at Chancellorsville, participating in their first Union victory. They paid the price with much higher casualties, 8 killed and 63 wounded; 67 were made prisoners of war, many on the first day during the retreat to Cemetery Hill. In the thick of the action for two out of three days, the 68th lost more men at Gettysburg than in any other battle. Chattanooga campaign Prince Felix Salm-Salm commanded the regiment from 1864 until they were mustered out. Lee's army retreated into Virginia and, after some delay, the Army of the Potomac followed. After a skirmish in Hagerstown, Maryland, on July 12, the 68th crossed the Potomac into Virginia on July 16 and took up guard duty along the Orange and Alexandria Railroad near Warrenton.Fritsch, pp. 89‚Äì91 The regiment remained there until September, when it and the rest of the XI Corps were detached from the Army of the Potomac and sent to Tennessee.Foote, v.2, pp. 764‚Äì766 The XI and XII Corps, under Hooker's command, made up an independent force added to the Armies of the Tennessee, the Cumberland, and the Ohio, which were all operating in that theater. Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans, having just lost the Battle of Chickamauga, was besieged in Chattanooga, and the other armies were gathering to lift the siege and attack the Confederate army there, led by Lt. Gen. Braxton Bragg.Foote, v.2, pp. 757‚Äì763 Traveling for seven days by rail, the 68th arrived in Tennessee on September 30.Fritsch, pp. 95‚Äì96 The regiment spent the first month guarding railroads again, this time west of Chattanooga. Rosecrans soon found himself relieved of duty, and Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant was placed in overall command of the three armies plus Hooker's two corps.Foote, v.2, pp. 802‚Äì803 The 68th, too, saw a change in its leadership when Col. von Bourry was cashiered for drunkenness and command passed to Lt. Col. Albert von Steinhausen.Fritsch, p. 104; Pfanz, p. 245 By this time, losses from Gettysburg and illness had reduced the regiment to 127 men present for duty, just over a tenth of their numbers from the start of the war.Kummer, p. 569 Grant's armies converged on Chattanooga and planned to attack Bragg's army.Foote, v.2, pp. 804‚Äì807 Getting into place required the XI and XII Corps to cross the Tennessee River at Bridgeport, Alabama, and march rapidly for Lookout Valley, opening the supply line to Chattanooga.Foote, v.2, pp. 808‚Äì809 They did so, to the surprise of the Confederate forces there, which had not expected an attack from that quarter. On October 28, Hooker's two corps were attacked by a part of Bragg's army, which had by now been joined by Longstreet and some units from the Army of Northern Virginia.Foote, v.2, pp. 810‚Äì811 Bragg ordered Longstreet to drive the federals back and he attacked. In the ensuing Battle of Wauhatchie, the XII Corps took the brunt of the initial assault. Hooker bypassed Howard and ordered Schurz to bring up the XI Corps to join the fight. The engagement was confused on both sides, but the Union forces were victorious, driving off the rebels and inflicting twice the casualties they received. With the supply lines now reopened to Chattanooga, Grant planned to dislodge Bragg's army.Foote, v.2, p. 812 At the Battle of Lookout Mountain, the 68th was held in reserve on the first day, November 24. The battle continued the next day and a part of Howard's XI Corps, including the 68th, was shifted to the far left of the Union lines to reinforce Sherman's attack on Missionary Ridge.Foote, v.2, p. 850 There, the 68th skirmished with the enemy, but was unable to advance. The Confederates were forced to retreat, however, as Maj. Gen. George Thomas's troops' assault on their center sent Bragg's army into retreat from the ridge.Foote, v.2, pp. 851‚Äì857 Four days later, on November 28, the 68th, still attached to Sherman's army, marched north to relieve Burnside's army, which was besieged in Knoxville, Tennessee. Before they arrived, however, Burnside managed to defeat the enemy, and the regiment returned south.Fritsch, pp. 101‚Äì102 It spent the winter guarding railroads near their winter quarters in Bridgeport. In April, the enlistments of many three-year men were due to expire, including the men of the 68th. The men were sent to Louisville, Kentucky, and then by rail back to New York City for four weeks' leave of absence.Fritsch, p. 104; Kummer, p. 570 With the war not yet over, the government encouraged re-enlisting, and many of the 68th did so. The three-year men of the 8th and 29th Infantry, two other German-American units reduced by casualties and expiring enlistment terms, were consolidated into the 68th.Phisterer, pp. 381, 395 Drafted men and substitutes brought the ranks up to 400 present for duty.Kummer, p. 570 Re- enlistment and the end of the war Fort Pulaski, Georgia. Among those continuing in the army was the colonel of the 8th New York, Prince Felix Salm- Salm. As the 68th had been without a colonel since von Bourry had been cashiered, Governor Seymour appointed Salm-Salm to the post on June 8, 1864.Fritsch, pp. 106‚Äì107 The youngest son of a minor German prince, Salm-Salm had served in the Prussian and Austrian armies before coming to America and joining the Union Army in 1861.Coffey, pp. 14‚Äì15 His appointment to lead the 68th caused consternation among the officers, who had hoped for the promotion of one of their own. They protested to the governor unsuccessfully, but accepted that Salm-Salm was to be their leader. After the commissions and re- enlistments were sorted out, the 68th returned to Tennessee. They were again serving under Hooker in the XX Corps, which was consolidated from the XI and XII Corps and had now been attached permanently to Thomas's Army of the Cumberland. The 68th was assigned to Maj. Gen. James B. Steedman's 4th Brigade of the new corps and spent the next few months patrolling the Nashville and Chattanooga Railway in Tennessee. By that time, Confederate resistance in the area was weakened, and the rails and bridges were not damaged.Fritsch, pp. 110‚Äì111 Salm-Salm's wife, Agnes, joined him during the winter of 1864‚Äì1865, and the officers spent much of their time entertaining.Fritsch, pp. 118‚Äì122 The 68th was not involved in the Battle of Nashville that December, in which Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood's Confederate army was nearly destroyed, but Salm-Salm did get permission to join the battle himself while the 68th stayed at their patrol stations.Fritsch, pp. 124‚Äì125 After Thomas's victory at Nashville, the 68th was ordered to prepare to pursue what remained of Hood's army.Fritsch, pp. 126‚Äì128 They redeployed to Decatur, Alabama, where Salm-Salm rejoined the regiment. They skirmished with Hood's rear guard, but the rainy weather aided the Confederates' escape.Fritsch, pp. 128‚Äì131 Salm-Salm led the regiment in the minor engagements following in January and February 1865 at Elrod's Tan Yard, Hog Jaw Valley, and Johnson's Crook.Coffey, p. 38 As Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's Army of the Tennessee advanced farther into Georgia, the 68th did as well, making Atlanta their headquarters in March 1865.Fritsch, pp. 136‚Äì138 They continued to serve in northern Georgia through the spring and summer of 1865, and were stationed there when news came that the major Confederate armies had surrendered to Grant and Sherman. While there, they were ordered to facilitate the transition from a slave-based economy to a sharecropper system by encouraging plantation owners and their former slaves to sign farming contracts. The 68th moved to Fort Pulaski, outside Savannah, Georgia, in October 1865.Fritsch, pp. 141‚Äì142 The men remained there until November 30, 1865, when, with the war finally ended, the 68th New York was mustered out of federal service. They boarded a steamship for New York and received their final pay at Hart's Island on December 14, where they disbanded.Kummer, p. 571 The regiment had served for more than four years, and had suffered casualties of 47 killed, 133 wounded, and 116 captured.

It is located in Humboldt County. Amenities include hiking trails, a recreated Yurok Village, a native plant garden, visitor center, three family campgrounds, two group camps, a camp for hikers and bicyclists, accessible beaches, lookout points, and three group picnic areas.  Origin of Name  There are conflicting stories as to how the park got the name. The dominant narrative follows the story of scout Patrick Beegan, an Irish immigrant who came from the Mississippi Valley in 1851. After encountering wild potato (his favorite national food), \\"Old Patrick,\\" as he was known to the residents of the Trinidad area, decided to stop and file a preemption claim to the land. The other account follows the story of Patrick McLaughlin, a squatter who arrived in the area in the 1870s. He is credited as planting the first apple trees in the area.  History  Patrick Beegan's claim to the land was first recorded in the Trinidad Record Book on January 13, 1851. The first official mention of Patrick's Point on the Humboldt County map was 1886.

Career  Stevens joined the British blues-rock band Savoy Brown in 1968, and contributed to four of that band's albums over the next two years as bassist and songwriter. Savoy Brown, which also included drummer Roger Earl, guitarist Kim Simmonds and singer/guitarist \\"Lonesome\\" Dave Peverett, built a healthy following in the U.K. and U.S. through extensive touring; they were notable enough in the U.S. that, on 7 September 1969, Stevens became a subject of American performance artist/groupie Cynthia Albritton, better known as \\"Cynthia Plaster Caster.\\"Refer to Cynthia Albritton's official website List of Castees and Failures Retrieved 20 September 2008. Savoy Brown's most successful album during Stevens' tenure with them was Looking In, whose centerpiece song, \\"Leavin' Again,\\" he co-authored. Released in 1970, Looking In reached number 39 on the U.S. Billboard album charts. After a concert tour of the U.S. to support Looking In, Kim Simmonds, Savoy Brown's de facto leader, disbanded this version of the group.Refer to Savoy Brown's official website. Retrieved 13 November 2008. Following this, Stevens, Earl and Peverett, along with guitarist Rod Price, founded Foghat in January 1971. This line-up of Foghat released four albums through 1974, the most successful of which was Energized (released February 1974; U.S. Billboard No. 34). The band relocated to the U.S., where Foghat followed Savoy Brown's approach of building a fan base via near-constant touring. Stevens ultimately came to dislike spending so much time on the road and away from England, and announced his departure from the band in 1975. After leaving Foghat, Stevens returned to England and refocused himself on session work. Most notably, Stevens was a member of the band supporting the Thames Television TV series Rock Follies, whose first soundtrack album entered the U.K. album chart at number 1 in 1976. Rock Follies' composer Andy Mackay, best known as saxophonist/oboist with Roxy Music, also enlisted Stevens' services on his 1978 solo album Resolving Contradictions. Stevens launched several new bands during the late 1970s and early 1980s as well, including Midnight Flyer, managed by Led Zeppelin impresario Peter Grant and featuring singer Maggie Bell. In 1993, music producer Rick Rubin approached the four founding members of Foghat about recording a reunion album. While Rubin ultimately was not involved in the project, Stevens rejoined his ex-bandmates to record 1994's Return of the Boogie Men, and toured with Foghat for the next two years in support of the album. Peverett died in 2000 and Price had left the band yet again in 1999, leaving Stevens and Earl to maintain the band through 2005.

The company was most famous for forging the Hudson River Chain that kept the British Navy from sailing up the Hudson during the American Revolution, and served to protect the strategically important fort at West Point. The works were operational from 1761 to 1842. Initial ore discovery In 1750 the first discovery was made of a rich superficial deposit of iron ore at the south end of Sterling Mountain, in the town of Monroe, New York. In the following year, Ward & Colton erected at the outlet of mine and Sterling Pond, in the extreme southern part of Warwick, near the Monroe line, a charcoal blast-furnace, which was the first in Warwick. These works were called the Sterling Iron-works, honoring General William Alexander known as Lord Stirling, the owner of the land, and later an officer in the Revolutionary army. They were built for the manufacture of anchors, including for the United States frigate, . A second Sterling furnace was built in 1777. Additional mines opened Several other veins of magnetic ore were later opened in the vicinity of the Sterling mine, which itself covered about . The Forest of Dean mine, a very extensive bed six miles (10 km) west-northwest of Fort Montgomery, as early as 1756 supplied a furnace, and was abandoned twenty-one years later. The vein is over thick and broad, and made good cold short iron. The Long Mine, belonging to the Townsends, was discovered in 1761 by David Jones and supplied about 500 tons of ore annually to the Sterling Works over the next 70‚Äì80 years for an aggregate production of about 140,000 tons. It was the only mine at which systematic mining was attempted in that time, and was worked to the depth of on a single vein thick. The ore yielded 62 per cent, of strong tough metal, from which cannon, muskets, wire, steel, fine malleable iron, and harness-buckles were made. The Mountain Mine, half a mile southwest of Long Mine, was found in 1758 by a hunter, in consequence of a tree having been blown up by the roots. The Iron from this mine was remarkable for its strength and fine polish, and was in consequence chiefly exported to England to be tinned. First metal produced in New York Autograph of Peter Townsend, noted in the American Revolution, owner of Sterling Iron Works Mr. Peter Townsend, who became the owner of Sterling Iron before the Revolutionary War, made iron anchors in 1773, and in 1776 produced the first steel in New York, at first from pig and afterward from bar iron. The first blister steel made in the State was made by his son, Peter Townsend, Jr., in 1810, from ore of the Long Mine on the Sterling estate. In the manufacture of edge-tools it was considered equal to the famous Dannemora mine Swedish Iron. The first cannon made in the State were cast at Sterling for the government, in 1816. They were from 6 to 32 pounders. The Hudson River Chain The Great Chain forged at Stirling Iron Works by Peter Townsend At the close of 1779, West Point was the strongest military post in America. In addition to the batteries that stood menacingly upon the hill tops, the river was obstructed by an enormous defensive iron chain. The iron of which this chain was constructed was wrought from ore of equal parts, from the Stirling and Long Mines, in Orange county. The chain was manufactured at the Stirling Iron Works about from West Point. The general superintendent of the work, as engineer, was Captain Thomas Machin, who afterward assisted in the engineering operations at Yorktown, when Cornwallis was captured. The project took place under the supervision of Colonel Timothy Pickering. The chain was completed in the middle of April, 1778, and on 1 May it was stretched across the river and secured. It weighed 186 tons, and was made and delivered in six weeks. This chain was forged at Stirling, hauled piece by piece to New Windsor, and put together at the military smithy of Capt. Machin. It was then floated down the Hudson as a whole, and placed in position. It remained unbroken during the war although others at Fort Montgomery and on the lake above were broken by the British. Links of these chains, weighing . each, are preserved at the Military Academy at West Point. In front of this chain was a heavy boom of logs. Each winter the chain and boom were un-moored, taken up to the beach, in the cove now crossed by the railroad tracks, and piled up out of reach of the moving ice until ready to be replaced in the spring. The chain was instrumental in the discovery of Benedict Arnold, when Peter Townsend's cousin, Sally Townsend, whose brother Robert was a member of Gen George Washington's Culper Ring of spies, allegedly intercepted information at the family home in Oyster Bay, Long Island which occupied by British officers. The intercepted message from Arnold indicated that he had weakened the chain and contained instructions on how the Royal Navy could breach its defenses and take the fort at West Point. When he realized he had been discovered, Arnold escaped to the British and the chain remained intact throughout the war. Iron Chain and Boom at West Point  Origin of boom placed in front of the Hudson River Chain Chaining The Hudson River In the summer of 1777, the Ringwood Iron Works edit:(Long Pond Iron Works) manufactured iron for a boom intended to be installed in front of Fort Montgomery (Bear Mountain) chain. Over 30 tons of chain links and components were carried by ox cart from Ringwood over the Ramapo Mountains to the Hudson River. Unfortunately for the Americans, the British captured the fort and carried away the chain before the boom could be properly installed. After the capture of Fort Montgomery, the Ringwood iron was taken to West Point and used to make the boom placed in front of the West Point chain, which was forged at the Sterling Iron Works and placed across the river in 1778. * Note: The great chain that stretches across the front lawn of Ringwood Manor is not the one of Revolutionary War fame; it was made later and sold to Abram S. Hewitt. Even though Mr. Hewitt probably realized they were a forgery, he kept the links anyway. Regardless, it does give a good idea of what the original huge iron obstacle was like. * Note: In 1967 Margaret Mead with students from Ridgewood schools conducted a week long archaeological dig at the Long Pond Furnace site uncovering the Revolutionary Furnace.

The Multi-Band 5 indicates that it can receive time calibration signals from five radio towers in the world The Wave Ceptor series (stylized as WAVE CEPTOR or WaveCeptor) is a line of radio- controlled watches by Casio. Wave Ceptor watches synchronise with radio time signals broadcast by various government time services around the world. These signals transmit the time measured by atomic clocks accurate to one second in millions of years. By synchronizing daily with the signals, the Wave Ceptor watches achieve high accuracy, using a quartz crystal to keep time between synchronizations. Some radio watches, including some Wave Ceptors, are solar- powered, supported by a rechargeable battery. The display of the models ranges from fully digital, analog and analog-digital. Some later models, described as Hybrid Wave Ceptors, support GPS for information on both time and location, in addition to broadcast signals. Radio-controlled watches require no setting of time, date, or daylight saving time adjustments, as they attempt automatic synchronization several times every night. Without synchronisation, Wave Ceptors, like other commercial quartz timepieces, are typically accurate to ¬± 15 seconds per month; daily synchronization ensures 500 ms accuracy. Most Wave Ceptor watches have a signal strength indicator which shows if the time signal is strong enough to correct the time set. The number of receivers which the watches can tune to vary according to watch model; most current watches can tune to any one of several time signal towers around the world. In Europe, the claimed reception range is approximately 1,500 kilometres.  Locations  Casio watches synchronise to radio time signals from one or more of six low frequency time signal transmitters. The 60kHz signals from different transmitters are not compatible with each other; a watch designed for WWVB only cannot receive MSF. Japan Watches can receive signals from two JJY transmitters: The 40kHz signal from Mount Otakadoya, near Fukushima (Ohtakadoyayama). The 60kHz signal from the Haganeyama Transmitter at Mount Hagane (Haganeyama). China Watches receive the 68kHz signal from BPC at Shangqiu. United States Watches receive the 60kHz signal from WWVB at Fort Collins. United Kingdom Watches receive the 60kHz MSF at Anthorn. Germany Watches receive the 77.5kHz DCF77 at Mainflingen. As an example, Casio Wave Ceptors using modules 3353 and 3354, such as the WVA-440, can tune to signals from both DCF77 (Germany) and MSF (UK). The two submodels use the same electronics module, but with a soldered jumper selecting preferential tuning first to DCF77, or to MSF. This is default behaviour after a factory reset; the user can choose to use either one of the two transmitters with either module, although this limits use when travelling within Europe.Casio: Service manual and parts list, ref. no.

Following his election as President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa called for a referendum on establishing a Constituent Assembly to write a new constitution for the country, which was held on April 15, 2007, and passed with over 80.0% approval. The elections for the Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly were held on September 30, 2007. With 74 seats, Rafael Correa's political party, PAIS Alliance, won the majority of the 130 available seats. The assembly first convened on November 29, 2007, in Montecristi, and was given six months to write a new constitution, with a possible two-month extension. In late July 2008, the assembly approved a draft constitution consisting of 494 articles. When Ecuador began the process of writing a new constitution, they received help from the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund to draft environmental laws giving nature and ecosystems rights.

Analysis Environmental rights The Constitution is the first in the world to recognize legally enforceable Rights of Nature, or ecosystem rights. Article 71-74 prohibits the extraction of non-renewable resources in protected areas. Moreover, the production of monocultures will be avoided for reforestation and rehabilitation of the soil. The state will also protect the intellectual property of collective work based on national biodiversity and begin to recognize the Rights of Nature.Pena, Karla (2008) \\"Putting Food First in the Constitution of Ecuador,\\" Food First Institute for Food & Development Policy, https://www.foodfirst.org/en/node/2301 , (updated 31 October 2008, accessed 21 May 2008).

Impede monopolistic practices and any type of speculation with food products. # Supply food to the victims of anthropogenic or natural disasters in risk of accessing food. International food donations should not affect health or future production of local food. # Prevent and protect the population from consuming contaminated food or places their health in risk or if science has uncertainties of its effects. # Acquire food and primary materials for social and food programs, prioritizing in associative networks of small producers.

Mainly composed of infantry regiments raised in the state of New York primarily by former U.S. Representative Daniel Sickles, the brigade served in several of the Army of the Potomac's most important battles in the Eastern Theater, including Chancellorsville and Gettysburg. Organization and early battles Daniel E. Sickles raised and organized much of what became the Excelsior BrigadeAt the outbreak of the Civil War, the controversial Sickles desired to repair his public image, which had been marred by the shooting death of his wife's paramour, Philip Barton Key. Sickles was active in raising thousands of recruits from around New York City for service in the United States volunteers in May 1861 under the authority of the War Department. The first of Sickles' regiments mustered into service on June 20, 1861. Subsequently, he was appointed as the colonel of one of the four full regiments he organized. Later, Sickles was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers in September 1861, taking command of the brigade.Tagg, p. 62. The four regiments raised by Sickles that comprised the first Excelsior Brigade were the 70th, 72nd, 73rd, and 74th New York Infantry.History of the Excelsior Brigade In October 1861, the 71st New York, along with the 70th through the 74th Regiments and 10 Companies of the 3rd Indiana Cavalry, formed the Second Excelsior Brigade under General Sickles. The brigade was placed under the overall divisional command of Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker in October. Its initial tasks included assisting in the building of defenses around Washington and stopping resupply of the Confederates from Southern Maryland.\\"Major-General Joseph Hooker and the Troops from the Army of the Potomac.\\" Address by Major General Daniel Butterfield, 18 September 1885] In March 1862, Sickles was forced to relinquish command when Congress refused to confirm his commission, but he worked diligently to lobby among his Washington political contacts and reclaimed both his rank and his command on May 24, 1862, in time to rejoin the Army in the Peninsula Campaign.Beckman, p. 84. Because of this interruption, he missed his brigade's significant actions at the Battle of Williamsburg. Sickles was back in charge in time for the Battle of Seven Pines and the Seven Days Battles. On the morning of June 25 at the Battle of Oak Grove, Sickles's New Yorkers encountered difficulties moving through their abatis, then through the upper portions of an impeding swamp, and finally met stiff Confederate resistance, all of which threw the Federal line out of alignment.Sears, pp. 185-86. Sickles was again absent for the Second Battle of Bull Run, having used his political influences to obtain leave to go to New York City to recruit new troops. Col. Nelson Taylor instead led the brigade. The Excelsior Brigade, still under Colonel Taylor as Sickles had been promoted to divisional command, missed the Battle of Antietam in September because the III Corps was stationed on the lower Potomac River, protecting the capital. The brigade's strength had been augmented by the addition of the 120th New York. In the Battle of Fredericksburg, the Excelsiors were led by Col. George B. Hall. Brig. Gen. Joseph W. Revere commanded the Excelsior Brigade during the Battle of Chancellorsville in early May 1863. With the rest of Hooker's old division, it was held in reserve in some woods near the Chancellor House, guarding a road that led to the important United States ford over the Rappahannock River. The Gettysburg Campaign Following the Battle of Chancellorsville, Col. William R. Brewster of the 73rd New York assumed command of the Excelsior Brigade, which was then in the division of Brig. Gen Andrew A. Humphreys. Brewster led the brigade during the Gettysburg Campaign in June and July 1863. On July 2, the brigade was advanced to an area near the Peach Orchard. It was flanked out of that position by the Confederate division of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws. The remains of the brigade took part in a counterattack late in the afternoon that recaptured some abandoned Union guns. Brewster reported that the brigade lost 778 of 1,837 engaged.Brewster's official report Brewster fell ill after the battle, and Brig. Gen. Francis Barretto Spinola assumed command during the pursuit of the Confederate army into Virginia. Spinola's brigade led the Union troops on July 23 at the Battle of Wapping Heights in Linden, Virginia, suffering 18 men killed, including two officers. Spinola was badly wounded in the fighting, along with dozens of his men.Official Records, Vol. XXVII, Part I, pp. 538-41. Spinola was honorably discharged from the service in August 1865. Col. J. Egbert Farnum of the 70th New York then commanded the brigade until Brewster returned to active duty for the autumn campaigns of 1863. Brewster inspired his men by rising from his ‚Äúsick bed‚Äù to lead the Excelsiors in the Mine Run Campaign.Townsend, p. 318. 1864 and the end of the brigade When the Army of the Potomac was reorganized in the spring of 1864 for the Overland Campaign of Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, Brewster retained brigade command. The Excelsior Brigade, augmented with the 11th Massachusetts and the 84th Pennsylvania, served in the Battle of the Wilderness in the Fourth Division, II Corps under Brig. Gen. Gershom Mott. When the remnants of the division became part of the Third Division of Maj. Gen. David B. Birney during the Battle of Spotsylvania, Brewster‚Äôs brigade became the division‚Äôs Fourth Brigade. He led these men at the Battle of Cold Harbor and in the initial operations of the Siege of Petersburg. Then the brigade was abolished. Most of the Excelsiors were moved to the First Brigade, Third Division. The individual regiments mustered out of the army during the summer of 1864, and the men returned home to New York.

Strasburg was selected by Washington with the first pick in the 2009 Major League Baseball draft. He made his major league debut in 2010 and is a three- time All-Star. A talented but unpolished high school baseball player at West Hills High School, Strasburg played college baseball for the San Diego State Aztecs. There, he became one of the best collegiate pitchers in the country. Strasburg pitched for the United States national baseball team at the 2008 Summer Olympics, winning the bronze medal. Two years later, he was called the \\"most-hyped pick in draft history\\" by ESPN and the \\"most hyped and closely watched pitching prospect in the history of baseball\\" by Sports Illustrated. Strasburg's major league debut on June 8, 2010, produced a franchise-record 14 strikeouts. Several months into his major league career, Strasburg tore a ligament in his pitching elbow. The injury required Tommy John surgery and a year of rehabilitation. He rejoined the Nationals on September 6, 2011, but was only able to pitch 24 innings that year. Strasburg‚Äòs 2012 season marked a successful return to form; he was selected to play in the 2012 MLB All-Star Game. Strasburg led the National League (NL) in strikeouts in 2014, pitching an average fastball of 94.8 miles per hour that year. In the 2019 postseason, he recorded five wins, tying the record for most victories in a single postseason, shared by Randy Johnson and Francisco Rodr√≠guez. Strasburg was awarded the World Series MVP award, as he helped lead the Nationals to victory over the Houston Astros. Amateur career High school Strasburg attended West Hills High School in Santee, California. At first, he struggled on the school's baseball team, posting a 1‚Äì10 win‚Äìloss record in his junior year. A twelve-strikeout game against El Capitan High School in his senior year, in which Strasburg allowed just one hit, drew attention from scouts. He finished his senior year with a 1.68 earned run average (ERA) and 74 strikeouts in innings pitched, with seven complete games. He finished with three varsity letters, set school records in ERA and shutouts, and was named his school's 2006 Scholar-Athlete of the Year. He was also named second-team all-league and his team's MVP. Despite these achievements, he was not selected in that year's Major League Baseball draft. College Strasburg had hoped to attend Stanford University but was not accepted there. Although recruited by a number of schools across the country, he enrolled at San Diego State University, where both of his parents attended school. He played college baseball for the San Diego State Aztecs, coached by Baseball Hall of Fame player Tony Gwynn. When he first arrived, Strasburg was an unlikely candidate to pitch collegiate baseball at all; he was quite overweight and out of shape. His conditioning coach nicknamed him \\"Slothburg\\" and encouraged him to quit baseball. He also had a difficult time adjusting to college life, moving out of his dormitory and in with his mother after five days. He acknowledged, \\"I wasn't the most mature guy out of high school. ‚Ä¶ The dorm was an overload, too much, too soon.\\" Strasburg responded with an intense workout regimen, losing in the process. He also worked to improve his mental toughness. Coaches tested him by placing him in high-pressure situations and telling him he needed to get strikeouts. San Diego State used Strasburg as a relief pitcher in his freshman year; he began the season pitching in middle relief before becoming the Aztecs' closer. He held opponents to a .141 batting average against and was named Co-Freshman of the Year for the Mountain West Conference. In the summer of 2007, Strasburg also played for the Torrington Twisters of the collegiate summer baseball New England Collegiate Baseball League (NECBL). He was named to the NECBL First Team as a closer, and was also chosen as the Top Pro Prospect and Top Relief Pitcher in the NECBL. In 2008, as a sophomore, Strasburg was converted to a full-time starting pitcher. He went 8‚Äì3 with a 1.58 ERA and 134 strikeouts in innings. Four of his thirteen starts in 2008 were complete games, two of which were shutouts. On April 11 of that year, he struck out a Mountain West Conference record 23 batters in a game versus the University of Utah. He also gained eight miles per hour on his fastball, regularly working in the upper 90s and touching 100 mph. Strasburg finished his junior year, the 2009 season, 13‚Äì1 with a 1.32 ERA, 59 hits allowed, 16 earned runs, 19 walks, and 195 strikeouts in 109 innings pitched. In his final home start on May 8, 2009, Strasburg threw his first career no-hitter while striking out 17 Air Force Falcons batters. His lone loss came against the Virginia Cavaliers in the NCAA Regionals as Virginia advanced toward the College World Series, but he still struck out 15 in seven innings during the loss. He won the Dick Howser Trophy and the National Pitcher of the Year Award. International play Strasburg was named to the United States national baseball team on June 24, 2008. In that role he appeared in the 2008 World University Baseball Championship, held in late July. The United States won the gold medal in the competition. Strasburg was the lone collegiate player selected for the United States national team at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. In his first start at the Olympics, Strasburg one-hit the Netherlands over seven innings, striking out five of the first six batters he faced and 11 overall. The lone hit Strasburg allowed was a seventh-inning single to Sharnol Adriana. With the United States having already secured a spot in the semifinals medal round, manager Davey Johnson held Strasburg from what would have been his second start on August 20 in order to pitch him in the first round of the semifinals against Norge Luis Vera of the Cuban national baseball team, on August 22. Vera outdueled Strasburg with six innings pitched and only two runs, one earned. Strasburg, meanwhile, lasted only four innings while giving up three runs, two earned. Cuba won the game 10‚Äì2. Strasburg ended up with a 1‚Äì1 record, a 1.67 ERA, and a bronze medal for the Olympics, as the United States won its following contest against Japan 8‚Äì4. He won the USA Baseball Richard W. \\"Dick\\" Case Player of the Year Award in 2008. Professional career Strasburg (left) receiving a Nationals uniform from Ryan Zimmerman, August 2009 Draft On June 9, 2009, Strasburg was drafted number one overall in the 2009 Major League Baseball draft by the Washington Nationals. On August 17, 2009, he signed a record- breaking four-year, $15.1 million contract with the Nationals, just 77 seconds before the deadline, shattering a dollar-amount record previously held by Mark Prior, who signed for $10.5 million in 2001. Strasburg is represented by agent Scott Boras. Minor leagues Strasburg made his professional debut on October 16, 2009, starting for the Phoenix Desert Dogs in the Arizona Fall League at Phoenix Municipal Stadium. He was selected to play in the league's Rising Stars Showcase, but was unable to participate due to a minor neck injury. He also won Pitcher of the Week honors for the week of November 2, 2009 and led the AFL with four wins. Before the 2010 season started, Baseball America named Strasburg as the top pitching prospect, and the second-best overall prospect behind Jason Heyward. Strasburg was assigned to the Harrisburg Senators of the Class AA Eastern League for the start of the 2010 season. There was so much anticipation and hype surrounding Strasburg that there were about 70 credentialed media members in attendance at his April 11, 2010 debut, and ESPN nationally broadcast portions of the game. He won his Senators debut against the Altoona Curve, allowing four hits and four runs (one earned), while striking out eight batters in five innings. During his first home start on April 16, he yielded two hits and an unearned run with three strikeouts in innings in a loss to the New Britain Rock Cats, one where his innings were limited due to a rain delay. Harrisburg set an attendance record in Strasburg's home debut with 7,895 fans. He completed his Class AA stint with a 1.64 ERA while striking out 27 and walking six in 22 innings. Strasburg pitching for the Syracuse Chiefs in 2010 On May 4, 2010, he was promoted to the Syracuse Chiefs of the Class AAA International League. In his first game with the Chiefs, he pitched six scoreless innings, striking out six batters while allowing one hit and one walk. That game drew 13,766 fans‚Äîthe highest attendance in the 135-year history of baseball in Syracuse. In his second start, Strasburg was removed after pitching six no-hit innings. He finished his minor league stint with an overall record of 7‚Äì2, an ERA of 1.30, 65 strikeouts and 13 walks in innings, and a walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) ratio of 0.80. Washington Nationals =Debut= Strasburg made his major-league debut on June 8, 2010, against the Pittsburgh Pirates. A Sports Illustrated columnist termed it \\"the most hyped pitching debut the game has ever seen\\". An ESPN article revealed the colloquial name for Strasburg's celebrated debut as \\"Strasmas\\". Strasburg picked up the win in his debut, pitching seven innings, allowing two earned runs and no walks and 14 strikeouts, setting a new team strikeout record that was previously held by John Patterson (13, twice). Also, he was the first pitcher in history to strike out at least eleven batters without issuing any walks in his pro debut, while falling just one strikeout short of the all-time record for a pitcher's debut‚ÄîKarl Spooner (1954) and J. R. Richard (1971) both struck out 15, but each took nine innings to do it, and each walked three. (Bob Feller also struck out 15 in his first start, although it wasn't his big league debut). He struck out every batter in the Pirates' lineup at least once and struck out the last seven batters he faced‚Äîalso a Nationals record. He threw 34 of his 94 pitches at or faster, including two that reached . Strasburg pitching in his MLB debut In Strasburg's second and third major league starts he struck out another eight and ten batters, respectively, setting a major league record for the most strikeouts in a pitcher's first three starts with 32. The previous record holder had been Richard, who struck out 29 in his first three starts in 1971. Strasburg was also featured in the cover story of Sports Illustrated following his second start. His #37 jersey was the top-selling jersey in all of baseball for the month of June and became the best-selling Nationals jersey of all time in that span. In the 2010 season Strasburg pitched in 12 games, all starts, throwing 68 innings, 92 strikeouts and compiling a 2.91 ERA. He was named a pitcher on the 2010 Topps Major League Rookie All-Star Team. =Injuries and rehab= Strasburg was placed on the disabled list with an inflamed right shoulder in July 2010. He returned to action on August 10, but in his third game back, on August 21, he was removed with an apparent injury. On August 27, the Nationals announced that Strasburg had a torn ulnar collateral ligament, requiring Tommy John surgery, and about 12 to 18 months of rehabilitation. Strasburg made his first rehab start on August 7, 2011 for the Hagerstown Suns. Strasburg made six rehab starts during the 2011 minor league season throwing a total of innings, with 29 strikeouts, compiling a 3.49 ERA and a 1‚Äì1 record. He then made five starts during the 2011 major league season, his first coming against the Los Angeles Dodgers on September6. That year he threw for 24 innings, struck out 24, compiled a 1.50 ERA and a 1‚Äì1 record. =2012 season= In April 2012, Strasburg accumulated an NL- best 34 strikeouts and second-best 1.13 ERA.

Strasburg homers in win, but suffers arm tightness MLB.com Retrieved May 21, 2012 In his June 13 start against the Toronto Blue Jays, Strasburg became the first pitcher of the year to strike out 100 batters. On July 1, Strasburg was elected to his first All-Star Game, alongside teammates Gio Gonz√°lez, Ian Desmond, and Bryce Harper. As part of Strasburg's rehabilitation from his Tommy John surgery, and as a precaution due to his low innings total in 2011, the Nationals decided to limit the number of innings Strasburg would throw in the 2012 season. Although the number was never official, rumors started that Strasburg's limit would be between 160 and 180 innings. It was also decided that Strasburg's shutdown would be final; he would not pitch in the playoffs. Dr. Lewis Yocum, the surgeon who operated on Strasburg's elbow, agreed in 2011 that Strasburg's 2012 innings total should be limited, although he did not consult with Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo or Strasburg during the season. Teammate Jordan Zimmermann underwent a similar process the year before. Strasburg's high profile and the success of the Nationals in the 2012 season made the innings limit a topic of national conversation. In addition to baseball writers, a number of other figures made their views on the topic known, including football broadcasters Troy Aikman and Terry Bradshaw, basketball reporter Stephen A. Smith, and even prominent politicians such as Rudy Giuliani and Mitch McConnell. Rizzo defended the decision to shut down Strasburg and criticized the buzz surrounding it: \\"It's a good conversational piece, it's a good debatable subject. But most of the people that have weighed in on this know probably 10 percent of the information that we know, and that we've made our opinion based upon.\\" The Nationals announced that Strasburg would be scheduled to make his final start on September 12 and would be replaced by John Lannan in the Nationals' starting rotation. However, after a rough outing on September 8, Davey Johnson announced that Strasburg was finished for the 2012 season. Strasburg spent the postseason on the physically unable to perform list as the Nationals lost the 2012 NLDS to the St. Louis Cardinals in five games. He ended the season 15‚Äì6 with a 3.16 ERA, 1.15 WHIP and 197 strikeouts in innings pitched. Strasburg hit .277 with a home run, seven RBIs, and three walks, earning himself a Silver Slugger Award. =2013 season= Strasburg pitched Opening Day for the Nationals at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., on April 1, 2013.

Strasburg finished the playoffs 5-0 with a 1.98 ERA, 0.94 WHIP, and 47 strikeouts and he and teammate Juan Soto were named co-winners of the Babe Ruth Award as the overall postseason MVPs. After winning the World Series, Strasburg opted out of the remaining four years on his contract and became a free agent for the first time in his career.https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-hot-stove-nationals- stephen-strasburg-opts-out-of-contract-becomes-free-agent-per-report/ On December 9, 2019, Strasburg agreed to a seven-year, $245 million contract to return to the Nationals. In the contract, Strasburg has a specific request that the Nationals Park stays open everyday in the off-season so that he could continue to work out. The $35 million annual average value of the contract was at the time the largest amount received by a pitcher in MLB history. =2020 season= Strasburg began the 2020 shortened season on the injured list (IL); he made his 2020 debut on August 9, 2020. On August 14, Strasburg left the second game he started, after facing only three batters. The following day, Strasburg went back to the IL with a nerve issue in his pitching hand. Pitching style Pitch repertoire and approach Strasburg's repertoire features five pitches: a four-seam fastball, his primary pitch at , which was recorded as high as 100 mph early in his career, and for which in the 2010 season was one of only three starting pitchers to have pitches of over 100 mph, and all did so at least 21 times (Justin Verlander and Ubaldo Jimenez); a two-seam fastball at ; a curveball that Strasburg himself refers to as a slurve at ; a changeup at . and a hybrid pitch he began using regularly in the 2016 season that his catcher Wilson Ramos described as a \\"slider-cutter,\\" which moves laterally at . Strasburg throws a mix of all his pitches to left- handed hitters, but he mostly eliminates the changeup when facing right-handed hitters. He is liable to throw his four-seamer or slurve to right-handers with two strikes, and adds the changeup in those counts against lefties. His velocity was not significantly affected by his Tommy John surgery in 2010. He had the fastest four-seam fastball among starting pitchers in the 2012 season, averaging . However, he had only one pitch in the seven seasons since Tommy John surgery to top over 100 mph. Strasburg has a high strikeout rate of 11.2 per 9 innings through his first MLB innings. This corresponds with high swing- and-miss rates across all of his pitches, including 54% on his changeup‚Äîthe highest whiff rate among all starting pitchers' changeups since PITCHf/x began tracking pitches. Through the 2012 season, Strasburg's career strikeout-to- walk ratio of 4.67 would rank second all-time if he had enough innings to qualify. Strasburg maintains that his high strikeout rate is not intentional, and in fact is a hindrance to maintaining low pitch counts. Mechanics Strasburg pitching in 2015 Strasburg's pitching mechanics drew concern early in his career from scouts and coaches. The sequence of Strasburg's delivery was believed to place a great deal of stress on his arm, placing him at greater risk of elbow and shoulder injuries. Indeed, \\"several pitching coaches quietly predicted Strasburg was at risk\\" before the rupture of his elbow ligament. Independent scout Paul Reddick compared his mechanics unfavorably with those of pitching legend Greg Maddux, saying Strasburg's motion was inefficient and badly synchronized. During the 2014 season, analysts noted a slight adjustment in Strasburg's pitching mechanics, as he moved his back foot to rest against rather than partially atop the pitching rubber when going into his throwing motion. Strasburg explained that he had been reluctant to make the change but had come to believe it would improve his development. \\"I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable at first. Working at in between starts, it‚Äôs just become second nature,\\" he told The Washington Post. Strasburg said he had noticed an improvement in his balance and timing as a result of the new foot placement. Personal life Strasburg was born in San Diego, California, to Jim Strasburg, a real estate developer, and Kathleen Swett Strasburg, a dietician. He grew up a San Diego Padres fan. Strasburg credits his maternal grandmother with helping him develop his baseball skills as a child. She would frequently play catch and even work on pitching with him. He labels her as one of his biggest inspirations. On January 9, 2010, he married Rachel Lackey. They met as students at San Diego State. As of 2019, the couple has two daughters. The Strasburgs relocated full-time to Washington, D.C., in 2018 and live a short drive from Nationals Park, where Stephen regularly works out even during the offseason, according to The Washington Post. On June 24, 2014, Strasburg stated in an interview that he was going to stop chewing tobacco in the wake of his college coach Tony Gwynn's death, although he admitted to The Washington Post two years later that he had not yet completely kicked the habit.

Design  The locomotives had a Winterthur cogwheel drive with one lower and one upper pair of cylinders. On the level, they ran like normal steam locomotives using the lower, higher pressure, pair of cylinders driving on the third coupled axle. Before entering the rack section the upper drive was started using live steam. At the same time the r.p.m. was matched to the running speed so that entry into the rack section could be achieved smoothly. Once the cogwheel had engaged the rack, the exhaust from the lower cylinders was routed to the upper, lower pressure, ones using a change valve and was expelled from the chimney. The locomotive now worked as a compound. The cylinders of the adhesion and cogwheel drives have the same diameters (√ò 560 mm). The difference in volume (after expulsion from the adhesion system, the steam doubles its volume) is compensated for because the cogwheel drive turns twice as fast. The driving cogwheel is housed in a special frame, that lies above the second and third axle. The higher cogwheel drive and the lower cogwheel are coupled via an intermediate gear with a transmission ratio of 1:2.43. The boilers were given steel fireboxes and the frame was reinforced, especially in the area of the drive. The outermost axles, which had side play, were given return springs to minimise hunting.  Operations  The DRG organised these tank locomotives into Class 97.5 in their numbering plan. They were employed on the 1-in-10 Honau-Lichtenstein rack railway, 2.2 km long, which employed a Riggenbach-Klose rack system., p 299. Apart from 97 503, which was destroyed during the Second World War, remained there until their retirement in 1961. Number 97 502 returned to its producer, the Maschinenfabrik Esslingen (now owned by Daimler-Benz) at Esslingen am Neckar and was set up as a monument there, before being moved to Bochum-Dahlhausen Railway Museum. From 1952 locomotives 97 502 and 504 were modernised in the Maschinenfabrik Esslingen in order to raise their running speed in both adhesion and cogwheel working. To increase their radius of action numbers 97 501, 502 and 504, the coal tank capacity was increased by 1 tonne.

In some accounts they were called the Timpiavat, Timpanogot, Timpanogotzi, Timpannah, Tempenny and other names. During the mid-19th century, when Mormon pioneers entered the territory, the Timpanogos were one of the principal tribes in Utah based on population, area occupied and influence. Scholars have had difficulty identifying (or classifying) their language; most communication was carried out in Spanish or English, and many of their leaders spoke several native dialects of the Numic branch of the Uto-Aztecan language family. The Timpanogos have generally been classified as Ute people. They may have been a Shoshone band, since other Shoshone bands occupied parts of Utah. Nineteenth- century historian Hubert Howe Bancroft wrote in 1882 that the Timpanogos were one of four sub-bands of the Shoshone. Chief Walkara, also known as Chief Walker, was a noted mid-19th-century chief who led his people against Mormon settlers in the Walker War. The Shoshone and Ute shared a common genetic, cultural and linguistic heritage as part of the Numic branch of the Uto- Aztecan language family. Most Timpanogos live on the Uintah Valley Reservation, established by executive order in 1861 and affirmed by congressional legislation in 1864, where they are counted with the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation. In 2002, the Timpanogos won a federal case against the state in the Court of Appeals upholding their traditional rights to hunt, fish and gather on the reservation. The court concluded that their relationship with the federal government was well- established, although they are not listed by the Department of the Interior as a federally-recognized tribe. They have submitted an application and documentation to the Department of the Interior seeking federal recognition as an independent tribe. Pre-European history Mt. Timpanogos, named for the tribe The Timpanogos probably entered Utah as part of the southern Numic expansion around 1000 CE (including the Ute) or in the subsequent central Numic Shoshonean expansion north and west from their Numic homelands in the Sierra Nevada. They were hunter-gatherers, living mostly on fish and wild game caught by the men and cooked and processed by the women and on the seeds and roots of wild plants gathered and prepared by the women. As part of their religion, in the mornings they gathered together and greeted the morning with song to express gratitude to the Creator. They were divided into clans, each with its headman, spiritual leader and warrior. The clans would band together for specific purposes, such as hunting. There was no division of the land, and people were free to travel to different villages. They developed an extensive trading network. The Timpanogos lived in the Wasatch Range around Mount Timpanogos (named after them), along the southern and eastern shores of Utah Lake of the Utah Valley and in Heber Valley, Uinta Basin and Sanpete Valley. The band around Utah Lake became dominant due to the area's food supply. During the spring spawning season at Utah Lake, the tribes hosted an annual fish festival. Timpanogos, Ute and Shoshone bands would come from away to gather fish. At the festival there was dancing, singing, trading, horse races, gambling and feasting. It was an opportunity for young people to find a mate from another clan, since exogamous marriage (outside their clan) was required.History of the Timpanogos Tribe The shores of Utah Lake became a sacred meeting place for the Timpanogos, Ute and Shoshone tribes. European and American contacts The first known Europeans to enter this area were a Spanish expedition of Franciscan missionaries led by Father Silvestre V√©lez de Escalante. The Dominguez‚ÄìEscalante Expedition of 1776 was trying to find a land route from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Monterey, California. Two or three Timpanogos from the Utah Valley were guides for the party. On September 23, 1776, they traveled down Spanish Fork Canyon and entered the Utah Valley. Escalante documented the expedition in his journal, describing the people who lived around Utah Lake: > Round about it are these Indians, who live on the abundant fish of the lake, > for which reason the Yutas Sabuaganas call them Come Pescados [FishEaters]. > Besides this, they gather in the plain grass seeds from which they make > atole, which they supplement by hunting hares, rabbits, and fowl of which > there is great abundance here. The explorers named many geographic features in central Utah for the Timpanog tribe, who were then led by Turunianchi. The next recorded European visitor was √âtienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper who visited the Timpanog in October 1824; the city of Provo and the Provo River are named after him. In 1826, American mountain man Jedediah Smith visited a camp along the Spanish Fork (river) with 35 lodges and about 175 people.  Conflicts with the Mormons Fort Utah in 1850 By the time Mormon pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, the Timpanogos were guided by Turunianchi's grandson, Walkara. Walkara led the tribe with a number of sub-chiefs, most of whom were his brothers: Chief Arapeen, Chief San-Pitch, Chief Kanosh, Chief Sowiette, Chief Tabby-To-Kwanah, Chief Grospean and Chief Amman. Brigham Young once called them a \\"royal line\\" of Indian chiefs, and they had hereditary leadership through their clan. Parley P. Pratt explored the Utah Valley and Utah Lake. Battle Creek massacre The first battle between settlers and Indians, known by the Americans as the Battle Creek massacre, occurred in early March 1849 at present-day Pleasant Grove, Utah. A company of 40 Mormon men went to the Utah Valley to persuade the Timpanogos to stop stealing cattle from the Salt Lake Valley; both peoples were competing for resources. Brigham Young ordered the Mormons \\"to take such measures as would put a final end to their depredations in future\\". He did not however tell the men to attack unless attacked. \\"0pen Hand and Mailed Fist: Mormon-Indian Relations in Utah, 1847‚Äì52\\" by Howard A. Christy, Utah Historical Quarterly Volume XLVIHose a Stout Diary, 8 vols., 4:48, typescript, Lee Library, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah. A renegade band of Ute Indians had raided herds and taken stock from Tooele Valley and southern Great Salt Lake Valley; the men had earlier declared their opposition to the white settlers. The band was led by three brothers, \\"Roman Nose,\\" \\"Blueshirt,\\" and possibly \\"Cone\\". Reportedly their chief had driven them out of Utah Valley because they refused to stop stealing cattle from the Mormons. See Oliver B. Huntington Diary, pp. 52‚Äì53, Lee Library. The company went to the village of Little Chief, who told them where the men who had stolen cattle were. Little Chief had no positive relationship with those who were attacking the saints, for he had driven them out. The Mormons then attacked the village, killing the three or four Timpanogos who had stolen and killed the cattle. They took any women and children who did not have the necessary provisions of survival, gave them the need provisions (blankets, meat) understanding that the tribes men attacked the cattle out of desperation of food. The relationships between the two peoples started to develop more positively in the months following. Battle at Fort Utah On March 10, 1849 Brigham Young ordered 30 families to colonize Utah Valley, with John S. Higbee president and Dimick B. Huntington and Isaac Higbee counselors. The group of about 150 people headed for Timpanogos territory, and the Timpanogos viewed this as an invasion of their territory and sacred land. As the colonizers entered the valley, they were blocked by a group of Timpanogos led by An-kar-tewets and warned that trespassers would be killed. Huntington raised his hand and swore by the sun god that they would not try to drive the Timpanogos off their lands or take away their rights. The Timpanogos let them enter The settlers built a stockade, Fort Utah, arming it with a twelve-pound cannon. They built several log houses, surrounded by a palisade 20 by 40 rods long () with gates at the east and west ends and a middle deck for the cannon. The fort, built on the sacred grounds of the annual fish festival, was very close to the main Timpanogos village on the Provo River. The settlers fenced off pastures, and their cattle ate (or trampled) the seeds and berries which were an important part of the Timpanogos' diet. By fishing with gill nets they took more than they needed, leaving an insufficient amount for the Timpanogos. With their traditional food sources gone, the Timpanogos starved. The settlers also brought measles, endemic to them but an unfamiliar infectious disease to the Timpanogos. Lacking acquired immunity, the natives experienced epidemics with high mortality rates which disrupted their society. They asked the settlers for medicine to fight the new disease. In August a Timpanogo, Old Bishop, was murdered by Rufus Stoddard, Richard Ivie, and Gerome Zabrisky for his shirt. The angry Timpanogos demanded that the murderers be handed over to them, but the settlers refused. Some Timpanogos shot at trespassing cattle or stole corn in retaliation. The winter was hard, and the Timpanogos stole cattle to survive. By January 1850, the settlers at Fort Utah reported the increasing tension to officials in Salt Lake City and requested a military party to attack the Timpanogos. A militia from Salt Lake City engaged the Timpanogos in battle on February 8 and 11. On February 14 eleven Timpanogo warriors surrendered, but the militia executed them in front of their families and a government surgeon beheaded them after death for research. The militia lost one man and killed 102 Timpanogos. Walker and Black Hawk Wars By the time of the Walker War, named for Chief Walkara, the Timpanogos numbered only about 1,200. The war included several armed conflicts with settlers and Mormon militiamen. Chief Black Hawk, leader of the Black Hawk War, was a son of San-Pitch. The war was more extensive, with additional deaths on both sides. Uintah Reservation  According to a state of Utah historical website, > In 1861, President Abraham Lincoln signed an executive order establishing > the original Uintah Valley Reservation in the eastern part of the Utah > territory ... Congress ratified the order in 1864 ... A council of the Ute > people was called at Spanish Fork Reservation on 6 June 1865. The aged > leader Chief Sowiette (a brother of Chief Walkara, who had died 10 years > before) explained that the Ute people did not want to sell their land and go > away, asking why the groups couldn't live on the land together. Chief > Sanpitch (another brother of Walkara) also spoke against the treaty. > However, advised by Brigham Young that these were the best terms they could > get, the leaders signed. The treaty provided that the Utes give up their > lands in central Utah, including the Corn Creek, Spanish Fork, and San Pete > Reservations. Only the Uintah Valley Reservation remained. They were to move > into it within one year, and be paid $25,000 a year for ten years, $20,000 > for the next twenty years, and $15,000 for the last thirty years. (This was > payment of about 62.5 cents per acre for all land in Utah and Sanpete > counties.) However, Congress did not ratify the treaty; therefore, the > government did not pay the promised annuity. Nevertheless, in succeeding > years most of the Utah Ute people were removed to the Uintah Reservation. By 1872 all the Timpanogos had moved to the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation, but some occasionally returned to fish on Utah Lake into the 1920s. Population estimates In 1847, at the time of the Mormon pioneers' arrival, the Timpanogo population has been estimated at about 70,000; their numbers had been dwindling because of competing bands of Shoshone raiders since the early 19th century. Many died from smallpox and other infectious diseases introduced by American settlers, and an early-1850s measles epidemic was particularly devastating. Many Native American tribes had their numbers reduced by more than 90 percent as a result of disease introduced by Europeans. The number of Timpanogos may have been less. \\"The exact number of all the Indians who lived in Utah Territory is unknown. An 1861 report from J. F. Collins, Utah superintendent of Indian affairs, said that no one had ever 'been able to obtain satisfactory information in regard to their numbers'. Collins estimated ... that there may have been fifteen to twenty thousand Indians (of all tribes) in Utah prior to the arrival of the first Mormon settlers\\" in 1847. Indian Superintendent Forney's 1859 annual report to the federal commissioner of Indian affairs provided estimates of tribal numbers: * Shoshones or Snakes ‚Äì 4,500 (This did not include the Timpanogos; other Shoshone lived in northern and western Utah.) * Bannocks ‚Äì 500 * Uinta Utes ‚Äì 1,000 * Spanish Fork and San Pete Farms ‚Äì 900 (farms and reservations; those on farms were Timpanogos.) * Pahvant (Utes) ‚Äì 700 * Paiutes (South) ‚Äì 2,200 * Paiutes (West) ‚Äì 6,000 * Elk Mountain Utes ‚Äì 2,000 * Honey Lake Washo ‚Äì 700 This gives a total of 18,500 Native Americans estimated to live in Utah in 1859, listing all tribes and bands by names commonly used at the time. Historical confusion The Timpanogos may have been a Shoshone band who were part of the Central Numic people or a branch of the Southern Numic people, which includes the Ute. During the pioneer era, they were often called the Utah Indians (sometimes confused with the Ute Indians). At the time, most Ute were from Colorado and farther east in Utah. Three major groups of Ute Indian bands were placed by the federal government in the Uinta Valley Reservation during the 1880s. Afterward, the Utah Indians (or Timpanogos) became conflated with‚Äîand were often considered to have merged with‚Äîthe Ute Indians in historical documents. Although many historians refer to Sowiette, San-Pitch and their people as Utes, at the time of the Uinta treaty they were known as the Utah Indians or Timpanogos. According to some of their descendants, they became known as the Ute only after moving to the Uintah Reservation and joining other Ute there. The Timpanogos are not usually listed as a current (or former) Shoshone band. In Timpanogos Tribe vs Conway, (2002), U.S. Appeals Court Judge Tena Campbell ruled: \\"Plaintiff asks the court to make unreasonable inferences and leap to the conclusion that because Mr. Montes and his ancestors are not Ute, the (Timpanogos Tribe), whose members include Mr. Montes, is a Shoshone tribe in existence since aboriginal times and for whom the reservation was set aside. The court will not make that leap, nor will it allow a jury to do so.\\" Judge Campbell ruled that President Abraham Lincoln did not establish the Uintah Valley Reserve; it was not officially established until its authorization by Congress in 1864. Lincoln signed an executive order creating the Uintah Valley Reservation dated October 3, 1861. According to the September 6, 1858 Annual Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Utah Superintendency, the Utah (Timpanogos) appear to have been considered separate from the Snake Indians and the other Shoshone: > The tribes and fragments of tribes with whom I had business relations ... > are as follows, to wit: on the second day of December last I was visited by > San-Pitch, a principal chief of the Utahs, and a few of his men ...

In court cases, they have been classified as part of the Ute Indian Tribe and outside it. Although most Timpanogos live on the reservation and continue their culture, many are of mixed race with less than one-half Native American blood; this determines which federal programs (such as education) they may qualify for. During the 1950s, the federal government stopped recognizing most mixed-blood Ute as part of its Indian termination policy. The Ute tribe consists of bands of Uintah, White River and Uncompahgre Ute people who were forced to relocate to Utah by the Congressional Act of 1880. They gradually intermarried, and some differences between bands lessened. Under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal), the Ute bands organized as a unified tribe with a constitution based on the election of a chief and council. Their documents did not mention the Timpanogos, who believe that the 1950s federal termination of Native American status of the Ute tribe's mixed-blood members should have had no effect on themselvesNote: This is in contrast with the Ute position in Ute Tribe v. Utah 773 F.2d 1087, 1093 (10th Cir. 1985) (en banc), what the parties called Ute III.Ute Indian Tribe v. State of Utah, et al., (D.C. Nos. 2:75-CV-00408-BSJ and 2:13-CV-01070-DB-DBP), Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals (2015). Note: The 1985 case had reaffirmed the boundaries of three areas of Ute reservation lands against the state challenge. The US Supreme Court declined to hear this case. But, the state continued to prosecute Ute persons on what was tribal reservation land and got a separate case to the state Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court. In Hagen v. Utah (1994), 510 U.S. 399, 421‚Äì22, the US Supreme Court agreed with the state that a portion of Uintah Reservation had been reduced by Congressional action since 1985. When the state began again to prosecute Ute within the reservation in state courts for offenses, the Appeals Court brought the case back in 1997 to reconcile the boundaries of the different cases, calling it Ute V. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the boundary issue was resolved. Afterward, the state began again to prosecute Ute for offenses in Indian country, apparently to challenge the court ruling. In 2015 the Appeals Court heard testimony from the Ute Indian Tribe plaintiffs and ruled that this disruptive behavior by the state and county officials had to stop, saying that the issues had been settled for nearly 20 years. > And the case for finality here is overwhelming. The defendants may fervently > believe that Ute V drew the wrong boundaries, but that case was resolved > nearly twenty years ago, the Supreme Court declined to disturb its judgment, > and the time has long since come for the parties to accept it. In 2000 the Timpanogos sued the state of Utah in Timpanogos Tribe v. Conway, seeking continued rights for their members for hunting, fishing and gathering on the Uintah Valley Reservation within the boundaries established by the case known as Ute V (Ute Tribe v. Utah, 1997). They sought an injunction against state prosecution within the reservation and acknowledgement by the state as the \\"Indians of Utah\\" referred to in the 1861 executive order and 1864 act of Congress establishing the reservation. The Ute Indian Tribe filed with the state against the Timpanogos, arguing that the latter were part of the Ute Tribe and not independent. The issues were narrowed on appeal. Judge Tena Campbell concluded in Timpanogos v. Conway (2002) that the Timpanogos Tribe merged with the Ute Indian Tribe in 1865, ruling that the members had rights for hunting, fishing and gathering on the reservation.Note: Historically the several bands of Utes had lived independently in the territory of Colorado and Eastern Utah. But their relocation by an act of Congress to the existing Uintah Valley Reservation in the 1880s had the legal effect of a treaty recognizing them as a tribe, as noted by the courts. Because of the conflicting judicial rulings, the Timpanogos have applied to the Department of Interior for independent federal recognition and a clarification of their current rights and status.

The purpose of the program was to develop a lighter, yet highly reliable light machine gun (LMG). The program was initiated in 2004, when the Joint Service Small Arms Program (JSSAP) challenged the American defence industry to develop a lighter small arms and also design lighter ammunition. The LMG provides a major reduction in weight over legacy weapons, as well as improvements in other areas, such as controllability and reliability. As of 2008, it had two configurations, one that fires cased telescoped ammunition, and one that fires caseless ammunition. After further research and development into both technologies and the guns that fire them, one of the two variants was to be chosen for production. By May 2015, 85,000 cased-telescoped rounds had been fired through 10 test weapons, with testers claiming the weapon had gone as far as it can go until the Army decides if it wants to make it a program of record.Textron Unveils Ultra-Light 7.62mm Machine Gun Effort - Kitup.Military.com, 20 May 2015 History left Development began with the two types of weight-reducing ammunition, and a light machine gun to serve as a testbed and technology demonstrator. Use of an LMG for this purpose is notable, considering its greater technical complexity than infantry rifles. The use of advanced computer simulations to accelerate development may have mitigated this. For development, the use of extensive computer simulation and modelling reduces both time and expenditure for prototyping and testing. The program also uses a 'spiral development' approach, whereby the weapon and ammunition is rolled out in stages or 'spirals', each stage producing a new version that is an improvement on those from previous spirals. A competition down-selected the design concepts of various companies to leave an AAI Corporation-led team of companies as the developers of the weapon system. The cohesive team of companies is combined with government support to ensure success. The parallel development of the two ammunition types meant that, if the caseless ammunition effort succeeded, much of the development work gained with the composite cased weapon could be applied to it, and, if it failed, the composite-cased version was likely to succeed on its own. Design LSAT without magazine, mock fire for the first time by Picatinny Senior Commander and PEO Ammunition Brig. Gen. Jonathan A. Maddux at Picatinny Arsenal The LMGs built made a 44% and 43% reduction of weight (for the cased telescoped and the caseless weapons, respectively). Secondary goals have also been met: the LMG has the potential to improve battlefield effectiveness (due to its simpler and more consistent weapon action, its light weight and low recoil, and its stiffer barrel); its use of recoil compensation (with a long-stroke gas-system, for example) has produced positive feedback regarding controllability; the simpler mechanism of the LMG is both more reliable and easier to maintain; a rounds counter has been integrated to improve maintainability, and the weapon is capable of accepting other electronic devices; improved materials used in the chamber and barrel have reduced heat load on the weapon; and the weapon cost is equivalent to the existing M249. The standard LSAT machine gun weighs 9.4 lb empty, compared to 17.6 lb for a standard SAW. Cased telescoped ammunition weighs 40% less than brass-cased ammo, so a 100-round ammunition belt weighs about 2 lb for the LSAT, compared to 3.3 lb for a brass-cased belt.Cased telescoped ammo readiness level 7 - Militarytimes Gearscout.com, November 7, 2012 A soldier engages a close range target with the light machine gun during a military unit assessment at Fort Benning, Ga. The LMG design is a traditionally laid-out machine-gun. It has several features conducive to its use as a light machine gun, such as a quick-change barrel, a vented handguard, a belt feeding mechanism, provisions for the use of an ammunition pouch, and a rate of fire of approximately 600 RPM. Other features include its light weight, an ammunition counter, and a highly stiff and heat resistant barrel achieved with the use of fluting and specialized alloys. When firing, the weapon's chamber swings around a longitudinal pivot; it swings from horizontally parallel with the pivot (the firing position) to vertically parallel (the feed position), and back again.http://www.aaicorp.com/New/Advancedprograms/html/lsat_video.html A long- stroke gas-piston is used to operate this action. A round is fed into the chamber at the feed position using a rammer, and the new round also serves to push a spent or dud round out of the far end of the chamber. Such rounds are pushed forward, parallel to the barrel, and they slide into a separate mechanism that ejects them out of one side of the gun. The advantages of this whole action include its simplicity, its isolation of the chamber from barrel heat, and its positive control of round movement from extraction to ejection. In the caseless firing version of the weapon, another mechanism is introduced to seal the chamber during firing, accounting for the slightly increased weight of the caseless version. Testing In September 2011, 19 soldiers participated in a two-week assessment of the LSAT light machine gun at Fort Benning, Georgia to demonstrate its capabilities against the M249 SAW. In one test the soldiers, half armed with SAWs and half with LSATs, marched six miles in full combat gear then fired at targets to measure stress and muscle fatigue. Another test had the soldiers sprint 200 yards wearing body armor and a basic load of ammunition, then rapidly engage close-range targets. A third week involved soldiers of the 75th Ranger Regiment performing a squad maneuver live-fire exercise in an urban setting. Feedback from participants favored the LSAT for its lighter weight and decreased recoil. Soldiers remarked the LSAT had better accuracy than the M249. The semi-automatic option made it more viable for room clearing. One Ranger even said the LSAT performed better than the Mk 46 machine gun used by special operations forces.New light machine gun aims to 'SAW' Soldiers' load ‚Äì Picatinny Arsenal, November 4, 2011 15 out of 19 soldiers that participated in the assessment said they would prefer using the LSAT in combat rather than the SAW. The LSAT LMG is 41 percent lighter than the SAW and its ammunition volume is 12 percent less, enabling all the soldiers that maneuvered the woodland obstacle course to complete it faster when carrying it. Participants also took less time to zero their machine guns when using the LSAT; one soldier failed repeatedly to accurately zero the SAW but successfully zeroed the LSAT on the first try. The LMG users completed the course, on average, one minute and 11 seconds faster than SAW users due to increased mobility given by its shorter length, adjustable stock, and lighter ammo. When firing, gunners felt virtually no recoil from the LSAT LMG.Soldiers prefer lighter machine gun during assessment - Army.mil, 23 May 2014 The eight prototype weapons fired a combined 25,000 rounds, moving its cased telescoped ammunition to technology readiness level 7. The LSAT light machine gun was assessed in the Army's Dismounted Non-Networked Experiment (DNNE) in August 2013 at Fort Benning.AAI Awarded $2.05 Million Contract for Continued Lightweight Small Arms Technologies Development - AAICorp press release, 6 August 2013 It was among several items showcased at an event at Fort Benning through 24 September 2013 featuring the Army's latest individual and squad kit developments.Army to Show Off Newest Infantry Toys - Kitup.Military.com, 6 September 2013 Seven LSAT LMGs and 9,700 rounds were provided to three rifle squads and one weapon squad at a series of range events. They increased lethality at all ranges with faster speed of engagement and better shot placement, increased the gunner's mobility due to its reduced size and weight, and led to more precision fires in standing and kneeling positions. Future improvements The designers project further improvements. These include improved projectile technologies such as environmentally friendly bullets and a change in bullet size in order to increase combat effectiveness, as well as the integration of electronics such as ammunition count readouts, lasers, optical sights, rangefinders, and bullet drop compensation. The Army is pursuing cased telescoped ammunition. This development is far along, and they say a new LMG could be fielded by 2014 with unequivocal support. The Marine Corps is pursuing caseless ammunition, which is less developed and will take several more years to refine.Caseless ammo could cut 25 lbs. from gear ‚Äì Militarytimes, May 21, 2012 A compact version is also being developed with a 4-inch shorter barrel and folding, telescoping buttstock. The 5.56 mm LSAT machine gun has been renamed the Cased Telescoped Light Machine Gun (CT LMG).New light machine gun: M249 put on weight control - Army.mil, 6 May 2015 On 14 May 2014, Textron Systems was awarded a two-year $5.7 million contract for work that included development of 7.62 NATO cased-telescoped ammunition and an operating mechanism to incorporate into the LSAT machine gun to create a lightweight 7.62 mm version.Textron Systems' Light Armaments Team to Develop Lightweight, Cased-Telescoped Small Arms for U.S. Army - Marketwatch.com, 14 May 2014Army Awards Contract for 7.62mm LSAT - Kitup.Military.com, 6 June 2014 Textron unveiled their 7.62 mm cased-telescoped machine gun design at the 2015 Special Operations Forces Industry Conference. It weighs , almost lighter than the M240L and much lighter than the M240B. A firing prototype is expected to be ready by fall 2016. 2016 developments During 2016 the LSAT program advanced the 7.62mm LMG to TRL 7, with range testing. It also finished development on the 6.5mm derivative of the 7.62mm CT cartridge and tested that as well. The program had by the end of 2016 demonstrated the target weight savings and moved on to more capable longer range 6.5mm ammunition. 2018 developments In July 2018, the US Army announced a new, different program to develop a replacement for the M249 light machine gun, with six companies, including Textron, competing to develop the Next Generation Squad Weapon- Automatic Rifle (NGSW-AR or NGSAR), replacing the SAW, as well as develop ammunition for it that is at least 20% lighter. Physical requirements state a target of 12 lbs and 35 inches of length using an Army-desired 6.8mm bullet. The NGSW-AR contracts awarded July 2018 include prototypes and ammunition which should be delivered for Army evaluation in June 2019. Both NGSW-R and NGSW-AR prototypes will eventually be tested. The NGSW program effectively replaces the LSAT program.

His state funeral followed five days later at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in his hometown of Yorba Linda, California. His death was the first Presidential death in 21 years, since President Lyndon B. Johnson's death in 1973, which occurred while Nixon was President. Nixon suffered a cerebrovascular accident on April 18, 1994, at his home in Park Ridge, New Jersey, and was taken to New York Hospital‚ÄìCornell Medical Center. After an initial favorable prognosis, Nixon slipped into a deep coma and died four days later. His body was flown to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, Orange County, California, via SAM 27000, the presidential plane used as Air Force One while Nixon was in office. His body was transported to the Nixon Library and laid in repose. A public memorial service was held on April 27, attended by world dignitaries from 85 countries and all five living Presidents of the United States, the first time that five U.S. presidents attended the funeral of another president. Nixon's state funeral is unique among recent presidential state funerals in that, in accordance with his own wishes, none of the elements of the state ceremonies occurred in the nation's capital. Nixon's wife, Pat, had died ten months earlier on June 22, 1993. Death and tributes Nixon suffered a massive stroke at his Park Ridge, New Jersey home, while preparing to eat dinner on Monday, April 18, 1994, at 5:45 p.m. EDT. An ambulance was called and he was taken to New York Hospital‚ÄìCornell Medical Center. He was conscious but unable to speak, and his vision was impaired.Black, Conrad (2007), p. 1051 It was determined that a blood clot resulting from his heart condition had formed in his left atrium (upper heart), then broke off and traveled to his brain. His condition was determined to be stable the following day, as he was alert but unable to speak or move his right arm and leg. Nixon's prognosis was hopeful, and he was moved from the intensive care unit into a private room. His condition worsened that Tuesday night, however, complicated by symptoms of cerebral edema, or swelling of the brain. Nixon's living will stipulated that he was not to be placed on a ventilator to sustain his life. On Thursday, Nixon sank into a coma. That Friday night, he died at 9:08 p.m., April 22, 1994. His daughters, Tricia and Julie, were by his side. U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Nixon's death in the White House Rose Garden and proclaimed a national day of mourning five days later. Clinton stated that Nixon was \\"a statesman who sought to build a lasting structure of peace\\" and praised his \\"desire to give something back to this world.\\" Clinton said that he was \\"deeply grateful to President Nixon for his wise counsel.\\" Tributes also came from former Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former Senator George McGovern (who ran against Nixon in 1972), former Senator Howard Baker, Senator Robert Dole, Senator John McCain and Senator Edward M. Kennedy also reflected on Nixon's death. Events in California Transportation to the Nixon Library Following the news of Nixon's death, tributes were placed at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, California, the site of his birthplace. On April 26, the casket was placed into VC-137C SAM 27000, a member of the presidential fleet used as Air Force One while Nixon was in office, and flown to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, Orange County, California. The body was transported in a motorcade, by hearse, to the Nixon Library. Lying in repose Nixon's funeral on April 27, 1994, was attended by President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton, accompanied by former U.S. Presidents (right to left) Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, with Betty Ford, Rosalynn Carter, Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush respectively. Carried by eight military pallbearers representing all branches of the United States military, Nixon's body was placed in the library lobby and lay in repose from the afternoon of Tuesday, April 26 to the afternoon of Wednesday, April 27. Despite severe rain, police estimated that roughly 50,000 people waited in lines up to 18 hours to walk past the casket and pay their respects. Funeral service The funeral service was held on Wednesday, April 27, on the grounds of the Nixon Library. The service was attended by over 4,000 people, including family members, President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary, former Presidents and First Ladies George and Barbara Bush, Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, and Gerald and Betty Ford. Former Vice President Spiro Agnew also attended. A congressional delegation consisting of over one hundred members was present, and a foreign diplomatic corps of over two hundred.. International guests included Secretary General of the United Nations Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Vice Premier of the People‚Äôs Republic of China Zou Jiahua, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russia Alexander Shokhin, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Canada Lloyd Axworthy, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Edward Heath, former Prime Minister of Japan Toshiki Kaifu, and former President of Israel Chaim Herzog. The service was officiated by the Reverend Billy Graham, a friend of Richard Nixon's, who called him \\"one of the most misunderstood men, and I think he was one of the greatest men of the century.\\" Eulogies were delivered by Graham, Henry Kissinger, Senator Bob Dole, California Governor Pete Wilson and President Clinton. Dole could not hold back his tears at the end of his speech, a rare show of emotion in public for the Senator. Following the service, Nixon was laid to rest beside his wife; Pat had died on June 22, 1993. They are buried only steps away from Richard Nixon's birthplace and boyhood home. His funeral also marked the last major public appearance of former President Ronald Reagan, whose affliction with Alzheimer's disease was announced in November later that year.

His book, Topographical Description of the Province of Lower Canada was published at London in 1815 and also translated into French. It contained the sum knowledge of the territory at that time. The township of Bouchette, Quebec, was named for him. During the War of 1812 he raised and commanded the Quebec Volunteers. In 1813, he was gazetted Lt. Colonel on the Staff of Governor-General Sir George Pr√©vost. Background Born at Quebec City in 1774, he was the son of Colonel Jean- Baptiste Bouchette, a topographer, and Marie Angelique Duhamel, daughter of Captain Julien Duhamel (1723-1778), of Quebec City.A Historical Sketch In 1775, his father rescued General Guy Carleton, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in North America, by navigating him and his family along the Saint Lawrence River from Montreal, through the American lines, and up to Quebec. This bold move reversed the outcome of the Battle of Quebec (1775), and for his part Joseph's father was handsomely rewarded with nearly 6,000 acres of land and considerable military advancements by the grateful Governor, Sir John Graves Simcoe. Like his father, Joseph Bouchette's career would be marked by a tradition of loyalty and devoted service to his country.Colonel Joseph Bouchette by The Rev. Brother Alfred F.S.C., LL.D. Early career Bouchette studied art and architecture under Fran√ßois Baillairg√©. In 1790, he entered the service of his uncle Samuel Holland, the first Surveyor-General of British North America. The following year he joined his father with the Royal Navy's Provincial Marine on the Great Lakes. In 1793, while serving on Lake Ontario, he came into contact with Governor John Graves Simcoe who commissioned him to make the first survey of the York Harbour, that included making maps of the Toronto Islands. Bouchette, a member of the Royal Canadian Volunteers, remained in York for sometime assisting Augustus Jones with surveying the new provincial capital. Bouchette's proposals for fortifying York as at Quebec City were not heeded, much to his dismay after the Battle of York. In Autumn, 1793, HMS Onondaga was run aground by a young Lieutenant outside Toronto Harbour and it was feared it could not be salvaged until after winter. After it had been abandoned, Bouchette assumed command and distinguished himself by managing to get it afloat and sailing it back to Niagara-on-the-Lake. For this exploit, the twenty-year-old Bouchette was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant in May, 1794. In 1799, Bouchette was at Halifax studying military tactics under orders from the Duke of Kent, with whom he had become a friend. He returned to Quebec City in 1801 to take up in the offices (which he found in a state of great disorder) of his elderly uncle, Samuel Holland, Surveyor General of The Canadas. Bouchette reorganised the offices and Governor Robert Shore Milnes reported in 1802 that, \\"Mr. Bouchette has responded perfectly to the opinion which we had formed of him\\". Following the death of his uncle, Bouchette officially replaced him in August, 1803. Surveyor General He served during the War of 1812.Bouchette, Joseph He reviewed the territory of Lower Canada for the Government. From 1805 to 1807 he served with Charles Burton Wyatt as interim Surveyor of Upper Canada. In 1815, he published his great book Topographical Description of the province of Lower Canada, which was the sum of knowledge of the territory for that day. The book, complete with some essential maps, was published in London in English and French, and was updated in English only in 1831‚Äì1832. His regional maps and two topographical descriptions of Lower Canada are still considered an essential reference for knowledge of the territory. Bouchette returned to Montreal to become Surveyor General of Lower Canada, replacing his uncle Samuel Holland. After his death in 1841, he was entombed at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal. The Township of Bouchette in Quebec was named in his honour, as well as Bouchette Street in Torontohttp://oldtorontomaps.blogspot.ca/2013/01/1792-j-bouchette-plan-of- toronto-harbour.html Family Lady Louisa Shea in the costume worn by her when presented at court by Elliott & Fry In 1797, at Notre-Dame, Montreal, Joseph Bouchette married Ad√©la√Øde Chaboillez (1781-1847), daughter of Charles Chaboillez.

The carrying axle enabled higher speeds and the engine could even be used as a passenger train locomotive. In addition the average axle load was lower, so that these locomotives could also be used on branch lines. The conversion entailed moving the boiler forward and raising it somewhat. The vehicles were given operating numbers between 56 201 and 56 891, although the numbering was not continuous. The Deutsche Bundesbahn took over 368 of the 410 remaining engines after the Second World War and retired them by 1968. The last one was 56 241, that was to have been allocated the number 056 241-3. The East German Deutsche Reichsbahn retired their last locomotives (now called the DR Class 56.1) by the end of 1970. Numbers 56 218, 258, 317, 543 and 598 remained in Austria after the war, locomotives 56 317 and 543 retiring as early as 1953. The remaining engines formed the Austrian √ñBB Class 656.

Hopkinstown is a former coal mining industrial community and is a district in the town of Pontypridd within the Rhondda electoral ward. It is neighboured by the settlements of Pwllgwaun, Trehafod and Pantygraigwen, and also comprises the subdistricts of Troed-Rhiw-Trwyn and Gyfeillion. Early and industrial history The area where Hopkinstown is located was, as late as 1842, an undeveloped woodland known as the Ty Mawr Estate. Owned by Evan Hopkin, the area developed quickly soon after, until around 1850 it was beginning to develop into an urbanised development following the sinking of two collieries, Ty Mawr and Gyfeillion pits. Along with buildings to house the miners, Hopkinstown quickly acquired a chemical works, iron foundry and coke ovens. The original village was a single row of houses along the Rhondda Road which followed the River Rhondda, but it wasn't until the 1871 census that the name Hopkin's Town was used to describe the area. By 1891 the village had a population of over 1,500 and several streets of terraced houses had been built. Hopkinstown would see eight shafts sunk during the industrial period. John Calvert, an engineer from Yorkshire, had already sunk the Newbridge Colliery (later to become part of the Maritime Collieries, near Graig, Pontypridd), and in 1848 his money allowed the construction of the Gyfeillon Colliery. It would change hands to the Great Western Railway company before reverting to Calvert before he sold it to the Great Western Colliery Company. The company would sink six shafts in total and the pits would collectively be known as the Great Western Collieries. Two other mines in the area, not owned by the Great Western, were the Typica Pit at Troed-rhiw-trwyn, which was only open for five years between 1875 and 1879, and the Lan Colliery, the only pit in Hopkinstown south of the River Rhondda. In 1889 it was owned by William Davies of Pontypridd, employing only seven miners; the mine closed in September 1907.Rhondda Collieries, Volume 1, Number 4 in the Coalfield Series; John Cornwell. D.Brown and Sons Ltd, Cowbridge (1987) pg. 8 On Tuesday 11 April 1893 there was a fire in the Great Western Mine colliery which resulted in some 200 miners being trapped underground.

It was the first such modern fair in North America.Alan G.

The new Navy Pier buildings were cleaner and more inviting than the old ones, but the carnival atmosphere on the pier attracted an audience unused to art fairs. Robert Landau of Landau Fine Art in Montreal said of his experience in 2002, \\"we had more customers walking in off Navy Pier who really weren't there to see the art show. We had so many people coming in making remarks like, 'Are any of these paintings real?'\\" Sales decreased and major galleries pulled out.

In 2005 Art Chicago, redubbed \\"Art Chicago in the Park\\" was held in a giant tent in Grant Park behind the Art Institute of Chicago. There were now only 94 exhibitors, several of whom were new young Chicago galleries. 2006 Troubles In 2006 catastrophe struck. The fair was again planned to be in a tent in Grant Park. Construction had been visibly slow, but it was not until the evening of Tuesday, April 25‚Äîtwo days before the fair was scheduled to open‚Äîthat the news came out that Art Chicago was in trouble. There was a dispute between Blackman and the contractors, with Blackman claiming that the flooring was unacceptable and the contractors claiming bounced checks. Blackman appears to have tried to arrange quick financing, including offering to sell his business the Friday before. Embarrassingly, several international art dealers were turned away from the tent, where they had arrived to set up their exhibits. Mayor Daley, through a spokeswoman, expressed annoyance and disappointment. An attempt to quickly reorganize the fair on Navy Pier fell through. On Thursday, April 27, it was announced that Art Chicago would take place on the eighth floor of the Merchandise Mart, sharing it with the \\"Chicago Antiques Fair\\" which was already scheduled.Misha Davenport, \\"On With the Art Show -- At the Mart\\", Chicago Sun-Times, Thursday, April 27, 2006, p. 8 Although makeshift, the fair was professionally handled, and although many exhibitors expressed concern, only three out of 104 dealers dropped out.

He had breathed a musical atmosphere from his youth, and finally decided to devote himself wholly to its pursuit. The Emperor of Austria became interested in him, as did von B√ºlow, Wagner, Liszt, Offenbach and Strauss. In 1843 his first opera, Hamlet, was produced at Brunn. He played the violin in orchestras in both Germany and England. He then travelled through Germany, France, and England, as an orchestral conductor, and in 1844 settled in London as assistant to Michael William Balfe at Her Majesty's Theatre. American career Coming to the United States in 1848, he became musical director at Edward P. Fry's Astor Opera House. In 1849 he began his career as an impresario at the same house with an opera company of his own, the Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company (sometimes referred to later as the Academy of Music Opera), which included most of Fry's artists. Between 1848 and 1850, he produced L'Elisir d'Amore, Il Barbiere di Siviglia, I Puritani, Belisario, Ernani, Otello, Maria di Rohan, Don Pasquale, and Der Freisch√ºtz. In the 1850s Maretzek began to tour with his company throughout the United States, but was primarily active in New York City and Philadelphia. During the summer of 1850 Maretzek produced opera in Castle Garden Theatre, New York, producing Verdi's Luisa Miller for the first time in America. The Academy of Music was opened in 1854 with Giulia Grisi and Giuseppe Mario under Maretzek and his company. In 1855, Il Trovatore was produced by him, also for the first time in America, with Pasquale Brignoli as Manrico. He suffered a temporary setback with the arrival of Jenny Lind to America, as he lost audiences to her concerts. In 1856 Maretzek started an opposition to Niblo's Garden, with Clara Louise Kellogg. Adelaide Phillips, Pasquale Brignoli, and others. The competition was strong and neither side prospered. Although Maretzek brought out Giorgio Ronconi, one of the greatest baritones, he was driven to Philadelphia. In 1857 his company performed Il trovatore for the inauguration of the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. In 1860 he returned to the Astor Place Opera House, and worked at Niblo's Garden in New York, the Crosby's Opera House in Chicago, and in Mexico and Havana. For a period in the late 1860s he managed the American career of newly arrived Czech actress Fanny Janauschek who early in her career spoke no English. In 1889, his golden jubilee as opera director was held. The celebration was attended by such notables as Theodore Thomas, Anton Seidl, Frank van der Stucken, Adolf Neuendorff and Walter Damrosch. Maretzek has been described as being possessed of a violent personality, dictatorial and intransigent, and was frequently in disagreement with members of his company and with critics. As a composer, he wrote two operas, Hamlet in 1843 and Sleepy Hollow in 1879. The first was produced in Germany, the second in the United States. He also wrote two volumes of memoirs, Crotchets and Quavers (1855)Max Maretzek (1855) Crotchets and quavers: or, Revelations of an opera manager in America, Samuel French, New York (Digitized by Google Books) and Sharps and Flats (1890).Max Maretzek (1890) (copyright 1889) Sharps and flats, American Musician Publishing Co., New York (Digitized by Google Books) He died in Pleasant Plains, Staten Island, New York in 1897.

During 2004, he played with the Gulf Coast League Phillies instructional league team, where he ended the season with a seven- game hitting streak. In 38 games, Marson amassed a total of 29 hits, including three doubles and four home runs, for a batting average of .257. He also stole four bases.

After the season, the Phillies' farm system director, Steve Noworyta, said that Marson \\"continues, like fine wine, to get better as he ages.\\" His stock as a Baseball America prospect rose from eighth in the system to third, and he was named one of the top 50 prospects in Major League Baseball. Marson and Reading teammate Jason Donald were selected to the United States national baseball team for the 2008 Olympics, where they won the bronze medal. National team manager Davey Johnson said that \\"[he] really impressed me during (the Futures Game)‚Ä¶ He caught the first three innings. We don't give the signs to the catcher. He told (pitcher) Brett Anderson to throw over to first and he picked (a runner off).

The statue was designed by Mochamad Syailillah, who is better known as Bolil. The statue was officially unveiled by Suharto in 1996 as gift from the Indonesian government to the people of Timor Timur, the then Indonesian province. The statue is one of the main tourist attractions in East Timor. The statue, and the globe on which it rests, are situated at the end of the Fatucama peninsula, facing out to the ocean and can be reached by climbing some 597 steps.Cox, Christopher, Tourism in Timor? Travel & Leisure, March 2004  History  Statue location The idea of raising the Cristo Rei statue was proposed by the East Timor governor Jos√© Ab√≠lio Os√≥rio Soares to President Suharto. It was intended as a present for the 20th anniversary of East Timor's integration into Indonesia. Suharto appointed the director of national airline Garuda Indonesia to lead the project. Garuda was given the responsibility to find capital for funding the project, and raised 1.1 billion rupiah (US$123,000). However, that was not sufficient to erect the statue, and contributions from East Timorese civil servants and businessmen were needed to complete the project, which eventually cost more than 5 billion rupiah (US$559,000). It took almost a year of working to create the body of the statue, which was fabricated by 30 workers in Sukaraja, Bandung. It was made of 27 separate copper sections, which were then loaded onto three trailers and shipped to Dili. Reconstruction of the statue, including the globe and a 10-meter-high cross, took three months. It was unveiled on 15 October 1996. Roman Catholic bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo, together with President Suharto and East Timor Governor Jos√© Ab√≠lio Os√≥rio Soares, directly witnessed the revelation of this statue from the air using a helicopter.  Symbolism  The monument (statue, globe and pedestal) is 27 meters high, a reference to the integration of East Timor as the 27th province of Indonesia. The statue and globe are 17 meters high, an allusion to Indonesian Independence Day (17 August 1945). The statue is oriented towards the west, which some believed as the direction of Jakarta.

The Island Yacht Club is a yacht club in Toronto, Ontario Canada. The club is located on of land on Mugg's Island, one of the islands in the Toronto Islands. The club is accessible from April to October using the club's private boat from downtown. The club has its own marina providing docking and marine services to members. Facilities Facilities provided by the club include a clubhouse, tennis courts, nature trail and pool. Social activities include holiday buffets and barbecues, sailing lessons and camps, family and children's activities, and boating events including: cruises, sailpasts and sailboat racing. Dockage is available for both power and sailboats. The clubhouse incorporates a dining room, bar, lounge, locker rooms and a children's club annex. The east side of Mugg's Island is a bird sanctuary. The clubhouse was designed for \\"people who would rather be outside\\" by Montgomery Sisam Architects in 2006.http://www.montgomerysisam.com/projects/island-yacht-club Island Yacht Club clubhouse by Montgomery Sisam Architects It won the Ontario Association of Architects Design of Excellence. This clubhouse was built to replace the original clubhouse, which burned down in June 2004. History The Island Yacht Club was founded in 1951 by a small group of Jewish sailing enthusiasts. According to an article by Pierre Berton published in Maclean‚Äôs Magazine on November 1, 1948: \\"Segregation by race at which Canadians are apt to look askance when it is practiced in the southern United States, is just as strong in the Canadian social world as it is in the economic world. There are golf clubs which make no bones about the fact that they won‚Äôt accept Jewish members, college fraternities and sororities, which exclude Jewish students. Members of these clubs have argued that in private, social organizations they should be allowed to choose the people they associate with.\\" It was in this social climate that Carl Keyfetz was retained in the spring of 1951 to obtain a Provincial Charter for a Social Club to be located on Mugg‚Äôs Island that would be dedicated to the promotion of \\"yachting, badminton, squash, tennis, bowling, skating, swimming, curling and other games of sport and to arrange matches and competitions of every nature and to offer or grant and contribute towards prizes awards and distinctions\\". Clubhouse Lounge A lease for a parcel of land on Muggs Island ‚Äì deep by along the water ‚Äì was negotiated with the City of Toronto government. On October 16, 1951 an organizing meeting was held at the home of Cecil Yolles with Jack and Estelle Morris, Bill Ackerman, Bob Singer, Dick Lorie, Bert Jacobs, Mel Gould, Eon Gilmore, Norm Kirzner, Leo Perkel, Dr. S. Leibel, Cecil Yolles, Denny Yolles, Dr. Bernard \\"Bunny\\" Willinsky, John Bussin, Joe Kitz, Barney Alper, Ben Dunkelman, Irving Gould and Mark Speyer in attendance. The first directors were John Bliss, salesman; Irving and Malville Gould, managers and Carl Keyfetz, solicitor. Only qualified and proven sailors were to be allowed to fly the IYC burgee. Training was mandatory. A Disciplinary Committee was established under the chairmanship of the Sailing Master with power to penalize, fine or expel members who did not conform with government regulations or any regulations that the club might, from time to time, see fit to pass. With Johnny Bussin responsible for seamanship instruction, Bunny Willinsky sharing his knowledge of boat handling and safety at sea and Irving Gould in charge of navigation and chart work, all members were expected to become qualified skippers so that they would not injure themselves or embarrass the rest of the members or the club. In addition to \\"fostering sportsmanship and seamanship among Jewish youth and its members\\", the club was to provide \\"social facilities to all visiting yachtsmen\\" and to \\"foster a better understanding between Jewish and Gentile yachtsmen\\". The first Commodore of the Island Yacht Club and a major force for the growth of the club was Dr. Bunny Willinsky. Membership peaked at 350 in the 1970s and has steadily dropped since then. The fundamental issue of whether or not it was to be an exclusively \\"Jewish yacht club\\" was addressed and decided quickly. Notwithstanding the way that others had treated them, the answer from the founders was a principled and emphatic \\"no\\". At a meeting on February 4, 1952 \\"upon motion regularly made and seconded, it was unanimously decided that all applications for membership from persons of other than the Jewish faith would be given the same consideration as all other applications.\\" This was a first for private clubs in Toronto and a policy that continues to this day. The clubhouse was built in 2006 to replace the original clubhouse, which burned down in June 2004. The original clubhouse housed the formal dining room, bar, cafeteria style snack bar, where Friday nights were movie night; men's and ladies' locker rooms with saunas and lounges, the Junior Club where young sailors and children of members could relax with their peers and the Sailor's Lounge where you could often find members playing cards or relaxing, either inside the lounge, or outside on the deck. Although some of these activities have been discontinued (e.g., movie night) there is an active youth program that helps cement the club as a family-oriented facility. Other adult activities include Weekday Mah Jong, tennis tournaments, adult sail, canoeing and kayaking. Organized social activities including sailboat racing.

In August 1866, the G&A; officially consolidated with the Dalton and Jacksonville Railroad and the Alabama and Tennessee River Railroad Company with the intent to create a consolidated rail system from Selma, AL to Dalton, GA. The consolidated corporation was to do business under the name of the latter, but it officially took the name Selma, Rome and Dalton Railroad Company in December of that same year. Still, in some cases, business continued under the name of Georgia and Alabama Railroad. For instance, in May 1868, a contract was executed to the Georgia and Alabama Railroad, leasing 100 African American convicts in the state of Georgia to work for the railroad company without pay. The Georgia and Alabama Railroad is not to be confused with the Georgia and Alabama Railway, which was a different entity entirely, formed in 1895 and based in Savannah. However, due to the similarity in their names, the G&A; Railway was often referred to as the G&A; Railroad until it became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railway ca. 1900. In 1989, the next iteration of the Georgia and Alabama Railroad was formed as a shortline railroad operating between Smithville, Georgia and White Oak, Alabama, . RailTex consolidated its holdings in the area into the Georgia Southwestern in 1995, and the Georgia & Alabama ceased to operate under that name. The rail system, however, is still in use by the Georgia Southwestern Railroad. History The Southwestern Railroad originally constructed the line west out of Smithville towards the Alabama state line, completing the railroad in 1860. The Southwestern was leased to the Central of Georgia in 1869 and completely integrated into the system in 1954. The remainder of the line into Alabama was constructed by the Vicksburg & Brunswick from Eufaula to Clayton, Alabama, and became part of the Central of Georgia. An extension to Ozark was later built, however, it was abandoned in 1977. Eventually the Central of Georgia was acquired by the Southern, and later became part of Norfolk Southern. The line was cut back to White Oak February 28, 1986. The Georgia & Alabama railroad began operation on June 1, 1989 under the Thoroughbred Shortline Program between Smithville and White Oak. Freight included peanuts, aggregates, pulpwood, and cement, which generated approximately 3,300 annual carloads for the line in 1995. Interchange was made with Norfolk Southern at Smithville, CSX Transportation at Dawson until 1990, and fellow RailTex subsidiary Georgia Southwestern at Cuthbert. After 1990, the railroad interchanged with the Georgia Great Southern at Dawson. The Georgia & Alabama no longer existed in name after the division was merged into the Georgia Southwestern division of Railtex in 1995.

It is one of over 200 Coptic Orthodox Churches in the US.  History  St. Mary's Coptic Orthodox Church of Los Angeles was founded as the second Coptic parish in Los Angeles, and was incorporated by 1974 with about 50 families at the time. The Coptic population of Los Angeles had been growing since the late 1960s, when Father Bishoy Kamel was commissioned to serve the neighboring Church of St. Mark in 1969, during Pope Cyril VI's papacy. Fr. Bishoy was a prominent Copt, being considered a modern-day saint within the Church, having helped found St. Mark's as well as several other parishes and buildings throughout Egypt, the United States, Europe, and Australia.  Expansion  St. Mary's Church, on the other hand, was founded in the Highland Park community within the City of Los Angeles, near Pasadena. In November 1989, a new Coptic-designed church that had replaced the original church building was consecrated by Pope Shenouda III, making it the first church in California that was built in the Coptic style. Dr. Isaac Fanous, a Coptic iconographer, eagerly completed the treasury of icons that were inside of the church in September 1996. An additional church, chapel bearing the name of St. Bishoy, was completed in January 2004 in the lower-level of the building, built specifically for serving the English- speaking congregation.  Priests  From the time of its establishment in 1974, St. Mary's Church was served by Hegomen (Archpriest) Fr. Antonious Henein until his repose in 2006. The church is currently served by Fr. Mina Youssef, who began serving the church in 1995 and was ordained to the priestly rank of Hegomen in December 2006; together with Fr. James Soliman, who was ordained to the priesthood in November 2003.  Services & activities  The church offers many services for its continuously growing congregation. Arabic, Coptic, English, and Spanish classes are offered for those who would like to learn as well as Pre-Servants class which is offered on Saturday nights after vespers to help prepare the high school and college youth on their journey to become a Sunday school servant or a servant of the church. The church also plans many activities for the youth and the adults to attend, such as an annual dinner cruise, a 3-day family retreat, an annual youth trip, and many monastery and service trips. There are also many volunteer opportunities for the youth at the church, like serving at the annual Halloween festival and the Kids Camp.  Today  Several years after St. Mary's Church was incorporated, in 1995, the Coptic Orthodox Diocese of Los Angeles, Southern California and Hawaii was founded. Pope Tawadros II , who is the current Pope of Alexandria, enthroned Serapion as Bishop for the diocese, which includes St. Mary's Church as well as several other diocesan churches. Two services of the Divine Liturgy are celebrated on Sunday mornings: one for the Arabic-speaking congregation in the main church on the upper-level of the building; and the other for the English-speaking congregation in Saint Bishoy Church located on the lower- level. There are currently almost 800 Coptic families served by St. Mary's Church alone, with several others belonging to various church congregations throughout California.

Hains later used the pen name Mayn Clew Garnett. Hains' father was General Peter Conover Hains, a prestigious engineering officer who participated in the draining of the Washington Tidal Basin and the construction of the Panama Canal. Hains' maternal grandfather, Admiral Thornton A. Jenkins, served in the War of 1812. The Admiral's logbooks served as the inspiration for Hains' novel, The Cruise of the Petrel (1901). The Hains-Annis Case, or the \\"Regatta Murder\\", concerned the killing of William Annis by Hains' brother, Peter C. Hains, in Bayside, Queens on August 15, 1908. Peter Hains was a friend of Annis, who was advertising manager for The Burr McIntosh Monthly T.J. Hains informed Peter that Peter's wife was having an affair with Annis, and he later accompanied Peter to the victim's yacht club on the afternoon of the ladies' regatta. As Annis finished a race he had won, Peter emptied a pistol magazine of eight shots into Annis' body, in front of Annis' wife and two sons, while T.J. stood guard, his own pistol drawn. The defense of the Hains brothers was funded by their father. T.J. was tried as an accomplice (December 1908 to January 1909), pleaded temporary insanity, and acquitted of manslaughter, but the case tarnished his reputation. (Peter was tried in April‚ÄìMay 1909 and convicted of manslaughter. He was pardoned by the governor of New York in 1911.) The crime played an important role in the development of criminal and matrimonial law.Appel, Jacob M. \\"Murder at the Regatta\\" in The New York Times, August 10, 2008 The case became front-page news across the nation at the time and ranks with the trials of Josephine Terranova, Harry Kendall Thaw, and Richard Bruno Hauptmann as among the most widely watched and reported American criminal trials of the first half of the twentieth century. Hains published twelve books under his own name from 1894-1908. \\"The White Ghost of Disaster\\" was published in a collection under the name Captain Mayn Clew Garnett in 1912. Hains was a frequent contributor to the 1920s pulp magazine Sea Stories, primarily under his real name, but also under Garnett. His writing career seems to end about 1930. After the trials, Hains' work no longer appeared in the higher-class magazines, and he wrote under the pen name \\"Mayn Clew Garnett\\". He achieved pseudonymous fame when his short story \\"The White Ghost of Disaster\\" (The Popular Magazine, May 1, 1912), about an ocean liner that strikes an iceberg in the Atlantic and sinks, was on the newsstands when the RMS Titanic sank. Many people attributed to him the gift of foresight, while being unaware of his true identity. Thornton Jenkins Hains died August 19, 1953.

Apart from the foundation, Malhotra promotes a non- western view on Indic cultures, mainly Hinduism. Malhotra has written prolifically in opposition to the academic study of Indian culture and society originating in Europe and the United States, especially the study of Hinduism as it is conducted by scholars and university faculty of the West, which he maintains denigrates the tradition and undermines the interests of India \\"by encouraging the paradigms that oppose its unity and integrity\\". Biography Malhotra studied physics at St. Stephen's College, Delhi and computer science at Syracuse University before becoming an entrepreneur in the information technology and media industries. He took early retirement in 1994 at an age of 44, to establish the Infinity Foundation at Princeton, New Jersey in 1995. Besides directing that foundation, he also chairs the board of governors of the Center for Indic Studies at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, and advises various organisations. Malhotra had been a speaker at an international conference held over the Center for Indic Studies, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth and was a board member of the Foundation for Indic Philosophy and Culture at the Claremont Colleges. He also wrote extensively on internet discussion groups and e-magazines. In October 2018, Malhotra was appointed as honorary visiting professor at the Centre for Media Studies at Jawharlal Nehru University, Delhi. On 6 November 2018, he delivered his first lecture organized by the School of Sanskrit and Indic studies on the topic of Sanskrit non-translateables.  Infinity Foundation  Malhotra founded the institute in 1995; followed by Educational Council of Indic Traditions (ECIT) in 2000. The foundation works without any full time workers; sans Malhotra himself. The stated goals were to fight a perceived misrepresentation of ancient Indian religions and to document the contributions of India to world civilization. None of the members of the advisory board was an academic and most belonged to the software industry. The Foundation has given more than 400 grants for research, education and community work and has provided small grants to major universities in support of programs including a visiting professorship in Indic studies at Harvard University, Yoga and Hindi classes at Rutgers University, the research and teaching of non-dualistic philosophies at University of Hawaii, Global Renaissance Institute and a Center for Buddhist studies at Columbia University, a program in religion and science at University of California, an endowment for the Center for Advanced Study of India at University of Pennsylvania, and lectures at the Center for Consciousness Studies at University of Arizona. The foundation has provided funding for journals like Education about Asia and International Journal of Hindu Studies and for the establishment of the Mahatma Gandhi Center for Global Non-violence at James Madison University. While the foundation's own materials describe its purposes in terms of education and philanthropy, scholars of Hinduism and South Asia see it largely as an organization committed to the \\"surveillance of the Academy,\\" and a senior U.S. scholar of Hinduism, Columbia University's Dr. Jack Hawley, has published a refutation of the foundation's characteristic charges against the study of Hinduism in North America.  Criticism of American academia (2000s) =Wendy's Child Syndrome= In early 2000s Malhotra started writing articles criticising Wendy Doniger and related scholars, claiming that she applied Freudian psycho- analysis to aspects of Indian culture.Amy M. Braverman (2004), The interpretation of gods. Do leading religious scholars err in their analysis of Hindu texts? The University of Chicago Magazine His 2002 blog titled Wendy's Child SyndromeRajiv Malhotra (2002), RISA Lila ‚Äì 1: Wendy's Child Syndrome was considered as the starting point of a \\"rift between some Western Hinduism scholars [...] and some conservative Hindus in India, the United States, and elsewhere\\". Martha Nussbaum has called it a \\"war\\" by \\"the Hindu right\\" against American scholars. The blog \\"has become a pivotal treatise in a recent rift between some Western Hinduism scholars‚Äîmany of whom teach or have studied at Chicago‚Äîand some conservative Hindus in India, the United States, and elsewhere.\\" Malhotra concluded in his blog: \\"Rights of individual scholars must be balanced against rights of cultures and communities they portray, especially minorities that often face intimidation. Scholars should criticize but not define another's religion.\\" According to Braverman, \\"Though Malhotra's academic targets say he has some valid discussion points, they also argue that his rhetoric taps into the rightward trend and attempts to silence unorthodox, especially Western, views.\\" The essay, together with a series of related essays and interviews, has been republished in Academic Hinduphobia, in the wake of the withdrawal of Doniger's The Hindus: An Alternative History from the Indian market, due to a lawsuit \\"alleging that it was biased and insulting to Hindus.\\"rajivmalhotra.com, Academic Hinduphobia The withdrawal led to extensive media attention, and renewed sales in India. According to Malhotra \\"the drama has diverted attention away from the substantive errors in her scholarship to be really about being an issue of censorship by radical Hindus,\\" hence the republication of his critique of Wendy Doniger and scholars related to her. =American academia= In his 2003 blog Does South Asian Studies Undermine India? at Rediff India Abroad: India as it happens, Malhotra criticises what he views as uncritical funding of South Asian Studies by Indian-American donors.Rajiv Malhotra (2003), Does South Asian Studies Undermine India? According to Malhotra: Malhotra voices four criticisms of American academia: # \\"American academia is dominated by a Eurocentric perspective that views western culture as being the font of world civilisation and refuses to acknowledge the contributions of non-western societies such as India to European culture and technique\\". # The academic study of religion in the United States is based on the model of the \\"Abrahamic\\" traditions; this model is not applicable to Hinduism. # Western scholars focus on the \\"sensationalist, negative attributes of religion and present it in a demeaning way that shows a lack of respect for the sentiments of the practitioners of the religion\\". # South Asian Studies programmes in the United States create \\"a false identity and unity\\" between India and its Muslim neighbour states, and undermine India \\"by focusing on its internal cleavages and problems\\". Malhotra argues that American scholarship has undermined India \\"by encouraging the paradigms that oppose its unity and integrity\\", with scholars playing critical roles, often under the garb of 'human rights' in channelling foreign intellectual and material support to exacerbate India's internal cleavages. According to Malhotra, Indian-American donors were \\"hoodwinked\\" into thinking that they were supporting India through their monetary contributions to such programmes. Malhotra compares the defence of Indian interests with corporate brand management, distrusting the loyalties of Indian scholars: According to Malhotra, a positive stance on India has been under-represented in American academia, due to programmes being staffed by Westerners, their \\"Indian- American Sepoys\\" and Indian Americans wanting to be white ‚Äî whom he disparages as \\"career opportunists\\" and \\"Uncle Toms\\" who \\"in their desire to become even marginal members of the Western Grand Narrative sneer at Indian culture in the same manner as colonialists once did.\\" Malhotra has accused academia of abetting the \\"Talibanisation\\" of India, which would also lead to the radicalisation of other Asian countries. =U-turn theory= According to Malhotra, the Western appropriation of Indic ideas and knowledge systems has a long history. According to Malhotra, in what he calls \\"the U-Turn Theory\\", the appropriation occurs in several stages:\\"Are Indians buying back their own ideas from the West?\\" lecture at IIT Mumbai, 1 April 2013 Lecture on U-Turn Theory: How the West Appropriates Indian Culture at Lady Sri Ram College, Delhi, 26 August 2006 # In the first stage, a Westerner approaches an Indian guru or tradition with extreme deference, and acquires the knowledge as a sincere disciple. # Once the transfer of knowledge is complete, the former disciple, or/and his/her followers progressively erase all traces of the original source, repackage the ideas as their own thought, and may even proceed to denigrate the source tradition. # In the final stage, the ideas are exported back to India by the former disciple and/or his followers for consumption. Malhotra cites numerous examples to support this theory, dating from the erasure of Upanishadic and Vijnanavada Buddhist influences on Plotinus to the modern day reimportation of Christian yoga into India. Another example is William James and his The Varieties of Religious Experience (1902), Aldous Huxley and his The Perennial Philosophy (1945), and the works of Ken Wilber, all of which he claims to have been influenced by Vivekananda. Malhotra questions why his influence remains unacknowledged and uncredited in much Western thought. Academic Hinduphobia: A Critique of Wendy Doniger's Erotic School of Indology (early 2000s/2016) Several of Malhotra's essays from the early 2000s were re-published by Voice of India in 2016 in Academic Hinduphobia: A Critique of Wendy Doniger's Erotic School of Indology.rajivmalhotra.com, Academic Hinduphobia According to Malhotra, the essays have been republished in the wake of the withdrawal of Doniger's The Hindus: An Alternative History from the Indian market, due to a lawsuit \\"alleging that it was biased and insulting to Hindus.\\" The withdrawal led to extensive media attention, and renewed sales in India. According to Malhotra \\"the drama has diverted attention away from the substantive errors in her scholarship to be really about being an issue of censorship by radical Hindus,\\" hence the republication of his critique of Wendy Doniger and scholars related to her. Breaking India (2011) Malhotra's book Breaking India: Western Interventions in Dravidian and Dalit Faultlines discusses three faultlines trying to destabilise India: # Islamic radicalism linked with Pakistan. # Maoists and Marxist radicals supported by China via intermediaries such as Nepal. # Dravidian and Dalit identity separatism being fostered by the West in the name of human rights. This book goes into greater depth on the third: the role of US and European churches, academics, think-tanks, foundations, government and human rights groups in fostering separation of the identities of Dravidian and Dalit communities from the rest of India.Rajiv Malhotra (2011), Breaking India: Western Interventions in Dravidian and Dalit Faultlines\\" According to Malhotra: Being Different (2011) Being Different is a critique of the western-centric view on India, characterised by the Abrahamic traditions. Malhotra intends to give an Indian view on India and the west, as characterised by the Indian Dharmic traditions. Malhotra argues that there are irreconcilable differences between Dharmic traditions and Abrahamic religions. The term dharma: According to Malhotra, Abrahamic religions are history-centric in that their fundamental beliefs are sourced from history ‚Äì that God revealed his message through a special prophet and that the message is secured in scriptures. This special access to God is available only to these intermediaries or prophets and not to any other human beings. History-centric Abrahamic religions claim that we can resolve the human condition only by following the lineage of prophets arising from the Middle East. All other teachings and practices are required to get reconciled with this special and peculiar history. By contrast, the dharmic traditions‚ÄîHinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism‚Äîdo not rely on history in the same absolutist and exclusive way. According to Malhotra, Dharmic traditions claim an endless stream of enlightened living spiritual masters, each said to have realised the ultimate truth while alive on this earth, and hence, able to teach this truth to others. Unlike in the case of Dharmic traditions, the great teachers of Abrahamic traditions are not living models of embodied enlightenment. Instead, Abrahamic teachers proclaim the truth based on historical texts. The consequences of these divergent systems are at the heart of Dharmic-Abrahamic distinctions. Dharmic flexibility has made fundamental pluralism possible, which cannot occur within the constraints of historicentrism. According to Malhotra, both Western and Dharmic civilisations have cherished unity as an ideal, but with a different emphasis. Malhotra posits a distinction between a \\"synthetic unity\\" that gave rise to a static intellectual worldview in the west, positioning itself as universal, and an \\"integral unity\\" that gave rise to a dynamic worldview based on the notion of Dharma. While the former is characterised by a top-down essentialism embracing everything a priori, the latter is said to be a bottom-up approach acknowledging the dependent co-origination of alternative views of the human and the divine, the body and the mind, and the self and society. Indra's Net (2014) Indra's Net is an appeal against the thesis of neo-Hinduism and a defense of Vivekananda's view of Yoga and Vedanta. The book argues for a unity, coherence, and continuity of the Yogic and Vedantic traditions of Hinduism and Hindu philosophy. It makes proposals for defending Hinduism from what the author considers to be unjust attacks from scholars, misguided public intellectuals, and hostile religious polemicists. The book's central metaphor is \\"Indra's Net\\". As a scriptural image \\"Indra's Net\\" was first mentioned in the Atharva Veda (c. 1000 BCE). In Buddhist philosophy, Indra's Net served as a metaphor in the Avatamsaka Sutra and was further developed by Huayen Buddhism to portray the interconnectedness of everything in the universe. Malhotra employs the metaphor of Indra's Net to express The book uses Indra's Net as a metaphor for the understanding of the universe as a web of connections and interdependences, an understanding which Malhotra wants to revive as the foundation for Vedic cosmology, a perspective that he asserts has \\"always been implicit\\" in the outlook of the ordinary Hindu. A revised edition was published in 2016, after charges of plagiarism. The revised edition omits most references to the work of Andrew J. Nicholson but rather refers original Sanskrit sources instead which according to Malhotra, Nicholson failed to attribute his ideas to and explains that the unity of Hinduism is inherent in the tradition from the times of its Vedic origins.Revised chapter 8 The Battle for Sanskrit (2016) The Battle for Sanskrit is a critique of the American indologist Sheldon Pollock. Malhotra pleads for traditional Indian scholars to write responses to Pollock's views, who takes a critical stance toward the role of Sanskrit in traditional views on Indian society. Malhotra is critical of Pollock's approach, and argues that western Indology scholars are deliberately intervening in Indian societies by offering analyses of Sanskrit texts which would be rejected by \\"the traditional Indian experts.\\" He also finds western scholars too prescriptive, that is, being \\"political activists\\" that want to prescribe a specific way of life. The inducement for this book was the prospect of Sringeri Peetham, the monastery founded by Adi Shankara in southern India, collaborating with Columbia University to set up an \\"Adi Shankara Chair\\" for Hindu religion and philosophy, sponsored by an Indian donor. The instalment committee for the chair was to be headed by Sheldon Pollock, whom Malhotra regards as an erudite scholar but also as one who undermines the traditional understanding. Malhotra contacted the lead donor to voice his concerns, which were not shared by the donor. Nevertheless, Malhotra fears \\"the issue of potential conflict when the occupant of the chair takes positions that undermine the very tradition that has backed and funded the chair.\\" According to Malhotra, The \`network of trust' created by the book is said to have caused 132 academics from India to sign a petition asking for the removal of Sheldon Pollock from the editorship of the Murty Classical Library of India.Nikita Puri, Murty Classical Library: Project interrupted, Business Standard, 12 March 2016. See also the full input of Rajiv Malhotra to the journalist. Reception Appreciation Scholars have widely recognized that Malhotra has been influential in sparking widespread dissatisfaction with the Western world's scholarly study of Hinduism. John Hinnells, a British scholar of comparative religions, considers Malhotra to lead a faction of Hindu criticism of methodology for the examination of Hinduism. Other scholars welcome his attempt to challenge the western assumptions in the study of India and South Asia but also question his approach, finding it to be neglecting the differences within the various Indian traditions. In response, Malhotra points out that he does not state that all those traditions are essentially the same, that there is no effort to homogenise different Dharmic traditions, but that they share the assertion of integral unity. Prema A. Kurien considers Malhotra to be at \\"the forefront of American Hindu effort to challenge the Eurocentricism in the academia.\\" Criticism Martha Nussbaum criticises Malhotra for \\"disregard for the usual canons of argument and scholarship, a postmodern power play in the guise of defense of tradition.\\". Brian K. Pennington has called his work \\"ahistorical\\" and \\"a pastiche of widely accepted and overly simplified conclusions borrowed from the academy.\\" Pennington has further charged that Malhotra systematically misrepresents the relationship between Hinduism and Christianity, arguing that in Malhotra's hands, \\"Christian and Indic traditions are reduced to mere cartoons of themselves.\\" According to Jonathan Edelmann, one of the major problems with Malhotra's work is that he does not have a school of thought that he represents or is trained in. This fact undermines his claims to be engaged in purvapaksa debate. Purvapaksa debate requires location in a particular place of argument. In May 2015, St. Olaf College Hindu-American scholar Anantanand Rambachan, who studied three years with Swami Dayananda, published an extensive response to Malhotra's criticisms in Indra's Net charging that Malhotra's \\"descriptions of my scholarship belong appropriately to the realm of fiction and are disconnected from reality.\\" According to Rambachan, Malhotra's understanding and representation of classical Advaita is incorrect, attributing doctrines to Shankara and Swami Dayananda which are rejected by them.\\"Untangling the False Knots in Rajiv Malhotra's 'Indra's Net,' Swarajya magazine Malhotra's epistemological foundations have also been critically questioned by Anantanand Rambachan. He does not, according to Rambachan, situate his discussion in relation to classical epistemologies or clarify his differences with these. Allegations of plagiarism In July 2015, Richard Fox Young of Princeton Theological Seminary and Andrew J.Nicholson who authored Unifying Hinduism, alleged Malhotra had plagiarized Unifying Hinduism in Indra's Net. Nicholson further said that Malhotra not only had plagiarised his book, but also \\" twists the words and arguments of respectable scholars to suit his own ends.\\" Permanent Black, publisher of Nicholson's Unifying Hinduism, stated that they would welcome HarperCollins' \\"willingness to rectify future editions\\" of Indra's Net.Unifying Hinduism: Statements from the Author and from the Publisher In response to Nicholson, Malhotra stated \\"I used your work with explicit references 30 times in Indra's Net, hence there was no ill-intention,\\" and cited a list of these references.Swarajya magazine, Nicholson's Untruths He announced that he would be eliminating all references to Nicholson and further explained:According to Malhotra, he removed all references of Nicholson in chapter 8 of Indra's Net, replacing them with references to the original Indian sources.

Early history The first inhabitants to leave traces in the area later known as Chuvashia were of the Finno-Ugric Comb Ceramic Culture. Later, people of the Indo-European Battle Axe Culture moved into the area and established several villages. These two peoples assimilated to become the Hillfort Culture of the Middle Volga Area. They had strong economic and linguistic ties with southern steppe peoples like the Scythians and Sarmatians. The ancestors of the Chuvash were Turkic Bulgars and Suars (Sabirs) residing in the Northern Caucasus in the 5th to 8th centuries (after having been driven from the Pannonian Basin following the death of their greatest leader, Attila). In the 7th and 8th centuries, a part of the Bulgars left for the Balkans, where, together with local Slavs, they established the state of modern Bulgaria. Another part moved to the Middle Volga Region (see Volga Bulgaria), where the Bulgar population that did not adopt Islam formed part of the ethnic foundation of the Chuvash people. During the Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria, the steppe-dwelling Suar migrated north, where Volga Finnic tribes, such as the Mordvins and Mari lived. The Chuvash claim to be descendants of these Suars who assimilated with the Mari. They became vassals of the Golden Horde in 1242, after a bloody uprising which the Mongols brutally suppressed with an army of 40,000 warriors. Later Mongol and Tatar rulers did not intervene in local internal affairs as long as the annual tribute was paid to Sarai. The Tokhtamysh‚ÄìTimur war (1361‚Äì1395) devastated 80% of the Suar people. When the power of the Golden Horde began to diminish, the local Mi≈ü√§r Tatar Murzas from Pyana and Temnikov tried to rule the Chuvash area. Russian Empire During Ivan the Terrible's war of conquest against the Khanate of Kazan, in August 1552, the Chuvash Orsai and Mari Akpar Tokari princes swore their loyalty to the Grand Duchy of Muscovy at Alatyr on the Sura River. This ended nearly 120 years under the rule of the Khanate of Kazan. In return, Ivan promised to honor all historic land rights of the Chuvash and Maris on both sides of the Volga River from the Kerzhenets to the Sviyaga River. In addition, Ivan ordered a five-year period freedom from tribute for the Chuvash and Mari leaders. The Chuvash provided 15,000 soldiers and the Mari 10,000 to Ivan's army for the final attack against Kazan, giving the Muscovites a force of 100,000 against the Khanate's 30,000 Nogai Tatars defending the fortified city. Disappointed by Russian rule, a portion of the Chuvash population rebelled and joined with the Mari during the Kazan War of 1552‚Äì1594. During the Time of Troubles, they joined the troops of the False Dmitri. Within the Russian Empire, the territory of modern Chuvashia was divided into two administrative districts: the northern part under the Kazan Governorate and the southern part under the Simbirsk Governorate. The border ran roughly from Kurmish to Buinsk. The Chuvash and Mari joined the Stenka Razin and Pugachev rebellions in 1667‚Äì1671 and 1773‚Äì1775 respectively, when the Volga area from Astrakhan to Nizhni Novgorod was in open revolt. During these years, many Chuvash escaped east to the southern Urals. Church in Cheboksary Between 1650 and 1850, the Russian Orthodox Church sent Chuvash- speaking missionaries to try to convert the Chuvash to the Orthodox faith. A group of these missionaries created a written Chuvash language. The first Chuvash grammar was published in 1769. Chuvash had earlier been written with a Runic script or the Arabic alphabet. A revised Cyrillic alphabet for Chuvash was first introduced in 1873 by Ivan Yakovlevich Yakovlev. The Latin alphabet has been used as well, though there is no standard transcription. Most of the Chuvash who stayed in the area became Orthodox Christians, but some remained pagan. A number of Russian noble families received large estates in the Chuvash lands as reward for their services to the Tsar. The formerly independent landowning Chuvash peasants became serfs to rich Russian landowners. Russian became the official language. Few attempts were made to provide primary education in the Chuvash language, and all higher education was in Russian. After Alexander II abolished serfdom, many land-hungry Chuvash peasants moved to other areas in Russia to seek their own land. Between 1860 and 1914, nearly half of the Chuvash population left their home areas. The final wave of migration occurred during the Stolypin agrarian reforms. Soviet Union During the 19th and early 20th century, national feelings started to grow among the Chuvash intelligentsia. They connected with other minority pro-independence movements in the middle Volga area. Marxist ideology gained popularity among the poorest peasants and industrial workers. On May 15, 1917, the Chuvash joined the Idel-Ural Movement and in December 1917 joined the short-lived Idel-Ural State, when an agreement was reached with Tatar representatives to draw the eastern border of Chuvashia at the Sviyaga River. The Chuvash promised to respect the Islamic Tatars' religion and grant them local and cultural autonomy inside the League of Idel Ural States. The southern border with the Mordvins was set along the Sura River, with equal rights guaranteed to the Chuvash living west of the Sura. In the south, the border went along the Barysh, Bolshoi Akla and Tsilna Rivers between the Sura and Sviyaga. In the north, there was a dispute with representatives of the Mari-populated Tsykma (Kozmodemyansk) and other areas in Chuvashia. In 1918‚Äì1919, the Russian Civil War encompassed the area. This ended with victory for the Bolsheviks, who were mainly ethnic Russians, with strong support from Nizhny Novgorod troops. The local Chuvash independence-minded politicians were executed by the Bolsheviks. To gain support from the local population, Lenin ordered the creation of a Chuvash state within the Russian SFSR. On June 24, 1920, the Chuvash Autonomous Oblast was formed, which was transformed into the Chuvash ASSR in April 1925. The 1930‚Äì1931 Communist campaign against the rich kulak peasant class, which resulted in their deportation to Gulag prison camps and the elimination of independent peasant farms, hit the Chuvash ASSR's agricultural production hard. The Great Purge in 1936‚Äì1938 dealt a great blow to the Chuvash intelligentsia; many were shot or deported to prison camps. Most of the local Chuvash teachers were shot, making it difficult to teach Chuvash, as the Russian replacements did not know the language. Ethnic Russians kept control of the area, and the Russification of the Chuvash and Mari peoples intensified. From 1930 to 1940, a shift from mainly agriculture to industry was initiated. By 1940, the Chuvash ASSR produced 35,000,000 kWh of electricity, 848,000 m2 raw timber, 369,000 m2 sawn timber, 40,000 m cotton cloth, 200,000 pairs of hosiery, 184,000 pairs of leather footwear, and 600 tons of animal fats. According to an order dated May 28, 1940 by the Central Committee of Communist Party, 20,000 Kolkhoz peasant families of Belorussian, Chuvash, Mordvin and Tatar origin were transferred to the \\"New districts of the Leningrad Oblast and the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\\", recently conquered in the Soviet-Finnish war. In 1941, another 20,000 families followed, each family averaging five persons. Lavrentiy Beria even suggested to transfer the entire Chuvash population from Chuvashia to Karelia to form a population security belt \\"against the Finnish Fascists\\". During the Great Patriotic War and the postwar industrialization period, more and more Russians moved to the expanding towns of Chuvashia. The rural population remained mostly agriculturally oriented Chuvashians and Kuruk Maris. In the south of the republic, Russians and other minorities, such as Ukrainians, moved in to work in the newly created Chuvash Forest Industry Combinate. In 1964, the Chuvash ASSR produced 350,000,000 kWh electricity, 1,073,000 m2 raw timber, 760,000 m2 sawn timber, 113,100,000 m cotton cloth, 28,800,000 pairs of hosiery, 1,800,000 pairs of leather footwear, and 3,200 tons of animal fats. On January 1, 1966, the population of the Chuvash ASSR was 1,178,000. In 1990, the republic was renamed the Chuvash Soviet Socialist Republic. Post-Soviet period Map of modern Chuvash Republic In 1992, it was given its present name. The Chuvash Republic is an autonomous republic within the Russian Federation. As a republic, the region has greater sovereignty than other areas of Russia in determining local policies and procedures. Nikolay Fyodorov, a former minister of justice of the Russian Federation, was elected the first President of the Chuvash Republic in 1994. He has a reputation as a pro-market reformer and has pressed the region to establish closer economic ties with other countries. He has also encouraged the growth of small businesses. The mayor of Cheboksary, Anatoly Igumnov, is also eager to work with international companies. Both republic and city governments have departments of foreign economic relations to work with foreign businesspeople.

He ruled the Compagnie du Saint-Sacrement (Company of the Blessed Sacrament) between 1639 and 1649, and was under the influence of the French Oratorians, through his confessor Paul de Condren. Life The only son of Charles, Baron de Renty, and Elisabeth de Pastoureau, Gaston studied at the Coll√®ge de Navarre in Paris, with the Jesuits at Caen, and finished at the age of seventeen at the College of the Nobles in Paris. He wrote several treatises on mathematics, in which he excelled. The reading of the Imitation of Christ aroused the desire to become a Carthusian, but obeying the wish of his parents, he married. In 1638 he abandoned public life and devoted himself to the service of the needy and suffering. Struck by the ignorance, in religious matters, of travellers at the Hospital of St. Gervaise in Paris, he gave them catechetical instructions and induced others to do likewise. In the course of his charitable works he made the acquaintance of Henry Michael Buch (b. 1590 in the Duchy of Luxembourg; d. 9 June 1666 at Paris; surnamed der gute Heinrich) and induced him to found a congregation of shoemakers and tailors, Fr√®res Cordonniers. They worked at their trade, divided their earnings with the poor and performed special acts of devotion prescribed by the pastor of St. Paul's. The statutes were approved by the Archbishop of Paris, Jean Francis de Gondi. After his death, Renty's body was brought to Citri in the Diocese of Soissons. When the coffin was opened nine years later his body was found intact. The bishop ordered it placed in a marble tomb behind the high altar. Throughout his career at court, in the army, and in politics he merited the esteem of all, and took an active part in public good works.

The mall opened in October 1968, two weeks after its sister property Almeda Mall, located on the south side of Houston. The malls, at one time, were near identical twins of one another. Northwest Mall was originally anchored by JCPenney and Foley's, with Woolworth's, Palais Royal, and Houston based Battelstein's as its 3 junior anchors. The mall has in leasable space.\\"Glimcher puts Almeda, Northwest malls up for sale.\\" Houston Business Journal/Business First of Columbus. Friday May 19, 2006. Retrieved on October 22, 2011. Due to poor performance and high vacancy rates, Northwest Mall closed on . History Northwest Mall, along with its Northwest 4 Theatres located on a free-standing pad on the northeast side of the property, opened to the public in October 1968. The movie theater was operated by AMC. AMC Northwest 4 was one of the first multi-screen theatres built in Houston, Texas. Upon opening, the mall featured anchors JCPenney, who owned their two- story building and surrounding parking lot with auto center, and Foley's, who also owned their own two-story building, surrounding parking lot, and automotive center, with the remainder of the property being owned by the mall itself. This resulted in the land being owned by three separate parties. Other original occupants in the mall include Piccadilly Cafeteria, Palais Royal, Lane Bryant, Lerner Shops, Susie's, Battelstein's, Farrell's Ice Cream Parlour, Gordon's Jewellers, and Thom McAn shoes. On July 11, 2000, after liquidating the inventory of the store, JCPenney closed their Northwest Mall location. The building remained vacant until Carolyn Thompson's Antique Center moved into the long vacant space in 2012, a result of the antique center losing its own long-time home on Old Katy Road as a result of a widening expansion to Interstate 610. SRO sports bar, which had relocated to Northwest Mall in the summer of 2001, announced its closing Feb. 2013. SRO was replaced with La Chapa sports bar, which closed in 2018, shortly after the mall itself. SRO had replaced the back half of the former F.W. Woolworth's junior anchor spot. The mall entrance to Woolworth's was transformed into an independent film theater. In 2006, the mall was about 64% occupied. During that year Glimcher Realty Trust put the mall up for sale, along with the Almeda Mall. In 2007, Levcor Inc purchased the main mall, giving them approximately 80% ownership of the property with only the former Foley's, later Macy's, having its own independent owner. Macy's closed in 2008. With the closure, only Carolyn Thompson's Antique Center, Palais Royal, La Chapa sports bar, and the Post Oak Club remained open at Northwest. All mall entrances were closed and boarded. Since the 2017 closing, the only current business operating at the mall is the antique center in the former JCPenney. Its mall entrance no longer exists, having been walled off shortly before Northwest's closure, with only the lower ground floor open to the general public. Northwest Mall has been named the preferred site to demolish and develop the acreage into the south terminus hub for the eventual high speed rail line from Houston to Dallas. Hurricane Ike Due to storm damage caused by Hurricane Ike, in 2008, both Bath & Body Works and Macy's closed their respective locations at Northwest Mall. Damages to the mall were further exacerbated by Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Neither store reopened before the entire mall closed for business in 2017, although Macy's had claimed that Northwest's store closing was only temporary pending repairs to the anchor building. Macy's website no longer reflects the Northwest Mall location.Macy's Website Redevelopment The Mall, owned by Houston-based Levcor, is in the early planning stages of a redevelopment; but due to the planned city re-development of nearby Hempstead Highway,Houston plans Hwy 290 Expansion the shopping center is waiting to see what land they could potentially lose to eminent domain before proceeding.Levcor plans Redevelopment of Northwest Mall ArchivedLevcor Purchases Northwest Mall for $19M and plans re-developmentCity of Houston to begin Right of Way acquisition process Summer 2009 The site of the Mall was one of three alternatives for the Houston passenger terminal of the Texas Central Railway, a high speed rail line connecting Houston and Dallas. The other two alternatives were the industrial site directly southwest of the Mall and the nearby METRO Northwest Transit Center. The mall was chosen as the station site in 2018.

In 1993, Smuda returned to Poland to help save Stal Mielec from relegation. During the seasons in Mielec, he managed to maintain the team in the Ekstraklasa.  Widzew ≈Å√≥d≈∫  In May 1995, he was appointed as the manager of Widzew ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and finished in second place behind Legia Warsaw in the 1994‚Äì95 season. The following season, Smuda managed not losing a single game in the league. The 1995‚Äì96 season was another successful one with Widzew's Marek Koniarek scoring the most goals in the league at 29. Widzew qualified for the UEFA Champions League competition for the 1996‚Äì97 season. Smuda managed the team to eliminate the Danish champions, Br√∏ndby IF and advanced to the Group Stage. Widzew were drawn into a group containing Atl√©tico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Steaua Bucharest. Widzew finished the group in third place. The team from ≈Å√≥d≈∫ were able to repeat their feat of winning the Ekstraklasa again. The next season was not as promising as Widzew's management sold some of their key players and were eliminated in the qualifying phases of the Champions League. Widzew finished in 4th place that year and were unable to qualify for any European competitions. Shortly thereafter, Smuda moved to Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w where he had much success.  Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w  Smuda was appointed as the manager of Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w after the 1997‚Äì98 season. His goal was to build a team that would be not only be successful in Poland but also in European cups. Smuda won the Polish League the following season, however, Wis≈Ça was ejected from European tournaments due to a fan throwing a knife at Dino Baggio during a UEFA Cup match against Parma F.C. In September 1999, Smuda was dismissed as manager of Wis≈Ça after team's first defeat in the 1997‚Äì98 season.  Legia Warsaw  After leaving Wis≈Ça in September 1999, Smuda was hired as manager of Legia Warsaw replacing Dariusz Kubicki. However, he did not win any trophies, nor qualify for any European competitions. After a 0‚Äì4 defeat by Zag≈Çƒôbie Lubin in March 2001, Smuda was sacked.  Return to Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w  In June 2001, Smuda was re- hired as a coach of Ekstraklasa champions Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w. He failed to defeat FC Barcelona in the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League.

Lech Pozna≈Ñ In May 2006, Smuda was hired as the manager of Lech Pozna≈Ñ following the club's merger with Amica Wronki. He led the club to a sixth-place finish in the 2006‚Äì07 season and fourth the following season. He also qualified for 2008‚Äì09 UEFA Cup Round of 32 with Lech Pozna≈Ñ. In 2008‚Äì09 Ekstraklasa season, Lech Pozna≈Ñ managed to reach the top of the league table by the winter break, but a series of draws during the spring round resulted in a third-place finish at the end of the season. His contract with the club was not extended.  Zag≈Çƒôbie Lubin  After several seasons with Lech Pozna≈Ñ, he returned to Zag≈Çƒôbie Lubin in September 2009.  Poland national football team  On 29 October 2009, he was chosen as the new manager of the Poland national football team.

Brown Nature Sanctuary is a sanctuary located in Houghton County, Michigan. It is maintained and preserved by the Michigan Nature Association.  History  The late Dr. Robert Thorson Brown (1923‚Äì2002), for whom the sanctuary is named, was Professor of Biological Sciences at Michigan Technological University until his retirement in 1983. He was an expert in the identification of plants, mushrooms and lichens, which his research involved. He enjoyed teaching the complex interactions between organisms and often took his students on many field trips. Shortly before he died, Dr. Brown assisted in the selection of the site that is now this sanctuary.  About the Sanctuary  The Brown Sanctuary is a northern wetland surrounded by a small pond and bordered by a black spruce, tamarack, and white cedar swamp. Several shrubs can be found in the sanctuary, including leather leaf, bog-rosemary, Labrador tea, and both small and large cranberry. Many carnivorous plants can be found in this fen, such as pitcher plant, round leaved sundew, and hidden fruited bladderwort. These unique plants capture and digest insects and other food to obtain the necessary nutrients. Image:RTB winter.jpgRobert T.

Linens 'n Things trims workforce , The Record (Bergen County) by Carol Fletcher, March 16, 2007. The chain operated 571 stores in 47 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces, and had 7,300 employees as of December 2006. The company's business strategy was \\"to offer a broad selection of high quality, brand name home furnishings merchandise at exceptional everyday values, provide superior guest service, and maintain low operating costs.\\"Company Profile, accessed April 9, 2007. Burdened with debt after private equity buyouts, the company announced it would shutter all remaining stores in October 2008.\\"Linens 'n Things store closings to begin Friday\\", accessed October 16, 2008 It was relaunched as an online-only retailer in February 2009 at its former domain name, LNT.com, selling similar products as its brick-and-mortar stores had. As an online retailer, it ceased operating in 2018. In July 2020, the rights to Linens 'n Things were acquired by holding company Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), which was founded by former NASA scientist Alex Mehr and serial entrepreneur Tai Lopez. Founding In November 1958, Eugene Wallace Kalkin established a leased-linen department in the New Jersey discount retailer Great Eastern Mills. After a succession of corporate ownership changes and the bankruptcy of Daylin, Inc. in 1975, Kalkin bought seven locations out of bankruptcy and founded an independent company, which became Linens 'n Things. By 1983, the chain had grown to 55 stores, and attracted the interest of retail conglomerate Melville Corporation, which acquired it that year. Under CEO Norman Axelrod, who joined in 1989, the company expanded aggressively, particularly in the superstore format; it was locked in a race for locations against archrival Bed, Bath & Beyond. It was spun off in an IPO when Melville reorganized into CVS Corporation in 1996. Acquisition and trouble A Linens 'n Things store (with older logo) going out of business in Durham, North Carolina. A Linens 'n Things store (showing newer logo) in Washington, D.C., with banner notifying customers that it was \\"going out of business\\" The company was acquired in February 2006 by Apollo Global Management, a private equity limited partnership, for US$1.3 billion. As a part of the transition from a public company to the private-owned business, the position of CEO went from Norman Axelrod to Robert (Bob) DiNicola; alongside of him were several executives such as F. David Coder who is President and Omer Fancy who is the executive Vice President of Marketing. According to Form 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the quarterly period ended September 29, 2007, Linens Holding Co. and subsidiaries (including Linens 'n Things, Inc. acquired in February 2006 for cash of approximately $1.3 billion) reported net sales of $666.8 million, versus $658.2 million in the year- earlier period. The increase in net sales was primarily due to the opening of new stores since Sept. 30, 2006 offset by the impact of a decline in comparable store sales. The decline in comparable store sales was primarily due to a decline in customer transactions partially offset by an increase in average transaction value. The operating loss (after a charge of $16.8 million for impairment of property and equipment in the more recent quarter) was $56.6 million against a loss of $17.9 million a year ago. After net interest expense and other income & expense, the loss before income taxes was $79.2 million compared to a loss of $41.7 million. After provision/benefit for income taxes, Linens Holdings reported a net loss of $79.9 million versus a net loss of $27.4 million. On April 17, 2008, the New York Post reported that the company was seeking to sell its highly profitable Canadian Division, but no one at Linens 'n Things would confirm nor deny this, saying only that an adviser had been hired to explore strategic alternatives.Linens 'n Things Seeks to Sell Canadian Stores, N.Y. Post Says, accessed April 17, 2008. Ultimately the Canadian Linens 'n Things stores met the same fate as their U.S. counterparts. Bankruptcy and liquidation On May 2, 2008, Linens 'n Things filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed 120 stores.Linen 'n Things files bankruptcy, to close 120 stores, accessed May 2, 2008. In August 2008, Linens 'n Things devised a plan to emerge from bankruptcy early in 2009.

Retrieved Aug. 1, 2008. Amateur Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina was established in Sarajevo in 1947. Around the same time, the local unions were established in other major cities of the Republic. By the 1950s, activity mostly boiled down to simple homemade amateur radio equipment. This has helped to create the conditions for the establishment of more complex forms of communication in the country and beyond. The first ham radio contact in BiH was on 6 July 1950. This prompted further development of amateur radio in Bosnia and Herzegovina, exhilarating Alliance to begin organizing federal, republican and club competitions. During the seventies, the Bosnian-Herzegovinian hams have increasingly sophisticated radio equipment and antenna systems, and begin to make better placements in national and international competitions. After the outbreak of war in Croatia in 1991, and BH hams begin sending news about these events through short and ultrashort waves. After the outbreak of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992. The phone systems were largely cut off from the vast majority parts of the country, and the inner regions were completely blocked. Ham radio work has become vitally important in such circumstances. Hams were used for the first time in April 1992 to send information to other parts of Europe and the world about the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Messages were sent to individuals, governments, the media, humanitarian organizations and religious communities. In many cases, ham radio was the only way for the Bosnians to stay in touch with their loved ones who have been out of the country, and the only way for people from around the world to obtain information about their families and friends who have been under siege. It is estimated that during the war more than three million messages exchanged, and about 1,500 young people passed their first exam and become amateur radio operators. Hams from neighboring countries, Europe and the rest of the world the most help in the exchange of humanitarian messages during the war of 1992-96. At the beginning of 1993, The Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina joins International Telecommunication Union (ITU) as an independent state and a member of the UN gets prefix T9. The association of radio amateurs of Bosnia and Herzegovina became a member of International Amateur Radio Union (IARU) on 27 December 1993. Merit Association hams Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognized by the International League of Humanists on 16 November 1999 in Trieste and awarded in recognition of the work and contributions during the war. So far, there are 4173 amateur radio licenses issued by ARABiH. They are registered in the database ARABiH. The current number of members ARABIH, who have paid the fee for the current year, is about 850. ARABIH has diversified repeater network and the network of digital communication that helps in connecting with the world. Every year we organize a lot of socializing and BH amateur championships in various disciplines. BH hams participate in the work of all the major international amateur radio organizations, and our competitors usually end up near the top in all major international competitions.

The film is based on Penelope Williamson's novel. Similar to Angel and the Badman where John Wayne plays a wounded outlaw who is sheltered by a Quaker family. Plot summary The Outsider takes place in Montana in the late 19th century. At the beginning of the movie, Ben Yoder (Brett Tucker) is preparing to leave his house on a rainy day. His young son, Benjo (Thomas Curtis) wants to go with him, but Ben tells him to stay home, \\"to protect your mother\\"‚Äîhis wife, Rebecca (Naomi Watts). As Yoder is pulling a rescued sheep from the river, he happens upon two men cutting a fence where the rest of the flock are stabled, henchmen of ruthless cattle baron Fergus Hunter (John Noble). An argument ensues between Yoder and the henchmen about whether or not the land is \\"open range\\" or \\"legally homesteaded\\". Using the rope still tied around his waist from rescuing the stray sheep, Yoder winds up being dragged several feet by his horse, until he finally manages to cut himself free with a small knife. He angrily insists to Fergus Hunter to get off his land; \\"I won't sell.\\" Hunter retorts, \\"No, I guess not...but your widow will.\\" With tears in his eyes, Ben Yoder drops his knife, refusing to fight back against the men he knows are going to kill him. A few hours later, Rebecca and Benjo find him hanging from a large tree; this has an incredibly traumatizing effect on the little boy. At the Yoder homestead, the religious community they belong to‚Äîa group resembling the Amish that refer to themselves as the \\"Plain People\\"‚Äîare gathered. The town doctor, Lucas Henry (David Carradine), offers Mrs. Yoder a pill of some sort, but one of the men, Noah Weaver (Keith Carradine) responds coldly, \\"She does not need your pills, doctor. She will pray.\\" Meanwhile, members of Rebecca's family‚Äîincluding her father, who leads the church‚Äîare frustrated that the sheriff and his men refuse to do anything about Ben Yoder's murder, other than have Hunter's men fix the fence they originally cut. Several months pass by, and winter arrives. Rebecca and Benjo manage the homestead on their own; the latter has almost stopped speaking entirely since he found his father dead. However, he quietly alerts his mother when a wounded man approaches them, staggering through the snow. When he passes out in front of them, Rebecca sends her son into town to fetch Doc Henry, urging him to communicate however necessary to get the doctor to come out to their house. As Benjo hurries to town, Rebecca drags the unconscious man back into her home and begins disarming him, her alarm growing as she finds more and more guns on his person. Wounded outlaw Johnny Gault (Tim Daly) is given refuge by widowed sheep farmer Rebecca Yoder. This puts Rebecca on the outs with her own people. They incur the wrath of a ruthless cattle baron who wants the land of the religious group.http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-outsider-v276077 The two enter into a relationship which is forbidden since he is an \\"outsider\\" from their religion and way of life. She is shunned from the fold until she is ready to confess her sins from this illicit union and be forgiven. She decides she must go back to her old way of living. When the time comes for her to do so, she is not able to walk away from her new life with Johnny. She leaves the meeting that had been set up and runs back to Johnny. In an attempt to help Johnny in a shoot out, during which Johnny kills also the cattle baron, Rebecca is hit by an enemy's bullet. She eventually recovers and they (presumably) live happily ever after as they ride off (into the sunset).

Kuban described anatomical problems in detail. He notes that the slab was not documented in situ, and there are significant issues with CT scans claimed to authenticate the slab. Other creationists have not supported the claims, and one of those originally promoting the slab has removed the information from his website. In 1982-1984, several scientists, including J.R. Cole, L.R. Godfrey, R.J. Hastings, and Steven Schafersman, examined Baugh's purported \\"mantracks\\" as well as others provided by creationists in Glen Rose. In the course of the examination \\"Baugh contradicted his own earlier reports of the locations of key discoveries\\" and many of the supposed prints \\"lacked characteristics of human footprints.\\" After a three-year investigation of the tracks and Baugh's specimens, the scientists concluded there was no evidence for any of Baugh's claims or any \\"dinosaur-man tracks\\".  Criticism from creationists  Young Earth creationist organizations such as Answers in Genesis and Creation Ministries International have criticized Baugh's claims saying he \\"muddied the water for many Christians ... People are being misled.\\" Don Batten, of Creation Ministries International wrote: \\"Some Christians will try to use Baugh's 'evidences' in witnessing and get 'shot down' by someone who is scientifically literate. The ones witnessed to will thereafter be wary of all creation evidences and even more inclined to dismiss Christians as nut cases not worth listening to.\\" Answers in Genesis lists the \\"Paluxy tracks\\" as arguments \\"we think creationists should NOT use\\" [emphasis in original]. The old Earth creationist organization Answers In Creation also reviewed Baugh's museum and concluded \\"the main artifacts they claim show a young earth reveal that they are deceptions, and in many cases, not even clever ones.\\" The \\"Burdick track\\" and \\"fossilized finger\\" were featured on the controversial NBC program The Mysterious Origins of Man, aired in 1996 and hosted by Charlton Heston.\\"A Review of NBC's 'The Mysterious Origins of Man'\\", 1996, Glen J. Kuban. Retrieved August 15, 2008. Creationist Ken Ham criticized the production in the February 1996 Answers in Genesis newsletter in a review titled \\"Hollywood's 'Moses' Undermines Genesis.\\" Ham attacked Baugh's claims, saying, \\"According to leading creationist researchers, this evidence is open to much debate and needs much more intensive research.

After being a bingo hall for many years, it has now been restored as a cinema and theatre, showing classic films and staging live shows. Building The building is in the Art Deco style, it was constructed in 1932 to a design by William Thornley. It opened as a cine-variety venue. It had an original seating capacity of 1878 (other sources say 1848)- and in its restored state has 614 seats in the stalls, 318 in the front circle and 254 in the rear circle (the balcony). The site involved cutting into the rock. Compton Theatre Organ To possess an original Compton Organ is rare, but the Plaza organ is notable in its own right. It was the first Compton Theatre Organ to be built with sunburst decorative glass panels. These can be illuminated in a range of colours. The Compton organ is a three manual instrument with a unique 150 stop tab layout which was designed for the Plaza and her sister cinema by Norman Cocker the resident organist from Manchester Cathedral and Arthur Ward one of the original Directors of the Stockport Plaza. It has in addition 42 toe and thumb pistons. There are 11 ranks of pipes situated in 2 chambers, one over the other to the right of the stage. These are concealed behind the decorative grill in the wall. There is no electric amplification, as the sound is produced acoustically straight from the organ pipes. The console is on a lift so that it can rise out of the floor, adding to the theatrical effect. As there is no amplification the organist controls the volume using swell pedals that operate shutters in the grill. It was played before shows, and during silent movies, variety acts and musical interludes between films. The organ can supply a large range of effects from sleigh bells to aircraft and sea sounds.  History  The front fa√ßade of the Plaza Cinema Early history The first plans for a cinema on this site was made by William Thornley in 1929. It was a conservative scheme that incorporated a motor garage, a billiard hall, a restaurant with a 1600-seat cinema. Thornley, who had trained with Bradshaw Gass & Hope was experienced in designing silent movie cinemas. The owners of the site rejected the scheme. They had just opened the 1850 seat Regal Cinema, Altrincham which was designed by Drury and Gomersall and described as the ‚ÄòCathedral of the Movies‚Äô. Thornley was commissioned to modify the Altrincham plans to fit on the more restricted Stockport site. 10,000 tonnes of sandstone was excavated to create The Plaza and the adjoining Plaza steps by outside labourers. The building was partially underground. The cinema was an Art Deco gem which was welcomed by the local cinema goers but opposed by the local business community, smarting from the use of outsiders when the town was still suffering from the Great Depression. Technically the cinema had all the latest equipment the projectors that could project silent and sound stock, and a Compton organ to be played during the silent news reels. It was a cine-variety venue. The Plaza attracted competition and by 1939 there were two further super cinemas in the town centre- and two in the suburbs. After the war, in the 1950s The Plaza was refurbished and diversified into CinemaScope and 3-D screenings. The conversion to a Bingo Hall was refused by Stockport Borough Council planning committee- this ruling was overturned by National government and Rank Leisure proceeded with their plan. The Bingo Years Bought in 1967, the Plaza operated as a Mecca Bingo Hall until 1999. Restoration The Plaza was sold to the Stockport Plaza Trust, first restorations started, and it re-opened for live shows and vintage film presentations. The first cinema show in December 2000 featured a performance of 42nd St which had been the first film shown at the Plaza in 1932. The Compton organ was found to be in working order, it was powered up and a performance of 1930s singalong music was given by Nigel Ogden. The Plaza was closed during 2009, and ‚Ç§1.9m restoration, funded by a National Lottery grant took place. Volunteers embarked on THE restoration of The Plaza to its original 1932 configuration. Most of the fa√ßade has now been unveiled and sports new name sign as well as red and green side panels, all constructed with neon lighting. The entire face has also been completely restored to its original cream ensemble.

However, the man designated to hand over small firearms to Ayub's group in the airport, named Sh'alan, was arrested, and confessed to the plot - leading Romanian authorities to immediately arrest Ayub when he entered the building. However, a second wave team targeted the same flight the following day and successfully hijacked it, although it crashed in the Arabian desert, killing 62 people aboard. Ayub was sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment, but was released after only ten months.

The supersymmetry algebra contains not only the Poincar√© algebra and a compact subalgebra of internal symmetries, but also contains some fermionic supercharges, transforming as a sum of N real spinor representations of the Poincar√© group. Such symmetries are allowed by the Haag‚Äì≈Åopusza≈Ñski‚ÄìSohnius theorem. When N>1 the algebra is said to have extended supersymmetry. The supersymmetry algebra is a semidirect sum of a central extension of the super- Poincar√© algebra by a compact Lie algebra B of internal symmetries. Bosonic fields commute while fermionic fields anticommute. In order to have a transformation that relates the two kinds of fields, the introduction of a Z2-grading under which the even elements are bosonic and the odd elements are fermionic is required. Such an algebra is called a Lie superalgebra. Just as one can have representations of a Lie algebra, one can also have representations of a Lie superalgebra, called supermultiplets. For each Lie algebra, there exists an associated Lie group which is connected and simply connected, unique up to isomorphism, and the representations of the algebra can be extended to create group representations. In the same way, representations of a Lie superalgebra can sometimes be extended into representations of a Lie supergroup. Structure of a supersymmetry algebra The general supersymmetry algebra for spacetime dimension d, and with the fermionic piece consisting of a sum of N irreducible real spinor representations, has a structure of the form :(P√óZ).Q.(L√óB) where *P is a bosonic abelian vector normal subalgebra of dimension d, normally identified with translations of spacetime. It is a vector representation of L. *Z is a scalar bosonic algebra in the center whose elements are called central charges. *Q is an abelian fermionic spinor subquotient algebra, and is a sum of N real spinor representations of L. (When the signature of spacetime is divisible by 4 there are two different spinor representations of L, so there is some ambiguity about the structure of Q as a representation of L.) The elements of Q, or rather their inverse images in the supersymmetry algebra, are called supercharges. The subalgebra (P√óZ).Q is sometimes also called the supersymmetry algebra and is nilpotent of length at most 2, with the Lie bracket of two supercharges lying in P√óZ. *L is a bosonic subalgebra, isomorphic to the Lorentz algebra in d dimensions, of dimension d(d‚Äì1)/2 *B is a scalar bosonic subalgebra, given by the Lie algebra of some compact group, called the group of internal symmetries. It commutes with P,Z, and L, but may act non-trivially on the supercharges Q. The terms \\"bosonic\\" and \\"fermionic\\" refer to even and odd subspaces of the superalgebra. The terms \\"scalar\\", \\"spinor\\", \\"vector\\", refer to the behavior of subalgebras under the action of the Lorentz algebra L. The number N is the number of irreducible real spin representations. When the signature of spacetime is divisible by 4 this is ambiguous as in this case there are two different irreducible real spinor representations, and the number N is sometimes replaced by a pair of integers (N1, N2). The supersymmetry algebra is sometimes regarded as a real super algebra, and sometimes as a complex algebra with a hermitian conjugation. These two views are essentially equivalent, as the real algebra can be constructed from the complex algebra by taking the skew-Hermitian elements, and the complex algebra can be constructed from the real one by taking tensor product with the complex numbers. The bosonic part of the superalgebra is isomorphic to the product of the Poincar√© algebra P.L with the algebra Z√óB of internal symmetries. When N>1 the algebra is said to have extended supersymmetry. When Z is trivial, the subalgebra P.Q.L is the super-Poincar√© algebra.

In contrast to the elevated plain of the Upper Engadine, where the upper reaches of the En flow gently down the valley, the geological background of the Lower Engadine forms a very different landscape. The right flank of the valley, the Lower Engadine Dolomites, is highly jagged, densely forested and steep. Glaciers and rivers have marked the left side of the valley in many different ways, where the geological structure has allowed for the formation of a fairly broad valley floor and sofly rising, rounded landscape features with high-lying terraces, which is where most of the villages - with the notable exception of the main town Scuol - are located.http://www.guarda.ch/index.php?lang=3&idcatside;=95 Extract from : Guarda, Not Caviezel, ¬© Schweizer Kunstf√ºhrer, published by the Society for Swiss Art History  History   Tourism   History of tourism  In the Lower Engadine tourism became important in 1913 with the opening of the train station in Scuol, since then it has been well connected to the rest of Switzerland. In 1369 the mineral sources in Scuol were mentioned for the first time but the health benefits were known even earlier. The most important tourism attraction is the Bogn Engiadina Scuol inaugurated in 1993. Further, the opening of the Vereina tunnel in 1999 reduced the trip length from Zurich to Scuol considerably so now it is possible to do a one-day trip to Scuol, visit the Bogn Engiadina and return in the evening. With 80 km of courses, the inauguration of the Motta Naluns ski area in 1956 was another important date in the history of tourism in Scuol. Local cuisine The Lower Engadine cuisine has not lost its originality. This regional cuisine is characterized by the use of selected local spices which have the rare ability to infuse a dish with a certain Engadine taste. In general, the basic ingredients of the dishes are quite alimentary, using potatoes and meat because the Engadine farmers of former times had a hard daily working life. Additionally, expensive ingredients weren't available to the mainly poor farmers. Because of the local way of preparation, dishes vary from kitchen to kitchen and village to village.

The film was released April 3, 1941, eight months before the NBC radio series came to an end. Paulette Goddard's singing voice was dubbed by Vera Van. The film was known as The Golden Hour in the United Kingdom and was re-released in 1946 by Astor Pictures as Jimmy Steps Out.  Background  Pot o' Gold was radio's first big-money giveaway program, garnering huge ratings within four weeks of its 1939 debut. The program's success prompted production of the film. The premise of the radio program, created by Ed Byron, was that any person who picked up the telephone when host Horace Heidt called would automatically win $1000. Phone numbers were chosen by three spins on the Wheel of Fortune: (1) choice of phone directory, (2) page number and (3) the line on the page. The series ran on NBC from September 26, 1939 to December 23, 1941 and later a new show by the same name from October 2, 1946 to March 26, 1947 on ABC.  Plot  James Stewart and Paulette Goddard The film tells of a couple romantically involved despite family feuds. The full film Jimmy Haskell (James Stewart) is the former owner of a defunct music store. His uncle, C.J. Haskell (Charles Winninger), dislikes music and has long wanted Jimmy to join him in his health food business. Jimmy only agrees after his music store is closed. When Jimmy arrives at his uncle's place, he is confronted by members of the McCorkle family, who play in Heidt's band and often practice outside C.J.'s business. As C.J. hates music, he is infuriated and attempts to stop the band using the police. Unsuccessful, he is thrown a tomato by Jimmy, unintentionally. Jimmy is then made a hero by the band and the McCorkles, who do not know his true identity. Molly McCorkle (Paulette Goddard) falls in love with him. When Jimmy substitutes for C.J. on the Haskell radio program, two band members find out his identity. They work together to devise a scheme to persuade C.J. to take a vacation. In the meantime, Jimmy takes over the operation of the business and invites Heidt's band to play on the radio. Molly learns Jimmy's identity, and in anger, she says the Haskell program will give away $1000 every week. Jimmy has no choice but to find a way to hand out the cash, and a federal investigator reminds him that using lottery to give the 1000 dollars is illegal. Jimmy plans to use phone books and a roulette-style game to find winners. The Haskell program grows immensely popular and attracts lucrative advertising contracts. This reconciles the Haskell and McCorkles, paving the way for the marriage between Jimmy and Molly.

It was located on the Lake Ontario waterfront at the foot of Roncesvalles Avenue, west of downtown Toronto. The name 'Sunnyside' was the name of a local farm owned by John George Howard, which was situated just to the north, on the location of the current St. Joseph's Medical Centre. Sunnyside Avenue runs north-south from that location north to Howard Park Avenue today. John Howard is also famous as the original landowner of the nearby High Park. Construction View of beach in 1924 Prior to the construction of the park, the shoreline was a narrow stretch immediately to the south of the 1850s era rail lines. There was enough area for a restaurant and a small fenced off area was provided for changing into swimwear. To the east, the club-house of the Parkdale Canoe Club jutted out into the lake. A plan was developed in 1913 by the new Toronto Harbour Commission to improve the shore lands from the foot of Bathurst Street to the Humber River. The plan, which included four miles (6 km) of breakwater, infilling of land, and the construction of the Lake Shore Boulevard, cost $13 million, and was paid for by the federal government. A boardwalk along the south side of Lake Shore Boulevard was built, from the Humber River east to Wilson Park Avenue, in width using white pine planks. This corresponded to the length of shoreline that was extended out into the lake. This boardwalk became the site of annual Easter Parades until 1953. It was rebuilt in 1934 as a make-work project and was paved using asphalt in the 1960s. The Amusement Park lands themselves were completely created from sand dredged from the bottom of the bay and top soil from a farm in Pickering, Ontario. The original shoreline was extended into the lake by approximately 100 metres, from the foot of Wilson Park Avenue west to the Humber River, a distance of about 1 kilometre. Only a small length of the original shoreline and beach exists today, located between the Boulevard Club and the Canadian Legion building at the intersection of Dowling Avenue and Lake Shore Boulevard. One of the first new buildings was the Sunnyside Pavilion, a curved structure providing a restaurant with views of the lake. It was located just to the east of Parkside Drive at the shoreline. Following this, the Sunnyside Bathing Pavilion and Dean's Sunnyside Pleasure Boats buildings were constructed. Soon after, concessions were requested and granted to operate amusements on the lands. Sunnyside Amusement Park opened in 1922. At the time, there was an existing amusement park on the Toronto Islands at Hanlan's Point. It only operated a few more years until 1927 when a baseball stadium at the foot of Bathurst Street was built, replacing the stadium on the Island. Another amusement park, the Scarborough Beach Amusement Park was built in Scarborough, Ontario, to the east of Toronto. Rides in 1923 Attractions The park was popular for its large roller coaster, known as the 'Flyer', several merry-go-rounds, the Derby Racer steeplechase ride and numerous smaller attractions. It also hosted several 'stunt events' including flagpole sitting, famous boat burnings in Lake Ontario and fireworks displays. Other popular attractions included outdoor and indoor musical concerts, night clubs, and restaurants and walking along the boardwalk. Bathing Pavilion in 1922 Bathing Pavilion By the 1920s, swimming at the foot of Roncesvalles had been popular for over thirty years, as there was a swimming area near a pumping station. This changed in 1913 when the pumping station was demolished to make way for the bridge connecting Lakeshore Road and the King/Queen/Roncesvalles intersection. A staircase was built for pedestrians to walk down to the shoreline. A slide was installed for bathers to slide down into the water. By 1920, this area was filled in and the beach was moved further to the south. On June 28, 1922, Toronto Mayor Alfred Maguire opened the Sunnyside Bathing Pavilion to help bathers change for the swim in the lake. The building, constructed of concrete, cost $300,000. Each wing held an outdoor changing area, lockers and showers, the women's side on the east, and men's side on the west. It offered over 7700 lockers for patrons, a roof garden for 400. Admission fees were 25¬¢ for adults and 15¬¢ for children, and bathing suits and towels could be rented. In the center was a staircase leading to an upper terrace which overlooked the change areas leading to a rear terrace which ran the full length of the building and overlooked the beach. On July 29, 1925, due to coldness of the lake during the preceding two summers, the Sunnyside Pool, nicknamed the 'Tank', was opened beside the Bathing Pavilion to the east. It measured by and could accommodate 2,000 swimmers. At the time of construction, the pool was considered the largest outdoor swimming pool in the world. Admission fees were 35¬¢ for adults, 10¬¢ for children. Sunnyside Pavilion and Tea Gardens, August 3, 1921 Sunnyside Pavilion Sunnyside Pavilion provided two restaurants and a tea garden facing the lakeshore. It was curved into a crescent with the tea garden positioned within the semicircle. It was designed by the same architects and was in the same style as the Bathing Pavilion, immediately to the west. It was built in 1917 on the south side of Lakeshore Road. When built, its south side was on the lakeshore. As infill proceeded it ended up about 50 metres from shore, on the north side of the new Lake Shore Boulevard. In 1920, the building was enlarged and a new south entrance was built facing the lake. The restaurant had the Blue Room for 400 diners/175 dancing couples, and the Rose Room for a further 300 diners/150 couples. Dancing followed supper, with music provided by the Joe DeCourcy live orchestra. In 1936, the Pavilion was renovated and became known as the Club Esquire supper club, with stage shows and dancing. In 1941, the building was converted into the Top Hat night club. It was demolished in 1956 to make way for the new westbound lanes of Lake Shore Boulevard. Sunnyside Flyer The Sunnyside Flyer roller- coaster, advertised as having the \\"dippiest-dips on the continent\\" was opened in 1923. It was designed by veteran amusement ride builder A. J. Miller, who had built most of the attractions at the prior Hanlan's Point amusement park, and had built roller coasters in North America and Blackpool, England. The coaster was redesigned in 1933 with increased height and speeds. View of park showing Dean's Boats/Palais Royale at shoreline, 1923 Sunnyside Stadium The Sunnyside Stadium softball and lacrosse field was opened on May 19, 1925, immediately to the east of the amusement park, next to the current Boulevard Club, then the Parkdale Canoe Club. It was the site of several popular women's softball leagues. It was bulldozed in 1956 for the current Boulevard Club parking lot. Palais Royale/Dean's Sunnyside Pleasure Boats Opening in 1922, the Palais Royale building provided a factory for Walter Dean to build his \\"Sunnyside Torpedo Canoe\\" on the lower floor, and the Palais Royale dance hall on the upper floor. The upper floor opened at ground level on the north, and the land sloped downwards to the lake shore line, where the lower level opened onto the lake. The factory also rented canoes and rowboats. Dean had been building boats in a nearby building that was demolished to build the amusement park and the Harbour Commission built the new building, which cost $80,000. The boat-building business ended not long after the opening of the amusement park, and Mr. Dean retired. The dance hall took over the whole building. During the era of the amusement park, the dance hall operated as a nightclub with nightly live music along with special engagements from musicians such as Count Basie. From 1933 to 1950, Bert Niosi \\"Canada's King of Swing\\", provided the house orchestra. The hall still exists today as a special occasions event hall. Notable events In 1923, dog races were held on the lawn in front of the Bathing Pavilion. The first Miss Toronto pageant took place at Sunnyside in August 1926. The first winner was Miss Jean Ford. It was an annual tradition on the Easter weekend for people to parade on the boardwalk. In July 1936, Toronto was sweltering under temperatures of 41 ¬∞C (105 ¬∞F). People slept on the grass by the lake. On the beach, thirty men removed the tops from their bathing suits. They were arrested and charged with indecent exposure. They were acquitted and from then on it was acceptable for men to go topless on Toronto beaches. On September 9, 1954, Marilyn Bell concluded her historic swim across Lake Ontario at the breakwater at Sunnyside. A plaque exists at the foot of Roncesvalles at the water's edge.  Demolition  View in 2007 showing Palais Royale The plans for the Gardiner Expressway were known since 1943, as part of a City of Toronto Planning Board report which called for tens of miles of super-highways criss-crossing the Toronto urban area. But it was not until after several fires in the winter of 1955 that the Toronto Harbour Commission ordered the park's demolition, facilitating the building of the roadway. Lake Shore Boulevard was the scene of regular traffic jams and the park was seen to be impeding 'progress' to the development of Toronto. Most rides were demolished, however several amusements including the Derby Racer were moved to the Canadian National Exhibition (C.N.E), and the carousel to Disneyland where it was renamed the King Arthur Carrousel. Only the Sunnyside Pool and Bathing Pavilion and the Palais Royale buildings survive in place as relics of the Park. For two summers afterwards, a small children's amusement area named 'Kiddieland' was operated to the south of Lake Shore Boulevard, the site of Budapest Park today. It was operated by Conklin Shows. A children's amusement park, 'Centreville Amusement Park', was later built on the Toronto Islands. The old Lakeshore Road and its connecting bridge to the King/Queen/Roncesvalles intersection was demolished also. The Lake Shore Boulevard roadway was doubled from four lanes to eight lanes in the area of the amusement park with a large empty median between the lanes in each direction. For several years afterwards the median was used as parking lot for the annual Canadian National Exhibition. A pedestrian bridge was built to the south-side of Lake Shore Boulevard to replace the bridge and stairs that was demolished. The Sunnyside Bathing Pavilion, one of the few surviving structures Starting July 21, 1957, the Queen streetcars that travelled down the old bridge and served the shoreline and park were moved to a new track to the north of the rail lines, in the middle of the new 'The Queensway' roadway, and the old tracks were removed. In 1964, the lands of the park were transferred from Harbour Commission ownership to the City of Toronto, which has operated Budapest Park along the shoreline ever since, but most of the remaining lands of the amusement park are vacant or are roadways or parking lots. In 1967, the Sunnyside train station just to the north of the old park ceased operations and was demolished in 1973. Sunnyside Bus Terminal, which opened in 1936, just north of the train station, ceased operation in 1990 and is now a McDonald's. The area today The boardwalk was removed and replaced with a boardwalk made of recycled plastic planks. A children's playground was built just east of the Ryder Pool. A recreation trail, part of the Martin Goodman Trail, was built south of Lake Shore Boulevard through the area for cyclists and in-line skaters.

The programme ran for 42 years from 1959 until 2001, initially on the Light Programme and later on BBC Radio 2, and earning itself the title of the longest-running continuous music programme in the world.Cliff Adams Format The lyrics to its main theme began as follows: Sing something simple As cares go by Sing something simple Just you and I When Sing Something Simple was broadcast by Radio 2, this song would be followed by an announcer (in latter years, Alan Dedicoat) who would say: \\"We invite you to Sing Something Simple, a collection of favourite songs, old and new, sung by The Cliff Adams Singers, accompanied by Jack Emblow.\\" and alternately 'We invite you to Sing Something Simple, not only listening, but joining in we hope, with all these songs you know so well'. The pianist, Semprini, introduced his own show with \\"Old ones, new ones, loved ones, neglected ones\\" but the effect was similar on \\"Sing Something Simple\\". The tune would then continue: We'll sing the old songs like you used to do, We'll sing something simple for you, something for you. Ten minutes in, Cliff Adams would perform a piano solo, which he would introduce, after which the singers would continue with a selection of popular songs of varying vintage. In later years - particularly in the 1980s - in the days when Radio 2's FM frequencies were sometimes leased to Radio 1, the programme would be broadcast directly after the Top 40. End The last broadcast was in 2001. The programme ended partly because Cliff Adams died that year and partly because of Radio 2's repositioning to appeal to the former Radio 1 audience.

Ohara Museum of Art George Desvalli√®res (1861‚Äì1950) was a French painter. A native of Paris, Desvalli√®res was a great- grandson of academician Gabriel-Marie Legouv√©, and received a religious upbringing. He studied at the Acad√©mie Julian(fr)gallica.bnf.fr, Larousse mensuel illustr√© : revue encyclop√©dique universelle, 1929 with Tony Robert- Fleury and with Jules Valadon at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. He painted portraits at first, but a relationship with Gustave Moreau turned him towards an interest in mythology and religion. Desvalli√®res became acquainted with ancient art during a trip to Italy in 1890, and upon his return began working in the style with which he was most associated, combining dark subjects and violent color with a dramatic conception of religion. He took as his subjects numerous symbolist characters, such as Narcissus (in 1901), Orpheus (1902), and The Marche Towards the Ideal (1903); he also served as one of the founders of the Salon d'Automne. In 1919 he founded the Ateliers d'Art Sacr√© with Maurice Denis, in an attempt to renew interest in religious art. The atelier served a similar function to that performed by artists' studios in the Middle Ages. Desvalli√®res became interested in religious art after losing a son to World War I in 1915; he himself had commanded a battalion in the Vosges during the war. Desvalli√®res also tackled a number of public and private decorative programs related to the war; among these were windows for the Douaumont ossuary and for a church in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. He also illustrated a number of books and plays, including Edmond Rostand's La Princesse Lointaine and Rolla by Alfred de Musset. Until 1950 he also received State commissions. Works by Desvalli√®res may be found in the Mus√©e d'Orsay and the Mus√©e du Louvre. He died in Paris in 1950.

James Duffy (May 1, 1890 in County Sligo, Ireland - April 23, 1915 outside Ypres, Belgium) was a distance runner from Canada, one of the world's best marathon runners at the beginning of the 20th century. He participated in the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm and was the winner of the 1914 Boston Marathon. Born in Ireland, Duffy grew up in Edinburgh, Scotland after moving there with his family as a child. According to his own later account, Duffy participated in cross-country races in Scotland, winning many of them. In 1911 he emigrated to Canada, where he worked in Toronto as a tinsmith and stonecutter. In his spare time he visited the Central YMCA, the director of which quickly recognized his talent. Representing the Central YMCA, Duffy came in second in the 1911 Ward Marathon, a twenty-mile event in Toronto. During the race Duffy stopped to argue with supporters of another runner. In May 1912, he ran the Spectator Marathon in Hamilton, Ontario, which served that year as the Canadian Olympic trial. The race, which was reduced to nineteen miles, was run in exceedingly hot and humid weather. Only eight of twenty-five starters finished the race. Duffy himself had overestimated his strength, but qualified for the Olympics by finishing in second place behind Harry Jensen of the United States, who passed him in the final mile and won by twenty seconds. Representing the Eaton Athletic Club of Toronto, Duffy placed fifth in the marathon at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, which also took place in very high temperatures, resulting in the death of Portuguese runner Francisco L√°zaro. In October 1912 Duffy won both the Ward Marathon and the Hamilton Herald's race around Hamilton Bay, setting a new course record in the latter event. After the Hamilton Bay race Duffy accepted full-time coaching from athletic trainer Tommy Thomson, who persuaded him to relocate to Hamilton, where he joined the Ramblers Club. With Thomson as trainer, Duffy won seven consecutive marathons, including one in Yonkers, New York. On April 20, 1914, Duffy won the Boston Marathon in 2:25:01. His success had gotten around and he was so much the favorite that the Boston bookmakers would not take high bets on his victory. The race developed into a thriller, with fellow Canadian runner √âdouard Fabre matching Duffy's pace throughout. Only in the final mile did Duffy gain a small lead, winning the race by fifteen seconds. Duffy's first request after his victory was for a cigarette, and after his post-race medical examination he asked for a bottle of beer. After the Boston Marathon Duffy turned professional, losing his first professional race to √âdouard Fabre. Duffy enlisted in the Canadian Army at the outbreak of World War I. He joined the 91st Argyle Regiment and was subsequently transferred to the 16th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Duffy was killed in a charge against the Germans while serving with the 16th Battalion in the Second Battle of Ypres on April 23, 1915, eight days before his twenty-fifth birthday and four days after √âdouard Fabre won the 1915 Boston Marathon.

Retrieved 2012-06-13. One in 9 U.S. men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in his lifetime. A man of African descent is 74% more likely to develop prostate cancer than a Caucasian man, and more than twice as likely to die from the disease. Active duty military personnel are twice as likely to develop prostate cancer as their civilian counterparts. Several important prostate cancer discoveries made in the past 25 years have been as a result of PCF's actions, whether in funding or in coordination. These results include the development of new medications, gene therapy approaches, and the development of vaccines that signal the body's immune system to kill cancer cells. In 2017, 81% of every dollar spent goes to the prostate cancer research mission. Since 2007, more than $52.8 million has been awarded to the Young Investigator Program, a PCF program that gives recent MDs and PhDs the opportunity to conduct pivotal research at a critical point early in their careers as research scientists. In 2017, the PCF Global Research Enterprise supported teamwork and team science with a portfolio that included 372 active research awards totaling $118 million. There are 220 active Challenge Award teams and 110 active Young Investigators, who represent the next generation of scientific discovery. PCF's efforts and advocacy have helped produce a 20-fold increase in government funding for prostate cancer research. This is how the prostate cancer product pipeline has turned from bone dry to a robust flow. PCF set itself apart at its founding in 1993, when prostate cancer research was considered a dead end. PCF attempted‚Äîand has succeeded with‚Äîa new model: invest in the most innovative and promising programs that merit major investment; reduce the red tape and shorten the time from grant request to response, so that the best, most vibrant young minds get answers sooner and get to work faster; form a community with researchers, investors and pharmaceutical companies so everyone can work toward the same goals. This new model has turned prostate cancer research into one of the most vibrant and impactful fields of medical research. PCF's global influence now extends to 22 countries. Most recently, PCF expressed support for the goals of Vice President Joe Biden's Cancer Moonshot. Dr. Jonathan Simons, a physician- scientist, medical oncologist, and leader in prostate cancer research is currently President and Chief Executive Officer of the Foundation., Prostate Cancer Foundation, Leadership Team. Retrieved 2012-06-13. History The Prostate Cancer Foundation, formerly known as CaP CURE, was founded in 1993 by Michael Milken following his personal battle with prostate cancer. After being diagnosed with prostate cancer, Milken traveled to many different specialists in the field. Citing a major lack of funding for prostate cancer research and roadblocks that existed within the grant application process, Milken created PCF to spur both private and government support in the field of research. In 2011, PCF established the Coalition to Cure Prostate Cancer in Canada and expanded global research efforts into China, partnering with the Chinese Urological Association and funding its first two Young Investigators in China. In early 2014, PCF launched The Norwegian Prostate Cancer Foundation. Accomplishments Through the Prostate Cancer Foundation's unique funding structure, PCF funding has been a major part of some of the most significant discoveries in the field of prostate cancer research.

According to a 2004 Fortune magazine article, PCF's grant- giving model \\"is to stimulate research by drastically cutting the wait time for grant money, to flood the field with fast cash, to fund therapy-driven ideas rather than basic science, to hold researchers accountable for results and to demand collaboration across disciplines and among institutions, private industry, and academia.\\", Fortune, The Man Who Changed Medicine. Retrieved 2015-03-10.  PCF Research Enterprise Strategy  To accelerate prostate cancer research and reduce red tape, PCF employs a \\"fast-track\\" awards process designed to maximize the time researchers spend searching for better treatments and a cure for prostate cancer. PCF follows a venture capital model of philanthropic investing, providing initial funding for high-impact, early- stage research projects that offer great hope for new treatments or better understanding of the disease. When these early investments demonstrate promising results, other institutional funders, such as the National Cancer Institute or biopharmaceutical companies, step in to provide the major funding needed to complete the work and bring a new drug or treatment to market., Prostate Cancer Foundation, Research. Retrieved 2015-03-10. Grant awardees are selected from a pool of applicants from around the world. Each submitted proposal is subjected to a rigorous peer review process in which the projects are assessed for their scientific merit and potential impact in the field of prostate cancer. The PCF Standing Review Committee consists of approximately 74 pre-eminent scientists and members have expertise in various areas of science and medicine related to advance prostate cancer solutions. Each of these panelists adheres to confidentiality and conflict of interest policies to ensure PCF's award processes are free from bias. Priority is given to high- risk, first-in-field and currently unfunded projects‚Äîtypically falling outside the parameters of conventional funding organizations. All PCF award recipients must share their work within one year of receiving their funds, an innovative requirement for the industry. This unique stipulation encourages scientific cooperation and accelerates discovery. After the first year and the development of genetic testing of men at highest risk of prostate cancer, the number of requests for grants soared and prestige for PCF grants grew as well. Today, many other foundations have adapted their grant-making after PCF's model. After careful evaluation by more than 40 experts in prostate cancer research and biotechnology, PCF revised its investment strategy in 2007., Prostate Cancer Foundation, Research Strategy. Retrieved 2015-03-10. The current goal is to build on past successes and further accelerate the development of new therapies and the discovery of new information. PCF Research Principles: * Identify the most promising research not being funded * Recruit the best scientists to energize the field * Limit award applications to five pages * Make award decisions within 60 days‚Äîfund them in no more than 90 days Grants and awards PCF's scientific strategic plan operates on the principle that longer term funding of milestone-driven research is needed in the field in order to reduce death and suffering from prostate cancer. The following awards are offered to help to reach this goal: Challenge, Young Investigator, and Creativity Awards., Prostate Cancer Foundation, Funded Research. Retrieved 2015-03-10. =Young Investigator Awards= The Young Investigator (YI) Program has been a pillar of PCF's Research Enterprise since its inception in 2007. YI awards are 3-year investments in early-career scientists (recent MDs and PhDs) with the skills and expertise to rapidly advance high impact discoveries that can be translated to clinical practice. As part of the YI program, awardees are mentored by leaders in prostate cancer research. Each award is matched dollar-for-dollar by the investigator's institution. To date, PCF has provided funding to 255 YIs, representing a total investment of $52.8 million in 10 countries. =Challenge Awards= PCF Challenge Awards are multi-year awards supporting cross-disciplinary teams of research scientists., Prostate Cancer Foundation, Challenge Awards, Retrieved 2015-03-10. These teams are composed of scientists from 3 or more cancer centers. As a stipulation of funding, all PCF Challenge Award teams must include at least one PCF Young Investigator, demonstrating the Foundation's commitment to the career development of early and mid-career scientists. =Creativity Awards= PCF supports imaginative, innovative thinking with its Creativity Awards., Prostate Cancer Foundation, Creativity Awards, Retrieved 2015-03-10. These two-year awards for $300,000 support exceptionally novel projects with great potential to produce breakthroughs for detecting and treating prostate cancer. They are complementary and integrated with other PCF award programs. Global Expansion PCF has expanded its global research network and partnerships through three important steps: the establishment of the Coalition to Cure Prostate Cancer (CCPC) in Canada, the launch of PCF China and the launch of The Norwegian Prostate Cancer Foundation. The Canadian entity monitors national research progress at Canadian cancer centers and universities. The PCF China initiative identifies, funds and promotes innovative research projects benefiting men around the world. In March 2012, PCF presented the first two Young Investigator awards to Chinese scientists at the inaugural China Prostate Cancer Symposium in Beijing. Moving forward, PCF will work with established Chinese institutions such as the Chinese Urological Association to expand cancer research and encourage sustainable collaborations. In addition to offering clinical fellowships abroad, the Norwegian Prostate Cancer Foundation hosts an annual International Meeting on Prostate Cancer, where experts from around the world gather to present cutting-edge data on innovations in the field of prostate cancer. PCF's emphasis on global collaboration and our support of public- private partnerships continue to accelerate discovery and expand access to patient information, leading to highly personalized treatment plans. In 2020, PCF funded and launched the Prostate Cancer Theranostics and Imaging Centre of Excellence (ProsTIC) at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Australia.https://www.petermac.org/ProsTIC Programming The Prostate Cancer Foundation uses partnerships with many other organizations and celebrities to raise funds for prostate cancer research and to help spread awareness to the public. Sports Programs =Home Run Challenge= A partnership between PCF and Major League Baseball. The MLB-PCF Home Run Challenge is a partnership with Major League Baseball that helps baseball fans join the fight against prostate cancer by raising money for research through monetary pledges for each home run hit during all scheduled MLB games in the week leading up to Father's Day. The program is supported by many players, managers and their coaching staffs, umpires, and Major League teams, personalities and executives, such as the Minnesota Twins and Joe Torre., Prostate Cancer Foundation, Minnesota Twins Partner with Prostate Cancer Foundation for Home Run Challenge, Retrieved 2015-03-10 In the 2016 campaign, there were 241 home runs hit, raising an approximate total of $1.8 million. Since 1996, the MLB- PCF Home Run Challenge has raised more than $45 million for groundbreaking and life-saving prostate cancer research. =Golf Programs= Blue Ribbon Golf is a program utilizing golf tournaments of various sizes, at all types of golf courses and facilities, for supporting the Prostate Cancer Foundation. The Blue Ribbon Golf Par-3 Challenge (formerly known as Arnie's Army Battles Prostate Cancer) is a series of one-day events built around a closest-to-the- pin contest on a par-3 hole. The program began in 2002 behind legendary golfer Arnold Palmer and has sponsored over 2,000 events and raised more than $5.5 million in the fight again prostate cancer.

Through the power of the moustache, the Movember Foundation brings to life their vision of having an everlasting impact on the face of men's health. They do this by getting men to grow and women to support the moustache during the 30 days of November to spark conversation and raise funds for men's health issues ‚Äì including prostate cancer. PCF is an official beneficiary partner with the Movember Foundation for their U.S. campaign. To date, the Movember Foundation has raised approximately $44 million for PCF to support prostate cancer research. =Safeway Awareness Campaign= Over the course of PCF's 13-year partnership with The Safeway Foundation (Safeway, Inc.), many impactful advances in prostate cancer research have been realized. Most recently, funding from The Safeway Foundation fast-forwarded the research and development of the breakthrough therapy Xofigo¬Æ, which is used to put metastatic bone tumors into remission. In less than 12 months since its launch, Xofigo allowed over 60,000 U.S. men to live pain free after exhausting all other treatment options. The Safeway program changed medical research history: it has generated nearly $83 million for PCF since 2001. =Scientific Retreat= Each year, the Prostate Cancer Foundation hosts a scientific retreat where teams of scientists and their institutions can share the results of their studies funded by the Foundation.

Designed by Abraham Stott, it was constructed in 1865 for Henry Houldsworth, a prominent mill owner at the time. It is a Grade II* listed building. History Houldsworth Mill c.1900 Reddish mill was built by Stott and Sons for William Houldsworth, snd opened in 1865. It covers , and employed 454 workers. In 1898, it amalgamated with the Fine Cotton Spinners Association. The mill had 136,692 spindles and at one time spun counts of 700 and 800, but normally 80s to 250s. After cotton Cotton production at Houldsworth Mill ceased in the 1950s. The mill was sold to a mail-order catalogue company, John Myers, and was used principally as a warehouse. In the late 1960s the building was expanded with a five-storey extension to the rear of the north end of the mill. This was built of glass and concrete in the style of the period. Mail-order trading ceased in the 1970s, and the mill was sold. It was divided into separate business units, but most of the building remained vacant and it fell into a state of disrepair. Architecture The 1865 mill consists of two five-storeyed blocks of 18 bays, with a narrower 9 bay central block for warehousing and offices. The central block has two Italianate stair towers and carries a central clock. The floors have become wider to accommodate the larger mules of the period. All floors are fireproof, with transverse vaults. The detached engine house used horizontal shafts that connected to vertical shafts in each spinning block. The chimney was octagonal, on a plinth with a highly embellished oversailer. In the early 20th century this was replaced with separate inverted compound engines for each block, with external rope races for rope drives. Restoration The pilot study for restoration was part-funded by English Heritage. The refurbishment was funded by:Stockport Council * The mill's owners (Heaton and Houldsworth Property Company) * Northern Counties Housing Association (and Housing Corporation) * English Partnerships * European Regional Development Fund * Stockport Council * Various anchor tenants, including Ridge Danyers College and Kingfisher Pools This mill was converted by Stephenson Bell architects. It provides 70 shared ownership apartments for social housing provider Northern Counties Housing Association, start-up units for emerging high-technology and arts-based businesses with commercial and leisure uses at the lower floors to provide active frontages.

Lewis Doll (1901‚Äì1985) established the first string program in the San Antonio Independent School District (SAISD) in the 1940s. At this time, no other public school district in San Antonio offered string instruction. As the SAISD string program grew, Doll started the San Antonio Youth Symphony around 1950. A second orchestra for junior high school students was formed in the 1960s and both orchestras operated under the auspices of the SAISD until 1979. 1974-1983 The San Antonio Youth Symphony began receiving grant money from the City of San Antonio, Texas in 1974 and became known as the Greater San Antonio Youth Symphony Orchestras (GSAYSO). At this time, only four of the 19 area school districts offered string music programs. The GSAYSO opened string learning centers in some of the districts that were without a strings program. When this strings learning center program ceased in 1979, only the Northside Independent School District was able to sponsor its own string program. The Youth Philharmonic Orchestras of San Antonio was formed in 1977 and operated independently of GSAYSO until they merged in March 1979. The name Youth Orchestras of San Antonio (YOSA) was formally adopted in the summer of 1979. Maintaining four orchestras for the first few years of its existence proved to be impractical for the young YOSA organization. In 1981, the orchestras were reduced to two even though the demand by talented student musicians continued to grow. During the 1982-83 season, the City of San Antonio Parks and Recreation Department provided YOSA with office space, a secretary, and other assistance which stabilized YOSA‚Äôs financial picture and attracted more private and business support. 1984-1994 The decade from 1984 to 1994 saw steady growth in both student membership and services provided by YOSA. A strong coaching staff was added to the program, enhancing the quality of the students' musicianship. A landmark event in YOSA history came in 1985 with the addition of a tour of Eastern Europe with performances in Romania, Hungary, and Austria. The tour was sponsored by the City of San Antonio Parks and Recreation Dept. and KMOL, a local television station, and made under the auspices of the Friendship Ambassadors Foundation (a non-profit organization specializing in cultural and educational exchanges). Publicity about the tour resulted in another sharp increase in YOSA membership. As a result of the fundraising efforts for the international tour, the parents‚Äô support group was formalized to the Parents‚Äô Auxiliary Organization and continues to be the main vehicle for raising money for student‚Äôs individual tour accounts. To date, most of the money raised by the Parents' Auxiliary Organization continues to be used to support touring fees on behalf of the student musicians. Performances Local YOSA performances have included community events, including the City of San Antonio‚Äôs Christmas tree-lighting ceremonies and the opening concert of the Founders‚Äô Day celebration. Regional exchanges and tours to cities such as Fort Worth, Houston and Corpus Christi have been included in season schedules. The Summer String Camp has been conducted by YOSA annually since 1986 and now includes classes in theory, composition, and conducting. In the 2005-2006 Season, the YOSA Philharmonic orchestra launched their Gold Series with international guest artists accompanying their top orchestra. Great Tour of China 2010 In 2010, along with conductor Troy Peters, YOSA took its first tour to China. This is YOSA's eighth international tour. They toured five cities in fourteen days, with four performances. Their first performance was in Beijing at the National Centre for the Performing Arts. Their second performance was an outdoor concert at the Shanghai World Expo. Their third concert took place in Hangzhou, at the Zhejiang Provincial Concert Hall. Their fourth and final concert was in Hong Kong, a side-by-side concert with the Hong Kong Youth Symphony Orchestra (HKYSO) at the Kwai Tsing Theater. In addition to these four cities, the YOSA group also made stops in Wuzhen and Shenzhen. The tour orchestra consisted of young musicians ages 12‚Äì19 from both the YOSA Symphony Orchestra and the YOSA Philharmonic Orchestra.  Conductors  Music Director Troy Peters joined Youth Orchestras of San Antonio in August 2009. Prior to joining YOSA, he served for 14 years as the Music Director of the Vermont Youth Orchestra Association, as well as the Middlebury College Orchestra, and Montpelier Chamber Orchestra. Peters has conducted over 20 performances with the San Antonio Symphony, twice stepping in last-minute. In 2012/13 he made his guest conducting debut with the Oregon Symphony. Peters has gained attention for his orchestral collaborations with rock musicians such as Jon Anderson (of YES) and Trey Anastasio(of Phish) along with orchestral soloists Midori, Edgar Meyer, Horacio Guti√©rrez, Daniel Bernard Roumain (DBR) and Soovin Kim. Past conducting positions include the Philadelphia Youth Orchestra, the Pacific Chamber Soloists, and Perpetuum Mobile.

Background Facts A fire, caused by an independent contractor‚Äôs employee welding negligently, began on the defendant‚Äôs premises and spread to a nearby property. The property was burnt causing A$2.5M of damages. The plaintiff sued under ignis suus, nuisance, negligence and the rule in Rylands v Fletcher (a rule of absolute liability),. interpreted in part through the duty of occupier to invitee. The defendant was Burnie Port Authority (Burnie), located in Burnie Tasmania, who provided storage facilities, and the plaintiff was General Jones who stored a large quantity of frozen vegetables. General Jones suffered damage when the vegetables were ruined by fire which destroyed Burnie property. Prior proceedings *Supreme Court of Tasmania: found for the plaintiff against the defendant on the grounds of the ignis suus rule. Other defendants were the contracting firm who did the welding as part of expanding coolroom capacity, and the manufacturers of Isolite, the highly flammable insulating material, which was set alight by welding sparks, and which produces noxious gases.. *Defendant appealed to the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Tasmania: found for the plaintiff on the basis of Rylands v Fletcher principle. The grounds of nuisance and negligence were not appealed.. *Appealed to the High Court of Australia High Court Judgment The High Court held that Rylands involved ‚Äòquite unacceptable uncertainty‚Äô. It said that Blackburn J‚Äôs formulation had been ‚Äòall but obliterated by subsequent judicial explanations and qualifications‚Äô. And at the time of Rylands, negligence liability was limited to ‚Äòa miscellany of disparate categories of cases‚Äô and only with Heaven v PenderHeaven v Pender (1883) 11 QBD 503. and Donoghue v Stevenson,. was liability grounded on general foreseeability. The justices therefore felt that the rule should be done away with and so the independent contractor was not liable under that, but could only be culpable in the law of negligence. HCA Held: The appeal by Burnie was dismissed. Burnie, by allowing its contractor to introduce dangerous substances and activities on site, owed a duty of care to Jones to take reasonable steps to prevent fire, and the breach created liability under the normal rules of negligence. The joint judgment stated \\"The rule in Rylands v Fletcher, with all its difficulties, uncertainties, qualifications, and exceptions, should now be seen ... as absorbed by the rules of ordinary negligence. Under those principles, a person who takes advantage of his or her control of premises to introduce a dangerous substance, to carry on a dangerous activity, or to allow another to do one of those things, owes a duty of reasonable care to avoid a reasonably foreseeble risk of injury or damage to the person or the property of another.\\" The ignis suus (his or her fire) rule was held to be ancient common law that was modified by statute in the UK, but never became law in Australia. Damages in the tort of nuisance were not pleaded in the HCA.

Schloss Ebenrain () is a former country residence in Sissach, in the canton of Basel-Country, Switzerland. Built in 1774-1776, it is considered the most significant late baroque residence in northwestern Switzerland. It is now a public facility and the site of an agricultural school. It is listed as a Swiss cultural property of national significance. History Ebenrain Castle Schloss Ebenrain was built as a summer residence for the wealthy Basel silk ribbon manufacturer and trader Martin Bachofen and his family. The Basel architect Samuel Werenfels designed the building.Kanton Basel-Landschaft, Schloss Ebenrain, Sissach: Geschichte Bachofen intended at first to build a modest country residence, but changed his plans and built a luxurious estate. The gardens to the north and south of the residence were designed by Bernese architect Niklaus Spr√ºngli. Both gardens were converted to fashionable English parks in the early 19th century, but one landscape feature, namely the parallel rows of lindens lining the drive to the house, has remained essentially unchanged to the present day. Changes of ownership (1817-1872) Elite Basel families typically stayed in the country from May to September, but Bachofen often extended his stays at Ebenrain until the end of hunting season in January or February. Bachofen died in 1814, and in 1817 his widow, Margaretha, sold Schloss Ebenrain to another Basel merchant, Johann Rudolf Ryhiner-Streckeisen. Seven years later the estate's new owner committed suicide at Ebenrain. Ryhiner was facing charges of bigamy, and on 29 July 1824 he took his own life with a pistol. In 1836 Ryhiner's widow sold Schloss Ebenrain to Ludwig Vest, a businessman from Liestal. In 1838 Vest transferred the estate to Lukas Vischer, an art collector from Basel who had just returned from several years' residence in Mexico. Vischer died at Ebenrain in December 1840. In 1849 the Vischer family sold Schloss Ebenrain to a Prussian military officer, Major Leopold von Orlich, who sold it the following year to Ernst Wilhelm Wilding, Prince Radali of Sicily. In 1857 Johannes David-Sickeler of Basel acquired it, and in 1860 it went to Charles Philibert Gobat, former minister of Tramelan in the Canton of Berne. Gobat, who had a large family, was in financial difficulties by March 1872, when he sold the estate to Albert H√ºbner-Allan from M√ºhlhausen. H√ºbner was a Moscow textile merchant who had settled in the border province of Alsace but decided to leave after the Franco-Prussian War, when the province went to Germany. Renovations H√ºbner made several significant changes to Ebenrain, adding tracts of land to the estate and hiring landscape architect √âdouard Andr√© to transform Ebenrain's surroundings and add outbuildings, most of which are now dismantled. H√ºbner also hired an Alsatian farm manager and expanded the farming operation at Ebenrain. =Second Empire phase= H√ºbner decided to transform Schloss Ebenrain to suit the Second Empire style. He expanded the main building, transformed the interior, and had the exterior painted beige. H√ºbner died in 1890. Upon his widow's death in 1911 the estate passed to the couple's oldest daughter, Marie Eug√©nie Catherine, wife of the French vice admiral and diplomat Charles Philippe Touchard. =Restoring the Baroque style= In 1930 Touchard died at Ebenrain. His heirs promptly sold the estate to a Basel merchant, Rudolf Staechelin-Finkbeiner, who renovated the house and used it to display his acclaimed collection of modern French paintings. Staechelin himself took up residence in an outbuilding. Both the Touchards and Staechelin had taken steps to remove some of H√ºbner's innovations and restore Ebenrain's baroque character. The exterior walls went from beige back to blue-gray. Staechelin devoted nine years to a comprehensive renovation, but he made no structural changes to the house. After Staechelin suffered a stroke in 1946, his son, Peter Gregor Staechelin, offered to sell Schloss Ebenrain to the Canton of Basel-Country. The sale was completed in 1951. For decades the cantonal government confined its restoration efforts to furnishing the interior appropriately. Finally between 1986 and 1989 both the interior and exterior of the residence were restored to their baroque character. At the same time, the top (roof-level) floor was converted to a large exhibition room, the cellar was expanded, and the entire house was made accessible by wheelchair. Public ownership The cantonal government has owned Schloss Ebenrain since 1951. The building and its surrounding park have been used for public art exhibitions, concerts, and other functions. The farm associated with the castle was detached and administered separately as an agricultural school, Landwirtschaftliches Zentrum Ebenrain. Access Since the elevation of a highway in 1967, Schloss Ebenrain and its park appear to be cut off from the town of Sissach. The residence is still accessible on foot or by bicycle, however, and the route from the Sissach train station to Ebenrain is marked by signposts.Kanton Basel-Landschaft, Schloss Ebenrain, Sissach: Lage und Name The entire building has been accessible for people with disabilities since 1989.

It is an important place of worship for Hindus and the location of a well-known Shaiva monastery. The temples are dated to the 6th or 7th century CE and were constructed by the early kings of the Chalukya dynasty of Badami. The dating of the temples is based on the style of architecture which is similar to that of the temples in nearby AiholeCousens (1926), p. 51 and the information in two notable inscriptions in the complex: the Mahakuta Pillar inscription dated between 595-602 CE (written in the Sanskrit language and Kannada script); and an inscription of Vinapoti, a concubine of king Vijayaditya, dated between 696-733 CE and written in the Kannada language and script.Cousens (1926), p. 52 Basic plan The Karnataka artisans of the 7th century achieved a certain eclectism in their architecture by building south Indian dravida style temples adjacent to north Indian nagara style temples.Sinha (2000), p. 34 Further, their dravida and nagara styles were local, indigenous variants and unrelated to the architectural styles that prevailed in modern Tamil Nadu to the south, and Central India (\\"Madhyadesha\\") to the north.Sinha (2000), p. 35 They achieved this by combining the basic plan of one style with characteristics of the other. The dravida style temples here have a tiered tower over the shrine which is capped with a dome like structure. The nagara style temples use a curvilinear tower over a shrine which has a square plan, and is capped by a ribbed stone. The development of this hybrid style, achieved by combining the typological features of the two basic architectural styles, is considered a peculiarity of the Karnataka region and defines the beginnings of the Vesara style of architecture.Sinha (2000), p. 38 A natural mountain spring flows within the temple complex and feeds fresh water into a large tank called the Vishnu Pushkarni (\\"Lotus pool of god Vishnu\\") and an ablution tank called Papavinasha Tirtha (\\"Tank of Ablution\\"). Among the several shrines in the complex, the Mahakuteshvara temple, built in the dravida style, and the Mallikarjuna temple are the largest. There is a small shrine in the centre of the Vishnu Pushkarni tank and in it is a Shiva linga (universal symbol of god Shiva) called Panchamukha linga (\\"five faced linga\\"), one face for each direction and one on top. Inscriptions The Mahakuta complex has provided historians two important 7th century inscriptions. The Mahakuta Pillar inscription, dated variously between 595-602 CE records a grant made by Durlabhadevi, a queen of Pulakeshin I (the father of king Mangalesha). The queen supplemented an earlier grant with an endowment of ten villages, including Pattadakal and Aihole to god Mahkuteshvara Natha. In addition, the inscription provides important information about the Chalukyan lineage, their military expeditions, their conquests and early monuments.The Mahakuta Pillar and Its Temples, p. 253, Carol Radcliffe Bolon The pillar goes by the name Dharma-jayastambha (\\"Pillar of victory of religion\\") and is on exhibition at a Bijapur archaeological museum.Cousens (1926), p. 52 The other inscription, ascribed to Vinapoti, king Vijayaditya's concubine, is inscribed in the porch of the Mahakuteshvara temple. It describes a grant of rubies and a silver umbrella to the deity Mahakuteshvara in addition to a piece of land.

He stated that he was tortured with electrical wires, and was released only after his uncle bribed a Syrian officer with a bottle of wine. After his release, he ostensibly hid in East Beirut before boarding a ship to Cyprus, and subsequently traveling to Italy before taking a train to Frankfurt, Germany and buying a flight ticket for Canada. On July 9, 1992 he was interrogated by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service at his shared apartment in Montreal, where he was living while collecting social assistance and studying French, and confronted with the fact a man had arrived at the airport with a Lebanese passport in al-Husseini's name. He stuck to his original story, and when asked about his opinions of Syria, noted that one day they would be punished for their occupation. In August 1993, al-Husseini took a trip to Lebanon, despite having convinced Canadian authorities he would be tortured if he returned. After he returned, he made a September 17 call to CSIS asking why his application to become a landed immigrant was taking so long, and was told there were concerns he was connected to Hezbollah. He denied the accusation, and another meeting was set up. He was confronted with the 1988 hijacking of Kuwait Airways Flight 422, and continued denying he played any role. CSIS interrogated him on two other occasions, during which he spoke of how widespread Hezbollah had become in Canadian cities and offered the names of Hezbollah agents living in Ottawa and Montreal as evidence.Depalma, Anthony. New York Times, Saudi Case Casting a Light on How Militants Infiltrate and Exploit Canada, May 4, 1997 Although he was not formally accused or charged, he was frequently questioned about his relationship with the 1998 hijacking of a Kuwaiti jet. He eventually ended up recanting many of his statements, ostensibly after he realised that Canadian officials weren't likely to let him stay in the country in exchange.

History Gerson Lehrman Group was founded by Yale Law School graduates Mark Gerson and Thomas Lehrman in 1998. Alexander Saint-Amand, a former Bloomberg reporter, joined GLG shortly after, and served as CEO until 2018. GLG, initially funded by friends and family, was formed as a publishing house to produce industry guidebooks for institutional investors. However, the founders discovered that their clients wanted to talk directly to experts in casual conversations, rather than reading formal written reports. Accordingly, in 1999, GLG abandoned its publishing business and began offering subscriptions to its network of experts. This business came to be called an expert network. GLG's first customers were investors, and most of their growth from 1999 to 2005 was within the investment community. In 2006, they began working with big strategy consultancies and with companies in life sciences, chemicals and industrials, and technology. By 2010, The Wall Street Journal had described GLG as \\"dominating the U.S. expert networking industry\\". In the design space, GLG is a pioneer of activity based working office design, which does away with seating assignments for workers. In 2018, GLG named Paul Todd as its new CEO. Todd was previously the head of eBay's EMEA business, in such post from 2015. Nonprofit activities In 2006, GLG worked with U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide new primary data and analysis relevant for any other recovery plans in the rebuilding of Louisiana following Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. GLG has also done other philanthropy work with smaller charities. GLG now operates a global Social Impact Fellowship, an initiative that provides learning resources and expertise to a select group of nonprofits and social enterprises, at no cost. Institutional partnerships As the use of alternative research providers within the financial industry has grown, brokerages themselves have been partnering with firms like GLG. On September 10, 2008, the company announced a deal with Credit Suisse, whereby analysts from the financial services giant would be able to tap into GLG's experts as part of their research process. About 300 Credit Suisse analysts became members of the GLG expert network. In 2009, Gerson Lehrman Group announced a partnership with Frost & Sullivan, making the company's 800+ market researchers available to consult with GLG clients. In July 2009, GLG announced that it has partnered with Amba Research, a leading financial services knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) firm that provides equity and credit research. On July 8, 2010, GLG and Bloomberg announced a partnership that enables clients of the Bloomberg Professional platform to access the GLG expert network through the Bloomberg platform. In October 2011, GLG partnered with and acquired a minority stake in Ushi, a leading China-based business social networking provider, and the largest competitor of LinkedIn in the region.

Work Metzner realised that conventional theories of heat and mass transfer were very poor in designing many industrial processes with non-Newtonian fluids, and set about producing new design methods. His work had direct industrial relevance to the processing of composite materials, polymer processing, and fiber spinning. His studies of fluid mechanics produced the Otto-Metzner correlation for power consumption in mixing of non- Newtonian fluidsAIChE Profiles Arthur Metzner and the White-Metzner equation for stress which is used in computational fluid dynamics for polymer processing.

General James Wolfe had sailed across the Atlantic in Namur on this occasion before his capture of Quebec. Also on this journey was 6th Lieutenant Michael Henry Pascal with his slave and servant Olaudah Equiano who at that time was called Gustavus Vasser,TNA ADM 36/6252 his slave name given him by Pascal. Equiano in his book wrote that the ceremony of surrender was \\"the most beautiful procession on the water I ever saw\\", and gives fuller details. In 1758, fifteen Namur sailors were tried and condemned to death by hanging for mutiny; they had protested to be replaced aboard another ship. King¬¥s grace reprieved them from death penalty except one. (Leonard F- Gutteridge: Mutiny - a list of naval insurrection\\", 1992 Annapolis USA) Namur was the flagship of Admiral Sir George Pocock in the Battle of Havana (1762). Namur fought in the Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797) under the command of Captain James Hawkins-Whitshed. Namur was astern of , under the command of then Commodore Horatio Nelson, at the beginning stages of the battle. Namur was razeed to a 74-gun ship in 1805, and took part in the naval engagement of 4 November 1805 (Battle of Cape Ortegal), when the remnant of the French and Spanish warship fleet which had escaped from Trafalgar was engaged by Lord Strachan's squadron; she took on and captured the French warship Formidable. She was placed on harbour service in 1807 and remained in this role until 1833, when she was finally broken up. Some of Namurs timbers were used to support the floor of the wheelwright's workshop at Chatham Dockyard. They were rediscovered there in 1995 and identified in 2003.

Texas A&M; defeated Centre 22‚Äì14.Schoor, Gene (1994) pp. 1‚Äì4. It is also the game in which Texas A&M;'s 12th man tradition originated. Centre came into the game undefeated, outscoring its opponents by a margin of 314 to 6. It also upset Harvard in the regular season in what was later deemed one of the greatest upsets in college football history. A&M; finished its regular season 5‚Äì1‚Äì2 and captured a Southwest Conference title. Game summary Texas A&M; halfback Sammy Sanders received the opening kickoff from Centre kicker Red Roberts, returning it for 45 yards. After the first down of A&M;'s first drive, Aggie periodback and team captain Heinie Weir suffered a leg injury after getting tackled to the ground. He was moved to the sidelines. After the injury, A&M; failed to gain any yards, and was forced to punt. A&M; punter Tom Miller punt the ball, which was eventually caught by Tom Bartlett, who was stationed behind his goal line. Bartlett, who tried to run the ball, was immediately tackled by Fred Wilson for a safety. A&M; put up two points on the scoreboard to lead Centre. Centre had never trailed in a game all season.Schoor (1994) p. 2 Centre's offensive line gave injuries to Aggie players Sanders and A. B. Morris, who were removed from the field. The Aggies played with four substitute defenders. Centre fails to gain six inches to score a touchdown before the end of the first half Before the half ended, Centre reached A&M;'s two-yard line. Centre's Red Roberts and Herb Covington attempted to run through for a touchdown, but were stopped by the A&M; defense line. On fourth down, Roberts was stopped at the A&M; six-inch mark. Referee Ernie Quigley marked the ball at the two-inch line for the Aggies. The half ended with A&M; maintaining its 2‚Äì0 lead. During halftime, A&M; head coach Dana X. Bible, after noticing the injuries on the team, called E. King Gill to the A&M; bench. Gill, a reserve player who had left the A&M; football squad at the end of the regular season to play basketball, was assisting sports editor Jinx Tucker in pointing out players in the press box of the stadium. Bible ordered Gill, who was in civilian clothes, to put on a football uniform in case he was needed to play in the game. Gill put on the uniform of Heine Weir, one of the injured football players, underneath the stands, since there were no dressing rooms, while Weir put on Gill's civilian clothes. Gill stood on the sidelines during the second half ready to go in, but ultimately was not called by Bible as the starting roster managed to finish, although Gill was the only substitute player available by the end of the game. However, Gill's readiness to play began the storied Twelfth Man tradition.Schoor (1994) p. 2‚Äì3 Once the third period started, Centre was forced to punt after they failed to gain yards on their first drive of the second half. The Aggies took over on downs, but fumbled on their first play. Centre recovered the ball on the A&M; three-yard line. Centre fullback Terry Snoddy rushed in for a touchdown. Centre scored an extra point to put the score at 7‚Äì2.Schoor (1994) p. 3 After Centre's first score, A&M; coach Bible chose to kick off. Centre received the ball, though fumbled it, causing three A&M; tacklers to fall on the return player. Cap Murrah recovered the ball at the Centre thirty-three yard line. On A&M;'s possession, Puny Wilson threw the ball to Jack Evans for a touchdown. A&M; restored their lead to 9‚Äì7 after scoring the extra point. Centre fumbled the ball again on their ensuing possession, allowing the Aggies to recover it on Centre's twenty-four yard line. A&M;'s Miller rushed to the fourteen-yard line for a first down, and Billy McMillan chalked up five more yards. End Puny Wilson ran for a touchdown on the next down to extend the Aggies' lead to 16‚Äì7.Schoor (1994) pp. 3‚Äì4 Once Centre got the ball again, their hopes of a comeback failed as Aggie defensive tackle Ted Winn intercepted a ball and ran forty-five yards for another A&M; touchdown, increasing the score to 22‚Äì7. Centre would score a touchdown afterwards, but the game soon ended 22‚Äì14.Schoor (1994) p. 4 Notes References * Dixie Classic Dixie Classic (bowl game) Texas A&M; Aggies football bowl games Centre Colonels football bowl games Dixie Classic Dixie Classic ","title":"1922 Dixie Classic"},{"id":"18866755","text":"The Radio Amateur Association of Greece (RAAG) (in Greek, ŒàŒΩœâœÉŒπœÇ ŒïŒªŒªŒÆŒΩœâŒΩ Œ°Œ±Œ¥ŒπŒøŒµœÅŒ±œÉŒπœÑŒµœáŒΩœéŒΩ - ŒïŒïŒ°) is a national non-profit organization for amateur radio enthusiasts in Greece.

The given circles are shown in blue and red, which are the outermost and innermost circles, respectively. In geometry, a Steiner chain is a set of n circles, all of which are tangent to two given non-intersecting circles (blue and red in Figure 1), where n is finite and each circle in the chain is tangent to the previous and next circles in the chain. In the usual closed Steiner chains, the first and last (nth) circles are also tangent to each other; by contrast, in open Steiner chains, they need not be. The given circles Œ± and Œ≤ do not intersect, but otherwise are unconstrained; the smaller circle may lie completely inside or outside of the larger circle. In these cases, the centers of Steiner-chain circles lie on an ellipse or a hyperbola, respectively. Steiner chains are named after Jakob Steiner, who defined them in the 19th century and discovered many of their properties. A fundamental result is Steiner's porism, which states: ::If at least one closed Steiner chain of n circles exists for two given circles Œ± and Œ≤, then there is an infinite number of closed Steiner chains of n circles; and any circle tangent to Œ± and Œ≤ in the same way is a member of such a chain. \\"Tangent in the same way\\" means that the arbitrary circle is internally or externally tangent in the same way as a circle of the original Steiner chain. A porism is a type of theorem relating to the number of solutions and the conditions on it. Porisms often describe a geometrical figure that cannot exist unless a condition is met, but otherwise may exist in infinite number; another example is Poncelet's porism. The method of circle inversion is helpful in treating Steiner chains. Since it preserves tangencies, angles and circles, inversion transforms one Steiner chain into another of the same number of circles. One particular choice of inversion transforms the given circles Œ± and Œ≤ into concentric circles; in this case, all the circles of the Steiner chain have the same size and can \\"roll\\" around in the annulus between the circles similar to ball bearings. This standard configuration allows several properties of Steiner chains to be derived, e.g., its points of tangencies always lie on a circle. Several generalizations of Steiner chains exist, most notably Soddy's hexlet and Pappus chains.Ogilvy, p. 60. Definitions and types of tangency Image:Steiner_chain_7mer.svgThe 7 circles of this Steiner chain (black) are externally tangent to the inner given circle (red) but internally tangent to the outer given circle (blue). Image:Steiner_chain_7mer_all_external.svgThe 7 circles of this Steiner chain (black) are externally tangent to both given circles (red and blue), which lie outside one another. Image:Steiner_chain_8mer_all_but_one_external.svgSeven of the 8 circles of this Steiner chain (black) are externally tangent to both given circles (red and blue); the 8th circle is internally tangent to both. The two given circles Œ± and Œ≤ cannot intersect; hence, the smaller given circle must lie inside or outside the larger. The circles are usually shown as an annulus, i.e., with the smaller given circle inside the larger one. In this configuration, the Steiner-chain circles are externally tangent to the inner given circle and internally tangent to the outer circle. However, the smaller circle may also lie completely outside the larger one (Figure 2). The black circles of Figure 2 satisfy the conditions for a closed Steiner chain: they are all tangent to the two given circles and each is tangent to its neighbors in the chain. In this configuration, the Steiner-chain circles have the same type of tangency to both given circles, either externally or internally tangent to both. If the two given circles are tangent at a point, the Steiner chain becomes an infinite Pappus chain, which is often discussed in the context of the arbelos (shoemaker's knife), a geometric figure made from three circles. There is no general name for a sequence of circles tangent to two given circles that intersect at two points. Closed, open and multi-cyclic Image:Steiner_chain_9mer_annular.svgClosed Steiner chain of nine circles. The 1st and 9th circles are tangent. Image:Steiner_chain_open_9mer.svgOpen Steiner chain of nine circles. The 1st and 9th circles overlap. Image:Steiner_chain_double_17mer.svgMulticyclic Steiner chain of 17 circles in 2 wraps. The 1st and 17th circles touch. The two given circles Œ± and Œ≤ touch the n circles of the Steiner chain, but each circle Ck of a Steiner chain touches only four circles: Œ±, Œ≤, and its two neighbors, Ck‚àí1 and Ck+1. By default, Steiner chains are assumed to be closed, i.e., the first and last circles are tangent to one another. By contrast, an open Steiner chain is one in which the first and last circles, C1 and Cn, are not tangent to one another; these circles are tangent only to three circles. Multicyclic Steiner chains wrap around the inner circle more than once before closing, i.e., before being tangent to the initial circle. Closed Steiner chains are the systems of circles obtained as the circle packing theorem representation of a bipyramid. Annular case and feasibility criterion Image:Steiner_chain_3mer_annular.svg Image:Steiner_chain_6mer_annular.svg Image:Steiner_chain_9mer_annular.svg Image:Steiner_chain_12mer_annular.svg Image:Steiner_chain_20mer_annular.svg The radius of the Steiner circles is œÅ whereas those of the inner and outer given circles are r and R, respectively. The distance from the center of the inner circle to the center of a Steiner circle is (orange line segment). The simplest type of Steiner chain is a closed chain of n circles of equal size surrounding an inscribed circle of radius r; the chain of circles is itself surrounded by a circumscribed circle of radius R. The inscribed and circumscribed given circles are concentric, and the Steiner-chain circles lie in the annulus between them. By symmetry, the angle 2Œ∏ between the centers of the Steiner-chain circles is 360¬∞/n. Because Steiner chain circles are tangent to one another, the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii, here twice their radius œÅ. The bisector (green in Figure) creates two right triangles, with a central angle of . The sine of this angle can be written as the length of its opposite segment, divided by the hypotenuse of the right triangle : \\\\sin \\\\theta = \\\\frac{\\\\rho}{r + \\\\rho} Since Œ∏ is known from n, this provides an equation for the unknown radius œÅ of the Steiner-chain circles : \\\\rho = \\\\frac{r \\\\sin\\\\theta}{1 - \\\\sin\\\\theta} The tangent points of a Steiner chain circle with the inner and outer given circles lie on a line that pass through their common center; hence, the outer radius . These equations provide a criterion for the feasibility of a Steiner chain for two given concentric circles. A closed Steiner chain of n circles requires that the ratio of radii R/r of the given circles equal exactly : \\\\frac{R}{r} = 1 + \\\\frac{2 \\\\sin\\\\theta}{1 - \\\\sin\\\\theta} = \\\\frac{1 + \\\\sin\\\\theta}{1 - \\\\sin\\\\theta} = \\\\left[ \\\\sec \\\\theta + \\\\tan \\\\theta \\\\right]^{2} As shown below, this ratio-of-radii criterion for concentric given circles can be extended to all types of given circles by the inversive distance Œ¥ of the two given circles. For concentric circles, this distance is defined as a logarithm of their ratio of radii : \\\\delta = \\\\ln \\\\frac{R}{r} Using the solution for concentric circles, the general criterion for a Steiner chain of n circles can be written : \\\\delta = 2 \\\\ln \\\\left( \\\\sec\\\\theta + \\\\tan\\\\theta \\\\right). If a multicyclic annular Steiner chain has n total circles and wraps around m times before closing, the angle between Steiner- chain circles equals : \\\\theta = \\\\frac{m}{n} 180^{\\\\circ} In other respects, the feasibility criterion is unchanged. Properties under inversion File:Steiner chain 9mer annular angle2.svgTwo circles (pink and cyan) that are internally tangent to both given circles and whose centers are collinear with the center of the given circles intersect at the angle 2Œ∏. File:Steiner chain 9mer annular angle4.svgUnder inversion, these lines and circles become circles with the same intersection angle, 2Œ∏. The gold circles intersect the two given circles at right angles, i.e., orthogonally. File:Steiner chain 6mer tangent circles.svgThe circles passing through the mutual tangent points of the Steiner-chain circles are orthogonal to the two given circles and intersect one another at multiples of the angle 2Œ∏. File:Steiner chain 6mer orthogonal circles.svgThe circles passing through the tangent points of the Steiner-chain circles with the two given circles are orthogonal to the latter and intersect at multiples of the angle 2Œ∏. Circle inversion transforms one Steiner chain into another with the same number of circles. In the transformed chain, the tangent points between adjacent circles of the Steiner chain all lie on a circle, namely the concentric circle midway between the two fixed concentric circles. Since tangencies and circles are preserved under inversion, this property of all tangencies lying on a circle is also true in the original chain. This property is also shared with the Pappus chain of circles, which can be construed as a special limiting case of the Steiner chain. In the transformed chain, the tangent lines from O to the Steiner chain circles are separated by equal angles. In the original chain, this corresponds to equal angles between the tangent circles that pass through the center of inversion used to transform the original circles into a concentric pair. In the transformed chain, the n lines connecting the pairs of tangent points of the Steiner circles with the concentric circles all pass through O, the common center. Similarly, the n lines tangent to each pair of adjacent circles in the Steiner chain also pass through O. Since lines through the center of inversion are invariant under inversion, and since tangency and concurrence are preserved under inversion, the 2n lines connecting the corresponding points in the original chain also pass through a single point, O. Infinite family If even one closed Steiner chain is possible for two given circles (blue), then infinitely many Steiner chains are possible, all related by rotation. Their points of tangency always fall on a circle (orange). If the two given circles are nested, one inside the other, the centers of the Steiner chain circles (black) fall on an ellipse (red); otherwise, they fall on a hyperbola. A Steiner chain between two non-intersecting circles can always be transformed into another Steiner chain of equally sized circles sandwiched between two concentric circles. Therefore, any such Steiner chain belongs to an infinite family of Steiner chains related by rotation of the transformed chain about O, the common center of the transformed bounding circles. Elliptical/hyperbolic locus of centers The centers of the circles of a Steiner chain lie on a conic section. For example, if the smaller given circle lies within the larger, the centers lie on an ellipse. This is true for any set of circles that are internally tangent to one given circle and externally tangent to the other; such systems of circles appear in the Pappus chain, the problem of Apollonius, and the three-dimensional Soddy's hexlet. Similarly, if some circles of the Steiner chain are externally tangent to both given circles, their centers must lie on a hyperbola, whereas those that are internally tangent to both lie on a different hyperbola. The circles of the Steiner chain are tangent to two fixed circles, denoted here as Œ± and Œ≤, where Œ≤ is enclosed by Œ±. Let the radii of these two circles be denoted as rŒ± and rŒ≤, respectively, and let their respective centers be the points A and B. Let the radius, diameter and center point of the kth circle of the Steiner chain be denoted as rk, dk and Pk, respectively. All the centers of the circles in the Steiner chain are located on a common ellipse, for the following reason.Ogilvy, p. 57. The sum of the distances from the center point of the kth circle of the Steiner chain to the two centers A and B of the fixed circles equals a constant : \\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{P}_k\\\\mathbf{A}} + \\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{P}_k \\\\mathbf{B}} = (r_\\\\alpha - r_k) + \\\\left( r_\\\\beta + r_k \\\\right) = r_\\\\alpha + r_\\\\beta Thus, for all the centers of the circles of the Steiner chain, the sum of distances to A and B equals the same constant, rŒ± + rŒ≤. This defines an ellipse, whose two foci are the points A and B, the centers of the circles, Œ± and Œ≤, that sandwich the Steiner chain of circles. The sum of distances to the foci equals twice the semi-major axis a of an ellipse; hence, : 2a = r_\\\\alpha + r_\\\\beta Let p equal the distance between the foci, A and B. Then, the eccentricity e is defined by 2 ae = p, or : e = \\\\frac{p}{2a} = \\\\frac{p}{r_{\\\\alpha} + r_{\\\\beta}} From these parameters, the semi-minor axis b and the semi-latus rectum L can be determined : b^2 = a^2 \\\\left( 1 - e^2 \\\\right) = a^2 - \\\\frac{p^2}{4} : L = \\\\frac{b^2}{a} = a - \\\\frac{p^2}{4a} Therefore, the ellipse can be described by an equation in terms of its distance d to one focus : d = \\\\frac{L}{1 - e \\\\cos \\\\theta} where Œ∏ is the angle with the line joining the two foci. Conjugate chains Image:Steiner_chain_4mer_outside3.svgSteiner chain with the two given circles shown in red and blue. Image:Steiner_chain_4mer_outside2.svgSame set of circles, but with a different choice of given circles. Image:Steiner_chain_4mer_outside.svgSame set of circles, but with yet another choice of given circles. If a Steiner chain has an even number of circles, then any two diametrically opposite circles in the chain can be taken as the two given circles of a new Steiner chain to which the original circles belong. If the original Steiner chain has n circles in m wraps, and the new chain has p circles in q wraps, then the equation holds : \\\\frac{m}{n} + \\\\frac{p}{q} = \\\\frac{1}{2}. A simple example occurs for Steiner chains of four circles (n = 4) and one wrap (m = 1). In this case, the given circles and the Steiner-chain circles are equivalent in that both types of circles are tangent to four others; more generally, Steiner-chain circles are tangent to four circles, but the two given circles are tangent to n circles. In this case, any pair of opposite members of the Steiner chain may be selected as the given circles of another Steiner chain that involves the original given circles. Since m = p = 1 and n = q = 4, Steiner's equation is satisfied: : \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{1}{4} = \\\\frac{1}{2}. Generalizations Soddy's hexlet is a three-dimensional analog of the Steiner chain. The simplest generalization of a Steiner chain is to allow the given circles to touch or intersect one another. In the former case, this corresponds to a Pappus chain, which has an infinite number of circles. Soddy's hexlet is a three-dimensional generalization of a Steiner chain of six circles. The centers of the six spheres (the hexlet) travel along the same ellipse as do the centers of the corresponding Steiner chain. The envelope of the hexlet spheres is a Dupin cyclide, the inversion of a torus. The six spheres are not only tangent to the inner and outer sphere, but also to two other spheres, centered above and below the plane of the hexlet centers. Multiple rings of Steiner chains are another generalization. An ordinary Steiner chain is obtained by inverting an annular chain of tangent circles bounded by two concentric circles. This may be generalized to inverting three or more concentric circles that sandwich annular chains of tangent circles. Hierarchical Steiner chains are yet another generalization. If the two given circles of an ordinary Steiner chain are nested, i.e., if one lies entirely within the other, then the larger given circle circumscribes the Steiner-chain circles. In a hierarchical Steiner chain, each circle of a Steiner chain is itself the circumscribing given circle of another Steiner chain within it; this process may be repeated indefinitely, forming a fractal.

Route description Hamblen County SR 160 begins as a primary highway at an intersection with US 11E/SR 34 (W Andrew Johnson Highway)in a concurrency with SR 342 in Morristown, heading southeastward as a 4-lane divided highway, serving essentially as a southern bypass of Morristown. SR 342 (Alpha Valley Home Road) exits after SR 160 curves more eastwardly, and has an intersection with SR 474 (Merchants Greene Boulevard) shortly afterwards. The highway then has a short concurrency with SR 66. SR 160 continues east to have an interchange with SR 343 (S Cumberland Street) before coming to an interchange with US 25E/SR 32 (S Davy Crockett Parkway; Exit 1 on US 25E). SR 160 then leaves Morristown and has an intersection with SR 113 before coming to an interchange with Interstate 81 (Exit 12 on I-81) in Lowland, where it turns secondary, narrows to 2-lanes, and continues through farmland before crossing the Nolichucky River into Cocke County. Cocke County SR 160 enters the mountains and passes by Briarwood Ranch Safari Park before passing through Bybee as it exits the mountains and re enters farmland. The highway then winds its way southeast along the banks of the French Broad River to enter Community Newport and come to an end at an intersection with US 321/SR 35 east of downtown. Widening project Prior to the extension of the highway, SR 160's original northern terminus was at TN State Route 343, also known as South Cumberland Street and Old US Highway 25E. Construction of the four-laned section began in 1990 and it took roughly two years to complete, passing through a number of hills and valleys, requiring extensive bridges. The first few miles of the highway took over part of Tennessee State Route 342. The four lane section goes from US 11E in Morristown to 1.7 miles south of Interstate 81.

A member of GroenLinks (GL), she replaced Wijnand Duyvendak as a member of the House of Representatives on 3 September 2008, after his resignation. She had temporarily been replacing Mariko Peters from the previous day who was on parental leave. From 16 December 2010 to 5 October 2012 she was party leader as well as parliamentary leader in the House of Representatives, replacing Femke Halsema who announced her retirement from politics as of that date.  Education  Sap studied economics at the Tilburg University between 1981 and 1989 where she specialised in political economy and philosophy.  Career  Between 1985 and 1988 Sap was a student assistant and coordinator at the department of development cooperation. She continued to work at the University of Amsterdam as researcher for three years. She studied the difference in pay between men and women. After that she became a research associate at the government Council for Emancipation. She initiated \\"Out of the Margin\\": two international conferences on feminist economics in 1992 and 1998. This led to a book, Out of the Margin. Feminist Perspectives on Economics, which she edited with Susan Feiner. Since 1993 she was active within GroenLinks, as member of its economic committee. In 1996 she started to work at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment, where she advised top civil servants on emancipation and lifetime- planning policy (combining labour, care and education throughout life), in addition to salary, income and pension policy. In 2003 she left the ministry to become director of LEEFtijd (LIFEtime). She reoriented LEEFtijd on new issues such as the demographic developments in the Netherlands and lifetime- planning policy. In 2006 she co-authored GroenLinks's election program. She was put on the eighth place of the list of the House of Representatives for the 2006 election. The party only won seven seats. In 2007 she became a member of the panel on principles of the Van Ojik committee, which would organise the discussion leading to a new manifesto of principles. In 2008 she left LEEFtijd for a sabbatical. In August 2008 it was announced that she would replace Wijnand Duyvendak, who was leaving the House of Representatives. After national elections on 12 September 2012 the size of the representation of the GroenLinks party within the House of Representatives was reduced from 10 seats to 4 seats. On 5 October 2012 Jolande Sap was forced to step down as Leader in the House of Representatives by the party board. Some days later Bram van Ojik became the new Leader in the House of Representatives. Sap is a specialist on social-economic issues. She values economic independence as an important condition for freedom. She seeks to stimulate emancipation and fight social exclusion.

The airfield was home to the 283rd Aviation Division of the 34th Air Army. The Russians retained control of a number of military bases even after Georgian independence. Vaziani was one of them, the others being Gudauta, Akhalkalaki and Batumi. It was from Vaziani that Igor Giorgadze was taken on a military flight to Moscow after the 1995 assassination attempt on President Eduard Shevardnadze. At the OSCE Summit in Istanbul in 1999, the Russian Federation and Georgia released a joint statement that Russian military bases at Gudauta and Vaziani would be disbanded and withdrawn by 1 July 2001. Russia finally ceded control on June 29, 2001. A battalion of Georgia's 1st Infantry Brigade, Georgian Land Forces, then took possession. In July 2008, it was the site of Immediate Response 2008, which were U.S. training operations for Georgian forces. It was bombed during the 2008 Russo-Georgian War.

Females acquire one X-chromosome from their father and one from their mother, and this means they can either be heterozygous for the mutated allele or homozygous. If heterozygous, she is a carrier of the mutated allele because the disease is recessive. If homozygous, she has the disease. An affected father with an X-linked recessive trait will always pass the trait on to the daughter. Therefore, all daughters of an affected male are obligate carriers. On the other hand, a carrier mother has a 50% chance of passing her mutated X-chromosome to the daughter. This makes all daughters of carrier mothers possible carriers but not necessarily obligate carriers. Males cannot be obligate or possible carriers of X-linked recessive traits because they only have one X-chromosome, and so are always phenotypically affected when receiving the mutated X-chromosome from their mother. Females that are heterozygous for X-linked recessive disorders are obligate carriers, but can never be phenotypically affected, and this is because of X-inactivation. Heterozygous females have an X-chromosome from each parent; one with a mutated gene and one with a functional copy of the same gene. When the mutated chromosome is randomly inactivated in order to maintain the copy number, presence of the functional copy results in a normal phenotype. Males only have one copy of any gene on the X-chromosome, and because they do not undergo X-inactivation, they only have the mutated gene. As a result, these types of diseases most commonly phenotypically affect males and rarely females. Hemophilia Hemophilia, or haemophilia, is an X-linked recessive disorder that impairs the body's control over blood clotting. Haemophilia A and Haemophilia B arise from mutations in the genes for factor VIII and factor IX, respectively. Females with this disease are almost exclusively unaffected, obligate carriers. The mutations can be passed on to offspring by mothers and fathers, but the phenotype is only expressed in males that inherit the mutation. All daughters of a hemophiliac father are obligate carriers of the disease. Autosomal Recessive In an autosomal recessive disease, if an individual is heterozygous for the mutant allele, they are a carrier because the disease is recessive. If homozygous, they have the disease. All offspring of an affected individual are either heterozygous or homozygous for the mutated allele. Consequently, all unaffected (heterozygous) offspring of an affected individual are obligate carriers of the disease because they will necessarily carry the mutated allele. Detection Due to the predictable patterns of heritable disorders, techniques can be used to detect past, present, and future disease prevalence in individuals among a family. Specifically, pedigrees and laboratory methods are used to search for and predict obligate carriers for a specific disease such as hemophilia. After analysis of family history, one way to be completely sure that an individual is an obligate carrier is through genetic tests, such as mutational analysis. This allows professionals to see if the specific mutation exists in the chromosome of the individual. In potential hemophiliacs, factor assays are used to measure the amount of blood clotting in an individual. However, some carriers might have completely normal clotting levels and so this method is not always useful. Genetic counselling informs patients that may have a family history of a certain disease about their risk of disease and potential risk in their children.

It extended for from U.S. Route 9 (US 9) and NY 9A in Yonkers to US 1 in the New York City borough of the Bronx. The route ran mostly along the New York City line and indirectly met both the Saw Mill River Parkway and the New York State Thruway in Yonkers. NY 164 followed McLean Avenue in Yonkers and Nereid and Baychester Avenues in the Bronx. The NY 164 designation was assigned to provide a signed route to the 1939‚Äì1940 New York World's Fair held in Queens. Originally, it began at the northern approach to the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge and followed Eastern Boulevard (now the path of the Bruckner Expressway) north to Baychester Avenue. As the Bruckner Expressway (Interstate 95 or I-95) was constructed in the 1960s, NY 164 was gradually truncated northward. The southern terminus was shifted north to the Bruckner Expressway's interchange with Gun Hill Road , resulting in a partial realignment of NY 164, and to the junction of US 1 and Baychester Avenue by 1964. By 1970, the New York State Department of Transportation had completely removed the NY 164 designation, allowing it to be reassigned to another highway in Putnam County. During the peak of expressway and parkway construction in New York City in the 1960s, a proposal was made to construct an expressway that would parallel the northern segment of NY 164\\\\. The proposed highway, known as the City Line Expressway, never advanced past the planning stages. Route description NY 164 began at an intersection with US 9 and NY 9A (Broadway) in the Westchester County city of Yonkers. The highway headed southeastward as McLean Avenue, passing Sutherland Park and Pelton Park as it approached Van Cortlandt Park and the northern boundary of New York City. Just before the route reached the city line, it made a U-turn to the north and interchanged with the Saw Mill River Parkway by way of Putnam Avenue. East of Putnam Avenue, the route paralleled the city line southeast to Central Park Avenue, the latter split into two one-way streets as it served as service roads for the New York State Thruway. Past the Thruway, NY 164 followed a more pronounced southeasterly alignment and entered the New York City borough of the Bronx, where it became known as Nereid Avenue. The route crossed the Bronx River and proceeded eastward through the Wakefield neighborhood of the Bronx to an intersection with Baychester Avenue. Here, NY 164 turned onto the aforementioned street and followed it southeastward through the northern Bronx. The route crossed East 233rd Street and went past Seton Falls Park just before it ended at a junction with US 1 (Boston Post Road). History NY 164 was assigned to provide a signed route to the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge and the 1939‚Äì1940 New York World's Fair in Queens from Westchester County and the Bronx. The route began concurrent with NY 1A at the north approach to the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge and followed NY 1A north on Eastern Boulevard, now the path of the Bruckner Expressway. NY 1A and NY 164 split at the location of modern exit 8A, and NY 164 continued northwest on Baychester Avenue into the northern portion of the Bronx. At Nereid Avenue, NY 164 turned west, following Nereid and McLean Avenues to Broadway, where it ended at US 9 and NY 9A. The designation remained in place even after the World's Fair had concluded. In the mid-1940s, NY 1A was realigned to follow the recently completed Hutchinson River Parkway Extension through the eastern Bronx, eliminating the overlap between NY 1A and NY 164. The routing of NY 164 itself remained unchanged until , when the section of Eastern Boulevard (by this time known as Bruckner Boulevard) between Pelham Parkway and the Bruckner Interchange was upgraded into the Bruckner Expressway. Initially, there was no change to NY 164's routing as it followed the new highway from the Bronx- Whitestone Bridge to modern exit 12 (Baychester Avenue); however, by the following year, this section of the Bruckner Expressway was redesignated as part of I-95. As part of the change, NY 164 now began at exit 9 of the Bruckner Expressway and followed Gun Hill Road west to US 1\\\\. The two routes then embarked on an overlap northeast to Baychester Avenue, where NY 164 joined its previous alignment. By 1964, NY 164 was truncated again, this time to the northeastern terminus of its overlap with US 1. The designation was removed entirely by 1970, allowing it to be reassigned to another road in Putnam County. Most of NY 164's former routing is currently maintained by the cities it passed through (New York City and Yonkers); the only part that is not city-maintained is the bridge carrying McLean Avenue over the Saw Mill River Parkway in Yonkers, which is maintained by Westchester County as the unsigned County Route 127. In the mid-1960s, the Regional Plan Association (RPA) and the Tri-State Transportation Commission proposed that an expressway be built along East 223rd Street through the Woodlawn and Wakefield neighborhoods of the Bronx. The highway, known as the City Line Expressway, may have become a realignment of NY 164 if completed. The idea did not advance past the planning stages and was shelved in the late 1960s when Robert Moses was removed from his post as New York City's arterial coordinator.

He heard about the 1896 Summer Olympics, the first of the modern era, and later explained \\"Greek classics were my proper academic field, so I could hardly resist a go at the Olympics, could I?\\" On arrival in Athens, he found to his dismay that his discipline of hammer throwing was not to be competed in, so in the spirit of amateurism he entered the shot put, the discus and the tennis. In the discus, he recorded the Games' worst ever throw, and in the tennis doubles he lost his only match but nevertheless won a Bronze Medal.

It features twin Stromberg NA-Y5-G carburetors,Berndt, p.190. dual magnetos and twin spark plugs making up a full dual ignition system, and crossflow induction.Berndt, pp.190 & 193. It displaces and puts out well over of torque from idle to 2,200 rpm. The factory-rated gross output was at 2,600 rpm. The GAA powered several models and derivatives of the M4A3 Sherman medium tank. Development Immediately preceding World War II, Ford developed an aircraft engine similar to that of the American Allison V-12 V-1710. It was a 60 degree V-12 of 1,650 cubic inch displacement with a matching set of cylinder bore/piston stroke figures to the Rolls-Royce Merlin aviation engine, using an aluminum block and head; dual overhead camshafts, and four valves per cylinder. The intention of this design was to help Ford break into the anticipated large market for fighter aircraft engines. This engine was built to typical aircraft standards: it was light, high performance, and highly reliable. Everything was safety wired or staked with close attention to detail on every part. Available information suggests this design performed well. However, it never went into production as an aircraft engine due to the United States Navy's decision to only use radial engines for its aircraft and the Army's contractual commitments to existing manufacturers. With the approach of war, increasing orders for M4 Sherman tanks were causing supply issues with the 9-cylinder radial Wright R-975 Whirlwind engine used. The U.S. Army decided it needed to source additional engine suppliers, choosing a version of the Ford GAA cut down from twelve cylinders to eight for various vehicle applications.  Production  All- aluminum Ford GAF V8 tank engine, next to an M26 Pershing, The Tank Museum * The GAA was used in the M4A3 (1,690), M4A3(75)W (3,071), M4A3(76)W (1,400), M4A3 (105) (500), M4A3E2 (254), M4A3(76)W HVSS (3,142), M4A3(105) HVSS (2,539), M10A1 (1,413), and M7B1 (826). * The GAF powered the M26 (2,222), M26A1, T28/T95 (2), and M45 (185). * The GAN powered the T23 (248) and M4A3E2 (254). * In order to meet the need for a larger engine, Ford resurrected the V-12 version as the GAC, which produced and powered the T29, T32 (6). *A number of M74 tank recovery vehicles were rebuilt from M4A3s, which used the GAA.Berndt, p.193.

When first established, the park comprised only the mountainous terrain above Jackson Hole, while the remainder of what would eventually become the park was administered by the Forest Service as part of Teton National Forest. The Jackson Lake Station was built in 1933 as close as possible to Park Service property as possible as a kind of resistance to the park's expansion. The station was one of five Forest Service stations in the area, and was taken over by the National Park Service when Jackson Hole National Monument was established in 1943, later becoming an enlarged Grand Teton National Park. It is the only such station not to have been moved or altered by the Park Service. Description The ranger station building is a 1-1/2 story log structure typical of the rustic bungalow style used by the Forest Service for its buildings of the era. An outhouse, 1-1/2 story garage and 2-1/2 story barn complete the grouping. The site is on the Teton Park Road overlooking the Willow Flats and Jackson Lake. Of the five Forest Service ranger stations in the area, the Jackson Lake station is the only one not to have been moved or rebuilt after the Park Service takeover. Forest Service vs. Park Service The enlargement of Grand Teton National Park was the subject of bitter disagreement in the local population and of resentment in the Forest Service, which had opposed the transfer. When the Forest Service vacated the Jackson Lake station in 1943 it took all of the station's furnishings and fixtures, interpreting \\"movable equipment\\" to include piping, plumbing fixtures, doors and cabinets. A four-foot wide hole was cut in the floor to remove an underground water tank, leaving the building in poor condition. In advance of a visit by congressmen in 1943 a live skunk was placed in the building, dying there.

The village of Lac-Cayamant is located at the north end of Lake Cayamant, west of Gracefield. It was formerly known as the Township Municipality of Dorion, named after Antoine-Aim√© Dorion (1818-1891). It was renamed to the Municipality of Cayamant at the end of 1988, due to many problems created by having the identical name to that of the city of Dorion (which merged with neighbouring Vaudreuil in 1994). The new name refers to the largest lake in its territory, Lake Cayamant. The Algonquin term Kakgama, Kandikagamaw, or Kandikagama means \\"porcupine\\". Alternatively, it may come from Kantuagama, which means lake with a large bay. The village has a primary school, a church, and some convenience stores, restaurants and some basic commerce. Most of the population lives near the lake. The most populated street is \\"Rue Principale\\" (Main Street). History Between 1890 and 1900, a few settlers moved to the shores of Cayamant Lake, becoming home to a flood of French Canadians who were heading to the west of the province in search of farmland. In 1902, the \\"Lake Cayamont\\" post office opened (renamed in 1943 to Lake Cayamant). The Township Municipality of Dorion was formed on October 10, 1906. The first municipal council was elected on October 17, 1906. In 1918, the parish of Saint-Roch-du-Lac Cayamant was established. In 1988, Dorion was renamed to Cayamant.

It attaches itself to rocks using a strong byssus composed of many silk-like threads which used to be made into cloth. The animal secretes these fibres from its byssus gland; they consist of keratin and other proteins and may be as long as . The inside of the shell is lined with brilliant mother-of- pearl.Tyndale (1849): The Island of Sardinia, including Pictures of the Manners and Customs of the Sardinians, . . . Three Volumes. John Warre Tyndale. London: Richard Bentley. pp. 77‚Äì79. As with other members of its genus, Pinna nobilis hosts symbiotic shrimp which live inside its shell. It is believed that when it sees a threat, the shrimp warns the host, perhaps by retracting its claws or even by pinching. The clam then closes shut. It has been demonstrated that the shrimp has a similar filter-feeding diet to its host and the relationship is likely mutualistic.

See Section 12 plus \\"Appendix B ‚Äì Sea Silk\\". pp. 468‚Äì476.  Threats  In 2016, there was an outbreak of a disease that caused the mortality of 99% of population in Spain. The cause of the disease is a newly discovered pathogen, Haplosporidium pinnae and it is posing a serious threat to the survival of the species. By 2019, mortality spots have been detected in Greece, Croatia, Turkey, Tunisia, France and Morocco. In the past, Pinna nobilis has been threatened with extinction, due in part to fishing, incidental killing by trawling and anchoring, and the decline in seagrass fields; pollution kills eggs, larvae, and adult mussels. Such threats, however, have been very localised and have not led to such a widespread and rapid population decline. The pathogen, which is still present in the environment, will make recovery a challenge, so continuing declines are expected. The percentage of population size reduction over the last ten years is over 80%. In December 2019, Pinna Nobilis has entered the IUCN Red List as critically endangered. The noble pen shell has been listed as an endangered species in the Mediterranean Sea. The European Council Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC, on conservation of natural habitats and the wild fauna and flora, proclaims that P. nobilis is strictly protected (by the Annex IV of EEC, 1992) ‚Äì all forms of deliberate capture or killing of fan mussel specimens are prohibited by law.Centoducati, G., Tarsitano, E., Bottalico, A., Marvulli, M., Lai, O., Crescenzo, G.

TRAC published a monthly electronics magazine, which became a reference journal in Turkey for those who wanted to learn about electronics. The magazine was recommended by the Ministry of Education as a learning aid. TRAC began lobbying the government for amateur radio regulations two years after its formation. Two attempts to establish an amateur radio service in Turkey were made in 1964 and again in 1966. Joint proposals by the Ministry of Defence, TRAC, and the Electric Engineers' Association, these efforts to change the existing law found their way to a parliamentary commission but were never put into the legislative agenda. Amateur radio regulations were finally established in 1983 with the passage of the Wireless Act. Historically, Turkey has suffered major natural disasters in which many have perished. Amateur radio's crucial importance and efficiency in establishing emergency communications during disasters and emergencies was cited as a main reason for establishing an active amateur radio service in Turkey.

She was transferred to the United States Navy in 1947, and the Navy assigned her to support the needs of the Pacific Ocean Trust Territory created as a result of the war. Whidbey served the medical needs of natives and military personnel in the Trust Territory, and, when war broke out during the Korean War, Whidbey turned her attention to the tropical diseases contracted by American military personnel, treating their diseases before releasing them to return stateside. Built for the U.S. Army in Alabama FS-395‚Äîan inter-island freighter and cargo vessel completed for the United States Army on 2 January 1945 at Decatur, Alabama, by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp.‚Äîwas subsequently inspected by the Navy and accepted for service at the Naval Operating Base (NOB), Subic Bay, Philippine Islands, on 22 February 1947. FS-395 was later given the name Whidbey and classified a miscellaneous auxiliary, AG-141; she was commissioned at Naval Operating Base (NOB), Guam, while moored alongside SS Hamilton Victory on 8 August 1947, Chief Boatswain J. W. Jamieson in command. Supporting World War II Trust Territory Later assigned to Service Division 51, Service Force, Pacific Fleet, Whidbey initially performed service under the auspices of the Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet, who was given the collateral duty of High Commissioner of the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands, assigned by the United Nations to the United States after World War II. Whidbey carried passengers, provisions, and mail to the islands in the territories, returning to Guam with copra and other native products. Caught and damaged in a storm A highlight of Whidbey's first year in commission occurred shortly before Christmas of 1947. At 0945 on 22 December, the ship began doubling up all lines in anticipation of an approaching storm, while she was moored alongside the district oiler, YO-104, at Tomil Harbor, Yap Island; and at 1605 got underway for Guam, standing out to sea as the wind and sea began to rise menacingly. By 2200, the ship was maneuvering at various courses and speeds to keep headed into the wind; by 2330 the situation looked critical‚Äîall hands were ordered to don life jackets! Whidbey fought the sea into the next morning. At 0042, a fire broke out in the bilges. Shutting down the port main engine, the auxiliary's crew battled the small fire for only a short time before they succeeded in putting it out, while, topside, heavy seas carried away one of the snip's lifeboats. The craft's port engine came to life only briefly before it had to be secured‚Äîleaving the ship operating on only one engine. By 0413, heavy waves were breaking over the port and starboard sides of the ship; changing course at that instant, Whidbey suddenly ground onto a reef at 0418. All hands manned their abandon ship stations to prepare for any eventuality should the ship have foundered; but soundings were taken, and it looked as if the ship was on an even keel and not taking any water. Salvaging the grounded ship Whidbey remained aground off the east coast of Yap, with no hope in sight until the afternoon of Christmas Day, when hove in sight at 1229. After spending the afternoon in trying to pull Whidbey off the reef, Tawakoni secured salvage operations that evening, but resumed them the next morning. Ultimately, Tawakoni succeeded in her task, towing Whidbey approximately and moving her astern on the 27th. On the 28th, the fleet tug set out for Guam at 1836 with the crippled auxiliary in tow. The little convoy arrived safely at Guam on the afternoon of the 31st. Once repaired, Whidbey received a new task‚Äîa humanitarian mission. In an effort to look into the health and welfare of the inhabitants of all of the populated islands within the two and one-half million square miles of the Trust Territory, the Navy began a medical survey of those isles in 1948. Converted to a mini-hospital Converted from a small cargo vessel to a specially equipped floating clinic, Whidbey's medical technicians \\"surveyed\\" thousands of islanders‚Äîmen, women, and children‚Äîconducting parasitology tests, providing dental care, and taking blood tests and X-rays. Her medical teams not only provided those services on board ship, but also ashore as well, visiting the sick and the aged. Whidbey's performance of duty enabled the Navy to ascertain a complete picture of both the common and the rare diseases that occurred in the territories. Whidbeys duties as a floating clinic came to an end with the completion of her last survey in late April 1951. Not only had Whidbey performed significant and helpful medical services to and for the islanders of the Trust Territories, but she had also gathered useful hydrographic data in the course of her cruises throughout the many isles of the territories. Conversion to epidemiological disease control ship When the Navy relinquished its administrative duties to the U.S. Department of the Interior, Whidbey's role changed; her operations took on a different complexion in light of the Korean War that had broken out in the summer of 1950. Whidbey, the value of her past service as a mini-hospital ship proved by experience in the Trust Territories, was overhauled at Yokosuka and converted from a medical survey vessel to a Fleet epidemiological disease control ship, becoming, in effect, a modern floating laboratory, with equipment and trained technicians capable of analyzing the most minute organism. Deployed to Yokosuka, Japan, a port through which United States Marines were being rotated back to the United States from the combat zones in Korea, Whidbey's embarked Fleet Epidemiological Disease Control Unit No. 2 processed the homeward-bound marines for dysentery, malaria, or any other parasites contracted at the front. After the ship's medical team had obtained the samples, the marines sailed for the United States. Working almost 24-hour shifts to obtain the results in minimum time, Whidbey's technicians then dispatched a report of results to the port of embarkation for each individual processed. As each transport arrived at her destination, quarantine officials there would thus be ready to treat whatever parasitical disease any marine had brought back from Korea. That process enabled those who had contracted malaria or any dormant infections to be cured before they returned to stateside posts or civilian life. China area operations On 3 January 1952, Whidbey sailed for Taiwan (formerly Formosa) and carried out port visits to Keelung and Kaohsiung. She then shifted to the Nationalist Chinese naval base at Tsoying where, as \\"an ambassadress of good will and good health\\" she remained from 28 January to 5 May, her doctors working with those of the Chinese Navy. After touching at the Chinese naval base in the Pescadores, at Makung, until 15 May, Whidbey stopped briefly at Kaohsiung before she visited Hong Kong, en route to Sasebo. Whidbey again operated at Nationalist Chinese naval installations on Taiwan that summer. Whidbey remained in the Far East, principally at Kobe and Yokosuka, through December 1953 and, placed in reserve on 1 July 1954, was assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet for overhaul and inactivation. Post-Korean War decommissioning She was decommissioned on 15 November 1954. Placed in the Columbia River group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet, she remained there into the late 1950s. Struck from the Navy List on 1 May 1959, the unique craft was sold to Albert Heller on 31 May 1960 and subsequently scrapped.

Only one such vessel was constructed‚ÄîErnest Bazin, named for its inventor ‚Äîwhich was found to be impractical. Design An artist's impression of a full-scale Bazin roller liner The principle behind the design was similar to that of the slightly later hydrofoil; by avoiding as much hull contact with the water as possible, the amount of drag could be reduced and - in theory - the vessel could be made to move much faster for a given amount of power. As envisaged by Bazin, the main hull was lifted out of the water, with large hollow discs attached to each side. These discs would provide the buoyancy of the ship, as well as part of its propulsive power. These wheels were independently driven, with a separate screw lowered into the water from the hull to propel the boat.\\"The \\"Bazin\\" Roller Boat. Nature 55, 379 - 380 (18 Feb 1897). The discs were lenticular: they tapered to a point, like the hulls of ships. Indeed, when pushed forwards through the water, without any rotational movement, they behaved exactly like a conventional hull. When rotated, however, they proved in testing to be much more efficient, due to the propulsive force being expended both vertically and horizontally. It was found that the overall speed ought to be roughly two-thirds the speed of rotation of the wheels. History An early attempt to produce such a ship was made in the early 1880s by Robert Fryer, who built the Alice at a cost of some ¬£14,000 after twelve years of experimentation. It consisted of three paddle wheels in a rough triangular layout, with a flat deck mounted above them; there was apparently no other propulsion. The project was a complete failure, perhaps due to the lack of any propulsion other than the paddles.p. 71, The Story Of The Paddle Steamer, by Bernard Dumpleton. Intellect Books, 2002. The completed Ernest-Bazin, 1897 The first and only operational roller ship, the 280-ton Ernest-Bazin, was designed by the French inventor Ernest Bazin after five years of model-based tests and launched at Saint-Denis on August 19, 1896. Le dr√¥le de bateau de M. Bazin (the funny boat of Mr Bazin) It had three pairs of discs ten-metres in diameter and three-metres thick; each pair was independently driven by a fifty-horsepower engine and, under normal conditions, about one-third submerged. The main hull was supported just above the axes of these discs, 4m above the sea level, and was about 40 by 12 metres; it contained the engines as well as the crew housing.\\"The French Roller Ship\\". Article in the New York Times, August 30th, 1896. Online copy Bazin predicted the ship would be able to make about eighteen knots, perhaps pushing twenty at full power, but hoped that a ship of similar build with the power that could propel a convention ship to 20 knots could achieve speeds of 47 knots;Walzenschiff, Brockhaus Enzyklop√§die, edition 14 many observers estimated, however, that the design was theoretically capable of thirty-two knots based on the size and power of the wheels and on early model tests. This compared very favourably with contemporary steamships; the fast ocean liners of the day could manage slightly over twenty knots, whilst high-powered military Torpedo boat destroyers could break thirty.\\"A Steamer on Wheels\\", by James Walter Smith. p. 552-558: The Strand Magazine, Vol. 12, no. 70. (Oct. 1896). Online copy (PDF) The fuel consumption was also anticipated to be sharply reduced; a full-scale vessel was predicted by Bazin to consume only 800 tons of coal for a thirty-knot Atlantic crossing, compared to 3000-4000 tons for a 22-knot crossing by a conventional liner.Note in Nature 55, p.109 (03 Dec 1896), The Ernest-Bazin was a test ship, meant to test the design. If its test succeeded, a roller ship with 4 disc pairs was to be constructed to transport passengers from Le Havre to New York City. However, when preparing to cross the English Channel in early 1897, the design was found to be unworkable. When the rollers rotated through the water, each one brought up so much water adhering to it that it was braked heavily, causing them to rotate much more slowly than anticipated and with a much greater consumption of fuel.\\"Ernest Bazin dead in France\\". Article in the New York Times, January 22nd, 1898. Online copyNote in Nature 56, p.500 (23 Sep 1897), Bazin died on January 21, 1898, a few weeks after announcing he had overcome these problems, and revealing plans for an ocean-going liner, with four pairs of discs, which would be able to cross from Le Havre to New York in sixty hours. The idea briefly resurfaced in the 1930s, with proposed designs for a large \\"tricycle\\" liner appearing in Modern Mechanix in 1934,\\"Turbo Wheel Liners to Speed Across Seas\\", Modern Mechanix, June 1934.

In 1897, Frederick Knapp, a lawyer in Prescott, Ontario, designed another type of vessel which he termed a \\"roller boat\\"; this was essentially a single long cylinder which sat in the water. An engine inside, supported on rotating bearings, caused the outer surface of the cylinder to rotate, acting as a paddle wheel. However, it suffered much the same flaws as Bazin's design; the hypothetical \\"mile a minute\\" was, in practice, no more than five knots, and the vessel proved difficult to control. After trials, the prototype was tied up at the harbour for ten years, before being sold as scrap.

The property is owned by Downtown Railyard Ventures, LLC. The Sacramento Railyards was master-planned by the Jerde Partnership firm. Construction will take 15 to 20 years with a projected build-out to last until the late 2020s. The site is equivalent in size to the existing downtown central business district and holds significant historical and cultural importance to Sacramento. The project features the preservation and partial reuse of the \\"Central Shops\\" buildings originally used for railroad maintenance and the former Southern Pacific Sacramento Depot; now known as Sacramento Valley Station. One of the Central Shops will be refitted into a public marketplace. Overall, the project is expected to include 12,000 housing units, of office uses, of retail, hotel, and other commercial uses, of parks and open space, a 25,000-seat Major League Soccer stadium for Sacramento Republic FC, a 1.3 million square foot, 17.8 acre Kaiser Permanente flagship medical center campus, a 540,000 square-foot courthouse, and create 19,000 permanent jobs.

Judah's efforts to realize a transcontinental railroad was transferred to the power of \\"The Big Four\\" investors, who created the Central Pacific Railroad. The First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, when Central Pacific's line joined Union Pacific's at Promontory Summit.

Central Pacific merged with Southern Pacific in 1870, and the former's maintenance yards were expanded with the addition of the Southern Pacific shops. The shops were used for locomotive repairs, general maintenance and, occasionally, creation. The yards steadily expanded, becoming the biggest railroad facility west of the Mississippi River and employing approximately one-third of all Sacramento workers in the early decades of the 20th century.The Railyards: Facts.

A 2007 Memorandum of understanding gives DTSC oversight over remediation procedures and ensures the site is remediated to target levels. The redevelopment phasing has been allotted into five phases; the first phase, infrastructure building, is currently under construction.  The Plan  The plan for the Railyards project is to expand the role of the Central City as Sacramento‚Äôs regional destination for employment; commerce; government; sports and entertainment; housing; and education, culture, and tourism and to create a transit‚Äêoriented mixed‚Äêuse district as an integral extension of the Central Business District. The Sacramento Railyards plan is to create a dynamic 24‚Äêhour mixed‚Äêuse, urban environment that provides a range of complementary uses, including cultural, office, hospitality, sports and entertainment, retail, healthcare, educational, and open space; and a mixture of housing products, including affordable housing. The Railyards has been historically isolated from the City of Sacramento. The project developers now want to integrate the area by connecting the Railyards with Sacramento‚Äôs downtown office, retail, tourism, residential, and government centers, as well as Old Sacramento, the River District area, and the adjacent Alkali Flat neighborhood using pedestrian and bicycle connections, roadways, and public transportation routes. The plan will transform the Railyards from an underutilized and environmentally contaminated industrial site into a transit‚Äêoriented, attractive, and nationally renowned mixed‚Äêuse urban environment. By focusing on regional employment opportunities, cultural destinations, and high‚Äêquality residential neighborhoods, the Railyards calls for improved land use efficiency and reduced GHG emissions through a healthy jobs‚Äêhousing balance; multi‚Äêmodal connectivity; urban centers with jobs, housing, shopping, services, and transit; and advanced green building practices. Implementation of this Plan will create a unique mixed‚Äêuse development consisting of regional destinations, commercial uses, office development, hotels, sports, entertainment and retail uses, with high‚Äêdensity residential neighborhoods that provide opportunities to live and work in the Central City and are supported by urban parks and plazas.  The Central Shops District  The proposed Railyards plan includes five neighborhood districts, each with its own character, dominant land uses and regulations. The Central Shops District encompasses the area around the Historic Central Shops. The Central Shops District will spark the renaissance of downtown Sacramento and will become the epicenter of activity for the Railyards as they are transformed into a modern, urban village. The historic railyard central shops were once a place of industrial progress, where thousands of mechanics, craftsmen, and engineers spent long days building entire locomotives from the ground up. The history of these buildings will be preserved as the shops are reclaimed, repurposed, and adapted into the central gathering place of the Railyards.The Central Shops buildings will be adaptively reused with historic/cultural-themed uses, such as a performing arts theater, exhibit space, public marketplace, art galleries, clubs and other entertainment-supporting uses, and a relatively small amount of office and retail space. The historic Central Shops buildings will be a heritage tourism draw and inspiration for a mix of uses that will help to create a culturally‚Äêvibrant, urban community. The Central Shops District will be a central gathering place where modern architectural buildings will complement the historical buildings. The Railyards Central Shops District will be adaptively reused in a way that preserves the historical significance and architecture of the brick buildings, and evolves it into a revolutionary new future. The Central Shops District will offer unique retail and entertainment venues, as well as art and cultural experiences that are distinct to our region and city. Craft breweries, urban wineries, and local, artisanal restaurants will celebrate Sacramento‚Äôs Farm-to-Fork culture. Collaborative office spaces will offer creative workspaces that meet the needs of today‚Äôs modern industry.

Advances in Space Research 39: 1161-1165 Description The RPM is a more sophisticated development of the single-axis clinostat. RPMs usually consist of two independently rotating frames. One frame is positioned inside the other giving a very complex net change of orientation to a biological sample mounted in the middle. The RPM is sometimes wrongly referred to as the \\"3-D clinostat\\" (which rotates both axis in the same direction, i.e. both clockwise). It is a microweight ('micro-gravity') simulator that is based on the principle of 'gravity-vector-averaging'. RPM provides a functional volume which is 'exposed' to simulated microweight.A. G.

Simulated micro-, partial, and hyper (Earth) gravity  The concept of 'random' positioning has been used to simulated a micro-gravity environment through the nullification of gravity. This is accomplished by disorientating the target model, or as \\"vector- averaging\\". Through the use of a centrifuge, a 'hyper-gravity' gravity can be simulated, as the model will get exposed to a continued accelerated force. In the circumstances of hyper-gravity within a micro-gravity environment, a partial 'Earth' gravity is created. Hyper-gravity simulation is also achieved through the use of larger centrifuges, such as the Large diameter Centrifuge (LDC) at the European Space Agency. The LDC simulated up to twenty times the Earth's gravitational strength. A system developed by Airbus uses a algorithm to simulate partial-gravity through a not fully randomly vector-averaging. The vector-averaging by Airbus' algorithm doesn't average out the vector to null but to a percentage representing simulated partial-gravity.

Early life Mar√≠a Joaquina de la Portilla Torres was born to a Spanish father (Francisco de la Portilla) and Mexican mother (Julia Torres) in Guanajuato, Mexico. For the first six years of her life she lived in Mexico City, moving to her father's natal city, Sevilla, in 1888. She studied music in France, with Claude Debussy and Franz Lenhard among her teachers. In 1900 she moved back to Mexico and continued her musical studies at her aunt's solf√®ge school.

I am afraid they don't know much about it. It is music worth spreading; there is such a cultural richness in Mexican Music (its Hispanic and indigenous origins and how they mix) where melody and rhythm merge. It is my wish and yearning to present the native rhythms and tunes (of Mexico) from a real perspective, but with the necessary flexibility to appeal to the universal audience\\". Grever's first international hit was \\"J√∫rame\\" (Promise, Love), a habanera-bolero interpreted in a masterly manner by tenor Jos√© Mojica.

In 1990, J.D. Irving opened a tissue converting plant for Majesta in Dieppe, New Brunswick that would make use of the tissue produced in Saint John. Irving began producing private label tissue products and the Majesta brand was launched in Canada. In 1996, Irving acquired another tissue paper mill from Kimberly-Clark as well as a tissue converting plant, both located in Fort Edward, New York. Part of this acquisition saw Irving Tissue receive the right to market its products under the Scotties Facial Tissue brand in the United States. In 2001, J.D. Irving acquired a tissue production and converting plant in Toronto from Procter & Gamble. This acquisition saw Irving Tissue receive the right to market the Royale brand in Canada. In 2004, Irving Personal Care opened a New Brunswick plant to produce private label baby diapers and training pants for major North American retailers. In 2010, major investments in buildings and a new through air dried paper machine at the Irving Tissue site in Fort Edward increased capacity and improved product quality. In 2019, Irving opened a new tissue mill and converting facility in Macon, Georgia. This facility uses the through air dried paper technology to produce bathroom tissue and paper towels. Currently, Irving Tissue manufactures products under the Majesta and Royale brands in Canada and the Scotties brand in the United States. (Another Canadian company, Kruger Inc., owns the Canadian rights to the Scotties brand.) Irving Tissue is an unsyndicated company.

Merrie Melodies cartoon animated short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on June 23, 1956, and stars Tweety and Sylvester the Cat. The voices were performed by Mel Blanc and June Foray. The cartoon's title is a play on Tugboat Annie, and is the only cartoon in the Warner Bros. series to bear Granny's name. It joined Guided Muscle and The Grey Hounded Hare as the cartoons featured on the final episode of ABC's The Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show on September 2, 2000. Plot In the opening scene, Granny and Tweety are happily piloting a rented tugboat in a harbor, singing a kiddie-song duet about the carefree joys of their activity. It is the only scene in which Granny appears, as the rest of the cartoon is devoted to Sylvester's latest attempts to catch and eat Tweety, which begins when, after failing to grab a fish by hiding in a fisherman's basket (he gets attacked by a crab the fisherman caught), he sees the boat carrying the canary chug past. Sylvester's attempts, all unsuccessful, include the following: * Using a rowboat to get to the tug. Tweety drops anchor in the boat's hull, sinking Sylvester (though he comes out onto the beach still rowing with the oars). * Using an inflatable raft, which is deflated by a dart thrown be Tweety (\\"Hey, puddy tat! Wook what I found! Here, you can have it!\\"). * Two attempts at jumping off the bridge. The first jump is mistimed, as Sylvester lands in the smokestack, leaving him with his rear end on fire. A follow-up attempt from another bridge to parachute onto the boat's deck (\\"Oh, that bad ol' puddy tat! He never give up!\\") results in a jammed pack, which only opens after Sylvester sinks to the bottom of the canal (\\"Aww, the poor puddy tat. Got himself all soaking wet.\\"). * Using a section of pipe as a snorkel to swim to the boat. A seagull finds Sylvester's pipe the perfect resting place (blocking the airway); gasping for air, the cat rushes back to shore, where he finds the seagull laid an egg in his mouth. The frightened gull flees as Sylvester angrily throws the egg at it; he misses and the egg hits him in the face. * Driving a motorboat, but Sylvester drives instead into the rapids and over a waterfall. All the time, the motor fails to start, and when it does, Sylvester pounds it to submission. * A lasso (\\"That puddy tat think he a cowboy!\\"), which instead grabs the antenna of a speedboat. Sylvester decides to show off several waterskiing tricks ... until the inattentive puddy smashes into a pole. As he floats upside-down, a fish gurgles Tweety's signature line: \\"I tawt I taw a puddy tat.\\" The cartoon ends just after Sylvester fails to grab the fish.

This can be rewritten to show its relationship to mutual information :I(X;YZ) = I(X;Y,Z) - I(X;Z) usually rearranged as the chain rule for mutual information :I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;YZ) Another equivalent form of the above isDecomposition on Math.StackExchange :I(X;YZ) = H(ZX) + H(X) + H(ZY) + H(Y) - H(ZX,Y) - H(X,Y) - H(Z) = I(X;Y) + H(ZX) + H(ZY) - H(ZX,Y) - H(Z) Like mutual information, conditional mutual information can be expressed as a Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence: : I(X;YZ) = D_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}[ p(X,Y,Z) \\\\ p(XZ)p(YZ)p(Z) ].

More general definition A more general definition of conditional mutual information, applicable to random variables with continuous or other arbitrary distributions, will depend on the concept of regular conditional probability. (See also.Regular Conditional Probability on PlanetMathD. Leao, Jr. et al. Regular conditional probability, disintegration of probability and Radon spaces. Proyecciones. Vol. 23, No. 1, pp. 15‚Äì29, May 2004, Universidad Cat√≥lica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile PDF) Let (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal F, \\\\mathfrak P) be a probability space, and let the random variables X, Y, and Z each be defined as a Borel- measurable function from \\\\Omega to some state space endowed with a topological structure. Consider the Borel measure (on the œÉ-algebra generated by the open sets) in the state space of each random variable defined by assigning each Borel set the \\\\mathfrak P-measure of its preimage in \\\\mathcal F. This is called the pushforward measure X _* \\\\mathfrak P = \\\\mathfrak P\\\\big(X^{-1}(\\\\cdot)\\\\big). The support of a random variable is defined to be the topological support of this measure, i.e. \\\\mathrm{supp}\\\\,X = \\\\mathrm{supp}\\\\,X _* \\\\mathfrak P. Now we can formally define the conditional probability measure given the value of one (or, via the product topology, more) of the random variables. Let M be a measurable subset of \\\\Omega, (i.e. M \\\\in \\\\mathcal F,) and let x \\\\in \\\\mathrm{supp}\\\\,X. Then, using the disintegration theorem: :\\\\mathfrak P(M  X=x) = \\\\lim_{U i x} \\\\frac {\\\\mathfrak P(M \\\\cap \\\\\\\\{X \\\\in U\\\\\\\\})} {\\\\mathfrak P(\\\\\\\\{X \\\\in U\\\\\\\\})} \\\\qquad \\\\textrm{and} \\\\qquad \\\\mathfrak P(MX) = \\\\int_M d\\\\mathfrak P\\\\big(\\\\omegaX=X(\\\\omega)\\\\big), where the limit is taken over the open neighborhoods U of x, as they are allowed to become arbitrarily smaller with respect to set inclusion. Finally we can define the conditional mutual information via Lebesgue integration: :I(X;YZ) = \\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\log \\\\Bigl( \\\\frac {d \\\\mathfrak P(\\\\omegaX,Z)\\\\, d\\\\mathfrak P(\\\\omegaY,Z)} {d \\\\mathfrak P(\\\\omegaZ)\\\\, d\\\\mathfrak P(\\\\omegaX,Y,Z)} \\\\Bigr) d \\\\mathfrak P(\\\\omega), where the integrand is the logarithm of a Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivative involving some of the conditional probability measures we have just defined. Note on notation In an expression such as I(A;BC), A, B, and C need not necessarily be restricted to representing individual random variables, but could also represent the joint distribution of any collection of random variables defined on the same probability space. As is common in probability theory, we may use the comma to denote such a joint distribution, e.g. I(A_0,A_1;B_1,B_2,B_3C_0,C_1). Hence the use of the semicolon (or occasionally a colon or even a wedge \\\\wedge) to separate the principal arguments of the mutual information symbol. (No such distinction is necessary in the symbol for joint entropy, since the joint entropy of any number of random variables is the same as the entropy of their joint distribution.)  Properties  Nonnegativity It is always true that :I(X;YZ) \\\\ge 0, for discrete, jointly distributed random variables X, Y and Z. This result has been used as a basic building block for proving other inequalities in information theory, in particular, those known as Shannon-type inequalities. Conditional mutual information is also non-negative for continuous random variables under certain regularity conditions. Interaction information Conditioning on a third random variable may either increase or decrease the mutual information: that is, the difference I(X;Y) - I(X;YZ), called the interaction information, may be positive, negative, or zero. This is the case even when random variables are pairwise independent. Such is the case when: X \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{Bernoulli}(0.5), Z \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{Bernoulli}(0.5), \\\\quad Y=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{ll} X & \\\\text{if }Z=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1-X & \\\\text{if }Z=1 \\\\end{array}\\\\right.in which case X, Y and Z are pairwise independent and in particular I(X;Y)=0, but I(X;YZ)=1. Chain rule for mutual information :I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;YZ) Multivariate mutual information The conditional mutual information can be used to inductively define a multivariate mutual information in a set- or measure-theoretic sense in the context of information diagrams. In this sense we define the multivariate mutual information as follows: :I(X_1;\\\\ldots;X_{n+1}) = I(X_1;\\\\ldots;X_n) - I(X_1;\\\\ldots;X_nX_{n+1}), where :I(X_1;\\\\ldots;X_nX_{n+1}) = \\\\mathbb{E}_{X_{n+1}} [D_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}( P_{(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n)X_{n+1}} \\\\ P_{X_1X_{n+1}} \\\\otimes\\\\cdots\\\\otimes P_{X_nX_{n+1}} )]. This definition is identical to that of interaction information except for a change in sign in the case of an odd number of random variables. A complication is that this multivariate mutual information (as well as the interaction information) can be positive, negative, or zero, which makes this quantity difficult to interpret intuitively. In fact, for n random variables, there are 2^n-1 degrees of freedom for how they might be correlated in an information- theoretic sense, corresponding to each non-empty subset of these variables. These degrees of freedom are bounded by various Shannon- and non-Shannon-type inequalities in information theory.

Fiachnae supported the abbot Fer-d√°-Chr√≠ch versus a priest named Airechtach who had the support of D√∫ngal mac Amalgado of the U√≠ N√©ill of Brega. Fiachnae defeated them at the Battle of Emain Macha, near Armagh, and D√∫ngal and his ally Donn B√≥ mac Con Brettan, king of Fir Rois were slain.Annals of Ulster, AU 759.2; Annals of Tigernach, 759.2; Byrne, pg.118; Mac Niocaill, pg.139 In 761 Fiachnae defeated the U√≠ Echach Cobo (a branch of the D√°l nAraidi) of the west part of county Down in the Battle of √Åth Duma where their king Ailill mac Feidlimid was slain.AU 761.2; AT 761.1; Mac Niocaill, pg.139 The U√≠ Echach Coba were to suffer another defeat in 776 this time at the hands of the Airthir (an Airgialla tribe of modern County Armagh).AU 776.9; Mac Niocaill, pg.139 The D√°l nAraidi proper engaged in internecine civil wars in 776 and 783. In one of these conflicts in 776 Fiachnae's son Eochaid gave support to the claimant Tommaltach mac Indrechtaig (died 790) and they defeated and slew the ing of D√°l nAraidi, Cinaed Ciarrge mac Cathussaig, and his ally D√∫ngal, king of the U√≠ Tuirtri (an Airgialla tribe west of Lough Neagh) in the Battle of Drong.AU 776.7; Mac Niocaill, pg.139 The power of Fiachnae was such that the high king Donnchad Midi (died 797) sought a conference with him at Inis na R√≠g in eastern Brega. However, mutual distrust prevented Fiachnae from coming ashore and Donnchad from going out to sea to meet him.AU 784.8; Mac Niocaill, pg.139; Byrne,pg.124 The purpose of the meeting may have been to deliminate spheres of influence. Donnchad may have been seeking to settle affairs involving the U√≠ Echach Coba and Airthir and the border region of the Conailli Muirtheimne (in modern County Louth).Mac Niocaill, pg.139-140 Expansion of D√°l Fiatach influence The expansion of the D√°l Fiatach northwards to the shores of Lough Neagh began in his reign and this cut off the D√°l nAraidi proper from their kinsmen the U√≠ Echach Coba in the south. Fiachnae also gave his patronage to Bangor, traditionally a D√°l nAraidi monastery.Byrne, pg.119; √ì Cr√≥in√≠n, pg.220 He also converted Downpatrick into a royal monastery (or this was done by his father).Byrne, pg.119, 124 The first recorded abbot of Downpatrick in the annals has a death notice in 753.AU 753.6; Byrne, in A New History of Ireland, pg.679 His sons Eochaid mac Fiachnai (died 810) and Cairell mac Fiachnai (died 819) were Kings of Ulster. Another son, Loingsech mac Fiachnai (died 800) was abbot of Downpatrick.Byrne, pg.124; √ì Cr√≥in√≠n, pg.220 Fiachnae's nephew Diarmait Ua √Åedo R√≥in (died 825) was a C√©li D√© (Culdee) church reformer and founded the monastery of Diseart Diarmad (Castledermot, modern County Kildare) in 812 renewing the ties of Bangor with Leinster.Byrne (NHI), pg.679 Notes References * Annals of Ulster at at University College Cork * Annals of Tigernach at at University College Cork * Byrne, Francis John (2001), Irish Kings and High-Kings, Dublin: Four Courts Press, * Charles-Edwards, T.

There is historical evidence of the village dating back at least one millennium. Most of this evidence is contained in the records of the local church, Santa Maria de Praediis. Overview From Castagneto, looking to the east one has view of the Adriatic Sea. In the opposite direction is a view of the Gran Sasso. Seen from Castagneto, the Gran Sasso is said to resemble a giant figure sleeping on his back with his face and nose pointing upward. At the highest elevation of Castagneto is an ancient palace once belonging to the Ianuarii and Scaricamazza families and which still bears their names. It can be seen from miles around and is perhaps Castagneto's most visible and most well known landmark. Castagneto often serves as a point of reference with regard to several nearby clusters of houses including Pantaneto, Collecaruno, Collemarino, Collesansonesco e Fonte del Latte. In days past Castagneto was the seat of a Roman Catholic parrish. As recently as 1980, the village hosted a local elementary school. A post office remains open to this day.

Crew  For her first two years Pembroke was captained by John Simcoe, the father of John Graves Simcoe who became the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. When the elder Simcoe died in 1759 he was replaced by John Wheelock who served as captain for the remaining seventeen years of Pembrokes active service.

Education and early career Brouwer studied Law at Groningen University. There, Brouwer came in touch with social security law and socially engaged lawyers. Inspired by this side of the legal profession, Brouwer became a member of the Communist Party of the Netherlands. In 1981 she became a member of the House of Representatives for the CPN. In 1981 she succeeded Marcus Bakker as chairperson of the CPN parliamentary party. She remained in the House of Representatives until 1986, when the CPN lost its three seats in the election and disappeared from the House. Brouwer was a longtime advocate of a merger of the CPN, the Christian left Political Party of Radicals and Evangelical People's Party and the leftwing socialist Pacifist Socialist Party to form a new left-wing formation. In 1989 this was realized, and the new party was called GreenLeft. After the 1989 elections Brouwer returned to the House of Representatives, as a member of parliament for GreenLeft. Between 1990 and 1991, Brouwer was one of the first members of parliament to leave the House of Representatives for a short period to give birth. The duo Ina Brouwer/Mohammed Rabbae were the top candidate for the 1994 elections after winning a preliminary from Paul Rosenm√∂ller/Leonie Sipkes. Brouwer and Rabbae were not very successful in the general elections and the party lost one of its six seats. Brouwer announced that she would step down and not take her seat in parliament. Between 1995 and 2003, Brouwer worked at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment as director for emancipation and a quartermaster for the Academy of the ministry. In 2003 she published a book Het glazen plafond. Vrouwen aan de top, verlangens & obstakels (\\"The Glass ceiling. Women at the top, desires and obstacles\\") on the position of women on the labour market. In 2005 Brouwer became a senior advisor at Twynstra Gudde, where she advises public institutions on diversity, social affairs and government reform. In January 2007, Ina Brouwer announced that she became a member of the Dutch Labour Party in addition to her membership of GreenLeft. She did this in protest against GreenLeft's decision to abandon negotiations with the Labour Party, the Christian Democratic Appeal, and the ChristianUnion during the cabinet formation. Brouwer thought that this was a missed opportunity. References External links ;Official * Mr. I.

Career Under Captain Edward Jekyll, Rippon took part in the unsuccessful attack on Martinique in January 1759.Clowes p. 201 While patrolling off Brest on 10 March 1761, Rippon chased and engaged the French ship of the line Achille, suffering heavy losses when a gun exploded during the action. This allowed Achille to pull away and the French ship subsequently escaped. Early on the morning of 10 August 1778, Sir Edward Vernon's squadron, consisting of Rippon (Vernon's flagship), , , Cormorant, and the East India Company's ship Valentine, encountered a French squadron under Admiral Fran√ßois l'Ollivier de Tronjoly which consisted of the 64-gun ship of the line Brillant, the frigate Pourvoyeuse and three smaller ships, Sartine, Lawriston, and Brisson. An inconclusive action followed for about two hours in mid-afternoon. The French broke off the action and the British vessels were too damaged to be able to catch them up again. In the action the British suffered 11 men killed and 53 wounded, including four men killed and 15 wounded aboard Rippon.Anon. (1801), Section: Pon. Seahorse captured Sartine on 25 August 1778. Sartine had been patrolling off Pondichery with Pourvoyeuse when they sighted two East Indiamen, which were sailing blithely along, unaware of the outbreak of war. The French vessels gave chase lazily. Sartines captain, Count du Chaillar, first had to be roused from his bed ashore. The British merchant vessels escaped, but Sartine came too close to Vernon's squadron. He sent Coventry and Seahorse after her and she surrendered after a short action. A French account remarks acidly that she surrendered to a frigate of her own size without a fight.Barras (1895), Vol. 1, pp.371‚Äì2. All four Royal Navy vessels in Vernon's squadron shared in the prize money. (Vernon had already sent Valentine off with dispatches.)

She fought in the Seven Years' War in North America (including the capture of Louisbourg) and in the western squadron under Admiral Edward Hawke, including the Battle of Quiberon Bay. After the war she spent the subsequent peace as guardship at Plymouth and a troopship to the West Indies and was repaired in 1772. In the American Revolutionary War she was sent to the East Indies from 1779 to 1784 as part of admiral Edward Hughes's squadron where she participated in all five indecisive actions against the French admiral Suffren. After her return to England in 1784 she was sold for breaking up in 1785. Design and Construction Although nominally a 70 gun third rate of the 1745 Establishment, the Burford design was heavily amended by Joseph Allin, Surveyor of Navy, in 1754. She was ordered on 15 January 1754 as the first of five ships which made up the last group of 'traditional' 70 gun ships (they carried only 68 guns in practice) to be built before the 74 gun ship became the standard third rate. On 13 June 1754 she was named HMS Burford after her predecessors and the secondary title of George Beauclerk, 3rd Duke of St Albans and was the third and last ship of this name in Royal Navy. She was begun by Master Shipwright Adam Hayes at Chatham Dockyard on 30 October 1754, then from August 1755 was completed by John Lock. Launched on 5 May 1757, she was completed on 15 July 1757. Her first commander was Captain James Young who commissioned her a month before launching in April 1757.Winfield, British Warships in the Age of Sail, vol. 2, p. 57 Service history Burford took an active part in the Seven Years' War, initially with Admiral Hawke in 1757. In 1758 she was commanded by Captain James Gambier (who was her captain throughout the rest of the war) at the capture of Louisberg, then in the West Indies between November 1758 and November 1759. She rejoined Hawke on 13 November 1759 just in time for the Battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November. She remained with Hawke until 1763, seeing action at Belle Isle in 1761 and the Basque Roads in 1762. At the end of the Seven Years' War Burford was guard ship at Plymouth from May 1763 until 1770, with two expeditions to the West Indies as a troopship in 1764 and 1768. She was paid of in March 1770 for a Middling repair at Plymouth Dockyard (costing ¬£11,317.6.2d) between November 1769 and February 1772, before going into Ordinary until 1776. At the start of the American Revolutionary War Burford was commissioned under Captain G Bowyer for Ireland and completed fitting out at Plymouth Dockyard in May 1777. Between March and November 1777 she was at Portsmouth Dockyard fitting for the East Indies at a cost of ¬£11,393.9.7d. Initially commissioned in May 1778 by Captain Taylor Penny, she was taken over by Captain Peter Rainier in October of that year before sailing on 7 March 1779 for service with Rear Admiral Edward Hughes on the East Indies Station. She participated in destruction of shipping at Mangalore on 8 December 1780, and then in the battles of Sadras, Providien, Negapatam, Trincomalee and Cuddalore against the French Chef d'escadre Suffren. In 1784 she returned to England with Sir Richard king, arriving at Woolwich Dockyard on 3 July 1784. Fate Burford was sold at Woolwich for break up for a price of ¬£1,320 on 31 March 1785. Battle Honours The third Burford won seven battle honours: Louisburg 1758; Quiberon Bay 1759; Belle Isle 1761; Sadras 1782; Providien 1782; Negapatam 1782; and Trincomalee 1782.Warlow, Battle Honours of the Royal Navy, p. 83 Notes References *Lavery, Brian (2003) The Ship of the Line ‚Äì Volume 1: The development of the battlefleet 1650‚Äì1850.

Education and early development  Paula F√ºrst was born in G≈Çog√≥w to Otto F√ºrst, a Jewish merchant and Malvine F√ºrst, n√©e Rosenberg. Following the untimely and early death of her father, Paula moved to Berlin together with her mother and her older sister. During her studies in French and History she became acquainted with the principles of Montessori education and was deeply impressed with this \\"new way of education\\". She obtained a Montessori diploma through studies in Berlin and Rome and became head of the first Montessori class in Berlin. In addition, she was a frequent lecturer on pedagogical topics.  Life and work under the Nazi regime  According to Nazi ideology, the Montessori method was mainly propagated by \\"Jewish elements\\" and contributed to selfish and anti-national behavior. Consequently, Paula F√ºrst was forced to resign from her position as teacher in 1933. In the same year, she became head teacher of the Theodor Herzl School of Berlin, a Zionist school with 600 students. As the Nazis tightened the grip on Jewish life in Berlin and Germany, conditions at the Herzl School deteriorated rapidly. Following the Kristallnacht of November 1938, Leo Baeck offered Paula F√ºrst the position of head of all Jewish schools in Germany which she accepted. She also accompanied many children of the Kindertransport to London but refused to stay abroad although life for Jews in Germany had become unbearable and the beginning of World War II was imminent.  Deportation and death  Paula F√ºrst was arrested on June 19, 1942 and deported to Minsk on June 24, 1942 together with 201 people. Historians theorize that she died in a death camp, possibly Auschwitz, later that year.

Introduction  In today's chemical processes hundreds of thousands of components are used. The Chemical Abstracts Service registry lists 56 million substances,http://www.cas.org/newsevents/releases/research120810.html but many of these are only of scientific interest. Process designers need to know some basic chemical properties of the components and their mixtures. Experimental measurement is often too expensive. Predictive methods can replace measurements if they provide sufficiently good estimations. The estimated properties cannot be as precise as well-made measurements, but for many purposes the quality of estimated properties is sufficient. Predictive methods can also be used to check the results of experimental work.  Principles  Principle of a group-contribution method A group-contribution method uses the principle that some simple aspects of the structures of chemical components are always the same in many different molecules. The smallest common constituents are the atoms and the bonds. The vast majority of organic components, for example, are built of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, halogens, and maybe sulfur or phosphorus. Together with a single, a double, and a triple bond there are only ten atom types (not including astatine) and three bond types to build thousands of components. The next slightly more complex building blocks of components are functional groups, which are themselves built from few atoms and bonds. A group-contribution method is used to predict properties of pure components and mixtures by using group or atom properties. This reduces the number of needed data dramatically. Instead of needing to know the properties of thousands or millions of compounds, only data for a few dozens or hundreds of groups have to be known.  Additive group-contribution method  The simplest form of a group-contribution method is the determination of a component property by summing up the group contribution: : T_\\\\text{b}[\\\\text{K}] = 198.2022567824111 + \\\\sum G_i. This simple form assumes that the property (normal boiling point in the example) is strictly linearly dependent on the number of groups, and additionally no interaction between groups and molecules are assumed. This simple approach is used, for example, in the Joback method for some properties, and it works well in a limited range of components and property ranges, but leads to quite large errors if used outside the applicable ranges.  Additive group contributions and correlations  This technique uses the purely additive group contributions to correlate the wanted property with an easy accessible property. This is often done for the critical temperature, where the Guldberg rule implies that Tc is 3/2 of the normal boiling point, and the group contributions are used to give a more precise value: : T_\\\\text{c} = T_\\\\text{b} \\\\left[0.584 + 0.965 \\\\sum G_i - \\\\left(\\\\sum G_i\\\\right)^2 \\\\right]^{-1}. This approach often gives better results than pure additive equations because the relation with a known property introduces some knowledge about the molecule. Commonly used additional properties are the molecular weight, the number of atoms, chain length, and ring sizes and counts.  Group interactions  For the prediction of mixture properties it is in most cases not sufficient to use a purely additive method. Instead the property is determined from group- interaction parameters: : P = f(G_{ij}), where P stands for property, and Gij for group-interaction value. A typical group-contribution method using group- interaction values is the UNIFAC method, which estimates activity coefficients. A big disadvantage of the group-interaction model is the need for many more model parameters. Where a simple additive model only needs 10 parameters for 10 groups, a group-interaction model needs already 45 parameters. Therefore, a group-interaction model has .  Group contributions of higher orders  Some newer methods introduce second-order groups. These can be super-groups containing several first-order (standard) groups. This allows the introduction of new parameters for the position of groups. Another possibility is to modify first-order group contributions if specific other groups are also present. If the majority of group-contribution methods give results in gas phase, recently, a new such method was created for estimating the standard Gibbs free energy of formation (ŒîfG‚Ä≤¬∞) and reaction (ŒîrG‚Ä≤¬∞) in biochemical systems: aqueous solution, temperature of 25 ‚ÑÉ and pH = 7 (biochemical conditions). This new aqueous-system method is based on the group-contribution method of Mavrovouniotis. A free-access tool of this new method in aqueous condition is available on the web.  Determination of group contributions  Group contributions are obtained from known experimental data of well defined pure components and mixtures. Common sources are thermophysical data banks like the Dortmund Data Bank, Beilstein database, or the DIPPR data bank (from AIChE). The given pure component and mixture properties are then assigned to the groups by statistical correlations like e. g. (multi-)linear regression. Important steps during the development of a new method are: # Evaluation of the quality of available experimental data, elimination of wrong data, finding of outliers. # Construction of groups. # Searching additional simple and easily accessible properties that can be used to correlate the sum of group contributions with the examined property. # Finding a good but simple mathematical equation for the relation of the group contribution sum with the wanted property. The critical pressures, for example, is often determined as Pc = f(Œ£Gi2). # Fitting the group contribution. The reliability of a method mainly relies on a comprehensive data bank where sufficient source data have been available for all groups. A small data base may lead to a precise reproduction of the used data but will lead to significant errors when the model is used for the prediction of other systems.

A dual-layer DVD or Blu-ray with Opposite Track Path means that layer 0 is written in a spiral track starting at the inside of the disc reading outwards, whereas the layer 1 spiral starts at the outside of the disc reading inwards. Both tracks are written so that the DVD player will rotate the disc in the same direction. Unlike DVD-ROM discs, DVD video discs are mastered such that layer 0 ends at the same diameter as the layer 1 starts. This means that the layer 1 occupies the end of the layer rather than the start. Thus, although the laser still has to refocus on layer 1, it does not have to seek across the disc to find it. With the DVD technology, a small gap is left in the layer 1 track every time it crosses the layer 0 track (twice per revolution). As a result, the data capacity of layer 1 is less than layer 0 which means that a dual layer disc only has a capacity of 8.5 GB instead of the 9.4 GB that might have been expected. In the case of Blu-rays, it was realised that the gap was unnecessary as the laser is perfectly capable of focussing through track 0.

TIME.com sometimes known only as Louisa Knapp, was the author of a column, and later, the separate supplement included with the magazine, Tribune and Farmer, that in 1883 would become a separate magazine, the Ladies' Home Journal, which is still published. Early copy of Ladies Home Journal, founded by Louisa Knapp Curtis - March 1886 Her column in the Tribune and Farmer was entitled, Women at Home. The original name of the separate magazine that arose from the popularity of that column was The Ladies Home Journal and Practical Housekeeper, but she dropped the last three words from its title in 1886. The magazine became one of the most popular magazines published in the United States, reaching a circulation of one million within ten years. Curtis remained as the editor of the monthly magazine from its first edition of February 16, 1883 until she turned over the editorship to Edward Bok in 1889, after which she continued to author one featured column and provided a certain amount of oversight, as promised to her readers. In 1875, Louisa Knapp married Cyrus Curtis when he was the publisher of The Peoples Lodge in Boston. After a fire destroyed that business, they moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1876 where her husband founded the Tribune and Farmer and, in 1890, the Curtis Publishing company, which published several magazines. He also published three national level newspapers for a time, through his newspaper company, Curtis-Martin Newspapers, Inc. Louisa and Cyrus Curtis had one child, Mary Louise Curtis, who married her mother's successor at the Ladies' Home Journal in 1896 (and with whom she founded Bok Tower Gardens). Mary Louise founded the Curtis Institute of Music in 1924 as well as, after the death of her father in 1933, the Curtis Hall Arboretum at the family residence, and the Curtis Center in the building from which her mother's magazine was published. In 1930 Edward Bok died and in 1943 she married the director of the Curtis Institute of Music that she had founded, the renowned violinist, Efrem Zimbalist. She died on February 25, 1910 in Cheltenham, Pennsylvania and is interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

She is currently chairwoman of the Dutch national UNESCO committee. She was previously wethouder (alderman) in the executive of the city of Amsterdam for GreenLeft until 2014. She was member of the House of Representatives for the Pacifist Socialist Party and GreenLeft.  Biography  Van Es became assistant to the PSP parliamentary party in 1975. During the 1981 election she was elected to parliament. From 1985 she was chair of the parliamentary party, which after the 1986 election was represented only by her. In the 1989 election, the PSP combined forces with the Communist Party of the Netherlands and the progressive Christian Political Party of Radicals and the Evangelical People's Party under the name GreenLeft. In November 1990, just before GreenLeft was formed as a separate political party, Van Es left politics in order to \\"make room for new GreenLeft faces\\" and because she had difficulty combining motherhood and her place in parliament. She was a consciously single mother from 1988. She was replaced as an MP by party member Leoni Sipkes. After her political career, Van Es worked for the broadcasters VPRO and NOS. In 1996 she married MP Maarten van Traa, with whom she had had a relationship since 1990. In October 1997, Van Traa died during a car crash. After her journalist work, Van Es led the political-cultural centre De Balie in Amsterdam and chaired the GGZ-Netherlands, a health organization, between 2002 and 2007. In 2001 she was asked by the cabinet to help M√°xima Zorreguieta, then the future wife of Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange, integrate in the Dutch society. Between 2002 and 2004 she was a member of the Dijkstal committee, which studied the salaries for politicians and high ranking civil servants. She worked from November 2007 as director-general of Government and Kingdom Relations, one of the highest-ranking civil servants within the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. Since April 2010 she has been a member of the executive of the city of Amsterdam responsible for, amongst others, work & income and diversity & integration.
