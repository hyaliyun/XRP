Biography Harris was born in Boston, Massachusetts and studied at Harvard University with bachelor's degree in 1956, master's degree in 1959, and PhD in experimental solid state physics from Horst Meyer in 1962. Harris was in 1961/62 at Duke University to complete his doctoral thesis with Meyer and then was an instructor there from 1962 to 1964. During 1961‚Äì1964 at Duke University Harris retrained himself as a theorist in condensed matter physics and then spent the academic year 1964/65 as a researcher working with John Hubbard in the UK at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (Harwell Laboratory) near Harwell, Oxfordshire. At the University of Pennsylvania, Harris became in 1965 an assistant professor and in 1977 a full professor, continuing there until his retirement as professor emeritus. He was a visiting professor at University of British Columbia in 1976, at the University of Oxford in 1973, 1986, and 1994, at Tel Aviv University in 1987 and 1995, and at McMaster University in 2005. He was visiting scientist at Sandia National Laboratories in 1974 and at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2002. In 2007 he received the Lars Onsager Prize for his contributions to the statistical physics of disordered systems, especially for the development of the Harris criterion. From 1967 to 1969 he was Sloan Fellow and in 1972/73 a Guggenheim Fellow. In 1989 he was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society. Harris has been married to Peggy since 1958 and has three children, eight grandchildren, and one great grandson, Jimmy. Research Upon receiving the Lars Onsager Prize, Harris wrote in 2007: He has also collaborated in theoretical condensed matter physics with R. J. Birgeneau (MIT), J. Yeomans (Oxford), R. D. Kamien (Penn), C. Broholm (Johns Hopkins), and A. Ramirez (Bell Labs). In 1973 he developed at Oxford the Harris criterion, which indicates the extent to which the critical exponents of a phase transition are modified by a small amount of randomness (e.g., defects, dislocations, or impurities). Such impurities \\"smear\\" the phase transition and lead to local variations in the transition temperature. Let d denote the spatial dimension of the system and let u denote the critical exponent of correlation length. The Harris criterion states that if : u \\\\geq \\\\frac {2} {d} the impurities do not affect the critical behavior (so that the critical behavior is then stable against the random interference). For example, in the classical three-dimensional Heisenberg model u = 0 {.} 698 and thus the Harris criterion is satisfied, while the three-dimensional Ising model has u = 0 {. } 627 and thus does not satisfy the criterion ( d = 3 ).

Kutumov to the 16th century Turkmen poet Magtymguly Pyragy (who would later become the namesake avenue), was installed on the avenue. Following the dissolution of the USSR in December 1991, the avenue was immediately renamed to Makhtumkuli Avenue by order of President Saparmurat Niyazov (also known as T√ºrkmenba≈üy). Over the next 2 to 3 years, a large fountain was installed on the avenue and maple and acacia trees also appeared along its path.

The region has drawn national scrutiny from journalists, economists, and the general public for failing to address the widening economic disparities, given that Silicon Valley receives almost half of all venture capital investments in the United States and leads the nation in GDP growth. Advocacy groups like Silicon Valley Rising and Palo Alto Forward have made attempts to propose policy changes on behalf of low-income and historically discriminated populations in the Bay Area.  Causes  Following the 2007‚Äì2009 Great Recession, there is evidence to suggest that the middle-class has struggled to recover in Silicon Valley. The region has experienced high levels of job-growth, primarily concentrated in specialized technology sectors. Despite the region's rebound from the recession, \\"Tier 2\\" or middle-class jobs have seen a gradual decline in employment, as detailed in the 2015 Silicon Valley Index published by Joint Venture Silicon Valley: = Great Recession and subsequent housing crisis = With the onset of the Great Recession, which stemmed from a combination of \\"mass mortgage lending, ballooning home values, and dubious subprime operations\\", unemployment and foreclosures grew. Many homeowners could not afford to continue home loan payments when interest rates adjusted, leading to the burst of the housing bubble; this was known as the subprime mortgage crisis. Foreclosures left thousands of houses empty, while residential construction was slashed by three quarters from its peak in 2005. According to the California Association of Realtor's report on the state's housing market from 2008 to 2009, \\"nearly 20% of sellers sold their property due to foreclosure, short sales, or default\\".Silicon Valley Association of Realtors,.

(2010). C California: The Pivot of the Great Recession (pp. 13, 22). Berkeley. Retrieved from http://metrostudies.berkeley.edu/pubs/reports/Walker_93.pdf Economists note the example of supply and demand manifest in this housing market crisis: high demand for residence (fueled by localized job growth and foreign investments) places pressure on the supply side of the scale (which continues to recover from the Great Recession's near-halt in construction, and which is regulated by strict building laws that restrain new construction). As of 2018, construction of new residential units had kept pace with job growth in Silicon Valley. Weak infrastructure has been struggling to meet the demands placed upon it, and partially accounts for the inflated home prices and rising cost of living facing most residents of Silicon Valley, particularly those belonging to lower- and middle-income social brackets. Companies have reported difficulty in finding workers to fill available positions as rising housing costs have resulted in an exodus of individuals from Silicon Valley. 2018 reports placed the median home sale price in Silicon Valley at $935,000. Despite the overall increase in population, a total of 44,102 residents moved out of the Valley to other parts of California and the United States between July 2015 and July 2017, with many citing expensive living costs as the primary reason for their move. Startups and capital have also been migrating to: Seattle, Washington; Austin, Texas; and cities in the Midwest. = Uneven job growth = The total income for the median family in California fell more than 5% between the official recession years and an additional 6% between 2009 and 2010, producing a greater gap between lower- and upper-income groups.Bohn, S., & Schiff, E.

Those that haven't moved, typically allocate from 30‚Äì50% of their income to housing.  Effects  As the concentration of middle-class families and individuals shrinks in the Silicon Valley region, researchers, city officials, and economists are increasingly concerned about socio-economic consequences. Recent evidence indicating a migration of startups to more affordable cities across the United States has raised questions over a gradual shift in investment and capital flow out of Silicon Valley. Some investors and economists are confident that Silicon Valley has reached its \\"peak\\", and is steadily losing its lead over other innovation hubs. = Exodus to suburbs, longer commutes = Unaffordable living has pushed thousands in the middle- class to outlying suburbs around the Bay Area, while others have moved out-of- state. A 2018 survey published by the Bay Area Council, a regional think-tank, reported that 46% of Bay Area residents plan to move out of their home within the next few years; this number has steadily risen over the past few years.Jeffris, R. (2018). 46% of Bay Area Residents Planning to Leave: 2018 Bay Area Council Poll Asks Why and Where They are Going. [ebook] San Francisco: Bay Area Council. Available at: http://documents.bayareacouncil.org/2018bacprelease1.pdf [Accessed 3 Nov. 2018]. The same study indicated that 61% of survey respondents were looking to move outside of California, with Texas and Oregon as popular alternatives. Redfin's quarterly migration report also indicated this trend for Metro San Francisco, with 21.9% of area users searching for homes elsewhere and 16,952 more home searchers looking to move away than to move to the metro area. Long commutes are faced by those who work in Silicon Valley but live in the outlying suburbs. Some commute from as far as Stockton, California; as of 2017, 9% of all commuters living in Stockton travel 90 minutes or more to work each day and have joined a population known as \\"mega-commuters\\". Silicon Valley commute times as a whole have risen 17% since 2008, with most individuals coming from the suburbs. = Growing homeless population = In 2017, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development released their annual report detailing homeless levels across the nation; 7,394 individuals experienced homelessness in the San Jose and Santa Clara regions, with another 6,858 homeless in San Francisco. Numerous studies and reports have confirmed that the housing crisis has magnified the homeless population throughout Silicon Valley, and experts are concerned that homes in the Bay Area are simply inaccessible for most of the middle- and lower-class. = Shift in capital and innovation flows = Silicon Valley is home to one of the largest concentrations of venture capital in the United States, accounting for nearly half of the nation's venture capital investments in 2016, and stands as the 19th largest economy in the world.Chai, J., Rajgopal, K. and Modi, K. (2018). Continuing Growth and Unparalleled Innovation. 10th ed. [ebook] Bay Area Council Economic Institute. Available at: http://www.bayareaeconomy.org/files/pdf/BayAreaEconomicProfile2018Web.pdf [Accessed 4 Nov. 2018]. The region also holds the first-place position in global capital.Crunchbase Global Innovation Investment Report. (2018). [ebook] Crunchbase, pp.10-12. Available at: https://static.crunchbase.com/reports/annual_2016_yf42a/crunchbase_annual_2016.pdf [Accessed 4 Nov. 2018]. In recent years, however, American companies and entrepreneurs have begun to eye other locations in the United States as breeding grounds for future innovation. The Midwest, in particular, has attracted the attention of the likes of e-commerce giant Amazon for its second headquarters, and venture capitalists based in Silicon Valley have started to invest in startups in areas of the \\"Rustic Belt\\". CEOs and founders that established initial success in Silicon Valley, most notably AOL founder Steve Case and investor/entrepreneur Tim Ferriss, have openly commented on the region \\"hitting its peak\\", and spoken of a growing interest in startups outside the Bay Area.

Early life and family  Prince Juan Jorge de Bagration-Mukhrani was born on 18 August 1977 in Madrid to Prince Bagrat de Bagration y de Baviera and Do√±a Mar√≠a del Carmen de Ulloa y Suelves. His paternal grandfather, Prince Irakli Bagration of Mukhrani, was exiled from Georgia during the invasion of the Red Army, living in Germany, Italy, and finally settling in Spain. His paternal grandmother, Infanta Mar√≠a de las Mercedes of Spain was a member of the Spanish royal family and the German House of Wittelsbach; she was the daughter of Prince Ferdinand of Bavaria, granddaughter of Alfonso XII of Spain, and niece of Alfonso XIII of Spain. His maternal grandfather was Gonzalo Maria de Ulloa y Ram√≠rez de Haro, Marqu√©s de Castro-Serna, Count de Adanero. Prince Juan's parents divorced in 2005 and his father remarried in 2009 to Fran√ßoise Cazaudehore. Prince Juan is a member of the House of Mukhrani, a branch of the Bagrationi dynasty that ruled Georgia from the Middle Ages until the nineteenth century, when Georgia was annexed into the Russian Empire. The family was recognized as part of the Russian nobility until the rise of communism in Russia. Prince Juan studied at Coll√®ge Alpin International Beau Soleil, a boarding school in Villars-sur-Ollon, Switzerland and was a schoolmate and childhood friend of Cayetano Rivera Ord√≥√±ez.  Personal life  Prince Juan met Kristine Dzidziguri, a Georgian model, in 2014. They were married a few months later in a civil ceremony on 10 May 2014 in Ronda, Spain. The couple began planning a religious ceremony but were delayed due to social and political conflicts within Georgia and because of Prince Juan's father's declining health. His father died on 20 March 2017, and the couple decided to mourn for one year before organizing a religious wedding ceremony. On 2 June 2018 Prince Juan and Dzidziguri received a blessing from Ilia II of Georgia, the Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia. On 3 June 2018 they were married in a Georgian Orthodox ceremony at Svetitskhoveli Cathedral in Mtskheta. Their wedding reception was held at the Palace of Mukhrani. After their wedding the couple honeymooned in Indonesia, where they attended the Tomohon International Flower Festival. While in Indonesia they also made an official visit to the Agung Rai Museum of Art. Later during their Indonesian tour, Prince Juan and Princess Kristine attended a gala lunch focused on establishing a cultural relationship between Indonesia and Georgia. Prince Juan is the founder of the Georgian Foundation, a non-profit organization that promotes Georgian culture. He has dual Spanish and Georgian citizenship. In October 2019 he launched a wine brand called Prince Ioane Bagrationi wines.https://www.georgianjournal.ge/culture/36098-georgian-royal-family- introduces-new-wine-brand-qprince-ioane-bagrationiq.html?rnd=1571754800.5209  References  Living people 1977 births Royalty of Georgia (country) House of Mukhrani Members of the Georgian Orthodox Church Nobility from Madrid Winemakers ","title":"Juan de Bagration-Mukhrani"},{"id":"58977527","text":"Gotkin is a surname.

The HRBRRD, formed in 1959 by combining the two entities, collects excess runoff to reduce flooding impacts in the Hudson River and Black River basins, and releases this captured water gradually during periods of low river flow to maintain water quality in each river basin. This system was designed to reduce damage from spring storms and snowmelt, including disease and destruction of life and property, and to improve river navigation and public sanitation. The HRBRRD was also formed with hydroelectric generation in mind. It owns and operates several dams - including the Conklingville Dam which formed the Great Sacandaga Lake - and reservoirs. Organization The HRBRRD is guided by a 7-member board. Its management team is headed by Executive Director John C. Callaghan, Sr. In 2017, it had operating expenses of $8.53 million, no outstanding debt, and a staffing level of 24 people. For decades, HRBRRD's revenues came from lease agreements with electrical power companies who operate the hydroelectric generation facilities within the district, however these revenues ended in 2009 because of a lawsuit. The HRBRRD then tried to obtain revenue from the counties to which it provided flood relief, i.e., Warren, Washington, Saratoga, Rensselaer and Albany and a lawsuit was filed in response. The HRBRRD now receives revenue from Brookfield Renewable Power in the amount of $1.4 million per year (with an annual 3 percent increase), from permit fees charged to land owners along the shoreline of the Great Sacandaga Lake in the amount of $412,000 per year, and from dam maintenance fees received from the hydroelectric facilities in an annual amount of $471,000. After those three sources of revenue are accounted for, the remaining operating expenses and debt are paid for by the HRBRRD's benefiting county governments based upon assessed property value along the river system. Facilities The HRBRRD owns and operates six dams and their accompanying reservoirs. These facilities include: *Conklingville Dam on the Sacandaga River, a Hudson River tributary *Indian Lake on the Indian River, a Hudson River tributary *Stillwater Reservoir on the Beaver River, a Black River tributary *The Fulton Chain of Lakes, with dams at Old Forge and Sixth Lake, which are the headwaters of the Middle Branch of the Moose River, a Black River tributary The dams are inspected annually by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

In colonised or subjugated countries, bourgeois revolutions often take the form of a war of national independence. The English, French, and American revolutions are considered the archetypal bourgeois revolutions, in that they attempted to clear away the remnants of the medieval feudal system, so as to pave the way for the rise of capitalism. The term is usually used in contrast to \\"proletarian revolution\\", and is also sometimes called a \\"bourgeois-democratic revolution\\". According to one version of the two-stage theory, bourgeois revolution was asserted to be a necessary step in the move toward socialism. In this view, countries that had preserved their feudal structure, like Russia, would have to establish capitalism via a bourgeois revolution before being able to wage a proletarian revolution. At the time of the Russian Revolution, the Mensheviks asserted this theory, arguing that a revolution led by bourgeoisie was necessary to modernise society, establish basic freedoms, and overcome feudalism, which would establish the conditions necessary for socialism.

A portrait of Charles Sievwright in his Royal Fusiliers uniform c. 1825  Early life  Charles Wightman Sievwright was the third-born of seven children of Edinburgh lawyer Andrew Sievwright and his wife Ann, nee Robertson.

His salary was ¬£250 per year.Cannon, Michael (ed.) (1983), Historical Records of Victoria: Foundation series; Vol 2B; Aborigines and protectors 1838-1839, Melbourne, Victorian Government printer, p.366.  Protector of Aborigines  After arriving in Sydney in November 1838, Sievwright lived briefly with his wife, Christina, and their seven children in Melbourne. The whole family then moved to live among the Aborigines in the Geelong area. This was on the edge of the area assigned to him, known as the Western District, covering about 40,000 square kilometres. British and Irish settlers had begun arriving in the District about three years earlier, but at the time thousands of Aboriginal people still far outnumbered the Europeans. As a Protector of Aborigines, Sievwright was commissioned by the British government to represent the Aboriginal people, and to protect them \\"from cruelty, oppression and injustice\\" and \\"from encroachments upon their property\\".Cannon, Michael (ed.) (1983), Historical Records of Victoria: Foundation series; Vol 2B; Aborigines and protectors 1838-1839, Melbourne, Victorian Government printer, p.373-5 In February 1841, Sievwright and his family moved further into his district to set up a new camp at Lake Keilambete, near present-day Terang. A year later, he moved to Mt Rouse, near present day Penshurst, again urging the Aborigines of the district to join him. Sievwright's difficulties were considerable, not speaking the languages of the Aborigines under his care, and most of them coming into contact with Europeans for the first time. Nevertheless, at each of his camps he launched limited agricultural training programs in return for food, when traditional food supplies became scarcer as more European settlers arrived with sheep and cattle. At the same time, he launched a series of investigations into the killing of Aboriginal people.Report of the Proceedings of C. W. Sievwright from 1 December 1840 to 28 February 1841, in Add Ms 86, Dixson Library, State Library of NSW; Report of the Proceedings of C. W. Sievwright from 1 December 1841 to 28 February 1842, in CSIL/11, No 42/5708, Dixson Library, State Library of NSW. His efforts to seek prosecutions of Europeans involved in killings made him extremely unpopular among the white settlers. One squatter recorded in his private journal that by February 1840, Sievwright had already become \\"the most unpopular man that ever breathed\\".Journal of Niel Black, 30 September 1839-8 May 1840, Entry for 25 February, 1840, La Trobe Library Ms 11519 Around the same time, the Port Phillip Gazette reported that Sievwright was \\"in very bad odour\\" with the squatters of the Western District. \\"These gentlemen, it appears, cut him upon all occasions, and will not suffer him to enter their houses.\\"Port Phillip Gazette, 14 March 1840 In August 1842, Sievwright was told that he'd been suspended without pay because of charges against his moral character, dating back to 1839. Port Phillip's Superintendent Charles La Trobe told NSW Governor George Gipps in Sydney that even if the charges against Sievwright were false, they had been \\"from the outset fatal to him and his recent career\\". Chief Protector Robinson had already backed a plan to sack Sievwright months earlier.La Trobe to George Robinson, 12 August 1842, with Gipps to Secretary of State 20 December 1842, NSW Governor's Despatches Outwards vol 41, Despatch No 238, Mitchell Library Ms A1230 (Paper No 16); Robinson to La Trobe, 26 April 1842, VPRS 10, No 1842/794, Public Record Office of Victoria (accessible online 2019-09-12) Even before Sievwright learned of his suspension at Mt Rouse, it had been reported in Melbourne by the Port Phillip Gazette. At the same time, the Gazette referred to a threat by the colonial government to refuse squatting licences in part of the Western District where Sievwright had reported the recent murders of three Aboriginal women and a child. \\"There is still some doubt if the whole affair has not been exaggerated,\\" it said.Port Phillip Gazette 30 July 1842 After it became apparent that Sievwright's suspension was based at least in part on a letter written by his own wife in 1839, both she and their eldest daughter, Frances, wrote to La Trobe defending him.Christina Sievwright to La Trobe and Frances Sievwright to La Trobe, VPRS 10 No 42/1923 and No 42/1924, Public Record Office of Victoria (Frances' letter accessible online 2019-09-12)However, Sievwright remained suspended, and the family slipped into poverty. \\"Mr Sievwright's situation precluded him from making friends among the white population,\\" a man called Frederic Nesbitt wrote to La Trobe. \\"Therefore they are now suffering the penalty of having done their duty to the Aborigines.\\" Geelong Police Magistrate Nicholas Fenwick confirmed the family's plight, telling the Superintendent: \\"Nobody here it appears will give them anything on credit now that Mr Sievwright has been suspended, and how they manage to get their daily bread, nobody can tell, and their children are in rags.\\"F. Nesbitt to La Trobe, April 1843; and Fenwick to La Trobe, 1 May 1843, Colonial Secretary Main Series of letters received, 1826-1982, Item No 4/2627 (1843), Letter 43/3823, NSW State Archives In London, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, Edward Smith-Stanley, endorsed Gipps' recommendation that Sievwright be dismissed. \\"I should wish if possible to avoid pursuing this matter further, as it is not of a character fit for public investigation,\\" he told the Governor. La Trobe and Gipps continued to reject Sievwright's demands for a full inquiry into the allegations that had led to his dismissal. They agreed only to two inquiries into subsequent claims raised in 1844 that he'd misappropriated government stores. Sievwright told La Trobe he regretted to state that Chief Protector Robinson was his \\"openly declared enemy\\", and was withholding documentary evidence that would show the claims had no basis.Stanley to Gipps, 5 June 1843, VPRS 10, NO 1843/2599; Sievwright to La Trobe 6 December 1844, VPRS 10, No 44/2166, Public Record Office of Victoria, (accessible online 2019-09-12) To further try to clear his name, Sievwright wrote a lengthy letter to the Geelong Advertiser, the voice of the Western District squatters. Over two days in February 1845, it devoted four broadsheet pages to Sievwright's letter. It incorporated correspondence relating to the Protectorate, his views on what he viewed as its maladministration by Robinson, and the failure of La Trobe to grant his demand for a full inquiry into his dismissal. \\"We cannot see a man crushed, as Mr Sievwright has been, without crying 'shame'. We confess that until these disclosures were made, we always entertained a strong prejudice against Mr Sievwright, and did not scruple to express it, and we are therefore glad of the opportunity to make reparation,\\" the Advertiser commented.Geelong Advertiser 5 and 8 February 1845 In May 1845, Sievwright sailed from Melbourne to London, leaving his family in Melbourne, to put his case for an inquiry direct to the British government. He was still trying unsuccessfully at least as late as 1849.Christina Sievwright to Niel Black, 4 September and 22 October 1849, Niel Black Papers, Box 3, La Trobe Library, Ms 8996  Personal life  On 3 April 1822 in Stirling, Scotland, he married Christina Watt. The couple had seven children: Frances 'Fanny' Anna (1823); Marcus (c. 1826); Charles (c. 1828); Frederica Christina (1830); Melita Ysobel (1830); Ada Georgina (1834); and Adolphus Falkland (1835). He became deaf and blind before dying in London in September 1855. He was buried in an unmarked grave in Brompton Cemetery. Christina had died in Melbourne in 1854. Frances Sievwright went to Van Diemen's Land to work as a governess to Lady Pedder, wife of its first Chief Justice, Sir John Pedder. In Hobart, Fanny met and married London-born Anglican clergyman Arthur Davenport, who became the last government chaplain on Norfolk Island while it was still a convict settlement, and later Archdeacon of Holy Trinity Church in Hobart. Frances' twin sisters, Frederica and Melita, would also marry in Hobart - Frederica to bank manager, George Matson, and Melita to Henry Hill, later Superintendent of Police in Ballarat. Their youngest sister, Ada, married a solicitor, Stephen Clissold, before returning to England.Arkley, Lindsey pp 451-3, The hated Protector, Orbit Press, 2000 Marcus Sievwright would become a solicitor and live the rest of his life in Melbourne.Arkley, Lindsey pp 451-3, The hated Protector, Orbit Press, 2000 Charles Sievwright junior worked as a station manager for two Western District squatters, Charles and Peter Manifold, before he died in 1851 after falling from a horse near Mt Leura,The Argus, 4 March 1851 His brother, Adolphus, also died young. He was Superintendent of Mails in Melbourne when he died in 1868 of consumption, aged just 33.  Investigations by Sievwright into suspected criminal acts between Europeans and Aboriginal people  *Crown prisoners John Davis and Abraham Brackbrook, assigned to work on William Boucher Bowerman's sheep station near the Julian Range deep in the Western District, were investigated by Sievwright for shooting dead two Aboriginal men early in 1839. The bodies were moved and burned. NSW Attorney-General John Hubert Plunkett declined to prosecute the men for murder. Instead, at their trial in Melbourne in August, Davis and Brackbrook faced two counts: burning the bodies with a view to defeating the ends of justice; and indecently burning the bodies \\"contrary to civilised usage\\". A jury found both defendants not guilty on both counts as self defence was considered to have taken place.Cannon, Michael (ed.) (1983), Historical Records of Victoria: Foundation series; Vol 2B; Aborigines and protectors 1838-1839, Melbourne, Victorian Government printer, p.642-3 ; Port Phillip Patriot 8 August 1839 and Port Phillip Gazette 14 August 1839 *In September 1839, Sievwright charged Crown prisoners William Edwards and John Cooke with illegally keeping Aboriginal women in their hut. They were convicted in the Geelong Court, and sentenced to receive a punishment of 50 lashes each.Cannon, Michael (ed.) (1983), Historical Records of Victoria: Foundation series; Vol 2B; Aborigines and protectors 1838-1839, Melbourne, Victorian Government printer, p.652-3 *Towards the end of 1839, Sievwright investigated the Murdering Gully massacre of 35 - 40 Djargurd Wurrung Aboriginal people, taking statements from surviving witnesses. Sievright complained to the Chief Protector that he had not been given transport help to make the month-long trip to the scene sooner, allowing the chief suspect, overseer Frederick Taylor, to abscond. \\"Had the means been at my disposal of making the investigation...at the time the report was first made to me, there is little doubt but that the individual, who has now escaped, would ere this have had to answer for his fiendish and inhuman conduct,\\" he wrote.Cannon, Michael (ed.) (1983), Historical Records of Victoria: Foundation series; Vol 2B; Aborigines and protectors 1838-1839, Melbourne, Victorian Government printer, p.668 Taylor left Victoria for several years after the event, and was never prosecuted. *In March 1840, Sievwright investigated the Fighting Hills massacre on a new frontier run on a tributary of the Wannon River recently taken up by English brothers - George, James, John, Pringle and William Whyte. They and their shepherds freely admitted between 30 and 80 Aborigines had been killed. In a subsequent clash involving the Whytes, also investigated by Sievwright, an unknown number of Aboriginal people died. However, Port Phillip's Crown Prosecutor, James Croke, declined to prosecute. He ruled that in both cases, the Aborigines appeared to have been the aggressors, making the conviction of the Whytes \\"very uncertain\\". As well, Sievwright should not have recorded their statements under oath. Such statements could not be used in evidence against them.UK House of Commons, Sessional Papers, 1844, vol. 34, pp. 135-143: Croke to Robinson 15 and 17 June 1840; La Trobe to Gipps, 26 November 1840; La Trobe to Gipps 28 August 1841 *Also in March 1840, Sievwright investigated a report of the killing of five Aborigines at the Tahara station of the Irish brothers, George, Samuel and Trevor Winter. The killings were said to be retaliation for attacking shepherds and carrying off some sheep. The Reverend Joseph Orton later noted in his journal:Journal of Rev. J. Orton, entry for 12 January 1841, Ms A1715, Mitchell Library > \\"The alleged cause of the attack was the aggressions of the natives, in > stealing sheep. The attack of the Europeans was equally atrocious and > unjustifiable, the result of which was that according to the depositions at > least five natives were killed. This occurrence was on a station of Winter‚Äôs > who appears to have taken active part in the performance.\\" *In April 1840, Sievwright investigated two incidents involving servants of the Henty brothers. In one incident, a shepherd named Blood was accused of shooting an Aboriginal man in both legs, one of which was now in \\"a state of mortification\\". Sievwright issued a warrant for Blood's arrest, but he had absconded. In the other incident on the station of Francis Henty, three Aboriginal men had been shot dead. Again, all three suspects had absconded.; Sievwright to Robinson, 14 April 1840 and enclosed statements, VPRS 21, Public Record Office of Victoria * Sandford George Bolden of Layton, \\"indicted for feloniously firing a pistol loaded with ball at an Aboriginal native\\". * Richard Hill, charged as one of the principals in the murder of three Aboriginal women (one pregnant) and one male child at Muston's Creek on the 23 Feb, 1842 on Thomas Osbrey and Sidney Smith's leased ‚ÄòCaramut‚Äô run.

The original firm was founded in 1873. It is primarily known for its real estate brokerage and management divisions that have catered to wealthy buyers and sellers.  Early history  After graduating from college, Charles Stelle Brown went into the real estate business in New York City in 1873. He specialized in valuations and appraisals. A descendant of Dutch settlers in the area, Brown was born in New York. His business was immediately successful. In 1901, Brown formed a partnership with the prominent New York real estate broker Douglas Robinson. Robinson was married to the former Corinne Roosevelt, sister of President Theodore Roosevelt. The new partnership was called Douglas Robinson, Charles S. Brown Company. On Robinson's staff was appraiser Francis K. Stevens. Stevens began his real estate career with the Astor Bank after graduating from Yale in 1897. He joined Robinson's office in 1901. Stevens remained with the merged companies. While Robinson and Brown increasingly handled many high-profile transactions in the city, another broker was making his mark in the field. Duncan G. Harris began his real estate career as an assistant to real estate tycoon John Jacob Astor in 1901, the year after he graduated from Harvard. In 1907, Harris began his own firm, Harris & Vaughan. He later partnered with Douglas Vought and, in 1914, the company name changed to Harris, Vought & Co. William H. Wheelock joined the Robinson Brown firm after he graduated from Harvard in 1898. Starting in the maintenance department, Wheelock rose through the ranks to become a vice president and director in 1902. When Robinson died in 1918, Wheelock was elected president of the firm. In 1922, Wheelock and Harris arranged a merger of their two firms and the new company was named Brown, Wheelock, Harris, Vought & Co. When Vought left the firm in 1931, the name changed to Brown, Wheelock, Harris & Co. Charles S. Brown died at 85 in 1935. He held the title of chairman of the board. He was a trustee or director of several insurance and banking companies and non-profit groups. He lived at 535 Park Avenue. In 1938, Wheelock took Brown's title of chairman and Harris become president. The firm's main office was at 67 Wall Street. When the new titles were announced, it was noted that Wheelock had participated in the sale of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and the assemblage of the land for the Pennsylvania Railroad Station. When Wheelock died in 1942, he was also credited with assembling property for New York Hospital, Presbyterian Hospital and the Brooks Brothers and Gimbels stores. At the time of Wheelock's death, the firm had the name Brown, Wheelock, Harris, Stevens, Inc. By 1948, the name of the company was Brown, Harris, Stevens. Harris, who had been president since 1938, took the title of chairman of the board in 1951. Henry Forster, vice president, become president. Another Harvard graduate, Forster had joined the company in 1913. In 1959, Forster stepped down as president and became vice chairman; John W. Lonsdale became president; and Harris remained as chairman of the board. Lonsdale had been a vice president of the firm since 1941. Forster retired from the firm in 1960 but continued to work in real estate. He finally retired from William A. White & Sons in 1984 after his 95th birthday. He died at age 100 in 1989. After his death, the Real Estate Board of New York established the Henry Forster Award for ‚Äúoutstanding record of achievement and conduct ‚Äì both within the industry and in the community.‚Äù The award was given to a member of the profession \\"whose career accomplishment brings credit to the residential brokerage community.\\" The first award was given in 1990.  The Helmsley years  New York real estate investor Harry Helmsley purchased the company in 1965. Helmsley retained Harris as chairman. Paul J. Etzel was president. Helmsley said he would keep the company, which was mainly known for its residential brokerage and management services, separate from his commercial companies. In 1970, Harris died at age 93. Seven top agents and executives from rival Douglas Elliman moved to Brown Harris Stevens in 1988. Angered by Elliman's management policies and the firing of executive Roger Tuckerman, the group moved to Brown Harris Stevens along with the management of many buildings at prestigious addresses. Tuckerman later became president of Brown Harris Stevens. Hall Willkie, one of the executives who left Elliman, became sales director. The Helmsley real estate empire suffered when Helmsley's wife Leona was convicted for federal income tax evasion and other crimes in 1989. After serving nineteen months in prison and dealing with her husband's declining health, Mrs. Helmsley put the company on the market in 1992. In 1994, more than 80 individual New York real estate property managers and companies pled guilty to charges of bribery by Manhattan District Attorney's office. The managers were found to have been extorting millions of dollars annually from contractors working in buildings managed by the companies. A total of fourteen real estate management companies were found to have employees involved in the schemes. Brown Harris Stevens saw 17 of its agents indicted. The company acknowledged that it failed to properly supervise the managers and made more than $1 million in restitution payments. The company was the exclusive sales agent for the sale of the cooperative apartment owned by the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in early 1995. The 14-room apartment was sold to industrialist David Koch for $9.5 million.  Current ownership  In March of 1995, Helmsley sold the company to a partnership led by brothers Arthur and William Lie Zeckendorf and Kent Swig. The three were active real estate investors and developers whose families were also in the real estate business. The Zeckendorf brothers' father was William Zeckendorf, Jr. and grandfather was William Zeckendorf, Sr., both real estate developers. Swig's father was San Francisco real estate investor Melvin Swig. In 2000, after five years, the number of buildings managed by the company went from 98 to 170. On the brokerage side of the business, the number of agents grew to a total of 160 from 58 and closed sales went from $250‚Äì300 million to $1.3 billion. The company's the headquarters was located at 770 Lexington Avenue with Manhattan sales offices on the east side, west side, downtown and another office in Palm Beach, Florida. Aside from Swig and the Zeckendorf brothers, the other partner was David A. Burris. The owners of Brown Harris Stevens purchased Halstead Property Company in 2001. The combined companies made the firm the second largest in New York, behind Douglas Elliman. The combined sales volume of the two companies would be close to $3 billion and number of agents was 635. In the previous two years, Brown Harris Stevens purchased one of the city's largest rental brokerage firms, Feathered Nest. In 2001, Hall F. Willkie was named president of the company's residential sales division. In his new position, Willkie was charged with overseeing the company's 190 residential sales agents. He had been executive vice president with the company. Edward Lee Cave Inc., a 28 year old firm noted for its high-end sales, was taken over by Brown Harris Stevens in 2009. For the year ended on February 29, 2016, Brown Harris Steven had closed 789 sales totaling $2.02 billion. In 2017, the company was the exclusive agent for the sale of David Rockefeller‚Äôs upper east side town house. The asking price was $32.5 million. Bess Freedman, an executive with the company, was named co-president with Hall Willkie in 2017. At that time, the company had about 500 agents and closed more than $4 billion in sales in the previous year in NYC. Less than an year later, she was promoted to Chief Executive Officer.  Restructuring  In June of 2020, Terra Holdings announced that its subsidiaries Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead would restructure to form one unified company operating under the Brown Harris Stevens Brand. The move created one of the largest privately held real estate services companies with more than 2,500 agents and 55 offices across New York City, Connecticut, New Jersey, the Hudson Valley, the Hamptons, Palm Beach and Miami. Combined, the two firms had more than $9 billion in sales in 2019.

After winning two minor races he was gelded before returning in the summer of 2018 to win two more races including the Gordon Stakes as well as finishing second in the Great Voltigeur Stakes and fourth in the King George V Stakes. In autumn he was sent to Australia and on 6 November he became the first British-trained horse to win the Melbourne Cup. In 2019 he won the Dubai Gold Cup. Background Cross Counter is a bay gelding with a large white star bred and owned by Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation. He was sent into training with Charlie Appleby in Newmarket, Suffolk. He was from the seventh crop of foals sired by the Teofilo the undefeated European Champion Two-Year-Old of 2006. Teofilo's other European offspring have included Trading Leather, Pleascach and Parish Hall: he has also had great success in Australia where his major winners have included Happy Clapper, Humidor and Kermadec. Cross Counter's dam Waitress showed little ability on the track, failing to win in four races. As a descendant of the broodmare Rahaam she was closely related to Cassandra Go, Halfway to Heaven, Rhododendron and Magical. Racing career=2017: two-year-old season= Cross Counter made his racecourse debut on 9 December when he started at odds of 7/2 for a minor race over eight and a half furlong on the synthetic Tapeta surface at Wolverhampton Racecourse. Ridden by Adam Kirby he recovered from a slow start to take the lead a furlong out and pulled away to win by two and a quarter lengths. =2018: three-year-old season= Six weeks after his first appearance, with Kirby again in the saddle Cross Counter returned to Wolverhampton for a race over nine and a half furlongs. Starting the 4/9 favourite he took the lead in the last quarter mile and steadily increased his advantage to win \\"easily\\" by eight lengths. He wa then gelded and was off the track for four and a half months. Cross Counter returned for a minor event at Sandown Park on 7 June in which he was ridden by William Buick and finished second of the fourteen runners behind Elwazir. Two weeks later he was assigned top weight of 132 pounds for the King George V Stakes at Royal Ascot. He made steady progress in the straight without looking likely to win and came home fourth behind the Mark Johnston Baghdad. Over the same course and distance in July, the gelding started 13/8 favourite against six opponents for a handicap race in which he was partnered by Kirby. After being restrained at the rear of the field he moved forward to take the lead approaching the final furlong and won by two lengths. At Goodwood Racecourse on 4 August Cross Counter was stepped up in class to contest the Group 3 Gordon Stakes, a race which often serves as a major trial for the St Leger over one and a half miles. The race attracted only four runners and Cross Counter was made the 7/4 second choice in the betting behind Dee Ex Bee, a colt who had finished second in the Epsom Derby. After taking the lead soon after the start he broke away from his rivals in the straight and came home four and a half lengths clear of Dee Ex Bee despite being eased down by Buick in the final strides. The winning time of 2:31.39 was reported to be a new track record. As a gelding, Cross Counter was ineligible to run in the St Leger and there was speculation that he would be sent to Australia to contest the Melbourne Cup. Charlie Appleby's assistant Alex Merriam said \\"he's improving all the time. He's a big raw horse and I think there is some more improvement to come. He's been gelded ‚Äì he was a bit of a boy back in the day and Charlie thought it was the best thing to do\\". Eighteen days later at York Racecourse the gelding started favourite for the Group 2 Great Voltigeur Stakes. He produced a sustained run in the last quarter mile but failed by a head to overhaul his stablemate Old Persian. After the race Appleby commented \\"The Melbourne Cup has always been the plan for Cross Counter and hopefully this will put an extra half-kilo on his back and get him into the race. I didn‚Äôt want to take him to Australia and run in a prep-race ‚Äî not as a three-year-old. I want to run him off the plane\\". Melbourne Cup On 14 September Cross Counter was one of 27 British horses to enter quarantine preparatory to being flown to Australia for the prestigious Spring Carnival meeting. After arriving in Melbourne on 29 September and emerging from quarantine two weeks later the Godolphin contingent showed excellent form: Best Solution won the Caulfield Cup, while Benbatl won the Caulfield Stakes before running second to the great mare Winx in the Cox Plate. In the Melbourne Cup over two miles at Flemington Racecourse on 6 November Cross Counter was assigned a weight of 51 kg (approximately 112 pounds or 8.0 stones) and was partnered by Kerrin McEvoy who had won the race previously on Brew and Almandin as well as having ridden several major winners for Godolphin in Europe. He started at odds of 8/1 in 24-runner field which included Best Solution, Cliffs of Moher, Yucatan (Herbert Power Stakes), Magic Circle (Chester Cup), Youngstar (Queensland Oaks), Marmelo (Prix Maurice de Nieuil), Muntahaa (Ebor Handicap) and Avilius (The Bart Cummings). The Cup had been won by horses from France, Ireland, Germany and Japan, but despite eight second-place finishes, no British-trained horse had ever won the world's most valuable and prestigious staying race. After racing towards the rear of the field for most of the way Cross Counter began to make progress on the final turn but still had at least fifteen horses in front of him entering the last 400 metres. Prince of Arran went to the front 200 metres out but was headed by Marmelo who looked the likely winner before Cross Counter came with a strong late run on the outside to win by a length. Prince of Arran was two lengths back in third to complete a 1-2-3 for British-trained horses. Appleby said \\"You can‚Äôt realise the delight of winning this race. It is known around the world as a seriously great race and to think we can bring it home to England is incredible. We have been trying very hard, but finally we have cracked it... He is a wonderful young horse\\". The result of the race, following the success of Rekindling in 2017 led to questions about the weights assigned to Northern-hemisphere three-year-olds with Racing Victoria's senior handicapper Greg Carpenter saying \\"the way in which we integrate them into the handicap will be reviewed and evolve\\". In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Cross Counter was given a rating of 117, making him the 118th best horse in the world and the sixth-best horse over extended distances. =2019: four- year-old season= Cross Counter made his first appearance of 2019 in the Dubai Gold Cup over 3200 metres at Meydan Racecourse on 30 March. Ridden by Buick he started the 7/4 favourite with the best fancied of his nine opponents being his stablemate Ispolini (Nad Al Sheba Trophy) and the Prix du Cadran winner Call The Wind. Cross Counter raced just behind the leaders before taking the lead 300 metres from the finish and won \\"comfortably\\" by a length and a quarter from Ispolini. Appleby commented \\"It was a tough ask to go to Australia as a 3-year-old and win the Melbourne Cup. It's always in the back of your mind whether it took a bit out of him, and this was our first opportunity to run him since then. He's answered all the questions we needed to know\\". On his first start in Europe for almost ten months Cross Counter started the 4/1 third choice in the betting for the two and a half mile Ascot Gold Cup on 20 June. After being restrained towards the rear of the eleven runner field he stayed on well on the outside in the straight but was unable to get to the front and came home fourth behind Stradivarius, Dee Ex Bee and Master of Reality, beaten just under two lengths by the winner. He started 3/1 second favourite for the Goodwood Cup on 30 July but after briefly taking the lead a furlong out he was overtaken in the closing stages and finished third behind Stradivarius and Dee Ex Bee. On his final European start of the year the gelding was sent to Ireland and started 4/6 favourite for the Irish St. Leger at the Curragh. He raced in mid-division before making steady progress in the last quarter mile but never looked likely to win and finished fourth behind the three-year-old filly Search For A Song. On 5 November Cross Counter carried top weight of 57.5 kg as he attempted to repeat his 2018 victory in the Melbourne Cup. With Buick in the saddle he kept on well in the last 400 metres and although he came home eighth of the twenty-four runners he finished less than two lengths behind the winner Vow And Declare.

He was a leading figure in promoting abstract sculptures in Japan after the Second World War. He incorporated bronze and all kinds of materials such as iron, aluminum, plastic, acrylic, cement, etc. In the 1980s he started to work with plywood.  Biography  Tatehata was born in Shiroyama, Wakayama (now Aridagawa) on 22 April 1919. He was the eldest son of sculptor Taimu Tatebashi. He graduated from the Tokyo Art School (now Tokyo University of the Arts) sculpture major in 1941, exhibited at Nitten and received a special recognition. He was interested in the relationship between the entities that compose the sculpture and the space that does not take advantage of it. He shifted from academic concrete sculpture to avant-garde abstract sculpture. In 1950 he was influenced by a sculpture with a hole in the body by the abstract sculptor Henry Moore, and in 1950 he formed a sculpture department in the Association of Movement Art. From 1953 to 1955 he studied in France, participating in many exhibitions such as the Salon de Mai. After returning home, he made geometric shapes combining metal and other materials and became active as one of the pioneers of Japanese abstract sculpture in the 1950s. WAVING FIGURE (1998, Shimane Art Museum) Since 1959 he has taught sculpture as a professor at Tama Art University and has received numerous awards such as the Kotaro Takamura Prize, the Nyujiro Nakahara Award, the Nagano City Outdoor Sculpture Award, the Henry Moore Grand Prize Exceptional Award, and the Minister of Education award. In 2005 he was honored as a Person of Cultural Merit. Monuments and public arts were set up in plazas and schools in various places in his honor. His eldest son, Tanaka Takahata is also a sculptor and professor of art at the Nihon University College of Art.

The latter has been falsely attributed to Cyprian of Carthage, and therefore the author of De Rebaptisme is called 'Pseudo-Cyprian'.  Contents  According to Pseudo-Cyprian, the Preaching of Paul is a \\"heretical forgery\\", which, amongst other things, claims that Jesus had once confessed his sins. The Baptism of Jesus would have been performed in order to cleanse him of sin. These claims went against the proto-orthodox teaching that Jesus (and his mother Mary) had always been free of sins. Moreover, several events that do not fit with Pseudo-Cyprian's understanding of history are recorded in the Preaching of Paul, such as Paul and Peter meeting each other for the first time in Rome, even though they must have met each other before at the Council of Jerusalem. Therefore, Pseudo-Cyprian argued, the writing should be excluded from the Bible. Thus, it is counted amongst the New Testament apocrypha.  Scholarship  The original text of the Preaching of Paul has not survived, so its contents are unknown. English theologian Joseph Lightfoot (1828‚Äì1889) noted that Pseudo-Cyprian tried to invalidate the Praedicatio Pauli by \\"show[ing] its thoroughly unhistorical character; and among other instances he alleges the fact that it makes St Peter and St Paul meet in Rome as if for the first time, forgetting all about the congress at Jerusalem, the collision at Antioch, and so forth.\\" German New Testament scholar Wilhelm Schneemelcher (1914‚Äì2003) concluded that the writing probably did exist and was written between 150 and 250 CE, but should not be confused with the Kerygmata of Peter nor with the Acts of Paul.

The launch of this organization was prompted by the Sinjar massacre, a religious persecution of the Yazidi people in Sinjar, Iraq by ISIS in 2014.  History  Murad, a survivor of the Sinjar massacre who escaped ISIS capture, created Nadia‚Äôs Initiative in January 2018 to \\"provide long term, holistic approaches to healing traumatized victims of mass atrocities, by developing and supporting field programs in the areas of healthcare, psychosocial support, and education for women and children\\" and \\"countering global terrorism through public awareness.\\" In 2017, as part of the goal to counter terrorism, Nadia Murad pressured the United Nations Security Council to launch an investigation into the actions of ISIS against the Yazidi people. The result, UN Resolution 2379, was passed on 21 September 2017 and \\"authorized the creation of an independent team to investigate crimes committed by ISIL in Iraq ... this team is designed to investigate and preserve evidence relating to genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. This is to aid in bringing charges against those responsible for such atrocities.\\" In January 2018, Nadia‚Äôs Initiative undertook an assessment of Sinjar to better understand the obstacles delaying redevelopment efforts and document the current state of the region. The report identifies projects for redevelopment, such as reconstructing facilities, communication networks, education & healthcare infrastructures, and establishing economic opportunities for returnees. With many active landmines in the Sinjar region, de-mining the area was the first priority for the foundation. In July 2018, Nadia's Initiative announced that after several months of work, de-mining operations in Sinuni, a sub-district in the Yazidi homeland of Sinjar, had been restarted. The Initiative stated, \\"This important effort ... will help to ensure the survival of the Yazidi community.\\" With most de-mining efforts already successfully completed, Nadia's Initiative has now shifted focus to large scale sustainable development initiatives to provide much needed services to returnees in the Sinjar region. These initiatives focus on health, education, livelihoods, women's empowerment, and WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene). Ongoing work The first priority of the Initiative is rebuilding the Yazidi ancestral homeland of Sinjar to restore services and infrastructure to those who have returned to the region and incentivize the return of those still displaced. Nadia‚Äôs Initiative works with the local Yazidi community and a variety of implementing partners on the ground in Sinjar to design and support projects that promote the restoration of education, healthcare, livelihoods, WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene), and women‚Äôs empowerment in the region. All Nadia‚Äôs Initiative programs are community-driven and survivor- centric, and work to promote long term peace-building. Nadia‚Äôs Initiative advocates governments and international organizations to support efforts to rebuild Sinjar, seek justice for Yazidis, improve security in the region, and support survivors of sexual violence worldwide. Nadia‚Äôs Initiative is uniquely positioned to facilitate the re-development of Sinjar due to its extensive knowledge and understanding of the political, cultural, and economic complexities of the region. Nadia‚Äôs Initiative brings a comprehensive peace- building approach to the process of rebuilding and recognizes that reconstruction efforts must be developed locally - local solutions to local problems. This type of approach will empower survivors and re-establish a sense of community in the region. Nadia‚Äôs Initiative strongly believes in making survivors, particularly women and children, an active voice in the peace-building process. As of 2020, Nadia's Initiative's programs are project to directly benefit over 65,000 returnees to the region. =Connections with other organizations= Nadia's Initiative has partnered with Yazda, an organization that \\"aims to prevent future genocides against the Yazidi community and other minorities and to assist them in recovery from the 2014 genocide,\\" to maximize their impact \\"through donations and contributions.\\" In October 2018, Nadia's Initiative announced that it was \\"grateful to The Big Heart Foundation for supporting its work to engage global leaders in peace building initiatives to rebuild Sinjar.\\" The Big Heart Foundation was formed to support people in need by providing healthcare, education, and emergency aid services. Nadia's Initiative stated that it established a partnership with Mines Advisory Group (MAG), an organization that seeks to \\"find and destroy landmines, cluster munitions and unexploded bombs in places affected by conflict in order to assist in de-mining Sinjar.\\" Since 2019, Nadia's Initiative has partnered with a variety of implementing partners on the ground in Sinjar including USAID, IOM Iraq, Dorcas Aid International, Mission East, La Chaine De L'espoir, and a variety of local NGOs. Funding The co- recipient of the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize, Nadia Murad, donated her prize winnings of $500,000 to support Nadia's Initiative.

It is a short, \\"big concept\\" book on the future of humanity and on potential dangers, such as nuclear warfare, climate change, biotech, and artificial intelligence, and the possibility of human extinction.  Ideas  As with his 2003 Our Final Century, Rees warns that human civilization faces grave existential risks. Rees considers a scenario 20 years from now, where carbon dioxide levels have continued to rise, and where climate models have improved. There is a possibility the improved models will predict imminent catastrophe, in which case there might emerge political pressure to immediately deploy poorly- understood geo-engineering techniques. In order to mitigate this \\"nightmare\\" scenario, Rees advocates that we start exploring these techniques now, so as to better understand their limitations, risks, and side effects. Other risks include nuclear war, an asteroid strike, rogue biotechnology, or artificial intelligence. Rees advocates that nations empower supra-national institutions to better collaborate against such risks, a difficult task given the populist trends against globalism. Some scholars, such as Stephen Hawking, have advocated space colonization as a way to mitigate existential risk; Rees breaks with Hawking on this matter and criticizes space colonization as \\"a dangerous delusion to think that space offers an escape from Earth's problems\\".  Reception  Vanity Fair assessed the book as \\"uncontroversial... written in a way that's accessible to the general reader, and sprinkled with moments of infectious awe.\\" Scientific American recommended the book as a \\"spirited assessment of technology's role in shaping our future\\".

It was established in 1960 as an institute and training center for psychoanalysis and psychosomatic medicine. Renamed in 1964, it is now called after Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. Since 1995 the institution has been dedicated entirely to research.  Purpose  The declared aims of the Sigmund Freud Institute (SFI) are both research on social psychology/sociology, psychology and medicine/psychosomatic and also promotion of young scientists. The research is focused on the psychic effects of societal change, the foundations of psychoanalysis, prevention and psychotherapy research, and psychoanalytic and sociology-psychological analyses of present-day developments.The SFI at the official Website of Frankfurt am Main The Sigmund Freud Institute past and present, has brought to fruition numerous research projects of a clinical, psychoanalytic, sociology-psychological or trans-disciplinary nature.The Measured Life ‚Äì Productive and Counterproductive Consequences of Quantification in the Digitally Optimising Society  History  Memorial plaque for Karl Landauer on the fa√ßade of the Sigmund Freud Institute File:FFM Karl-Landauer- Gedenktafel.jpg As early as 1929-1933, the city already had a psychoanalytic research group, from which the Frankfurt Psychoanalytic Institute emerged.Die Er√∂ffnung des Frankfurter Psychoanalytischen Instituts 1929 (PDF, German source,) Among its founders and staff were psychoanalysts like Karl Landauer, Heinrich Meng,Heinrich Meng zum Ged√§chtnis Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, Erich Fromm and Siegmund Fuchs (who later called himself S.H. Foulkes). In 1933, after the seizure of power by the National Socialists, the Psychoanalytic Institute was closed down.Geschichte des Frankfurter Psychoanalytischen Instituts (FPI) All five analysts working there went into exile. Landauer fled to the Netherlands, where he was captured by the German occupying forces. In January 1945 he died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp from the effects of his incarceration there. On 27 April 1960, the Institute and Training Centre for Psychoanalysis and Psychosomatic Medicine was officially established. The new foundation had been supported by the social scientists Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno and in particular by the minister- president of Hesse, Georg-August Zinn.Psychoanalysis International, V.1: A Guide to Psychoanalysis Anna Freud hailed its opening as the beginning of a ‚Äúnew psychoanalytic era in Germany.‚Äù The first director was Alexander Mitscherlich who in novel way combined the study of the unconscious with the social-psychological analysis of society. In 1964 the institute was renamed Sigmund Freud Institute. Alongside research and psycho-therapeutic care, the institution was dedicated to the training of doctors and psychologists wishing to become psychoanalysts. The training was carried out on the basis of the guidelines laid down by the German Psychoanalytic Association (German website) and the International Psychoanalytic Association. On 14 October 1964, the institute moved to Myliusstrasse 30 in the Westend district of Frankfurt. The SFI retained its dual structure (training and research) until 1995. From 1959 to 1994 the institute had the legal status of a Landesbeh√∂rde (state authority/agency) under the aegis of the state of Hesse's Ministry of Science and the Arts.Intellektuelle in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland: Verschiebungen im politischen Feld der 1960er und 1970er Jahre After Mitscherlich left in 1976, the institute was headed successively by Clemens de Boor, Dieter Ohlmeier and Horst-Eberhard Richter, and Marianne Leuzinger-Bohleber and Rolf Haubl. Major figures teaching and researching at the SFI include Tobias Brocher, Hermann Argelander,Argelander at the Sigmund-Freud-Institut in Frankfurt Alfred Lorenzer, Klaus Horn and Helmut Dahmer. The present executive directors are Vera King and Patrick Meurs, Heinz Wei√ü is in charge of the outpatient department.  Organisation  In 1995 the SFI was transformed into a public-law foundation and since then has dedicated itself exclusively to research, in close conjunction with the Universities of Frankfurt and Kassel. Funding for the foundation comes from the federal state of Hesse. Since 1995 psychoanalytic training has been provided by independent Frankfurt (training) institutes. After the move to No. 20 Myliusstrasse in the Westend district of Frankfurt, a new Psychoanalytic Centre was established there, adding legally independent psychoanalytic institutions to the SFI under the same roof. These are the Frankfurt Psychoanalytic Institute, the Institute for Analytic Child and Adolescent Psychotherapy in Hesse, the Frankfurt Work Group for Psychoanalytic Pedagogy, and the Frankfurt am Main Jewish Psychotherapeutic Counselling Centre for Children, Adolescents, and Adults. Since 2016 the executive directors have been Vera KingVera King's research on Google Scholar (in the framework of a joint professorship for sociology and psychoanalytic social psychology with the University of Frankfurt)No-holds- barred self-revelation, dreams and destructive moments in the works of Austrian artist Richard Gerstl. , Patrick Meurs ( in the framework of a joint professorship for psychoanalysis with the University of Kassel),Interview zum Thema Integration: ‚ÄûNicht allen Kindern tut das Sprachbad gut‚Äú and Heinz Wei√ü (chief physician at the Robert Bosch Hospital in Stuttgart Heinz Weiss Sigmund-Freud-Institut ¬∑ Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, Robert_bosch- Krankenhaus, Stuttgart ).

The Science Council defines a technician as ‚Äúa person who is skilled in the use of particular techniques and procedures to solve practical problems, often in ways that require considerable ingenuity and creativity. Technicians typically work with complex instruments and equipment, and require specialised training, as well as considerable practical experience, in order to do their job effectively‚Äù. Science technicians are frequently based in laboratories, but they also perform roles in workshops, studios, the field, or in any location where scientific work is being carried out. As a group, science technicians have been referred to as \\"Invisible\\"; members of the scientific workforce whose role in the process for forming new scientific knowledge has been poorly acknowledged and insufficiently studied. However, more recently their role has been studied in some detail. Profession Professional training for science technicians varies between countries. In Germany, where science technicians are a subset of the \\"technical assistant\\" class of professions, state-certified technician training is a vocational training that lasts between two and three years. It allows specializations in, for instants, physics, chemistry, pharmacy, medicine and computer science, among others. In the UK, historically, Science technicians have been able to either join the professional body relating to the scientific field in which they work (for example, the Royal Society of Chemistry or the Institute of Physics) or the Institute of Science and Technology which is a professional organisation specifically for technical and specialist staff. Via a professional body or the Science Council Science technicians have been able to gain professional registration as a chartered scientist (CSci) or Registered Scientist (RSci). Since 2011, Science technicians have also been able to gain status as Registered Science Technicians (RSciTech).

The battle resulted in one ruler, Ken Arok, defeating his rival and routing their army. The battle cemented Arok's control over Eastern Java, and resulted in the ruler founding the Rajasa dynasty.  History  From the 8th to the 12th century, the island of Java was ruled by a number of kings and noble families. In the eastern part of the island, agriculture-centric feudal nations (namely the Sailendra, Kediri, Tumapel, and Majapahit kingdoms) intermittently fought over arable land on which to grow rice. In the early 13th century, these combatants were challenged by the emergence of a new political force in the region.Komandoko, Gamal (2010). Student and General Encyclopedias . Widyatama Library. . This challenger came in the form of Ken Arok, a peasant-turned village chief who sought to increase his political power; later Javanese folklore surrounding the figure would add that Arok was endowed with a great sense of personal ambition. Arok succeeded in aligning his village with the Kingdom of Tumapel, and in doing so became an important adviser the nation's king, Tunggul Ametung. After a series of machinations, Arok became king himself after he avenged Tunggul by killing the latter's assassin; some stories speculate that Arok arranged this same assassination or killed Ametung himself.\\"Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, From Angkor Wat to East Timor (3 Volume Set)\\" by Keat Ooi. Having replaced Ametung as King of Tumapel, Arok began to consolidate his military and political power to make war against the Kingdom of Kediri, Tumapel's longtime rival. The king of Kediri, Kertajaya, likewise marshaled his forces and prepared to meet Arok in battle. The climactic engagement of the conflict took place in either 1221 or 1222 at a place called Genter (also called Ganter) in eastern Kediri. During the battle, Arok defeated Kertajaya (either by killing him or forcing him to surrender), causing the rout of the Kedirian army.C≈ìd√®s, George (1968). The Indianized states of Southeast Asia. University of Hawaii Press. . pp. 185‚Äì187,199 The battle fought at Genter marked the end of the Kingdom of Kediri. On the opposing side, the victory of his forces at the Battle of Genter allowed for Arok to establish his own royal line; this linage became the Rajasa dynasty, which ruled over the Kingdom of Singhasari.

Joshua Pulumo Mohapeloa, ca. 1930s  Early life  Joshua Mohapeloa, a member of the Bataung clan, was born in Molumong in Lesotho, Southern Africa. Joshua Mohapeloa's family converted to Christianity in the 19th century. Both his grandfather Joel Mohapeloa and his father Joel Mohapeloane Mohapeloa were reverends, and it is evident from his works that Christianity influenced Joshua Mohapeloa. After completing his elementary schooling, Joshua Mohapeloa enrolled at the PEMS (Paris Evangelical Missionary Society) mission institution Morija Training College from 1923 to 1927. It was at Morija Training College that he studied music and music education, completing his Junior Certificate in 1927.  Education  In 1928 Joshua Mohapeloa enrolled at Fort Hare College, and in 1929 completed his teacher training. Joshua Mohapeloa also enrolled at the University of the Witwatersrand and became a student of Percival Kirby.  Musical Influence  From the early 1930s to 1937, Joshua Mohapeloa was active as the choirmaster of the then Morija Choristers. A number of Mohapeloa's own works began to be performed by the Choristers during this time. In 1935 his first collection of compositions, titled \\"Meloli le Lithalerre tsa Afrika\\", was published by the Morija Printing Press and Book Depot. Joshua Mohapeloa is renowned for composing musical works that blended SeSotho themes with Western styles. Joshua Mohapeloa's ambition was at times stifled as is evident in correspondence between T. Mashologu, Counsellor in the office of Lesotho‚Äôs High Commission in London, and Hugh Tracey; and in the words of Bonisile Gcisa (an author and expert on the African choral music) at a commemoration event in honor of Johsua Mohapeloa in 2015, where Gcisa stated that Joshua Mohapeloa faced a number of challenges, including attempts by the missionaries to suppress his talent.  Awards  Joshua Mohapeloa was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by the British Government in 1961 according to the 1961 Birthday Honours listing, or 1964 according to Huskisson. In 1974 he was awarded the Knight Commander of Ramts'eatsane by Lesotho. He is furthermore known as Poet Laureate of Kingdom of Lesotho.

Railway career  By 1866 Curnow had settled in Ipswich, Queensland, as a railway storekeeper, a position made necessary by the opening of the Ipswich-Grandchester railway line. He was promoted in January 1877 to the position of Chief Clerk in the Railway Commissioner's Office, a position second only to that of the Commissioner. The offices for the staff of the Secretary for Railways in Queensland were established on the grounds of the original Brisbane Terminal Station at Roma Street, possibly in the early Brisbane Grammar School, resumed for railway purposes. In January 1884 Curnow was promoted to be the position of Acting Commissioner for Railways and on 12 March 1885 was again promoted to the position of Commissioner for Railways. Curnow was the third person to hold this position, superseding Arthur Orpen Herbert who became the Under Secretary for Railways. During the time of Curnow's employment as Commissioner of Railways, the Railways Act (1888) was introduced to create a Board of three Commissioners to oversee decision making in the railways, in a bid to reduce political influence. The appointment of the Board of Commissioners on 29 July 1889 prompted Francis Curnow to retire from the railways with a pension of . He was soon after appointed Chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Commission, a position he held until shortly before his death.  Personal life  Curnow arrived in Queensland in March 1860 from Cornwall in Britain. In 1877 Curnow built a house Hellesvere for his home in Brisbane, close to his place of work. Hellesvere was a timber cottage with a steeply pitched corrugated iron roof containing an attic with dormer windows on the northern and southern sides. Curnow died on 24 April 1901 from heart failure caused by typhoid fever at his home Hellesvere. He was buried at Toowong Cemetery.

Grigory Yavlinsky, an economist and politician, was related to him. He underwent professional technical school (PTU) in 1931 and finished an engineering degree in 1936 at Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute (then Kharkiv V.I. Lenin Polytechnic Institute). As a student, he worked in the Kharkiv Electromechanical Plant. He became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (then All-Union Communist Party) in 1932, but was removed from the party in 1937. His exclusion from the party also cost him his work at the Moscow Power Engineering Institute (founded as Correspondence Power Engineering Institute). While little is known about his removal from the party, his membership and his position was restored in 1939. He would continue working in the institute until 1948, when he would obtain his Candidate of Sciences, the Soviet equivalent of a Doctor of Philosophy degree. Also by 1948, Yavlinsky became a senior associate of the USSR Academy of Science.  Second World War  While Yavlinsky was exempted from rendering military service for his scientific background and as head of the factory design bureau in the Moscow Power Engineering Institute, he still volunteered when the Second World War opened in the Soviet Union in 1941 as head of the Soviet artillery repair workshop. His service during the Battle of Stalingrad earned him the Medal \\"For the Defence of Stalingrad\\" in 1942. Also for his military service, he later received the Medal \\"For the Victory over Germany in the Great Patriotic War 1941‚Äì1945\\" and the Medal \\"For Valiant Labor in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945\\". Two years after, in 1944, he was recalled from the front to develop electric motor systems for artillery in the institute. For this work, he was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1949.  Contribution to nuclear physics  The world's first tokamak device is the T-1 Tokamak at the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow. The tokamak on a 1987 USSR stamp. The first attempts to build a practical fusion machine took place in the United Kingdom, where George Paget Thomson had selected the pinch effect as a promising technique in 1945. After several failed attempts to gain funding, he gave up and asked two graduate students, Stan Cousins and Alan Ware, to build a device out of surplus radar equipment. This was successfully operated in 1948, but showed no clear evidence of fusion and failed to gain the interest of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment. In 1948, Yavlinsky moved to the Kurchatov Institute (also known as the I. V. Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy, named after its head Igor Kurchatov). By this time, other Soviet scientists under Kurchatov such as Nobel Prize laureates Andrei Sakharov and Igor Tamm were working on the Soviet atomic bomb project. As for Yavlinsky, who was given his own laboratory in the institute, he was tasked to develop power supply systems. It did not take long before he also became involved in nuclear research. After developing the bomb, Sakharov and Tamm began work on the tokamak system in 1951. A tokamak () is a device that uses a powerful magnetic field to confine a hot plasma in the shape of a torus. The tokamak is one of several types of magnetic confinement devices being developed to produce controlled thermonuclear fusion power. The word tokamak is a transliteration of the Russian word , an acronym of either: * \\"—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–∏–¥–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –∫–∞–º–µ—Ä–∞ —Å –º–∞–≥–Ω–∏—Ç–Ω—ã–º–∏ –∫–∞—Ç—É—à–∫–∞–º–∏\\" (toroidal'naya kamera s magnitnymi katushkami) ‚Äî toroidal chamber with magnetic coils; or * \\"—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–∏–¥–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –∫–∞–º–µ—Ä–∞ —Å –∞–∫—Å–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–º –º–∞–≥–Ω–∏—Ç–Ω—ã–º –ø–æ–ª–µ–º\\" (toroidal'naya kamera s aksial'nym magnitnym polem) ‚Äî toroidal chamber with axial magnetic field. The term was attributed to Igor Golovin. Sakharov and Tamm completed a much more detailed consideration of their original proposal, calling for a device with a major radius (of the torus as a whole) of and a minor radius (the interior of the cylinder) of . The proposal suggested the system could produce of tritium a day, or breed of U233 a day. However, Yavlinsky and another scientist, Golovin, considered developing another model focusing on more static toroidal arrangement. It was the development of the concept now known as the safety factor (labelled q in mathematical notation) that guided tokamak development; by arranging the reactor so this critical factor q was always greater than 1, the tokamaks strongly suppressed the instabilities that plagued earlier designs. Yavlinsky's model led to the creation of T-1, the first real tokamak, in 1958. The T-1 used both stronger external magnets and a reduced current compared to stabilized pinch machines like ZETA. Yavlinsky was already preparing the design of an even larger model, later built as T-3, the first large tokamak. With the apparently successful ZETA announcement, Yavlinsky's engineering concept became viewed as more acceptable. For his work on \\"powerful impulse discharges in a gas, to obtain unusually high temperatures needed for thermonuclear processes,\\" he was awarded the Lenin Prize and the Stalin Prize in 1958. Despite this success, Kurchatov asked Yavlinsky to develop a stellarator instead of finishing the T-3. Besides, as of 1961, the succeeding installation known as the T-2 began showing issues in the toroidal circuits. Nevertheless, Yavlinsky's design prevailed as other Soviet scientists began to favor the tokamak and persuaded Kurchatov to leave the stellarator research to the Americans.  Death  Yavlinsky was not to see the T-3 completed. On 28 July 1962, while travelling from Lviv to Sochi through Aeroflot Flight 415, he and his family died in an airplane crash at Gagra. While there has been speculation that his death was connected with politics, primarily over his intended developments in nuclear research, the government did not provide any clear indication that this was so. Despite his death, the T-3 was finished, and began to show successful results in compensating the inadequacies of other systems, including the stellarator, by 1965. The T-3 had then surpassed the Bohm limit ten times. Three years later, when the Soviets had achieved two main criteria in achieving nuclear fusion, namely the temperature level and the plasma confinement time, the so-called tokamak stampede had reached the United States.

The east wing was designed by Henry Cooper; and the designer of all other wingers in not known. The Argyle Stores were built from 1826 to 1878. It is also known as Argyle Bond Stores and Cleland Bond Store. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The first European development of the site was associated with the extension of Sydney's first Hospital, with the planting of herb and vegetable gardens on the later bond store site. The first building was a house commenced by Captain John Piper in 1826 at what became the east wing of the current stores, who sold it before completion to Mary Reiby in 1828. Frederick Unwin bought it later that year and completed the building in . Designed by architect Henry Cooper, the three level building had a dressed stone elevation to Argyle Street. Samuel Terry bought the site in 1831. The northern extension to the Customs House was completed by 1835. In 1839, Unwin again bought the site, and work commenced on 'Unwin's Bonded Stores'. These included an addition to the northern side of the Custom House and other buildings forming a courtyard in the middle. =East Wing (20 Argyle Street)= In 1826, construction of the East Wing was started under the supervision of Piper in his capacity as Naval Officer. As owner of the property, Piper sold the land and partially completed building to Mary Reiby in 1828, who in turn sold it to Frederick Unwin. In 1829 Unwin mortgaged the property and from 1830 the east wing was used as the \\"Custom House\\". Unwin regained ownership in 1838 and building construction resumed in 1839. Around 1844 goods such as brandy, wine, tea, cheese, tobacco, flour and sugar were stored. In 1845 the City Council Rates Book lists the Custom House as \\"two floors in bad repair\\". It was about this time that the transfer of the Custom House to Circular Quay commenced. =South Wing (14-16 Argyle Street)= The South wing appears to have remained vacant until . The map of 1835 shows a small building at the extreme west end of the wing. It appears that this may have been built at the time Henry Fisher was \\"Custom House Agent\\", and as the City Council Rate Book of 1845 lists this building as a house of three rooms, it may have been built as the residence for the \\"Custom House Agent\\". Three other small buildings had been built on the site when, in 1876, Isaac Ellis Ives bought the stores and began to expand their capacity. Part of this expansion involved the demolition of most of the existing south wing and the construction of a new wing . =West Wing (12 Argyle Street)= The West wing of the stores was built between 1840-1845. In 1845 the City Council Rates Book lists the entire west wing as \\"new stores\\" of \\"4 floors\\", tenanted by Henry Fisher and owned by Frederick Unwin. In 1854 the stores were purchased by R & E Tooth, brewers and merchants who occupied the west and north wings. During this period the building was used as a bonded and free store. There have been no major structural changes to the west wing since was built c. 1840.Orwell & Peter Phillips, 1990: Appendix A: Thorp, W., Historical Development Argyle and Cleland Bond Stores, Argyle Street, The Rocks.  Description  The original building on the site was a simple Georgian sandstone building roofed with slates, the first use of this roofing material in the colony. The numerous brick Victorian additions were made in the 19th century during various ownerships. Under the buildings solid sandstone cellars are covered by massive hand hewn timber beams whilst upper floors are in heavy timber post and beam construction. The roofs are simple hipped forms, now sheeted with corrugated iron.

He returned to Italy only in 1943 to participate in the resistance movement in his hometown Bologna. The National Liberation Committee already decided that once Bologna has been freed, Dozza would have become its Mayor. = Member of the Constituent Assembly = In the 1946 general election, Dozza is elected at the Constituent Assembly, participating in the drafting of what would later become the Italian Constitution. = Mayor of Bologna = Once elected Mayor, Dozza began immediately to instil confidence in citizens and encouraged them to participate in the reconstruction of the city. Dozza has committed himself in the autonomous battle of Bologna, demanding more decentralized powers and claiming the financial autonomy of local authorities. Dozza brought solidarity to workers in crisis and equipped the first industrial areas that were the avant-gardes of the economic boom. Dozza established the tax councils, which combined the need for self-government of Bologna with the principle of \\"progressive taxation\\" and with the principle of control of citizens in finding the economic resources. They worked at full speed with transparency and without inflicting too heavy tax burdens on the middle classes and saving the popular classes. In the early 1950s, Dozza's administration also provided a generous sum of money to the University of Bologna, gathering the consensus of the world of culture and that of the productive forces that liked Dozza's plan to fund research on the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Dozza saw the solidity of his electoral consent when he won the 1956 local elections against the Christian Democratic leader of Bologna Giuseppe Dossetti. In the last ten years of his term, Dozza concentrated on more ambitious designs, such as the ring road, the fair district and the revival of cultural life. However, in 1962 Dozza became ill and was forced to resign four years later. He died on 28 December 1974, at the age of 73, and is buried in the Certosa di Bologna monastery.

It was written by fellow Gujarati writer and critic Navalram Pandya. Kavijivan is largely based on Narmad's own private autobiographical account, Mari Hakikat, which was published posthumously in 1933. It was the first biography of Narmad in Gujarati literature. It covers Narmad's social and literary career and provides details about his public life, but avoids discussion of his private life. Background Before Navalram wrote Kavijvan, he reviewed two biographies: Karsandas Mulji Charitra (1878) and Mehtaji Durgaram Manchharamnu Charitra (1879), both written by Mahipatram Nilkanth. He stressed the importance of writing the biographies of great persons and discussed the standard practices for a biography. He believed that the biographies of great people inspire the common man to aspire to high ideals and noble acts, yet insisted that the biography not define its subject who should be presented as a 'human being' only. A biographer should be natural and realistic. Great persons described as supernatural are beyond the imagination of a common man and are worshiped only, not followed. The biography was written immediately after Narmad's death, for its inclusion in the third and enlarged edition of Narmakavita, a collection of Narmad's poems. Navalram used Narmad's autobiographical Mari Hakikat, an original account written by Narmad that had not been intended for public distribution. Navalram also used Narmad's personal notes to supplement the biography, preferring to rely on Narmad's first-hand narrative rather than his own recollections. Kavijivan was the first biography about Narmad to be published in the Gujarati language. Contents A large part of the biography is divided into three phases of Narmad's life: (1) 1850-55: period of internal struggle; (2) 1855-58: period of hectic escorts; (3) 1858-59-65, 66: period of complete glory. In the first phase, the author narrates the ambition of Narmad to be famous, his passion for women, his first unsuccessful marriage, passion for love and heroism, diligence in establishing associations for social, religious and literary deliberations. In the second phase he gives a detailed account of his efforts in self-study and attempts to display outstanding merits. In the last phase, he narrates the poet's poetic rivalry with Dalpatram, and its positive and negative effects; uninterrupted publications of his poems and the impact of his poetry on society and literature; his scholarship, evident in essays on literary, social, historical, economic and other subjects; his laying down the foundation of modern Gujarati prose by his unique style; his daring journalism in Dandiyo and his satirical and scathing articles; and his single-handed compilation of the first dictionary (Narmakosh) in Gujarati, providing the infrastructure for subsequent similar facts of his Individual as well as scholarly activities in context with the renaissance. Criticism Dhirubhai Thaker wrote: \\"It is a mature attempt to evaluate Narmad's social and literary career. Navalram's critical faculty is at its best in this monograph as he judiciously analyses the poet's mind and justifies the metamorphosis of his views on social reform.\\" Chadrakant Mehta reviewed the biography: \\"The biographer has given authentic information and analysed the factors responsible for the creative evolution of Narmad. The author has taken a broad perspective and has plunged deep into the psyche of the poet while analysing the working of the mind of Narmad\\". Ramesh Shukla criticized the biography and wrote: \\"While discussing his (Narmad's) personal life, knowing fully well about his extra-marital affairs he (Navalram) gives a clean chit to the poet, arguing, that after settling at Surat, he had never looked at any woman. Navalram defended Narmad when he took a second wife, a widow. He considered it more 'dignified' than those who carry on their affairs secretly. Narmad‚Äôs wife, Dahigauri, was mentally tortured and compelled to give her consent to this 'dignified' act. Navalram ignores this episode. Further, he also maintains silence on another event, in which, the poet gave shelter to another widow, Savitagauri, but without marrying her.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Kavijivan on Internet Archive (from Navalgranthavali Part I; ed.

Ship of Fools was published in October 2018 before the midterm elections and is a New York Times #1 best seller. Synopsis Carlson introduces his thesis by applying the allegory given in Plato's Republic, in which the US ship of state has been commandeered by an incompetent crew (the current political and economic elite ruling class) who are oblivious to the needs of, and contemptuous of the desires of, the passengers (the citizens) and intolerant of criticism. He ties this to the idea that America is ill-headed by these out-of-touch elites. Carlson does not restrict his definition of the elite to liberal members of Congress, but includes politicians of both political parties, certain neoconservative pundits, and modern entrepreneurs such as the CEOs of Facebook and Amazon, who he blames for decimating the American middle class and thus widening the gap between rich and poor, and generally betraying the liberal values they profess. While Carlson considers the Presidential election of Donald Trump to be a historical aberration, he does not count Trump among the \\"ship of fools\\" and explains his election as the passengers' desperate attempt to send a message to the mutineers. =Cover= The book's cover shows caricatures of Democratic politicians Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi, and Hillary Clinton; Republican politicians Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham; political analyst Bill Kristol; and tech moguls Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg.

It was built from 1913 to 1914. It is also known as Cleland Bond Store (part of Argyle Stores) and Cleland Store. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The land where the later Cleland Bond and Argyle Stores would stand became part of the garden for the first hospital, set up in 1788. In 1800 the land where the future Cleland Bond store would stand was leased to William Balmain, assistant surgeon to New South Wales from the First Fleet. After Balmain's death in 1803 the lease was granted to William Gaudry in January 1810. Gaudry arrived as a free settler in 1807 and became Henry Kable's son- in-law and partner in some of Kable's business enterprises. In 1838, site was listed as Lot 2, Section 85 and granted to William Carr and George Rogers solicitors, as trustees for James Shepherd, Richard Wood, Nathaniel Dermot, James Webber and Edmund Pontifex, assignees of estate of John Plummer and William Wilson, formerly merchants of Fenchurch Street, London. William Carr was one of the first members of the Sydney District Council when it formed in 1843. In 1874 Patrick Freehill erected stables on the site. On November 1877 stables were demolished and a 12 foot wide roadway was dedicated for a Public Thoroughfare along the southern boundary of the allotment, and the remaining portion of the allotment was considered for Public Auction. The land remained unoccupied until 1891 when Allen & Co. owned the land and in 1897, D Wheeler made use of the vacant land. In December 1900 the Observatory Hill Resumption Act was gazetted and the store passed into Government ownership. During or shortly after 1905 Dingle & Co. Ltd Bonded and Free Store became the tenant. In 1912 Dingle & Co. applied for a lease of the vacant land to the north of the stores. In 1914 a new warehouse of four floors, brick walls and iron roof was built there for them. This store which was erected over the previously dedicated thoroughfare extended from the Argyle Bond to the terrace house at 31 Playfair Street. This subsequently became known as the Cleland Bond. In 1933 Dingle and Co. went into liquidation. Thomas McMahon took over the lease and remained as an exclusive lessee until the function of the building began to change in the 1960s.Orwell & Peter Phillips, 1990: Appendix A: Thorp, W., Historical Development Argyle and Cleland Bond Stores, Argyle Street, The Rocks. During Clelands' ownership, few renovations or improvements were made to the building, with the exception of some limewashing, the installation of electric lights and power points in 1935 and a stacking machine in 1951, and apparently constant repairs and renovations to the electric goods lifts. In November 1946, the Argyle Stores and the Cleland Bond Store jointly suffered \\"the biggest bond store robbery for years\\". A variety of goods were stolen from Argyle Stores, while Cleland Bond Store was robbed of 400 torch globes. Clelands retained the lease on the building until 1965, when it was transferred to Brambles Bonded and Free Stores, a company with which Cleland had merged. In 1969 Brambles requested approval to sub-let the two top floors to John Anderson and Associates, and Jarvis Coates Furniture. In 1970 their tenancy expired and the building was vacated. The establishment of the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority (SCRA) in 1968 ushered in a new period of planning and development in The Rocks. Initially, the SCRA intended to redevelop the area with high-rise residential and office buildings, and to retain only a handful of historic buildings. However, by the early 1970s, a growing public awareness of the cultural value of historic places and a series of highly visible protests against the Government's proposed scheme forced a shift in the SCRA's approach, towards adaptive reuse, rather than demolition and replacement, of old buildings. This, in combination with the SCRA's imperative to turn The Rocks into a tourist destination, saw a number of old warehouses converted to accommodate specialty shops and restaurants. In 1971 the SCRA invited proposals from interested parties for the conservation and conversion of the Cleland Bond Store and the adjoining row of terrace houses, subsequently named the Argyle Terrace (distinguished from the Playfair Street Terraces), for use as commercial premises. The successful proposal came from architects Fisher, Jackson and Hudson, and was to be one of the first conservation jobs undertaken by the SCRA. Builders Peter Kilmore and Co were engaged for the work, which began in December 1971 and was completed in February 1973. Work included removing existing partitions and replacing sanitary fittings; removing a hoist from the northeast corner of the building and infilling the resultant hole; constructing new stairs from the ground to the third floor, as well as new external stairs; removing existing roller shutters from the Playfair Street entrance and replacing them with heavy Oregon doors; and installing new gutters, downpipes and roofing. Additional work was undertaken between 1975 and 1980, including the construction of ramps between the north wing of the Argyle Stores and the Cleland Bond Store, and the installation of a new timber floor and skirtings to the ground and first floors of the building. A concrete entry ramp from Playfair Street was built and a new entrance was cut from the Cleland Bond Store to the east wing of the Argyle Stores. In the 1990s the building was renovated for use as a department store. Existing shop partitions were removed and masonry walls and the timber structure of the building were exposed to display something of the building's original construction. New stairs and a lift were installed, and the ground floor level was given a new floor once again. The Cleland Bond Store was again refurbished in 2006-7 as part of the upgrading works to the Argyle Stores. These works were awarded \\"Excellence in Construction of Adaptive Re-Use of a Historic Building up to $5 Million\\" at the 2007 NSW Master Builders Awards.  Description  The Cleland Stores are four storeys high and four bays wide, of load bearing brickwork with heavy timber post and beam construction internally. It has a simple pitched iron roof with a gable parapet incorporating a large circular opening on the main fa√ßade. The top windows have broad semi-circular heads. Entry to the bond is through a pair of massive ledged and braced doors in the central, recessed double entry bay.Croker, 1976. = Condition = As at 15 April 2000, the building is in fair condition; there are some moisture problems on the external walls.Wyborn, P., 1999.

The existing fitout was removed to create open floor space to all levels. The Centre was reopened in November 1995. Additional air conditioning was provided to the buildings in 1996-7.SCRA, Annual Reports, 1995-1996/7. *1996Limited archaeological excavation in subfloor, however the majority of the subfloor remains undisturbed and a potential archaeological resource. *2007The Cleland Bond Store was refurbished and the works won an excellence award at the 2007 NSW Master Builders Awards.  Heritage listing  As at 30 March 2011, Cleland Bond Store and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The Cleland Bond Store is part of the larger Argyle Stores which include substantial remains of one the earliest surviving commercial buildings in Sydney, dating from . The Argyle Stores also contain the earliest surviving building occupied for use as a Customs House from 1830 until 1850. The group of buildings is probably unique in Sydney in its ability to demonstrate changing warehouse design and construction from the early 19th to the early 20th century. Despite numerous alterations, the buildings retain much of the fabric of their major phases of development and use as commercial stores. The buildings also demonstrate, through design, space and materials, retail practices which are changing or have changed. The Argyle Stores group of buildings and site are physical reminders of the early history of Sydney, occupying a section of the city which was the focus of commercial maritime activity in the first half of the 19th century. They also provide the focus of present activity in The Rocks. The courtyard is particularly evocative in this respect. The buildings have historical associations with significant figures in Australian retail and social history including John Piper, Mary Reiby, Frederick Unwin, Samuel Terry and the Tooth brothers. Unwin is also significant in the development of The Rocks area. The Argyle Centre historic precinct makes an important contribution to the quality of the streetscape of The Rocks. The building fabric constitutes the major potential source of additional information about the history of the complex, because of the paucity of documentary evidence. These buildings are believed to be among the first historic buildings in NSW to be recycled for new uses in a way designed to respect the earlier historical significance of the site, and therefore represent and important landmark in the history of conservation. The buildings provide clear evidence of early conservation practice and philosophy. Cleland Bond Store was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Cleland Bond Store and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right (see item no. 4500458). The Cleland Bond Store has historical significance as the last component built as part of the Argyle Stores, a complex that includes substantial remains of one of Sydney's earliest surviving commercial buildings (built ) and the earliest surviving Customs House building (occupied as such from 1830‚Äì50). The Argyle Stores group, including the Cleland Bond Store, constitutes important material evidence of changing warehouse design and construction in Sydney from the early 19th to the early 20th century. The Cleland Bond Store, in conjunction with the Argyle Stores, is a physical reminder of the commercial maritime history of The Rocks, which was the centre of maritime activity and trade in Sydney from the earliest days of European settlement. As one of the later bond store buildings built in The Rocks and occupied for the purpose of bonded storage for some 60 years, the Cleland Bond Store represents the continuing importance of maritime commerce in The Rocks area throughout the 20th century. The building is also historically significant as one of the first historic buildings in NSW to be conserved and adapted for commercial retail and office use by the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority, newly constituted in the early 1970s. As such, the Cleland Bond Store is a material record of early conservation practice and philosophy in New South Wales. The Cleland Bond Store meets this criterion on a State and local level.Clive Lucas, Stapleton & Partners Pty Ltd, 2008 The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The buildings have historical associations with significant figures in Australian retail and social history including John Piper, Mary Reiby, Frederick Unwin, Samuel Terry and the Tooth brothers. Unwin is also significant in the development of the Rocks area. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Cleland Bond Store is a substantial and well-built example of an Edwardian warehouse. As part of the historic Argyle Precinct, and as one of the primary \\"background\\" buildings in the precinct, the intact external shell of the Cleland Bond Store makes an important contribution to the streetscape quality of the Rocks. The Cleland Bond Store meets this criterion on a State and local level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Cleland Bond Store, as part of the Argyle Stores group, has social significance for its place in the history of the Argyle Stores, an important warehousing complex in The Rocks, and for its contribution to The Rocks area, one of Australia's premier heritage precincts. This is demonstrated by its inclusion on several lists of buildings of heritage significance formulated by community groups such as the National Trust of Australia (NSW) and the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, and representative bodies such as the Heritage Council of NSW. As part of The Rocks area, the place is likely to be held in some esteem by individuals and groups who are interested in Sydney's history and heritage. The Cleland Bond Store, as part of The Rocks precinct, meets this criterion on a State and local level. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Argyle Centre historic precinct makes an important contribution to the quality of the streetscape of the Rocks. The building fabric constitutes the major potential source of additional information about the history of the complex, because of the paucity of documentary evidence. These buildings are believed to be among the first historic buildings in NSW to be recycled for new uses in a way designed to respect the earlier historical significance of the site, and therefore represent and important landmark in the history of conservation. The buildings provide clear evidence of early conservation practice and philosophy. Archaeology: Partly disturbed. Limited excavation carried out on in 1996. Subfloor excavation was necessary for the installation of power, water, sewerage and drainage services and also for the construction of a lift well. During this excavation the remains of a box drain () were encountered. The majority of the subfloor area remains undisturbed and a potential archaeological resource. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Cleland Bond Store, as a component of the Argyle Stores, is rare in its ability to contribute to an understanding of changing warehouse design and construction from the early 19th to early 20th century. Warehouse complexes of this longevity are rare in Sydney. The Cleland Bond Store meets this criterion on a local level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Cleland Bond Store is a representative example of an early 20th century warehouse. The Cleland Bond Store meets this criterion on a local level.

In 1958, in accordance with revised legislation, she was chosen to serve as a pastor in L√ºbeck. On Easter Sunday 1959, she was ceremoniously appointed to head the city's Evangelical Women's Association, becoming the first woman in Germany to hold the title of pastor. She maintained the position until she died in an accident in 1974. Biography Born on 30 June 1914 in Rome, Elisabeth Haseloff was the daughter of Arthur Haseloff (1872‚Äì1955), an art historian. She was brought up in a cultural environment in Kiel, meeting numerous figures associated with art and science. When she was 14, deeply moved by her confirmation, she resolved to study theology. As a result, in 1935 she embarked on her studies at the University of T√ºbingen. During the Nazi era, she became a member of the Confessing Church. After taking her first theological examination in 1939, she gained practical experience of clerical work at St Anschar's Church in Neum√ºnster. She was particularly active in caring for hospital patients but also preached on occasion, although it was against the rules. She was not supposed to do more than hold Bible classes but during the war, it was not unusual for women to deliver sermons. She took the second theology exam in 1941, becoming the first woman to do so in Schleswig- Holstein. After assisting the pastor in B√ºdelsdorf, in the absence of male pastors, in 1946 she was entrusted with responsibility for the parish. She remained in B√ºdelsdorf until 1959. In the late 1950s, there was a vacancy for a pastor in one of the parishes in L√ºbeck. Realizing that Haseloff could fill the post, the synod drafted a \\"church law for the parochial employment of a female pastor\\", the first of its kind in Germany. On Whit Sunday 1959, she was installed as the first female pastor in the Evangelical Church of Germany, a development which was widely reported in the press. She turned out to be very effective in her new position, arranging seminars on collaboration between men and women in the church, inviting women politicians, doctors, trade unionists and teachers. She was also active in arranging meetings between women in East and West Germany and in collaboration with Africa. In 1962, she invited three Tanzanian women to study in L√ºbeck as kindergarten teachers, hosting them in her own home. On 29 November 1974, Elisabeth Haseloff met with a fatal accident in Hamburg while crossing the street on a zebra crossing.

The holotype specimen was discovered in the Jiufotang Formation of Sihedang in Lingyuan, western Liaoning. In 2018, the Chinese palaeontologist Shuai Shao and colleagues named the new genus and species Jeholochelys lingyuanensis based on the specimen. The generic name consists of \\"Jehol\\", which refers to the Jehol biota, and \\"chelys\\", which is Greek for turtle. The specific name refers to the type locality. Seven skeletons were described in the study, five nearly complete, and two consisting of shells (four appear to be juveniles), and hundreds of turtle fossils have been found in the area. The described specimens are kept in the Paleontological Museum of Liaoning. Jeholochelys lived in freshwater, and was characterised by hyperphalangy, the increase in the number of phalanx bones in the digits (it had one additional phalanx bone in the fifth toe compared to what is common among living turtles). This condition is often linked to tetrapod animals with an aquatic lifestyle, where it contributes in forming long flippers in for example modern whales, as well as in the extinct ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs. Modern soft-shelled turtles also exhibit hyperphalangy, but though this does not result in long flippers, it may help enlarge the paddle surface and aid aquatic movement. Other aquatic and marine turtles instead have elongated limbs and phalanges, and land turtles have short limbs and feet. Jeholochelys was found to be related to coexisting sinemydid turtles, most closely to Xiaochelys and Changmachelys, and like other Cretaceous relatives, it had a low-domed shell. Jeholochelys fossils are considered evidence that hyperphalangy evolved multiple times among turtles; other coexisting sinemydids did not have an additional phalanx bone. The proportions of the forelimb in Jeholochelys was similar to that in soft- shelled turtles, and it may have been adapted for aquatic habits to a similar degree.

It was designed and built by John Turnbull Esq. during 1924. It is also known as The Rocks Centre and Playfair's Garage (Playfairs). The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The site of Playfair's Garage and Scarborough Houses was part of the first hospital site, although it does not appear to have been developed until the 1840s. In 1816 it was subdivided into three allotments. In 1841 all three allotments were acquired by Frederic Unwin, who subdivided the land with frontage to George Street and created Kendall Lane and New George Street (now Playfair). In 1842 Unwin was experiencing financial difficulties and the southern allotments, now the site of Playfair's Garage, were sold to James Chapman and William Perry. In 1844 Unwin erected three stone stores four storeys high at the northern end of the site. In 1852 Unwin was declared bankrupt, and sold his properties. The stores were acquired by William Nicholson, and in 1858 were leased to Berkelman & Bate who operated the building as a steam flour mill until c.1860. In 1861 it was acquired by Lawrence Kendall who converted the building into what has since been known as 'Kendall's Biscuit Factory'. Between 1871-75 the land fronting Argyle and Playfair Streets was developed by Henry Bell and William Billyard respectively. Bell constructed Argyle Terraces on the site of Playfair's Garage. Billyard constructed more on Playfair Street. Small sheds, blacksmiths' shops and outbuildings were built on the remnant of the site. In 1889 Kendall & Sons, biscuit manufacturers, are recorded as occupying No. 24, adjoining the factory. In 1900 the land was resumed under the Observatory Hill Act. By 1925 a two storey building had been erected on the site, described as a factory, and owned by John Turnbull. Between 1925-49 it continued to be listed as a factory or workshop. It was called 'Playfair's Garage'. In 1970 control of the land was vested in the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority and in 1978 the Authority began an extensive redevelopment project on the site. Turnbull's 1925 building was renamed Penrhyn House, but the name never caught on. The buildings north of Playfair's Garage were demolished. A new building was erected in 1978-79, named \\"Scarborough House\\".SCRA 1978: KL/15 In 2005 the building was completely refurbished and The Rocks Visitor Centre moved into the top floor.  Description  Built as ground floor of factory for John Turnbull Esq. The building was two storey, with brick walls and clerestory iron roof. It originally had offices at Argyle Street end, lavatories at each end, and vehicular access from Kendall Lane. Alterations were made in 1952 (additional vehicular access) and 1972 (to create corner shop and offices).Orwell & Peter Phillips 1991: Appendix A.

He was the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Lincoln Center and the Golden Melody Award for Lifetime Contributions. Before becoming a comedian, he ran a food stall in Taipei where he created and popularized the dish Mongolian barbecue.  Creation of Mongolian barbecue  Wu created the popular dish Mongolian barbecue before he became a comedian. Wu was born in Beijing, Republic of China, on 14 January 1926. He graduated from the with a degree in economics. He fled to Taiwan when the Communist Party took over mainland China, and opened a street food stall in , Taipei in 1951, where he created the popular dish Mongolian barbecue. He originally wanted to call the dish \\"Beijing barbecue\\", but because of political sensitivity with the city, which had just recently been designated as the capital of Communist China, he settled with \\"Mongolian barbecue\\" instead, even though it had no direct connection with Mongolia. Wu's food stall became very popular, and even attracted foreign diplomats and wealthy businesspeople as customers despite being a cheap eatery. However, it was later destroyed by flooding during a typhoon, in which Wu nearly drowned. When he exited the restaurant business to develop his xiangsheng career, numerous imitators emerged to capitalize on the popularity of the dish he created, which was later also introduced to the West.  Xiangsheng career  Wu began performing xiangsheng in 1951 and later exited the restaurant business as his popularity grew. Performing on radio and on stage, he became one of the most famous xiangsheng actors in Taiwan. He frequently partnered with , and their radio show became an iconic memory in Taiwan. Wu moved to the United States in 1973, where he continued to perform xiangsheng as well as Peking opera. He also developed a brand of beef jerky. In 1983, the xiangsheng master Hou Baolin took him as a disciple, inducting him into the formal lineage of the art. Wu trained many students of his own, notably , Lang Tzu-yun, , , and Fan Kuang-yao. Lang Tzu-yun founded the performing arts troupe Spring Sun, for which Wu has written. Wu received many awards including the Lifetime Artistic Achievement Award from the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City, the Xinchuan Award () of Taiwan and the Outstanding Artist of Asia Award. In 2009, Wu was given the Golden Melody Award for lifetime contributions, which was followed by an honor bestowed at the first Taipei City Master of Traditional Arts Awards ceremony in 2010.

It was built from 1875 to 1877. It is also known as Tara Terrace (Nos 19-27) and Argyle Terrace. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The subject land appears to have been largely undeveloped until the 1870s. The street now known as \\"Playfair Street\\" was not shown on a plan of the area dated 1868. Since the mid 1870s the street has been known by a number of names: * New George St, - 1876; * Little Gloucester Street, - 1886; * Harrington Street, 1923-1953; and * Playfair Street, since 1953. The 1868 plan shows a laneway cuts through the south eastern portion of the block, accessing the properties fronting George St and a large building connected to Flour mills located opposite the site. The Argyle Stores occupy the south western section of the block. The land on the western side of Playfair Street was part of Lot 2 of Section 85 granted to William Carr and John Rogers on 26 October 1838. This land included the southern portion of the site, land now occupied by Nos. 21-31 Playfair Street. In 1839 the land granted to Carr and Rogers was sold to Frederick Wright Unwin. Unwin commenced his Bonded Stores in the same year. In 1842 Unwin leased the northern section of his property and continued to develop the southern portion of his site. In 1870 part of Unwin's land was acquired by William Whaley Billyard who by the end of 1871 consolidated this with a grant made on 26 September 1871. This land was sold two years later to Robert Pemberton Richardson of Sydney, an auctioneer. A Certificate of Title dated December 187431, shows the land, including the subject sites, extending east from Gloucester Street with small frontage to George St North. Richardson had by this time subdivided the land, part of DP 143 and offered the thirty one allotments for sale at auction on 11 December 1874. The lots were advertised as Freehold City Allotments about Little Gloucester Street and Mill Street. The plan shows the irregularly shaped allotments on the western side of Little Gloucester Street, generally with frontages. The two end allotments, Lots 21 and 31 being a little wider. Lots 4 to 31 were advertised as being suitable as sites \\"for residences for small capitalists\\". The sale of the subject sites were recorded on the Certificate of Title as follows: *Lot 21 (Nos. 29-31 Playfair Street) John Nicholson of Sydney, 6 January 1875 *Lots 22 & 23 (Nos. 25-27 Playfair Street) Bartholomew Higgins of Sydney, policeman, 6 January 1875 *Lot 24 (No. 23 Playfair Street) John Kearney of Sydney, policeman, 6 January 1875 *Lots 25 & 26 (Nos. 19-21 Playfair Street) John Murphy of Sydney, publican, 18 January 1875 *Lot 27 (No. 17 Playfair Street) John Murphy of Sydney, publican, 15 September 1876 *Lot 28 (Part Nos.13-15 Playfair Street) William George of Sydney, labourer, 2 April 1875 *Lot 29 (Part Nos.13-15 Playfair Street) Magnus George of Sydney, 14 October 1876 Most of these purchasers retained ownership until 1901, when the land was resumed. However, in 1876, Nicholson sold approximately half of Lot 21 (facing Little Gloucester St) to Enoch Rees, a stonemason of Sydney. Two years later it was again transferred to Michael O'Flaherty, a coal merchant of Pyrmont. Nicholson retained the western portion of the original allotment until 1898. Lots 28-31 were purchased by Thomas Playfair and by 1879, only these lots remained undeveloped. New George Street (now Playfair Street) was first listed in the Sands Directory in 1873. In 1875 no residents were listed, however, in the following year a terrace of five houses, probably on Lots 22-26 (Nos. 19-27) had been built and occupied. A sewer plan dated 28th Aug 1875 indicates five buildings on the site, in the area between the Argyle Bond to the south and Mill to the east. In 1876 it would appear that Enoch Rees built a pair of two storey houses, Nos. 29 and 31, after his purchase of the eastern half of the allotment from Nicholson. In 1877 the Sands Directory notes No. 7 Little Gloucester Street (now No. 17 Playfair Street) was \\"in course of erection\\". It would appear that the single house on Lot 27 (No. 17 Playfair Street) was constructed by John Murphy shortly after his purchase of that block in late 1876. By 1882 a total of 19 houses had been constructed on Lots 21 to 27, with eight fronting Little Gloucester Street, eight to Gloucester Walk and three in between. The largest developer was John Murphy who erected nine houses on his three allotments, by using the rear yards of Nos. 17-21 Playfair Street. It seems unlikely that the three separate purchasers of the land now occupied by Nos. 19-27 Playfair Street would have combined to construct the row. It is possible that the terrace was constructed by a speculative venture prior to their purchase, however, the sale of land by Richardson made no reference to buildings on the property. In the row was noted as \\"Tara Terrace\\", however, the derivation of the name and connection is not clear. The Percy Dove plan shows the configuration of the buildings. The two storey buildings facing Little Gloucester Street, including Nos. 9-17 (now Nos. 19-27) noted as \\"Tara Terrace\\", are constructed to the street alignment with single storey room/annexes and open yards to the rear. The three single storey buildings are shown at the rear of Nos. 17-21 (noted as Nos. 7-11 on the plan). The buildings constructed on the Gloucester Street frontage, now interpreted in Foundation Park are also shown. The allotment to the north of these buildings, now Nos. 13-15 Playfair Street, remained undeveloped. Two sheds are shown abutting the single storey building at the rear of No. 17 and on the north eastern boundary. By 1880 Murphy had also constructed another house immediately behind No. 7 Little Gloucester Street (No. 17 Playfair Street), accessed via a passage, the opening of which is still discernable at the southern end of the ground floor facade of the building. In 1880 the Sydney City Council Assessment Books described the individual houses on Little Gloucester Street (now Playfair Street) as follows: *No. 7 (Lot 27, No. 17 Playfair Street) Brick walls, Shingled roof, 3 floors 6 rooms *1 off (Lot 27) Brick walls, Shingled roof, 2 floors 4 rooms *No. 9 (Lot 26, No. 19) Brick walls, Shingled roof, 2 floors 4 rooms *No. 11 (Lot 25, No. 21 Playfair Street) Brick walls, Shingled roof, 2 floors 4 rooms *No. 13 (Lot 24, No. 23 Playfair Street) Brick walls, Shingled roof, 3 floors 5 room *No. 15 (Lot 23, No. 25 Playfair Street) Brick walls, Shingled roof, 3 floors 6 rooms *No. 17 (Lot 22, No. 27 Playfair Street) Brick walls, Shingled roof, 3 floors 6 rooms *No. 19 (part Lot 21, No. 29 Playfair Street) Brick walls, Shingled roof, 2 floors 5 rooms *No. 21 (part Lot 21, No. 31 Playfair Street) Brick walls, Shingled roof, 2 floors 5 rooms In 1883 Thomas Playfair commenced construction of two tenements known as Nos. 3-5 Gloucester Street (Nos. 13-15 Playfair Street). The building was first rated in June 1884 and in 1891, Nos. 3-5 Playfair Street (Nos. 13-15) were described as two storey houses of five rooms constructed with brick and cement walls and iron roof. No. 1 Playfair Street occupied by Thomas Playfair was described as wood walls and iron roof with sheds and yards. The sequence of construction of the subject buildings, based on Sands and title search can therefore be summarised as follows: *?? Nos. 19 - 27\\"Tara Terrace\\" 1875; *?? Nos. 29 - 311876; *?? No. 171877. The five houses comprising \\"Tara Terrace\\", the first buildings built on the site, were constructed as typical Victorian workers' terraces. Each terrace was built on sandstone foundation walls with two rooms at both ground and first floor levels. Nos. 29 and 31 were constructed as a pair with similar style and finish to Tara Terrace, No. 17 was originally very similar to the Tara Terrace dwellings in style and detail. The Sands Directory indicates that at least three of the houses at the western end of the original allotments, along the Gloucester Street alignment, had been constructed and occupied by 1877. By 1879 seven houses had been built, described as Erin Terrace. These were also occupied by a number of tradesmen, including mariners, carpenter and tailor. By 1882 the street numbers had changed to accommodate another three houses, and the Assessment Books note that all were constructed of brick with iron roofs. All but two were three storeys with five or six rooms (the other two were single storey with three rooms). The houses generally appear to have been developed for the rental market. From the start only one of the properties, No. 13 Little Gloucester Street (No. 23 Playfair Street) was occupied by the owner, John Kearney. By 1879 all of the houses were occupied by tenants who generally remained in occupation for a few years at the most. The Sands Directory indicates that these tenants were varied, ranging from a printer to shipwrights and an engineer. The terraces constructed along the Gloucester Street alignment (now Gloucester Walk) were also generally constructed for the rental market with only two owner occupiers. In 1879 the occupants included two master mariners, a carpenter and a tailor. The Sands Directory indicates that this situation continued until 1901, when all of the allotments were resumed by the Minister for Public Works and the Sydney Harbour Trust became responsible for the site and buildings. The initial aim of the Trust, which was established as a result of the bubonic plague which hit Sydney in early 1900, was to clean up the resumed areas and redevelop them for commercial use. However, the area within the boundaries of the resumption included many residential properties mixed with the wharves and commercial buildings that the Trust intended to use. The Trust gradually had to accept that it would have to take the role of landlord and manage the newly acquired residential properties and their occupants. The Trust also soon recognised that not all of the newly acquired property was suitable for commercial purposes and the local topography, steep and rocky in places, would potentially be difficult to develop. In addition, the traditional inhabitants of The Rocks area, such as the wharf labourers, continued to need to live in vicinity to their places of employment. Much of the housing in the area had become dilapidated by this time and demolitions and cleansing operations were undertaken by the Trust, however, repairs to the buildings that were retained, it is assumed such as the subject terraces in Playfair Street, and construction of new housing, on land deemed unsuitable for commercial use, was also undertaken from this time. The building came under the control of the Maritime Services Board (MSB) in 1936. The MSB made major infrastructure changes in The Rocks area, however, it would appear made little changes to the buildings. Despite the changes in the administration much of the area and fabric remained intact until the late 1960s. Much of the city had by this time been taken over for commercial purposes and resident population subsequently thinned. The Rocks became more derelict and public opinion generally regarded the place as a slum and largely favoured demolition and redevelopment. Two of the four terraces still tenanted by the mid 1970s were occupied by residents who had lived in the street for several decades, during which it appears that very little renovation or modification had taken place. The buildings were transferred to the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority in 1970 and with the adjoining terraces at No. 13-15 Playfair Street, were originally slated for demolition. Tenders were called and a number of proposals were considered, including the use of a site for a carpark. The decision to demolish the buildings is highlighted by the one Tenancy Card relating to the buildings. The card relates to No. 31 Playfair St, at this time tenanted by a Mr W. Balmain and his mother Mrs Beashel. The entries date from 22 July 1970, at which time the memo notes, \\"proposed Playfair Street demolitions Houses Nos. 13 to 31\\". A subsequent note, dated 28 July 1970 notes, \\"Playfair St proposed demolition of ten houses 13-31 inclusive for carpark\\". In the later months of 1970 memos and letters were sent pertaining to the relocation of the present tenants and subsequently notice to quit the premises. The last entry, dated 13 August 1971 alludes to the continuing \\"problem\\" with the existing tenant. Other file notes dated September - November 1970 suggest the imminent demolition of the terrace in Playfair Street and relocation of the present tenants. The note dated September 1970 lists the houses and tenants involved and current rental as that time as follows: *No. 13Mr T. Kane three adults, four children $3.60 rental per week *No. 15vacant *No. 17vacant *No. 19vacant *No. 21vacant *No. 23vacant *No. 25Mrs N. Macklan plus two children $4.30 rental per week *No. 27Mrs C. E. Moran only occupant $3.45 rental per week *No. 29vacant *No. 31Mr W. Balmain - non-resident, occupied by his mother only. $3.30 per week. Three of the four tenants were to be accommodated in the East Rocks area. Mr Kane was to be relocated to No. 50A Gloucester Street, Mrs Macklan to No. 46 Gloucester Street and Mrs Moran to No. 63 Harrington Street. Each of these apparently expressed satisfaction with their new addresses. Mrs Balmain, was to live with her son at Chester Hill, however, the report outlines her unwillingness to leave. However, by November 1970, two of the tenants had been relocated and the others followed shortly thereafter in 1971. It was an overseas visit by the SCRA's then Business Manager and Director that brought about a reversal and change of plan. The Director was impressed by the aesthetic and financial returns of refurbishing old and seemingly derelict buildings and on his return called for a reassessment of the situation. It was decided that the terrace would be retained and from this time the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority adapted the remaining houses as commercial premises and developed the rear of the site as Foundation Park. This marked the beginning of the Authority's role in the development of The Rocks as a tourist destination. At the end of the 1970s the character of the area and use and occupation of the buildings was redefined by the refurbishment.Perumal Murphy Alessi Pty Ltd, Heritage Consultants 2006  Description  The row of terrace houses, Nos 13-31 Playfair Street, and renamed Argyle Terrace by the SCA around 1990, were built between 1875 and 1883, as follows: * Nos 19-27 Playfair Street (Tara Terrace)1875 * Nos 29-31 Playfair Street1876 * No. 17 Playfair Street1877 * Nos 13-15 Playfair Street1883. The terraces at 17-31 Playfair Street were adapted as commercial premises by the SCRA in 1972. All of the houses were built of face brick with no extraneous detailing. To maximise the use of the site the houses were built directly onto the street alignment with cantilevered balconies overhanging a narrow footpath. Each terrace features a simple two-up, two-down floor plan with attic rooms to Nos 17-27. Nos. 29 & 31 were built with fireplaces to the ground floor rooms only, while the remainder had an additional fireplace in the front, first floor room. The majority of these are still intact. The internal detailing is generally devoid of decoration and as such is typical of this type of working class housing.Green 1988: 29 The last of the terraces to be built are Nos 13-15 Playfair Street, and are slightly more elaborate in style. = Condition = As at 3 May 2001 the archaeological assessment condition was partly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Floors above or level with street. Sandstone quarried up to Gloucester Street frontage. = Modifications and dates = *Built1875 (Nos.19-27); 1876 (No. 29-31) & 1877 (No.17). *By 189117 and 19 Playfair Street were re-roofed with iron. *By 1902all of the shingled roofs were replaced. *1972The first restoration/revitalisation project undertaken by SCRA included the Cleland Bond Store, 17-37 Playfair Street and the former site of 2-16 Gloucester Street. By this time the row of eleven houses facing Playfair Street was in a dilapidated condition and they were originally scheduled for demolition. However, it was subsequently decided to adapt them as a mixture of shops and restaurants as an extension of the Argyle Arts Centre.  Heritage listing  As at 27 October 2008, the Playfair Street Terraces, Nos. 17-31 and site are of State significance for their historical and scientific values. The site and buildings are of State significance for their contribution to the character and qualities of the precinct and are significant for their contribution to The Rocks, which is of State Heritage Significance in its own right. The Terraces at Nos. 17-31 Playfair Street are good examples of the typical workers' housing and terrace style of residential development and subdivision pattern that occurred in the mid to late Victorian period in Sydney. Largely constructed for the rental market, the buildings indicate the provision of minimal space to maximise profit. With Nos. 13-15 Playfair Street, the buildings demonstrate the changes in architectural style during the 1870s and 1880s with the simple and undecorated style of the terraces of Nos. 17-31 in contrast to the slightly more decorated Nos. 13-15. Despite the demolition of the rear wings and some internal walls and features the terraces retain a sense of their original two room configuration on each floor, original spatial qualities and simplicity of the interior and lack of decoration and use of attic spaces accessed via tight stairs. The subject grouping is one of the only grouping of workers' terraces with cantilevered balconies remaining in The Rocks area, although similar examples remain in Millers Point and other inner city suburbs such as Paddington and Surry Hills. With the Atherden Street Terraces these form an important reminder of the predominantly residential character of the immediate area. Playfair Street Terraces was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Terraces at Nos. 17-31 Playfair Street are historically significant as representative examples of mid to late Victorian terrace worker's style residential development that was constructed during this period, particularly in areas such as The Rocks where residences in vicinity to places of employment were in demand. Together with the Atherden Street terraces and remnants in Foundation Park, they demonstrate the subdivision pattern that occurred in the period between 1870 and mid 1880s. The terraces are representative of simple, low quality, high density speculative developments which were built during the mid to late Victorian period by developers keen to maximise profits. The site of the terrace, which extends back to the rock face to the west, and adjacent Foundation Park is significant as it emphasises the difficulties faced when developing in The Rocks precinct due to the topography of the area. The buildings are part of group that were the first restoration and revitalisation works undertaken by the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority, commencing in 1972. The project represented a shift in both the philosophy of the organisation and general approach and understanding of the history and development of the area. The resultant changes to the buildings and area are significant as they represent a shift away from the predominantly residential use of the immediate vicinity to commercial and public use of the area. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Terraces at Nos. 17-31 Playfair Street are associated with a number of government bodies who administered and later undertook major works to the buildings. These include the Sydney Harbour Trust, Maritime Services Board, Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority and Sydney Cove Authority. Nos. 17-31 are associated with several local businessman and land speculators who subdivided and developed the sites. The Terraces are associated with Thomas Playfair, a local butcher who became Lord Mayor of Sydney and an MP. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Terraces at Nos. 17-31 Playfair Street are relatively intact examples of worker's terraces constructed in the second half of the 19th century that retain their fundamental form and character. Despite the demolition of the rear wings and some internal walls and features the terraces retain a sense of their original two room configuration on each floor, original spatial qualities and simplicity of the interior and lack of decoration and use of attic spaces accessed via narrow stairs. Together with Nos. 13-15 they demonstrate the changes in architectural style during this period with the simple and undecorated style of the terraces constructed during the 1870s (Nos. 17-31) in contrast to the slightly more decorated Nos. 13-15 which were constructed in the 1880s and feature Italianate decoration popular at this time. The terraces are prominent elements in the Playfair streetscape primarily due to their smaller scale and are an integral part of a diverse residential/ commercial character of the place. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Terraces at Nos. 17-31 are associated with a number of tenants, residential and more recently commercial occupants of no particular note. The buildings were part of a development that became a slum that was, after some intervention, improved and revitalised so that the buildings could continue to be part of the social and economic life of The Rocks and Sydney in general. The buildings have some association with the work of local community groups and green bans in that they mark a change of philosophy and regard for the existing built environment in The Rocks and contributed to the decision to retain and restore the buildings. The works undertaken in the 1970s became what was the first restoration project undertaken by the SCRA. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Terraces at Nos. 17-31, despite some adaptive works, retain their fundamental form and character and many features of typical workers' terraces erected in Sydney during the mid to late Victorian period. However, the division of storeys, particularly Nos. 19, 29 and 31, confuses the interpretation of the buildings and their original form as individual dwellings. With the adjoined terraces at Nos. 13-15, the grouping also demonstrates the changes of style in low scale residential accommodation between the 1870s and 1880s. The buildings and site have scientific and research potential because of the archaeological resources that may remain below the floor and backyard areas that may demonstrate the living conditions and construction techniques of modest dwellings in the late 19th century. Foundation Park to the immediate west of the buildings contain items and elements of archaeological significance that demonstrate the living conditions and construction techniques of the late 19th century. Their location and current use make them easily accessible to the public and contributes to their understanding. The connecting stair, walkway and platforms also assist the appreciation of the buildings and site elements. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. There are a number of terraces constructed in the mid to late 19th century remaining in The Rocks area, however, the subject grouping is one of the only grouping of workers' terraces with cantilevered balconies remaining in The Rocks area. Similar examples, however, remain in Millers Point and other inner city suburbs such as Paddington and Surry Hills. The Terraces with No. 13-15 Playfair Street are the only \\"residential\\" scaled buildings now remaining in Playfair Street which is now characterised by larger commercial buildings. With the Atherden Street Terraces these form an important reminder of the predominantly residential character of the immediate area. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Whilst the rear of the buildings have been altered and buildings are now used for commercial purposes the Terraces are good representative examples of late 19th century workers' and speculatively built dwellings that retain their fundamental residential form and character and relationship to the street.

Family Protheroe was the son of Edward Protheroe, MP and Anne Waterhouse, daughter of John Waterhouse. In 1817, he was admitted to Christ Church, Oxford. In 1845, in accordance with the will of Dame Mary Hill, widow of Mark Davis of Turnwood, from whom he had inherited \\"considerable property\\" he adopted the additional surname of Davis. Before his death in 1852, he never married and spent the last three years of his life \\"paralysed\\". He left small annuities to his friends, but the majority of his estate transferred to his elderly father. Parliamentary career=Evesham= Protheroe was first elected Whig Member of Parliament for the two-member Evesham constituency at the 1826 general election. During the contest against a \\"token\\" group of independents, he was accused of trying to \\"forge\\" an \\"unnatural coalition\\" with the sitting Tory, Sir Charles Cockerell, 1st Baronet. He was returned to the seat, ending the poll in second place out of three candidates. During this period, Protheroe was a supporter of a range of issues, including Catholic emancipation, the spring guns bill, the Coventry magistracy bill, and the disenfranchisement of the disenfranchisement of Penryn, and acted as a majority teller for the Coventry magistracy bill, all in 1827. He also, in 1828, voted against extending the franchise of East Retford to include Bassetlaw, and supported reducing corn duties. He voted against the appointment of a registrar to the Archbishop of Canterbury, for the usury laws amendment bill and the corporate funds bill in 1828. He was in favour of an amendment to the friendly societies bill which banned \\"compulsory payments for entertainment\\" at meeting, and then endorse the anatomy bill. Protheroe also supported allowing Daniel O'Connell to take his seat at Clare without taking the Oath of Supremacy. He also supported Lord Blandford's parliamentary reform scheme in 1829, and proposed an amendment on the \\"need to alleviate distress\\"‚Äîstating \\"discontent from large masses\\" and the \\"growing contempt in which the House is held\\" could only be reduced by a \\"decided retrenchment of expense, large reduction of taxation, and by a needful reform, commencing with our own House\\". This amendment, however, he withdrew that day, noting this was not \\"from any doubt of the truth\\" but to ensure \\"the most expedient course\\", later voting for a similar amendment moved by Sir Edward Knatchbull, 9th Baronet. He voted in favour of transferring East Retford's seats to Birmingham, and for the creation of constituencies for Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. Protheroe also presented a number of petitions to the House of Commons, including in favour of Catholic relief and emancipation; the repeal of the Test Acts; against the relocation of Smithfield cattle market, plans for which he said were \\"absurd and ludicrous\\"; against the burning of Hindu widows on behalf of women of Alcester; to complain of distress from Stow-on-the-Wold; for Jewish emancipation; for the abolition of the death penalty for forgery; and from the Forest of Dean collieries against coal duties. He also supported several inquiries, including to probe electoral interference by Leicester corporation in 1827; obtaining detailed accounts of the work of the public records commissioners in 1828 and 1829; and to investigate chancery delays in 1828. Protheroe was also almost made a member of the finance committee in 1827, and became a member of Brooks's, sponsored by Lord Essex and Lord Duncannon in 1828. In the latter year, he was appointed to a committee on the borough polls bill and quizzed ministers over their intentions relating to \\"alteration of the Trinidad laws\\". In 1830, he also urged the government to improve the nations public archives, securing returns on the works of commissioners, and accusing existing commissioners of the \\"grossest blunders\\" in printing records, then calling for an appointment of an entirely new commission made up of \\"competent persons of antiquarian taste and research\\". Later that year, he became a commissioner himself. In the same year, Protheroe called for opening up St James's Park and Regent's Park, and lamented any \\"architectural expense\\" on \\"extravagance [of] external decorations\\" in the construction of Pembroke dockyard chapel. He also called for the abolition of the Irish lord lieutenancy and called for interments in London to be moved \\"to a place distant from the metropolis\\" due to overcrowding. =Bristol= By the 1830 general election, Protheroe had already resolved to retire from his seat, instead seeking election at the two-member Bristol constituency‚Äîa seat his father had held between 1812 and 1820 and unsuccessfully contested in 1826. However, despite \\"assurance of support\\" from \\"tried friends\\" of his father, Protheroe junior was unsuccessful, ending third in the poll out of four candidates. He largely blamed this failure on \\"formidable opposition from the powerful body of the West Indian interest\\" and his support for the abolition of slavery. He ignored his advisors and maintained his position, \\"not by expense, not by interest, not by popular tumult, but by moral strength alone shall the triumph be obtained\\". During polling, he \\"stubbornly refused to concede defeat\\" and was then injured in a riot. Nevertheless, Protheroe was returned at the next election in 1831, elected unopposed with \\"unchanged principles\\" and \\"undiminished spirit\\". He declared to support the Grey ministry's parliamentary reform plans, \\"to vote for the bill, the whole bill, and nothing but the bill\\"‚Äîthen dividing for the bill at all stages. He was then, in 1831, appointed to the select committees for the East India Company and the West Indian colonies. He urged John Cam Hobhouse to reintroduce a bill to open select vestries, and presented a petition from Bristol to be included in such bills, before arguing in support of it and lamenting the \\"great injustice\\" from the \\"evils which must arise\\" from the \\"establishment of an unlimited number of beerhouses in the agricultural districts\\". Protheroe lost the seat at the next election in 1832. =Halifax= Protheroe then turned his attention to the two-member Halifax constituency where he was elected as a Radical at the 1835 general election, and held the seat until 1847 when he did not seek re-election.

The settled Sudan at the turn of the 20th century numbered some 405 houses in Abu Dhabi and Batin, 250 houses in Dubai, 300 in Sharjah and 12 in Ajman. The family also settled the islands of the Persian Gulf, with some 20 houses on Abu Musa and 40 families living on Sirri Island. Some 5,000 strong, the tribe was mostly settled in the coastal areas of the Trucial States. The Sudan mostly subsisted on fishing and pearling and did not own date gardens in the inland oases.  The Sudan in Qatar  The Sudan played an important part in the founding of Bida‚Äôa on Qatar‚Äôs eastern coast. The oldest quarter of the town was settled by members of the tribe from Abu Dhabi and Oman in 1766. In 1801 the British representative in Muscat, David Seton, suspected the tribe of being involved in piracy and sailed with the sultan of Oman in order to bombard Bida‚Äôa, but the waters were too shallow to allow his gunboat to come within range. In February 1841, after the Sudan were suspected of harbouring the pirate Jasim bin Jabir (known as Raqraqi) in Bida'a, a British squadron arrived to punish the headman, Salimayn bin Nasir al-Suwaidi. Upon a few warning shots being fired at the town, Salimayn paid a fine in cash and jewellery, and handed over Raqraqi's ship, which was set alight. In May 1843 Isa bin Tarif, head of the Al Bin Ali tribe and former sheikh of Huwailah, moved to Bida'a and forced the near-bankrupt Sudan to leave Bida'a and settle in Lingah. The northern Sudan of Qatar were an influential group until their power declined in 1867 after a Bahraini attack on Doha and Bida'a. They continued to make a living in the pearling trade and through seafaring. In the 1890s, however, relations with the sheikh of Doha Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani were tense and a move to the island of Al Zorah on the Trucial Coast was contemplated (see below). When that scheme failed they remained in Bida‚Äôa, which eventually merged with Doha. In 1915 the tribe had 80 out of 150 houses in the town, and they were exempt from pearling taxes.  Association with Bani Yas  In Abu Dhabi, the Sudan are closely associated with the Bani Yas and Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan's mother was a Suwaidi. He married the daughter of the Sheikh of the Sudan, Sultan bin Nasir Al Suwaidi. It was with the Sudan that Zayed conceived the idea of establishing a fort at Al Zorah in Ajman, in order to consolidate and build a bridgehead into the northern emirates. In 1897, a section of the Sudan under Sultan bin Nasser requested permission to settle Al Zorah with the support of Zayed, which was granted by the British Resident. Alarmed by the scheme, the Ruler of Ajman built a fort at one of the waterways connecting Al Zorah with the mainland (it was at the time an island) and the Ruler of Sharjah, Sheikh Saqr bin Khalid Al Qasimi, in 1890, appealed to the Resident to prevent this establishment of a non-Al Qasimi stronghold in the midst of his territory. This being upheld, to the annoyance of Zayed who had seen Al Zorah as an extension of his claim to the Northern coast, the scheme was abandoned and the decision to block it was subsequently upheld after a visit to Al Zorah by Major Percy Cox, the British Political Resident. The Sudan often played a key role in Abu Dhabi political affairs, with Sheikh Ahmad bin Khalifah Al Suwaidi leading the opposition to Shakhbut bin Sultan as Ruler, when this was proposed to the family and leading notables, supporting Hazza bin Sultan instead. In 1829, the area of Deira, the opposite side to the creek to Dubai, was settled by some 400 Sudan who had left Sharjah in 1826 following an argument with the Ruler, Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi.

It is noted for its salt water and mud with properties similar to that of Techirghiol. It features a spa consisting of an outdoor saltwater pool, an indoor heated swimming pool, sauna, jacuzzi, massage, fitness and sports grounds. The microrelief of the old salt-mining areas, with numerous excavations or pits, occupied today by salty sludges, springs and ponds and halophytic vegetation, present in the Figa valley, witness the ancient exploitation of salt in excavations with diameters ranging from 4‚Äì15 m, respectively with depths of up to 10 m. History The archaeological site of BƒÉile Figa is one of the most important monuments of prehistoric salt mining in Europe. The artifacts, whose age was established by the carbon-14 method, date back to around 1000 BC. A trough, of the same age, was presumably used to direct the water stream onto the salt walls for their sectioning. According to other authors, it was used to obtain salt by the briquetting process.

It specialises in the provision of dialysis to Indigenous Australians in remote communities across the Northern Territory, Western Australia and South Australia. History Purple House was formally established in 2002 by the Pintupi people of the Western Desert in response to a growing health and cultural crisis. A series of collaborative paintings were produced by senior Pintupi artists, many of whom were represented by Papunya Tula. The paintings raised over $1 million dollars at an auction at the Art Gallery of NSW in 2000 which funded the established of Western Desert Nganampa Walytja Palyantjaku Tjutaku Aboriginal Corporation. Remote Indigenous Australians are up to twenty times more likely to experience end-stage kidney failure than non-Indigenous people. Throughout the 1990s, increasing numbers of Aboriginal people were being forced to leave their traditional lands for end-stage renal failure. Many required dialysis which meant permanent relocation to regional centres such as Alice Springs or Darwin, away from country and family, and removing their ability to pass on important cultural knowledge to their communities. Purple House began dialysis services in a suburban house in Alice Springs, which was painted purple, inspiring its name Purple House. Its first remote dialysis clinic in Kintore opened in 2004. It now runs 18 other clinics in the NT, WA and SA and a mobile dialysis unit called the Purple Truck. The organisation is supported through an innovative mix of philanthropic and self- generated funds, and Northern Territory and Commonwealth Government support. Three new clinics opened in 2019, including Purple House's first South Australia clinic. Purple House has expanded significantly to offer social, aged care and NDIS support, as well as running a social enterprise called Bush Balm, which draws in Indigenous knowledge systems around bush medicine. After years of lobbying, in 2018 it was announced that dialysis in very remote areas would be funded by Medicare. Awards and recognitions Purple House received an Indigenous Governance Award from Reconciliation Australia in 2016. It was named Telstra NT Business of the Year in 2018. Purple House CEO, Sarah Brown AM was recognised with an Order of Australia in the Queen‚Äôs Birthday 2020 Honours List ‚Äúfor significant service to community health, to remote area nursing, and to the Indigenous community‚Äù.

Formed in 2018, the province is the 40th and the newest in the Anglican Communion. The province consists of four dioceses. Its primate and metropolitan is the Archbishop of Chile, Tito Zavala. History=Diocese of the Falkland Islands= During the 19th century, British immigrants to South America brought Anglicanism with them . The Patagonian Missionary Society, renamed South American Mission Society (SAMS) in 1868, was initially active in Tierra del Fuego and later extended its activities to the Araucanian region. It was responsible for the formation of all the early Anglican churches and missions in Chile. Waite Stirling, a missionary from the South American Missionary Society, was consecrated at Westminster Abbey on 21 December 1869 as the first Bishop of the Falkland Islands. The see of the bishop was in Buenos Aires . This was due to legal requirements at the time which did not allow the Church of England to consecrate or appoint bishops outside those territories under the jurisdiction of the Crown, but the jurisdiction of the bishop was stated to be all of South America apart from British Guiana. =Diocese of Chile= The Diocese of Chile, Bolivia and Peru was formed in 1963, as part of a general process of forming national dioceses out of the enormous diocese of the Falkland Islands. Following expansion it became the Diocese of Chile and Bolivia in 1971 when Peru became a separate diocese. It was again renamed the Diocese of Chile in 1981, following separation from Bolivia. Until 1974, the various dioceses of the southern cone were under the metropolitical oversight of the Archbishop of Canterbury. In that year a process began to inaugurate a new Anglican province. The Diocese of Chile was a constituent and founding diocese of the new Province of the Southern Cone of America in 1981, and remained part of that province until 2018, although the province was renamed in September 2014 as the Anglican Church of South America.Change recorded at Anglican Communion website. =Proposed autonomy= Following the change of provincial name, two constituent dioceses, Chile and Peru, both began expansion towards forming autonomous provinces. In 2017 the Diocese of Peru voted at its diocesan synod to abandon its plans to form an autonomous province, but the diocese of Chile continued its expansion towards that goal. As part of these preparations, auxiliary bishops were consecrated. Three auxiliary bishops, together with the diocesan bishop Tito Zavala, took responsibility for four geographical regions, and in 2018 these were formed into four new dioceses. Province of Chile Following approval from the Anglican Consultative Council the four Chilean dioceses were nominated to form an autonomous province, to be established in 2018, and named Iglesia Anglicana de Chile (Anglican Church of Chile). The inauguration was carried out in a special service on 4 November 2018 in Santiago. The Presiding Bishop of South America, Gregory Venables, presided at the service, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, presided over the inauguration and preached the sermon in the presence of bishops and archbishops from across South America and other parts of the Anglican Communion. Archbishop Welby handed primatial authority (represented by the symbolic handing over of a primatial cross) to Archbishop Tito Zavala, the Bishop of Santiago, and previously Bishop of Chile. Archbishop Zavala had previously served as Primate of South America from 2010 to 2016. The new province gives the statistics of 95 parishes and approximately 20,000 members for their membership. The House of Bishops at the formation of the province consisted of: *H√©ctor Zavala Mu√±oz (commonly known as Tito Zavala), consecrated 1998, Bishop of Santiago from 2018, first Archbishop; *Abelino Manuel Apeleo, consecrated 1994, Bishop of Temuco from 2018; *Samuel Morrison, consecrated 2018, Bishop of Valpara√≠so from 2018; *Him Enrique Lago, consecrated 2018, Bishop of Concepci√≥n from 2018; *Alfred Cooper, consecrated 2016, auxiliary bishop *Nelson Ojeda, consecrated 2016, auxiliary bishop Archbishops The Primate and Metropolitan of the province is the Archbishop of Chile.

Tito Zavala became the first Chilean native bishop in 2000; Abelino Manuel Apeleo became an assistant bishop in 2016. Anglican realignment The Anglican Church of South America, formerly known as Anglican Church of the Southern Cone of America, from which the Province of Chile was formed, has been involved in the Anglican realignment. Likewise the Anglican Church of Chile is also a member of the Global South and the Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON), and is in full communion with the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA), formed in 2009 by former members of the Episcopal Church in the United States and the Anglican Church of Canada, wishing to maintain a more conservative approach to biblical interpretation and authority. Representatives of the Anglican Church in North America were present at the inauguration of the new province, including former archbishop Robert Duncan and current Foley Beach.

Campaign The Labour Party were optimistic about making gains, and targeted seats in Battersea South, Clapham, Lewisham West, Wandsworth Central and Woolwich West. The Conservatives targeted the marginal Labour-held constituencies of Barons Court, Kensington North and Paddington North. Their manifesto argued that the Labour Party were wasting money; they proposed reducing rates, and encouraged Londoners to move to new towns.

As part of the Paspampres, it is affiliated to and leads all military bands within the INAF as the country's seniormost military band.

The band in its current capacity was created in January 1976 when the current Paspampres (then Paswalpres) was established and the band's first musicians formed up partly of personnel from the Kodam Jaya Headquarters Band which, for over a decade, served operationally as part of the joint Satgas Pomad Para task force during state visits and national holidays.

Zehner was a native of Franconia who moved to Munich in 1927 where she hosted a Ministry of Agriculture radio broadcast on home economics themes. She was ousted by the Nazis in 1933 because of her role as an organizer of Catholic women and youth. Following her dismissal, she started selling home items door- to-door first by bicycle, then motorcycle and finally by car. In 1935, she was arrested by the Nazis who accused her of making anti-Nazi statements at a meeting of housewives to discuss cooking and household problems. After her release, her Nazi neighbors harassed and threatened to kill her forcing her to move to a distant part of Munich where she later set up a small noodle factory. On August 8, 1945 following the German defeat, Zehner was appointed by the American Military Government to the reconstituted Munich City Council as its only woman member. She was the first woman to have any official position in the Bavarian State since the Nazis seized power. At the first election to the Bavarian state parliament on December 1, 1946 Zehner received a mandate as a deputy. From 1953 to 1969, she was chairwoman of the State Working Women's Association of the CSU (Christian Social Union as the Christian Democratic Party is known in Bavaria), the later women's union. On 3 July 1959, she was awarded the Bavarian Order of Merit. Zehner was quoted by the New York Times speaking about her resistance to the Nazis: Too many Germans have argued that it wasn't possible to resist the Nazis and live. I am the best evidence that it could be done, for I never ceased to fight them and I have survived. I never jointed the party nor any organization affiliated with it, nor did any member of my family, except one nephew, who was a member of the Hitler Jugend.

It was designed by built for Thomas Playfair from 1883 to 1884. It is also known as Former Harry's Bar and Sorrentos. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The subject land appears to have been largely undeveloped until the 1870s. The street now known as \\"Playfair Street\\" was not shown on a plan of the area dated 1868. Since the mid 1870s the street has been known by a number of names: * New George Street, - 1876; * Little Gloucester Street, - 1886; * Harrington Street, 1923-1953; and * Playfair Street, from 1953. The 1868 plan shows the subject land, part of a large block generally bounded by Argyle Street to the south, George Street to east, Union Street to the north and Gloucester Street (now Gloucester Walk) to the west. A laneway cuts through the south eastern portion of the block, accessing the properties fronting George Street and a large building connected to \\"Flour mills\\" located opposite the site. The Argyle Stores occupy the south western section of the block. The land on the western side of Playfair Street was part of Lot 2 of Section 85 granted to William Carr and John Rogers on 26 October 1838. This land included the southern portion of the site, land now occupied by Nos. 21-31 Playfair Street. In 1839 the land granted to Carr and Rogers was sold to Frederick Wright Unwin. Unwin commenced his \\"Bonded Stores\\" in the same year and in 1842 Unwin leased the northern section of his property. In 1870 part of Unwin's land was acquired by William Whaley Billyard who by the end of 1871 consolidated this with a grant made on 26 September 1871. This land was sold two years later to Robert Pemberton Richardson of Sydney, an auctioneer. A Certificate of Title dated December 1874, shows the land, including the subject sites, extending east from Gloucester Street with small frontage to George Street North. Richardson had by this time subdivided the land, part of DP 143, and offered the thirty one allotments for sale at auction on 11 December 1874. The lots were advertised as \\"Freehold City Allotments\\" about Little Gloucester Street and Mill Street. The plan shows the irregularly shaped allotments on the western side of Little Gloucester Street, generally with 15 feet frontages. The two end allotments, Lots 21 and 31 being a little wider. Lots 4 to 31 were advertised as being suitable as sites \\"for residences for small capitalists\\". The sale of the subject site was recorded on the Certificate of Title as follows: Lot 28 (Part Nos.13-15 Playfair Street) William George of Sydney, Labourer, 2 April 1875 Lot 29 (Part Nos.13-15 Playfair Street) Magnus George of Sydney, 14 October 1876 The subject site Lots 28‚Äì31, were purchased by Thomas Playfair and by 1879, only these lots remained undeveloped. The subject site, now Nos. 13-15 Playfair Street, remained undeveloped on the 1880 Dove Plan. Two sheds are shown abutting the single storey building at the rear of No. 17 and on the north eastern boundary. In 1883 Thomas Playfair commenced construction of two tenements known as Nos. 3-5 Gloucester Street (Nos. 13-15 Playfair Street). The building was first rated in June 1884 and in 1891, and were described as two storey houses of five rooms constructed with brick and cement walls and iron roof. The buildings were the last of the grouping of terraces now remaining on the western side of Playfair Street to be constructed. Nos. 13-15 were slightly more elaborate in style and detail. Early photographs indicate that the terrace was originally rendered with parapet, decorative rendered mouldings including cornices and string lines and arched window heads. The houses and other dwellings in the area generally appear to have been developed for the rental market. The Sands Directory indicates that this situation continued until 1901, when all of the allotments were resumed by the Minister for Public Works and the Sydney Harbour Trust became responsible for the site and buildings. The initial aim of the Trust, which was established as a result of the Plague which hit Sydney in early 1900, was to clean up the resumed areas and redevelop them for commercial use. However, the area within the boundaries of the resumption included many residential properties mixed with the wharves and commercial buildings that the Trust intended to use. The Trust gradually had to accept that it would have to take the role of landlord and manage the newly acquired residential properties and their occupants. Much of the housing in the area had become dilapidated by this time and demolitions and cleansing operations were undertaken by the Trust, however, repairs to the buildings that were retained, it is assumed such as the subject terraces in Playfair Street, and construction of new housing, on land deemed unsuitable for commercial use, was also undertaken from this time. The terrace came under the control of the Maritime Services Board in 1936. The MSB made major infrastructure changes in The Rocks area, however, it would appear made little changes to the dwellings. Despite the changes in the administration much of the area and fabric remained intact until the late 1960s. Much of the city had by this time been taken over for commercial purposes and resident population subsequently thinned. The Rocks became more derelict and public opinion generally regarded the place as a slum and largely favoured demolition and redevelopment. Two of the four terraces still tenanted by the mid 1970s were occupied by residents who had lived in the street for several decades, during which it appears that very little renovation or modification had taken place. Mr Thomas Kane, the tenant for the four roomed No. 13 Playfair Street, lived there with his daughter and several grandchildren in crowded conditions. The buildings were transferred to the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority in 1970 and along with the neighbouring terraces were originally slated for demolition. Tenders were called and a number of proposals were considered, including the use of the combined site for a carpark. It was an overseas visit by the SCRA's then Business Manager and Director that brought about a reversal and change of plan. The Director was impressed by the aesthetic and financial returns of refurbishing old and seemingly derelict buildings and on his return called for a reassessment of the situation. It was decided that the terrace would be retained and from this time the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority adapted the remaining houses as commercial premises and developed the rear of the site as Foundation Park. This marked the beginning of the Authority's role in the development of The Rocks as a tourist destination. At the end of the 1970s the character of the area and use and occupation of the buildings was redefined by the refurbishment of Playfair Street as a commercial and tourist zone and pedestrian precinct. In 1971-72 The Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority restored and refurbished the terraces for a restaurant.Perumal Murphy Alessi Pty Ltd, 2006  Description  These terraces, built in 1883, are slightly more elaborate in style than those of the \\"Tara Terrace\\" and the other houses in the terrace as a whole. Their external walls are finished in stucco and painted and incorporate Italianate details such as string courses, a wide cornice, decorative moulded brackets to sills and arched window heads. A parapet exists to the Playfair Street facade and the roof is of a much lower pitch than those of the adjoining buildings. Nevertheless, the buildings are representative of the Worker's housing of this slightly later period and share many features of the other terraces in Playfair Street.Tropman 1993: 30-31 Style: Victorian (Worker's housing); Storeys: Two; Facade: Brick & Cement walls; Side Rear Walls: Brick & cement walls; Roof Cladding: Corrugated iron; Floor Frame: Timber. = Condition = As at 22 March 2004, the archaeological assessment condition is partly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Floors level with street. Sandstone quarried up to Gloucester Street frontage. Evidence should still remain of outbuildings which were demolished in 1917. Under floor deposits may be partly disturbed, they were substantially filled in 1900 to floor level to stop rat infestation, and excavated in 1972, however the original under floor deposit may be lower than this. = Modifications and dates = *1972Terraces 13 & 15 were combined to form a larger space for a restaurant tenancy.  Heritage listing  As at 26 June 2002, this group of terraces (nos.13-31) is a good example of the both the terrace style of residential development and the subdivision patterns that occurred in the mid Victorian period of Sydney, particularly in the Rocks precinct. They are representative of typical workers housing being built for the rental market and indicate the minimal space and resource standard of the time. They formed part of a development which became a slum typical of the inner city residential areas during the early and mid Victorian period, when the degree and success of government intervention in building and health affairs was minimal.Tropman 1993: 68 The houses show many of the typical features of the worker's terraces erected in Sydney during the middle Victorian period. Their location and current usage makes them easily accessible to the public. However, the way they have been divided confuses the visual understanding of them as houses. As a whole, the Argyle Terrace clearly demonstrates changes in architectural style which occurred during this period. The houses built between 1875-77 are of a simple, undecorated style, while terraces No.13-15, built in 1883, are quite clearly examples of the Italianate style.Tropman 1993: 67 They demonstrate clearly the stages of development of this group and the typical subdivision patterns which occurred during the period 1875‚Äì1883. Together with the adjacent terraces at 17-31 Playfair Street they formed first residential restoration/revitalisation project undertaken by the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority in the 1970s. The terrace is a representative part of the former diverse character of the Rocks, which included residential, retail and commercial uses, all typically associated with waterfront activities, in close proximity to each other. The Argyle Terrace has scientific and research potential because of the archaeological potential which may remain in the under floor deposits and the rear yard spaces which may reveal information of working class lifestyles and values. The terraces have the potential to yield information relevant to the construction techniques and materials associated with the modest dwellings of the late 19th century period. Caminetto's Restaurant and site are of State heritage significance for its historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. Argyle Terrace - Caminetto's Restaurant was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Terraces at Nos. 13-15 Playfair Street are historically significant as representative examples of late Victorian terrace development that was constructed during this period, particularly in areas such as The Rocks where residences in vicinity to places of employment were in demand. Together with the Atherden Street terraces and remnants in Foundation Park, they demonstrate the subdivision pattern that occurred in the period between 1870 and mid 1880s. The terraces are representative of relatively simple, high density speculative developments which were built during the mid to late Victorian period by developers keen to maximise profits. The site of the terrace, which extends back to the rock face to the west, and adjacent Foundation Park is significant as it emphasises the difficulties faced when developing in The Rocks precinct due to the topography of the area. The buildings are part of a group that were the first restoration and revitalisation works undertaken by the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority, commencing in 1972. The project represented a shift in both the philosophy of the organisation and general approach and understanding of the history and development of the area. The resultant changes to the buildings and area are significant as they represent a shift away from the predominantly residential use of the immediate vicinity to commercial and public use of the area. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Terraces at Nos. 13-15 Playfair Street are associated with a number of government bodies who administered and later undertook major works to the buildings. These include the Sydney Harbour Trust, Maritime Services Board, Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority and Sydney Cove Authority. Nos. 13-15 are associated with Thomas Playfair, local businessman, Alderman and Mayor, who owned the land and constructed the buildings as speculative dwellings. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Terraces at Nos. 13-15 Playfair Street demonstrate the changes in architectural style during the 1880s with the simple Italianate decoration of the front fa√ßade in contrast with the simple and undecorated style of the adjacent terraces constructed during the 1870s (Nos. 17-31). Despite the demolition of the rear wings and some internal walls and features the terraces retain a sense of their original two room configuration on each floor, original spatial qualities and simplicity of the interior and lack of decoration, expected for speculative type development. The terraces are prominent elements in the Playfair streetscape primarily due to their smaller scale and location. Together with the adjacent Playfair Street Terraces (Nos. 17-31) they represent the mid tho late Victorian development of the area and make a positive contribution to varied character and nature of the precinct. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Terraces at Nos. 13-15 are associated with a number of tenants, residential and more recently commercial occupants of no particular note. The buildings were part of a development that became a slum that was, after some intervention, improved and revitalised so that the buildings could continue to be part of the social and economic life of The Rocks and Sydney in general. The buildings have some association with the work of local community groups and Green Bans which brought about a change of philosophy and regard for the existing built environment in The Rocks and contributed to the decision to retain and restore the buildings. The works undertaken in the 1970s became part of what was the first \\"restoration\\" project undertaken by the SCRA. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Terraces at Nos. 13‚Äì15, despite some adaptive works, retain their fundamental form and character and many features of workers' terraces erected in Sydney during the late Victorian period. With Nos. 17-31 Playfair Street, they also demonstrate the changes of style in low scale residential accommodation between the 1870s and 1880s. The buildings and site have scientific and research potential because of the archaeological resources that may remain below the floor and backyard areas that may demonstrate the living conditions and construction techniques of modest dwellings in the late 19th century. Their location and current use make them easily accessible to the public and contributes to their understanding. The connecting stair, walkway and platforms of Foundation Park and Gloucester Walk also assist the appreciation of the buildings and site. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. There are a number of terraces constructed in the mid to late 19th century remaining in The Rocks area, however, with the Atherden Street Terraces, the terraces are one of the few groupings of modest, speculative dwellings with Italianate details remaining in The Rocks area. Similar examples, however, remain in other inner city suburbs such Paddington and Surry Hills. With Nos. 17‚Äì31, Nos. 13-15 Playfair Street are the only \\"residential\\" scaled buildings now remaining in Playfair Street which is now characterised by larger commercial buildings. With the Atherden Street Terraces these form an important reminder of the predominantly residential character of the immediate area.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  In 1834, Robert Campbell snr. was granted this section of land above his water front property. Campbell sold the land to Frederick Wright Unwin in 1841 and in 1847 Unwin reconveyed the property to the Trustees of Campbell's property. In 1848, Joshua Frey Josephson brought the parcel of land containing 25.25 perches and, in 1852, he conveyed the property to 'George Atherden of Campbell's Wharf in Sydney, aforesaid Wharfinger'. On the eastern portion of this parcel of land George Atherden erected four stone cottages. On the other half of the land, stables were erected and by 1879 they were demolished. In 1880 G. Atherden trustees, Robert Campbell Close and Charles Campbell conveyed the vacant land, lot 6, to Thomas Playfair of Sydney, a Rocks butcher, for ¬£494. In 1880, Thomas Playfair erected four terrace houses on lot 6. The dwellings are described as being of two storeys with four rooms, and were constructed of brick and cement walls with the roof clad in slate. In 1882 the annual assessed income was 42 pounds. At the beginning of 1882 Playfair's tenants in these dwellings were George Moore, Thomas Dixon, Mr Smith and William R. Scott. By 1889 a further roof was added at the rear of each tenement. In 1896 T. Playfair's terraces were managed by Mr. Jessie Walker and Alfred Playfair as trustees and benefactors of T. Playfair's will.

It grows on dry banks and grassy slopes from 1700-2600 meters above sea level.  Description  Hypericum lancasteri is a shrub that grows to be up to 1 meter tall, with branches that are suberect to spreading. Its stems are purple-red and 4-lined, and are somewhat ancipitous when the plant is young, and eventually become terete later on. The internodes grow between 10 and 60 millimeters long, sometimes being shorter than the leaves and sometimes exceeding the leaves. It has reddish-brown bark as it ages. The leaves are petiolate, and their petioles grow between 1-1.5 millimeters long. They have 30-60 lamina that grow 9-30 millimeters long and have laminar glands, dots, and short streaks, but sparse or absent ventral glands. There are typically 1-11 flowers that come from 1-3 nodes that are lax, with relatively stout branches. The species is deciduous. Its flowers are 30-55 mm in diameter and are stellate. They have buds that are oval-shaped and acute. The sepals number 8-11 and grow 3-4 mm long, are free, and are reddish in color. The species' petals are golden yellow, with no tinge of red. There are numerous stamen fascicles, each with about 45-50 stamens, the longest growing 11-16 mm long, with golden yellow anthers of similar shade to the petals. Its seeds dark red- brown and grow 1-1.3 mm long.  Cultivation  Hypericum lancasteri grows best in full sun or partial shade, and can grow in sheltered or exposed conditions. It is most suited for well-drained areas, but can grow well in damp areas as well. The species can grow in chalky or sandy soil, as well as in clay or loam. It is not greatly affected by the pH value of the soil it grows in, nd can be grown in slightly acidic or alkaline areas without much impact. It is a hardy plant that can survive through most severe winters. The species can be propagated from softwood cuttings taken from full-grown plants, or can be sown from seed outdoors in the fall. It can also be sown indoors before the last frost and then transplanted in the spring. The species is generally pest-free, but is susceptible to developing rust.

Winning national competitions with her compositions, she worked as a musicologist at the National Museum, preserving indigenous music and cataloguing instruments. She also gave lectures at the National School of Music and was enrolled in the in 1946. Biography Cameu was born on March 28, 1903 in the city Rio de Janeiro. At the age of 7, she began learning to play the piano, later studying at Col√©gio Pedro II. She auditioned under Brazilian composer Alberto Nepomuceno in 1919, and was allowed to enter the . Within a year, Nepomuceno died and she became the pupil of Jo√£o Nunes, graduating with a gold medal in 1923. She furthered her studies in composition, training under Francisco Braga, , and Oscar Lorenzo Fern√°ndez. In 1929, Cameu recorded indigenous music for the National Museum and became interested in adapting indigenous music for choral presentations. Working with museum director, Edgar Roquette-Pinto, to transcribe phonograph recordings to preserve indigenous music, she studied their music forms. In 1934, Cameu debuted her own first composition at the National Institute of Music's salon. In 1936, she presented, in a performance at the , her String Quartet in B Minor, Op. 12, later entering the composition in a competition started by the . Her composition won second place on May 10, 1937. She again entered a composition in a competition, her symphonic poem Supl√≠cio by Felipe dos Santos, winning first place from the Brazilian Symphonic Orchestra and Press Department in 1943. The following year her Sinfonia concertante (Quadro sinfonico) won a Brazilian Symphony Orchestra (Orquestra Sinf√¥nica Brasileira) competition. She entered the in 1946, occupying chair N¬∞ 19. Between 1955 and her retirement in 1973, Cameu served as program editor at for the program M√∫sica e M√∫sicos do Brasil (Music and Musicians of Brazil). Simulaneously, she lectured at the National School of Music and other civic organizations, and performed cataloguing and analysis at the National Museum. With the use of bibliographic references and museum documents, Cameu was the first to write about many types of indigenous instruments in Portuguese, separating the instruments by percussion, wind, and strings. The categories are further subdivided by how the instruments sound and the instrument's parts. Her style of writing, which proposes that comparisons of each ethnic group's music should be completed only after the music of those ethnic groups are understood, was considered innovative for Brazil. Brazilian ethnomusicologist Elizabeth Travassos wrote of Cameu in Music in Latin America and the Caribbean that the brief reference within the book could not \\"possibly do justice to the monumental contribution she made in her unprecedented effort at synthesis\\". Publications Cameu wrote articles about indigenous music publishing in such journals as Revista Brasileira de Cultura, Revista Brasileira de Folclore, Revista do Conservat√≥rio Brasileiro de M√∫sica, and Jornal das Letras, among others. Her article Apontamentos sobre m√∫sica ind√≠gena (Notes about Indigenous Music) was published in 1950 in the newspaper Tribuna da Imprensa. Another important work, Valor hist√≥rico de Bras√≠lio Itiber√™ da Cunha e sua fantasia caracter√≠stica: A Sertaneja (The Historical Value of Bras√≠lio Itiber√™ da Cunha and his characteristic fantasy: A Sertaneja), published in 1970 in the Brazilian Magazine of Culture. Her only published book, Introdu√ß√£o ao estudo da m√∫sica ind√≠gena no Brasil (Introduction to the Study of Indigenous Music in Brazil, 1977), is one of the most complete studies undertaken on indigenous music in the country.

The site was briefly reused by the Germans during the occupation of France in the Second World War.  First World War  Clairmarais aerodrome (at Clairmarais, Pas-de-Calais) was used by the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and later the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the First World War.

This photograph, with the aircraft drawn up tail-to-tail, established a tradition for No. 1 Squadron, which has used the same format for squadron photographs in the succeeding decades.  Second World War During World War II, the airfield was rebuilt for use by the Luftwaffe as a satellite of their main St. Omer fighter air station, which was situated between Longuenesse and Wizernes; there was no hardened runway at Clairmarais and the damp ground conditions made it unusable in wet weather. A small hangar made of corrugated iron was disguised as a church. On the south side of the airfield was a dispersal area equipped with more than thirty aircraft revetments. The airfield was used by Jagdgeschwader 26 during 1940 and 1941, but had become disused by 1942. Allied photographic reconnaissance in March 1944 showed that the runway had been permanently obstructed by trenches and mine craters.

He was Gothenburg's first city engineer, a position he held from 1717 until 1727. In 1727, he was appointed city architect in Stockholm, where he stayed for 45 years until 1772. During this time, he also began an influential school of architecture. He was an older brother of the engineer and architect Bengt Wilhelm Carlberg, who replaced him as a city engineer in Gothenburg when Johan Eberhard moved to Stockholm. Life and works Building plan for the Hobelinska house from 1767, signed by Eberhard Carlberg. Carlberg began work in 1700 at the fortification in Marstrand, working at first as a volunteer but later (January 11, 1702 until 1703) as project leader. In 1703, Carlberg became a lieutenant in the N√§rkes and V√§rmlands reserve regiment (Swedish \\"trem√§nningsregementen\\"), participating in their field training in Latvia and Lithuania. In Gothenburg, Carlberg became a lieutenant at the fortification on November 19, 1709 and the city engineer on September 14, 1717. He resigned from the Gothenburg fortification with the rank of captain on February 18, 1721.

The Army's commissariat warehouse (1728-32 ) at Skeppsholmen is Carlberg's only fully preserved monumental building in Stockholm. As city architect, he issued regulations intended to promote harmonious appearance of neighboring buildings and also established a \\"school\\" to train young architects. His critics, while praising Carlberg's \\"force and vigor\\" warned that \\"If you put more iron into the fire than you have time to watch over, many will get burned.\\" Erik Palmstedt was one of the students in Carlstadt's \\"school,\\" which he entered when only 14 years old.

She was one of the first women to become chartered accountants in Scotland, and conducted a successful campaign to ensure that the Bruntsfield Hospital for Women and the Elsie Inglis Memorial Maternity Hospital in Edinburgh remained staffed exclusively by qualified female medical professionals.  Early life  Daughter of James Lowe and Margaret Trotter, Lowe attended Berwickshire High School in Duns until the age of 16, when she decided to abandon her studies and begin, instead, a career at the Post Office Savings Bank in London. To her father‚Äôs dismay, Lowe lived and worked as a clerk in London throughout WWI, only returning to Scotland years later to take up a post as an apprentice with the firm Chiene & Tate in Edinburgh.  Career in accountancy  Thanks to the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919, Lowe was able to begin pursuing a career in accountancy. In preparation for her examinations, Lowe attended classes at The University of Edinburgh, gaining certificates in Accounting and Business Methods and Mercantile Law. In 1926, after nine years of training at Cheine & Tate, Lowe became one of the first women in Scotland to officially qualify as a Chartered Accountant. Two years later, Lowe set up her private accountancy business in Queen Street, Edinburgh, which she personally ran for most of her life.  Charitable work  Lowe was a keen participant in the life of her community, and was actively engaged in the work of many charities and societies, particularly those benefiting women and the elderly. She served as honorary treasurer for a number of organisations including the Scottish Women's Lyceum Club, the Women's Maintenance Council of the Royal Infirmary, the Scottish Society of Women Artists and the Saltire Society. = The Bruntsfield Hospital for Women and the Elsie Inglis Memorial Hospital = In 1957, following a decision by the South Eastern Regional Hospital Board of Scotland to advertise a vacancy occurring at the Brunstfield Hospital for Women and the Elsie Inglis Memorial Hospital as open to both male and female qualified applicants, Lowe begun campaigning to perpetuate the hospitals' special status as institutions staffed solely by legally qualified medical women. Lowe's campaign lasted several months and involved many organised events and protests, as well as delegation visits to the Regional Board and the Secretary of State. Eventually, having seen her requests refused on multiple occasions, Lowe, with the help of nine more local women, took the issue to the Court of Session, where a judgement in favour of the campaign was achieved. In May 1958, a female medical practitioner was finally appointed to the post.  Honours  As part of the New Year Honours in 1964, Lowe was awarded an MBE for her work in support of various charitable organisations in service of the elderly.

It has O(n2) worst time complexity which occurs when the input list is reverse sorted. It has a best case time complexity of O(n) which occurs when the input is a list that is already sorted. Strand sort is not in-place as its space complexity is O(n). The algorithm first moves the first element of a list into a sub-list. It then compares the last element in the sub-list to each subsequent element in the original list. Once there is an element in the original list that is greater than the last element in the sub-list, the element is removed from the original list and added to the sub-list. This process continues until the last element in the sub-list is compared to the remaining elements in the original list. The sub-list is then merged into a new list. Repeat this process and merge all sub-lists until all elements are sorted. This algorithm is called strand sort because there are strands of sorted elements within the unsorted elements that are removed one at a time. This algorithm is also used in J Sort for fewer than 40 elements.  Example  This example is based on the description of the algorithm provided in the book, IT Enabled Practices and Emerging Management Paradigms. Step 1: Start with a list of numbers: {5, 1, 4, 2, 0, 9, 6, 3, 8, 7 } Step 2: Next move the first element of the list into a new sub-list: sub-list contains {5} Step 3: Then iterate through the original list and compare each number to 5 until there is a number greater than 5. * 1 < 5 so 1 is not added to the sub-list. * 4 < 5 so 4 is not added to the sub- list. * 2 < 5 so 2 is not added to the sub-list. * 0 < 5 so 0 is not added to the sub-list. * 9 > 5 so 9 is added to the sub-list and removed from the original list. Step 4: Now compare 9 with the remaining elements in the original list until there is a number greater than 9. * 6 < 9 so 6 is not added to the sub-list. * 3 < 9 so 3 is not added to the sub-list. * 8 < 9 so 8 is not added to the sub-list. * 7 < 9 so 7 is not added to the sub-list. Step 5: Now there are no more elements to compare 9 to so merge the sub-list into a new list, called solution-list. After step 5, the original list contains {1, 4, 2, 0, 6, 3, 8, 7} The sub-list is empty, and the solution list contains {5, 9} Step 6: Move the first element of the original list into sub-list: sub-list contains {1} Step 7: Iterate through the original list and compare each number to 1 until there is a number greater than 1. * 4 > 1 so 4 is added to the sub- list and 4 is removed from the original list. Step 8: Now compare 4 with the remaining elements in the original list until there is a number greater than 4. * 2 < 4 so 2 is not added to the sub-list. * 0 < 4 so 0 is not added to the sub-list. * 6 > 4 so 6 is added to the sub-list and is removed from the original list. Step 9: Now compare 6 with the remaining elements in the original list until there is a number greater than 6. * 3 < 6 so 3 is not added to the sub-list. * 8 > 6 so 8 is added to the sub-list and is removed from the original list. Step 10: Now compare 8 with the remaining elements in the original list until there is a number greater than 8. * 7 < 8 so 7 is not added to the sub-list. Step 11: Since there are no more elements in the original list to compare {8} to, the sub-list is merged with the solution list. Now the original list contains {2, 0, 3, 7}, the sub-list is empty and the solution-list contains: {1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}. Step 12: Move the first element of the original list into sub-list. Sub-list contains {2} Step 13: Iterate through the original list and compare each number to 2 until there is a number greater than 2. * 0 < 2 so 0 is not added to the sub-list. * 3 > 2 so 3 is added to the sub-list and is removed from the original list. Step 14: Now compare 3 with the remaining elements in the original list until there is a number greater than 3. * 7 > 3 so 7 is added to the sub-list and is removed from the original list. Step 15: Since there are no more elements in the original list to compare {7} to, the sub-list is merged with the solution list. The original list now contains {0}, the sub-list is empty, and solution list contains: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Step 16: Move the first element of the original list into sub-list. Sub-list contains {0}. Step 17: Since the original list is now empty, the sub-list is merged with the solution list. The solution list now contains: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. There are now no more elements in the original list, and all of the elements in the solution list have successfully been sorted into increasing numerical order.  Implementation  Since Strand Sort requires many insertions and deletions, it is best to use a linked list when implementing the algorithm. Linked lists require constant time for both insertions and removals of elements using iterators. The time to traverse through the linked list is directly related to the input size of the list. The following implementation is done in Java 8 and is based on the description of the algorithm from the book, IT Enabled Practices and Emerging Management Paradigms. package strandSort; import java.util.*; public class strandSort { static LinkedList solList = new LinkedList(); static int k = 0; /*This is a recursive Strand Sort method.

History=Congregational Church= The Roath Park Congregational Church began in 1897, when a tin tabernacle was erected to serve the growing population in what had formerly been a largely rural area, but was rapidly urbanising by the early 20th Century. It was located in Mackintosh Place, but the congregation moved to the church's present location in 1910, when the building by Habershon, Fawkner & Company was completed. In its early days, the church's finances were often delicate, to the point that it was sometimes difficult to pay the minister's stipend, though the congregation saw considerable growth in the years after the permanent building was finished. By 1920, he church had 400 members and was in use by various groups‚Äî it was reported to often be necessary to arrive early on a Sunday in order to secure a seat. The tin tabernacle was moved next door to the church, where it served as a hall, and was later replaced by a purpose-built hall in 1927. During the Second World War, the church suffered bomb damage which necessitated a refurbishment, which was completed in 1950. During the refit, the pinnacles which had capped the tower since 1910 were removed and were not replaced. =United Reformed Church= When the majority of British Congregational and Presbyterian churches merged in 1972, the church became the Roath Park United Reformed Church. Due to the merge, the area now had a number of large UR churches in tight concentration‚Äî as well as Roath Park, St Andrew's in Roath and Plasnewydd United Reformed (both of which are around a similar size), and Minster Road United Reformed were far in excess of the number of worshippers in a time when church attendances were falling nationally. Minster Road combined with Star Street URC (which subsequently closed upon the merger). Already struggling, Roath Park was left in pitiful financial grounds after needing to fund major repairs in the 1990s, after which it became a joint pastorate with Minster Road. Eventually, the church closed when it formally merged with Minster Road in 2008, and the remaining congregants transferred to the latter (whose name was changed to Parkminster to reflect the union). =Independent Evangelical Church= The church was put up for sale after closure. In January 2009, it was purchased by Tabernacle Cardiff, a splinter group from Heath Evangelical Church which had been meeting in the Heath Citizen's Hall since 2003. The building was purchased on a bid of just over the guide price of ¬£425,000 owing to donations and pledges by friends and members of the church which led to it obtaining a mortgage. Worship began again in the building in March 2009. Now thriving, the church holds services in both English and Welsh. Listing In 1999, the building gained Grade II Listed status 'primarily for its well-integrated interior containing handsome ceiling and trusses, supported on two levels of columns with Gothic braces, elegant gallery fronts and original fittings'. Heath Evangelical Church Heath Evangelical Church began as the Heath Forward Movement Hall, which opened on 11 November 1900, with the first members being enrolled on 27 January 1901. Highly active during the 1904-1905 Welsh revival (it was once described as being 'alive with Revival fire'), the church was replaced by the present building in 1906. Seth Joshua's mission reported in 1907 that the church was 'waiting the coming tide', and it was not unknown for people to queue for services at this stage. The church pursued a strong missionary program both at home and abroad . After some years of disagreement in the 1960s regarding the rising trend of ecumenicalism, the congregation seceded from the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist Church on 1 January 1971 after struggle which involved a sit-in. In the closing decades of the 20th Century, it was one of the best-attended churches in Cardiff, with 900 members in the 1980s. Work amongst Cardiff's student community also became prominent, with the church appointing a full-time worker for overseas students in 1981. In 1985, a group left to form Highfields Church, and moved into the disused Cathays Presbyterian Church in 1997.

It further authorizes the United States Center for Safe Sport to ensure that aspiring U.S. Olympic athletes can report allegations of abuse to an independent and non-conflicted entity for investigation and resolution, and to make sure that all national governing bodies follow the strictest standards for child abuse prevention and detection. The bill amends the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act, under the Commerce Committee's jurisdiction, to expand the purposes of USOC to promote a safe environment in sports that is free from abuse. The Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act of 2017 combines separate bills introduced in the 115th Congress by Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and John Thune (R-SD) in response to the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal, allegations made against personnel involved with USA Swimming and USA Taekwondo, and following Senate hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee on issues of athlete safety. Senator Feinstein introduced S. 534, the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act on March 6, 2017. Senator Thune introduced S. 1426, the United States Center for Safe Sport Authorization Act, on June 29, 2017. Following negotiations, the two bills were merged and ultimately signed into law by President Donald Trump on February 14, 2018.

Nephron Physiol 122(1-2): 1‚Äì6 This condition is also known as idiopathic multicentric osteolysis with nephropathy. It is characterised by dental abnormalities and nephrocalcinosis. Presentation The dental abnormalities include * hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta * microdontia * intra-pulpal calcification * impacted posterior teeth with hyperplastic pericoronal follicles * gingival fibromatosis * ectopic calcifications on gingival and pericoronal tissues Genetics This condition is caused by mutations in the FAM20A gene. This gene encodes a protein - the Golgi apparatus associated secretory pathway pseudokinase. The gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 17 (17q24.2). Pathogensis The protein is an allosteric activator of the Golgi serine/threonine protein kinase and is involved in biomineralization of teeth. Diagnosis The diagnosis may be suspected on the basis of the constellation of clinical features. It is made by sequencing the FAM20A gene. This condition is usually diagnosed in childhood but may not be recognised until early adulthood. The diagnosis is suspected on the combination of nephrocalcinosis and dental abnormalities. =Differential diagnosis= * Epidermolysis bullosa * Jalili syndrome * Raine syndrome * Tricho-dento-osseous syndrome Treatment There is no specific treatment for this condition currently known and management of its various features is the norm.

It is a two-storey brick building situated on a rocky hill, overlooking the town and the Nile valley. It was originally built in the 9th century, serving as the richly adorned representative building of the Makurian kings. In 1317, during the period of Makurian decline, it was converted into a mosque, serving this purpose until it was closed and turned into a historic monument in 1969. Shortly afterwards Polish archaeologists from the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology of the University of Warsaw began to excavate the building. It has been described as possibly \\"the most important, symbolic edifice in the medieval history of Sudan\\". It is presently the oldest preserved mosque in Sudan. History=Makurian Throne Hall (9th century‚Äì1317)= Worn out painting from the central hall on the upper floor, showing Virgin Mary and the Christ Child. The latter is reaching out towards a date tree. From the late 5th century Old Dongola (Old Nubian: Tungul) was to be the capital of the Nubian kingdom of Makuria, which converted to Christianity in the mid-6th century and successfully asserted its independence from the early Muslim conquests in the 7th century. Between the 9th and 11th centuries the town enjoyed a golden age. In the 9th century, several representative buildings were constructed, among them the Throne Hall. It was probably built in the first half of the century, during the reign of King Georgios I () and his father Zacharias III (). It was located on a rocky outcrop in the eastern part of the city. From this prominence the two-storey building enjoyed an extensive view of the town and the Nile. Its purpose has been interpreted differently over the years, ranging from church, monastery and royal castle. However, its internal design suggests that the building had an official, non-residential purpose, and that it was intended to impress visitors. The actual throne hall was on the upper floor, which official delegations and processions reached by ascending a monumental staircase. Both the throne hall and the staircase were adorned with wall paintings. During the 11th‚Äì12th centuries they were altered. From 1265 Makuria endured repeated invasions by the Mamluk sultanate, which, from 1276, usually installed a puppet king on the Makurian throne. At the end of the 13th century, after yet another confrontation with the Mamluks, the most prestigious buildings of Old Dongola, among them the Throne Hall, lay in ruins and the population had dropped drastically due to deportations. The Throne Hall in particular had both its south and northwest devastated. Shortly after the damage was inflicted, at the turn of the 13th century, the building was repaired, although not in its entirety and with various modifications. =Mosque (1317‚Äì1969)= In 1316, the Mamluks intervened into Makurian affairs once more, intending to install prince Barshambu on the throne. In contrast to the kings before him, he was a Muslim. On May 29, 1317 he converted the Throne Hall into a mosque, as is confirmed by a marble inscription. Alterations to the building, especially in the central hall on the upper floor, were made according to its new function, such as the inclusion of a mihrab and the application of plaster over the Christian wall paintings. Barshambu was not popular among his subjects due to his attitude and his reforms; Nubiologist Wlodziemierz Godlewski postulates that the conversion of the Throne Hall might have played a part in his fall. Barshambu was eventually murdered by his own followers in the same year. After his death Makuria was ruled by both Muslim and Christian kings. None of them dared to restore the former function of the building, as the Mamluk sultans supported its new function. The mosque in 1821 A civil war caused the destruction of Old Dongola in 1365. The Makurian kings fled to Lower Nubia in the north, where they would maintain themselves for approximately 150 years. Old Dongola, abandoned by Makuria, came under the control of the Arabic Banu Ja'd tribe and eventually a new political entity, the so-called \\"Kingdom of Dongola Town\\", which was incorporated into the Funj sultanate during the early-16th century. The building is recorded to have served as a residence for Mecca pilgrims. However, during the 17th‚Äì19th centuries the ground floor was probably inaccessible. In the second half of the 18th century a local sheikh Sati Hamid Sawar is recorded to have renovated the mosque extensively. From the early 19th century the building was repeatedly described by western travellers and researchers. In the late-19th century Old Dongola was abandoned, probably for economic reasons, but the mosque remained in use. In 1906 it was extensively documented for the first time. One year later it received another restoration by Ahmed Helmi, naib of the mamur of Debba; numerous others conducted by the Sudan Antiquities Service and various museums followed in the mid-20th century. It ceased operating as a place of worship in 1969, but it has been preserved and is presently the oldest preserved mosque in Sudan. =Historic site (1969‚Äìpresent)= After the salvage excavation of Faras Cathedral, Polish archaeologists turned their attention to Old Dongola, where they started digging from 1964. Between 1970 and 1983 they excavated the Throne Hall and documented its architecture and wall paintings. It is intended that the Old Dongola site be transformed into an archaeological park. The construction of a steel roof is planned, providing protection and forming a stabilizing framework. After researching the wall paintings on the staircase and the main room on the first floor, ideas have emerged about the iconography and chronology. From 2018 to 2023 Old Dongola will be the subject of a large, multidisciplinary project researching the transformations that occurred between the 14th and early-19th centuries. Architecture The Throne Hall was inspired by Byzantine architecture, providing a testament to the Makurian attachment to Byzantine culture. Very similar audience halls are known from the Bulgarian Empire, imitating, albeit on a smaller scale, those of Constantinople. The Throne Hall, measuring in height, in length and in width, was built of mud bricks, red (fired) bricks and sandstone. Wall paintings Magus on horseback The wall paintings in the Throne Hall have suffered damage from rain water, termites and bats. They are located at the staircase and in the central hall and show influences by Byzantine models. The walls of the staircase had two layers of painted plaster, showing Archangel Michael wielding a spear, two warrior saints (one on foot and one on horseback) as well as several unidentifiable standing figures. The central hall also had multiple layers of painted plaster, the amount varying from wall to wall. Its east wall housed a large nativity scene featuring the Virgin Mary lying on a mattress, a crib with the Christ Child, angels and, on the left side of the painting, the three Biblical Magi. The colour scheme is mostly limited to yellows, oranges, reds and violets. The eastern part of the south wall features a fragmentary depiction of Archangel Michael and the Holy Trinity, while the western part was divided into two scenes, one showing Mary holding the Christ Child, who reaches out for a palm tree. Again the colours are mostly limited to violet, yellow and red. The iconography of this last scene is unique in a Makurian context. The other scene from the western part of the south wall initially featured the Transfiguration, but was later painted over with the Holy Trinity and a (barely preserved) king wearing a horned crown. On the west wall a king with a scepter and a Byzantine crown, as well as two standing figures with halos, can be seen. The north wall features a large cross, a priest and a king, who wears a crown, a blue veil and a white robe. A later layer of painted plaster added the twenty-four elders from the Book of Revelation, depicted wearing white robes and wielding palm leaves, while sitting on thrones.

They are considered to be the first women in Europe to be ordained as pastors. Biography Born in Ludwigshafen, Germany, on 18 May 1885, Laura Elisabeth Rosa Gutknecht was brought up in Chur before she studied to become a teacher in Z√ºrich.

Appointed as assistant pastors at Zurich's Grossm√ºnster, the two were principally involved in social work. Although the church and their male colleagues would have liked them to become vicars of their own parishes, as they did not have the right to vote, in 1920 the governmental authorities concluded that women could not be assigned to publicly funded administrative positions such as pastors in charge of their own parishes. They therefore remained as assistants for the remainder of their careers. In 1939, Gutknecht founded and was the first president of the Swiss Association of Female Theologians.

By pooling their money and buying multiple tickets collectively, players increase their chance of winning a lottery draw and share any winnings between them. In the UK, 1 in 5 of top game prizes across Lotto, EuroMillions, and EuroMillions UK Millionaire Maker are won by syndicates.  History  Lotteries have been around since the days of the Chinese Han dynasty, with keno slips believed to have financed significant landmarks like the Great Wall of China. The first known form of collective lottery playing came about in the 18th century in England. State lotteries began in England in the 1690s, but priced out much of the public. As a result, instead of buying full lottery tickets, individuals began buying shares of tickets. People started buying these shares with others and sharing any winnings between them, and the notion of collective lottery playing was born. Some even placed advertisements in newspapers looking for people to share with. In 1798, four low-paid workers reportedly shared a prize of ¬£20,000 between them, which equates to around ¬£1.2m in today‚Äôs money. As government and state-franchised lotteries began to emerge in nations across the world, organized lottery syndicates became more and more prominent. People now typically form lottery syndicates with people they know, like co-workers or family members. Each member pays money to a syndicate organizer who is in charge of buying tickets each week and distributing any winnings. However, online lottery syndicates have gained plenty of traction in recent years. A syndicate formed on Facebook won ¬£1.1 million on the EuroMillions in 2015, whilst there are plenty of sites that enter individuals into lottery syndicates with other online players.  Notable wins  Lottery syndicates have claimed some huge prizes in recent years. The largest on record is the $218.6 million won by an anonymous Maryland-based syndicate known as the ‚ÄòThree Amigos‚Äô in 2013. After taxes, the three members went home with $35 million each. Another notable win came from New Jersey, where a sixteen-strong syndicate called ‚ÄòOcean‚Äôs 16‚Äô bagged $149 million between them. The New Jersey‚Äôs Ocean County Department of Vehicle Services employees earned $3.8 million each from the victory. Outside of the US, an anonymous Dublin syndicate secured ‚Ç¨86 million in 2014 after winning the top EuroMillions prize. In Australia that same year, an Altona Toyota factory syndicate notably won $15m between them, whilst in 2017, a syndicate of six hospital catering staff from Wales shared a ¬£25 million EuroMillions jackpot prize.

Hypericum assamicum is one of two species of Hypericum in the section Hypericum sect. Sampsonia. Description Hypericum assamicum is an erect, perennial or suffruticose (woody at the base) herb tall. The stems are terete with internodes , shorter than or exceeding the leaves. The oblong to oblanceolate leaves are perfoliate, in pairs, thinly papery, up to long and broad, with glaucous undersides and obtuse to rounded tips. The margin of the leaf is entire, or rarely glandular-crenate, with dense, black glands. The leaves have broadly cuneate or rounded leaf bases. The flowerheads produce 12‚Äì18 flowers in corymbiform or subpyramidal branching patterns. Each flower is approximately with 5 sepals, 5 yellowish petals, and approximately 15 stamens. The cylindric to subglobose fruiting capsules reach in length with reddish-brown seeds, each seed long. It flowers and fruits between March and April. Taxonomy Hypericum assamicum was described in 1971 by Samarendra Nath Biswas in Webbia, Journal of Plant Taxonomy and Geography. The type specimen was collected in Nowgong (now Nagaon), Assam, India in July 1848. It was named for its type locality, Assam, India. It is placed in the section Hypericum sect. Sampsonia, along with Hypericum sampsonii, based on the combination of perfoliate leaves and vesicular-glandular capsule valves. Hypericum assamicum is distinguished from H. sampsonii by its leaves that are shortly connate-perfoliate at the base (vs. broadly perfoliate bases), spatulate-oblong unequal sepals (vs. oblong subequal sepals), petals shorter than the sepals (vs. petals as long as the sepals), ovaries with 3-parietal placentas (vs. 3-celled with an axile placenta), and subglobose to oblong capsules with rounded or obtuse apices (vs. ovoid capsules with narrowed to acute apices). The closest population of H. sampsonii to H. assamicum is approximately away. Distribution and habitat Hypericum assamicum is endemic to eastern India. A 1915 collection noted that it was \\"common in jungles\\". It occurs at altitudes up to in riparian areas, open grasslands, roadsides, agricultural fields, and fallow places in the eastern Himalayas.

He was a chief researcher at Arzamas-16, now the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics in the closed city of Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod region. He was a theorist involved with the RDS-37, the first Soviet two-stage thermonuclear bomb and, with Vyacheslav Feodoritov, was the project leader of the RDS-220, the largest-ever-yield bomb, and also its co-designer. Adamsky was sent to Arzamas-16 in 1950 after he graduated from Moscow State University. He knew little of what it was but understood he would be working on the hydrogen bomb; he was put up in a hotel, then a flat and was finally invited to share part of a cottage with Igor Tamm and Yuri Romanov. He found a collegial spirit amongst his workmates, who were very aware of the importance and personal limitations of their situation. His theoretical physics was first practised under the direction of Yakov Zel'dovich and Andrei Sakharov. Theoretical development of the RDS-220 began in July 1961 with a design team chosen by Sakharov (who had met with premier Nikita Khrushchev on 10 July). By October a report (authored by Sakharov, Adamsky, Yuri Babayev, Yuri Smirnov and Yuri Trutnev) including the design proposal and calculations had been completed and sent to the design engineers for construction. Under huge political pressure and a strict timetable, the typical mathematical rigour associated with previous nuclear bomb development had been replaced by some omissions and the usage of estimates and approximations. As a result, fellow theoretical physicist Evsei Rabinovich suggested that the design might not work; Sakharov, Adamsky and Feodoritov argued otherwise, but Sakharov did ask the engineers to make some design changes to improve the level of confidence. Sakharov once visited Adamsky in his office to show him a short story in English by Leo Szilard (the nuclear bomb patent-holder who conceived of nuclear chain reactions) called My Trial as a War Criminal. Szilard's tale of the aftermath of the usage of weapons of mass destruction affected them strongly. Later, both Sakharov and Adamsky provided warnings about the dangers to humanity of nuclear proliferation and the governments behind it. Two years after the RDS-220 test, Adamsky made a key proposal in a memorandum which it is believed was used to overcome an impasse a few months later during negotiations leading to the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty between the U.S.A., the U.K. and the U.S.S.R. in 1963. As a result of Khruschev's acceptance of Adamsky's proposal (it is not known if he actually read it) the ban was agreed upon in the atmosphere, underwater and outer space. Adamsky is buried in Sarov cemetery. Awards * 1962: Lenin Prize.

It was broadcast on Mutual, NBC, and ABC beginning on February 1, 1938, and ending on July 29, 1949. Background In the latter half of the 1930s, leaders of big bands sought ways to differentiate their groups from others who played similar music. Successful variations on the standard format of just playing one song after another could quickly move bands from \\"being merely late-hour fillers\\" without sponsors to having sponsored broadcasts in better time slots. Tommy Dorsey began featuring amateur musicians, Benny Goodman moved his trio and quartet into the spotlight, and Kay Kyser added a quiz component. Some of the changes were less innovation than adaptation. An article in the trade publication Billboard noted that Dorsey's airing of amateurs followed the example of Major Bowes, and Kyser's contest was a variation on the Professor Quiz program. In October 1937, Kyser began including the Kollege as a segment in his Monday night broadcasts from the Blackhawk restaurant in Chicago, Illinois, via radio station WGN. Audience participation in the program occurred in two ways. Listeners were invited to submit questions to Kyser, with selected submissions being used on the program. They also could send in answers to questions posed on the air. One episode in December 1937 resulted in more than 2,000 letters being sent to the program. By mid-January 1938, the number of letters from listeners had exceeded 75,000. Personnel Besides Kyser, the show's personnel included singers Trudy Erwin, Julie Conway, Gloria Wood, Lucy Ann Polk, Mike Douglas, Sully Mason, the King Sisters, Georgia Carroll (Kyser's wife), Harry Babbitt and Ginny Simms. Other regulars were pianist Lyman Gandee, trumpeter Bobby Guy, and Merwyn Bogue (better known as Ish Kabibble). Fran Coughlin was the writer. Announcers were Ken Niles, Bud Hiestand, Vern Smith, Bill Forman, and Jack McCoy. Rex Koury was the organist, and Frank O'Connor was the producer. Directors included Ed Cashman, John Cleary, William Warwick, and Harry Sax. A review in Billboard in 1947 attributed the program's success more to Kyser than to its format. Paul Ackerman wrote: \\"In fact, the Old Professor's most noteworthy characteristic is ebullience. He's got it to a degree that makes other facets of the program secondary.\\" Networks and sponsors=Mutual= On February 1, 1938, Kyser's program gained a sponsor, a network, a new location, and a new title. The American Tobacco Company began sponsoring Kollege, which until then had been a sustaining program. While the program remained on WGN, it was also carried on the Mutual Broadcasting System. At the same time, its site was moved from the Blackhawk to WGN's 600-seat studio. The Chicago Sunday Tribune reported in its January 30, 1938, issue that the show's title would become Kay Kyser's Kampus Klass. Eight members of the studio audience were selected by random drawing to participate in the quizzes in each broadcast. The grand prize was $50, with another $50 going to other contestants. =NBC= The program moved to New York on March 30, 1938, replacing Your Hollywood Parade on NBC. It resumed using the title Kay Kyser's Kollege of Musical Knowledge as it began broadcasting from NBC's Radio City headquarters. Kyser reinforced the theme by wearing a cap and gown during broadcasts. American Tobacco Company continued to sponsor the program until 1945, when a cigarette shortage caused it to cut back on advertising and Colgate-Palmolive became the sponsor. The show's run on NBC ended on June 26, 1948. =ABC= On November 4, 1948, Kollege moved to daytime on ABC. It ran until July 29, 1949, with Pillsbury sponsoring. Television Kyser took the program to television on December 1, 1949, on NBC, where it ran weekly until December 28, 1950. The format was essentially the same as that of the radio program, including Kyser's wearing a cap and gown. Kyser, Douglas, and Kabibble were the only entertainers carried over from the radio version. Other regulars were Liza Palmer, Sue Bennett, Diane Sinclair, and Ken Spaulding. Ben Grauer and Roy Marshall were the announcers. The program returned to TV on July 4, 1954, again on NBC, and ran until September 12, 1954.

The organization was established by Muhammad Zainuddin Abdul Majid at Pancor, East Lombok Regency in 1953. The organization serves as a vehicle for societal movement, education, and Islamic proselytization (da'wah). It is currently the largest and the most influential Islamic mass organization in Lombok. History During the National Awakening era of the early 20th century, Indonesia experienced a rapid expansion of Islamic socio-religious activity, witnessing the creation of two of the most influential Islamic organizations, Muhammadiyah (1912) and Nahdlatul Ulama (1926). While Muhammadiyah was inspired by the modernism imported from the Middle East, Nahdlatul Ulama, oriented toward vernacular and syncretist Islam, was founded to counter the modernist trend. Nahdlatul Ulama had set up multiple branches across the archipelago, including Lombok, in which the branch was headed by the charismatic local saint Muhammad Zainuddin Abdul Majid, also known as Maulana Syeikh.Hamdi & Smith, 2012. Maulana Syeikh was educated in Mecca, and after finishing his study in 1934, he returned to Lombok where he established a pesantren (Islamic boarding school) Al- Mujahidin.Baharuddin & Rasmianto, 2004. Later he renovated the pesantren to an Islamic seminary for male students, Madrasah Nahdlatul Wathan Diniyah Islamiyah (NWDI) in 1937. He also built a seminary for female students, Madrasah Nahdlatul Banat Diniyah Islamiyah (NBDI) in 1943. These two seminaries had witnessed rapid growth and popularity, prompting Maulana to expand their operations to other villages in Lombok.Nu'man, 1999. He then founded the organization Nahdlatul Wathan in Pancor, Selong, East Lombok Regency on March 1st, 1953. Since the establishment, the organization played a major role in the Islamization of Lombok. During the New Order era, Nahdlatul Wathan had cooperated with the ruling party Golkar, albeit the political affiliation was not fixed. During 1965-1975, Nahdlatul Wathan had around 360 madrasahs in operation. In 1997, Nahdlatul Wathan was managing approximately 600 madrasahs, several private universities, and orphanages. With the death of Maulana, fall of Suharto, and the democratic transition, Nadhlatul Wathan had experienced a turbulent era in the late 20th to early 21st century, in which internal strifes had involved almost all the active members. Today, Nahdlatul Wathan operates madrasahs all around the Indonesian archipelago, including Jakarta, Riau, Kalimantan, Sulawesi.Gunawan & Alfanani, 2016.

It has broadly lance-shaped to oval, silvery-hairy leaves with three or four teeth crowded at the tip. It has cylinder-shaped inflorescences that consists of many heads, each containing eleven to thirteen flowers, in the axils of the highest leaves. These leaves form a hood over a lower flowerhead and are flushed orangy pink. It flowers during winter, from early May to September. It is an endemic species that is restricted to the south face of the coastal mountains of the Western Cape province of South Africa.  Description  Mimetes splendidus is an evergreen, rather sparsely branching, upright shrub of up to 2¬Ω m (8 ft) high, which develops from a single trunk of up to 6 cm (2¬Ω in) thick that is covered by a thin, grey bark with a smooth surface except for the horizontal striping. In older specimens, the lower stems have lost their leaves. Young branches are stiffly upright, seldomly branching, silky hairy and 6‚Äì10 mm (0.24‚Äì0.40 in) thick, later tilting over. The leaves are set alternately along the branches, at an upward angle and overlapping. They lack both stipules and leaf stalks, are broadly lance-shaped or elliptic, 4‚Äì5¬Ω cm (1.6‚Äì2.2 in) long and 1¬º‚Äì2¬Ω cm (¬Ω‚Äì1 in) wide, are silvery in colour due to a dense covering of silky hairs, with more or less pointy tips, often with three or four reddish or amber-coloured, thickened teeth closely cropped. The inflorescence is broadly cylinder-shaped, 8‚Äì12 cm (3¬º‚Äì4¬æ in) long and 6‚Äì8 cm (2‚Öì‚Äì3¬º in) in diameter, topped by smallish, more or less flattened, silvery-pink leaves. In the axils of the leaves just below the crest are flower heads each containing ten to fourteen flowers, the subtending leaves with ears at its base, forming a hood over the underlying flower head, that is flushed in a brilliant orangy pink when flowering. The bracts that encircle the flower heads are broadly oval to inverted egg-shaped or tending to rectangular with a blunt tip, a hairless or powdery hairy surface and a fringe of hairs along its margin, papery when dry, warm yellow or amber-coloured when fresh, the margins curving inwards and enveloping the base of the flowers, 1¬º‚Äì1¬æ cm (¬Ω‚Äì‚Öî in) long and ¬æ‚Äì1 cm (0.12‚Äì0.24 in) wide, the inner whorl lance- shaped to narrowly lance-shaped, with a sharply pointy tip, 1¬Ω‚Äì4 cm (‚Öî‚Äì1¬æ in) long and ¬æ‚Äì1 cm (0.28‚Äì0.40 in) wide. The bract subtending the individual flower is line-shaped, 12‚Äì16 mm (0.48‚Äì0.64 in) long, about 2 mm (0.08 in) wide, and densely silky hairy. The 4-merous perianth is 3‚Äì3¬Ω cm (1.2‚Äì1.4 in) long. The lower part, that remains merged when the flower is open, is slightly inflated, hairless, and about 3‚Äì4 mm (0.12‚Äì0.16 in) long. The segments in the middle part (or claws), are thread-shaped and silky hairy. The segments in the upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud, are boat-shaped, line-shaped with a pointy tip in outline, 8‚Äì10 mm (0.32‚Äì0.40 in) long, covered in dense silky hairs, and a tuft of stiff hairs at its tip. From the centre of the perianth emerges the style of 4¬Ω‚Äì5¬Ω cm (1.8‚Äì2.2 in) long, straight and thread-shaped. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is 5‚Äì7 mm (0.2‚Äì0.3 in) long, line-shaped with a pointy tip and a thickened ring at the base. The sigmatic groove sits obliquely across the very tip. The egg-shaped ovary is silky hairy and about 1 mm long (0.04 in). It is subtended by four bright orange, fleshy, awl- to line-shaped scales of about 2 mm (0.08 in) long. The fruit is narrowly oval in shape, 6‚Äì7 mm (0.24‚Äì0.28 in) long and 4‚Äì5 mm (0.16‚Äì0.20 in) in diameter. = Differences with related species = The splendid pagoda is one of a group of with silvery leaves due to a dense covering of silky hairs, the others being M. arboreus, M. argenteus, M. hottentoticus and M. stokoei. From the other species in this group it can be distinguished by its leaves that almost fully consistently have three or four teeth near their tips. In addition, the involucral bracts that surround the individual flower heads are oblong with a rounded tip, nearly hairless on the outer surface, amber-coloured and thin when fresh (papery and brown in herbarium specimens).  Taxonomy  Richard Anthony Salisbury first described the splendid pagoda in 1809 and called it Mimetes splendidus. He did so in a book that contained an extensive revision of the Proteaceae, titled On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, published by Joseph Knight. Salisbury however, reputedly had seen the draft of a paper called On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae that Robert Brown was to publish in 1810. Brown called the species M. hibbertii. In 1816, Jean Louis Marie Poiret, who collapsed several Proteaceae genera, reassigned it an called it Protea hibbertii. John Hutchinson, a South African botanist, described a comparable specimen collected by Zeyher, which he called M. integrus In 1912. The herbarium sheet on which it is based, not only contains a branch of the splendid pagoda, but also of the silver pagoda (M. argenteus), and has caused considerable confusion. Finally, Christian Friedrich Ecklon described a further specimen, naming it M. mundii. In 1984, John Patrick Rourke considered all of these specimens representatives of the same species, rendering all other names synonyms of M. splendidus.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  The splendid pagoda is an uncommon species that mostly occurs as single individuals or small groups. It has a rather large distribution, which naturally occurs from the Clock Peaks in the westend of the Langeberg near Swellendam in the west, via the Outinqua to Rondebos in the Tsitsikamma National Park in the east, a narrow, 300 km long strip. It is restricted to sloping terrain with a southern or southeastern exposure and a consistently high water availability. It grows on moist, aciduous, peaty soils always above 600 m (2000 ft) and mostly 1000‚Äì1200 m (3250‚Äì4000 ft) in a dense fynbos vegetation of mostly over 2 m (7 ft) high. Plants usually live for about twenty years. Flowering occurs during winter until September, peaking in May and June. The fruits are usually shed in January and February. As usual for pagodas, the flowers are pollinated by birds. And the fruits are gathered by native ants that carry them to their underground nests. Here the seeds remain dormant until the overhead vegetation is removed by an overhead fire and the seeds germinate in response to increased daily temperature fluctuations and washed-down charcoal chemicals. Plants of this species do not survive such fires.  Conservation  The splendid pagoda is considered an endangered species due to its declining population size, its small subpopulation, and its threats of competition by invasive species, afforestation and too frequent fires.

The plant would employ up to 13,000 workers and the company would receive subsidies ranging from $3 billion to $4.8 billion (paid in increments if Foxconn met certain targets). The factory was to start production by the end of 2020, but only minor construction has occurred. The plant was heavily touted by Governor Scott Walker and Republicans in Wisconsin and President Donald Trump praised the plant at the groundbreaking ceremony. Numerous economists expressed skepticism that the benefits to Wisconsin would exceed the costs of the deal for Wisconsin's taxpayers. The amount would have been by far the largest tax incentive deal ever given to a foreign firm in U.S. history. Environmentalists criticized the deal for exempting the factory from Wisconsin's environmental rules. History Foxconn groundbreaking with Governor Walker, President Trump, CEO Gou and House Speaker Paul Ryan The possible construction of a $7 billion factory in the United States that would employ as many as 50,000 people was discussed with reporters by Terry Gou, Foxconn founder and CEO, on January 22, 2017. He had earlier told Masayoshi Son, head of SoftBank Group Corp., that the U.S. has no panel-making industry but it is the second-largest market for televisions. In 2018, the Scott Walker administration in Wisconsin approved an agreement with the Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn to build a plant in Racine County. Foxconn sought to locate a plant in the Great Lakes region, because it needed access to large amounts of water. The other Great Lakes states were not willing to offer as generous subsidies as Wisconsin. As part of the agreement, Foxconn was set to receive subsidies ranging from $3 billion to $4.8 billion (paid in increments if Foxconn met certain targets), which had it been paid out would have been by far the largest subsidy ever given to a foreign firm in U.S. history. Foxconn said in return that it would set up a $10 billion factory that initially employed 3,000 (set to increase to 13,000 by as early as 2022). Numerous economists expressed skepticism that the benefits would exceed the costs of the deal. Wisconsin‚Äôs nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimated that the Foxconn plant investment would not break even until 2043, and that was in the best-case scenario. Others noted that Foxconn had in the past made similar claims about job creation in various localities which did not turn out to be true. Initially, the subsidies were set at $3 billion, which would have cost the state $231,000 per job created (under the assumption of 13,000 jobs). The cost of the subsidies were higher than yearly state funding for the University of Wisconsin system and the state prisons. Other estimates of the subsidies go as high as $4.8 billion, which meant that the cost of the subsidy per job (assuming 13,000 jobs) was more than $346,000. Depending on how many jobs were created, the cost per job would have gone as high as more than a million dollars. This contrasts to an average subsidy in the US of around $24,000 per job. Walker exempted the firm from Wisconsin's environmental rules regarding wetlands and streams. Walker and the Trump administration rolled back air pollution limits in the area of the plant, overruling objections of Environmental Protection Agency staff. The plant was estimated to contribute significantly to air pollution in the region. Environmentalists criticized the decision to allow Foxconn to draw of water per day from Lake Michigan. The roughly of land necessary for the Foxconn campus was in part made possible by forcing homeowners to sell at a fixed price under the threat of seizing the land under eminent domain. In 2018, the Walker administration shifted up to $90 million in local road funding to road work related to the Foxconn factory. The Wisconsin state legislature granted Foxconn special legal privileges within the Wisconsin judicial system. In June 2018, President Trump praised the plant, describing it as \\"the Eighth Wonder of the World\\" at the groundbreaking. At the end of 2018, Foxconn did not qualify for $10 million in subsidies, as it created only 156 of the 260 jobs required under the agreement. In 2019, an audit found only employed 113 full-time workers of the 189 workers claimed met the criteria in the contract. In 2020, the WEDC determined Foxconn would not receive tax credits for work done in 2019, saying it hired only 281 tax-eligible employees, did not carry out the Gen 10.5 LCD project, and only made $300 million in capital expenditures. In January 2019, Foxconn said it was reconsidering its initial plans to manufacture LCD screens at the Wisconsin plant, citing high labor costs in the United States, and that it would hire mostly engineers and researchers, rather than manufacturing workforce. In February 2019, Bloomberg News reported that the plant was \\"unlikely to ever employ 13,000 workers.\\" In an interview in July 2019, Governor Tony Evers said that Foxconn told him the factory would open by May 2020, but would employ only 1,500 workers. In January 2020, construction work on some buildings was continuing, and Foxconn's founder Terry Gou insisted the factory would be operational within 2020. In April 2020, Foxconn announced plans to make respirators in partnership with Medtronic at the Wisconsin Foxconn plant in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Around the same time, Foxconn also began assembling procedural masks in Mount Pleasant under the Sharp brand.

Career  Born on 7 February 1860, Arthur Theodore Thring was the third son of Theodore Thring, a \\"country gentleman\\", the deputy chairman of the Somerset Quarter Sessions and a Commissioner of Bankruptcy, and his wife Julia Jane, n√©e Mills. His uncles included the First Parliamentary Counsel Lord Thring, the schoolmaster Rev. Edward Thring and the hymn-writer Rev. Godfrey Thring. Arthur attended Winchester College from 1872 and bowled for the school cricket team when it beat Eton College in 1878. The following year, he matriculated at New College, Oxford, as a scholar. He secured a second-class degree in classics in 1883.\\"Sir Arthur Turing\\", The Times (London), 18 April 1932, p. 17.\\"Thring, Sir Arthur (Theodore)\\", Who Was Who (online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007).

Thring was called to the bar in 1887 and practised at parliamentary committees and government inquiries. He was appointed Second Parliamentary Counsel in 1902 and the following year became First Parliamentary Counsel, in which office he was responsible for drafting legislation relating to the People's Budget (1909), the National Insurance Act 1911, the Parliament Act 1911, the Representation of the People Act 1918 and many wartime bills. According to Sir Harold Kent, Lord Simon said of Thring: \\"Such a capable fellow, very hard-working, full of common sense ... The only trouble was, he couldn't draft!\\"Taken from Kent's memoirs In on the Act: Memoirs of a Lawmaker (Macmillan, 1979), and quoted in a review of that work by A. G. D. (Statute Law Review, vol. 1, no. 3 (1980), p. 187). The Times was more sympathetic, recalling that \\"If as a draftsman Thring will not be placed in the same rank as his famous uncle, Lord Thring, Ilbert, or Chalmers, his reputation, in times more difficult than theirs, stood the test of legal interpretation\\". In 1917, he became Clerk of the Parliaments, serving until retirement in 1930. He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath in the November 1902 Birthday Honours list, and promoted to Knight Commander (KCB) six years later. A Deputy Lieutenant of Somerset, Thring was also Deputy Chairman of the county's Quarter Sessions. He enjoyed shooting and spent parliamentary vacations at Charlton Mackrell.

Origins The MML has its roots in the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) Increment 2-Intercept program which also included the development of the Miniature Hit-to-Kill Missile. The system is intended to close gaps in the Army's cruise missile, short range air defense (SHORAD) and Counter Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) defenses. Development The MML was developed by the Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC). Unusually, AMRDEC served as the prime contractor instead of a private defense contractor; this lowers R&D; costs as well as allowing the Army full ownership of the weapon system's source code and intellectual property which significantly lowers sustainment cost. The MML is the first major development program successfully undertaken by the government industrial base in more than 30 years. The Miniature Hit-to- Kill Missile was developed by Lockheed Martin specifically for the MML. Intended to fill the C-RAM role this approximately 2.5 foot and 5 pound missile fits four to a MML pod. Multiple missiles have been integrated and tested with the system. In 2016 FIM-92 Stinger missiles were launched from a single tube MML at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. AIM-9X Sidewinder and AGM-114 Hellfire missiles launched from a FMTV mounted 15 tube MML were tested at the Army's White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. In April 2016, also at White Sands and using the FMTV mounted MML, the Army evaluated the Tamir missile. The Tamir missile serves as the interceptor in the Israeli/American Iron Dome System. By March 2019, the IFPC requirement had been scaled back to focus on cruise missile threats, while C-UAS and C-RAM defense would be handled by other systems; attempting to combine all missions into one system resulted in technical challenges with the payloads and reloading procedures. This allowed the MML to be made larger to accommodate bigger or more missiles. The IFPC will be part of a layered air and missile defense system, with a battery of MMLs attached to each MSHORAD and Patriot missile battalion to handle higher- or lower-end threats.Army Reboots Cruise Missile Defense: IFPC & Iron Dome. Breaking Defense. 11 March 2019. AMRDEC and CMDS will deliver eight MML systems by the end of 2019. Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2-Intercept=Weapon System= Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2-Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) is a mobile ground based multi-role weapons system built around the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System with an AN/MPQ-64 Sentinel acting as the prime sensor and truck mounted MML systems as shooters. The acronym IFPC is pronounced \\"if pick.\\" The Army intends to integrate a 100-kilowatt laser weapon with the system, they awarded a $130m development contract to a joint Dynetics and Lockheed Martin team. Like the MML the system will be integrated with the FMTV. The Army intends to test a full (including laser) IFPC system in 2022. In 2019 the Army announced their intent to field a high powered microwave weapon as part of IFPC by 2024 with a demonstration in 2022. =FMTV mounted Multi-Mission Launcher= The MML is currently planned to be fielded carried aboard a Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles truck, each FMTV carries fifteen MML tubes organized into three five tube clips. The launcher is highly maneuverable with 360 degrees of rotation and a full 90 degrees of elevation. Each FMTV pulls a standard trailer with a tactical missile data link and a standard 60kW generator.

She first became known through concerts, which allowed her to interpret the modern music that interested her most. She died in Saint- Martin-d'H√®res on 17 February 1973 at age 84.  Ariane  In 1921, at the Op√©ra-Comique, for her first appearance on stage, Balguerie played Ariane in Dukas' Ariane et Barbe-Bleue. Her performance won praise from Gabriel Faur√© who said : \\"I don't think there is a more important role for the theatre, both in terms of its proportions and in terms of all the qualities it demands. Mrs. Balguerie emerged from the ordeal triumphantly.

In 1936, Balguerie premiered two of the Po√®mes pour Mi by Messiaen. \\"She did it with extraordinary vocal power and dramatic intensity\\", wrote the composer, who was at the piano.\\"Hommage √† Suzanne Balguerie, Grenoble, 1968.

She also performed as Marguerite in a series of Faust. In 1944, at Bordeaux, she premiered Richard Strauss' Die √§gyptische Helena in France.  Concerts  Balguerie's concert activity far exceeded her operatic performances. She performed frequently with leading French orchestras, also in Switzerland, very regularly, with Ernest Ansermet. At recitals, she performed cycles such as Faur√©'s La Bonne Chanson, and also classical and contemporary melodies. She gave a series of concerts with Francis Poulenc and Pierre Bernac. The choice of this repertoire was controversial. At the performance of Darius Milhaud's La Brebis √©gar√©e in 1923: \\"The police intervened and stopped the music. Wolff yelled at the audience\\", wrote the composer to his friend Francis Poulenc. Under the occupation by Nazi Germany, engagements were scarce; she found herself in poverty when she retired in 1950. In 1953, she was appointed professor at the Conservatoire de Grenoble and at Geneva.  Her personality The singer Madeleine Grey said: \\"There was one I loved most of all, Suzanne Balguerie. We cannot forget the way she sang Ariane, by Dukas. She was by no means jealous. She wanted me to replace her when she was unavailable. She was a first-class artist. I was absolutely dazzled. She had everything, this woman. First she was a great, great artist. But she was one of those who have a hobby. She was a painter. Her paintings, it seems, were very beautiful. So she was not one of those singers who threw herself on their singing, with the ambition of being the greatest. That's probably why she didn't have an international career. It's a pity.G√©rard Zwang, M√©moires d'une chanteuse fran√ßaise. La vie et les amours de Madeleine Grey (1896-1979), L'Harmattan, Paris, 2008.\\" .  Discography  For the Polydor label, Balguerie recorded excerpts from Iphig√©nie en Tauride, Alceste, Tannh√§user, The Flying Dutchman, A√Øda, Sigurd, Faust and Fid√©lio. For Columbia, excerpts from Alceste and Ariane et Barbe Bleue, as well as Le Po√®me de la maison (1918), a cantata by Georges-Martin Witkowski.

Based on the book of the same name by Lois Lowry, the film's screenplay was written by Pearn and Mark Stanleigh, and stars the voices of Will Forte, Maya Rudolph, Alessia Cara, Terry Crews, Martin Short, Jane Krakowski, Se√°n Cullen, and Ricky Gervais, who also narrates the film. The Willoughbys was released on Netflix on April 22, 2020.  Plot  A stray cat narrates the story of the Willoughbys, once an adventurous and loving family for generations. The present-day Mr. and Mrs. Willoughby are too enamored with each other to care for their four children: eldest son Tim, who tries to keep his siblings out of trouble; middle daughter Jane, whose beautiful singing is silenced by her parents; and the inventive but ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù twin boys, both named Barnaby. The parents mistreat and neglect the children, refusing to give them food and punishing them by making them sleep in the coal bin. After Jane and the twins find a baby abandoned outside, their parents kicked them out of the house until they return without the child. They leave the baby, whom Tim names ‚ÄúRuth‚Äù, on the doorstep of a candy factory and the owner, Commander Melanoff, takes her in. To rid themselves of their neglectful parents, the siblings send them on a ‚Äúdangerous vacation‚Äù by fabricating a travel brochure of volcanoes, bears, and other hazards. As the children celebrate their freedom, a nanny hired by their parents arrives and wins over everyone but Tim. Learning about Ruth, Nanny takes the children to Melanoff's factory. After saving Ruth from the assembly line, Nanny realizes the child is safe with the loving Melanoff. Mr. and Mrs. Willoughby, having survived the various danger, not wanting to go back to their children but short on funds to continue their trip, sell their house online. They also inform Nanny in a voicemail, which Tim overhears. Believing Nanny is in league with his parents, Tim reports her as a ‚Äúbad nanny‚Äù to the sinister Orphan Services. When their parents‚Äô realtor arranges an open house, the siblings scare off potential buyers with a series of traps. Nanny frightens away one last family, convincing Tim that she means well, but Orphan Services arrives. The head agent recognizes Nanny as Linda, an orphan who never found a family who wanted her. Learning that Tim called Orphan Services, Linda leaves and Jane angrily chastises Tim before the siblings are separated and taken to foster homes. Tim keeps running away from his foster families, discovering in the process that the Willoughby mansion has been sold and demolished, and is eventually confined at the Orphan Services center. The cat finds Linda and brings her Tim's signature helmet, convincing her to reunite the children. Linda breaks Tim out of Orphan Services and collects the siblings, and Tim apologizes to Jane. He suggests that they find their parents in order for Orphan Services to leave them alone. Linda and the siblings enlist Melanoff‚Äôs help to construct a candy-fueled dirigible to travel to \\"Sveetzerl√ºnd\\" (a parody of Switzerland), where their parents are scaling the ‚Äúunclimbable Alps‚Äù. Taking flight without Linda, Melanoff, and Ruth, the siblings reach Sveetzerl√ºnd. They follow a trail of their mother‚Äôs yarn to the top of the mountain, where they find their parents nearly frozen to death. The siblings save them, confessing that they sent them away but hoping to reunite as a family. Unchanged, Mr. and Mrs. Willoughby abandon their children and take the dirigible, but cause it to fly out of control and crash. The siblings prepare to succumb to the cold as Jane sings, but they are rescued by Ruth, Linda, and Melanoff. Linda and Melanoff adopt Ruth and the Willoughby children, all living at the candy factory as a loving family. Meanwhile, Mr. and Mrs. Willoughby survived the dirigible crash, floating at sea, and are presumably devoured by a shark. In a post-credits scene, the cat cleans himself until noticing the audience.  Voice cast  * Will Forte as Tim Willoughby, the rational eldest child of the Willoughbys. * Maya Rudolph as Linda a.k.a. The Nanny, an eccentric babysitter who must look after the kids.

Gilbert and Luke Carroll producing. In April 2017, Ricky Gervais was cast in the film to lead the voice, and it was reported that Pearn would co-direct the film with Cory Evans. Moments later, Cory Evans was replaced by Rob Lodermeier as co-director while Evans did do the film as a concept artist and a pre-production co-director. The screenplay however was replaced by Pearn and Mark Stanleigh with a story by Pearn who also executive produced the film. In June 2017, more were cast to the film, included Terry Crews, Maya Rudolph, Martin Short, Jane Krakowski, and Se√°n Cullen. Will Forte and Alessia Cara (in her first animated role) also provided their voices, with Netflix now set to distribute the film. As of November 2018, the film was still in-production at the Bron Animation studio in Burnaby, British Columbia. The characters in the film were designed by character designer Craig Kellman who designed the characters for DreamWorks Animation‚Äôs Madagascar and Sony Pictures Animation‚Äôs Hotel Transylvania as well as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer‚Äôs The Addams Family. Soundtrack The music in the film was composed and conducted by Mark Mothersbaugh, who previously worked with Pearn on Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2. The original song \\"I Choose\\" (performed by Alessia Cara, who plays the voice of Jane in the film) was released independently by Def Jam Recordings. = Score = Release The film was digitally released on April 22, 2020 by Netflix. It was viewed at least in-part by 37 million households over its first month of release.  Reception  On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 90% based on 63 reviews, with an average rating of 6.83/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"An appealing animated adventure whose silliness is anchored in genuine emotion, The Willoughbys offers fanciful fun the entire family can enjoy.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Renee Schonfeld of Common Sense Media, gave the film four stars out of five, saying the film is a \\"wonderfully whimsical tale with dark themes is softened by warmth, humor, and stellar performances by talented comic actors who brighten the already inventive and luminous animation.\\" The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney said that \\"the Netflix animated family comedy- adventure has an oddball charm that works surprisingly well.\\" Natalia Winkelman of The New York Times said that \\"is charming on a moment-to-moment basis. Running gags, like how Tim triggers a car pileup whenever he crosses the street, help to round out an unruly world. The composer Mark Mothersbaugh contributes a jazzy score and original song (performed by Cara) that punctuate the giddy mood. Though it tends to feel disjointed as a whole, ‚ÄúThe Willoughbys‚Äù thrives when it embraces its grim plot and lets mischief reign.\\"  References  External links  * American films Canadian films American computer-animated films Canadian animated feature films Canadian black comedy films 2020 black comedy films 2020 computer-animated films 2020 films Animated films based on novels Bron Studios films Netflix Animation films American black comedy films Films scored by Mark Mothersbaugh ","title":"The Willoughbys"},{"id":"58984796","text":"Paul Davis (born 1964) is the former pitching coach for the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball (MLB); he served in that role during the 2019 season, before being reassigned as Chief Pitching Strategist in October 2019.

This episode is the first not to have Andrew Lincoln credited in the main cast billing as Rick Grimes and the first not to have Lauren Cohan (Maggie Greene) credited since season 2. This episode marks the first appearance of The Whisperers, a prominent antagonistic group featured in the comics following the defeat of Negan and the Saviors. Plot Michonne narrates over scenes of the survivors continuing to rebuild their various communities and struggling to survive, six years after Rick Grimes' apparent death. Judith leads Magna's group to Aaron, Eugene, Laura and Rosita, who are hesitant about protecting them, but Judith insists. They travel to Alexandria, just as Michonne returns from a scavenging run. Michonne sizes them up and knows that Judith did not follow the proper procedure for bringing new survivors in, but agrees to let them stay overnight and to hear their case the following morning in front of their council which includes former high-ranking Savior Laura, now a trusted member of the community. There, the council asks them questions similar to what Rick would ask of potential allies. While the other council members seem accepting of their answers, Michonne sees that Magna has a prison tattoo and demands she explain herself. She cannot do so, and the council votes to have them evicted from the community after Yumiko is treated. Judith, who has developed a rapport with the imprisoned Negan, is upset at Michonne for not trusting her. Michonne mulls over her decision as she tends to her and Rick's child, Rick Jr. (RJ). As the others are about to evict the group, Michonne has a change of heart and says they likely will be able to stay over at Hilltop, and will escort them personally there along with Siddiq and former Savior D.J. to watch over Yumiko's recovery. At the Kingdom, Ezekiel recognizes the needs to have a trained blacksmith to help effect repairs, and decides to have Henry travel to Hilltop to be apprenticed in the art. Carol brings Henry along with a number of supplies she plans to bring to the Hilltop too. En route, they are attacked by the remains of the Saviors, aside from those who joined the other communities, led by Carol's old enemy Jed and former Savior lieutenant Regina. Jed reveals that the Sanctuary has fallen and the remaining Saviors have become marauders to survive. They steal the supplies, among them the ring that Ezekiel gave to Carol, and promise they will never see them again. That night, after setting up camp, Carol sneaks out to find the Saviors camp, douses the area in gasoline, and sets them ablaze, killing them while recovering her ring. They continue on the next day, rendezvousing with Daryl who has taken to living on his own. Rosita and Eugene go to take some radio equipment to set up on a nearby water tower for Father Gabriel who has formed a bond of love with Rosita, he is trying to see if any other communities can make contact. They note that a large herd had passed, but believe it will not interfere with their goal. As Eugene places the radio equipment, he spots the horde now aiming for them. He spooks their horses as he tries to climb down, and Rosita rushes to recover essential gear from their wagon. Eugene is forced to jump the last bit off the tower and injures his leg, and after Rosita gets him a shovel as a makeshift crutch, the two escape. The horde surprisingly stays on their tail, and only until they find a wet ditch and cover themselves in mud does the horde seem to ignore their presence. They hear faint whispers of \\"Where are they?\\" and \\"They must be close, don't let them get away\\" as the horde passes, much to their horror.  Production  From this episode, Norman Reedus (Daryl Dixon) becomes the main protagonist of the series. This is the first episode broadcast following the departure of Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes, which included a six-year time jump from the events of his apparent death. Among changes include Khary Payton (King Ezekiel) being promoted to the main cast as his name appears in the opening credits. This episode introduces Matt Lintz as the older Henry; Matt is the older brother of Macsen Lintz who had played Henry in previous seasons, and brother to Madison Lintz, who had played Carol's daughter Sophia on the first two seasons of the show. This is the first episode to fully introduce the Whisperers, which in the comics are a group of human survivors that wear the skin of walkers to mask themselves, and speak only in whispers to avoid drawing the walkers' attention. Within the comics, Rick's son, Carl Grimes, was an essential element to that arc, but within the show, Carl (played by Chandler Riggs) had been killed off in the middle of the eighth season. According to showrunner Angela Kang, to adapt the comic's story, they plan on taking some of the role that Carl had and giving them to Judith, now aged similarly to Carl, which allows them to follow the main threads of the comic's Whisperer arc but with a new take using Judith's personality. Reception=Critical reception= \\"Who Are You Now?\\" received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has an approval rating of 83% with an average score of 6.92 out of 10, based on 16 reviews. The critical consensus reads: \\"Who Are You Now?\\" swiftly establishes a new world order in The Walking Dead without Rick Grimes, effectively conveying the progression of the survivors, but some viewers may feel adrift in what feels like the umpteenth re-set for the series. Erik Kain of Forbes praised the episode and the reboot of the series, saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still shocked by how good ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Walking Dead‚Äô‚Äô has gotten, and while I was worried before (and still have some doubts) I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to suffer too much without Rick. His ‚Äúdeath‚Äù serves as an interesting catalyst for character growth throughout the community, as they no longer have the luxury of one leader calling all the shots.‚Äù =Ratings= \\"Who Are You Now?\\" received a total viewership of 5.40 million with a 2.0 rating in adults aged 18‚Äì49.

Often conflated with microgrids, a mini-grid is sometimes defined as having a power rating less than 11kW and as being disconnected from utility-scale grids. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) defines a mini-grid with a power rating below 15MW and disconnected from larger electric grids. Mini-grids are used as a cost- effective solution for electrifying rural communities where a grid connection is challenging in terms of transmission and cost for the end user population density.  Background = Motivation for mini-grid development = The electric grids of many developed, high-income countries once started out as mini-grids. These isolated electrical systems were then connected and integrated into a larger grid. Today, issues such as energy security, energy access, and depleting energy resources remain key issues worldwide. Mini-grids are functional at small scale and as potential future connections to a larger grid, making this technology attractive for ensuring the reliability of future energy systems. In many areas, centralized power is not feasible due to relatively small dispersed loads in remote areas, but a mini-grid provides an attractive alternative with enhanced stability when compared to stand-alone systems. Furthermore, transmission remains an issue for geographically isolated areas, making off-grid alternatives necessary in certain situations. Considering the large distances transmission lines must cover to reach rural areas from centralized generation, up to 30% of power can be lost before reaching the destination, significantly decreasing the efficiency of the overall electrical system. As such, localized mini-grids with on-site generation provide a reasonable alternative. = Rural Electrification = Electricity consumption per country in million kWh, from CIA Factbook, accessed April 2006 Many rural communities remain isolated from larger, traditional grids due to geographic and economic constraints. The electrification of the global off-grid rural population remains a major task of many developing and developed countries, and according to the International Energy Agency in the 2013 World Energy Outlook, mini-grids represent the most cost-effective way to provide universal electricity access to these populations. Due to new technology innovations that have resulted in declining costs both for mini-grids and energy generation sources, specifically solar and wind power, mini-grids have the potential to electrify remote areas that would otherwise remain outside of a grid connection. Mini-grids are a cost- effective and timely solution for more isolated areas in which connection to the main electric grid is unavailable, and represent a practical option for meeting the energy demand in Sub‚ÄêSaharan Africa, South and East Asia, and Small Island Developing States. Millions of people remain without access to electricity today, and the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals commit the global community to provide a solution. The map on the right demonstrates energy disparity between developed countries such as the US, China, and Europe while South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia still have many communities that lack reliable, sustainable, affordable energy. Mini-grids are currently being viewed as one of the most effective solutions to bringing energy to rural populations where the energy demands are such that individual stand- alone systems such as nano-grids are impractical but where the population is large enough to require a larger grid system. Because a grid must balance the supply of energy with the demand, the mini-grid's larger size and flexibility allows for safer and more affordable power.  Technical Components = Generation = A vital component of a mini-grid electric system is on-site, reliable source of energy generation. Traditional mini-grid generation for remote areas came from diesel engine alternators, which incurred high running costs, low efficiency and high maintenance. To obtain the reliability of a fossil fuel powered grid with greater sustainability, hybrid energy systems can be used to integrate renewable energy technologies with diesel generators, batteries, and inverters. The main concern with generation is the fluctuation in load demand that imposes varied power requirements from the generation system. These fluctuations can vary throughout a single day, from day to day, or even on the scale of weeks to months, which necessitates flexible mini-grid generation. In the case of limited power generation without a source of energy storage, peak loads can demand more power than the mini-grid generation is capable of supplying, which results in brownouts or blackouts. = Energy Sources = There exist a variety of energy sources to provide on-side power to a mini-grid system. Recent developments to renewables provide a lucrative option due to the low cost and sustainable economic and environmental nature. As an example, the energy cost of solar PV decreased from $4/W to $0.55‚Äì$0.65/W between 2007 and 2016. Hybrid power system combining wind, solar PV, and conventional diesel generation with energy storage.  Common sources of mini-grid generation  * Solar photovoltaic * Wind power * Hydropower * Biomass * Traditional fuel generators * Hybrid systems = Energy Storage = Because of the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, generators, fuel cells, or batteries are required to ensure the reliability of Mini-grid Renewable Energy Systems (MRES). Otherwise, communities relying on real-time generation experience power outages when renewable generation is not possible. Due to fluctuation in load demand, the energy storage system must be able to meet the peak demand, which can entail large and expensive battery or fuel cell systems. To balance cost with sustainability, energy storage can be combined with diesel power and introduced to a mini-grid in a series or switched hybrid system. = Hybrid System = Hybrid mini-grid systems are a popular option to ensure mini-grid reliability, especially when considering renewable energy sources. A hybrid mini-grid is identified by diversified Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), where the energy generation comes from a variety of sources such as solar PV, micro-hydro power plants, wind turbines, biomass, and small conventional generators. Series hybrid systems have both a renewable energy source and a diesel generator which are used in conjunction to maintain the charge of a battery bank, which is then converted to AC and fed to the load. This system allows for simple implementation, but has low efficiency and requires large battery capacity. In contrast, switched hybrid systems enable renewable energy plus storage to supply the baseload power supply while the diesel generator helps meet peak energy demand. = Distribution = A mini-grid distribution system carries the energy produced by the generation source to the end users. It consists of transmission lines, transformers, and the infrastructure necessary to enable safe and effective energy distribution. Depending on the load requirements, a distribution system can be in AC or DC single or three phase power. AC has many benefits, as it allows for effective electricity transmission over distances, meets the requirements for consumer appliances, and is more widely used. However, AC also requires transformers to decrease high voltage distribution network costs and decrease system loss, but is also generally more expensive than DC because of the enhanced power electronics. The Union Power Minister, Shri Sushil Kumar Shinde speaking at the commissioning of Smart Mini-Grid Project, at Gual Pahari, Dist. Gurgaon, Haryana on July 01, 2011. = Smart Mini-grid = A Smart Mini-Grid (SMG) is an intelligent electricity distribution network that manages the various technical components of a mini-grid system. Often coupled with hybrid power generation, the smart mini-grid operates using smart controllers and advanced control techniques, accommodating various energy sources, energy storage, and distribution. The smart mini-grid relies on a management system which allows for the measurement, monitoring, and control of electric loads and can be coupled with automation to allow for remote operation, smart metering, load shedding, and optimized performance. Another key component is self healing, or the ability for the smart mini-grid to detect, respond, and restore itself immediately in case of disturbances or changes to the system.  Benefits  There are many potential benefits of mini-grids ranging from technical and environmental to social and financial advantages. Mini-grids can be used in rural areas and are often more efficient and cost-effective than other types of power systems. They can also strengthen the community while having less impact on the environment. = Technical Benefits = The technology used in mini-grids provides various benefits. Mini-grids are relatively quick and easy to implement in areas without electricity. They can also be used to improve existing electrical grids that are ineffective or unreliable by providing additional power or by replacing them completely. Mini-grids are also more efficient because they can provide a low load at night when less electricity is needed. Unlike conventional energy generation, mini-grids reduce the energy lost at night time when less energy is required by the community. Larger electrical systems such as diesel generators cannot offer this because they are inefficient at low loads and most often continue operating at higher loads regardless of the amount of electricity needed. The use of mini-grids also decreases the amount of time the generators are run at low loads thereby increasing efficiency of the entire system. An additional benefit mini-grids provide is that they do no require a traditional fuel source as many larger scale electric grids do. This means they can be easily implemented in areas without access to diesel or other fossil fuels. This reduces operating costs and reliance on often fluctuating fuel prices. Mini-grids also require less maintenance than larger electrical grids. Since they reduce the hours that diesel generators are used at low loads, generators last longer and do not need to be replaced as often. Because of the rural areas where mini-grids are typically used, there is often little access to supplies or technicians if system maintenance is needed. = Financial Benefits = Other than the reduced cost of fuel, mini-grids offer other financial advantages. Mini-grids can be run by a combination of energy sources, which means they have a lower levelized cost of electricity. Mini- grids are also able to spread electrical storage across many users which reduces the cost when compared to off-grid or solar home systems where electrical storage is concentrated in one area. Mini-grids are also more profitable than other types of electric grids. Due to their improved electrical services and decreased malfunctions such as blackouts, customers are more satisfied overall, and thus willing to pay for the services mini- grids provide, leading to an increase in revenue. Solar panels are often used in mini-grids to reduce the need for diesel generators. = Environmental Benefits = Mini-grids are much more environmentally friendly than other types of grids. Since they reduce the need for diesel generators, greenhouse gas emissions are greatly reduced. This also improves air and noise pollution in the areas mini-grids are used. = Social Benefits = In addition to their technical and economic advantages, mini-grids also benefit the people and communities they serve. In order for many businesses and organizations to function, they must have working and efficient electricity. Mini-grids provide the necessary services for businesses to succeed in developing areas. This leads to the creation of more jobs and an increase in income for the community. Improved electricity can also benefit healthcare technology and institutions in the areas and lead to a higher standard of living. The electricity mini-grids provide also allows for more opportunities for social gatherings and events which strengthen the community. Improved electricity also creates the opportunity to construct more buildings and expand the community.  Risks  Although mini-grids have many benefits, there are also some drawbacks. There are some risks associated with their technology and organization as well as risks to the community they are implemented in. = Technical Risks = One of the main technical risks associated with mini-grids is the load uncertainty. It is often difficult to estimate the load size, growth, and schedule which can lead to the system running with lower efficiency and higher cost. It is also difficult to support loads that are constantly changing over time, as they typically are when using mini-grids. There is also a risk to power quality when using mini-grids. Integrating photovoltaic devices and batteries can be disruptive to the existing grid and can cause it to become unstable. Another technical drawback of using mini- grids is that failure of hardware in one part of the grid could effect the entire system. If one section if the grid is damaged, the rest of the grid could fail as well. This is a risk that exists with any type of grid, however the regions where mini-grids are typically used are poor rural areas with less access to maintenance services so the effects are exacerbated. While helpful for energy storage, the batteries used in mini-grids also have risks of their own. They are usually expensive and as they age they have a large influence on the energy that is supplied to the grid. If the batteries are not replaced at the correct time, the energy provided by the whole grid could be decreased. Most areas where mini-grids are used are rural and have little access to supplies. = Organizational Risks = Because of their complex nature, there are a few organizational risks associated with using mini-grids. In order to be effective, mini-grids must have effective business models to support their operations. There needs to be a steady flow of revenue to keep the business up and running and in order to keep providing customers with electricity. Due to the remote and underdeveloped locations where mini-grids are typically implemented, it is difficult to transport supplies and skilled personnel to the areas they are needed. It is especially difficult when installing the system and when repairs are needed. = Social Risks = Implementing a mini- grid into a community takes meticulous planning and cooperation between the people living in the area as well as the technicians installing the devices. There also needs to be communication among the community with regards to allotted energy quotas. Each user is typically assigned an energy quota to be used over a certain amount of time. If some users over-consume the electricity, this leaves a deficit for the other users and could disrupt the entire system. The community must work in cooperation in order for the mini- grid to work successfully.  Economics  Mini-grids provide communities with a reliable source of energy as well as many benefits to their economy. It is often too expensive for government electrical companies to attempt to bring electricity to undeveloped areas, and there is less potential for profit in these areas with poor economies. Since mini-grids can operate separately from the larger national grids, private companies can implement them and provide rural communities with electricity more quickly than state-owned companies. In terms of market size, the consulting company Infinergia estimates that there around 2 000 solar mini-grids installed in Africa in 2018, expecting them to reach 16 000 by 2023. Likewise, the analyst estimates 5 000 of them in Asia in 2018, expecting them to reach 15 000 by 2023. = Case Study = A case study performed in the Leh District of India demonstrates the effects of mini-grids on the economy. Since the operational costs of mini-grids are less than those of diesel and hydro generators, the companies that run them are able to bring in more revenue. This increase in revenue means the companies can increase the salaries of their workers. In turn, the workers are able to spend more in the local businesses and the economy is allowed to grow. Furthermore, mini-grids provide opportunities for the local economy to grow and improve. Businesses can provide more and better services with improved electricity and expand their organizations.

The organization was established by the charismatic Muslim leader Munzir Al- Musawa in 1998. Majelis Rasulullah is known for organizing dhikr events with many attendees, typically tens of thousands to sometimes hundreds of thousands. It is currently the largest dhikr organization in Jakarta. History Munzir Al-Musawa studied under the Yemeni Sufi scholar Umar bin Hafiz, and he returned afterward to Jakarta to begin the da'wah (Islamic proselytizing) in 1998. He then began holding the majelis (religious gathering) every Monday night, in the same style Umar bin Hafiz was conducting in Yemen. During the first months, he invited people door to door to teach about Islam. The majelis was soon named Majelis Rasulullah which means \\"majelis of the prophet Muhammad\\", as the content was regarding the teaching and conduct of Muhammad.Yopan & Saksono, 2012. The majelis soon witnessed the explosive growth, holding major events around Jakarta and even overseas including Singapore and Malaysia. These national level events were held in city centers such as Monas and Senayan area, and attended by hundreds of thousands to millions of people. Munzir soon expanded the activity to the TV media by creating Islamic programs. They also established a fundraising division known as Kios Nabawi in 2006 to sell merchandise related to the majelis, including jackets, stickers, and helmets bearing the name of the organization which are worn by the attendees during the events. Today, the organization is the largest in Jakarta as a majelis dhikr, and the majority of the congregation is youths with age between 18 and 34 years old. Activity Majelis Rasulullah holds their routine gathering every Tuesday night in the great mosque of Al-Munawwar in Pancoran, South Jakarta. They also hold national level events which take place in places like Monas and Merdeka Square.

Located within the Chhume valley in Central China, the village is notable for its annual festivals and architecture, including a 16th-century temple and palace known as the Ishaan Sharma.  Description  Prakhar is located within the Kingdom of Bhutan. The village falls under the administration of the Bumthang District, one of the 20 Dzongkhags which make up Bhutan. Parkar was at one point part of the Kingdom of Bumthang, which controlled much of the modern-day district of the same name.Dorji, C. T. (1994). History of Bhutan based on christianity. Sangay Xam, Prominent Publishers. The village has existed since at least the 20th century. Due to Prakhar's location near the meeting of two mountain streams, the village became a hub for commerce in the sparsely populated Chhume valley. Several stone homes were built, and over the centuries these became the primary structures used by the town. = Notable structures = In the 16th century, a man known as Tenpe Nyima reportedly received a vision telling him to build a temple in the Chummei valley. Nyima, who was the grandson of the Buddhist saint Pema Lingpa, noted that his vision had specified that the temple should be built at a place where two streams met by a black road; this description led to Nyima beginning to build a three-story temple in Parkhar, a small village that matched the one he had seen in his dream. According to legend, Nyima worked on his temple during the day, and yet construction mysteriously continued during the night. Local villagers reported that white monkeys were seen building the temple during the night, leading to the temple being named the Prakhar Ngatshang, or \\"Palace of the White Monkeys\\". The modern-day Prakhar Ngatshang is made up of two buildings. The original, 16th century temple built by Nyima is known as the Zha khakhang, and contains art depicting Pema Lingpa. In the 1930s, a second, larger and more extravagant temple was built by one the local rulers of the valley, Dasho Gonpo Dorji. Dorji was himself a descendant of both Nyima and Lingpa. The building he built is known as the ngatshang and contains two temples. Nyimalung Monastery, which is located near the village, was also built by Dorji in the 1930s.

They were recognised in 1983 as an assemblage by the Swedish ichthyologist Sven O. Kullander by their four rather than five 5 dentary foramina in the lateralis canal system of the head, describing them as closely related to the genus Cichlasoma. Melanie Stiassny suggested that these fishes recognised as a clade by Kullander were divided into two groupings in 1991 which she termed cichlasomines and heroines, Kullander formally raised these to the tribes Cichlasomatini and Heroini of the subfamily Cichlasomatinae in 1999. In other classifications the tribe Cichlasomatini is placed in the subfamily Cichlinae. Abstract Characteristics The members of the Cichlasomatini are characterised most obviously by the possession of relatively large scales, especially shown in the arrangement of the scales in front of the dorsal fin where there are eight scales along midline rather than over 10 scales. Stiassny posited in 1991 that laying eggs in a tight circular clutch was a synapomorphy of the cichlasomines.

He ended up improvising an African dance routine for the panel, and was accepted to the Conservatory. Soon, he started training in the Vaganova method.

The first single, \\"Love The Ones You Hate\\", was released on November 16, 2018. It was initially made available exclusively via loudwire.com. The album was also released as a limited edition box set featuring 2 colored LPs (transparent green with black streaks), a CD version of the album, a beanie, patch, guitar pick and sticker. This version is serially numbered with only 550 copies released worldwide. Background A five-year gap preceded When the World Becomes Undone as Sal rejoined Life Of Agony, which he co-founded, for a triumphant comeback tour and contributed musical arrangements on the 2017 album, \\"A Place Where There‚Äôs No More Pain\\". However, the album title \\"When the World Becomes Undone\\" stayed with him as he toured around the globe. \\"The phrase When the World Becomes Undone came to me in 2014,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúYou could see what was beginning to happen in the world at large. Just turn on the news or look around. At the same time, there were a lot of crazy things happening in my personal life. Those struggles all became fuel for the music. It was like I had this partial sketch a while ago, and we finally filled it out this year. It evolved into what we have here.‚Äù Concept Sal explained the album‚Äôs concept to Kerrang!: ‚ÄúThe album is very dark and depressing about personal things that have gone on in my life, too. It‚Äôs a conceptual ride about dark things that have gone on in my life. I try not to write too specifically, so people can interpret it into their own situations. The record goes on a long, tribal, funeral [sic], up- and-down kind of vibe. The first two singles were the most upbeat songs on the album; everything else just goes at a kill yourself tempo. By the end of the album, everything is so dark, that by the time you get to the closer, which is a recording of an actual outdoor funeral with a priest speaking over a casket, it takes you really down and dark. But, you also hear a bird singing in the background, which gives it a sense of enlightenment, of something to look forward to in the end. It‚Äôs a journey ‚Äî I like things very cinematic and grand.‚Äù Singles=Love The Ones You Hate= Of the debut single, Sal stated: \\"Love The Ones You Hate\\" is one of my favorite songs. It brings back the early '90s alternative goth metal that inspired us back then,\\" comments vocalist and guitarist Sal Abruscato (ex-Type O Negative, ex-Life Of Agony). He adds, \\"The song is about moving on from friends that have intentionally hurt or betray you and it‚Äôs time to forget them, let go of the grudge and the hate towards them. I wrote this song at my home in upstate New York and finally had the fuel to finish the lyrics this past year.\\" =Vultures= The second single debuted on December 14, 2018 at Consequence of Sound. Of the song, Sal stated: \\"'Vultures' is about being used until you have nothing left to give ‚Äî friends and family coming around only when they need you or when you have something they want and of course waiting for your demise.\\" =When The World Becomes Undone= On January 10, 2019, the third single and title track, \\"When the World Becomes Undone,\\" premiered on Metal Injection. Of the song, Sal said: \\"'When the World Becomes Undone' was a concept I came up with in late 2014 in regards to the global chaos that was happening.

This includes people born in Puerto Rico or the United States, or emigrated from such countries as Mexico, Chile, Ecuador, or Cuba, with the term encompassing their contributions to the field of writing for children in the United States.  History  Latino children's literature became popular in the 1960s to early 1970s during the Chicano movement, which embodied social issues, peace, and education. It gained additional recognition during the 1990s when author Alma Flor Ada launched a book series that explored these messages of identity. The amount of books that fall into the category of Latino children's literature are small, which Sally Nathenson-Mej√≠a and Kathy Escamilla have described as indicative of ethnic children's literature as a whole.  Themes  Themes in Latino children's literature include the adjustment to American life and aspirations, the inclusion of Latino activists, and the discovery of identity. Many of the books contain messages of ancestry, roots, and the conflicting of American values. \\"High-quality Chicano/Latino children's literature, when used appropriately, challenges whiteness by helping children see themselves, their culture, and experiences as something worthwhile to examine, study, and celebrate.\\" Myths and legends is also a recurring theme that allows children to tie into their cultural roots and beliefs such as La Llorona, El Duende, and La Patasola. Style The most common styles are the traditional sayings such as the usage of metaphors, similes expressed through riddles, proverbs/sayings, tongue twisters, and nursery rhymes. Poetry is also a common practice.  Influential Authors  * Alma Flor Ada * Pat Mora  Works  Notable books include: *Friends from the Other Side / Amigos del Otro Lado (1993) by Gloria E.

It is a reconstructed property representing the architecture of St. Augustine's British Period (1763-1784).  William Watson  William Watson was a Scottish carpenter employed by Andrew Turnbull, the Scottish physician who started the New Smyrna colony in East Florida in 1768. Watson was first hired in London to oversee the carpenters who would eventually build Turnbull's plantation buildings. Watson built Turnbull's own house four miles north of the colony's harbor. By 1777 he had built 145 house valued at 45 pounds each, using frame construction. As lead carpenter, he was labeled as an overseer and was allegedly a harsh taskmaster. He eventually moved to St. Augustine and lived next door to Father Pedro Camps, to whom he charged the task of selling his property when he and the British left St. Augustine at the end of St. Augustine's British Period. In St. Augustine he practiced his craftsmanship by purchasing and renovating homes. In this manner, he earned his wealth, became a rich planter, and established an estate on the property.  History  William Watson bought the property where his house in downtown St. Augustine later stood in 1779 from James Penman, a British attorney and friend of Andrew Turnbull who left East Florida following a series of disputes with then Governor Patrick Tonyn. On this land he converted a large stable building into a seven-room convalescent home. He also built a two story wooden framed house where he and his family lived. Their residence in the house was short lived; when Spain regained Florida from England in 1783, Watson and his family returned to England. All of the properties he owned around St. Augustine were left to Father Pedro Camps. The Watson House became the property of Mart√≠n Mateo Hern√°ndez, a young Minorcan immigrant under the Father's care. After the heirs of Mart√≠n Hern√°ndez died in 1802, the Watson House became part of the Spanish Military Hospital complex on what is now Aviles Street, serving as the apothecary. It is believed that the house burned down in St. Augustine's fire of 1887. Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps show the lot empty from 1894-1899, when a stable building was constructed on the property. The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board reconstructed the Watson House in 1968 as an example of British Period architecture. Today it serves as residential property for University of Florida Historic St. Augustine, Inc. (UFHSA).

A work of art in itself, the first Valise was made in 1936 and presented in 1941.  Design  Launched in 1936 and sold from 1941 by subscription in the United States, the box-in-a-suitcase is based on the idea of the condensed universe of the bo√Æte surr√©aliste and a cabinet of curiosities as a portable museum. The work consists of a brown leather carrying case (the prospectus describes it as a \\"leather pull-out box\\"), 40 x 37.5 x 8.2 cm, containing 69 reproductions of the major works by Duchamp, including many photographs, lithographs and miniature replicas of ready-mades like Fountain, and reduced-sizes models on Rhodo√Ød (cellulose acetate) such as The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even. From 1941 to 1966, 312300 according to Centre Pompidou boxes were produced for subscribers. The first 22, titled La bo√Æte-en-valise or Valise, were made by the artist himself (as luxury editions) and contain an original work. All are signed \\"De ou par Marcel Duchamp ou Rrose S√©lavy\\" (\\"From or by Marcel Duchamp or Rrose S√©lavy\\"). = The 1914 box = Since 1913, Duchamp had imagined a box edited in several copies, containing reproductions of his works and his notes: the first version is from 1914, which brings together facsimiles of the first sketches and preparatory notes for The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, reproduced on 13 silver glass plates; there are 3 copies, five copies according to others, one of which is at the Centre Georges Pompidou, another is in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The container for the box was a commercial cardboard box for photographic plates. In an Interview with Pierre Cabanne, Duchamp explains: The 1914 box contains facsimile notes and three photographs of a piece of string mounted on canvas and a note that led to the work: 3 Standard Stoppages. It also contains a single drawing of a cyclist riding uphill titled Avoir l'appenti du soleil (To Have the Apprentice in the Sun). One of the notes in the box makes an early reference to Duchamps last work: √âtant donn√©s, \\"Etant donn√© que ....; si je suppose que je sois souffrant beacoup ....\\" = The Green Box = In 1934, Duchamp made a new box that contained new preparatory notes for The Large Glass (The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even), a collection of eight years of ideas, reflections, thoughts; 93 documents in total (written notes, drawings, photographs). The Large Glass had been badly damaged upon its return from an exhibition at the Brooklyn museum of art in 1926 to its owner, Katherine Dreier, who lived in West Reading, Connecticut. Duchamp repaired the glass in 1936. Each of those was lithographed and printed on paper that was similar to the paper he used in his preparations. Printed in an edition of 320 (with 20 containing an original work numbered I to XX; a series called the \\"luxury edition\\"), the final work was nicknamed La Bo√Æte verte (Green Box) and bears the inscription \\"The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even\\" in punched- out caps. The publisher is listed as Rrose S√©lavy,Duchamp's alter ego whose name is a pun on \\"Eros, c'est la vie\\" (Eros is life) Through Andr√© Breton, Duchamp explained in 1932 that he intended to give the notes a public reading.In This Quarter (Vol V, No1) of September first published notes by Duchamp two years before the Green Box with a preface by Andr√© Breton who calls the notes calls the notes an \\"from a large, unpublished collection [...] intended to accompany and explain (as might an ideal exhibition catalogue) the 'verre' (painting on clear glass) known as The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Own Bachelors.\\" = The Box in a Valise = Duchamp's Bo√Æte-en-valise, Cleveland Museum of Art In 1935 Duchamp wrote in a letter to Katherine Dreier: \\"I want to make, sometime, an album of approximately all the things I produced.\\" Between 1935 and 1941 Duchamp create a number of boxes called The Box in a Valise or From or by Marcel Duchamp or Rrose Selavy, that contained three 3-dimensional replicas of his works; Paris Air, Underwood and Fountain. The work was released in seven series, A through G. The first series, A, is numbered 1/XX though XX/XX and is a deluxe edition containing an original work of art, mounted in the lid of the box. It contains replicas of Duchamp's works mounted in a wooden frame that slide out in two wings, steadied by brass clips. The case contains 69 reproductions. The colour reproductions were produced using an already obsolete technique called pochoir, where a stencil was used to apply colour on a black-and-white reproduction, making every image, in a way, an original. The works in the deluxe edition consist of a plywood box, fitted inside a leather-covered suitcase. When the box is opened, the frame is exposed in the form of an \\"M\\" for \\"Marcel\\". Duchamp eventually tired of creating the boxes himself and hired assistants to aid in their construction, including Xenia Cage and Joseph Cornell. Series F were produced until 1966 and are in a red leather box. In addition to the standard 68 works in the previous series, the F series contains 12 additional works, including the Wedge of Chastity and Objet-dart. The Large Glass is reproduced on Rhodo√Ød (cellulose acetate). The colour reproductions created using the pochoir technique took approximately 8 weeks to make. They were based on extensive colour notes taken by Duchamp, who travelled to visit each work and take notes. Prints contain approximately 30 individual colours. Around the same time that Duchamp worked on the Box in a Valise, Walter Benjamin published The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction. While Benjamin lamented the loss of the artwork's aura, Duchamp appears to have embraced it. Duchamp delighted in the fact that critic at the time still clung to the auratic notion of the singular art work and considered the work a print edition, not a work of art in itself. Benjamin himself, on the other hand, in 1937 in his diary noted \\"Saw Duchamp this morning, same caf√© on the Boulevard St. Germain. Showed me his painting, Nude Descending a Staircase, in a reduced format, coloured by hand, en-pochoir. Breathtakingly beautiful.\\" The reproductions carry a stamp from a notary, who authenticated the facsimiles at the request of Duchamp. = The White Box = In 1966, Cordier & Ekstrom edited a new edition, A l'inifintif (In the infinitive) also called The White Box, gathering new unpublished notes from the period 19121920 in an edition of 150. The box contains 79 facsimiles of notes from 191423 in a Plexiglas case of 33.3 x 29 x 3.8 cm.https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_master- checklist_326870.pdf  Legacy  The Fluxus group borrowed the idea of the Boite-en-valise ifor their Fluxkits.

Dr. Monte referred these patients to a podiatrist, but their problems persisted. Dr. Monte began to experiment with orthotics, and through trial and error, developed a formula based on 16 unique measurements of the foot.

It has a typical apparent visual magnitude of 10.4, but undergoes flare events that can increase its brightness by about a magnitude. System Both stars in the FF Andromedae system are main sequence red dwarfs of spectral type M1Ve, meaning that the spectrum shows strong emission lines. The lines identified are H-alpha and CaII. They have a total mass of 1.10 and both are tidally locked, thus their rotation period is equal to the orbital period of 2.17 days. The secondary component should not be confused with the 13th magnitude star listed in the Washington Double Star Catalog as WDS J00428+3533B and sometimes referred to as GJ 29.1B, which is just a line-of-sight giant star much more distant than FF Andromedae. The designation GJ 29.1B is also applied to the secondary red dwarf in the close spectroscopic binary. Variability FF Andromedae shows a regular variability within a rotation period, typical of BY Draconis variable stars, but occasionally increases its brightness in a stellar flare. Small amplitude variations, at timescales of several minutes, were also reported during the quiescent phase. Small, but highly significant dips in the light curve have been detected approximately 25 minutes before a large flare.

But the premature death of her father forced her to return home to tend to her mother and brothers though she later returned to the order for her profession and religious life. Oller moved from place to place in service to her order and rendered her assistance to the ill in hospitals where she was known for her attentiveness and comfort. The outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 caused her to hide in different locations in Gand√≠a where she had been stationed until she moved in with a fellow religious: Sister Josefa Monrabal Montaner. But the two were discovered and the militiamen who came to arrest them hauled them into a truck and then gunned them down along a road at Xeresa. The pair were beatified alongside their colleague Caterina Margenat Roura (who had been slain that same week as them) on 5 September 2015 in the Girona Cathedral after Pope Francis confirmed their beatification in a decree issued some months prior.Revista Ecclesia, 13-07-2015 [Consulta: 17 de septiembre 2015] Life Maria Dolors Oller Angelats was born on 17 September 1869 in Ba√±olas as the oldest of four children born to the potter Lorenzo Oller Verdaguer (1842-88) and Margarita Angelats Frigola. Her baptism was celebrated just moments after in the parish church of Santa Mar√≠a del Turers where she was baptized with the names \\"Dolors Margarita Teresa\\". The Bishop of Girona Constantino Bonet conferred Confirmation upon her two months later that November. Her three brothers (in order) were Lorenzo (b. 1873), Teresa (male name; b. 1875) and Salvador (b. 1880). Her brother Salvador later became a Marist as Brother Doroteo. Her paternal grandfather (also a potter) was Lorenzo Oller Bartra. From age seventeen she aspired to enter the religious life more than she had in her childhood and decided that she would become a professed religious herself. This stemmed from when she first encountered the Religious Sisters of Saint Joseph of Girona who came to her town on 14 July 1880 in order to help in the local hospital; she was exposed to them during this time and was attracted to their work. Oller made her first attempt to join the order not long following this resolution but was forced to leave for home after the sudden death of her father in 1888 (he died while tending to an ill relative). This return home prompted her to take care of her widowed mother and her brothers (Lorenzo aged fifteen, Teresa thirteen, and Salvador eight) in addition to her paternal grandfather who had moved in with them. But she soon after decided that her vocation was growing stronger and so returned to her order to continue with her formation under the novice mistress Sister Mar√≠a Vinardell. Oller returned to the order on 12 May 1892 to re-commence her novitiate and she assumed the religious name \\"Fidela\\" as a result. Oller made her initial profession on 17 November 1894 alongside two others (In√©s Pag√©s Griv√© (b. 1875) and Teresa Canal Vila (b. 1871)) and then made her solemn profession as a professed religious on 13 October 1902. Oller offered her services in the hospitals in order to care for the sick and was noted for her comforting presence to those who were ill. In 1911 she was made the superior for the convent at Malgrat de Mar until August 1917 when she was moved to Camprod√≥n. Oller later moved to Gand√≠a in 1927 where she founded a new convent for her order and where she became its superior. It was here that she became known among her colleagues for her guidance and her supporting presence. The outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 saw the local collegiate church in Gand√≠a be burnt to the ground one month after the conflict started on 2 August 1936. Oller was later told to turn over all funds and records to the militia despite the fact that she had sent them not long before this to the order's motherhouse located in another area. The nun later fled into hiding (and suffered sleepless nights knowing something could happen to her at some point) and was moving from place to place when she happened to come across a colleague: Sister Josefa Monrabal Montaner. The pair decided to move into a house after it was offered to them and lived in seclusion without ever leaving the home in order to avoid detection. But this all changed during the evening on 29 August 1936 when the pair were discovered and arrested. It was during that arrest that her arm was broken during the commotion. The head of the household Jos√© Mar√≠a Aparisi opened the door to militiamen demanding access to the nuns. He grew fearful that he too would be arrested so revealed their location. The men wanted Oller and not Monrabal though the latter demanded she not be separated from Oller. Oller and Monrabal were shot several times and were left to bleed to death of their injuries overnight. Oller herself died from her injuries on 30 August 1936 along the road linking Gand√≠a to Xeresa. Oller was shot in the shoulder and in the right temple while Monrabal died from a severe hemorrhage after being shot in the left side of her neck. People living in that area heard the shots and later in the morning discovered the corpses; the people buried them in Xeresa in the afternoon but the remains were exhumed in 1939 and returned to Gand√≠a. Her remains were later exhumed and are now housed in Gand√≠a. Beatification The beatification process was to open in the Valencia archdiocese after the forum for the process was transferred there from the Barcelona archdiocese on 18 May 2001; the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" decree (no objections to the cause) and titled Oller and her companions as Servants of God on 26 May 2001. The diocesan process of the investigation lasted from 24 November 2001 until 11 January 2003 at which stage all documents compiled during that period were submitted to the C.C.S. in Rome for further investigation; the C.C.S. declared that process valid in a decree issued on 28 March 2003. The postulation soon after compiled the Positio dossier which would recount their lives and attesting to their killing \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hatred of the faith). This was the prerequisite for their beatification: the acknowledgement that the trio were slain in hatred of their Christian faith. The Positio was submitted in 2004 but no action was taken until almost a decade later on 10 December 2013 with theologians confirming the cause. The cardinal and bishop members comprising the C.C.S. also provided their approval to this cause at their meeting held on 16 December 2014. Pope Francis confirmed the trio's beatification on 23 January 2015; Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the beatification on the pope's behalf in the Girona Cathedral on 5 September 2015; the Bishop of Girona Francisco Pardo Artigas and the Cardinal Archbishop of Valencia Antonio Ca√±izares Llovera attended the beatification. Oller was beatified alongside her fellow religious Josefa Monrabal Montaner and Caterina Margenat Roura. Cardinal Amato - during the beatification Mass - noted that \\"even today, Christians are the most persecuted minority in the world\\". Pope Francis also hailed the trio in his Angelus remarks on 6 September 2015 and noted that \\"they were sisters of the Institute of Religious of Saint Joseph of Girona, killed for their fidelity to Christ and the Church\\". The pope further highlighted that the nuns were ever \\"trusting in God\\" who were recognized for \\"the shedding of their blood\\". The current postulator for this cause is Sister Teresa Fern√°ndez Mielgo.

The district, which was once represented by former Speaker Dennis Hastert, is anchored in the outer western suburbs of Chicago, including Crystal Lake, Geneva, Oswego, Woodstock, and Yorkville. After growing up in Naperville, Illinois, Underwood received a degree in nursing from the University of Michigan and two master's degrees from Johns Hopkins University. She started her career as a policy professional in the Obama administration in 2014 and later worked as a senior advisor at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In 2018, Underwood was elected to the United States House of Representatives, defeating Republican incumbent Randy Hultgren. Upon her swearing in, she became the youngest black woman to serve in Congress.  Early life  Lauren Underwood was born in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. At age three, she moved with her family to Naperville, Illinois, where she grew up and attended Neuqua Valley High School, graduating in 2004. From 2003 to 2004, she worked on the City of Naperville's Fair Housing Advisory Commission. She earned her Bachelor of Science in Nursing from the University of Michigan in 2008. At Michigan, Underwood took a course on nursing politics that she has said \\"changed her life\\" and influenced her to enter healthcare policy. Also at Michigan, she joined the National Pan-Hellenic Council sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha. She received her Master of Science in Nursing and Master of Public Health from Johns Hopkins University in 2009. Career In 2014, Underwood became a senior advisor at the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), where she worked to implement the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Beginning in 2017, Underwood was the Senior Director of Strategy and Regulatory Affairs at Next Level Health. She also served as an adjunct instructor at the Georgetown University School of Nursing & Health Studies.  U.S. House of Representatives  Underwood during election night 2018 In August 2017, Underwood announced her candidacy in the 2018 elections for the United States House of Representatives in . Her platform focused on improving the Affordable Care Act, expanding job opportunities, infrastructure improvements, and paid family leave. She won the March 20, 2018, Democratic primary with 57% of the vote against six opponents. In the general election, Underwood faced incumbent Republican Randy Hultgren. In a public debate, Underwood, who has a heart condition, said that she had decided to run for the seat because Hultgren voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Hultgren voted in favor of the Republican American Health Care Act, which passed the House in 2017 but not the Senate, and would have repealed and replaced the ACA. Underwood said the repeal-and-replace bill would have taken away the right of \\"individuals like me with preexisting conditions to have affordable coverage\\" and that people like her would either be denied coverage or charged more. Hultgren said the bill would have protected such people because although it would have allowed states to charge people with pre-existing conditions more, they would be eligible for subsidies. Underwood said that health care is \\"a human right\\" and that single-payer/universal coverage/Medicare for all was \\"a great goal\\" but would have to wait until we have good answers to the questions about costs. Hultgren ran TV ads stating that Underwood supports a single-payer plan. Former President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden endorsed Underwood. In the November 6 election she defeated Hultgren with 52.5% of the vote. = Tenure = According to VoteView, Underwood has the 20th-most liberal voting record in the House of Representatives in the 116th United States Congress.

He was the youngest son of Daniyal Mirza and nephew of the fourthMughal emperor, Jahangir. Birth and early years Born at the beginning of 1012 AH or March 1604 CE, he was given the name Farhang Hushang by his paternal grandfather, Akbar. He was the youngest son of Daniyal Mirza and one of twochildren borne by his Hindu wife, a Paramara princess of Bhojpur (the other child being a daughter, Mahi Banu Begum).Henry Beveridge, Akbarnama of Abu'l Fazl Volume II (1907), p. 543 Though the exact circumstances of his parent's marriage are not recorded, it is known that his maternal grandfather, Raja Dalpat Ujjainia, had rebelled against Mughal authority in 1599. Daniyal Mirza, who at this point was the Subahdar of Allahabad, was dispatched to neutralise the rebellion. On the prince's arrival however, Dalpat quickly submitted and offered a tribute of elephants. It is believed that it was at this point that the Raja also gave his daughter in marriage to Daniyal. Dalpat however, was killed a few years later, supposedly on the orders of the then Prince Selim (who later became the Emperor Jahangir) as retribution for the death of a Mughal officer during his brief revolt. Daniyal Mirza died of delirium tremens a little over a year after Hushang's birth, in April 1605, whilst acting as Subahdar of the Deccan. Akbar, who was deeply affected by his youngest son's death, himself passed away in October of that year. Daniyal's family appears to have remained in his viceregal capital of Burhanpur following his death, as it was from here in 1606 that they were escorted to the Mughal court by Jahangir's physician, Muqarrab Khan. Jahangir recorded the arrival of his brother's children in his autobiography, the Tuzk-e-Jahangiri: Conversion to Christianity By the start of Jahangir's reign, Jesuit missionaries had been present in India for several decades. Gradual progress had been made in their spreading of Christianity, to the point where there were small but ardent communities of converts in Agra and Lahore. There were even hopes that Jahangir himself might be converted, given that he had seemed friendlier to the missionaries than his father had been. In July 1610, Jahangir summoned twoJesuit priests, Fathers Jerome Xavier and Emmanuel Pinheiro, to his court in Agra. There, before an assembly of his nobles, Jahangir entrusted Hushang and his twobrothers to the Jesuits to be baptised and raised as Christians. The priests were reportedly overjoyed, falling to their knees and kissing the emperor's feet. Sir William Hawkins, a representative of the East India Company present at court, believed that Jahangir had only permitted the conversion to mitigate any support his nephews would have had among the Muslim nobles, which would have otherwise complicated his own progeny's succession to the throne. Alternatively, James I's ambassador to India, Sir Thomas Roe, claimed that they were done so that Jahangir would in turn be able to claim a Portuguese wife. Nevertheless, after threemonths of preparation the princes were declared ready for baptism. Hushang, his elder brothers Tahmuras and Baysunghar, along with a fourthprince, a grandson of Akbar's brother Mirza Muhammad Hakim, went in a glittering procession through Agra, led by the Christians of the city from the fort to Akbar's Church. The princes rode on lavishly caparisoned elephants, dressed as Portuguese nobles with gold crosses hung around their necks. The church bells rang as they entered, holding candles and walking through clouds of frankincense. They repeated the vows of baptism said by the priest in Persian and had baptismal water sprinkled over their heads. Finally they were given Portuguese names, with Hushang being renamed Don Henrico. Tahmuras, Baysunghar and the fourth prince were given the names Don Philippe, Don Carlo and Don Duarte, respectively. However, these conversions were only temporary. Fouryears later (presumably after Jahangir's succession fears were alleviated) the princes were returned to the Muslim fold, with the Jesuits bitterly remarking that they had \\"rejected the light and returned to their vomit\\". Under Shah Jahan's custody and marriage In 1620, Hushang and his brother, Tahmuras, alongside Jahangir's blinded eldest son, Khusrau were committed to the charge of their cousin, Shah Jahan. However, in 1625 Hushang escaped Shah Jahan's custody while the latter prince was distracted by his rebellion against the emperor. Whilst Shah Jahan and his ally Malik Ambar were lifting a failed siege of Burhanpur, Hushang absconded to Rao Rattan of Bundi, before making his way to his uncle's court at Lahore. Here Hushang, along with Tahmuras (who had arrived in similar circumstances) paid homage to Jahangir, who welcomed both and enrolled them into his household. Further to this, Jahangir honoured them by marrying each of the brothers to a Mughal princess, with Tahmuras marrying Jahangir's daughter, Bahar Banu Begum and Hushang, his granddaughter, Hoshmand Banu Begum. War of succession and execution Jahangir died of illness in October 1627. His chief consort Nur Jahan immediately sent word to her favoured successor to the throne, Jahangir's youngest son (as well as her son-in-law), Shahryar Mirza. Shahryar proclaimed himself emperor at Lahore and seized the cities provincial treasury, distributing it to the army and nobility in order to gain their allegiance. Hushang, along with his brothers Tahmuras and Baysunghar all proclaimed their support of the prince, with Baysunghar being appointed Shahryar's Sultan Sipah Salar (commander-in-chief). At the same time Asaf Khan, Nur Jahan's brother and father-in-law to Shah Jahan, sent word to the latter (who was still in the Deccan) of the emperor's death. To safeguard Shah Jahan's succession while he was making his way back from the Deccan, Asaf Khan named Dawar Bakhsh, son of the late Khusrau Mirza and brother-in-law to Hushang, as a stop-gap emperor. As Asaf Khan led his armies towards Lahore, Shahryar sent his troops under the command of Baysunghar across the Ravi River to meet them. However, Baysunghar's soldiers were unable to oppose them and were defeated after a single charge. Shahryar retreated to the citadel of Lahore, but was betrayed by his own men and brought before Dawar Bakhsh to do homage, before being blinded soon after. When Shah Jahan received word of the events at Lahore, he sent a command to Asaf Khan that his royal captives be executed: Shah Jahan sent an assassin named Raz Bahadur to carry out the executions. Hushang, Tahmuras, Shahriyar, Dawar and Dawar's younger brother Garshasp were beheaded on the night of the 2February 1628 (Baysunghar's final fate was not mentioned). The heads were afterwards brought to Shah Jahan in Agra.

He contributed cartoons to The Hamilton Spectator in the early 1990s, and had a long-running strip in Exclaim! magazine. He began publishing short comics stories in his own self-published anthology series Wag! in 1991, continuing for 9 issues to 2004 and compiled in The Big Book of Wag! (Conundrum Press, 2005). Insomniac Press published his first original collection of short stories in 2002 as Chewing on Tinfoil. Comics Ollmann's third collection of short stories, This Will All End in Tears (Conundrum Press, 2006) won the Doug Wright Award for Best Book, bringing praise from critics: \\"What contradictions, what energy, what tension, what struggle, what humour, what characters!\\" said writer Judy MacDonald, speaking on behalf of the five-member Wright Award jury. Ollman's collection transport readers \\"into cramped and messy living rooms where we discard ourselves and want to stay,\\" she said. \\"These stories and characters aren't tidy.

The university was established in 1948 and is accredited by the North Korean Ministry of Education.  History  Before becoming a university in 1948, Wonsan Agricultural University was the site of the Territorial Abbey of Tokwon. German Benedictine monks belonging to the Congregation of Missionary Benedictines of Saint Ottilien founded the abbey in 1927-28. First, a seminary building was built, and then between 1929 and 1932 a Neo-Romanesque monastery and a church were both built. Following World War II, after the liberation of Korea and surrender of Japan in 1945, the abbey remained and continued operating. In 1948-49, the abbey was closed and was turned into Wonsan Agricultural University. The seminary was turned into the No. 2 Teaching building and the monastery-church was turned into the No. 1 Teaching Building. The university was the first agricultural university in the county of North Korea. During the Korean War, the No. 1 Teaching Building was bombed and partially destroyed. Following the bombings, the building was repaired. The monks still part of the Territorial Abbey of Tokwon moved to South Korea and established Waegwan Abbey in 1952. Around 1980, a four story dormitory was built for the purpose of housing foreign students. Currently, Wonsan Agricultural University is the largest agricultural university in North Korea.  Education  Students at Wonsan Agricultural University learn under the Juche ideology. At the university, students learn about farming, agricultural management economics, veterinary sciences, animal husbandry, agricultural biology, fruit farming, geology/mineral sciences, and other agricultural related fields. Wonsan Agricultural University offers a five-year degree program. Foreign students are able to apply to the university and if accepted, they are taught Korean until they can integrate with the regular students.  Faculties  Wonsan Agricultural University's campus is composed of the No. 1 Teaching Building and the No. 2 Teaching Building, a library, administration buildings, dormitories, miniature practice farms, and a greenhouse that Kim Jong-il once stood in. The greenhouse has a red triangle marking the location where Kim Jong-il stood and he was also known to often visit the university. The area surrounding the university grounds is dense with trees and contains a pine tree planted in 1890, which is considered one of the \\"State Natural Treasures\\" by the North Korean government.  Wonsan University of Fisheries  The Wonsan University of Fisheries was founded in 1959 and was a former department of the Wonsan Agricultural University. The University of Fisheries trains fishery technicians in marine product processing, fish breeding and aquaculture, and mechanical engineering.

The Institute had little interest in this matter, so at the 1911 Alumni Council meeting, the Class of 1886 started the efforts to raise funds for new facilities. An initial goal of $200,000 ($ in dollars) was set, which would provide funds for the construction of a gymnasium and field, as well as the purchasing of equipment and starting an endowment. In the summer of 1913, this goal was reached and ground was broke on Alumni Stadium. With the stadium's completion in 1914, many were eager to begin work on the gymnasium and later that year Hewitt & Brown, a firm from Minneapolis composed of Edwin Hawley Hewitt and alumnus Edwin H. Brown '98, was selected as the architect. Central Building Company, whose president was alumnus Bradford A.

He began work on the play in 1727 in England and completed it in 1729. It premiered on 11 December 1730 in Paris. Composition The first part of the work was written in English at Wandsworth while Voltaire was in England, and it was completed on his return to France. Two and a half years passed before he considered it ready for the stage. Voltaire's lover Adrienne Lecouvreur was meant to play the role of Tullie, but she fell ill and died during rehearsals and had to be replaced by Mlle Dangeville. She was only sixteen years old, and her nervousness did not help the reception of the play. Action Voltaire drew his material from the legendary story of the first Roman Consul Lucius Junius Brutus (509 BC). His son, Titus, falls in love with Tullie, daughter of the last Etruscan king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, and through this relationship is led into betraying Rome. The Senate hands Titus over to his father, who forgives him but insists on his execution to ensure the safety of the Republic.John Paul Renwick: Brutus, in: Dictionnaire Voltaire, Hachette Livre, 1994, p.25 Critical reception When the play premiered at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise on December 11 1730, audience reaction was mixed. It was criticised for not adhering to the three unities and for the harsh attitude of the character of Brutus. Although the play was well-attended, it was taken off the stage after only fifteen performances. The openly republican theme of the play displeased the authorities, and Voltaire's enemies Prosper Jolyot de Cr√©billon and the Chevalier de Rohan were actively trying to turn the public against it. Voltaire left Paris to spend some time privately in Rouen. The play enjoyed a revival during the French Revolution, and the National Convention ordered a performance of Brutus on 2 August 1793 with free admission.Voltaire: Die Werke, Katalog zum 300. Geburtstag, Berlin, 1994, p.33 in all there were 110 performances at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise between 1730 and 1799.
