One estate of his family was used to preserve an endangered species of Hawaiian goose. A historic house associated with his family for over a hundred years is called the W. H. Shipman House in Hilo, Hawaii. Another of his historic estates called the Ainahou Ranch, built in 1941 as a refuge from World War II, is preserved within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Life William Herbert Shipman (also known as \\"Willie\\" Shipman) was born December 17, 1854, at Lahaina, Hawaii, the son of missionary parents, William Cornelius Shipman (1824‚Äì1861) and Jane Stobie Shipman (1827‚Äì1904). William Herbert's parents were newly married in July 1853, when the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions sent them to Micronesia. While on their way to their assignment, William Cornelius and Jane were told to disembark from their ship Chaica in Maui because Dwight Baldwin was acting as a physician on that island and Micronesia had no physician to handle the pregnant Jane Shipman's impending delivery. In 1855, William Cornelius and Jane were assigned to the remote outpost of Wai≈çhinu in the Ka≈´ district, replacing Rev. John D. Paris. From Wiaohinu, they were responsible for ministry in the entire Ka≈´ District. Titus Coan, minister of Haili Church in Hilo, Hawai'i personally welcomed the Shipmans to their new post on their arrival. On December 21, 1861, William Cornelius Shipman died from typhoid fever. Jane considered moving the family back to the United States at that point; however, as she was a trained teacher Titus Coan encouraged Jane to start a school on the Island of Hawai'i. In order to support her family, she moved with her three young children - William Herbert, Oliver Taylor, and Margaret Clarissa - to Hilo and opened a school for both Hawaiian and white children. On July 8, 1868 she married businessman William H. Reed (for whom Reed's Bay and Reed's Island in Hilo are named). Her eldest child, William Herbert (W. H.) Shipman attended Punahou School in Oahu and Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois. In April 1879, W. H. Shipman married one of his mother's former students, Mary (Mele) Elizabeth Kahiwaaialii Johnson, the grand-niece of Isaac Davis and the granddaughter of Kauwe, a member of the Hawaiian ali'i on Maui. His sister Margaret Clarissa (1859‚Äì1891) married politician and businessman Lorrin Thurston. A few years after Margaret's death, Thurston organized the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom. W. H. Shipman's brother, Oliver Taylor Shipman (1857‚Äì1942), became a businessman and local government official. W. H. Shipman and his wife Mary had five daughters - Mary Mikahala, Clara, Caroline, Florence Lukini, and Margaret Beatrice, and 3 sons - William Reed, Oliver B., and Herber Cornelius, of whom only the youngest, Herbert Cornelius, survived his father. William Herbert Shipman died on July 8, 1943. The Family Business Returning to Hawai'i after finishing college in the U.S., William Herbert became manager of Kapapala Ranch, which was owned jointly by his stepfather William Reed and C. B. Richardson. This early introduction to ranching had a lasting influence on Shipman. After he married, Shipman and his wife Mary moved to Kapoho, Hawaii, the easternmost point of the island, in the Puna District. Reed died in 1880 with no children of his own, and Shipman inherited the Reed land holdings. In 1881 Shipman and two partners (Captain J. E. Eldarts and S. M. Damon) purchased the entire ahupaa (ancient land division) of Keaau, about , for $20,000 from the King Lunalilo estate. Shipman went into business for himself in 1882, buying out his partners and eventually founding the W. H. Shipman Limited corporation in 1923. The family also had a dairy and poultry farm. Shipman was involved in several court cases over this land, including \\"Shipman v. Nawahi\\" of 1886, named for Puna lawyer Joseph NƒÅwahƒ´. In 1898, the U.S. annexed the Hawaiian islands (after years of lobbying by Shipman's former brother-in-law Lorrin Thurston) which became the Territory of Hawaii. This meant agricultural products shipped to the vast U.S. market were no longer subject to any customs duties. Shipman leased much of his land to grow sugar cane, coffee, and other tropical fruit. In 1899 he leased properties to the new Olaa Sugar Company in Keaau. A large mill was built in 1900, which operated until 1982 (then called the Puna Sugar Company). The endangered Hawaiian goose Shipman built a house in 1904 near the remote Haena beach on his land, coordinates . In the Hawaiian language, hƒÅena means \\"red hot\\", probably due to being downhill from the Kƒ´lauea volcano. In 1911, Shipman formed the Hilo Meat Company to market the cattle from his own ranches, his older brother Oliver B. Shipman's ranch, and the large Parker Ranch located on the northern part of the island. William Herbert's youngest son Herbert Cornelius Shipman (1892‚Äì1976) took over the W.H. Shipman Company in 1943 after his father's death. Herbert is best known for breeding the endangered Hawaiian goose (known as nƒìnƒì in the Hawaiian language, Branta sandvicensis). He started with four birds in 1918 at his coastal Puna Shipman estate, eventually moving the breeding program to the family's 'Ainahou Ranch after the 1946 tsunami almost decimated his existing flocks. He is credited with saving the breed and keeping the nƒìnƒì from extinction. Herbert also started commercial growing of orchids and introduced the anthurium to the Island of Hawai'i. In 1948, some of the Shipman land on Hawai'i was sold and planted with macadamia nut trees, which has grown into the Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corporation plantation. In 1959, the W. H. Shipman Company sold about of land which became the Hawaiian Paradise Park subdivision in the Puna District, south of Hilo. Because of the agricultural zoning, lots are all in size. In 2009, the company still owned about in the Puna District, including an industrial park near the current town of Keaau. Hawaii state law requires public access to all ocean shorelines, however, controversies have surrounded attempts to keep vehicles off the roads through the Shipman Puna property. In 1976 a park in Keaau was named in Herbert Shipman's honor, at coordinates . After Herbert's death, his nephew Roy Shipman Blackshear (1923‚Äì2006) continued the work of raising nƒìnƒì, and headed the W.H. Shipman Company from 1976 until 1994. In 2002, Roy Blackshear resigned from the Board and retired and his nephew William Walter became Chairman of the Board. In 2005 William Walter became President and CEO of the company now managed cooperatively with his cousin Thomas English, both descendants of William H. Shipman.

Its main tributaries are the rivers Piau, Xopot√≥, Pardo and Formoso. The main cities along its banks are Cataguases in Minas Gerais and Santo Ant√¥nio de P√°dua in Rio de Janeiro. The lands of the Rio Pomba basin are severely deforested, a process that began throughout the Zona da Mata during the coffee era and did not spare even the headwaters of the river. It is a factor that contributes to the degradation of the river, also affected by the release of industrial and domestic effluents. In 2003 a major spill of more than 1 billion gallons of toxic waste from one industry in Cataguases caused enormous environmental damage, and the effect was detected in the Paraiba do Sul River to its mouth in the Atlantic Ocean in the state of Rio de Janeiro.

The story arc appears in Marvel Comics Presents #72-84 and tells the story of Wolverine during his time in Weapon X.http://www.comicbookdb.com/storyarc.php?ID=3290 Only the prologue and part of the final chapter are told from the perspective of Wolverine, who is in a near mindless state for the bulk of the story. Instead, three members of the Weapon X team serve as the protagonists: Abraham Cornelius, Carol Hines, and a man referred to within the story as only \\"the Professor\\". Much of the story arc roughly follows the formula of a slasher film, with the protagonists being stalked in an isolated location by a seemingly unstoppable killing machine. Plot The series begins with Logan being captured and prepared for the adamantium bonding process. There are several mentions of his being tough, and the Professor, the director of the Weapon X program, along with his assistants Dr. Cornelius and Miss Hines, wipe his mind and bond him to adamantium, the hardest known substance on Earth, to prepare him to be a mindless, soulless killing machine. Prior to Wolverine volume 2, #75, the plot had too much adamantium bonded to his forearms, resulting in his claws, leading to the development of tubes in his flesh to keep the skin apart for claw extraction. Throughout the program, Logan is constantly referred to not as a person but as a subject, and his humanity is almost completely disregarded in the course of the experiments. Logan frequently comes to odds with his mental programming, and eventually escapes into the wilderness after killing all of the soldiers there (except for one, future Weapon X Director Malcom Colcord) while the Professor, Cornelius, and Hines lock themselves in a secured room that Logan cannot break into. Sequel Issue 48 of Wolverine's first ongoing series has a cover plugging itself as \\"The sequel to Weapon X\\". The issue involves Wolverine making preliminary investigations into his past, and included remakes of three scenes from the Weapon X story. It is collected in Wolverine Visionaries: Marc Silvestri, among other Wolverine stories from the era. Collected editions The story has been collected numerous times, first in a 1993 hardcover () then a 2007 hardcover () which was reprinted in 2009 as a paperback (). Additionally, the story is one of several others in the Best of Wolverine, Volume 1 hardcover, published in 2004 (), and the Wolverine Omnibus, published in 2009 ().

It chronicles the life of Queen Seondeok of Silla. It aired on MBC from 25 May to 22 December 2009 on Mondays and Tuesdays at 21:55 for 62 episodes. The viewership ratings for the show topped TV charts almost every week during its run, peaking at 44.7 percent. It swept the 2009 MBC Drama Awards; actress Go Hyun-jung's performance and subsequent grand prize win received near-universal acclaim. Synopsis The series begins at the end of King Jinheung's reign and continues until the end of Queen Seondeok's reign. Deokman was born as one of the twin daughters of King Jinpyeong and Queen Maya, but due to a prophecy, King Jinpyeong had to send his daughter away from the palace with the help of his clumsy but loyal servant Seohwa, in order to save Queen Maya from being ousted by Mishil, whose ambition was to become Queen. Seohwa raised Deokman as if she were her own, but a turn of events eventually led Deokman into finding out her real identity - only to be abandoned once again by her family in order to save the throne from Mishil's hand, with the exception of her twin sister Cheonmyeon, who ended up losing her life while trying to help Deokman escape. Out of hatred, Deokman set out to take back what was taken from her and avenge her sister by bringing Mishil down and becoming the first female king of Silla with the help of her trusted friend, Yushin and troubled rogue Bidam who she loved, and ultimately led a rebellion near the end of her reign because of a misunderstanding. Cast=Main= *Lee Yo-won as Princess Deokman, later Queen Seondeok **Nam Ji-hyun as young Deokman :A charismatic, yet solitary ruler: She was known as the first female ruler in Korean history. Deokman was born as the twin sister of Princess Cheonmyong and had a close brush with death as a baby due to the attempted assassination by Mi-shil, who had ambitions for the throne. A loyal servant named So-hwa rescued her by fleeing the kingdom with her.

Other historical dramas such as Dong Yi, Moon Embracing the Sun and Jumong were also filmed there. It was filmed at the Shilla Millennium ParkShilla Millennium Park in Gyeongju. Artistic license The series adopted significant artistic license regarding the portrayal of historical events in order to accommodate the dramatic storyline. Notably, the reign of King Jinpyeong was compressed by over two decades such that in the series, Queen Seondeok was born within a year of his coronation (her actual date of birth is unknown). Accordingly, the preceding King Jinheung's reign was extended by a similar period, with him being depicted as an elderly man at his death. This allowed for Mishil and other prominent figures during Jinheung's reign to be involved in events concerning the Queen during her time as Royal Princess, even though there is no evidence to suggest what sort of interaction the two had, if any. Artistic license was used to imagine her as being of a similar age to Kim Yushin and Bidam, though again, it is not clear historically if this was the case. Another major change was in the date of her death: Bidam's execution and Kim Alcheon's appointment to his post were ordered by Jindeok of Silla, ten days after Queen Seondeok's death. Queen Jindeok is not mentioned in the series. More subtly, the real Seondeok likely never left Silla (stories concerning her childhood in the palace survive) and did not know Latin. Plagiarism controversy On 31 December 2009, Kim Ji- young, an obscure playwright and representative of Great Works Ltd., a culture content company, filed a plagiarism lawsuit against MBC and screenwriters Kim Young-hyun and Park Sang-yeon, saying they ripped off her script for Seondeok, Queen of Mugunghwa, an unperformed musical she said she wrote in 2005. Kim argued that the development of the story and conflict between characters were similar to her play, including discord between two major female characters, Seondeok and Mishil; a romance between Deokman and General Kim Yushin; and the story of the young Deokman wandering through a desert. The MBC drama contains all of these plot twists, which are not based on history but which Kim says she invented. Kim said she shared some of her scripts with the Korea Creative Content Agency to attract investment in the musical, and believed that's how the content was leaked. Kim asked for in compensation and an injunction banning the broadcast of the soap opera. The injunction was turned down and Queen Seondeok ran from May to December 2009, but the copyright infringement case continued. The MBC network and the series' writers maintained they did not know of the existence of Kim's play. MBC had copyrighted its script in May 2008. After Kim requested for an assessment by experts, the Seoul Southern District Court asked Seoul National University's Center for Law & Technology to investigate. In a process called a \\"script autopsy,\\" the center first identifies similar content in the two scripts. At that point, university historians confirm historical facts regarding the characters and plot, and differentiates them from literary creations. Afterward, the center makes an appraisal based on copyright laws, then the court makes the final adjudication. In February 2011, the SNU Center for Law & Technology confirmed the plagiarism. In December 2012, the High Court ruled in favor of plaintiff Kim Ji-young that Queen Seondeok was a work of plagiarism, and fined MBC (). In its ruling, the court stated that though the characters and the details were in fact different, \\"the overall plot was the same\\" and it is \\"most probable that the network relied on the script and plot of the musical to produce their drama.\\" Furthermore, any additional reruns on cable TV and internet, and the making of DVD and related books were banned.

It premiered on the Fox network on . It was directed by Rob Bowman, and written by Frank Spotnitz and series creator Chris Carter. \\"Tempus Fugit\\" featured guest appearances by Joe Spano, Tom O'Brien and Brendan Beiser, and saw the return of Scott Bellis as alien abductee Max Fenig. The episode helped to explore the overarching mythology, or fictional history of The X-Files. \\"Tempus Fugit\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 11.9, being watched by 18.85 million people in its initial broadcast. The title translates from Latin as \\"time flies.\\" The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In the episode, Max Fenig‚Äîan old acquaintance of Mulder‚Äîis found dead following an airplane crash, which Mulder believes to have been caused by a UFO attempting to abduct Fenig. \\"Tempus Fugit\\" is a two-part episode, with the plot continuing in the next episode, \\"Max\\". \\"Tempus Fugit\\" was conceived when the series' special effects supervisor Dave Gauthier constructed an elaborate rig capable of simulating a crashing airplane. Carter and Spotnitz expanded upon the idea of a crash to bring back the character of Fenig, who had last been seen in season one's \\"Fallen Angel\\". \\"Tempus Fugit\\" received mixed to positive critical reception, and earned the production crew two Emmy Award nominations, including a win for Outstanding Sound Editing For A Series.  Plot  Four years after his abduction, Max Fenig (Scott Bellis) is traveling on Flight 549, which is flying over upstate New York. He watches another man on the plane who seems to be following him. The man heads to the plane's bathroom, where he assembles a zip gun. However, when he comes back out, the airplane begins shaking and a bright light flashes outside, showing that the plane is encountering a UFO. The emergency door next to Max's seat is opened. Elsewhere, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) celebrate Scully's birthday. They are approached by a woman named Sharon Graffia, who claims to be Max's sister; she tells them that Max planned to deliver something to Mulder, but that his flight to Washington has crashed. The agents head to the crash site in Northville, New York, and attend an NTSB meeting where Flight 549's final transmissions are shown. Mulder theorizes that the plane was forced down by aliens attempting to abduct Max; the NTSB team, led by chief investigator Mike Millar (Joe Spano), dismisses his claims. When Mulder and Scully survey the crash site, they realize that there is a nine-minute disparity between the crash and the time on the victims' wristwatches, indicating missing time. Mulder believes that Max was abducted from the plane and that his body will not be found. Meanwhile, Scott Garrett, a Man in Black posing as an NTSB investigator, steals the zip gun from the assassin's body and erases his face and fingerprints with acid. Larold Rehbun, a passenger who sat next to Max, is found alive. His injuries indicate exposure to radiation. Upon being confronted by Scully, Sharon denies that Max brought a radioactive substance aboard the plane, but divulges that she is not actually Max's sister. She also gives up details about his underground life. Scully subsequently tells Mulder that Max worked at a nuclear weapons assembly facility in Colorado under an alias, and believes that he may have caused the crash after bringing plutonium on board; Mulder, however, believes that Max was taken off the plane by a UFO, and that Rehbun's injuries were caused by exposure to the craft. Scully informs Mulder that Max's body has already been pulled from the crash site. Meanwhile, Sharon is abducted from her hotel room. After identifying Max's body, Mulder finds that the wristwatches have been stolen from the other victims. He refutes the NTSB's official explanation of malfunction as a cause of the crash, and is doubtful that the true cause will be found unless they discern what happened during the nine minutes of missing time. The agents visit Sergeant Louis Frish (Tom O'Brien), an air traffic controller from the U.S. Air Force who was on duty during the crash. Frish denies anything unusual happened. However, after the agents leave, Frish and a colleague argue over whether to reveal the \\"truth\\" about Flight 549's demise. After finding Sharon's trashed hotel room, Mulder meets with Millar, who tells him that the door was pulled off the plane from the outside while it was in flight. Later, Frish finds his colleague dead from a faked suicide. A group of commandos arrive to capture Frish, but he escapes. Frish goes to see Mulder and Scully, telling them that he lied before and that his commanding officer had ordered him to track the plane's coordinates as it was being intercepted by a second aircraft. Seconds later, there was an explosion and the plane disappeared from his radar. Mulder believes that a third aircraft, a UFO, approached the plane and was destroyed by the second aircraft, also causing Flight 549 to crash. The agents leave with Frish and are soon chased by the commandos, but they manage to lose them by driving under a landing plane. Meanwhile, Millar returns to the crash site and encounters a UFO. He finds Sharon nearby, having just been returned by her abductors. Scully returns to Washington with Frish while Mulder heads to Great Sacandaga Lake, searching for the crashed UFO. Scully brings Frish to a local bar where they run into fellow FBI agent Pendrell (Brendan Beiser). Garrett soon enters the bar seeking to kill Frish, accidentally shooting Pendrell instead while Scully shoots him back. Meanwhile, Mulder arrives at the lake where he finds a team of men already searching for the crashed UFO. He dives underwater and finds the craft, including an alien body. Before he can return to the surface, a bright light shines down from above the water. Meisler, pp. 177‚Äì184  Production  Dave Gauthier's Boeing 737 rig was the basis of the episode's conception. = Writing = During the production of the third season, special effects supervisor Dave Gauthier constructed an elaborate mock-up of a Boeing 737 airplane in order to be able to simulate a crash.Edwards, p. 211 Series creator Chris Carter decided to make use of this rig during the fourth season. When conceiving of the episode, the desire to add to Fox Mulder's emotional involvement by having someone he knew on board led to the writers bringing back the character of Max Fenig to be that person. Scott Bellis, who had previously portrayed Fenig in the first season episode \\"Fallen Angel\\", had auditioned for other roles on the show in the interim, but had always been rejected by the producers because his character was felt to be too memorable. Bellis met series star David Duchovny at a gym several times, and learnt from him that the character of Max was being considered for a two-part episode. The episode's co-writer Frank Spotnitz did not want to have Fenig's appearance \\"milked\\" or do something the show had already done. As such he came up with the idea to kill off Fenig in the first part of the episode, which he felt was \\"a bold choice\\".Meisler, pp. 184‚Äì185 = Filming = Gauthier's 737 rig‚Äîwhich required of hydraulic fluid to construct‚Äîwas designed to move across multiple axes in order to better simulate turbulence; it could rotate 22 degrees each way about its length, and move four feet to either side. The fuselage could be opened up at intervals every to better allow cameras to record inside it.Meisler, p. 196 The show's producers wanted the plane crash site and investigation to be as authentic as possible, so they used a National Transportation Safety Board official to act as their technical advisor on the episode to ensure that everything was properly recreated. The NTSB officials noted that the site was authentic in every way \\"except for the smell\\"; Carter has noted that this level of verisimilitude left some of the crew members \\"frightened by their work\\". Director Rob Bowman admitted that the episode exceeded its given budget, noting that Carter would often defend him from Fox studio officials angry at his production costs.Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 111 Bellis' abduction scene, in which his character is levitated through the door of the airplane, was achieved by pulling the actor out of the airplane rig with a harness; additional coverage was achieved by repeating this with a stuntman, who Bellis notes was pulled out of the rig \\"a lot harder\\".  Broadcast and reception  \\"Tempus Fugit\\" premiered on the Fox network on , and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on . The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 11.9 with an 18 share, meaning that roughly of all television-equipped households, and of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. A total of viewers watched this episode during its original airing.Meisler, p. 298 The episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, rated \\"Tempus Fugit\\" an A‚àí. Handlen praised the effectiveness of the cold open, and noted the episode highlighted how \\"particularly ruthless\\" the series was with its recurring cast, noting \\"the mortality rate helps to create a mood of ever-encroaching doom, as if the darkness that seems about to swallow Mulder and Scully in so many scenes ... is as much symbolic as it is literal\\". Paula Vitaris, writing for Cinefantastique, rated \\"Tempus Fugit\\" two-and-a- half stars out of four, describing it as \\"gripping\\" with \\"lots of action\\". However, Vitaris felt that the fleeting use of guest star Scott Bellis was \\"a waste\\", and that the discovery of an alien corpse towards the end \\"robs this story of any ambiguity\\". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, calling it \\"the best conspiracy episode we've seen in nearly two years\\". Shearman and Peason felt that \\"Tempus Fugit\\" was \\"told very clearly, with remarkably little baggage\\", and praised the acting of guests Tom O'Brien and Joe Spano.Shearman and Pearson, p. 97 Twelve members of the show's post-production crew won the 1997 Emmy Award for Outstanding Sound Editing For A Series for their work on this episode; while four others received a nomination for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Drama Series.Meisler, p. 296 FootnotesBibliography   External links  1997 American television episodes Television episodes set in New York (state) The X-Files (season 4) episodes ","title":"Tempus Fugit (The X-Files)"},{"id":"23796210","text":"John Rowlands (August 14, 1938 - 23 February 2015) \\"Welsh author John Rowlands dies, 76\\", BBC News, 23 February 2015 John Rowlands, TheModernNovel.org.

Its mission is to protect the United States and further its global interests by providing devastating combat capability. The group is a successor organization to 2d Bombardment Group, one of the 15 original combat air groups formed by the Army before World War II. It is the oldest bomb group of the Air Force, having fought on the Western Front during World War I, entering combat on 12 September 1918. After the war, it participated in Brigadier General Billy Mitchell's 1921-1923 off-shore bombing tests.Maurer Maurer, ‚ÄúAviation in the U.S. Army, 1919-1939,‚Äù Office of Air Force History, United States Air Force, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1987, Library of Congress card number 87-12257, , page 124-126. During World War II the group engaged in combat from bases in North Africa and Italy flying B-17 Flying Fortress. In the postwar era, the 2d Bombardment Group was one of the first USAAF units assigned to the Strategic Air Command on 1 July 1947, prior to the establishment of the United States Air Force. Equipped with low- hour B-29 Superfortress surplus World War II aircraft, the group was inactivated in 1952 when the parent wing adopted the Tri-Deputate organization and assigned all of the group's squadrons directly to the wing. Reactivated as the 2d Operations Group in 1991 when the 2d Bomb Wing adopted the USAF Objective organization plan.

The group consisted of the 96th Aero Squadron, which had been operating independently and was equipped with French Breguet 14 B.2 bombers. Three other squadrons, the 11th, 20th and 166th Aero Squadrons were equipped with American-built De Haviland DH-4s.Series \\"C\\", Volume 14, History of the 1st Day Bombardment Group. Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917‚Äì1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. The group completed its organization and began operations on 12 September, however only the 96th, 11th and 20th had received its aircraft at the opening of the St. Mihiel Offensive. Due to its experience, the 96th Squadron was the most effective in combat operations, however the other three squadrons also achieved a high degree of efficiency, gaining experience attacking troop concentrations and communications to interfere with the enemy's movement of reinforcements and supplies to the front. Other patrols of the group were flown by conducting bombing operations that helped to protect Allied ground forces by diverting German pursuit planes from the battle zone. The initial attack by the group on 13 September sent five aircraft of the 96th Squadron to Chambley, but only three managed to cross into enemy territory. They were attacked by fifteen Enemy Aircraft and they approached their objective, which shot down two group aircraft. The objective was successfully bombed, however, and two enemy aircraft were shot down. The first full group action took place the next day with three missions being performed. The railway yards at Conflans-en-Jarnisy, Vittonville and Arnaville were all attacked, along with secondary attacks at √âtain and Dommary-Baroncourt. Nine enemy aircraft were encountered in combat, shooting down one near Mars la Tour. The 11th lost a plane near Chambley. Breguet 14 B.2 bomber of the 96th Aero Squadron Members of the 166th Aero Squadron in front of a De Havilland DH-4 During the offensive large concentrations of enemy aircraft were encountered, giving formidable resistance and great losses due to attempting penetrations of enemy air space with small formations and without protection from pursuit aircraft. On 23 September, operation were moved to Maulan Aerodrome, and on 26 September, Dun-sur-Meuse was attacked by both Bregut and DH-4 Squadrons in the morning, and Etain by the DH-4s in the afternoon. On 9 October 1918, it participated in one of the largest bombing raids of the war, when 353 Allied planes commanded by Gen. Billy Mitchell struck German troop concentrations in the Meuse-Argonne area where German troops were preparing for a counterattack against the Allied offensive. The final bombardment mission of the group took place on 5 November when three formations of DH-4s were dispatched to raid Mousson and Roucourt, Belgium in the morning. Planes from the 11th Squadron failed to cross the lines, however the others reached their assigned objective and at Mouzon, where the weather permitted observation, accurate bomb hits and many fires, with a large number of explosions were noted. Enemy aircraft resistance was strong, with the 20th being attacked by three formations of Fokkers, some with four machine guns, rather than the normal two mounted in front. The 20th managed to shoot down four of the enemy, however, lost three aircraft of their own in the combat. During the remaining days of the war, the 1st Day Bombardment Group was on alert, however bad weather prevented any combat operations from taking place. In more than two months of combat, the group delivered more than 111 tons of bombs on German targets. Demobilized in France on 17 January 1919.Maurer says soon after Armistice was signed, but 11th and 20th stay in Maulan until 17 January, 96th leaving a few days earlier - 166th transferred to Third Army in Dec. =Interwar years= On 18 September 1919, at Kelly Field, Texas, the group was re-organized and formally established as part of the Air Service. On 31 March 1921, the 1st Day Bombardment Group was re-designated the 2d Group (Bombardment), and on 25 January 1923, as the 2d Bombardment Group. From 13 to 21 July 1921, the 2d Group's four bombardment squadrons were detached to General Mitchell's 1st Provisional Air Brigade to conduct controversial tests to determine the efficiency of aircraft against naval warships. The aircraft successfully bombed and sank three ex-German warships, including the formidable 22,437-ton battleship Ostfriesland, off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. From 23 to 26 September 1921, the group's bombardment squadrons, again under the direction of General Mitchell, bombed and sank the ex-Navy battleship in yet another test of aircraft bombardment efficiency. NBS-1 of the 96th Bomb Squadron, April 1926 On 1 July 1922, the 2d group relocated to Langley Field, Virginia, where it would remain for the next twenty years. On 5 September 1923, the group, operating from an improvised aerodrome on the sands near Cape Hatteras, N.C., bombed and sank the ex-Navy battleships and . To further attest the group's capabilities, three 97th Bombardment Squadron Martin B-10B aircraft commanded by Capt. Richard E. Nugent departed Langley Field, Va., and successfully bombed a target 600 miles away in Michigan during the Second Army Maneuvers. This mission, flown almost entirely in inclement weather, garnered the squadron the 1936 Mackay Trophy. Following a devastating crash of the prototype Model 299 in 1935, the group received, on 4 March 1937, the first of 12 B-17 Flying Fortresses delivered to the U.S. Army Air Corps. In response to concerns for the safety of flying the new machine, the pilots of 2d group (including Robert Olds, Robert Travis, Gerald Williams, and Curtis LeMay) developed what would become the modern preflight checklists.How the Pilot's Checklist Came AboutAtul Guwande. The Checklist. The New Yorker, 10 Dec 2007 In February 1938, a goodwill tour to Argentina by six B-17s, (pilots including Olds, Williams, and LeMay), and a flight to Colombia by three B-17s in August of the same year highlighted the late 1930s. The trip to Buenos Aires represented the longest distance performance of its kind on record and won the group the Mackay Trophy in 1938. A second MacKay trophy was won in February of the following year when a crew flew medical supplies aboard the XB-15 to Chile following a catastrophic earthquake. The group also achieved a well-publicized success on 12 May 1938, when three B-17s, led by group commander Lt. Col. Robert Olds and navigated by 1st Lt. Curtis E. LeMay, intercepted the Italian ocean liner Rex over 600 miles at sea during a training exercise. On 6 December 1939, the group was redesignated the 2d Bombardment Group (Heavy). =World War II= Served on antisubmarine duty for several months after the U.S. entered World War II.

This was the third and final phase of training. The 2d Bombardment Group and squadrons left their satellite bases on 13‚Äì14 March 1943 arriving at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey 17‚Äì18 March 1943 for debarkation overseas. The Flight Echelon left the above bases for Morrison Field West Palm Beach, Florida; Natal, Brazil; Marrakech, Morocco and arriving at Navarin, Algeria on 22 April 1943. The Ground Echelon were disbursed at Camp Kilmer in several ships arriving at Casablanca and Port Lyautey in March/April 1943, thence motor and train convoy to Navarin, Algeria. Was initially assigned to Twelfth Air Force. It arrived at Chateau D'un, Algeria on 27 April 1943. The first mission on 28 April 1943 was to Terranova, Sardinia. The 2d Bombardment Group departed Chateau D'un after flying 25 missions and arrived at Ain M'Lila, Algeria on 17 June 1943 and flew 25 missions from that base. The group departed for Massicault, Tunisia on 31 July 1943 and flew 56 missions from that base. 2d Bombardment Group B-17s form up and begin their climb to altitude from Amendola Airfield, Italy, 1944 Missions flown included bombing such targets as marshalling yards, airdromes, troop concentrations, bridges, docks, and shipping. Participated in the defeat of Axis forces in Tunisia, April‚ÄìMay 1943; the reduction of Pantelleria and the preparations for the invasion of Sicily, May‚ÄìJuly 1943; and the invasion of Italy, September 1943. Moved to Italy in December 1943 and continued operations as part of Fifteenth Air Force. Operated primarily from Amendola Air Base in Foggia. Engaged primarily in long-range bombardment of strategic targets in Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Rumania, and Greece. Participated in the drive toward Rome, January‚ÄìJune 1944; the invasion of Southern France, August 1944, and the campaigns against German forces in northern Italy, June 1944 ‚Äì May 1945. En route to bomb an aircraft factory at Steyr, Austria on 24 February 1944, the group was greatly outnumbered by enemy interceptors, but it maintained its formation and bombed the target, receiving a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for the performance. On the following day, while on a mission to attack aircraft factories at Regensburg, it met similar opposition equally well and was awarded a second DUC. Served as part of the occupation force in Italy after V-E Day. Inactivated in Italy on 28 February 1946. Group gunners claimed 279 victories of German and Italian aircraft. Flew 406 combat missions; 146 aircraft lost. =Cold War= On 1 July 1947, the group was redesignated the 2d Bombardment Group (Very Heavy) and activated at Davis Monthan Field, Arizona. Equipped with B-29 Superfortress bombers, the 2d BG became part of the Strategic Air Command. Trained for bombardment missions and deployed to England, August‚ÄìNovember 1948 and February‚ÄìMay 1950. On 10 February 1951 the group became a \\"paper organization\\" with its squadron components attached directly to the 2 Bombardment Wing as part of the Air Force tri-deputate reorganization. Inactivated on 16 June 1952. =Modern era= McDonnell Douglas KC-10A Extender 79-1713 The group was reactivated in on 1 September 1991 as the 2d Operations Group and assigned to the 2d Wing as part of the \\"Objective Wing\\" concept adapted by the Air Force. 2 OG took control of the wings bomber and refueling squadrons upon activation. Trained for global conventional bombardment missions as well as maintaining nuclear operational readiness. Briefly controlled the wing's air refueling mission until it transferred to Air Mobility Command. Provided combat crew training for all USAF B-52 aircrews, beginning November 1994. In response to Saddam Hussein's attacks against the Kurdish minority in northern Iraq, aircrews of the 96th Bomb Sq deployed and launched attacks against military targets in Iraq in September 1996, actions for which the aircrews received the Mackay trophy as the most meritorious flight of 1996. Continued to deploy aircraft and personnel to southwest Asia to support the Allied watch on the southern and northern \\"no-fly\\" zones in Iraq. Flew combat missions against targets in Iraq, 17‚Äì18 December 1998, in response to Iraq's refusal to allow UN weapons inspectors to continue work. Flew combat missions against targets in Yugoslavia, 24 March ‚Äì 9 June 1999, in support of NATO Operation Allied Force. In October 1999 began deploying personnel in support of aerospace expeditionary forces worldwide and maintaining on-call elements at home. Colonel James Kowalski was the Commander of the 2nd Operations Group when they deployed B-52s for combat during operations Noble Anvil and Allied Force from May 1999 - December 2000. =Global War on Terrorism= Boeing B-52H-140-BW Stratofortress 60-014 taking off for the aircraft's 50th Anniversary After the terrorist attacks against the U.S. on 11 September 2001, group elements, including the 20 Bomb Sq, deployed to the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. On 7 October flew early attacks on targets in Afghanistan in Operation Enduring Freedom to rid that country of terrorist bases and its extremist Taliban rulers. Later flew airborne alert missions over Afghanistan and in Operation Anaconda, flew bombing missions against targets in eastern Afghanistan, 1‚Äì18 March 2002. =Invasion of Iraq= In the invasion of Iraq beginning March 2003, flew missions on 21 March in \\"shock and awe\\" strikes against command and control targets.

After receiving an Education and later a Law degree from the University of Puerto Rico School of Law, Rivera Gonzalez gained experience and reputation working in various law-related fields, including the prosecutor's office, Interpol and NIE (Special Investigations Bureau). He was later named Superior Court Judge, a position he held for a large part of his career. After Sila Mar√≠a Calder√≥n was elected governor of Puerto Rico in 2000, she appointed Rivera Gonzalez to be her Secretary of Corrections and later police superintendent, or police chief of the entire Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Rivera Gonzalez, identified with the Popular PPD party, but having no particular loyalties to any of the major parties, was well known and liked by many, if not most of the prisoners soon after becoming Secretary of Corrections, due to his strong support for rehabilitation rather than mere punishment. Rivera Gonzalez would even, on occasion, reward good behavior in his prisons by inviting celebrities like Sugar Ray Leonard for exhibition matches or by creating basketball tournaments among the prisons. Halfway through his tenure, Governor Calder√≥n switched Rivera Gonzalez and Miguel Pereira's posts, making the latter Secretary of Corrections and allowing Rivera Gonzalez to become Superintendent Chief of Police. Rivera would once again find support, this time from most police officers, who felt he was aware of their needs and problems and was not interested in simply moving up politically. Rivera Gonzalez, however, did not complete his 4-year term, leaving on January 6, 2004. He cited economic reasons for leaving public office. Today, Rivera Gonzalez enjoys a less rigorous routine, working at a private Law firm in San Juan, where he specializes in Construction Law. He has been married to actress Gladys Rodr√≠guez for more than 20 years, and two of his children have followed in his footsteps by studying Law as well.

The game focuses on Mickey Mouse, who accidentally damages a world created by Yen Sid for forgotten characters and concepts, and is forced to fix the world while combating antagonists with a paintbrush. Epic Mickey features Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a character created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks and originally owned by Universal Pictures; The Walt Disney Company gained ownership of the character in 2006. The game also marks the first time that Oswald and Mickey appeared together. Epic Mickey was part of an effort by Disney to re-brand the Mickey Mouse character by placing less emphasis on his pleasant, cheerful side and reintroducing the more mischievous and adventurous sides of his personality, focusing on the idea of depicting him as an epic hero. It was directed by Warren Spector, who collaborated with both Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar in conjunction with the project. The game was announced in 2009, and released in November 2010. While the game received average reviews from critics, it has garnered a following in later years. It has successors to the franchise such as Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two and Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion. Gameplay Epic Mickey is primarily a platform game and allows players to use their own solutions for getting through the levels. Epic Mickey features a morality system similar to games like Infamous, Spider-Man: Web of Shadows, and Shadow the Hedgehog. Different alliances, side-quests and power- ups are made available depending on the choices of the player. It is also possible to avoid mini-bosses if specific actions are taken. The in-game currency (E-tickets) are important to these boss fights. The game's key feature is the paint brush, which Mickey wields, that has the ability to draw or erase objects using paint and paint thinner. For example, obstacles can be erased from physical existence using the thinner and then restored using the paint, or enemies can be befriended by revitalizing them with the paint or destroyed completely using the thinner. Mickey is also able to materialize objects from sketches, which have various effects. Two of the three sketches, the watch and the television, slow down time and distract enemies, respectively. Both fluids have limited reserves, adding a strategic element to gameplay: players must compromise between making various tasks harder or easier to accomplish. However, the fluids automatically but slowly refill, and power-ups that quickly replenish the fluids are available in certain areas. Mickey can also find pins in Wasteland. Most are bronze, silver, or gold pins, but some are special: for example, the \\"Art Appreciator\\" or \\"Mean Street\\" pin. Another thing that is useful in the game is a type of currency called E-tickets. These can be given or discovered. They are used to buy concept art, pins, health refills, or paint or thinner refills. To travel between sections of the Wasteland, Mickey traverses 2D side-scrolling levels based on his cartoon shorts (with three being based on Oswald shorts; Trolley Troubles, Great Guns, and Oh, What a Knight and two being based on Sleeping Beauty and Fantasia), such as Steamboat Willie and Clock Cleaners. Synopsis=Setting= The game is set in the Cartoon Wasteland, a pen-and-paper stylised world, created in the game's narrative by the sorcerer Yen Sid, as a place for \\"forgotten things\\", namely disused or obscure Disney characters. It is physically inspired by Disneyland, and appears as an intricate model in Yen Sid's workshop. However, Mickey Mouse's tampering with Yen Sid's magic paint brush and paint thinner causes mass damage to the model, creating a post- apocalyptic landscape. The land is tormented by the evil Blot, a monstrous being loosely based on the Phantom Blot, an antagonist to Mickey in the comic strips created by Floyd Gottfredson. There are also the Beetleworx, mismatched audio-animatronics designed by the Mad Doctor. The Wasteland is split into several locations based on the various lands from Disneyland and other Disney theme parks. Mean Street, is based on Main Street, U.S.A., which is home to Horace Horsecollar and Pete, though other incarnations of the latter appear through the game. The Gremlin Village is inspired by Fantasyland, based primarily around It's A Small World. The attraction's iconic clock tower serves as the first boss battle in the game. Mickeyjunk Mountain is based on the Matterhorn Bobsleds, and is covered in Mickey Mouse toys and merchandise. Other locations include Bog Easy, based on New Orleans Square, which is home to the Lonesome Manor, based on the Haunted Mansion; Ventureland, based on Adventureland; Tomorrow City, based on Tomorrowland; and OsTown, based on Mickey's Toontown, where Clarabelle Cow, and animatronic versions of Goofy, Donald Duck, and Daisy Duck live. =Story= Mickey Mouse, out of curiosity, enters Yen Sid's workshop through a mirror in his house and discovers the model of a land (which resembles Disneyland) that Yen Sid created for forgotten Toons and the tool used to create it, the magic paintbrush. Fiddling with the brush and some paint to make a self-portrait, Mickey accidentally creates the Blot. Panicking, Mickey quickly tries to erase the Blot by throwing paint thinner onto it, but spills more paint on the model in the process. Upon seeing Yen Sid approaching, Mickey quickly tries to clean up the mess, but in his haste, spills thinner onto the paint spillage as he flees back to his house, while the Blot, having survived Mickey's attempt to destroy it, enters through a portal created by the paint/thinner mixture and takes control of the ruined world from its first resident, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. After many decades of fame following the accident, Mickey had forgotten it all until the Shadow Blot enters his home through the mirror and abducts him into the ruined forgotten world, now named by this time as Wasteland. Oswald all the while had his will and his mind twisted from years of hiding and his jealousy of Mickey's rise to fame, unaware of the enigmatic Mad Doctor (who was formerly loyal to Oswald before siding with the Blot) and the Blot's plan to steal Mickey's heart away, which they plan to use to escape the ruined world, as all Wasteland Toons living there are forgotten and can't leave Wasteland since they no longer have hearts of their own. However, Mickey frees himself before they can succeed and scares off the Blot with Yen Sid's brush, forcing the Mad Doctor to flee. Oswald, who was spying on them, also flees after tampering with the Mad Doctor's machines, leaving Mickey to deal with the Mad Doctor's now-hostile mechanical arm. Gus, one of the Gremlins (who serves as mechanics and helpers throughout Wasteland) helps Mickey disable the mechanical arm and escape Dark Beauty Castle, which the Mad Doctor was using as a hideout. Mickey also discovers that he was soaked with some of the Blot's ink. During his journey through the Wasteland, Mickey is guided by Gus and becomes armed with Yen Sid's brush, which grants Mickey the power to spray Paint and Thinner and allows him to erase or paint in toon objects and fight Blotlings and Beetleworx (evil robots built by the Mad Doctor). After traveling through the Gremlin Village and fighting the Clock Tower (who has been driven insane after hearing the song \\"It's a Small World\\" non-stop for decades), he makes it to Mean Street, where the Wasteland Toons mainly reside. Mickey uses the brush to restore the Wasteland in order to atone for his destruction and win Oswald's trust. After passing through Ostown and Mickeyjunk Mountain, they find Oswald, who reluctantly agrees to help Mickey escape. They go to Tomorrow City and find a rocket they can use to leave, but Oswald finds the Mad Doctor has stolen essential parts from it to use for his evil plans, so Mickey goes to collect them. He retrieves the first part after defeating Petetronic (a robotic version of Pete based on Tron from his namesake franchise), the second after defeating a mechanical version of Captain Hook in Ventureland, and confronts the Mad Doctor in the Lonesome Manor. After defeating him, he reveals to have turned himself into an animatronic, which will allow him to survive the Blot's revolt before he is sent flying after Gus removes the last rocket part from his hovercraft. After acquiring all the rocket parts, Oswald has Mickey help repel a Blot attack on Mickeyjunk Mountain. After defeating the foe, it is revealed to Mickey that the Blot that he had just battled, along with all of the Blotlings Mickey had encountered, were only drippings of the real Blot. Oswald reveals that he and his girlfriend, Ortensia, attempted to seal the Blot away, but Ortensia was blighted by the Blot in the process and entered an inert state. When attempting to reconcile, Mickey eventually comes to terms with his actions in causing what the Toons call \\"the thinner disaster\\", and reveals all to Oswald, who loses his temper. While jumping angrily on the cork sealing the Jug, Oswald accidentally causes the cork to break, allowing the true form of the Blot- a giant specter constructed from paint thinner- to escape his prison into the world. The Blot takes Oswald and Gus, threatening to kill them if Mickey does not allow the Blot to take his heart. Mickey yields his heart to the Blot, who then proceeds to further destroy the Wasteland before moving on to the cartoon world (the current Disney universe) to wreak havoc there. After stopping the Blots invasion of the Wasteland, Mickey, Oswald and Gus attempt to use the rocket to reach the Blot, but end up crashing into Dark Beauty Castle after the Blot absorbs the rocket's paint. The Group make their way to the top of the castle, where they defeat the Blot's remaining minions before being swallowed by the Blot itself. The three successfully manage to destroy the Blot, eliminating his exterior with paint-laden fireworks on Dark Beauty Castle, and rescue Mickey's heart from the inside. Oswald reunites with Ortensia and befriends Mickey, the two now possibly bonding with each other as brothers. With the Wasteland now regenerating, Mickey escapes back to Yen Sid's workshop and returns home through the mirror, which becomes sealed by Yen Sid to prevent Mickey from entering again and causing any more mischief. Regardless of the choices Mickey made in the Wasteland (Yen Sid shows Mickey the positive outcomes or consequences of his major choices in the game), the ending after the credits is the same: Not long after the mirror is sealed, Mickey discovers that he still has some of the Blot's ink in him, leaving the possibility he may still be able to reach the Wasteland. Development Designer Warren Spector with writer Peter David, who wrote two of the game's tie-in products, at the game's November 30, 2010 Times Square Disney Store launch party. The creative development team at Buena Vista Games formed the original concept for Epic Mickey in 2003. When the concept was pitched to Bob Iger, then-president and COO, he lamented that Disney didn‚Äôt own the rights to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit and could not produce the game. Upon becoming CEO, he made it a goal to put Oswald under Disney‚Äôs ownership. His chance came in 2006, when television sportscaster Al Michaels expressed interest in joining NBC (which had merged with Oswald owner Universal Pictures by this time) to call play-by-play for Sunday Night Football, even though he had just signed a long-term deal with Disney-owned ESPN to continue on Monday Night Football. Iger initiated a trade with NBC Universal that would allow Michaels to be released from his contract in exchange for the rights to Oswald and other minor assets.Walt Disney's 1927 Animated Star Returns to Disney, a February 2006 press release Disney Interactive Studios was unable to secure a developer for the game until 2007, when Disney acquired Junction Point Studios, Warren Spector's company. The game was originally intended to be released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and its name was its working title. Development on the Wii started in 2008. When the idea of a Wii port of the game was raised, Spector replied that a straight Wii port would not be viable, remarking that many of the \\"design ideas just won't work on the Wii, we need to give the Wii its dues\\". Graham Hopper of Disney Interactive then suggested dropping the development of the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions completely, and instead releasing it solely on the Wii. Compared to the Kingdom Hearts series, a similar video game franchise created by Japanese video game company Square Enix, which combined modern-day Disney characters with their own Final Fantasy characters, Epic Mickey emphasizes retro-vintage and long-lost Disney characters that were created much earlier, and draws more plot elements from the film Fantasia, rather than Final Fantasy; in Kingdom Hearts II, a location in the game was based on the 1920s Steamboat Willie cartoon, but other than that, the rest of the game took its cast from more recently created characters. Mickey receives a character redesign in this game, which attempts to give him a \\"retro\\" look, and the game uses an animation engine to replicate the stretchy athleticism of cartoons. The 2D cinematics were created by Powerhouse Animation Studios, Inc, and the game utilizes Emergent Game Technologies' Gamebryo Engine. Warren Spector has stated that Epic Mickey was planned as a trilogy. An early idea for the game was for Mickey to adopt an angrier look when he was played in the \\"scrapper\\" manner; this idea was dropped after Spector decided it changed Mickey too much from people's perceptions of the character. Mickey looks more smudged instead. Marvel Comics released a prequel comic based on Epic Mickey, titled Disney's Epic Mickey: Tales of the Wasteland. It focuses on Mickey's half-brother Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, and gives some insight on what the Wasteland was like before Mickey's appearance and the thinner disaster. Initially distributed on Disney's Digicomics platform for iOS products, a print version released in late-August 2011. An art book, The Art of Epic Mickey, also released in September 2011. A U.S.-exclusive Epic Mickey Collector's Edition was announced that includes special packaging, special behind-the-scenes DVD, Mickey vinyl figure, a Wii Remote skin, and Wii console skins. The game was leaked by warez groups weeks before its official release date. Epic Mickey marks Oswald's second appearance in video games after F√©rias Frustradas do Pica-Pau (released in Brazil only). The music was composed by American composer James Dooley. In addition his original works, arranged versions of Disney music appears throughout the game, which in turn were recreations of older Disney cartoons. X-Play later named it \\"Best Soundtrack of 2010\\". Dooley's score was released digitally via iTunes and Amazon on December 21, 2010. Promotion D23 Expo 2011.

Present at the party was designer Warren Spector, Peter David, and actors Jennifer Grey and Kyle Massey, who had recently completed the eleventh season of the U.S. Dancing with the Stars, which is broadcast on the Disney-owned ABC. Reception Epic Mickey received average to positive reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. IGN gave it a score of 8/10, criticizing its camera, control issues and lack of voice acting, but praised its charm, story, art design, and lasting appeal for the players. Video game talk show Good Games two presenters gave the game a 6 and 7 out of 10. They compared the paintbrush abilities to that of the water jet pack from Super Mario Sunshine and found it frustrating how the levels reset back to their original state after leaving. But on a positive note they said it \\"isn't as 'dark' or 'adult' as the hype made it out to be... I guess it is a kid's game after all, but at least it's an intelligent one. It doesn't come anywhere near the complexity and fun of something like Super Mario Sunshine, which I think it borrows some ideas from.\\" Shirley Chase from GameZone complimented the game on its usage of Disney history, but added that the game had numerous flaws saying, \\"For all of its good points, Disney Epic Mickey does have some glaring flaws, which can make the game feel like a chore. The most noticeable problem is the camera, which will lead to more cheap deaths than anything else.\\" In a review for GamesRadar, Chris Antista who began the article as an admitted \\"diehard Disney dork\\", praised it as a \\"thoroughly heartwarming salute to Disney\\" and that he hasn't \\"fallen so head over heels with the look, feel, and play of a third-person platformer since the original Banjo-Kazooie\\". G4TV also named it \\"Best Wii Game.\\", Giant Bomb gave a Negative review with 2/5 stars saying \\"Nevermind these heightened expectations, though: even on its own merits, Epic Mickey is a platformer that feels about a generation behind, though one with just enough flashes of inspiration to keep you constantly aware of its wasted potential\\". In its opening weekend, Epic Mickey failed to reach the UK Top 40 and even the Wii Top 10 sales charts after its November 26 UK release.\\"UK Charts: How did Epic Mickey get on?\\" Official Nintendo Magazine, November 29, 2010 On November 30, 2010, the release date in North America, the game was completely sold out on the Disney Store website by the afternoon. The game sold 1.3 million copies its first month.\\"Disney's Epic Mickey video game sells 1.3 million copies in first month\\" Los Angeles Times, January 14, 2011 , the game sold 2 million copies in North America and Europe combined. Sequel On August 27, 2011, Destructoid posted an article that speculated that a sequel, Epic Mickey 2, is in development and showed possible box art for the game. These rumours were further encouraged when Disney France and Warren Spector invited the French media to an \\"epic project\\" taking place on March 27, 2012. Nintendo Power magazine also commented on the rumour, stating that their April 2012 issue would include a \\"top-secret\\" title preview, with the preview for the issue showing a cropped down picture of Oswald The Lucky Rabbit. Gametrailers.com also stated that their March 22, 2012 episode would include a \\"world-exclusive preview of Warren Spector's new epic adventure\\" and that it would be \\"notably significant\\". Warren Spector himself also commented on the game's development, revealing that he had \\"a team of over 700 people working on the sequel\\". Following this, on March 20, 2012 the official French Nintendo magazine posted a comment on Twitter, revealing that Disney had plans to create a companion to the main sequel for the 3DS, under the name Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion. Warren Spector, on March 21, 2012, officially confirmed the rumours, revealing the sequel's title to be Epic Mickey: Power of Two. Spector also directly addressed the camera issues that reviewers criticised in the first game, stating that \\"They'll be working on it until the day we ship the second game. (There have been) over 1,000 specific changes made to the camera. Our goal is that you will not have to touch the manual camera controls even once to play through the main story path of this game.\\" Spector also revealed that the game was to include voice acting and musical numbers, both of which were absent in the first game. Spector said: \\"I'm such a geek about musicals, I love the co-op and next-gen stuff, but for me, when a character breaks into song, which they do on a regular basis in this game, it's magic.\\" Spector also commented on the sequel's co-op features, stating that: \\"It's drop-in, drop-out co-op, you can sit down at any time with a friend who is playing as Mickey, and you can take control of Oswald. If you're playing as a single player, Oswald will be there every second of the game. He's not just a multiplayer character. He's a helper, whether you're playing alone or with a friend or family member.\\" Wasteland itself will feature old areas ruined by earthquakes and other natural disasters, as well as new areas such as one based on Disneyland's Frontierland. It was released on Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation Vita, and Wii U. Due to the sequel's poor sales, which fared even worse than its predecessor, Disney consequently closed down Junction Point and ended all potential for future titles and Disney Interactive Studios shut down in 2016.

The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) in co operation with the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) formed the Australian Institute of Winter Sports after the 1998 Winter Olympics. The organisation was renamed to the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia on 1 July 2001. It provides training in alpine skiing, freestyle skiing (including aerial and mogul), snowboarding, short track speed skating and figure skating. It is also became a partner with the AIS in skeleton (toboganning). It was given a million-dollar annual budget and for the first time, Australia had a federal government-funded full-time training program to accompany the AIS. The inaugural chairman was Geoff Henke who was the Australian Winter Olympic team manager from 1976 to 1994, and who was credited with improving Australia's performance in winter sports by making it a higher priority among his fellow administrators.Gordon, p. 282. This led to a steady rise in the number of Australians who have won medals at World Cup events in the immediate years after the OWIA's creation.Gordon (2003), pp. 282-283. The AOC is the peak body responsible for Australia's participation at the Olympics. Aside from funding the participation at the Olympics, it also provides money for the training and preparation of athletes. This occurs through funding of the OWIA, grants for athletes to travel overseas to compete, and by providing monetary awards to athletes and their coaches if they win medals at World Cup events or World Championships in the lead up to the Olympics. The funding of the OWIA by the AOC varied by year, but has been at per year for over 6 years. Through the Australian Sports Commission, the federal government also sponsors OWIA to the tune of more than a million dollars a year. In 2009, the OWIA lobbied the government to increase its annual budget from to A$29.4m (which is still only a fraction of the A$132m that Canada, the host of the 2010 Olympics is spending.) which was not successful. The OWIA secured an additional A$1m taking its budget to A$3.1m in 2010. Australia aimed to win two medals in 2010; it left the games with 3.

Main entrance to Greka Refinery, Santa Maria, California Greka Energy, legally HVI Cat Canyon Inc., is a privately held company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration principally in Santa Barbara County, California. Formed in 1999 after the acquisition and merger of several smaller firms, it is a subsidiary of Greka Integrated, Inc., a holding company headquartered in Santa Maria, California, and is wholly owned by Randeep Grewal. In May 2011, the company changed its name from Greka Oil & Gas Inc. to HVI Cat Canyon Inc. In June 2019, the company filed bankruptcy after federal and state authorities, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), fined the company for oil spills. Greka focuses on petroleum extraction and asphalt processing in California, with holdings in Santa Barbara, Ventura, Kern, and Orange Counties. It is the largest onshore oil operator in Santa Barbara County. In 2008, after several oil spills, the company was referred to by state and federal officials as \\"California's number one inland oil polluter\\". China-based affiliate When Greka was still a publicly traded company, in 2002 and early 2003, the China operations were part of the firm; Grewal separated them out later as Green Dragon Gas, a public company (GDG on the London Stock Exchange), which is also majority owned and controlled by Grewal. Green Dragon Gas was incorporated in 2006 in Hong Kong, and mainly extracts coal bed methane in China. History Greka was originally named Kiwi III, Ltd, and was created as a Colorado corporation in 1988. This firm, renamed to Petro Union, Inc., filed for bankruptcy in 1996. In 1998, with his newly purchased Horizontal Ventures, which was then a private entity, Randeep Grewal acquired the assets of Petro Union, which was just then emerging from its 1996 bankruptcy filing in Indiana. In 1999, Randeep Grewal acquired the assets of Saba Petroleum, which was founded in 1981, changing the company's name to Greka. Grewal formed Greka Energy by combining these entities in 1999. In an October 2000 interview with The Wall Street Transcript, Randeep Grewal stated that the company's motto was \\"Working for Profits\\". Greka acquired Windsor Energy US Corporation and Rincon Island Limited Partnership in 2002, thereby adding assets in Rincon Island in Ventura County. Also in 2002, it acquired the properties of Vintage Petroleum in northern Santa Barbara County, which included about 110 producing wells on portions of five oil fields, principally in the Santa Maria Valley and the surrounding hills. As of 1999, Greka had holdings in Canada, Colombia, Indonesia, and China, in addition to oil fields and other facilities in California, Texas, New Mexico and Louisiana. In 2003, Randeep Grewal acquired all outstanding shares of the company for $6.25 per share or $32 million. In November 2005, Saba Enterprises filed bankruptcy. Neither the producing operations ‚Äì which included several leases in Santa Barbara County, Rincon Island, Orange County, and Kern County ‚Äì nor the asphalt plant were included in the liquidation filing. Greka appointed former Greka CFO, Andrew deVegvar as president in January 2008. DeVegvar began a \\"Greka Green\\" campaign to counter the perception that the company was environmentally careless. The company also hired corporate security consultant, Tom Parker, a former Sr. FBI agent and Deputy Chief of the Los Angeles Regional Office of the FBI, in order to investigate alleged sabotage at its facilities in late 2007 and early 2008 seemingly timed to coincide with the political meetings regarding Greka. On August 20, 2008, Greka settled a lawsuit brought from the trustees of the owners of the mineral rights to several leases on the Cat Canyon Field. Greka paid $5 million to the trustees through Wells Fargo and Union Bank. At issue was the transfer in 2002 of production from Vintage Petroleum, the original operator hired in 1992, to Greka, which allegedly took place without the trustee's permission. According to Greka, the operations on the three leases on the field were only a small part of its local operations. Due to the decline in oil prices during the Great Recession, Greka laid off 30 people in March 2009, representing about 20% of its staff in the Santa Maria area. Greka changed its name to HVI Cat Canyon, Inc. in May 2011, going back to a name it had used prior to 1999 for its operations on the East Cat Canyon Oil Field. The name \\"HVI Cat Canyon Inc.\\" had been the name of a small subsidiary of Horizontal Ventures, Inc. prior to its 1998 merger with Saba Petroleum Corporation. The entity which resulted from this merger was named \\"Greka Energy\\", a name which it retained until 2011. =Asphalt refinery= Greka Asphalt Refinery on Sinton Road, Santa Maria, adjacent to agricultural fields Greka owns and operates an asphalt refinery northwest of Santa Maria. It sits on of land surrounded by an agricultural area, but within the still- operational portion of the Santa Maria Valley oil field. Greka's heavy oil operations in North Belridge and elsewhere provide feedstock to the refinery, especially when the price of oil is low. The refinery is able to separate heavy oil into distillates and heavy fractions at approximately per hour; the company then ships the resulting product out by truck. Products of the refinery, in addition to asphalt, include naphtha, asphalt emulsion, and gas oil. Some of the distallates are used by regional oil fields as a diluent, aiding in oil recovery. The refinery was constructed in 1935, prior to the creation of zoning laws in the county, which accounts for its unusual position as an isolated industrial parcel within a mostly agricultural area. Previous owners of the refinery included Conoco and Saba. Saba took over the refinery in 1994, closing it while it performed equipment upgrades, and reopening it in 1996. In 1999, Greka acquired the refinery along with Saba's other assets as part of its acquisition of Saba. In the early 2000s the facility was subject to numerous safety audits and facility upgrades, completed in 2004. In 2005, Greka shut the plant down temporarily in a planned 10-year turnaround to upgrade the equipment further, and in November of that year received a permit to process wastewater, which is now used to irrigate surrounding cropland. The asphalt plant functioned as a hedge. When oil prices were high, the company was able to sell on the open market the heavy crude produced from the Cat Canyon, Santa Maria Valley, and North Belridge fields; when the price of oil was low, the company used it instead to make asphalt at its Santa Maria refinery, since asphalt keeps a relatively constant price. In 2002, Greka announced that it had approximately of heavy crude oil recoverable with current technologies. Greka was able to capture this resource since the heavy oil existed in a shallower, neglected reservoir, primarily the contained in the Sisquoc Formation. When the major oil companies ‚Äì Union, Conoco, Shell, and others ‚Äì extracted oil in the Santa Maria Valley from the 1920s to the 1980s, the company mainly pumped from the deeper formations with lighter oil which was more valuable; when the company pulled out of the county in the 1980s and 1990s, it left behind considerable reserves of difficult-to-extract heavy oil, which however made good feedstock for the asphalt refinery. =Onshore oil production= Greka lease on the North Belridge Oil Field; oil wells and steam injection apparatus are visible in the distance. As of the beginning of 2009, Greka ran onshore oil production facilities in four California counties: Santa Barbara, Kern, Ventura, and Orange. In Santa Barbara county, the company actively produced oil from the Santa Maria Valley, Casmalia, Zaca, and Cat Canyon fields. Greka operates wells at the North Belridge Oil Field in Kern County, the Casmalia Oil Field, Cat Canyon Oil Field, Zaca Oil Field, and Santa Maria Valley Oil Field in Santa Barbara County, and the Richfield Oil Field in Orange County. =Rincon Island former operations= Central area of operations on Rincon Island Rincon Island, California, is a small artificial island about a mile offshore from Punta Gorda in Ventura County. It is in state waters in the eastern portion of State PRC Lease 1466 in the Rincon Oil Field. Greka acquired it in 2002 with the purchase of Rincon Island Ltd. Partnership; the island itself dates from 1958. Also in early January 2008, Greka through Rincon Partnership voluntarily shut down the causeway leading to the Rincon Island facility so that it could repair damage to the pilings caused by the El Nino storms. Consequently, production from the Rincon Island was suspended (as no other method of moving oil to shore was available). Rincon Partnership has promised to repair the causeway. At the beginning of 2009, there were 20 active oil wells within the approximately area enclosed by the berm. Rincon Island Limited Partnership, the subsidiary of the company that held the assets in Rincon Island, filed bankruptcy in 2016 to block California from forcing the company to perform extensive remediation on its wells amid environmental concerns. In December 2017, the bankruptcy trustee gave ownership of the property to the state via quitclaim deed. Oil spills and environmental compliance issues Oil spill on a hillside on the Bell Lease, Cat Canyon Field, showing pipeline. Partially cleaned oil spill along Palmer Road, near Santa Maria, California. The asphaltic material throughout the photograph is weathered crude oil; a containment boom is visible at left center, and two pipelines run along the right of the picture. In 1999, Greka began operations in Santa Barbara County by acquiring the aging infrastructure left behind by companies that were pulling out of the county to pursue better opportunities. In 2009, only Chevron Corporation was left of the major companies; Aera Energy LLC, a joint venture of Shell and Mobil, also retained some operations at the Cat Canyon Oil Field. Between 1999 and 2008, the Santa Barbara County Fire Department responded to over 400 waste leaks and spills at Greka. According to EPA Superfund Division employee Robert Wise, speaking to the Associated Press, \\"I've been in the hazardous materials business for 20 years and this is the worst oil company I've ever seen.\\" Fines, legal action, and EPA investigations have all resulted from the numerous releases at Greka facilities. In 2008, a Fish and Game official called Greka the worst inland oil polluter in California. On June 1, 2006, The EPA fined Greka $127,500 for improperly disposing of industrial wastewater by injecting it into disposal wells on its Union Sugar and Morganti Leases in the Santa Maria Field, not far from its refinery. While some water disposal is permitted in wells ‚Äì indeed, wastewater is often used to recharge oil reservoirs to improve recovery ‚Äì industrial wastewater is considered to be a greater danger to drinking water and must be treated differently, and can only be injected into wells meeting specific criteria. Injecting such water into Class II wells is a violation of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974. In June 2007, the company was fined $1 million for violating the Safe Drinking Water Act. The EPA and the DOJ determined that Santa Maria Refining Company disposed of contaminated wastewater into wells that were not permitted for that use, posing a risk to groundwater supplies. The company was also sentenced for making false statements to the EPA. On December 7, 2007, Greka spilled over of oil at its Bell Lease in the East Cat Canyon Oil Field along Palmer Road southwest of Santa Maria. Greka's attorney, however, claimed that some of the recent spills were the work of an eco-terrorist at large. Pipes and wires were cut, valves were opened, and alarms disabled. Some of the wires had been cut with a crimping device. Attorney Robert O'Brien also emphasized that Greka is meticulous in its reporting of the exact amount spilled, unlike other operators in the county. A spill occurred on January 5, 2008 at the Zaca-Davis tank battery in the Zaca Oil Field, along Zaca Station Road. Approximately of oil and produced water overflowed the containment area ‚Äì escaping the large secondary containment through an open drainage pipe ‚Äì and contaminated about one mile (1.6 km) of Zaca Creek. Greka claimed that this spill was also the result of sabotage. On January 15, 2008, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors held a hearing and 25 Greka employees attended. Greka had spilled approximately of liquids in the county ‚Äì both oil and produced water, a total of about ‚Äì in the four years from 2003, when the company went private, to the end of 2007, while it also had the largest number of active wells. In 2008, Greka launched the \\"Greka Green\\" initiative, intending to establish itself as an environmental leader in the Santa Barbara County petroleum industry. As part of this initiative, it would repair or remove much of the decaying infrastructure which had been responsible for many of the leaks, spills, and releases that had brought the company to the attention of regulators and the public. The EPA removed Greka's contractor from the cleanup effort in February 2008, stating that Greka and its contractors were inefficient and incompetent, and repeatedly \\"failed to meet federal standards.\\" In particular, the EPA found that Greka employees were covering spilled oil in the creek with fresh soil, rather than removing it; therefore EPA removed them from the cleanup exercise. Greka dismissed its cleanup contractor in March, and the contractor the company hired to replace them failed the EPA's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Standards (HAZWOPER), so EPA dismissed them, and carried out the cleanup themselves. On the same day that the EPA dismissed Greka from its own cleanup, February 1, Congresswoman Lois Capps wrote in a letter to the EPA: \\"Given the apparent haphazard manner in which the Greka sites are managed and the devastating effects this mismanagement is having on the local environment, it is crucial that EPA continue working with appropriate federal, state, and local agencies to put an end to this intolerable situation.\\" Greka countered that the EPA's action had effectively prevented the company from finishing its own cleanup efficiently and on time. In October 2008, EPA took over the cleanup of a Greka spill for the third time, this one at the Gato Lease in the Cat Canyon Oil Field and stated that it would seek to have Greka reimburse its expenses. In February 2008, Assembly Bill 1960 was introduced in the state legislature, largely in response to spills at Greka. It was approved in September 2008. On January 21, 2009, Greka sued Santa Barbara County, California, alleging that it used its \\"repeat offenders\\" rule to shut down non-polluting facilities along with polluting ones, a situation Greka maintained was unconstitutional. The County agreed with Greka that the retroactive application of the rule would be unconstitutional. The remaining claims were dismissed by a U.S. District Court. On July 10, 2009, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, at a meeting in Watsonville, California, recommended Greka be referred to the Attorney General of California for prosecution due to its repeated waste spills. In 2008 alone, Greka had spilled more than of waste (oil and produced water); Greka had spilled more than a since going private in 2003, resulting in over 400 hazardous materials teams responses; the firm had been fined more than $2.6 million by the different regulatory agencies during this time. In March 2011, Greka agreed to pay $2 million between 2011 and 2014 as compensation for the series of spills which occurred in late 2007 and early 2008, events which included more than 1,700 violations. Additionally, Greka promised to improve its infrastructure to make future spills less likely, including reinforcing containment structures. On June 17, 2011, the DOJ, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and California Regional Water Quality Control Board filed suit against Greka in Federal court in Los Angeles for having failed to comply with the requirements of the Clean Water Act, citing 21 oil and contaminated water spills between 2005 and 2010. The amount sought was in excess of $2.4 million. In Santa Barbara County, from 2015 through 2017, there 161 notices of violation of which, 145 were directed toward Greka, which also received 35 of the 36 fines that were levied. In May 2018, the company was fined $12.5 million for 1,500 operating violations at an oil field located in Orange County. It was the highest fine ever levied in the history of the California Department of Conservation. In December 2018, EPA officials served search warrants at Greka facilities on Sinton Road. In February 2019, the EPA ordered the company to conduct sampling to determine whether its operations resulted in contaminated local soil and groundwater. In August 2019, the company had a leak from a tank at its asphalt refinery on Sinton Road. In November 2019, up to 10 barrels of oil leaked from a facility of the company on Black Road in Santa Barbara County. Public relations In Santa Barbara County, the company has occasionally hired retired County Supervisor Mike Stoker as a spokesman. In 2018, Stoker went to work for the EPA. In 2008, the company hired Tony Knight from the public relations firm Sitrick and Company.

The sole species, Rhyzopertha dominica, is known commonly as the lesser grain borer, American wheat weevil, Australian wheat weevil, and stored grain borer.Rhyzopertha dominica (Fabricius). Crop Protection Compendium. It is a beetle commonly found within store bought products and pest of stored cereal grains located worldwide.Edde, P. A. (2012). A review of the biology and control of Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) the lesser grain borer. Journal of Stored Products Research, 48(1): 1-18. It is also a major pest of peanuts. The first documentation of wheat infestation by R. dominica was observed in Australia. R. dominica are usually reddish brown to dark brown in coloration, vary in sizes, elongated and cylindrical.  Identification  The average R. dominica are 2.1 - 3.0 mm in length. Their body displays a reddish brown coloration with 11 antennae segments and a 3-segmented antennal club. The pronotum is located near the base of the body with no depressions. In addition, the basal part of the pronotum has a wrinkled appearance. Distinct tubercles on the R. dominica are found on the anterior margin, but appear to be slightly apart at the median. Moreover, it has clear elytral strioles that are angularly rounded at the apex, and short, yellowish, bent setae. Externally there are no major recognizable differences between male and female adults of R. dominica.  Distribution and Diversity  The geographical origin of R. dominica is still uncertain, however the scientific community has agreed that the Indian subcontinent is its most probable native home, as the region is inhabited by other bostrichid species. Currently, R. dominica has a worldwide distribution, especially in warmer temperate climates zones, between latitude 40¬∞ North and South from the equator. It is predominantly found in forested and grain storage environments. As such, human interaction has aided in the widespread of R. dominica through the commercial transportation of grain. A testament to their inhabitation of grain is the acquisition of the name ‚ÄúAustralian Wheat Weevil‚Äù, symbolizing their predominant infestation of wheat in Australia.  Taxonomy  R. dominica is from the family Bostrichidae, commonly referred to as auger or powderpost beetles. Currently the family consists of 550 bostrichid species, of which 77 of them are found in North America. Bostrichids can be distinguished from other beetles due to their rasp-like pronotum, 5-segmented tarsi and straight antennae with 3-3 segments. The genus Rhyzopertha is monotypic, consisting of only R. dominica. Further classification of this genus places it within the subfamily Dinordeinae.  Diet  There are various substrates that make up the resources and diet for the R. dominica. This includes grains, such as rice, wheat, sorghum, oat, pearl, millet, malt barley from the family Poaceae, and chickpeas, peanuts and beans from the family Leguminosae. Although most insect prefers foods such as trees and dried fruit, R. dominica seems to be preadapted for feeding on dry grains. It feeds on the whole grain in both larval and adult stages.  Courtship Behaviour and Reproduction  R. dominica follows a 4-stage life cycle: egg, larval, pupal, and adult. The mating behaviour in the R. dominica follows within 24 hour after the individual hatches from the egg. The females do not display any courtship behavior such as initiation of mating or attempt to attract male beetles. In some instances, the males will attempt to mate with other males, whereas this type of interaction is absent in females. Female attraction to the male occurs upon physical contact, whereby the close proximity allows for the olfactory senses to detect the male produced pheromones. The pheromones are also responsible for the attraction between male beetles. Stimulation from the pheromones is characterized (in both male-to-male and male-to-female interaction) by an excited and rapid walking motion; the head, thorax, and antennae are extended forward and up, in the direction of the pheromone source. When they are around a pheromone source, the beetles walk around with their antennae extended and they actively palpate the abdominal area. The males will initiate a palp mediated mating response and mount the beetle if it were a female. This occurs after he touches his maxillary palp to the tips of her elytra. While mounting the female, the male moves to the posterior dorsal surface. The male walks forward and taps lightly on top of the female's elytra and thorax with his palpi. Contact with the vagina is made when the last sternite of the male beetle is lowered and the aedeagus protrudes to the vagina. Once the male is firmly mounted, copulation has been achieved. Copulation lasts for 2 hours and can occur multiple times in R. dominica, as females require more than one mating to fertilize effectively all the eggs produced during her lifetime. Externally there are no major recognizable differences between male and female adults of R. dominica. A reported minor difference is the last ventral abdominal sternite of the female, seen as pale yellow as compared to the uniformly brown males.  Infestation  Maximum reproductive success is achieved on dry grains, such as wheat, explaining the infestation issue it causes from residual insect populations in grain storages and immigration from outside. These products, which are stored in bulk, are understood to be human created ecosystems with a stable microclimate suited to fit the pest's needs.Cordeiro, E. M., Campbell, J. F., & Phillips, T. W. (2016). Movement and orientation decision modeling of Rhyzopertha dominica (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) in the Grain Mass. Environmental Entomology, 45(2): 410-419. These ecosystems allow females to deposit their eggs loosely within the grain mass and allows the first larva to enter the kernel.(Coleoptera: Bostrichidae). The Canadian Entomologist, 148(1): 8-21.Jia, F., Toews, M. D., Campbell, J. F., & Ramaswamy, S. B. (2008). Survival and reproduction of lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.)(Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) on flora associated with native habitats in Kansas. Journal of Stored Products Research, 44(4): 366-372. The larva after undergoing 4 larval instar development, will emerge from the kernel as an adult.Limonta, L., & Locatelli, D. P. (2016). Effect of flour and pasta debris on larval development of Rhyzopertha dominica. Bulletin of Insectology, 69(1): 127-130. The duration of development takes up to 35 days, with optimal conditions of 28 ¬∞C and 50% humidity. Once it reaches adulthood, they have difficulty moving on flat and smooth surfaces, due to reduced friction, and as a result are unable to access food.Pires, E. M., Nogueira, R. M., Pina, D. S., Manica, C. L. M., Faroni, L. R. A., & Moreira, P. S. A. (2016). Walking stability of Rhyzopertha dominica (Fabricius, 1792)(Coleoptera: Bostrichidae). Brazilian Journal of Biology, 76(3): 568-576. Therefore, the grain mass is the most suitable for them due to their diet of grain based products, which can facilitate the appearance of more fungi and pests.Sol√†, M., Lundgren, J. G., Agust√≠, N., & Riudavets, J. (2017). Detection and quantification of the insect pest Rhyzopertha dominica (F.)(Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) in rice by qPCR. Journal of Stored Products Research, 71(1): 106-111. At the adult life stage, R. dominica flies to the surface of the grain mass and slowly works its way downward through the grain mass as far at 12m, further than other grain beetles. Together with the deep movement into the grain mass and the cryptic feeding on the kernels, it can becomes difficult to detect initial R. dominica infestation. Overtime, because of R. dominica infestation, a sweetish odor is left within the infested grain as a result of the aggregation pheromones produced by males. A large amount of frass is also produced from adult feeding activities, containing ovoid granules of undigested endosperm mixed with a finer flour, larvae exuvae, feces, fragments of immature insects, and various by products affecting the overall quality of the grain. Adult and larval stages of R. dominica feed on the germ and endosperm. This degree of feeding can vary with the age of the beetles, with the highest amount of feeding done by young adult beetles.  Natural Enemies  Various predaceous organisms are capable of coexisting with R. dominica, such as mites, bugs, and parasitoids that are also found infesting stored grain. Two hemipterans, found in the family Anthocoridae, four mites from the families Acarophenacidae, Pediculoidae, and Cheyletidae have all found to attack R. dominica within the storage, including five parasitoids from the families Bethylidae and Pteromalidae. All of these predators attacked the eggs or larval stage rather than the adult or pupal stage. Mortality of R. dominica can also occur because of nematodes, fungi, protozoans and bacteria, acting as predators, while harming the larval and adult stages.  Flight  The flight capacity of R. dominica has not been researched thoroughly, however, R. dominica is capable of flight. This, aside from human intervention, permits their widespread spatial distribution between isolated resources. They boast an impressive flying capacity as it has been observed to fly over 5 km from an infested location. Moreover, winds and wind drift can substantially assist in dispersal. The attraction to pheromones can additionally aid them to fly upwind to the pheromone sources, possibly stimulated by pheromone molecules, without which dispersal is reduced.  Control =Physical= Commercial and agricultural methods are being implemented to manage infestation and pest control of R. dominica. Approaches includes minimizing pest migration and build-up within grain storage areas, through thorough cleaning of the equipment before harvest, sealing storage, spraying bins and units, and cleaning up any grain spills. Close monitoring of the temperature in storage areas is a crucial step of managing, as it can influence the insect population. Harvested wheat temperatures ranging from 27 ¬∞C to 34 ¬∞C degrees is optimal for insect reproduction and growth. R. dominica are more vulnerable to the cold than other grain pests. Temperatures below 15 ¬∞C are unfavourable for R. dominica to maintain their bodily activities. To compensate, they become dormant, but this greatly increases their susceptibility to death at temperatures of 2 ¬∞C or lower. Thus, aeration or grain drying, where grain is mechanically ventilated, can also be used to manage infestation through the maintenance of low temperatures in storage areas. Unfortunately, R. dominica cannot be completely controlled solely with aeration. Although it is recommended for quality of grains, feasible and effective in reducing insect growth rate, damage from fungi and moisture. =Biological= Predation by natural enemies of R. dominica, arthropod species, are insufficient methods of biological control due to their low numbers as compared to fecundity of R. dominica. Moreover, the natural predators and parasitoids can fall prey themselves to other types of organisms, which is quite disadvantageous. This in tandem with their deep burrowing feature, which allows them to successfully escape predation and risk, allows for effective R. dominica proliferation. =Chemical= Insecticide grain protectants worldwide are also ineffective for R. dominica management. Many of these protectants are either not effective or the pest has grown resistance to them. The protectant include organophosphorus insecticides such as chlorpyrifos methyl, fenitrothion, pirimiphos methyl and malathion. When infestations become severe, fumigation is a suggested form of control. The fumigant phosphine is key to controlling R. dominica since it targets all insect life stages, is easy to utilize, effective, feasible, and is a residue- free tactic. Unfortunately, due to active dispersal, R. dominica has distributed resistance genes to certain fumigants and insecticides.Ridley, A. W., Hereward, J. P., Daglish, G. J., Raghu, S., McCulloch, G. A., & Walter, G. H. (2016). Flight of Rhyzopertha dominica (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae)‚ÄîA spatio- temporal analysis with pheromone trapping and population genetics. Journal of Economic Entomology, 109(6): 2561-2571. Other alternatives such as the use of ozone as a fumigant is also being tested on immature stages, larvae or pupae, which are more prone to being effected as compared to adults.Subramanyam, B., Xinyi, E., Savoldelli, S., & Sehgal, B. (2017). Efficacy of ozone against Rhyzopertha dominica adults in wheat. Journal of Stored Products Research, 70(1):53-59. Aside from the evolution of resistance, the internal feeding technique of R. dominica confers protection from potential insecticides by creating safe spaces and shelter within the grain mass.Velasquez, L. P. G., Faroni, L. R. D. A., Pimentel, M. A. G., Heleno, F. F., & Prates, L. H. F. (2017). Behavioral and physiological responses induced by ozone in five Brazilian populations of Rhyzopertha dominica. Journal of Stored Products Research, 72(1): 111-116. Further studies suggest that fumigants are not the only method of detecting and pest management implemented in the grain industry. Research shows that soft x-ray methods are also being used to identify potential infested wheat kernels.Karunakaran, C., Jayas, D. S., & White, N. D. G. (2004). Detection of internal wheat seed infestation by Rhyzopertha dominica using X-ray imaging. Journal of Stored Products Research, 40(5): 507-516.

Exhibited in September 1983, it was the world's first true battery-powered laptop computer. Dulmont was a joint venture between Dulmison and an Australian subsidiary of their electrical utility customer the Belgian National Electricity Authority, Tramont Ltd. The Magnum was sold from 1983 to 1986. The company found itself undercapitalized as it sought to enter the international market and faced increased competition from other laptops. It was taken over twice, with Dulmont eventually taken over in 1984 by Time Office Computers (Manufacturing) Pty. Ltd. Development and promotion The initial concept was hatched in 1981 by Clive Mackness. He was then no. 2 to owner Philip Dulhunty at Dulmison and assigned Dulmison freelancing engineer David Irwin the task of designing a product. Terry Crews and others were brought into the team that spent the first months on feasibility. John Blair led the software engineering team. Development dragged on and the project was in danger of folding due to Dulmison's limited financial resources but was revitalised when Mackness secured a A$800,000 federal government grant. The Magnum was to have been enabled by a custom power management integrated circuit that was to be developed in the VLSI and Systems Technology Laboratory at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) over 4 months in early 1982 by Graham Hellestrand. The ~10,000 transistor, 5Œº nMOS technology chip, however, never saw the light of day. Terry Crews was the initial Engineering Manager and contracted Barry Wilkinson to design the hardware based on discrete components as he had doubts about the custom chip. The form factor and cosmetic design was developed first and this then dictated the physical dimensions of the hardware. This was in contrast to the usual method of encasing the electronics as the last process and their subsequent bulkier designs. The Dulmont joint venture having been formed in 1982 and with the benefit of a cash injection of about A$1.5 million from Tramont, the Magnum went into production, Crews became Marketing Manager and the engineering role was taken over by Chris Todter. Crews traveled the world showcasing the product. It attracted substantial interest and some large orders. The Magnum was marketed in Australia from 1983 to early 1986, thus being developed and launched prior to the development of the Grid Compass. The Magnum was launched publicly at the 10th Australian Computer Conference on same day that Australia won the America's Cup in September 1983. Design and features The Magnum was one of the first computers to use the 16-bit Intel 80186 processor, and was sold in versions with 96K to 256K of RAM, and inbuilt LCD screens from 8x80 to 25x80 characters. It had a word processor, spreadsheet, telecommunications, file manager, and appointment programs burned into ROM. It also featured dual 128K ROM cartridge slots, which could be used for optional software including BASIC or assembler programming support, as well as serial and parallel modem and printer ports.

Earlier versions were able to be upgraded to the larger displays, and a dual 5.25\\" floppy drive and memory expansion box provided access to up to 256KB of dynamic RAM. Applications were stored in ROM (A:) and also supported removable modules in expansion slots (B: and C:) that could be custom programmed EPROM or standard word processing and spreadsheet applications. The Magnum could suspend and retain memory in CMOS battery- backed RAM (RAM Disk D:). There was even an expansion box providing 10MB of hard disk storage. In 1985, the Magnum retailed for for a 96K model, or for a 256K model.. Demise Dulmont, a complete newcomer to electronics, let alone computer, manufacturing, suffered numerous production problems. The product had endemic faults and deliveries were delayed. The reputation of the product went from enthusiastic anticipation to disappointment. The Magnum laptop computer was similar to the Hewlett-Packard HP 110 and the Sharp PC-5000 and is the only Australian produced laptop personal computer, but did not survive long on the international market once industry players like HP, Sharp and Sanyo entered the market. One key disadvantage of both the Dulmont Magnum [Kookaburra] and the Grid Compass is that they were developed prior to the IBM PC and were never upgraded to full IBM compatibility, using an early version of MS-DOS (latest version used was 2.11). A second disadvantage of the Magnum was the lack of integral permanent storage other than the ROM/EPROM that was available through the module cartridge slots, or the separate expansion box. In particular, its soon-to-arrive competitors (including the Grid Compass) made use of the new bubble memory technology to provide non-volatile memory.

The tower is headquarters to Multi-Purpose Holdings Berhad, MPI Generali Insurans Berhad, Alliance Bank, and Bandar Raya Developments Berhad.  History  Menara Multi-Purpose was developed by Bandar Raya Developments Berhad (BRDB) and was completed in 1994. Menara Multi Purpose was designed by John Portman & Associates and Jurubena Bertiga International. It was initially envisaged to be part of a greater Capital Square commercial development. However, the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis stalled other components of the project, leaving the Menara Multi Purpose building the only completed structure then, surrounded by several partially completed and abandoned structures (including a second office tower). However, now Capital Square, or CapSquare as it has known, is a fully integrated neighbourhood with a second office tower, retail centre, a luxury residential tower and a second luxury residential tower recently launched. Menara Multi- Purpose was headquarters to its developers, BRDB, who have now moved to a new headquarters, Menara BRDB, in their homeground of Bangsar. In December 2016 the building was purchased by the Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) (KWAP), the second largest pension fund in Malaysia. With the sale price of RM474.3 million (US$107.25 million), this was the largest office building sale in the country in 2016.

Sexual activity without consent is considered rape or other sexual assault. In the late 1980s, academic Lois Pineau argued that society must move towards a more communicative model of sexuality so that consent becomes more explicit and clear, objective and layered, with a more comprehensive model than \\"no means no\\" or \\"yes means yes\\". Many universities have instituted campaigns about consent. Creative campaigns with attention-grabbing slogans and images that market consent can be effective tools to raise awareness of campus sexual assault and related issues.Thomas KA, Sorenson SB, Joshi M. \\"Consent is good, joyous, sexy\\": A banner campaign to market consent to college students. Journal of American College Health. 2016; 64(8):639-650 In Canada \\"consent means‚Ä¶the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in sexual activity\\" without abuse or exploitation of \\"trust, power or authority\\", coercion or threats. Retrieved March 13, 2015. Consent can also be revoked at any moment. Since the late 1990s, new models of sexual consent have been proposed. Specifically, the development of \\"yes means yes\\" and affirmative models, such as Hall's definition: \\"the voluntary approval of what is done or proposed by another; permission; agreement in opinion or sentiment.\\" Hickman and Muehlenhard state that consent should be \\"free verbal or nonverbal communication of a feeling of willingness' to engage in sexual activity.\\"Hickman, S.E. and Muehlenhard, C.L. (1999) '\\"By the Semi-mystical Appearance of a Condom\\": How Young Women and Men Communicate Sexual Consent in Heterosexual Situations', The Journal of Sex Research 36: 258‚Äì72. Affirmative consent may still be limited since the underlying, individual circumstances surrounding the consent cannot always be acknowledged in the \\"yes means yes\\", or in the \\"no means no\\", model. Elements of consent Within the scholarly literature, definitions surrounding consent and how it should be communicated have been contradictory, limited or without consensus. Dr James Roffee, a senior lecturer in criminology in the Monash University School of Social Sciences, argues that legal definition (see Legal concept of consent) needs to be universal, so as to avoid confusion in legal decisions. He also demonstrates how the moral notion of consent does not always align with the legal concept. For example, some adult siblings or other family members may voluntarily enter into a relationship, however the legal system still deems this as incestual, and therefore a crime. Roffee argues that the use of particular language in the legislation regarding these familial sexual activities manipulates the reader to view it as immoral and criminal, even if all parties are consenting. Similarly, some minors under the legal age of consent may knowingly and willingly choose to be in a sexual relationship. However, the law does not view this as legitimate. While there is a necessity for an age of consent, it does not allow for varying levels of awareness and maturity. Here it can be seen how a moral and a legal understanding do not always align. Some individuals are unable to give consent, or even if they can verbally indicate that they consent, they are deemed to lack the ability to make informed or full consent (e.g., minors below the age of consent or an intoxicated person). People may also consent to unwanted sexual activity.Quinn-Nilas, C, Goncalves, M, Grant, A, & Kennett, D. (2018). '\\"A thematic analysis of men's sexual compliance with unwanted, non-coercive sex.\\" Psychology Of Men And Masculinity, 19(2): 203-211. In Canada, implied consent has not been a defence for sexual assault since the 1999 Supreme Court of Canada case of R v Ewanchuk, where the court unanimously ruled that consent has to be explicit, instead of merely \\"implied\\". In the United States, the defense may have a chance to convince the court that consent was in some way implied by the victim. Many actions can be perceived by the court as implied consent: having a previous relationship with the alleged rapist (e.g. befriending, dating, cohabitating, or marrying),Balos, Beverly, and Mary Louise Fellows. \\"Guilty of the Crime of Trust: Nonstranger Rape.\\" Minn.

Crim. L. & Criminology 74 (1983): 1518. =Unwanted sexual activity= Unwanted sexual activity can involve rape or other sexual assault, but it may also be distinguished from them. Jesse Ford, the author of a 2018 study that showed that men are having unwanted sex with women to \\"prove they are not gay\\", states that \\"[a]ll sexual assault is unwanted sex, but not all unwanted sex is sexual assault.\\" A 1998 study showed that both men and women \\"consen[t] to unwanted sexual activity\\" in heterosexual dating; in these cases, they consented to unwanted sex to satisfy their partner, \\"promote intimacy\\", or avoid tension in the relationship\\".O'Sullivan, Lucia F., Allgeier, Elizabeth Rice. \\"Feigning sexual desire: Consenting to unwanted sexual activity in heterosexual dating relationships\\". p. 234-243. The Journal of Sex Research. Volume 35, 1998 - Issue 311. https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499809551938The authors argue that estimates of \\"unwanted (nonconsensual) sexual experiences\\" may confound nonconsensual sex and consensual sex. =Verbal vs. nonverbal= While different consent policies have differing views on whether non-verbal cues count as consent, some rules do permit seeking consent through non-verbal communication. There can be verbal or nonverbal consent, or a mix of the two types, depending on different policies and laws. According to Bustle writer Kae Burdo, the maxim \\"only verbal consent counts\\" is limited, in that it fails to accommodate parties that can only consent non-verbally, such as people with disabilities and those in BDSM communities . Dartmouth College's rules on consent state that a communication in intimate encounters is often nonverbal cues such as smiling, nodding, and touching another person; however, it states that \\"...body language often isn't enough\\" because interpreting body language is risky, so the best option is to use \\"explicit verbal communication\\". The New York Times reports that men typically use nonverbal indicators to determine consent (61 percent say they perceive consent through a partner's body language), but women typically wait till a partner verbally asks them before they indicate consent (only 10 percent say they indicate consent through body language), a differing approach that may lead to confusion in heterosexual couples' encounters. Mary Spellman, the dean of students at Claremont McKenna College, states that her college allows either verbal or non-verbal consent, with non-verbal consent being assessed by looking at whether the other person is \\"actively participating\\" and touching the other person when he is touching her or encouraging the first person\\", signs which indicate that a \\"...person is an active participant in whatever is going on.\\" The Daily Dot states that verbal consent is best because both participants can clearly indicate what they want, ask questions and seek clarification; in contrast, nonverbal consent may not be clear, as people \\"...have different understandings of gestures, ‚Äúvibes,‚Äù and nonverbal cues\\", which can lead to \\"ambiguity and misunderstanding\\". Lisa Feldman Barrett, a psychologist and neuroscientist, states that in a sexual consent context, \\"[f]ace and body movements aren‚Äôt a language\\" that participants can rely on, because the human \\"brain is always guessing\\" about how to interpret smiles and expressions; as such, \\"...facial movements are terrible indicators of consent, rejection and emotion in general\\" and they are \\"not a replacement for words.\\" =Age= Children or minors below a certain age, the age of sexual consent in that jurisdiction, are deemed not able to give valid consent by law to sexual acts. The age of consent is the age below which a minor is considered to be legally incompetent to consent to sexual acts. Consequently, an adult who engages in sexual activity with a minor younger than the age of consent cannot claim that the sexual activity was consensual, and such sexual activity may be considered statutory rape. The person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim and his or her sex partner is regarded as the offender, unless both are underage. The purpose of setting an age of consent is to protect an underage person from sexual advances. Age of consent laws vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, though most jurisdictions set the age of consent in the range 14 to 18. The laws may also vary by the type of sexual act, the gender of the participants or other considerations, such as involving a position of trust; some jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other, rather than a single age. Jennifer A. Drobac, who teaches law at Indiana University, states that young adults aged 16 to 21 should only be able to \\"offer ‚Äúassent‚Äù to sex with a significantly older person\\", rather than consent, but then \\"permit them to revoke that assent at any time\\". =Mental disabilities or conditions= Likewise, persons with Alzheimer's disease or similar disabilities may be unable to give legal consent to sexual relations even with their spouse. New York does not consider it to be consent in cases where people have a physical disability that makes them unable to communicate that they do not consent, either using words or physically or if they have a mental illness or other mental condition that makes them unable to understand the sexual activity. South Carolina has a 10-year penalty for a person who has sex with a person who is mentally challenged or incapable of movement. Law professor Deborah Denno argues that people with some types of mental challenges should be able to consent to sex; she says they \\"...have the right to do so, and unnecessarily broad and moralistic restrictions infringe upon that right\\".Deborah W. Denno, Sexuality, Rape, and Mental Retardation, 1997 U. Ill. L. Rev. 315 (1997) Available at: https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/faculty_scholarship/121 =Unconsciousness or intoxication= In some jurisdictions, individuals who are intoxicated from alcohol or drugs cannot consent. For example, Michigan Criminal Sexual Conduct Laws states that it is a crime to have sex with a ‚Äúmentally incapacitated‚Äù person who cannot control their conduct or consent. In Canada, intoxication is a factor that affects whether a person can legally consent to sexual activity. However, the level of intoxication that will make consent impossible varies according to circumstances, which include how intoxicated the person is and whether they voluntarily consumed the alcohol or drugs. The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that a person drunk to the point of unconsciousness cannot consent to sex; the court ruled that once a person loses consciousness, they cannot consent. There was public outrage after a Canadian judge ruled that an intoxicated person can consent; however, a legal expert interviewed by CBC stated that \\"a drunken consent is still a consent\\" under Canadian law. In Canada, a judge ruled in the 2011 R v JA case that a person who is asleep or unconscious cannot consent to sex. =Position of trust or authority= When determining if a sexual encounter was consensual, Canadian courts will consider if the accused was in a \\"position of trust or authority\\" regarding the complainant, as this undermines consent. While this general principle is part of Canadian law, the courts are debating exactly what the definition of a position of trust and authority is. Some examples of people in positions of trust or authority include a teacher, employer or boss, camp counselor, health care professional, or coach. =Deception and deceit= Sexual encounters where one party uses deception or deceit to obtain consent could be non- consensual. As such, if A gives consent to have sex with B, but B has lied about a pertinent issue, A has not given fully informed consent. Deception could include false statements about using contraception, age, gender, whether one is married, religion or employment, sexually transmitted infections testing status, giving the impression that one is someone's partner, or that one is single, and falsely making the person think that a sexual activity is some type of medical procedure. Examples include a California man who snuck into the bedroom of an 18-year-old woman right after her boyfriend left the bedroom, so she thought he was her boyfriend; an Israeli man who lied and told a woman he was a pilot and a medical doctor to have sex with her; and a US man who falsely claimed to be an NFL football player as a way to get sexual encounters. In Alexandra Sims' article entitled \\"Trans people could 'face rape charges' if they don‚Äôt declare sexual history, warns trans activist\\" she states that the UK Sexual Offences Act requires transgender people to tell partners about their gender history as part of its requirements that people making sexual consent decisions have access to information so that they can make informed consent about whether to have sex; trans activist Sophie Cook states that the law is an infringement on trans peoples' human rights and on their privacy. Education initiatives and policies=General= Performers of Catharsis Productions act out scenarios in which a man acts inappropriately toward a woman during the play 'Sex Signals.' The goal of the play is to also help armed forces members understand what consent is and that 'no means no'. A flyer posted at Oberlin College encourages students to establish ongoing and reciprocal consent during sexual activity Initiatives in sex education programs are working towards including and foregrounding topics of and discussions of sexual consent, in primary, high school and college Sex Ed curricula. In the UK, the Personal Social Health and Economic Education Association (PSHEA) is working to produce and introduce Sex Ed lesson plans in British schools that include lessons on \\"consensual sexual relationships,\\" \\"the meaning and importance of consent\\" as well as \\"rape myths\\", while the Schools Consent Project delivers sexual education workshops to pupils aged 11‚Äì18, covering topics such as harassment, revenge porn and sexting. In the U.S., California-Berkeley University has implemented affirmative and continual consent in education and in the school's policies. Retrieved March 13, 2015. In Canada, the Ontario government has introduced a revised Sex Ed curriculum to Toronto schools, including new discussions of sex and affirmative consent, healthy relationships and communication. Retrieved March 10, 2015. Many universities have instituted campaigns about consent. Creative campaigns with attention-grabbing slogans and images that market consent can be effective tools to raise awareness of campus sexual assault and related issues.Thomas KA, Sorenson SB, Joshi M. \\"Consent is good, joyous, sexy\\": A banner campaign to market consent to college students. Journal of American College Health. 2016; 64(8):639-650 The Guardian reported that Oxford and Cambridge have added sexual consent workshops; one such workshop included a \\"quiz about the rates of sexual or gender crimes\\" and a discussion of three fictional \\"scenarios of sexual contact\\", including a story of groping at a party, a relationship in which one partner stopped participating, but the other person, who was sexually excited, continued to proceed to new sex acts, and a case in which a couple was drunk and had sex. The aim of the workshop was to consider if consent was asked for and obtained in these scenarios. While Sydney University has introduced an online sexual consent course, Nina Funnell states that it has been criticized by students, professors and sexual assault prevention leaders as \\"tokenistic\\", inexpensive, and ineffective in changing student attitudes or actions. Some UK universities are launching bystander intervention programs that teach people to intervene when they see potential sexual misconduct situations, for example, by moving a male friend at a party away from an intoxicated woman he is talking to, if she seems unable to consent to his advances. One challenge with bystander education programs is that a study has shown that white female students are less likely to intervene in a hypothetical situation where they see an intoxicated black woman being led towards a bedroom at a party by a non-intoxicated male, as white students feel \\"less personal responsibility\\" to help women of colour and they feel that the black woman is deriving pleasure from the situation. =\\"No means no\\"= A FEMEN activist holds a sign reading \\"Non=Non\\", French for \\"no=no\\", at a 2012 protest. The Canadian Federation of Students (CFS) created the \\"No Means No\\" campaign in the 1990s to increase awareness by university students about \\"sexual assault, acquaintance rape, and dating violence\\" and decrease the incidence of these issues. The CFS developed a ‚ÄúNo Means No‚Äù campaign that included research on sexual assault and producing and distributing buttons, stickers, posters and postcards with the slogan and other information. According to the CFS, \\"No Means No\\" to set in place a no tolerance approach to sexual violence and harassment and educate students about these issues. Concerns about the \\"no means no\\" approach developed, however, because some people cannot say no, either because they are not conscious, intoxicated or facing threats or coercion, with the coercion issue being especially important in cases where there is a power imbalance between two people in a sexual encounter. To address these concerns, there was a shift from 'no means no' to 'yes means yes' (affirmative consent), to ensure that people were not having sexual actions taken on them due to not speaking up or not resisting. Amanda Hess states that a person may not be able to say no, or they may be intoxicated or passed out, or they may freeze up from fear. Sherry Colb criticizes the \\"no means no\\" approach on the grounds that it makes sexual contact the \\"default\\" option when two people have agreed to be in private in a date-like situation, at least until the woman says \\"no\\" to the other person's advances. Colb says that under the \\"no means no\\" approach, a man who is in private with a woman in a romantic context can undress her and penetrate her if she does not say \\"no\\", even if she is staring ahead and saying and doing nothing, which Colb says treats being quiet or not moving as an invitation to sex. She says that under a \\"no means no\\" approach, there is not a metaphorical \\"Do Not Trespass\\" sign on a woman's body, and as such, women have to fear that accepting a date and being in private with the partner could lead to unwanted sex. Dr. Ava Cadell suggests that women in sexual encounters tell their partner that they want to use a code expression or safe word to tell the other participant to stop the sexual contact, such as \\"Code Red\\". She says the words \\"no\\" and \\"stop\\" \\"have been used frivolously, playfully, and teasingly in the past and are not always taken seriously.‚Äù =Affirmative: \\"yes means yes\\"= A logo for the \\"yes means yes\\" campaign. Affirmative consent (\\"yes means yes\\") is when both parties agree to sexual conduct, either through clear, verbal communication or nonverbal cues or gestures. Retrieved March 10, 2015. With \\"yes means yes\\", a person can still say \\"no\\" after an initial yes. \\"Yes means yes\\" was developed by a group of women at the US liberal arts school Antioch College in 1991, who \\"...successfully petitioned for a conduct-code amendment that explicitly defined sexual consent as requiring an enthusiastic ‚Äúyes‚Äù from everyone involved. Prior to this, sex was considered consensual as long as neither party said ‚Äúno.‚Äù\\" (the \\"no means no\\" approach). As of 2014, at Antioch College, students must \\"...get explicit verbal permission before making any sexual advance\\", asking \\"'Can I do this?' And the [other] person has to respond verbally, 'Yes.' And if they don't, it's considered nonconsent, and that's a violation of...[college] policy\\"; a pre-arranged hand signal can also be used if the students made a \\"prior verbal agreement\\". The \\"yes means yes\\" approach involves communication and the active participation of people involved. This is the approach endorsed by colleges and universities in the U.S.,\\"...affirmative consent standards have been adopted at colleges across the nation, including every Ivy League university except Harvard. \\"Affirmative consent: A primer\\" Christine Emba Washington Post Oct 12 2015 https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2015/10/12/affirmative- consent-a-primer/ who describe consent as an \\"affirmative, unambiguous, and conscious decision by each participant to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity.\\" Claremont McKenna College Dean of Students Mary Spellman says \\"yes means yes\\" can be expressed nonverbally by determining \\"[i]s the [other] person actively participating?...Are they touching me when I am touching them? Are they encouraging me when I'm doing various different things? Those would all be signs that the person is an active participant in whatever is going on.\\" According to Yoon-Hendricks, a staff writer for Sex, Etc., \\"Instead of saying 'no means no,' 'yes means yes' looks at sex as a positive thing.\\" Ongoing consent is sought at all levels of sexual intimacy regardless of the parties' relationship, prior sexual history or current activity (\\"Grinding on the dance floor is not consent for further sexual activity,\\" a university policy reads). By definition, affirmative consent cannot be given if a person is intoxicated, unconscious or asleep. There are three pillars often included in the description of sexual consent, or \\"the way we let others know what we're up for, be it a good-night kiss or the moments leading up to sex.\\" They are: # Knowing exactly what and how much I'm agreeing to # Expressing my intent to participate # Deciding freely and voluntarily to participate To obtain affirmative consent, rather than waiting to say or for a partner to say \\"no\\", one gives and seeks an explicit \\"yes\\". This can come in the form of a smile, a nod or a verbal yes, as long as it's unambiguous, enthusiastic and ongoing. Denice Labertew of the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault says that while the words used in \\"yes means yes\\" may vary, the main idea is that both people are agreeing to do sex acts. She says that \\"yes means yes\\" requires a major change in how we think of sexual assault, as it requires men and women to agree to and actively participate in sex. T.K. Pritchard says that even after consent is given, participants in an encounter should be \\"constantly checking in\\", and that there should be checking in before sexual contact, during sex, and after sex, to ensure consent was given. Lauren Larson states that a person should check in with their sex partner before kissing or sex, and also, even during sex, when they change the speed of an action, switch to a different position, or move their hands to a new body area. Even in a \\"yes means yes\\" paradigm, if a partner asks in a way where there is not room for a \\"no\\", or if they get a no and then use guilt to manipulate the person, that can be considered sexual coercion rather than consent; other examples include if a partner seeking sex complains that their need for sex is not being met, shows passive-aggressive behaviour, or persistently asks again and again until they get a \\"yes\\". Conn Caroll states that social conservatives may support the \\"yes means yes\\" laws, as the increased risk of being found guilty of sexual misconduct will lessen student interest in \\"hook up culture\\" and create an incentive for men to form long- term, committed relationships with women, rather than just seeking out one- night stands. 2015 Green River College video on consent, endorsing the \\"only yes means yes\\" approach on campus In a Time article, Cathy Young states that the California \\"yes means yes\\" law is unlikely to make sexual predators less likely to attack or keep victims safe; she says it creates unclear and capricious rules on sexual activity and moves the burden of proof to those who are accused, who are typically male. Young states that when the San Gabriel Valley Tribune asked a lawmaker how an innocent accused person could prove that he obtained consent, she was told ‚ÄúYour guess is as good as mine.‚Äù A judge overruled a University of Tennessee-Chattanooga ruling that a male student did not obtain consent; the judge wrote that \\"...[a]bsent the tape recording of a verbal consent or other independent means to demonstrate that consent was given, the ability of an accused to prove the complaining party's consent strains credulity and is illusory\\". Robert Shibley notes that Jonathan Chait has expressed concern that colleges with \\"yes means yes\\" rules are removing due process; Shibley argues that fairness and consistency are needed in disciplinary systems; he states that even though college tribunals are not law courts, they still have elements of court trials, as they are based on an allegation, an investigation is done, a hearing is held, evidence is brought forward, sentences are handed down, and there is an appeal that can be made. Shibley states that accused do not have core protections and he states that the college does the investigation, judges the case in the trial, and hears the appeal, which means there is not a separation of functions. Camille Paglia calls \\"yes means yes\\" laws \\"drearily puritanical\\" and totalitarian.Paglia, Camille. Free Women, Free Men: Sex, Gender, Feminism. Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, p. 273 In \\"Consent: It‚Äôs Not Sexy\\", Victoria Campbell criticizes affirmative consent on the grounds that it \\"...values proof and evidence over the lived experience of those involved\\" and it turns sex into a contractual activity in a manner akin to the way marriage traditionally provided contractual consent to sex. Sarah Nicole Prickett criticizes affirmative consent because these rules are premised on the idea of feminine passivity; under this cultural paradigm, she says that if a woman shows sexual interest during an encounter, she is seen as \\"slutty or crazy\\" or as showing \\"too much\\" sexuality. In \\"When Saying ‚ÄòYes‚Äô Is Easier Than Saying ‚ÄòNo‚Äô\\", Jessica Bennett says that one challenge is \\"gray zone sex\\" where a woman says yes to an initiator in a sexual encounter when she \\"desperately\\" means \\"no\\", engaging in what she calls \\"begrudgingly consensual sex\\" because saying yes is easier than explaining a \\"no\\" or exiting the situation, and because Western culture teaches women to be \\"‚Äònice‚Äô and ‚Äòquiet‚Äô and ‚Äòpolite\\" and to \\"protect others‚Äô feelings\\" at the expense of the woman's own feelings and desires. Julianne Ross states that in a Western society where sexual narratives focus on male desire, what women want can be deemed less important; as such, in this context, women in heterosexual encounters may feel a pressure to say yes to certain sex acts for fear that they may be criticized as a \\"prude\\" if they do not agree, or because the women want to fit into social expectations in their group, or because they are seeking validation. Enthusiastic consent A variant of \\"yes means yes\\" consent is enthusiastic consent. Project Respect states that \\"positive sexuality\\" needs to start with enthusiastic consent\\" in which a person is as \\"excited and into someone else‚Äôs enjoyment\\" a they are, an engaged partner. Planned Parenthood says that enthusiastic consent can be seen when a partner is \\"...happy, excited, or energized\\". Australia's NSW Minister for the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Pru Goward has called for an enthusiastic consent, which has been defined as an approach that helps to ensure that both participants want to be in the encounter. A sexual assault survivor who supports the enthusiastic consent model states that \\"...if it's not an enthusiastic yes, then it's not enough.\\" Dr Nicola Henry stated that \\"legislating and determining \\"enthusiastic\\" [consent] in a court would be challenging. Benedict Brook defines \\"enthusiastic consent\\" as ‚Äúyes mean yes‚Äù with more vigour and with \\"constant checking in between partners that all is well.\\" Gaby Hinsliff, in a The Guardian article entitled \\"Consent is not enough: if you want a sexual partner, look for enthusiasm\\", states that \\"enthusiasm, the unmistakable sense of not being able to keep your hands off each other [in an encounter]...is harder to mistake for anything else. And if it was there, but suddenly evaporates ‚Äì well, you could always ask what‚Äôs wrong. If those two words kill the mood dead, it almost certainly wasn‚Äôt the right mood to start with.\\" It is \\"...meant to help clarify the places at which [sexual] initiators unintentionally and sometimes unknowingly cross from sexual experience to sexual assault.‚Äù In Robyn Urback's article \\"To McGill activists, a 'yes' doesn't mean consent\\", she states that the \\"Forum on Consent hosted at McGill suggests that a meek ‚Äúyes,‚Äù or a nonchalant ‚Äúyes,‚Äù or a ‚Äúyes‚Äù without emphatic body language does not constitute consent. According to the panel ‚ÄúIt must be loud and clear\\"\\". Charles Sturt University's sexual consent program leader Isabel Fox, an enthusiastic consent advocate, says that \\"Our tag [slogan] is 'It is not a yes unless it's a hell yes'.\\" The \\"enthusiastic consent\\" model has been criticized by asexual people and sex workers, as people in these categories may choose to have sex with people even though they are not \\"particularly wanting it or enjoying it themselves\\".Barker, Meg John. The Psychology of Sex. Routledge, 2018. Lily Zheng states that while enthusiastic consent is good theory, it is a \\"nightmare in real-life intimacy\\" and she says that since it cannot \\"...move beyond guesswork, cues and assumptions [it] plays right into normative ‚Äî straight, white, cisgender, middle-class ‚Äî ideas about society\\", which means it does not work well for Asians, blacks, queer communities and other racial or sexual minorities. Zheng states that the enthusiastic consent model is \\"so vague\\" that \\"determining whether or not a real interaction was ‚Äúenthusiastic‚Äù or not becomes next to impossible\\". Julianne Ross states that consenting adults may have sex that they both want to have without giving \\"enthusiastic consent\\", such as couples having sex to get pregnant or couples who want to please each other. One challenge with getting people to give enthusiastic consent in the bedroom is that women may be reticent to speak about their sexual desires because of a fear that they may be \\"slut-shamed\\". Robert Tracinski asks \\"how can you tell if she is saying yes with sufficient enthusiasm?\\"  Legislation = Coercion-based versus consent-based laws = In legal theory, there are two main models in legislation against rape and other forms of sexual violence: # The coercion-based model 'requires that the sexual act was done by coercion, violence, physical force or threat of violence or physical force in order for the act to amount to rape'; # The consent-based model 'requires that for the act to qualify as rape there must be a sexual act that the other one did not consent to'. The primary advantage of the coercion-based model is that it makes it difficult to make a false accusation of rape or assault, and thus provides decent protection to the legal position and social reputation of suspects who are innocent. This line of reasoning stems from a time (dating at least as far back as the 18th century) when sex was regarded as a private matter that the state and society should mostly not interfere with, and concerns about sexual violence were mostly limited to male-on-female rape, which was firstly regarded as an offence to public morality, especially the female victim's family (her father, husband or master). In the decades of the later 20th and early 21st century, the focus of sexual violence has shifted towards individual sexual autonomy, the scope has broadened beyond the act of intercourse, the set of potential victims and perpetrators has been expanded to include all genders, strangers as well as acquaintances and people close to the victims including intimate partners and even spouses, while social and legal attitudes have changed in favour of more active societal and state intervention in sexual violence and the attainment of justice. Individuals and human rights organisations increasingly criticised the coercion-based model for a variety of reasons, such as the requirement for the victim to actively resist an assault (thereby failing to address cases where victims are unconscious, intoxicated, asleep or suffer from involuntary paralysis ‚Äì also known as \\"freezing\\" ‚Äì due to fear or other state of helplessness, and thus unable to resist an assault) or not wear certain kinds of clothes to not 'provoke' an assault (shifting the responsibility for the crime from the perpetrator unto the victim), or the focus on physical violence (thereby failing to consider that a perpetrator sometimes needs to use little to no physical violence in order to conduct an assault, e.g. when the victim is unconscious, intoxicated, asleep or involuntarily paralysed; and also failing to address mental and psychological harm caused by rape and assault). The consent-based model has been advocated as a better alternative for enhanced legal protection of victims, and to place a larger responsibility on potential perpetrators to actively verify or falsify before initiating sex whether a potential victim actually consents to initiating sex or not, and abstaining from it as long as they do not. = International standards, definitions and jurisprudence = As of 2018, a consensus is emerging in international law that the consent-based model is to be preferred, stimulated by inter alia the CEDAW Committee,For example, in its General recommendation No. 35 of 2017, Part IV, recommendation no. #33: 'Ensure that the definition of sexual crimes, including marital and acquaintance/date rape is based on lack of freely given consent, and takes account of coercive circumstances.' the UN Handbook for Legislation on Violence against Women, the International Criminal Court and the Istanbul Convention. However, there were no internationally agreed upon legal definitions of what constitutes sexual consent; such definitions were absent in human rights instruments. Istanbul Convention Article 36 remarks that '[c]onsent must be given voluntarily as the result of the person's free will assessed in the context of the surrounding circumstances'. Rule 70 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence (published in 2002) of the International Criminal Court (which rules on military conflicts between states) gives a summary of illegitimate inferrals of consent which defendants might try to use to claim they had consent: > Rule 70: Principles of evidence in cases of sexual violence > In cases of sexual violence, the Court shall be guided by and, where > appropriate, apply the following principles: :(a) Consent cannot be inferred > by reason of any words or conduct of a victim where force, threat of force, > coercion or taking advantage of a coercive environment undermined the > victim‚Äôs ability to give voluntary and genuine consent; :(b) Consent cannot > be inferred by reason of any words or conduct of a victim where the victim > is incapable of giving genuine consent; :(c) Consent cannot be inferred by > reason of the silence of, or lack of resistance by, a victim to the alleged > sexual violence; :(d) Credibility, character or predisposition to sexual > availability of a victim or witness cannot be inferred by reason of the > sexual nature of the prior or subsequent conduct of a victim or witness. The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) of the United States Armed Forces provides a definition of consent and examples of illegitimate inferrals of consent in ¬ß 920. Art. 120. \\"Rape and sexual assault generally\\" (g) 7 and 8: > (7) Consent.‚Äî :(A) The term ‚Äúconsent‚Äù means a freely given agreement to the > conduct at issue by a competent person.

Participation in the Bel√©m do Par√° Convention, the Maputo Protocol and the Istanbul Convention combined. In 2003, the European Court of Human Rights ordered all 47 Member states of the Council of Europe (CoE) to take a consent- based approach to cases of sexual violence on the grounds of Article 3 and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This was the result of its ruling in the M.C. v. Bulgaria case, namely: 'In accordance with contemporary standards and trends in that area, the Member States' positive obligations under Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention must be seen as requiring the penalisation and effective prosecution of any non-consensual sexual act, including in the absence of physical resistance by the victim.' The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples‚Äô Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa (Maputo Protocol) was adopted by the African Union (AU) in 2003 (in effect since 2005), which stipulates that 'States Parties shall take appropriate and effective measures to enact and enforce laws to prohibit all forms of violence against women including unwanted or forced sex whether the violence takes place in private or public.' Thus, 'unwanted sex', separately from 'forced sex', was recognised as a form of violence against women that is to be effectively prohibited by all 55 member states. In the 2006 Miguel Castro-Castro Prison v. Peru case, applying to all 35 Member states of the Organization of American States (OAS), the Inter-American Court of Human Rights stated the following: 'The Court, following the line of international jurisprudence and taking into account that stated in the Convention to Prevent, Punish, and Eradicate Violence against Women [Bel√©m do Par√° Convention], considers that sexual violence consists of actions with a sexual nature committed with a person without their consent (...)'. The Council of Europe's 2011 Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention) contains a consent-based definition of sexual violence in Article 36. This mandates all Parties that have ratified the Convention to amend their legislation from a coercion-based to a consent-based model. Since the Istanbul Convention entered into force in August 2014, some Parties have fulfilled their obligation for sexual violence legal reform; as of April 2020, 26 Parties had yet to do so, while 12 signatories still needed to ratify the Convention first. Belgium already had a consent-based definition since 1989, the Republic of Ireland already since 1981, with a further amendment passed in February 2017. The United Kingdom's four constituent countries England and Wales (one jurisdiction), Northern Ireland and Scotland separately introduced consent-based legislation in the 2000s despite the UK not having ratified the Convention as of 2018. In 2013 and 2016 respectively, Croatia and Austria have introduced separate laws for sexual violence committed by coercion and sexual violence committed by lack of consent, treating the latter as a lesser offence with a lower maximum penalty. = Countries that switched from coercion-based to consent-based laws = thumb400px thumb300px thumb300px *1981: Republic of Ireland (amendment in February 2017) *1989: BelgiumBelgian Penal Code Article 375 (introduced on 4 July 1989): 'Rape is every act of sexual penetration of any nature and by any means, committed against a person who did not consent to it.

A bill was approved by the Spanish government in March 2020, the parliamentary debates on the exact wording were expected to take several months. *Denmark (government intention since November 2018, repeated in July 2019). In April 2017, the Parliament of Denmark rejected a consent-based bill, citing lack of evidence that a consent- based definition was needed. Another attempt failed in November 2018, but a new bill similar to the Swedish example passed in May 2018 gained supported in March 2019, and the new Danish government confirmed its intention to introduce such legislation in July 2019. *Netherlands (government intention since May 2019) *Finland (government intention since June 2019, recommendation expected May 2020) *Greece (included in yet to be introduced new penal code in June 2019) = Countries with mixed legislation = *2013: Croatia ** Sexual intercourse without consent accompanied by force constitutes rape, carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment (art. 153 Croatian Criminal Code) ** Sexual intercourse without consent without force (e.g. when a victim is unconscious, intoxicated or asleep) constitutes a lesser offence, carrying a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment (art. 152(1) Croatian Criminal Code) *January 2016: Austria ** Sexual intercourse committed by force, threat or deprivation of liberty constitutes rape, carrying a maximum of 10 years imprisonment (art. 201 Austrian Criminal Code) ** Sexual intercourse against a person's will constitutes a lesser offence, carrying a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment (art. 205a Austrian Criminal Code) = Legislation in the United States = The United States do not have a uniform legal definition of sexual violence, as states may define this differently, but on the federal level the FBI's Uniform Crime Report (UCR) amended its definition of rape on 1 January 2013 from the coercion-based \\"carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will\\" to the consent-based \\"Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim\\", removing the requirements of force, the victim to be female, and the penetration to be vaginal. Some U.S. states (or other jurisdictions such as American Samoa) recognise penetrative sex without consent by the victim and without the use of force by the perpetrator as a crime (usually called 'rape'). Other states do not recognise this as a crime; their laws stipulate that the perpetrator must have used some kind of force (physical violence (that results in demonstrable physical injury), threats against the victim or a third party, or some other form of coercion) in order for such nonconsensual penetrative sex to amount to a crime. Similarly, some states (or other jurisdictions such as the Military) recognise non-penetrative sex acts (contact such as fondling or touching a person's intimate parts, or exposure of a body or sexual activity) without consent by the victim and without the use of force by the perpetrator as a crime, while other states do not. Responses=Consent contracts= In 2003, sex therapist Dr. Ava Cadell suggested that celebrities and professional athletes ask partners in sexual encounters (she uses the slang term \\"groupies\\") to sign a sexual consent form, which she calls the sexual encounter equivalent of the prenuptial agreements that are signed before some marriages. Dr. Cadell says that like a prenup, a sex contact can reduce litigation. The advocacy group named The Affirmative Consent Project is providing 'sexual consent kits' at US universities. The kits include a contract which the parties can sign, stating that they consent to having sexual relations. The kits suggest that the couple take a photo of themselves holding the contracts. NYU law professor Amy Adler commented about the depiction of consent contracts in the novel Fifty Shades of Grey; she states the signing of the legal contract before sex could help to avoid uncertainty in sexual encounters. In Emma Green's article about the film, entitled \\"Consent Isn‚Äôt Enough: The Troubling Sex of Fifty Shades\\", she disagrees with consent contracts as a solution on the grounds that \\"even explicit consent\\" may not be enough in hard-drinking college dorm environments where most students have little experience with negotiating sexual permission. Toronto sexual consent educator Farrah Khan disagrees with the idea of consent involving a signature on a contract, as she argues that it is an \\"ongoing conversation\\" that involves listening to one's sexual partner. David Llewellyn, who started the Good Lad Initiative at Oxford University, says that consent contracts could give participants the mistaken sense that once the consent contract is signed, they cannot withdraw consent and stop the encounter. Llewellyn states that even with a signed consent contract, both partners should ensure ongoing enthusiastic consent to sex, because he says consent is fluid and changeable. =Consent apps= In the 2010s, smartphone apps have been developed to give couples the ability to electronically consent to sexual relations. Apps include We-Consent, Sa-Sie, LegalFling and Good2Go. LegalFling uses blockchain and sets out each person's terms and conditions, such as requiring condom use or agreeing to specific acts. However, concerns have been raised about these \\"consent apps\\". The Good2Go app gives a record of sexual consent that the company claims can be used as evidence of consent and capacity, from an intoxication perspective, for consent; however, the app was removed from sale because both men and women did not like clicking on a smartphone in the bedroom to record their consent. A lawyer states that legally, apps are redundant and could only serve as circumstantial evidence, because they generally do not take into account a person's right to withdraw consent at any point in the sexual interaction. In Reina Gattuso's article entitled \\"Seven reasons consent apps are a terrible idea\\", she criticizes consent apps on the grounds that: a person can withdraw consent at any point, including minutes after clicking yes on the app; the binary yes or no approach of the apps simplifies the complexity of consent; the app cannot legally confer agreement to each change in sex acts; they make consent too much about legal proofs and setting down evidence; and they change what should be a continuous process of communication into a quick action. Cricket Epstein states that using consent apps have a \\"victim-blaming\\" mentality that suggests that the person who is asked to click on the app may become a false accuser; as well, she says the app may protect perpetrators, because once agreement is clicked on the app, it will be harder for a complainant to say that she or he had sex acts done without consent. =Consent culture= Activists and educators promote \\"consent culture\\" by setting up consent education programs to publicize issues and provide information, hiring consent educators (or volunteers), using consent captains or consent guardians in entertainment venues, and introducing initiatives such as safety code words for bar patrons experiencing unwanted sexual attention. Some activists on campus hold \\"consent days\\" where there are panels and discussions on sexual consent and hand out t-shirts and condom packages with pro-consent messaging to build awareness. At Whitman College, students founded All Students for Consent, which answers students' questions about seeking consent in intimate encounters. Consent educators The US non-profit organization Speak About It (SAI) hires consent educators to lead workshops on \\"sex, sexuality, relationships, consent, and sexual assault\\" for high-school and college students. SAI consent educators have included gender studies and women's studies students, university graduates interested in social justice, sexual health educators, domestic violence prevention advocates, and theater professionals. SAI's hiring for the consent educator positions is inclusive of diverse \\"gender identities, racial backgrounds, sexual orientations, and sexual experiences.\\" Yale University hires Communication and Consent Educators, who are students who lead workshops and training and start conversations about sex and consent. Jaclyn Friedman is a sexual consent educator known for editing Yes Means Yes: Visions of Female Sexual Power and a World Without Rape. In January 2018, sexual consent educator Jaclyn Friedman wrote an article about the news commentary regarding comedian Aziz Ansari and sexual consent. Friedman called for the need to \\"better educate young people in this country about sex, consent, and pleasure\\" by using consent education to teach about sexual communication, awareness of body language, and the need for checking in (if it not clear that the partner is enjoying the activities). The Consent Academy in Seattle is a collective of sex therapists, counsellors and educators who teach \\"consent culture\\", provide one-one-one consultations, review consent policies, and provide \\"consent advocates\\" for hire. Consent staff in venues The Victoria Event Center has hired a Tanille Geib, a sexual health educator/intimacy coach, to serve as Canada's first ‚Äúconsent captain‚Äù and stop sexual harassment and sexual assault at social activities. The consent captain intervenes if she sees people who are getting stared at, harassed, or touched without consent. She talks to the person who is feeling uncomfortable and then, if the first person agrees, speaks to the individual whose conduct is unwanted. Like a regular bouncer, the consent captain warns the person engaging in unwanted behavior that those acts are not tolerated in the venue; if the unwanted acts continue, she may \\"eventually ask them to leave\\". The consent captain also checks on people who are intoxicated, to prevent people from taking advantage of their impaired state. Since the consent captain is, in this case, a sexual health educator, she is better able to notice risk situations regarding consent and harassment that regular bouncers might not notice. Geib says that since the #Me Too movement, people have become aware that \\"there‚Äôs this whole grey cloud area around what acting in consent and consensual relationships are.‚Äù Geib says that her role is not to police the patrons, but is rather to start conversations about creating a \\"consent culture\\". In Seattle, the Consent Academy hires out \\"consent advocates\\" for events and parties, who act to deter incidents and to help those who experience unwanted contact. The House of Yes nightclub hired a \\"consenticorn\\", a staffer who acts as a \\"dance-floor monitor\\" (also called a \\"consent guardian\\") for the venue. The consenticorns roam the venue during the sex-themed party wearing a lighted unicorn horn (to aid guests in finding the consent staffer), distribute condoms and ensure that guests comply with the rules on condom use and mandatory \\"express, verbal consent\\" for all physical contact. The consenticorns were trained by Emma Kaywin, a sexual-health educator; the goal is not to \\"police but [rather] to educate\\" the clubgoers. Arwa Mahdawi from The Guardian praised the House of Yes' initiative, saying the \\"...stricter we are about consent, the more fun everyone can have.‚Äù Slovenian philosopher Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek states that the consenticorn approach does not understand \\"human sexuality\\" as these venues are \\"creating spaces that fail to acknowledge the nuances of intimacy and pleasure\\" by enforcing \\"tight control\\" that is delegated to an \\"external hired controller\\". As well, ≈Ωi≈æek asks how the consent guardians will be able to tell the difference between \\"consensual sadomasochism\\" and exploitative\\" behaviour. Safety code words For bar patrons who are feeling uncomfortable with the behavior of their date, such as a person who is getting touched without their consent, some venues have a safety code system that enables patrons to alert staff. Some bars have posters in washrooms and drink coasters informing patrons that if they need to signal a bartender that they feel unsafe with their date (or any other bar patron), they can use a codeword (a fictional mixed drink name, for example), and then bar staff will escort the patron out of the venue to make sure they get safely to their taxi. =Intimacy coordinator= In the television and film industry, in 2018, some production companies are hiring an \\"intimacy coordinator\\" to ensure that actors and actresses' consent is obtained before shooting romantic scenes and simulated sex scenes. To address concerns about the \\"vulnerability...and the massive power balance that can happen when a powerful showrunner or director asks an actress or actor...to get naked and simulate sex for the camera\\", HBO hires an intimacy coordinator for these scenes. The intimacy coordinator is a mix of an acting coach (who makes sure that scenes look realistic) and an advocate for actors and actresses who ensures that the onscreen performers' boundaries are respected and that their physical and emotional comfort is protected. Other views Legal scholar Robin West stated in a 2000 article that the use of consent as an ethical premise for life decisions may increase happiness in the world, except for women. She states that women technically consent to many of the life experiences that lead to misery for women, such as pregnancies they did not wish to have, marriages to spouses who beat them, or jobs where a boss sexually harasses them, since they consented to the sex, marriage or taking the job, respectively (even if they did not want the adverse results, such as on-the-job harassment). West states that if we make consent the key ethical standard in life, then all of these negative experiences for women will be not able to be criticized, as people will say that the woman chose of her own free will to enter that situation. Donna Oriowo states that \\"...when we talk about consent, we very rarely are talking about black women or women of color\\", and the focus is usually on white women, with black women accusers continuing to face doubt and blame due to tropes depicting black women as \\"...over-sexed and only want[ing] sex.\\" Some younger feminists argue that consent is not truly possibly when there is a power disparity between partners in an encounter; Laura Kipnis disagrees, arguing that it is \\"...precisely the dynamics of power‚Äîof status, money, appearance, age, talent‚Äîthat create desire\\" between people in a sexual context, with desire being one of the elements Kipnis thinks we should focus on. Kate Lockwood Harris argues that consent initiatives, such as \\"no means no\\" and \\"yes means yes\\" use views about communication which she sees as false myths, such as the claim that communication during sex can and should be a binary, unambiguous \\"no\\" or \\"yes\\". Harris states that by calling for this type of response, anti-assault advocates are lowering the complexity of communication competence between the two people and lessening the opportunities to make consent a political act. Jed Rubenfeld of Yale Law School wrote in a review that consent should not be the main criterion to judge whether a sexual contact is legal or not. First, in stark contrast to other legal areas (e.g. qualification for a mortgage or an insurance, see misrepresentation), there is generally no requirement to be truthful before obtaining sexual consent. Though rape by deception is punishable, it usually does not refer to honesty in relationship matters. Likewise, laws do not offer any recourse in case sexual consent has been given based on false premises. His second point is that rape laws intend to protect sexual autonomy, but yet the only thing that can override somebody's autonomy is coercion, or exploiting somebody's incapacitation. By their strict definition, non-consensual situations only imply a disagreement, and thus, they can be resolved by simply walking away. Therefore, in Rubenfeld's view, the defenselessness of a person, or the use (or threat) of force, is the only criterion which can define rape in a logical way. Affirmative consent approaches are more complex in the BDSM scene, because in some BDSM encounters, participants agree to \\"consensual non-consent\\" in order to perform role-plays. Non-consensual condom removal, also called \\"stealthing\\", is the practice of one sex partner covertly removing a condom, when consent has only been given by the other sex partner for condom-protected safer sex. Alexandra Brodsky wrote an article in the Columbia Journal of Law and Gender calling for \\"stealthing\\" to be considered as sexual assault. The women who experienced \\"stealthing\\" had to pay for emergency contraception and faced concerns about pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections, and some women felt that it was a type of rape. Stealthing is a type of domestic violence that is called \\"reproductive coercion\\"; it includes taking off condoms or poking holes in condoms. Mia Mercado states that \\"revenge porn\\" posted online or otherwise disseminated by former partners without permission and ‚Äúleaked celebrity [sex] photos‚Äù that are hacked or stolen from stars' phones are \\"non-consensual pornography\\". She says that these two activities are a \\"form of sexual assault and should be treated as such\\", noting that revenge porn is an offence in 34 US states with legislation pending (in 2017) in other states. Concepts of affirmative consent are more challenging in BDSM encounters, particularly in settings where the participants agree to \\"consensual non-consent\\", also called meta-consent and blanket consent, a mutual agreement to be able to act as if consent has been waived. It is an agreement where comprehensive consent is given in advance, with the intent of it being irrevocable under most circumstances. This often occurs without foreknowledge of the exact actions planned.\\"Consensual non-consent\\" , Informed Consent dictionary, Accessed 12 June 2012.Dictionary of BDSM Terms, \\"Consensual Non-Consent\\", Accessed 12 June 2012. Even if two participants in a BDSM encounter agree that they consent to violence, in Canada, the law limits what violent sexual act people can consent to; specifically, Canadians cannot consent to getting seriously injured. Ezra Klein supports California's \\"yes means yes\\" law for the state's colleges on the grounds that there are too many sexual assaults; as such, he endorses broad new legal measures like California's newly created law. While he acknowledges that the law impinges on the personal sexual lives of people, he says that to work, the new law needs to have \\"overreach\\", so that it will create a \\"cold spike of fear\\" among college men about whether a sexual encounter is consensual. Klein states that cases where it is unclear whether consent was or was not given will be a necessary part of the law's effectiveness, as these cases will help to reduce sexual assaults, as students become aware of the disciplinary process and the consequences for those found guilty. Freddie deBoer states that if \\"yes means yes\\" becomes widespread, it would lead to a lower standard of proof being available to law enforcement and justice institutions which have thus far shown evidence of using racial or class-based prejudice when assessing and trying cases (e.g., driving while black); this could lead to \\"yes means yes\\" charges and punishments falling disproportionately on students of color or those from working-class backgrounds. = LGBT = Michael Segalov states that young gay men do not learn much about consent and sexual boundaries because most \\"were never taught the language with which to explain or understand\\" their experiences and there are typically few LGBT+ role models in their community or family to seek advice from. Segalov states that hookup apps may create consent challenges because some men have a feeling of \\"entitlement\\" when they arrive at the hookup partner's place, and a sense that the encounter's sexual interaction has been \\"prearranged\\" online. Philip Henry states that non-consensual groping of bottoms and crotches is tolerated in some gay bars. Christopher Robinson states that some queer \\"spaces continue to normalize, and even encourage, sexual violence\\", including \\"groping, drunk affection, and blatant sexual assault\\", because the \\"direct sexualization\\" in these venues leads some men to view the sexual harassment they commit as a \\"compliment\\" to the recipient. Robinson says that the \\"transgressions [are re-positioned] as charm\\" by the harassers, with the recipients of the unwanted contact being expected to \\"ignore and endure\\" the groping. Robinson says that this atmosphere may undermine the safe space that gay bars were supposed to be providing for queer people. John Voutos states that for queer people, there are number of challenges with communicating consent, including \\"[s]ex-on-premises venues, queer clubs\\", online dating, the \\"non-verbal, semi-ambiguous communication of the hanky code\\" (in which a color-coded system indicates preferred sexual fetishes, what kind of sex they are seeking, and whether they are a top/dominant or bottom/submissive) and cruising for sex. Brodie Turner, the organizer of a 2019 Consent Festival, says that the lengthy history of \\"LGBTIQA+ silencing\\" and erasure from sex education and the lack of media depictions of \\"healthy [LGBTIQA+] relationships\\" mean that LGBTIQA+ people do not know about consent or have a sense that it is their right. Philip Henry states that the male gay community tolerates and even encourages non- consenting grabbing and groping of butts and crotches in gay venues because the boundaries of consent are blurred in the gay club environment, particularly when there is drinking and semi-nude patrons dancing. He says that when a gay man does experience unwanted groping and expresses concern, he is often told to \\"calm down\\" or that groping \\"comes with the territory‚Äù in a gay venue. Gay men in the chemsex scene, where couples or groups consume GHB or crystal meth prior to extensive sex, have stated that consent is not clearly defined and there can be a perception that anyone at a \\"party and play\\" get-together is assumed to consent. In an article in Advocate, Alexander Cheves argues that when a person enters a dark backroom of a gay bar, \\"you waive a degree of consent\\", because \\"[g]ay men go back there to get groped.\\" Cheves states that for people going into a backroom, the onus is on them to \\"gently push\\" an unwanted hand away from their body. In \\"Discussing Consent in Gay Spaces Requires Nuance, Not Sex Panic\\", Rennie McDougall states that adding modern consent approaches to gay spaces such as gay bars and saunas would have a negative effect on gay men's sexual interactions, because non- consensual but non-threatening hands of a stranger on a bottom, chest or crotch can be a \\"positive part of sexual discovery\\" for gay men. Jo Jackson says that in the queer female community she has had experiences where venue participants put their hands on her body (near her thigh) and touching her breasts without consent, but she said nothing because she felt at the time that these actions were part of \\"a soft charade of seduction\\". She states that the queer female community has \\"butt-grabbing, dudeish remarks, and aggressive, persistent come-ons\\" and she says there is a sense that being aggressive or using ‚Äúsexual energy to wield power is...hot‚Äù. She says some women feel a sense of \\"entitlement\\" to touch that blurs the concept of consent. Another issue is that queer women often grow up only exposed to media representations of heterosexual dating, so young queer females may lack a vocabulary for women-on-women dating and an understanding of the social cues for consent. In \\"Why Yes Can Mean No\\", Jordan Bosiljevac states that \\"yes\\" does not necessarily mean consent for \\"...poor, disabled, queer, non-white, trans, or feminine\\" people; she states that consent approaches are a form of privilege created for well-to-do, hetero, cis, White, able-bodied people. An article about queer students at McGill University states that in queer sexual encounters, there is not a set script of activities, as with heterosexual sex, and queer sex is more exploratory; as such, there are more discussions about consent between queer partners about every step and act. However, Rebecca Kahn states that in queer encounters where one person is cis-gender and one person is trans, the cis person may have more power in the relationship that can give the trans person \\"...feelings of fear, or more subtly,...a desire to please the more privileged partner\\" in the encounter; Kahn says that to address these power differentials, the privileged partner should make sure the marginalized person feels comfortable by letting them know that consent is not assumed. Asexual people may feel pressured to consent to having sex when they are in a relationship. ReferencesFurther reading * Archard, David. Sexual consent. Westview Press, 1998. * Cowling, Mark.

The album was also rereleased in 1970 as Peace on the French BYG label, flipping the running order on side two (\\"Somewhere\\" followed by \\"Peace\\"), and on CD in 2010 as a \\"unauthorized European\\" edition on the Free Factory label, using the Savoy title but the BYG running order. In his book Free Jazz, Author Ekkehard Jost noted that among the things Shepp and Dixon had in common was \\"the ambition to play a kind of music unburdened by traditional constraints and yet retaining to a great extent the essence of older jazz styles.\\" He wrote: \\"In several ways the quartet recalls the early Ornette Coleman groups. First, there is no piano. Second, in the general compositional and formal frame of reference and even in certain details of Shepp's improvisations, there is not much difficulty recognizing Coleman as the model... Third, as with Coleman, the tunes act principally as emotional triggers and not as determinants of harmony and form. The players improvise on a tonal centre..., or on a relatively flexible modal groundwork... In both cases a steady swinging beat is present at all times, with no recognizable symptoms of rhythmic dissociation.\\" Reception Richard Brody praised the album: \\"Dixon plays with a bright, fanfare-like tone and a stirring sense of drama ‚Äî his solos seem constructed with discursive foresight, like a speaker putting together paragraphs that build to grand conclusions. His expansive, eloquent, distinctively mature and wise style contrasts with Shepp‚Äôs impulsive inventions and jaggedly guitar-like tones on tenor saxophone. The quartet's blend of rhapsodic melody and harmonic freedom makes for one of the most boldly yet intimately romantic recordings that modern jazz has to offer.\\" Joseph Neff wrote that the album \\"serves as an enlightening prologue to Dixon‚Äôs later masterworks, while being totally worthy on its own.\\" He continued: \\"As on much of his early work, Shepp blows hard and raw... with the second half of 'Trio' becoming attractively harried. Just as illuminating is Dixon's writing, which if plainly avant-garde was never more peggable to the tradition than here; if he's not yet at the compositional level of Coleman, whose tune provides the trumpeter a fine platform for soloing, his talent is obvious... The best valve-blurt comes in the first half of 'Quartet'‚Äôs hearty slab of burning free-bop, with Shepp skronking up the later portion as Moore and Cohen rumble and clang throughout. The choice of 'Somewhere' mildly predicts Shepp's reading of 'The Girl from Ipanema' from Fire Music; the way he and Dixon tangle with the melody is a true gas and a valuable snapshot of a fleeting moment in the jazz avant-garde's development.\\"  Track listing  # \\"Trio\\" (Bill Dixon) - 8:53 # \\"Quartet\\" (Bill Dixon) - 9:16 # \\"Peace\\" (Ornette Coleman) - 9:28 # \\"Somewhere\\" (Leonard Bernstein) - 6:00 :Recorded in NYC in October 1962  Personnel  * Archie Shepp: tenor saxophone * Bill Dixon: trumpet * Don Moore: bass (tracks 1, 2 & 4) * Reggie Workman: bass (track 3) * Paul Cohen: drums (tracks 1, 2 & 4) * Howard McRae: drums (track 3)  References External links * 1962 debut albums Archie Shepp albums Bill Dixon albums Savoy Records albums Avant-garde jazz albums ","title":"Archie Shepp ‚Äì Bill Dixon Quartet"},{"id":"23796657","text":"Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations, 413 U.S. 376 (1973), is a 1973 decision of the United States Supreme Court which upheld an ordinance enacted in Pittsburgh that forbids sex-designated classified advertising for job opportunities, against a claim by the parent company of the Pittsburgh Press that the ordinance violated its First Amendment rights. Background The case involved an ordinance passed after Wilma Scott Heide of the Pittsburgh chapter of the National Organization for Women filed a complaint with the Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations, in which it argued that the practice of the Pittsburgh Press of advertising help wanted classified advertising under headings of \\"help wanted-male\\" and \\"help wanted- female\\" was discriminatory. Evidence from Gerald Gardner quantified the discriminatory nature of the advertising, showing that fewer jobs and ones with lower pay were being offered for women.Hopey, Don. \\"Obituary: Gerald H.F. Gardner / Scientist, teacher, social activist and feminist\\", Pittsburgh Post- Gazette, July 27, 2009. Accessed July 29, 2009. Decision In his majority decision, Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell ruled that help wanted ads were a form of commercial speech that is excluded from protections of freedom of speech and of the press offered under the First Amendment. Sex-segregated advertising was made illegal under the ordinance passed in Pittsburgh, and would be no more permissible than advertisements for prostitutes or drugs that would not be ameliorated by the fact that a newspaper advertised them under the headings \\"prostitutes wanted\\" or \\"narcotics for sale\\". In the same way, an advertiser who placed ads seeking male applicants \\"is likely to discriminate in his hiring decisions\\", and the newspaper should be assisting even indirectly in this discriminatory practice by allowing such ads to be printed.Staff. \\"Law on Sex-Labeled Job Ads Is Upheld\\", The New York Times, June 22, 1973. Accessed July 29, 2009. Stewart emphasized that the court affirmed \\"the protection afforded to editorial judgment and to the free expression of views, however controversial\\" and that it was in no way restricting \\"stories or commentary by the Pittsburgh Press, its columnists or its contributors\\". The dissenting justices raised issues regarding the dangerous precedent on government control of the press, with Associate Justice Potter Stewart describing the decision as \\"the first case in this or any other American court that permits a government agency to... dictate the publisher the layout and makeup of the newspaper's pages\\", expressing his fear that this would not be the last such case once the precedent has been set. After all, once standards on advertising had been set in this decision \\"what is there to prevent it from dictating the layout of the news pages tomorrow?\\". Chief Justice Warren Burger's dissent saw the decision setting \\"a treacherous path\\" in which the courts decide on \\"what is to be constitutionally unprotected and therefore subject to governmental regulation.Staff. \\"'De-Sexed Ads Ruled for Press\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, June 22, 1973.

Television and starred Lindsay Wagner. Scruples included the final screen appearance of Gene Tierney. Plot Wilhelmina Hunnewell Winthrop is a plain young woman, and a \\"poor relative\\" of the Winthrops, a wealthy Boston family. After she graduates from high school, she is given a sum of money by an aunt and goes to live in Paris with family friends. There, she undergoes a transformation of both body and soul, first losing weight, then gaining Parisian style under the guidance of Liliane, the elegant Frenchwoman who is her hostess. She is also introduced to Edouard, Liliane's nephew, who gives her the nickname \\"Billy.\\" It is her first intimate love affair, but when the aristocratic but impecunious Edouard discovers that Billy is just a poor relative of the Winthrop family, he shows his true colors and ends the relationship. Billy returns to America and moves to New York where she is hired by Ikehorn Enterprises as a secretary. During a business meeting in California, she becomes romantically involved with the wealthy CEO, Ellis Ikehorn, who is far older than she. The couple then marry and the next several years are happy ones, as Billy and Ellis live a glamorous life. However, Ellis later suffers a stroke, and Billy moves them from Manhattan to the exclusive Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles for the better climate. Billy hires a male nurse, Jake Cassidy, to look after Ellis. However, Billy lives as a recluse in their enormous house and looks aimlessly for some purpose in her life, eventually developing a compulsion to shop in Beverly Hills. Ellis advises her to find something to do that she is good at, perhaps in fashion. Some time later, Ellis dies and leaves Billy an enormous fortune. Jake, motivated by debt, then tries to blackmail Billy but fails. Heeding Ellis's advice, Billy decides to open a luxury boutique on Rodeo Drive called \\"Scruples.\\" She hires a young French designer, Valentine O'Neil, to design couture clothing for the customers, and also hires Valentine's close friend, Spider Elliot, a former fashion photographer who becomes the Creative Director of the store. However, Valentine and Spider have a history of rocky relationships of their own, with Valentine first getting herself involved with her closeted gay boss and later with Billy's married attorney Josh Hillman, and Spider's involvement with troubled model-turned-actress, Melanie Adams. With Scruples a success, Billy then marries Vito Orsini, a film director. As she is also part-owner of a Hollywood studio (assets left to her by Ellis), she helps Vito to finance his new film, \\"Mirrors.\\" However, studio boss Curt Arvey is not happy with Billy's interference in his studio and intends to sabotage any chance of the film's success. During this scenario, Billy also becomes friends with Dolly Moon, a flamboyant supporting actress in Vito's film. A power struggle later ensues when Curt Arvey attempts to confiscate Vito's film before it can be finished and keeps it locked in the studio's vaults. Billy and Spider manage to steal the film back so that Vito can finish editing the film at home. Meanwhile, Billy is once again menaced by Jake Cassidy, who breaks into her home and attempts to rape her, but he is apprehended by the police just in time. The story ends as Vito's film wins an Academy Award for Best Picture, and Billy announces that she is pregnant with their first child. At the same time, Spider and Valentine realize that their long friendship has turned into love.

Similar opulent productions based on bestselling novels would ensue over the next few years, including Lace (1984), Hollywood Wives (1985), Sins (1986) and I'll Take Manhattan in 1987, which was also based on a novel by Krantz. Due to the success of the mini-series, a pilot for a potential weekly series (featuring a different cast including Shelley Smith and Dirk Benedict) was produced in 1981,1981 Scruples pilot - IMDB page but was unsuccessful.

He is credited with avoiding an escalation of violence and bloodshed during May 1968 unrest. Grimaud was born in Annonay, Ard√®che, on 11 November 1913. He originally studied literature. Grimaud began his career in civil service with the French colonial administration of Morocco in Rabat. He later worked in both Algeria and Germany. Grimaud also worked as a local governor and aide to then-French Interior Minister Fran√ßois Mitterrand. Prefect of Police He succeeded Maurice Papon as Prefect of Police, meaning the head of the Paris police force, in 1967. Grimaud would continue to serve as police chief until 1971, when he was succeeded by Jacques Lenoir. Starting in May 1968, mass social events occurred in France, involving students and workers. Protests initially began at the University of Nanterre, located west of Paris, when students demanded that men and women be allowed to visit each other's dormrooms. The students' demands soon expanded, basically challenging the whole of Gaullist society. The protests quickly escalated nationwide, as French trade unions went on strike in solidarity with the students, prompting 10 million union workers to call a general strike. Student protesters seized and occupied buildings on Paris's Left Bank and Sorbonne University. Grimaud was credited with starting a dialogue with the student protesters and promoting police restraint in the face of the protests. Maurice Grimaud died on 16 July 2009 in Paris at the age of 95.

Duncan also authored several books on plant species of the Eastern and Southeastern United States. Biography Duncan was born in Buffalo, New York, on October 15, 1910. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees, in 1932 and 1933, from Indiana University, then his PhD in botany from Duke University in 1938. He then began a forty-year period in the faculty at the University of Georgia. As Curator of the UGA Herbarium, he increased the collection size from 16,000 to 135,000 specimens. He personally collected over thirty thousand specimens, which he shared with herbaria across the country. During World War II, Duncan served in the United States Public Health Service, in which he earned the rank of Major. His duties during this period included directing mosquito control for Charleston, South Carolina and serving as state entomologist for Kentucky. Duncan was married for 64 years (from 1941 until his death) to botanist Marion Bennett Duncan, with whom he collaborated on several books, including Wildflowers of the Eastern United States. Species described Duncan is the botanical authority who first described three plant species: Quercus oglethorpensis, Trillium persistens, and Baptisia arachnifera.

Because of this, The Green Album is widely regarded as an Eddie Jobson solo album, similarly to how Runt is considered a Todd Rundgren solo album despite being credited to Runt.

A proposal to constitutionally ban same-sex marriage and same-sex adoption was rejected twice in 2006, and once again in April 2009 after the FMLN refused to grant the measure the four votes it needed to be ratified. El Salvador must legalise same-sex marriage, per a 2018 Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruling, which stated that countries that have ratified the American Convention on Human Rights must recognise such marriages. History=Legal challenges= In August 2016, a student of law in El Salvador filed a lawsuit before the Supreme Court asking for the nullification of Article 11 of the Family Code which defines marriage as a heterosexual union. Labeling the law as discriminatory and explaining the lack of gendered terms used in Article 34 of the Constitution's summary of marriage, the lawsuit sought to allow same-sex couples the right to wed.Same- sex Marriage Lawsuit Filed in El Salvador Piden declarar inconstitucional exclusi√≥n de matrimonio a personas del mismo sexo On 20 December 2016, the Salvadoran Supreme Court rejected the lawsuit on a legal technicality. Sala Constitucional de El Salvador rechaza solicitud de matrimonio homosexual A second lawsuit against the same-sex marriage ban was filed on 11 November 2016. Piden a Sala Constitucional que autorice el matrimonio homosexual en El Salvador On 17 January 2019, the Supreme Court dismissed the case on procedural grounds. On 9 August 2019, a same-sex marriage case was admitted to the Constitutional Court. Originally filed in 2016 by activist Gabriel Gasteazoro, the case alleges that the provisions outlawing same-sex marriages in the Family Code are unconstitutional. A ruling is expected in the first three months of 2020, but has been postponed since then. =Constitutional attempts to ban same-sex marriage= The Constitution of El Salvador does not explicitly ban the recognition of same-sex marriages. Article 32 reads: \\"The legal foundation of the family is marriage and rests on the juridical equality of the spouses.\\" In 2006, a constitutional amendment to ban the legal recognition of same-sex marriage was proposed. The measure was backed by the conservative Christian Democratic Party, then President Antonio Saca and several other parties; i.e. Democratic Change, the Front for Democratic Revolution and the National Conciliation Party.Fear of \\"Gay Planet\\" in El Salvador But was opposed, and thus defeated, by the FMLN. It failed to win enough votes to be formally ratified due to the FMLN legislators. While the Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front (FMLN) has consistently opposed attempts to amend the Constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage, citing their belief that such laws are discriminatory, the party has stated that it has no intention to legalize same-sex marriage. On 30 April 2009, the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador approved a last-minute constitutional amendment that would have banned same-sex couples from marrying by defining marriage as being between only \\"a man and a woman\\" and barring them from adopting children. Civil rights groups vowed to fight the measure, which still needed to be voted on by other government branches before becoming law.El Salvador Bans Same-Sex Marriage and LGBT Adoption Rights in Last Minute Constitutional Amendment The amendment eventually failed the same month. On 25 April 2012, a same-sex marriage and adoption ban was introduced to the Legislative Assembly. The measure eventually failed on 8 February 2014, after only receiving 19 votes in favor of its ratification.Attempt To Ban Gay Marriage Fails In El Salvador On 17 April 2015, a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage and adoption was approved once again in the Assembly during its first reading with 47 votes in favor. To be successfully included in the country's Constitution, the law had to be ratified by a two-thirds majority of the Assembly, or 56 of its 84 members. El Salvador approves measures banning same-sex marriage, gay couple adoption In November 2016, following a lawyer's constitutional challenge against the country's statutory same-sex marriage ban (see above), some conservative MPs renewed their efforts to constitutionally ban same-sex marriage. La en√©sima procesi√≥n en la Asamblea en contra del matrimonio igualitario In January 2018, the Salvadoran Constitutional Court declared the proposed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage unlawful, because it was \\"fast-trecked through the Assembly and voted on urgently just days left in the session.\\"El Salvador: Constitutional ban on same-sex marriage blocked ABC News, 31 January 2018 =2018 Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruling= On 8 January 2018, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) ruled that the American Convention on Human Rights mandates and requires the recognition of same-sex marriage.

It was newly described from central Laos in 2009. It is one of the very few Asian songbirds with a bald (featherless) face and is the first new species of bulbul to be described from Asia in almost a century. Taxonomy and systematics A sketch The species epithet hualon is from the Lao word for \\"bald-headed\\". A 2018 molecular phylogenetic study of the bulbuls suggested that the species does not fit in the clade containing the core Pycnonotus and stood apart suggesting its placement in a new genus Nok from Lao language for \\"bird\\" as Nok hualon. Description The mainly olive-green bare-faced bulbul is distinctive in having a bare pink face with blueish skin around the eyes. The two specimens so far collected were around 20 cm in length and weighed 32-40 g. The breast and belly are fawn-grey, the uppersides olive and the throat is off-white. According to researchers, its call is a \\"dry bubbly tweet\\". Habitat The bare-faced bulbul is known only from the limestone karst region near Pha Lom in central Laos. The area is characterised by steep terrain with bare limestone and low (less than 4 m in height) deciduous trees and shrubs. It seems likely that the species is restricted entirely to this habitat, though it may occur at other sites in Laos with similar habitats. Observations of similar birds were made in 1995 at another site. Limestone karst is the habitat of several newly discovered endemic species, including the unusual Laotian rock rat. Behaviour The bare-faced bulbul is mainly arboreal but sometimes perches on rocks on the steep hillsides. It is a conspicuous species, foraging during the day in pairs or as singles.

He was the first professor of law in Andhra University and the first honorary professor of theatre arts and chairman of the Faculty of Arts. He was born on 19 December 1903. He was the son of Sir Kurma Venkata Reddy Naidu, the former governor of Madras Presidency. He has one sister. He did Bar-at- Law. He was educated at the Oxford Balliol College, where he did his master's degree. He was later called to the Bar of the Inner temple of United Kingdom. He was the private secretary to the Agent General of India in South Africa in 1930. He came back to India to serve in Andhra University and was appointed as the registrar, a post he held till his retirement for about 22 years (April 1942 to February 1964). Andhra University was inaugurated in temporary premises at Bezawada in 1926 by Lord Goschen, the first chancellor. Goschen was the governor of Madras Presidency from April 1924 to June 1929. He was succeeded by Lord Erskine, who was in the chair up to March 1940 except for a brief interregnum from 18 June 1936 to 01 October 1936. During this period Kurma Venkata Reddy Naidu was the governor and ex-officio chancellor of Andhra University. Reddy Naidu was also the chief minister of the state for a little over three months in 1937. In April 1942, his son Kurma Venugopalaswamy was appointed the registrar of Andhra University, which post he held till his retirement in February 1964. Thus a father and son occupied high positions associated with the Andhra University, a rare phenomenon in the annals of this university. The younger Kurma took active interest in amateur theatre, and it was due to his efforts that the Department of Theatre Arts was established. The open-air theatre known to earlier batches of students as Erskine Square is now named after him ‚Äì Kurma Venugopalaswamy Arubayalu Rangasthalam, a name as lengthy as the tenure of his office of the registrar of Andhra Vishwa Kala Parishat. After retirement he held the position of director of the Indian Institute of Management and Commerce, Hyderabad in 1973 until 1978.Profile of Indian Institute of Management and Commerce He played hockey and tennis and was the captain of the Madras Christian College Lawn Tennis Association. He played hockey against many international teams and had the proud privilege of partnering the late Shri Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed in an international tennis tournament in France. His birth centenary celebrations were organised by a committee headed by the AU vice-chancellor, Y.C. Simhadri. They were inaugurated on 19 December 2003, and concluded with the valedictory on 29 January 2004. A souvenir was released with contributory articles from his students and beneficiaries. He was awarded an honorary doctorate (D.Litt.) by Andhra University in recognition of his services and intellectual contributions on the occasion of the fiftieth convocation in 1977. Andhra University Open-Air Theatre was named after him by the university authorities as a token of gratitude. Prof. K.V.

He was the eldest son of Ansur Fern√°ndez and namesake of his grandfather, Fernando Ans√∫rez I. His sister Teresa was the queen of Sancho I and later regent for her son, Ramiro III. Fernando had six brothers (Oveco, Gonzalo, Osorio, Mu√±o, Gutier and Nu√±o) at the time of his first appearance in contemporary records (943), but shortly after being appointed to the county of Monz√≥n (951) only two, Gonzalo and Mu√±o, were still living, and they were recorded as counts along with him.Gonzalo Mart√≠nez D√≠ez, \\"El obispado de Palencia en el siglo X,\\" Liber amicorum: profesor don Ignacio de la Concha (University of Oviedo: 1986), 344‚Äì46. The first record of Fernando as count is his confirmation of a diploma of 17 June 950, where he signs as Fredinandus Assurez comes. Fernando probably succeeded his father, with royal approval, but there is a lapse in the documentation concerning the county of Monz√≥n between 947 and 950. Relations with the Caliphate On 12 August 971, according to the al-Muqtabis, the Caliph of C√≥rdoba, al-Hakam II, received six separate Christian embassies in his palace of al-Zahra.Gonzalo Mart√≠nez D√≠ez, El condado de Castilla, 711‚Äì1038: La historia frente a la leyenda (Marcial Pons Historia, 2005), 464. From Sancho Garc√©s II of Pamplona, \\"prince of the Bascones\\", he received the abbot Bassal (Basilio) and Velasco, a judge of N√°jera. From Elvira Ram√≠rez came her envoy al-Layt and the C√≥rdoban arif Abd al-Malik, who had been at her court. From Fernando La√≠nez, count of Salamanca, the caliph received the ambassadors Habib Tawila and Saada. From Garci-Fern√°ndez, Count of Castile and √Ålava, arrived one Garc√≠a, son perhaps of a certain Gat√≥n. The second to last embassy he received was led by a certain Esimeno (Jimeno) and his companion Elgas, sent by Fernando Ans√∫rez.The final embassy consisted in the ambassadors of a certain count Gundisalb: Sulayman and Jalaf ibn Sad. This last may have been either Gonzalo Men√©ndez, Count of Portugal, or Gonzalo Mu√±oz, Count of Coimbra. On 24 June 974 al-Hakam received four more Christian embassies in a single day. The first ambassador, Guitart, came bearing a letter from Borrell S√∫√±er, the Count of Barcelona, making submission anew and requesting a renewal of the existing treaty between the Caliphate and the County. The second came from Emperor Otto II, called \\"king of the Franks\\" by Isa al-Razi. His ambassador was a count named Asraka Ibn Umar Dawud, who sought renewed guarantees of friendship. The third embassy, led by a bishop of \\"Y.r.n.s.\\" (perhaps Iru√±a) and Nu√±o Gonz√°lez, was seeking the extension of a treaty whose terms were coming to an end for Castile. The final embassy of the day came from Fernando Ans√∫rez and sought the prolongation of peaceful relations. All were received with hospitality.Mart√≠nez D√≠ez 2005, 467. Fernando also sent embassies to C√≥rdoba in October 971.Claudio S√°nchez-Albornoz, Una ciudad de la Espa√±a Cristiana hace mil a√±os: Estampas de la vida en Le√≥n (Ediciones Rialp, 1991), 140. On 23 September 973 al-Hakam received ambassadors from the Kingdom of Navarre, Fernando Ans√∫rez, the Beni G√≥mez clan, and Rodrigo Vel√°zquez. The Caliph bestowed on them gifts in exchange for reports from the ones who sent them.Lucky K. Pick, \\"Dominissima, prudentissima: Elvira, First Queen-Regent of Le√≥n\\", 59. Death and succession On 25 August 976 Fernando, in a charter by which he donated the villages of Tello Barba, Coresce, Sarracino, and Gallegos to the monastery of Sahag√∫n, boasted that his father had remained always faithful to his monarch, Ramiro II, and had served him with valour in a thousand battles.Jes√∫s San Mart√≠n Payo, \\"Las primeras donaciones de los condes de Monz√≥n a Santa Mar√≠a de Husillos,\\" Publicaciones de la Instituci√≥n Tello T√©llez de Meneses, 59:297‚Äì350 (1988), p. 331, and \\"Notas hist√≥ricas sobre la Abadia de Husillos,\\" Publicaciones de la Instituci√≥n Tello T√©llez de Meneses, 64:197‚Äì236 (1993), p. 204. The pertinent portion of the charter referred to is cited in S√°nchez-Albornoz 1991, 92, from Romualdo Escalona, Historia del Real Monasterio de Sahag√∫n (Joach√≠n Ibarra, 1782), 420: > Nempe plures manet notum eo quod dive memorie genitori meo Assuri Comite > satis fidelissimum fuisse Domino Rademiro Principe et post obitum genitoris > mei Ego vicem ipsius obtemperavi, ut potuit supradictum ... Ego vero tempore > ut ille fines vite excepit et prolis ipsius Domino Ordonio regalia vice > adquisivit, ego ut michi mee supetierunt vires adiutor et fidelissimus illi > extiti et contra resistentes illi atquietavi adtentius dimicavit. At the time of his death Fernando had no living sons. He was succeeded by his sister Teresa and her son, Ramiro III, as recorded during the reign of Sancho III of Navarre: transitus est illo comite Ferdinando Anxurez; venit sua germana domina Tarassia et rex Ramiro, qui erat in Legione, venit a Monteson (\\"this count Fernando Ans√∫rez died; his sister Lady Teresa came and king Ramiro, who was in Le√≥n, came to Monz√≥n\\"). This is notice is preserved in the abbey of Husillos, to which Teresa and her son granted the villages of San Juli√°n and Abandella for the sake of Fernando's soul. Also on account of Fernando's childlessness, his widow, Toda, was allowed to rule Due√±as in the county of Monz√≥n. In 980 she was referred to as domna Tota cometissa iudicante ciui Domnas (\\"the countess Do√±a Toda judging in the city of Due√±as\\"). A document from Husillos during the reign of Sancho Garc√≠a of Castile, who was also count of Monz√≥n, stressed that he \\"came after\\" Fernando Ans√∫rez, though two counts intervened (Ramiro III and Garc√≠a Fern√°ndez).Mart√≠nez D√≠ez 2005, 543.

On 22 March 1954 Einstein received a letter from Joseph Dispentiere, an Italian immigrant who had worked as an experimental machinist in New Jersey. Dispentiere had declared himself an atheist and was disappointed by a news report which had cast Einstein as conventionally religious. Einstein replied on 24 March 1954: In his book Ideas and Opinions (1954) Einstein stated, \\"In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests.\\" In December 1922 Einstein said the following on the idea of a saviour, \\"Denominational traditions I can only consider historically and psychologically; they have no other significance for me. =Pantheism and Spinoza's God= Einstein had explored the idea that humans could not understand the nature of God. In an interview published in George Sylvester Viereck's book Glimpses of the Great (1930), Einstein responded to a question about whether or not he defined himself as a pantheist. He explained: > Your question is the most difficult in the world. It is not a question I can > answer simply with yes or no. I am not an Atheist.

The child notes a definite plan in the > arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend, > but only dimly suspects. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the human > mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward God. We see a universe > marvelously arranged, obeying certain laws, but we understand the laws only > dimly. Our limited minds cannot grasp the mysterious force that sways the > constellations. I am fascinated by Spinoza's Pantheism. I admire even more > his contributions to modern thought.

Viereck, Glimpses of > the Great (Macauley, New York, 1930) p. 372-373. Einstein stated, \\"My views are near those of Spinoza: admiration for the beauty of and belief in the logical simplicity of the order which we can grasp humbly and only imperfectly. I believe that we have to content ourselves with our imperfect knowledge and understanding and treat values and moral obligations as a purely human problem‚Äîthe most important of all human problems.\\"Holton, G. J. and Yehuda Elkana (1997). Albert Einstein: Historical and Cultural Perspectives. New York: Dover Publications, p. 309. On 24 April 1929, Einstein cabled Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein in German: \\"I believe in Spinoza's God, who reveals himself in the harmony of all that exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and the doings of mankind.\\"Isaacson, Walter (2008). Einstein: His Life and Universe. New York: Simon and Schuster, pp. 388-389. Reported by The New York Times 25 April 1929 under the headline \\"Einstein believes in 'Spinoza's God'\\" He expanded on this in answers he gave to the Japanese magazine Kaiz≈ç in 1923: > Scientific research can reduce superstition by encouraging people to think > and view things in terms of cause and effect. Certain it is that a > conviction, akin to religious feeling, of the rationality and > intelligibility of the world lies behind all scientific work of a higher > order. [...] This firm belief, a belief bound up with a deep feeling, in a > superior mind that reveals itself in the world of experience, represents my > conception of God. In common parlance this may be described as \\"pantheistic\\" > (Spinoza).Einstein, Albert (2010). Ideas And Opinions. New York: Three > Rivers Press, p. 262. =Agnosticism, atheism, and deism= Einstein said people can call him an agnostic rather than an atheist, stating: \\"I have repeatedly said that in my opinion the idea of a personal god is a childlike one. You may call me an agnostic, but I do not share the crusading spirit of the professional atheist whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of liberation from the fetters of religious indoctrination received in youth. I prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being.\\" In an interview published by the German poet George Sylvester Viereck, Einstein stated, \\"I am not an Atheist.\\" According to Prince Hubertus, Einstein said, \\"In view of such harmony in the cosmos which I, with my limited human mind, am able to recognize, there are yet people who say there is no God. But what really makes me angry is that they quote me for the support of such views.\\"Clark, Ronald W. (1971). Einstein: The Life and Times. New York: World Publishing Company, p. 425. In 1945 Guy Raner, Jr. wrote a letter to Einstein, asking him if it was true that a Jesuit priest had caused Einstein to convert from atheism. Einstein replied, \\"I have never talked to a Jesuit priest in my life and I am astonished by the audacity to tell such lies about me. From the viewpoint of a Jesuit priest I am, of course, and have always been an atheist. ... It is always misleading to use anthropomorphical concepts in dealing with things outside the human sphere‚Äîchildish analogies. We have to admire in humility the beautiful harmony of the structure of this world‚Äîas far as we can grasp it, and that is all.\\"Brian, Denis (1996). Einstein: A Life. New York: J. Wiley, p. 344. Einstein's Letter of 2 July 1945; cf. Michael Shermer 13 December 2010; cf. Bonhams sale, 14 Mar 2019, Eric C. Carens collection In a 1950 letter to M. Berkowitz, Einstein stated that \\"My position concerning God is that of an agnostic. I am convinced that a vivid consciousness of the primary importance of moral principles for the betterment and ennoblement of life does not need the idea of a law-giver, especially a law-giver who works on the basis of reward and punishment.\\" According to biographer Walter Isaacson, Einstein was more inclined to denigrate atheists than religious people.Isaacson, Walter (2007). \\"Einstein and Faith\\" Time 169 (April 5): 47. Einstein said in correspondence, \\"[T]he fanatical atheists...are like slaves who are still feeling the weight of their chains which they have thrown off after hard struggle. They are creatures who‚Äîin their grudge against the traditional 'opium of the people'‚Äîcannot hear the music of the spheres.\\"Jammer, Max (2002). Einstein and Religion: physics and theology. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 97 Although he did not believe in a personal God, he indicated that he would never seek to combat such belief because \\"such a belief seems to me preferable to the lack of any transcendental outlook.\\"Jammer, Max (2002). Einstein and Religion: physics and theology. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 51, 149. Walter Isaacson also wrote of Einstein's deism. On page 385 of the landmark book, Einstein: His Life and Universe, Isaacson stated that Albert Einstein \\"held a deistic concept of God.\\" Einstein, in a one-and-a-half-page hand-written German- language letter to philosopher Eric Gutkind, dated Princeton, New Jersey, 3 January 1954, a year and three and a half months before his death, wrote: \\"The word God is for me nothing but the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of venerable but still rather primitive legends. No interpretation, no matter how subtle, can (for me) change anything about this. [...] For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstition. [...] I cannot see anything 'chosen' about them [the Jewish people].\\"Albert Einstein's \\"God Letter\\" fetches US $2,400,000 at Christie's New York auction house on 4 December 2018 \\"Einstein's \\"I don't believe in God\\" letter has sold on eBay...\\", 23 Oct 2012, io9.com =Belief in an afterlife= On 17 July 1953 a woman who was a licensed Baptist pastor sent Einstein a letter asking if he had felt assured about attaining everlasting life with the Creator. Einstein replied, \\"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it.\\"Dukas, Helen (1981). Albert Einstein the Human Side. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 39. This sentiment was also expressed in Einstein's book The World as I See It (1935), \\"I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures, or has a will of the type of which we are conscious in ourselves. An individual who should survive his physical death is also beyond my comprehension, nor do I wish it otherwise; such notions are for the fears or absurd egoism of feeble souls. Enough for me the mystery of the eternity of life, and the inkling of the marvellous structure of reality, together with the single-hearted endeavour to comprehend a portion, be it ever so tiny, of the reason that manifests itself in nature.\\"Einstein, Albert (1999). The World as I See It. Secaucus, NJ: Citadel Press, p. 5. Einstein was averse to the Abrahamic conception of Heaven and Hell, particularly as it pertained to a system of everlasting reward and punishment. In a 1915 letter to the Swiss physicist Edgar Meyer, Einstein wrote, \\"I see only with deep regret that God punishes so many of His children for their numerous stupidities, for which only He Himself can be held responsible; in my opinion, only His nonexistence could excuse Him.\\"Calaprice, Alice (2000). The Expanded Quotable Einstein, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2000, p. 201. He also stated, \\"I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modeled after our own ‚Äî a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms.\\"Rowe, David and Robert Schulmann (2007). Einstein on Politics: His Private Thoughts and Public Stands on Nationalism. Princeton: Princeton University Press, pp. 229-230. Part of Einstein's tension with the Abrahamic afterlife was his belief in determinism and his rejection of free will. Einstein stated, \\"The man who is thoroughly convinced of the universal operation of the law of causation cannot for a moment entertain the idea of a being who interferes in the course of events ‚Äî that is, if he takes the hypothesis of causality really seriously. He has no use for the religion of fear and equally little for social or moral religion. A God who rewards and punishes is inconceivable to him for the simple reason that a man's actions are determined by necessity, external and internal, so that in God's eyes he cannot be responsible, any more than an inanimate object is responsible for the motions it goes through.\\"Einstein, Albert (1930). \\"Religion and Science,\\" New York Times Magazine (Nov. 9): 3-4. =Cosmic spirituality= In 1930 Einstein published a widely discussed essay in The New York Times Magazine about his beliefs. With the title \\"Religion and Science,\\" Einstein distinguished three human impulses which develop religious belief: fear, social or moral concerns, and a cosmic religious feeling. A primitive understanding of causality causes fear, and the fearful invent supernatural beings analogous to themselves. The desire for love and support create a social and moral need for a supreme being; both these styles have an anthropomorphic concept of God. The third style, which Einstein deemed most mature, originates in a deep sense of awe and mystery. He said, the individual feels \\"the sublimity and marvelous order which reveal themselves in nature ... and he wants to experience the universe as a single significant whole.\\" Einstein saw science as an antagonist of the first two styles of religious belief, but as a partner in the third. He maintained, \\"even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other\\" there are \\"strong reciprocal relationships and dependencies\\" as aspirations for truth derive from the religious sphere. He continued: > A person who is religiously enlightened appears to me to be one who has, to > the best of his ability, liberated himself from the fetters of his selfish > desires and is preoccupied with thoughts, feelings and aspirations to which > he clings because of their super-personal value. It seems to me that what is > important is the force of this superpersonal content ... regardless of > whether any attempt is made to unite this content with a Divine Being, for > otherwise it would not be possible to count Buddha and Spinoza as religious > personalities. Accordingly a religious person is devout in the sense that he > has no doubt of the significance of those super-personal objects and goals > which neither require nor are capable of rational foundation ... In this > sense religion is the age-old endeavor of mankind to become clearly and > completely conscious of these values and goals and constantly to strengthen > and extend their effect. If one conceives of religion and science according > to these definitions then a conflict between them appears impossible. For > science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be... An understanding of causality was fundamental to Einstein's ethical beliefs. In Einstein's view, \\"the doctrine of a personal God interfering with natural events could never be refuted, in the real sense, by science,\\" for religion can always take refuge in areas that science can not yet explain. It was Einstein's belief that in the \\"struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope\\" and cultivate the \\"Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity itself.\\" In his 1934 book The World as I See It, Einstein expanded on his religiosity, \\"A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, of the manifestations of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which are only accessible to our reason in their most elementary forms ‚Äî it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute the truly religious attitude; in this sense, and in this alone, I am a deeply religious man.\\"Einstein, Albert (2006). The World As I See It. New York: Citadel Press, p. 7. In 1936 Einstein received a letter from a young girl in the sixth grade. She had asked him, with the encouragement of her teacher, if scientists pray. Einstein replied in the most elementary way he could: Einstein characterized himself as \\"devoutly religious\\" in the following sense, \\"The most beautiful emotion we can experience is the mystical. It is the power of all true art and science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead. To know that what is impenetrable to us really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their most primitive forms‚Äîthis knowledge, this feeling, is at the center of true religiousness. In this sense, and in this sense only, I belong to the rank of devoutly religious men.\\" In December 1952, he commented on what inspires his religiosity, \\"My feeling is religious insofar as I am imbued with the insufficiency of the human mind to understand more deeply the harmony of the universe which we try to formulate as 'laws of nature.'\\" In a letter to Maurice Solovine Einstein spoke about his reasons for using the word \\"religious\\" to describe his spiritual feelings, \\"I can understand your aversion to the use of the term 'religion' to describe an emotional and psychological attitude which shows itself most clearly in Spinoza. (But) I have not found a better expression than 'religious' for the trust in the rational nature of reality that is, at least to a certain extent, accessible to human reason.\\"Goldsmith, Maurice, Alan Mackay, James Woudhuysen, eds. (2013). Einstein: The First Hundred Years. New York: Pergamon Press. p. 192. Einstein frequently referred to his belief system as \\"cosmic religion\\" and authored an eponymous article on the subject in 1954, which later became his book Ideas and Opinions in 1955.Calaprice, Alice (2005). The Einstein Almanac. Baltimore: JHU Press, p. 91. The belief system recognized a \\"miraculous order which manifests itself in all of nature as well as in the world of ideas,\\" devoid of a personal God who rewards and punishes individuals based on their behavior. It rejected a conflict between science and religion, and held that cosmic religion was necessary for science. For Einstein, \\"science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.\\"Einstein, Albert (1956). \\"Science and Religion,\\" Ideas and Opinions. New York: Citadel Press, p. 26. He told William Hermanns in an interview that \\"God is a mystery. But a comprehensible mystery. I have nothing but awe when I observe the laws of nature. There are not laws without a lawgiver, but how does this lawgiver look? Certainly not like a man magnified.\\"Hermanns, William (1983). Einstein and the Poet. In Search of the Cosmic Man. Brookline Village MA: Branden Books, p. 60. He added with a smile \\"some centuries ago I would have been burned or hanged. Nonetheless, I would have been in good company.\\" Einstein devised a theology for the cosmic religion, wherein the rational discovery of the secrets of nature is a religious act.Don Howard, Lesson no. 22, \\"Cosmic Religion and Jewish Identity\\", Albert Einstein: Physicist, Philosopher, Humanitarian , Course No. 8122, The Teaching Company, LLC, 2009. His religion and his philosophy were integral parts of the same package as his scientific discoveries. = Jewish identity = In a letter to Eric Gutkind dated 3 January 1954, Einstein wrote in German, \\"For me the Jewish religion like all others is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people. As far as my experience goes, they are also no better than other human groups, although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power. Otherwise I cannot see anything 'chosen' about them.\\" In an interview published by Time magazine with George Sylvester Viereck, Einstein spoke of his feelings about Christianity. Born in Germany, Viereck supported National Socialism but he was not anti-semitic.American National Biography Online And like Einstein he was a pacifist.Goldsmith, Maurice, Alan Mackay, James Woudhuysen, eds. (2013). Einstein: The First Hundred Years. New York: Pergamon Press. p. 100.Ito, Shingo (2005). \\"Einstein's pacifist dilemma revealed.\\" July 5. At the time of the interview Einstein was informed that Viereck was not Jewish,Viereck, George Sylvester (1929). \\"What Life Means to Einstein,\\" Saturday Evening Post (Oct. 26): 17, 110. but stated that Viereck had \\"the psychic adaptability of the Jew,\\" making it possible for Einstein to talk to him \\"without barrier.\\" Viereck began by asking Einstein if he considered himself a German or a Jew, to which Einstein responded, \\"It's possible to be both.\\" Viereck moved along in the interview to ask Einstein if Jews should try to assimilate, to which Einstein replied \\"We Jews have been too eager to sacrifice our idiosyncrasies in order to conform.\\" Einstein was then asked to what extent he was influenced by Christianity. \\"As a child I received instruction both in the Bible and in the Talmud. I am a Jew, but I am enthralled by the luminous figure of the Nazarene.\\" Einstein was then asked if he accepted the historical existence of Jesus, to which he replied, \\"Unquestionably! No one can read the Gospels without feeling the actual presence of Jesus. His personality pulsates in every word. No myth is filled with such life.\\" In a conversation with the Dutch poet Willem Frederik Hermans Einstein stressed that, \\"I seriously doubt that Jesus himself said that he was God, for he was too much a Jew to violate that great commandment: Hear O Israel, the Eternal is our God and He is one!' and not two or three.\\"Hermanns, William (1983). Einstein and the Poet: In Search of the Cosmic Man. Brookline Village MA: Branden Books, p. 62. Einstein lamented, \\"Sometimes I think it would have been better if Jesus had never lived. No name was so abused for the sake of power!\\" In his 1934 book The World as I See It he expressed his belief that \\"if one purges the Judaism of the Prophets and Christianity as Jesus Christ taught it of all subsequent additions, especially those of the priests, one is left with a teaching which is capable of curing all the social ills of humanity.\\"Einstein, Albert (1954). Ideas and Opinions. New York: Bonanza Books, pp. 184-185. Originally from WAISI. Later in a 1943 interview Einstein added, \\"It is quite possible that we can do greater things than Jesus, for what is written in the Bible about him is poetically embellished.\\"Calaprice, Alice (2011). The Ultimate Quotable Einstein. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 337. Einstein interpreted the concept of a Kingdom of God as referring to the best people. \\"I have always believed that Jesus meant by the Kingdom of God the small group scattered all through time of intellectually and ethically valuable people.\\" In the last year of his life he said \\"If I were not a Jew I would be a Quaker.\\"Clark, Ronald W. (1995). Einstein: The Life and Times. New York: Random House Value Publishing, p. 339. =Views of the Christian churches= The only Jewish school in Munich had been closed in 1872 for want of students, and in the absence of an alternative Einstein attended a Catholic elementary school.F√∂lsing, Albrecht (1997). Albert Einstein: a biography. London: Penguin, p. 15 He also received Jewish religious education at home, but he did not see a division between the two faiths, as he perceived the \\"sameness of all religions\\".Sachs, Andrew and Peter Jones (1930). Albert Einstein. Taylor and Francis, p. 32. Einstein was equally impressed by the stories of the Hebrew Bible and the Passion of Jesus. According to biographer Walter Isaacson, Einstein immensely enjoyed the Catholic religion courses which he received at the school. The teachers at his school were liberal and generally made no distinction among students' religions, though some harbored an innate but mild antisemitism.F√∂lsing, Albrecht (1997). Albert Einstein: a biography. London: Penguin, p. 16. Einstein later recalled an incident involving a teacher who particularly liked him, \\"One day that teacher brought a long nail to the lesson and told the students that with such nails Christ had been nailed to the Cross by the Jews\\" and that \\"Among the children at the elementary school anti-Semitism was prevalent...Physical attacks and insults on the way home from school were frequent, but for the most part not too vicious.\\" Einstein noted, \\"That was at a Catholic school; how much worse the antisemitism must be in other Prussian schools, one can only imagine.\\"Hermanns, William (1983). Einstein and the Poet. In Search of the Cosmic Man. Brookline Village MA: Branden Books, p. 32. He would later in life recall that \\"The religion of the fathers, as I encountered it in Munich during religious instruction and in the synagogue, repelled rather than attracted me.\\"F√∂lsing, Albrecht (1997). Albert Einstein: a biography. London: Penguin, p. 41. Einstein met several times and collaborated with the Belgian priest scientist Georges Lema√Ætre, of the Catholic University of Leuven. Fr Lemaitre is known as the first proponent of the big bang theory of the origins of the cosmos and pioneer in applying Einstein's theory of general relativity to cosmology. Einstein proposed Lemaitre for the 1934 Francqui Prize, which he received from the Belgian King.Holder, R.D. and S Mitton (2013). Georges Lema√Ætre: Life, Science and Legacy. New York: Springer Science, p. 10. In 1940 Time magazine quoted Einstein lauding the Catholic Church for its role in opposing the Nazis: > Only the Church stood squarely across the path of Hitler's campaign for > suppressing truth. I never had any special interest in the Church before, > but now I feel a great affection and admiration because the Church alone has > had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual truth and moral > freedom. I am forced thus to confess that what I once despised I now praise > unreservedly.Anonymous (1940). \\"Religion: German Martyrs\\" Time 36 (Dec. 23): > 38. The quotation has since been repeatedly cited by defenders of Pope Pius XII. An investigation of the quotation by mathematician William C. Waterhouse and Barbara Wolff of the Einstein Archives in Jerusalem found that the statement was mentioned in an unpublished letter from 1947. In the letter to Count Montgelas, Einstein explained that the original comment was a casual one made to a journalist regarding the support of \\"a few churchmen\\" for individual rights and intellectual freedom during the early rule of Hitler and that, according to Einstein, the comment had been drastically exaggerated. On 11 November 1950 the Rev. Cornelius Greenway of Brooklyn wrote a letter to Einstein which had also quoted his alleged remarks about the Church. Einstein responded, \\"I am, however, a little embarrassed. The wording of the statement you have quoted is not my own. Shortly after Hitler came to power in Germany I had an oral conversation with a newspaper man about these matters. Since then my remarks have been elaborated and exaggerated nearly beyond recognition. I cannot in good conscience write down the statement you sent me as my own. The matter is all the more embarrassing to me because I, like yourself, I am predominantly critical concerning the activities, and especially the political activities, through history of the official clergy. Thus, my former statement, even if reduced to my actual words (which I do not remember in detail) gives a wrong impression of my general attitude.\\"Dukas, Helen, ed. (1981). Albert Einstein, The Human Side. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 94. In 2008 the Antiques Roadshow television program aired a manuscript expert, Catherine Williamson, authenticating a 1943 letter from Einstein in which he confirms that he \\"made a statement which corresponds approximately\\" to Time magazine's quotation of him. However, Einstein continued, \\"I made this statement during the first years of the Nazi regime‚Äîmuch earlier than 1940‚Äîand my expressions were a little more moderate.\\"Antiques Roadshow (2008). \\"1943 Albert Einstein Letter\\" PBS. May 19. Video  William Hermanns conversations  Einstein's conversations with William Hermanns were recorded over a 34-year correspondence. In the conversations Einstein makes various statements about the Christian Churches in general and the Catholic Church in particular: \\"When you learn the history of the Catholic Church, you wouldn't trust the Center Party. Hasn't Hitler promised to smash the Bolsheviks in Russia? The Church will bless its Catholic soldiers to march alongside the Nazis\\" (March 1930). \\"I predict that the Vatican will support Hitler if he comes to power. The Church since Constantine has always favoured the authoritarian State, as long as the State allows the Church to baptize and instruct the masses\\" (March 1930).Hermanns, William (1983). pp. 32-33. \\"So often in history the Jews have been the instigators of justice and reform whether in Spain, Germany or Russia. But no sooner have they done their job than their 'friends', often blessed by the Church, spit in their faces\\" (August 1943).Hermanns, William (1983). p. 46. \\"But what makes me shudder is that the Catholic Church is silent. One doesn't need to be a prophet to say, 'The Catholic Church will pay for this silence...I do not say that the unspeakable crimes of the Church for 2,000 years had always the blessing of the Vatican, but it vaccinated its believers with the idea: We have the true God, and the Jews have crucified Him.' The Church sowed hate instead of love, though the ten commandments state: Thou shalt not kill\\" (August 1943).Hermanns, William (1983). p. 63. \\"With a few exceptions, the Roman Catholic Church has stressed the value of dogma and ritual, conveying the idea theirs is the only way to reach heaven. I don't need to go to Church to hear if I'm good or bad; my heart tells me this\\" (August 1943).Hermanns, William (1983). p. 65. \\"I don't like to implant in youth the Church's doctrine of a personal God, because that Church has behaved so inhumanly in the past 2,000 years... Consider the hate the Church manifested against the Jews and then against the Muslims, the Crusades with their crimes, the burning stakes of the inquisition, the tacit consent of Hitler's actions while the Jews and the Poles dug their own graves and were slaughtered. And Hitler is said to have been an altar boy!\\" (August 1943). \\"Yes\\" Einstein replied vehemently, \\"It is indeed human, as proved by Cardinal Pacelli (the future Pope Pius XII), who was behind the Concordat with Hitler. Since when can one make a pact with Christ and Satan at the same time?\\" (August 1943). \\"The Church has always sold itself to those in power, and agreed to any bargain in return for immunity.\\" (August 1943)Hermanns, William (1983). p. 66. \\"If I were allowed to give advice to the Churches,\\" Einstein continued, \\"I would tell them to begin with a conversion among themselves, and to stop playing power politics. Consider what mass misery they have produced in Spain, South America and Russia.\\" (September 1948).Hermanns, William (1983). p. 105. In response to a Catholic convert who asked \\"Didn't you state that the Church was the only opponent of Communism?\\" Einstein replied, \\"I don't have to emphasise that the Church [sic] at last became a strong opponent of National Socialism, as well.\\" Einstein's secretary Helen Dukas added, \\"Dr. Einstein didn't mean only the Catholic church, but all churches.\\"Hermanns, William (1983). p. 119. When the convert mentioned that family members had been gassed by the Nazis, Einstein replied that \\"he also felt guilty‚Äîadding that the whole Church, beginning with the Vatican, should feel guilt.\\" (September 1948) When asked for more precise responses in 1954, Einstein replied: \\"About God, I cannot accept any concept based on the authority of the Church. [...] As long as I can remember, I have resented mass indoctrination. I do not believe in the fear of life, in the fear of death, in blind faith. I cannot prove to you that there is no personal God, but if I were to speak of him, I would be a liar. I do not believe in the God of theology who rewards good and punishes evil. My God created laws that take care of that. His universe is not ruled by wishful thinking but by immutable laws.\\"Hermanns, William (1983). p. 132. William Miller of Life Magazine who was present at this meeting described Einstein as looking like a \\"living saint\\" and speaking with \\"angelic indifference.\\"Miller, Pat (1955). \\"Death of a Genius\\" Life Magazine 38 (May 2): 62. Philosophical beliefs Einstein believed that when trying to understand nature one should engage in both philosophical enquiry and enquiry through the natural sciences.Stamp, Philip (2014). \\"Einstein: Philosophical Ideas.\\" Retrieved 14 February 2017. From a young age he had an interest in philosophy. Einstein said about himself: \\"As a young man I preferred books whose content concerned a whole world view and, in particular, philosophical ones. Schopenhauer, David Hume, Mach, to some extent Kant, Plato, Aristotle.\\" =Relationship between science and philosophy= Einstein believed that epistemology and science \\"are dependent upon each other. Epistemology without contact with science becomes an empty scheme. Science without epistemology is‚Äîinsofar as it is thinkable at all‚Äîprimitive and muddled.\\" =Free will= Like Spinoza, Einstein was a strict determinist who believed that human behavior was completely determined by causal laws. For that reason, he refused the chance aspect of quantum theory, famously telling Niels Bohr: \\"God does not play dice with the universe.\\"Gardner, Martin (1996). The Night Is Large: Collected Essays, 1938-1995. p. 430. In letters sent to physicist Max Born, Einstein revealed his belief in causal relationships: > You believe in a God who plays dice, and I in complete law and order in a > world which objectively exists, and which I in a wildly speculative way, am > trying to capture. I firmly believe, but I hope that someone will discover a > more realistic way, or rather a more tangible basis than it has been my lot > to find. Even the great initial success of the quantum theory does not make > me believe in the fundamental dice game, although I am well aware that some > of our younger colleagues interpret this as a consequence of senility.Adams, > John (1995). Risk. London: University College London Press, p. 17. Einstein's emphasis on 'belief' and how it connected with determinism was illustrated in a letter of condolence responding to news of the death of Michele Besso, one of his lifelong friends. Einstein wrote to the family: \\"Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.\\"Goldsmith, Donald and Marcia Bartusiak (2006). E = Einstein: His Life, His Thought, and His Influence on Our Culture. New York: Stirling Publishing, p. 187. Einstein had admitted to a fascination with philosopher Spinoza's deterministic version of pantheism. American philosopher Charles Hartshorne, in seeking to distinguish deterministic views with his own belief of free will panentheism, coined the distinct typology \\"Classical pantheism\\" to distinguish the views of those who hold similar positions to Spinoza's deterministic version of pantheism.David Ray, John B. Cobb, Clark H. Pinnock (2000). Searching for an Adequate God: A Dialogue Between Process and Free Will Theists, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000, p. 177. The Encyclopedia of Religion Volume 10 refers to this view as an \\"extreme monism\\" where, \\"God decides or determines everything, including our supposed decisions.\\" He was also an incompatibilist; in 1932 he said: > I do not believe in free will. Schopenhauer's words: 'Man can do what he > wants, but he cannot will what he wills,' accompany me in all situations > throughout my life and reconcile me with the actions of others, even if they > are rather painful to me. This awareness of the lack of free will keeps me > from taking myself and my fellow men too seriously as acting and deciding > individuals, and from losing my temper.Elkana, Yehuda and Adi Ophir, eds. > (1979).

THE REASON FOR > LIFE: According to Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and > Leo Tolstoy, Lamsi Publication (pp. 117-119) And yet, Einstein maintains that whether or not a particular human life is meaningful depends on how the individual conceives of his or her own life with respect to the lives of fellow human beings. A primitive human being in this regard is one whose life is entirely devoted to the gratification of instinctual needs. Whereas Einstein accepts that the gratification of basic needs is a legitimate and indispensable goal, he regards it nevertheless as an elementary goal. The transition of the human mind from its initial and infantile state of disconnectedness (selfishness) to a state of unity with the universe, according to Einstein, requires the exercise of four types of freedoms: freedom from self, freedom of expression, freedom from time, and freedom of independence.Einstein, A. (1954). Ideas and Opinions (Trans.: Sonja Bergmann) New York (crown). p. 31 =Humanism and moral philosophy= Einstein was a secular humanist and a supporter of the Ethical Culture movement. He served on the advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York.Dowbiggin, Ian (2003). A Merciful End. New York: Oxford University Press, p. 41. For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. He observed, \\"Without 'ethical culture' there is no salvation for humanity.\\"Einstein, Albert (1995). Ideas And Opinions. New York: Random House, p. 62. He was an honorary associate of the British humanist organization the Rationalist Press Association and its journal was among the items present on his desk at his death. With regard to punishment by God, Einstein stated, \\"I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modeled after our own ‚Äî a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms.\\"Seldes, George (1996). The Great Thoughts. New York: Ballantine Books, p. 134. \\"A God who rewards and punishes is inconceivable to him for the simple reason that a man's actions are determined by necessity, external and internal, so that in God's eyes he cannot be responsible, any more than an inanimate object is responsible for the motions it undergoes. Science has therefore been charged with undermining morality, but the charge is unjust. A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hopes of reward after death. It is therefore easy to see why the churches have always fought science and persecuted its devotees.\\"Calaprice, Alice (2000). The Expanded Quotable Einstein. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 216. Albert Einstein, \\"Religion and Science\\" New York Times Magazine (9 Nov. 1930): 3-4. On the importance of ethics he wrote, \\"The most important human endeavor is the striving for morality in our actions. Our inner balance and even our very existence depend on it. Only morality in our actions can give beauty and dignity to life. To make this a living force and bring it to clear consciousness is perhaps the foremost task of education. The foundation of morality should not be made dependent on myth nor tied to any authority lest doubt about the myth or about the legitimacy of the authority imperil the foundation of sound judgment and action.\\"Dukas, Helen (1981). Albert Einstein, The Human Side. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 95. Letter to a Brooklyn minister November 20, 1950. \\"I do not believe that a man should be restrained in his daily actions by being afraid of punishment after death or that he should do things only because in this way he will be rewarded after he dies. This does not make sense. The proper guidance during the life of a man should be the weight that he puts upon ethics and the amount of consideration that he has for others.\\"Bucky, Peter (1992). The Private Albert Einstein. Kansas City: Andrews & McMeel, p. 86. \\"I cannot conceive of a personal God who would directly influence the actions of individuals, or would directly sit in judgment on creatures of his own creation. I cannot do this in spite of the fact that mechanistic causality has, to a certain extent, been placed in doubt by modern science. My religiosity consists in a humble admiration of the infinitely superior spirit that reveals itself in the little that we, with our weak and transitory understanding, can comprehend of reality. Morality is of the highest importance‚Äîbut for us, not for God.\\"Dukas, Helen (1981). Albert Einstein, The Human Side. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 66. =Teleology= In a conversation with Ugo Onufri in 1955, with regards to nature's purpose he said, \\"I have never imputed to Nature a purpose or goal, or anything that could be understood as anthropomorphic.\\" In a 1947 letter he stated, \\"I feel also not able to imagine some will or goal outside the human sphere.\\" =Epistemology=Na√Øve realism Einstein believed na√Øve realism was \\"relatively simple\\" to disprove. He agreed with Bertrand Russell that humans observe the effects objects have on them (greenness, coldness, hardness etc) and not the actual objects themselves. Positivism Einstein declared that he was no positivist, and maintained that we use with a certain right concepts to which there is no access from the materials of sensory experience. =Transcendental Idealism= Einstein considered that Kant‚Äôs \\"denial of the objectivity of space can (...) hardly be taken seriously\\". He also believed that \\"if Kant had known what is known to us today of the natural order, I am certain that he would have fundamentally revised his philosophical conclusions. Kant built his structure upon the foundations of the world outlook of Kepler and Newton. Now that the foundation has been undermined, the structure no longer stands.\\" =Opinions on philosophers=David Hume Einstein was an admirer of the philosophy of David Hume; in 1944 he said \\"If one reads Hume‚Äôs books, one is amazed that many and sometimes even highly esteemed philosophers after him have been able to write so much obscure stuff and even find grateful readers for it. Hume has permanently influenced the development of the best philosophers who came after him.\\" Immanuel Kant Some sources maintain that Einstein read the three Critiques at the age of 16 and studied Kant as a teenager. However Philip Stamp states that this is contradicted by some of his own claims. In 1949, Einstein said that he \\"did not grow up in the Kantian tradition, but came to understand the truly valuable which is to be found in his doctrine, alongside of errors which today are quite obvious, only quite late.\\" In one of Einstein's letters in 1918 to Max Born, Einstein said that he was starting to discover this \\"truly valuable\\" in Kant: \\"I am reading Kant's Prolegomena here, among other things, and I am beginning to comprehend the enormous suggestive power that emanated from the fellow, and still does. Once you concede to him merely the existence of synthetic a priori judgements, you are trapped. Anyway it is nice to read him, even if it is not as good as his predecessor Hume's work. Hume also had a far sounder instinct.\\" Einstein explained the significance of Kant's philosophy as follows: Arthur Schopenhauer Schopenhauer's views on the independence of spatially separated systems influenced Einstein, who called him a genius. In their view it was a necessary assumption that the mere difference in location suffices to make two systems different, with the two states having their own real physical state, independent of the state of the other. In Einstein's Berlin study three figures hung on the wall: Faraday, Maxwell and Schopenhauer. Einstein described, concerning the personal importance of Schopenhauer for him, Schopenhauer's words as \\"a continual consolation in the face of life‚Äôs hardships, my own and others‚Äô, and an unfailing wellspring of tolerance.\\" Although Schopenhauer's works are known for their pessimism, Konrad Wachsmann remembered, \\"He often sat with one of the well-worn Schopenhauer volumes, and as he sat there, he seemed so pleased, as if he were engaged with a serene and cheerful work.\\" Ernst Mach Einstein liked Ernst Mach's scientific work, though not his philosophical work. He said \\"Mach was as good a scholar of mechanics as he was a deplorable philosopher\\".

It inhabits banks of deep-sea coral at depths of , feeding on cephalopods, shrimp, and bony fishes. This species can be identified by its wide body and head, and the dark saddle-like markings on its back. It also has small spots that fluoresce yellow under a blue light. Adult blotched catsharks have not been observed; the largest immature specimen is long. Like other catsharks, it is believed to be oviparous. This species is not dangerous to humans and has no commercial significance; the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not have enough data to assess its conservation status. Taxonomy The blotched catshark was first scientifically described in 1966 by American ichthyologist Stewart Springer, based on a long immature male caught off Cape Canaveral, Florida. He named it after Giles W. Mead, who brought the original specimen to his attention. From 1970 to 1979, this species was regarded as a subspecies of the chain catshark (S. retifer). Distribution and habitat The blotched catshark has been recorded from North Carolina southward to the Santaren Channel between Florida, the Bahamas, Cuba, as well as in the Cayman Trench off northern Jamaica, and in the Gulf of Mexico north of the Yucatan Peninsula. This rare shark inhabits the upper continental slope, at a depth of . A bottom-dwelling species, blotched catsharks are usually found amongst deepwater coral banks composed largely of Lophelia pertusa.Ross, S.W., K.J. Sulak and M.S. Nizinski (2003). \\"Deep Coral Bank Fishes on the Southeastern United States Slope: Is There a Deep Water Primary Reef Ichthyofauna?\\" Eos Transactions AGU 84 (52): Ocean Sciences Meeting Supplement, Abstract OS52J-07. Description All blotched catshark specimens collected thus far have been immature, the largest male measuring in length and the largest female in length. This shark has a broad, heavily built head and body, tapering greatly towards the tail. The flaps of skin beside the nares are small and do not reach the mouth. The teeth in the upper jaw are exposed when the mouth is closed, and there are furrows at the corners of the lower jaw. The first dorsal fin originates over the pelvic fins, while the second dorsal fin originates over the anal fin. The caudal fin is nearly horizontal, with an indistinct lower lobe and a prominent notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The skin is relatively smooth, as the dermal denticles are small and flattened. The coloration consists of a plain dark background with 7-8 darker, more or less prominent saddles. Like the related chain catshark, the blotched catshark exhibits fluorescence, with small spots on its back that glow yellow under a blue light.Barbarite, G. (July 22, 2009). Bioluminescence 2009: July 22 Log. NOAA Ocean Explorer. Retrieved on July 29, 2009. Biology and ecology The blotched catshark preys on cephalopods, shrimp, and bony fishes of surprisingly large size. Its internal anatomy suggests that it lays encapsulated eggs like the other members of its family, though these egg cases have not been observed. The sizes of the known immature specimens suggest that the adults are relatively large. Human interactions Harmless to humans and rarely caught by fisheries, the blotched catshark is of no economic importance. It has been assessed as Data Deficient by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

Early years  Jules Marquard Eichorn was born in San Francisco on February 7, 1912 to Hilmar and Frieda Eichorn, who were immigrants from Germany. As a youngster, he often hiked on the slopes of Mount Tamalpais in Marin County, California with his parents and siblings. He showed musical talent and began studying violin from Ansel Adams at a young age. In 1927, he began piano lessons, and his first instructor was Ansel Adams. Eichorn was also Adams's first piano student. That summer, Eichorn joined Adams on the Sierra Club annual High Trip, which included a climb of Alta Peak in Sequoia National Park. That climb sparked the 15-year-old Eichorn's love of mountaineering.Scree, Peak Climbing Section, Loma Prieta Chapter, Sierra Club, April, 2000, Vol. 34 No. 4 Eichorn worked for Ansel Adams washing photographic prints and hauling photographic equipment in exchange for piano lessons, and their friendship lasted until Adams's death in 1984. After graduating from Lick-Wilmerding High School in San Francisco in 1929, Eichorn traveled to the Teton Range of Wyoming in 1930 for a summer climbing trip.  Mountaineering achievements  On July 6, 1930, during the Sierra Club's annual High Trip, he first teamed up with Glen Dawson to make the third ascent of Red-and-White Mountain in the Sierra. They continued at a fast pace to climb Mount Abbot, Bear Creek Spire, Mount Dade, Turret Peak, Mount Darwin, The Hermit, Mount McGee, a first ascent of the (later named) Mount Mendel, Mount Goddard, Devils Crags, Mount Woodworth, Middle Palisade, Mount Sill, North Palisade, Polemonium Peak, Mount Winchell and Mount Agassiz. All of these climbs were completed in 24 days. Sierra Club Secretary Will Colby wrote, \\"Some youthful enthusiasts, including Glen Dawson, Jules Eichorn and John Olmstead, swarmed over everything that looked formidable in the way of a mountain peak.\\"Oliver, Bill, A Tribute to the Honorary Members of the Sierra Peaks Section - Past & Present: Norman Clyde, Glen Dawson and Jules Eichorn, The Sierra Echo, Volume 33 Number 6, Nov-Dec 1989 In 1931, Sierra Club leader Francis P. Farquhar invited Harvard philosophy professor and Appalachian Mountain Club member Robert L. M. Underhill to come to the Sierra Nevada to teach the latest techniques of roped climbing. Underhill had learned these techniques in the Alps, and had used them earlier that summer in the Tetons and the Canadian Rockies. Jules Eichorn was among the first group of Californians who practiced these techniques on Mount Ritter and Banner Peak in the Ritter Range. After the basic course was completed, the more advanced students, including Eichorn, his climbing partner Glen Dawson, Norman Clyde, Lewis Clark, and Bestor Robinson traveled south to the Palisades, the most rugged and alpine part of the Sierra Nevada. There, on August 13, 1931, the party completed the first ascent of the last unclimbed 14,000+ foot peak in California, which remained unnamed due to its remote location above the Palisade Glaciers. After a challenging ascent to the summit, the climbers were caught in an intense lightning storm, and Eichorn barely escaped electrocution when \\"a thunderbolt whizzed right by my ear\\". The mountain was named Thunderbolt Peak to commemorate that close call.Farquhar, Francis P., History of the Sierra Nevada (University of California Press, Berkeley, 1965) Underhill called Dawson and Eichorn \\"young natural-born rock climbers of the first water.\\" Jones, Chris, Climbing in North America (American Alpine Club & University of California Press, Berkeley, 1976) Photo of Jules Eichorn, Norman Clyde, Robert L. M. Underhill and Glen Dawson taken the day after the first ascent of the East Face of Mount Whitney. Three days later on August 16, Eichorn, Clyde, Underhill and Dawson completed the first ascent of the East Face of Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the contiguous United States. The route was extremely exposed, especially the famous Fresh Air Traverse. Eichorn was just 19 years old. Steve Roper called this route \\"one of the classic routes of the Sierra, partly because of its spectacular location and partly because it was the first really big wall to be climbed in the range.\\"Roper, Steve, The Climber's Guide to the High Sierra ( San Francisco, Sierra Club Books, 1976) Porcella & Burns wrote that \\"the climb heralded a new standard of technical competence in Californian rock climbing . . .\\"Porcella, Stephen P. & Burns, Cameron M., Climbing California's Fourteeners: 183 Routes to the Fifteen Highest Peaks (The Mountaineers, Seattle, 1998) , Eichorn's 1931 experiences led to a lifelong friendship with Norman Clyde, who was, by most accounts, California's greatest mountaineer of the first half of the 20th century. These two classic climbs were among at least 26 first ascents that Eichorn completed in the High Sierra between 1930 and 1952. His other first ascents included the Dragtooth, Finger Peaks, Matthes crest, Eichorn Minaret, Waller Minaret, Clyde Spires, Mt. McGee, Frustration Turret, Pyramidal Pinnacle, and Red Spur. His first ascents of new routes on previously climbed peaks include Matterhorn Peak, Mount Hoffmann, Cathedral Peak, Banner Peak, Michael Minaret, Mount Winchell, Temple Crag, Middle Palisade, the ridge traverse from North Palisade to Starlight Peak, Deerhorn Mountain, Mt. Ericsson, Mount Russell and three routes on the Devil's Crags.Roper, Steve, The Climber's Guide to the High Sierra ( San Francisco, Sierra Club Books, 1976, pages 327 - 368) In early August 1933, young solo climber and guidebook author Walter A. Starr, Jr., nicknamed \\"Pete\\", disappeared in the Minarets. Beginning on August 15, a dozen skilled climbers including Eichorn, Clyde and Dawson spent four days searching unsuccessfully for Pete Starr. Norman Clyde continued to search alone, and discovered Starr's body on Michael Minaret on August 25, where he had fallen to his death. Eichorn and Clyde later climbed back to the location of the body, and interred the remains in a mountain tomb that they built on the ledge. Eichorn handled the body as Clyde had an aversion to touching corpses. Starr's grateful (and wealthy) parents rewarded Eichorn with a scholarship to the University of California, Berkeley, where he majored in music and earned a teaching credential.Pavlik, Robert C., Norman Clyde: Legendary Mountaineer of California' Sierra Nevada (Heyday Books, Berkeley, 2008) In 1934, Eichorn, Robinson and Dick Leonard of the Cragmont Climbing Club assembled the most advanced set of climbing gear then in use in North America, much of which they had obtained from Germany, and successfully climbed Higher Cathedral Spire in Yosemite Valley. This was the first major technical ascent in the valley that later became a mecca of rock climbing. This was the first climb in California to utilize pitons. Writing about this climb, Bestor Robinson described Eichorn's \\"remarkable sense of balance and ability to stick to next to nothing.\\" In the late 1930s, Eichorn contracted Coccidioidomycosis, also called Valley Fever, a potentially fatal fungal disease that affects the lungs. This infection kept him out of the military during World War II. Instead, he spent the war years teaching mountaineering skills to rangers in Yosemite National Park.  Environmental leader  Jules Eichorn at a Sierra Club Mountaineering Base Camp in the Minarets Range of the Sierra Nevada in the late 1970s Eichorn taught instrumental, orchestral and choral music in the Woodside High School for several decades. In the 1950s, he led month-long \\"cache and carry\\" youth hikes in the Sierra Nevada and also served as a volunteer on Sierra Club mountaineering base camp trips through the 1970s. He collaborated with Sierra mule packer Charley Robinson on several of these trips, moving supplies to hikers and climbers using a mule train. He became a political activist, opposing development and wetland filling along the San Mateo County, California coast of San Francisco Bay. He was an active member of the Loma Prieta chapter of the Sierra Club for many years. In 1961, he was elected to the national Board of Directors of the Sierra Club, and served from 1961 to 1967. Among his colleagues on the board in those years was Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, photographer Ansel Adams and Pulitzer Prize- winning novelist Wallace Stegner. San Francisco Genealogy: The Sierra Club Roster of Past Officers, 1892 - 1969 Eichorn died in his sleep at his home in Redwood City, California on February 15, 2000, eight days after his 88th birthday.  Legacy  Eichorn Pinnacle on Cathedral Peak Two Sierra Nevada peaks are named after Jules Eichorn. Eichorn Pinnacle (~10,940 feet) is the spectacular west summit of Cathedral Peak near Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite National Park. Jules Eichorn climbed this pinnacle in 1931. Eichorn Minaret (12,255 feet) is one of the Minarets in the Ritter Range, located in the Ansel Adams Wilderness. The Jules Eichorn Memorial Grove is located in Big Basin Redwoods State Park in Santa Cruz County, California. Eichorn was the winner of the Sierra Club's Francis P.

The first flight of the E430 took place from the Yuneec factory near Shanghai, China on June 12, 2009.Bayerl, Robby; Martin Berkemeier; et al: World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2011-12, page 85. WDLA UK, Lancaster UK, 2011. Design The E430 is a two-seat, V tailed, composite aircraft with a high-aspect ratio wing. Take-off speed is 40 mph, cruise speed is 60 mph, and max speed is 95 mph. The company claims that the battery packs have an expected lifespan of 1500 hours and cost US$7000 each, with the aircraft carrying 3-5 battery packs, giving two to two and half hours endurance. The batteries can be recharged in 3‚Äì4 hours from a 220 volt outlet. The company projected that by the time the first customers would require replacement battery packs that improved and less expensive ones would have been available. Development The aircraft was being developed as a kit aircraft for the US market. The development of the E430 was funded entirely by Yuneec CEO Tian Yu. The company had planned to construct a 260,000 square foot (25,000 sq m) factory to produce the aircraft in Shanghai, that was expected to open in October 2009. Production of the E430 was planned to commence in late 2010 and first customer deliveries were initially forecast for early 2011. The design was first flown on 12 June 2009 and then shipped for further testing to Camarillo, California. On 14 July 2009 the prototype aircraft was registered in the USA as N386CX and on 18 July 2009 it was given a Certificate of Airworthiness by the Federal Aviation Administration and further test flights were carried out, totalling 22 hours. The prototype E430 was then shipped by truck to Wisconsin and displayed at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh in July 2009. It was also on display at that venue in summer of 2010. Yuneec was working on developing a solar-cell installation for the wings that will recharge the aircraft's batteries. In July 2009 the company estimated that the price for a commercially available light sport aircraft production version of the E430 would be US$89,000. At AirVenture 2010 the company announced that it would start accepting orders for the aircraft after the show. At that date the aircraft was advertised as having an endurance of 2.25 to 2.5 hours with a useful load of . Deliveries were initially scheduled for late 2011, but by the end of 2012 there was no indication that more than prototypes had been completed. In June 2013 it was announced that the aircraft would be produced, marketed and supported by GreenWing International, however that company went out of business in about 2014. Operational history The E430 was named the winner of the Lindberg prize for electric aircraft at AirVenture in 2010. In the same year it was named Brit Insurance Design of the Year in the transport category. By December 2012 a total of two examples had been registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration. The first one was the initial prototype shipped to the US, registered in the Experimental - Exhibition category on 14 July 2009, although its registration expired on 1 May 2013 and was not renewed. The second was registered in the Experimental - Research and Development category on 26 January 2011 to Flying Tian of Monterey Park, California.

The gun was named after Nikolaus von Dreyse, the designer of the Dreyse Needle Gun. The Waffenfabrik von Dreyse company was acquired by Rheinische Metallwaren & Maschinenfabrik S√∂mmerda in 1901, although the Dreyse Model pistols were marketed under the Dreyse name. The pistol had an interesting feature for the time: when the gun was ready to fire, the firing pin projected through the back of the breech block, serving as an early handgun-cocking indicator. For cleaning, the frame, receiver and slide pivoted forward on a pin in front of the trigger guard. The pistol and its derivatives (Dreyse Model 1907 Pocket Pistol, Dreyse Model 1912 Parabellum) was of simple blowback recoil operation, though of unusual design.c The same company also manufactured a 6.35 mm pocket version (also named Model 1907). In 1912 the 9 mm Parabellum Dreyse Model 1912 emerged as the gun's successor. Marked as the RM & M Dreyse, it was chambered for 9 mm Parabellum. Despite the gun's limited production time, the gun is relatively common today, in large part due to its use by Volkssturm and Volksgrenadier late in World War II, enabling many Allied personnel to bring examples home as war trophies. Dreyse company The Waffenfabrik von Dreyse was founded around 1841 to manufacture the famous Dreyse Needle gun for the Prussian Army, and they also made needle-pistols and caplock revolvers. The Dreyse Factory went into decline after the German Army adopted the Mauser in 1872. In 1901 Rheinische Metallwaren- & Maschinenfabrik of S√∂mmerda purchased Waffenfabrik von Dreyse. Development Presstoff late-war holster issued to Volksgrenadiers The Model 1907 Dreyse Pistol was designed by Louis Schmeisser (who had previously worked with Theodor Bergmann on the Bergmann Machine Gun) in 1905‚Äì1906 and were marketed from 1907 onward. The first gun, the 7.65 mm Auto was the most unusual. Most of the cranked slide lay along the top of the barrel, with a short section projecting down behind the chamber to serve as the breech block. The breech block was confined within a flat-sided frame with a bridge to carry the back sight and arrest the upper section of the slide. The recoil spring surrounded the barrel, enclosed in the frame and held by a collar engaging the front end of the slide through a spring catch. Pulling back on the finger grips at the front of the slide brings the breech block into view behind the frame. The Dreyse pistol was fired by a striker whose tail protruded back through the rear of the breech block when the chamber was loaded. The entire top section of frame and slide could be pivoted on a pin in front of the trigger guard, being locked in the firing position by a catch at the rear of the frame. This final refinement was essential to dismantling; removal of the cranked slide would have been impossible otherwise. The Dreyse design was strongly influenced by John Browning's FN M1900, though the Browning had its recoil spring above the barrel, while the Dreyse had a concentric recoil spring. Nonetheless, the overall shape was the same, as was the grip angle and surface design, the magazine release, the positioning of the manual safety and the breech blocks. Design modifications The only major modification concerned the firing mechanism. Prior to 1915, the cocked striker had been held by the sear before being released by the trigger; pulling the trigger subsequently pushed the striker back before releasing it, compressing the striker spring to a greater extent. Another wartime change involved a recess cut in the top front of the slide to facilitate removal of the recoil-spring retaining bush. Variants Early pistols were marked 'DREYSE Rheinische Metallwaren- & Maschinenfabrik ABT. SOMMERDA' on the left side of the frame and an 'RMF' monogram on the grips as shown above. Later pistols are usually marked 'DREYSE RHEINMETALL ABT. SOMMERDA'. A few pistols made in 1914 lack the 'DREYSE' marking. The pistol was also marketed commercially for police forces, including the Royal Saxon Gendarmerie, examples of which are marked as 'K. Sachs. Gend.' Military Users Primarily used by Austrian troops during World War I, especially officers of the Austro- Hungarian Habsburg Empire. Also used by officers of Imperial Germany during World War I. Examples issued to the Imperial German Army will have an acceptance proof above the ejection port on the right as well as the normal Crown N commercial proofs on the left side of the frame and slide near the trigger. Examples saw use by Wehrmacht troops (especially officers) during World War II. Nearing the end of the war many examples were issued to the Volksgrenadiere and Volkssturm, the latter often with so-called \\"last-ditch\\" Presstoff holsters. Large numbers of these were brought back to the United States by returning servicemen, which accounts for their availability in the country today. Typically the paper Presstoff holsters have not survived. A few thousand were purchased by the Czech military in 1921 and 1922, but they were removed from service in 1923 due to unspecified accidents with them. In 1912 the pope's Swiss Guard acquired thirty of these pistols for use by officers and non-commissioned officers. They remained in service until 1990 when they were replaced by the SIG P225 pistol as the P75.Oertle, V. \\"Vom Remington zum Sturmgewehr 90: Die Schusswaffen der Papstlichen Schweizergarde\\", page 22. Thesis, 2001 During World War II this pistol found its way to the Norwegian resistance. Quite a few of these pistols have, alongside home-made Sten-guns and illegal radios, been found hidden within the house-walls of Norwegian resistance members and sympathisers. There has not been described any action in Norway with any Dreyse-pistols. As for the unspecified \\"accidents\\" with these pistols, the rear latch which holds the hinged upper part, may come loose. If this happens, the striker WILL move forward and ignite the cartridge. An unconfirmed civilian incident happened in the 80\`s, where the shooter pierced his foot with the 7.65mm as a result of the latch coming loose. Importation The Dreyse M1907 was never imported officially by contract into the United States, but significant numbers of them were brought back by GIs following World War II. Users  * : 110 batches, obtained in 1919-1920 : 30 batches, replaced by SIG P75 Notable examples The Deutsches Panzermuseum in Munster, Germany has an M1907 as the first display in its exhibit of German Army sidearms.  In popular culture  The Dreyse M1907 appeared in the earlier versions of the board game Cluedo, mislabelled as a revolver. The \\"Dreyse 1906\\" is depicted in Fritz Lang's 1933 film The Testament of Dr. Mabuse by former detective Hofmeister, and is the favorite weapon of the assassin Hardy, to kill Dr. Kramm. After Hardy's death, Inspector Lohmann muses that Hardy must have used the \\"1906 Dreyse\\" pistol because he was used to it, even though \\"these guns have been out of style for a long time.\\" The film was banned in Germany by Joseph Goebbels, and was not shown in Germany until 1951. The M1907 appears as the police service weapon of Inspector Gereon Rath, the male protagonist of the 2017 German limited run series, Babylon Berlin, which is set in the German Weimar Republic.

Unlike most military sniper rifles, the Haskins was purpose-built for the military, not reworked from an existing civilian firearm - another such sniper rifle was the Soviet SVD. The Haskins was developed from a US Army requirement for an antimaterial capability. Standard 7.62√ó51mm sniper rifles were unable to meet the penetration requirements. Several experimental cartridges were produced, culminating in a convertible lightweight bolt-action rifle able to use .50 caliber machine-gun cartridges, or a lighter, faster, then-wildcat cartridge optimized for antipersonnel use, with some antimaterial ability. The US Army declined to purchase the lighter rifle, but purchased a small number of the .50 caliber rifles. They are now used by some United States Army Special Forces snipers. The Haskins m500 sniper rifle fires a .50 caliber round as far as 2 km and can still hit a target the size of a garbage bin. Although not adopted in large numbers by the US, the weapon served as a testbed for new sniper ammunition. The cartridge originally used, the 8.58√ó71mm, was eventually developed by the Lapua-Nammo Oy company in Finland into the .338 Lapua Magnum. The Haskins was a bolt-action, magazine-fed weapon, featuring a steel receiver with a rotating bolt. The bolt had 3 long lugs which locked into the receiver walls. The weapon could use one of two cartridges: the 7.62√ó51mm NATO and the 8.58√ó71 mm. Switching between calibers was relatively simple, requiring that only the barrel and bolt head be replaced. William Brophy, an American Army Ordnance officer when discussing comparable weapons stated: The Haskins featured a detachable scope mount, heavy precision barrel, a folding bipod, a fully adjustable trigger and could be disassembled for ease of carry and storage. The Haskins was used by the Provisional Irish Republican Army to fire upon British troops in Northern Ireland. It became highly feared; this weapon was the cause of many deaths.

She was born and raised in the Bronx, New York, and is one of the founders of the Nuyorican poetry movement. She has published collections of poetry and has conducted literary programs at New York City Board of Education, the Caribbean Cultural Center, and El Museo del Barrio. Esteves has served as the executive director of the African Caribbean Poetry Theater. She lives in New York City. Life Esteves was born in the South Bronx to a Puerto Rican sailor, Charlie Esteves, and a Dominican garment worker, Christina Huyghue. Her father separated before Esteves‚Äô birth from her mother but Esteves maintained a close connection with the Puerto Rican side of her family while her mother had broken ties to her Dominican past.Estill, Adriana. \\"Sandra Mar√≠a Esteves.\\" In Latino and Latina Writers (vol. 2), ed. Alan West Duran, 873-883. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2004. Esteves, Sandra Maria. ‚ÄúSandra Maria Esteves.‚Äù Puerto Rican Poetry: An Anthology from Aboriginal to Contemporary Times, ed. Roberto Marquez, U of Massachusetts Press, 2007, pp. 422-423. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vk7d3.65. Accessed 9 Nov 2018. Her mother was concerned early on with her upbringing in the challenging environment of their neighborhood of Hunts Point, and thus enrolled her in a primary Catholic boarding school in the Lower East Side, Holy Rosary Academy. She would later continue at St. Anslem for middle school and then graduate from Cardinal Spellman High School in the Bronx. During her early education she experienced traumatic anti-Hispanic prejudice that caused her to switch languages from Spanish to English-dominant. She also experienced issues of colorism within her family. She went on her first trip at seventeen to the island of Puerto Rico to better understand herself but was left further questioning her identity as she found all the ways she did not fit in with the people and culture on the island. She was not fully discouraged from exploring her identity after this experience though. She would then enroll at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn to pursue her artistic passion since the age of seven as a graphic artist, but continued to struggle with her identity as well as the criticism she received for her work and dropped out after the first year; she would, however, return and complete her degree in 1978. While she did find lack of support during her initial time at Pratt, one Japanese professor who specialized in sculpture, Toshio Odate, encouraged her to look at how words could contribute to her work as a visual artist. This, along with the inspiration she found in attending the poetry readings at the National Black Theater of Harlem she would find herself becoming a founding member of, all helped her to begin to utilizing poetry as a medium to grapple with her identity crisis. Esteves joined El Grupo, an artistic collective who performed with the intention of leading social change; this would serve as the foundation and core for the Nuyorican movement itself. As a performing poet, she read in the Nuyorican Poets Caf√© during its first launch in 1974 under Miguel Algar√≠n and Miguel Pi√±ero as well as its reopening in 1988. She was also one of two featured poets on El Grupo's LP Canciones y poes√≠a de la lucha de los pueblos latinoamericanos/ Songs and Poetry of the Latin American Struggle, released in 1974, alongside Jes√∫s Papoleto Mel√©ndez. Her reach was not exclusive to Loisaida, though, as she also spent several years as the executive director and producer of the African Caribbean Poetry Theater from 1983 until 1988, as well as performing with Taller Boricua, which helped cultivate a distinction within her poetry compared with her male Nuyorican counterparts. Since then she has continued her involvement in numerous community organization projects and performing workshops dedicated to youth outreach via the arts and writing, partnering with associations throughout New York City such as, but not exclusive to, the New York State Poets in the Schools Program (1981-1989), the Caribbean Cultural Center and African Diaspora Institute, the New Rican Village Cultural Center, the Cultural Council Foundation of the Artistic Project of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, the Teachers and Writers Collaborative, and the Bronx Music Heritage Center. Poetic Contributions Urayo√°n Noel has noted that Sandra Maria Esteves' poetry is an example of ‚Äúorganic poetics‚Äù due to the evolutionary nature of her poetry alongside her politicized growth in conjunction with her personal growth with her identity. Her distinguishing poetic quality can be recognized through those she deemed her mentors, who include Julia de Burgos, Nicolas Guillen, and Pablo Neruda, as well as who she kept close to, which included fellow Nuyoricans Miguel Algar√≠n and Miguel Pi√±ero but also African-American writers Ntozake Shange and Michael Harper. The themes that she frequently addresses are identity struggles‚Äîmost notably her personally comprehension of her place as an Afro-Caribbean but also as challenges to her mentors and peers (‚ÄúA Julia y a Mi‚Äù for Julia de Burgos, ‚Äú3:00 AM Eulogy for a Small Time Poet‚Äù presumably for Miguel Pi√±ero), parsing out feminism within the Latino culture, oppression of women, metapoems describing poetry as a tool to instill change, motherhood and birth, and mysticism and spiritualism. Her first poetry collection Yerba Buena: Dibujos y poemas was published in 1980 and holds the accolade of being one of the first poetry books published by a Latina in the United States. While most known for the poetry within, it also contains art she created to pair with the written words. One of the most well-known poems from the collection, ‚ÄúA la Mujer Borrinquena,‚Äù details the life of the character Maria Cristina who takes on the role of the Puerto Rican woman as she is idealized in one sense‚Äîdedicated to supporting her family‚Äîwhile maintaining awareness of her role and how despite seemingly falling in line with what is expected of her, her actions serve as a mode of protection of her family but even more so her culture. This would be challenged by Luz Maria Umpierre, who wrote ‚ÄúIn Response‚Äù and criticized the construction of Maria Cristina's, and Esteves‚Äô, feminism by utilizing the original poem's format to construct a new female character that aggressively opposes traditional sex roles. Esteves would respond once again in her third collection, Bluestown Mockingbird Mambo, with the poem ‚ÄúSo Your Name Isn't Maria Cristina‚Äù and uses her words to recognize the value in Umpierre's words but reaffirms the autonomy that can be found within Maria Cristina's actions as well, validating the diverse ways to work against patriarchal oppression. Her second poetry collection, Tropical Rains: A Bilingual Downpour, was published in 1984 but did not see the wide success of Yerba Buena, potentially due to the fact that it was self-published. It is where Esteves further expounds upon her identity as an Afro-Caribbean alongside that of a Nuyorican, as well as where she begins exploring the complexities of motherhood and the maternal female figure. Bluestown Mockingbird Mambo was published in 1990 and remains her most widely distributed collection. As the title suggests, she draws on various musical genres that have influenced and defined her identity such as blues and jazz coming from the African-American community alongside mambo, salsa, bomba, and plena from the Latino community to influence her writing here. It is also where she begins to expand beyond struggles within the Latino community and develops multicultural voices beyond her own to further elaborate on the oppressions that envelop numerous communities of women and the need for alliance formation to create widespread change.

Background News spread that the state-run Tonghua Iron and Steel Group (TISG) was being taken over by the privately owned Beijing Jianlong (Âª∫Èæô) Steel Holdings, formed in 1999 by Zhang Zhixiang (Âº†ÂøóÁ••), an iron and steel merchant from Jiaxing. Jianlong Steel had previously purchased a 36.19% stake in TISG in 2005 during the privatization attempt launched by the Chinese government, and despite not having a majority representation, Jianglong Steel Holdings nonetheless managed to have most of the managerial staff demoted and replaced by managers from Jianglong, under the claim of attempting to improve the performance of TISG. However, the managerial shake up did not bring improvement as Jianlong had promised, but instead, TISG continued its downward spiral, resulting in most of TISG workers losing their pay, with many of them suffering in the harsh cold of winter when their heat was turned off as they could not afford to pay the heating bills. By the second quarter of 2009, TISG had lost over 11 billion yuan ($159.5 million) since the 2005 Jianlong takeover and its managerial reshuffle. Jianlong Steel responded by selling out all of its shares of TISG, begun to get out completely at the start of 2009, citing that Jianglong could no longer handle the unacceptable loss of TISG, and by March 2009, Jianlong claimed that it was completely out and no longer responsible for TISG. However, as the market rebounded, TISG once again begun to make profits, pulling in a profit of 45 million yuan ($6,255,00) in June alone.

The total installed capacity is 20,000 MW (combining solar power). Bangladesh's energy sector is booming. Recently Bangladesh started construction of the 2.4-gigawatt (GW) Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant expected to go into operation in 2023. According to the Bangladesh Power Development Board in July 2018, 90 percent of the population had access to electricity. However per capita energy consumption in Bangladesh is considered low. Electricity is the major source of power for most of the country's economic activities. Bangladesh's total installed electricity generation capacity (including captive power) was 15,351 megawatts (MW) as of January 2017 and 20,000 megawatts in 2018. The largest energy consumers in Bangladesh are industries and the residential sector, followed by the commercial and agricultural sectors. As of 2015, 92% of the urban population and 67% of the rural population had access to electricity. An average of 77.9% of the population had access to electricity in Bangladesh. Bangladesh will need an estimated 34,000 MW of power by 2030 to sustain its economic growth of over 7 percent. Problems in Bangladesh's electric power sector include high system losses, delays in completion of new plants, low plant efficiency, erratic power supply, electricity theft, blackouts, and shortages of funds for power plant maintenance. Overall, the country's generation plants have been unable to meet system demand over the past decade. On 2 November 2014, electricity was restored after a day-long nationwide blackout. A transmission line from India had failed, which \\"led to a cascade of failures throughout the national power grid,\\" and criticism of \\"old grid infrastructure and poor management.\\" However, in a recent root-cause analysis report the investigating team has clarified that the fault was actually due to lack of coordination and poor health of transmission and distribution infrastructure that caused the blackout. Sources of energy As of 2011, 79 natural gas wells were present in the 23 operational gas fields which produce over per day of gas. It is well short of over per day that is demanded, a number which is growing by around 7% each year. In fact, more than three-quarters of the nation's commercial energy demand is being met by natural gas. This influential sector caters for around 40% of the power plant feed-stock, 17% of industries, 15% captive power, 11% for domestic and household usage, another 11% for fertilizers, 5% in Compressed natural gas (CNG) activities and 1% for commercial and agricultural uses. CNG is substituting more that US$0.8 billion worth of foreign exchange annually and is also used in most vehicles on the road. In addition to CNG, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is also demanded at around 0.1 million tons. The nation furthermore demands 3.5 million tons of oil imports in addition to almost 2 million tons of diesel to feed oil-based power plants being planned and built all around the country. The additional petroleum and coal imports are causing a disruption in the GDP by as much as 2% annually. The new purchases are affecting improvement initiatives in other sectors causing reduced export earnings and curtailing employment opportunities. This massive failure in the energy sector is mostly attributed to prolonged negligence, inappropriate implementation, inefficiency and lack of planning. To make matters worse, natural gas reserves are expected to expire by 2020. The only coal mine of the country is in the development stage, the reserve of which is also expected to dry up anywhere from 75 to 80 years after the start of their operations. Efforts to develop an open-pit coal mine in Phulbari, Dinajpur District, have met with large, violent protests in 2006 because of feared environmental effects, and six people were killed and hundreds injured.Randeep Ramesh, \\"Six killed in protests over UK mining firm in Bangladesh\\", The Guardian, 29 August 2006, accessed 25 March 2013 At the time, the government closed the project, for which it was working with Asia Energy (now Global Coal Resources). It was encouraged in December 2009 to re-open it by the United States ambassador in private communication.\\"WikiLeaks cables: US pushed for reopening of Bangladesh coal mine\\", The Guardian, 21 December 2010 In October 2010 protesters make a week-long march from Phulbari to Dhaka against the mine; a coalition of other groups protested at a Global Coal Resources meeting in London.\\"Massive protest in London\\" , BanglaNews24, 10 December 2010, accessed 25 March 2013 Renewable energy According to the Bangladesh's Power Sector Master Plan 2016 (PSMP‚Äì2016), the country has the potential to generate a combined 3.6 GW of electricity from renewable energy sources. Another research has estimated that the potential from wind power alone stands at 20 GW. Bangladesh has 15 MW solar energy capacity through rural households and 1.9 MW wind power in Kutubdia and Feni. The government of Bangladesh has approved the construction by private developers of 19 on-grid solar parks, with would have cumulative generation capacity of 1070 MW.A solar power plant having a power generation capacity of 28 MW has recently started its operation in Teknaf of Cox's Bazar. Accounting this, the power generation capacity from renewable energy sources exceeds five percent of the country's total demand. Technical Solartech Energy Ltd (TSEL) has installed this power plant in Teknaf utilizing a total of 116 acres of land. Currently, the power plant is feeding 20MW to the national grid.http://energybangla.com/largest-solar-power-plant- starts-operation-in-teknaf/ Bangladesh has planned to produce 10% of total power generation by 2020 from renewable energy sources like wind, waste, and solar energy. The country plans to increase its renewable energy share to 17% by 2041 under its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5% until 2030. The country's prospect of geothermal energy extraction has also been discussed by researchers.Md. A.

Recent plans The Ministry of Power and Energy has been mobilising BDT 400 billion ($5.88 billion) to generate 5,000 MW of electricity to reduce load shedding into a tolerable level within next four and half years during the term of the present government. Under the plan, the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) would produce 500 MW gas-fired electricity between July and December 2009 to over come load shedding within December. The PDB would hire furnace- oil based 1,000 MW of electricity from private sector from January to June 2010, the plan said. In 2011, the government would install furnace-oil based 800 MW capacity of power plant. The PDB officials would seek suitable place to establish the plant, a senior official of the PDB said. Besides the government would also hire another diesel- or furnace oil-based power plant having capacity of 700 MW in 2012 to keep load shedding into mild level, the official said. However, the government also contemplates to establish four coal-fired- based power plants with capacity of producing 500 MW of electricity each with public and private partnership (PPP) in Rajshahi and Chittagong region. The government has initially tried to create fund of BDT 60 billion ($1 billion) to implement the plan, sources said. The power division has tried to use the government's budgetary allocation of BDT 20 billion for PPP in this regard, sources added. \\"If we can create the fund of BDT 60 billion, it would be possible also to mobilise BDT 400 billion under ppp to produce 5,000 MW of electricity within four and half years,\\" PDB chairman ASM Alamgir Kabir told the New Nation on 29 June 2009. During the meeting, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina permitted the power division to implement the PDB plan to reduce load shedding up to a tolerable level. Prime Minister's Adviser for Power and Energy Dr. Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury Bir Bikram, State Minister for Power and Energy Shamsul Haque Tuku, Power Division Secretary Md Abul Kalam, PDB chairman ASM Alamgir Kabir were present. Inefficiencies and infrastructure Bangladesh has small reserves of oil and coal, but very large natural gas resources. Commercial energy consumption comes mostly from natural gas (around 66%), followed by oil, hydropower, and coal. Non-commercial energy sources, such as wood fuel, and crop residues, are estimated to account for over half of the country's energy consumption. A 2014 news report stated that: > Bangladesh is considered one of the most arousing energy growth nations. > More than a third of Bangladesh's 166 million people still have no access to > electricity, while the country often is able to produce only some of its > 11,500-megawatt generation capacity. In generating and distributing electricity, the failure to adequately manage the load leads to extensive load shedding which results in severe disruption in the industrial production and other economic activities. A recent survey reveals that power outages result in a loss of industrial output worth $1 billion a year which reduces the GDP growth by about half a percentage point in Bangladesh. A major hurdle in efficiently delivering power is caused by the inefficient distribution system. It is estimated that the total transmission and distribution losses in Bangladesh amount to one-third of the total generation, the value of which is equal to US$247 million per year. In 2011, there were proposals to upgrade the grid technologies to digital smart metering systems and investing in renewable energy technologies to produce 5% of total power generation by 2015 & 10% by 2020, as noted in the National Renewable Energy Policy of 2008. American engineer Sanwar Sunny said that the city should put more effort in zoning areas to encourage more self-reliant subdivisions and higher density housing around subways to be more sustainable, as during peak times load shedding would not affect everyone. It will reduce effects of power cuts and provide stability to the power sector. He proposed that Radio transmitters could be operating remotely in unlicensed radio bands using two way real time communication and transmit coded instructions from the central to the circuit breakers in selected coordinates of the micro grids substations thereby maintain multiple power flow lines with automated control and digital metering. Using this technology, Feed-in tariffs (FIT) would also be possible, as the energy usage could be monitored remotely and private power generation and energy efficient entities could be offered rebates and incentives. \\"This will also expedite investments in this sector, create job opportunities for engineering graduates and technicians, and ease pressures on the government\\" he said. Think tanks such as Bangladesh Solar Energy Society and Renewable Energy Institute (REI), along with European International Development Government Agencies such as Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit supported this scheme. However, The Secretary of the Ministry of Power, Government of Bangladesh has said that the government has no plans to do so. Nuclear power plant Bangladesh plans to set up the 2,400 MW power plant, the Ruppur Nuclear Power Plant at Rooppur, Pabna district, northwest of the capital Dhaka, by 2018. Planned to go into operation by 2023, it will be the country's first nuclear power plant. The plant will be built with an allocation of BDT 20,050 crore, the highest allocation for a single project and over half of the 2018-2019 budget.

Its Sanskrit equivalent is \\"Mithya me duskrtam\\" and both literally mean \\"may all the evil that has been done be in vain\\". It is used widely in Jainism for the Pratikramana ritual on the last day of Paryushana called Samvatsari in the Svetambara tradition, and Kshamavani in the Digambara tradition. The phrase is alternatively interpreted and said to mean, \\"May all my improper actions be inconsequential\\" or \\"I ask pardon of all living beings, may all of them pardon me, may I have friendship with all beings and enmity with none\\". As a matter of ritual, Jains greet their friends and relatives on this last day with MicchƒÅmi Dukka·∏ça·πÉ, seeking their forgiveness. The phrase is also used in Jain monastic practice on a more periodic basis as a part of a monk's or nun's confessional and repentance mantra during the pratikramana (fourth avasyakas) ritual, particularly when they are venerating images or murti of Tirthankaras in Jain temples. Etymology The phrase miccha me dukkadam, is an ancient Prakrit language phrase that is commonly found in Jain texts. The Sanskrit version is mithyƒÅ me du·π£k·πõitƒÅm. It is related to a section of Jaina monastic code of conduct called the avasyakas (Prakrit: osayas, obligatory observations or duties). It means \\"may the evil of it be in vain\\". In the phrase, mithyƒÅ refers to 'being fruitless', me means 'my', du·π£k·πõitƒÅm refers to 'bad deeds'. The Jain scholar Hemachandra gave it a symbolic etymological basis in his Yogasastra verse 3.124, as the following: *mi is \\"miu maddava\\", connoting \\"gentleness\\" *cha is \\"dosanam chayana\\", connoting \\"the veiling of faults\\" *mi, me is \\"a-merae thiya\\", connoting \\"abiding in the limitless\\" *du is \\"duganchami appanam\\", connoting \\"I loath myself\\" *ka is \\"kadam me pavam\\", connoting \\"I have committed sin\\" *dam is \\"devemi tam uvasamenam\\", connoting \\"I go beyond it through attaining to calm\\" The phrase \\"tassa micchami dukkadam\\" has been interpreted in a number of ways, or implied to mean more, from literal to symbolic. Examples include: *\\"May that fault have been done in vain [have no effect]\\" *\\"May all my improper actions be inconsequential\\" *\\"My fault has been due to error\\" *\\"May all my transgressions be forgiven\\" *\\"I ask pardon of all living beings, may all of them pardon me, may I have friendship with all beings and enmity with none.\\"  Literature  The phrase michchƒÅmi dukka·∏ça·πÉ is found in the Airyapathiki Sutra, verses 3.124 and 3.130 of the Yoga sastra. The verse is a part of the airyapathiki-pratikramana ritual and prelude to the caitya-vandana (worship in a temple). It contains and ends with micchami dukkadam: Its Sanskrit equivalent is \\"Mithya me duskrtam\\". Equivalent forms of confession and repentance are found in early Buddhist dhamma and Hindu dharma texts. For example, numerous verses of chapter 11 of the Manusmriti are dedicated to confession, repentance and penance. These include those related to willful and unintentional misdeeds, such as those related to injury or killing of other life forms, harming vegetation or forests, consuming forbidden foods or liquids (meat, liquor to Brahmins and monks), theft, and many others. The word dushkrtam in karmic context specially appears in verses 11.228‚Äì232. These, translates Patrick Olivelle ‚Äì a scholar of ancient Sanskrit literature, encourage the person to \\"declare his misdeed publicly, be contrite\\", \\"acknowledge the infraction\\" before others, sincerely \\"abhor the evil deed\\", understand the consequences any misdeeds have \\"on his afterlife\\", resolve \\"I will never do that again\\", and then \\"pursue wholesome activity with his thoughts, speech and body\\", according to Manusmriti. Practice MicchƒÅmi dukka·∏ça·πÉ is popularly used on the last day of the annual Jain observations called the Paryushana by Svetambara Jains and Dasa-Laksana-Parvan by Digambara Jains. It is held on evenings during the caturmasa (monsoonal months), usually before one's guru (spiritual counsellor) or temple before an image of a Tirthankara. It is particularly popular as a community ceremony on Samvatsari in the Svetambara tradition, and Kshamavani in the Digambara tradition. After pratikramana ‚Äì confession of and repentance for one's mistakes and violations of Jain code of life for laypeople, a Jain seeks forgiveness from all life forms of the world whom they may have harmed knowingly or unknowingly by uttering the phrase ‚Äî micchƒÅmi dukka·∏ça·πÉ. In the contemporary era, on Paryushana Samvatsari, Jains reach out to their friends and relatives in person, telephone or mail with \\"micchami dukkadam\\". Paryushana frequently falls in August or September. This annual observation during rainy season for the Jain laypeople is not found in early Jain texts, and appears in post-14th century texts such as the Sraddha viddhi. The early texts of the Svetambara and Digambara traditions include it as a routine, around the year practice for monks and nuns as a part of their avasyakas ritual. It is particularly included when they are venerating images or murti of Tirthankaras in Jain temples. All pratikramana mantras in Jain monastic practice end with micchami dukkadam, wherein the mendicant sets up a category of infractions and errors and then adds \\"may the evil of it be in vain\\".

Insight- oriented psychotherapy can be an intensive process, wherein the client must spend multiple days per week with the therapist. Overview Forms of insight-oriented psychotherapy include psychoanalysis and Gestalt therapy. Insight oriented psychotherapy places a large emphasis on personal discovery for the patient. Through dedication to trust filled conversations, the patient will go through a process of enlightenment with the therapist. The patient will begin to understand significant life events of theirs as triggers or agents of change for how they live their lives today. History The oldest form of insight-oriented psychotherapy was developed by Freud and is known as psychoanalysis. Psychedelic therapy Some evidence suggests that the process of insight-oriented psychotherapy can be improved by the use of drugs, which can be described as psychedelic drugs (meaning \\"mind- manifesting\\").Grinspoon, L., & Doblin, R. (2001). Psychedelics as catalysts of insight-oriented psychotherapy. Social Research, 68(3), 677-695. Psychedelic substances, such as the amphetamine MDMA, can be used in psychotherapy to reinforce and enhance the relationship between the healthcare professional and his or her client (or patient). Such substances can be used to better manage abreaction and catharsis and improve the quality of understanding between the healthcare professional and patient. Numerous clinical papers on the effectiveness of psychedelics in insight-oriented drug therapy have been published.Abramson, H. A., ed. (1967). The Use of LSD in Psychotherapy and Alcoholism.DeBold, R. C., and Russell C. Leaf, eds. (1967). LSD, Man, and Society. These psychedelics were used to treat a wide variety of psychological issues, including \\"alcoholism, obsessional neurosis, and sociopathy\\".Shagass, C., and R. M. Bittle. (1967) Therapeutic Effects of LSD: A Follow-up Study. Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease 144: 471-78Savage, C., D.Jackson, and J. Terrill.(1962) LSD, Transcendence, and the New Beginning. Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease 135: 425-39 Furthermore, it was found that psychedelics were effective in easing the process of dying patients.Grof, S., et al. (1973) LSD-assisted Psychotherapy in Patients with Terminal Cancer. International Pharmacopsychiatry 8: 129-41 A major reason for the clinical interest in psychedelic drugs for psychoanalysis was the belief of some experimental subjects that the experience of using psychedelic medication reduced their feelings of guilt and made them less depressed and anxious and more self- accepting, tolerant, and alert. Eliciting the release of these feelings through ego death can make the transition to acceptance of the patient's situation much easier, thus causing the seeming acceptance or healing that comes with a combination of intensive sessions and varying psychedelics (based on their condition). This sense of comfort and release of confounding factors have been found to cause nominal increases in patients' ability to rationally handle their situations. Effectiveness The length of treatment depends on the needs and circumstances of the patient. A time limit may be set to work towards achieving one goal or if more sessions are needed, community therapist may be advised. It can be effective for: mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance abuse disorders, eating disorders, sexual dysfunctions, adjustment disorders, personality disorders and relational, family or academic problems. However, the popular treatment methods used can also generate placebo insights within clients. Because patients may face a lot of in the therapeutic encounter, they may experience \\"insights\\" such as illusions, deception, or adaptive self-misunderstandings‚Äîand it can also generate therapeutic artefacts that seem to confirm these insights. Role of Therapist The two main roles for the therapist are to stay neutral and abstinent towards their patients. Patients who are engaging with Insight-oriented psychotherapy attempt to build a trust-infused rapport with the therapist. It is believed that patients will be able to speak freely without feeling judgement if they understand that their therapist is not reacting, either positively or negatively towards what the patient is saying. In this way, the therapist is keeping a neutral disposition towards the patient. Issues Different treatment options based on other assumptions about certain ameliorative factors in psychotherapy have been affected by this trend towards shorter treatment procedures. Insight- oriented therapies have generally consisted of treatment approaches that share the premise that behavior is disturbed in some manner through a lack of client awareness. These approaches to treatment include client-centered psychotherapy which focuses upon special conditions in the therapeutic relationship; existential psychotherapy with its focus upon anxiety of death, as well as philosophical questions regarding the meaning of life; and, the revamp of an interpersonal psychotherapy strategy stemming from its original Sullivanian conception. Many problems have emerged in clinical treatment settings, in large part due to time limitations, as well as the restricted, minimal focus placed upon each of the above types of treatment. Insight-oriented psychotherapy is also used often and in conjunction with medication for treating depression. However, it is less suited for the afflicted individual who is especially emotional/sensitive, has little self-awareness, and is dealing with a major life problem. Example Case Studies of Insight-Oriented Psychotherapy In one example of insight-oriented psychotherapy, a nearly middle aged woman was having difficulty with her cancer treatment. The treatments themselves were not the issue. The issue was that this cancer patient was confusing her past, tumultuous relationships with her current ones. Specifically speaking, with the doctors who were supposed to be treating her. \\"Associations to the follow-up pelvic exams and second-look surgery (which was negative) reminded her of her father's violation and denigration of women. She felt as though she was subjecting herself to yet another uncaring man who was out to hurt and humiliate a woman.\\" It was ultimately these realizations that the patient came to in her insight-oriented sessions that allowed her to continue her cancer treatment.

It was first published in the November, 1946 issue of Dime Mystery. It was collected in Bradbury's anthology Dark Carnival and later collected in the anthologies The October Country, The Autumn People, The Small Assassin, The Stories of Ray Bradbury and The Vintage Bradbury. Plot David and Alice Leiber are a happily married couple living in Los Angeles, but when Alice gives birth to a healthy baby boy, she fears the baby is somehow abnormal and will kill her. She expresses her fears to her husband, who dismisses them and tries to comfort her. Their family doctor, Dr. Jeffers, explains that it is not unusual for some women to experience such feelings after the birth of a child‚Äîespecially in Alice's case, as she almost died of complications of a Caesarean section during delivery. David leaves for a business trip in Chicago and is gone for a few days. On his sixth day away he receives an emergency phone call from Dr. Jeffers, telling him Alice is seriously ill with pneumonia; David rushes home, and a frightened Alice tells him, \\"It was the baby again.\\" She claims she got pneumonia because the baby cried all night to keep her from sleeping; she believes he is deliberately trying to weaken and kill her. One night David hears the baby crying and gets up to fetch milk from the kitchen. At the top of the stairs he slips on a soft object, but he manages to catch the railing and does not fall downstairs. He finds a large patchwork doll at the top of the stairs, an object he had bought for the baby as a joke. Neither he nor Alice had placed it there. He begins to wonder whether Alice is right about their child. When David comes home from work the next day he finds Alice dead, sprawled and broken at the bottom of the stairs. The patchwork doll lies beside her. Horrified, David tells Dr. Jeffers about his suspicions, believing that the child was born with the awareness and intelligence of an adult but with the inherent selfishness of a baby; the child hates the mother for removing him from the womb (where all his needs were attended to) and hates his father as a co-conspirator. However, the doctor does not believe him; instead, Dr. Jeffers prescribes sleeping pills for David, thinking a good 24-hour rest will curb the man's grief-fueled hysteria. Early the next morning Dr. Jeffers drives up to the Leiber house. Knocking and getting no response, he goes inside. Immediately he smells the odor of gas in the house of Leiber. He rushes to David's room only to find David dead on the bed, and gas leaking from an open jet at the bottom of the wall near the door. The doctor considers whether David might have turned on the gas himself, but then reasons that he couldn't have done so; he would have been knocked out by the sleeping pills. It couldn't have been suicide. He goes to the nursery only to find the door closed and the crib empty. Somehow, he reasons, the child must have crawled out of his crib and opened the gas jet, but then the door closed, trapping him outside the nursery. For this reason, Dr. Jeffers realizes David's suspicions were correct - the baby, named Lucifer by David, truly is a murderer. Dr. Jeffers decides that since he was responsible for bringing the child into the world, it must be his responsibility to take the child out of it. Moving carefully through the house, he draws an item from his medical supplies and calls out to the baby, offering to show him \\"something shiny.\\" The item is revealed to be a scalpel.

It is funded by Government of Australia as a mean to produce and maintain educational tools and resources for families raising children in Australia. History The Raising Children website, which was launched in May 2006, has become the most trusted resource for parenting information in Australia, according to industry sources. It is a comprehensive and quality assured website covering all core information required for raising children from birth to eight years. Each article on the Raising Children website is reviewed by two independent experts, drawn from a panel of over 100 subject matter experts ‚Äî effective peer review. In the first three years of operation the website registered over 10 million page views. As a companion to the Raising Children website and to extend its reach, the Raising Children DVD was produced in 2007. In November 2007, Australia became the first country in the world to initiate a universal parenting education program when it started distributing the companion Raising Children DVD to every family in the country, at the birth of their child in the hospital. Over 250,000 are distributed each year. The Raising Children DVD contains five hours of content ‚Äî divided into three short movies, Newborn, Baby and Child and a section called ‚ÄòWhat About Me?‚Äô It takes advantage of basic DVD technology to provide users with a fully interactive experience which enables them to opt into extended content topics and demonstration clips while watching the main movies. Its effectiveness, according to the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) independent evaluation, is due to a combination of factors including: the high quality of production, the primary use of documentary style parent interviews, a comedic host and the inclusion of visual demonstrations of key skills, like breastfeeding and safe bathing. In 2007 the Raising Children website and DVD swept the relevant interactive media awards in Australia. The Raising Children DVD won the Australian Interactive Media Industry Association (AIMIA) award for the Best Learning & Education category. The expert judges commented that the DVD is, > in essence an interactive documentary for parents & carers, allowing them to > explore and engage with information about parenting that enables the active > construction of knowledge. The Raising Children website won the AIMIA award for the Best Non-profit & Government category with judges commending the site‚Äôs innovative features: > The pop-up glossary terms are a fantastic solution to get information > quickly and effectively to the user without sending them to a whole > different page, and Make a Book is an invaluable function for tired parents > to be able to refer back to without logging on.

Phosphorus refers here to salts of phosphates (PO43‚àí), monohydrogen phosphate (HPO42‚àí), and dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4‚àí). These anions readily interconvert, and the predominant species is determined by the pH of the solution or soil. Phosphates are required for the biosynthesis of genetic material as well as ATP, essential for life. Phosphorus deficiency can be controlled by applying sources of phosphorus such as bone meal, rock phosphate, manure, and phosphate- fertilizers.Heinrich W. Scherer \\"Fertilizers\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Symptoms  In plants, phosphorus (P) is considered second to nitrogen as the most essential nutrient to ensure health and function. Phosphorus is used by plants in numerous processes such as photophosphorylation, genetic transfer, the transportation of nutrients, and phospholipid cell membranes.International Plant Nutrition Institute. (1999). Functions of phosphorus in plants. Better crops with plant food, 83(1), 6-7. Within a plant cell these functions are imperative for function, in photophosphorylation for example the creation of stored energy in plants is a result of a chemical reaction including phosphorus. Phosphorus is a key molecular component of genetic reproduction. When phosphorus is present in inadequate levels, genetic processes such as cell division and plant growth are impaired. Hence, phosphorus deficient plants may mature at a slower rate than plants with adequate amounts of phosphorus. The stunted growth induced by phosphorus deficiency has been correlated with smaller leaf sizes and a lessened number of leaves.Zambrosi, F. C. B., Ribeiro, R. V., Marchiori, P. E. R., Cantarella, H., & Landell, M. G. A. (2014). Sugarcane performance under phosphorus deficiency: physiological responses and genotypic variation. Plant and Soil, 386(1), 273‚Äì283. Phosphorus deficiency may also create an imbalance in the storage of carbohydrates. Photosynthesis, the main function of plant cells that produces energy from sunlight and water, usually remains at a normal rate under a phosphorus-deficient state. However phosphorus usage in functions within the cell usually slow. This imbalance of rates in phosphorus deficient plants leads to the buildup of excess carbohydrate within the plant. This carbohydrate buildup often can be observed by the darkening of leaves. In some plants the leaf pigment change as a result of this process can turn leaves a dark purplish color. Detection Detecting phosphorus deficiency can take multiple forms. A preliminary detection method is a visual inspection of plants. Darker green leaves and purplish or red pigment can indicate a deficiency in phosphorus. This method however can be an unclear diagnosis because other plant environment factors can result in similar discoloration symptoms. In commercial or well monitored settings for plants, phosphorus deficiency is diagnosed by scientific testing. Additionally, discoloration in plant leaves only occurs under fairly severe phosphorus deficiency so it is beneficial to planters and farmers to scientifically check phosphorus levels before discoloration occurs. The most prominent method of checking phosphorus levels is by soil testing. The major soil testing methods are Bray 1-P, Mehlich 3, and Olsen methods. Each of these methods are viable but each method has tendencies to be more accurate in known geographical areas.Sawyer, J.E. (2008). Differentiating and Understanding the Mehlich 3, Bray, and Olsen Soil Phosphorus Tests. Retrieved from: http://www.agronext.iastate.edu/soilfertility/presentations/mbotest.pdf These tests use chemical solutions to extract phosphorus from the soil. The extract must then be analyzed to determine the concentration of the phosphorus. Colorimetry is used to determine this concentration. With the addition of the phosphorus extract into a colorimeter, there is visual color change of the solution and the degree to this color change is an indicator of phosphorus concentration. To apply this testing method on phosphorus deficiency, the measured phosphorus concentration must be compared to known values. Most plants have established and thoroughly tested optimal soil conditions. If the concentration of phosphorus measured from the colorimeter test is significantly lower than the plant's optimal soil levels, then it is likely the plant is phosphorus deficient.Department of Soil Science, University of Wisconsin-Madison. (2004). Available phosphorus. Wisconsin Procedures for Soil Testing, Plant Analysis and Feed and Forage Analysis. Retrieved from: http://datcp.wi.gov/uploads/Farms/pdf/WIProcSoilTestingAnaysis.pdf. The soil testing with colorimetric analysis, while widely used, can be subject to diagnostic problems as a result of interference from other present compounds and elements.Kowalenko, C.G & Babuin, D. (2007). Interference problems with phosphoantimonymolybdendum colorimetric measurement of phosphorus in soil and plant materials. Communications in soil science and plant analysis, 38(9-10), 1299-1316. Additional phosphorus detection methods such as spectral radiance and inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP) are also implemented with the goal of improving reading accuracy. According to the World Congress of Soil Scientists, the advantages of these light-based measurement methods are their quickness of evaluation, simultaneous measurements of plant nutrients, and their non-destructive testing nature. Although these methods have experimental based evidence, unanimous approval of the methods has not yet been achieved.Angelova, V., Bekjarov, G., Dospatliev, L., Ivanov, & K., Zaprjanova, P. (2010). ICP determination of phosphorus in soils and plants. Retrieved from: http://iuss.org/19th%20WCSS/Symposium/pdf/1629.pdfOsborne, S. L., Schepers, J. S., Francis, D. D., & Schlemmer, M. R. (2002). Detection of Phosphorus and Nitrogen Deficiencies in Corn Using Spectral Radiance Measurements. Agronomy Journal,94(6), 1215‚Äì1221. Treatment Correction and prevention of phosphorus deficiency typically involves increasing the levels of available phosphorus into the soil. Planters introduce more phosphorus into the soil with bone meal, rock phosphate, manure, and phosphate-fertilizers. The introduction of these compounds into the soil however does not ensure the alleviation of phosphorus deficiency. There must be phosphorus in the soil, but the phosphorus must also be absorbed by the plant. The uptake of phosphorus is limited by the chemical form in which the phosphorus is available in the soil. A large percentage of phosphorus in soil is present in chemical compounds that plants are incapable of absorbing.Beegle, D. & Durst, P.T. (2002). Managing phosphorus for crop production. Retrieved from: http://extension.psu.edu/plants/nutrient-management/educational/soil- fertility/managing-phosphorus-for-crop-production/extension_publication_file Phosphorus must be present in soil in specific chemical arrangements to be usable as plant nutrients. Facilitation of usable phosphorus in soil can be optimized by maintaining soil within a specified pH range. Soil acidity, measured on the pH scale, partially dictates what chemical arrangements that phosphorus forms. Between pH 6 and 7, phosphorus makes the fewest bonds which render the nutrient unusable to plants. At this range of acidity the likeliness of phosphorus uptake is increased and the likeliness of phosphorus deficiency is decreased. Another component in the prevention and treatment of phosphorus is the plant's disposition to absorb nutrients. Plant species and different plants within in the same species react differently to low levels of phosphorus in soil. Greater expansion of root systems generally correlate to greater nutrient uptake. Plants within a species that have larger roots are genetically advantaged and less prone to phosphorus deficiency. These plants can be cultivated and bred as a long term phosphorus deficiency prevention method. In conjunction to root size, other genetic root adaptations to low phosphorus conditions such as mycorrhizal symbioses have been found to increase nutrient intake.Maathuis, F. J. (2009). Physiological functions of mineral macronutrients. Current Opinion in Plant Biology, 250‚Äì258. These biological adaptations to roots work to maintain the levels of vital nutrients. In larger commercial agriculture settings, variation of plants to adopt these desirable phosphorus intake adaptations may be a long-term phosphorus deficiency correction method.

It rises near Stevens Pass in the Cascade Mountains and flows west, joining the Foss River to form the South Fork Skykomish River. Its waters eventually empty into Puget Sound near Everett via the Skykomish River and Snohomish River. U.S. Route 2 follows the river's entire length. A BNSF Railway line follows most of the river except near the pass where the tracks use the Cascade Tunnel. Powerlines run by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) follow the Tye River west of Tunnel Creek. Most of the Tye River drainage basin is within Mount Baker- Snoqualmie National Forest. The Tye River is considered the continuation of the South Fork Skykomish River above the Foss River confluence. However, the true source of the South Fork Skykomish, in terms of streamflow is not the Tye River but the Rapid River, a tributary of the Beckler River, which in turn is a tributary of the South Fork Skykomish. The Tye River is named for W.H. Tye (or William Francis Tye), a surveyor for the Great Northern Railway who laid out the rail grade to Stevens Pass.Tacoma Public Library , Washington Place NamesTYE, William Francis, Biographical Dictionary of Canadian Engineers Course The Tye River originates on the west side of the crest of the North Cascades on Cowboy Mountain at Stevens Pass. It flows west, then southwest, collecting numerous small tributary streams. At upstream from the Tye's mouth, near the Cascade Tunnel's western portal, Tunnel Creek joins the river. U.S. Route 2 makes a hairpin turn in the valley of Tunnel Creek. The Tye River then turns more directly west. It collects Surprise Creek and its tributary Scenic Creek near Scenic. Deception Creek joins near Deception Falls, above the mouth of the Tye. Scenic, Surprise, and Deception creeks all join from the south. Below Deception Creek the Tye River is joined by Martin Creek from the north. Then, upstream from its mouth, the Tye falls over Alpine Falls. Below the waterfall the Tye River is joined by Carroll Creek and Alpine Creek from the south. The BPA powerline crosses the Tye River above the river's mouth. A couple miles east of Skykomish the Foss River, flowing from the south, joins the Tye River, forming the South Fork Skykomish River.General course info from USGS topographic maps accessed via the \\"GNIS in Google Map\\" feature of the USGS Geographic Names Information System website. History The Great Northern Railway built the train tracks today owned by BNSF. The railroad tracks originally followed the Tye River to Stevens Pass, which it crossed via a number of switchbacks. The first Cascade Tunnel was built at Wellington, just west of the pass. After the Wellington avalanche disaster of 1910 the Great Northern changed the town's name from Wellington, which had become associated with the disaster, to Tye, after the river. The town was abandoned after the second Cascade Tunnel was built in 1929. Natural history The upper Tye River flows through a steep, narrow, and densely forested valley. Below Surprise Creek the Tye's valley alternately widens and narrows. There are dense mixed deciduous and conifer forests in the valley bottoms and thick conifer forests on the valley sides. Much of the lower elevation forests have been logged at least once. Old growth forests are founded mainly along the higher tributaries. Above Deception Creek the Tye River has a steep gradient and a confined channel, resulting in a nearly continuous series of steep cascades and smalls waterfalls. Downstream, near its mouth, the Tye's gradient lessens and its channel widens. The valley becomes more broad and flat. The river becomes somewhat braided in this stretch, with numerous channel splits. There are many logs and other types of large woody debris in this part of the river, contributing to excellent salmon habitat. The final mile of the Tye has a steeper gradient with cascades alternating with deep pools. Nearly all the Tye River's tributaries are high mountains streams with steep gradients. Some entering the Tye's valley from hanging valleys, plunging down high waterfalls. The Tye River is used by chinook and coho salmon. Adults migrate upstream as far as Alpine Falls. Spawning occurs mostly in the mainstem river. Some coho spawn in the lower parts of a few tributary streams such as Alpine Creek. Juvenile salmon rear throughout the accessible waters of the river basin. No anadromous fish are found above Alpine Falls as it is a total barrier to fish migration. Sunset Falls on the South Fork Skykomish River, below the mouth of the Tye River, is also a total barrier to fish migration. All anadrmous fish above Sunset Falls, which includes the entire Tye River basin, are present only as a result of a trap and haul operation initiated in 1958 by the Washington Department of Fisheries. Between July and December fish are trapped below the falls, trucked above, and returned to the South Fork Skykomish. About of roads have been built in the Tye River basin, resulting in a road density approaching and in places surpassing the threshold where damage to the watershed may occur through road effects on slope hydrology and mass wasting. The Martin Creek and Beckler Peak roads present the greatest hazard to streams. Winter sanding of U.S. Highway 2 is a chronic contributor of fine sediment to the Tye River. Each year 2,500- 7,000 cubic yards of sand are applied to the highway. It is not known how much enters the Tye River. If just 1% does the result is equivalent to a small landslide each year. Increased sediment is a concern because it damages salmon spawning habitat. Tributaries Tributaries of the Tye River are listed below, from mouth to source.

They are very highly inflected languages. Polysynthetic languages typically have long \\"sentence-words\\" such as the Yupik word ' which means \\"He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer.\\" The word consists of the morphemes ' with the meanings, reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again- third person-singular-indicative; and except for the morpheme ' \\"reindeer\\", none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation. Whereas isolating languages have a low morpheme-to-word ratio, polysynthetic languages have a very high ratio. There is no generally agreed upon definition of polysynthesis. Generally polysynthetic languages have polypersonal agreement although some agglutinative languages that are not polysynthetic also have it, such as Basque, Hungarian and Georgian. Some authors apply the term polysynthetic to languages with high morpheme-to-word ratios, but others use it for languages that are highly head-marking, or those that frequently use noun incorporation. Polysynthetic languages can be agglutinative or fusional depending on whether they encode one or multiple grammatical categories per affix. At the same time, the question of whether to call a particular language polysynthetic is complicated by the fact that morpheme and word boundaries are not always clear cut, and languages may be highly synthetic in one area but less synthetic in other areas (e.g., verbs and nouns in Southern Athabaskan languages or Inuit languages). Many polysynthetic languages display complex evidentiality and/or mirativity systems in their verbs. The term was invented by Peter Stephen Du Ponceau, who considered polysynthesis, as characterized by sentence words and noun incorporation, a defining feature of all indigenous languages of the Americas. This characterization was shown to be wrong, since many indigenous American languages are not polysynthetic, but it is a fact that polysynthetic languages are not evenly distributed throughout the world, but more frequent in the Americas, Australia, Siberia, and New Guinea; however, there are also examples in other areas. The concept became part of linguistic typology with the work of Edward Sapir, who used it as one of his basic typological categories. Recently, Mark C. Baker has suggested formally defining polysynthesis as a macro-parameter within Noam Chomsky's principles and parameters theory of grammar. Other linguists question the basic utility of the concept for typology since it covers many separate morphological types that have little else in common. Meaning The word \\"polysynthesis\\" is composed of the Greek roots poly meaning \\"many\\" and synthesis meaning \\"placing together\\". In linguistics a word is defined as a unit of meaning that can stand alone in a sentence, and which can be uttered in isolation. Words may be simple, consisting of a single unit of meaning, or they can be complex, formed by combining many small units of meaning, called morphemes. In a general non- theoretical sense polysynthetic languages are those languages that have a high degree of morphological synthesis, and which tend to form long complex words containing long strings of morphemes, including derivational and inflectional morphemes. A language then is \\"synthetic\\" or \\"synthesizing\\" if it tends to have more than one morpheme per word, and a polysynthetic language is a language that has \\"many\\" morphemes per word. The concept was originally used only to describe those languages that can form long words that correspond to an entire sentence in English or other Indo-European languages, and the word is still most frequently used to refer to such \\"sentence words\\". Often polysynthesis is achieved when languages have extensive agreement between elements verbs and their arguments so that the verb is marked for agreement with the grammatical subject and object. In this way a single word can encode information about all the elements in a transitive clause. In Indo-European languages the verb is usually only marked for agreement with the subject (e.g. Spanish ' \\"I speak\\" where the -o ending marks agreement with the first person singular subject), but in many languages verbs also agree with the object (e.g. the Kiswahili word ' \\"I love you\\" where the ' prefix marks agreement with the first person singular subject and the ' prefix marks agreement with a second person singular object). Many polysynthetic languages combine these two strategies, and also have ways of inflecting verbs for concepts normally encoded by adverbs or adjectives in Indo-European languages. In this way highly complex words can be formed, for example the Yupik word ' which means \\"He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer.\\" The word consists of the morphemes ' with the meanings, reindeer-hunt-future-say- negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative, and except for the morpheme ' \\"reindeer\\", none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation. Another way to achieve a high degree of synthesis is when languages can form compound words by incorporation of nouns, so that entire words can be incorporated into the verb word, as baby is incorporated in the English verb babysit. Another common feature of polysynthetic languages is a tendency to use head marking as a means of syntactic cohesion. This means that many polysynthetic languages mark grammatical relations between verbs and their constituents by indexing the constituents on the verb with agreement morphemes, and the relation between noun phrases and their constituents by marking the head noun with agreement morphemes. There are some dependent-marking languages that may be considered to be polysynthetic because they use case stacking to achieve similar effects, and very long words. =Examples= An example from Chukchi, a polysynthetic, incorporating, and agglutinating language of Russia which also has grammatical cases unlike the majority of incorporating polysynthetic languages: :. :t-…ô-mey≈ã-…ô-levt-p…ôŒ≥t-…ô-rk…ôn :1.SG.SUBJ-great-head-hurt-PRES.1 :'I have a fierce headache.' From Classical Ainu of Japan, another polysynthetic, incorporating, and agglutinating language: : . :Usaopuspe aeyaykotuymasiramsuypa :usa-opuspe a-e-yay-ko-tuyma-si-ram-suy-pa :various- rumors 1SG-APL-REFL-APL-far-REFL-heart-sway-ITER :'I wonder about various rumors.' (lit. 'I keep swaying my heart afar and toward myself over various rumors'.) The Mexican language Nahuatl is also considered to be polysynthetic, incorporating and agglutinating. The following verb shows how the verb is marked for subject, patient, object, and indirect object: :'''' :' :I-you- someone-something-give-CAUSATIVE-FUTURE :\\"I shall make somebody give something to you\\" The Australian language Tiwi is also considered highly polysynthetic: :'''' :Pi-ti-wuliyondji-rrurlimpirr-ani. :3PL-3SG.FEM-dead.wallaby- carry.on.shoulders-PST.HABIT :\\"They would carry the dead wallaby on their shoulders.\\" And the Canadian First Nation language Mohawk: :'''' :sa-honwa- nhoton-kw-a-hse :again-PAST-she/him-opendoor-reversive-un-for(PERF form) :\\"she opened the door for him again\\" An example from Western Greenlandic, an exclusively suffixing polysynthetic language: :'''' :aliikku-sersu-i-llammas- sua-a-nerar-ta-ssa-galuar-paal-li :entertainment-provide-SEMITRANS- one.good.at-COP-say.that-REP-FUT-sure.but-3.PL.SUBJ/3SG.OBJ-but :'However, they will say that he is a great entertainer, but ...' History of the concept=Peter Stephen Du Ponceau on Native American languages= The term \\"polysynthesis\\" was first used by Peter Stephen DuPonceau (a.k.a. Pierre √âtienne Du Ponceau) in 1819 as a term to describe the structural characteristics of American languages: The term was made popular in a posthumously published work by Wilhelm von Humboldt (1836), and it was long considered that all the indigenous languages of the Americas were of the same type. Humboldt considered language structure to be an expression of the psychological stage of evolution of a people, and since Native Americans were considered uncivilized, polysynthesis came to be seen as the lowest stage of grammatical evolution, characterized by a lack of rigorous rules and clear organization known in European languages. Duponceau himself had argued that the complex polysynthetic nature of American languages was a relic of a more civilized past, and that this suggested that the Indians of his time had degenerated from a previous advanced stage. Duponceau's colleague Albert Gallatin contradicted this theory, arguing rather that synthesis was a sign of a lower cultural level, and that while the Greek and Latin languages were somewhat synthetic, Native American languages were much more so ‚Äì and consequently polysynthesis was the hallmark of the lowest level of intellectual evolution. This view was still prevalent when linguist William Dwight Whitney wrote in 1875. He considered polysynthesis to be a general characteristic of American languages, but he did qualify the statement by mentioning that certain languages such as Otomi and the Tupi-Guarani languages had been claimed to be basically analytic. =D. G. Brinton = The ethnologist Daniel Garrison Brinton, the first professor of anthropology in the US, followed Duponceau, Gallatin and Humboldt in seeing polysynthesis, which he distinguished from incorporation, as a defining feature of all the languages of the Americas. He defined polysynthesis in this way: In the 1890s the question of whether polysynthesis could be considered a general characteristic of Native American languages became a hotly contested issue as Brinton debated the question with John Hewitt. Brinton, who had never done fieldwork with any indigenous group continued to defend Humboldt and Duponceau's view of the exceptional nature of American languages against the claim of Hewitt, who was half Tuscarora and had studied the Iroquoian languages, that languages such as the Iroquois had grammatical rules and verbs just like European languages. =Edward Sapir's morphological types= Edward Sapir reacted to the prevailing view in Americanist linguistics which considered the languages of the Americas to belong to a single basic polysynthetic type, arguing instead that American indigenous languages were highly diverse and encompassed all known morphological types. He also built on the work of Leonard Bloomfield who in his 1914 work \\"language\\" dismissed morphological typology, stating specifically that the term polysynthetic had never been clearly defined. In Sapir's 1921 book also titled \\"Language\\", he argued that instead of using the morphological types as a strict classification scheme it made more sense to classify languages as relatively more or less synthetic or analytic, with the isolating and polysynthetic languages in each of the extremes of that spectrum. He also argued that languages were rarely purely of one morphological type, but used different morphological strategies in different parts of the grammar. Sapir introduced a number of other distinctions according to which languages could be morphologically classified, and proposed combining them to form more complex classifications. He proposed classifying languages both by the degree of synthesis, classifying languages as either analytic, synthetic or polysynthetic, and by the technique used to achieve synthesis, classifying languages as agglutinative, fusional, or symbolic. Among the examples of polysynthetic languages he gave was Haida which he considered to use the agglutinative-isolating technique, Yana and Nootka both of which he considered agglutinative, Chinook and Algonkin which he considered fusional. The Siouan languages he considered \\"mildly polysynthetic\\" and agglutinative-fusional. Following Sapir's understanding of Polysynthesis, his student Benjamin Lee Whorf proposed a distinction between oligosynthetic and polysynthetic languages, where the former term was applied to languages with a very small number of morphemes of which all other lexical units are composed. No language has been shown to fit the description of an oligosynthetic language and the concept is not in general use in linguistics. Contemporary approaches=Generative approaches= The sentence structure of polysynthetic languages has been taken as a challenge for linguists working within Noam Chomsky's generative theoretical framework that operates with the assumption that all the world's languages share a set of basic syntactic principles. Non- configurationality and the pronominal argument hypothesis Eloise Jelinek, having worked with Salishan and Athabascan languages, proposed an analysis of polysynthetic languages in which the morphemes that agree with the arguments of the verb are not just considered indexes of the arguments, but in fact constitute the primary expression of the arguments within the sentence. Because this theory posits that the pronominal agreement morphemes are the true syntactic arguments of the sentence, Jelinek's hypothesis was called the pronominal argument hypothesis. If the hypothesis were correct, it would mean that free standing nouns in such languages did not constitute syntactical arguments, but simply adjoined specifiers or adjuncts. This in turn explained why many polysynthetic languages seem to be non-configurational, i.e. they have no strict rules for word order and seemingly violate many of the basic rules for syntactic structures posited within the generative framework. Mark C. Baker's polysynthesis parameter In 1996 Mark C. Baker proposed a definition of polysynthesis as a syntactic macroparameter within Noam Chomsky's \\"principles and parameters\\" program. He defines polysynthetic languages as languages that conform to the syntactic rule that he calls the \\"polysynthesis parameter\\", and that as a result show a special set of morphological and syntactic properties. The polysynthesis parameter states that all phrasal heads must be marked with either agreement morphemes of their direct argument or else incorporate these arguments in that head. This definition of polysynthesis leaves out some languages that are commonly stated as examples of polysynthetic languages (such as Inuktitut), but can be seen as the reason for certain common structural properties in others, such as Mohawk and Nahuatl. Baker's definition, probably because of its heavy dependence on generative theory, has not been accepted as a general definition of polysynthesis. =Johanna Mattissen's affixal and compositional subtypes= Johanna Mattissen suggests that polysynthetic languages can be fundamentally divided into two typological categories, which differ in the way morphemes are organised to form words. She calls the two types for affixal and compositional polysynthesis respectively. Affixal Affixally polysynthetic languages, as the name suggests, are those that use only non-root-bound morphemes to express concepts that in less synthetic languages are expressed by separate words such as adjectives and adverbs. They also use these bound morphemes to make other nouns and verbs from a basic root, which can lead to very complex word forms without non-lexical suffixes. These bound morphemes often relate to body parts, other essential items of the culture of the language's speakers or features of the landscape where the language is spoken. Deictics and other spatial and temporal relations are also very common among these bound morphemes in affixally polysynthetic languages. Affixally polysynthetic languages do not use noun incorporation or verb serialisation, since this violates the rule concerning the number of roots allowable per word. Many make a weak distinction between nouns and verbs, which allows using affixes to translate these parts of speech. Affixally polysynthetic languages may have a word structure that is either * templatic, with a fixed number of slots for different elements, which are fixed in their position and order relative to each other; or * scope ordered, with forms not restricted in complexity and length. The components are fixed in their relative scope and are thus ordered according to the intended meaning. Usually in this case a few components are actually fixed, such as the root in Eskimo‚ÄìAleut languages. Examples of affixally polysynthetic languages include Inuktitut, Cherokee, Athabaskan languages, the Chimakuan languages (Quileute) and the Wakashan languages.Andronis, Mary; Chicago Linguistic Society #38; p. 386. Compositional In compositionally polysynthetic languages, there usually can be more than one free morpheme per word, which gives rise to noun incorporation and verb serialisation to create extremely long words. Bound affixes, though less important in compositionally polysynthetic languages than in affixally polysynthetic languages, tend to be equally abundant in both types. It is believed that all affixally polysynthetic languages evolved from compositionally polysynthetic ones via the conversion of morphemes that could stand on their own into affixes.See Mattissen: \\"On the Ontology and Diachronisis of Polysynthesis\\"; in Wunderlich (editor): Advances in the theory of the lexicon, p. 337 Because they possess a greater number of free morphemes, compositionally polysynthetic languages are much more prone than affixally polysynthetic ones to evolve into simpler languages with less complex words. On the other hand, they are generally easier to distinguish from non-polysynthetic languages than affixally polysynthetic languages. Examples of compositionally polysynthetic languages include Classical Ainu , Sora, Chukchi, Tonkawa, and most Amazonian languages.

For his demagogic rhetoric, popular appeal and anti-establishment (as nobility) sentiment, some sources considered him an earlier populist and proto-fascist figure. Having advocated the abolition of Papal power and the Unification of Italy, Cola re-emerged in the 19th century as a romantic figure among leaders of liberal nationalism and adopted as a precursor of the 19th century Risorgimento. Early career Cola was born in Rome of humble origins. He claimed to be the natural child of Henry VII, the Holy Roman Emperor, but in fact his parents were a washer-woman and a tavern-keeper named Lorenzo Gabrini. His father's forename was shortened to Rienzo, and his own, Nicola, to Cola; hence the Cola di Rienzo, or Rienzi, by which he is generally known. He spent his early years at Anagni. Having devoted much time to the study of the Latin writers, historians, orators and poets, and having nourished his mind with stories of the glories and the power of ancient Rome, he turned his thoughts to the task of restoring his native city, then in degradation and wretchedness, not only to good order, but even to her pristine greatness. His zeal for this work was quickened by the desire to avenge his brother who had been killed by a noble. Rienzi vowing to obtain justice for the death of his young brother by William Holman Hunt, 1848‚Äì49 He became a notaryMusto, Ronald G., \\"Cola Di Rienzo\\", Oxford Biographies, 21 November 2012, DOI: 10.1093/obo/9780195399301-0122 and a person of some importance in the city, and was sent in 1343 on a public errand to Pope Clement VI at Avignon. He discharged his duties with ability and success, and although the boldness with which he denounced the aristocratic rulers of Rome drew down upon him the enmity of powerful men, he won the favour and esteem of the pope, who gave him an official position at his court. Leader of revolt Returning to Rome about April 1344 he worked for three years at the great object of his life, the restoration of the city to its former position of power. He gathered together a band of supporters, plans were drawn up, and at length all was ready for the insurrection. On 19 May 1347 heralds invited the people to a parliament on the Capitol, and on 20 May, Whit-Sunday, the meeting took place. Dressed in full armor and attended by the papal vicar, Cola headed a procession to the Capitol, where he addressed the assembled crowd, speaking \\"with fascinating eloquence of the servitude and redemption of Rome.\\" A new series of laws was published and accepted with acclaim, and unlimited authority and power was given to the author of the revolution. Without striking a blow the nobles left the city or went into hiding, and a few days later Rienzo took the title of tribune (Nicholaus, severus et clemens, libertatis, pacis justiciaeque tribunus, et sacr√¶ Roman√¶ Reipublic√¶ liberator). Tribune of Rome His authority quickly and quietly accepted by all classes, the new ruler governed the city with a stern justice which was in marked contrast to the recent reign of license and disorder. In great state the tribune moved through the streets of Rome, being received at St. Peter's with the hymn Veni Creator Spiritus, while in a letter the poet Petrarch urged him to continue his great and noble work, and congratulated him on his past achievements, calling him the new Camillus, Brutus and Romulus. All the nobles submitted, though with great reluctance; the roads were cleared of robbers; tranquillity was restored at home; some severe examples of justice intimidated offenders; and the tribune was regarded by all the people as the destined restorer of Rome and Italy. Attempt to unify Italy In July in a sonorous decree he proclaimed the sovereignty of the Roman people over the empire, but before this he had set to work upon his task of restoring the authority of Rome over the cities and provinces of Italy, of making the city again caput mundi. He wrote letters to the cities of Italy, asking them to send representatives to an assembly which would meet on 1 August, when the formation of a great federation under the headship of Rome would be considered. On the appointed day a number of representatives appeared, and after some elaborate and fantastic ceremonials Cola, as dictator, issued an edict citing Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor and his rival Charles, afterwards Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and also the imperial electors and all others concerned in the dispute, to appear before him in order that he might pronounce judgment in the case. Statue of di Rienzo On the following day the festival of the unity of Italy was celebrated, but neither this nor the previous meeting had any practical result. Cola's power, however, was recognized in the Kingdom of Naples, whence both Joan I of Naples and her bitter foe, Louis I of Hungary, appealed to him for protection and aid, and on 15 August with great pomp he was crowned Tribune. Ferdinand Gregorovius says this ceremony \\"was the fantastic caricature in which ended the imperium of Charles the Great. A world where political action was represented in such guise was ripe for overthrow, or could only be saved by a great mental reformation.\\" End of rule He then seized, but soon released, Stefano Colonna and some other barons who had spoken disparagingly of him, but his power was already beginning to wane. Cola di Rienzo's character has been described as a combination of knowledge, eloquence, and enthusiasm for ideal excellence, with vanity, inexperience of mankind, unsteadiness, and physical timidity. As these latter qualities became conspicuous, they eclipsed his virtues, and caused his benefits to be forgotten. His extravagant pretensions only served to excite ridicule. His government was costly, and to meet its many expenses he was obliged to lay heavy taxes upon the people. He offended the pope by his arrogance and pride, and both pope and emperor by his proposal to set up a new Roman Empire, the sovereignty of which would rest directly upon the will of the people. In October Clement gave power to a legate to depose him and bring him to trial, and the end was obviously in sight. Taking heart, the exiled barons gathered together some troops, and war began in the neighbourhood of Rome. Cola di Rienzo obtained aid from Louis of Hungary and others, and on 20 November his forces defeated the nobles in the Battle of Porta San Lorenzo. just outside the Porta Tiburtina, a battle in which the tribune himself took no part, but in which his most distinguished foe, Stefano Colonna, was killed. But this victory did not save him. He passed his time in feasts and pageants, while in a bull the pope denounced him as a criminal, a pagan and a heretic, until, terrified by a slight disturbance on 15 December, he abdicated his government and fled from Rome. He sought refuge in Naples, but soon he left that city and spent over two years in an Italian mountain monastery. Life in captivity Emerging from his solitude, Cola journeyed to Prague in July 1350, throwing himself upon the protection of the emperor Charles IV. Denouncing the temporal power of the pope he implored the emperor to deliver Italy, and especially Rome, from their oppressors; but, heedless of his invitations, Charles kept him in prison for more than a year in the fortress of Raudnitz, and then handed him over to Pope Clement. At Avignon, where he appeared in August 1352, Cola was tried by three cardinals, and was sentenced to death, but this judgment was not carried out, and he remained in prison in spite of appeals from Petrarch for his release. In December 1352 Clement died, and his successor, Pope Innocent VI, anxious to strike a blow at the baronial rulers of Rome, and seeing in the former tribune an excellent tool for this purpose, pardoned and released Rienzi. Senator of Rome The pope then sent Cola to Italy with the legate, Cardinal Albornoz, and giving him the title of senator. Having collected a few mercenary troops on the way, Cola entered Rome in August 1354, where he was received with great rejoicing and quickly regained his former position of power. But this latter term of office was destined to be even shorter than his former one. Having vainly besieged the fortress of Palestrina, he returned to Rome, where he treacherously seized the soldier of fortune Giovanni Moriale, who was put to death, and where, by other cruel and arbitrary deeds, he soon lost the favour of the people. Their passions were quickly aroused and a tumult broke out on 8 October. Cola attempted to address them, but the building in which he stood was set on fire, and while trying to escape in disguise he was murdered by the mob. Legacy The so-called Casa di Rienzi still in its urban context before the opening of the Via del Mare in a watercolour by Ettore Roesler Franz (about 1880). Epistolario di Cola di Rienzo Cola di Rienzo was the hero of one of the finest of Petrarch's odes, Spirito gentil. Having advocated both the abolition of the Pope's temporal power and the Unification of Italy, Cola re- emerged in the 19th century, transformed into a romantic figure among politically liberal nationalists and adopted as a precursor of the 19th century Risorgimento, which struggled for and eventually achieved both aims. In this process he was reimagined as \\"the romantic stereotype of the inspired dreamer who foresees the national future\\" as Adrian Lyttleton expressed it, illustrating his point with Federico Faruffini's Cola di Rienzo Contemplating the Ruins of Rome (1855) of which he remarks, \\"The language of martyrdom could be freed from its religious context and used against the Church.\\"The cultural context of this refiguration of Cola is examined by Adrian Lyttelton, \\"Creating a National Past: History, Myth and Image in the Risorgimento\\", in Making and Remaking Italy: the cultivation of national identity around the Risorgimento, 2001:27‚Äì76; Cola is examined in pp 61‚Äì63 (quote p 63). Cola di Rienzo's life and fate have formed the subject of a novel by Edward Bulwer- Lytton (1835), tragic plays by Gustave Drouineau (1826), Mary Russell Mitford (1828), Julius Mosen (1837), and Friedrich Engels (1841), and also of some verses of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage (1818) by Lord Byron. Richard Wagner's first successful opera, Rienzi (Dresden, 1842), based on Bulwer-Lytton's novel, took Cola for a central figure, and at the same time, unaware of the Dresden production, Giuseppe Verdi, an ardent and anti-clerical patriot of the Risorgimento, contemplated a Cola di Rienzo.George Martin, Verdi, His Music, Life and Times, 1963:126, mentioning Bulwer-Lytton's \\"immensely popular historical novel\\" and remarking \\"As a leader sprung from the people, Rienzi was at the time a favorite symbol and hero of liberals and republicans throughout Europe.\\" In 1873 ‚Äì only three years after the new Kingdom of Italy effected the Capture of Rome from papal forces ‚Äì the rione Prati was laid out, with the new quarter's main street being \\"Via Cola di Rienzo\\" and a conspicuous square, Piazza Cola di Rienzo. Pointedly, the name was bestowed precisely on the street connecting the Tiber with the Vatican ‚Äì at the time the headquarters of a Catholic Church still far from reconciled to the loss of its temporal power. To further drive home the point, the Piazza del Risorgimento was located at the Via Cola di Rienzo's western end, directly touching upon the Church's headquarters. In 1877 a statue of the tribune by Girolamo Masini, was erected at the foot of Rome's Capitoline Hill. In Rome, in rione Ripa, near the Bocca della Verit√† there still exists a brick decorated house of the Middle Ages, distinguished by the appellation of \\"The House of Pilate\\", but also traditionally known as Cola di Rienzo's house (in fact it belonged to the patrician Crescenzi family). Irish poet and playwright John Todhunter wrote a drama in 1881 entitled The True Tragedy Of Rienzi Tribune Of Rome. Shakespearean in style, it is largely historically accurate. His letters, edited by A. Gabrielli, are published in vol. vi. of the Fonti per la storia d‚ÄôItalia (Rome, 1890). According to August Kubizek, a childhood friend of Adolf Hitler's, it was at a performance of Wagner's opera Rienzi that Hitler, as a teenager, had his first ecstatic vision of the reunification of the German people.Kubizek, A.

Production The Bacchae was shot in the autumn of 2000, three years after director Brad Mays' highly successful, award-nominated theatrical production of Euripides' play at the Complex in Los Angeles. Originally conceived on a larger scale than what eventually went into production, the film suffered tremendously from budget cuts and artistic differences, most particularly between the director and co-producer John Morrissey (American History X). Story Having established his divinity in eastern lands, Dionysus - the god of wine - returns to Thebes, land of his birth as well as his mortal mother Semele's horrible and shameful death. Angered over his homeland's refusal to acknowledge his divine nature, the son of Zeus intends to establish the worship which he insists is now his due. Having put a spell on all the local women, a great celebration of dance and wine takes place in the nearby Glens of Cithaeron, attended even by the former king Cadmus and blind prophet Teiresias. When word of this outlandishness reaches Pentheus, the young and rational King of Thebes, he orders the immediate arrest of the blonde stranger responsible for the mayhem. Unaware that his strange prisoner is a god, Pentheus refuses to even consider the possibility that Bacchic worship has a place in the modern world. Unable to endure such an affront, the god Dionysus casts a spell over the young king and leads him into the mountains, where he is ultimately torn limb from limb by the ecstatic worshippers, whose number now includes Pentheus' own mother, Agave. Background Opening ritual in The Bacchae, directed by Brad Mays, 2000. King Pentheus (Jonathan Klein) in drag The Bacchae, directed by Brad Mays, 2000. Director Brad Mays' 1997 stage production of The Bacchae had been a surprise hit in Los Angeles, drawing large audiences and earning excellent reviews. It was ultimately nominated for three LA Weekly Theatre Awards, for Production Design, Original Musical Score, and Direction. Considered particularly noteworthy was the production's use of ample though non-exploitive full-frontal nudity, most particularly in scenes portraying ritualized pagan worship and, ultimately, the violent ritual killing of the character Pentheus, king of Thebes. A major contributing factor in the production's effectiveness was the movement scoring by choreographer Kim Weild, a practitioner of the Suzuki method of dance/movement. In the months which followed the production's closing, its creators began to ponder the feasibility of an independently produced film version. Several of the stage production's cast were invited to re-create their roles for the film which, according to Eric Grode in an article written for the entertainment industry publication Playbill, was also to include British actors Brian Blessed and Alan Bates. Citing audience \\"fist fights\\" over theatre tickets for the stage production, Grode anticipated an exciting, hard-hitting contemporary film version, \\"as edgy as any Tarantino knock-off,\\" promising \\"nudity, gore and rock music galore.\\" Unfortunately, the notion of a contemporary film adaptation of a 2,500-year-old play was eventually seen as impossibly risky, and much of the committed funding was ultimately withdrawn. A stripped-down version of the script was shot and edited, with decidedly uneven results. Director Mays and producer Starfelt decided to let the film go and, despite intense interest and numerous rumors to the contrary, have yet to seek distribution. In 2009, director Brad Mays, along with Nobel Prize winner Wole Soyinka, stage director Richard Schechner, and actor Alan Cumming was invited to discuss Euripides' The Bacchae as part of a web series Invitation to World Literature, which officially launched on Annenberg Media's educational website in September, 2010. The series, produced by Annie Wong for WGBH Boston, also began airing nationally on PBS in October, 2010. Clips from Mays' film were heavily used in the program.

There is a branch of Kabul River called (shahalam) flowing in the outskirts of Chaghar Matti, which plays an important role in the economy of the village. This river provides water for irrigation, environment for various fishes and birds‚Äô species and providing scenic beauties. The fame of Chaghar Matti is due to the Tomb of Ashab Baba (the companions of Muhammad May Peace and Be Upon Him). Chaghar Matti is a part of Daudzai. Hujra is the traditional meeting place for the men and also serves as a guest house in Chaghar Matti. There are more than twenty small villages around Chaghar Matti, which have got their own local names, but they are known by the name of Chaghar Matti. Chaghar Matti is a central place for these villagers.See Pages 116 and 181 Report of the regular settlement of Peshawar district 1878 History It is believed that Matai got its name after Chagharzai tribe who lived here before Daudzai's came to the area. Another theory is that the name may be given by Sikhs, the Sikhs called this village \\"Chakni Matti\\" due to its fertile soil. This is also believed that 'Matai' and 'Jatai' were two villages not too far from each another and one day the Kabul River flooded to the extent that it washed away the entire village. The residents of Matai had to find a place on a high ground to escape the flood water. The two villages became apart and Matai found its new abode on the Southern bank of River Kabul leaving behind the sister village of Jatai at its original location. Matai and Jatai are still pronounced together by the people of Hashtnagar and Charsadda, thinking that it is the name of one village. The present village is situated at least 20 to 30 feet high from the river bed. The village changed its names over the course of time from Chukri matti, Chughri Matti, Chaghri Matti, to the present official name of Chaghar matti. The village is situated on the bank of Kabul River (a branch of River Kabul known as Shahlamay).

To the South West of the village and near Pir Kalay, the resting place of Sharhsham (Gul) Baba is another attraction due to the abundance of Date Palms. This place is said to be the camping ground of Ashab Baba ( ÿßÿµÿ≠ÿßÿ® ÿ®ÿßÿ®ÿß ), who brought dates with them as a food ration for the troops. The seeds became the date palms. The Date palms are not seen elsewhere in the area in such a large quantity. The locals consider these palms sacred and as opposed to other species of the trees, the branches or trunks are not burnt as fuel for cooking. However the branches were/are being used for heating water for ablution in the mosques and the trunks are still used to bridge small irrigation drains. Location Chaghar matti is located 17 km away to the North West from Capital Peshawar and 5 km from warsak road. Chaghar Matti is at altitude of 345m (1,135 ft) above sea level.

History of Ashab baba According to local legend, the grave of Sanan bin Salma bin Muhbiq is located at Chaghar Matti in Peshawar, it is known as Ashab Baba ().It is a place of attraction for the people of NWFP. The fame of the village Chaghar Matti is also largely due to this grave. Sanan bin Salma was supposedly a companion of Muhammad. He along with other Mujahedeen Islam reached this particular place of Peshawar in order to fight against Hindu Rajas and raise the name of Islam. He was killed in 66 Hijree and was buried in Chaghar Matti; this is actually a long collective grave said to be of many companions of Muhammad and Mujahedeen. Sanan bin Salma Muhbiq was also a learned person and commander of army. When Khurasan was conquered, Ziyad ibn Abih was appointed as Hakim (Governor) of Khurasan. This was the period of Usman who had scattered his army in different regions. All these commanders and generals of army conveyed the message of monotheism. They traveled far and wide in order to preach this important concept of Allah. They believed that every land is the land of Allah. Among these Commanders, there was Abdullah ibn Sawar, who was killed along with other companions in Qalaat. After this incident in 66 Hijree, the Governor of Khurasan, Ziyada, sent Sanan bin Salma bin Muhbiq as a Commander to conquer the regions of Hindustan. According to legend, first he crushed the revolt in Makran and waving the flag of Islam went ahead. After sometime he conquered Qalaat and Quetta. Here he established the foundation of a strong Islamic Government. Then after conquering D.I. Khan and Bannu he reached Kohat and in Kohat he established his rule. Then he entered the valley of Peshawar. After conquering Peshawar, Sanan bin Salma bin Muhbiq entered into ‚ÄúDaudzai‚Äù and in Chaghar Matti, the great commander and his army fought a bloody battle. Conquering this place, Sanan bin Salma bin Muhbiq and his other Mujahedeen (fighters for the sake of Islam) were killed. All these people were supposedly buried here in Chaghar Matti. This tomb is now known as Ashab Baba, which over the years has assumed the status of a shrine. There are many other shrines in the vicinity: They include the shrine of Sharsham Baba and shrine of Mian Je Baba, the shrine of Nadan Shaheed and Chahal Ghazi Baba near Chaghar Matti.

The station was located on the East Coast Main Line between Northallerton and Darlington. It was served by local trains on the East Coast Main Line, and also trains operating the Eryholme-Richmond branch line. History The first railway to Croft-on-Tees was built by the coal-carrying Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&DR;) as one of its many short branches to serve collieries. The Croft branch left the main line to the South, near Darlington Bank Top station. A passenger station opened on 27 October 1829. The section of the Great North of England Railway (GNoER) between Darlington and York opened (for goods traffic only) on 4 January 1841; and passenger trains along the line were introduced on 30 March 1841, when a station at Croft was opened by the GNoER, which allowed the S&DR; passenger station to be closed on the same day. The GNoER, after a series of amalgamations, became part of the North Eastern Railway (NER) when that was formed in 1854. The NER renamed the station Croft Spa on 1 October 1896; after it gained popularity for its spa waters, the site of which was very close to the railway station. At the start of 1923, the NER amalgamated with other railways to form the London and North Eastern Railway during the Grouping. Passing on to the Eastern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. In 1958 local trains between Northallerton and Darlington ceased stopping and it was then served only by trains to and from the Richmond branch until its closure by the British Railways Board on 3 March 1969.

Biography The oldest of five children, Machebeuf was born in Riom to Michael and Gilberte (n√©e Plauc) Machebeuf. He received his early education from the Brothers of the Christian Schools, and studied the classics in the college of his native city. He then entered the Sulpician-run seminary of Montferrand in 1831, and upon completing his course in philosophy and theology, was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Louis-Charles F√©ron on December 17, 1836. He served as a curate in Le Cendre until 1839, when he accepted the invitation of Bishop John Baptist Purcell to join the Diocese of Cincinnati, Ohio, in the United States. He was first assigned as a curate in Tiffin and then as pastor of Lower Sandusky and Sandusky, Ohio in 1841. He founded Holy Angels Catholic Church, Sandusky, St Ann's Catholic Church, Fremont, and St Philomena's Catholic Church, La Prairie, before leaving Ohio in 1851 to join his friend, Jean- Baptiste Lamy in New Mexico. Following the elevation of Jean-Baptiste Lamy to Vicar Apostolic of New Mexico in 1850, Machebeuf accompanied him and became his vicar-general. He served as pastor at Albuquerque (1853‚Äì1858) and at Santa Fe (1858‚Äì1860) before being transferred to Colorado, where he was thrown from his carriage while descending a spur of the Rocky Mountains and lamed for life. Afterwards, he would conclude his letters with, \\"Pray always for the poor cripple\\". In Colorado, he organized parishes, procured priests and by 1868 had erected eighteen churches, among them being the first church in Denver. On March 3, 1868, Machebeuf was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Colorado and Utah as well as Titular Bishop of Epiphania in Cilicia by Pope Pius IX. He received his episcopal consecration on the following August 16 from Bishop Purcell, with Bishops Louis Amadeus Rappe and Louis De Goesbriand serving as co-consecrators. He founded an academy and a school for boys in Denver (not to be confused with the college preparatory high school named in his honor, but founded after his death), a convent of the Sisters of Loretto, St. Joseph's Hospital, House of the Good Shepherd and the College of the Sacred Heart (now part of Regis University). The Catholic population of Colorado increased under his tenure from a few thousand to upwards of 50,000. On August 7, 1887, the vicariate was elevated to the rank of a diocese, and Machebeuf was named its first bishop. He died two years later, aged 76. His life was the basis for the character Joseph Vaillant in Willa Cather's 1927 novel Death Comes for the Archbishop. He is also the namesake of Bishop Machebeuf High School, located in Denver, CO. The school was founded in 1958.

Etymology and origins  Makara as the Vahana (vehicle) of the river-goddess Ganga The name comes from the Sanskrit ‡§Æ‡§ï‡§∞ makara meaning \\"crocodile\\" and ‡§Ü‡§∏‡§® ƒÅsana meaning \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". Makarasana is described in the 17th-century Ghera·πá·∏ça Sa·πÅhitƒÅ (Chapter 2, Verse 40). =Myth= Makara is commonly translated crocodile, but has also been assumed to be a sea-creature like a shark or dolphin, and may have been a wholly mythical beast. In Hindu mythology, it was the animal vehicle of the sea-god Varuna, and of the river- goddess Ganga. A different myth in the Ramayana tells how Hanuman, seeking to drink from a lake, is seized, pulled under, and swallowed by a crocodile. Hanuman changes shape to become so large that the crocodile bursts, leaving a beautiful apsara nymph named Dhyanamalini who reveals that she had been cursed to become the monster.  Description  In Light on Yoga, B. K. S. Iyengar notes that the Gheranda Samhita describes the pose as lying prone with both legs \\"stretched out\\"; the head is caught in the arms, and the pose is said to \\"increase bodily heat\\". Iyengar describes it as a variation of SalabhƒÅsana, locust pose and illustrates it as such, with the head and legs raised energetically, the fingers interlocked clasping the back of the head, and the elbows high off the ground. MakarƒÅsana is however often used as a relaxation asana, an alternative to the supine SavƒÅsana, and both head and legs are rested on the floor.

The BID is often funded primarily through the levy but can also draw on other public and private funding streams. BIDs may go by other names, such as business improvement area (BIA), business revitalization zone (BRZ), community improvement district (CID), special services area (SSA), or special improvement district (SID). These districts typically fund services which are perceived by some businesses as being inadequately performed by government with its existing tax revenues, such as cleaning streets, providing security, making capital improvements, construction of pedestrian and streetscape enhancements, and marketing the area. The services provided by BIDs are supplemental to those already provided by the municipality.Southeast Tennessee Development District, Chattanooga, TN. \\"Green Infrastructure Handbook.\\" January 2011. The revenue derives from a tax assessment on commercial property owners, and in some cases, residential property owners. Development The first BID was the Bloor West Village Business Improvement Area, established in Toronto in 1970 as an initiative by local private business. The first BID in the United States was the Downtown Development District in New Orleans established in 1974, and there were 1,200 across the country by 2011. Other countries with BIDs include Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Jamaica, Serbia, Albania, Germany, Ireland, Singapore, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The process for creating a BID varies from one jurisdiction to another. In the United States, it generally involves three steps. First, some number of businesses in the area petition the local government to create the BID. Second, the local government determines that a majority of businesses want the BID. Third, the local government enacts legislation creating the BID. Prior to this occurring, state legislatures need to grant local units the authority to create BIDs. The operating budgets of BIDs range from a few thousand dollars to tens of millions of dollars. A BID may be operated by a nonprofit organization or by a quasi-governmental entity. The governance of a BID is the responsibility of a board composed of some combination of property owners, businesses, and government officials. The management of a BID is the job of a paid administrator, usually occupying the position of an executive director of a management company. BIDs in England and Wales are funded by a levy on the occupiers rather than the owners of the properties within the area. If voted in by local businesses, the BID levy is an extension to existing non-domestic business-rates. \\"In England and Wales, for a BID to go ahead the ballot must be won on two counts: straight majority and majority of rateable value. In Scotland for a ballot to be successful it must meet four criteria, a minimum turnout of 25% by the number of eligible persons (the headcount) and by rateable value and a majority of those that vote by number of ballots and by rateable value must vote in favour. This ensures that the interests of large and small businesses are protected.\\" Distribution=United States= By 1996 there were over 1,000 BIDs in the United States. New York City has 76 BIDs, the most of any city; in NYC, BIDs invest $159 million annually in neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs. BIDs exist in almost every one of the top 50 largest cities in the United States, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, DC. Minneapolis and Boston have been the last of the top 20 largest regions to adopt a business improvement district. The State of Wisconsin has adopted the most for smaller towns, with about 90 in the state, 25 of those being in Milwaukee and the rest throughout the state. =Canada= In Canada, Toronto has 81 BIAs within its city limit. Montreal ‚Äì where BIAs are called Soci√©t√©s de D√©veloppement Commerciale (SDC) ‚Äì has 17. The City of Winnipeg has 16 \\"Business Improvement Zones,\\" the first of which were formed in 1987, with the amendment of The City of Winnipeg Act. In the province of Alberta, they are termed \\"business revitalization zones\\". There are nine zones in the city of Calgary and 10 in Edmonton. Regina, Saskatchewan has two Business Improvement Districts: Regina Downtown (BID) and The Warehouse District. Saskatoon, Saskatchewan has 4 Business Improvement Districts: The Broadway BID, The Downtown Partnership, The Sutherland BID and The Riversdale BID. Some work has been made on creating a 5th BID in Saskatoon for the area of 33rd Street. It is estimated that there are over 400 BIDs in Canada but no count has been made. There are 8 business improvement districts in the Halifax Regional Municipality. Halifax Regional Municipality has passed by laws in 2012 regarding the formation and conduct of these BIDs. The 8 BIDS are: Downtown Halifax Business Commission, Downtown Dartmouth Business Commission, Spring Garden Area Business Association, North End Business Association, Quinpool Mainstreet and District Association Ltd. Sackville Business Association, Spryfield Business Association, Main Street Dartmouth Business Association. BIDs have also become a powerful lobby group, lobbying government for improvements such as new sidewalks, trees, park benches and other restorations. BIDs can also lobby different levels of government for a complete facelift on their area if they feel it is necessary to improve business. The Rideau Street BIA in Ottawa has lobbied the city for years to give the entire street a face-lift because of its \\"run down\\" look. =England and Wales= In England and Wales, BIDs were introduced through the Local Government Act 2003, and subsequent regulations in 2004. The Circle Initiative, a five-year scheme funded by the London Development Agency, set up the first pilot BIDs, five in London, all of which had successful ballots by March 2006. The first UK BID 'Kingston First' was established in Kingston upon Thames in January 2005. In October 2007 there were 36 proposed or operational BIDs across Greater London, and by late 2014 there were over 180 in operation in the United Kingdom. The New West End Company is the management and promotional company for London's Bond Street, Oxford Street and Regent Street. As one of the largest BIDs in Europe, New West End Company brings together the commercial interests of over 600 retailers, property owners and West End businesses working closely with the Mayor of London, Transport for London, Westminster City Council, the Metropolitan Police and local neighbours. Better Bankside was the third BID to be established in the UK, the second in London and the first south of the river. It was founded in 2005, and underwent a successful re-ballot in 2010 with 82% of businesses in favour. It won awards including Best Visitor Information Initiatives Silver Award in 2008, the Best Community Project 2011 and Best Partnership Award 2012 in the Mayor of London‚Äôs BID Awards, and was short-listed for Best Marketing & Communications Campaign, Transport for London Smarter Travel Awards 2010.Making Bankside a better place to live, work and visit.

Retrieved on 2013-12-06. =Scotland= Business Improvement Districts Scotland is the national organisation and voice for BIDs in Scotland, responsible for delivering the Scottish Government's BIDs programme, providing central support to developing BIDs, promoting and encouraging the development of BIDs across the country, whilst also working with operational BIDs to assist them in delivering for their local communities and contributing to sustainable inclusive economic growth. The Scottish Government provides a grant to local groups of up to ¬£20,000 to help with the development of the BID. The legislation in Scotland (The Planning etc. (Scotland) Act 2006) is different from the England and Wales legislation in that it allows property owners as well as occupiers to be included in a BID. There are also differences in the timescales, ballot and reballot criteria, and the legislative requirements of the BID proposer. In Scotland, for a ballot to be successful it must meet four criteria: a minimum turnout of 25% (by the number of eligible persons and by rateable value); and a majority of those that vote (by number of ballots and by rateable value). The intention of the Scottish legislation is that BIDs are not restricted to towns and city centres, to allow innovative BIDs to be developed across the country. The consultation of 2003 proposed that the BID model could be used in business parks, tourism and visitor areas, rural areas, agriculture and single-business sectors. The legislation and subsequent regulations were passed by the Scottish Parliament in 2006 and 2007 respectively. In March 2006, the Scottish Government announced funding for six pilot BIDs in Scotland: Bathgate (town centre), Clackmannanshire (business parks), Edinburgh (city centre), Falkirk (town centre), Glasgow (city centre) and Inverness (city centre). There are currently thirty seven operational BIDs in Scotland with a further twenty four in development. The operational BIDs include thirty one town and city centre BIDs and three business park BIDs. In March 2014 the first tourism BID was delivered in Loch Ness and Inverness. The first themed BID in Scotland was delivered in December 2013, the Sauchiehall Street Evening Economy BID. In 2016 the world's first food and drink BID was delivered in East Lothian with the levy based on the number of full-time employes, also a first. The development and interest in the BIDs model in Scotland continues to grow and the flexibility of the legislation and the model is now being recognised with the development of the Borders Railway BIDs Corridor, and four canal BIDs led by Scottish Waterways Trust. In 2017 BIDs Scotland published The National Report on BIDs in Scotland which covers the types of BIDs, number of businesses, levels of employment in BIDs in Scotland and the contribution they make to sustainable and inclusive economic growth. =Germany= Six of the sixteen German Bundeslander (Federal States) introduced the requisite legal framework to create BIDs: Hamburg, Bremen, Hessen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saarland and Schleswig-Holstein. BID projects in implementation exist only in a few German cities, yet ‚Äì e.g. in Flensburg, Hamburg and Giessen. Criticism Whilst BIDs have been heralded for improving the trading environment, BIDs have also received noteworthy criticism. BIDs have been accused of being unaccountable ‚Äì a 1997 report on the lack of accountability in some City of New York BIDs and recommendations for reform and by their very nature undemocratic, concentrating power in a geographic area into the hands of the few.Wayne Batchis, Business Improvement Districts and the Constitution: The Troubling Necessity of Privatized Government for Urban Revitalization, 38 Hastings Const. L.Q. 91 (2010). ‚Äì A critical look at business improvement districts (BIDs) Small businesses who fall below the BID levy threshold, although not liable to pay the BID levy, are often priced out of an area because BIDs tend to increase rental values. Larger businesses are more able to absorb these rent increases, particularly the multiple stores. BIDs have also been criticized in the past by anti- poverty groups for being too harsh on the homeless and poor who may congregate around businesses. BIDs have also been known to be opposed to street vendors such as hot dog vendors and chip wagons. In London, street traders who sold small items to tourists were barred from Oxford Street in London. President of Civic Voice, Griff Rhys Jones criticised the creation of a BID in central London neighbourhood saying that is undemocratic: \\"Neither the people who live there, nor the many intriguing small shops and businesses, have been allowed to vote or have even been consulted.\\". \\"I am wary of this initiative because of what may become unintended consequences (or indeed intended consequences) that help one sort of business (the property letting business) but will cause problems to smaller businesses and the large and wholly integrated residential population of the district\\".Griff Rhys Jones \\"We need to fight this undemocratic attempt to manipulate Fitzrovia into something it is not\\" Fitzrovia News, 24 July 2012. He also criticised some of the methods to oppose the BID. See also * Special-purpose district * Redevelopment * Infill ReferencesFurther reading *Becker, C. & Seth A.

Life A native of Lincolnshire, he matriculated as a pensioner of St. John's College, Cambridge, 27 May 1559, was elected a Lady Margaret scholar on 27 July following, proceeded B.A. in 1564, and became a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1565. He was admitted M.A. at Oxford, 17 October 1574, and D.D. 15 July 1580. In 1574 he received from the crown the rectory of Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, and in 1575 resigned his fellowship at Magdalen. On 24 March 1582 he was installed canon of Westminster. In 1584 Bond was recommended by Archbishop John Whitgift to the Queen for the mastership of the Temple, vacant by the death of Richard Alvey. He became rector of Britwell, Oxfordshire, on 3 May 1586, and of Alresford, Hampshire, in 1590; he also held the offices of chaplain of the Savoy Hospital and chaplain-in-ordinary to the queen. On 6 April 1590 he became president of Magdalen College. The queen had directed the fellows of the college to elect Bond to that office some months previously; but another candidate, Ralph Smith, then received a majority of the votes. Bond's supporters had recourse to a tactic: the announcement of the result was delayed beyond the statutable time within which the fellows were lawfully able to exercise their rights of election. The duty of appointing the president thus reverted to the crown, and it was exercised in favour of Bond. Bond was vice-chancellor of Oxford University from 16 July 1590 to 16 July 1591, and from 13 July 1592 to 13 July 1593; he was brought into personal relations with Queen Elizabeth on her visit to Oxford in September 1592, during his second tenure of the vice-chancellorship. As an executor of the will of the Frances Radclyffe, Countess of Sussex, of 10 September 1595, Bond helped to found Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, on the site of the dissolved Greyfriars House. He received Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, when the prince took up his residence at Magdalen on 27 August 1605. Bond died on 8 February 1608, and was buried in the chapel of Magdalen College, where there is an inscription to his memory. He contributed Latin verses to the collection published at Oxford on the death of Queen Elizabeth. Bond has sometimes erroneously been confused with Nicholas Bownde.

Typically the hammer is attached to a piston that slides within a fixed cylinder, but in some designs the hammer is attached to a cylinder that slides along a fixed piston. The concept of the steam hammer was described by James Watt in 1784, but it was not until 1840 that the first working steam hammer was built to meet the needs of forging increasingly large iron or steel components. In 1843 there was an acrimonious dispute between Fran√ßois Bourdon of France and James Nasmyth of Britain over who had invented the machine. Bourdon had built the first working machine, but Nasmyth claimed it was built from a copy of his design. Steam hammers proved to be invaluable in many industrial processes. Technical improvements gave greater control over the force delivered, greater longevity, greater efficiency and greater power. A steam hammer built in 1891 by the Bethlehem Iron Company delivered a 125-ton blow. In the 20th century steam hammers were gradually displaced in forging by mechanical and hydraulic presses, but some are still in use. Compressed air power hammers, descendants of the early steam hammers, are still manufactured. Mechanism A single- frame double-acting steam hammer A single-acting steam hammer is raised by the pressure of steam injected into the lower part of a cylinder and drops under gravity when the pressure is released. With the more common double-acting steam hammer, steam is also used to push the ram down, giving a more powerful blow at the die. The weight of the ram may range from . The piece being worked is placed between a bottom die resting on an anvil block and a top die attached to the ram (hammer). Hammers are subject to repeated concussion, which could cause fracturing of cast iron components. The early hammers were therefore made from a number of parts bolted together. This made it cheaper to replace broken parts, and also gave a degree of elasticity that made fracture less likely. A steam hammer may have one or two supporting frames. The single frame design lets the operator move around the dies more easily, while the double frame can support a more powerful hammer. The frame(s) and the anvil block are mounted on wooden beams that protect the concrete foundations by absorbing the shock. Deep foundations are needed, but a large steam drop hammer will still shake the building that holds it. This may be solved with a counterblow steam hammer, in which two converging rams drive the top and bottom dies together. The upper ram is driven down and the lower ram is pulled or driven up. These hammers produce a large impact and can make large forgings. They can be installed with smaller foundations than anvil hammers of similar force. Counterblow hammers are not often used in the United States, but are common in Europe. With some early steam hammers an operator moved the valves by hand, controlling each blow. With others the valve action was automatic, allowing for rapid repetitive hammering. Automatic hammers could give an elastic blow, where steam cushioned the piston towards the end of the down stroke, or a dead blow with no cushioning. The elastic blow gave a quicker rate of hammering, but less force than the dead blow. Machines were built that could run in either mode according to the job requirement. The force of the blow could be controlled by varying the amount of steam introduced to cushion the blow. A modern air/steam hammer can deliver up to 300 blows per minute. History James Watt (1736‚Äì1819) described the concept of a steam hammer =Concept= The possibility of a steam hammer was noted by James Watt (1736‚Äì1819) in his 28 April 1784 patent for an improved steam engine. Watt described \\"Heavy Hammers or Stampers, for forging or stamping iron, copper, or other metals, or other matters without the intervention of rotative motions or wheels, by fixing the Hammer or Stamper to be so worked, either directly to the piston or piston rod of the engine.\\" Watt's design had the cylinder at one end of a wooden beam and the hammer at the other. The hammer did not move vertically, but in the arc of a circle. On 6 June 1806 W. Deverell, engineer of Surrey, filed a patent for a steam-powered hammer or stamper. The hammer would be welded to a piston rod contained in a cylinder. Steam from a boiler would be let in under the piston, raising it and compressing the air above it. The steam would then be released and the compressed air would force the piston down. In August 1827 John Hague was awarded a patent for a method of working cranes and tilt-hammers driven by a piston in an oscillating cylinder where air power supplied the motive force. A partial vacuum was made in one end of a long cylinder by an air pump worked by a steam engine or some other power source, and atmospheric pressure drove the piston into that end of the cylinder. When a valve was reversed, the vacuum was formed in the other end and the piston forced in the opposite direction. Hague made a hammer to this design for planishing frying pans. Many years later, when discussing the advantages of air over steam for delivering power, it was recalled that Hague's air hammer \\"worked with such an extraordinary rapidity that it was impossible to see where the hammer was in working, and the effect was seemed more like giving one continuous pressure.\\" However, it was not possible to regulate the force of the blows. =Invention= The Nasmyth steam hammer It seems probable that the Scottish Engineer James Nasmyth (1808‚Äì1890) and his French counterpart Fran√ßois Bourdon (1797‚Äì1865) reinvented the steam hammer independently in 1839, both trying to solve the same problem of forging shafts and cranks for the increasingly large steam engines used in locomotives and paddle boats. In Nasmyth's 1883 \\"autobiography\\", written by Samuel Smiles, he described how the need arose for a paddle shaft for Isambard Kingdom Brunel's new transatlantic steamer SS Great Britain, with a diameter shaft, larger than any that had been previously forged. He came up with his steam hammer design, making a sketch dated 24 November 1839, but the immediate need disappeared when the practicality of screw propellers was demonstrated and the Great Britain was converted to that design. Nasmyth showed his design to all visitors. Bourdon came up with the idea of what he called a \\"Pilon\\" in 1839 and made detailed drawings of his design, which he also showed to all engineers who visited the works at Le Creusot owned by the brothers Adolphe and Eug√®ne Schneider. However, the Schneiders hesitated to build Bourdon's radical new machine. Bourdon and Eug√®ne Schneider visited the Nasmyth works in England in the middle of 1840, where they were shown Nasmyth's sketch. This confirmed the feasibility of the concept to Schneider. In 1840 Bourdon built the first steam hammer in the world at the Schneider & Cie works at Le Creusot. It weighed and lifted to . The Schneiders patented the design in 1841. Nasmyth visited Le Creusot in April 1842. By his account, Bourdon took him to the forge department so he might, as he said, \\"see his own child\\". Nasmyth said \\"there it was, in truth-a thumping child of my brain!\\" After returning from France in 1842 Nasmyth built his first steam hammer in his Patricroft foundry in Manchester, England, adjacent to the (then new) Liverpool and Manchester Railway and the Bridgewater Canal. In 1843 a dispute broke out between Nasmyth and Bourdon over priority of invention of the steam hammer. Nasmyth, an excellent publicist, managed to convince many people that he was the first. =Early improvements= Nasmyth & Wilson steam hammer at the University of Bolton Nasmyth's first steam hammer, described in his patent of 9 December 1842, was built for the Low Moor Works at Bradford. They rejected the machine, but on 18 August 1843 accepted an improved version with a self-acting gear. Robert Wilson (1803‚Äì1882), who had also invented the screw propeller and was manager of Nasmyth's Bridgewater works, invented the self-acting motion that made it possible to adjust the force of the blow delivered by the hammer - a critically important improvement. An early writer said of Wilson's gear, \\"... I would be prouder to say that I was the inventor of that motion, then to say I had commanded a regiment at Waterloo...\\" Nasmyth's steam hammers could now vary the force of the blow across a wide range. Nasmyth was fond of breaking an egg placed in a wineglass without breaking the glass, followed by a blow that shook the building. By 1868 engineers had introduced further improvements to the original design. John Condie's steam hammer, built for Fulton in Glasgow, had a stationary piston and a moving cylinder to which the hammer was attached. The piston was hollow, and was used to deliver steam to the cylinder and then remove it. The hammer weighed 6.5 tons with a stroke of . Condie steam hammers were used to forge the shafts of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's SS Great Eastern. A high-speed compressed-air hammer was described in The Mechanics' Magazine in 1865, a variant of the steam hammer for use where steam power was not available or a very dry environment was required. The Bowling Ironworks steam hammers had the steam cylinder bolted to the back of the hammer, thus reducing the height of the machine. These were designed by John Charles Pearce, who took out a patent for his steam hammer design several years before Nasmyth's patent expired. Marie-Joseph Farcot of Paris proposed a number of improvements including an arrangement so the steam acted from above, increasing the striking force, improved valve arrangements and the use of springs and material to absorb the shock and prevent breakage. John Ramsbottom invented a duplex hammer, with two rams moving horizontally towards a forging placed between them. Using the same principles of operation, Nasmyth developed a steam-powered pile-driving machine. At its first use at Devonport, a dramatic contest was carried out. His engine drove a pile in four and half minutes compared with the twelve hours that the conventional method required. It was soon found that a hammer with a relatively short fall height was more effective than a taller machine. The shorter machine could deliver many more blows in a given time, driving the pile faster even though each blow was smaller. It also caused less damage to the pile. Riveting machines designed by Garforth and Cook were based on the steam hammer. The catalog for the Great Exhibition held in London in 1851 said of Garforth's design, \\"With this machine, one man and three boys can rivet with perfect ease, and in the firmest manner, at the rate of six rivets per minute, or three hundred and sixty per hour.\\" Other variants included crushers to help extract iron ore from quartz and a hammer to drive holes in the rock of a quarry to hold gunpowder charges. An 1883 book on modern steam practice said =Later development= The giant Creusot steam hammer built in 1877 by Schneider et Cie in Le Creusot Schneider & Co. built 110 steam hammers between 1843 and 1867 with different sizes and strike rates, but trending towards ever larger machines to handle the demands of large cannon, engine shafts and armor plate, with steel increasingly used in place of wrought iron. In 1861 the \\"Fritz\\" steam hammer came into operation at the Krupp works in Essen, Germany. With a 50-ton blow, for many years it was the most powerful in the world. There is a story that the Fritz steam hammer took its name from a machinist named Fritz whom Alfred Krupp presented to the Emperor William when he visited the works in 1877. Krupp told the emperor that Fritz had such perfect control of the machine that he could let the hammer drop without harming an object placed on the center of the block. The Emperor immediately put his watch, which was studded with diamonds, on the block and motioned Fritz to start the hammer. When the machinist hesitated, Krupp told him \\"Fritz let fly!\\" He did as he was told, the watch was unharmed, and the emperor gave Fritz the watch as a gift. Krupp had the words \\"Fritz let fly!\\" engraved on the hammer. The Schneiders eventually saw a need for a hammer of colossal proportions. The Creusot steam hammer was a giant steam hammer built in 1877 by Schneider and Co. in the French industrial town of Le Creusot. With the ability to deliver a blow of up to 100 tons, the Creusot hammer was the largest and most powerful in the world. A wooden replica was built for the Exposition Universelle (1878) in Paris. In 1891 the Bethlehem Iron Company of the United States purchased patent rights from Schneider and built a steam hammer of almost identical design but capable of delivering a 125-ton blow. Eventually the great steam hammers became obsolete, displaced by hydraulic and mechanical presses. The presses applied force slowly and at a uniform rate, ensuring that the internal structure of the forging was uniform, without hidden internal flaws. The 1877 Creusot steam hammer now stands as a monument in the Creusot town square. An original Nasmyth hammer stands facing his foundry buildings (now a 'business park'). A larger Nasmyth & Wilson steam hammer stands in the campus of the University of Bolton. Steam hammers continue to be used for driving piles into the ground. Steam supplied by a circulating steam generator is more efficient than air. However, today compressed air is often used rather than steam. As of 2013 manufacturers continued to sell air/steam pile-driving hammers. Forging services suppliers also continue to use steam hammers of varying sizes based on classical designs.

The nervous system of gastropods consists of a series of paired ganglia connected by major nerve cords, and a number of smaller branching nerves. General layout of the gastropod ganglia. In most species, the brain is fused into a single, six-lobed, organ Buccal ganglia of Aplysia californica. Description The brain of a gastropod consists of three pairs of ganglia, all located close to the oesophagus and forming a nerve ring around it. In some primitive forms, these ganglia are relatively discrete, but in most species they have become so closely bound together as to effectively form separate lobes of a single structure. The cerebral ganglia are located above the oesophagus and supply nerves to the eyes, tentacles, and other sensory organs in the head. Beneath the oesophagus, at the forward part of the foot, lie the pedal ganglia. As their name implies, these supply nerves to the foot muscles. The third pair of ganglia within the brain lie slightly behind and below the cerebral ganglia. These are the pleural ganglia, and supply nerves to the mantle cavity. Bundles of nerves connect the cerebral, pedal, and pleural ganglia together, as well as running above and below the oesophagus to connect the right and left cerebral and pedal ganglia to each other. In most gastropods, a short pair of nerve cords passes forward from the cerebral ganglia to a pair of buccal ganglia located above the back of the mouth. These supply nerves to the radula and other parts of the mouth. Main nerve cords The main nerve cords of the central nervous system run through the length of the body from the pleural ganglia. In the ancestral gastropod, these would presumably have run down either side of the animal, but because of the torsion of the visceral mass found in many modern forms, they now cross over each other. However, a number of species have undergone de-torsion, restoring their original bilateral symmetry. A pair of parietal ganglia lie along the length of the main nerve cords, supplying nerves to the gill and associated olfactory organ. Because of the torsion of the nerve cords, one parietal ganglion is typically higher in the body than the other. Finally, the nerve cords terminate in a linked pair of visceral ganglia, which supply nerves to the remaining organs of the visceral mass. 2016 study A study, published in 2016 in Nature, has shown that in air-breathing freshwater snails of the genus Lymnaea Lamarck, 1799 goal-directed decision-making during the hunt for food is performed by just two neuron types. Through measuring the action potentials between neurons, the researchers found that just two neurons were able to come to a complicated form of decision making. One neuron in the brain tells the snail if food is nearby, the second neuron signals whether the snail is hungry or not. Such decision making helps the snail save energy by reducing complex brain activity when there is no food nearby and adapts its behavior in the absence of food. Thus the snail can switch between a low-use mode and a high-use mode depending on the decision. According to lead researcher Gy√∂rgy Kemenes, this could help engineers design more efficient \\"robot brains\\" in future.

Character history  Emmanuelle appeared as the nom de plume of Marayat Rollet-Andriane, a French-Thai actress born in the 1930s in Bangkok. Her 1957 book The Joys of a Woman detailed the sexual exploits of Emmanuelle, the \\"bored housewife\\" of a French diplomat. Rollet-Andriane's book caused a sensation in France and was banned. The producer of another Arsan/Rollet-Andriane film Laure, Ovidio Assonitis, claimed that all books published under the nom-de-plume Emmanuelle Arsan were written by her husband Louis-Jacques Rollet-Andriane rather than by Marayat.Interview with Ovidio Assonitis in the extras section of the Laure-DVD  Films  The first Emmanuelle film was the 1974 French theatrical feature Emmanuelle starring Dutch actress Sylvia Kristel (1952‚Äì2012) in the title role. She came to be the actress best identified with the role. This film pushed the boundaries of what was then acceptable on screen, with sex scenes, skinny-dipping, masturbation, the \\"Mile High Club\\", rape, and a scene in which a dancer lights a cigarette and puffs it with her vagina. This film was created and directed by French director Just Jaeckin. Unlike many films that tried to avoid an X-rating, the first Emmanuelle film embraced it, and became a success with a viewing audience estimated at 300 million.Hunting Emmanuelle, Firecracker Films (2006) (view clip) It remains one of France's most successful films, and played in the Arc de Triomphe theatre for over eleven years.Making of Emmanuelle DVD 2007 In France and the US the film was uncut, but British censors balked at masturbation and explicit sex. Heavy cuts were made to the film including the complete removal of the opium den rape and the infamous 'cigarette' sequence in the club. Several sequels starring Kristel followed, beginning with Emmanuelle 2 known as Emmanuelle: The Joys of a Woman in its U.S. release, and also Emmanuelle l‚Äôantivierge in some European press materials, including the soundtrack LP and CD. Kristel sold her interest for $150,000, missing on a share of the film's $26m domestic gross. She was paid $6,000 for her role but negotiated a $100,000 contract for the sequel, Emmanuelle 2. Kristel stepped away from the role in the 1980s, yielding to younger actresses, but returned for the seventh feature film. In 1992 and 1993, Kristel reprised the role of an older Emmanuelle for a series of made-for-cable films with titles such as Emmanuelle's Love and Emmanuelle's Perfume, which featured Marcela Walerstein as a younger version of Kristel's character. Kristel did not take part in any love scenes for this series, which also co-starred George Lazenby, also in a non-sexual role. Kristel also appeared in films throughout her career that capitalized on or parodied her Emmanuelle image, such as the American sex comedy Private Lessons. A number of unofficial productions in Italy, Japan and the United States cashed in on the Emmanuelle craze, changing the spelling of the title. In a number of cases, the character's name was spelled \\"Emanuelle\\" suggesting these films were not authorized. Among the best known were Italian \\"Black Emanuelle\\" films starring Laura Gemser, who became the second most popular actress to play Emanuelle in the 1970s. The 1978 spoof Carry On Emmannuelle (with double \\"N\\") starred Kenneth Williams as the French ambassador to London. Having lost his libido by landing on a church spire during a parachute jump, he discovers his sex-starved wife, Emmannuelle Prevert, has seduced a string of VIPs. It starred Suzanne Danielle in the title role. After the last official Emmanuelle theatrical feature film, Emmanuelle au 7√®me ciel (the seventh film for which Kristel returns as the main character), ASP began to produce further films, all featuring the character of Emmanuelle, albeit played by a series of actresses. These included a science fiction series in the 1990s called Emmanuelle in Space starring American actress Krista Allen in one of her first roles. Following spinoffs included TV series Emmanuelle 2000 starring Holly Sampson, TV and video series Emmanuelle's Private Collection starring Natasja Vermeer, and a one-off, Emmanuelle in Rio, starring Ludmilla Ferraz in her only acting credit. At the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, Alain Siritzky said he was looking for a new Emmanuelle, with production on the first film scheduled to begin in September. It was announced at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival that Allie Haze (performing under the alias Brittany Joy) had been chosen. The direct-to-video series that starred Allie Haze was titled Emmanuelle Through Time. The character of Emmanuelle is also featured in a video game of the same name, released by Coktel Vision in 1989. = Box office = The film played to packed houses in Paris, running for years. Emmanuelle was also an international hit and has played to 300 million. French distribution company Studio Canal has acquired home video rights for a number of Emmanuelle movies and has released remastered DVDs of the films. Taking video and DVD into account revenue is estimated close to 650 million. = Explicit content = The sexual explicitness in Emmanuelle films varies from arty softcore to full hardcore, although no penetration or oral sex made it to public versions. Many question the place of hardcore scenes in Emmanuelle and ASP never attempted to mix the two genres after experimenting in the late 1980s. * Emmanuelle 4 (1984), starring Kristel and new Emmanuelle Mia Nygren, had hardcore scenes shot, but they were never used. These scenes, which did not involve the main actors, were included in television versions and turned up as extras on European DVD editions of Emmanuelle 4 and in a version called \\"Emmanuelle 4X\\" on a VHS in France in the 1980s. * Emmanuelle 5 (1987), directed by Walerian Borowczyk, was released in two versions: one with softcore love scenes, and a French home video version that extended several scenes with hardcore sex directed by Borowczyk (apparently Borowczyk said that he had not directed them). The scenes are the Love Express and dance studio segments, embellished with penetration, ejaculation and a woman urinating. This VHS version omits several minutes of footage seen in the public version (including dialogue and plot). * Emmanuelle 6 (1988) also had two hardcore scenes (one short without ejaculation, but with fellatio and penetration, between a man and a woman whom Emmanuelle watches in a horse box, and the second longer, with fellatio, penetration and ejaculation, starring the same couple entering the place where Emmanuelle is being held prisoner at the end of the movie), directed by erotic horror specialist Jean Rollin.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. The building has been described as \\"the finest 17th-century timber-framed town house in Chester\\" and \\"one of the last of the great timber-framed town houses in England\\". It stands on the west side of Lower Bridge Street to the north of the Bridgegate. History The Bear and Billet in the 19th century, as painted by Louise Rayner. The house was built in 1664 as the town house of the Earls of Shrewsbury who held control of the nearby Bridgegate. It was also probably used as a grain warehouse because in the gable are double doors and a bracket for a hoist. The building became an inn in the 18th century, although it continued to be owned by the Shrewsbury family until 1867. Its name is taken from the heraldic device of the Earls that consist of a bear tied to a billet (or stake). Architecture The building is constructed in timber framing with plaster panels. It consists of cellars, above which are three storeys and an attic in the gable overlooking the street. The roof has purple slates and a ridge at right-angles to the street. Each storey is jettied above the storey below. On the ground floor are two doors, one to the south and the other placed more centrally. To the right of each door is a three-light window. At the base of the first floor are 16 rectangular timber framed plaster panels. Above these is a window stretching along the whole length of the frontage; it is divided into 32 lights separated by mullions and transoms and containing leaded lights. In the second floor storey are 12 arched timber framed panels. The window above these is similar to that in the first floor. Over this window is a row of 12 square decorated timber-framed panels. In the attic is a double timber door surrounded by panels. On each side of this door, and above it, are two-light windows containing leaded lights. In the apex of the gable is herringbone timber framing. The bargeboard is carved and has a finial at its peak.

The Priha (Blossom) Operations were a series of strikes undertaken by the Israeli Air Force during the War of Attrition. Taking place between January and April 1970, the operations consisted of 118The War of Attrition on the Israeli Air Force website. sorties against targets in the Egyptian heartland. The strikes were carried out almost exclusively by the F-4 Phantom II, operated at the time only by the 201 \\"The One\\" Squadron and the 69 \\"Hammers\\" Squadron. Although tactically successful, the operations failed to achieve their objective of pushing the Egyptian government to sue for a ceasefire. Background By the end of 1969 Israel had achieved aerial supremacy in its battle with Egyptian air defences along the Suez Canal. Israel, however, was incapable of translating its military achievements into diplomatic gains, and the war continued. To increase Egypt's cost of maintaining the war and compel it to seek a ceasefire, the Israeli government decided to take the war deeper inside Egyptian territory. These strikes were to take place within full view of the Egyptian public, as far as 100 miles from the Canal, with the expectation that mounting public pressure would force president Nasser to seek a ceasefire. The Operations * Priha 1, January 7 - Two 201 Squadron F-4 Phantom IIs strike an SA-2 operators' school near Helwan, while a 69 Squadron pair attacks Egyptian command posts near Cairo.January 1970 on the Israeli Air Force website. * Priha 2, January 13 - Four 115 Squadron A-4 Skyhawks attack an Egyptian army camp in the Delta region, another quartet strikes barracks near the City of Suez, two 109 Squadron A-4s attack barracks near Tall al Kabir, and two 201 Squadron Phantoms strike a signal camp. * Priha 3, January 18 - Two 201 Squadron Phantoms strike an ammunition factory at Jebel Huf, north of Helwan, while a 69 Squadron pair strikes an ammunition dump 10 km west of Cairo. * Priha 4, January 23 - Two 201 Squadron Phantoms strike an ammunition dump 10 km west of Cairo, the same one struck five days earlier. * Priha 5, January 28 - Two Phantom pairs, one from each F-4 squadron (69 & 201) strike missile bases at Dahshur, south of Cairo. Another 69 Squadron pair attacks an army base 5 km south east of Cairo. * Priha 6, February 2 - A pair of Phantoms from 201 Squadron attack Egyptian army bases near Asyut, in upper Egypt.February 1970 on the Israeli Air Force website. Several MiGs are scrambled to intercept the Israeli raiders but are too far away to intervene. A 69 Squadron pair attack a P-12 radar station at Baltim. * Priha 7, February 6 - Two 201 Squadron Phantoms strike barracks near Gandela, upper Egypt. A 69 Squadron pair returns to Tall al Kabir in the Delta region. * Priha 8, February 8 - Two 69 Squadron Phantoms strike a naval commando base while a 201 pair attacks army warehouses near Helwan. Egyptian Air Force MiG-21s are scrambled from nearby Inshas, and in the ensuing dogfight two are shot down - one by an F-4 and another by a 119 Squadron Mirage III scrambled to the scene. * Priha 9, February 12 - 201 Squadron Phantoms attack Egyptian radar facilities at Jebel Obeid, while a 69 Squadron pair is sent to attack army bases at Hanca. Mistaken identification of the target results in the bombing of a metal foundry at Abu Zabel and the killing of 70 Egyptian workers. Israeli defence minister Moshe Dayan informs Egyptian authorities, through the Red Cross, of a delayed detonation bomb at the site, and the Israeli government prohibits strikes against targets within a range of 20 km from the center of Cairo. Later in the day, two 201 Squadron F-4s strike army bases at Dahshur again, while a 69 Squadron pair destroys a radar facility at Abu Suweir. * Priha 10, February 17 - two 201 Squadron F-4s strike an SA-2 battery near Dahshur. * Priha 11, February 26 - two 201 Squadron Phantoms strike an SA-2 battery and training facility near the air base at Cairo-West. MiG-21s are scrambled to intercept the raiders but break off when Israeli Mirages arrive on the scene. Later that same day two 69 Squadron F-4s attack another SAM battery in the delta, and are once again challenged by Egyptian MiGs. The attacking pair are withdrawn, but a 201 pair and four 119 Squadron Mirages on patrol are directed against the Egyptian interceptors. Three MiGs are downed by the Mirages for no loss, though Egypt claims the destruction of three Israeli aircraft. * Priha 12, March 6 - Four Phantoms, two from each F-4 squadron, strike an SA-2 battery near El Mansourah and a radar facility near Domyat. * Priha 13, March 13 - Two 201 Squadron F-4s attack a radar facility at Ras Obeid. * Priha 14, March 17/18 - strikes by both squadrons against targets at Tall el Kabir and Helwan are called off. * Priha 15, March 23 - A radar facility at Baltim is struck by two 69 Squadron Phantoms. * Priha 16, March 26 - Two 69 Squadron F-4s attack a SAM site at Qassasin. * Priha 17, March 31 - Four 201 Squadron F-4s joined by a single 69 Squadron bird attack SAM sites near El Mansourah. * Priha 18, April 3 - Four 69 Squadron Phantoms strike SAM sites near El Mansourah again. * Priha 19, April 8 - Four 201 Squadron Phantoms bombed a primary school near Bahr el Baqar, killing 47 children. Israel said the target was an Egyptian army headquarters.March - April 1970 on the Israeli Air Force website. * Priha 20, April 10 - Originally intended to be a part of Priha 19, two 201 Squadron Phantoms attack a radar facility at Wadi Zur. * Priha 21, April 13 - An SA-2 base near Manzala is struck by a 69 Squadron pair, while two 201 Squadron birds strike at a radar facility near Wadi Zur. Aftermath The expanding Soviet presence in Egypt and the increased likelihood of a confrontation with Soviet forces prompted the Israeli government to call off the Priha operations. Despite inflicting considerable damage on Egypt,The War of Attrition 1969-1970 acig.org the bombing campaign only brought the Egyptian public together behind their government. Instead of bringing Egypt to the negotiating table, it had quite the opposite effect. Humiliated and angry, Nasser turned to Moscow for additional support and weapons, drawing the Soviet Union further into the conflict. Instead of facilitating a ceasefire, the Priha operations in fact increased tensions and led to further escalation in the War of Attrition. In his memoirs, Yitzhak Rabin, at the time Israel's Ambassador to the U.S., reports that he urged the Israeli government to initiate Operation Priha and credits the strikes inside Egypt with fortifying the United States in their negotiations with the Soviets. He writes, \\"From then on, the American Administration was gradually to shake free of the depressing feeling that it was backing the loser in the Middle East\\".

Biology Close-up It is a long-lived and slow-growing species which reaches maturity at 8‚Äì9 years, and the oldest recorded individual is 56. These fishes are carnivorous, mostly feeding on other fishes, crustaceans and molluscs. Adult snappers often form large schools on the outer reefs or above sandy areas, mainly to form spawning aggregations. Small brownish juveniles mimic damselfishes of the genus Chromis in order to approach their preys. Two chambered nautiluses feeding on a two- spot red snapper. The chambered nautilus, Nautilus pompilius, is known to scavenge deceased snappers.

These features include a tall, thin stature and long, slender limbs. LFS is also associated with psychopathology and behavioral abnormalities, and it exhibits a number of malformations affecting the brain and heart. The disorder is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner, and is attributed to a missense mutation in the MED12 gene. There is currently no treatment or therapy for the underlying MED12 malfunction, and the exact cause of the disorder remains unclear.  Signs and symptoms  Intellectual disability in LFS usually ranges from mild to moderate, but severe cases have also been reported. A relatively common brain anomaly seen with LFS is agenesis of the corpus callosum, an error of embryonic development in which the corpus callosum (a structure of the mammalian brain composed of nerves that allows communication between the left and right cerebral hemispheres) is not present. Among a number of adverse neurological effects sometimes found with an absence of the corpus callosum, intellectual disability has been shown to occur at a rate of approximately 73 percent. A correlation between agenesis of the corpus callosum and intellectual disability in LFS, however, has not been suggested. =Psychiatric= Psychopathology and related behavioral abnormalities are typically seen in LFS, and they may be considered in the diagnosis of the disorder. The most common of these in LFS is an autism-like spectrum disorder, and LFS is considered as one of a number of genetic disorders associated with autism. Additional alterations of psychopathology with behavioral manifestations that have been observed in LFS include: psychotic behavior, schizophrenia, hyperactivity and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, aggression, oppositional defiant disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, extreme shyness, learning disability, cognitive impairment, short-term memory deficit, low frustration tolerance, social dysfunction, lack of impulse control, eating disorder and associated malnutrition, attributed to psychogenic loss of appetite; and pyromania. While psychiatric conditions like these are to be expected with LFS, there have also been cases of the disorder with some preservation of mental and behavioral abilities, such as problem solving, reasoning and normal intelligence. The psychopathology of LFS usually exhibits schizophrenia. When schizophrenia is diagnosed in an individual known to be affected by intellectual disability, LFS may be considered in the differential diagnosis of schizophrenia, with confirmation of cause through appropriate psychiatric and genetic evaluation methods. =Marfanoid habitus= LFS is clinically distinguished from other X-linked forms of intellectual disability by the accompanying presence of marfanoid habitus. Marfanoid habitus describes a group of physical features common to Marfan syndrome. Including Marfan syndrome and LFS, marfanoid features of this type have also been observed with several other disorders, one of which is multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. In LFS, specific features identified as marfanoid include: a long, narrow face; tall, thin stature; long, slender limbs, fingers and toes (not unlike arachnodactyly) with joint hyperextensibility, shortened halluces (the big toes) and long second toes. The diagnosis of marfanoid habitus in LFS is often delayed because many of the physical features and characteristics associated with it are usually not evident until adolescence. = Head and face = Craniofacial and other features of LFS include: maxillary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the upper jaw bone), a small mandible (lower jaw bone) and receding chin, a high-arched palate (the roof of the mouth), with crowding and misalignment of the upper teeth; macrocephaly (enlarged skull) with a prominent forehead, hypernasal speech (voice), a long nose with a high, narrow nasal bridge; a deep, short philtrum (the indentation in the upper lip, beneath the nose), low-set ears with some apparent retroversion, hypotonia (decreased muscle tone), pectus excavatum (a malformity of the chest), slightly enlarged to normal testicular size in males, and seizures. Hypernasal speech, or \\"hypernasality\\", is primarily the result of velopharyngeal insufficiency, a sometimes congenital aberration in which the velopharyngeal sphincter allows too much air into the nasal cavity during speech. In LFS, hypernasality may also be caused by failure of the soft palate and uvula to reach the back wall of the pharynx (the interior cavity of the throat where swallowing generally occurs) during speech, a condition that can be associated with a submucosal cleft palate. = Heart = A number of features involving the heart have been noted in several LFS cases, the most significant being dilation of the aortic root, a section of the ascending aorta. Aortic root dilation (enlargement) is associated with a greatly increased risk of dissection of the aortic wall, resulting in aortic aneurysm. As this presents a possible life-threatening consequence of LFS, routine cardiac evaluation methods such as echocardiogram are implemented when the disorder is first diagnosed, along with MRI scans of the brain to screen for suspected agenesis of the corpus callosum. Additional effects on the heart that have been reported with LFS are ventricular and atrial septal defect.  Cause  A missense mutation in the MED12 gene, located on the human X chromosome, has been established as the cause of LFS. Missense mutations are genetic point mutations in which a single nucleotide in the genetic sequence is exchanged with another one. This leads to an erroneously substitution of a particular amino acid in the protein sequence during translation. The missense mutation in the MED12 gene, that causes LFS, is identified as p.N1007S. This indicates that the amino acid asparagine, normally located at position 1007 along the MED12 sequence, has been mistakenly replaced by serine. This mutation in MED12 causes incorrect expression and activity of the protein it encodes, resulting in the disorder.  Pathophysiology  Known genes and mutations found on the human X chromosome. The MED12 gene is found at location q13, highlighted in green. MED12, or mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription, subunit 12 homolog of S. cerevisiae, is one of several subunits in the mammalian mediator complex, which regulates RNA polymerase II during mRNA transcription. The Mediator complex is required for polymerase II transcription and acts as a bridge between the polymerase II enzyme and different gene-specific transcription factors. Mediator can contain up to 30 subunits, but some of the subunits are only required for regulation of transcription in particular tissues or cells. Currently, the exact mechanism by which dysfunction of MED12 results in LFS and its associated neuropsychopathic and physical characteristics is unclear. Marfanoid habitus, a highly arched palate and several other features of LFS can be found with Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder. The finding of aortic root dilation in both disorders suggests that a mutation in an unspecified connective tissue regulating gene may contribute to the etiology of LFS. A number of interesting experimental results have been obtained by studying MED12 mutations in the zebrafish, an animal model representing vertebrates. In zebrafish, a mutation in MED12 was found to be responsible for the mutant motionless (mot). Zebrafish with the mot mutation have neuronal and cardiovascular defects, although not all types of neurons are affected. Introduction of human MED12 mRNA into the zebrafish restores normal development. MED12 is also a critical coactivator for the gene SOX9, which is involved in the developmental regulation of neurons, cartilage and bone. In the zebrafish, MED12 defects cause maldevelopment of vertebrate embryonic structures such as the neural crest, which would alter function of the autonomic and peripheral nervous systems; and they also cause malformations of cell types serving as precursors to cartilage and bone, such as osteocytes. Some features found in LFS, like agenesis of the corpus callosum and cartilage-related craniofacial anomalies, are similar to defects found in zebrafish with MED12 and associated mutations. = Genetics = This condition is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. Lujan‚ÄìFryns syndrome is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder (MED12) is located on the X chromosome, and only one copy of the defective gene is sufficient to cause the disorder when inherited from a parent who has the disorder. Males are normally hemizygous for the X chromosome, having only one copy. As a result, X-linked dominant disorders usually show higher expressivity in males than females. This phenomenon is thought to occur with LFS. As the X chromosome is one of the sex chromosomes (the other being the Y chromosome), X-linked inheritance is determined by the gender of the parent carrying a specific gene and can often seem complex. This is because, typically, females have two copies of the X-chromosome, while males have only one copy. The difference between dominant and recessive inheritance patterns also plays a role in determining the chances of a child inheriting an X-linked disorder from their parentage. In LFS, X-linked dominant inheritance was suspected, as boy and girl siblings in one family both exhibited the disorder. A scenario such as this would also be possible with X-linked recessive inheritance, but in this particular case report, the girl was believed to be a manifesting heterozygote carrying one copy of the mutated gene. Sporadic cases of LFS, where the disorder is present in an individual with no prior family history of it, have also been reported in a small number of affected males. = Similarities to other genetic diseases = An individual exhibiting intellectual disability and other symptoms similar to LFS was found to have a terminal deletion of the subtelomeric region in the short arm of chromosome 5. Deletion of this area of chromosome 5 is associated with intellectual disability, psychotic behavior, autism, macrocephaly and hypernasal-like speech, as well as the disorder Cri du chat syndrome. Fryns (2006) suggests a detailed examination of chromosome 5 with FISH should be performed as part of the differential diagnosis of LFS. Mutations in the UPF3B gene, also found on the X chromosome, are another cause of X-linked intellectual disability. UPF3B is part of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) complex, which performs mRNA surveillance, detecting mRNA sequences that have been erroneously truncated (shortened) by the presence of nonsense mutations. Mutations in UPF3B alter and prevent normal function of the NMD pathway, resulting in translation and expression of truncated mRNA sequences into malfunctioning proteins that can be associated with developmental errors and intellectual disability. Individuals from two families diagnosed with LFS and one family with FGS were found to have mutations in UPF3B, confirming that the clinical presentations of the different mutations can overlap.  Diagnosis  Although LFS is usually suspected when intellectual disability and marfanoid habitus are observed together in a patient, the diagnosis of LFS can be confirmed by the presence of the p.N1007S missense mutation in the MED12 gene. =Differential diagnosis= In the differential diagnosis of LFS, another disorder that exhibits some features and symptoms of LFS and is also associated with a missense mutation of MED12 is Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome (FGS). Common features shared by both LFS and FGS include X-linked intellectual disability, hyperactivity, macrocephaly, corpus callosum agenesis and hypotonia. Notable features of FGS that have not been reported with LFS include excessive talkativness, consistent strength in socialization skills, imperforate anus (occlusion of the anus) and ocular hypertelorism (extremely wide-set eyes). Whereas LFS is associated with missense mutation p.N1007S, FGS is associated with missense mutation p.R961W. As both disorders originate from an identical type of mutation in the same gene, while exhibiting similar, yet distinct characteristics; LFS and FGS are considered to be allelic. In the context of MED12, this suggests that the phenotype of each disorder is related to the way in which their respective mutations alter the MED12 sequence and its function.  Treatment  While there is no specific treatment for the underlying genetic cause of LFS, corrective procedures, preventive intervention measures, and therapies may be considered in the treatment and management of the many craniofacial, orthopedic, and psychiatric problems associated with the disorder. More pressing issues such as cardiac involvement or epileptic seizures should be routinely examined and monitored. Close attention and specialized follow-up care, including neuropshycological evaluation methods and therapies, and special education, should be given to diagnose and prevent psychiatric disorders and related behavioral problems such as psychosis and outbursts of aggression.  Epidemiology  Lujan‚ÄìFryns syndrome is a rare X-linked dominant syndrome and is more common in males than females. Its prevalence within the general population has not yet been determined.  History  Lujan‚ÄìFryns syndrome is named after physicians J. Enrique Lujan and Jean-Pierre Fryns. The initial observation of suspected X-linked intellectual disability with Marfanoid features and craniofacial effects such as a high-arched palate was described by Lujan et al. in 1984. In the report, four affected male members of a large kindred (consanguinous family) were noted. Additional investigations of combined X-linked intellectual disability and Marfanoid habitus in other families, including two brothers, were reported by Fryns et al., beginning in 1987. The disorder soon became known as Lujan‚ÄìFryns syndrome.

The Estonian Chief of the General Staff, Nikolai Reek is second from the right. Finnish‚ÄìEstonian defence co- operation began in 1930 with a secret military pact between Finland and Estonia against the threat of the Soviet Union. Open co-operation ended in 1939, as the Soviets pressured the Estonian government, but it continued secretly with information-sharing during the Winter War.  Background  President of Finland Pehr Evind Svinhufvud (left) and President of Estonia Konstantin P√§ts (middle) in the city of Narva in 1936. State visits were scheduled every year. The most important negotiating issue was military co- operation. The origins of defence co-operation lay in the Baltic Entente of the 1920s. Practical co-operation began with the initiative of the Finnish general staff in February 1930 in Tallinn and the first joint war games were held in 1933. Officially, both countries were neutral, but behind the scenes, the relationship was more complex. Nazi Germany, for example, unsuccessfully offered Estonia a secret military alliance in 1937. Finland started co- operation only for its own defensive reasons though both countries speak Finnic languages and are neighbours. There were defence plans involving Finland launching a massive assault against Leningrad if the Soviet Union started a war against both countries. However, the plan would also have required the participation of Latvia, and according to the Finnish military leader, Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, the countries would have needed outside help from the League of Nations. Finland could not send troops directly to the Baltic countries, but a joint assault would have been possible through the Karelian Isthmus and/or from Poland.  Gulf of Finland blockade plan  Before the 1930s, defence co-operation between Finland, Poland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia was based on the Edge State Policy. In the 1930s, co- operation decreased, as Finland and Estonia started practical military dialogue. Both the Finnish policy of neutrality and the official trend in the Nordic countries kept the co-operation pact secret. The Nordic trend did not officially allow Swedish participation in managing the security of the Gulf of Finland. However, behind the scenes, the general staffs of Sweden and Finland had secretly negotiated a plan in 1929 to blockade the Gulf. Sweden agreed that it would first suggest the blockade plan to Estonia in 1930. Officially, Sweden would not participate in co-operation, but it would supply materiel and auxiliary troops if the Soviet Union attacked.  Coastal artillery  Practical measures by Finland and Estonia were based upon Peter the Great's Naval Fortress system, allowing surface ships and coastal artillery fire to prevent possible movements of the Soviet Baltic Fleet. After the Imperial Russian Baltic fleet was mostly destroyed in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, Russia sought to replace the loss of fleet vessels from 1912 onwards by reinforcing the coastal artillery on the shores of the Gulf of Finland. The aim was to build a barrage against the German fleet's potential intrusion along the Gulf to Saint Petersburg, then capital of Russia. Coastal arrays of 12-inch naval guns were installed on both sides of the Gulf. The defence co- operation aimed to prevent access by Soviet vessels through the Gulf to Helsinki and Tallinn using mines, coastal artillery fire and submarines. As a result, Finland redeveloped its heavy coastal artillery and fortresses, adapting 305 mm shells to give them greater range, thus providing complete artillery coverage between M√§kiluoto in Finland and Naissaar in Estonia. The first joint military exercise was held in 1936.  Submarines  Kalev and Lembit were both manufactured in the United Kingdom and began their service in spring 1937. The joint deployment of submarines was a part of the Gulf blockade plan. The Estonian submarine programme was expensive; the Estonian Navy even had to sell two destroyers in 1933 to be able to finance the two new submarines it launched in 1937. Estonian submarines installed the same kind of torpedoes and mines as their Finnish counterparts, and Estonian naval officers were trained in Finnish submarines.  Radio intelligence and the Winter War  During the Winter War, Estonia was formally neutral, but it had to allow the Soviet Union to establish military bases and station troops on its soil. From the military bases, the Soviet Union carried out bombing raids on Finland. As part of the coastal artillery co-operation, the countries had a common fire management system linked by an undersea radio cable. The Estonians had earlier managed to decipher the Soviet secret radio code, and they had access to military radio communications. During the Winter War, Estonian military staff gave the Finns top secret information on Soviet troop movements.  Aftermath  The Finnish‚ÄìEstonian defence pact remained secret for decades and did not come to light until the Estonian and Russian archives were opened in the 1990s. Finnish archives on the matter had been transported outside the country or destroyed after the Continuation War.

Used as a cultural marker of an individual's accomplishments, Ikegobo are dedicated to the hand, from which the people of Benin considered the will for wealth and success to originate. These commemorative objects are made of wood or brass with figures carved in relief around their sides. Ikegobo, like the royal ancestral altars, are settings for spectacular examples of Benin art. The cult of the Hand in Nigeria The cult of the Hand is based on the belief that a man's right hand or arm embodies his capacity for accomplishment. The cult focuses on a man's skill with tools, his economic effectiveness, and his ability to win physical contests. The Hand will also protect him and his household from attacks by malevolent spirits or human enemies. In Benin culture, the hand is worshiped primarily by those who have already achieved outstanding success or wealth. The Benin kings and chiefs have worshiped the hand since the time of Oba Ewuare, the fifteenth-century warrior king. The wars of expansion that Ewuare waged and won not only gave him the impetus to become a devotee of the hand, but may have also exposed him to other areas of southern Nigeria where hand worship was practiced. Design and materials Wooden altars to the hand are owned by Benin chiefs. The Oba, queen mother, and certain other privileged chiefs have the right to own cast brass ikegobo. The cylindrical form refers to a type of round, legless stool commonly used by the Edo in the past. The altar is placed on an altar stand, a semicircular platform whose straight edge is extended at both sides, which is carved on its top and sides with figures and other motifs in relief. A wooden spoke at the top of the altar supports an ivory tusk. Altars were placed in the second public room of the house of traditional chiefs, on top of a polished and whitened mud platform.

Albania In the 15th century Pope Pius II, admiring Ottoman‚ÄìAlbanian Wars, waged mainly by Skanderbeg defined Albania as Italy's bastion of Christianity (). The pope himself declared the war to the Ottoman Empire in 1463, but such war was never fought, as the following year he died at Ancona, while still organizing the naval attack on the Ottomans. Armenia Armenia, especially the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, has been described as the last Christian bulwark in Asia to fall to Muslim rule. Croatia Ferdo Quiquerez, Antemurale Christianitatis (1892)-Croatia is portrayed in a form of a woman that holds a sword and a shield in the form of the Croatian coat of Arms. She stands at the entrance of Europe and guards it from the Turks. Behind her the Dome of St. Peter's Basilical and, among others, Galileo Galilei and Dante Alighieri can be seen. Pope Leo X called Croatia the Antemurale Christianitatis () in 1519 in a letter to the Croatian ban Petar Berislaviƒá, given that Croatian soldiers made significant contributions in war against the Ottoman Empire. The advancement of the Ottoman Empire in Europe was stopped in 1593 on Croatian soil (Battle of Sisak), which could be in this sense regarded as a historical gate of European civilization. Nevertheless, the Muslim Ottoman Empire occupied part of Croatia from the 15th to the 19th centuries.. However, Pope Leo X wasn't the first that gave Croatia such a title. The nobility of the southern Croatian regions sent a letter to Pope Alexander VI and Roman-German emperor Maximilian I on April 10, 1494 seeking help against the Ottoman attacks. In that letter Croatia was for the first time called bastion and a bulwark of Christianity: > When Turks conquered Constantinople in 1453, Pope Callistus III urged all > Christians to the Crusades. Many Croats, led by Saint John of Capistrano, > were part of the army that defeated 150,000 Turks at the Siege of Belgrade > in 1456.

The wines have been well received in the Australian wine press, listed in James Halliday's 2010 Australian Wine Companion in the Top 10 Best New Wineries in AustraliaJancis Robinson, New brooms in Burgundy 'Western Australian answers to red and white burgundy', 31 January 2009 and judged as Australia's top Chardonnay of Australia in 2010. MadFish Wines upright Howard Park Wines first released the MadFish label in 1992 with the MadFish Premium White, soon followed by the MadFish Premium Red in 1993. The name Madfish is derived from a local seaside inlet based 15 kilometres from the town of Denmark called Madfish Bay, so called because of often seen desperately jumping fish, seeking to escape hungry feeding dolphins whilst the bay's calmness is broken when two tides meet. The artwork for the label was originally designed by the late Maxine Fumagalli, a Noongar artist from Western Australia's Great Southern. Awarded a Double Gold Medal and listed as one of the top four label designs in the International San Francisco Wine Competition. Her design reflects the native viewpoint of unity between land, sea, stars, animals and people, hence the inclusion of all these elements in the label's design. This traditional aboriginal water turtle design on the label is a symbol of perseverance and tolerance. Since its release the label has grown into one of Australia's most recognized wine brands, with an extensive range of contemporary style wines made from cool climate fruit.\\"Maxine Fumagalli\\" The Australian Literature ResourceSowelu, Daniel 2001, 'Maxine Fumagalli', Nova: Keeping Body and Soul Together 8(5): 28.Maxine Fumagalli, Southwest Noongar Woman, Denmark Environment Centre 1992 Architecture thumb The Margaret River winery has received acclaim for its architecture winning the commercial category award from the Royal Australian Institute of Architects in 2000,Stuart George, 'A Chinese Rabbit in Margaret River', The world of fine wine, Quarto Magazines, Issue 5 2005, pp. 60‚Äì65 also judged among Australia's top 12 buildings,Elizabeth Farrelly, MIT Press (31 March 2008)Elizabeth Farrelly, 'Australia's top 12 buildings', Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, 18 June 2005Allen Jack + Cottier: Architecture in the Australian Context, Watermark Press (4 August 2006)Davina Jackson, Next Wave: New Australian Architecture, Princeton Architectural Press; 1 edition (24 January 2008) incorporating traditional feng shui principles with contemporary Australian design.

The name was chosen so that it was apparent to all concerned that someone highly regarded in the field was fostering young Australian authors and illustrators for children. The award is a mounted silver medallion designed by the first winner of the award, the Australian Aboriginal writer/illustrator Arone Raymond Meeks. From 1994 - 2008 this biennial award was presented during the congress of the Australian Library and Information Association (ALIA). In 2010, the award will be presented at an independent IBBY Australia function. Only books by Australian creators published in the two years prior to the particular closing date can be nominated by the publishers for the Ena No√´l award. Secondly, the nominated creator must be under the age of 35 at the time the title (or titles) for which they are nominated was published. Thirdly, any nominated author or illustrator has to be deemed by the judges to be worthy of encouragement. The award winners: * 1994 Arone Raymond Meeks, won for his third picturebook, Enora and the Black Crane (1991) * 1996 Sonya Hartnett, won for Wilful Blue (1994) * 1997 Steve Woolman, won a special award for his body of work * 1998 Tohby Riddle, for The Tip at the End of the Street (1996) * 2000 Catherine Jinks for Piggy in the Middle (1998) * 2002 Beth Norling, for Cherryblossom and the Golden Bear (2000) * 2004 Alyssa Brugman, for Walking Naked * 2006 Anthony Eaton, for Fireshadow and The girl in the cave * 2008 Markus Zusak for The Book Thief * 2010 Lili Wilkinson for Scatterheart * 2012 Amy Barker for Omega Park * 2014 Melissa Keil for Life in Outer Space * 2016 Kate Gordon for Writing Clementine * 2018 Will Kostakis for The Sidekicks * 2020 Jack Heath for 500 Minutes of Danger References Hans Christian Andersen Awards IBBY.

Illerup √Ödal (English: Illerup River-valley) is a river valley and archeological site located near Skanderborg in East Jutland, Denmark.  Archaeological discoveries  An artists view of a votive offering taking place in Illerup √Ödal. Some of the excavated weapons (axes) can be glimpsed in the exhibition case on the right. From a former exhibition at Moesg√•rd Museum. According to Forte, Oram, and Pedersen, \\"The Illerup √Ödal site is one of twenty-five in Denmark and southern Sweden where weapons were sacrificed.\\" The sites include eastern Jylland, Fyn, Lolland, Sjaelland, and Bornholm in Denmark, plus Gotland and Smaland in Sweden. The oldest deposit in Illerup √Ödal contained 300 spear points with the name Wagnijo written in runes, plus shields, belts, and scabbards. In addition, about 129 tinderboxes, and 124 combs were unearthed. The first archaeological findings at the river valley of Illerup √Ödal were revealed in 1950, during some drainage work. The area was subsequently excavated from 1950 till 1956 and again from 1975 to 1985. During the excavations more than 15,000 items, mainly Iron Age weapons and personal equipment from 200 to 500 AD, were found. It is generally agreed that the findings are enemy equipment captured after victories, and then thrown into the lake, as a votive offering to the gods. Illerup √Ödal is one of twenty-five sites in Denmark and Southern Sweden where sacrificed weapons have been found. Archeological excavations also produced some findings bearing the Elder Futhark runic inscriptions from the earliest period. To ensure preservation of the area, which still holds many findings, the location was granted protected status in 1996. = Alken Enge = The wet meadows of Alken Enge (Alken Meadows), forms the lower part of the short river valley of Illerup √Ödal. The Alken Enge wetlands are located near Lake Moss√∏ at Skanderborg and they are the site of a recent massive archaeological excavation. The skeletal remains of hundreds of Iron Age warriors were found in 2008 and 2009, during a large scale archaeological excavation carried out as project work by students of Aarhus University in what was likely a lake bed when the remains were placed there about 2,000 years ago. The area covers 40 ha and although the events behind the macabre scene are unclear at the moment, many of the dead are believed to be warriors, maybe sacrificed prisoners of the wars at the time. The finds in Alken Enge predates the former Illerup √Ödal find, but are also from the Nordic Iron Age. Excavation Project Manager Mads K√§hler Holst, professor of archaeology at Aarhus University, has been quoted as saying of finding the remains of a violent conflict at the 40 hectare site: \\"It's clear that this must have been a quite far-reaching and dramatic event, that must have had profound effect on the society of the time. The dig has produced a large quantity of skeletal remains, and we believe that they will give us the answers to some of our questions about what kind of events led up to the army ending up here.\\"Macabre finds in the bog at Alken Enge EurekAlert!

He is the son of Ernesto Vita, who was the owner of the hapless Life Formula One team, which failed to pre-qualify on all fourteen attempts in . Career=Karting= Kouzkin made his debut in karting, in 2005 in the Italian Intercontinental A Junior Championship. He finished 28th in the championship, with two points. 2006 was a stellar year for Kouzkin, as he won the Bridgestone ICA Junior Cup, the 100cc Junior Champion Cup, and also the 100cc Torneo Industrie. There was disappointment though, as he finished 27th in the European Championship, which was won by current Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0 racer Miquel Monr√°s. 2007 saw a move up into both the KF2 and KF3 classes. In KF2, Kouzkin finished third in the Champions Cup, and also finished eleventh in the Bridgestone Cup. He continued that success in KF3, when he finished runner-up to Matteo Vigan√≤ in the WSK International Series. Third place in the South Garda Winter Cup and joint-eighth in the Italian Open Masters suggested that Kouzkin was ready to step up a further class on the karting ladder. After poor performances in the 2008 KF2 Torneo Industrie and the KZ2 European Championship, Kouzkin completed his karting career in the KF1 class. With the Fausto Franchini team, he finished tenth in the South Garda Winter Cup and eleventh in the Andrea Margutti Trophy, before stepping up to single seaters. =Formula Renault= Kouzkin joined the Cram Competition team in 2008, to compete in both the Formula Renault 2.0 Italia and the Formule Renault 2.0 Suisse championships. In the Swiss championship, he finished sixth overall, winning races at Magny-Cours and Monza. He wasn't so successful in the Italian series, winding up fourteenth in the championship. =International Formula Master= In 2009, Alessandro debuted in International Formula Master, continuing with Cram Competition. At the opening round of the season, Kouzkin won the second race on the streets of Pau. Kouzkin added a second win at Brands Hatch, taking a lights-to-flag victory from pole position, in the second race.

They were first described by institutional economists Gardiner Means and Adolf A. Berle in their 1932 book The Modern Corporation and Private Property. As Means argued in 1972, \\"Basically, the administered-price thesis holds that a large body of industrial prices do not behave in the fashion that classical theory would lead one to expect. It was first developed in 1934‚Äì35 to apply to the cyclical behavior of industrial prices. It specifically held that in business recessions administered prices showed a tendency not to fall as much as market prices while the recession fall in demand worked itself out primarily through a fall in sales, production, and employment.\\" Empirical data Since Means and Berle's pioneering work in the 1930s, numerous empirical surveys have been carried out to understand the role of administered prices in national economies. Surveys conducted in the 1980s found that 70‚Äì85% of American industrial prices were markup or cost-added prices.Govindarajan, V. and R.

MP4 watches typically require the user to convert video files to smaller resolution or particular file formats before they can be played back.http://www.moviecodec.com/topics/22228p1.html This led to the development of \\"MP5\\" watches that could play all the popular video file formats natively.

Development The first commercially available MP4 watch available to consumers in America was one manufactured by the Chinese electronics manufacturer Shenzhen Adragon Digitek in September 2006 and the now discontinued Aigo F209.

Both sites are in the Diocese of Portland. The Lewiston campus is for grades Pre-K to 5 while the Auburn campus is for Grades 6 to 12. History Maine‚Äôs Lewiston-Auburn region is rich with Franco-American history, and families that immigrated to the area for opportunities that the textile mills and shoe shops along the Androscoggin River offered. In 1881 those families united to open the first Catholic schools in the Lewiston-Auburn area. With the growing Franco-American population, more Catholic schools opened until nearly every parish supported its own elementary school.History of St. Dom's RHS, St. Dominic's RHS website. In 1941, those parishes united to found St. Dominic High School. The first construction undertaken was the St. Dominic Arena. It was reasoned that the profits from the arena would help finance the new St. Dominic High School. The community responded with contributions of land, heavy machinery, and manpower. At the same time, Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul (Lewiston, Maine) Parish began what became known as \\"La Marche des Dix Sous,\\" a parish collection that went to the St. Dom's Fund. This collection went on for fifteen years under the sponsorship of the Holy Name Society of the parish. This feat was accomplished by the community in order to obtain their Catholic high school.History of St. Dom's RHS, St. Dominic's RHS website. In the late 1990s, parishioner numbers began dwindling due to many factors that included area out migration. Due to the loss of the two major industries, parish elementary schools began to consolidate. Eleven original parish schools consolidated into four. Then in 2006, in an effort to maximize educational resources, a decision was made to consolidate all of the parish elementary schools which formed Trinity Catholic School. In the year 2000, Bishop Joseph Gerry made the decision to build a new high school facility in the city of Auburn on 72 acres of land donated by the Schiavi Family. The Libra Foundation was one of the many benefactors who made this project a reality and in January 2002 the new building opened. Throughout these consolidations our school families have responded with grace and support. And in 2010, the consolidation was completed in the formation of Saint Dominic Academy that merged Trinity Catholic Elementary School and St. Dominic Regional High School. The elementary campus in Lewiston houses grades pre-school through 6 and the junior/senior high school campus in Auburn houses grades 7 through 12. The total enrollment the combined school stands at 600. Sports St. Dom's has a rich hockey history. The Dominican pastor Rev. Herve Drouin, O.P., founded the school as an educational institution for adolescent hockey players. Today, several other varsity and junior varsity teams make up the athletic program at the school. Fall sports include: Boys and Girls Cross Country Running, Field Hockey, Boys and Girls Golf, Boys and Girls Soccer. Winter sports include: Boys and Girls Basketball, Cheerleading, Boys and Girls Indoor Track, Boys and Girls Hockey, Boys and Girls Swimming. Spring sports include: Baseball, Boys and Girls Lacrosse, Boys and Girls Track, Boys and Girls Tennis, and Softball.

Mathematical models of choice behavior. A model for neutral elements (1959a, b) provided a way to represent noise elements in the Estes and Burke (1953) choice theory. A recruitment model for choice behavior (1962, 1994) assumes that processing a stimulus involves the recruiting (or accumulation) of elements by alternative response counters until a criterion number is reached and the corresponding response is evoked. 2\\\\. Early experiments of attention in response time experiments. Stimulus processing is biased by relative frequency of presentation (1964), by incentive value (1967), and by inserting an informative cue into a trial (1970). 3\\\\. Studies of automaticity.

Development of a test for preparatory attention to location (2000) with Eric Sieroff, and tests of patients (2004, 2005). 8\\\\. Development of a cortex-wide circuit theory of attention: The Triangular Circuit of Attention, (1995, 1997). 9\\\\. Development of an apical dendrite theory of cognition, attention, and consciousness. A series of papers explored the hypothesis that the apical dendrite is not \\"just another dendrite\\" but has its own special functions (2001, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007). The hypothesis that the apical dendrite resonates was illustrated informally by LaBerge and his daughter, Anne La Berge in three performances of a work entitled Resonant Dendrites, (2006, 2007, 2009), which featured film, narrative voice samples and music. A formal description of a theory of electric resonance in apical dendrites appeared in an article by Kasevich & LaBerge (2010), which shows how an apical dendrite can fine tune its own membrane oscillations to a specific peak frequency, and narrow the width of the resonance curve around this peak to less than 1 Hz. This refinement enables its associated cortical circuit to generate a specific resonant (\\"carrier\\") frequency by which the circuit can separate its signaling from that of other circuits. A more recent article by LaBerge & Kasevich (2013) describes signaling by neurons as the neural correlate of objective information processing and resonating in clusters of apical dendrites as the neural correlate of subjective impressions (e.g., impressions of sounds, colors, and feelings). These two \\"articles provide theoretical support for the hypothesis that apical dendrite resonance supplements neural signaling as a major mode of neural function. Furthermore, the resonance-based subjective impressions may be regarded as the contents of consciousness.

It is based on the life of Meera Bai, a 15th-century Hindu mystic and poet whose lyrical songs of devotion to the god Krishna are widely popular in northern India. The series, aired on NDTV Imagine from 27 July 2009 till 29 January 2010. Synopsis Meera, the great poet saint was born a princess in Khudki in Rajasthan in the early 16th century. Her father was Ratan Singh -- the youngest son of Rao Dooda, the then ruler of Merta a small state in Marwar. From the time of her birth, it was predicted by Raidasji (a great saint) that Meera was meant for greater things and that her family would be known in through the decades because of her achievements. When Meera is about 8‚Äì9 years old she wants a Gudda (doll) whom she can marry. Saint Raidas-ji gives her Lord Krishna's idol, and Meera immediately falls in love with the Lord. Meera truly believes that the Lord is her husband. Soon after, her marriage is fixed with Bhoj Raj, the son of Rana Sangha of Chittor. But Meera remained, in mind, heart and soul, married to the Lord and never accepted the prince as her husband. After marriage her life was constantly engulfed in turmoil, as very few could understand her devotion and faith towards Lord Krishna. She was soft-spoken, mild-mannered, gifted, sweet and sang with a melodious voice. She was one of the foremost exponents of the Prema Bhakti (Divine Love) and an inspired poet. Soon Meera starts to care for Bhoj Raj but is rigid to accept him as her husband; he dies fighting in a war. After which soon Rana Sangha too dies while fighting. Thus Vikramaditya is made the new Rana (king). He desperately starts having feelings for Meera, who is somehow every time saved by her mother-in-law. She soon leaves Chittod, with a heavy heart with Lalita. She gives her Krishna idol to her mother-in-law, saying that the idol had her life since childhood. But, as fate had she returns to Merta just to know that her brother, Jaimall has died. After spending some years there she goes on pilgrimage to Dwarka and Vrindavan. She disappears within the Lord's idol, making to know that she has attained Moksha and has reached her lord, after years of service. Lalita too gives up her life by jumping into the sea, as \\"wherever there is Meera, there is Lalita\\". Through this show, the attempt to portray Meera's story is as that of an ordinary Rajput princess whose ultimate love and devotion to the Lord led her to question the set norms of the patriarchal society. It is a story relevant even in today's day and age as Meera embodies a woman's true love and her ultimate sacrifice to remain loyal to that love even in the face of social stigma and opposition. A story of unquestioning and pure love.

Life He was born probably in Bedfordshire, was educated at Westminster School, and was elected student of Christ Church, Oxford in 1571. There he proceeded B.A. 17 December 1574, and M.A. 2 May 1578. Taking orders he was a noted preacher. He was elected university proctor 10 April 1583, proceeded B.D. 6 July 1584, and D.D. 6 July 1590. In favour at court, he had rapid preferment, with prebends at Salisbury (1584), Christ Church (1586), and Hereford (1590). He was made treasurer of Hereford Cathedral and chaplain to the queen in 1596. On 19 June 1597 he became dean of Worcester. He was presented to the rectory of Upton-upon-Severn, Worcestershire, 21 December 1598. James I, whose chaplain he became, appointed him a translator of the Bible, and he was one of those divines who assembled at Oxford; but he did not live to see the undertaking, dying at Worcester 19 November 1604.

It uses a pair of three-phase controllable bridges to produce current that is injected into a transmission line using a series transformer. The controller can control active and reactive power flows in a transmission line. Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC), as a representative of the third generation of FACTS devices, is by far the most comprehensive FACTS device, in power system steady-state it can implement power flow regulation, reasonably controlling line active power and reactive power, improving the transmission capacity of power system, and in power system transient state it can realize fast-acting reactive power compensation, dynamically supporting the voltage at the access point and improving system voltage stability, moreover, it can improve the damping of the system and power angle stability. The UPFC uses solid state devices, which provide functional flexibility, generally not attainable by conventional thyristor controlled systems. The UPFC is a combination of a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) and a static synchronous series compensator (SSSC) coupled via a common DC voltage link. The main advantage of the UPFC is to control the active and reactive power flows in the transmission line. If there are any disturbances or faults in the source side, the UPFC will not work. The UPFC operates only under balanced sine wave source. The controllable parameters of the UPFC are reactance in the line, phase angle and voltage. The UPFC concept was described in 1995 by L. Gyugyi of Westinghouse. The UPFC allows a secondary but important function such as stability control to suppress power system oscillations improving the transient stability of power system.  Power flow controller for direct current  A counterpart for unified power flow controller that can be used in direct current systems was proposed for use in high-voltage direct current grids and for low-voltage direct current microgrids. It uses a high-frequency isolated dc-dc converter cascaded with a controllable full-bridge inverter that creates a small bipolar voltage in series with the line. The controller can control the power and compensate for accumulated voltage drop in a distribution line. The main advantage of the solution is the ability to control the bulk power flow in the line while actively processing only a small fraction of the bulk power. The partial power processing leads to increased system efficiency and use of derated components. The use of derated components results in small and cost- efficient designs.

School is a convent educational institution located in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. It is run by the Gyandeep Education Society. The school was founded by Rev. Fr. Raymond Coelho. It is co-educational, providing a liberal education through English medium. The schools cater for pupils from the ages of 4 through to 17 or 18, and are open to children of all religious denominations. It is a day scholars school and affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education, New Delhi. School patron - St. Anselm St. Anselm came from a noble Lombard family and was born in Aosta in the Italian Alps. His mother was a good and pious Burgundian, but after her death his father's violence and harshness caused Anselm to flee France. There, after several years of wandering, he took the Benedictine habit in 1060 at Bec (Normandy), where his illustrious countryman Bl. Lanfranc had started a school at the Abbey of Bec. Within three years he was made Prior and after another 15 years, very reluctantly, Abbot. As an abbot, St. Anselm had to go to England from time to time in connection with his abbey's English properties, and there he became known and highly esteemed for his virtues and zeal. So much that in 1099 he was made Archbishop of Canterbury in the hope that he would be able to cope with the encroachments of King William the Red. History The history of St. Anselm's Pink City School in Jaipur starts from Ajmer, wherein 1904, the French Capuchin Fathers founded St. Anselm's Ajmer. They adopted St. Anselm's motto for the school: Deo Amabile et hominibus, i.e. \\"Pleasing to God - pleasing to men.\\" In 1987 the Diocese of Ajmer-Jaipur wanted to start a similar school in the capital city (Jaipur). For this, they appointed Fr. Raymond Coelho, an educationist. He then founded St. Anselm's Pink City School with some teachers and employees he had recruited. The school motto is '‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§§‡§ø ‡§∏‡•á ‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§§‡§ø' i.e. \\" From Light to Light\\".

Gibraltar is a British overseas territory located at the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea overlooking the Strait of Gibraltar. The territory covers and shares a land border with Spain to the north. Gibraltar has historically been an important base for the British Armed Forces and is the site of a Royal Navy base. The philately of Gibraltar is inexorably linked to its strategic position and military connections. First stamps The first stamps specifically marked Gibraltar were stamps of Bermuda overprinted as such and issued in January 1886. Before that British and Spanish stamps were used according to the type of mail and other arrangements were in place before the invention of postage stamps. British stamps used in Gibraltar may be identified by the use of cancels containing the numeral A26 or the letter G in oval bars.Rossiter, Stuart & John Flower. The Stamp Atlas. London: Macdonald, 1986, p.54. Queen Victoria From November 1886 Gibraltar had its own stamps including the word Gibraltar in the design with seven values from 1/2d to 1 shilling. From 1889 these stamps were overprinted in centimos until British currency began to be used again in 1898.  The Four Kings  Between 1903 and 1950 a variety of definitive and commemorative stamps were issued for the reigns of King Edward VII, George V and George VI. No stamps were issued by Gibraltar for King Edward VIII.

An Anglican school established in 1885, it is notable for its academic achievements, leading to its inclusion in the Malaysian Ministry of Education's Cluster School and High Performance School systems.http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/1/26/nation/5543554&sec;=nation The school, originally funded by St. George's Church, was first located at Farquhar Street in the city centre. It was relocated several times before finally arriving at its present grounds at Macalister Road in 1954. History The history of St. George's Girls School stretches back to 1884, when Mrs. Biggs, wife of the Rev. Louis Coutier Biggs, began conducting informal classes within their residence, known as 'The Manse', at Farquhar Street. Biggs was a British missionary who, at the time, was serving as a preacher at the nearby St. George's Church. St. George's Girls School was formally established in the following year, with R. A. Shackleford becoming the school's first principal. The school was named after St. George, the patron saint of England and principally funded by St. George's Church. The school started off with an intake of 40 students. In 1888, increasing student enrollment led to classes being moved into a newly constructed bungalow next to 'The Manse'. However, the school's \\"close proximity\\" to the Eastern & Oriental Hotel just across Farquhar Street was deemed \\"undesirable\\"; it was stated in an administrative report in 1899 that \\"keeping boarders... was a loss for the school's funds\\". In 1909, the British authorities took over the administration of St. George's Girls School and renamed it the Government Girls' School. Subsequently, efforts were made to address the shortage of qualified teachers and the relocation of the school to accommodate more students. In 1911, the Government Girls' School was moved to Northam Road, and further expansion occurred with the acquisition of two bungalows. The British authorities also proposed in 1916 to turn the all-girls school into a co- educational school, but this idea did not materialise. The administration of Government Girls' School was handed back to St. George's Church in 1920, at which point the school's name was reverted to its original name, St. George's Girls School. In 1954, St. George's Girls School was shifted once more, this time to its present grounds at Macalister Road. The school has since been renowned for the consistent academic achievements of its students. As a result, St. George's Girls School was named one of the Cluster Schools by Malaysia's Ministry of Education in 2008, as well as being listed as one of the country's High Performance Schools in 2010.

Kugan's family had to forcefully break into the morgue where Kugn's body was kept (later to be scolded by the then Home Minister and IGP Of Malaysia for breaking into the morgue) stated they believe he had been tortured to death while in police custody. His case was later classified as murder by the Attorney-General, and 11 officers at the station where he died were transferred to desk duty. The Inspector-General of Police has promised a full investigation into Kugan's death. An initial autopsy declared the cause of death to be acute pulmonary edema (fluid accumulation in the lungs), but Kugan's family alleged scratches and other bruises on the corpse were proof he had been tortured. A second autopsy was later held. This second autopsy found the cause of death to be rhabdomyolysis--skeletal muscle damage resulting in acute kidney failure. Health Ministry director-general Tan Sri Ismail Merican later released a report on the differences between the two autopsies. The report, based on the findings of a 10-person committee, suggested that although Kugan had been beaten, probably with a flexible blunt object such as a hose, the trauma was insufficient to cause death. The report also dismissed other discrepancies in the two autopsy reports, attributing them to miscommunication and misinterpretation on the part of the pathologist who performed the second autopsy. The High Court found Inspector-General of Police (then the Selangor police chief) Khalid Abu Bakar, Khalid's predecessor as national police chief, Ismail Omar, and three other defendants liable for misfeasance leading to his death after finding contradictions between Khalid's and other witnesses' testimonies. The High Court awarded his mother RM851,700 in assault and battery, false imprisonment, misfeasance, and pain and suffering damages.

It follows several women connected to the entertainment industry in Hollywood. Airing on ABC in February 1985, Hollywood Wives, it capitalized on the public's taste for opulent melodramas that dominated television ratings in the 1980s. While it drew a large audience, it was not quite the blockbuster ratings success which the network had hoped for.(27 February 1985) It's a Photo Finish in Ratings Race, Los Angeles Times (Associated Press content) The three-part, four-and-a- half-hour production was produced by Aaron Spelling, whose series Dynasty was number one in the ratings at the time. Like Dynasty, costume design was by Nolan Miller. Collins herself was credited as \\"Creative Consultant\\" for the miniseries, though she later made it clear that she was not actually consulted at all during production and was less than enthusiastic about some of the casting choices. Hollywood Wives was nominated for an Emmy Award for \\"Outstanding Film Editing in a Limited Series or a Special\\" in 1985. Plot=Part 1= Successful Hollywood starlet Gina Germaine (Suzanne Somers) has grown tired of her sex symbol image and is desperate to become a serious actress. Despite warnings of her talent agent Sadie LaSalle (Angie Dickinson), currently considered Hollywood‚Äôs most powerful in the field, to stick with her erotic blockbuster films, Gina sets her mind on a role in the newest film of well-respected film director Neil Gray (Anthony Hopkins). The script, Final Reunion, was written by his wife Montana Gray (Stefanie Powers) and is among the most speculated in Hollywood. Neil believes that the film could be a serious contender at the Oscars, but powerful Sanderson Studios boss Oliver Easterne (Rod Steiger) is not interested in financing the production unless he casts George Lancaster (Robert Stack), the most bankable movie star in the business. At a glitzy film premiere with Hollywood's royalty in attendance, George accepts an award for donating $250,000 dollars to a hospital, much to the annoyance of his daughter Karen (Mary Crosby), who feels that her father is a hypocrite for his philanthropy while always having neglected his family. Karen is good friends with Neil‚Äôs ex-wife and daughter of the founder of Sanderson Studios, Marilee (Joanna Cassidy), who is rather jealous of Neil‚Äôs happy marriage to Montana. Another acquaintance is Elaine Conti (Candice Bergen), a Hollywood wife married to Ross Conti (Steve Forrest), an aging actor who was once the biggest star in Hollywood but is now struggling to get roles and is very insecure about his fading looks. Elaine is determined to help Ross become a big star again, but his career decline has put a strain on their marriage, and Ross is secretly sleeping around with young actresses as well as Karen. Nevertheless, Elaine puts in all efforts to getting her hands on the Final Reunion script and also starts planning a lavish Hollywood party to promote her husband. With the help of her well-connected friends, she prepares an impressive guest list, but all that matters to her is that Sadie will show up and sign Ross. However, Ross is not as hopeful as Elaine, since he was once signed with Sadie until he dropped her during the height of his fame. After a meeting with Oliver Easterne, Neil travels to Palm Beach to sign George Lancaster for the male lead in Final Reunion, but instead finds Gina naked in his hotel room. Even though he is happily married to Montana, Neil sleeps with Gina, who then reveals her wish to be cast in his movie. Neil tries to make clear to her that she is unfit for the role and tries to brush her off. He returns to Los Angeles, where he tells Montana that George rejected the role because he was refused artistic control on the production. Gina, determined to get the role, continues her affair with Neil, going as far as covertly videotaping them together in bed and using it as blackmail to get a screen test. As the casting process continues, aspiring newcomer Buddy Hudson (Andrew Stevens) tries his best to acquire a role. Because he is not signed with any agent, no casting director is willing to give him an opportunity. Having previously worked as a male escort, his former boss Jason Swankle (Roddy McDowall) offers him his old job back, but Buddy has sworn off prostitution since marrying the beautiful and innocent Angel (Catherine Mary Stewart). Angel is worried about Buddy‚Äôs lack of stable income, especially after finding out that she is pregnant. After lying his way into a meeting with Montana Gray, Buddy almost obtains a part in Final Reunion, but when Montana like every other casting director tells him that he is nowhere without an agent, he considers returning to his old job. Meanwhile in Philadelphia, an unstable young man called Deke finds out that his parents adopted him and that his biological mother is somebody important in Hollywood. He goes on a murder spree, first killing his adoptive parents and then hitchhiking his way to Hollywood, killing every driver who picks him up. =Part 2= With the film Final Reunion now officially in production, Neil is pressured to test Gina for the female lead role, but Montana feels that she is unfit and refuses to consider her. As pressure intensifies, Neil‚Äôs behavior becomes more erratic, and Montana fears that he has started drinking again. Meanwhile, Elaine and Ross become more estranged from each other as Elaine starts to become more obsessed with organizing the perfect party while Ross distances himself from it and instead spends all of his time with Karen. Elaine confesses to Marilee that in the past she used to be bullied in high school for being overweight and was even raped by some boys there. She gave birth to a baby boy which she then put up for adoption, after which she fled to Hollywood to become a make- up artist. Elaine admits to Marilee that the incident has made her swear to never feel like a failure again, which is the reason why she is so afraid that her husband‚Äôs career might end. Marilee promises to help Elaine and organizes an impressive guest list. Having failed to impress Montana, Buddy returns to his old job. His boss Jason sets him up in a lavish house in Malibu, which he and his wife Angel are allowed to stay at as long as he escorts wealthy women on dates. Angel soon grows suspicious of his mysterious meetings, but he assures her that nothing is wrong. Their days spent in luxury are cut short when Buddy refuses to spend the night with two older women, a decision that causes him to be fired and kicked out of the Malibu house. Just before they leave, Angel is discovered by Oliver Easterne while walking on the beach, who thinks that she is perfect for the female lead in Final Reunion. He finds out her name but she does not provide him her contact details as she is constantly harassed by men on the streets. Montana becomes agitated that the casting process has been quite difficult so far due to George Lancaster showing no interest as the male lead role. When Neil yet again mentions Gina for the female lead, Easterne warns him about the dangers of getting involved with the actress, revealing that he meets with her for intimate reasons too and knows she's a user. On the day of the party, Elaine overhears an accidentally recorded voice message conversation between Ross and Karen in which their affair is revealed. Feeling crushed, she heads to town and starts a shoplifting spree, until she is caught stealing a necklace at Gucci. The shop owner refuses to release her until she can identify herself as Ross Conti‚Äôs wife. Desperate, she phones Karen and reveals that she knows about the affair. Elaine is unable, however, to contact Ross directly, as he has already left Karen‚Äôs house and is approached on the street by a private investigator (Joe E. Tata) who has taken photos of him with Karen and threatens to release them to the press unless Ross pays him $50,000. After the incident, he picks up Elaine from the store, after which she tells him that she knows about his adultery and once the party is over she is going to leave him. Meanwhile, Buddy meets with an agent, Francis (Dorothy Dells), who invites him to Ross and Elaine‚Äôs party as her escort. He is excited to share the news with Angel but cannot reach her as she, fed up with the poor living conditions at Buddy‚Äôs friend Randy‚Äôs (Stephen Shellen) place they are temporarily staying at, has left the apartment. Angel has since found a job at a hairdresser owned by Koko (James ‚ÄòGypsy‚Äô Haake) and is told by Randy‚Äôs girlfriend Shelly (Aleisa Shirley) that Buddy is cheating on her. Unaware that Shelly has lied to her, Angel feels heartbroken and accepts an invitation by Koko‚Äôs kind, elderly customer Mrs. Liderman (Meg Wyllie) to go with her to Ross and Elaine‚Äôs party. Meanwhile, Deke arrives in Hollywood and buys a gun. =Part 3= At Elaine‚Äôs party, Easterne disappoints her by announcing George Lancaster as the male lead in Final Reunion. Karen gets intoxicated and publicly displays her affection to Ross, which prompts George to scold her. Karen then reveals to George that she is acting out due to traumas of once having caught him sleeping with a 15-year-old girl. Ashamed, he apologizes and promises to be a better father to her. Unimpressed with the social culture of Hollywood, Angel shocks everyone by rejecting Easterne‚Äôs offer to star in Final Reunion. Buddy, meanwhile, is offered a screen test by an intoxicated Montana. Excited by the opportunity, he offers to drive her home, and they end up spending the night together but platonically. Absent from the party are Gina and Neil, who are having sex at a hotel room when Neil suddenly suffers from a heart attack. He is hospitalized, and his affair with Gina becomes public information. Shortly after, Neil dies. After the party, Elaine kicks Ross out of the house and turns to alcohol. Karen assumes that Ross will now choose to be with her, but he tells her that he will always remain Elaine‚Äôs husband. Karen then reveals that she is pregnant with his child and refuses to consider an abortion. After telling her that he is not married, Sadie agrees to turn Buddy into Hollywood's next big movie star on the condition that he remains unmarried so that she can promote him as a sex symbol. She parades her new client in front of Ross, and assures Ross that he will never become a star again. Buddy feels that Sadie used him to prove a point to Ross, and then realizes he is not willing to become a sex symbol or give up Angel. He abandons his career to save his marriage, and then visits his mother who reveals to him that he is not her biological son. Meanwhile, Deke identifies Sadie as his mother and holds her captive in her own mansion. In the process, he shoots and wounds Ross, who arrived for a meeting with Sadie, and almost injures Angel. It turns out that Deke is the identical twin brother of Buddy. Sadie reveals that she gave up Deke and Buddy because they were the product of her affair with Ross. Buddy then arrives, and fatally shoots Deke in self-defense. Following the incident, Elaine formally leaves Ross, and Sadie gets acquainted with her newly found son.

The Brumbrella was praised and criticised - its speed of deployment helped groundstaff protect the pitch quickly, but as a flat protector, it was prone to \\"sweating\\". It was deemed to have contributed to the Edgbaston pitch's deterioration, and its demise was hastened by legislation against flat covers. It was briefly replaced by \\"Son of Brumbrella\\", but today the groundstaff rely on manpower to manoeuvre the covers onto the Edgbaston pitch. Description The Brumbrella comprised a flat rainproof covering which was mechanically unrolled across the playing surface to protect the pitch and most of the outfield from rain. The motorised roller was intended to allow the cover to be rapidly deployed in bad weather, and then removed when the weather improved, so play could continue as quickly as possible, but this was not always achieved: The original mechanism, a large section of North Sea oil pipeline wrapped with a tarpaulin and weighing some 6 tons, was installed in the winter of 1980 having been designed by Terry Rutter of Sports Ground Consultants. The ¬£43,380 cost was met by the Warwickshire County Cricket Club Supporters' Association.Cricket: Brumbrella lends county shelter, Birmingham Post, 21 February 2001 It was first used during a heavy rain shower in England's second One-day International against Australia on 6 June 1981.When the surface water had been removed by the roller wrapped cover, Umpire Dickie Bird met cover designer Terry Rutter on the pitch and said \\"let's get them back on shall we\\"? It was prone to malfunction once the cover fabric had been changed, notably suffering damage on the first day of the 1990 Edgbaston Test match, which prevented its use for the duration of the five-day match.http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153149.html Anti-moisture policy In 1999, the ECB introduced a policy against \\"flat\\" covers, which can encourage moisture to sweat out of a damp pitch, making batting more difficult, and opposing captains were given the right to object to its use. The Brumbrella continued in use for a little while longer, but, after 20 years of use, it was replaced in early 2001. Parts were given away to Warwickshire clubs to use as covers, including Moseley Ashfield, and a \\"massive section\\" was acquired by Atherstone Town Cricket Club. The Brumbrella was also blamed, in part, for a deterioration in the condition of the Edgbaston pitch. Replacement The new mechanism‚Äîdubbed \\"Son of Brumbrella\\"‚Äîcost around ¬£80,000 and was much lighter, weighing only one ton. It had two motorised rollers, housed in trenches on either side of the outfield, and was operated by remote control. However, it proved temperamental in use, and malfunctioned several times. It failed before the first County Championship match of the season against Hampshire on 20‚Äì23 April, and a second time on 2 June, during the third day of Warwickshire's third home Championship match against Gloucestershire, and the groundstaff returned to manual covers for England's One-day International against Pakistan on 7 June.Cricket: Brumbrella facing Edgbaston exit, Ian Willars, Birmingham Evening, 4 June 2001Cricket: Brumbrella ruled out for one-dayer, Birmingham Evening Mail, 5 June 2001 However, the groundstaff struggled to deploy and remove manual covers quickly during the rain-affected Ashes Test on 5‚Äì8 July 2001. The new Brumbrella was abandoned later that year and returned to its manufacturers, Tildenet, who refunded its cost to Warwickshire.Cricket: Warwicks delay move on cover at Edgbaston, Birmingham Post, 9 January 2002.

History The initial ideas for founding SISCOG started to be discussed in 1982 while Jo√£o Pav√£o Martins and Ernesto Morgado were Ph.D. students in artificial intelligence at the State University of New York at Buffalo. These ideas were influenced by the success of the first commercial expert systems, and led to the company's incorporation in 1986. Through these last 30 years, SISCOG has developed several software products that offer users different levels of decision support, from just validating all the constraints pertaining the problem and performing helpful calculations while the users build the plan (manual mode), to pointing out directions for achieving a good solution (semi-automatic mode) or even achieving an optimised solution by just themselves (automatic mode). These products use a combination of artificial intelligence and operational research optimisation technologies to produce nearly optimal solutions that fit the client needs. SISCOG has implemented its decision support systems in companies like the Canadian Railways, Dutch Railways, Finnish Railways, Norwegian State Railways, Danish State Railways, DSB S-Tog ‚Äì Copenhagen Suburban Trains, London Underground and Lisbon Metro.

They are approximately west of the town of Helston.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End The Plymouth chemist William Cookworthy mixed china stone with kaolin, mined from the hill to make Plymouth porcelain; which was the first time porcelain was made in Europe. Part of the hill is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and at the date of notification (1994) was the only known site of western rustwort (Marsupella profunda) in Great Britain. Wildlife and ecology Trig point, Tregonning Hill The main vegetation types on the hill are western lowland heath and scrub. The heath consists of a mixture of heather (Calluna vulgaris), bell heather (Erica cinerea) and western gorse (Ulex gallii] with cross‚Äìleaved heath (Erica tetralix) replacing E. cinerea in wet areas. Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and tormentil (Potentilla erecta) also occur. On the deeper soils European gorse (Ulex europaeus), bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) and bramble (Rubus fruticosus) are the dominant scrub species. The bare slopes of the old china clay works are where western rustwort (Marsupella profunda) occurs. By 2004 the liverwort was known from fourteen sites within three SSSIs, making Cornwall the main stronghold globally. The nationally scarce moss (Brachydontium trichodes) known from only two sites in Cornwall also occurs on Tregonning Hill. As of 7 September 2010 the condition of the SSSI was considered to be ‚Ä≥unfavourable declining\\". History On the top of the hill is Castle Pencaire, an Iron Age hillfort, two rounds and a field system which are all scheduled under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, as a ‚Ä≥multi-period archaeological landscape‚Ä≥. Due to scrub and tree growth it is in a poor condition and is on Historic England's, Heritage at Risk Register. The grade II listed Germoe war memorial is on the summit of the hill within the hillfort. =Industry= Tregonning Hill is a detached outcrop of the Cornubian batholith. The granite has been altered by kaolinization resulting in china clay. Disused pits, gullies, waste-tips and debris litter the hillside. While visiting the area in 1745, William Cookworthy, a Plymouth chemists observed a very fine clay being used to repair furnaces. Cook had previously discovered how to make hard porcelain, which at that time was imported from China. He subsequently searched for a suitable clay so that porcelain could be made in Europe and found that when mixed with china stone the clay from Tregonning Hill was suitable. He took leases on the hill and exported the clay from Porthleven to Plymouth. In the 1870s china clay from Tregonning, and a 30 to 40 acre quarry at Tresowes on the western side of hill, was shipped from Porthleven; the amounts were 92 tons in 1876, 130 in 1877, 61 in 1878, 136 in 1879 and none in 1880. Export of china clay and fire bricks to New York via Hayle first started in August 1880. In 1882, Tresowes produced 700 tons, while Tregonning Hill produced 500 tons. In the early 1870s the Tregonning Hill China Clay and Brick Works was established by William Argall. He had the financial backing of two ironfounders; William Harvey of Hayle and John Toy of Helston. A Scrivener kiln () is the only part of the brickwork's which can still be seen. In the early 1880s, ten people were employed at the brickworks and the approximate annual number of bricks produced was 150,000. According to Historic England the partly ruinous kiln is probably of the 18th-century and in 1987 was given a grade II listing. An Ordnance Survey map published in 1907 indicates the site was disused by then. An elvan quarry was in operation on the summit in 1879.

The project is designed to create a comprehensive data pool on government- related activities in the countries considered the world's most developed free-market democracies. In addition, it uses international comparisons to provide evidence-based input for reform-related public discourse taking place in these countries. The SGI are updated every two or three years.http://www.sgi-network.org/index.php?page=faq  Behind the project  The Bertelsmann Foundation is an operational think tank that encourages social change and aims to foster sustainability by identifying nascent challenges early on and by developing strategies to face these issues.http://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/cps/rde/xchg/SID- EBDD7A2B-365804A0/bst_engl/hs.xsl/2085.htm  Method  Three scholars with established country expertise are involved in the analysis of each OECD state under review. In an attempt to identify and reduce subjective bias, the SGI project selects experts representing both domestic and external views as well as the viewpoints of political scientists and economists. Comparative political scientists with area expertise then integrate the two expert reports into a single country report, and select information according to certain validity and objectivity criteria.  SGI and the Transformation Index  The SGI concept is inspired by the Bertelsmann Foundation‚Äôs Transformation Index (BTI).http://www.bertelsmann-transformation-index.de/ The Transformation Index focuses on 128 countries‚Äîall of which are transitioning to a market-based democracy or potentially headed in that direction‚Äîand assesses the extent to which political management fulfils criteria regarding sustainability, democracy founded on the rule of law, social integration and welfare. Since 2002, the BTI has been documenting the progress 128 transformation countries have been making toward democracy and a market economy.Empter, Stefan & Josef Janning (2009): Sustainable Governance Indicators 2009 - An Introduction, in: Bertelsmann Stiftung (ed.): Sustainable Governance Indicators 2009. Policy Performance and Executive Capacity in the OECD. G√ºtersloh: Verlag Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2009. p.15. Using a similar approach to BTI, the SGI evaluate the extent to which OECD member states are in a position, given changing domestic and international conditions, to implement the reforms necessary for ensuring their future viability. By measuring the need for reform along with the effectiveness of existing initiatives, the SGI aims to identify the best policy solutions for promoting democracy and a market economy.  Infrastructure of the SGI  The need for reform within a country is analyzed in the Sustainable Governance Indicators in the Status Index, while the capacity for reform is analyzed in the Management Index. = Status Index = Construction of the SGI Status Index Status Index scores are composite measures, based on numerous quantitative and qualitative assessments. The democracy category counts for half of the index score, while the four policy- specific categories collectively provide the remainder. The Status Index analyzes the need for reform through two principle dimensions: * The first dimension of the Status Index maps the quality of democracy within a country and examines four criteria: \\"Electoral Process,\\" \\"Access to Information,\\" \\"Civil Rights,\\" and \\"Rule of Law.\\" * The second dimension of the Status Index corresponds to the OECD states' competencies in policy fields that are highly relevant for future viability. The index examines fields such as \\"Economy and Employment,\\" \\"Social Affairs,\\" \\"Security,\\" and \\"Resources,\\" which include 15 different policy areas.http://www.sgi- network.org/index.php?page=index&index;=status = Management Index = Construction of the SGI Management Index Management Index scores are composite measures, based on numerous quantitative and qualitative assessments. The three categories \\"Steering Capability,\\" \\"Policy Implementation\\" and \\"Institutional Learning\\" collectively count for half of the index score, while the Executive Accountability dimension provides the remaining half. The Management Index considers, in relative terms, how capable governments and societies are of effective reform. The Management Index examines government performance and analyzes a country's reform capacity through two dimensions: * The first dimension, Executive Capacity, measures the strategic steering and problem solving capabilities of the respective OECD states. Thus, Executive Capacity analyzes a government's organizational structures and processes. The main analytical categories used were \\"Steering Capability,\\" \\"Policy Implementation\\" and \\"Institutional Learning.\\" * The second dimension, Executive Accountability, looks at how the government interacts with external state and non-state actors (Citizens, parliaments, political parties, trade associations and media) and measures to what extent these actors positively influence the executive branch.Sustainable Governance Indicators 2009. Policy Performance and Executive Capacity in the OECD. p. 22  Results =Status Index 2011= Status Index results 2011; results displayed on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best) The top rankings of the Status Index are dominated by northern European countries. At the same time, the leading group also includes New Zealand, with its Anglo-Saxon heritage, and continental European Switzerland, two nations with different political and state welfare traditions. The group of mid-range scorers (Canada, Australia, Germany, Iceland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United States, Ireland, United Kingdom, Belgium, Austria, Czech Republic, France, Portugal, Japan, Chile, Spain, and Poland) and the lowest-ranking group (South Korea, Italy, Slovakia, Mexico, Greece, and Turkey) are geographically and culturally just as heterogeneous as the top group. Standard typologies in comparative political science are insufficient to explain the Status Index ranking of the OECD nations. For example, majoritarian democracies do not systematically score better or worse than consensus democracies. Classifying the countries as federalist and centralist states also fails to help explain the differences in reform capacity. The top group includes, above all, social democratic welfare states such as the Scandinavian countries. However, liberal welfare states also achieve high scores, with New Zealand, Switzerland and Canada in the upper mid-range. In general, the findings of the Status Index reveal higher scores among long-term, established OECD members ‚Äì although there are exceptions: Chile, a new member, places in the lower midrange, while Italy and Greece rank significantly lower than some Eastern European countries. This suggests that the smaller, more open national economies tend to pursue especially sustainable policies. =Management Index 2011= Management Index results 2011; results displayed on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best) At the highest level of aggregation in the Management Index, the overview provides important initial indications of which countries exhibit the best performance of governance overall and which countries show deficiencies. Background information in greater depth on the performance of a given country can be found in the country reports on the SGI website.http://sgi-network.org/ These include substantiated, qualitative information right down to the level of individual indicators. The SGI Management Indicators are clearly led by Sweden and Norway, each with average scores exceeded 8 points. Next come Denmark, Finland, New Zealand and Australia. While the overall ranking of northern European countries is again outstanding, as observed in the Status Index, this sequence also underscores the fact that no particular system type is favored in the Management Index. This top group is followed by a broad mid-range in which the changes in index scores are incremental, leaving no discernible clusters. Clearly bringing up the rear of the survey are Greece and Slovakia. Both countries trail Italy, which is 29th in the ranking, by nearly an entire point. The new OECD member Chile stands out positively, already scoring higher than some established, longstanding OECD states. = Summary of results = The central finding of the SGI is that the quality of governance is most important in ensuring sustainable policy outcomes. Countries with \\"good executive management performance, a sound democratic order and an effective inclusion of societal actors into policymaking processes are more successful in terms of sustainability and also in terms of social justice.\\" http://www.sgi-network.org/index.php?page=news  See also  * Bertelsmann Stiftung * Good Governance * Sustainability * Sustainability measurement  Sources  External links  * Sustainable Governance Indicators Homepage * Bertelsmann Transformation Index Homepage Sustainability metrics and indices OECD Environmental policy ","title":"Sustainable Governance Indicators"},{"id":"23799436","text":"Los Inundados (English: The Flooded Ones) is a 1961 Argentine comedy film directed by Fernando Birri.

McMillan-Scott was leader of the Conservative MEPs 1997‚Äì2001. He was re-elected top of the Yorkshire & Humber regional list in the 2009 election. McMillan-Scott is a lifelong pro-European. Following David Cameron's decision to withdraw the Conservative MEPs from the centrist European People's Party in order to form the European Conservative and Reformist's Group, McMillan-Scott objected. When the composition of Cameron's new ECR group was announced after the European elections of 2009, McMillan-Scott protested. The new group was described by Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg as \\"a bunch of nutters, homophobes, anti- Semites and climate-change deniers\\". He successfully stood as an independent Vice-President against the nominee of the ECR Group, Polish MEP Micha≈Ç Kami≈Ñski, criticising Kami≈Ñski's alleged past links to extremism, confirmed inter alia by the Daily Telegraph. He is the only Vice-President to have been elected without an official party candidature. In March 2010, he joined the Liberal Democrats with whom he had usually worked closely on democracy and human rights issues. In May 2010 he became a member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament. He then sat as ALDE Vice-President of the European Parliament. In January 2012, he was re-elected as Vice-President for the fourth time. He once again received the portfolio for Democracy and Human Rights as well as additionally gaining the Sakharov Prize Network, which underpins the parliament's annual prize for freedom of expression and responsibility for transatlantic relations. In the 2014 election he lost his seat as an MEP in an election that saw nationwide gains for the UK Independence Party, and the Liberal Democrats coming fifth and losing all but one of their seats. At the 2015 general election, he was the Liberal Democrat candidate for the Yorkshire parliamentary seat of Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford. The seat was retained by the Labour Party candidate Yvette Cooper MP with a 15,428 majority, whilst McMillan-Scott came a poor third with just under 3% of the vote and therefore lost his deposit. In May 2017 he fought the West Worcestershire parliamentary seat during the \\"snap\\" General Election for the Liberal Democrats. He came third with 9% of the vote. His home is near Pershore, Worcestershire, where his family moved from Yorkshire in the 18th century. Early life McMillan-Scott was born 15 August 1949 in Cambridge, England, one of seven children of the late Walter, an architect, and the late Elisabeth McMillan-Scott, n√©e Hudson. He was educated privately by Dominican friars. He worked across the continent, the USSR and Africa as a tour director for a US company for several years. He speaks French, Italian, some German and Spanish. From 1973 he worked in public affairs and in 1982 set up his own Whitehall consultancy. His clients included the Falkland Islands Government. He became a member of the Conservative Party in 1967 and joined the European Movement in 1973. He was one of the joint regional coordinators for the Yes to Europe campaign in the 1975 referendum on EC membership. European Parliament McMillan-Scott was elected as the MEP for York from 1984 to 1994, then MEP for North Yorkshire from 1994 to 1999, and an MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber from 1999 until 2014. In 2014 he stood for re-election as an MEP but was resoundingly defeated. =Roles and responsibilities= McMillan-Scott was leader of the British Conservative MEPs between September 1997 and December 2001, and attended the Shadow Cabinet on European issues. On 23 July 2004 he was elected fourth of the 14 Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament. He was re-elected a Vice-President in 2007, 2009 and 2012. McMillan-Scott's special responsibilities as Vice-President included relations with national EU parliaments and the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which brings together 280 MPs from the EU, North Africa and the Middle East. After re-election as Vice-President in 2009, his responsibilities as Vice-President were Democracy and Human Rights, relations with national parliaments, and chairing the European Parliament's Audit Panel. After re- election in 2012 he continued with the democracy and human rights portfolio and additionally the Sakharov Prize Network and transatlantic relations. He founded the regular forum between the Human Rights and Democracy Network, more than 40 Brussels-based NGOs, and the European Parliament, whose aim is to maximise EU attention to these topics. He sat on the Supervisory Group which oversees all the European Parliament's democracy and human rights activities, including election observation. He has participated in numerous such missions since 1990. He was elected chairman of the European Parliament's largest-ever election observer missions, 30 MEPs, to the Palestinian territories in January 2005 and January 2006. These observers monitored the Palestinian National Authority's presidential and parliamentary elections. Awards and prizes=Medal of Honour= McMillan-Scott was presented in September 2013 with the Medal of Honour by the Venice-based European Inter-University Centre for Human Rights and Democratisation, comprising 41 universities, \\"in recognition of his lasting efforts in the promotion and protection of human rights\\". Previous winners are Mary Robinson, former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and Manfred Nowak, former UN Special Rapporteur on Torture. =Outstanding Contribution= On 25 September McMillan-Scott won the top award, for ‚ÄòOutstanding Contribution‚Äô in the 2012 MEP Awards presented by the Parliament magazine, Brussels sister publication of Westminster's House magazine. The citation referred to his achievements in democracy and human rights, especially his active involvement in the Arab Spring, as well as his leadership of the Single Seat campaign to end MEPs‚Äô monthly trek from their base in Brussels to their official ‚Äòseat‚Äô in Strasbourg. Campaigning=Democracy and Human Rights= After the fall of the Berlin Wall, McMillan- Scott founded the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), to facilitate the development of democracy and civil society in the ex-Soviet bloc countries, and which is now directed towards the reforming Arab world and countries resisting reform such as China, Cuba and Russia. The instrument makes ‚Ç¨150 million available to those promoting human rights and democracy, often without the applicant's host country consent. As a frequent visitor to countries of the former Soviet Bloc and its satellites after his election in 1984, where he had contacts with dissidents, McMillan-Scott was arrested and fined in Leningrad (now St Petersburg) in 1972 for visiting former religious institutions while working as a tour guide. He was present during the October 1993 attempted coup d'√©tat by old guard communists against President Boris Yeltsin and was the only outside politician to speak at Gary Kasparov‚Äôs July 2006 ‚ÄòOther Russia‚Äô rally. Since then he visited Russia frequently to engage with the leaders of the mounting anti-Putin movement and initiated a range of debates, resolutions, conferences and other activities across the European Union to draw attention to the collapse of the democratic system in Russia. This culminated in a barrage of denunciations after the Russian takeover of the Crimea in 2014, and a rigorous set of sanctions against the Putin regime, in which MCMillan-Scott played a leading role in Brussels. In May 2015, he was one of nine British politicians on President Putin's visa blacklist. From 2004 ‚Äì 2012 he chaired the European Parliament's informal, cross-party Democracy Caucus, which was set up to campaign for a European Endowment for Democracy and Human Rights (EED). The ambition was to have an equivalent to Washington's National Endowment for Democracy, to work at arms‚Äô-length from the EU and to be deniable, expert and flexible. The EED was set up in 2012. McMillan-Scott is one of the foremost campaigners for reform in China. After his last visit to Beijing, in May 2006, all the dissidents and former prisoners-of-conscience with whom he had contact were arrested, imprisoned and in some cases tortured. These included the Christian human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng and environmental activist Hu Jia. McMillan-Scott successfully nominated Hu Jia for the 2008 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Expression, awarded annually by the European Parliament. He has sponsored numerous activities, hearings and resolutions focussed on reform in China. In November 2010 he met the dissident artist Ai Weiwei, co-designer of Beijing's ‚ÄòBirds Nest‚Äô stadium, who made a highly-critical series of comments for McMillan-Scott's YouTube channel. Ai Weiwei later spent some months under house arrest in Beijing. He has argued for an Impunity Index to be maintained by the International Criminal Court, based on the West German Salzgitter process during the Cold War, where denunciations of crimes against humanity in totalitarian states may later lead to prosecutions. He wrote a key report for the European Parliament's foreign affairs select committee, of which he was at one time the longest-serving member, on a new EU‚ÄìChina strategy in 1997. Following subsequent visits to China and pre-Olympic crackdowns he initiated a campaign aimed at an EU political boycott of the August 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. In the event, the Presidents of the European Parliament and European Commission boycotted the Games, as did the EU's external affairs Commissioner. McMillan-Scott was the first politician to visit Tibet after a three-year blackout, in 1996. He has subsequently championed the cause of Tibetan independence, taking part in numerous activities to highlight oppression in Tibet. He and his staff have made many speeches and taken part in pro-democracy activities with Tibetan exiles. In October 2006, McMillan-Scott visited Cuba, where he met Sakharov prize winners ‚ÄòThe Ladies in White‚Äô and the late Oswaldo Pay√° as well as other dissidents and has since encouraged their campaign for political freedoms. =Falun Gong= Edward McMillan-Scott and Ethan Gutmann in press conference, 2009 McMillan-Scott, although he has no religious beliefs, has championed Falun Gong, a spiritual practice which has been persecuted by the Chinese government since 1999. In 2006 he stated \\"We are talking about genocide. The Falun Gong has been singled out. This is why governments must take action and put pressure to bear on the United National to conduct an inquiry.\\"Tom Allard (16 August 2006) \\"Call to UN to probe Falun Gong genocide claims\\", The Sydney Morning Herald He met many former prisonersEdward McMillan-Scott MEP interviews China torture camp survivor YouTube, 13 September 2007 and published accounts of their torture.Edward McMillan-Scott, Hearsay evidence taken at a meeting in Beijing, China on 21 May 2006, European Commission He campaigned against organ harvestingDavid Kilgour, David Matas (6 July 2006, revised 31 January 2007) An Independent Investigation into Allegations of Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China (free in 22 languages) organharvestinvestigation.net of Falun Gong in China.Peter Westmore (2 September 2006) \\"Bid to end China's organ-harvesting\\" News Weekly Australia In 2012 he stated, \\"I am absolutely convinced that over a long period from 1999 onwards, organ harvesting from prisoners has been taking place, especially of Falun Gong\\".Killed for Organs: China's Secret State Transplant Business (2012) YouTube video, 8 minutes Ethan Gutmann interviewed over 100 witnesses and estimated that 65,000 Falun Gong practitioners were killed for their organs from 2000 to 2008.Jay Nordlinger (25 August 2014) \\"Face The Slaughter: The Slaughter: Mass Killings, Organ Harvesting, and China‚Äôs Secret Solution to Its Dissident Problem, by Ethan Gutmann\\", National ReviewViv Young (11 August 2014) \\"The Slaughter: Mass Killings, Organ Harvesting, and China‚Äôs Secret Solution to Its Dissident Problem\\", New York Journal of BooksEthan Gutmann (August 2014) The Slaughter: Mass Killings, Organ Harvesting and China‚Äôs Secret Solution to Its Dissident Problem \\"Average number of Falun Gong in Laogai System at any given time\\" Low estimate 450,000, High estimate 1,000,000 p 320. \\"Best estimate of Falun Gong harvested 2000 to 2008\\" 65,000 p 322. amazon.com =The Arab World= McMillan-Scott, a relation of T E Lawrence (‚Äòof Arabia‚Äô) through the latter's father, Sir Thomas Chapman Bt, has campaigned for reform across the Arab world since a visit to Jordan in 1993. He championed Egypt's liberal El Ghad party from 2003, and secured the release of its leader, Dr Ayman Nour, after he was imprisoned for standing against former President Mubarak in 2005. He was the first outside politician to get to Cairo at the end of the revolution in February 2011 and made a series of visits to the region in the following months. In September 2012, jointly with the leader of the ALDE group in the European Parliament, Guy Verhofstadt, he was present at the launch of the Arab Leaders for Freedom and Democracy. The meetings were attended among others by Dr Ayman Nour, Mr Amre Moussa and interim Libyan premier Mahmud Gibril. =Children's rights= McMillan-Scott campaigns for improved children's rights across the EU and has dealt with a number of cross-frontier child abduction cases. He began campaigning for an EU-wide missing child alert, similar to the Amber Alert system in the US, with Kate and Gerry McCann, parents of missing Madeleine. A resolution to this effect, in the summer of 2008, was sponsored by McMillan-Scott and gained the support of a majority of MEPs. In the US, the Department of Justice's Amber Alert has recovered over 500 abducted children since 2003, 80% within the crucial first 72 hours. France has an identical system but other countries, including the UK, rely on a patchwork of police schemes and children's charities. =Anti-fraud= In 1999 McMillan-Scott was singled out by ‚Äòwhistleblower‚Äô Paul van Buitenen for his role in the 1999 fall of the European Commission. After McMillan-Scott's discovery of fraud in the EU Commission's tourism unit during the 1990 European Year of Tourism, which McMillan-Scott had initiated, he campaigned for reform and in 1995 caused the first-ever raid by Belgium's fraud squad on the Commission. After a report by a panel of independent Wise Men, the Commission was later accused of serious irregularities, nepotism and allegations of fraud leading to the resignation of President Jacques Santer and all his commissioners in 1999. His 'Golden Fleece' campaign against fraud and malpractice in the Costa villa and timeshare market won wide support, leading to the EU Timeshare Directive in 1994. He has continued to campaign for more secure property rights in the EU's neighbouring states, as buyers move into the Balkans, Turkey and North Africa, where the legal framework is less secure. =Single Seat of the European Parliament in Brussels= McMillan-Scott has been a member of every initiative aimed at ending the European Parliament's monthly four-day sessions in Strasbourg since his election in 1984. In October 2010 he set up the Brussels- Strasbourg Study Group of senior MEPs to provide objective information. Its February 2011 report 'A Tale of Two Cities' stated that the additional cost is ‚Ç¨180 million and 19,000 tonnes of CO2 a year. The Single Seat campaign, aims at moving all the European Parliament's activities to Brussels. McMillan-Scott was awarded the Parliament magazine's 2012 Award for 'Outstanding Contribution' partly for his leadership of the campaign, which resulted in a large majority of MEPs voting for their governments to address the issue. =Sustainable food= Since 2008 McMillan-Scott has eaten no meat because of its alleged effect on climate change and in December 2009 invited Sir Paul McCartney to a conference ‚ÄòLess Meat = Less Heat‚Äô, jointly with Dr Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. McCartney campaigns for less meat consumption as Meat Free Mondays. A long-term campaigner for reform of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy, in June 2011 McMillan-Scott invited Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall to Brussels to internationalise the super-chef's Fish Fight against discards. On 3 December 2013, Edward launched EU Food Sense: your right to the right food, a campaign for a sustainable food policy in the EU to replace the wasteful Common Agricultural Policy. Leaving the Conservative Party Before the European Elections of June 1999, the British Conservative MEPs were allied members of the European People's Party (EPP). After the election, jointly with the then leader of the Conservative Party William Hague, McMillan-Scott negotiated the 'M√°laga Agreement' which provided for a more detached relationship between the 36 British Conservative MEPs and the newly formed European People's Party‚ÄìEuropean Democrats (EPP-ED) coalition. This agreement remained in force until the 2009 elections when the Conservatives broke links with the EPP and formed part of the new European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group. Following his re-election to the European Parliament, McMillan-Scott left the EPP group and joined the new ECR group in accordance with the Conservative manifesto for the election. He attended the inaugural meeting of the new group, in Brussels on 24 June, where he expressed the view that he was uncomfortable with some members of the group having possible links with extremist groups. In July 2009 he successfully stood for re-election as Vice- President of the European Parliament against the nominee of the new ECR group, Micha≈Ç Kami≈Ñski a Polish MEP from the Law and Justice Party, after discovering Kami≈Ñski's past links to an extremist group in Poland. As a result, the Conservative whip was withdrawn. McMillan-Scott was then seated as a non- attached (Non-Inscrit) MEP in the European Parliament, though he remained a member of the British Conservative Party. On 10 August 2009, William Hague wrote a letter to McMillan-Scott, described by the Conservative Home website as ‚Äòhumiliating‚Äô. On 15 September 2009, he was expelled from the Conservative Party without notice or reason. The doyen of the Yorkshire Post wrote a stinging attack entitled \\"Own goal as Tories force out a decent man\\". McMillan-Scott appealed and issued a series of open letters to his constituents but, after his lawyers declared that he could not expect a fair hearing from the Conservative Party, he wrote to David Cameron on 12 March 2010 outlining his reasons for resigning his appeal. The vilification of McMillan-Scott by the Conservative Party included the alteration of Wikipedia pages, in an attempt \\"to airbrush the embarrassing past\\" of Micha≈Ç Kami≈Ñski, chairman of the ECR. McMillan-Scott also stated, that his own article had also been edited in this way. An article published in The Observer newspaper reports edits to the articles made on 25 June 2009 from IP addresses originating in the United Kingdom House of Commons. =The rise of the right= McMillan-Scott has long studied totalitarianism; his opposition to the Soviet system was shared by many Conservatives. However, with the transition to democracy he found that increasingly the Conservative Party saw European Union enlargement as a means to dismembering the EU. It began to make common cause with what McMillan-Scott saw as rightist groups and factions in the new democracies. Through his family's background, McMillan-Scott was alarmed at what he saw as the rise of disguised extremism and forms of neo- Fascism. TIME magazine's cover story after the European elections of 2009 reported that Europe had made a far right turn, covering the rise of the right in ten EU countries. McMillan-Scott's rejection of David Cameron's new ECR group and his successful stand as an independent vice-president against Micha≈Ç Kami≈Ñski finally led to his break with the Conservative Party. Joining the Liberal Democrats On 12 March 2010 McMillan-Scott joined the Liberal Democrats, as he felt that they provided a more suitable home with a focus on human rights and an internationalist agenda. The Liberal Democrats are a member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament, which McMillan-Scott formally joined on 17 May. He was nominated by the Liberal Democrat MEPs, and then the ALDE group, as a candidate for Vice-President in January 2012 and was then successfully re- elected. He described the Coalition as 'the happiest moment in my political life: Liberal Democrats have tamed the Conservative extremists'. Family McMillan-Scott married a child rights lawyer Henrietta in 1972. They have two daughters Lucinda born 1973 and Arabella born 1976 and four granddaughters Edie born 1999, Esme born 2001, Sylvia born 2012 and Matilda born 2016.

Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009 besides to dedicated tracks and sessions on wider scope conferences. A word of caution is needed before delving into the subject, because obviously the use of MP for solving optimization problems, albeit in a heuristic way, is much older and much more widespread than matheuristics. However, this is not the case for metaheuristics. Even the very idea of designing MP methods specifically for heuristic solution has innovative traits, when opposed to exact methods which turn into heuristics when enough computational resources are not available. Some approaches using MP combined with metaheuristics have begun to appear regularly in the matheuristics literature. This combination can go two-ways, both in MP used to improve or design metaheuristics and in metaheuristics used for improving known MP techniques, even though the first of these two directions is by far more studied.

The ancient city lies about north-east of Khartoum, and about east of the Nile River located at approximately MGRS 36QWC290629877. Here smaller wadis meet the Wadi Awateib coming from the center of the Butana plateau region, and further north at Wad ban Naqa from where it joins the Nile. Naqa was only a camel or donkey's journey from the Nile, and could serve as a trading station on the way to the east; thus it had strategic importance. Naqa is one of the largest ruined sites in the country and indicates an important ancient city once stood in the location. It was one of the centers of the Kingdom of Mero√´, which served as a bridge between the Mediterranean world and Africa. The site has two notable temples, one devoted to Amun and the other to Apedemak which also has a Roman kiosk nearby. With Mero√´ and Musawwarat es-Sufra it is known as the Island of Meroe, and was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011.UNESCO Island of Meroe.  Research  Location of the Kingdom of Kush, 4th century BC The first European travellers reached Naqa in 1822, before Hermann von P√ºckler-Muskau did in 1837. In 1843, it was visited by Richard Lepsius and his Prussian Egypt-Sudan expedition. He copied some of the inscriptions and representations of the temple standing here. In 1958 a team from Berlin's Humboldt University visited Naqa and documented the temple and restored part of the site along with the nearby site of Musawwarat es-Sufra in the 1960s. Since 1995, Naqa has been excavated by a German-Polish team with the participation of the Egyptian Museum of Berlin and the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. It is directed by Professor Dietrich Wildung and is financed by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) and also includes Polish archaeologist Professor Lech Krzy≈ºaniak, and a small group of Polish archaeologists from Pozna≈Ñ.  Structure  Naqa comprises several Meroitic temples dating to 4th century BC to 4th century AD, and the ruins of an apparent urban agglomeration and several burial grounds. Archaeologists cited Naqa as one of the most important centres of this first civilization of Black Africa. The remains of various temples were found, but the two largest and most significant temples of Naqa are the Amun and Apedemak temples, also known as the Temple of the Lion. Both are still well preserve. = Temple of Amun = Amun temple of Naqa Amun was a deity in Egyptian mythology who in the form of Amun-Ra became the focus of the most complex system of theology in Ancient Egypt. Whilst remaining hypostatic deities, Amun represented the essential and hidden, whilst in Ra he represented revealed divinity. As the creator deity \\"par excellence\\", he was the champion of the poor and central to personal piety. Amun was self-created, without mother and father, and during the New Kingdom he became the greatest expression of transcendental deity in Egyptian theology. His position as King of gods developed to the point of virtual monotheism where other gods became manifestations of him. With Osiris, Amun-Ra is the most widely recorded of the Egyptian gods. The Amun temple of Naqa was founded by King Natakamani and is 100 metres in length and has several statues of the ruler. The temple is aligned on an east-west axis and is made of sandstone, which has been somewhat eroded by the wind. The temple is designed in the Egyptian style, with an outer court and colonnade of rams similar to the Temple of Amun at Jebel Barkal and Karnak, and leads to a hypostyle hall containing the inner sanctuary (naos). The main entrances and walls of the temple contain relief carvings. Columns of the Amun temple In 1999 the German-Polish archaeology team explored the area of the inner sanctuary of the temple where the main statue of the god was originally kept. They discovered an undamaged painted \\"altar\\", which includes iconography and names written in hieroglyphs of the king Natakamani and his wife Amanitore, founders of the temple. The altar is considered unique for Sudan and Egypt in that time period. A fifth statue of the king Natakamani was also discovered in this chamber along with a commemorative stone stela of Queen Amanishakheto who is believed to have been ruling the Meroites prior to the reign of Natakamani and Amanitore. The obverse shows a delicate sunken relief of the queen and a goddess who was a partner of the Meroitic lion god Apademak. The reverse and sides of the stela contain undeciphered Meroitic hieroglyphs and is considered by the discovery team to be one of the best examples of Meroitic art found to date. After excavation, reconstruction and measurement of the temple of Amun for over a decade, on 1 December 2006, the Sudanese authorities regained management, giving responsibility to the Ministry of Culture.ZDF-\\"Heute-Journal\\", January 12, 2006 Another Amun temple named Naqa 200 and located on the slope of the nearby Gebel Naqa, the mountain overlooking the settlement of Naqa, has been excavated since 2004. It was built by Amanikhareqerem and is similar to the Temple of Natakamani and is dated to the 2nd or 3rd century AD, although some finds do not correspond to the precise dating, adding to an already fuzzy understanding of Nubian chronology. = Temple of Apedemak = Located to the west of the temple of Amun is the temple of Apedemak (or the Lion Temple). Apedemak was a lion-headed warrior god worshipped in Nubia. The god was used as a sacred guardian of the deceased hereditary chief, prince or king. Anyone who touched the chief's grave was said to be cursed by this Apedemak. The temple is considered a classic example of Kushite architecture. The front of the temple is an extensive gateway, and depicts Natakamani and Amanitore on the left and right exerting divine power over their prisoners, symbolically with lions at their feet. Who the prisoners are exactly is unclear, although historical records have revealed that the Kushites frequently clashed with invading desert clans. Towards the edges are fine representations of Apedemak who is represented by a snake emerging from a lotus flower. On the sides of the temple are depictions of the gods Amun, Horus and Apedemak keeping company in the presence of the king. On the rear wall of the temple is the largest depiction of the lion god, and is illustrated receiving offering from the king and queen. He is depicted as a three-headed god with four arms. The north- front shows the goddesses Isis, Mut, Hathor, Amesemi and Satet. Inside the temple is a carving of the god Serapis who is depicted with Greco-Roman style beard. Another god with a crown is depicted but is unidentified, but believed to be of Persian origin. Although the architecture of the main Apedemak temple is strongly influenced by Ancient Egyptian architecture, exhibiting some classic Egyptian forms, some of the depictions of the king and queen are fine examples of the differences between Egyptian and Kushite art. King Natakamani and Queen Amanitore are depicted with round heads and broad shoulders, with the relief of Amanitore having unusually wide hips, which is more typical of African art. So the temple of Apedemak illustrates profoundly the fusing together of artistic influences by the Kushites, especially when taking into account the nearby Roman kiosk which clearly is influenced by Ancient Greece and Rome (as discussed below). The depiction of Apedemak displaying a lotus flower is also somewhat unusual, and initially led early archaeologists of Naqa to speculate that the temple had Indian influences, given that trade routes from India led to the ancient Red Sea port of Adulis, in modern-day Eritrea. These connections are still being explored by modern archaeologists. Naga L√∂wentempel.jpgPylons depicting King Natakamani and Queen Amanitore smiting enemies.

The entrance to the kiosk is Egyptian and is topped by a lintel with a row of sacred uraeus (cobras) but the sides consists of columns with florid Corinthian capitals arched windows in the Roman style. Recent excavations at the building showed that it was probably devoted to the worship of Hathor. Testament to this is the discovery of a statue of Isis, a goddess in Ancient Egyptian religious beliefs, whose worship spread throughout the Greco-Roman world. Isis is the Goddess of motherhood and fertility who was worshiped as the ideal mother, wife, matron of nature and magic. The goddess Isis was known to have absorbed some characteristics of Hathor.  Other  Standing at the foot of the sandstone cliffs of Jabal Naqa is the temple named \\"500\\". It was built by Shanakdakhete around 135 BC, making it the oldest building on the site. The texts on the temple walls are the oldest known writings in Meroitic hieroglyphs. Judging by the reliefs, the temple was dedicated to the Theban triad of Amun, Mut, and Khonsu, as well as Apedemak. In 1834, Giuseppe Ferlini discovered treasure which was severely damaged. A thorough excavation and restoration has been made since.

Together with Th√©odore Gudin, he was appointed as one of France's first two Peintres de la Marine in 1830.Minist√®re de l'instruction publique et des beaux-arts; R√©union des soci√©t√©s des beaux-arts des d√©partements, vol.27e, 1903, No√©mi-Noire Oursel, editor Online  Biography  He studied marine painting with Joseph Vernet and landscapes with Hubert Robert. Before that, he had been a sailor with four years of experience as a helmsman and (a seaman in charge of the sails). He had his first exhibit at the Paris in 1796 with \\"La sortie du port de Brest\\". He would hold showings there intermittently until 1835. As early as 1817, he received a letter from the \\"Ministre de la Marine et des Colonies\\", Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr, giving him a twenty-year commission to create marine paintings for the government; especially the Minist√®re de la Marine, where he set up a workshop. This was, however, tempered by a disappointment; the position of painter to the Admiral of France (Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoul√™me) had gone to Louis Garneray. At the age of fifty-eight, in part due to a bit of self-promotion, he was appointed as one of the first two official marine painters of the French government. That same year, together with the much younger painters Eug√®ne Isabey and L√©on Morel-Fatio, he took part in the Invasion of Algiers. His new position eventually became somewhat ceremonial, as he ceased to exhibit in 1836. His best known painting is \\"Combat de la fr√©gate fran√ßaise La Bayonnaise contre la fr√©gate anglaise l‚ÄôEmbuscade 14 d√©cembre 1798\\", which was commissioned by Napoleon for display at the Tuileries. It was shown at the Salon in 1801. Until 1834, it was hung in the former residence of the Empress at the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Cloud, then was transferred to Versailles by King Louis Philippe I. Since 1935, it has been at the Mus√©e national de la Marine. He also was one of the fourteen artists who contributed to Episodes maritimes, along with Garneray, Gudin, Isabey, Biard and others, who have largely been forgotten.

The company was created in 2008 by Mike Michaud, Mike Ellis, and Bhargav Dronamraju. Channel Awesome operated the That Guy with the Glasses website (often abbreviated TGWTG) until late 2014, when it was phased into the Channel Awesome website. The site is best known for the comedic film review series Nostalgia Critic, starring Doug Walker. That Guy with the Glasses previously hosted fellow channels by Bar Fiesta, beginning in November 2009, and Blistered Thumbs, beginning in November 2010. Channel Awesome currently hosts a YouTube channel of the same name with an emphasis on content produced by Doug Walker and his brother Rob. After a series of scandals, nearly all affiliated creators severed ties with Channel Awesome and departed in April 2018. All of Channel Awesome's content was hosted by Blip or YouTube prior to the former's shutdown in August 2015. Origins Mike Michaud, Mike Ellis and Bhargav Dronamraju created Channel Awesome after they were laid off from Circuit City in 2007. The three discussed the idea of such a company while still employed, but their dismissal was the impetus to put their plans into action. Michaud has stated that \\"if [they] didn't lose our jobs, [the business] wouldn't have happened anytime soon\\". At around the same time, Doug Walker, an actor, comedian, writer, and film critic, began posting several satirical video reviews of films and other media on YouTube under the web name \\"Nostalgia Critic\\". Initially, Walker viewed making the videos as a side hobby, rarely interacting with his fans and not revealing his real name until a video responding to the Northern Illinois University shooting. Walker's channel had its content withdrawn from YouTube following complaints from 20th Century Fox and Lionsgate over alleged copyright infringement. Walker attempted to re-upload his content by assigning each video a new, separate channel. However, due to continuing issues, Walker decided to leave YouTube altogether and create the website That Guy with the Glasses, with Michaud acting as webmaster. That Guy with the Glasses That Guy with the Glasses was launched in April 2008. It showcased satirical reviews of movies, television shows, music, comic books and video games. The website was built around the work of Walker, including Nostalgia Critic (comedic recaps of bad movies), 5 Second Movies (hyper-edited feature films), Ask That Guy with the Glasses (a comedy question and answer show) and Bum Reviews (humorous plot summaries of theatrical releases). Other videos and written articles were hosted on the site, including some minor series and sketches starring Walker. Videos were primarily hosted by Blip after problems with earlier provider Revver. The website featured videos from a number of other content creators who were steadily added as contributors over the course of several years. In December 2008, Walker appeared in a commercial for the PBS documentary Make 'Em Laugh: The Funny Business of America, performing a series of brief imitations of famous comedians, from Charlie Chaplin to Stephen Colbert. In 2009, Doug and Rob Walker, along with Brian Heinz, produced an iRiff of The Lion King for RiffTrax. In March 2009, the iRiff was chosen as the winner of the website's RiffTrax Presents contest. The performers received $1,000 and, with instruction from Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett, recorded a commentary for the film Batman Forever. Nostalgia Critic averaged 100,000 to 300,000 viewers per week while on the site, and one million page views per month. This was expected to increase following Blip's deal with YouTube in July 2009. As of July 2009, the site earned more than $10,000 per month in advertising revenue and received more than $11,000 in online donations. In the third quarter of the 2009 fiscal year, Walker's shows earned $53,000, including $32,000 from Nostalgia Critic alone. This revenue was generated by run of network from Puma and Starburst. The success of his shows has allowed Walker to make a living performing and to quit his previous job as an illustrator, as well as pay the salary of Ellis, the site's co-founder and COO. The site was featured in Entrepreneur magazine on December 2009 where the history of the site was discussed as well as the plans for the future. A \\"team shot\\" of Channel Awesome producers with the president of the Republic of Molossia Kevin Baugh, c. the 2010 filming of their 2nd anniversary feature- length special Kickassia During 2011, Michaud was looking for warehouse space in suburban Chicago. He told The New York Times, \\"My company has a lot of growing up to do, but I believe that sometime in the next one to two years someone will create that one series that gets everyone talking... [and attract audiences] to the endless options of online video.\\" As of June 2011, the company employed seven full-time staff. According to Walker, \\"these people are cheap to get because we are happy to see any amount of money\\". Channel Awesome's ability to attract a significant audience with a low expenditure was proclaimed to have an effect on video entertainment production. The site gained a wealth of personalities and shows, quickly reaching twenty plus. The first time the producers made an initiative to put each other in the same fictional universe (or \\"Reviewaverse\\", as was coined by one of its former producers) was with their first anniversary video, which was a twenty-minute fight between each other, with set up and dialogue only stating it was video game reviewers vs. movie reviewers, egged on by the Nostalgia Critic and Angry Video Game Nerd rivalry that had been going at the time. A full-length site crossover movie was decided for the next year's anniversary. It ended up being a trilogy: Kickassia, which had the plot of the Critic getting a number of the personalities together to take over a micronation in Nevada; Suburban Knights, where the Critic got together much of the same personalities to find a mystical gauntlet via forced LARPing; and To Boldly Flee, where the Critic and TGWTGs cast travel to space to stop a cosmic anomaly and fight corporate villains. On June 28, 2012, Channel Awesome content producers Walker, Lindsay Ellis (The Nostalgia Chick; no relation to Mike Ellis), Brad Jones (The Cinema Snob) and Todd Nathanson (Todd in the Shadows) signed exclusivity deals with Blip, which directly hosted most TGWTG and Channel Awesome programming until it was shut down in August 2015. The deal did not affect the appearance of the producers' videos on TGWTG, and would assist the increase of budget of the four series, as well as provide technical improvements. An extension of this deal was a Blip-run YouTube channel called \\"League of Super Critics\\", which also uploaded the unedited videos of all four producers, with the exception of Jones, whose videos were edited down from the original version so that the only way one could see the full video was to go to Blip. On December 3, 2014, the site shut down and rebranded itself as ChannelAwesome.com. Subdivisions  Channel Awesome expressed plans to build on the success of That Guy with the Glasses with a network of subdivisions of the Channel Awesome website, including Bar Fiesta for covering Chicago entertainment and nightlife, and Inked Reality for anime and comic books. Blistered Thumbs began in 2009 as a subdivision of That Guy with the Glasses for housing its video game content. It gained popularity and Blistered Thumbs launched as its own website on November 4, 2010. Joe Vargas (Angry Joe), already an established video game reviewer on That Guy with the Glasses, was the initial editor-in-chief. Staff writers were drawn from various websites including That Guy with the Glasses, TechRaptor and Normal Boots. Austin Yorski eventually replaced Vargas as editor-in-chief. In late November 2014, the Blistered Thumbs website was shut down. ChannelAwesome.com The new Channel Awesome website debuted in late 2014. All content from TGWTG was relocated to the newly established ChannelAwesome.com. Each week there is a Spotlight Section to promote a website producer, as well as a Featured Blogger. In January 2015, four of the site's long-time associates departed, including Andrew Dickman, Kyle Kallgren (Oancitizen), Allison Pregler (Obscurus Lupa) and Phelan Porteus (Phelous). Dickman, Porteus and Pregler went to being exclusively on Phelan's site, Phelous.com, while Kyle went to producing videos exclusively for Chez Apocalypse. Later that same month, Lindsay Ellis ended her long-running show The Nostalgia Chick, which had premiered as a companion show to Nostalgia Critic in September 2008.First Nostalgia Chick Episode She intended to continue producing videos for League of Super Critics on YouTube and her own website, Chez Apocalypse. Noah Antwiler, and his reviewer persona \\"The Spoony One\\", went to being exclusively on his site, The Spoony Experiment, a little before the fourth anniversary film, but still had a prominent role in it with his consent. Long-running shows=Nostalgia Critic= Nostalgia Critic is the most popular video series created by Doug Walker, in which he plays the titular reviewer. The show is written by him and his brother Rob Walker. The series was initially launched on YouTube before moving to Blip TV in 2008. It is the flagship show for Channel Awesome, which has since built on it with additional content, additional websites and the spin-off show Nostalgia Chick. = Atop the Fourth Wall= Atop the Fourth Wall (AT4W for short) was the leading comic book review show on the site, hosted by Minnesota native Lewis \\"Linkara\\" Lovhaug. His nickname came from a character he created when he was a teen, writing amateur fantasy novels. His show is one of the tamer in tone on the site, as Lewis has one of the more wholesome and light-hearted personalities, and does not use strong profanity on the show. Being one of the bigger patrons of sci-fi and fantasy shows and movies, such as Doctor Who, Star Trek, Babylon 5, etc., he is one of the strongest users of a story-line, which he features in the same videos as his reviews, where he is an important and high-ranking agent against paranormal and extraterrestrial threats in the Channel Awesome universe. He is also a major fan of Power Rangers and Pok√©mon, and once featured the glitch MissingNo. as a villain on his show. He also hosts a separate show where he discusses the history of Power Rangers. In March 2018, Lovhaug announced on his website that he had left Channel Awesome. =The Angry Joe Show= Jose \\"Angry Joe\\" Antonio Vargas hosts the leading video game review show on the site. It generally consists of reviews by Vargas stating his honest opinions of current releases of video games, mixed with sketch comedy. These include recent troubles he sees in the games industry such as title exclusivity to a certain console, cutting off previously present and willing buyers, done due to what he says is the misguided preference of console producers' money as opposed to consumers' money; and what he observes as triple-A game producers taking compatible parts of what used to be a finished game only months before release, and releasing them later as downloadable content, in order to artificially increase profit. The show has a satirical running gag of Vargas fighting \\"The Corporate Commander\\" (a spoof of The Cobra Commander from G.I. Joe), a masked villain who wishes to ruin the gaming community by forcing them to pay substantial amounts of money for subpar games. Vargas is the founder of \\"The Angry Army\\", a community specializing in online gaming. In April 2018, Vargas announced his departure from the Channel Awesome website. =Todd in the Shadows= Todd in the Shadows is a music review show created and presented by Todd Nathanson. The show's primary focus is on its three main series: Todd's Pop Song Reviews, in which Nathanson reviews songs that, at the time of review, were or had recently been high-charting; One Hit Wonderland, in which he examines and chronicles the careers of one-hit wonders; and Trainwreckords, in which he analyzes albums considered to have \\"ended [the] thriving careers\\" of their respective artists. Cinemadonna, in which Nathanson reviews Madonna's feature filmography, was one of the show's main series until its conclusion in 2016. In the show, Nathanson keeps his appearance anonymous, filming himself in silhouette while sitting at an electronic keyboard in a dark room. When his face is not in silhouette, he covers its upper half with a black cloth. Nathanson debuted the series in 2009 and joined That Guy with the Glasses the following year. In March 2018, he announced his departure from Channel Awesome on his Twitter account. =The Cinema Snob= The Cinema Snob stars Brad Jones as a pretentious art critic who watches and comments on obscure exploitation films and pornography, the majority of which were released between the late 1960s through the early 1990s. His association with Channel Awesome began with \\"E.T. The Porno\\" (January 7, 2010). Like many other shows on Channel Awesome, Jones started his show on YouTube until he was confronted with a copyright claim from the filmmakers of Nail Gun Massacre. Jones has also created additional shows for Channel Awesome, including Brad Tries and Midnight Screenings. Awards On January 6, 2011, Doug Walker was awarded Entrepreneur of the Year in Las Vegas at the 4th Annual Mashable Awards. Activism On December 5, 2009, the company held a donation drive for the Ronald McDonald House Charities. The donation drive lasted upwards of seven hours and raised $26,400. During the event, calls were taken, prizes were awarded to people who donated large sums of money and videos featuring the talent on the site were aired. The donation drive was extended a few more days making the grand total $32,200. On December 15, 2011, Lindsay Ellis posted a video about Channel Awesome staff traveling to Washington, D.C. to lobby members of Congress about the Stop Online Piracy Act and the PROTECT IP Act. Ellis, Michaud, Rob Walker, and content producers Noah Antwiler (The Spoony One), Kyle Kallgren (Oancitizen and Brows Held High), Lewis Lovhaug (Linkara), Todd Nathanson (Todd in the Shadows), Paul Schuler (Paw Dugan) and Joe Vargas (Angry Joe) all traveled to Washington, D.C. to represent Channel Awesome and support freedom of speech on the internet. Management controversy=Initial allegations= Between October 2014 and January 2015, several long- time content producers departed from Channel Awesome. In March 2018, several former producers alleged, via a series of Twitter posts, mismanagement and mistreatment by members of Channel Awesome's upper management, including the Walker brothers and Michaud. The allegations included a history of sexist behavior by Michaud toward female producers, incompetence by the Walker brothers during production of the company's anniversary films, and failure to communicate with producers about significant decisions affecting them. One such allegation from Lindsay Ellis stated that during production on the film To Boldly Flee, she was repeatedly pressured into looping a scene in which her character was implied to be raped off-screen by Lewis Lovhaug's character. She further alleged that due to her and Lovhaug's protests over the scene's content, Doug Walker rewrote it so the implication of assault was less implicit. Ellis said that she was forced to perform the scene under intimidation. In March and April 2018, several more producers‚Äîincluding Lovhaug (Linkara), Todd Nathanson (Todd in the Shadows), Daren Jackson (Rap Critic) and Mike Jeavons (MikeJ)‚Äîdeparted from Channel Awesome. =Further departures= On April 2, 2018, a group of former Channel Awesome contributors and employees publicly released a document, entitled \\"Not So Awesome\\", via Google Drive. The document compiled grievances against the company, both those that had been previously made and ones that had not yet been publicly known. Over twenty former producers and employees, along with two individuals whose identities were kept anonymous, provided various allegations that were included in the document. The subsequent response from Channel Awesome was criticized by fans and the company's former producers, as they felt the company was not apologizing or taking responsibility for their wrongdoings. On that and the following days, more producers, including Omar Ahmed (Yomarz), Nash Bozard, Mathew Buck (Film Brain), Tony Goldmark (Some Jerk with a Camera), Elisa Hansen (Maven), Brian Heinz (The Last Angry Geek), Leeman Kessler (Ask Lovecraft), Heather McDonald (Calluna), Dominic Smith (The Dom), Luke Spencer (Rocked) and Chris Stuckmann left Channel Awesome, with some citing their dissatisfaction with the company's response to the controversy as their reason for doing so, lowering the number of producers for the website from forty to about ten by April 5. Channel Awesome's planned tenth anniversary was cancelled as a result of the controversy. =Second response and fallout= On April 11, 2018, Channel Awesome released a second response to the allegations as a blog post on its website. Titled \\"Our Response\\", the post was intended to refute the \\"most egregious\\" of the allegations made by former producers, Holly Brown and Jane Doe, who are described within it as \\"disgruntled individuals with vindictive intentions\\". Within 48 hours of the response's posting, nearly all of Channel Awesome's remaining producers, including long-time veterans Joe Vargas (Angry Joe), Bennett White (Bennett the Sage) and Lawrence Simpson (MasakoX), as well as Gaming Wildlife, Bargain Boy, Ryan Molina (Battle Geek Plus), Timid Jester, DToons Productions (maker of the series Toons These Days) and Eric Rodriguez (Blockbuster Buster), also left the website. Since April 14, 2018, the website listed two remaining producers apart from the Walkers: Brad Jones (Cinema Snob) and Larry Bundy Jr. (Guru Larry); the latter stated that among his reasons for remaining were that \\"no one ever actually believed [he] was ever on TGWTG\\".

Later Meng Hongsheng set up chain stores in cities such as Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin and began to extend his business into the market for luxury items like silk, satin, tea, and furs). Most of the store names such as Ruifuxiang, Qianxiangyi, Quanxiang, Longxiang, Hongxiang, Ruishengxiang, Qingxiang contained the character \\"Xiang\\" () and were hence collectively known as the \\"Xiang stores\\". The name Ruifuxiang alludes to the \\"Qingfu\\" (), a legendary insect that could bring wealth, and also appears on some versions of the Rui Fu Xiang logo. In 1862, the Mengs opened the Ruifuxiang store in the western part of Jinan that traded mainly in silk and satins. A branch in Beijing followed one year later. This branch store was destroyed in 1900, when the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded Beijing to put down the Boxer Rebellion. It was rebuilt shortly thereafter. Business peaked in the 1920s and 1930, when Meng Luochuan was at the helm of the family enterprise. By the 1940s, the Meng family business was made up of more than 96 stores and other ventures. These included 50 silk and 20 tea stores as well as pawnshops and banks. The Meng businesses were located in places such as Jinan, Qingdao, Yantai, Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, Shenyang, Harbin, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Fujian Province. The first flag of People's Republic of China raised in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on 1 October 1949 was made from Ruifuxiang silk.

She retired after one game citing the resentment of other umpires. Life Born in Ernest, Pennsylvania and one of five children, Gera loved baseball as a child and grew up playing as an outfielder and umpiring games. She never considered a career in baseball until she was already in her mid-thirties, married, living in Jackson Heights, New York, and working as a secretary. According to a Time article, the idea to become an umpire just suddenly hit her one night and saw her work umpiring games in slums as \\"a form of social welfare\\", as having a woman on the field would lead to \\"less trouble\\" and encourage other women to attend the games. Gera sold her husband, a free-lance photographer, on the idea and enrolled in the Florida Baseball School in . As umpiring had been a strictly male profession up to that point, the school had no facilities for Gera, and she spent much of the six-week program living in a nearby motel. By several reports, she excelled in her training, yet Gera was rejected by the National Association of Baseball Leagues (NABL), which claimed that she did not meet the physical requirements of the job. Ed Doherty, a baseball executive, claimed that umpires needed to be 21‚Äì35 years old, a minimum of 5 foot 10 inches tall, and weigh 170 pounds while Gera was only 5 foot 2, 38 years old, and 126 pounds. Gera even had prior experience umpiring for the National Baseball Congress in Bridgeton, New Jersey as well as in \\"recreational programs in the slums\\", but this was not enough to get her a job. Unable to gain employment as a female umpire, on March 19, 1969, Gera filed a sex discrimination case under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act with the New York State Human Rights Commission. In her complaint, she accused both the New York Professional Baseball League and its president, Vincent McNamara, of not employing her as an umpire due to her sex. In his rejection of Gera's application, McNamara cited single-gender dressing rooms and foul language on the field as reasons why females should not umpire games. Undeterred, Gera fought the NABL in court for five years. Representative Mario Biaggi (D., N.Y.), represented Gera legally in court and, using Gera's story as inspiration, even introduced an equal rights Constitutional amendment to the House during his time in Congress. On January 13, , Gera finally won a discrimination suit against the NABL, winning approval in The Court of Appeals in a 5-to-2 decision. Though she was not a member of women's liberation group, she was a \\"stanch adherent of work equality\\" and viewed this as a huge victory. She then received a contract to work in the New York‚ÄìPenn League on April 13, opening the door for her to become the first female umpire in professional baseball. On June 23, 1972, she gained national attention when she umpired the first game of a Class A minor league doubleheader between the Geneva Senators and Auburn Twins. The game was a near sellout with 2,000 people attending the game at Shuron Park in Geneva, N.Y. In the fourth inning, Gera ruled Auburn base-runner Terry Ford safe at second on a double play, then reversed her call. Auburn manager Nolan Campbell disputed the decision and said that Gera's first mistake was putting on an umpire's uniform and her second was blowing the call. Campbell was ejected from the game, but Gera still decided to resign between games, which was later said to be planned, saying she became disenchanted with umpiring when the other umpires refused to cooperate with her on the field. She was scheduled to be the home plate umpire for the second game. Gera cites the \\"cool resentment\\" of both the other umpires and the baseball establishment as a motivation for her decision to resign, not her dispute with Auburn manager Nolan Campbell. This, combined with both verbal, written and physical \\"threats\\" \\"disgusted\\" her and contributed to her disillusionment with baseball culture. Eight men, for example, allegedly shattered the light outside Gera's motel room and cursed at her the night before she umpired her first game, perceiving her as an \\"attack on baseball's male fraternity. Though she resigned not long after becoming an umpire, Gera saw this as a larger, symbolic victory for women participating in sports historically perceived as \\"for men only.\\" \\"Bernice would always say, 'I could beat them in the courts, but I can't beat them on the field,'\\" Steve Gera, her husband, quoted his wife as saying. Although she stopped umpiring, Bernice Gera stayed in the game. She went to work for the New York Mets in the team's community relations and promotions from to before retiring to Florida. Bernice died of kidney cancer in 1992 in Memorial Hospital West in Pembroke Pines, Florida at 61 years old.

Northstar Island is a artificial island in the Beaufort Sea, northwest of Prudhoe Bay, Alaska and north of the Alaska coast.Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. \\"Northstar Unit, Northstar Oil Pool\\", State of Alaska. July 25, 2005. Accessed July 29, 2009. The island was created to develop the Northstar Oil Pool, which is located approximately below the seabed. The oil pool was discovered on January 30, 1984 by Royal Dutch Shell. A small artificial island was built at the site to house an exploration oil well. After additional exploration, Alaska International Construction began construction of the island in the winter of 1999-2000. A standard oil-drilling platform, such as those used in the Gulf of Mexico, was not feasible because of the annual formation of pack ice close to the northern Alaska coast. A stable, year-round artificial island was the only way to provide the permanent structures needed for a production oil well. To protect against the erosive force of masses of ice, the island's shores were covered in concrete mats that extend above the average waterline and below it.Mason, Owen K., Neal, William J., Pilkey, Orrin H., and Bullock, Jane. Living with the Coast of Alaska. Duke University Press, 1997. p. 140 Because of its distance from shore, no causeway could be built to the island, unlike with previous projects such as the creation of Endicott Island. Northstar Island thus became the first drilling operation in the Beaufort Sea to use a subsea pipeline to transport oil to shore and then into the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \\"Taking marine mammals incidental to construction and operation of offshore oil and gas facilities in the Beaufort Sea\\", Department of Commerce. July 25, 2005. Accessed July 30, 2009. Through 2000 and 2001, construction continued. In the winter, an ice road was built across the frozen Beaufort Sea. In the summer, barges brought supplies.Murphy, Kim. \\"Arctic oil pipeline brings out activists, supporters\\", Los Angeles Times. April 29, 2000. Accessed July 30, 2009. During the first winter of construction, more than of gravel was brought in from the Alaska mainland over ice roads to bring the island above sea level. To reach the seabed, workers had to cut blocks of frozen Beaufort Sea ice and remove them with cranes.Nelson, Kristen. \\"BP spending three-quarters of a million dollars a day at Northstar\\", Petroleum News. March 28, 2000. Accessed July 30, 2009. Similar techniques had to be used as workers trenched the seafloor for the three pipelines connecting the island to the shore. The pipes were welded and placed in the trenches more than below the seabed. The trenches were then filled by the special floating backhoes that dug them. Because the Northstar Oil Pool is under high pressure, two pipelines were required: one to take oil away from Northstar, and the other to take natural gas to it to provide pressurization as oil is extracted.Nelson, Kristen. \\"BP spending three-quarters of a million dollars a day at Northstar\\", Petroleum News. May 28, 2000. Accessed July 30, 2009. By the time the winter ice melted, the island was above sea level, and both pipelines were in place and tested. In the summer of 2000, an equipment barge arrived at the island with the first modular buildings for the site, but not until a short delay was caused by Greenpeace activists who occupied the barge for 39 hours in Barrow.Nelson, Kristen. \\"Northstar-bound barge heads for island ‚Äî again\\", Petroleum News.

The YANG data modeling language is maintained by the NETMOD working group in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and was published as RFC 6020 in October 2010. The data modeling language can be used to model both configuration data as well as state data of network elements. Furthermore, YANG can be used to define the format of event notifications emitted by network elements and it allows data modelers to define the signature of remote procedure calls that can be invoked on network elements via the NETCONF protocol. The language, being protocol independent, can then be converted into any encoding format, e.g. XML or JSON, that the network configuration protocol supports. YANG is a modular language representing data structures in an XML tree format. The data modeling language comes with a number of built-in data types. Additional application specific data types can be derived from the built-in data types. More complex reusable data structures can be represented as groupings. YANG data models can use XPATH expressions to define constraints on the elements of a YANG data model. History Many network management protocols have associated data modeling languages. The first widely deployed Internet standard for network management was the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The data modeling language associated with SNMP was called the Structure of Management Information (SMI). The SMI language itself was based on the 1988 version of the Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1). The current version of the SMI language, SMIv2 defined in RFC 2578, RFC 2579, RFC 2580, has developed into an extended subset of ASN.1. In the late 1990s, a project was started to create a replacement for SMIv2, which was called SMIng. One motivation was to decouple SMIng from the management protocol SNMP and to give SMIng a syntactic structure that is both easy to parse for computer programs and easy to learn for people familiar with programming languages that use a C-like notation. While the SMIng project did not succeed in the IETF, the SMIng specifications were published as experimental documents in May 2004 (RFC 3780, RFC 3781). Soon after the development of the NETCONF protocol in the IETF, it became clear that a data modeling language was needed to define data models manipulated by the NETCONF protocol. A design team created a proposal that became the basis of the YANG language. The syntactic structure and the base type system was essentially borrowed from SMIng. However, based on the lessons learned from the SMIng project, no attempts were made to make YANG protocol neutral. Instead, YANG ties into concepts of the NETCONF protocol, such as the assumption that data model instances can be serialized into XML. Standardization of YANG started with the formation of the NETMOD working group in April 2008. The YANG 1.0 specification was published as RFC 6020 in October 2010. Recently, the NETMOD working group has been working on YANG 1.1, which has been published in August 2016 in RFC 7950. Example The following YANG module \`example-sports\` shows a data model for team sports. The module declares a namespace and a prefix and imports the type library module \`ietf-yang-types\` before defining the type \`season\`.

George Brooke Roberts (January 15, 1833 - January 30, 1897) was a civil engineer and the fifth president of the Pennsylvania Railroad (1880‚Äì96). Career Born at Pencoyd, his family's ancestral farm in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, Roberts graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1849, and taught there for two years before becoming a rodman for the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). From 1852 he worked for the Philadelphia & Erie Railroad, returning to the PRR in 1862 as assistant to the president, J. Edgar Thomson. Roberts oversaw the construction of bridges and other engineering work, including the Connecting Railway Bridge over Schuylkill River in Philadelphia (attributed to John A. Wilson, 1866‚Äì67) that connected PRR's southern and northern lines. He became a PRR vice-president in 1869, and succeeded Thomas A. Scott as PRR president in 1880. =Broad Street Station= Broad Street Station, Broad & Market Streets, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1881, expanded 1892-93, demolished 1953). As PRR First Vice-President, Roberts oversaw the construction of Broad Street Station, a seminal event in Philadelphia history. Before this, PRR locomotives did not cross the Schuylkill River, but deposited passengers at West Philadelphia Station (32nd Street) where horse-drawn streetcars brought them into Center City. Construction of a new bridge and a 10-block viaduct - the \\"Chinese Wall\\" - carried the PRR tracks two stories above street level and into the Wilson Brothers-designed station at Broad Street. With the 1871 decision to build Philadelphia City Hall, the 1876 opening of merchant John Wanamaker's department store to the east, and the 1881 opening of the PRR station to the west, the center of Philadelphia's business district rapidly moved to Broad & Market Streets. The station's location at the heart of the city made commuting via the PRR practicable, fueling massive suburban growth (especially on the Main Line). By 1886, the station saw a million passengers a month. In 1889, a freight depot was built along the \\"Chinese Wall\\" at 19th Street, so the station could be devoted just to passengers. In 1892, Roberts hired architect Frank Furness to greatly expand Broad Street Station, consolidating PRR offices in a single building and turning it into the largest passenger terminal in the world. =PRR expansion= Roberts's first major accomplishment as PRR president was the 1881 purchase of a majority stake in the Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore Railroad, which froze the rival Baltimore & Ohio Railroad out of a direct Philadelphia-Washington, D.C. route that had previously rented trackage rights to both railroads. The acquisition gave the PRR a direct line from New York City (actually Jersey City, New Jersey, until 1911) to Washington. Amtrak uses this same route today. Competition between the PRR and the New York Central Railroad was fierce. William H. Vanderbilt and Andrew Carnegie began construction of the South Pennsylvania Railroad across Pennsylvania to directly compete with the PRR's Main Line. In response, Roberts bought up land on the west side of the Hudson River for the West Shore Railroad, to directly compete with the NYCR on the east side. J. P. Morgan saw this as wasteful competition and negotiated an 1885 truce between Vanderbilt and Roberts, in which each abandoned the competing line. Vanderbilt's line became the right- of-way for the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and Roberts's line for the Palisades Parkway. In 1887, the PRR introduced direct service from New York City to Chicago, Illinois. The Pennsylvania Limited made the trip in 24 hours by way of Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. By 1902, an express train was introduced, the Pennsylvania Special, that cut the time to 20 hours. The 1889 Johnstown Flood occurred during Roberts's presidency. The PRR's Stone Bridge over the Conemaugh River in Johnstown acted as a dam, trapping debris that covered 30 acres (and soon caught fire). The PRR was a major participant in the rescue effort. It reopened its line to Pittsburgh within 3 days, and was the primary means by which relief workers and provisions reached the victims of the disaster. The Stone Bridge still stands today. =Legacy= Roberts greatly expanded the PRR, investing more than $50,000,000 in roadways and equipment - more than all his predecessors combined - and increasing PRR holdings to about $115,000,000 through mergers and purchases of affiliated companies. By the end of his 16-year term as president, the Pennsylvania Railroad was the largest private employer in the United States and the largest business corporation in the world. General Map of the Pennsylvania Railroad and Its Connections (1893). PRR routes are outlined in black. Family Roberts's ancestors had been among the founders of Pennsylvania. The first emigrant, John Roberts, bought a parcel along the Schuylkill River in 1682, and built a house two years later that he named \\"Pencoyd\\". This was part of the \\"Welsh Barony\\", a tract bought by Welsh investors from William Penn. The \\"Welsh Barony\\" made up much of the Philadelphia suburban region now known as the Main Line, named for the Main Line of Public Works, a cross-state rail- and-canal system that ran through it. Roberts was the sixth proprietor of Pencoyd, and proud of his Welsh heritage. He chose Welsh names for some of the suburban PRR stations, including Bala and Cynwyd. Roberts hired Frank Furness to expand the family house at Pencoyd in 1883, and in 1890 the architect designed the PRR's second Bryn Mawr Hotel (now the Baldwin School). Theophilus Parsons Chandler, Jr. designed St. Asaph's Church, at the southern end of Roberts's farm. Author Nathaniel Burt quipped: \\"The Church of St. Asaph, dedicated, as the saying goes, to the Glory of God and the convenience of the Roberts family.\\"Nathaniel Burt, The Perennial Philadelphians (1963), p. 192. In 1868, Roberts married Sarah Brinton, who died the following year after giving birth to George Brinton Roberts. In 1874, he married Miriam Pyle Williams, and the couple had five children: Algernon Brooke Roberts, T. Williams Roberts, Elizabeth Williams Roberts (who married Percy H. Clark of the Clark banking family), Isaac Warner Roberts, and Miriam Williams Roberts (married Spencer Ervin). Miriam Roberts died in 1913. T. Williams Roberts became the seventh proprietor of Pencoyd, removed all the Frank Furness alterations to the house, and lived there until his death in 1962. Pencoyd was sold, and demolished by developers in 1964.

This congregation was founded as St. Luke's Protestant Episcopal Church in 1842 following the failure of Trinity Church, which had been consecrated in the same building on June 1, 1835, by Bishop Onderdonk of the Diocese of Long Island. The founding of a church in this location resulted from the expansion of Brooklyn beyond initial European settlement in Brooklyn Heights. The building was constructed on a property consisting of eight city lots donated by George W. Pine. The congregation's building eventually grew to be the largest in the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island. It merged with the St. Matthew's Episcopal Church in 1943, and the Church of St. Michael and St. Mark in 1993.  Church building = 1835 building = The original building of St. Luke's Protestant Episcopal Church on Clinton Avenue was constructed in 1835 by Elias Combs, building and hardware merchant, Trinity Church. His widow charged in 1846 that Mr. Combs had not been paid for the construction of this building. She stated that when Trinity Church declared bankruptcy around 1841, and had their mortgage foreclosed on and subsequently dissolved, this allowed the building to be purchased below market value by a new church organization incorporated as \\"St. Luke's Church\\" which no longer had any record of debt to Mr. Combs or his widow. Mrs. Combs' accusation was confirmed by other Episcopalian churches in Brooklyn, as well as by a local Brooklyn judge. St. Luke's Church released a statement in response to this, claiming that there had been no malicious attempt to allow mortgage foreclosure in order to avoid paying the builder, but rather that the entire situation had occurred through mismanagement of Trinity Church. The church also stated that, after purchasing the building, St. Luke's Church had offered Mrs. Combs compensation by giving her one of the best pews in the church as well as a deed to the vault containing her late husband's remains. A fire was attempted on the building on June 27, 1846 but was detected before any major damage was caused, and a $200 reward was offered by the Mayor of Brooklyn for conviction of the perpetrators. The steeple of the church was struck by lightning in 1856, tearing away woodwork but not causing structural damage. Major repairs and alterations in 1880 included an enlarged vestibule and new front porch; altered shape of the gallery; and transformation of the old rectory into a parish hall. In 1881, an anonymous donor provided funding for a new chapel and Sunday school building behind the main church edifice, on Vanderbilt Avenue. This new chapel was consecrated in October 1882. In 1883, the congregation expanded its property holdings along Clinton Avenue, purchasing the house at 520 Clinton Ave, adjacent to its parish building, as a home for the rector. A major fire in November 1887, following all of this expansion and caused by a defective furnace duct, resulted in the destruction of the organ and altar as well as the chancel of the original church; the original building remained intact in spite of damage, however, and continued to be used for Sunday services while a new Sunday school building and parish hall were built. = 1888 building = The church building in 1888. The church's current building at 520 Clinton Avenue in Brooklyn, New York was built in 1888-91 and was designed by John Welch in the Romanesque Revival style. p.644 See also: The AIA Guide to New York City describes the building's \\"great facade\\" as \\"Eclecticism gone berserk,\\" while the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission's Guide to New York City Landmarks calls it \\"one of the grandest ecclesiastical buildings in Brooklyn.\\" p.245 The building was designated a New York City Landmark in 1981 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The construction of this building, following the 1887 fire, included a new $6,000 organ that was donated by a congregation member and installed in 1889, as well as a new Sunday school building and parish hall. After this initial construction was completed and the church could use these buildings for services, the old stone church which had been damaged in the fire was dismantled and a new building, completed in 1891 and seating 1,500 people, was erected. This construction project resulted in a mortgage that was still $33,000 in 1892, and was paid off by 1896 due to the fundraising efforts of its members. Most of the windows in the nave were also installed in 1896, and were crafted by Tiffany. The rose window was installed in 1890 as a gift from the Sunday school children. A major fire in 1914 destroyed the interior of this building and caused sections of the roof to collapse, but the outer walls remained intact. Damage was estimated at $300,000. = 1915 reconstruction = Following the March 1914 fire, the church was reconstructed using the outer walls of the former building, largely along the same design as the original but with an enlarged Sunday school and redesigned parish hall. The building remained under heavy scaffolding for the following year and reopened on September 19, 1915 in time for re-consecration on October 19, 1915. The organ was rebuilt in Hagerston, Maryland, and was designed to be the largest in the city, with four manuals and sixty stops. In the early morning of December 23, 2012, the building was damaged by a fire.2-alarm historic church fire called 'suspicious' WABC-TV Damage was contained largely to the foyer and entry doors, and the church facade. Funding from a Department of Environmental Protection Green Infrastructure Grant allowed for 2017 improvements to the front sidewalk area of the church, with installation of a rain garden and permeable pavement project to capture rain runoff. In 2018, the church began work to sell air rights for construction of a nearby residential high rise, with proceeds from the sale paying for facade reconstruction and other repairs and improvements on the aging building in keeping with its Landmark status. Rezoning for this project was approved in 2019.  Church activities = Free Church status = While the congregation of St. Luke's experienced financial difficulty from its outset from purchasing a building, its debts of over $12,000 were paid off by 1864 and, in 1869, St. Luke's became what was known as a \\"free church\\", which is to say that no pews were rented, and anyone could attend for free. St. Lukes was viewed as \\"a most remarkable example of the success of the free church system\\". = Creation of additional Brooklyn churches = In 1883, St. Luke's decided to expand its work by setting up a chapel at another location in Brooklyn; in May 1884, this was established as St. Luke's Chapel in a former Congregational Church building on Pacific Street near Bedford Avenue. St. Lukes Church worked to erect a new building in 1886, and it eventually became an independent parish as St. Bartholomew's Church. = Music = The church established a choir from very early on; in 1865, they were operating under organist and choirmaster H. Hamilton. In November 1865, women of the church organized a fair to raise funds for the organ. By January 1866, a new organ had been installed and a concert was held with the choir of Trinity Church, New York, to dedicate it. This organ, built by R. Widmer of Brooklyn, was at the time one of the largest in the city. It underwent extensive repairs in 1879. The church boasted three choirs‚Äîa church choir, chapel choir, and Sunday school choir‚Äîby 1885. Charles O. Banks was appointed choirmaster and organist in 1924. While music had been part of parish life before Mr. Banks appointment to this position, he was known for his skill as organist and for the regular series of organ recitals organized by him at St. Luke's. Banks also oversaw the creation of a Choir Alumni association in 1938. = Merger of St. Luke's Protestant Episcopal Church with St. Matthew's Episcopal Church = In 1943, St. Luke's Protestant Episcopal Church was merged by order of the New York Supreme Court with St. Matthew's Episcopal Church, originally of Throop Avenue and then, after merger with the Church of the Epiphany, of Tompkins Ave at McDonough Street. The merged churches, under the name of the Church of St. Luke and St. Matthew, continued to worship in the building of St. Luke's on Clinton Ave with Charles Banks as organist. St. Matthew's Church brough a stained glass window os the Apostle Matthew from its previous building; this is installed in the chapel of the present building. While this merger is credited to decreased attendance and shifting neighborhood populations, St. Matthew's Episcopal Church had also been embroiled in deep public controversy after its former rector, William S. Blackshear, stated explicitly in local press that the church wanted to remain white and was not interested in attracting any people of color from the neighborhood's changing population. While Rev. Blackshear's vestry stood by this opinion, he was deeply criticized by both the bishop of the Diocese as well as by William Pickens and James Weldon Johnson of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. = Occupy Sandy = The Church of St. Luke and St. Matthew building served as Brooklyn headquarters for Occupy Sandy relief efforts, with volunteers using the space to collect and sort material to aid Hurricane Sandy victims. In 2015, the congregation of the nearby Church of the Redeemer merged with the Church of St. Luke and St. Matthew after the sale of its building.  Clergy  *Rev. Dr. D.V.M.

Ena No√´l's name is synonymous in Australia with children's literature and with IBBY, the International Board on Books for Young People. In Australia, she is still affectionately known as 'Mrs IBBY'. Early life Ena was born in Sydney on 30 July 1910 to Russian immigrant parents. From childhood Ena developed an interest in all forms of art and literature, especially music, theatre and dance. Inspired by the first Bodenwieser Ballet performed in Sydney in 1939, she trained in ballet under Gertrud Bodenwieser. After dancing with the Bodenwieser Group for some years, Ena conducted a dance studio at Rose Bay for some twenty years. In 1952‚Äì53 she toured Britain and Europe with a solo lecture-dance program entitled The life cycle of an Australian Aboriginal woman, dancing to John Antill's music for Corroboree. She performed, representing Australia, in the festivities for the Royal coronation in 1953. In 1940 Ena married Arthur Charles No√´l, a British sea captain. After her husband's death in 1966, Ena, although remaining passionate about dance, pursued an academic career. From the University of Sydney she obtained a Bachelor of Arts and Diploma of Education. At first she taught English and History at various high schools. While teaching at Dover Heights Girls High School she became convinced that her highest goal was to turn young people into enthusiastic and discriminating readers by working in school libraries. In 1958 Ena was appointed librarian at South Sydney Boys High. Contribution to children's literature Ena was invited to speak at many international conferences and from 1982 to 1986 served on the International Board on Books for Young People international executive committee. She believed literature to be a potent force in international understanding and goodwill. Ena's crowning moment in IBBY and in promoting Australian children's literature internationally was no doubt her achievement in 1986 of successfully nominating Patricia Wrightson for the IBBY Hans Christian Andersen Medal for the body of her writing for children, and Robert Ingpen the IBBY Hans Christian Andersen Medal for his illustrations of children's books. This is the only time that both of these awards have gone to the same country in the same year. She was a respected critic of children's literature and contributed articles to international journals such as Bookbird. In 1971 she organised Australia's only entry for the Biennial of Illustrations in Bratislava; and in 1992 she was the Australian judge for the American Ezra Jack Keats Award in children's literature. For her services to children's literature Ena No√´l received the Children's Book Council's Lady Cutler Award in 1983, and in 1986 she was presented with the Medal of the Order of Australia. On the occasion of the Lady Cutler Award it was said: 'In the world of children's literature Ena No√´l's name is a password nationally and internationally. It is a password amongst those who believe that literature of quality and integrity is a powerful potential in the growth of children's imagination, insight and understanding ‚Äì understanding of themselves, their society and their world; that books can be bridges linking person to person, culture to culture, nation to nation.' Maurice Saxby was nominated by Ena No√´l, and then elected to the jury of the Hans Christian Andersen Award in 1984 and 1986. Ena No√´l Award for Encouragement Ena Noel Award for Encouragement In 1994, Ena No√´l founded the Ena Noel Award for Encouragement to encourage young, emerging Australian writers and illustrators. The award is a mounted silver medallion designed by the first winner of the award, the Australian Aboriginal writer/illustrator Arone Raymond Meeks. The Award is presented biennially by IBBY Australia at the Australian Library and Information Association Conference. A list of the award winners is included in the IBBY Australia entry. Contribution to children's librarianship From 1956 to 1974 she was renowned for her skill as a teacher-librarian ‚Äì especially at Fort St Girls High (now known as Fort Street High School). Ena No√´l and Margaret Trask were early leaders in the Library Association of Australia's School and Children's Libraries Section. Ena No√´l co-ordinated and lectured at short summer courses in secondary school librarianship at the University of Sydney in the 1960s.

Silver-gilt or gilded/gilt silver, sometimes known in American English by the French term vermeil, is silver (either pure or sterling) which has been gilded with gold. Most large objects made in goldsmithing that appear to be gold are actually silver-gilt; for example most sporting trophies (including medals such as the gold medals awarded in all Olympic Games after 1912German Olympic museum website and Beijing 2008 Appendix 8 ) and many crown jewels are silver-gilt objects. Apart from the raw materials being much less expensive to acquire than solid gold of any karat, large silver-gilt objects are also noticeably lighter if lifted, as well as more durable (gold is much heavier than even lead and is easily scratched and bent). For objects that have intricate detail like monstrances, gilding greatly reduces the need for cleaning and polishing, and so reduces the risk of damage. Ungilded silver would suffer oxidation and need frequent polishing; gold does not oxidize at all. The \\"gold\\" threads used in embroidered goldwork are normally also silver-gilt. Techniques Silver gilt toilet service by Johann Jacob Kirstein, 1786 Silver-gilt objects have been made since ancient times across Eurasia, using a variety of gilding techniques, and a distinctive depletion gilding technique was developed by the Incas in Pre-Columbian South America. \\"Overlaying\\" or folding or hammering on gold foil or gold leaf is mentioned in Homer's Odyssey (Bk vi, 232),\\"And as when a man overlays silver with gold, a cunning workman whom Hephaestus and Pallas Athena have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is the work he produces, even so the goddess shed grace upon his head and shoulders\\" from this translation and fire-gilding with mercury dates to at least the 4th century BC, and was the most common method until the Early Modern period at least, though dangerous for the workersStrong, 11 and often caused blindness among French artisans who refined the technique in the 18th century. Today electroplating is the most commonly used method: it involves no mercury and is therefore much safer. Keum-boo is a special Korean technique of silver-gilding, using depletion gilding. In China gilt-bronze, also known as ormolu, was more common. Vermeil A vermeil wine cooler manufactured in 1810 by Paul Storr is located in the Vermeil Room of the White House. Vermeil ( or ; ) is an alternative for the usual term silver-gilt. It is a French word which came into use in the English language, mostly in America, in the 19th century, and is rare in British English.Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd. Edition (1989)16 CFR 23.5 - Misuse of the word \\"vermeil\\"Compare for example the online collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which describes over 800 objects as \\"silver-gilt\\" against a handful of pieces of jewellery incorporating \\"vermeil\\" Accessed July 30, 2009 \\"Vermeil\\" can also refer to gilt bronze, an even less costly alternative construction material than silver.Oxford English Dictionary, Second edition, 1989 The US Code of Federal Regulations 16, Part 23.5 defines vermeil thus: \\"An industry product may be described or marked as 'vermeil' if it consists of a base of sterling silver coated or plated on all significant surfaces with gold or gold alloy of not less than 10-karat fineness, that is of substantial thickness and a minimum thickness throughout equivalent to two and one half () microns (or approximately of an inch) of fine gold.\\"US Code of Federal Regulations, 16CFR23.5, Revised January 1, 2009 Considerations in use Sassanid silver- gilt shield-boss, 7th century Silver objects could be gilded at any point, not just when first made, and items regularly handled, such as toilet service sets for dressing-tables or tableware, often needed regilding after a few years, as the gold began to wear off. In 18th century London two different silversmiths charged 3 shillings per ounce of silver for an initial gilding, and 1 shilling and 9 pence per ounce for regilding.Glanville, 187 Often only the interior of cups was gilded, perhaps from concern at the chemical compounds used to clean tarnish from silver. This is called parcel-gilt. Fully silver-gilt items are visually indistinguishable from gold, and were no doubt often thought to be solid gold. When the English Commonwealth sold the Crown Jewels of England after the execution of Charles I they were disappointed in the medieval \\"Queen Edith's Crowne, formerly thought to be of massy gold, but upon trial found to be of silver gilt\\", which was valued at only ¬£16, compared to ¬£1,110 for the \\"imperial crowne\\".Inventory The English Gothic Revival architect Sir George Gilbert Scott was concerned by the morality of this. Gilding of the interior only he accepted, but with all-over gilding \\"we ... reach the actual boundary of truth and falsehood; and I am convinced that if we adopt this custom we overstep it.... why make our gift look more costly than it is? We increase its beauty, but it is at the sacrifice of truth.\\"Scott, 249 Indeed, some Early Medieval silver-gilt Celtic brooches had compartments apparently for small lead weights to aid such deception.British Museum, mentioning two examples.

Published each Saturday, by J. S. Folds, George Petrie and Caesar Otway, the Penny Journal concerned itself with matters of Irish history, legend, topography and Irish identity, and was illustrated with a number of maps and woodcuts. While originally a paper of low circulation ‚Äì numbering only a few thousand in its first edition ‚Äì the Penny Journals popularity led to increased production. By the cessation of publication in 1836, 206 works had been published in four volumes, and were sold wholesale in London, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, New York City, Philadelphia, Boston and Paris. History The first edition of the Dublin Penny Journal was published on June 30, 1832 ‚Äì three years after Catholic emancipation had culminated in the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. It featured on its front page an illustration of \\"The Custom House and Harbour of Dublin\\" and its first article, \\"Historical Notive of the City of Dublin\\". Other articles of the first publication included \\"the Age of Brass\\", \\"Agriculture\\", \\"A Visit to the Gardens of the Zoological Society of Dublin, \\"Account of a Pestilence that raged in Ireland in the Year 1348\\" written by John Clyn, a friar from Kilkenny, and a collection of \\"Legends and Stories of Ireland\\". The next 26 publications were printed through until December 29, forming 216 pages of journal which would be assembled into the first of four volumes by June 25, 1833. The inclusion of several pieces of Irish culture, heritage and legend attracted a number of nationalist works; including Terence O'Toole's National Emblems which opened the second publication on July 7 with \\"Sir - Your wood-cut is, to my apprehension, as full of meaning to an Irishman, as any emblematic device I have seen. It represents peculiar marks or tokens or Ireland, which are dear to my soul.\\" The preface to the first volume of all publications between 1832 and 1833 discussed that the volumes were \\"calculated to effect a public good... by exciting a national and concordant feeling in a country in which there is, as yet, so much of discord and party.\\" By 1833 the journal had expanded to include more writers, such as C. P. Meehan, Philip Dixon Hardy, James Clarence Mangan, and John O'Donovan. Mangan in particular worked to translate German sources for the journal, and wrote letters under a pseudonym discussing the difficulties of the Irish language. The Dublin Penny Journal continued to publish volumes through until 1836. From the 53rd publication on July 6, 1833, a second volume was compiled ‚Äì containing all publications from then to the 104th on June 28, 1834. This was published in June 1834 from the newly acquired Penny Journal Office in Dublin, and featured a harp and crown on the cover, cast above various items of Irish symbolism, including weapons and shamrocks. Numbers 105‚Äì156; July 5, 1834 ‚Äì June 27, 1835 respectively, formed the third volume of the Penny Journal in June 1835, covered with another harp and other Irish symbolism and under the editor Philip Dixon Hardy. The preface took note of comments by Henry Brougham, then Lord High Chancellor of England, that an inexpensive journal could not be produced for widespread circulation; and made point to state \\"we have performed it.\\" Numbers 157 to 208, between July 4, 1835 and June 25, 1836, formed the fourth and final volume.

She operated primarily as a cargo vessel, carrying timber and guano to Ireland. Passenger service She was fitted with bunks and between April to September from 1845 to 1851, she carried passengers on the outward leg to North America. These passengers were people desperate to escape the Great Famine of Ireland at the time, and conditions for steerage passengers were tough. An area of 6 foot square was allocated to up to 4 passengers (who might not be related) and their children. Often 50% died on passage (they were known as \\"coffin ships\\"). However, the mortality rate on the Dunbrody was exceptionally low, no doubt due to her captains, John Baldwin and his successor John W. Williams, with passengers writing home often praising their dedication. On one passage with 313 passengers, almost twice her normal complement, only 6 died.

Modular construction is particularly popular for hotels, educational facilities such as classrooms and student residences, as well as healthcare facilities. This is due to the economies of scale available from many similar sized modules and the particular benefit of reduced site construction time.  Safety advantages  Modular construction can help eliminate or reduce many hazards associated with traditional construction, and they can be avoided including: * Falling from heights, such as roofs. A common method used now is to construct the roof on the ground and lift it into position with a crane later * Dropping objects. When construction necessitates working on a building in its finished position, work is often performed at different elevations. This leads to the possibility of objects falling onto other workers. * Ergonomic strains. Workers can perform their tasks on smaller pieces of the project in easy to access areas to eliminate the need to reach and stretch. * Environmental hazards. As with ergonomic hazards, employees can work on the project in a protected environment instead of in the elements. Only needing to be on-site for final assembly.

Duncan first described this species in 1944 after collecting a specimen in 1942 from a site in Wayne County, Georgia. Description Baptisia arachnifera is a perennial that grows to a height of forty to eighty centimeters and is \\"covered with grayish-white, cobwebby hairs\\". Blue-green, simple leaves are alternate and heart-shaped. They range in size from 2‚Äì6 cm long by 1.5‚Äì5 cm wide. Flowers form in terminal racemes with five bright yellow petals and bloom in late June through early August. Fruits are woody pods 8‚Äì15 mm long and 6‚Äì9 mm wide with stalks and beaks, forming in August through October. Distribution and conservation thumb 95 to 99% of the species' native habitat has been destroyed and replanted with plantations of pine trees.The Nature Conservancy It now remains in patchy areas among these stands and in nearby forest and even roadsides. Fire suppression in areas of silviculture may be detrimental to the plant, but specimens growing among the pines encounter less competition with other plants and may grow bigger. Baptisia arachnifera has been listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as endangered since 1978. It is known from two counties, Brantley and Wayne, in the coastal plain of Georgia.

She previously played for several professional clubs in Sweden and the United States. Between 2004 and 2017, she won 123 caps for the Scotland women's national football team. Dieke was born in Amherst, Massachusetts, to Nigerian parents, moving to Cumbernauld in Scotland when she was three years old. Dieke and fellow Scot Kim Little were the only non- English players selected in the Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics.  Club career  Dieke started her football career when she was eight years old, playing for her primary school St Mary's. She later joined Cumbernauld Cosmos, from where she moved to Cumbernauld Ladies. In 1999, she was awarded a scholarship by Florida International University, playing for the university's FIU Golden Panthers women's soccer team. She graduated in 2003 and joined Women's United Soccer Association side Atlanta Beat. She started eight of 13 regular season games and scored one goal. The league folded at the end of her first season, and Dieke later played in Sweden (for QBIK in 2007 and for Kristianstads DFF in 2008) and Cyprus. In 2009, she joined the Chicago Red Stars. In the inaugural 2009 Women's Professional Soccer season, Dieke appeared in 14 games. She received a red card for foulling Kelley O'Hara during the Red Stars' 2‚Äì0 defeat at FC Gold Pride in May 2010. The following month she was allowed to move to Boston Breakers on a free transfer. She started 12 of her 13 appearances for the Breakers in 2010, scoring one goal against her former employers Chicago, for whom she had made five early season appearances. During the WPS offseason in 2011, Dieke joined Cypriot club, Apollon Limassol on loan from Boston Breakers. The WPS folded ahead of the 2012 season and Dieke returned to Sweden, signing for Damallsvenskan newcomers Vittsj√∂ GIK. Despite missing almost the entire 2013 Damallsvenskan season through injury, Dieke was given a new contract by Vittsj√∂ ahead of 2014. In January 2018, Dieke left Vittsj√∂ after six seasons. In search of a new challenge, she joined newly-promoted Damallsvenkan club IFK Kalmar. The move was not successful and with Kalmar adrift at the foot of the league table, Dieke was dropped from the team and released during the mid-season break. It was reported that she was unhappy at Kalmar's failure to strengthen their playing squad. She returned to Apollon in September 2018.  International career  Dieke was eligible to represent either Scotland, the United States or Nigeria at international level. She made her Scotland debut in January 2004 against Greece and earned her 50th cap against Northern Ireland in May 2009. In October 2008 she scored an own goal in a UEFA Women's Euro 2009 qualifying play-off against Russia in Nalchik. The tie finished 4‚Äì4 and Scotland were eliminated on the away goals rule, much to Dieke's disappointment: \\"It hit off my shin, and for me that was the one that knocked us out because it was an away goal. I was beating myself up quite a bit for that.\\" In 2012 Dieke was selected for a place in the Great Britain team at the 2012 London Olympics. Along with Scotland teammate Kim Little, Dieke was one of only two non-English players in the squad. She played alongside Casey Stoney in central defence, but suffered knee ligament damage in the second group match and had to withdraw from the squad. Medical tests showed that she had ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament, which prevented her from playing in the remainder of Scotland's UEFA Women's Euro 2013 qualifying matches. After missing almost two years of international football due to the injury, Dieke was recalled to Scotland's squad for the 2014 Cyprus Women's Cup. That October she won her 100th cap in Scotland's 2‚Äì0 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification ‚Äì UEFA play-offs defeat by the Netherlands in Rotterdam. Dieke remained in Scotland's team for UEFA Women's Euro 2017 qualifying. With teammate Jo Love, she was awarded a special cap in October 2015 as part of a UEFA-backed programme to honour players with 100 or more appearances for their national teams. When Scotland secured qualification for their first ever major tournament at UEFA Women's Euro 2017, after several near misses, 36-year-old veteran Dieke announced that she would be retiring from international football afterwards. She played in all three games as Scotland made a limp group stage exit, then confirmed her decision to retire the following month. Playing style Team GB coach Hope Powell said of Dieke: \\"Ife's a great defender one-v-one. She probably prefers a centre-half role but can play anywhere along the back.\\" Writing in The Herald in 2017, sports journalist Alan Campbell described Dieke as: \\"[a] quick and tactically astute central defender\\". Personal life Dieke is often referred to by the hypocorism \\"Ife\\" (or \\"Iffy\\"). She can speak the Igbo language.

King Afonso V granted the land around Abrantes to his cousin, Lopo de Almeida, 1st Count of Abrantes in 1476. The title and lands descended in the Almeida family until 1650 when its male line expired and the estate reverted to the Crown. The estate and noble title were granted to the S√° family, Counts of Penagui√£o in 1718 and devolved via the Lencastres, Counts of Vila Nova, now represented by the Lancastre e T√°vora branch of the family.  The Counts of Abrantes  In 1476, King Afonso V of Portugal granted Dom Lopo de Almeida, a descendant of King Pedro I of Portugal through an illegitimate line, the title of Count of Abrantes, which became extinct when Dom Miguel de Almeida, 4th Count of Abrantes and a Restoration hero, died without issue. When Isabel de Mendon√ßa, the Count of Abrantes‚Äô heir, married Jo√£o Rodrigues de S√°, 1st Count of Penagui√£o, the Count of Abrantes revived for the S√° family.  The Marquesses of Abrantes  In 1659, King Afonso VI granted Francisco de S√° e Menezes (1640‚Äì1677), 4th Count of Penagui√£o, the new title of 1st Marquess of Fontes, which was replaced in 1718 with the title of Marquess of Abrantes according to King John V‚Äôs decree.  The Duchesses of Abrantes  Twice, on exceptional occasions, the title of Duchess of Abrantes was granted to two Marchionesses of Abrantes upon becoming the Queen of Portugal's Maid of Honour (in Portuguese Camareiras-M√¥r), the highest court position for a lady: *In 1753, King Joseph I of Portugal granted the 3rd Marchioness of Abrantes, Ana Maria Catarina Henriqueta de Lorena, the title of Duchess of Abrantes for life. *In 1757, her daughter, Maria Margarida de Lorena, 4th Marchioness of Abrantes, was created Duchess of Abrantes also for life.  House of Lancastre e T√°vora  Coat of arms of the House of Lancastre e T√°vora When Maria Margarida, Duchess of Abrantes died without issue in 1780, the Abrantes estates and titles were inherited by the Lancastre family, Counts of Vila Nova de Portim√£o (who descended from infante George of Lencastre, 2nd Duke of Coimbra). The union of Isabel de Lancastre e Menezes with Manuel Rafael de T√°vora formed the Lencastre e T√°vora (or Lancastre e T√°vora) family, the current representatives of the noble title. Dom Jos√© Maria da Piedade de Lencastre e T√°vora (born 1960) is the 11th and present Marquess of Abrantes.

The Palace of Santos  The Palace of Santos, or Palace of the Marquesses of Abrantes, where the French embassy is located in Lisbon, resulted from a major historical and architectural evolution. The name \\"Santos\\" refers to three Christian martyrs executed on the top of a Lisbon hill and, in 589, when the Visigoth King Reccared I converted to Christianity, a temple in remembrance of the three saints was built there; it was later destroyed. Following the conquest of Lisbon, King Afonso I of Portugal rebuilt the church and gave it to the Order of Santiago, which made it their headquarters. When the knights left to the Reconquista, the building was converted on the south into a noble ladies' convent (the Comendadeiras). In 1490, they abandoned the building in favor of a new convent, and the building then took the name of Santos-o-Velho (in Portuguese, literally, \\"the old Santos\\"). In 1497, under King Manuel I of Portugal, the building was transformed into a royal residence due to its unique location facing the Tagus river and between the centre of Lisbon and the new area of Bel√©m. It was frequently used by Kings Manuel I, John III and Sebastian. In 1510, Gil Vicente presented some of his plays (in Portuguese: autos) there, and from that location King Sebastian of Portugal left to join the Battle of Alc√°cer Quibir. Following Alc√°cer Quibir, the palace was abandoned and, in 1629, it was acquired by Francisco Lu√≠s de Lencastre, 3rd high-Commendator (in Portuguese Comendador-M√¥r) of the Order of Aviz, a descendant of infante George of Lencastre (natural son of King John II), and it was kept in the family for the next 300 years. Meanwhile, the family also inherited the title of Marquess of Abrantes. It is not known how extensively the palace was damaged by the 1755 earthquake, but several relatives took shelter there at the time. In the beginning of the 19th century, the palace was restored and the fa√ßade was rebuilt, which gave greater dignity to the building. In 1833, the infanta Ana de Jesus Maria and her husband, the 1st Duke of Loul√©, rented part of the palace, as did Am√©lie de Beauharnais (widow of Pedro I of Brazil), who lived there between 1841 and 1849. Following the death of the 8th Marquess in 1870, the palace was rented to Count Armand, French Minister in Lisbon, who established legation services there. The French government finally acquired the building in 1909. Today, the rooms are decorated with paintings and tiles and house an excellent furniture collection dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. Special attention was given to the pyramidal roof room, which was completely covered with porcelains, and to the chapel tiles, which date from the 16th century. The gardens provide a wonderful view over the Tagus. Visitors are welcome, depending on availability in accord with the needs of the embassy of France, which usually opens some rooms to public viewing on International Museum Day (18 May). 1050px  See also  *Abrantes *Count of Abrantes *Marquess of Abrantes *Duke of Abrantes  Bibliography  \\"Nobreza de Portugal e do Brazil\\" ‚Äì Vol. II, pages 203/205.

This tolerance counters the immune response that would normally result in the rejection of something foreign in the body, as can happen in cases of spontaneous abortion. It is studied within the field of reproductive immunology. Mechanisms=Placental mechanisms= The placenta functions as an immunological barrier between the mother and the fetus. The placenta functions as an immunological barrier between the mother and the fetus, creating an immunologically privileged site. For this purpose, it uses several mechanisms: *It secretes Neurokinin B containing phosphocholine molecules. This is the same mechanism used by parasitic nematodes to avoid detection by the immune system of their host. *Also, there is presence of small lymphocytic suppressor cells in the fetus that inhibit maternal cytotoxic T cells by inhibiting the response to interleukin 2. * The placental trophoblast cells do not express the classical MHC class I isotypes HLA-A and HLA-B, unlike most other cells in the body, and this absence is assumed to prevent destruction by maternal cytotoxic T cells, which otherwise would recognize the fetal HLA-A and HLA-B molecules as foreign. On the other hand, they do express the atypical MHC class I isotypes HLA-E and HLA-G, which is assumed to prevent destruction by maternal NK cells, which otherwise destroy cells that do not express any MHC class I.Page 31 to 32 in: Maternal-Fetal Medicine : Principles and Practice. Editor: Robert K. Creasy, Robert Resnik, Jay D. Iams. Published: September 2003 However, trophoblast cells do express the rather typical HLA-C. *It forms a syncytium without any extracellular spaces between cells in order to limit the exchange of migratory immune cells between the developing embryo and the body of the mother (something an epithelium will not do sufficiently, as certain blood cells are specialized to be able to insert themselves between adjacent epithelial cells). The fusion of the cells is apparently caused by viral fusion proteins from endosymbiotic endogenous retrovirus (ERV). An immunoevasive action was the initial normal behavior of the viral protein, in order to avail for the virus to spread to other cells by simply merging them with the infected one. It is believed that the ancestors of modern viviparous mammals evolved after an infection by this virus, enabling the fetus to better resist the immune system of the mother. Still, the placenta does allow maternal IgG antibodies to pass to the fetus to protect it against infections. However, these antibodies do not target fetal cells, unless any fetal material has escaped across the placenta where it can come in contact with maternal B cells and make those B cells start to produce antibodies against fetal targets. The mother does produce antibodies against foreign ABO blood types, where the fetal blood cells are possible targets, but these preformed antibodies are usually of the IgM type,Magnetic immunodiagnostic method for the demonstration of antibody/antigen complexes especially of blood groups Yves Barbreau, Olivier Boulet, Arnaud Boulet, Alexis Delanoe, Laurence Fauconnier, Fabien Herbert, Jean-Marc Pelosin, Laurent Soufflet. October 2009 and therefore usually do not cross the placenta. Still, rarely, ABO incompatibility can give rise to IgG antibodies that cross the placenta, and are caused by sensitization of mothers (usually of blood type 0) to antigens in foods or bacteria.Merck manuals > Perinatal Anemia Last full review/revision January 2010 by David A. Paul =Other mechanisms= Still, the placental barrier is not the sole means to evade the immune system, as foreign fetal cells also persist in the maternal circulation, on the other side of the placental barrier. The placenta does not block maternal IgG antibodies, which thereby may pass through the human placenta, providing immune protection to the fetus against infectious diseases. One model for the induction of tolerance during the very early stages of pregnancy is the Eutherian Fetoembryonic Defense System (eu-FEDS) hypothesis. The basic premise of the eu-FEDS hypothesis is that both soluble and cell surface associated glycoproteins, present in the reproductive system and expressed on gametes, suppress any potential immune responses, and inhibit rejection of the fetus. The eu-FEDS model further suggests that specific carbohydrate sequences (oligosaccharides) are covalently linked to these immunosuppressive glycoproteins and act as ‚Äúfunctional groups‚Äù that suppress the immune response. The major uterine and fetal glycoproteins that are associated with the eu-FEDS model in the human include alpha-fetoprotein, CA125, and glycodelin-A (also known as placental protein 14 (PP14)). Regulatory T cells also likely play a role. Also, a shift from cell-mediated immunity toward humoral immunity is believed to occur.Jamieson DJ, Theiler RN, Rasmussen SA. Emerging infections and pregnancy. Emerg Infect Dis. 2006 Nov. Available from https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no11/06-0152.htm Insufficient tolerance Many cases of spontaneous abortion may be described in the same way as maternal transplant rejection, and a chronic insufficient tolerance may cause infertility. Other examples of insufficient immune tolerance in pregnancy are Rh disease and pre-eclampsia: *Rh disease is caused by the mother producing antibodies (including IgG antibodies) against the Rhesus D antigen on her baby's red blood cells. It occurs if the mother is Rh negative and the baby is Rh positive, and a small amount of Rh positive blood from any previous pregnancy has entered the mother's circulation to make her produce IgG antibodies against the D antigen (Anti-D). Maternal IgG is able to pass through the placenta into the fetus and if the level of it is sufficient, it will cause destruction of D positive fetal red blood cells leading to development of the anti-Rh type of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). Generally HDFN becomes worse with each additional Rh incompatible pregnancy. *One cause of pre-eclampsia is an abnormal immune response towards the placenta. There is substantial evidence for exposure to partner's semen as prevention for pre-eclampsia, largely due to the absorption of several immune modulating factors present in seminal fluid. Pregnancies resulting from egg donation, where the carrier is less genetically similar to the fetus than a biological mother, are associated with a higher incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension and placental pathology. The local and systemic immunologic changes are also more pronounced than in normal pregnancies, so it has been suggested that the higher frequency of some conditions in egg donation may be caused by reduced immune tolerance from the mother. =Infertility and miscarriage= Immunological responses could be the cause in many cases of infertility and miscarriage. Some immunological reasons that contribute to infertility are reproductive autoimmune failure syndrome, the presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies, and antinuclear antibodies. Anti-phospholipid antibodies are targeted toward the phospholipids of the cell membrane. Studies have shown that antibodies against phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylethanolamine target the pre-embryo. Antibodies against phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine are against the trophoblast. These phospholipids are essential in the aiding the cells of the fetus to remain attached to the cells of the uterus with implantation. If a female has antibodies against these phospholipids, they will be destroyed through the immune response and ultimately the fetus will not be able to remain bound to the uterus. These antibodies also jeopardize the health of the uterus by altering the blood flow to the uterus. Antinuclear antibodies cause an inflammation in the uterus that does not allow it to be a suitable host for implantation of the embryo. Natural killer cells misinterpret the fetal cells as cancer cells and attack them. An individual that presents with reproductive autoimmune failure syndrome has unexplained infertility, endometriosis, and repetitive miscarriages due to elevated levels of antinuclear antibodies circulating. Both the presence of anti-phospholipids antibodies and antinuclear antibodies have toxic effects on the implantation of embryos. This does not apply to anti-thyroid antibodies. Elevated levels do not have a toxic effect, but they are indicative of a risk of miscarriage. Elevated anti-thyroid antibodies act as a marker for females who have T-lymphocyte dysfunction because these levels indicate T cells that are secreting high levels of cytokines that induce inflammation in the uterine wall. Still, there is currently no drug that has evidence of preventing miscarriage by inhibition of maternal immune responses; aspirin has no effect in this case. Increased infectious susceptibility The increased immune tolerance is believed to be a major contributing factor to an increased susceptibility and severity of infections in pregnancy. Pregnant women are more severely affected by, for example, influenza, hepatitis E, herpes simplex and malaria. The evidence is more limited for coccidioidomycosis, measles, smallpox, and varicella. However, pregnancy does not seem to alter the protective effects of vaccination. Interspecific pregnancy If the mechanisms of rejection-immunity of the fetus could be elucidated, it could avail for interspecific pregnancy, having, for example pigs carry human fetuses to term as an alternative to a human surrogate mother.Darwin's children LeVay, Simon.

The modern Slovaks in Vojvodina are descendants of 18th- and 19th-century settlers, who migrated from the territory of present-day Slovakia. First Slovak settlers from area around Tatra migrated to Baƒçka during the time of Karlo I; in 1720 Slovaks settled in Baj≈°a, in 1740 in Petrovac and Futog, and in 1742 (during the time of Maria Theresa) in Bezdan. Some of them also later moved to Srem. In 1760, 120 Slovak families were settled in Selenƒça, but they later moved to Stara Pazova in Srem. In 1783, Slovaks settled in Kisaƒç, Veprovac, Glo≈æan, and Topola. Part of them also settled in Baj≈°a. In 1790-1791, Slovaks settled in Pivnice, in 1792 in Stara Palanka, and in 1793 in Novi Slankamen. In 1784-1787, Slovaks settled in Slovanski Bardan. In 1792 Slovaks settled in Baƒçka Palanka. Some of them moved in 1788 to Aradac and Eƒçka, and some of them later also moved to Laliƒá. In 1800, Slovaks settled in Kovaƒçica, and in 1806 and 1809 in Padina. In 1806, one group of Slovaks settled in ƒåoka, and in 1809 in ≈†upljaja. In 1825, Slovaks settled in Du≈°anovac, and in 1830 in Stari Lec. In 1850, 20 Slovak families were settled in Grk. In 1868, Slovaks settled in Marienfeld, from where they later moved to Vojlovica. In the same time, some Slovaks also settled in Ivanovo. In 1887, Slovaks were settled in Elizenhajm, and in 1899 in Silaƒëi colony near Apatin.

Life Born about 1557, he was educated on the foundation at Westminster School, and was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1574. He graduated B.A. on 12 November 1578, and M.A. on 3 March 1582, commenced B.D. on 27 April 1591. and was admitted D.D. on 14 April 1600. In January 1587 he was presented by his college to the vicarage of Long Preston, Yorkshire, which he held until December 1588. He was next instituted to the rectory of Rampisham, Dorset, on 10 October 1595, and ceded it in 1601. On 19 December 1599 he was made a prebendary of Christ Church Cathedral, and on 6 June 1601 received the vicarage of Flore, Northamptonshire, another college preferment, which he retained with his prebend until his death. He was also subdean of Christ Church. He officiated at the opening of the Bodleian Library in 1602, and on 24 September of that year became vicar of Weedon Beck, Northamptonshire, a preferment which he resigned in 1604. He was appointed by the king in 1604 one of the translators of the Bible; apparently this was to the Second Oxford Company, but the exact composition of that company is still the subject of debate. On 1 October 1609 he was installed a prebendary in St. Paul's Cathedral. He died on 17 May 1632, aged 75, and was buried in the divinity (or Latin) chapel of Christ Church Cathedral. By his wife, Anne Hamden, he had a daughter Alice, married to Richard Corbet, afterwards successively bishop of Oxford and Norwich. Works Hutten contributed to the collection of verses made by Christ Church when James I visited the college in 1605, and to other of the university collections. During the same year he published a learned work called An Answere to a certaine treatise of the Crosse in Baptisme intituled A Short Treatise of the Crosse in Baptisme,Oxford, 1605, dedicated to Richard Bancroft, archbishop of Canterbury, whose chaplain he was. He left in manuscript an English dissertation on the Antiquities of Oxford, which was printed in 1720 by Thomas Hearne in his edition of the Textus Roffensis from a copy belonging to Robert Plot, and again in 1887 by Charles Plummer in Elizabethan Oxford (Oxf. Hist. Soc.). Hutten was the author of a play entitled Bellum Grammaticale, based on Andrea Guarna's 1512 work of the same name. It was performed at Oxford before Queen Elizabeth in 1592, and printed at London in 1635 and 1726.

It is a solo performance, portraying multiple characters, that describes life on a harsh juvenile detention farm in the Midwest in the 1950s. Plot The solo actor in Shimmer tells the story by becoming each character in turn. The play takes place in 1956, in a harsh Midwestern juvenile detention center, where two boys befriend each other. To survive the brutal environment, the two create their own fantasy world, in which the movement of streams and breezes becomes a language that travels between dimensions, a language the boys call \\"shimmer.\\" The two boys are eventually locked up, and they are ultimately forced to carefully plan and carry out an escape.Wisner, Heather. \\"San Francisco Calendar.\\" SF Weekly. March 25, 1998. Background O'Keefe wrote Shimmer after financial restrictions ended his plans for a five- actor play that had been commissioned, by American Inroads in San Francisco, in 1987. O'Keefe then asked if he could do a solo play, and the proposal was accepted. \\"It was a lot more money with one guy, and I just used lights and a music stand,\\" says O'Keefe. \\"I wanted to keep the overhead next to zip.\\"Lacher, Irene. \\"In Monology, to Play It Right Do It Yourself.\\" New York Times. October 1, 1989. (p. 3 of 3). O'Keefe based the play partly on his own experiences growing up in Midwestern juvenile detention centers. O'Keefe, who was born in Iowa, was first sent to live in juvenile detention homes at the age of 7, after his mother was declared unfit to care for him. For the next nine years, he was shuttled among eight foster homes, nine juvenile detention homes, and five orphanages in 20 states. The end of Shimmer describes how he and his best friend escaped from the last of the juvenile detention centers.Holden, Stephen. \\"Stories of a Detention Farm, From One Who Lived There.\\" New York Times. July 14, 1989. \\"Shimmer is not strictly autobiographical,\\" O'Keefe says. \\"Though the characters themselves are real, the [detention] farm was a much more brutal place than I portray it.\\" Performance and reception Shimmer was first performed, by playwright O'Keefe, in 1988 in San Francisco. O'Keefe subsequently performed the solo piece all over the country, including Off-Off Broadway in New York City at Performance Space 122 beginning January 1989, and Off-Broadway at the Second Stage Theatre from July 10, 1989 to August 13, 1989. The play has received very positive reviews. The New York Times called it \\"rivetingly kinetic.\\" \\"Gliding and shadowboxing around the stage, Mr. O'Keefe physically re-enacts fights and confrontations with an edgy ferocity that feels so spontaneous one can almost forget the fact that [it] ... has been carefully rehearsed. And at key emotional moments, Mr. O'Keefe's speaking voice shades into song.... [This] is bravura storytelling that etches itself on the mind.\\"Holden, Stephen. Shimmer: \\"Macho Memories.\\" New York Times. January 16, 1989. The San Francisco Chronicle called the show \\"ravishing, heart-breaking\\" and \\"a solo- theater classic.\\" \\"... O'Keefe plays second to no one in the transforming magic of the solo stage. Shimmer fuses language, voice, gesture and action in a rush of feeling. With an eerie intuitive power, the show captures the strangeness and sensuality, the loneliness and precious consolations of growing up afraid.\\"Winn, Steven. \\"Shimmer Can Still Radiate.\\" San Francisco Chronicle. April 3, 1998. Shimmer was published in 1989. The one-man play has subsequently been performed across the U.S. and around the world. Film O'Keefe also adapted Shimmer into a screenplay with multiple characters, and it was made into an independent film by American Playhouse in 1993, as the true story of a friendship between two boys from a juvenile home.

Muslim immigrants do not so much enhance European culture as they supplant it. Caldwell asserts that Muslim immigrants are patiently conquering Europe's cities, \\"street by street.\\" He considers \\"the most chilling observation\\" to be that \\"the debate over Muslim immigration in Europe is one that the continent can't openly have, because anyone remotely critical of Islam is branded as Islamophobic. Europe's citizens ‚Äî as well as its leaders, its artists and, crucially, its satirists ‚Äî are scared to speak because of a demonstrated willingness by Islam's fanatics to commit violence against their perceived opponents. There exists, Mr. Caldwell writes, a kind of 'standing fatwa' against Islam's critics.\\" Caldwell predicts that immigration's ultimate impact will vary throughout Europe. Britain is most susceptible to violence and political extremism. Sweden has the greatest problem with isolation and segregation of immigrants. Spain, already beset by questions of national unity, is most vulnerable to being swamped by the sheer volume of immigration. Turks in Germany may slowly assimilate. Finally, France will continue to experience \\"spectacular social problems\\" but its republican traditions offer the best hope for fully assimilating immigrants' children and grandchildren. According to The Observer, \\"Caldwell cuts to shreds the conventional wisdom of the 'immigrationist' ideology - the view that mass immigration is inevitable and in any case a necessary injection of youth into our ageing continent. He shows, contrary to the immigrationists, that the flows of recent decades are unprecedented. He also demolishes the economic and welfare-state arguments for mass immigration.... One of the most startling figures in the book is that the number of foreign residents in Germany rose from 3 million to 7.5 million between 1971 and 2000 but the number of employed foreigners stayed the same at 2 million.\\"Christopher Caldwell, 17 May 2009, The Observer Do we need more people in Europe? The Observer noted, \\"Caldwell is at his best describing the confused cultural and intellectual condition of much of Europe at the time the first waves of immigrants were arriving. It was hard, he points out, to follow Europe's rules and embrace its values when Europeans themselves were rewriting those rules and reassessing those values.... The idea of national traditions and solidarities came to be scorned by liberals in many European countries.\\" Reception Dwight Garner for The New York Times praised the book as not at all \\"aggrieved or unruly. On the contrary, Mr. Caldwell, a senior editor at the Weekly Standard and a columnist for The Financial Times, compiles his arguments patiently, twig by twig, and mostly with lucidity and intellectual grace and even wit.\\" Martin Woollacott for The Guardian concluded that Caldwell \\"is right to argue that immigration on the scale that Europe has experienced constitutes a risky experiment to which we need not have submitted ourselves, and of which the final result is not yet clear. He is right that we frequently talk about it in stupid and dishonest ways. If his book sharpens a so far sluggish debate, it will have served an important purpose.\\"Europe's risky experiment; Martin Woollacott assesses the effects of immigration, Martin Woollacott, The Guardian, 13 June 2009 David Goodhart of The Observer argued that \\"Caldwell somewhat overstates the case... This is a declamatory, polemical work and no more so than in its treatment of Islam. In fact, the book is really two essays - one an insightful probing of Europe's confusion about postwar immigration; the other a rather cartoonish polemic about the potential Islamic takeover of Europe.Do we need more people in Europe?, An American's view of immigration offers a bracing counter-argument to the prevailing liberal orthodoxy, says David Goodhart, David Goodhart, The Observer, 17 May 2009 Kenan Malik in New Humanist acknowledged that \\"What is different about Caldwell is the high praise garnered by his book not simply from right-wing critics of immigration but from many liberals too,\\" but concluded that \\"Reflections on the Revolution in Europe is trenchantly written and robustly argued. It is complex and often subtle. It is also fundamentally wrong in both premise and conclusion. ... Caldwell confuses the diversity of peoples and the diversity of values.\\"Book review: Reflections on the Revolution in Europe: Immigration, Islam and Europe, Christopher Caldwell, New Humanist, July 2009 In a substantial review for the British Institute of Race Relations, Matt Carr argues that while Caldwell's arguments are \\"considerably more sophisticated\\", \\"there is virtually nothing in his book that would be out of place in any other examples of the 'green peril' genre\\". Carr further laments the book's \\"lackadaisical attitude towards factual accuracy\\", a \\"[tendency] evident on numerous occasions\\", and the \\"uncritical reception given to [this] artful anti-Muslim diatribe in liberal circles\\", \\"a depressing reminder of the extent to which its essential assumptions have moved from the political margins to form a new mainstream consensus.\\"Matt Carr, (Review) Christopher Caldwell dissected , Institute of Race Relations, 2 July 2009, later published in Race & Class, vol 51.3, January 2010 References 2009 books Islam in Europe Non-fiction books about immigration to Europe Works about human migration Books about Islam and society ","title":"Reflections on the Revolution in Europe"},{"id":"23801208","text":"Eduard Mammadov (born January 2, 1978, in Baku) is an Azerbaijani kickboxer, nicknamed the \\"White Wolf\\".

The bomb was placed under a patrol car and two Civil Guard officers died as a result of the explosion. A second device was found under another Civil Guard vehicle at nearby barracks and safely exploded by police. On August 9, the Basque nationalist and separatist organisation ETA claimed responsibility for the attack, while four other bombs exploded around restaurants and shopping centres in Palma, Majorca, causing no injuries. The bombing was ETA's first attack in Majorca since it tried to kill King Juan Carlos I in the summer of 1995, and its deadliest attack since it killed two Civil Guard officers in Capbreton, France in 2007. The attack came on the eve of the 50th anniversary of ETA's founding, and days before the King's yearly visit to Majorca. Background Investigators sift through debris at the Burgos Civil Guard barracks In mid-2006, the organisation declared a ceasefire, and conversations between Batasuna, ETA and the Basque and Spanish governments started. Peace talks ended in December, when ETA broke the truce with a massive car bomb at the Madrid-Barajas Airport. ETA officially ended the ceasefire in 2007 and resumed its attacks around Spain. At the same time, dozens of members were arrested by Spanish and French police. Despite that, the organisation did not lose the capacity of carrying out attacks. In 2009, Patxi L√≥pez became the first non-nationalist lendakari since the 1979 Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country. On June 19, ETA killed inspector Eduardo Puelles Garc√≠a in Arrigorriaga near Bilbao, Biscay, when a bomb attached to his car exploded , and on July 9, a powerful bomb exploded in a Socialist Workers' Party local office in Durango, Biscay, causing no injuries. In late July, it was reported that ETA was preparing its \\"summer campaign\\", with Spanish police looking for several vans the organisation had ready to explode. On July 29, a van loaded with of explosives went off in front of a Civil Guard barracks in Burgos, injuring 70, including women and children. The bombing was the first time since 2007 in which ETA killed more than one person in one of its attacks. On December 2, 2007, two undercover Civil Guards were shot dead in the French town of Capbreton, Aquitaine. It was also the deadliest attack in Spanish soil since the Madrid-Barajas Airport. The attack was the first time ETA had killed in Majorca, one of the Spanish regions less targeted by ETA. On August 18, 1977, a bomb was deactivated next to a seafront walk. On July 31, 1991, two people were injured after two bombs went off in Palma. Two months later, a car bomb was defused in Palma's main beach. In the summer of 1995, Spanish authorities dismantled a cell of ETA ready to shoot king Juan Carlos I. In 2005, the organisation attempted the magnicide once more in Majorca. Attack At 13.50, a bomb placed under a Civil Guard Nissan Patrol went off, killing officers Carlos Sa√©nz de Tejada Garc√≠a and Diego Salva Lezaun. One of the officers died instantly, while paramedics failed to resuscitate the other officer. Both officers were inside the car when the bomb exploded. The vehicle had been parked in the Na Boira street, in front of a government-owned building used as a post office and Civil Guard barracks, among other functions. Many hotels are located in the area, something which caused many foreign tourists, mainly German and British, to witness the blast. After the attack, authorities started to look for other possible bombs in the area, with the Civil Guard giving the order to search in all barracks on the island. Soon after, a detection dog found a bomb attached to another Civil Guard Nissan Patrol parked in front of a barracks located from where the first bomb had exploded. The area was cordoned off and people evacuated from nearby houses and hotels. At 18.30, Civil Guard bomb disposal officers TEDAX carried out a controlled explosion. The bomb had been placed in a broken down vehicle and was therefore not in use. =Victims= *Diego Salv√° Lezaun (Pamplona, 1981) lived in Majorca and became a Givil Guard on August 25, 2008. He started working as an intern on January 31, 2009. A few months later, he suffered a motorbike accident which left him several weeks in coma. Once he recovered, he was assigned to the Palma Nova barracks, just four days before the attack took place. He was buried in Palma. *Carlos S√°enz de Tejada Garc√≠a (Burgos, 1980) tried to join the National Police Corps after finishing his high school studies. He failed to do so and became a member of the Spanish Army, being stationed in an army barracks in Castrillo del Val. He joined the Civil Guard on February 18, 2008, and was sent to Majorca on July 19. He had some relatives affected by the July 29 bombing in Burgos, where he was buried. Aftermath Cathedral of Santa Maria On July 31, a funeral was held at the Cathedral of Santa Maria in Palma. The service was attended by Prime Minister Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero and Prince and Princess of Asturias, Felipe and Letizia. Other people attending the mass were leader of the opposition Mariano Rajoy, Minister of the Interior Alfredo P√©rez Rubalcaba and Patxi L√≥pez, among others. At least 2,000 gathered outside of the cathedral and a minute of silence was held across Spain in memory of the dead. =Operation Cage= Right after the attack, and suspecting that the bombers were still on the island, the Civil Guard and the National Police Corps launched a lockdown, an operation named Operation Cage (), the biggest manhunt in the history of the island. Similar operations had been done around Spain in other attacks, such as in the 2004 Madrid train bombings. Checkpoints were set up across the island, while the Palma de Mallorca Airport and all ports were temporarily closed. The airport was closed at 4:00 pm and was re-opened at 5:55 pm, with several flights being delayed. During the rest of the afternoon, the ports were re-opened as well. The day after the attack, Spanish police released the picture of six members of ETA who could have possibly taken part in the bombing. Police named the suspects as Itziar Mart√≠nez Moreno, Iratxe Y√°√±ez Ortiz de Barr√≥n, Alberto Beraza Machain, Oroitz Gurruchaga Gogorza, Joanes Larretxea Mendiola and Iv√°n S√°ez de J√°uregui Ortigosa, although no direct evidence linked them to the attack. Meanwhile, at least 1600 police officers were deployed to keep checking around the island, including on fisherman. The intense search was still active in mid August. =Reactions= During a press conference at the Moncloa Palace, Rodr√≠guez Zapatero blamed both bombings \\"on the terrorist group ETA\\" and vowed to bring all of its members to justice: \\"They have no chance to hide, they can't flee, they can't escape justice, they will be arrested, they will be sentenced, they will spend their lives in jail\\". When arriving on Majorca on August 1 for his yearly summer holidays King Juan Carlos I condemned the attack and vowed to \\"go on and on hitting them in the head and we must fight to stop them\\". Condemnation also came from governments worldwide following the bombing: * The European Commission condemned the bombing and gave its \\"total solidarity to the Spanish people and institutions\\". * German Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the attack, and gave Rodriguez Zapatero her support in \\"the fight against terrorism\\". * The Mexican Secretariat of Foreign Affairs condemned the killing. * Then Foreign Minister of Argentina Jorge Taiana condemned the Majorca and Burgos attacks. August bombings On August 9, the same day ETA claimed responsibility for the July 30 attack, four bombs exploded in three restaurants and one shopping centre around Palma. The bombs, which contained small amounts of explosives and caused little damage and no injuries, went off after three warning calls from ETA. At 11:16 am local time, a man speaking on behalf of ETA called the firefighters of Calvi√†, warning that three bombs would go off in Palma. Half an hour later, another person also speaking on behalf of ETA called a taxi company in Gipuzkoa, giving details of the location and time the bombs would explode. Finally, another warning call was mistakenly made to the personal mobile phone of an inhabitant of C√≥rdoba. Authorities reported that the bombers had given contradicting details in each call, leading to confusion on the location of the bombs. The first bomb exploded at 12:00 pm in the bar \\"Nica\\", located in the avenue Comte de Sallent. The explosion was at first not reported, with authorities believing it was a gas explosion. The second bomb exploded at around 2:25 pm in the \\"La Rigoletta\\" restaurant, in front of one of Palma's main beaches. The third bomb went off at around 4:00 pm in another restaurant, named \\"Enco\\". The fourth device exploded around 6:00 pm in a shopping mall located next to the main square of Palma. As a result of the few details given by the warning calls, police failed to evacuate the attacked restaurants. Nonetheless, no one was injured. Investigation Authorities rapidly ruled out the possibility that ETA had a cell in the island, with police believing the attack had been carried out by a unit that had travelled to the island specifically to carry it out. Initial reports stated that the bombers had set the bomb off with a remote control. Once the second bomb was spotted, police announced that it had a timer device, which could have allowed the members of ETA to plant the bomb several days before the attack and leave the island. Earlier, Government delegate for Majorca, Ramon Soc√≠as, had said that security forces believed that the bombers had not left Majorca, and were hiding on the island, waiting for the situation to cool down before attempting to leave. Regarding the August 8 bombings, Alfredo P√©rez Rubalcaba did not rule out any possibility, although he confirmed that the hypothesis of the bombers leaving the island before the attack was \\"reasonable\\", due to the timer devices. All of the bombs had been planted in women's toilets, which led authorities to believe that they had been set by one of the two female suspects, Itziar Mart√≠nez Moreno and Iratxe Y√°√±ez Ortiz. =Arrests= On August 19, Alberto Matxain Beraza was arrested in the French town of Le Corbier in Savoy, next to the French Alps. He was held along with fellow ETA members Aitzol Etxaburu and Andoni Sarasola. They were responsible for ETA‚Äôs logistics operation, and had the job of supplying weapons and explosives to the ETA cells operating in Spanish soil. The arrest led to the discovery of almost a tone of explosives, hidden by ETA in 12 small caches around France. On October 11, Joanes Larretxea was arrested in Rivi√®res, Gard, along with top ETA member Iurgi Mendinueta Mintegi. Iratxe Ya√±ez Ortiz was arrested on January 10, 2010, in Portugal after she was stopped in a routine traffic check-point in the Spanish town of Bermillo de Sayago, next to Spain-Portugal border. Ya√±ez Ortiz was arrested along another member of ETA, Garikoitz Garc√≠a Arrieta, who was driving a van containing of explosives, two pistols, a rifle and bomb-making material. She was extradited to Spain on October 28, 2010.

It was the junction of a short branch line to Chard. It was opened in 1860 as Chard Road and closed in 1966. An adjacent milk depot was served by its own sidings from 1937 to 1980. A signal box remains to control Station Road level crossing and a passing loop on the long section of single track railway between and . A 1912 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing (centre) railways in the vicinity of Chard Junction (lower centre) Although no longer a station nor a junction, the name 'Chard Junction' still appears on the signal box and official maps. History The London and South Western Railway's (LSWR) line from Yeovil to Exeter was opened on 19 July 1860. A station named 'Chard Road' was provided on the Somerset‚ÄìDevon border to serve the nearby town of Chard, the 'Road' part of the name indicating that it was not in the town. On 8 May 1863 a branch line was opened to , but it was not until August 1872 that Chard Road was renamed 'Chard Junction'. A signal box was erected at the junction in 1875. From 1 January 1917 the branch line was worked by the Great Western Railway (GWR) with the trains and staff that worked its own branch from to the Chard Joint station that had been opened in 1866. In 1923 the LSWR became a part of the larger Southern Railway (SR). Sidings for dedicated milk trains to serve a new creamery were laid on the south side of the station in 1937, shunted by the dairy's own Ruston and Hornsby four-wheel diesel locomotive (works number 183062 built 1937). Taken over by the Wiltshire United Co- operative Society, in 1974 a second hand Ruston and Hornsby 0-4-0 replaced it (304470 built 1951), which had previously been locomotive 12 at Windsor Street gas works in Birmingham. The original locomotive was retired into preservation two years later. 1948 saw the SR and GWR nationalised to become the Southern Region and Western Region respectively of British Railways. Things continued much as before but traffic was dwindling. Passenger trains were withdrawn from the Chard branch on 10 September 1962, although goods traffic continued for a few years more. From 1963 the line west of Salisbury was transferred to the Western Region and just a few months later The Reshaping of British Railways report recommended the closure of many rural stations and lines. In 1964 through trains beyond Exeter were mostly rerouted off the line through Chard Junction and along the Bristol to Exeter line instead. Just two years later, on 7 March 1966, Chard Junction was closed to passengers and on 3 October that year the remaining goods traffic on the branch line was withdrawn and the line closed completely. Further rationalisation saw the main line reduced to just a single track in 1967, although a passing loop was retained at Chard Junction. The eastwards to was singled on 7 May, followed by the westwards to on 11 June. The old level crossing gates were removed in January 1968 and replaced by full road-width lifting barriers. The sidings serving the milk factory were taken out of use in 1980, although two years later a new signal box was built to replace the original that was then more than 100 years old. Additional loops have been installed since the 1960s; from December 2009 the single-line sections will be eastwards to and westwards to the long loop at . Description The railway here climbs eastwards at a gradient of 1 in 120 (0.8%). At the north-east end of the station was the level crossing of Station Road and the Chard Road Hotel that served railway passengers at this remote location. The main station buildings were on the north-west side, the side nearer to Chard and on the platform for trains going towards Yeovil and London. On the opposite platform there was only a small waiting room and basic facilities. In front of the station entrance was the road approach and, opposite this, a separate platform used by the Chard branch trains. The track layout did not allow trains to run directly between the branch and main line, instead traffic to and from the branch had to be shunted through a connection in the goods yard which was at the Exeter end of the station between the main and branch lines. This included a goods shed and facilities for handling cattle traffic. The private sidings for the milk depot were behind the Exeter platform. Today the old London and Chard platforms can still be seen, along with the signal box next to the level crossing. The goods shed still stands and is in use, but not for railway business. The station hotel still stands to the north east of the level crossing; it was known as now the Three Counties Hotel it has since closed. Signalling The first signal box was provided on the eastbound platform next to the level crossing in 1875. The next signal box to the west was away at Broom Gates (a level crossing), and one was opened at Hewish Gates in 1900, shortening the section towards in the east by . A separate signal box known as Chard Junction Branch controlled movements in and out of the branch platform. It was reduced in status to a ground frame on 5 March 1935 and was closed entirely in 1964. The signal box on the main line platforms was replaced in 1982 but it continues to be known as 'Chard Junction', despite the lack of any kind of junction since 1966. Adjacent signal boxes are now located at eastwards, and westwards. As part of signalling modernisation the signal box is due to close as it will be controlled remotely from Basingstoke (info sourced 2012). Services Long- distance services on the main line were operated by the LSWR and its successors between London Waterloo station and various stations in Devon and Cornwall such as , and Padstow. Local trains often operated between or and Exeter Queen Street. Branch line services were operated between Chard Junction and Chard Town from 1863 to 1866, and between Chard Junction and Chard Joint (or Central as it was later known) from 1866 to 1962. These were operated by the LSWR until 1916 and then by the GWR, although only very seldom were they advertised as running through to Taunton on the latter's branch. Proposed reopening There are proposals to re-open Chard Junction as part of a Chard town regeneration scheme; this has the support of Mayor Martin Wale, and both the current MP for Yeovil Marcus Fysh, and the former MP David Laws. Whilst the station has been unused since 1966, the site has been subject to protection in planning terms from redevelopment that would preclude the station being reopened for passenger and as a possible freight terminal. In 2010 the site was sold by the former British Railways Board and offered to Somerset County Council who declined to buy it as they thought it would cost too much money to re-open it. Based solely upon this statement the Local Planning Authority South Somerset District Council are currently stating that they will no longer protect the site in planning terms from redevelopment. In January 2012 a planning application for a concrete batching facility was lodged by Darch and Sons, currently this application is being deliberated by South Somerset District Council and as a result a campaign group has been set up to try and protect the station site from development and to get the planning protection reinstated. Supporters of the campaign include David Laws MP, County and District Councillors and the local newspaper the Chard and Ilminster News. The support group has accused the Local Planning Authority and County Council of \\"following in the footsteps of Beeching\\". Following the Governments support for expanding the railway network it has been proposed that Chard Junction could reopen. In January 2018, Devon County Council agreed to re-examine the proposals to reopen the station.RAIL Issue 843 p.14 In May 2018, a Transport Strategy recommended the reopening of the station to passengers.

She won two silver medals at the 1965 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships in Spittal, earning them in the C2 Mixed and C2 Mixed Team events. She also won a silver medal in the individual C2 Mixed Whitewater Downriver (Classic Race) event and a gold medal in the C2 Mixed Team Whitewater Downriver (Classic Race) event at the 1965 ICF Wildwater Canoeing World Championships, likewise held in Spittal. Ji≈ôina's career began in then Czechoslovakia and ended in the United States. She is credited with being the first woman to steer a whitewater canoe in slalom competitions as part of a two-person, mixed-gender team. Until that time, conventional wisdom held that women, by nature of their gender, were probably incapable of directing a boat through a course of gates set up over river rapids.  Early life  Ji≈ôina was the eldest of three children born into a modest household. Extremely active in sports, she participated in track and field, gymnastics, and competitive swimming, particularly breaststroke. She also sang first string for her elementary school choir and excelled at her studies, including physics. Watercolor painting was a beloved hobby. An engineer, her father suffered injuries to his hands that rendered him incapable of carrying on his profession. Her mother, a small business owner, was labeled a \\"capitalist\\" and forcibly placed in a factory by the occupying Soviets a few years after the conclusion of WWII. The private store she ran was confiscated by the communist political presence during the 1948 nationalization of private enterprises. During her childhood, she cared for her family and the home. From the age of 8, Ji≈ôina's household duties consisted of preparing meals, doing laundry, making beds, scrubbing floors, washing dishes, and cleaning windows. The family often struggled to feed itself and Ji≈ôina and her two younger brothers, Otto and Mirek, frequently attended school without packed lunches. As a teenager, Ji≈ôina studied foreign relations in a secondary education program which would prepare her for work placement later on. Otherwise, chaperoned by her mother, she attended dance classes and events, such as debutante balls, beginning at age 16. They occupied much of her free time.  Employment & higher education years  Any Czechoslovak citizen who had completed secondary education was assigned a national employer for a period of 2‚Äì3 years. The import/export company Artia received Ji≈ôina in 1958. Shortly thereafter, she began university correspondence courses in economics. On NYE 1961, she met her soon-to-be first husband, Josef ≈†edivec, on a ski slope.  Early training & competitions  Josef invited Ji≈ôina to begin training with him and eventually they formed a C2 mixed team for a club in Prague. He had lost his former steering partner over personality conflicts. In the spring of 1962, they began competing. During the period from 1962-1964, they continued winning domestic downriver and slalom events. On November 23, 1963, the two married and began racing under the names ≈†edivcov√°-≈†edivec. Their grueling practices of five hours in total split between mornings and afternoons six days a week, regardless of the season, included time in the waters of the Vltava, even in the dead of winter with the river partially frozen over.  Later competitions  They first journeyed to Austria to do some sightseeing and run several of the country's rivers in 1964. As unknowns, they participated in an international slalom race on the Drava River outside of Spittal while there. With the international whitewater community looking on, Ji≈ôina and Josef defeated the standing C2 mixed world champions from East Germany. Their surprise victory resonated throughout the racing community and tales of the upset appeared in local sports magazines. Upon their return home, they were made members of the Czechoslovak national whitewater team. They represented then Czechoslovakia at the 1965 ICF world championship in Spittal and won silver in the individual C2 Mixed Slalom, silver in the team C2 Mixed Slalom, silver in the individual C2 Mixed Whitewater Downriver (Classic Race), and gold in the team C2 Mixed Whitewater Downriver (Classic Race) competitions. Ji≈ôina and Josef continued to dominate the Czechoslovak national race circuit until they left the country in 1968, frequently placing first.  Emigration & first years in the United States  In August 1968, Ji≈ôina and Josef left Czechoslovakia given the Russian invasion and occupation. After spending several months in Eindhoven, Netherlands, they emigrated to California, United States, in March 1969.  Later Years  ...

The mountain rises to above sea level about 12 km west of Rathdowney. The original indigenous name for the mountain is Wahlmoorum which means sand goanna in the Yuggera language. Another aboriginal name documented for the mountain is Dahl-moor-uhn, which means \\"big fellow waterhole bunyip\\" attributed to two small yet deep lagoons, on the summit of the mountain. The earliest photograph of the lagoons are from 1910. The current name for the mountain comes from the first grazing property in the area called Maroon. Mount Maroon consists mainly of rhyolite and has its geological origins in the cooling of molten rock beneath the surface. The mountain was first gazetted in 1938 as Mount Maroon National Park. In 1950, Mount Barney National Park was extended to include Mount Maroon and nearby Mount May. The mountain contains areas of montane heath vegetation, rocky pavement and mallee ash shrublands.Mount Barney National Park: Visitor Information[brochure].

(Peromyscus nesodytes) became extinct approximately 8000 years BP and lived during the late Pleistocene on California‚Äôs Channel Islands.Guthrie, D.A. (1993). New information on the prehistoric fauna of San Miguel Island: in F.G. Hochberg, ed., Third Channel Islands symposium, Santa Barbara, CA, Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, p. 405-416. Overview In 1934, Robert W. Wilson designated P. nesodytes as a new species after discovering a mouse bone (a right ramus of the mandible). He writes, ‚ÄúThe outstanding character of P. nesodytes is its large size, which is greater than any living species of Peromyscus native to the United States.‚Äù The only larger mice known are the extant mice of the genus Megadontomys found in Mexico and Central America. The mouse ‚Äúgenerally considered ancestral to P. nesodytes‚Äù is Peromyscus anyapahensis.Guthrie, D.A. (1998). Fossil Vertebrates From Pleistocene Terrestrial Deposits on the Northern Channel Islands, Southern California: in Weigand, P.W., ed., Contributions to the geology of the Northern Channel Islands, Southern California: American Association of Petroleum Geologists, Pacific Section. MP 45. Another relative, P. anyapahensis, is also extinct; it is smaller in body size than P. nesodytes.White, J.A. (1966). A new Peromyscus from the late Pleistocene of Anacapa Island, California, with notes on variation in Peromyscus Nesodytes: Los Angeles County Museum Contributions in Science no. 96, p. 1-8. The extreme size of P. nesodytes follows Foster's rule of insular gigantism and dwarfism, in which some rodent species attain greater body size following their occupation of islands lacking a multitude of predators.Wenner, A.M. and D.L. Johnson (1980). Land vertebrates on the California Channel Islands: Sweepstakes or Bridges? in D.M. Powers, ed. The California Islands, proceedings of a multi-disciplinary symposium, Santa Barbara, CA, Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, p 497-530. Habitat The habitat of P. nesodytes was confined to the northern Channel Islands. Remains of P. nesodytes have been found on San Miguel Island and Santa Rosa Island. The northern Channel Islands once comprised a ‚Äúsuper-island‚Äù called Santa Rosae; increased sea levels have separated the islands for thousands of years. Extinction P. nesodytes probably became extinct following the possibly accidental introduction of a smaller mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, by the Chumash people, who lived in the Santa Barbara area. The Chumash traded on the northern Channel Islands and could have been unknowing transporters of P. maniculatus to the islands. It has been noted that, on occasion, individuals of P. maniculatus could have secreted themselves in baskets of food and been unintentionally conveyed by boat to the islands for trading purposes.Walker, P. (1980). Archaeological evidence for the recent extinction of three terrestrial mammals on San Miguel Island: in D.M. Powers, ed. The California Islands, proceedings of a multi-disciplinary symposium, Santa Barbara, CA, Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, p. 703-717. P. maniculatus probably fared better at avoiding the most frequent mouse predator on the islands, the barn owl, than did P. nesodytes. A possible example of this appears in Daisy Cave, an archaeological site on San Miguel Island. Cave floor layers show fewer P. maniculatus remains in the older, deeper levels than in the newer, upper levels. Barn owls may have preferentially preyed on the larger species, P. nesodytes, rather than on the smaller P. maniculatus.

He began his career serving as the sevir equitum Romanorum at the annual review of the equites. His first political appointment was as the Triumvir Monetalis, followed by a posting as Quaestor in some unknown province.Mennen, pg. 124 This was followed by his being appointed Quaestor urbanus, after which he filled the office of Praetor tutelaris (the official responsible for matters of guardianship). Then in AD 233, Valerius Maximus was made consul prior alongside Gnaeus Cornelius Paternus. For his proconsular command, Valerius Maximus was appointed Curator alvi Tiberis riparum cloacarumque sacrae urbis (responsible for maintaining the sewers and the banks of the Tiber river within the city of Rome). In AD 238, Valerius Maximus was one of the Italian nobility who was involved in the senatorial revolt against the emperor Maximinus Thrax. He perhaps had a role in the negotiations which saw Gordian I offered the imperial office, and was the Comes Augusti of one of the replacement emperors, Pupienus. During that year he was also one of the vigintivirs.Mennen, pg. 126 This was followed by his appointment as Curator Laurentium Lavinatium. Apparently falling out of imperial favour during the reign of Philip the Arab, Valerius Maximus regained high political office during the reign of the emperor Valerian with his appointment as Praefectus Urbi of Rome in AD 255. This was followed in the following year with his second consulship, this time serving with Marcus Acilius Glabrio.

The Mariinsky Theater Second Stage is the second part of a theatre complex which is made up of the original 1860 Mariinsky Theatre and the 2007 Mariinsky Theatre Concert Hall. The Second Stage has been completed and a gala concert celebrating the opening, and featuring such luminaries as Pl√°cido Domingo, Rene Pape, Anna Netrebko, and many others, was presented on 2 May 2013.Miriam Elder and Imogen Tilden, \\"Russians hope Mariinsky II will revive Saint Petersburg as cultural capital: Vladimir Putin is to attend gala concert for opening of new ballet and opera house, 10 years in development\\", The Guardian (London), 2 May 2013 The concert also celebrated the sixtieth birthday of musical director Valery Gergiev. The post-modernist French architect Dominique Perrault won a much-publicised contest for his design for a new home for the theatre, \\"Competition winner - Dominique Perrault - Opera House Mariinsky II - Saint Petersburg, Russia\\", 7 July 2003. Original design plans and photos of the model from arcspace.com retrieved 2 August 2009 which is to be located adjacent to the current building. At the same time, the historic original structure had been due to undergo a complete renovation and this was planned to begin in the Autumn 2006. After seeing projected costs rise to $244 million (U.S.) from $100 million, the Russian government announced in November 2008 that it was killing the Perrault plan. The Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin overruled both Valery Gergiev (the artistic director of the Mariinsky Theatre) and the Minister for Culture, announcing in early June 2009 that there would be a new competition to solicit proposals. A total of 15 proposals were received, a list which was then shortened to five. \\"We wanted to give the impression that although we were in a tense situation and we didn't want to delay forever ... no one felt like it was the best way to simply sit down quietly and say, 'You are a great architect; just come and do it,'\\" Mr. Gergiev explained. With a budget of ‚Ç¨295-million (about US $452-million), all of which will be paid by the Russian government with a completion date of no later than December 2011, the Canadian firm, Diamond and Schmitt Architects, Diamond + Schmitt Architects website, in English prevailed over four other finalists, one of which came from Germany and three from Russia. The building has been hyped as \\"Russia's most important building project in 70 years\\". As noted by Mr. Diamond, (it is) \\"the first major opera house to be built in Russia since the Czars.\\" James Adams, \\"From Toronto with love, a new theatre for St. Petersburg: Diamond + Schmitt describes its plan for the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg as ‚Äòa contemporary version of the St. Petersburg cityscape' \\", The Globe and Mail (Toronto), 29 July 2009, on theglobeandmail.com  Building construction history Construction progress as of June 2009 Aerial view: old building of the Mariinsky Theater at the left, the Second stage at the right At the end of the design competition for The Second Stage of the Mariinsky Theater in 2003, 11 proposals had been received. The winner was well-known French architect Dominique Perrault with ¬´a gold cocoon¬ª (an external cover of a building of the wrong form from glass and aluminium). By 2005 experts discovered that detailed proposals presented by the competition winner did not meet Russian building codes. They failed to include sections relating to water supply, drainage, and ventilation. The result was that in 2007, FGU (\\"Northwest management on building, reconstruction and restorations\\") terminated the contract with the French architectural firm. However, in June of that year the new general contractor, \\"Joint-Stock Company \\"NPO\\" Georeconstruction-fundamentproekt\\", in a short space of time removed all 286 obstacles shown on the working drawings of Perrault. As had become clear, the winning design was far from that presented when it won the international competition. In particular, it was necessary to make changes - based on the Saint Petersburg climate - in order to strengthen load-bearing structures above which the gold cuplola would be located. As a result, the building would not look so open to the air. By July, the project had been simplified as much as possible, and it was determined that it would \\"not intrude so much into the existing city environment\\", Gergiev said. The height of the building was reduced and other elements were also reconsidered. In 2008 the foundation work for the building of the theatre continued, but by April, it was found that the consistency of the soil under the construction area was unpredictable. (Later builders have compared the properties of the soil to those of sour cream). In order to overcome these problems, the builders strengthened the consistency of the soil to a depth of 12 to 14 metres and, as a result, cost estimates had to be increased. Also, the builders informed the authorities that the construction of a glass dome, as planned by Dominique Perrault's architectural firm, was impossible. Therefore that part of the project would have to be changed. By June, the project had a new local architect partner, KB ViPS Architects, a firm working on high-rise and underground construction, and it became the third firm to work on the building. During 2009 foundation work was completed. Valery Gutovsky, the director of KB ViPS Architects, a specialist in high-rise and underground construction, became the new head of construction for the project., and on 29 May Vladimir Putin held a meeting at which he confirmed that the building would be completed in 2011 at the cost estimated in the published budget. On 28 July the result of the last competition was announced, the winner being KB ViPS Architects, a specialist in high-rise and underground construction. Within a month, a contract was signed with that company and construction proceeded, with some parts of the building then reaching a height 5 metres. At the same time, according to Valery Gutovsky, the project was to be submitted to the town-planning council of St. Petersburg in October 2009 and to Glavgosekspertiza (\\"The General State Expert Review Department of the State Committee for Construction, Housing and Utilities\\" which was authorized to perform the state expert review of all projects by spring 2010. The construction cost was estimated at 8.5 billion roubles. Architecture and interior The theater has been described as too modern and not modern enough, too ambitious and too restrained. The theater was built on a surface of 567,700 square foot, has 2000 seats and facilities for 2,500 staff members.E-architect about the theater The last architect Diamond Schmitt Architects finished the design by creating an onyx wall which is visible from outside and illuminated. The lobby has a modern style with several straight and spiral staircases with glass balustrades. For the glass stairs and balustrades Diamond Schmitt Architects co-operated with Malishev Engineers, who were instrumental in designing Award Winning structures, most notably 36m long structural glass stair (first use of structural glass in public building in Russia) and large 100t spiral staircase which is hung from the ceiling.

During his summer breaks from university he would teach school in Saskatchewan. After graduation, he decided to settle in the province and established his medical practice at Hague, Saskatchewan in 1909. Politics He entered politics and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in the 1921 provincial election as the Liberal MLA for Rosthern. Uhrich was appointed to the provincial cabinet in 1922 by Premier Charles Dunning and served as provincial secretary until 1923 when he was appointed the province's first Minister of Public Health. Under Uhrich the province expanded its role in the hospital system, which had been largely locally run to that point, and increased the number of hospitals. He also began public inspection of water and milk supplies and immunization programs against diphtheria and smallpox. In 1929, the government assumed the cost of treating tuberculosis. After being re-elected in the 1925 provincial election the Liberal government was defeated in 1929 and Uhrich, who was personally re- elected, moved to the opposition benches.

He was then appointed the Triumvir capitalis (or manager of the prisons), probably for a year. Next, he was an imperial candidate for the office of Quaestor, and this was followed by his candidature for the office of Praetor tutelaris (the official responsible for matters of guardianship), which he probably was nominated for prior to AD 240.Mennen, pg. 124 Valerius Balbinus Maximus was then appointed as Legatus proconsulis in the province of Asia. He reached the office of consul in AD 253, serving as consul posterior alongside the emperor Volusianus, until Volusianus was murdered in the first few months of that year.

It was established in July 1963 for research in epidemiology and control of communicable diseases and to reorganize the activities of the Malaria Institute of India (MII). Currently it has eight branches at Alwar, Bengaluru, Trivandrum, Calicut, Coonoor, Jagdalpur, Patna, Rajahmundry and Varanasi to advise the respective state governments on public health. The headquarters are in Sham Nath Marg in New Delhi. History Director S.P. Ramakrishnan at the sign for the newly renamed Central Institute for Communicable Diseases (ca. 1964). Credit: Wellcome Institute The origin of NCDC can be traced back to Central Malaria Bureau, which was established at Kasauli, Himachal Pradesh, India in 1909. It was renamed as the Malaria Institute of India in 1938 and in 1963 renamed as the NICD. The reorganized Institute was established to develop a national centre for teaching and research in various disciplines of epidemiology and control of communicable diseases. The Institute was envisaged to act as a centre par excellence for providing multi disciplinary and integrated expertise in the control of communicable disease. The Institute was also entrusted the task of developing reliable rapid economic epidemiological tools which could be effectively applied in the field for the control of communicable diseases. The objectives of the Institute broadly cover three activities - training, service and operational research in the field of communicable diseases and their prevention and control in the country. The centre is under affiliation with Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi. The Centre for AIDS & Related Diseases was established at National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) as a National Reference Laboratory as per NACO guidelines in the year 2002. Prior to this it had existed as AIDS Reference Laboratory since 1985, one of the first reference centers in India, which started surveillance of HIV infection in the country. On 30 July 2009, it was named as National Centre for Disease Control. Divisions NCDC has fourteen technical centres/divisions under it namely *Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) *Centre for AIDS and Related Diseases (CARD) *Epidemiology division * Division of Malariology & Coordination (M&C;) * Helminthology division * Biochemistry and Toxicology *Biotechnology division * Microbiology division * Medical Entomology and vector management division (CME&VM;) * Zoonosis division *Division of Parasitic Disease (DPD) *Centre for Environment and Occupational Health (CE&OH;) *Centre for Non-Communicable Diseases (CNCD) *Statistical Monitoring and Evaluation Centre (SM&EC;)  Budget and operations  NCDC has a staff of 434 officers and officials. The budget allocation for the fiscal year 2017 was ‚Çπ233.04 crores (approx. $35 million). Activities Doctors from NCDC had been previously summoned to investigate potential outbreaks of diseases including suspected cases of Pneumonic plague in Punjab in 2002, SARS outbreaks in 2004, meningitis outbreak in Delhi in 2005, and avian influenza in 2006, and have reviewed preparedness for coronavirus in 2019‚Äì2020. Global Disease Detection The NCDC in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has set up the Global Disease Detection (GDD) Regional Center in New Delhi, India. This will lead to long-term public health collaboration between the Government of India and the United States in many areas including establishing high quality research and surveillance on important human infectious diseases, establishing the Indian EIS (Epidemiological Intelligence System) program, and developing the NCDC as an international nodal agency in South Asia.

He was born in Glengarry County, Ontario and educated at McGill University where he earned his medical degree before undertaking post-graduate studies at the University of Edinburgh. Munroe subsequently settled in Saskatchewan where he established his medical practice. He was involved in local and provincial politics - he was defeated as a candidate for the Provincial Rights Party in the 1905 provincial election when he was a candidate in Saskatoon County. In the 1912 provincial election he ran as the Conservative candidate in Saskatoon City but was again defeated. He served in World War I as a lieutenant colonel and was appointed Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for his military service. He returned to Saskatchewan after the war and resumed his medical practice and political activity. He was appointed lieutenant governor of the province by Conservative federal Prime Minister R.B. Bennett in 1931. In the midsts of the economic crisis, Muroe used his office to raise money for relief projects and charity. Nevertheless, many Canadians viewed the ceremonial office as a frivolity and excess during times of hardship and there was a movement to abolish the position. However, the provincial Legislature overwhelmingly defeated a motion to suspend the Office of the Lieutenant- Governor in 1934. Munroe retired from office in 1936.

The climate of south-west England is classed as oceanic (Cfb) according to the K√∂ppen climate classification. The oceanic climate is typified by cool winters with warmer summers and precipitation all year round, with more experienced in winter. Annual rainfall is about and up to on higher ground. Summer maxima averages range from to and winter minima averages range from to across the south-west. It is the second windiest area of the United Kingdom, the majority of winds coming from the south-west and north-east. Government organisations predict the area will experience a rise in temperature and become the hottest region in the United Kingdom. Inland areas of low altitude experience the least amount of precipitation. They have the highest summer maxima temperatures, but winter minima are lower than those of the coast. Snowfalls are more frequent in comparison to the coast, but less so in comparison to higher ground. They experience the lowest wind speeds and the total sunshine hours are between those of the coast and the moors. This typical climate of inland areas is more noticeable the further north-east into the region. In comparison to inland areas, the coast experiences high minimum temperatures, especially in winter, and slightly lower maximum temperatures during the summer. Rainfall is lowest at the coast and snowfall there is rarer than the rest of the region. Coastal areas are the windiest parts of the peninsula and they receive the most sunshine. The general coastal climate becomes more prevalent further south-west into the region. The south-west has areas of moorland inland such as Bodmin Moor, Dartmoor and Exmoor. Because of their high altitude they experience lower temperatures and more precipitation than the rest of the south west (approximately twice as much rainfall as lowland areas). Both of these factors also result in the highest levels of snowfall and the lowest levels of sunshine. Exposed areas of the moors are windier than the lowlands and can be almost as windy as the coast.  Definition  Information in this article relates to the Met Office definition of south-west England, which covers Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, North Somerset, Bath and North East Somerset, South Gloucestershire, the City of Bristol and the Isles of Scilly. This is a smaller area than the UK Government's South West England region, which also covers Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and Dorset. The region is also sometimes loosely described as the West Country.  Temperature  The south-west experiences a seasonal temperature variation, although it is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom. This is because the sea is in closer proximity to inland areas of the south-west than inland areas of most of the United Kingdom and the sea has less seasonal temperature variance. The sea is coldest between February and March; as a result Cornwall and Devon are coldest in February with daily minima ranging from in inland Devon to on the Isles of Scilly. The sea has less influence towards the north-east of the region, causing January to be the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures from or . In the months of July and August (the hottest part of the year) daily maxima range from about on the coast of Cornwall to across inland areas of the north- east (Somerset and North Somerset) and also Exeter due to being situated in the Eastern Lee of Dartmoor . Graph of monthly minimum and maximum temperatures The sea surrounding the south-west peninsula has the highest annual mean temperature of any sea in the United Kingdom, with a temperature close to ‚Äî . Coastal areas of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly experience annual mean temperatures similar to that of the sea as the prevailing wind is from the sea. Towards the north-east of the region, the annual mean temperature decreases and is closer to just over 10 ¬∞C/51 ¬∞F. The sea's influence on annual temperature range is highest in west Cornwall, where the range is approximately 9 ¬∞C/14 ¬∞F. In the north-east of the region, the range is approximately 12 ¬∞C/22 ¬∞F. Inland areas are affected by their altitude: the mean temperature decreases as altitude increases. Princetown on Dartmoor, with an altitude of , has a mean temperature of . The sea's influence in the south- west usually prevents cold temperatures, however temperatures can plummet during periods of cold easterly air flow: all of which have been recorded in January. In 1987 the minimum temperature recorded at St Mawgan, Cornwall was and was noted on the Isles of Scilly. Inland areas have experienced even colder conditions with at Exeter International Airport, Devon in 1958 and at Bastreet, Cornwall in 1979. Further to the north-east of the region, temperatures reached in Yeovilton, Somerset in 1982. Extremely high temperatures (heat waves) are rare in the south-west. Their occurrence is caused by a dry south-easterly air flow off Mainland Europe or the short-lived 'Spanish plume', (caused when low pressure sat to the south west of the UK and High pressure over the Low countries /southern North Sea creates a southerly airflow that sucks up hot air originating from Iberia, and as it crosses Bay of Biscay it picks up moisture and raises humidity levels to uncomfortable levels). Combined with strong summer sunshine, the temperature rockets: The hottest recorded temperature in the south west is , on 3 August 1990, at Saunton Sands, Devon. Overnight lows can be uncomfortable, not dropping below 19-20¬∞C(66-68¬∞F).  Sunshine  In June 1925, Pendennis Point (castle pictured) recorded the most monthly sunshine in the south-west. Average annual sunshine totals rise above 1,600 hours along the coast‚Äîhigher totals are recorded on the region's southern coast at the English Channel than on its northern coast along the Bristol Channel. 1,400‚Äì1,600 hours of annual sunshine are to be expected in inland areas of the south west. In June 1925, the highest monthly sunshine totals were recorded: 381.7 hours at Pendennis Point, Cornwall and 334.8 hours at Long Ashton, Somerset. During the winter months, which are the dullest, less than 20 hours of monthly sunshine have occasionally been recorded. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. In general, June is the sunniest month, because the days are at their longest, and December is the dullest. The Azores high pressure system affects the south-west of England as it extends north- eastwards towards the British Isles. The Azores is more influential in summer. The high pressure reduces cloud cover through the process of subsidence. In spring and summer, the sea is cool compared to the air temperature, causing less convective cloud cover. The convective cloud forms more frequently inland, especially on higher ground such as Dartmoor, Exmoor and Bodmin Moor, thus reducing the amount of sunshine. Coastal areas of the south-west have more hours of sunshine.  Rainfall  Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. A topographical map looks very similar to a map of rainfall with more rain over higher ground and less at the coast. South west Great Britain (physical, with large towns) The Isles of Scilly have annual rainfall totals of about 850‚Äì900 mm (33‚Äì35 in). Coastal areas of Cornwall and Devon typically receive 900‚Äì1,000 mm (35‚Äì39 in) of rainfall annually. The altitude increases the amount of rainfall. Highland areas are cooler, causing moist air to cool below the dew point as it rises over high ground forming clouds and then rain. Princetown is from Plymouth and higher, and has double the rainfall. Areas that fall in the rain shadows (lees) of higher ground have lower levels of rainfall: near Exeter (east of Dartmoor) and in parts of central Somerset (east of Exmoor). The Mendip Hills, to the north-east of the region, receive over per year and the Bath-Bristol area receives around 800‚Äì900 mm (31‚Äì35 in). The sea reaches its highest temperature in late summer/autumn and its lowest in late winter/spring. As a result, the highest rainfall can be expected in autumn and lowest in spring. The months with the most rainfall are in autumn and winter. Monthly rainfall can be variable. On the coast, most months have recorded less than and, some months, less than at some point. The wettest station of the region, Princetown, has recorded of rain during May. The number of days with at least of rainfall correlates to the pattern of quantity of rainfall. In late spring/summer, 9‚Äì10 days per month recorded rain in coastal areas, 7‚Äì9 days in the north-east and 12‚Äì13 days at high altitude (Princetown). In winter these values increase to 15‚Äì16 on the coast, 12‚Äì13 in the north-east and over 18 days in high altitude. Very heavy rainfall-‚Äîspanning 5‚Äì15 hours‚Äî-is rare in the south-west. Such incidences include the Lynmouth disaster of 15 August 1952, caused by of rainfall falling locally on Exmoor over 12 hours. Also, on 8 June 1957, fell at Camelford, Cornwall and in June 1917, fell in 13 hours in Bruton, Somerset. The north- Cornish village of Boscastle was flooded on 16 August 2004; a peak hourly rainfall of was recorded. Approximately 100 people had to be rescued by helicopter and 116 cars were swept out to sea. From December 2013 onwards the Somerset Levels suffered severe flooding as part of the wider winter storms of 2013‚Äì14 in the United Kingdom. The Levels are a low-lying area around above mean sea level (O.D.) which have been prone to flooding from fresh water and occasional salt water inundations. People have attempted to drain the area for hundreds of years. During December 2013 and January 2014 heavy rainfall led to extensive flooding with over 600 houses and of agricultural land, including North Moor, Curry and Hay Moors and Greylake, affected. The village of Thorney was abandoned and Muchelney cut off.  Snowfall  February 2009, the area around Okehampton, Dartmoor, received of snow accretion. Snowfall normally occurs between November and April and short snowfalls can occur between October and May on higher ground. The snow usually only settles between the months of December and March. Snow rarely falls when temperatures are greater than and for snow to settle temperatures must normally be lower than . In the south-west the number of days of snowfall increases with altitude: per approximately every increase in altitude, the number of days of snow falling increases by five days. From 1979 to 2000, on average there were fewer than 10 days per winter in which snow fell in the islands of the south-west and the coastal areas of Devon and Cornwall, and slightly more than 10 days on average near to the Severn Estuary. Inland areas received between 8‚Äì15 days of snow falling; more days of snow fall were noted particularly to the north-east. Some upland areas received, on average, over 25 days per year of snow falling. Similarly to the ratio of days of snow falling to altitude, the number of days in which snow settles on the ground increases by five days per every increase in altitude. In the south-west, it is rare that snow settles on the ground. From 1979 to 2000 on average, lowland areas did not record any lying snow in one out of every three years. During this period, snow settled, on average, fewer than three days per year across the Isles of Scilly and on the coasts of Devon and Cornwall. Inland areas had an average of 5‚Äì10 days of snow lying per year and, as with the days of snow falling; this was higher towards the north- east of the region. More than 20 days of snow lying can be expected on the high grounds of Dartmoor and Exmoor. The south-west, although the mildest region of the British Isles, has been affected by some of the most severe blizzards. Blizzards are a rare occurrence in the United Kingdom, but can occur when especially cold easterly winds from the continent meet an Atlantic depression, causing a prolonged snowstorm and high winds. This occurred in February 1978, when of snow accumulated in inland Devon and on Dartmoor and Exmoor, caused by winds at . In January 1982, snow drifts were deep around the Bristol area. Convective showers on 12 January 1987 left parts of Cornwall with deep snow: at Falmouth, Penzance and on the Isles of Scilly.  Wind  The south-west is the second most exposed area of the United Kingdom; second to western Scotland. The strong winds are caused by deep depressions across or close to the British Isles. Winds are stronger in the winter-half year, as the depressions' strength and frequency increase. The lightest mean wind speeds are in summer. The speed of peak gusts and mean wind speed follow a similar pattern throughout the year. Mean wind speeds are generally lower to the north-east of the region and in inland areas. Yeovilton, lowland Somerset, has a mean wind speed that is two thirds that of St. Mawgan in coastal Cornwall. An increase in altitude in inland areas generally increases the mean wind speed; similar wind speeds are recorded on the highest parts of Exmoor and Dartmoor as on the coast. Carland Cross Wind Farm, Cornwall The majority, and the strongest, of the winds are from the south-west and north-east as Atlantic depressions pass from west to east over the United Kingdom. When an Atlantic depression reaches the United Kingdom, winds usually blow from the south or south-west, and they change to west or north-west when the depression leaves. If a depression passes along the English Channel, strong winds can occur from the east or north-east. Due to anticyclogenesis over Scandinavia, the majority of winds in Spring are from the north-east. Coastal areas of the south-west usually experience calm or very light winds that do not have a classifiable wind direction less than 6% of the time; this figure is 15% in the north-east and inland areas. Islands and exposed headlands have the highest number of days per year of gale-force winds (averaged out over ten consecutive minutes). A gale-force wind is defined as being at least , which is 8 on the modern Beaufort scale. Gales are recorded approximately 24 days per year in the Isles of Scilly and coastal Cornwall. Further north-east and further inland, the number of days decreases. Plymouth, coastal Devon, receives 16 days; Yeovilton, Somerset, receives seven; and Long Ashton, north-west Somerset, receives four. Wind speeds can vary on local topography: wooded or urban areas sheltered by hills receive fewer days of gales and lower wind speeds. On 15 December 1979, there were gusts of at Lizard Point, Cornwall at St Mary's, Isles of Scilly and at Gwennap Head, Cornwall. Widespread winds from the Burns' Day storm on 25 January 1990 overturned vehicles and damaged buildings. It caused the highest wind speed during the 1971‚Äì2001 period to be recorded in two stations: at Plymouth and at St Mawgan. was recorded on top of a building in Bristol as well as at Exeter International Airport and at Yeovilton. At Plymouth, the maximum hourly mean speed was and at Yeovilton, . The Bristol Channel floods on 30 January 1607 apparently caused \\"many thousand\\" deaths and may have destroyed several small harbours. The cause of it is disputed to be either a European windstorm or a tsunami.  Future  Rising temperatures could lead to citrus cultivation According to a study by the Met Office, within 40 years the average temperature is likely to increase by 2 ¬∞C (4 ¬∞F) in the south-west and the average warmest summer day will increase by 3 ¬∞C (6 ¬∞F) to be . It predicts that the region will have one of the highest annual temperatures in the United Kingdom and there will be an estimated increase in winter precipitation. The rise in temperature could lead to outdoor citrus cultivation being possible. Sea level rises could cause spring tides to rise over many of the region's harbour walls and an increase in sea level by about at Newlyn. Following the announcement, the government of the United Kingdom called on the local authorities and other organisation to prepare for the consequences. All major government investments will have to consider the risks as a result of future climate change. A report from the Environment Agency said that, over the next 25 years, investment would need to double for the building and upkeep of flood defences in order to maintain the current levels of flood protection and counter the effects of climate change. Flooding from rivers and the sea currently puts 65,369 properties at risk in Devon and Cornwall, 29,577 of which are at \\"significant risk\\". Current flood defence schemes protect some of these properties from flooding. Richard Cresswell, the regional director for the Environment Agency in the south west, said: > \\"The latest UK climate change data shows that the risk of flooding and > coastal erosion will continue to increase in future due to rising sea levels > and more frequent and heavy storms.\\" ¬£357 million on flood risk management in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, South Gloucestershire and Wiltshire has been spent since 2002, which includes spending continuing into 2009/10. Rising sea levels are likely to cause more flooding on the Somerset Levels. Since 1990 the drainage board has been charged with looking at the rhynes, cleaning them out and keeping them clear, with the Environment Agency overseeing the work. With rising sea levels the work required to maintain the current sea defences is likely to become more expensive and it has been proposed by Ian Liddell-Grainger (Bridgwater-MP), that two inland seas are created.

Further, the order of such queries is dependent on the structure of the choice situation or task, and can influence retrieval of information, leading to different decisions. This is a descriptive model that attempts to explain why individuals make a decision, rather than propose an optimal decision.  Applied to the Endowment Effect  Query theory was initially developed by Eric J. Johnson, Gerald H√§ubl, and Anat KeinanJohnson, E. J., H√§ubl, G., & Keinan, A. (2007). Aspects of endowment: A query theory of value construction. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 33, 461 ‚Äì 474. as an attempt to explain the endowment effect. This effect is, empirically, a difference between the price at which an individual is willing to purchase an object and the price at which they are willing to sell the same object. Endowment effects are traditionally explained as resulting from the investment of value based on ownership. In other words, individuals demand more money for a product they already own based upon that ownership, similar to the concept of loss aversion. A view from Query Theory, however, argues that this difference is not based in ownership, but in the thought processes involved in constructing the price judgment. Query theory argues that when an individual is asked to give the amount of money they would be willing to purchase the product for (Willingness to Pay or WTP) or willing to sell the product for (Willingness to Accept, or WTA), a series of mental queries must be addressed. For both parties, the queries are the same (such as ‚ÄúWhat reasons are there for owning this product‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat reasons are there for not owning this product‚Äù), however the order in which they are processed differs. For sellers, it is theorized that the query focusing on the positives of purchasing the product is executed before the query focusing on the negatives. For buyers, the opposite order is theorized. As the theory proposes that these queries are processed serially (one after the other, not simultaneously), the first query receives more processing power, and thus is more influential. Furthermore, it is possible that the answers to this first query may interfere with subsequent responses. This argument, supported by empirical results over a series of experiments, explains the endowment effect simply. Buyers having more negative reasons available to them (thus lowering the price judgment) and sellers having more positive reasons available (raising the price judgment). When order is manipulated by specifically requesting the individual to focus first on a non-default query (e.g., sellers asked to think first about negatives of the purchase), the endowment effect is minimized or absent altogether.  Model  Query theory, in its simplest form, holds that: 1\\\\. Judgments or choices are constructed based on the responses to a series of mental questions or queries. 2\\\\. These queries are processed serially (as opposed to simultaneously). 3\\\\. Earlier queries produce a larger and richer set of responses compared to later queries, due to both cognitive processing limits and interference of the first queries‚Äô responses on subsequent queries.  Measures  In order to understand how an individual makes their decision, query theory researchers rely on asking individuals to list thoughts and reasons they consider when making their decision. These are referred to as ‚Äúaspects‚Äù. It is common for individuals to write these aspects down either on paper or by using a custom piece of software known as aspect lister. A statistical method used for analyzing the tendency of an individual to produce value-increasing aspects before value-decreasing is the standardized median rank difference (SMRD). This statistic is calculated as the 2(MRi ‚Äì MRd)/n where MRd is defined as the median rank of value decreasing statements in a participant‚Äôs sequence, MRi is the median rank of value increasing statements, and n is the total number of aspects. SMRD can be between 1 (all value- increasing statements were listed before value-decreasing) to ‚àí1 (all value- decreasing statements were listed before value-increasing). In the endowment effect research discussed above, SMRD was higher (.62) for sellers than for buyers (.26).

(fl. 4th century) was a Roman senator who was appointed consul in AD 327. Biography Valerius Maximus was a member of the fourth century patrician gens Valeria, and probably the son of Valerius Maximus Basilius, urban prefect of Rome in 319. He served as the Vicarius Orientis in AD 325 before being appointed the eastern Praetorian prefect, probably in late 326, when the emperor Constantine I returned from Italy. This was an unusual appointment, as the office of Praetorian prefect was reserved for members of the Equestrian order, not senators, and it displayed the emperor‚Äôs confidence in Valerius Maximus, allowing him to exercise command over the extensive resources of the east.Potter, David S., The Roman Empire at Bay: AD 180-395 (2004), pg. 389 He continued to serve Constantine in this role throughout 327 and 328, relinquishing the office in early 329 after Constantine returned from Gaul.Martindale & Jones, pg. 590 During this period, in AD 327, Valerius Maximus was appointed consul posterior, alongside Flavius Constantius. Then in late AD 331, he was probably sent to Gaul with the Caesar Constantius II, serving as Constantius‚Äô Praetorian Prefect. Valerius Maximus served him there until late 333 or early 334, when Constantius returned to his father‚Äôs court at Constantinople. In around AD 336, Valerius Maximus was appointed Praetorian Prefect for a third time, this time accompanying the Caesar Dalmatius to the provinces along the Danubian frontier, which had been assigned to him as the territory he was to manage, in Constantine‚Äôs planned administrative division of the empire. He served under Dalmatius until 337, when Valerius Maximus was replaced shortly before the murder of Dalmatius in the wake of the death of Constantine I.Martindale & Jones, pg. 591 It is speculated that Valerius Maximus was married twice. His first marriage may have been to a Septimia, a daughter of Septimius Bassus. They possibly had one son together, named Lucius Valerius Septimius Bassus. His second marriage was possibly to a Vulcacia, supposedly the daughter of a Neratius Junius Flavianus. It has been postulated that they had two children, a son, Valerius Maximus Basilius, and a daughter, Valeria, who may have become a Christian through her possible marriage to a Rufius Maecius Placidus.Settipani, Christian, Continuit√© gentilice et continuit√© s√©natoriale dans les familles s√©natoriales romaines √† l'√©poque imp√©riale, (2000) p. 229 AncestryNotesReferencesSources * Martindale, J.
