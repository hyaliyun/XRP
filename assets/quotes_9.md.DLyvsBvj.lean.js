He now owns 31% of Sport Pari, with the remainder held by a company belonging to the family of well-known tennis player and 2012 Olympic Champion Maxim Mirnyi.  Controversies, criticism =EU sanctions In 2011, after the wave of repressions that followed the 2010 presidential election in Belarus, the Council of the European Union listed Peftiev and his three companies BelTechExport, Sport Pari and BT Telecommunications as sanctioned entities.–ü–æ—û–Ω—ã —Å–ø—ñ—Å 208 –±–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å–∫—ñ—Ö —á—ã–Ω–æ—û–Ω—ñ–∫–∞—û, —è–∫—ñ–º –∑–∞–±–∞—Ä–æ–Ω–µ–Ω—ã —û–µ–∑–¥ —É –ï–° ‚Äì Nasha Niva, 11 October 2011 In the Council's decision, Peftiev has been described as follows: Peftiev protested the Council's decision in the General Court of the European Union. The team that defended Vladimir Peftiev in court included world famous specialists in the field of human rights, including: professor of Yale University and former President of Inter-American Commission on Human Rights Michael Reisman and former Director of International Law department of University of Bonn, General Director of the office of the Chancellor of Germany Helmut Kohl from 1992 to 1996, professor Rudolf Dolzer. At the end of October 2014, before the case had been decided, the sanctions were dropped by the EU Council.http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014D0750 On 9 December 2014, the General Court of European Union decided in Peftiev‚Äôs and his companies‚Äô favour, annulling the sanctions and ruling that the Council of the European Union and European Commission had made serious mistakes while evaluating Peftiev's business activities.http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid;=160487&pageIndex;=0&doclang;=EN&mode;=lst&dir;=&occ;=first‚àÇ=1&cid;=24475, part 7, \\"The plea in law concerning manifest errors of assessment,\\" articles 148‚Äì206. That was mentioned by professor Dolzer in his interview on May 8, 2018 to Latvian newspaper ‚ÄúDienas bizness‚Äù, in which he pointed out to the false information in the Internet that was used against Vladimir Peftiev, and namely with regard to illegal incomes of Mr. Peftiev, his Forbes rating, weapons exports to North Korea, Ivory Coast and China, his sponsoring of Lukashenko. The Council did not appeal the Court's decision. The European General Court‚Äôs judgment of 9 December 2014 concerning Peftiev reads, in part (clause 149): This decision of European General Court was left unattended by mass media. Moreover, various sources continued to publish disproved information that originated before or during sanctions, instead of deleting it from their servers according to the court‚Äôs decision. This was described by Professor Rudolf Dolzer in his article ¬´Weeding Out Fake Journalism¬ª for 10th issue of Forbes Georgia: Offshores Pevtiev was mentioned in the Bahamas offshore leaks in 2016: allegedly, he held three companies in Bahamas through an intermediary. In 2020, an investigation by The Times and Transparency Networks found that Peftiev‚Äôs family owned 12 flats in London, with a total worth around ¬£18 million. This portfolio was purchased through a number of offshore companies. Peftiev's family were never placed under sanctions and the purchases did not breach sanctions.  Science and technology  During his career to date, Peftiev has contributed research and development to a number of new technologies in mechanical engineering and medicine, of which fourteen have been awarded patents under his name. In his research and development work, Peftiev has cooperated with such Belarusian scientists as Vladimir Alexandrovich Katko and Sergey Vladimirovich Pletnev.  Philanthropy  Peftiev supports a variety of social, cultural and religious-heritage projects.  Sport  In 1995, Peftiev founded a youth tennis club in Minsk which he financed and continued to support until 2011. The club helped to recruit highly qualified trainers for talented up-and-coming players, and provided financial assistance and a sports centre to promote national youth tennis. Peftiev was the main sponsor of Victoria Azarenka, Olympic tennis champion and former world No. 1, at the beginning of her career. From 2009 to 2012, Peftiev also headed the Belarus Tennis Federation. Max Mirnyi, former No. 1 player in the ATP Doubles Rankings, expressed his gratitude to Peftiev's work as a CEO of Belarus Tennis Federation.  Religious heritage  Peftiev's contributions to the preservation of Orthodox Christian heritage have been recognised with awards from the Orthodox Church. Since 1998, he has been a member of the Tutorial Board for construction of the Orthodox Church of All Saints and Innocent Victims in Minsk (under the aegis of the Belarusian Orthodox Church). He assisted in the construction of the House of Mercy in Minsk and is a leading sponsor of the Nikolsky Orthodox Church in Tonezh (completed 2015), built to commemorate the site of a Nazi atrocity. During 2012‚Äì2015, Peftiev sponsored the mural paintings in St John the Baptist's Church of the Monastery of the Holy Ascension in Barkalabovo (Belarus) carried out by students and professors of the Monumental Art Department of the Belarusian State Academy of Arts in a team headed by Belarusian artist Vladimir Zinkevich. Vladimir Peftiev is a Chevalier of Orders of the Russian Orthodox Church, a Chevalier of the Order of the Belorussian Orthodox Church, and has also been decorated by the Orthodox Metropolitan of Switzerland.  History and the arts  Peftiev has sponsored and in some cases co-authored a number of art and historical publications, chiefly in the historical series –í –ø–æ–∏—Å–∫–∞—Ö —É—Ç—Ä–∞—á–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ [‚ÄòIn search of the lost‚Äô] by Belorussian historian Vladimir Lihodedov, volumes of which include: * \\"Tadeusz Kosciuszko\\", on the political and military leader who contributed to the establishment of freedom and democracy in Europe and America, a copy of which was presented to the US Library of Congress on 4 July 2011 ; * \\"Belarus through the camera lens of the German soldier\\", on the period during WWI when part of modern Belarus was occupied by German troops ; * \\"Adam Mickiewicz\\", on the poet and patriot of Belarus, Poland and Lithuania ; * \\"Aleksander Nevsky\\", on the Orthodox churches built in European countries in honor of the Russian saint-prince ; * \\"State Bank of the Russian Empire in postcards, late 19th-early 20th centuries\\" ; * \\"Monuments dedicated to the Patriotic War of 1812\\" .

In 2017, a book of maxims by Vladimir Peftiev titled \\"Maxims of a Man of Schemes\\" was published with a foreword by the British philosopher and author A. C. Grayling. The foreword says: > These striking, amusing and sometimes pungent aphorisms are so full of a > certain kind of pragmatic wisdom that I am moved to quote Professor Higgins > on Mr Alfred Doolittle: that the latter was \\"the most original moralist\\" > that the former had encountered for many years. The hard truths of practical > life are apt to wring from people of experience a view of how to navigate > the maze of routes that lies between desire and success; it is not, > invariably, a view for the faint-hearted or those persuaded more by > Aristotle than Gordon Gekko; but it will certainly strike a chord with many > who have ventured that maze, and will certainly provide a preparation ‚Äì and > for some a warning ‚Äì to those planning or wishing to do so. No-one can fail > to profit, therefore ‚Äì in at least one relevant sense of that term ‚Äì from > these maxims, offered by one who has been all the way through that maze and > back. Another book authored by Peftiev was published in 2020 and is titled \\"Quotations From Stories Yet To Be Written\\", with a foreword by a British author Adam Roberts. Peftiev‚Äôs contributions are helping to preserve the memory of Belarusian soldiers and fighters who fell in the Polish and Lithuanian uprisings of the nineteenth century, the Russian-French War of 1812 (the Patriotic War of 1812), and the First and Second World Wars. Thousands of unique artifacts, photographs, documents and letters have been collected so far, and in 2012 an exhibition at the Belarusian State Museum made many visible to the public. Other publications supported by Peftiev in recent years have included books and albums of the work of Belarusian artists Vladimir Zinkevich, Alexander Slucky, Viktor Alshevsky, and celebrated ballet choreographer Valentin Elizarev. In 1999, Peftiev's companies partnered with Elizarev and the French Embassy in Belarus to produce the ballet La Esmeralda (inspired by Victor Hugo's Notre Dame de Paris) at The National Academic Grand Opera and Ballet Theatre of the Republic of Belarus. For several years, Peftiev's companies also sponsored the Yuri Bashmet International Music Festival in Minsk and the Belarusian vocal quintet Clear Voice.

Family Mahood was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, one of the three children of John Alexander and Sarah Mahood. He has a sister, Sandra and a deceased brother, Bobby. Mahood was brought up a Protestant in Ainsworth Avenue, a street that marks the dividing line between two staunchly loyalist areas of the upper Shankill Road and Woodvale Road. However, Ainsworth Avenue had a significant Catholic minority population and linked directly to the mainly Catholic Springfield Road until the early years of the Troubles when the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) erected temporary barricades which were later replaced with peace lines.Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack, UDA ‚Äì Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror, Penguin Ireland, 2004, pp. 29‚Äì30 He is married to Rae, by whom he has three children.

Like a number of his contemporaries, Mahood joined the PUP after serving time in prison for offences related to his membership of the UVF.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 282 Following his release from prison, Mahood returned to the UVF and served as commander in north Belfast in the mid-1990s. Following the Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC) ceasefire of 1994, Mahood was part of the first PUP delegation to hold talks with representatives of the British government.Jim Cusack & Henry McDonald, UVF, Poolbeg, 1997, p. 324 Mahood was on poor terms with David Ervine, who feared the growth of the hawkish Billy Wright and his allies. Ervine threatened to resign from the talks team over the inclusion of Mahood.Ed Moloney, Voices From the Grave: Two Men's War in Ireland, Faber & Faber, 2011, p. 459 Mahood eventually left the PUP after becoming disillusioned with the Belfast Agreement. Dissident loyalist Although based in Belfast, Mahood was close to UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade leader Billy Wright and helped to establish the LVF in 1996 after Wright and his Portadown unit were stood down by the UVF Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) in August of that year.Gun attack escalates loyalist feud According to David Ervine, Mahood had acted as the liaison between the Brigade Staff and Wright; in this capacity he agitated for Wright to be accepted as the UVF's chief strategist just before the split, although Ervine also suggested that Mahood was highly unpopular with the rest of the UVF leadership, apart from Wright, due to his involvement in criminality. Ervine went on to claim that Mahood had provided the gun which was taken from the UVF Shankill Road arms dump that the Mid- Ulster Brigade used to kill Catholic taxi driver Michael McGoldrick in July 1996 at the height of the Drumcree stand-off, an act which led to Wright's expulsion from the UVF as the leadership had not sanctioned the murder. According to Ervine, the gun was procured from the arms dump to incriminate the Belfast UVF while the organisation was on ceasefire at the time.Moloney, Voices From the Grave, pp. 457‚Äì458 These allegations were published in Ed Moloney's book Voices From the Grave: Two Men's War in Ireland in 2010 and infuriated Mahood who publicly denied Ervine's claim that he had provided the weapon used in McGoldrick's killing, maintaining that he was the victim of a UVF \\"smear campaign\\". Following the LVF's establishment, Mahood encouraged Wright to challenge the Brigade Staff and return the entire UVF to a war footing. Mahood also enjoyed a close relationship with UDA leader Jim Spence and encouraged Spence to link up with Wright. However, Spence, who had no desire for a feud with the UVF, kept his distance from the man he nicknamed \\"Billy Wrong\\". Mahood was shot by masked men as he sat in his office in Belfast's Crumlin Road on 27 November 1997. He was hit three times in the neck and jaw and left for dead, although he survived the attack.Shooting victim was shot before Mahood claimed that the UVF was behind the attack and also claimed to know the identity of the shooter.Gun victim 'knows attackers' Mahood also became an ally of dissident former Red Hand Commando hitman Frankie Curry and, in 1999, when Curry was killed, Mahood allegedly used the cover name \\"Red Hand Defenders\\" to issue a death threat against the journalists Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack, accusing them of helping to get Curry killed by reporting on his involvement in a bombing campaign.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 311 Mahood himself was targeted a number of times in assassination attempts by the UVF and as he grew closer to the UDA on the Shankill, which maintained links with the LVF, his name appeared on one of their leaflets, accusing the UVF of being \\"Protestant killers\\" due to the killings of Curry, Andrew Robb and David McIlwaine and attempts on the lives of Mahood, Clifford Peeples and Kenny McClinton.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, pp. 314‚Äì315 In July 2000, Mahood was shot at for the second time as he dropped an employee off at his home in Lavens Drive in North-West Belfast. Shots were fired into his car but Mahood sped away to a nearby Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) station on Tennant Street off the Shankill Road. From there he was taken to hospital to be treated for shrapnel wounds, having escaped being hit by the bullets. On 21 August 2000, Mahood's older brother Bobby was shot and killed by the UVF along with his friend UDA commander Jackie Coulter close to Crumlin Road. Bobby Mahood, a publican and former UVF member, and Coulter were shot as a part of a loyalist feud between the UVF and UDA West Belfast Brigade.David Lister & Hugh Jordan, Mad Dog: The Rise and Fall of Johnny Adair and C Company, Mainstream Press, 2004, pp. 291‚Äì292 Mahood became close to Johnny Adair and was at the UDA leader's house in 2002 when they learned about the suicide of LVF chief Mark \\"Swinger\\" Fulton, who had succeeded Billy Wright as leader following the latter's assassination inside the Maze Prison by Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners in December 1997.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 307 When Adair was removed from the UDA leadership and Jim Spence emerged as a leading figure, the relationship between Mahood and Spence deteriorated severely, to the point that in 2003 The People reported that the two men had brawled in the street in the Lyndhurst area near Glencairn where they were both living at the time.Loyalists in feud fight In 2008, Mahood, along with Kenny McClinton and Alex Kerr, was reported as having refused to co-operate with the inquiry into Billy Wright's killing.Trio won't testify at 'King Rat' inquiry \\"Taxi wars\\" Until rival loyalist paramilitaries forced him out of business in the 2000s, Mahood ran the most successful taxi firm based in North Belfast, operating a fleet of taxis which serviced the greater Belfast area. The business turned an estimated ¬£70,000 a year profit.Alan Erwin, Ex-prisoner‚Äôs fight for ¬£400,000 payout, The Belfast Telegraph. 24 April 2009. His drivers received death threats and 24 taxis were subjected to arson and gun attacks. The so-called \\"taxi wars\\" had seen the offices of Mahood's Call-A-Cab firm attacked by the UVF whilst also seeing the LVF return fire on the Ballysillan- based Sunningdale Taxis. The loss of the business forced him into bankruptcy with his official notice posted on 14 August 2009.Loyalist Mahood declared bankrupt He attempted to gain compensation but initially was turned down by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Shaun Woodward. However, a court subsequently ruled that Mahood could take his claim to court when it emerged that a clandestine offer had been made to him by the Northern Ireland Office.Loyalist cab boss in cash review Mahood sought ¬£400,000 compensation for the loss of his business, arguing that it had been caused by repeated attacks on his depot by loyalists, but the case was dismissed.Loyalist Jackie Mahood loses taxi firm compensation bid References 1954 births Living people Ulster Volunteer Force members Loyalist Volunteer Force members Progressive Unionist Party politicians Ulster loyalists imprisoned on charges of terrorism People from Belfast ","title":"Jackie Mahood"},{"id":"35994806","text":"Amrui (, also Romanized as ‚ÄòAmr≈´‚Äôƒ´; also known as Amruni and Imr≈´ni) is a village in Ayask Rural District, in the Central District of Sarayan County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

Harlan was president when the school's name was changed from Mt. Pleasant Collegiate Institute to Iowa Wesleyan University. He maintained his home here after he resigned as college president to become one of the U.S. Senators from Iowa and then Secretary of the Interior during the administration of Andrew Johnson. Harlan retired to the house in 1876 and lived there until his death in 1899. The house passed to his daughter Mary who had married Robert Todd Lincoln, son of Abraham Lincoln. She donated the house to Iowa Wesleyan in 1907. It has served as the president's house, and administrative building and it housed the art department. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The Harlan‚ÄìLincoln House now serves as a museum that contains memorabilia from both the Harlan and Lincoln families.

Miller and others. Life and Education Dollard was born in Menasha, Wisconsin in 1900. He studied commerce and English at the University of Wisconsin and received his B.A. in 1922. He then earned his Ph.D in sociology at the University of Chicago in 1931. Dollard also studied psychoanalysis at the Berlin Institute from 1931-1932.John Dollard Papers (MS 1958). Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University Library.Biographical Dictionary of Psychology edited by Noel Sheehy, Antony J. Chapman, Wenday A. Conroy (pg. 149-150). He later returned to the states and taught anthropology at Yale University before he became a research associate at the new Institute of Human Relations. With Neal E. Miller, a fellow researcher at the Institute of Human Relations, Dollard also served as a consultant to the Morale Services Division of the U.S. Department of War. He continued to teach at Yale though and later became a professor of psychology in 1952. Dollard retired from Yale in 1969, becoming professor emeritus, until his death in 1980 in New Haven, Connecticut.http://www.flandershealth.us/personality/biographies-of-john- dollard-and-neal-miller.html Career Dollard's personal research was focused on the sociological issues of race relations and social class, as well as exploring biographical analyses, suggesting what should be included in biographical materials to permit sound psychological studies, researching various topics related to sociology and culture, and psychoanalysis. According to his research, much can be predicted without knowing anything about the individual by simply having knowledge of the culture into which the person is born. He realized that sociological variables, such as social class and culture, influence a person's particular learning experiences. Unlike most psychoanalysts at the time, Dollard recognized the importance of considering actual human social conditions rather than just abstract psychological principles constructed in a laboratory setting.http://www.flandershealth.us/personality/biographies-of-john-dollard- and-neal-miller.html These ideas and practices led him to write one of his most influential works, Caste and Class in a Southern Town, the now classic sociological study of race relations in the Deep South. From 1941 to 1945 he also studied fear and morale in modern warfare, which culminated in several reports, including Fear and Courage under Battle Conditions (1943) and \\"Fear in Battle\\" (The Infantry Journal, 1944).http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/tamwag/alba_122/ However, Dollard is likely best known within the psychological community as a member of the distinguished group of young researchers (among whom was Neal E. Miller) at Yale University in the 1930s who, inspired initially by Clark L. Hull, sought to combine learning theory and psychoanalysis. The groups' first major publication was Frustration and Aggression, and has become a classic which is still widely cited in introductory texts. It outlined a view, now referred to as the frustration-aggression hypothesis, which formed the basis for later developments such as Leonard Berkowitz's Aggression: A Social Psychological Analysis (1962) and the animal research on frustration and aggression in the 1960s and 1970s, which caused a controversy between the researchers and animal rights groups. Miller sums up Dollard's contributions to the group as such: \\"If trying to bring together contributions from sociology, anthropology, psychology, and psychotherapy no longer seems so novel, it is because Dollard and other pioneers had the courage and tenacity to break through traditional barriers\\".Biographical Dictionary of Psychology edited by Noel Sheehy, Antony J.

BIGSIM provides these facilities by allowing the simulation of performance on various node topologies, message passing and scheduling strategies. BIGSIM includes an emulator and a trace- based simulator. The emulator executes applications on a small number of nodes and stores the results, so the simulator can use them and simulate activities on a much larger number of nodes. The simulator is a discrete event simulator (based on the POSE system) which is trace driven and uses POSE's Charm++ base. BIGSIM can simulate both the processing components and the message passing system to provide an overall view of system performance characteristics. The emulator stores information of sequential execution blocks (SEBs) for multiple processors in log files, with each SEB recording the messages sent, their sources and destinations, dependencies, timings, etc. The simulator reads the log files and simulates them, and may star additional messages which are then also stored as SEBs. The simulator can thus provide a view of the performance of very large applications, based on the execution traces provided by the emulator on a much smaller number of nodes, before the entire machine is available, or configured.

He is the co-author of the book Engines of Innovation ‚Äì The Entrepreneurial University in the 21st Century, in which he contends that the world‚Äôs biggest problems can be effectively addressed by large research universities through a combination of skillful innovation and execution. He was named Entrepreneur of the Year by the Information Industry Association and Information America, the company he cofounded, has appeared numerous times on the Inc. 500 list of fastest growing companies. Education Goldstein attended public school in Miami Beach, Florida and graduated from Miami Beach Senior High School in 1966. He received his B.A. with Honors from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1970 where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and the Order of the Golden Fleece. He received a M.Ed. from the University of Massachusetts in 1973 and a J.D. with Honors from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1976, where he served on the Editorial Board of the North Carolina Law Review. Goldstein never enrolled in a business course during his undergraduate or graduate career. The first time he attended a formal business class was when he spoke to a marketing class at the UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School about his success as an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurship Buck Goldstein has been involved in entrepreneurship most of his professional life. After four years of working at a corporate law firm, he co-founded Information America, an online information company that was the first to make courthouse information available from remote terminals in lawyer‚Äôs offices. The business began as a two-person start-up and grew to over $40,000,000 in revenues, eventually going public and trading on the NASDAQ. Customers included virtually every major law firm in the United States, most of the Fortune 500 and many large federal agencies including the FBI, the DEA and the CIA. In 1994, Information America was acquired by West Publishing, the largest legal publisher in the world and soon after was acquired by Thomson Corporation, a multi-national information publishing company. He later founded NetWorth Partners, a venture capital fund focusing on information based enterprises with Mellon Ventures as its largest investor and subsequently became a partner in Mellon Ventures, a subsidiary of Mellon Bank. As a partner, Goldstein invested in a number of emerging businesses and served on the Board of Directors of over 15 companies. More recently, Goldstein served as Chairman of MedFusion, a Raleigh-based medical information technology company acquired by Intuit in 2010, and as Board Observer and advisor for iContact, an email marketing company based in the Research Triangle Park acquired by Vocus in 2012. Additionally, Goldstein has served as an advisor to Liquidia, a nano-technology company founded in the UNC chemistry department, and as a Board member of Nourish International, a non- profit organization that engages college students across the United States in on campus social businesses and international poverty reduction projects. Over the years, Goldstein has served on numerous boards in a variety of capacities including Chairman of the Institute of Arts and Humanities Advisory Board at UNC-Chapel Hill, President of the Atlanta Chapter of the American Jewish Committee, and Board Member of the High Museum of Art in Atlanta. Goldstein joined the university faculty at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2004 to help build The Carolina Entrepreneurial Initiative, a multi- year, multimillion-dollar project to make a broad definition of entrepreneurship part of the intellectual culture of the campus and support students and faculty to turn innovative ideas into self-sustaining enterprises. The UNC entrepreneurship curriculum has been named by a variety of national publications as among the nation‚Äôs best. Goldstein recruits alumni and other university supporters with entrepreneurial expertise to serve as mentors for faculty and student projects and to provide off-campus internships for students. As Professor of the Practice at the university, he teaches both small seminars and large lecture courses in entrepreneurship and supports the continuing development of the undergraduate Minor in Entrepreneurship and its internship program. \\"I want to make entrepreneurship a part of the fabric of the university,\\" Goldstein said in an interview, \\"We want to develop both business and social entrepreneurs. We want to give students and faculty members the tools to turn ideas into reality.\\" Goldstein and Chancellor Holden Thorp co-authored Engines of Innovation ‚Äì The Entrepreneurial University in the 21st Century, suggesting that the top 125 U.S. research universities can play a crucial role in revitalizing the American economy. Goldstein and Thorp are also working to transform UNC, a 29,000-student public university, into an engine of innovation.

She was a letter of marque that made one capture. The French captured Tarleton in October 1782 in the Caribbean. They took her back to France in 1783 and she was subsequently stationed at Brest, where she served in the Mediterranean. The British recaptured her at Toulon in 1793 and she then served in the Mediterranean until no later than 1798 when she disappears from the lists. Origins Tarletons origins are uncertain. Though the name was unusual, it was not unique at the time. There were at least two Tarletons in French hands in early 1783, with different commanders. Supposedly the Tarleton of this article had been a vessel the Royal Navy had captured and lost to the French in 1782.Demerliac (1996), p.81, #527. However, there are no readily accessible Royal Navy records of any capture, service, or subsequent loss. There was a mercantile Tarlton [sic], of New York, with Young, owner, that escaped Yorktown shortly before its fall in 1781. The ambiguous report of \\"Jonas Rider, a Black Man\\", raises the possibility that the French captured this vessel, only to lose it to the British.Chadwick (1916), p.141. If the French then recaptured it, it may have been the Tarleton that the Royal Navy reportedly captured and lost in 1782. Tarleton (I) The Archives of the State of Maryland record on 3 January 1783 that two armed vessels, Pole Cat and Tarleton, had arrived from Baltimore and sailed into Chesapeake Bay to drive out the British forces there.State of Maryland online archives, Journal and Correspondence of the Council of Maryland, 1781-1784, vol. 48, p.335. On 25 February there was a memo to Captan de Barrass, of Tarleton.State of Maryland online archives, Journal and Correspondence of the Council of Maryland, 1781-1784, vol. 48, p.368. On 19 March a second memo mentioned Captain de Barrass of the sloop Tarleton.State of Maryland online archives, Journal and Correspondence of the Council of Maryland, 1781-1784, vol. 48, p.386. Lastly, a memo on 19 May discusses the return to Tarleton of her sick that have recovered.State of Maryland online archives, Journal and Correspondence of the Council of Maryland, 1781-1784, vol. 48, p.417. Tarleton (II) In late 1782 Tarleton, Captain Lecamus, was at Saint Domingue when the governor sent her to Boston. On 3 January 1783, the French brig Tarleton, of 14 guns, and under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau le Camus, encountered an 18-gun brig that escaped Tarleton only by its superior sailing. Tarleton forced the enemy brig to abandon a Spanish prize that it had taken. Tarleton suffered one man wounded in the engagement.Kerguelen-Tr√©marec (1806), pp.333-4. The mention does not make clear where this occurred, but a second mention is more specific. On 9 February, Tarleton was leaving Port-au- Prince, having returned there for repairs. As she left to resume her voyage to Boston, she encountered a British frigate and a brig. M. de Camus sailed Tarleton into a cove. There he found two guns that he combined with four of his own to form a shore battery. With this he forced the English vessels to sail off.Kerguelen-Tr√©marec (1806), pp.336. Eventually she did reach Boston.Troude (1867), Vol. 2, p.223. The issue then is, if one Tarleton was in the Chesapeake between January and May 1783, which was the Tarleton that was at Saint-Domingue in January‚ÄìFebruary 1783? The most likely candidate is Tarleton, launched in 1780 at Glasgow. She was of 140 tons (bm), was armed with fourteen 3-pounder guns, and her owner was Crosbie.Lloyd's Register (1781), Seq. ‚Ññ307.Lloyd's Register (1783), Seq. ‚Ññ6. As a privateer under the command of A. Taylor she captured the American vessel Tom Lee, Buchanan, master, on 23 March 1781 after an engagement of two and a half hours during which Tom Lee suffered one man killed; Tarleton had no casualties. Tom Lee had been sailing from Baltimore to Nantes with 140 hogsheads of tobacco valued at ¬£9000.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ1258. Tom Lee was armed with 12 guns and had a crew of 45 men.American War at Sea: Granville Hough's Ship Listing: T. Shortly after this M. Reed became master and her trade became Liverpool-Barbados. She made a voyage to Saint Lucia and return but on 19 October 1782 the French captured her and took her into Cap Fran√ßois.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ1471. Her captor was apparently Aigrette.du Petit Thouars (1937), pp.100-103. The remaining question then is, which of the two Tarletons is the one that the French navy took back to France? French service When Tarleton reached Boston, she arrived too late to meet with the troops of Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil, Lieutenant General of the Naval Armies, or even to meet them at sea. The force of 4000 men under General Rochembeau had left Boston on 20 December, bound for the Gulf.Troude (1867), vol. 2, p.223. On 29 April 1783 enseigne de vaisseau Aristide-Aubert du Petit-Thouars took command of Tarleton, which he described as a brig of fourteen 4-pounder guns. He exchanged with de Camus, who transferred to the 32-gun frigate Amazone. Tarleton and Amazone then escorted a convoy from Saint-Domingue to Brest, France. On his arrival, Petit-Thouars suggested that he be given command of Tarleton for a voyage of exploration. However, the navy paid-off Tarleton at Brest. Later, in 1784, the navy transferred her to the Mediterranean Fleet at Toulon. Between 1784 and 1788, Tarleton was under the command of Capitaine de fregate Comte Laurent-Jean- Fran√ßois Truguet. She carried the French ambassador Choiseul-Gouffier, and his suite, to his post at Constantinople. She then sailed around the Bosphorus, Marmara, and the whole of the Middle East. Truguet mapped the coasts of the Ottoman Empire and took Choiseul-Gouffier on an exploration of what was believed to be the area where Troy had stood. While in command of Tarleton, Truguet wrote a monograph on tactics and another on naval maneuvers; these were translated into Turkish and printed at Constantinople. In 1790 or so, Tarleton was under the command of Sous-lieutenant de vaisseaux F√©raud. He sailed her from Toulon to Milo, Sicily, via Tunis and Malta. Then she escorted French merchant vessels sailing from Smyrna to Cerigo.Fonds, Vol. 1, p.22. Tarleton then reappears at the siege of Toulon, under the command of \\"Maselet\\".Troude (1867), vol. 2, p.300. There Royalist forces turned over to the Anglo-Spanish force the French naval vessels in the port. Royalist Lieutenant de vaisseau Louis-Joseph-Felix-N√∂el Damblard de Lansmatre then commanded her in October as part of a small squadron that patrolled the √éles d'Hy√®res to suppress piracy. When the Anglo-Spanish force had to leave in December, they took with them the best vessels, including Tarleton (or Tarleston), and tried to burn the remainder. British service After the Siege of Bastia had ended in May 1794, Admiral Lord Hood, sought out a French squadron consisting of seven ships of the line and some frigates. Hood sighted them on 10 June and drove them into Gourjean Bay. The Weather prevented a conventional attack and Lieutenant Charles Brisbane of , proposed a fire ship attack. Hood accepted the plan and the British converted Tarleton into a fireship under Brisbane's command. However, on the eve of the attack, the French sortied, forcing Hood to abandon the plan and to retire. Hood nevertheless promoted Brisbane to commander on 1 July and to command of Tarleton. He served in her during the remainder of that year and part of the next in the squadron acting in the Gulf of Genoa, under the immediate orders of Nelson. Brisbane and Tarleton spent some time blockading Gourjean Bay, and then protecting the trade between Bastia and Leghorn.Ralfe (1828), p.86. On the morning of 9 March 1795, Admiral Hotham put to sea heading for Corsica in search of the French fleet. As yet unaware of the fate of , he sent Tarleton ahead to San Fiorenzo to order Berwick to join him off Cap Corse. Tarleton reported back to the fleet that night, giving Hotham news of Berwicks capture, and presumably an updated location of the French fleet, as Hotham changed his course, heading north-west. The following morning on 10 March the British came in sight of the French fleet, now beating northwards back to Toulon against a south-west wind. At the subsequent battle of Genoa (14 March 1795), Tarleton was in the seaboard or weather division under Vice-Admiral Samuel Goodall. After the battle, was towing when she broke free of her tow. Then the accidental firing of a lower deck gun damaged the ship so that she took on water.Gossett (1986), p.7. Illustrious attempted to anchor in Valence Bay (between Spezia and Leghorn) to ride out the bad weather that had descended upon her. Her cables broke, however, and she struck on rocks and had to be abandoned. and Tarleton took off her stores, and all her crew were saved. Shortly thereafter, Brisbane removed to the sloop . Captain Robert Redmill took command of Tarleton in July 1796. Redmill remained in command only a short time before transferring to another vessel. In September Lieutenant William Proby replaced Redmill. By this time Tarleton was in a wretched state, leaky and rotten. In December Admiral Jervis observed that she was \\"in extreme danger\\" of sinking even while undertaking a short voyage between two Mediterranean ports.Pope (1987), p.7. Fate On 21 October 1796 Captain Nelson wrote to Admiral Jervis that he, Nelson, was sending Tarleton to Jervis so that, as Jervis wanted, he could transfer Proby to T√©m√©raire.Nelson (1846), Vol. 7, p.CXXV. Nelson wrote on 29 December that he expected to be able to sell Tarleton and Mignonne.Nelson (1846), Vol. 7, p.CXXVI. However, on 2 December Jervis wrote from Gibraltar to Lord Spencer, First Lord of the Admiralty, that he, Jervis, intended to transfer Proby to , and that Tarleton had been sold.Corbett (1914), vol. 48, p.73. The British ended up burning Mignonne in 1797.

He married Mary Huggeford Hardy (1824‚Äì1911), and they had 12 children, among them geologist Henry Shaler Williams (1847‚Äì1918). He was a Whig member of the New York State Senate (25th D.) from 1852 to 1855, sitting in the 75th, 76th, 77th and 78th New York State Legislatures. Williams was nominated on the Know Nothing ticket for Canal Commissioner at the 1854 New York state election, but two weeks before the election declined to run. The party managers then substituted Hard Democrat Clark Burnham on the ticket but, due to slow communications, Williams still polled almost 60,000 votes. He was a presidential elector in 1856, voting for John C. Fr√©mont and William L. Dayton. He was buried at the Ithaca City Cemetery. State Senator Timothy S.

Her earlier career was in UK social work, specialising in children's services and child protection. She has since held a portfolio of chair roles or directorships, working with vulnerable people, especially children. Among other organisations she is currently a director of Plan International, Barnardo's, and Great Ormond Street Hospital. Her previous roles include: Chair of The Caldecott Foundation, chair of The Guinness Partnership, founding chair of Guinness Care and Support, and Deputy Chair of Yeovil Hospital. The granddaughter of Admiral of the Fleet Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, she is a descendant of Queen Victoria through her daughter Princess Alice, Mountbatten's grandmother. Early life and education Ellingworth was born in London, the fourth of seven children of the 7th Baron Brabourne and the 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma. She is the granddaughter of Admiral of the Fleet the 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, who was an uncle of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and a second cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth II. She has five brothers and one sister. She was baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury on 29 September 1957 at Mersham Parish Church in Mersham, Kent. Her godparents were Prince George of Hanover, Mrs. E. Heywood-Lonsdale, and Mrs. C. H. W. Troughton. Ellingworth earned a BA Hons degree from the University of Kent, a CQSW qualification from Goldsmiths College, London, and a Certificate in Mandarin Language from the Beijing Language Institute.  Career After a first career as a social worker, Ellingworth has worked at a senior level in health services, children's services, adult social care and affordable housing. She currently holds several non-executive directorships, including Chair of The Guinness Partnership, a provider of affordable housing. Personal life In early 1974, Ellingworth's grandfather Lord Mountbatten began corresponding with his godson and great-nephew (and her second cousin), Charles, Prince of Wales, offering advice on dating and the selection of a future consort: \\"In a case like yours, the man should sow his wild oats and have as many affairs as he can before settling down, but for a wife he should choose a suitable, attractive, and sweet-charactered girl before she has met anyone else she might fall for... It is disturbing for women to have experiences if they have to remain on a pedestal after marriage.\\" Mountbatten had a unique qualification for tendering marital advice to the heir to the throne, having arranged the first documented meeting of Prince Charles' parents at Dartmouth Royal Naval College on 22 July 1939. He recommended that the 25-year-old prince get done with his bachelor's experimentation, and mentioned his granddaughter as a prospective consort.Dimbleby, Jonathan. \\"The Prince of Wales: A Biography\\". William Morrow & Co. New York, 1994. pp. 204‚Äì06, 263‚Äì65, 299‚Äì300. . According to his biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby (for whom Prince Charles arranged access to unpublished royal diaries and family correspondence), \\"[I]n 1974, following his correspondence with Mountbatten on the subject, the Prince had tentatively raised the question of marriage to Amanda with her mother (and his godmother) Patricia Brabourne. She was sympathetic, but counselled against raising the issue with her daughter, who had yet to celebrate her seventeenth birthday.\\" This did not daunt Mountbatten, who ‚Äì four years later ‚Äì obtained an invitation for himself and Lady Amanda to accompany Prince Charles on his planned 1980 tour of India. However, both fathers objected; Prince Philip complaining that the Prince of Wales would be eclipsed by his famous uncle (who had served as the last British Viceroy and first Governor-General of India), while Lord Brabourne warned that a joint visit would draw media attention to the cousins before they could decide on becoming a couple, thereby potentially dashing the very prospect for which Lord Mountbatten hoped. James Stanhope, 7th and last Earl Stanhope, had apparently been impressed by the young Prince Charles, and hoped that he would one day reside at Chevening in Kent, the stately home which served as the traditional family seat of the Earls Stanhope. In 1974, while corresponding with Lady Amanda's mother and grandfather about a possible future with her, the Prince had accepted the prospect of living on the estate. Lady Amanda's paternal great-aunt had been Lady Eileen Browne, daughter of the 6th Marquess of Sligo, whose childless marriage to the last Earl Stanhope (who had no other near family relations), prompted him to bequeath Chevening to the British nation, placing it at the disposal of the Royal Family or of a government minister. If Lady Amanda were to become Princess of Wales, the Prince's acceptance of Chevening would make some familial sense. But this was not to be, although the Prince did visit the house several times. In a note of 24 April 1978 to his private secretary, Sir David Checketts, Prince Charles observed, \\"I know there are advantages ‚Äì particularly financial ones ‚Äì in the Chevening set-up, but I regret to say I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that they are the only advantages.\\" Before Prince Charles was to depart alone for India, the Earl Mountbatten of Burma was assassinated by the IRA in August 1979. When Prince Charles returned, he proposed to Lady Amanda. However, in addition to her maternal grandfather, she had lost her paternal grandmother and youngest brother Nicholas in the attack and now recoiled from the prospect of becoming a core member of the Royal Family. In June 1980 Prince Charles wrote to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to renounce future residency at Chevening (since then, Chevening has been used by the British government to house successive foreign secretaries and Cabinet members). Weeks later, he purchased Highgrove House in Gloucestershire. By then, according to Dimbleby, Lady Amanda had declined the Prince's proposal of marriage, and he would soon begin courtship of Lady Diana Spencer. Lady Amanda married novelist and property entrepreneur Charles Vincent Ellingworth on 31 October 1987; he is the eldest child of six of a Leicestershire Catholic family, who attended Ampleforth College and later read history at Oxford University. They have three sons, Luke (27 January 1991, London), Joseph (2 December 1992, Salisbury) and Louis (25 October 1995, Salisbury).Willis, Daniel A., The Descendants of King George I of Great Britain, Clearfield, 2002, p. 719.

The \\"Hisso\\" powered almost every high-performance allied fighter plane of the First World War - including all French Spads. Certain variants (including one that equipped the Spad VII) allowed weapons as large and powerful as 37mm cannon to be fired through their propeller hubs, thus side-stepping any need to synchronize their firing with the propeller's movement. The engine itself consisted of an ultra-lightweight aluminum monobloque with steel-sleeved cylinders, enabling it the strongest power-to-weight ratio of any engine built during the First World War. *Laister-Kauffman TG-4A - A tandem 2-seat sailplane produced in the U.S. during World War II for training cargo glider pilots; it was a conventional sailplane design with a steel tube fuselage and wooden wings and tail, skinned all over in fabric.Laister-Kauffman TG-4A Retrieved: 31 May 2012 *Grunau Baby II - (not on display) An advanced glider widely used in the 1930s to train pilots for what was to become the Luftwaffe (German military aviation being prohibited at that point by the Treaty of Versailles).

Employed in the anti-tank role for the first time by Erwin Rommel during his thrust across France in May of '40, it became a primary means through which he was able to hold numerically-superior allied tank forces in-check through years of fighting in North Africa. Able to throw a shell to a ceiling in excess of 30,000 feet, it also accounted for the bulk of accurate flak encountered by allied bomber forces during their raids into Germany in '43 and '44. *AEC Routemaster 1962 British double-decker busWarbirds 2012, p. 37\\"Prop Noise\\", Summer 2009, Vol. 2 No. 3, pg. 6 *Messerschmitt KR200 three-wheel microcar *OQ-19D Target Drone *Enigma Machine- The museum has an Enigma Machine that would have been used by the Germans for communication.

Mansoor is seen as one of the forerunners of the djent movement and is often erroneously attributed with the invention of the word itself (he attributes its invention to Meshuggah guitarist Fredrik Thordendal). In May 2013, Mansoor announced that he would be working on his first solo album, which would be written, performed and produced entirely by himself, with the assistance of some guest performers. A projected release has not been decided upon yet by him. He is the son of Ali Mansoor, a banker associated with World Bank who served a term as minister of Finance in Mauritius. Mansoor is Mauritian by descent but was born and raised in the US. He is also Jewish through his motherhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmyfllqrPUY and can speak French. Mansoor and Steve Vai were selected to contribute the Halo 2 Anniversary Original Soundtrack. Mansoor was also selected to contribute to the soundtrack of Destiny: Rise of Iron. Production Mansoor's career as a producer started when he produced and co-wrote the Animals as Leaders' debut self- titled album and since then he has produced bands such as Veil of Maya, Born of Osiris, Being and Stray from the Path. He formed a production company called Top Secret Audio in 2013 with Adam \\"Nolly\\" Getgood, his former Periphery bandmate. 3DOT Recordings Mansoor is a partner in 3DOT Recordings, along with Periphery bandmates Spencer Sotelo, Jake Bowen, Mark Holcomb and Matt Halpern.

The project is co-funded by the ARTEMIS Programme related to the topic: 'SP5 Computing Environments for Embedded Systems'.  Middleware functionalities  The merging of the real- time systems and the service-oriented architectures enables more flexible a dynamic distributed systems with real time features. So a number of functionalities have been identified to create a SoA based middleware for deterministic reconfiguration of service-based applications: * Service registration/deregistration: Stores in the system the functionalities and the description of the different services. * Service discovery: Enables external actor to discover the services currently stored in the system. * Service composition: Creates the service-based application on run-time. * Service orchestration: Manages the invocation of the different services. * Service based admission test: This functionality checks if there are enough resources for the services execution in the distributed system. * Resource reservation: This functionality acquires the necessary resources in the host machine and the network. * System monitoring: This functionality measures if the resources required for the execution of services are not being exhausted. * System reconfiguration: This functionality changes the services currently running on the system by other services providing same functionality.  Middleware architecture  The architecture of the iLAND middleware consists in two layers. The high level one is the Core Functionality Layer. It is oriented to the management of the real time service model. The low layer creates bridges to the system resources and the network resources in order to provide the real time operation.

Development Wilson Doyle graduated Harvard in 1925, and his brother Harvey from Yale the same year. They moved to Detroit looking for employment in aviation and backing for a new aircraft design. Their first job was working as draftsmen on the ZMC-2 airship, then construction on the Hess H-1 Bluebird line. Ford Trimotor engineer Jan Pavlecka introduced the brothers to William Burke of the Vulcan Last Company, which produced golf clubs among other items. They founded the Vulcan Aircraft Corporation. The name of their first aircraft was chosen to capitalize on the popularity of the de Havilland Tiger Moth. Design The American Moth is a strut-braced, high-wing monoplane with conventional landing gear and a tandem open cockpit, requiring the front passenger to enter through the removable backrest between cockpits. The fuselage is made of welded steel tubing with fabric covering. The tapered wings use spruce spars with aluminum wing ribs. The ailerons and elevators used aluminum push-pull tubes rather than cables for control deflection. The standard factory paint scheme was scarlet, red and ivory. A selection of engines could be fitted; 60 or 90 hp Le Blond, 60 or 80 hp Anzani, or a 70 hp Ryan-Siemens.Flight p774 Operational history Pathe News filmed ground runs of the American Moth. The first test flight was flown by Pat Love. Vulcan promoted its aircraft by touring from city to city golf courses having promoter Benny Martinez parachute with a set of Vulcan golf clubs. Martinez eventually broke his leg and Vulcan's chief pilot Pat Love died a year later in a crash. The 3,300 mile tour concluded in March 1928. Later that year, Burke died of a heart attack and the assets of the company were sold to Davis Aircraft in Richmond, Indiana. Dwight Huntington modified the drawings to produce the Davis V-3, Davis D-1, and a custom racer totaling about 60 aircraft built, before the company stopped production in 1929 after a doping-process fueled fire.

He was a politician, co-founder and vice-president of the Bank of Montreal, and Colonel of the Royal Montreal Cavalry. He founded the Montreal Hunt in 1826 and was a member of the Beaver Club. He is the ancestor of the Forsyth-Grants of Ecclesgreig Castle. Early years Born at Huntly, Aberdeenshire, he was the fifth son of William Forsyth (b.1721) 4th Laird of Tailzerton, and his wife Jean, daughter of George Phynn, Lord of the Corse of Monelly.Memorial of the family of Forsyth de Fronsac He was a first cousin of the politician Edward Ellice through the influential Phynn family. Forsyth came to New York just before the American Revolution, but as a loyalist he removed to Quebec. He joined his brother, Thomas, at Montreal, Quebec. They worked in the Montreal offices of their uncle's merchant's firm Phynn, Ellice & Co., of London. When Ellice died in 1790, the Forsyth brothers and their first cousin John Richardson became partners of what was from then known as Forsyth, Richardson & Co., of Montreal. Much of their business was centred on the fur trade and they became partners in the North West Company for a period. John Forsyth focused on the smooth day-to-day running of the company, leaving his forceful cousin to drive it forward. Bank of Montreal Forsyth played a supporting role in Richardson's abortive effort to establish the Canada Banking Company in 1792. He was among the founders, with Richardson, of the Bank of Montreal in 1817, and their firm, as well as Forsyth and Richardson individually, subscribed the maximum 20 shares each. Forsyth served as a director of the bank from 1817 to 1820 and as vice-president in 1825‚Äì26. Militia, church and politics Forsyth was commissioned an ensign in the Montreal Battalion of British Militia in 1797, and he reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel of the Royal Montreal Cavalry by 1828. He served as a captain with the Montreal Incorporated Volunteers during the War of 1812 and was granted land for his services. He was made a justice of the peace in 1821 and was a life governor of the Montreal General Hospital. Diligent in support of Richardson during the founding of the Montreal Committee of Trade in 1822, he was elected its first chairman but declined the honour and was replaced by Thomas Blackwood. He was largely inactive in the affairs of his church, the Scotch Presbyterian Church, later known as St Gabriel Street Church. In 1827, Forsyth was appointed to the Legislative Council of Lower Canada on Lord Dalhousie‚Äôs recommendation. However, unlike many prominent businessmen, and most notably his partner, Forsyth was not offered, or did not he accept any great number of government appointments. Personal life From the 1790s at least, Forsyth was part of the social circuit on which the upper echelon of the Montreal business community prided itself. Jacob Mountain dined in a large company at Forsyth‚Äôs home in 1794: \\"The house itself is elegant, and the dinner splendid... People here are fond of good living and take care to want no luxury\\".Jacob Mountain, \\"From Quebec to Niagara in 1794; a diary of Bishop Jacob Mountain,\\" ed. A. R. Kelly Forsyth's political and social views and activities were representative of those of the most prominent business figures in Montreal. In the 1790s he had welcomed into his home refugees from the French Revolution. Forsyth founded the Montreal Hunt in 1826 and was a member of the Beaver Club at Montreal. Family and final years John Forsyth's home on Notre Dame Street, Montreal Ecclesgreig Castle, inherited by John Forsyth's eldest son through the Grants In 1798, at St Andrew's Church, Quebec, Forsyth married Margaret Grant (1777-1818), daughter of Charles Grant (d.1784), a prominent Quebec merchant from an influential Scots-Quebecer family trading between London and Canada. Charles was the third son of the Laird of Kincorth and a grandson of Grant of Glenbeg, whose portrait hung at Castle Grant.Grants of Quebec Mrs Forsyth's mother, Jane Holmes (1750-1805), afterwards married The Hon. John Blackwood. The Forsyths were the parents of two sons and a daughter, all of whom married within Forsyth's business circle: *William Forsyth-Grant (1804-1863) J.P., D.L., succeeded his uncle, Frederick Grant, to Ecclesgreig Castle, taking the additional name of 'Grant'. He married his first cousin, Euretta Forsyth, daughter of Joseph Forsyth, of Kingston, Upper Canada; sister of James Bell Forsyth. Their eldest son was Aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria. Their third son married a daughter of The Hon. John Beverley Robinson. *John Blackwood Forsyth (1805-1891), married a daughter of Samuel Gerrard. *Jane Prescott Forsyth (1807-1869), married Captain George Gregory of the 19th Light Dragoons. He was the son of John Gregory, of Montreal, a former colleague of Jane's father in the North West Company and a fellow member of the Beaver Club. A nephew, James Bell Forsyth, represented Forsyth, Richardson at Quebec City, in association with William Walker from 1821. Richardson died in May 1831, and for a time Forsyth carried on. In August he informed his first cousin Edward Ellice that he was \\"on the best of terms\\" with Governor Lord Aylmer and \\"an intimate and old friend\\" of Aylmer's civil secretary, John Baskerville Glegg, and he offered to use these advantages to promote the development of Ellice's seigneury of Villechauve, more commonly known as Beauharnois, the management of which Forsyth, Richardson had long supervised. Forsyth spent his last years in Britain, where he died in 1837. Forsyth, Richardson & Co., survived until 1847 when it and Forsyth, Walker and Company were dissolved.

Written by Ernesto Gastaldi and Mahnah√©n Velasco, the film stars Pier Paolo Capponi, Simon Andreu and Dagmar Lassander. The film, featuring a score written by Ennio Morricone, has received mixed to positive reviews from critics. When bored housewife Minou (Lassander) is convinced by a stranger that her husband is a killer, she finds herself being manipulated by the stranger, who seduces her and uses photographs of the affair to blackmail her. Plot Minou is a wealthy housewife, who yearns for the attention of her husband Peter. However, Peter is frequently busy at work and is rarely at home. Minou is out one night when she is attacked by a strange man, who cuts open her clothes and warns her that her husband is a killer. Minou ignores what she has been told until she finds that a man indebted to Peter has been found dead. She receives a telephone call from her attacker, who plays a tape recording of Peter discussing the murders. The attacker tells Minou that he will go public with this evidence if she does not come to his house; when she is there he further blackmails her into sleeping with him. However, he has used a hidden camera to photograph the tryst, and continues to use this new leverage to continue blackmailing her. Dominique, a friend of Minou, initially seems to be trustworthy, but Minou finds pornographic photographs of her blackmailer in Dominique's possession. When Minou leads the police to her blackmailer's home, it has been emptied of all belongings; while Dominique refuses to corroborate that the man even existed. Doubt begins to amass as to Minou's sanity, leading to her suffering a nervous breakdown and taking an overdose of tranquilizers. Cast * Dagmar Lassander - Minou * Pier Paolo Capponi - Peter * Simon Andreu - The Blackmailer * Osvaldo Genazzani - Frank, the Commissioner * Salvador Huguet - George * Susan Scott as Dominique Production Le foto proibite di una signora per bene marks the first collaboration between director Luciano Ercoli and screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi, who would later work together on 1971's La morte cammina con i tacchi alti and 1972's La morte accarezza a mezzanotte. The film has been cited as \\"defin[ing] Ercoli's style\\", featuring the recurring theme of \\"the nightmare of being threatened by one's own sexual partner\\". Composer Ennio Morricone's bossa nova-influenced score has been compared to the works of Brazilian bossa nova artist Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim. Several of Morricone's compositions for the film feature Edda Dell'Orso on vocals; Morricone and Dell'Orso frequently worked together on his film scores. Bruno Nicolai conducted the score for the film. Release Le foto proibite di una signora per bene was released in Italy on November 19, 1970. The film has also been released under the title Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion. An English-language DVD release under the title The Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion was published by Blue Underground on March 28, 2006.  Reception  The \\"explicit connection between female sexuality and violence\\" in Le foto proibite di una signora per bene has been cited as a precursor to \\"sexually-themed\\" giallo films such as La ragazza dal pigiama giallo and Tenebrae. AllMovie's Robert Firsching has also described the \\"vibrant Ennio Morricone score and slick photography by Alejandro Ulloa\\" as highlights of the film. Writing for DVD Talk, Ian Jane rated the film three-and-a-half stars out of five, praising Morricone's score and complimenting the film's plot and suspense. Jane noted that while the film is \\"low on nudity and murderous mayhem, it does have some interesting suspense and enough underlying themes of kinky depravity to keep things interesting despite the slow pace at which it plays out\\". Fellow DVD Talk reviewer Glenn Erickson also rated the film three- and-a-half stars out of five, writing that it \\"looks and sounds great, with attractive settings and cinematography. But its unconvincing sexual blackmail story isn't engaging, and we keep watching mainly to find out if there are going to be any surprise\\". Erickson felt that more attention had been paid to \\"the attractive camerawork and the smartly designed interior sets\\" than to the script or acting. Dread Central's Jon Condit rated the film one out of five, deriding its \\"molasses in January, threadbare story\\". However, Condit felt the film was an example of the \\"warmth and often gorgeously artistic composition of Italian cinema\\", although he found the characters \\"flat\\" and the film's d√©nouement disappointing.

The kingdom of Oriel encompassed the land from County Donegal to County Louth. Oriel is almost synonymous with Ulster. Colla-da-Chrioch, a southern conqueror of Ulster, was one of the three Collas. The identity of the folks who lived in Oriel is shrouded in mystery and disagreement among historians. Historians who give credence to their existence, generally place Colla-da-Chrioch's conquest of Ulster in 331 AD. Some disagree placing it anywhere in the succeeding 100 years. Some scholars feel that the three Collas never existed. The McCanns (Old Gaelic, Mac Cana) are said to have descended from Breasail, a grandson of Colla-da-Chrioch. There is almost unanimity in the opinion that Eochaidh is derived from the Gaelic word for horse, or each. Some doubt has been expressed, however, based on the assumption that the only proper Gaelic form of the word for horse is ech: \\"Keogh, for instance, is widely known. It is Mac Eochadha, that is 'Eochaidh's Son.' Eochaidh is an extremely widely used name in Old Irish texts, it is the name of several gods and mythical quasi-divine kings. But what does Eochaid (OI spelling) mean? Some take it as equivalent to Echaid (from 'ech', 'horse') therefore 'Horseman'. Not improbable because of place of horse in ancient Celtic religion. But why -o- in Eochaid? Many words eo--'salmon,' 'point', 'pin,' 'yew' and others, but then whence -ch- in Eochaid? So, whereas there's no doubt that Keogh is Mac Eochadha (OI Macc Eochada), there's unresolved doubt about Eochaid[h].\\" Gaelic Language Bulletin Board of July 31, 1989. Eochaidh is an ancient Irish name. The index to Keating's History of Ireland shows several pages of Eochaidhs. The Index Nominum to O'Donovan's version of the Annals of the Four Masters contains two pages of Eochaidhs. Mac Eocada is usually translated as \\"horseman,\\" but sometimes \\"possession of horses.\\" John O'Hart says that Eachach means \\"having many horses.\\" David F. Dale, always an independent and innovative scholar, says Eochaid \\"derives probably from a phrase which means a 'descendant of the horse' ie Eoch-aidh.\\" The Ancient Origins of the Scots, Part I, 5.6 Scotic Settlement and the Horse \\"Goddess\\", by David Dale. Eochaid mac Ardgar is listed as one of the Kings of Ulidia. Francis John Byrne, in his book Irish Kings and High-Kings (B. T. Batsford London 1973), at page 127, uses the name \\"Eochaid mac Ardgail king of Ulaid,\\" and says: \\"In the eleventh century family surnames became common among the royal septs in Ireland. These probably originated in a desire to distinguish the rigdamnai [persons eligible to be king] from remoter relatives. Thus in Ulster not merely the sons and grandsons of Eochaid mac Ardgail, but also his later descendants took the name Mac Eochada or Ua hEochada (MacCaughey, Haughey, Hoey).\\" The Mac Eochadhas may also have become McGoughs/McGeoughs.

He developed a new syncretistic Jesus-Yogi model, identifying himself as a Hindu disciple of Jesus Christ‚Äîalthough, Jesus never knew of Yoga, Parekh credited him with being a Yogi by birth. He authored several books, especially A Hindu's Portrait of Christ that constructed a portrait of Christ from a Hindu point of view. Biography=Early life Parekh was born in 1885 at Rajkot of western Gujarat, India, in a family already following Jainism and Vaishnavism, specifically followed by his father. It is said that his illness drew him closer to God in 1903; consequently, he read the entire Bible and a book about Swami Narayana in Gujarati language. Prior to that, at the age of fifteen, he seems to have already read The Use of Life written by John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury, and also The Imitation of Christ influencing him in moral and spiritual attraction at a younger age. After entering the University in Bombay, he was influenced and introduced to Christ through Christ-centric writings of Keshub Chunder Sen, a renowned leader of Brahmo Samaj; later, he served at Church of New Dispensation, founded by Keshub Chunder Sen, for some years. He was baptized to an Anglican church in Bombay on 6 February 1918, and thereby embraced Christianity. He considered himself as \\"Christian Hindu\\", having interpreted Hindu as a name[term] derived from river Indus in both national and cultural context, rather than religious context. Hindu-Christian baptism He was baptised to Anglican Church, as he believed that he had no right to preach Christ without openly professing to be a disciple of Christ‚Äîhe took baptism considering it as \\"a purely spiritual sacramental, signifying the dedication of the new disciple of Christ.\\" He felt that new disciple or convert of Christ ought to remain within his community and considered baptism in India as \\"joining community which stands as a distinct social and political body with its own airs and aspirations which are very often antithetical and far from Christian\\"; hence, he lived as a Hindu-Christian, consciously Christian, but in Hindu surroundings like Brahmabandhab Upadhyay, Narayan Vaman Tilak, and Pandita Ramabai‚Äîall these were said to be Hindus by birth, but claimed to remain Christians. He denounced Westernized church, as he felt it had become more communal body that was more political and social, rather than spiritual;furthermore, he felt culturally Church was \\"anti-national,\\" and lost its identity as Christian. Hindu Church of Christ Having studied Bible, he interpreted the victory of Jesus in accepting Cross in a non-violent way; he considered the Christian church as the invention of Europeans and denounced the Christian church to had become a civil community, instead of a spiritual fellowship. According to him: Having disillusioned by the westernized and materialistic attitude of the Church, he severed his ties with missions and churches, but remained committed to Jesus Christ portraying himself as \\"Hindu disciple of Christ.\\" As he was not comfortable and against the traditional concept of the Church as a separate religious community, he more or less kept loose association with Anglican church; instead, he advocated the House Church as a fellowship within the framework of Hindu cultural, and social categories. He founded the Hindu Church of Christ free from the Western concept of Church;furthermore, he named his home in Rajkot as Oriental Christ House. Gandhi Vs Parekh Parek who knew and met Gandhi, co-authored Mahatma Gandhi An Essay in Appreciation with R.M. Gray, like Gandhi mulled over the concept of Swadharmagraha, later named it as Hindu Swadharmagraha, insisting on the religion of one's birth; however, Parekh parted Gandhi preferring to create an eclectic religion‚Äîcomposed of various[best] doctrines and beliefs. Accordingly, Parekh conceptualised Hindu Swadharmagraha with more space to Christ and prophets of foreign religions, as God's own messengers. Like Gandhi, he affirmed full spiritual fellowship was possible without breaking Caste-system; furthermore, he defended and advocated the practice of caste system in the Indian churches. Gandhi, being a non-Christian acknowledged the moral excellence of Jesus Christ and the relevance of his teachings, with or without a personal commitment to him‚ÄîGandhi didn't convert to Christianity. Parekh, a convert from non-Christian religion to Christianity, personally committed to Christ with conversion by retaining his former religious identity‚Äîmultiple religious belonging. Gandhi directed his apologetic against the claims that Christianity is a superior religion, while Parekh tried to fuse together Christianity and all other theistic religions retaining Hindu identity. Gandhi preferred ethical model of Jesus and was more interested in his teachings rather than historical Jesus, while Parekh formulated his own ascetical Jesus-Yogi model. Parekh didn't use religion for political reasons, while Gandhi blended religion into politics‚Äîboth Gandhi and Parekh, however, supported Harijan [politics] like eating with them and worshipping with them, with no regard to education in any of their doctrines. Jesus yogi model Parekh believed that Jesus had achieved the highest communion with God, and asserted that Jesus' power to do miracles can be done by every human being through the practice of yoga. In his A Hindu's Portrait of Jesus Christ, he considered the risen Christ as fully human than the historical Jesus. He credited Jesus with being a yogi by birth, although nowhere it is mentioned that Jesus knew nor followed yoga technique. A Hindu's Portrait of Christ He published A Hindu's Portrait of Jesus Christ in 1953 at Rajkot and proclaimed as \\"My most humble tribute to Jesus Christ, whose 'Hindu disciple' i have been for the last forty years.\\" This book is by and large considered as a profound study of Jesus Christ by any Hindu in a systematic way in dealing with Jesus' life and meaning. His portrait of Jesus is largely drawn from Synoptic Gospels, following the Markan Chronology of events. =Salient points= * Regarding the Virgin birth of Christ, he says \\"The Hindus have treated it as a pious myth.\\" * Jesus as a great preacher or prophet, certainly beyond Mahavira and Buddha, as he turned instinctively to the poor and the despised, the outcaste and the sinner. * Denounces Fourth Gospel (aka Gospel of John) denying Jesus raising of Lazarus, however, he had no doubt that Jesus worked miracles. According to him, the body of Jesus was not raised, but remained where it was; however, the Resurrection was only in appearance like that of Swami Narayana. * Regarding the death of Christ, he observes \\"There is no doubt, however, that we are here face to face with the greatest tragedy enacted on the earth.\\" * Jesus is more than an Avatara, but a bit less than God.

It was designed and built by Rocketdyne, originally for the NASA Bantam System Technology program (1997). In 2003, it was designated by Lockheed for their pad abort demonstration (PAD) vehicle. NASA tested the RS-88 in a series of 14 hot-fire tests, resulting in 55 seconds of successful engine operation in November and December 2003. The RS-88 engine proved to be capable of of thrust at sea level. A hypergolic derivative of the RS-88 has been selected for the CST-100 launch escape system. This version is capable of 39,700lbf (176.6kN) of thrust and four are used in Starliner's abort system.  Bantam Launch System  The Bantam System Technology Project, which is part of the Low Cost Technologies effort, teams NASA and its business partners to research and demonstrate technologies for a new low-cost launch system. A technology demonstration flight was targeted for late 1999. The RS-88 engine was designed by Rocketdyne under NASA's Bantam program which was the propulsion element of the low-cost technologies of the larger Advanced Space Transportation Program.  Pad abort demonstration  The RS-88 engine was modified and tested in 2003 for application on the Lockheed-Martin pad abort demonstration (PAD) vehicle. Critical design review of the PAD propulsion module occurred in mid-2004, but the planned use of the vehicle in CEV development was evidently abandoned. Lockheed Martin's PAD vehicle was originally scheduled for launch in late 2005 and would have carried four RS-88 engines.  Rocketplane  In January 2006 it was announced that NASA was loaning the RS-88 rocket engine to Rocketplane, of Oklahoma City, as part of an innovative industry partnership program. NASA's Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the company signed a Space Act Agreement for use of an RS-88 engine in tests of its Rocketplane XP vehicle for three years. The company was to provide NASA with design, test and operational information from the development. The Rocketplane XP was a four-seat, modified Lear executive jet. It would have incorporated a rocket engine for acceleration to achieve a planned peak altitude of almost 300,000 feet. \\"With NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the support of local, state and federal governments, we hope to develop a safe, affordable and reusable spaceplane by integrating established technologies, such as the RS-88 engine,\\" said Bob Seto, Rocketplane's vice president of engineering systems and analysis. According to Seto, the craft completed a preliminary design review in March 2005, and it was in the detail design phase. Rocketplane filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and liquidation in 2010.

History and profile Elaph was launched by Elaph Publishing in London in 2001. The reason for choosing London as the center of the website was to be free from the censorship rules of Saudi Arabia and also, offer liberal viewpoints, particularly in opposition to religious radicalism. The goal of Elaph is stated as to offer a mix of print, audio and visual material to its readers. The owner of the news portal is Saudi businessman, journalist and author Othman Al Omeir who is the former editor of the London-based weekly The Majalla and Arabic language daily Al Sharq Al Awsat. After the ban of Elaph in Saudi Arabia in May 2006, it was registered in the United Kingdom. Staff and management The founder and editor-in-chief of Elaph is Othman Al Omeir. Emile Isaac is the managing director and Samar Abdul Malak is the deputy editor-in-chief ofElaph. The news portal has journalists in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Yemen, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. , the portal employs 90 journalists worldwide. Elaph is managed by Integrated Intelligent Solutions (IN2SOL), a Middle East provider of IT services. In June 2014 Elaph reported that it would use unmanned aerial drones to cover and delivers news. Content The Elaph newsportal offers the readers instant news from all around the world, making it a strong competitor to Arab and international news agencies. Additionally, it involves pages on politics, business, culture, health, sports, music, cinema, fashion, features, reports, newspapers, technology, writers, opinions, and special news. Elaph.com also provides video news and tries to provide an interactive platform for its readers. For instance, in January 2009, its readers were asked to send farewell letters to then US President George W. Bush. In September 2011, Elaph reported that the Saudi Ambassador to Cairo, Ahmad Abdelaziz Kattan, survived an attempted assassination by poison, allegedly organized by Iran. The e-newspaper further claimed that since the Saudi diplomats, including Adel Al Jubair are all close to Prince Bandar who is known to be a strong opponent of Iranian influence in the Middle East, they are likely to experience such events The e-newspaper also reported a comment of a Salafist Sheikh in Egypt, Sheik Abu Ishaq al Heweny in December 2011 who said that \\"a woman‚Äôs face is like a vagina so that it should be covered with a veil\\". Traffic and influence In 2003, it was reported that Elaph gained a wide audience among liberal and democratic writers. Elaph was much more popular than on-line versions of the leading printed newspapers such as Al Hayat in 2004. The newsportal became the most popular internet site, ahead even the website of Al Jazeera, in Saudi Arabia in 2005. Then, it began to be a popular site in other countries as seen in the following figures of 2009: Egypt (11.4%), Saudi Arabia (8.3%), the United States (8.0%), Iraq (6.8%), the United Arab Emirates (6.4%), Libya (5.0%), Kuwait (4.9%), Algeria (4.8%), Lebanon (4.6%) and Qatar (4.0%). The other countries where Elaph is read are Germany, Sweden, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria, France, Finland and Switzerland. On 5 November 2008, the day following the US Presidential elections, Elaph reached an all-time record high of 18 million hits. As a result of its popularity and international readership, Elaph.com became one of the leading news portals in the Arab world. The website was officially audited by the Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC). Its traffic was certified in May 2010 which produced ABC's certificate of 1,179,801 users and 8,565,601 page impressions. Furthermore, based on August 2010 data, the website had 1.3 million global users per month. Elaph was the tenth most visited website in the Arab world in 2012. Bans Elaph was blocked in Saudi Arabia in May 2006. The block for which no official reason had been stated was lifted in 2009. However, after publishing the cables released by WikiLeaks in an article with the title of \\"Gulf after WikiLeaks storm, Riyadh Speaks while all are silent\\", the site was again blocked in Saudi Arabia on 6 December 2010. It is clear that the site, along with the other news portal Al Quds Al Arabi, has been continuously blocked and unblocked in Saudi Arabia. It was also blocked in Yemen in 2004 for a period of time based on the claim that it posted \\"sexual material\\". However, it was argued by Yemen Observer that the real reason for the block was reports of Elaph containing personal criticism of then Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh and his elder son Ahmed. Libya and Syria also blocked Elaph before 2006. Expansion It was announced in May 2011 that the website will be expanded by launching more comprehensive multi-media services, called Elaph Multi-Media [EMM], in 2012. The CEO of EMM is reported to be current managing director of Elaph, Nicholas Claxton. Elaph also partnered with Ultra Knowledge as its technology partner and innovator of the Newswall in May 2012.

Biography W≈Çodzimierz Juszczak parents were deported from the village near Gorlitz Bednarek in the Lemko region as a result of the Operation Vistula in 1942 to forced labor in Germany. On the way back from exile, the family learned that on April 11, 1945 180 people were killed there, of Ukrainian nationality, together with the pastor, Fr. Bi≈Çykiem. In this situation, for a time he stopped in the village of Rosochata near Legnica, where in 1947, met with displaced persons from the Lemko. His parents met themselves in 1956 and entered into a marriage. Childhood and youth The first son Roman, received the sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation in the Greek-Catholic parish in Legnica, where he served as the pastoral care of Fr. Vladimir Hajdukiewicz, and mentioned in the baptismal registry as number one. He attended elementary school in 1972 in Rosochata and attended the Ukrainian High School in Legnica in the care of Jaros≈Çawy Kisielewski, dedicated and outstanding teacher. Legnica parish pastor and youth minister at the time was Father John Martyniak, now Greek Catholic Archbishop of Przemy≈õl-Warsaw. Religious life After graduation, on August 31, 1976 Juszczak joined the Basilian Order, while studying in secondary school. He took the religious name Vladimir and his novitiate under the spiritual leadership of Father Josaphat Romanyka. His first vows were on June 18, 1978 and he studied philosophy and theology at the Major Seminary in Warsaw, where he graduated in 1983 and on 1 May made his final vows. On May 8, he was ordained a deacon and was ordained priest on May 28 in Legnica, Wroclaw at the hands of Archbishop Henry Cardinal Gulbinowicz then worked as a parish priest in Bartoszyce opened in 1982 by Fr Julian Yokel and a parish in Asunach (Warmia-Mazury province), existing since 1957. In 1984 Juszczak began extramural studies at the Catholic Theological Academy in Warsaw in the Faculty of Canon Law and obtained a BA in 1990. In 1989 the Provincial Father Wasyl Medwit, the current Eparch of Kyiv appointed him to the Monastery of Warsaw, to include the duties of master of novices, and brothers prefect of students. His service in the Monastery of Warsaw took place at a time when Greek Catholic Church in Ukraine and all former communist countries went out from the underground (the modern catacombs). To give a helping hand to the Basilian communities that have just come out of hiding, and thus the whole Church, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church decided to open a monastery for Basilian novices and students from Ukraine, Romania and Slovakia. In autumn 1993 he moved to the monastery in Wƒôgorzewo, where he took the Greek Catholic parish duties, and became the dean of Olsztyn. After Father Basil Medwit's elevation to the rank of bishop, since July 1994 he became a protoihumena (provincial) of a Basilian community in Poland and returned to Warsaw. With the help of Father Jehoshaphat Romanyka, Father Meletius Bi≈Çy≈Ñskiego, Father Mark Peel, as well as the monks take case of the students, the life of the province, while performing duties of the Greek Catholic parish in Warsaw. His particular attention was devoted in 1996 to a Basilian monastery and church in Zasanie in the industry to a dedicated co-worker here in the person of superior Fr Timothy Fesza. On April 24, 1999 by decision of Pope John Paul II Juszczak was appointed Bishop of the Wroclaw-Gdansk eparchy of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and was enthroned on 19 June 1999. In 2009, the World Union Army of the Volhynia District asked the Archbishops Stanislaw Dziwisz, Kazimierz Nycz and Jozef Michalik to support a protest against the behavior of Volodymyr Juszczak and Greek Catholic Archbishop Jan Martyniak, accusing them of slander persons as Father Tadeusz Isakowicz- Zaleski, falsification of history and the development of proper ground for the rebirth of Ukrainian nationalism.

Elverum Jr. and developed by Space Technology Laboratories (TRW) for use in the Apollo Lunar Module descent stage. It used Aerozine 50 fuel and dinitrogen tetroxide () oxidizer. This engine used a pintle injector, a design also used later in the SpaceX Merlin engine.  Requirements  The propulsion system for the descent stage of the lunar module was designed to transfer the vehicle, containing two crewmen, from a circular lunar parking orbit to an elliptical descent orbit with a pericynthion of , then provide a powered descent to the lunar surface, with hover time above the lunar surface to select the exact landing site. To accomplish these maneuvers, a propulsion system was developed that used hypergolic propellants and a gimballed pressure-fed ablative cooled engine that was capable of being throttled. A lightweight cryogenic helium pressurization system was also used. The exhaust nozzle extension was designed to crush without damaging the LM if it struck the surface, which happened on Apollo 15. Development According to NASA history publication Chariots for Apollo, \\"The lunar module descent engine probably was the biggest challenge and the most outstanding technical development of Apollo.\\" A requirement for a throttleable engine was new for crewed spacecraft. Very little advanced research had been done in variable- thrust rocket engines up to that point. Rocketdyne proposed a pressure-fed engine using the injection of inert helium gas into the propellant flow to achieve thrust reduction at a constant propellant flow rate. While NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) judged this approach to be plausible, it represented a considerable advance in the state of the art. (In fact, accidental ingestion of helium pressurant proved to be a problem on AS-201, the first flight of the Apollo Service Module engine in February 1966.) Therefore, MSC directed Grumman to conduct a parallel development program of competing designs. Grumman held a bidders' conference on March 14, 1963, attended by Aerojet General, Reaction Motors Division of Thiokol, United Technology Center Division of United Aircraft, and Space Technology Laboratories, Inc. (STL). In May, STL was selected as the competitor to Rocketdyne's concept. STL proposed an engine that was gimbaled as well as throttleable, using flow control valves and a variable-area pintle injector, in much the same manner as does a shower head, to regulate pressure, rate of propellant flow, and the pattern of fuel mixture in the combustion chamber. The first full-throttle firing of Space Technology Laboratories' LM descent engine was carried out in early 1964. NASA planners expected one of the two drastically different designs would emerge the clear winner, but this did not happen throughout 1964. Apollo Spacecraft Program Office manager Joseph Shea formed a committee of NASA, Grumman and Air Force propulsion experts, chaired by American spacecraft designer Maxime Faget, in November 1964 to recommend a choice, but their results were inconclusive. Grumman chose Rocketdyne on January 5, 1965. Still not satisfied, MSC Director Robert R. Gilruth convened his own five-member board, also chaired by Faget, which reversed Grumman's decision on January 18 and awarded the contract to STL. To keep the DPS as simple, lightweight, and reliable as possible, the propellants were pressure- fed with helium gas instead of using heavy, complicated, and failure-prone turbopumps. Cryogenic supercritical helium was loaded and stored at 3500 psi.Apollo Experience Report ‚Äì Descent Propulsion System ‚Äì NASA Technical Note: March 1973 The helium was pressure regulated down to 246 psi for the propellant tanks. Pressure from the helium would gradually rise as it warmed and would eventually be vented. The system was also equipped with a rubber diaphragm that would burst when the helium pressure reached a certain level and allow the gas to vent harmlessly into space. Once the helium was gone however, the DPS would no longer be operable. This was not seen as an issue since normally, the helium release would not occur until after the lunar module was on the Moon, by which time the DPS had completed its operational life and would never be fired again. The design and development of the innovative thrust chamber and pintle design is credited to TRW Aerospace Engineer Gerard W. Elverum Jr. The engine could throttle between and but operation between 65% and 92.5% thrust was avoided to prevent excessive nozzle erosion. It weighed , with a length of and diameter of . Performance in LM \\"life boat\\" The LMDE achieved a prominent role in the Apollo 13 mission, serving as the primary propulsion engine after the oxygen tank explosion in the Apollo Service Module. After this event, the ground controllers decided that the Service Propulsion System could no longer be operated safely, leaving the DPS engine in Aquarius as the only means of maneuvering Apollo 13. However, Apollo 13 had left its initial free-return trajectory earlier in the mission, as required for the planned lunar landing at Fra Mauro. Therefore, the first order of business was to re-establish the free return trajectory with a 30.7-second burn of the LMDE. The descent engine was used again two hours after pericynthion, the closest approach to the Moon (\\"PC+2 burn\\"), to speed the return to Earth by 10 hours and move the landing spot from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. A more aggressive burn could have been performed at PC+2 by first jettisoning the service module, returning the crew in about the same amount of time as a direct abort,p. III-20 but this plan was rejected since it would require leaving the command module's heat shield exposed to the extreme temperatures of space, it would virtually deplete the DPS's propellant supply (leaving nothing for midcourse correction burns), and it would result in Apollo 13 landing in the Atlantic Ocean where the US Navy had no recovery ships placed. The 4-minute 24-second burn was so accurate that only two more small course corrections were subsequently needed before Earth reentry. Modification for Extended Lunar Module Decreased clearance led to buckling of the extended descent engine nozzle on the landing of Apollo 15 (upper right). In order to extend landing payload weight and lunar surface stay times, the last three Apollo Lunar Modules were upgraded by adding a extension to the engine bell to increase thrust. The nozzle exhaust bell, like the original, was designed to crush if it hit the surface. It never had on the first three landings, but did buckle on the first Extended landing, Apollo 15. TR-201 in Delta second stage After the Apollo program, the DPS was further developed into the TRW TR-201 engine. This engine was used in the second stage, referred to as Delta-P, of the Delta launch vehicle (Delta 1000, Delta 2000, Delta 3000 series) for 77 successful launches between 1972‚Äì1988.

The atmosphere is one of the Earth's major carbon reservoirs and an important component of the global carbon cycle, holding approximately 720 gigatons of carbon. Atmospheric carbon plays an important role in the greenhouse effect. The most important carbon compound in this respect is the gas carbon dioxide (). Although it is a small percentage of the atmosphere (approximately 0.04% on a molar basis), it plays a vital role in retaining heat in the atmosphere and thus in the greenhouse effect. Other gases with effects on the climate containing carbon in the atmosphere are methane and chlorofluorocarbons (the latter is entirely anthropogenic). Emissions by humans in the past 200 years have almost doubled the amount carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Relevant gases The concentration of mostly carbon-based greenhouse gases has increased dramatically since the onset of the industrial era. This makes an understanding of the carbon component of the atmosphere highly important. The two main carbon greenhouse gases are methane and carbon dioxide. Methane Methane (CH4) is one of the more potent greenhouse gases and is mainly produced by the digestion or decay of biological organisms. It is considered the second most important greenhouse gas, yet the methane cycle in the atmosphere is currently only poorly understood. The amount of methane produced and absorbed yearly varies widely. Large stores of methane can be found in the form of methane ice under permafrost and on continental shelves. Additional methane is produced by the anaerobic decay of organic material and is produced in organisms' digestive tracts, soil, etc. Natural methane production accounts 10-30% of global methane sources. Anthropogenic methane is produced in various ways, e.g. by raising cattle or through the decay of trash in landfills. It is also produced by several industrial sources, including the mining and distribution of fossil fuels. More than 70% of atmospheric methane comes from biogenic sources. Methane levels have risen gradually since the onset of the industrial era, from ~700 ppb in 1750 to ~1775 ppb in 2005. Methane can be removed from the atmosphere through a reaction of the photochemically produced hydroxyl free radical (OH). It can also leave the atmosphere by entering the stratosphere, where it is destroyed, or by being absorbed into soil sinks. Because methane reacts fairly quickly with other compounds, it does not stay in the atmosphere as long as many other greenhouse gases, e.g. carbon dioxide. It has an atmospheric lifetime of about eight years. This keeps the concentration of methane in the atmosphere relatively low and is the reason that it currently plays a secondary role in the greenhouse effect to carbon dioxide, despite the fact that it produces a much more powerful greenhouse effect per volume. Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide () has a large warming effect on global temperatures through the greenhouse effect. Although individual CO2 molecules have a short residence time in the atmosphere, it takes an extremely long time for carbon dioxide levels to sink after sudden rises, due to e.g. volcanic eruptions or human activity and among the many long-lasting greenhouse gases, it is the most important because it makes up the largest fraction of the atmosphere. Since the industrial revolution, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has risen from about 280 ppm to almost 400 ppm. Although the amount of CO2 introduced makes up only a small portion of the global carbon cycle, carbon dioxide's long residence time makes these emissions relevant for the total carbon balance. The increased carbon dioxide concentration strengthens the greenhouse effect, causing changes to the global climate. Of the increased amounts of carbon dioxide that are introduced to the atmosphere each year, approximately 80% are from the combustion of fossil fuels and cement production. The other ~20% originate from land use change and deforestation. Because gaseous carbon dioxide does not react quickly with other chemicals, the main processes that change the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere involve exchanges with the earth's other carbon reservoirs, as explained in the following sections. Interactions with other systems Major global carbon reservoirs and flows between them. Atmospheric carbon is exchanged quickly between the oceans and the terrestrial biosphere. This means that at times the atmosphere acts as a sink, and at other times as a source of carbon. The following section introduces exchanges between the atmospheric and other components of the global carbon cycle. Terrestrial biosphere Carbon is exchanged with varying speed with the terrestrial biosphere. It is absorbed in the form of carbon dioxide by autotrophs and converted into organic compounds. Carbon is also released from the biosphere into the atmosphere in the course of biological processes. Aerobic respiration converts organic carbon into carbon dioxide and a particular type of anaerobic respiration converts it into methane. After respiration, both carbon dioxide and methane are typically emitted into the atmosphere. Organic carbon is also released into the atmosphere during burning. The residence time of carbon in the terrestrial biosphere varies and is dependent on a large number of factors. The uptake of carbon into the biosphere occurs on various time scales. Carbon is absorbed primarily during plant growth. A pattern of increased carbon uptake is observable both over the course of the day (less carbon is absorbed at night) and over the course of the year (less carbon is absorbed in winter). While organic matter in animals generally decays quickly, releasing much of its carbon into the atmosphere through respiration, carbon stored as dead plant matter can stay in the biosphere for as much as a decade or more. Different plant types of plant matter decay at different rates - for example, woody substances retain their carbon longer than soft, leafy material. Active carbon in soils can stay sequestered for up to a thousand years, while inert carbon in soils can stay sequestered for more than a millennium. Oceans Large amounts of carbon are exchanged each year between the ocean and the atmosphere. A major controlling factor in oceanic- atmospheric carbon exchange is thermohaline circulation. In regions of ocean upwelling, carbon-rich water from the deep ocean comes to the surface and releases carbon into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Large amounts of carbon dioxide are dissolved in cold water in higher latitudes. This water sinks down and brings the carbon into the deeper ocean levels, where it can stay for anywhere between decades and several centuries. Ocean circulation events cause this process to be variable. For example, during El Nino events there is less deep ocean upwelling, leading to lower outgassing of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Biological processes also lead to ocean-atmosphere carbon exchange. Carbon dioxide equilibrates between the atmosphere and the ocean's surface layers. As autotrophs add or subtract carbon dioxide from the water through photosynthesis or respiration, they modify this balance, allowing the water to absorb more carbon dioxide or causing it to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Geosphere Carbon is generally exchanged very slowly between the atmosphere and geosphere. Two exceptions are volcanic eruptions and the combustion of fossil fuels, both of which release high amounts carbon into the atmosphere very quickly. Fresh silicate rock that is exposed through geological processes absorbs carbon from the atmosphere when it is exposed to air by the processes of weathering and erosion. Anthropogenic sources Human activities change the amount of carbon in the atmosphere directly through the burning of fossil fuels and other organic material, thus oxidizing the organic carbon and producing carbon dioxide. Another human-caused source of carbon dioxide is cement production. The burning of fossil fuels and cement production are the main reasons for the increase in atmospheric CO2 since the beginning of the industrial era. Other human-caused changes in the atmospheric carbon cycle are due to anthropogenic changes to carbon reservoirs. Deforestation, for example, decreases the biosphere's ability to absorb carbon, thus increasing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. As the industrial use of carbon by humans is a very new dynamic on a geologic scale, it is important to be able to track sources and sinks of carbon in the atmosphere. One way of doing so is by observing the proportion of stable carbon isotopes present in the atmosphere. The two main carbon isotopes are 12C and 13C. Plants absorb the lighter isotope, 12C, more readily than 13C. Because fossil fuels originate mainly from plant matter, the 13C/12C ratio in the atmosphere falls when large amounts of fossil fuels are burned, releasing 12C. Conversely, an increase in the 13C/12C in the atmosphere suggests a higher biospheric carbon uptake. The ratio of the annual increase in atmospheric CO2 compared to CO2 emissions from fossil fuel and cement manufactured is called the \\"airborne fraction.\\". The airborne fraction has been around 60% since the 1950s, indicating that about 60% of the new carbon dioxide in the atmosphere each year originated from human sources. For clarity, this is not meant to suggest that 60% of the uptake of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere comes from human activity. It means that the atmosphere exchanges around 210 gigatonnes of carbon annually, but absorbs between 6 and 10 gigatonnes more than it loses. Of this net gain, about 60% is attributable to the burning of fossil fuels.

Jean Paul Lehners (born 20 April 1948 in Grand Duchy of Luxembourg) is a Luxembourgish Historian specialized in the field of global and demographic history. He is also involved in the study of human rights. Jean-Paul Lehners is Professor of Global History and Holder of the UNESCO Chair in Human Rights at the University of Luxembourg. Academic life After completing the ‚ÄúCours Sup√©rieurs‚Äù (higher courses) in Luxembourg in 1967, Jean-Paul Lehners studied in Strasbourg (France) as well as Vienna (Austria) between 1968 and 1973. In 1973, Lehners obtained a Doctorate‚Äôs degree from the University of Vienna. From 1973 to 1975, Lehners worked as the assistant of Michael Mitterauer at the Institut f√ºr Wirtschafts- und Sozialgeschichte der Universit√§t Wien. Between 1976 and 1994, Lehners was lecturing at the University of Trier on themes such as quantitative methods in history, historical demography, history of family structures, analysis of school manuals, fear & security in the 16th‚Äì20th century, history of European expansions by texts and controversy on numbers in history between 1976 and 1994. In 1975, Jean Paul Lehners completed his internship and became course responsible at Lyc√©e Michel Rodange, where he worked until 1980. Afterwards, he moved to Lyc√©e technique Michel Lucius and taught here as a teacher until 1987, then moved back to his former institution, Lyc√©e Michel-Rodange, and where he taught until 1995. Between 1984 and 1987, Lehners became the teaching responsible at the Centre Universitaire; then became the course responsible until 1990. Jean Paul Lehners obtained the title of professor in 1990 and taught at the Centre Universitaire and, from 2003 onwards, at the University of Luxembourg. He is currently still teaching at this institution. Lehners became the vice-rector of the University of Luxembourg between 2003‚Äì2007. Since 2011, Jean-Paul Lehners is active as the first Holder of the UNESCO Chair in Human Rights at the University of Luxembourg. Social Work When Lehners was a student, he was taking part in ALUC (Association Luxembourgeoise des Universitaires Catholiques) as his orientation was towards the catholic left wing. However, after a period of time, he quit this association for good as he thought it was just a political ensemble. According to Lehners, it was the first step of joining into the Christian Social Party. While he was studying in Vienna, he took part in a reflection group where he learnt about non-violent action and how to solve conflicts without causing harm from an Indian Jesuite. The social aspect of society has always been highly important for Lehners, that is to say, taking action for the poor and prioritizing the poor. As a result, he joined to the Jugendpoor; an organization of young people who would meet every Thursday to celebrate the mass along with the poor. Consequently, the periodical ‚ÄúForum‚Äù was born along with other organizations like ASTI, ASTM, etc. due to the activities of Jugendpoor which was backed by the Second Vatican Council (also known as Vatican II).RHEIN, Jean. ‚ÄúJ√ºrgen Stoldt: ¬´forum est une plateforme pour le d√©bat soci√©tal¬ª‚Äù.

Formation  During the mining process, water must be emptied. But after the mining operation has been abandoned, groundwater is allowed to seep in, and rainwater collects in the quarry. The depth of a quarry lake is dependent upon rainfall in the region.  Hazards to Humans  Water-filled quarries can be very deep, often or more, and surprisingly cold, so swimming in quarry lakes is generally not recommended. Unexpectedly cold water can cause a swimmer's muscles to suddenly weaken; it can also cause shock and even hypothermia. Though quarry water is often very clear, submerged quarry stones and abandoned equipment make diving into these quarries extremely dangerous. Several people drown in quarries each year.

Clayton was born on September 12, 1955, at the U.S. Army Hospital in Fort Benning, Georgia. Clayton was the oldest of six children, having one brother and four sisters, and was named after his father, Clayton Raleigh Fountain. The family moved every 1¬Ω to 2 years. While his father served combat tours in Korea and Vietnam and his mother was working, Clayton, as the oldest child in family, became a surrogate for both parents when he was very young. He recalled maternal responsibilities for cooking, ironing, serving, cleaning, and caring for his young siblings. While serving in the Marines, he was convicted of murdering his staff sergeant in 1974, while stationed in the Philippines. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, and was ultimately sent to the United States Penitentiary, Marion, which was at the time the highest- security prison in the United States. Fountain murdered three prisoners and one correctional officer with a shiv while serving time at Marion, and was labeled the \\"Most Dangerous Prisoner\\" in the federal system. Correction Officer Robert L. Hoffmann On October 22, 1983, Fountain stabbed Correction Officer Robert L. Hoffmann to death, hours after Fountain's friend and fellow Aryan Brotherhood member Thomas Silverstein stabbed another correction officer, Merle Clutts, to death at the same facility. The incidents resulted in a 23-year lockdown at Marion, and contributed to the creation of the federal supermax prison, United States Penitentiary, Florence ADX. Fountain was moved to the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri. He was housed in a specially constructed confinement unit, and was allowed contact only with authorized personnel. Fountain converted to Catholicism, and completed several educational courses on theology during the twenty years he spent in virtual isolation. By distance, he earned an associate degree in business and a bachelor's degree in philosophy and business by distance from Ohio University, and earned a Catholic Catechetical Diploma and began a Master of Arts in Religious Studies from Catholic Distance University. He developed ties with an order of Trappist monks, and was accepted posthumously as a lay brother after his unexpected death from a heart attack in 2004.

It was written by L√≥pez, Roth, and Guillermo Amoedo, from a story by Roth and L√≥pez. Plot Three travelers, Gringo, Ariel, and Pollo travel through Chile. They party in a club and meet three young women, Hungarian sisters Monica and Kylie, and their Russian friend Irina. The two groups pair up and decide to travel down to Valparaiso together. They party at another club in Valparaiso when an earthquake strikes, killing many of the partygoers and trapping some under debris. Ariel's hand is cut off as he tries to help a trapped bartender. The group tries to get out but their exit is blocked by more falling debris. The cleaning lady of the club leads them through a tunnel to a nearby manhole. As they proceed to climb out, a passing truck hits the old lady and kills her. Once out on the street, the group tries to get to their car but find it destroyed. Ariel's condition continues to get worse due to blood loss and the group decides that they need to get him to the hospital on top of the hill as soon as possible. Suddenly, a tsunami warning is heard and they all rush to the hillside cable tram station that could quickly take them up the hill. After some intense negotiation, the owner agrees to allow only Ariel to board the tram car. The group watches the tram reach the top of the hill when suddenly a frayed cable breaks, causing the tram to fall all the way back down, destroying the tram and killing everyone inside. After mourning the death of their friend, the group heads toward the cemetery, trying to reach the cathedral at the top of the hill through a previously mentioned hidden tunnel. The group comes upon a looting party on the street which turns out to be escaped prisoners from a nearby prison that was damaged during the earthquake. They try to run past, but the women of the group attracts their attention. While running away, part of a building falls on top of Gringo and pins him in place, still alive and conscious. Monica and Pollo leave to get help while Irina and Kylie stay with Gringo. While they are seeking help, Monica and Pollo come across an out-of- control firetruck. The truck crashes and one of the firefighters in the cab is run through by wooden beams while the other one is trapped. Pollo and Monica get the living firefighter out, who explains that some prisoners were trying to take over the firetruck, which was why it went out of control. Meanwhile, as Irina is trying to comfort the seriously injured Gringo, Kylie hears the prisoners approaching. Gringo tells Kylie and Irina to hide, reasoning that they would only take his money. The women hide in the tombs while the prisoners threaten Gringo. They pour alcohol on him, threatening to light him up if he doesn't tell them where the women were. Frightened, Gringo motions toward their hiding place with his eyes. Irina crawls out of her hiding place and tries to run away. She is quickly captured by the prisoners. The leader of the prisoners rapes Irina while the rest of the gang sit around telling jokes. Gringo throws a rock at the leader, trying to stop him from continuing raping Irina. The leader, enraged, lights him up and burns Gringo alive, killing him. Kylie, hearing all the chaos outside decides to run. The group goes after her, but the leader's brother stays behind to continue raping Irina. Kylie is able to run away, bumping into Monica and the others. They go back for Irina and Pollo axes the leader's brother to death. Just as the group is about to run, the prisoners return, the leader seeing the dead body of his brother and fires at them, killing Irina. The rest of the group manages to escape and comes across a gated building with other survivors who live there. A single mother does not want to let them through but her neighbor wants to open the gate. As Pollo begs, the woman shoots him in the chest injuring him. The others help carry him away but decided to hide him so they can go get help. Pollo's phone suddenly rings and one of the prisoners hears it and finds him. They kill him and continue to go after the others. The group finally arrives at the cathedral where they are saved by a priest who shuts the door just in time. As another aftershock hits, the Cathedral begins to fall apart. The priest leads them to a secret passage inside the cathedral. As the group descends a ladder through the secret passage, another aftershock shakes the ladder off. The priest falls off in the process to his death, and Kylie falls on top of a metal object that pierces her thigh. Monica, meanwhile, is stranded at the top alone as she was the last to go down the ladder. The firefighter attempts to help Kylie by removing the object and takes off his own coat to try to stop the bleeding. Taking off his coat reveals the prison tattoos on his arms and shoulders. He turns out to be one of the escaped prisoners who was taking over the fire truck, Kylie panics and promises that she won't tell anyone. Monica is able to find some ropes and goes down the ladder shaft to an empty landing. She finds Kylie's body in one of the tunnels. The fake firefighter/prisoner then tries to kill her but an aftershock occurs and Monica is able to kill him with the axe instead. Monica finally manages to escape through the tunnel and onto a beach. She walks around the beach, bewildered that she was able to escape to safety at last. As she turns around, she sees a very tall tsunami rushing towards her.

The film was based on true events from the 2010 8.8 earthquake in Chile. It was shot in Chile, in many of the same locations where the destruction took place. The idea came from a conversation with Roth and Lopez, where Lopez described the horrors of not just the earthquake, but the complete chaos and temporary collapse of society in the ensuing hours. The film is distributed by Dimension Films. Roth raised $2 million in funding from a group of doctors in Buffalo. Distribution rights were presold to recoup the budget costs. L√≥pez had previous experience shooting using Digital SLR cameras, and after screen tests, convinced Roth that with the right lenses and lighting it would look like 35mm film. The entire movie was recorded using a Canon EOS 5D camera. Release The film initially received a NC-17 rating, and consequently had to be re-edited so that it would achieve an R rating.  Reception = Critical response  Rotten Tomatoes gives Aftershock a 38% approval rating based on 52 reviews, with an average score of 4.61/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Aftershock hints at an inventive twist on horror tropes, but ultimately settles for another round of mind-numbing depravity that may alternately bore and revolt all but the most ardent gore enthusiasts\\". Metacritic gives a 39 rating, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\", based on reviews from 20 critics.  Box office  The film opened at 110 theatres in the United States, and earned $40,179 in its opening weekend.

It consists of the twelfth and thirteenth episodes of the season, which were initially broadcast in the United States on FX on March 15 and March 22, 2012, respectively. In the installment, Commander Anthony Drake (Bryan Cranston) urges the field agents of ISIS to travel onto the spacecraft Horizon to aid in ceasing any attacks. After entering and defeating the resistant \\"mutineers\\", the field agents are eventually kidnapped by Drake and his aggregation, whose real objective is to colonize and populate the humans on Mars. \\"Space Race\\", which was written and directed by series creator Adam Reed, is a parody of the 1979 spy film Moonraker, the eleventh film of the James Bond cinema franchise. Additionally, the episode is instilled with multiple references to science fiction cinema, including the popular films Aliens, The Right Stuff, and Star Wars Episode IV, as well as political events such as the Cold War's space exploration competition between the Soviet Union and the United States. Cranston guest starred in the program, alongside actor Dave Willis, who reprised his role as recurring antagonist Barry Dylan. \\"Space Race: Part I\\" received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics, who praised the episode's humor and character developments. Although it acquired positive critiques from commentators, the humor and general execution of \\"Space Race: Part II\\" was deemed inferior to its predecessor. \\"Space Race: Part I\\" garnered 1.157 million viewers during its initial airing, while \\"Space Race: Part II\\" attained 1.33 million viewers upon airing, consequently becoming the most viewed episode of Archer third season. Plot=Part I The international space station Horizon sends a distress signal to the ISIS agency, stating that the spaceship has been under attack. Anthony Drake (Bryan Cranston), the commander of the station, has urged ISIS to assist the crew in controlling the situation. A reluctant Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler) is the first one to voice concern over the issue, as none of them have undergone training in preparation for a flight. Despite these concerns, Malory Archer (Jessica Walter) is quick to take the job for financial gain. The field agents of ISIS‚Äîexcept Sterling Archer (H. Jon Benjamin), who is being evaluated by Doctor Algernop Krieger (Lucky Yates) for medical purposes‚Äîare subjected to basic astronaut regimens in anticipation for the flight, including a flight simulator (which Archer makes Cyril crash), and weightlessness training, which causes Lana to vomit copiously because of the lack of gravity. ISIS is forced to quit mission training due to time constraints. After the space shuttle Intrepid exits out of the Earth's atmosphere, Drake introduces them to the blueprints of Horizon, which is overrun with so-called \\"mutineers\\". Drake's plan is to fight past the mutineers and link up with his men on the bridge. The group is aided with an M41A pulse rifle, which is set into two modes: on kill mode, the weapon fires lethal plasma ammunition, while the weapon serves as a tranquilizer on stun mode. Indeed, stun mode can potentially initiate cardiac arrest, as proven when Archer accidentally shoots Cyril Figgis (Chris Parnell), who is later revived after defibrillation. The trajectory of the shuttle is off course from Horizon, which is later found to be caused by Cheryl Tunt (Judy Greer) and Pam Poovey (Amber Nash), who are being harbored in cargo. Archer is then put on probation in the hold, after shooting Pam with his pulse rifle. As the Intrepid lands on a port on the Horizon, Lana, Cyril, and Ray Gillette (Adam Reed) enter into the spacecraft with Drake. Being overwhelmed by the number of mutineers, Archer later joins their endeavors after being released by Pam. The party successfully makes it to the bridge, where it is revealed that Drake and his men are the real mutineers, and his real plan was to lure Lana onto the station to become breeding stock for the colonization of Mars. Part II Archer, Lana, Ray, and Cyril are subsequently kidnapped by Commander Drake and his aggregation, after finding out that his main intent was to terraform Mars. Meanwhile, Drake sends some of his crew to search for Pam, Cheryl, and Malory‚Äîwho are waiting in the Intrepid. In the holding, Lana takes off her suit in order to distract the guard with her breasts. While successfully distracting the guard, he later activates the security breach. After escaping from their holding, the group encounter a group of scientists, who inform them that Drake's men are making their way into the Intrepid to launch towards Mars. As Cheryl allures Drake with her self-proclaimed \\"Martian queen\\" persona, Pam takes him hostage, holding a pulse rifle to his head. After the ISIS agents reunite and Drake's mutinous crew agrees to surrender in order to prevent his death, Drake has a mental breakdown, declaring humanity to be doomed and killing himself with Pam's rifle. Cyril, startled by the sudden gunfire, opens fire himself, killing three people (one of whom was the only capable pilot of the shuttle other than Drake). To worsen the situation, Barry Dylan (Dave Willis) challenges Archer to fight him in space. Despite the rigorous taunting and demeaning from Barry, Archer ultimately declines his offer. After Archer makes an act of humility, Cyril aims the launches at Barry's jet, subsequently stranding him on Horizon. As the group nears the airstrip, Archer, who wishes to take credit for the landing, messes with the steering shift, causing the spacecraft to crash. Afterwards, every ISIS agent except for Archer is shown to be injured as a result, especially Ray, who is now paralyzed from the waist down (which he ironically had pretended to be earlier in the season). Production Cheryl's attire is very similar to the swan dress worn by Icelandic recording artist Bj√∂rk (pictured). \\"Space Race\\" was written and directed by Archer creator Adam Reed. American actor Bryan Cranston guest starred in \\"Space Race\\" as Commander Drake, an industrious and fastidious astronaut whose main objective is to fight in order to \\"quell a mutiny on the space platform\\". Cranston's appearance was formally announced by series creator Adam Reed in January 2012, while being interviewed by The Huffington Post. While Reed didn't reveal much on the background of the installment, he teased: \\"I love it when everybody gets to go [on a mission], so a lot more people than you would think get to go to outer space.\\" \\"Space Race\\" is imbued with various references relating to music, cinema, media, and other popular culture entities. The episode title gives homage to the synonymously named era of space exploration between the Soviet Union and the United States, which coincided during the Cold War. The episode plot gives homage to the James Bond film Moonraker (1979). In preparation for the mission, the field agents at ISIS undergo an extensive training regimen similar to the exercise in The Right Stuff (1983). In addition, the episode's narrative is evocative to that of the aforementioned film, as well as the British horror film 28 Days Later (2002). To Jesse Carp of Cinema Blend, the characters \\"drops weird name references\\" to figures such as American eugenist Charles Davenport and Grace O'Malley. After main character Sterling Archer is sent into the space brig, he crafts an ode to The Great Escape (1963). As the second part of \\"Space Race\\" commenced, Carp asserted that Drake's opening dialogue was nostalgic of a villainous character from the James Bond film series, particularly Hugo Drax. \\"'SR:P2' tried to clear up this flimsy plot point from 'P1' during the opening 'Bond villain' like speech from Drake,\\" the Cinema Blend writer iterated, \\"where he proclaims in a Thank You For Smoking‚Äìesque throwaway line that Lana was the perfect and only candidate for the project.\\" In one of Barry's first appearances on the space station, he is taunting \\"Archer, come out to play\\", while banging beer bottles together, directly referencing David Patrick Kelly's Luthor in The Warriors. The design of the spaceship emulates the iconic designs of aircraft from varying films; the trash compactors were modeled after the Star Wars universe, while the robots were reminiscent to those in the 1986 film Aliens. As Cheryl declares herself as the \\"Martian queen\\", she creates and sports a costumes that closely resembles Bj√∂rk's swan dress. Reception=Ratings \\"Space Race: Part I\\" was originally broadcast on March 16, 2012 in the United States on FX. Upon airing, the episode attained 1.157 million viewers and a 0.7 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, indicating that 0.7% of spectators between ages 18 and 49 who watched television viewed the episode. It garnered the twentieth highest ratings among the 18‚Äì49 group out of any cable program of the day, according to the Nielsen Media Research, tying with television programs such as The Daily Show on Comedy Central and Family Guy on Adult Swim. Ratings and total viewership for the episode showed significant increases from the previous installment, \\"Skin Game\\", which acquired 1.04 million viewers and a 0.5 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. \\"Space Race: Part II\\" aired the following week on March 23, 2012. Ratings and total viewership considerable increased from its predecessor; 1.326 million spectators watched the episode during its initial airing. Concurrently, it obtained a 0.8 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, thereby becoming the eighth highest-rated cable program of the night. Critical response Commentators commended the first half of \\"Space Race\\". The A.V. Club columnist Emily VanDerWerff approved of several aspects of the episode‚Äîmainly its animation, character development, and dialogue. In her A grade review, VanDerWerff felt that the producers were playful with the concepts of space. \\"Archer, of course, takes place in a weird blend of past and present,\\" he professed, \\"but 'Space Race' goes out of its way to toss 'future' into the middle of that mix as well. There are so many jokes that come just from the characters hanging out in anti-gravity, for God's sake, including a ping pong paddle strategically covering Pam's breasts.\\" Commenting on the program's animation, The A.V. Club journalist thought that its emphasis on the convergence of various science fiction techniques resulted in aesthetically pleasing visuals. VanDerWerff stated, \\"Everything about this one gleams, and it makes for an Archer that will almost certainly look great in HD.\\" Furthermore, he adulated the episode's dialogue, avouching that even the characters with very limited screen time were given opportunities to shine with humor. Although Marcos Canales of Screen Invasion opined that \\"Space Race: Part I\\" contained far too many one-liners and jokes, he praised the storyline and was keen to the character progression of Lana. \\"Usually, she‚Äôs the best agent ISIS has and can do pretty much anything,\\" explained Canales, \\"so putting her in a situation where she was not a bad ass gave the character some added depth which is something most animated shows don‚Äôt prioritize.\\" Cinema Blend's Jesse Carp‚Äîdespite criticizing the show's \\"nonsensical\\" narrative‚Äîdeclared it to be hilarious. Breaking Bad actor Bryan Cranston (pictured) made a guest appearance on the installment. Cranston's acting was cited as a highlight by television critics. Despite positive assessments, \\"Space Race: Part II\\" produced more variety within critical opinion. In his \\"commendable\\" 8.6 out of ten rating review, Ross Bonaime of Paste asserted that the program displayed some exceptional dimension into the characters‚Äîfrom Lana's apparent self-consciousness, to Cheryl's eccentric and \\"odd\\" persona, and Krieger's past. Ultimately, Bonaime professed that \\"Space Race: Part II\\" was slightly inferior to its predecessor; \\"'Space Race, Part II' doesn‚Äôt have some of the big laughs that the first part featured. By that, I mean Archer never rode Cyril through waves of Lana‚Äôs puke joyously. It is a step down from the first part comedically, but the episode does give us a few fun moments for each member of the cast.\\" Analogous sentiments were echoed by Blair Marnell of CraveOnline, who concluded: \\"The space adventure had some fun moments, but it seemed to lack the punch provided by the two episodes that proceeded it. Even though it was good to see Barry again this season, his appearance in this episode seemed pretty tacked on.\\" VanDerWerff affirmed that the episode was a superb conclusion to Archer third season, despite not being as \\"relentlessly entertaining\\" as \\"Space Race: Part I\\". While deeming the episode as a hilarious finale, TV Overmind writer Kevin Fitzpatrick claimed that \\"Space Race: Part II\\" left many unanswered questions to the audience. Conversely, Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic applauded the episode, issuing it a 4.7 out of 5 stars. \\"Archer ended its third season tonight with the conclusion to its two part episode, 'Space Race'. And, man, from the second Archer announced he left his light saber in his other space pants, you knew you were in for a solid ending.\\" Cranston's performance was a frequent topic in the critiques. Even prior to the airing of the episode, James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly suggested that the actor's voice would be perfect for an animated television series. VanDerWerff and Carp were amongst the journalists who issued favorable assessments of Cranston's acting. Carp noted that \\"Cranston's work is even more impressive when you consider that he not only plays the hero and villain but manages to be funny as both.\\" In addressing \\"Part II\\", Carp concluded that \\"as early as the stunning end of the world sequence, the actor plants the hint of suppressed craziness in Spaceman Drake and it was soon obvious that the just crew would not only be manning a mission to help him combat the mutineers but probably get wrapped up in this nut's dream to terra form Mars.\\" For VanDerWerff, \\"Cranston is the very best kind of guest voice, fully inhabiting his character but also having a lot of fun with the jokes. It‚Äôs a nice reminder of just how funny Cranston can be, and I hope he gets even more bizarre stuff to do next week.\\" Jonah Gardner of Ology later said, \\"Bryan Cranston remains a god among men.\\" ReferencesExternal links \\"Space Race: Part I\\" at TV.com \\"Space Race: Part II\\" at TV.com 2012 American television episodes Archer (2009 TV series) episodes Television episodes set in space Works about astronauts ","title":"Space Race (Archer)"},{"id":"35997683","text":"Shahrak-e Shahid Dastghib or Shahrak-e Shahid Dastgheyb () may refer to: * Shahrak-e Shahid Dastgheyb, Fars * Shahrak-e Shahid Dastghib, South Khorasan ","title":"Shahrak-e Shahid Dastghib"},{"id":"35997688","text":"Vahdat Kamrud (, also Romanized as Va·∏•dat KƒÅmr≈´d) is a village in Seh Qaleh Rural District, Seh Qaleh District, Sarayan County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

It was added to Alabama's Places in Peril in 2012, a listing that highlights significantly endangered properties in the state. History Lakewood was built for Joseph Lake, a native of North Carolina, by Hiram W. Bardwell, a master builder. Construction was completed in 1840. Located adjacent to the University of West Alabama, Julia Strudwick Tutwiler, a Lake relative, periodically resided in the house from 1881 to 1910 while she served as president of the university. It was then known as Livingston Normal College. The house was extensively photographed by Alex Bush for the Historic American Buildings Survey in November and December 1936. Lakewood has continued to be owned by descendants of the Lake family to the current day. The house and its surviving of grounds were listed on the Places in Peril in 2012 due to the immediate threat of its acquisition by developers. Architecture The house has a plan that is relatively rare in early Alabama architecture. The plan features a brick ground floor that is topped by one and a half stories of wood-frame construction. The ground floor originally contained domestic spaces, with the formal rooms on the principal floor and bedrooms on the upper floor. A central hallway is present on all levels. The facade is five bays wide, with central entrance doors on the ground and principal floors. The bays are divided by two-story Doric pilasters, with the middle third of the facade occupied by a two-tiered tetrastyle Doric portico. Two curved wrought iron staircases ascend from ground level to the front center of the upper portico, leading to the formal entrance.

The program integrates voice biometric authentication (speaker recognition) with a minimum of three layers of data encryption. A password bank should not be confused with a password manager, which typically encrypts data (passwords), but utilizes a different mechanism than voice biometric for authentication.  Origins of password banks  The average web user needs to remember 6.5 passwords, leaving many users to try to cut corners.\\"Drowning in Passwords? You're Not the Only One,\\" by Kendra Srivastava. Mobiledia, March 12, 2012. http://www.mobiledia.com/news/131786.html The challenge in remembering all of these passwords tends to invoke one of two actions: changing passwords on a regular basis or using a single password for all websites. With the latter, an attacker would only need to break one password to harvest an individual's entire online identity. Password cracking is an issue professional organizations are protecting themselves against. In June 2011, the storage service Drop Box failed to protect password authentication for a period of four hours, exposing the files of 25 million users.‚ÄúDropbox Left User Accounts Unlocked for 4 Hours Sunday,‚Äù by Ryan Singel, Wired, June 20, 2011. https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/06/dropbox/ The Ponemon Institute surveyed 830 information technology, security, and compliance professionals.

As a result, industry experts continue to seek out alternatives to standard passphrase authentication systems. Opus Senior Analyst Researcher Dan Miller said that ‚ÄúVoice biometrics strikes the right balance between strong authentication and usability.‚Äù‚ÄúVoice Biometric to Play a Key Role In Security in 2012,‚Äù Elephant Talk News, January 18, 2012. http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/23332/voice-biometrics-will-be-the- authentication-of-choice-says-opus-research/. Opus Research in connection with ValidSoft concluded that ‚Äúthe conditions are ripe for the emergence of voice biometrics as the dominant means of authentication, particularly for financial transactions. The key drivers are the growth of mobile banking and e-finance together with the intrinsic lack of security on mobile devices. A secure means of authenticating mobile devices is an increasing necessity.‚Äù\\"Voice biometrics will be the authentication of choice, says Opus Research,\\" Infosecurity, January 19, 2012, http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/23332/voice- biometrics-will-be-the-authentication-of-choice-says-opus-research/.  Vulnerabilities  Critics of voice biometrics have identified duplication as its biggest challenge. The prevalent risk of someone copying an individual's voice has slowed down the integration of biometrics into data security systems. A password bank works around this pitfall by implementing a process known as random phrasology. Each human voice is unique and consists of over 2000 biometric parameters. Voice biometric software records the highly specific timber of each voice and creates a unique and proprietary log in as authentication. Each time a user attempts to log in, they are prompted to read a random phrase. A password bank has a minimum of 100 phrases built into its software. Users are granted three opportunities to read the phrase accurately. If the sentence is read properly and the voice parameters (timber) match the attempted user's pre-recorded voice, they will then be logged in. In terms of duplication probability, there is a less than one per cent chance that a copied voice could match the random phrase.  Encryption  A password bank differs from a password manager in that the encryption mechanism to secure data (passwords) includes three layers of different encryption families. In addition, data is encrypted within private clouds as well as along public clouds (between mobile devices and PCs.) Data stored in secure private corporate clouds is referred to as ‚Äúrested.‚Äù Data shared between two independent devices is considered to be ‚Äúin motion.‚Äù The distinction represents a significant shift in communication as data is sent and shared from remote locations. Modular approach Password banks utilize a modular approach when designing data security systems. Software utilizing modular programming divides mechanisms such as authentication and authorization into separate components, allowing each part to be removed or reconfigured with ease. Password banks are built on the premise that solid security (voice biometric authentication and three layered encryption) will not interfere with ease of use.

It is known for its waterfalls, near its mouth in Gooseberry Falls State Park. The Gooseberry, like many of its neighboring streams, has an irregular discharge highly dependent on runoff from rain and snow melt. The region around the river was heavily forested and much logging took place during the early 20th century. The forest has since regrown and the falls and mouth of the river are now a thriving tourist destination. Name The English name for the Gooseberry River first appeared in 1823 on a map made by Major Stephen Harriman Long during his expedition of the Canada‚ÄìUS border region. There are two competing theories about the origin of the Gooseberry's name. The Ojibwe name for the river is shab-on-im-i-kan-i-sibi, which translates to River Place of Gooseberries.Morse-Kahn, Deborah. Lake Superior's Historic North Shore, A Guided Tour. p. 85. Minnesota Historical Society, 2008. Alternatively, the name has been taken as an translation of the name of the French explorer Groseilliers. The name Reviere de Groseilliers appeared on early French maps of the area as early as 1670, and Groseilliers visited the North Shore region in the 1660s. The puzzle of the true origin has not been solved conclusively, and the state park lists both as plausible explanations.

Major tributaries include the Little Gooseberry River, Skunk Creek, and Mink Creek.USGS Topographical Map, Two Harbors. . Accessed June 2, 2012. The most distinctive features of Gooseberry River are the Gooseberry Falls, three waterfalls in close succession near Highway 61 in Gooseberry Falls State Park. They begin .95 miles from the mouth of the river 120 feet above lake level, and end .75 miles from the mouth at 7 feet above lake level.Leverett, Frank. Moraines and Shore Lines of the Lake Superior Basin. Shorter Contributions to General Geology, 1928. United States Geological Survey. p. 11. Another fall is located between 1.8 and 1.85 miles from the mouth. The bed of the river near the falls is a basalt flow lying over an Amygdaloid flow. The Amygadloids erode faster than basalt, which then breaks off in large pieces, causing the high cliffs over which the river flows.Schwartz, G. M. A Guidebook to Minnesota Trunk Highway No. 1. Minnesota Geological Survey, Bulletin no. 20. 1925. p. 72. Below the falls, the river cuts a large channel through mostly clay. To the northeast, a large basalt cliff rises 75 feet above lake level.Winchell, N. H. The Geological and Natural History Survey of Minnesota, The Tenth Annual Report for the Year 1881. p. 37. St. Paul, 1882. To the southwest of the mouth is a lower cliff of only 10 feet, which was probably once attached to the high bluff before the river cut a channel between them. At the mouth, the flow of the river meets the opposing force of storms on the lake, kicking up a bar of red pebbles and chalcedony agates. Due to the lack of a headwater, the Gooseberry's flow comes nearly entirely from runoff. Accordingly, the flow is heaviest during the spring snow melt, and comparatively the river may run nearly dry during the summer. Ecology Gooseberry River is populated by brook, brown, and rainbow trout in the stretches above the barrier falls, and sees runs of steelhead in April and May.Johnson, Mickey.

Accessed August 29, 2012. Loggers followed in the 1890s. In July 1899, Colonel John H. Knight and former Senator of Wisconsin William Freeman Vilas, owners of the Superior Lumber Company, acquired for $1,000,000 land around the Gooseberry River estimated to contain four hundred million feet of standing pine. Logs felled from the forests around the Gooseberry were rafted to Knight and Vilas's lumber mills in Ashland, Wisconsin. One year later, these lands were acquired, along with Knight and Vilas's Ashland mill, by Thomas Nestor of the Nestor Logging Company for $1,250,000. The Nestor Logging Company set up its headquarters at the mouth of the Gooseberry, and built a logging railroad running inland to harvest the thick pine stands in the region. The railway was removed by 1908, but when the Virginia & Rainy Lake Company began logging further inland, the Nestor grade was once again used to build a spur line to connect the project with the Duluth & Northern Minnesota Railway. In the upper reaches of the watershed of the Gooseberry and its tributaries, communities began to grow on the Alger Line. One, London, was located where the Alger Line passed over the headwaters of the tributary Dago Creek at . A sleigh road connecting Two Harbors and Beaver Bay ran alongside the railway through the upper Gooseberry watershed. Logging and fire exhausted the pine by the 1920s, and loggers moved out of the region. The Alger Line ceased to operate in 1923 and London became a ghost town. A few houses were reported standing in the 1950s, but more modern reports claim only foundations remain. The site is now the subject of ghost stories. A bridge was built over the Gooseberry near the falls in 1922 to service Minnesota State Highway 61, the only highway to Canada along the North Shore. The original bridge, Bridge no. 3585, was built by the Illinois Steel Bridge Company. It was expanded to include a third arch so as to widen the road in 1937. In 1990 a decision was made to replace the deteriorating bridge with another arch bridge evocative of the original. This replacement bridge, #38010, was inspected after the collapse of the 35W Mississippi River bridge in 2007 due to design similarities. No critical deficiencies were found. The original truss bridge had an arch of 150 feet, and the modern bridge has an arch of 154 feet. The region around the falls was placed under protection by the legislature in 1933, and in 1934 the Civilian Conservation Corps began developing this land into what would become Gooseberry Falls State Park, which opened in 1937. Emergency CCC Camp #1720 operated from May to October 1934, and CCC Camp #2710 operated from July 1934 to May 1941, building more than 80 structures in the park's distinctive style. The park now receives over six hundred thousand visits annually.

In the Anglican Communion, there is no single \\"Order of St Augustine\\", but a number of Augustinian congregations of sisters living according to the Rule of St Augustine. Rule Although Augustine of Hippo probably did not compose a formal monastic rule (despite the extant Augustinian Rule), his hortatory letter to the nuns at Hippo Regius (Epist., ccxi, Benedictine ed.) is the most ancient example on which the beginnings of this Augustinian Rule are based. The nuns regard as their first foundation the monastery for which St Augustine wrote the rules of life in his Epistola ccxi (alias cix) in 423. It is certain that at an early date this epistle was called the Rule of St Augustine for nuns and that it has been followed as the rule of life in many female monasteries. There has been a long tradition of independence within the Augustinian movement and this has led to differences in rule, dress, and mode of life between different Augustinian congregations.

Holley and Thomas M. Liggett in 1975. voter model coexists on the graph with two clusters One can imagine that there is a \\"voter\\" at each point on a connected graph, where the connections indicate that there is some form of interaction between a pair of voters (nodes). The opinions of any given voter on some issue changes at random times under the influence of opinions of his neighbours. A voter's opinion at any given time can take one of two values, labelled 0 and 1. At random times, a random individual is selected and that voter's opinion is changed according to a stochastic rule. Specifically, for one of the chosen voter's neighbors is chosen according to a given set of probabilities and that individual's opinion is transferred to the chosen voter. An alternative interpretation is in terms of spatial conflict. Suppose two nations control the areas (sets of nodes) labelled 0 or 1. A flip from 0 to 1 at a given location indicates an invasion of that site by the other nation. Note that only one flip happens each time. Problems involving the voter model will often be recast in terms of the dual system of coalescing Markov chains. Frequently, these problems will then be reduced to others involving independent Markov chains. Definition A voter model is a (continuous time) Markov process \\\\eta_t with state space S=\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^{Z^d} and transition rates function c(x,\\\\eta) , where Z^d is a d-dimensional integer lattice, and c( ‚Ä¢,‚Ä¢ ) is assumed to be nonnegative, uniformly bounded and continuous as a function of \\\\eta in the product topology on S . Each component \\\\eta \\\\in S is called a configuration. To make it clear that \\\\eta(x) stands for the value of a site x in configuration \\\\eta(.) ; while \\\\eta_t(x) means the value of a site x in configuration \\\\eta(.) at time t. The dynamic of the process are specified by the collection of transition rates. For voter models, the rate at which there is a flip at \\\\scriptstyle x from 0 to 1 or vice versa is given by a function c(x,\\\\eta) of site x . It has the following properties: # c(x,\\\\eta)=0 for every x \\\\in Z^d if \\\\eta \\\\equiv 0 or if \\\\eta \\\\equiv 1 # c(x,\\\\eta)=c(x,\\\\zeta) for every x \\\\in Z^d if \\\\eta(y)+\\\\zeta(y)=1 for all y \\\\in Z^d # c(x,\\\\eta)\\\\leq c(x,\\\\zeta) if \\\\eta\\\\leq \\\\zeta and \\\\eta(x)=\\\\zeta(x)=0 # c(x,\\\\eta) is invariant under shifts in \\\\scriptstyle Z^d Property (1) says that \\\\eta\\\\equiv 0 and \\\\eta\\\\equiv 1 are fixed points for the evolution. (2) indicates that the evolution is unchanged by interchanging the roles of 0's and 1's. In property (3), \\\\eta\\\\leq \\\\zeta means \\\\forall x,\\\\eta(x)\\\\leq\\\\zeta(x) , and \\\\eta \\\\leq \\\\zeta implies c(x,\\\\eta)\\\\leq c(x,\\\\zeta) if \\\\eta(x)=\\\\zeta(x)=0 , and implies c(x,\\\\eta)\\\\geq c(x,\\\\zeta) if \\\\eta(x)=\\\\zeta(x)=1 . Clustering and coexistence What we are interested in is the limiting behavior of the models. Since the flip rates of a site depends its neighbours, it is obvious that when all sites take the same value, the whole system stops changing forever. Therefore, a voter model has two trivial extremal stationary distributions, the point-masses \\\\scriptstyle \\\\delta_0 and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\delta_1 on \\\\scriptstyle \\\\eta \\\\equiv 0 or \\\\scriptstyle \\\\eta\\\\equiv 1 respectively, which represent consensus. The main question we will discuss is whether or not there are others, which would then represent coexistence of different opinions in equilibrium. We say that coexistence occurs if there is a stationary distribution that concentrates on configurations with infinitely many 0's and 1's. On the other hand, if for all \\\\scriptstyle x,y\\\\in Z^d and all initial configurations, we have: : \\\\lim_{t\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}P[\\\\eta_t(x) eq\\\\eta_t(y)]=0 we will say that clustering occurs. It is important to distinguish clustering with the concept of cluster. Clusters are defined to be the connected components of \\\\scriptstyle \\\\\\\\{x:\\\\eta(x)=0\\\\\\\\} or \\\\scriptstyle \\\\\\\\{x:\\\\eta(x)=1\\\\\\\\}. The linear voter model=Model description This section will be dedicated to one of the basic voter models, the Linear Voter Model. Let \\\\scriptstyle p( ‚Ä¢,‚Ä¢\\\\scriptstyle ) be the transition probabilities for an irreducible random walk on \\\\scriptstyle Z^d ,and we have: : p(x,y)\\\\geq 0 \\\\quad\\\\text{and} \\\\sum_{y}p(x,y)=1 Then in Linear voter model, the transition rates are linear functions of \\\\scriptstyle \\\\eta : : c(x,\\\\eta)= \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{array}{l} \\\\sum_y p(x,y)\\\\eta(y) \\\\quad \\\\text{for all}\\\\quad \\\\eta(x)=0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sum_y p(x,y)(1-\\\\eta(y)) \\\\quad \\\\text{for all}\\\\quad \\\\eta(x)=1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right. Or if we use \\\\scriptstyle \\\\eta_x to indicate that a flip happens at site \\\\scriptstyle x, the transition rates are simply: : \\\\eta\\\\rightarrow\\\\eta_x \\\\quad\\\\text{at rate} \\\\sum_{y:\\\\eta(y) eq\\\\eta(x)}p(x,y). We define a process of coalescing random walks \\\\scriptstyle A_t\\\\subset Z^d as follows. Here \\\\scriptstyle A_t denotes the set of sites occupied by these random walks at time \\\\scriptstyle t . To define \\\\scriptstyle A_t , consider several (continuous time) random walks on \\\\scriptstyle Z^d with unit exponential holding times and transition probabilities \\\\scriptstyle p( ‚Ä¢,‚Ä¢\\\\scriptstyle ) , and take them to be independent until two of them meet. At that time, the two that meet coalesce into one particle, which continues to move like a random walk with transition probabilities \\\\scriptstyle p( ‚Ä¢,‚Ä¢\\\\scriptstyle ) . The concept of Duality is essential for analysing the behavior of the voter models. The linear voter models satisfy a very useful form of duality, known as coalescing duality, which is: : P^\\\\eta(\\\\eta_t\\\\equiv 1 \\\\quad\\\\text{on }A)=P^A(\\\\eta(A_t)\\\\equiv 1), where \\\\scriptstyle \\\\eta \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^{Z^d} is the initial configuration of \\\\scriptstyle \\\\eta_t and \\\\scriptstyle A=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in Z^d, \\\\eta(x)=1\\\\\\\\}\\\\subset Z^d is the initial state of the coalescing random walks \\\\scriptstyle A_t. Limiting behaviors of linear voter models Let \\\\scriptstyle p(x,y) be the transition probabilities for an irreducible random walk on \\\\scriptstyle Z^d and \\\\scriptstyle p(x,y)=p(0,x-y) , then the duality relation for such linear voter models says that \\\\scriptstyle \\\\forall\\\\eta\\\\in S=\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^{Z^d} : P^{\\\\eta}[\\\\eta_t(x) eq\\\\eta_t(y)]=P[\\\\eta(X_t) eq\\\\eta(Y_t)] where \\\\scriptstyle X_t and \\\\scriptstyle Y_t are (continuous time) random walks on \\\\scriptstyle Z^d with \\\\scriptstyle X_0=x , \\\\scriptstyle Y_0=y , and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\eta(X_t) is the position taken by the random walk at time \\\\scriptstyle t . \\\\scriptstyle X_t and \\\\scriptstyle Y_t forms a coalescing random walks described at the end of section 2.1. \\\\scriptstyle X(t)-Y(t) is a symmetrized random walk. If \\\\scriptstyle X(t)-Y(t) is recurrent and \\\\scriptstyle d\\\\leq 2 , \\\\scriptstyle X_t and \\\\scriptstyle Y_t will hit eventually with probability 1, and hence : P^{\\\\eta}[\\\\eta_t(x) eq\\\\eta_t(y)]=P[\\\\eta(X_t) eq\\\\eta(Y_t)]\\\\leq P[X_t eq Y_t]\\\\rightarrow 0\\\\quad\\\\text{as}\\\\quad t\\\\to 0 Therefore, the process clusters. On the other hand, when d\\\\geq 3 , the system coexists. It is because for \\\\scriptstyle d\\\\geq 3 , \\\\scriptstyle X(t)-Y(t) is transient, thus there is a positive probability that the random walks never hit, and hence for \\\\scriptstyle x eq y : \\\\lim_{t\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}P[\\\\eta_t(x) eq\\\\eta_t(y)]=C\\\\lim_{t\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}P[X_t eq Y_t]>0 for some constant C corresponding to the initial distribution. Now let \\\\scriptstyle \\\\tilde{X}(t)=X(t)-Y(t) be a symmetrized random walk, we have the following theorems: Theorem 2.1 The linear voter model \\\\scriptstyle \\\\eta_t clusters if \\\\scriptstyle \\\\tilde{X}_t is recurrent, and coexists if \\\\scriptstyle \\\\tilde{X}_t is transient. In particular, # the process clusters if \\\\scriptstyle d=1 and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\sum_x xp(0,x)\\\\le \\\\infty , or if \\\\scriptstyle d=2 and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\sum_x x^2p(0,x)\\\\le\\\\infty ; # the process coexists if \\\\scriptstyle d \\\\geq 3 . Remarks: To contrast this with the behavior of the threshold voter models that will be discussed in next section, note that whether the linear voter model clusters or coexists depends almost exclusively on the dimension of the set of sites, rather than on the size of the range of interaction. Theorem 2.2 Suppose \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mu is any translation spatially ergodic and invariant probability measure on the state space \\\\scriptstyle S=\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^{Z^d} , then # If \\\\scriptstyle \\\\tilde{X}_t is recurrent, then \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mu S(t)\\\\Rightarrow \\\\rho\\\\delta_1+(1-\\\\rho)\\\\delta_0\\\\quad\\\\text{as}\\\\quad t\\\\to\\\\infty ; # If \\\\scriptstyle \\\\tilde{X}_t is transient, then \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mu S(t)\\\\Rightarrow \\\\mu_\\\\rho . where \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mu S(t) is the distribution of \\\\scriptstyle \\\\eta_t ; \\\\scriptstyle \\\\Rightarrow means weak convergence, \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mu_{\\\\rho} is a nontrivial extremal invariant measure and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\rho=\\\\mu(\\\\\\\\{\\\\eta:\\\\eta(x)=1\\\\\\\\}) . A special linear voter model One of the interesting special cases of the linear voter model, known as the basic linear voter model, is that for state space \\\\scriptstyle \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^{Z^d}: : p(x,y)= \\\\begin{cases} 1/2d & \\\\text{if } x-y=1 \\\\text{ and } \\\\eta(x) eq\\\\eta(y) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] 0 & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} So that : \\\\eta_t(x)\\\\to 1-\\\\eta_t(x)\\\\quad\\\\text{at rate}\\\\quad (2d)^{-1}\\\\\\\\{y:y-x=1,\\\\eta_t(y) eq\\\\eta_t(x)\\\\\\\\} In this case, the process clusters if \\\\scriptstyle d\\\\leq 2 , while coexists if \\\\scriptstyle d\\\\geq 3 . This dichotomy is closely related to the fact that simple random walk on \\\\scriptstyle Z^d is recurrent if \\\\scriptstyle d\\\\leq2 and transient if \\\\scriptstyle d\\\\geq 3 . =Clusters in one dimension d = 1= For the special case with \\\\scriptstyle d=1 , \\\\scriptstyle S=Z^1 and \\\\scriptstyle p(x,x+1)=p(x,x-1)=\\\\frac{1}{2} for each \\\\scriptstyle x . We know from Theorem 2.2 that \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mu S(t)\\\\Rightarrow \\\\rho\\\\delta_1+(1-\\\\rho)\\\\delta_0 , thus clustering occurs in this case. The aim of this section is to give a more precise description of this clustering. As mentioned before, clusters of an \\\\scriptstyle \\\\eta are defined to be the connected components of \\\\scriptstyle \\\\\\\\{x:\\\\eta(x)=0\\\\\\\\} or \\\\scriptstyle \\\\\\\\{x:\\\\eta(x)=1\\\\\\\\} . The mean cluster size for \\\\scriptstyle \\\\eta is defined to be: : C(\\\\eta)=\\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}\\\\frac{2n}{\\\\text{number of clusters in} [-n,n]} provided the limit exists. Proposition 2.3 Suppose the voter model is with initial distribution \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mu and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mu is a translation invariant probability measure, then : P\\\\left(C(\\\\eta)=\\\\frac{1}{P[\\\\eta_t(0) eq \\\\eta_t(1)]}\\\\right)=1. =Occupation time= Define the occupation time functionals of the basic linear voter model as: : T_t^x=\\\\int_0^t \\\\eta^\\\\rho_s(x)\\\\mathrm{d}s. Theorem 2.4 Assume that for all site x and time t, \\\\scriptstyle P(\\\\eta_t(x)=1)=\\\\rho, then as \\\\scriptstyle t\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty , \\\\scriptstyle T_t^x/t\\\\rightarrow \\\\rho almost surely if \\\\scriptstyle d\\\\geq 2 proof By Chebyshev's inequality and the Borel‚ÄìCantelli lemma, we can get the equation below: : P\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\rho}{r}\\\\leq \\\\lim \\\\inf_{t\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}\\\\frac{T_t}{t}\\\\leq\\\\lim\\\\sup_{t\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}\\\\frac{T_t}{t}\\\\leq \\\\rho r\\\\right)=1; \\\\quad\\\\forall r>1 The theorem follows when letting \\\\scriptstyle r\\\\searrow 1 . The threshold voter model=Model description In this section, we will concentrate on a kind of non-linear voter models, known as the threshold voter model. To define it, let \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathcal{N} be a neighbourhood of \\\\scriptstyle 0\\\\in Z^d that is obtained by intersecting \\\\scriptstyle Z^d with any compact, convex, symmetric set in \\\\scriptstyle R^d ; in other word, \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathcal{N} is assumed to be a finite set that is symmetric with respect to all reflections and irreducible (i.e. the group it generates is \\\\scriptstyle Z^d )We will always assume that \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathcal{N} contains all the unit vectors \\\\scriptstyle (1,0,0,\\\\dots,0),\\\\dots,(0,\\\\dots,0,1) . For a positive integer \\\\scriptstyle T , the threshold voter model with neighbourhood \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathcal{N} and threshold \\\\scriptstyle T is the one with rate function: : c(x,\\\\eta)= \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{array}{l} 1 \\\\quad \\\\text{if}\\\\quad \\\\\\\\{y\\\\in x+\\\\mathcal{N}:\\\\eta(y) eq\\\\eta(x)\\\\\\\\}\\\\geq T \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\quad \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right. Simply put, the transition rate of site \\\\scriptstyle x is 1 if the number of sites that do not take the same value is larger or equal to the threshold T. Otherwise, site \\\\scriptstyle x stays at the current status and will not flip. For example, if \\\\scriptstyle d=1 , \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathcal{N}=\\\\\\\\{-1,0,1\\\\\\\\} and \\\\scriptstyle T=2 , then the configuration \\\\scriptstyle \\\\dots1\\\\quad 1\\\\quad 0\\\\quad 0\\\\quad 1\\\\quad 1\\\\quad 0\\\\quad 0\\\\dots is an absorbing state or a trap for the process. Limiting behaviors of threshold voter model If a threshold voter model does not fixate, we should expect that the process will coexist for small threshold and cluster for large threshold, where large and small are interpreted as being relative to the size of the neighbourhood, \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathcal{N} . The intuition is that having a small threshold makes it easy for flips to occur, so it is likely that there will be a lot of both 0's and 1's around at all times. The following are three major results: # If \\\\scriptstyle T>\\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{N}-1}{2} , then the process fixates in the sense that each site flips only finitely often. # If \\\\scriptstyle d=1 and \\\\scriptstyle T=\\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{N}-1}{2} , then the process clusters. # If \\\\scriptstyle T=\\\\theta\\\\mathcal{N} with \\\\scriptstyle \\\\theta sufficiently small(\\\\scriptstyle \\\\theta<\\\\frac{1}{4} ) and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathcal{N} sufficiently large, then the process coexists. Here are two theorems corresponding to properties (1) and (2). Theorem 3.1 If \\\\scriptstyle T>\\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{N}-1}{2} , then the process fixates. Theorem 3.2 The threshold voter model in one dimension (\\\\scriptstyle d=1 ) with \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathcal{N}=\\\\\\\\{-T,\\\\dots,T\\\\\\\\}, T\\\\geq 1 , clusters. proof The idea of the proof is to construct two sequences of random times \\\\scriptstyle U_n , \\\\scriptstyle V_n for \\\\scriptstyle n\\\\geq 1 with the following properties: # \\\\scriptstyle 0=V_0, # \\\\scriptstyle \\\\\\\\{U_{k+1}-V_k,k\\\\geq0\\\\\\\\} are i.i.d.with \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathrm{E}(U_{k+1}-V_k)<\\\\infty , # \\\\scriptstyle \\\\\\\\{V_{k}-U_k,k\\\\geq1\\\\\\\\} are i.i.d.with \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathrm{E}(V_{k}-U_k)=\\\\infty , # the random variables in (b) and (c) are independent of each other, # event A=\\\\scriptstyle \\\\\\\\{\\\\eta_t(.) is constant on \\\\scriptstyle \\\\\\\\{-T,\\\\dots,T\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\} , and event A holds for every \\\\scriptstyle t \\\\in \\\\cup_{k=1}^\\\\infty [U_k,V_k] . Once this construction is made, it will follow from renewal theory that : P(A)\\\\geq P(t \\\\in \\\\cup_{k=1}^\\\\infty [U_k,V_k])\\\\to 1 \\\\quad\\\\text{as}\\\\quad t\\\\to\\\\infty Hence,\\\\scriptstyle \\\\lim_{t\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}P(\\\\eta_t(1) eq \\\\eta_t(0))=0 , so that the process clusters. Remarks: (a) Threshold models in higher dimensions do not necessarily cluster if \\\\scriptstyle T=\\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{N}-1}{2} . For example, take \\\\scriptstyle d=2,T=2 and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathcal{N}=\\\\\\\\{(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)\\\\\\\\} . If \\\\scriptstyle \\\\eta is constant on alternating vertical infinite strips,that is for all \\\\scriptstyle i,j : : \\\\eta(4i,j)=\\\\eta(4i+1,j)=1,\\\\quad \\\\eta(4i+2,j)=\\\\eta(4i+3,j)=0 then no transition ever occur, and the process fixates. (b) Under the assumption of Theorem 3.2, the process does not fixate. To see this, consider the initial configuration \\\\scriptstyle \\\\dots 0 0 0 1 1 1 \\\\dots , in which infinitely many zeros are followed by infinitely many ones. Then only the zero and one at the boundary can flip, so that the configuration will always look the same except that the boundary will move like a simple symmetric random walk. The fact that this random walk is recurrent implies that every site flips infinitely often. Property 3 indicates that the threshold voter model is quite different from the linear voter model, in that coexistence occurs even in one dimension, provided that the neighbourhood is not too small. The threshold model has a drift toward the \\"local minority\\", which is not present in the linear case. Most proofs of coexistence for threshold voter models are based on comparisons with hybrid model known as the threshold contact process with parameter \\\\scriptstyle \\\\lambda>0 . This is the process on \\\\scriptstyle [0,1]^{Z^d} with flip rates: : c(x,\\\\eta)= \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{array}{l} \\\\lambda \\\\quad \\\\text{if}\\\\quad\\\\eta(x)=0\\\\quad \\\\text{and}\\\\\\\\{y\\\\in x+\\\\mathcal{N}:\\\\eta(y)=1\\\\\\\\}\\\\geq T; \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\quad \\\\text{if}\\\\quad \\\\eta(x)=1;\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\quad \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{array}\\\\right. Proposition 3.3 For any \\\\scriptstyle d, \\\\mathcal{N} and \\\\scriptstyle T , if the threshold contact process with \\\\scriptstyle \\\\lambda=1 has a nontrivial invariant measure, then the threshold voter model coexists. Model with threshold T = 1 The case that \\\\scriptstyle T=1 is of particular interest because it is the only case in which we currently know exactly which models coexist and which models cluster. In particular, we are interested in a kind of Threshold T=1 model with \\\\scriptstyle c(x,\\\\eta) that is given by: : c(x,\\\\eta)= \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{array}{l} 1 \\\\quad\\\\text{if exists one}\\\\quad y \\\\quad\\\\text{with}\\\\quad x-y\\\\leq N \\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad \\\\eta(x) eq\\\\eta(y) \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\quad \\\\text{otherwise}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right. \\\\scriptstyle N can be interpreted as the radius of the neighbourhood \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathcal{N} ; \\\\scriptstyle N determines the size of the neighbourhood (i.e., if \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathcal{N}_1=\\\\\\\\{-2,-1,0,1,2\\\\\\\\} , then \\\\scriptstyle N_1=2 ; while for \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathcal{N}_2=\\\\\\\\{(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)\\\\\\\\} , the corresponding \\\\scriptstyle N_2=1 ). By Theorem 3.2, the model with \\\\scriptstyle d=1 and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathcal{N}=\\\\\\\\{-1,0,1\\\\\\\\} clusters. The following theorem indicates that for all other choices of \\\\scriptstyle d and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathcal{N} , the model coexists. Theorem 3.4 Suppose that \\\\scriptstyle N\\\\geq 1 , but \\\\scriptstyle (N,d) eq(1,1) . Then the threshold model on \\\\scriptstyle Z^d with parameter \\\\scriptstyle N coexists. The proof of this theorem is given in a paper named \\"Coexistence in threshold voter models\\" by Thomas M. Liggett.

Both hurling and Gaelic football are played in the \\"Mid- Tipperary\\" divisional competitions. The club is centred on the town of Thurles and its hinterland and is a combination of three clubs: Thurles Kickhams, Rahealty and Thurles Fennellys. The club was formed in 2005 under the name \\"Thurles KRF\\" it later changed its name to \\"Thurles Gaels\\" in 2009. In 2006 the decision was made to start a Juvenile Club, to guarantee the club's future. With success hard to come by for its senior players, the same cannot be said for their Juvenile teams who have fared much better. Juvenile Club With strong competition in Mid-Tipperary, Thurles Gaels found the early years tough it took a lot of heart to stick with it. It would take a couple of years and hard work before Thurles Gaels were to gain their first under age title. In 2008 an under 14 \\"C\\" Mid football final replay against Clonakenny, finally put Thurles Gaels on the map. On a wet evening in Clonmore, a team performance, full of skill and determined play, was dully rewarded. The team rightly has its place in history with the honour of bringing the first title to this young club. Gaels have since won three more Under 14 \\"C\\" football titles, with the latest coming in 2014. One of the stand out days has to be the 2012 victory over local rivals Durlas √ìg in a pulsating game, behind on the scoreboard with three minutes on the clock, Thurles Gaels turned heartbreak to sheer delight, scoring 1.01 to win by a point, a day never to be forgotten. This memory will however have to give way to what came two years later, in 2014. After heartache in the 2012 County semi-final, the club reached its first on-field County Final. After defeating Upperchurch/Drombane in the Mid final, the club got a bye into the final where they faced St. Patricks. The final was the first of three that day; none would match this one for excitement and drama. The teams were level at half and full-time, extra- time was needed. Thurles Gaels showed real character, they got crucial scores and never looked in trouble. Relief & jubilation quickly spread across the field on hearing the final whistle, this team had come full circle, the first game of the year was a disaster, they couldn't score to the final where they couldn't stop scoring. Hurling titles in Mid Tipperary (the home of hurling) are a lot harder to come by. Having come close on a few occasions, history was made in the Ragg, when Thurles Gaels Under 12 \\"C\\" defeated Durlas √ìg 3.5 to 3.2. In 2013 Thurles Gaels won its first under-16 \\"C\\" football title. Clonakenny were again the opposition and the final promised much after a tight round robin match, earlier in the year. It was a nervous first half with Gaels going in just a point ahead and the game was in the mix right up the final five minutes. When Gaels with some well taken points from distance putting four points between the teams. The four points scored by Clonakenny didn't reflect they work they put in, but the five-point victory was deserved.

An ion-to- photon detector (IPD) is a component used for detecting ions in mass spectrometry. Operation In an ion-to-photon detector, a photomultiplier tube is coated with a layer of scintillator compound, such as Rhodamine B or CsI. When the ions pass through the mass analyzer of the spectrometer, they strike the scintillator compound and cause the release of photons. These photons are then detected by the photomultiplier tube. A conversion dynode, such as a microchannel plate can also be used between the ion beam and the scintillator to increase the signal. An MCP, when struck by an ion, will release electrons which then strike the scintillator. Applications The primary application for ion-to-photon detectors is acting as the detector in MALDI mass spectrometry. They could, in theory, be used for other types of mass spectrometry as well. Comparison to other detectors The conversion efficiency of ions to photons by an IPD is as good as, or better than, the conversion efficiency of ions to electrons by a multichannel plate detector. Ion-to-photon detectors may also detect ions with a mass of up to around 20,000 Da, better than microchannel plates. However, the resolution of the mass spectrum from an IPD equipped spectrometer is slightly lower. The noise in the spectrum, which may come from unfocused, slow speed ions, is also slightly higher.

The M.F.6 was designed and employed as a trainer aircraft. The type was the last pusher configuration aircraft in service with the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service. The M.F.6 functioned as a makeshift solution until a more modern tractor configuration aircraft could be built. The type was retired once a more permanent solution to the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service's training needs was found in mid-1920s. Design and development In the early 1920s the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service discovered that its main trainer type, the Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.4, suffered from weaknesses in the wings. Initially requests for new aircraft were dismissed by the Ministry of Defence, but following the loss of one M.F.4 permission was granted for the construction of two Farman type pusher aircraft as an emergency solution. The Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.6 was the last Maurice Farman type built for the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service, as well as the service's last pusher type.Hafsten and Arheim 2003, p. 100Arheim 1994, p. 9 The M.F.6 was powered by a Beardmore 160 hp engine, imported from the United Kingdom.Hafsten and Arheim 2003, pp. 218-219Meyer 1977, p. 51 Concurrently with the construction of the M.F.6 another interim aircraft type was designed by Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk for the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service, the tractor configuration type Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.7. Operational history One M.F.6 (F.10 (IV)) was delivered from Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk in 1921, and a second (F.4 (IV))in 1922. F.10 (IV) had its first flight on 30 April 1921, followed by F.4 (IV) on 16 June 1922. The type served until replaced by the much more modern Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.8 in the mid-1920s. F.10 (IV) was discarded in 1926 and F.4 (IV) in May 1927, following the 1924 introduction of the M.F.8. By the time of retirement, F.10 (IV) had flown for 439 hours and 50 minutes, while F.4 (IV) had flown for 333 hours and 50 minutes.

The film features a series of vignettes involving Manson's character cutting women's hair, a doctor inserting an eyeball into a woman's vagina, and characters reciting passages from William Shakespeare's Macbeth. Born Villain is sound-tracked by the Marilyn Manson song \\"Overneath the Path of Misery\\". A promotional trailer for the album of the same name (2012), Born Villain was conceived of after Manson and LaBeouf became friends at a concert by The Kills. In crafting the film, the duo drew inspiration from theology, Macbeth, and the films Un Chien Andalou (1929) and The Holy Mountain (1973). The short premiered at the L.A. Silent Theater on August 28, 2011; the screening could only be attended by people who had purchased copies of Campaign, a limited edition book by Manson, LaBeouf and Karolyn Pho. Upon release, the short received mixed reviews from critics. Some praised its power to disturb, while others found it dull. Born Villain has been made available for purchase on DVD.  Background and development The idea for the film originated after Marilyn Manson and Shia LaBeouf struck up a friendship at a concert by The Kills. The actor said that he found the singer \\"frightening\\" as a teenager, and that he had \\"always been intrigued\\" by his band's work. LaBeouf offered to direct Manson's next music video; in order to convince him he was a competent director, LaBeouf screened for Manson his directorial collaboration with American rappers Kid Cudi and Cage, Maniac (2011). Impressed, Manson then commissioned LaBeouf to create a video for the band. LaBeouf further expanded upon the project's genesis in an interview on Live with Regis and Kelly, saying that he went to see Manson at his home in West Hollywood, California, which LaBeouf described as a large movie theater where Manson spends much of his time viewing films. LaBeouf said that he and Manson watched several films together there, and discussed the \\"really eccentric ideas\\" they had for their video collaboration. LaBeouf financed the film himself. It was inspired by William Shakespeare's Macbeth, Salvador Dal√≠ and Luis Bu√±uel's surrealist short film Un Chien Andalou (1929), Alejandro Jodorowsky's The Holy Mountain (1973), and what LaBeouf described as \\"heavy theology.\\" Laney Chantal, the wife of Marilyn Manson member Twiggy Ramirez, served as the makeup artist for the short. Manson thought of the title Born Villain after telling someone \\"Gentlemen prefer blondes...but I'm a villain.\\" The short's title was also inspired by the fact that all of Manson's favorite characters from literature and cinema are villains. In an interview with Revolver, Manson said that his use of a Macbeth quote within Born Villain ‚Äì \\"Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing\\" ‚Äì could be understood as a mockery of LaBeouf, though this was unintentional. He added that he was unsure if LaBeouf was aware that the film could be seen as insulting him. In the same interview, Manson said that part of the reason he made Born Villain was because he viewed traditional music videos as \\"pointless\\", due to the decline of MTV. On August 17, 2011, Fred Sablan, who appears in the film and also performs bass guitar on the parent album, leaked the film's official website on his Twitter blog; the website additionally announced the project's release date. Marilyn Manson drummer Chris Vrenna said that Born Villain contains short clips from the parent album, as well as its own score. The song \\"Overneath the Path of Misery\\" from the album was used in the film. Via MarilynManson.com, the band's frontman explained his intentions in creating the short: LaBeouf told MTV News that he enjoyed making the film, and that he would be unfazed if people who became fans of his through his role in Holes (2003) did not appreciate Born Villain, explaining: \\"I don't think my audience is the only thing I should exercise my artistic muscle for. I don't necessarily always do things for the audience; this is one of those.\\" Mallika Rao of HuffPost said that Born Villain served as a trailer for the album of the same name. Synopsis The film repeatedly quotes Macbeth by William Shakespeare. Born Villain begins with a man (played by Marilyn Manson) cutting a pair of nude women's hair until they are bald. The movie then depicts an underage boy in white face makeup sitting next to an elderly man on a couch, who starts caressing the child's thigh. The man and boy begin physically fighting, after which Manson's character recites part of the \\"Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow\\" soliloquy from Macbeth, as the two women with shaved heads stand behind him. A group of masked people, two of them wearing Nazi uniforms, applaud his recitation. Manson's character then watches a blindfolded man and woman have anal sex in a glass cage, followed by a scene in which a woman fails in an attempt to shoot an apple off a man's head; she instead shoots him in the eye. The dismembered eyeball, which is still fully intact, is handed to the woman. Another woman recites Lady Macbeth's plea of \\"Come, you spirits, that tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here\\". She is then seen kissing a man with no legs, and is applauded by a pair of topless blindfolded women. Manson's character is shown forcing a long, thin knife through a woman's cheek, before he combusts as he blows out a candle. Apparently unharmed, he reappears as a doctor dressed in medical garb, and removes an eyeball from his mouth and inserts it into a woman's vagina. He then says \\"The wages of sin is death\\", before forcing a gun attached to a crucifix into the mouth of the man who molested the boy in white face makeup. As the man screams, the boy smiles, and Manson's character pulls the trigger. Facing the corpse, Manson's character quotes Macbeth: \\"Nothing in his life. Became him like the leaving it.\\" He sits on a chair next to the legless man and a lion, before the film fades to black. Release Campaign is a limited edition book by Shia LaBeouf (photographer), Karolyn Pho (photographer) and Marilyn Manson, which serves as a visual accompaniment to the film. Campaign was released in August 2011 by LaBeouf's Grassy Slope Entertainment, Inc., alongside DVD copies of the film. MTV reported that Manson and LaBeouf would appear at Los Angeles's Hennessey + Ingalls bookstore to sign copies of the book and screen the short. Attendance of the event was limited to 150 people over the age of eighteen, who were required to buy a copy of the book. Copies of Campaign were sold for $75 and featured of photographs of graffiti and cut-outs of LaBeouf and Pho placed around Los Angeles. The film had its premiered at the L.A. Silent Theater on August 28, 2011; the premiere was attended by actors Jon Hamm and Billy Zane. The short was later screened at Space 15 Twenty in Los Angeles, with entry guaranteed exclusively to those who purchased the book. Born Villain was also screened at the Studio Servitu in Los Angeles, a club co-owned by Miss Crash, a fetish model who appears in the film. The short was screened there as part of an art show where Manson debuted songs from the album Born Villain, Ramirez performed a DJ set, and artist Nick Kurshner displayed some of his paintings, including a portrait of Manson painted in the artist's blood. Critical reception and analysis Critics praised Manson's continued ability to disturb audiences. Upon its release, several critics praised its power to disturb. Loudwire Joe Robinson called the short \\"the most interesting, challenging and envelope- pushing video Manson has made in a decade. It also may be his most disturbing, so watch at you own risk.\\" Writing in Spin, Kevin O'Donnell said that Born Villain \\"proves the shock-rocker has not lost his ability to freak fans out\\" and is \\"sicker than ever,\\" adding that the scene \\"where Manson pokes a needle into a woman‚Äôs cheek, might be the sickest thing ever captured in a music video. And the execution at the end is just plain terrifying.\\" Lina Lecaro of LA Weekly felt that through the \\"arty, dramatic, salacious, [and] depraved\\" film Manson \\"reaffirms his 'shock rocker' status,\\" though she was unsure of its meaning. For Billboard, RJ Cubarrubia reacted to the video by saying \\"Good news: Marilyn Manson is still terrifying\\". Some critics praised LaBeouf's abilities as a director. Amos Barshad of Grantland praised LaBeouf for his \\"directorial chops\\" and for crafting a \\"effectively, overwhelmingly gross\\" film. Barshad felt that Born Villains use of the Macbeth quote \\"[It] is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury. It signifies [sic] nothing\\" meant that the short was meaningless. The Chicago Reader Miles Raymer said that \\"Born Villain is pretentious garbage, and it's fantastic....I think LeBeouf [sic] just might have what it takes to be a great B-movie filmmaker. This thing is so big and overwrought and blind to its own ridiculousness that it does what all great exploitation movies do, which is to go past being so bad that it's good to become something so bad that it's art.\\" Raymer also liked Born Villain better than Maniac. Other critics were less impressed. In Consequence of Sound, Chris Coplan found Born Villains visuals too similar to the singer's previous work. MetalSucks' Axl Rosenberg criticized the film's appropriation of pre-existing sources, feeling that Macbeth is unrelated to Un Chien Andalou, a film which he considered far superior to Born Villain. Rosenberg further asserted that Manson did not understand the \\"Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow\\" soliloquy. Max Feldman of PopMatters wrote that by collaborating with LaBeouf for the short and Johnny Depp for his band's cover of Carly Simon's \\"You're So Vain\\" (1972), Manson is feeding the consumerism and celebrity culture he used to criticize. IndieWire's Kevin Jagernauth and Metal Injections Robert Pasbani dismissed the video as boring, with the former criticizing its music and the latter jokingly telling LaBeouf and Manson to commit suicide due to the short's poor quality.

The British captured her off Antigua in 1795 and she served briefly in the Royal Navy in the West Indies, where she captured a French privateer, before being broken up in 1798. French service and capture In April 1786 Perdrix was holed by a rock when she arrived at Tobago. She was refloated and repaired there between April and July.}} Between 14 February and 2 May 1791, Perdrix was under the command of Lieutenant de vaisseaux Duval-Paris. He sailed her from Brest to Cadiz, and then on to Martinique and Cap-Fran√ßais, carrying payroll.Fonds, Vol. 1, p.26. In December 1792 she sailed to the assistance of the frigate Didon, which had foundered before Pointe-√†-Pitre. From there Perdrix returned to Fort-Royal. She then sailed back to France, sailing from Rochefort to Brest, via La Corogne. On 4 December 1792 sous-lieutenant de vaisseaux Krohm took command, with Duval-Paris being promoted to capitaine de vaisseau the next day.Fonds , Vol. 1, p.36. Perdrix cruised to the south of Belle √éle, then was at Rochefort, before cruising along the coasts of la Vend√©e. Next she sailed from Rochefort to Mindin (Opposite to Saint-Nazaire). Lastly, she sailed on a mission to Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon. During this period she had several commanders. From 26 February to 24 April 1793 her commander was capitaine de vaisseau Renaudin. His successor was enseigne de vaisseau non entretenu Garreau (temporarily until 20 May 1793), and nominally between 26 February and 22 July, lieutenant de vaisseau Barr√©,Fonds, Vol. 1, p. 45. though Barr√© may not have assumed command until 14 May.Fonds, Vol. 1, p.46. Barr√©, who continued in command until 28 November 1794, sailed Perdrix from Paimb≈ìuf to Nova Scotia and then to New York. He was on the United States station, where he convoyed vessels from Sandy Hook to Cape Henlopen and into the Atlantic. In June 1794, Perdrix was perhaps temporarily under the command of Lieutenant de vaiseaux Le Bouteiller.Fonds, Vol. 1, pp.82-3. Rear-Admiral Thompson, in , returned to Martinique on 13 June 1795, after seeing a convoy in safety to 24 Deg. 8 Min North. On his way back, on 5 June he captured Perdrix, a \\"French Ship of War of 24 Guns.\\" She was under the command of Lieutenant de vaisseau Le Bouteiller.Fonds, Vol. 1, p. 140 British service The British commissioned Perdrix on 2 February 1796 under the command of Captain William Charles Fahie. At some point between 18 March 1797 and 30 May, Perdrix recaptured the sloop General, H. Bloombury, Master, from Barbados. She had been sailing to Martinique with a cargo of dry goods and provisions. Perdrix recaptured her off Guadaloupe and sent her to Fort Royal, Martinique. On 13 January 1798, while Fahie was on leave to take temporary command of the fleet, then anchored before St. Kitts, Lieutenant Charles Peterson was in command of Perdrix. She and , which was under the command of Thomas Pitt, Lieutenant Lord Camelford, were both in English Harbour, Antigua undergoing refit. A dispute arose between the two lieutenants over who was senior and so in charge of the port and both vessels. In the dispute, Camelford shot and killed Peterson for mutiny. What triggered the dispute was the departure from the harbour on the previous day of , whose captain, Jemmet Mainwaring, had previously been the senior officer in the port. Peterson had been first lieutenant under Camelford for three months when Camelford had taken over Favourite, even though Peterson was senior on the lieutenants list and represented Captain Fahie. The two ships' companies almost fired on each other when Camelford shot Petersen. Captain Henry Mitford of arrived that evening and put Camelford under arrest. Mitford put Lieutenant Parsons of Favourite in command of Perdrix and sent her out to sea. The subsequent court martial acquitted Camelford. Perdrix engaged in one major action when on 12 December 1798 she took L'Arm√©e d' Italie, a privateer of fourteen 9-pounder and four 12-pounder guns. A few days earlier Perdrix had encountered an American vessel leeward of St Thomas, which had reported being boarded by a French privateer seven leagues east of Virgin Gorda. The wind and weather were such that it took four days before Fahie could get Perdrix to the area and find his quarry. After a chase of 16 hours and an action of 42 minutes, the privateer was an unmanageable wreck. Of her crew of 117 men under the command of Citizen Colachyshe had lost six dead and five wounded; Perdrix had only one man wounded, and some damage to her sails and rigging. L'Armee d' Italie was 11 days out of Guadeloupe and had captured the brig Bittern and the schooner Concorde, out of Martinique. (Some members of their crews were aboard L'Armee d' Italie when Perdrix captured her. Perdrix then took her into Tortola, where she was condemned a week later. At some point Perdrix captured Remt Folkerus. Fate Perdrix arrived at Deptford on 22 July 1799. She was broken up on 10 September, less than two months after arriving.

Sapontzis (born February 9, 1945) is an American philosopher and professor emeritus of philosophy at California State University, East Bay who specializes in animal ethics, environmental ethics and meta-ethics. He is the author of Morals, Reason, and Animals (1987) and Subjective Morals (2011), and editor of Food for Thought: The Debate over Eating Meat (2004). He was co- founder in 1985 of the journal Between the Species: A Journal of Ethics, and founder of the Hayward Friends of Animals Humane Society. He was also one of the first members of the board of directors of the Society for the Study of Ethics and Animals. Biography Sapontzis was born in New York City, the son of Zissis Peter and Lea Marie Vial Sapontzis. Sapontzis obtained his BA from Rice University in 1967, and his MPhil and PhD from Yale University in 1970 and 1971. He joined the philosophy faculty at California State University, East Bay in 1971, and became professor emeritus in 1999. He was a member of the board of the American Philosophical Quarterly (1991‚Äì1994), and sat on the animal welfare research committee at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (1986‚Äì1990). On December 25, 1992, he married Jeanne Marie Gocker.  Morals, Reason, and Animals  In Morals, Reason, and Animals, Sapontzis argues that nonhuman animals have interests, and that it is the existence of these interests that justifies their inclusion in the moral community. He writes that human beings should extend to animals the same moral protection for the latter's interests that we enjoy for our own. Sapontzis argues further that the burden of proof should shift toward those who argue against equal consideration for animals: > Aristotle thought that men were naturally superior to women and Greeks > naturally superior to other races; Victorians thought white men had to > shoulder the burden of being superior to savages; and Nazis thought Aryans > were a master race. We have come to reject these and many other supposedly > natural hierarchies; the history of what we consider moral progress can be > viewed as, in large part, the replacement of hierarchical worldviews with a > presumption in favor of forms of egalitarianism. This substitution places > the burden of proof on those who would deny equal consideration to the > interests of all concerned, rather than on those who seek such > consideration. Consequently, some reason is needed to justify the fairness > of maintaining a hierarchical worldview when we are dealing with animals.\\" The claim that rationality should be prerequisite for moral consideration is challenged by Sapontzis, who argues that the experience of pain is not greater if an individual is more intelligent and that the opposite may well be the case, as individuals who lack the capacity to understand why they are experiencing pain in a certain situation may suffer more as a result. Sapontzis also investigates the issue of wild animal suffering and whether humans have an obligation to help these animals. He questions the view that aiding these individuals is ridiculous or absurd, instead arguing that if we have the means to help an individual suffering in such a situation, we should do so; as long as we do not inflict a greater harm in the process. Sapontzis makes a clear distinction between his antispeciesist position and that of environmentalists who are against helping animals suffering in these situations.

While leading the launch of Madden NFL from '06 to '09, he helped redefine the way popular video game franchises are launched and marketed, mirroring that of major theatrical releases. This transition in marketing strategy spawned the events Maddenoliday and Maddenpalooza, both of which reinforced the notion that the annual release date of Madden NFL is a day worth celebrating for gamers. The latter of these events - Maddenpalooza - was held in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Erb and his team's work on Madden NFL 07 and 08 was awarded back to back MI6 Best Overall Marketing Campaign Silver Awards.

Other partnerships have included those with professional sports leagues, including a weekly gaming tour that traveled with and mirrored NFL games.

It describes the discovery, purchase and settlement of Kentucky. Inaccuracies in the text have influenced public perception of the discovery of Kentucky. An appendix at the end is much longer than the main work. The first article of the appendix, titled, \\"The adventures of Colonel Daniel Boon, formerly a hunter, containing a narrative of the wars of Kentucke\\", provides a collection of stories, presented as an \\"out of his own mouth\\" publication of Daniel Boone. The second article included in the appendix is a short description of the council held by Thomas J. Dalton with the Piankashaw Indians, followed by a description of the different tribes in close proximity of Kentucky. Author and contributors The first map of Kentucky, presented in 1784 by author John Filson to the United States Congress Author, historian, founder and surveyor John Filson worked as a schoolteacher in Lexington, Kentucky and wrote The Discovery, Settlement and Present State of Kentucke in 1784. The book is regarded as the first written history of Kentucky and features the first known map of the territory, dedicated to the Congress of the United States and George Washington. Filson's appendix includes an account of the life and adventures of frontiersman Daniel Boone, helping make him famous during his lifetime. Boone founded Boonesborough, Kentucky, was a militia officer during the Revolutionary War, and worked as a merchant and surveyor. Summary According to Filson, Kentucky was first discovered by James M. Bride and others during 1754. They marked their territory on a single tree located in the mouth of the Kentucky River. Daniel Boone and John Finley decided in 1769 to return to Kentucky to explore. Boone was the only person to survive the attacks of local Indian tribes, and remained in the wilderness of Kentucky until 1771. Filson mentions that the land on the north side of the Kentucky River was purchased from the Five Nations, and the land on the south side during a treaty with Cherokee Indians at Wataga in 1775. Filson briefly explains here the three ways in which rights to Kentucky land was obtained. The first dealt with those in the military, granting them land \\"as a reward for services done in one of the two last wars.\\" The second, granted those who maintained an occupation in the area for more than a year, or who raised a crop of corn was granted four hundred acres. The third granted land to those who had built a cabin or made improvements in the area. Appendix Filson gives factual accounts of Daniel Boone's adventures and exploration of Kentucky during the American Revolution. Boone first wandered the lands of Kentucky in 1769, in the company of John Finley, John Steward, Joseph Holden, James Monay, and William Cool. The Natives in this area caused Boone and his men many complications by continuously attacking during their travels. Amidst the battles, Filson describes Boone as a positive man throughout his entire visit. Boone believed that his narrative would inform others of how remarkable Kentucky was. He claimed that Kentucky was \\"one of the most opulent and powerful states on the continent of North-America; which with the love and gratitude of my country- men, I esteem a sufficient reward for all my toil and danger.\\" Filson explains here the difference between American religion and religion of the Native people. Native Americans at this time seemed to be aware of a higher power, but did not fully worship that. Roman Catholicism was introduced to Natives near Detroit. The Natives on the other hand, were not concerned with religion. Rather than worshiping a God, they had festivals in rejoice of good fortune. Filson describes their worship process, adultery amongst some, marriage traditions, gender roles and their treatment of captives. Filson ends the appendix with \\"a few observations upon the happy circumstances, that the inhabitants of Kentucke will probably enjoy, from the possession of a country so extensive and fertile.\\" He states the importance of four natural qualities he believes substantial for the success of a country: good soil, air, water, and trade.\\" References 1784 books American history books Books about Appalachia History books about the United States History of Kentucky ","title":"The Discovery, Settlement and Present State of Kentucke"},{"id":"35998680","text":"H≈çsui-Susukino Station (Ë±äÊ∞¥„Åô„Åô„Åç„ÅÆÈßÖ) is a Sapporo Municipal Subway in Ch≈´≈ç-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.

X-Coaster was closed during the entire 2009 season, before reopening in 2010. Although Maurer S√∂hne is considered the manufacturer of the ride, the track for X-Coaster was fabricated by Dynamic Structures, and the ride was constructed by Martin & Vleminckx. On October 5, 2012, Magic Springs and Crystal Falls announced that X-Coaster will be removed at the end of the 2012 season and that they plan on expanding Crystal Falls water park in 2013. Despite this, however, the ride has continued operation into the 2013 season with its removal being delayed. Ride A model of X-Coaster. After the train departs from the station, it immediately begins to climb the vertical (90 degree) lift hill. Upon reaching the top of the lift, the train turns 45 degrees backwards putting the train and its riders in an upside down position. Then, as the train exits the lift, it goes through a heartline roll before going down the only drop in the layout of the roller coaster. The train speeds through the station going back up the lift. Once it lost momentum the train then returns down passing through the station again. It then proceeds back up the drop and partially into the heartline roll before once again losing momentum and returning to the ground. After passing the station for the third time, the train is stopped near the top of the lift hill. The train is then lowered back down to the station where the next riders board the ride. The XT 150 has the option of sending riders around a second cycle at the operator's discretion. When the train stopped on the lift hill at the end of the ride, instead of lowering slowly back to the station, the chain would raise the car up and send it through the ride again.

From 1918 onwards she worked for the Ring-Film GmbH, managed by Manfred Liebenau, who was working as a director under the nom de plume Erik Lund. The two married when May was 16 years old. During this time, May appeared in films such as Ertr√§umtes (1918), Sadja (1918), and The Bride of the Incapacitated (1919). Lund and May soon created their own Eva May serial, in which May wrote the scripts for. In the 1920s, May worked with her father in films such as The Legend of Holy Simplicity (1920) and Junge Mama (1921). Privately, May was regarded as difficult to work with, and often quarrelled with her father. She worked with other directors like Karl Grune in The Count of Charolais (1922) and Max Mack in Die Fledermaus (1923) opposite Lya de Putti. She starred alongside Alfred Abel in Scheine des Todes (1923), which was directed by her second husband, Lothar Mendes. The most successful films she starred in were Paganini (1923) with Conrad Veidt, and Old Heidelberg (1923) with Paul Hartmann. Her final film was Der geheime Agent (1924).

The film is about a young man's attempts to move away from a life of violent crime, with the help of a wholesome country girl who comes to stay with his friend in the city, only to find himself the target of retaliation. Plot Tyson (Ashley Chin), Mannie (Jason Maza) and Jason (Michael Maris) grew up together in a tough inner-city world in London's East End, where no one could be trusted and everyone was out for themselves. With opportunities limited, it is crime that pays the bills and violence on the streets is how someone makes their mark. They make a living out of armed robberies with the help of eye candy Davina (Anna Nightingale) to seduce and lure drunken, unsuspecting rich City men in clubs, go back with them to their expensive flats, then Tyson and his crew move in, beat them up and steal everything. When naive, middle class, country-girl from the Home counties Tia (Ashley Madekwe) comes to stay in the London council flat of her cousin Davina, a close friend of Tyson, little does she realizes that Davina and her friends have a lucrative side-line honey-trap scam and that her naivety will disturb the delicate balance of Davina and her group of friends. Tia arrives at their block of council flats whilst they celebrate their recent heist in a rundown council tower block. Tia notices Tyson sits apart from the main group. Tyson's reasons for involving himself in their crimes are different from his friends'. For Tyson it is not about living the lifestyle but about supporting his 15-year-old sister, Nyla (Letitia Wright), through school and paying off the gambling debts his alcoholic mum landed them in when she abandoned them. Although Tyson is desperate to break out of the cycle of violence and gangland criminal lifestyle, which has already claimed the lives of some of his friends and acquaintances. He equally wants to provide for Nyla and help her make something of herself, but smart as she is, she has started running with the wrong crowd who seem hell bent on teaching immigrant Victor (Jordy Meya) a lesson. Tyson realises that he is not exactly the best role model. When Tyson meets Tia, she helps him see that there are other ways to escape the cycle of poverty, a way out of his violent, criminal life, a way to stop being a victim of his circumstances and live his life as an example to his sister. He realises that the way of life he has is only going to end in prison or an early grave, and decides to change his ways. With more in common than expected, Tia and Tyson become drawn to one another. However Davina disapproves of Tia's positive influence on Tyson and is jealous of their blossoming romance, and begins to plan a terrible revenge designed to also win him back from her. Meanwhile, before Tyson can turn a corner and leave the street life behind, his mother breaks into his home and robs him of everything he has. He decides to take part in one final job to secure his future, which promises a big payoff, Tyson prepares to take his biggest gamble yet and has to fight not to be drawn back into the cycle of violence. Caught up in an escalating chain of violent events, will he have to make the ultimate sacrifice?

Without preaching and without glamourising, Victim makes you wonder about the consequences of the choices made in this fast-paced thriller with plenty of action, but quite a few laughs too.\\" Anthony Quinn of The Independent thought the film started \\"quite promisingly before succumbing to earnest sloganeering on victimhood and the clich√© of a crim's one last job before going straight. By the end, it crams its message into a student essay that's recited in class and greeted, bewilderingly, with applause.\\" Mark Kermode reviewed the film in The Guardian as \\"the set-ups are familiar, the characters well worn and the film-makers' message (we are all victims) writ cornily large. But co-writer Chin is an imposing screen presence of whom we may expect more in future.\\" David Calhoun of Time Out thought the film was \\"solidly made, but once you get past the attempts at realism ‚Äì the banter, the backstories, the music, the clothes ‚Äì it's a desperately corny yarn.\\" George Bass of Total Film rated the film 2/5 and described it as a \\"Heat-style smash-and-grabs (but with binmen) seem even smaller on the small screen, while the sight of young RADA graduates trying to talk tower block doesn't do wonders for its cred. But the ending raises its game...\\" Paul Bradshaw of Total Film rating it 3/5 said, \\"Anuva barrel of 'hood clich√©s it might be, but the sharp cast and snappy script (by Chin and co-star Michael Maris) make it fresher and funnier than it sounds.\\" RWD thought the film was \\"packed with powerful performances from the UK's next wave of film stars.\\" Choice FM called the film \\"entertaining.\\" Flava hailed the film \\"groundbreaking... brilliant.\\" Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes has collected 8 reviews, three positive and five negative, resulting in a 38% approval rating.

In a notice in the Brownsville Daily Herald (Brownsville, Texas) of 21 November 1908, Janson, whose visit there was under negotiation, was described (perhaps somewhat hyperbolically) as \\"one of the most famous pianists and composers in the world today, being classed in the same rank with Paderewski and Joseph Hoffmann\\". At that time he was described as a German pianist.The Portal to Texas History That same year he became the head of a music school in Wichita, Kansas, at age 26.The Music Trade Review He took up residence in Pittsburgh in early 1911, and made a favourable impression there.The Pittsburgh Press, 4 June 1911 In 1914 he appeared as soloist under the baton of Walter Damrosch in Pittsburgh.Indiana Evening Gazette, 9 January 1914 Selmar Janson taught at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh for many years. By far his most prominent and successful student there was Earl Wild, who studied with him from the age of 12. Under Janson, Wild learned Xaver Scharwenka's Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor, which Janson had studied directly with the composer, his own teacher. When, over 40 years later, Erich Leinsdorf asked Wild to record the concerto, he was able to say \\"I've been waiting by the phone for forty years for someone to ask me to play this\\".Debora Arder, The Piano Teaching of Earl Wild Other students of Janson's included Louis Crowder (1907-1998),University LibrariesPittsburgh Post-Gazette, 21 December 1935The Day, 4 August 1998 Paul Scherr, Leonard Sharrow, Ruth Scott Clark (1912-2009),pallc.net and Annette Roussel-Pesche (1914-1997; whose other teachers included Alfred Cortot, Nadia Boulanger, Pierre Fournier and Georges Dandelot).Media ClarionThe Pittsburgh Press, 3 May 1942 Margaret H.

The book was published in English translation in 1982, and received positive reviews, commending Nishitani for his understanding of both western and eastern philosophy. The appearance of the English translation increased interest in Nishitani's ideas among philosophers. Publication history The English translation of Religion and Nothingness, by the philosopher Jan Van Bragt, was first published in 1982 by University of California Press. Reception According to Ruben L. F. Habito, the appearance of Religion and Nothingness in English translation in 1982 led to increasing interest in Nishitani's ideas among philosophers, theologians, and religious scholars. Graham Parkes described the book as Nishitani's masterwork, writing that in it Nishitani achieved a philosophical synthesis that matches the achievements of the philosophers S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Martin Heidegger in depth of insight. The book received positive reviews from Donald L. Smith in Library Journal and J. N. Gray in The Times Literary Supplement. Smith wrote that Nishitani \\"presents a subtle philosophical analysis of reality and a lively argument for resolving problems of being in terms of certain metaphysical principles of Zen Buddhism.\\" Smith called the book \\"profound yet clearly written\\", and credited Nishitani with \\"erudite wisdom and understanding of both Eastern and Western philosophical traditions.\\" Gray wrote that Nishitani \\"achieves a remarkable cross-fertilization of the most profound and radical elements in Eastern and Western philosophy and spiritual experience\\", and that the book \\"will have the utmost value for all those who see in contemporary Western philosophy the unresolved issue of nihilism, and who are prepared to entertain the supposition that thought emerging from a tradition in which the experience of Nothingness was not threatening, and rather a benediction, may have something to teach us.\\" The book was also reviewed by Philip Blosser in Research in Phenomenology, the theologian Thomas J. J. Altizer in Journal of the American Academy of Religion, the Buddhist studies scholar Bernard Faure in The Journal of Asian Studies, Thomas P. Kasulis in The Journal of Religion, and Richard H.

It is the most destructive hurricane to ever hit Florida in terms of structures damaged or destroyed, and was the costliest in financial terms until Hurricane Irma surpassed it 25 years later. It was the strongest landfalling hurricane in decades and the costliest hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the United States, until it was surpassed by Katrina in 2005. In addition, Andrew is one of only four hurricanes to make landfall in the United States as a Category 5, alongside the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Camille in 1969, and Hurricane Michael in 2018. Andrew caused major damage in the Bahamas and Louisiana, but the greatest impact was felt in South Florida, where the storm made landfall as a Category 5 hurricane, with 1-minute sustained wind speeds as high as 165 mph (280 km/h) and a gust as high as 174 mph. Passing directly through the city of Homestead in Dade County (now known as Miami-Dade County), Andrew stripped many homes of all but their concrete foundations. In total, Andrew destroyed more than 63,500 houses, damaged more than 124,000 others, caused $27.3 billion in damage, and left 65 people dead. Andrew began as a tropical depression over the eastern Atlantic Ocean on August 16. After spending a week without significantly strengthening itself in the central Atlantic, it rapidly intensified into a powerful Category 5 hurricane while moving westward towards the Bahamas on August 23. Though it briefly weakened to Category 4 status while traversing the Bahamas, it regained Category 5 intensity before making landfall in Florida on Elliott Key and then Homestead on August 24. With a barometric pressure of 922 mbar (27.23 inHg) at the time of landfall in Florida, Andrew is the sixth most-intense hurricane to strike the United States. Several hours later, the hurricane emerged over the Gulf of Mexico at Category 4 strength, with the Gulf Coast of the United States in its dangerous path. After turning northwestward and weakening further, Andrew moved ashore near Morgan City, Louisiana, as a low-end Category 3 storm. After moving inland, the small hurricane curved northeastward and rapidly lost its intensity, merging with a frontal system over the southern Appalachian Mountains on August 29. Andrew first inflicted structural damage as it moved through the Bahamas, especially in Cat Cays, lashing the islands with storm surge, hurricane-force winds, and tornadoes. About 800 houses were destroyed in the archipelago, and there was substantial damage to the transport, water, sanitation, agriculture, and fishing sectors. Andrew left four dead and $250 million in damage throughout the Bahamas. In parts of southern Florida, Andrew produced severe winds; a wind gust of 177 mph (282 km/h) was observed at a house in Perrine. The cities of Florida City, Homestead, Cutler Ridge and parts of Kendall received the brunt of the storm. As many as 1.4 million people lost power at the height of the storm; some for more than one month. In the Everglades, 70,000 acres (280 km2) of trees were downed, while invasive Burmese pythons began inhabiting the region after a nearby facility housing them was destroyed. Rainfall in Florida was substantial, peaking at 13.98 inches (355 mm) in western Dade County. In Florida, Andrew killed 44 and left a record $25 billion in damage. Prior to making landfall in Louisiana on August 26, Andrew caused extensive damage to oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, leading to $500 million in losses for oil companies. It produced hurricane-force winds along its path through Louisiana, damaging large stretches of power lines that left about 230,000 people without electricity. Over 80% of trees in the Atchafalaya River basin were downed, and the agriculture there was devastated. Throughout the basin and Bayou Lafourche, 187 million freshwater fish were killed in the hurricane. With 23,000 houses damaged, 985 others destroyed, and 1,951 mobile homes demolished, property losses in Louisiana exceeded $1.5 billion. The hurricane caused the deaths of 17 people in the state, 6 of whom drowned offshore. Andrew spawned at least 28 tornadoes along the Gulf Coast, especially in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. In total, Andrew left 65 dead and caused $27.3 billion in damage. It is currently the seventh-costliest Atlantic hurricane to hit the United States, behind only Katrina (2005), Ike (2008), Sandy (2012), Harvey (2017), Irma (2017), and Maria (2017), as well as the eighth-costliest Atlantic hurricane, behind the aforementioned systems and Wilma (2005). It is the third-strongest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland by wind speed (165 mph). Meteorological history A tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa on August 14. A ridge of high pressure to its north caused the wave to move quickly westward. An area of convection developed along the wave axis to the south of the Cape Verde islands, and on August 15, meteorologists began classifying the system with the Dvorak technique. The thunderstorm activity became more concentrated, and narrow spiral rainbands began to develop around a center of circulation. It is estimated that Tropical Depression Three developed late on August 16, about east-southeast of Barbados. Embedded within the deep easterlies, the depression tracked west-northwestward at . Initially, moderate wind shear prevented strengthening, until a decrease in shear allowed the depression to intensify into Tropical Storm Andrew at 12:00 UTC on August 17. By early August 18, the storm maintained convection near the center with spiral bands to its west as the winds increased to . Shortly thereafter, the storm began weakening because of increased southwesterly wind shear from an upper-level low. On August 19, a Hurricane Hunters flight into the storm failed to locate a well-defined center and on the following day, a flight found that the cyclone had degenerated to the extent that only a diffuse low- level circulation center remained; observations indicated the barometric pressure rose to an unusually high . The flight indicated that Andrew maintained a vigorous circulation aloft. After the upper-level low weakened and split into a trough, the wind shear decreased over the storm. A strong high pressure system then developed over the southeastern United States, which built eastward and caused Andrew to turn to the west. Convection became more organized as upper-level outflow became better established. An eye formed, and Andrew attained hurricane status early on August 22, about east-southeast of Nassau, Bahamas. In the forecast issued six hours after becoming a hurricane, the cyclone was predicted to make landfall near Jupiter, Florida, with winds of 105 mph (170 km/h) on August 25. This underestimated both the strength and the speed of the storm, which would eventually make landfall in South Florida. upright=1.25 The hurricane accelerated westward into an area of highly favorable conditions, and began to rapidly intensify late on August 22; in a 24‚Äëhour period the atmospheric pressure dropped by to a minimum of . On August 23, the storm attained Category 5 status on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale, reaching peak winds of 175 mph (280 km/h) a short distance off Eleuthera island in the Bahamas at 18:00 UTC. Despite its intensity, Andrew was a small tropical cyclone, with winds of extending out only about 90 mi (150 km) from the center. After reaching that intensity, the hurricane underwent an eyewall replacement cycle. At 21:00 UTC on August 23, Andrew made landfall on Eleuthera as a Category 5 hurricane, with winds of . The cyclone weakened further while crossing the Bahama Banks, and at 01:00 UTC on August 24, Andrew hit the southern Berry Islands of the Bahamas as a Category 4 hurricane, with winds of . As it crossed over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, the hurricane rapidly re-intensified as the eye decreased in size and its eyewall convection deepened. At 08:40 UTC on August 24, Andrew struck Elliott Key as a Category 5 hurricane, with winds of and a pressure of . About 25 minutes after its first Florida landfall, Andrew made another landfall just northeast of Homestead, with a slightly lower pressure of . This barometric pressure made Andrew the most intense hurricane to strike the United States since Hurricane Camille in 1969 and the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall in Florida since the Labor Day hurricane of 1935. The United States would not experience another landfall from a hurricane at Category 5 intensity until Hurricane Michael in 2018. As the eye moved onshore in Florida, the convection in the eyewall strengthened due to increased convergence, and Hurricane Hunters reported a warmer eyewall temperature than two hours prior. However, Andrew weakened as it continued further inland, and after crossing southern Florida in four hours, the storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico with winds of 130 mph (210 km/h). In the Gulf of Mexico, the eye remained well- defined as the hurricane turned to the west-northwest, a change due to the weakening of the ridge to its north. Andrew steadily re-intensified over the Gulf of Mexico, reaching winds of 145 mph (235 km/h) late on August 25. As the high pressure system to its north weakened, a strong mid-latitude trough approached the area from the northwest. This caused the hurricane to decelerate to the northwest, and winds decreased as Andrew approached the Gulf Coast of the United States. At 08:30 UTC on August 26, the cyclone made landfall about 20 mi (30 km) west-southwest of Morgan City, Louisiana, with winds of . Andrew weakened rapidly as it turned to the north and northeast, falling to tropical storm intensity within 10 hours. After entering Mississippi, the cyclone deteriorated to tropical depression status early on August 27. Accelerating northeastward, the depression began merging with the approaching frontal system, and by midday on August 28, Andrew had lost its tropical identity while located over the southern Appalachian Mountains. The storm's remnants continued moving towards the northeast, fully merging with the remnants of Hurricane Lester and the frontal zone over the Mid-Atlantic, in Pennsylvania, on August 29. Post-analysis on Andrew revealed that the storm was often stronger than operationally reported between early on August 22 and early on August 26. In real time, the National Hurricane Center assessed its peak intensity as , which was upgraded to 155 mph (250 km/h) in a post-storm analysis after the season ended. However, a 2004 paper by Christopher Landsea and others concluded that Andrew became a Category 5 hurricane near the Bahamas on August 23 and reached maximum sustained winds of 175 mph (280 km/h). The paper also indicated that Andrew briefly re-intensified into a Category 5 hurricane around the time of landfall in South Florida early on August 24. The storm was found to have been slightly stronger than originally assessed while approaching Louisiana, but the landfall winds were decreased from 120 mph (195 km/h) to 115 mph (185 km/h). Preparations Visual comparison of Hurricane Floyd and Hurricane Andrew while at similar positions and nearly identical intensities Bahamas Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham, who took office while the storm was active, urged residents to \\"take this hurricane seriously\\". Before the hurricane passed through the Bahamas, forecasters predicted a storm surge of up to , as well as up to of rain. On August 22, hurricane watches were issued from Andros and Eleuthera islands northward through Grand Bahama and Great Abaco. They were upgraded to hurricane warnings later that day, and on August 23, additional warnings were issued for the central Bahamas, including Cat Island, Exuma, San Salvador Island, and Long Island, Bahamas. All watches and warnings were discontinued on August 24. Advance warning was credited for the low death toll in the country. A total of 58 shelters were opened at churches, government buildings, and schools. Florida alt=Infrared satellite image of Andrew, with its eye clearly visible Initially, forecasters predicted tides up to above normal along the east coast of Florida, near the potential location of landfall. Rainfall was projected to be between along the path of the storm. In addition, the National Hurricane Center noted the likelihood of isolated tornadoes in Central and South Florida during the passage of Andrew on August 23 and 24. Several tropical storm and hurricane warnings were issued for much of Central and South Florida, from Titusville on the east coast to Venice on the west coast. Included in the warnings were Lake Okeechobee and all of the Florida Keys. By 18:00 UTC on August 24, all watches and warnings issued were discontinued after Andrew progressed into the Gulf of Mexico. Governor Lawton Chiles declared a state of emergency and activated about one-third of the Florida National Guard. Many residents evacuated, most voluntarily, from Broward, Charlotte, Collier, Lee, Martin, Dade, Monroe, Palm Beach, and Sarasota counties. A total of 142 shelters opened in these counties and collectively housed at least 84,340 people. In Dade County alone, 515,670 people were ordered to evacuate. As Andrew was approaching, an estimated 20,000‚Äì30,000 tourists were in the Florida Keys (Monroe County). Overall, almost 1.2 million people evacuated, which contributed to the low number of fatalities, despite the intensity of the storm. Many evacuees also checked into hotels, with rooms completely booked as far north as Ocala. Ultimately, the sheer number of evacuees led to likely the largest traffic jam in the history of Florida, mostly along Interstate 95. United States Coast Guard vessels on or near the Florida coastline were either secured onshore or sent to ride out the storm at sea. Government offices and public and private schools were closed from Monroe County northward to St. Lucie County. Many colleges and universities in southeast Florida also closed. Major airports such as the Fort Lauderdale‚ÄìHollywood, Key West, Miami, and Palm Beach international airports closed. Gulf Coast of the United States Satellite image of Hurricane Andrew approaching Louisiana Shortly after the storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico from southern Florida, the National Hurricane Center issued hurricane watches and warnings for the Gulf Coast of the United States beginning at 13:00 UTC on August 24. After the initial hurricane watch from Mobile, Alabama, to Sabine Pass, Texas, the watches and warnings were expanded to eventually include areas from Mobile, Alabama, to Freeport, Texas. All watches and warnings on the Gulf Coast were discontinued late on August 26 after the hurricane moved inland over Louisiana. Due to the hurricane's threat, workers fled oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, while the Coast Guard moved their boats inland. Officials in Mississippi suggested that about 100,000 people evacuate the coastal counties. Shelters were opened in Hancock and Harrison counties, though only 68 people went to a shelter in the former. Gambling ships were moved into harbors and inland canals. Two run-offs for special legislative elections scheduled for August 25 were postponed. In Louisiana, Governor Edwin Edwards declared a state of emergency. About 1.25 million people evacuated from the central and southeast Louisiana, while approximately 60,000 others fled parishes in southwest Louisiana. A mandatory evacuation from Grand Isle was ordered by Mayor Andy Valence and the city council. In New Orleans, Mayor Sidney Barthelemy ordered the evacuation of about 200,000 residents in the low-lying areas of the city. Nine shelters were opened in the city, which were occupied by thousands of people. In response to computer simulations showing that storm surge from a tropical cyclone like Hurricane Andrew could over-top the levees, workers closed 111 floodgates. The Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport closed, with jumbo jets being flown to other airports. A total of 250 members of the Louisiana National Guard patrolled the streets during the storm. The Red Cross assisted with opening a shelter at the University of Southwest Louisiana's Cajundome in Lafayette, equipped to handle about 2,000 people. In Texas, about 250,000 people evacuated Orange and Jefferson counties. Galveston City Manager Doug Matthews advised residents to develop an evacuation plan in the event that the city chose to call for evacuations. The city later decided against ordering an evacuation. School was canceled on August 25 for Beaumont, Port Arthur, and other areas of central Jefferson County, while schools were closed in Dickinson, High Island, Hitchcock, La Marque, Santa Fe, and Texas City on August 26. College of the Mainland, Galveston College, and Texas A&M; University at Galveston were also closed. Emergency management crews in Corpus Christi began testing emergency generators and severe weather gear. The Comal County chapter of the Red Cross placed their disaster alert teams on standby and ready to respond if the hurricane threatened the Corpus Christi area. Impact Though Andrew was a small tropical cyclone for most of its lifespan, it caused extreme damage, especially in the Bahamas, Florida, and Louisiana. The vast majority of the damage was as a result of extremely high winds, although a few tornadoes spawned by Andrew caused considerable damage in Louisiana. Throughout the areas affected, almost 177,000 people were left homeless. Outside of the Bahamas, Florida, and Louisiana, effects were widespread, although damage was minimal. Overall, $27.3 billion in losses and 65 fatalities were attributed to Andrew, although many other estimates range as high as $36 billion. Andrew was the costliest hurricane in U.S. history at the time, but is now seventh following hurricanes Katrina (2005), Ike (2008), Sandy (2012), Harvey (2017), Irma (2017), and Maria (2017). Bahamas In the Bahamas, Andrew produced hurricane-force winds in North Eleuthera, New Providence, North Andros, Bimini, and the Berry Islands. The storm first struck North Eleuthera, where it produced a high storm surge. At a small village in the northwestern portion of the island, more than half of the houses were destroyed and the rest of the buildings sustained minor to major damage. One person drowned from the surge in Lower Bogue, Eleuthera, and two others died in The Bluff. On Current Island, the hurricane destroyed 24 of the 30 houses. Harbour Island, near Eleuthera, reported wind gusts of ‚Äì the strongest gust speed observed in the Bahamas during Andrew's passage. News reports indicated severe damage to 36 houses on Harbor Island. Andrew produced several tornadoes in the area. At the capital city of Nassau, sustained winds reached , while gusts up to were reported. Only minor damage occurred in Nassau, according to the Bahamas Red Cross, but on the private island of Cat Cay, many expensive homes sustained heavy damage. Much of the northwestern Bahamas received damage, with estimated monetary losses reaching $250 million. A total of 800 houses were destroyed, leaving 1,700 people homeless. Additionally, the storm caused severe damage to the sectors of transport, communications, water, sanitation, agriculture, and fishing. Four deaths in the country were attributed to the hurricane, of which three were direct; the indirect fatality was due to heart failure during the passage of the storm. Florida Damage from Hurricane Andrew in a large mobile home community Overall, Andrew caused about $25.3 billion in damage in Florida, making it the costliest hurricane to hit the state at the time. Some estimates in Florida put the damage as high as $34 billion (1992 USD, $ USD). Almost all of the damage in Florida was caused by strong winds. Of the 44 deaths attributed to the storm, 15 were direct fatalities, while 29 were indirectly caused by the storm. It was later noted that if Andrew had been slightly larger or had made landfall a few miles further north, it would have significantly affected Miami and Fort Lauderdale, which would have resulted in an even higher damage and death toll. An analysis by the American Meteorological Society indicated that unlike most hurricanes, wind damage from Andrew was mostly north of the geometric center and occurred primarily on the eastern edge of the storm. Some officials in Florida considered Andrew the worst storm in the state since the Labor Day hurricane in 1935. The storm surge from Andrew caused more than $500 million in losses to boats and buildings. At the height of the storm, more than 1.4 million people lost electricity and another 150,000 were without telephone service. It is estimated that throughout Florida, the storm damaged 101,241 homes and destroyed approximately 63,000 others ‚Äì the vast majority in Dade County ‚Äì with about 175,000 people rendered homeless. In addition to homes, the storm damaged or destroyed 82,000 businesses, of farmland, 31 public schools, 59 health facilities/hospitals, 9,500 traffic signals, of power lines, and 3,000 watermains. Approximately 20 million cubic yards (15 million m3) of debris left by the storm were disposed of. Tides were generally between above normal in the Biscayne Bay area, though near the Burger King International Headquarters, tides reached as high as above normal. Storm surge on the west coast was widespread but generally light, with a peak height of in Everglades City and Goodland. Strong winds from the storm were confined to a relatively small area, stretching from Key Largo to the Miami Beach area. A house near Perrine initially reported a wind gust of before the structure and instrument were destroyed; this measurement was reduced to , after wind-tunnel testing at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University of the same type of anemometer revealed a 16.5% error. Several other anemometers measuring the highest wind speeds on land were destroyed or failed. At the National Hurricane Center building in Coral Gables, sustained winds of and gusts to were measured before the anemometer failed. The highest sustained wind speed for the storm was , recorded at the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station, before instruments also failed there. In Key Largo, a 13-minute wind speed of was reported. Tropical storm force winds reached as far north as West Palm Beach. On the west coast of Florida, sustained winds remained just below tropical storm force on Marco Island, though a wind gust of was reported in Collier County. Rainfall was generally light, possibly as a result of the storm's relatively fast movement. Overall, precipitation from Andrew peaked at nearly in western Dade County. Heavy rainfall in other areas was sporadic, with precipitation reported as far north as Central Florida. Lakes by the Bay Although effects from Andrew were catastrophic, the extent of damage was limited mainly from Kendall to Key Largo due to the small wind field of the storm. The hurricane destroyed 90% of mobile homes in the county, including 99% of mobile homes in Homestead. At the Homestead Air Force Base, most of the 2,000 buildings on the base were severely damaged or rendered unusable. Damage to the base was extensive enough that it was recommended for closure. Nearby, in the small town of Florida City, over 120 homes were demolished and 700 others were damaged, while a number of other buildings were damaged beyond repair, including City Hall. Further north, damage to poorly constructed homes in communities such as Country Walk and Saga Bay resembled that of an F3 tornado, as winds in the area were estimated to have ranged from , below the threshold for an F3 tornado. Four of the five condominiums at Naranja Lakes were destroyed. The Cutler Ridge Mall suffered severe wind and water damage; after the storm, significant looting was reported at that location. More than 50 streets were blocked by fallen trees and power lines. Agriculture suffered extensively as well, with an 85% loss to fruit crops such as avocados, limes, and mangoes. Crop damage in Dade County totaled about $509 million. The county suffered the vast majority of the damage from the hurricane, totaling approximately $25 billion. Andrew left at least 40 deaths in the county, 15 direct and 25 indirect. alt=An aerial view of destroyed mobile homes with copious amounts of debris Elsewhere, effects were relatively minimal, except in Broward, Monroe, and Collier counties. In Broward County, on the north side of the storm's path, damage in several municipalities was primarily limited to downed trees, several of which fell onto roads and power lines. In Pembroke Park, one of the worst affected cities in the county, approximately 260 mobile homes were damaged. Storm surge left coastal flooding in some areas, especially along state roads A1A and 858. Property damage reached about $100 million and three fatalities were reported in Broward County. In Everglades National Park and Biscayne National Park, more than 25% of trees were damaged or destroyed, including one-fourth of the royal palms and one-third of the pine trees in the former. In addition to the damage at Everglades National Park, effects in Monroe County were significant, especially in the Upper Florida Keys. Strong winds damaged billboards, awnings, commercial signs, several boats, planes, trees, and 1,500 homes, with 300 of those becoming uninhabitable. Damage in that county was about $131 million. In Collier County, to the north of the storm's path, sustained winds up to were observed in Chokoloskee. Storm surge flooded low-lying areas, particularly in Goodland, Everglades City, and Marco Island. Many boats were damaged or destroyed by the rough seas and strong winds. The storm destroyed 80 mobile homes and severely damaged 400 others. Property damage in the county reached about $30 million. Louisiana alt=Significant tornado damage inflicted upon a home, with its exterior walls missing and some of its interior walls and roof destroyed After hitting Florida, Andrew moved across the Gulf of Mexico and made landfall about west-southwest of Morgan City in south-central Louisiana; at landfall, the maximum sustained winds were . The highest sustained wind speed observed was , while a wind gust as strong as was recorded; both measurements were taken at the fire station in Berwick. As it moved ashore, the hurricane produced storm tides of at least above normal, causing flooding along the coast from Vermilion Bay to Lake Borgne. Offshore, a group of six fishermen from Alabama drowned. Heavy rains accompanied the storm's passage through the state, peaking at in Robert. River flooding was also reported, with the Tangipahoa River in Robert cresting at above flood stage. Before making landfall, Andrew spawned an F3 tornado in LaPlace, which killed two people and injured 32. The tornado was on the ground for about 10 minutes, during which it damaged or destroyed 163 structures, leaving 60 families homeless. Collectively, 14 tornadoes were reported in the parishes of Ascension, Iberville, Pointe Coupee, and Avoyelles, as well as in Baton Rouge. Along the Louisiana coastline, damages largely resembled those of a Category 2 hurricane. Damage was heaviest in St. Mary Parish, about east of where Andrew made landfall. Twenty-six schools were affected, with damage totaling $2.6 million. Berwick High School, sheltering about 2,000 people, was deroofed during the storm. Generally, single-family homes fared well, with most losing only roofing shingles, though others suffered severe damage after large trees fell on them. In Cypremort Point State Park, several mobile homes were destroyed. Houses in Berwick, Morgan City, and Patterson suffered major damage. Throughout the parish, 1,367 dwellings were destroyed, 2,028 were severely damaged, and 4,770 others were impacted to a minor degree. Property damage alone in St. Mary Parish reached approximately $150 million. Iberia Parish was also among the most severely impacted parishes. Two schools collectively sheltering about 3,600 people in Jeanerette and New Iberia lost their roofs. One death occurred in the parish due to electrocution. A total of 407 residences were demolished, 2,528 others were extensively damaged, and 3,526 others were inflicted with minor damage. Overall, the parish suffered $125 million in property damage, while an additional $200 million in damage was inflicted on sugar crops. Across the state, the hurricane damaged 23,000 homes and destroyed 985 homes and 1,951 mobile homes; private property damage was estimated at $1 billion. The high winds destroyed large areas of sugar and soybean crops, estimated at $289 million in damage. Strong winds also left at least 230,000 people without electricity. During the storm's passage, upwelling occurred in the Atchafalaya Basin and Bayou Lafourche, killing 187 million freshwater fish. Damage to the fishing industry was estimated at $266 million. Overall, losses in the state of Louisiana reached approximately $1.56 billion. A total of 17 deaths occurred in Louisiana, 8 directly and 9 from indirect causes. At least 75 injuries were reported. Remainder of the United States upright=1.3 While Andrew was entering the Gulf of Mexico, oil companies evacuated hundreds of employees from offshore drilling platforms. The storm damaged 241 oil and gas facilities and toppled 33 platforms off the coast of Louisiana, causing significant disruptions in production. Additionally, 83 pipeline segments suffered damage to some degree. The oil industry lost about $12 million per day in the days following Andrew and $4 million daily by three weeks later. Initially, a production loss of 240,000 to 270,000 barrels per day occurred ‚Äì approximately one-third of production throughout the Gulf of Mexico. Overall, Hurricane Andrew caused about $500 million in damage to oil facilities. As Andrew moved ashore in Louisiana, its outer fringes produced a storm tide of about in Sabine Pass, Texas. Winds were generally light in the state, reaching in Port Arthur. As Andrew crossed into Mississippi, 3 severe thunderstorm warnings, 21 tornado warnings, and 16 flood warnings were issued. Funnel clouds were observed near the path of the storm, along with 26 tornadoes. Structural damage was generally minimal, occurring from the tornadoes and severe thunderstorms. One tornado in Kemper County destroyed a mobile home, while another twister in Lauderdale County demolished a mobile home, damaged five other dwellings, and injured four people. Additionally, a possible tornado damaged a home and two trailers in Lawrence County. Strong winds knocked down trees in the southwestern portion of the state. Much of Mississippi received of rain, while areas near the southwest corner of the state observed over of precipitation, with a peak of at Sumrall. Flooding was mostly limited to the inundation of minor roads and low-lying areas in several counties. In Alabama, precipitation amounts in the state peaked at in Aliceville. The rainfall caused flooding in low-lying areas and creeks, covering a few county roads but not entering many houses or businesses. Along the coast, the storm produced flooding and high tides. Along Dauphin Island, high tides left severe beach erosion, with portions of the island losing up to of sand. Three damaging tornadoes occurred in the state. The most damaging tornado was spawned in Elmore County and moved from an area northeast of Montgomery to the south of Wetumpka and briefly lifted during its track. The tornado destroyed 2 homes and damaged 18 homes, 1 mobile home, 2 barns, and 1 vehicle. One person was injured by the twister. Sustained winds in the state were below tropical storm force, though a wind gust of 41 mph (67 km/h) was observed in Huntsville. Although 48 counties in Alabama reported wind damage, impact across the state was generally minor. Tropical storm force wind gusts and damaging tornadoes extended eastward into Georgia. Several counties in the northwest and west-central portions of the state reported downed trees and tree limbs and fallen power lines, causing scattered power outages, but structural damage was generally minor. In Carroll County, several dwellings and barns were damaged, with one mobile home destroyed. At the Columbus Metropolitan Airport, buildings, billboards, and signs were damaged. Additionally, a tornado in Floyd County near Rome snapped and uprooted several trees, damaged several fences and homes, and flipped over a trailer, tossing it on top of four cars. Monetary losses in the state reached about $100,000. In Tennessee, thunderstorm winds and tornadoes associated with Andrew downed trees and power lines, but caused little overall impact to homes and buildings. Similarly, in North Carolina, thunderstorm winds toppled trees and power lines at a number of locations in the mountainous areas of the state, especially in Avery County. Rainfall from Andrew spread across the southeastern United States along the Appalachian Mountains corridor; totals of over 5 in (125 mm) were reported where Georgia and South Carolina meet North Carolina. In West Virginia, the remnants of Andrew combined with a cold front to produce of rain over portions of the state, causing flooding in areas of Morgantown with poor drainage. The remnants of Andrew also spawned several tornadoes in Maryland. A tornado in Howard County damaged several homes, some extensively. The twister also tossed and wrecked a recreational vehicle and its trailer, downed trees, and flattened cornfields. Precipitation continued along the path of Andrew's remnants through the Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley, with precipitation measured as far north as Upstate New York. Aftermath After the season had ended, the World Meteorological Organization's RA IV Hurricane Committee retired the name Andrew from the list of future names for Atlantic tropical cyclones and replaced it with Alex. The name Andrew will never be used for another Atlantic hurricane again. Bahamas Initially, the Bahamas National Disaster Coordinator believed that foreign aid was not required, but shortly after the storm, the Government of the United Kingdom began distributing blankets, food, ice, and water. , a Royal Navy Type 42 destroyer, was the operational guard ship at the time and assisted in relief operations in and around the Gregorytown area. In addition, assistance came from Canada, Japan, and the United States, as well as the United Nations. The American Red Cross delivered 100 tents, 100 rolls of plastic sheeting, and 1,000 cots. Rebuilding began quickly on the hardest hit islands. However, trees and vegetation were expected to take years to recover. Despite reconstruction efforts and the small number of resort lodgings affected (around 2%), officials expected a 10‚Äì20% decline in tourism. The Bahamian Government, observing that their response mechanisms were not sufficient, reformed the National Emergency and Management Agency. United States After assessing the devastation in Florida and Louisiana, U.S. President George H. W. Bush initially proposed a $7.1 billion aid package to provide disaster benefits, small-business loans, agricultural recovery, food stamps, and public housing for victims of Hurricane Andrew. After the House of Representatives appropriated aid to victims of Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii and Typhoon Omar in Guam, the cost was later increased to $11.1 billion. The bill, which was the most costly disaster aid package at the time, was passed by Congress as House Resolution 5620 on September 18, and signed into law by President Bush on September 23. The state of Florida alone received $9 billion through the disaster relief bill. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was criticized for its slow response in both Florida and Louisiana. Even a month prior to Andrew, the House Committee on Appropriations ‚Äì which oversees the budget for FEMA ‚Äì released a report calling the agency a \\"political dumping ground\\" and a \\"turkey farm\\" due to its \\"weak, inexperienced leaders\\". Congressman S. William Green of New York, a member of the Appropriations Committee, stated that he believed the agency learned little from its botched response to Hurricane Hugo in 1989. However, Green also criticized local officials for expecting \\"them [FEMA] to come and run the whole show\\". Some FEMA officials responded that it was impossible to respond as they had been requested while also continuing to provide aid for the Los Angeles riots. FEMA spokesman Grant Peterson stated, \\"24 hours is not reasonable to expect to have all the resources of the federal government landing in the middle of a disaster.\\" Some responsibility for the slow response must rest with Florida Governor Lawton Chiles, who waited five days to submit the formal request for Federal assistance that FEMA officials believed was required before they were empowered to act. =Florida= In Florida, President Bush assessed damage in areas south of Miami with Florida Governor Lawton Chiles. The president quickly declared the region a disaster area, which provided public assistance to victims of the storm in Broward, Collier, Dade, and Monroe Counties. Lieutenant Governor Buddy MacKay flew over the impact area and described the scene as looking \\"like a war zone\\". Governor Chiles considered asking the Florida State Legislature to raise taxes, stating that \\"No matter how much Congress appropriates to repair damage from Hurricane Andrew, the state will face a substantial cleanup bill\\". Instead of raising taxes, Chiles signed a bill into law on December 17 that created a three-year reserve fund for losses to uninsured businesses and homes, as well as government and school buildings and functions. Additionally, the bill allowed South Floridians to keep an estimated $500 million in sales tax generated by rebuilding efforts. Dade Countyalt=People working to clear debris off of a damaged home Crime, especially looting and theft, rose sharply in the areas south of Miami immediately after Andrew. Reports indicate that merchandise was stolen at damaged or destroyed shopping centers in southern Dade County. Additionally, looting occurred in neighborhoods severely affected by the storm, even in homes where few possessions remained. Initially, the slow response of federal aid prompted Dade County Emergency Management Director Kate Hale to famously exclaim at a nationally televised news conference, \\"Where in the hell is the cavalry on this one? They keep saying we're going to get supplies. For God's sake, where are they?\\" Almost immediately, President Bush promised, \\"Help is on the way,\\" and mobile kitchens, food, and tents, along with over 20,000 units from the Florida Army National Guard (124th Infantry Regiment from Florida); the 24th Infantry Division from Fort Stewart, the 82nd Airborne Division in Fort Bragg, logistcal support soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division from Fort Drum. In order to provide temporary housing for the homeless, military personnel initially set up a total of five tent cities in Florida City and Homestead, while a sixth tent city was opened at the Miccosukee Indian Reservation shortly after Labor Day weekend. The Government of Canada dispatched a team 90 military engineers to repair community centers, hospitals, and schools. Additionally, a crew of 300 military personnel were sent to Miami via HMCS Protecteur to assist American relief teams. The storm struck Florida in the midst of 1992 presidential election campaign. A poll conducted by CBS News in September showed that 65% of Dade County residents approved of Bush's handling of the disaster, while 61% of residents approved statewide. Despite the support of Bush's response and his proposal to rebuild Homestead Air Force Base, he benefited little politically and trailed 48‚Äì42% against Bill Clinton in another poll taken in September. Additionally, 75% of voters in Dade County and 82% of Floridians overall stated that the president's actions in response to Andrew would not impact their vote in November. Bush went on to carry the state of Florida, but by a margin of only 1.89%. The hurricane also impacted Governor Chiles politically. The state's response to the storm was perceived as poor, sinking Chiles' approval rating to 22%, while his disapproval rating rose to 76%. However, Chiles was able to recover prior to the 1994 gubernatorial election. In the aftermath of the storm, extensive psychological effects were documented. Difficulty during clean-up and recovery led to increased divorce rates and a spike in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The cases of PTSD primarily impacted children. A sampling of 378 adolescents by the University of South Carolina's Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics indicated that 3% of males and 9% of females met the criteria for PTSD. Dozens of children in the area attempted suicide, while counselors reported that between 50 and 60 children discussed killing themselves between December 1992 and January 1993. A panel of psychiatrists and psychologists at the University of Miami agreed that as many as 90% of residents in the worst impacted areas would experience at least a few symptoms of PTSD. Within six months, the circumstances related to the aftermath of Andrew led to at least five suicides and four homicides. alt=A heavily damaged home with much of its brick exterior and roof destroyed Although proposals to rebuild Homestead Air Force Base were initially rejected, the United States Department of Defense eventually expended over $100 million to begin repairs. Unsalvageable buildings were demolished. Reconstruction then began on a Florida Air National Guard tower, air traffic control tower, and maintenance hangars. Next, the rebuilding of communications, medical, security facility, vehicle maintenance, and wing headquarters buildings began. On March 5, 1994, the base reopened as Homestead Air Reserve Base. Prior to Andrew, the base employed approximately 6,500 military personnel and 1,000 civilians and annually added about $450 million to the local economy. After its reopening, Major Bobby D'Angelo expected the base to annually contribute less than half of that ‚Äì between $180 million and $200 million. The city of Homestead spent about $6 million on rebuilding the Homestead Sports Complex. Despite this, the Cleveland Indians, fearing the relocation of their more affluent fans, moved their spring training location to Chain of Lakes Park in Winter Haven. As homes were being rebuilt, FEMA provided free temporary mobile homes for 3,501 families and financial assistance to more than 40,000 other families for staying in hotel rooms, paying rent, and repairing homes. Nearly two years after Andrew, about 70% of homes in Homestead that were damaged or destroyed were repaired or rebuilt. Additionally, of the homes destroyed or severely damaged throughout Dade County, 36,000 had been restored by July 1994. More than 930,000 policyholders in South Florida lost coverage after 11 insurance companies went bankrupt, caused by more than 600,000 insurance claims filed. This led the Florida Legislature to create new entities, such as the Joint Underwriting Association, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association, and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, in an effort to restore adequate insurance capacity. Stricter building codes were created in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. A survey by Tim Marshall and Richard Herzog of the Haag Engineer Company in Carrollton, Texas, highlighted several construction issues. On the roof of some homes, the concrete tiles were glued to felt paper, which could easily be ripped by straight line winds. At houses with shingled roofs, it was found that some of the shingles were stapled perpendicular to the long axis, also allowing them to be torn away. After the tiles or shingles were peeled off, the plywood and prefabricated trusses were exposed to the weather. Eventually, the plywood and the trusses suffered structural failure, leading to roof collapses. alt=Aerial view of a large number of temporary housing tents positioned throughout several baseball fields In July 1996, Governor Chiles established the Florida Building Codes Study Commission, with the purpose of assessing the building codes at the time, as well as enacting improvements and reform to the system. The commission study indicated that building codes and regulations were developed, amended, and administered by over 400 local jurisdictions and state agencies. The Florida Building Code was established in 1998 and put into effect by 2002. It phased out local laws and regulations and replaced them with universal statewide building codes. After hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne in 2004, a study conducted by the University of Florida in the following year noted that \\"Homes built under the new Florida Building Code that became effective in 2002 sustained less damage on average than those built between 1994 and 2001.\\" A report by the Florida Legislature in 2006 after hurricanes Dennis, Katrina, and Wilma in 2005 came to a similar conclusion, indicating that \\"they added further evidence that the Florida Building Code is working.\\" The hurricane also transformed the demographics of Dade County. A migration of mostly White families northward to Broward and Palm Beach County was ongoing, but accelerated after Andrew. Many of these families had used the money they received from insurance claims to relocate. The population growth was especially noticeable in southwestern Broward County, where land development was pushed \\"years ahead of schedule\\". Similar migration occurred within the Jewish community. Although there are areas of Dade County that still have significant Jewish populations, many Jews resettled to Coral Springs, west Fort Lauderdale, Hallandale Beach, Plantation, and Tamarac in Broward County and Boca Raton and West Palm Beach in Palm Beach County. The county had a net loss of about 36,000 people in 1992, while Broward and Palm Beach counties gained about 17,000 and 2,300 Dade County residents, respectively. By 2001, 230,710 people had moved from Dade County to Broward County, while 29,125 Dade County residents had moved to Palm Beach County. However, as Broward County became more crowded, 100,871 people relocated from Broward County to Palm Beach County. Consequently, the Hispanic population in south Dade County climbed rapidly. In Homestead, for example, the Latino population increased from 30% to 45% between 1990 and 2000. During the storm, a facility housing Burmese pythons was destroyed, allowing many of them to escape into the Everglades. Although Burmese pythons ‚Äì native to Southeast Asia ‚Äì had been sighted in Everglades National Park since the 1980s, the destruction of this facility contributed significantly to the establishment of breeding populations in Florida. Due to rapid reproduction and ability to prey on many species, the population of Burmese pythons exploded, with possibly as many as 300,000 in the Everglades alone. Efforts have been made to curb the thriving population of these invasive snakes, including a ban on importation of the species to the United States since January 2012 and increased regulations on ownership of a boa constrictor or python. =Louisiana= On August 26, George H. W. Bush toured devastated areas of Louisiana with Governor Edwin Edwards. President Bush remarked, \\"The destruction from this storm goes beyond anything we have known in recent years,\\" but noted that damage was less severe than in Florida. After his visit to Louisiana, President Bush declared only Terrebonne Parish as a disaster area, but later included 34 other parishes under this declaration. FEMA initially opened five field offices throughout Louisiana. These centers allowed residents to submit applications for aid. After Franklin mayor Sam Jones and Congressman Billy Tauzin criticized FEMA for failing to open a field office in Franklin, FEMA promised to do so. In the first few days following the storm, Louisiana National Guard members and local residents worked to remove debris such as downed trees, roofing shingles, and torn aluminum siding. The state National Guard also dispatched water purification units and tanks with filled potable water. About 1,300 National Guardsmen were deployed to southern Louisiana. In early September, officials announced that 1,400 mobile homes, homes, and apartments would become available to residents whose dwellings became uninhabitable. House Resolution 5620 also included disaster aid to the state of Louisiana. In early December, the Small Business Administration (SBA) approved $33.2 million worth of low- interest loans for repairs to homes and businesses. By then, FEMA had received about 43,600 applications for aid, while approving $35.9 million in grants to over 18,000 households that were ineligible for loans from the SBA or were uninsured. In addition to the mobile homes already provided, FEMA spent $22.6 million on disaster housing.

During his tour, he was involved in various ways with the last weeks of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905, and after the decisive Japanese defeat of the Imperial Russian Navy in the Battle of Tsushima Strait in May 1905 units of the Asiatic Fleet escorted three fleeing Russian cruisers into Manila Bay in the Philippine Islands, where he ensured that their crews were well taken care of during a lengthy stay until they were able to return to Russia.Anonoymous, \\"Admiral Train Dies at Che-Foo, China\\", The New York Times, August 4, 1906. In November 1905, Train was at the center of a diplomatic dispute while with a group of American officers on a pheasant-hunting expedition near Nanking, China, when he accidentally shot a Chinese woman with birdshot, inflicting minor injuries on her. A mob of hundreds of Chinese villagers formed around Trains party and attacked it, pushing Train into the mud, seizing the officers guns, and taking Trains son, Navy Lieutenant Charles R. Train, hostage. When 40 United States Marines landed to rescue the officers, the villagers attacked them with pitchforks and the Marines fired two shots. Local Chinese officials refused to return the officers guns, but Train and his companions were able to extricate themselves without further injury to anyone. The governor of Nanking later apologized for the mobs actions, returned the American officers guns, and punished the ringleaders of the mob.Anonoymous, \\"Admiral Train Dies at Che-Foo, China,\\" The New York Times, August 4, 1906.Tenth report of the Secretary of the Class of 1865 of Harvard College, July 1900 to July 1907, Boston: Geo.

Background The song was written by superstar songwriter Diane Warren (who is responsible for many pop hits for other artists). Originally the song was dedicated to AIDS victim Ryan White; however, as an attempt to take advantage of current events, it was rededicated to the troops serving in the Gulf War and became the official USO song.http://nl.newsbank.com/nl- search/we/Archives?p_product=LA&p;_theme=la&p;_action=search&p;_maxdocs=200&p;_topdoc=1&p;_text_direct-0=0EF6120E800D72AF&p;_field_direct-0=document_id&p;_perpage=10&p;_sort=YMD_date:D&s;_trackval=GooglePM The song was released in America and Japan only as a promotional single and was therefore ineligible to chart. Despite the limited release as a single, the song has gained popularity, where the official music video has gained over 780,000 views since June 2009. Although the New Inside album was a commercial failure, the song found further popularity on the 1996 Hip-O American compilation Greatest Hits in America as well as various Japanese compilations. Release In America the song was released as a one-track promotional CD single and cassette via MCA, aiming for radio station play only in 1991.https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/here-in-my-heart-mr0000977432 For the 1990 Japanese promotional single, \\"Here in My Heart\\" was released via WEA Music K.K. as a 3inch CD with a snap-pack picture sleeve design and a promotional sticker on reverse.

The review stated \\"Throughout, Tiffany shows off a new throaty snarl to go along with her powerful pipes, which, unfortunately, sometimes must fight against too many layers of busy production. The simple charm of the album's only true ballad, Diane Warren's \\"Here in My Heart\\", shows that Tiffany's true calling may prove to be country/rock, where her strong, expressive voice (sometimes reminiscent of Brenda Lee) could be shown off to greater advantage.\\" On November 2, 1990, The Fresno Bee reviewed the album, stating \\"There's nothing here that would embarrass somebody like Cher.

Milton Johnson. Milton Johnson (born May 15, 1950) is an American serial killer who committed up to ten known murders in Will County, Illinois. An abundance of evidence linked him to the crimes, including the murder of two police officers. Murders=The Murders of Officers Denis Foley and Stephen Mayer On Saturday July 16, 1983, at approximately 3:25 a.m. at 147th and Gougar Road, Will County Auxiliary Sergeant Denis Foley and Auxiliary Deputy Stephen Mayer were mortally wounded in an ambush slaying. The deputies had been shot in what they thought was going to be a routine stop to help a motorist. They stopped to assist the driver of a pickup truck. The rear of the truck was blocking part of the road, while its front bumper was up against a red car parked in a rutted turn-around area. As the officers approached, their assailant said, \\"We need a jump.\\" When the officers exited their vehicle, the gunman suddenly shot both of them. Mayer died shortly after being shot; Foley was seriously wounded in the throat. A few minutes later another car came around the curve and slowed down. The gunman opened up on them. The driver was killed; a female passenger was shot six times. The car rolled on down the road and into a bean field. Wounded and frightened, the female went looking for help. The deputies were in trouble but they couldn't be found and other officers were frantically searching in the darkness of rural Homer Township. Between 3:25 a.m. and 3:40 a.m., county police officers searched for Foley and Mayer. Sergeant Foley, badly injured from one bullet that had shattered his mouth and teeth, attempted to speak over the police radio microphone. Most of his words were garbled. He couldn't give his location. He was instructed to turn on his siren and shine his spotlight in the air. Meanwhile, a young farmer who lived in the area called county police to say he could hear gunfire and sirens near his land. Officers met the citizen and less than a minute later, the site of the ambush was located behind his fields on the rural road. After finding the two auxiliary deputies, responding units located the bodies of a 25-year-old female, and a 30-year-old male who had been in the car parked in front of the pickup truck. The auxiliary officers' guns and wallets were missing. Mayer's body had been dragged across the gravel road and left in a ditch. In a reconstruction of the crime scene, it was determined that before he died, Mayer, as he leaned on 301A, had attempted to flag down the last car that was also ambushed. \\"Stop! Stop!\\" he had called out. As he was calling for help, the gunman had zigzagged between the front of the pickup truck and the squad car firing shots at the car. The female survivor saw a man in a uniform shirt shouting at them. She thought the officer was shooting at them.http://www.odmp.org/officer/4970-auxiliary-sergeant-denis-p-foley The victims of this attack included George Kiehl, 24, Cathleen Norwood, 25, Richard Paulin, 30, and the two sheriff's deputies were Denis Foley, 50, and Steven Mayer, 22. Laura Troutman, George Kiehl's passenger, 21, was also shot multiple times, but managed to escape the attack and find help by crawling north towards Lemont Road. No one would ever be convicted of the murder of Foley and Mayer. The murder of Anthony Hackett On July 16, 1983, Patricia Payne and her boyfriend, Anthony Hackett, drove from their hometown of Emden, Illinois, and spent the day at Six Flags Great America Amusement Park in Gurnee, Illinois. That day, Hackett bought a stuffed doll depicting the popular Tasmanian Devil character; he placed the receipt for the doll in his wallet. Around 10 p.m., Payne and Hackett left the park and, on the way home, they stopped Hackett's car along Interstate 55 in Will County to sleep. Hackett slept in the front seat; Payne slept in the back. Around 1:30 a.m. on July 17, Payne awoke to tapping on the passenger-side window followed by gunshots which struck and killed Hackett. The assailant opened the passenger- side door and ordered Payne to give him Hackett's wallet and her purse. He then ordered Payne to crawl from the car and into a pickup truck parked nearby. The assailant climbed into the truck and drove down the interstate. While driving, the assailant sexually assaulted Payne; after exiting the interstate and stopping the truck, he raped her. The assailant again started to drive, but pulled the truck onto the shoulder of the road 10 minutes later. The assailant then stabbed Payne in the chest and dumped her from the truck. Payne was found on the grassy median an hour later at 5:30 a.m. by a passing motorist. She had no pulse or blood pressure, and she was rushed to a Joliet hospital, where doctors performed emergency surgery. Payne survived. Later that morning, Special Agent John Meduga of the Illinois Department of Law Enforcement (now known as the Illinois State Police) spoke with Payne. Payne indicated to Meduga that her assailant was an African American man with no observable facial hair. Eight days later, Payne looked through approximately 1,500 mugshots and selected 42 photographs of persons with facial characteristics similar to her assailant, 34 of whom had facial hair. The record does not reveal whether the defendant's photograph was chosen by Payne. More than a month later, Payne looked through 137 mugshots, including one of the defendant, and selected four photographs of persons with facial hair and facial characteristics similar to her assailant. Payne did not choose the defendant's photograph.http://www.state.il.us/Court/Opinions/SupremeCourt/2002/May/Opinions/Html/85134.htm Investigation The police investigation of these crimes stalled until information that Ann Shoemaker telephoned the Will County sheriff's office in August 1983 was turned over to the State Police in February 1984. Shoemaker described an incident in which a dark pickup truck had played cat and mouse game with her while she was driving one night in July 1983. She and a friend followed the truck and recorded its license plate number. After seeing the driver was not someone they knew, they tried to get away. On March 6, 1984, she gave this number to the police, who traced it to a truck owned by Sam Myers, Johnson's stepfather. After Myers signed a consent form, the police searched the truck and found Caucasian head hairs similar to Payne's hair, bloodstains, a steak knife, reddish brown fibers, and a sales receipt for a Tasmanian Devil stuffed doll. Based on these items, the police obtained a search warrant for Myers' residence, where the defendant lived. The police seized three .357 Magnum cartridges from a dresser in Myers' bedroom. Also on March 6, 1984, Payne looked at five mugshots. Johnson's photograph was the only one among the five which Payne had seen on September 6, 1983. After several minutes, Payne tentatively identified the defendant as her assailant. On March 9, Payne viewed a six-person lineup. After each person in the lineup repeated commands that the assailant had given Payne on the night of her ordeal, Payne unmistakably identified the defendant as her assailant.http://www.state.il.us/Court/Opinions/SupremeCourt/2002/May/Opinions/Html/85134.htm Trial Initially, the Will County public defender was appointed to represent the defendant. On June 1, 1984, the day before the scheduled trial date, William Swano entered his appearance as the defendant's retained attorney. The trial court granted Swano three continuances, totaling 55 days, and set the trial date for July 26, 1984. The defendant moved for a change of venue, citing negative pretrial publicity in Will County, and the trial court transferred the case to Iroquois County. Following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of the first degree murder of Hackett, as well as the aggravated kidnapping, deviate sexual assault, rape, and attempted murder of Payne. The defendant waived his right to a sentencing jury, and the trial court found the defendant eligible for the death penalty. The trial court further found no mitigating circumstances sufficient to preclude the death penalty and sentenced the defendant to death for Hackett's murder and to concurrent terms of 40 years' imprisonment for deviate sexual assault, rape, and attempted murder. On direct appeal, this court affirmed the defendant's convictions and sentences. See People v. Johnson, 114 Ill. 2d 170 (1986). Johnson then filed a pro se post-conviction petition in the Will County circuit court, alleging that he received ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal and in post-conviction proceedings. The trial court granted the state's motion to dismiss the petition. On appeal, they affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court held that the trial court properly dismissed Johnson's claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, but that the trial court improperly dismissed Johnson's claim relating to his post-conviction attorney's performance. See People v. Johnson, 154 Ill. 2d 227 (1993).http://www.dcbabrief.org/vol110199art6.html Johnson is serving his sentence in Menard Correctional Center.

The locomotives were converted for 1500 V DC use in the 1930s, and renumbered PO E.281 to E.293. They were absorbed by the SNCF, and operated as shunters until the late 1960s. History At the end of the 19th century the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris √† Orl√©ans (PO) was seeking to extend its railway into a more central location in Paris: an extension from the Gare de Austerlitz to the new Gare du Quai d'Orsay was constructed, including covered sections; the new section was similar to the recently constructed Baltimore Belt Line (USA), constructed by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) and operated by electric locomotives built by General Electric, which had worked well, and achieved speeds of 80 km/h. Eight locomotives were ordered for the new line, delivered between 1900 and 1904, numbered E1 to E8, with electrical equipment from GE, and mechanical equipment and structural parts manufactured by Blanc-Misseron. The line was electrified by 600 V DC, supplied by a third rail, with overhead collection via a mini-pantograph in the Orsay tunnel. Unlike the B&O; locomotives the PO units used geared drive, rather than the co-axial gearless motor drive of the 1896 B&O; machines.Exposition Universelle Interantionale de 1900 √† Paris : Groupe VI : G√©nie civil : Moyens de transport : Troisi√®me partie.

Further units were acquired as the system's electrification spread beyond the initial Orsay- Austerlitz line; five units were acquired, with a twin cab design, with a baggage compartment (locomotives-fourgon). In service the locomotives were used throughout the PO system where electrified; the initial specifications of the design, matching those used for the tunnel shuttle service on the Baltimore Belt Line were too low geared for the general network, and in 1904 seven locomotives were upgeared and the top speed raised to 100 km/h. In the late 1920s/1930s 1500 V DC began to be used on the PO rail system; the locomotives were converted for 1500 V operation at workshops at Vitry-sur- Seine using a Metadyne for traction control. A new pantograph as well as sand boxes were added. After conversion the class were renumbered E.281 to E.293. During the second half of the units operational life they were used for shunting at depots to the southwest of Paris. In 1949 the units were renumbered BB 1280 to BB 1293 as part of the SNCF.

Eyewitnesses who visited museum in the early 19th century proved that museum, accept the ancient archaeological sites, has contained minerals, shells, stuffed animals, ethnographic exhibits. Also there were maps, plans of cities, buildings and ship models. The collection was traditional for that time ‚Äì here the natural artifacts were located near the ancient. In 30 years of 19th century the objects from the museum were transmitted to Odessa, Kherson and Kerch, and only a small part of the exhibits remained in Mykolaiv Region. In February 1912, the descendants of Emmanuel Frantsov who died in 1909 and who was the owner of the unique natural science collections approached to the council of Mykolaiv. According to his will, this collection was presented to the city, but before that several requirements should have been fulfilled ‚Äì to provide the space for collection's preservation. The Mykolaiv duma established a special commission the members of which were Duma's speakers and well-known public figures. S.I. Gaiduchenko was selected as the Head of the commission. On Sunday, 15 December 1913, during the opening ceremony of the museum Mayor M. Leontovich, the representatives of the city's Duma and numerous guests were presented. The first director of the museum was S. I. Gaiduchenko. After the opening, a lot of things had changed: the funds had received new items of archeology, interesting documentary sources, photographs, weapons, objects of ethnography and numismatics. The natural collection also had filled up. The city's government had given a certain amount of money for buying antiquities. The financial book for the years 1913‚Äì1916, which is stored in the archives of the museum, contained the bills and receipts with the list of purchased items. In 1916 ‚Äì 1917, S. I. Gaiduchenko together with A. D. Petraschuk traveled to the Grand Duke Mykola Mykolajovych estate to the Katerynoslav province. From that place they brought the Cossack overgrave cross, \\"stone women\\", archeological items, stuffed birds and animals. In June 1918, the 58th Prague Infantry Regiment was decided to be a part of the museum. Despite the rough events of the February Revolution and the Civil War the museum continued to develop. In 1920, the work of Olbian expedition was organized because of the initiative of local government. So with the help of this the archaeological museum collection was enriched in 1634 items. From that time the museum itself became known as the historical and archaeological. Natural collection became a separate museum. After the death of S. I. Gaiduchenko, F. T. Kaminsky ‚Äì archaeologist, expert on the history of the land, popularizer of the ancient monuments ‚Äì became the director of the museum (May 1923). Feodosij Kaminsky cooperated with B. V. Farmakovskyi, the famous archaeologist, director of the Olbian expedition, B. V. Farmakovskyi. From 1925, he was taking part in the expedition and was involved in the creation of archaeological preserve \\"Olbia\\". All the materials from excavations were sent to the museum's collection. F. T. Kaminsky made an important contribution into conservation of other historical monuments of the region. Museum required a new space for the exposition, and F. T. Kaminsky started to look for the new place. In March 1929, the ceremonial opening of the new exposition of the museum took place on the Soviet Square. But six months later, the museum's director, tireless researcher F. T. Kaminsky, was accused for being a member of the Union for the Freedom of Ukraine process, and had been in Joseph Stalin's camps for 25 years. The terrible repressions didn't omit the other museum's staff. The prominent local historian and scholar M. D. Lahuta was also arrested. The museum's exhibition in 30-s has become very politicized. This event reduced the level of it perception. In 1936, because of the reconstruction of Soviet Square the museum moved to the building on the Dekabristiv Street, 32. In the early 1940s, the new departments opened in the museum: Olbia, feudalism, the history of Mykolaiv and the history of weapons, which exhibited the Turkish guns of the 17th century, guns of the period of the Russian-Turkish war of the 18th century. After the liberation of Mykolaiv, the museum's workers presented the new exposition and restored exhibits. The museum was required by the citizens who survived after a terrible war and did not lose interest to the history and nature of native land. In November 1950, the unification of historical and natural history museums into Mykolayiv Regional Museum of Local History took place. The so-called \\"school room\\" was created for the natural collections. Here the items from the famous collection of E. P. Frantsova were displayed: minerals, corals, stuffed animals, birds, fish and even a few anomalies. The exhibition was called \\"school room\\" because it exhibits served as didactic material for the study of botany, zoology, geography, chemistry, mineralogy. In 1960‚Äì1990, a lot of changes existed. One by one the collecting expedition in other cities of USSR were conducted. The new museums were opened at schools, in towns and villages of Mykolaiv. The workers of the museum staff provided them with methodological and practical assistance. The regional museum had become more developed because of the enlargement of its departments. In 1972, the Ochakiv Military and History Museum by Alexander Suvorov was opened. From 1973 to 1985, Vira Cherniavska had been the Headed of the museum. During her leadership the museum has acquired a certain prestige not only in the Mykolaiv region, but also abroad. New departments were opened and new exposition was conducted. Museum today Today, Mykolayiv Regional Museum of Local History ‚ÄúStaroflotski Barracks‚Äù is often visited. More than 180 thousands of items are exhibited here. First of all, there is a unique collection of natural, archaeological objects, started from the late Paleolithic period, and the Cossack's era, a collection of ancient books, objects of worship, ethnography, numismatics, weapons, etc. The significant contribution to the Mykolaiv museum was made by Liudmyla Hlopynska, an honored worker of the Ukraine's culture, a laureate of the Shevchenko National Prize. All her creative life was dedicated to the museum. She was a researcher and a head of the Museum of Shipbuildingeet and a Director of Mykolayiv Regional Museum of Local History. During her leadership the complex of Staroflotski barracks were brought to the museum. They were built by the architect K. Ackroyd in the middle of the 19th century. Since 2012, the museum was moved to a new place. It is situated on the place where old Staroflotski barracks were founded. It is located on Admiralska Street near the Building College. The museum is expected to be opened on 22 September 2012. See also *Mykolaiv *The V. V.

The cross was of similar design to the medal displaying the same obverse and reverse except that it was in the form of a cross patt√©e. The Yser Cross was issued as a replacement to the earlier Yser Medal upon application and payment of a fee, consequently relatively few were issued as few veterans wanted to trade in their medal, and even fewer wanted to pay the fee. The Yser Medal and the Yser Cross could not be worn together, it was one or the other.

Established on 6 November 1874, it is a heritage law firm with a history of more than 140 years. Today, the firm is a medium-sized full-service law practice. History of the Firm=The Founders The Firm's founders, Messrs Alexander Muirhead Aitken, Alexander Leathes Donaldson and John Burkinshaw, were British expatriates who had come to Singapore in the 19th century when the island was a British Crown Colony. At the time, the development of Singapore Colony's legal profession, jurisprudence and public life was still in its early stages. The Colony's population then consisted mainly of native Malays, and Chinese and Indian immigrants, who worked as fishermen, rubber-tappers, merchants, coolies, warehouse and port workers, and laborers. The Founders would leave their mark as outstanding members of the legal profession, as stated in Roland Braddell et al ‚ÄòOne Hundred Years of Singapore‚Äô:'One Hundred Years of Singapore', Braddell, Roland St. John; Brooke, Gilbert Edward; Makepeace, Walter (London: Murray), at pages 204, 225 - 226.

Subsequently, in 1907, the Bar Committee was made a statutory body by the Courts Ordinance, providing the genesis for the modern Law Society of Singapore.left The Jeddah, 1881 The Jeddah[1881] KY 24 - The Jeddah was a high-profile admiralty suit involving the abandonment of a steamship, the S.S. Jeddah, by her captain and crew. The S.S. Jeddah was carrying about 778 men, 147 women and 67 children on board, in addition to considerable cargoes, at the time of her abandonment. Alexander Leathes Donaldson and John Burkinshaw both acted for the salvor, the S.S. Antenor. The abandonment, salvage of and subsequent litigation surrounding the S.S. Jeddah would later inspire Joseph Conrad to pen his epic novel, ‚ÄúLord Jim‚Äù, first published as a serial in Blackwood's Magazine from October 1899 to November 1900. The novel has since been made twice into films bearing the same title, ‚ÄòLord Jim‚Äô, in 1925 (Paramount Pictures, directed by Victor Fleming), and 1965 (Columbia Pictures, directed by Richard Brooks). The Second World War By the time of the Second World War, the Firm boasted an impressive list of banks, companies and merchants in Singapore as its clientele. However, this flourishing practice was interrupted by the outbreak of hostilities, at which time the Firm's documents and deeds were fortuitously preserved at the Singapore Supreme Court, thanks to the timely efforts of some senior staff members. An account of the dramatic events can be found in a memoir, ‚ÄòFifty Years with Donaldson & Burkinshaw‚Äô,'Fifty Years with Donaldson & Burkinshaw', Norman Sylvester Hogan, 1971 by Mr. Norman Sylvester Hogan, an administrator who served the Firm for 50 years and retired in 1970.219x219px The Post-War Years, to the 1970s After the War, the Firm continued to dominate the local legal arena as one of Singapore's top law firms. Its leaders continued to wield considerable influence in the early politico-legal developments of modern Singapore. When the 1954 Constitutional Commission of Singapore (better known as the Rendel Commission) was appointed by Governor Sir John Nicoll in July 1953 to undertake a comprehensive review of the constitution of the Colony, Mr. C F Smith, a senior partner of the Firm, was one of the Commission's non-official members. Following the independence of Singapore from British Rule, the Firm maintained offices in Malaysia at Johor and Kuala Lumpur, and in Sabah at Jesselton (now known as Kota Kinabalu) and Sandakan until the Promulgation of the Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance No. 30 of 1970. During this time, lawyers who were neither citizens nor permanent residents were barred from practising in West Malaysia. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Firm continued to attract and retain significant legal talent. Its senior partners Antony Purdon Godwin and Wu Chang-Sheng became prominent figures at the Singapore Litigation Bar. Wu Chang-Sheng, son of renowned plague-fighter Dr. Wu Lien-teh (himself credited with modernising China's medical services and medical education), was particularly renowned for his expertise in construction arbitration. Godwin and Wu were also founding members of the Council of the Singapore Advocates and Solicitors Society (which subsequently became the Law Society of Singapore) in 1967.

They were married in 1978. They have three children together. Schlegel received his bachelor's degree in biological sciences from Rutgers University in 1968. After graduating, he went on to enroll at Northwestern University, where he planned to study pediatrics. However, after working at a microbiology laboratory at Northwestern University the summer after his first year, he decided instead to enroll in the MD-PhD program. After graduating, Schlegel went to Harvard University in 1975 to serve his residency and perform postdoctoral research in pathology. Career Following his work at Harvard University, Schlegel and his wife both began working at the National Institutes of Health. Schlegel worked in the National Cancer Institute's Laboratory of Molecular Biology, and there he began precursory work that would contribute to his later development of the HPV vaccine. He first studied a bovine papillomavirus, then focused on the E5, E6, and E7 proteins of the human papillomavirus. In 1988, Schlegel began working with A. Bennett Jenson, a member of the Georgetown University faculty. When Schlegel began working as an associate professor at Georgetown University in 1990, their work gained momentum. In 1995, they published a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that demonstrated that their vaccine could protect against a virus like that seen in cervical cancer. The main patent on the vaccine was granted in 2005, and the Food and Drug Administration approved it in June 2006. In 2003, Schlegel became the Chair of the Department of Pathology at Georgetown University. He currently is working to create an inexpensive and easily transported version of the HPV vaccine for use in developing countries, where deaths from cervical cancer are most prevalent. Schlegel has also mentioned his interest in creating a vaccine that is effective both before and after infection with HPV. Schlegel has been an associate editor of Virology since 1990. He is a permanent member of the Virology study section of the National Institutes of Health. In 2006, he was awarded the Georgetown University President's Medal. In 2011, Georgetown University awarded him the Patrick Healy Award. He recently received the President‚Äôs Award for Distinguished Scholar-Teaching at Georgetown University.

It originally aired on The WB in the United States on January 26, 2006, and on E4 in the United Kingdom on March 27, 2006. The episode was written by Kelly Souders and Brian Peterson, and directed by Greg Beeman. The series follows the adventures of the young Clark Kent (Tom Welling) in the town of Smallville, Kansas, before he becomes Superman. In this episode, Clark reveals his secret to Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk), but there are consequences. Jonathan Kent (John Schneider) and Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) learn the results of the senatorial election and the life of someone Clark loves is taken from him. There were originally two potential plotlines for the episode before it was decided that one of the main characters would be killed. This concept was positively received by studio executives. Schneider also approved of the idea, and compared his departure to that of John Wayne in The Cowboys. Jonathan Kent's death was used to emphasize the theme that Clark has to accept the consequences of his decisions. So as to keep Jonathan Kent's death a secret, the script was given to fewer people, and the network issued promotional trailers that featured the possible deaths of both Lana and Jonathan. Upon its premiere, \\"Reckoning\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 2.2, and was watched by approximately 6.28 million viewers in the United States; along with an estimated 375,000 viewers in the United Kingdom. The episode received generally positive reviews from commentators, who felt that Jonathan's death was both emotional and pivotal. One faction of fans was unhappy with the choice of Jonathan, however, as they would have preferred Lana dying instead. Plot Clark Kent (Tom Welling) sits in his loft holding a piece of coal, waiting for Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) to arrive. Clark expresses fear that Lana is drifting away because of his secret, so he decides to reveal his powers to her. Clark takes her to the Kawatche Caves, where they are then transported to the Fortress of Solitude. Lana is in shock as she looks around at the Fortress. Clark then uses the coal to make a diamond ring and proposes marriage. Afterward, Clark reveals what he did to his parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (John Schneider and Annette O'Toole), who tell him that he is old enough to make decisions on his own without the advice of his father. After some initial doubt, Lana returns to the Kent farm to accept Clark's proposal. Lois Lane (Erica Durance) holds an election party for Jonathan at the Talon, where his supporters learn that he has defeated Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) in the Kansas State Senate race. Lana gets a call from Lex and meets him at his mansion. After seeing Lana's engagement ring, Lex realizes that Lana knows Clark's secret and reacts aggressively. Lana leaves, but Lex follows her in an attempt to apologize. Distracted, she does not see an approaching school bus; she strikes the bus with her car and is killed in the accident. Clark realizes that Lana's life is the price that Jor-El (Terence Stamp) promised to collect when he resurrected Clark in \\"Hidden\\". However, Jor-El provides a crystal that will allow Clark to reset the day, but warns him that the universe will find someone else's life to exchange for Lana's. When Clark takes the crystal, he is sent back to the moment that Lana appeared in his barn. This time, Clark decides not to reveal his secret, which causes Lana to break up with him. Upset, Clark goes to Metropolis and tells Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) everything, including how he had already lived the day, and his proposal to Lana. Chloe promises to keep an eye on Lana to prevent her from dying once more. At the election party, Lana arrives with Chloe, but she once again leaves again when Lex calls. This time Lex kisses her when he learns of her break up, which causes Lana to leave. Like before, Lex pursues Lana, but this time Clark arrives in time to stop the bus. Jonathan goes to the farm after receiving a mysterious call during the party, and is greeted by Lionel Luthor (John Glover). Lionel insinuates he knows Clark's secret and shows a picture to Jonathan, which causes Jonathan to begin punching Lionel in anger. Jonathan dismisses Lionel and laboriously walks away, breathing heavily. Martha and Clark drive up and catch him as he has a heart attack. After taking a final look at his family, Jonathan dies in the arms of Martha and Clark. At Jonathan's funeral, all of Clark's close friends attend, as well as the Luthors. When the funeral is over, Clark picks up a handful of dirt and sprinkles it into his father's grave. Production=Writing Originally, the writers developed two potential plotlines for the episode: one in which Clark and Lana would get married, and another in which one of Clark's parents would die. The producers eventually chose only to kill one of the parents. The producers also debated the idea of other characters dying, but realized that none would have as much resonance as one of Clark's parents. Once the basic plot was decided, a group of Smallville writers used whiteboards to flesh out the story, and the details were arranged. After the main story line was developed, the supervising producers presented it to several of the executive vice presidents at The WB Television Network. The executives enjoyed the story: Michael Roberts, a senior executive, called the episode's plot \\"great\\" and noted that \\"the conceit is really cool\\". John Schneider, who portrayed Jonathan Kent, argued that his character left the show \\"like a hero\\". According to writers Kelly Souders and Brian Peterson, \\"Reckoning\\" had been chosen as the episode's title before the script had been finalized. Peterson explained that the theme revolved around the idea that \\"you reap what you sow\\". This idea was an expansion of the theme from \\"Hidden\\", in which Clark was resurrected by his biological father Jor-El, only to be informed that the life of someone he loves would be exchanged in the future as payment for bringing Clark back. Peterson expounded further that the plot of the episode would show that \\"Clark is not God\\". According to Souders, Jonathan Kent's death had been requested by executive producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar at the \\"beginning of the season\\", and that the idea was specifically planned to be featured in the show's 100th episode. Gough explained that the reason Jonathan Kent was chosen to die was because \\"going into season five, this is the year the boy becomes the man, so at some point the mentor/father figure has to die, in order for Clark to ultimately step up and really embrace his destiny.\\" Schneider was happy with how the show wrote Jonathan Kent's death, arguing that his character exited the show \\"like a hero\\". Furthermore, he drew comparisons to the death of John Wayne's character Wil Anderson in The Cowboys (1972), arguing that both were examples of \\"empowering death[s].\\" Originally, a scene had been shot featuring Clark bringing his father's dead body to the Fortress of Solitude. However, the scene was ultimately cut because, according to Gough, \\"It was something that sounded great on paper, but it felt like a bit of a stutter step in the episode.\\" Gough later called the scene \\"morbid\\". Once the rough script was formulated it was sent to Gough and Millar for additional notes. Next, drafts were sent to the production studio and the network, who also made notes. Finally, Souders and Peterson re-wrote the episode; the script went through 10 drafts. The final version was finished \\"two-and-a-half [to] three weeks\\" before production began. Normally a script for a Smallville episode would go to about 40 different people, including \\"sets, props, and wardrobe\\", but because the episode featured the death of a major character, the production staff and writers kept it \\"top secret\\". In fact, the script for the episode was printed on red paper in an attempt to keep it \\"under wraps\\". Filming upright Director Greg Beeman found shooting the episode difficult because he had recently lost his father; he noted, \\"I left from his funeral to go to Vancouver to direct the episode, so the emotions were very poignant for me.\\" Souders stated that the production staff wanted the climactic scene of Lana's death to be a \\"big event\\". Originally, the show's producers wanted the car accident to be caused by a train. However, the show was not able to afford the special effects to pull the scene off, and so, the sequence was re-written to feature a bus crash. Souders noted that if the show had been unable to afford the bus wreck, it would have been re-written into a \\"little car wreck\\". The Lana's entire sequence death was choreographed by Christopher Sayour‚Äîseries stunt coordinator and Welling's stunt double.Simpson, Paul, pp. 54‚Äì57 Sayour described the scene as \\"important to me and important to a lot of people\\". The car crash sequence itself was actually a collage of several different shots. First, Kreuk was filmed driving a car on a process trailer with a mounted camera. A separate shot was filmed with a stunt double driving a lead car that was attached to a dummy car driving down a road at high speed. A bus was then driven in a perpendicular direction. The dummy car was attached with a detonator so that when the bus hit it, it would detach and not pull the lead car with it, and the timing for the crash was practiced several times during rehearsals. Finally, after the car was smashed by the bus, Kreuk was positioned on the ground to give the effect that she was actually in the car wreck. During filming, artificial snow had to be continuously shoveled on the sets because the cast and crew kept trampling through it. Steve Oben, the costume set supervisor for the series, jokingly called the Fortress of Solitude the \\"Fortress of Styrofoam\\" and explained that a huge hurdle for the scenes in the fortress was to make sure that the synthetic snow would not stick to the actors during filming. Broadcast and reception \\"Reckoning\\" originally aired in the United States on January 26, 2006 on The WB. The network promoted the episode with videos of \\"snowy coffins\\" suggesting that either Lana or Jonathan would die. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 2.2, meaning that roughly 2.2 percent of all television-equipped households were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 6.28 million viewers and ranked as the seventy-first most‚Äìwatched episode of the week. The episode was the second-most watched fifth season episode, after the earlier entry, \\"Aqua\\", which was seen by 6.40 million viewers. It aired in the United Kingdom on E4 on March 27, 2006 and reached 375,000 viewers, making it the fourth most‚Äìwatched program that week. Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e March 27‚ÄìApril 2, 2006\\", listed under E4 \\"Reckoning\\" received mostly positive reviews from commentators. Various critics felt that the death of Jonathan Kent was a poignantly emotional choice, although others expressed their desire that Lang would have died. This was especially true for fans, who angrily opined their views on various Smallville fan sites. Michael Ausiello from TV Guide wrote, \\"Watch ['Reckoning'] because it's one of the best hours of TV this season and I'm not even a big Smallville fan.\\" Vic Holtreman from Screenrant gave the episode a largely positive review and called it \\"a great episode overall\\". He called the scenes leading up to the funeral \\"quite moving\\" and noted that the loss of Jonathan Kent was a blow, not only for the series' main characters, but also for the audience itself. However, Holtreman mocked the \\"old moon-pie eye‚Äôd Clark/Lana situation\\" and the fact that \\"Lana didn't die\\". Omar Gallaga from Television Without Pity gave the episode a B and wrote that the death of Jonathan Kent \\"still stings\\". Chris Carabott from TV Fanatic named the episode the second best Smallville episode (coming after ninth season entry \\"Absolute Justice\\"), and he wrote that \\"The death of Jonathan Kent is one of the most pivotal moments of Smallville.\\" Carabott also opined that the ramifications of the episode helped to \\"shape [Clark into] the man he has become\\". Michael Duffy, in the chapter \\"Sacrifice or Salvation? Smallville's Heroic Survival amid Changing Television Trends\\" of the book called The Smallville Chronicles: Critical Essays on the Television Series, called the episode \\"momentous\\". Furthermore, he argued that the presence of clips at Jonathan's funeral from \\"Reckoning\\" in the eighth season premiere \\"Odyssey\\" helped to \\"subtly resituate and creatively reboot the Smallville universe\\" during the show's later life.Duffy 2011, p. 162 The production staff for Smallville were very happy with the finished result. Gough and Millar wrote that the episode was a \\"tour de force of writing, directing, and acting.\\" Allison Mack called the entry \\"thrilling and exciting\\". Producer Rob Maier was particularly proud of the final cut, noting, \\"The highlight of season five was the hundredth episode ['Reckoning']. It was a remarkable show.\\" Welling, however, found that Schneider's departure from the series was \\"bittersweet\\".

Original construction is in a colonial revival style and the interior was remodeled in an art deco style in 1928. Louden sold the property in 1948, and it was broken into apartments in the 1960s. The house was built in 1905 and was the residence of R. Bruce and May W. Louden until 1948. The house is within walking distance of the Louden Machinery Company, as it was the custom at the time for factory owners to be close to their properties. He was the third president of the company in Fairfield from 1940 to 1951, when he was killed in an auto accident. . During that period the company produced overhead handling equipment for American industries during World War II. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. R. Bruce Louden was president of Louden Machinery Company when the firm was contracted to build the assembly line for the world's first [atom bomb], and also the [B-29 bomber], during World War II. The atom bomb assembly line project was so secret that Louden was never told of it during construction, and liaison with the Manhattan Project was through Louden Vice President R. R. Louden, as per one of Louden's grandchildren. In its heyday, Louden Machinery Company was one of the world's largest farm equipment manufacturers and was the largest shipper on the Rock Island Railroad. The founder, William Louden, was a prolific inventor with many inventions to his credit. His hay handling system (the first major invention)was a pulley system on a monorail used to move hay in the mow of the barn, and was the first commercially successful monorail system in the world. The Billy Sunday Connection In 1907, world-famous evangelist Billy Sunday held one of his early revivals next to the Louden home, according to local author and historian Susan Fulton. Fulton designates the location as five blocks due west of the Presbyterian church, which is the location of the Louden home. Records were kept of the Fairfield Revival altar call, and 1,018 people came to the altar during the week of the event. When the revival was through, the Revival tabernacle was torn down and re-constructed in , where it served the community for many years until a windstorm destroyed it in the 1930s. Wood from the ruined tabernacle was then used to construct the gazebo on the city square. So the Fairfield Revival Gazebo still stands in the center of the square to this day. Sunday, a native of Ames, Iowa, had been a professional baseball player first for the Chicago White Stockings, then for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys and the Philadelphia Phillies. Hall of Famer Cap Anson was his first coach and mentor. In his final season he had an infinite(0.00) earned run average (ERA) with Pittsburgh. But he left his stellar career in 1890 for the ministry. A Presbyterian and a confirmed ‚Äòdry,‚Äô he became one of the national leaders in the drive for Prohibition. It is said that he preached to over 100 million people in his career in the days before television and most radio. Sunday's Revival tabernacle in Fairfield was not his first. His marketing technique was to build a wooden tabernacle prior to the revival event‚Äîessentially a large wood barn with board bench seats and a sawdust floor. The tabernacle would then become both the forum and the advertising medium as questions about the large construction project would bubble up in the community. Sunday repeated the technique during early revival events throughout Iowa and Illinois. The property has been restored over the years by Bob Krause and his late wife Maryann Mills-Krause (passed in 2005) and by his present wife, Vicky Matthiessen Krause.

Carrie is a CIA officer who, while on assignment in Iraq, learned from a CIA asset that an American prisoner of war had been turned by al-Qaeda. After a U.S. Marine sergeant named Nicholas Brody is rescued from captivity, Mathison believes that he is the POW described to her. Carrie's investigation of Brody is complicated by her bipolar disorder and results in an obsession with her suspect. For her performance as Mathison, Claire Danes has received several major acting awards, including the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Television Series Drama, the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series, the Satellite Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Television Series Drama, and the TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Drama. She is the second actress to win all the five main TV acting awards for her performance in the Lead Drama Actress categories.  Character biography = Background and personality  Carrie Anne Mathison was an Arabic language student at Princeton University, where she was recruited into the CIA by veteran officer Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin). Carrie developed a close working relationship with Saul, and is implied to have had a sexual relationship with CTC Director David Estes (David Harewood), her future boss, which contributed to the breakup of his marriage. In college, Carrie was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, for which she secretly began taking clozapine supplied by her older sister, Maggie (Amy Hargreaves). As a field operative in Iraq, Carrie infiltrated a prison to meet with an imprisoned CIA asset named Hasan Ibrahim, who claimed that he had information regarding an imminent terrorist attack in the United States. Moments before his execution, Hasan told Carrie that an American prisoner of war was turned by al-Qaeda figure Abu Nazir (Navid Negahban). Carrie's unauthorized dealings with Hasan led to an international incident, causing Estes to have her reassigned to the CIA's Counterterrorism Center in Langley, Virginia.  Season 1  Ten months after her reassignment, Carrie attends an emergency staff meeting and learns that Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), a U.S. Marine sergeant, has been rescued after eight years in terrorist captivity. Carrie tells Saul about Hasan's claims, and expresses concern that Brody is the POW he was describing. With the CIA having no cause to investigate Brody, Carrie conducts her own unauthorized surveillance using a one-month FISA warrant delivered by Saul. Initially, Carrie finds no evidence of Brody's involvement with terrorism. When her FISA warrant expires, Carrie takes to making personal contact with Brody instead. She bumps into Brody at a veterans' support group, where they strike up a conversation and immediately bond over their mutual experiences in the Middle East. Brody asks Carrie to have a drink with him one night, culminating in a drunken sexual encounter in Carrie's car. The next day, he is brought in to Langley for a polygraph test over the apparent suicide of Afsal Hamid (Waleed Zuaiter), a detained terrorist with whom Brody had a violent confrontation. Carrie, suspicious of Brody's replies, orders the interviewer to ask if he has ever been unfaithful to his wife. Brody says \\"no\\", beating the polygraph. Afterwards, Carrie and Brody drive to her family's secluded cabin to spend the weekend together. However, after Brody realizes Carrie has been spying on him, she forces him to admit to his conversion to Islam, his meeting with and personal affection for Nazir, and his murder of a fellow POW named Tom Walker under duress by the terrorists. As Brody leaves, Saul contacts Carrie and informs her that Walker (Chris Chalk) is alive and was the POW who was turned. Carrie tries to apologize to Brody, but he rebuffs her and goes back to his family. The investigation into Walker leads Carrie and Saul to Mansour al-Zahrani (Ramsey Faragallah), a Saudi diplomat who acts as Nazir's intermediary. Carrie blackmails al-Zahrani into arranging a meeting with Walker at Farragut Square. However, the meet ends in disaster when Walker detonates a briefcase bomb carried by a double, killing al-Zahrani and three bystanders. Carrie is injured in the explosion, leading to a severe manic episode that causes her to be hospitalized. Upon learning of her affair with Brody, Estes ‚Äî already under pressure by Vice President William Walden (Jamey Sheridan) to find a scapegoat for the bombing ‚Äî dismisses Carrie from the CIA. Carrie deduces the target of Walker and Nazir's upcoming attack: Walden's upcoming policy summit at the State Department. When Walker stages a sniper attack on the dignitaries, Brody, Walden, and Estes are led to an underground bunker. Carrie realizes that the shooting is a diversion from the actual attack, in which Brody will bomb the bunker with a suicide vest and kill everyone inside. Carrie appears at Brody's house and pleads with his daughter, Dana (Morgan Saylor), to contact her father and stop him from carrying out the attack. An alarmed Dana calls 911, leading the police to arrest Carrie. Brody relents from the attack at the last minute following a sudden phone call from Dana. The following day, as Carrie is being released into Maggie's custody, Brody confronts her and tells her to leave him and his family alone. Carrie, now discredited and doubting her own sanity, asks to be taken to a hospital for electroconvulsive therapy. Saul tries to stop the procedure, but she is undeterred. When Saul mentions that Nazir's son, Issa, was killed in a drone strike, Carrie -- remembering that Brody cried out Issa's name during a nightmare -- fleetingly ponders this connection before being given a seizure by the ECT treatment.  Season 2  Six months later, Carrie is working as an English as a Second Language teacher and living with her sister. When one of her former CIA assets, Fatima Ali (Clara Khoury), demands to talk with Carrie, Saul and Estes persuade her to fly to Lebanon for a meeting. Fatima gives the time and location of a planned meeting between her husband and Nazir in exchange for her defection. Saul and Estes' lack of trust in Carrie's judgment causes her to briefly have another breakdown. Carrie, Saul, and Estes set up an operation to capture Nazir, but Brody -- who has been elected to Congress and is observing the operation with Walden in a situation room -- tips him off and allows him to escape. Carrie, her obsession with the case renewed, ransacks Fatima's apartment and comes out with a satchel full of documents. After a pursuit by a Lebanese mob, Saul finds a hidden compartment in the satchel that it contains a memory card with Brody confessing to the aborted State Department bombing. When the mission is over, however, she realizes that she will not be permitted back into the CIA, and attempts suicide by overdosing on her medication. At the last minute, she changes her mind and vomits up the pills. Moments later, Saul shows up at her door and shows her Brody's confession. The video convinces Estes to let Carrie watch Brody, and to assign a CIA analyst named Peter Quinn (Rupert Friend) to run the operation. Quinn has Carrie meet with Brody as part of a sting operation. During the meeting, Carrie intuits that he is on to her and blows her cover by confronting Brody about his treason, forcing Saul and Quinn to arrest him. During her interrogation of Brody, Carrie catches him by surprise by admitting that she wanted him to leave his family to be with her. After Carrie systematically breaks Brody down and correctly surmises that Dana's phone call prevented the State Department bombing, he tearfully admits to his collaboration with Nazir and other al-Qaeda associates, and reveals that Nazir is planning an attack. Carrie gives Brody an ultimatum: either be exposed and sent to prison, or help the CIA in exchange for immunity. Left with no other options, Brody agrees to help the CIA. The pressures arising from both his family's needs and his espionage work lead Brody to break off contact with al- Qaeda. Carrie takes Brody to a hotel to convince him to go back to al-Qaeda; she has sex with him while Saul and Quinn uncomfortably listen in. After Brody helps foil the attack, Carrie is captured by Nazir, who threatens to kill her unless Brody aids him in assassinating Walden. After Brody kills Walden at Nazir's instruction, Nazir releases Carrie, who leads the search of the abandoned mill where she was held. Realizing that Nazir is still hiding in the building, she leads a SWAT team inside and witnesses his death. Estes offers to reinstate Carrie and promote her to Station Chief. When Brody leaves his wife Jessica (Morena Baccarin) to be with her, however, Carrie finds herself torn between her career and her love for him. She goes with Brody to a memorial service for Walden at Langley, and tells him she wants to be with him. During the service, al-Qaeda operatives plant a bomb in Brody's car and detonate it, in an attack planned by Nazir in advance of his death. The blast kills Estes, Walden's family, and numerous senior government officials. Al- Qaeda also leaks Brody's confession video, thus framing him for the attack. Believing that Brody is innocent yet knowing that no one else will, Carrie drives him over the Canada‚ÄìUS border and sets out to clear his name.  Season 3  Fifty-eight days after the Langley bombing, Carrie has been reinstated to the CIA and answers questioning by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. During her testimony, she states that Brody had nothing to do with the attack. Information is leaked to the public about her previous immunity deal with Brody, as well as her sexual relationship with him. Saul acknowledges Carrie's bipolar disorder when he appears before the committee. In retaliation, Carrie leaks classified information to a reporter, leading Saul to have her temporarily committed to a mental hospital. She appears before a hospital committee to ask for her release, which her father and sister attend. When they tell her to begin taking lithium again, she flies into a rage and has to be forcibly medicated and restrained. She is then formally committed. Weeks later, lawyer Paul Franklin (Jason Butler Harner) visits Carrie in the hospital and offers to help her retaliate against the CIA, but she refuses. Franklin nevertheless secures her release and persuades her to meet with Leland Bennett (Martin Donovan), a lawyer representing the Iranian bank that financed the Langley bombing. Bennett makes a deal with Carrie: his clients will protect her from further reprisals in exchange for intelligence on the CIA's inner workings. The episode's final scene reveals that her entire ordeal is part of a secret operation she has been working on with Saul. Jessica Brody begs Carrie to help find Dana, who has run off with her boyfriend Leo (Sam Underwood). Carrie runs a ploy to slip her surveillance and tell FBI Special Agent Hall (Billy Smith), who is assigned to the Brody family detail, to find Dana. That night, Carrie is kidnapped and brought before Majid Javadi (Shaun Toub), an Iranian intelligence operative and one of the masterminds of the Langley attack. Carrie offers Javadi the agency's protection in exchange for information on the other bombers. Javadi agrees to help them, but evades his surveillance detail to murder his ex-wife and daughter-in-law. Carrie and Quinn arrive moments later and take him into custody. Meanwhile, Carrie learns that she is pregnant. During questioning, Javadi says that one of Nazir's men detonated the Langley bomb, and that Brody had nothing to do with it. As Carrie delivers Javadi to the airport, he tells her that Bennett knows the bomber's identity. Carrie enlists Quinn to help clear Brody's name. To track down the bomber, she tells Franklin that Leland's firm has been linked to the bombing, provoking Leland into ordering the bomber moved out of the country. She takes part in a stakeout of the bomber's hotel room and watches as Franklin approaches with a silenced pistol. Carrie insists on intervening, as she cannot prove Brody's innocence without the bomber's testimony. Black ops agent Dar Adal (F. Murray Abraham) orders her to stand down, but she ignores him and starts running toward the hotel. Quinn shoots her in the shoulder to stop her. Adal's team then drives her to the hospital. Saul visits Carrie in the hospital and reveals the full scope of the operation: Brody will seek political asylum in Iran and assassinate the leader of the Revolutionary Guard so that Javadi can take his place. Carrie goes to see Brody, who is suffering through heroin withdrawal, and takes him to the motel where Dana is working as a maid. Brody tries to get out of the car and see her, but is subdued by the soldiers flanking him; Carrie then tells him that going through the operation is his only chance for redemption. After Brody weans off the drugs and regains his strength, Carrie takes him to see Dana, who says that she never wants to see Carrie or her father again. Carrie and Brody say goodbye as he ships out for Tehran. Carrie watches via satellite as a Special Operations team transports Brody to the Iranian border. The team encounters Iraqi Police officers who recognize Brody and open fire on them. The operation is endangered when the team's van hits a land mine, severely injuring the team leader and attracting enemy fire. Saul calls off the operation and orders Brody to turn back, but Brody refuses and runs toward the border. Carrie tells Brody that he will die on his own, but he insists that she find a way to get him back safely. Fortunately, Iranian border guards take Brody in, saving the operation. Carrie travels to Tehran to make sure the assassination goes smoothly, and watches as Brody is taken to meet with the head of the Revolutionary Guard, General Deshan Akbari (Houshang Touzie). Brody does not get close enough to Akbari to inject him with cyanide as planned, putting the mission in jeopardy. The situation worsens when Brody starts giving interviews to Iranian television denouncing the U.S.; over Carrie's objections, Saul orders Brody to be killed. Carrie calls Brody to warn him, and pleads with him to come with her to safety. Brody refuses, however, and manages to enter the Revolutionary Guard headquarters and kill Akbari. After informing Carrie of his success, Brody goes with her to a safe house 100 miles out of Tehran. There, she tells him she is pregnant with his child. Saul assures her that Brody will be safely extracted, but his successor as CIA Director, Senator Andrew Lockhart (Tracy Letts), betrays their location to Javadi, who arranges their capture. Brody is convicted of treason and sentenced to death. Carrie tries desperately to secure his release, but to no avail. When she calls him in his cell, he asks her not to come to his execution. She goes anyway, however, and calls out his name as he is hanged in a public square. Four months later, Lockhart promotes a heavily pregnant Carrie to Station Chief in Istanbul, but refuses her request to give Brody a star on the CIA Memorial Wall. Carrie accepts the job, but later tells her father and sister that she won't be taking the baby ‚Äì a girl ‚Äì with her to Istanbul. Her father tells her that he will take the child. Later, Carrie draws a star on the wall for Brody after a memorial ceremony for the victims of the Langley attack.  Season 4  Carrie, now CIA Station Chief in Afghanistan, authorizes a drone strike on a Pakistani farmhouse where terrorist Haissam Haqqani (Numan Acar) is in hiding. The strike occurs while Haqqani is attending a wedding, resulting in his apparent death along with those of 40 civilians. Carrie travels to Islamabad to learn that Sandy Bachman (Corey Stoll), the Station Chief in Pakistan, had been outed. Carrie and Quinn attempt to rescue Bachman, but they are spotted by an angry mob that kills Bachman. Carrie and Quinn manage to escape. In Washington, Lockhart permanently \\"recalls\\" Carrie from her post in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Carrie is struggling with raising her infant daughter, Frannie. She sees no point in being a mother with Brody dead, and interacts with the child as little as possible, often leaving her in the care of her sister Maggie. While bathing Frannie, Carrie is momentarily tempted to drown her. She leaves Frannie with Maggie, reasoning that her daughter is better off without her. Carrie and Quinn meet Jordan Harris (Adam Godley), a former CIA case officer who reveals that Bachman had leaked intelligence and was protected by Lockhart. Carrie blackmails Lockhart into promoting her to Bachman's former post as the CIA's Station Chief in Pakistan. In Islamabad, Carrie attempts to turn Haqqani's nephew Aayan Ibrahim (Suraj Sharma), a Pakistani medical student whose family was killed in the drone strike, and who may hold valuable information. Quinn requests dismissal from the CIA, but Carrie convinces him to come to Islamabad when he finds evidence that Bachman's death was a setup. Carrie learns that Haqqani is still alive, and sees him together with Aayan. Suspecting that Aayan is involved in terrorism, she sleeps with him in an attempt to recruit him as an asset. Carrie stages her own kidnapping to scare Aayan into leaving the country. She then watches via drone as he meets with Haqqani, who produces Saul, bound and gagged, from his car. Haqqani accuses Aayan of spying on him and shoots him in the head, killing him. Enraged, Carrie orders a drone strike, even though it would kill Saul. Quinn stops her, however. Meanwhile, Dennis Boyd (Mark Moses), the husband of the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, breaks into Carrie's apartment and photographs her medication and family photos. Boyd switches her medication with a hallucinogen. She has a delusional episode and attacks a security guard, and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) officers take her into custody. Lieutenant colonel Aasar Khan (Raza Jaffrey) questions her, but she hallucinates that he is Brody and breaks down crying in his arms. She receives a call from Saul, who has escaped from his captors. She helps him evade the local Taliban, and talks him out of committing suicide when they find him. Ultimately, however, she delivers him to the Taliban so they will spare his life. Later that night, she meets with Khan, who tells her that Boyd is working with the ISI. Carrie sets a trap for Boyd with his wife's help, and he is taken into custody. Carrie oversees a prisoner exchange: Saul for five Taliban members. When Saul comes into view, however, Carrie sees a young boy behind him wearing a suicide vest. Carrie goes herself to retrieve Saul, and persuades him to let the exchange go forward and come with her. As they go back to the U.S. Embassy, their car is hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. Marines pull Carrie and Saul from the wreckage, and take them back the embassy, which has been invaded by Haqqani's forces. The White House orders U.S. forces out of Pakistan and relieves Carrie of her command. When Quinn kidnaps Farhad Ghazi (Tamer Burjaq), the ISI agent who kidnapped Saul, Carrie asks Lockhart to let her stay in Islamabad so she can bring him in. She finds Quinn and pleads with him to leave the country, but he refuses and escapes. She later stops him from assassinating Haqqani, and sees that Haqqani has Adal in his entourage. Meanwhile, she receives a phone call from Maggie, who tells her that their father has died. Carrie finds some solace in talking to Frannie, and decides to be a better mother to her. Quinn shows up at her father's funeral, and the two share a kiss. She also sees her estranged mother (Victoria Clark), and finds out that she has a half-brother. She confronts Adal, and learns that Quinn has accepted a mission in Syria and that Saul and Adal are negotiating with Haqqani.  Season 5  The fifth season begins two years later. Carrie has left the CIA, and is living in Berlin with Franny and her boyfriend Jonas (Alexander Fehling). She now works as head of security for the D√ºring Foundation, and is tasked by her boss Otto D√ºring (Sebastian Koch) to prepare him for a trip to Lebanon. She meets with her former colleague Allison Carr (Miranda Otto) to assess the security situation there; Allison refuses to help unless Carrie gives her inside information on the Foundation, a request Carrie refuses. She arranges safe passage for D√ºring to Lebanon - where an attempt is made on his life. Carrie meets with a contact named Behruz (Mousa Kraish), who tells her that she, not D√ºring, was the target of the attack. To find out who wants her dead, Carrie goes off her medication, claiming that her manic phases make her mind sharper. She and Jonas get into an argument when he finds out how many drone strikes she ordered while at the CIA, and he storms out. Soon after, he learns that Quinn kidnapped his son and then released him as a ploy to draw Carrie out. The following night, Carrie finds Quinn sneaking up on Jonas' house and shoots him in the back. Quinn was wearing body armor, however, and incapacitates her. Quinn tells her that Saul gave him an order to kill her. They stage a crime scene and take photos to fake Carrie's death, and Carrie prepares to go into hiding. Before she does, she insists on scouting the post office where Quinn gets his assignments in order to confirm whether it really was Saul who wanted her killed. After Quinn drops off his \\"proof\\" of Carrie's death in the P.O. box, a hitman arrives, targeting Quinn, and a gunfight ensues in which Quinn is wounded. Carrie leaves Quinn with Jonas, and goes to investigate. She learns that the hitman worked for Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and realizes that Russia wants CIA intelligence that had recently been stolen by hackers. She meets with Saul and asks him to give her copies of the hacked documents, but he refuses. She decides to go into hiding, and asks D√ºring to smuggle her out of the country. Just before she is about to leave, however, D√ºring gives her the documents from Saul, who now believes her. One of the documents concerns an operation she worked on in Baghdad with Allison 10 years earlier, and she finds out that Ahmed Nazari (Darwin Shaw), a former asset who had been presumed dead, is still alive. She meets with Allison, who promises to help her. Carrie then asks her asset Numan (Atheer Adal) to hack into Allison's computer to find the case files about Nazari, and discovers a screensaver photo of Nazari at Allison's favorite bar. She deduces from the picture that Allison and Nazari are romantically involved, and that Allison is the traitor. Carrie convinces Saul to put Allison under surveillance, despite the fact that he and Allison are in a relationship. They then lead her to believe that an SVR chief has defected to the U.S., and that he has documents revealing how the CIA had been infiltrated. Allison panics and goes to her handler, Ivan Krupin (Mark Ivanir), which allows the CIA to put her under arrest. Carrie then sees a news report showing video of Islamic State terrorists poisoning Quinn with sarin, and threatening to unleash a chemical attack on a major European city in 24 hours. Carrie traces the video to an address in Berlin, where she finds Quinn, barely alive. Quinn ultimately lives, but is left in a coma. Carrie asks her contacts for information on an underground doctor in the area where Quinn went missing. Following a tip from former Hezbollah commander Al-Amin (George Georgiou), she tracks down one of the cell's supporters, Dr. Hussein (Mehdi Nebbou). Under threat of arrest, he brings her to an apartment belonging to Qasim (Alireza Bayram), one of the terrorists. In the apartment, Carrie finds extensive research on the Hauptbahnhof train station and heads there to investigate. She finds Qasim in the subway, and pleads with him to stop the plan to bomb the station. Qasim tries to reason with his cousin Bibi (Ren√© Ifrah), the ringleader, but Bibi kills him. Carrie then shoots and kills Bibi, neutralizing the threat. Back home, Jonas breaks up with Carrie, saying that neither he nor his son will ever be safe around her. Saul asks Carrie to rejoin the CIA, but she declines his offer. D√ºring essentially proposes to her, giving her a chance to co-head his Foundation. She does not answer him, and he gives her time to think about it. Meanwhile, Quinn suffers a massive brain hemorrhage. Adal gives Carrie a letter Quinn wrote declaring his love for her. She visits him in the hospital, locks the door to his room, and removes his pulse monitor, implying a mercy killing. The episode ends with Carrie pausing before anything happens to Quinn.Boboltz, Sarah. \\"Why That 'Homeland' Character May Not Be Gone For Good\\" The Huffington Post. December 21, 2015.  Season 6  Carrie has returned to the United States and is living in Brooklyn, New York with Frannie. She is working for a foundation that provides legal aid to Muslims accused of terrorism, and serving as an informal advisor to President-Elect Elizabeth Keane (Elizabeth Marvel). She is also caring for Quinn, who emerged from the coma with neurological damage and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). When her client Sekou Bah (J. Mallory Cree) is killed in and framed for a terrorist attack, Carrie begins to investigate. She goes to talk with Sekou's family, leaving Quinn to watch Frannie. A group of protestors, angered by leaked reports that Carrie was Sekou's lawyer, gather outside Carrie's house; this triggers Quinn's PTSD, and he shoots one of the protestors and takes a reporter hostage. Carrie manages to talk Quinn down so he will be taken in alive. Dar Adal - the mastermind of the attack - exploits the situation by telling Children's Protective Services (CPS) that Carrie put Frannie in danger, in order to drive Carrie over the edge and discredit her in Keane's eyes. The plan works: CPS put Frannie in a foster home, and Carrie falls into an alcoholic despair that motivates Keane to question her judgment. Saul raises Carrie's spirits by taking her to see Frannie, and asks for her help in setting up a meeting between Keane and Majid Javadi, who claims to have evidence that Adal is manipulating her. At the meeting, however, Javadi lies that Iran is not complying with its nuclear deal with the United States. Carrie discovers that Adal is part of a conspiracy of disgruntled undercover operatives who want to undermine Keane's antiwar foreign policy. She also finds out that Javadi had been working with Adal, and that Adal is the brains behind alt-right media personality Brett O'Keefe (Jake Weber), who is peddling a false conspiracy theory that Keane's son Andrew, who died fighting in Iraq, was deserting his post when he was killed. Adal betrays Javadi to Mossad, who want to arrest him on terrorism charges. As he is taken away, Javadi leaves evidence of Adal's treachery for Carrie, who takes it to Keane. Keane asks Carrie to testify that Adal covered up the infiltration by a Russian agent of the CIA Berlin station. Carrie is reluctant to do so, as that would ruin Saul's career, but ultimately agrees that it is the best course of action. She refuses to testify at the last minute, however, after her driver makes suspicious comments about her upcoming appointment with CPS. After she refuses, she gets an ominous phone call informing her that her upcoming supervised visit with Frannie has been cancelled. She realizes that Adal is blackmailing her, and calls the CIA to tell them that he has \\"won\\". Quinn informs her that he found evidence that Sekou was set up, and that Porteous Belli (C. J. Wilson), an assassin working for Adal, has been spying on her. They go to the conspirators' safe house, where Belli attacks them. Quinn kills Belli, and finds evidence that the conspirators are planning to assassinate Keane. Moments later, however, the house is destroyed by a hidden bomb, taking the evidence with it. Carrie and Quinn rush to Keane's headquarters, which has just received a bomb threat. During the evacuation, Adal calls Carrie and tells her that the bomb threat is a ruse to get Keane out of the building, where she can be assassinated, while Quinn is to be framed as the killer. Carrie stops Keane's vehicle from leaving, seconds before the decoy vehicle is destroyed. Quinn smuggles Carrie and Keane out of the building in his car and sacrifices his life to save them when a special ops team, answering to Adal, opens fire on them. Adal is arrested and Keane is inaugurated as President of the United States. Weeks later, Keane - who has become hawkish and paranoid since the attempt on her life - asks Carrie to work for her administration. Carrie agrees, but has second thoughts when Keane orders dozens of intelligence operatives, including Saul, arrested on suspicion of being involved in the conspiracy. Carrie tries to meet with Keane to dissuade her, but Keane's Chief of Staff David Wellington (Linus Roache) has her banned from the White House. Season 7 A few months later, Carrie is doing covert work for the CIA, and she and Frannie are living with Maggie and her family - a tense living situation, as Maggie's husband Bill (Mackenzie Astin) works for the Keane administration. Carrie sets up a meeting between Senator Sam Paley (Dylan Baker) and her old FBI contact Dante Allen (Morgan Spector), who has evidence of corruption within the administration. To escape a man she thinks is following her, Carrie changes the meeting place and asks Maggie's daughter Josie (Courtney Grosbeck) to bring her the keys. The meeting falls apart when Dante refuses to testify in court, and frays her relationship with Maggie, who is angry that Carrie put Josie in danger. The rift worsens when Maggie finds out that Carrie has stopped taking her lithium in favor of black market Seroquel. While watching her surveillance feeds, Carrie sees an unknown woman (Sandrine Holt) going into Wellington's house. Desperate to identify her, Carrie posts a screen capture of the woman on 4chan, asking if anyone can identify her. A hacker responds to the post, and lures Carrie into downloading a file which infects her laptop with ransomware. The hard drive is encrypted with a demand for a $5,000 payment in bitcoin. The hacker then threatens to reveal Carrie's spying and raises his price to $20,000. Carrie tries to seduce the hacker by performing a striptease on her webcam, which entices the hacker to meet with her in person. At their meeting, Carrie beats the hacker with a baton, reveals that she is CIA, and threatens to kill him if he doesn't leave her alone. Carrie learns from Dante that the woman in Wellington's house is Simone Martin (Sandrine Holt), who is in a sexual relationship with Wellington as part of a plan to get U.S. intelligence for the Russians. She also appears to be connected to the mysterious death of Gen. Jamie MacLendon (Robert Knepper), one of the conspirators in the assassination attempt on Keane. Carrie breaks into Martin's house to gather information, but is arrested for trespassing. Dante intervenes and manages to get her out of jail. Carrie proposes to Dante a \\"completely illegal\\" plan to connect Wellington to Martin's dealings, and Dante agrees to help. Dante, Max, and former CIA officer Thomas Anson (James D'Arcy) kidnap Martin and get her to confess her complicity in MacLendon's death, which leads to her testifying in Paley's hearings. Carrie has her doubts, however, and meets with Saul to discuss the matter; the two of them figure out that Dante is in fact a Russian agent and had orchestrated the entire affair in order to bring down Keane. Carrie seduces Dante and then drugs him so her team can surveil his apartment; they discover that Dante had been spying on Carrie as well. That night, Dante and Carrie have sex, but are interrupted by a team of Saul's agents, who take Dante into custody. Carrie and Saul have a CIA agent pose as Dante's court- appointed lawyer and non-lethally poison him, and promise to give him the antidote if he gives them the details of his plan. He tells them of a secret code that would signal GRU Operator Yevgeny Gromov (Costa Ronin) to dissolve his forces. Saul persuades Keane to broadcast the code by compromising Twitter servers and violate the privacy of U.S. citizens by tracking who posts confirmations in response to the tweet. Carrie goes to Maggie's house to try and reconcile, but instead learns from Bill that Maggie is meeting a lawyer to seek custody of Franny. When Dante accuses Gromov of poisoning him, he denies it and tells Dante to call Carrie and ask her if she was responsible. Dante calls Carrie, who is picking up Franny from school early. He realizes that Carrie is lying to him, but nonetheless he tells Carrie that Gromov is in the room with him; Gromov then kills him. Carrie opts to leave Franny at school in her rush to the hospital, but Franny runs after her and is almost accidentally run over by her mother in the parking lot. After learning that Dante is dead, Carrie has a psychotic break at the hospital. As Carrie prepares for a custody hearing, Saul asks her to lead an operation in Russia to exfiltrate Martin, but she refuses. She then has Anson break into Maggie's office to get proof that she illegally medicated Carrie for years in order to undermine her custody petition. She ultimately decides not to use them, however, after Maggie helps her realize that she will never leave the CIA and thus cannot give Frannie the attention she needs. She agrees to give Maggie custody of Frannie, and arranges to see her every two weeks. She then accepts Saul's offer. In Moscow, Carrie and Saul meet with GRU representatives, including Gromov, in order to distract them while Carrie's team extracts Martin. The plan fails, however, as the team is ambushed by guards and forced to retreat. Carrie salvages the mission by personally infiltrating the safe house where Martin is being kept, and persuading her that the Russians now consider her a liability and only the CIA can keep her alive. Sure enough, Gromov's men arrive to kill them, but Carrie dupes them by disguising herself as Martin and leading them away while the real Martin escapes. Carrie is ultimately captured and taken into Russian custody. Gromov wants Carrie to film a confession video stating that Martin was a CIA operative and that the U.S. orchestrated everything, while threatening to withhold her medication if she doesn't cooperate. Carrie refuses, and has sex with a guard after he promises to get her medication in secret. It turns out that the guard was lying, however, and reveals her duplicity to Gromov, who punishes her by refusing her medication. Seven months later, Keane resigns from the presidency, and her Vice President, Ralph Warner (Beau Bridges), takes over. He and Saul negotiate Carrie's release in a prisoner exchange; after months without being medicated, however, Carrie is barely lucid and doesn't even recognize Saul. Season 8=Development Homeland co-creators Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa initially pitched the show to networks with the Carrie Mathison character being a rather straight-laced CIA officer. Once it wasn't picked up and they moved on to the cable channels, they were able to experiment with more complex and flawed main characters. Carrie was given bipolar disorder and made more of an unreliable narrator. Showtime eventually secured the rights to the show and embraced the more unstable version of the character. From the initial conception of the character, Gordon and Gansa targeted Claire Danes to play the lead role of Carrie. The pair were very impressed with her acting prowess, especially in My So-Called Life and Temple Grandin, but were skeptical as to whether she would accept a television role. Indeed, Danes was not necessarily looking to return to television, but she found the script and the character to be very compelling. In addition, the opportunity to be a part of the \\"renaissance\\" of high-quality dramas on cable television appealed to her. To prepare for the role, Danes had to learn much about the CIA, as well as the nuances of playing someone who has bipolar disorder. Danes' personal research into the CIA touched on such topics as its internal culture, agency politics, and the implications of being a female agent. She also was granted access to CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and was able to personally consult with the female CIA officer whom the Carrie Mathison character was loosely based on. Reception=Reviews Hank Stuever of The Washington Post in his 2011 Fall TV roundup said that Carrie Mathison was \\"easily this season's strongest female character\\". The A.V. Clubs Emily VanDerWerff called Carrie \\"my favorite new character of this TV season\\", noting the way she attacks everything with reckless abandon. In November 2011, The Atlantic named Carrie Mathison as one of the best characters on TV, calling her \\"the thinking man's Jack Bauer\\", and going on to say \\"We both root for Carrie's assuredness and are turned off by her brash, erratic, and occasionally reckless behavior\\". In Digital Spy's list of the top 25 best TV characters of 2012, Carrie Mathison was ranked #2. Awards For her portrayal of Carrie Mathison in the premiere season of Homeland, Claire Danes received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. She also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Television Series Drama, TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Drama, Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Drama Actress, and Satellite Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Television Series Drama.\\"2011 Satellite Winners\\".

Breakdown. Retrieved May 31, 2012. As of the 2010 census, its total population was 911. Batavia, Arkansas was settled in 1881 by Roswell Emerson Underwood, who spent four years as a Genesee County, New York, surveyor for the Holland Land Company. He was impressed by the beauty of this site which is located in the foothills of the Ozark Mountains. He was the first postmaster, and named the town for Batavia, New York, his former residence. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, Batavia Township covers an area of ; of land and of water. Former cities, towns, and villages *Batavia: There was formerly an incorporated town of Batavia within the township. It is now an unincorporated community. Currently, there are no incorporated cities or towns in the township. History Batavia is an unincorporated community in Boone County, Arkansas, United States. Batavia is located on Arkansas Highway 392 5.0 miles (8.0 km) west-northwest of Harrison. Batavia was a former incorporated town. In 1880, Roswell Underwood established the first post office in the former town. He named it Batavia after his hometown of Batavia, New York. The town was laid out in blocks. The first house on Main Street was built in 1912. Arkansas Highway 206 is where Main Street used to be located. The post office was closed in 1955. During its heyday, businesses included stores, hotels, a canning factory, a train depot, stockyards, mills, a corn gristmill, and a blacksmith shop. There was also a school and churches. By 1926, the passenger railroad stopped going through Batavia. While the community is bigger in terms of population and homes than it was as an incorporated town, the businesses are fewer. Batavia township still exists (see township population history) without any current incorporated towns inside of it. George W. O'Neal founded the Pilot Knob Fruit Farm, one mile from Batavia. He devoted this entire farm to commercial fruit, and by 1905 had set out more than 10,000 apple and peach trees. A few years later, he planted several thousand more, making Pilot Knob Farm an even larger operation. Iowa native Frank Warning was another big fruit grower in Boone County. He was vice president of the Ozark Fruit and Produce Company and a stockholder in the Batavia Fruit Company. The Batavia Fruit Company owned 1,431 acres on which were set 130,000 peach trees. The Ozark Fruit Company had set out 35,000 peach trees, and in 1905 had plans to set out 15,000 more trees that spring. Warning, along with his father, owned 240 acres of fine land located about a mile from Harrison, and that, too, became another fruit farm.

After his cock gets knocked down by a hard impact, Oswald feeds it with some special seeds. The seeds benefitted the rabbit's chicken significantly until the bear's was taken down for good. Following his victory at the cockfighting event, Oswald is being paraded on a limousine. On the way, he spots a female raccoon whom he finds very attractive. Oswald jumps out of the car and comes to her. After a brief conversation, the rabbit and the raccoon became friends and started dancing around. Back at the cockfighting arena, the bear was depressed by his defeat and doesn't know what to do next. He tries to get his rooster back on its feet, only to see it fall again. The disgruntled bear then walks out and decides to take his frustration on Oswald. The film scene returns to Oswald who is still dancing around with the raccoon. Just then, the bear rushes in and confronts him. The bear tries to attack with a kick but Oswald cleverly catches the assailant's leg. The rabbit then takes off the bear's boot and gives a tickle on the foot, therefore incapacitating the bear who laughs uncontrollably. The bear attempts another assault, only to be tickled off by Oswald in the abdomen. In no time, Oswald's rooster comes in and tickles the bear out of the picture. Oswald then resumes his date with the raccoon.

The University currently has five postgraduate programmes ‚Äì M.A.Education, M.A.Economics, M.A.Development, M.A.Public Policy & Governance and LL.M. (Law and Development). History The beginnings of the University are in the learning and experience of a decade of work in elementary education by the Azim Premji Foundation. The University was founded as one of the key responses to the constraints and challenges that the Foundation encountered both within and in the environment, and as part of a larger strategy to contribute to the Education and Development sectors in the country. Two key principles guide the process of the University's evolution. Firstly, the University has an explicit social (or moral) purpose. As an institution, it exists to make significant contributions to education in a manner consistent with social justice, equity, humane values and sustainability within the framework of a secular and democratic Indian polity. This is an explicit commitment to the idea that knowledge and learning have human and social consequences and that their pursuit cannot be separated from these consequences. At the same time, this commitment to a specific value orientation is not to be interpreted as a narrowly utilitarian view of the University. We believe that the commitment to these values is not in any way inconsistent with academic and institutional autonomy and excellence. Secondly, the University is part of the Foundation and integral to its vision. The synergy from the close working of the students and faculty with the Foundation's field units will inform and enrich the programmes at the University and the field alike. The members of the Foundation as a whole have the challenging task of defining an organizational culture and processes of interaction that realize the full potential of this linkage. Campus Pixel Park, Azim Premji University The University's interim campus is located within the South Campus of PES University on Hosur Road in Bangalore. The campus spread over 12 acres offers amenities for a great learning environment and vibrant student experience. The campus offers 120,000 sq. ft. of space that houses classrooms equipped with audio visual equipment, a large seminar hall, conference rooms with video-conferencing facilities, and multiple discussion rooms. Student have access to a spacious, well-stocked library, a cafeteria with two dining halls, and extensive sports facilities including football, cricket and basketball. The permanent residential University campus will soon come up Sarjapur-Attibele Road on the outskirts of Bangalore. Spread over 80 acres, the campus will offer 2.7 million sq.ft. of space after the first phase of construction, capable of accommodating 3800 students and 700 faculty plus administration staff. It will be a self-contained learning and living space with hostel accommodation for students, residential facilities for faculty and staff, guest stay, library, auditorium, amphitheater, and sports complex with outdoor and indoor games. The University facilitates student accommodation on leased premises located reasonably close to the University campus. To and fro transportation facility to the University, from the various accommodations, is provided at pre- determined timings. Accommodation is provided on sharing basis, in different configurations. At the student accommodation, the university like to build spaces that lay emphasis on the culture of community rather than the individual. Academics The growth and development of the University needs to be enabled with an appropriate Organization structure. This helps the institution remain focused on the purpose, and realize it in substantial measure. * The University is organized into 5 schools and a University wide Research centre. * All Schools have an overarching coherence and alignment with our core social purpose. * These schools have ownership for their respective programmes. They will engage with key initiatives in their respective domains, through research, conferences, workshops, publications and several other mechanisms. * While each faculty member will have a primary affiliation to a School, in spirit they are ‚ÄúUniversity faculty‚Äù and will teach across schools, engage in institution building and contribute significantly to the overall academic development of the University.

The Privatisation process in Pakistan (sometimes referred to as Denationalisation programme or simply the Privatisation in Pakistan) is a continuous policy measure program in the economic period of Pakistan. It was first conceived and implemented by the then-people-elected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and the Pakistan Muslim League, in an attempt to enable the nationalised industries towards market economy, immediately after the economic collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989‚Äì90. The programme was envisaged and visioned to improve the GDP growth of the national economy of Pakistan, and reversal of the nationalisation programme in 1970s‚Äî an inverse of the privatisation programme. In the period of the 1970s, all major private industries and utilities were put under the government ownership in an intensified programme, called the nationalisation programme that led the economic disaster in Pakistan. Since then, the demand for denationalisation gained currency towards the ending of the government of Pakistan Peoples Party in 1977, although a commission was set up by General Zia-ul-Haq government but no denationalisation programme began until 1990. The privatisation programme was launched on 22 January 1991 by Prime minister Nawaz Sharif in a vision to promote free-market economic principles, private- ownership and the mainstream goal to attract foreign investment in the country. But, as a result a good deal of the national wealth fell into the hands of a relatively small group of so-called business oligarchs (tycoons), and the wealth gap increased dramatically in the 1990s that halted the programme by Benazir Bhutto. Revisions were made in 1999, and finally launched the much more intensified privatisation programme under the watchful presiding leadership of Prime minister Shaukat Aziz in 2004. Finally, the programme was ended effectively at the end of 2007 when ~80%‚Äì90% of the industries were put under the management of private ownership of enterprises by Prime minister Shaukat Aziz. Privatisation (Spontaneous phase: 1989‚Äì1993) The privatisation programme launched in Punjab which had the higher GDP growth than any province of Pakistan. The momentum and demands for denationalisation gained currency towards the end of the government of Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Pakistan Peoples Party who under intensified their nationalisation programme had effectively the government-ownership management in the private industries of Pakistan; it had built a strong public-sector with priority on cement, steel and fertilizers.See Nationalisation in Pakistan After the end of government of peoples party, a white paper was issued by General Zia-ul-Haq's government, followed by setting up the commission under Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation (PICIC) chairman N.M. Ukailie. However, only three industries were returned to its rightful owners, namely Eittefaq Group of Industries to Mian Mohammed Sharif whilst others remains under government controlled. As an aftermath of 1988 general elections, Benazir Bhutto and the peoples party returned to power, promising to denationalised and replace with the industrialisation programme by means other than the state intervention. But controversially Benazir Bhutto did not carried out the denationalisation programme or liberalisaion of the economy. No nationalised units were privatised, few economic regulations were reviewed. The partial privatisation began to kick off by Chief Minister of Punjab Province Nawaz Sharif who presided the liquidation of many industrial units put under provisional government to private sector. All industries based on Punjab government ownership were returned to its rightful owners on a mutual understanding; the prices on units returned to industrialists are still kept as \\"top secret\\" by the provisional government. Nawaz Sharif. A large-scale privatisation programme was launched on 22 January 1991 as the primary economic policy by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who came to national power after securing a flight-winning victory in the 1990 general elections. The privatisation programme was inspired and influenced in its nature after witnessing the success of the privatisation in Great-Britain by British Prime minister Margaret Thatcher. The first phase of the privatisation programme covered the half of the public sector industries in terms of total employment, and the programme was in a direct response to Pakistan Peoples Party and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and for instance Sharif's privatisation programme was swift as nationalisation programme. During the course of first phase, Sharif presided the denationalisation of banking sector and industries to private sector, starting first with MCB limited. Sharif termed his privatization programme as \\"turning Pakistan into a (South) Korea by encouraging greater private saving and investment to accelerate economic growth.\\". The second phase was promulgated by Sartaj Aziz with the goal to transform the enterprises into profit-seeking businesses, not depended to the government subsidies for their survival. The mega-energy corporations such as Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and Karachi Electric Supply Corporations, and the Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation were set off to private sector. From 1990‚Äì93, around 115 industrial units were hastily privatised, including the privatisation two major banks, 68 industrial units and 10% Shares of Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited. The privatisation programme came with great surrounding controversies with lacked competition as the programme was largely controlled by favoured insider. The recklessness and favouritism shown in privatisation of the industrial and banking units by Prime minister Nawaz Sharif was to become the hallmark and the rise of strong business oligarch who have concentrated enormous assets, further increasing the wealth gap in Pakistan and contributing to the political instability. Privatisation phase (1993‚Äì1999) In 1992, the Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament, Benazir Bhutto, vehemently criticised the whole policy measure programme at the public circles. While Commerce minister Faisal Hyatt and Finance minister Sartaj Aziz enthusiastically projected the privatisation as a \\"success phase\\", Benazir Bhutto had, with a touch of drama in the state parliament, maintained that \\"while one brother was selling, other was buying.\\" After 1993 general elections, the second phase of the privatisation programme began in 1993 under the \\"disciplined macroeconomics policy\\" of Prime minister Benazir Bhutto. Her programme aimed to capitalise on the rising business oligarch class but the programme suffered with great difficulties and problems even inside the peoples party. The second phase involves the privatisation of financial institutions, several telecommunications corporations, thermal power plants, oil and gas sectors. Benazir's government did not privatize all state corporations, especially those who were collecting large revenues abroad; only certain industries were privatised which were at the brink of financial collapse. The first attempt was made to privatise the United Bank Limited but the proposal met with great hostility by the workers union and opposition. Proposals were also made to put the private-ownership to Pakistan Railway but it was rebuffed by Prime minister Benazir Bhutto who quoted: \\"Railways privatisation will be the \\"black-hole\\" of this government. Please never mention the railways to me again.\\" The economic growth declined when the US embargo began to bite the government of Benazir Bhutto. By the end of 1996, ~20 industrial units, one financial institution, one electric power plant and 12% shares of Pakistan Telecommunications Ltd. were privatised by Benazir Bhutto. The second phase remained continued until 1998 when it was abruptly ended by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after imposing economic emergency after ordering to perform capability of nuclear deterrence in response to Indian nuclear aggression. All stock exchange, stock markets and the second phase of the privatisation programme were immediately halted by Prime minister Nawaz Sharif until his government was ended in 1999. Privatisation (intensified phase: 1999‚Äì2008) Shaukat Aziz. After the end of government of Prime minister Nawaz Sharif, Pervez Musharraf invited Shaukat Aziz to take the control of declining economy of Pakistan. The GDP rate had declined from 10.0% in the 1980s to 3.6% in 1999, with foreign debt increased to 44% up as compared to 1986. Major economic reforms were introduced by Shaukat Aziz who first consolidated the industries under one platform and restructured them before setting them to privatization market. Numbers of controversial sales tex were enforced by Shaukat Aziz, mostly on import duties; and based on these reforms, patronage-based industries remained under serious threat and privatisation discussion began to take place on usual based. Aziz consistently worked on to restructured the industries and provided a vital leadership and economic relief after 2001 also played an important role in strengthening the patronage-based industries financially and physically. In 2004, Aziz became Prime minister and initiated an intensified privatisation programme in order to grow the GDP rate annually. Aziz forcefully and aggressively pushed 100% privatisation of state-owned corporations while virtually planned to privatised 85% of banking sector. Starting from 2003 until 2007, Aziz successfully privatized 80% of the banking industry into private-ownership enterprises, while privatizing the numbers of shares of Pakistan International Airlines and other mega-corporations into the public circles. The intensified privatisation programme led the economic boom of Pakistan's economy which was at the range of 8.96%‚Äì9.0% in 2004. Intensified privatisation policies had major impact on public sector organisation which diminished with the privatization of the state-owned corporations. Prime minister Aziz defended his privatisation programme as he maintained that \\"these institutions viable while they were on the verge of collapse.\\". Aziz's privatisation programme subsequently improved the country‚Äôs growth rate by 6.4%‚Äî8.6% a year. Inflation rate dropped to 3.5% in last 3 years as against 11‚Äì12% in 1990. However, in the end of 2007, Aziz's privatisation programme suffered a major set back which initially halted the privatisation programme in the country. The Supreme Court halted the privatisation of Pakistan Steel Mills after transferring the inquiry from FIA to NAB, while issued standing orders to keep the Steel Mills under the nationalization programme. The proceedings and Supreme Court's decision initially halted Aziz's intensified and aggressive privatisation programme at the end days of his tenure.  Privatisation Fiscal Year 2021  The government will likely fetch Rs100 billion in fiscal year (FY21) through the privatisation of state-owned entities said Privatisation Minister Muhammadmian Soomro.  Status  Initial work for the privatisation of power distribution companies and State Life has been started while the privatisation of Haveli Bahadur Shah Power Plant in Jhang and Baloki Power Plant in Kasur, two RLNG-based power plants, was in the final phases. Public perception The privatisation programme still marks the question of \\"big\\" controversies. In public circles, it has generated much more heated debates where it is perceived to have more negative impact on civil society. The general perception remains highly contentious and polarising issue in the civil society, gearing up the negative sentiments among the population, including the continued injection of public money in many privatised entities and less than expected improvement in the services. Although, the programme produced a relatively faster and efficient way of promoting competition and enhancing growth, on the other hand, the programme experienced the exponential increase in unemployment, reducing the access of workers' class to the basic needs of life and contributed in declining the social status of workers' class in to poor get poorer. But on the other hand, a significant support for the privatisation programme has been raised in the media. In an editorial written in Dawn, it argues that the privatisation programme has been a key \\"constituent of structural reform\\" programmes in both, the developed and developing economies, in order to achieve greater microeconomic efficiency as opposed to macroeconomics. Overall, the GDP rate grows smoothly with privatisation programme remains in effect as opposed to nationalisation programme that it had dropped the GDP growth rate of Pakistan, Dawn maintained. Major proposals were made to privatise the major and most- profitable industries of Pakistan, namely the Pakistan Railways (PR) where The Express Tribune argued that the national railways' condition has gone from bad to worse under government ownership, and only privatisation programme can save the railways with the creation of sense of competition that would drive improvement. Adversary opposition Despite its success, the public sector organisations, labour and workers unions remained extremely hostile towards the privatisation programmes. In 2005, major demonstrations and worker's revolt took place in Islamabad by the PTCL Workers Unions Action Committee, in an attempt to privatized the Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd (PTCL). Despite the demonstrations the state-corporation was privatised by Shaukat Aziz which resulted in workers‚Äô losing their jobs. In 2012, an unsuccessful attempt was carried out by current government of Pakistan Peoples Party when the government sought to privatise the mega-state corporations, particularly the power sector; major nationalised industries such as WAPDA, IESCo, TESCo, PEPCo were proposed by the finance ministry to privatise the power distribution companies. Major worker's strike were initiated by the central labour unions, and after receiving much criticism, his government halted the privatisation programme of energy sector, and nationalised the remaining power sector industries due to public pressure. The Pakistan Peoples Party's intellectuals remains skeptical about the privatisation programme and targeted the controversial implementation on numerous occasions. The peoples party maintained that \\"an elitist or top-notch educational system\\" which exceedingly comprises private sector‚Äôs foreign affiliated schools and universities, has built the \\"sole source\\" of producing some proficient minds. While on the other hand, the privatised Madrassah system of education has been patronise different sects of religion, patronise different sects of religion, and further exploited as source of religious extremism and associated with terrorist outfits and their offshoot. The private sector education system negative effects of private sector education and it hashas created a disparity between the rich and the poor. Dr. Professor Athar Maqsood of School of Business of the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), set forward his argumentative thesis that there are two reasons behind why the privatisation has not been successful as was originally perceived are economic reasons and socio-psychological and political reasons. In the 1990s, the privatised enterprises have laid off employees by introducing schemes like golden hand shake.

The French division, led by Nicolas Godinot, defeated Joseph O'Donnell's Spanish division with heavy losses. Z√∫jar is located on Route 323, northwest of Baza, Granada in Spain. Spanish armies under Freire and Joaqu√≠n Blake y Joyes threatened the French grip on the south of Spain during the summer of 1811. Marshal Soult, who had just suffered a bloody defeat at the Battle of Albuera in May, left a colleague's army to observe the Anglo- Portuguese and marched south at the end of June. After driving off Blake's army, the marshal moved east with 12,000 men to deal with the Army of Murcia. Freire's army had enjoyed initial success in its campaign against Jean Fran√ßois Leval's weak IV Corps. At the beginning of August, Freire was joined by Blake's force, which had been shipped to the Region of Murcia by a British naval squadron. The arrival of Soult with reinforcements quickly turned the tables. While Soult faced Freire's main force, Godinot's division brushed aside one Spanish force, then threatened to block Freire's line of retreat. After Godinot savaged O'Donnell's division at Z√∫jar, Freire was able to get away. But French cavalry under Pierre Benoit Soult crushed his rear guard at Las Vertientes, east of C√∫llar. After the twin defeats, the Murcian army scattered into the mountains. Background Since being mauled at the Battle of Baza on 4 November 1810, the Army of Murcia remained inert. Defending against it was the French IV Corps under General of Division Horace Fran√ßois Bastien S√©bastiani de La Porta. In April 1811, Marshal Nicolas Soult began drawing troops away from the area so that he could strike at an Anglo- Portuguese army to the west. At this time, General of Division Jean Fran√ßois Leval assumed command of the seriously attenuated IV Corps.Oman (1996), IV, 477 On 1 June 1811, General Manuel Alberto Freire de Andrade y Armijo commanded 14,453 soldiers present under arms in the Army of Murcia. Also known as the 3rd Army, this body of troops consisted of three infantry and two cavalry divisions. Brigadier General A. La Cuadra commanded 4,015 men in the 1st Division, Brigadier General Juan Creagh led 4,442 soldiers in the 2nd Division, Brigadier General Antonio Sanz directed 3,220 infantry in the 3rd Division, Brigadier General M. Ladron commanded 1,014 troopers in the 1st Cavalry Division, and Brigadier General V. Osorio led 709 horsemen in the 2nd Cavalry Division. There were 786 artillerymen and 267 sappers. The 2,180-man garrison of Cartagena also fell under Freire's orders.Oman (1996), IV, 637 Taking advantage of French weakness, Freire pushed westward on the Lorca to Baza to Granada highway with the divisions of Creagh, Sanz, and the cavalry. Meanwhile, La Cuadra's division diverged to the north on the road to Pozo Alc√≥n. Freire's advance was slow and cautious, allowing Leval to retreat without being hustled along. Nevertheless, the French general abandoned the Mediterranean coast between Almer√≠a and Motril and the towns of Baza and Guadix. Troops from La Cuadra's command raided as far northwest as √öbeda. Agents from Freire's column stirred up the local guerillas, including the band led by the Conde de Montijo. These cut the supply lines between Granada and M√°laga. With only 3,000 to 4,000 troops, Leval was in a dilemma. He was out of touch with his Polish division in M√°laga and his garrisons at Ja√©n and Cordova. To seriously oppose Freire, he had to concentrate his command, but he was forbidden to do so by Soult.Oman (1996), IV, 478 Meanwhile, William Beresford's Allied army defeated Soult at the Battle of Albuera on 16 May 1811. Casualties in the engagement were appalling. French losses are estimated at 7,000 men killed, wounded, and captured. British casualties numbered 4,156, Spanish losses were 1,359, and 389 Portuguese fell, for a total of 5,904 Allied casualties.Smith (1998), 362‚Äì363 Despite the victory, the Second Siege of Badajoz ended with the Allies raising the siege on 10 June and falling back to Elvas in Portugal. This was because Marshal Auguste Marmont appeared on the scene with a second French army. Meanwhile, Joaqu√≠n Blake y Joyes took 10,000 Spanish troops and marched south. Hearing reports of Freire's activity and worried about Blake's column, Soult marched away on 24 June, leaving Marmont to face the Allies. First he headed to Niebla where Blake was besieging a French garrison. The Spanish general marched rapidly south and his troops were taken on board a British squadronGates (2002), 274‚Äì276 at Ayamonte on 8 July. Blake's force landed at Cadiz on 10 July and the general immediately lobbied the Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom to be made Captain General of the provinces of Murcia, Aragon, and Valencia. Granted his wish, he sailed at the end of July with 7,000 infantry and 500 cavalry in the divisions of Jos√© Pascual de Zayas y Chac√≥n and Manuel Lardizabal. Landing at Almer√≠a on 31 July, Blake marched his troops north toward Baza. This accretion of strength would place Leval's outnumbered force in a truly alarming situation. However, Blake and Zayas hurried off to Valencia where they began to prepare the city to face Marshal Louis Gabriel Suchet's army, which hovered to the northeast. Battle Joaqu√≠n Blake y Joyes On 3 August 1811, Blake's troops joined Freire's army near Baza, so that he had 15,000 foot soldiers and nearly 2,000 horsemen on hand. With Zayas absent, Joseph O'Donnell became the acting commander of his division.Oman (1996), IV, 479 At Albuera, Lardizabal's command had included two battalions of the Murcia Line Infantry, and one battalion each of the Campo Mayor, Canarias, and 2nd of Leon Line Infantry Regiments. Zayas' division had consisted of the 2nd and 4th Battalions of the Spanish Guards, the 4th Battalion of the Walloon Guards, the Legion Estranjera, and the Ciudad Real, Irlanda, Patria, and Toledo Line Infantry Regiments.Smith (1998), 362 Being superseded by Blake seemed to take away what little initiative that Freire had. Historian Charles Oman wrote that Freire had Leval \\"absolutely at his mercy\\" beginning on 3 August. Yet all the Spanish general did was position his army behind a ravine near Gor, which was west of Baza. At the end of July, Soult ordered General of Division Nicolas Godinot to march to Ja√©n. When he heard that Freire was being reinforced, he left Seville on 3 August to rescue Leval. Soult took four cavalry regiments under General of Division Marie Victor de Fay, marquis de Latour-Maubourg and part of General of Division Nicolas Fran√ßois Conroux's division. After a forced march, the French marshal arrived at Granada on 7 August. Between 3 and 7 August 1811, Freire frittered away his chance to crush Leval. Soult left Granada and reached the Gor ravine on 9 August with 6,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry. The position was so strong that Soult made no attempt to attack, but instead mounted occasional bombardments of the Spanish lines. Earlier, Soult had ordered Godinot to advance from Ja√©n against La Cuadra's position at Pozo Alc√≥n. Godinot left Baeza on the 7th with at least 4,000 foot soldiers and 600 horsemen. In the face of this advance, La Cuadra abandoned Pozo Alc√≥n on 8 August and fell back to the east in the direction of Hu√©scar. When he heard that Godinot was coming down from the northwest, Freire sent O'Donnell's 4,000 men to occupy a blocking position at Z√∫jar and ordered La Cuadra to join him there.Oman (1996), IV, 480 On 9 August 1811, Godinot's division encountered O'Donnell at Z√∫jar. The French general's division included four battalions of the 8th Line, and three battalions each of the 16th Light and 54th Line Infantry Regiments. This force may have numbered as many as 8,000 men.Smith (1998), 366 Hoping to be reinforced by La Cuadra, O'Donnell placed his troops behind the Guardal River on the outskirts of town. In the afternoon, Godinot fell on the Spanish troops and routed them. O'Donnell's division lost 423 killed and wounded, and 1,000 captured or missing.Emilio de Diego Espana: El Infierno De Napoleon 2008 - Page 390 \\" ... de la guarnici√≥n granadina se march√≥ al encuentro del general espa√±ol, mientras Godinot derrotaba a la Divisi√≥n de Cruz Mour- ge√≥n en Z√∫jar, caus√°ndole 1.400 bajas, y se abr√≠a camino a Baza\\" Results Marshal Nicolas Soult Godinot was only from Baza. Possession of that city would cut off Freire's retreat route, but the French general hesitated. La Cuadra was reported approaching from the east and his men were worn out from marching and fighting. So Godinot halted his troops and threw out scouts. Meanwhile, Freire heard of O'Donnell's rout and slipped away from the Gor ravine in the evening and marched his entire army through Baza at night. At daylight on 10 August, Soult found the Gor lines empty and ordered Latour-Maubourg to conduct an immediate pursuit.Oman (1996), IV, 481 The French cavalry caught up with Freire's rear guard at Las Vertientes, east of Baza. The Spanish general posted the divisions of Loy and Osorio to protect his infantry. However, General of Brigade Pierre Benoit Soult led a charge which routed the Spanish cavalry. With their cavalry shattered, the Spanish infantry left the main highway and made for the hills. Creagh, Lardizabal, and La Cuadra retreated to the north in the direction of Caravaca de la Cruz while Sanz and O'Donnell withdrew to the south toward Oria and Albox. The flight was so rapid that one retreating column covered on the 10th. Marshal Soult reached V√©lez-Rubio on the main highway with 12,000 troops. With Freire's army split in two, the city of Murcia, east was utterly unprotected. But the marshal determined to suppress the guerillas instead. On 14 August the two parts of the Spanish army rendezvoused at Alcantarilla, just west of Murcia, where Blake rejoined them. The army numbered 4,000 fewer men than it had when it began the campaign. On the 14th, Soult turned back to the west and split his army into several columns. One column reoccupied Almer√≠a while the others began to hunt down the guerilla bands. The French laid a heavy hand on the countryside, sacking villages and shooting people out of hand. Soult also exhibited harshness. During the campaign, the French captured Charles Cl√©ry, an √©migr√© officer, the son of the servant of King Louis XVI of France. Though the man had since served in both the Austrian and Spanish armies, Soult had the man court-martialled and shot.Oman (1996), IV, 482 The French did not have things all their own way. Conde de Montijo's band captured two companies of Poles near Motril on 21 August. Soon afterward, his men repulsed a 1,500-man French column.Oman (1996), IV, 483 The next combat in the region was the Battle of Bornos on 5 November 1811.Smith (1998), 368‚Äì369 NotesReferences Battles involving France Battles involving Spain Battles of the Peninsular War Conflicts in 1811 August 1811 events ","title":"Battle of Z√∫jar"},{"id":"36000502","text":"Bellefonte Township is one of 20 current townships in Boone County, Arkansas, USA.\\"Bellefonte Township, Boone County, Arkansas.\\" U.S. Census Bureau.

Kwajelyn Jackson has been executive director since 2018. History The Feminist Women's Health Center (FWHC) was founded in 1977. Like many other feminist health centers, the Atlanta FWHC was born out of self-help groups, where women learned to examine their own cervixes. Today, the Atlanta Feminist Women's Health Center is one of several extant feminist health centers.  Early member of Federation of Feminist Women‚Äôs Health Centers  The Atlanta Feminist Women's Health Center was a member clinic of the Federation of Feminist Women's Health Centers (FFWHC). The Federation of Feminist Women's Health Centers originated in Los Angeles, and subsequently member clinics opened throughout California and eventually other parts of the country, including Tallahassee, Florida and Atlanta, Georgia. Women's health movement historian Sandra Morgen notes, \\"Until the National Black Women's Health Project‚Ä¶ in the 1980s, the FFWHC was the only multiple-site group in the larger women's health movement.\\" All member clinics provided abortion and gynecological health care, and worked together to \\"espouse a unified ideology and identifiable politics.\\"Morgen, 100. The FFWHC member clinics stood out from others in the women's health movement because they adopted a more hierarchal model when other feminist clinics were operating as collectives. The debate and dispute over the FFWHC's mode of operation reached a point where some women's health centers refused to refer clients to FFWHC clinics for abortions. In 1990, Carol Downer, founder of the Los Angeles FWHC and leader in the women's health movement, responded to the controversy: \\"Most of the criticisms I've heard revolve around hierarchy‚Ä¶ I might say it was the difference between being organized and disorganized‚Ä¶ It's hard for me to understand why anyone who goes into a political arena doesn't want to be as organized as they can possibly be‚Ä¶ if you really are serious about what you are doing. Because otherwise you are the mercy of these larger forces which are organized.\\" Morgen, 104. A few years after moving their headquarters to Eugene, Oregon, the costs of operating the FFWHC offices proved too expensive. Although the member clinics stay in touch, they are no longer formally connected as a federation.Morgen, 105. However, most of these clinics, including the Atlanta FWHC, are now part of a new consortium of women's health care providers, the Feminist Abortion Network. Health Services The Feminist Women's Health Center offers a variety of sexual and reproductive health care programs, many of which are designed to reach historically underserved populations within the Atlanta community. In addition to providing comprehensive gynecological services, the center was also a leader in offerings trans health services and donor insemination.  Abortion care  FWHC provides both surgical and medication abortions in their Atlanta clinic. In 2017 and 2018, FWHC served 3,867 patients with abortion care, including patients surviving trauma and dealing with fetal anomalies.  Sexual health and wellness  FWHC offers affordable annual wellness exams, pregnancy testing, miscarriage care, birth control and emergency contraception options, sexually transmitted infection screening and treatment, and HIV testing and counseling. In 2017 and 2018, FWHC provided these services to 1,074 patients. Trans Health Initiative The Feminist Women's Health Center began offering health services to transmasculine individuals in 2000. The Trans Health Initiative was founded in the memory of Robert Eads, a partially transitioned trans man who died of ovarian cancer at the age of 53 after being denied medical care. The Feminist Women's Health Center first offered low-cost gynecological services to trans men at the annual Southern Comfort Conference, and continue to offer services at the conference as the Robert Eads Clinic. The Clinic saw more and more patients each year, and in June 2008, the FWHC began offering services to trans men year-round through the Trans Health Initiative.Bader. The Trans Health Initiative serves clients throughout the Southeast. Many of the clinic's clients have traveled across state lines because there is no trans-friendly health care provider in their own state. In addition to providing their clients with non-judgmental health care, the Trans Health Initiative is also working to educate the medical community about transgender health.Bader. Donor Insemination The donor insemination program began at the Feminist Women's Health Center in 1988. The program began because most infertility specialists in the southern United States were only willing to offer their services to married women, leaving single heterosexual women and lesbians alike unable to access fertility treatments. When the FWHC began offering its donor insemination services, it was only one of about a dozen clinics in the entire country to offer these services. In a 1990 profile of the program, an employee of the center noted that only about 5% of the women seeking donor insemination were married, and about a third of the program's clients were lesbians.Downey. In 2012, about 90% of clients identified as lesbians. In 2014, with fertility services and clinics more widely available, FWHC ended the donor insemination program to refocus efforts and resources on other services.  Legislative Advocacy  Feminist Women‚Äôs Health Center has formally advocated for legal access to abortion and healthcare at the local and state level for more than 20 years. FWHC engages a full-time lobbyist at the state Capitol, mobilizes community members for action alerts, coordinates advocacy days where volunteers can learn about the politics of reproductive justice and lobby their state legislators, and educates on laws relevant to reproductive justice and legislative process, including voter engagement.  Lawsuit challenging Georgia abortion ban  During the 2019-2020 legislative session, the Georgia House and Senate passed House Bill 481, fetal heartbeat bill to effectively ban abortion in the state, and one of the most restrictive anti-abortion measures in the United States. In May 2019, Governor Brian Kemp signed HB 481 to go into effect January 1, 2020. That June, Feminist Women‚Äôs Health Center partnered with the American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Reproductive Rights, Planned Parenthood and other reproductive justice organizations to file SisterSong v. Kemp in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia to challenge the constitutionality of the ban. Judge Steve C. Jones ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, granting an injunction preventing the ban from being enforced in January 2020, as the case continues to move through the courts.  Walk in My Shoes, Hear Our Voice  On March 12, 2012, the Feminist Women's Health Center organized a protest at the Georgia State Capitol, along with a wide range coalition partners that included ACLU ‚Äì Georgia and SisterSong Reproductive Justice Collective. The protest was in response to a spate of legislation that would restrict Georgia women's access to reproductive health care, ranging from religious exemptions for birth control coverage to a twenty-week abortion ban. Over five hundred people showed up to the protest, which was organized around the principles that women have a right to: * determine when and whether to have children, * have a healthy pregnancy and birth; * become a parent and parent with dignity, and * have safe and healthy relationships and families. Community Engagement Like other feminist health centers,Morgen, 237 Feminist Women's Health Center recognizes that access to health care is closely linked with politics and other social factors. As a result, FWHC has a community engagement and advocacy department in addition to providing health care at their clinic. FWHC's community engagement has transpired through a variety of programs designed to serve specific populations, including Black women, refugees, queer women, men, and young leaders. Today, the clinic engages volunteers and hosts a reproductive justice book club, in addition to key programs, the Lifting Latinx Voices initiative and the Errin J. Vuley Fellows Program. The Lifting Latinx Voices Initiative, a health outreach program that strives to empower and educate the Latinx community in addition to addressing health disparities that impact Latinx people. Using the community leadership model of promotores de salud from Latin American countries, the initiative offers open and safe spaces to discuss reproductive health and address specific needs and barriers. The Errin J. Vuley Fellows Program was launched in 2017 to support community leaders in building skills and knowledge through a reproductive justice framework. Named for FWHC‚Äôs first community engagement coordinator, the fellowship focuses especially on Vuley‚Äôs advocacy for abortion access, trans justice and racial justice. Through monthly workshops and retreats, fellows learn from each other and community organizations, setting them up for futures in movement work.

Many feminist health centers were founded in the 1970s as part of the women's health movement in the United States. These centers were founded with the purposes of challenging the medicalization of health care, providing an alternative to mainstream health facilities, and increasing access to gynecological information and services for all women, regardless of race, class, sexual orientation, or insurance coverage. History Feminist health centers emerged as a part of the women's health movement in the 1970s. The women's health movement grew out of social movements of the 1960s, including the New Left, the Civil Rights Movement, and dissatisfaction with the delivery of women's health care. Members of the women's health movement saw health care as a highly politicized issue and wanted to challenge the racism, classism, and sexism they saw in professionalized medicine. In her history of the women's health movement, feminist anthropologist Sandra Morgen notes, ‚ÄúFeminist clinics never accounted for the majority of women‚Äôs health movement groups. But [‚Ä¶] they were vanguard organizations that were fertile soils for many of the movement‚Äôs innovations.‚ÄùMorgen, 71. Feminist health centers were intended as a challenge to the way mainstream health care was delivered. Many in the women's health movement embraced self-help, from reading the seminal text Our Bodies, Ourselves to performing illegal abortions as part of the infamous Jane Collective in Chicago. Morgen, 18-30. The philosophy of self-help was practiced in feminist health centers by the teaching of cervical self-exam, and also by creating a more collaborative relationship between the health care provider (who was not necessarily a physician) and patient. The Federation of Feminist Women's Health Centers, an organized, nationwide group of feminist health centers, published self-help books such as \\"How To Stay Out of the Gynecologist's Office.\\" These books went further than expanding women's knowledge about their own bodies by additionally enabling women to treat some common infections, such as UTIs and yeast infections, with home remedies. Health activists decried the ‚Äúdoctor knows best‚Äù model of care, noting that the professionalization of medical care had excluded women as both providers and consumers of medical care.Ginty.See Kline and Morgen. The body of scholarship that emerged from the women's health movement underscores the fact that, historically, women had been health care providers for millennia. It was not until the mid-nineteenth century that women were pushed out of medicine by increasingly professionalized health care delivery in the United States. Women were further excluded from medicine through the doctor-patient relationship, by which women were presented with minimal information or choices about the health care they received, and even their own bodies. Feminist health activists argued that the drape used by gynecologists during pelvic exams symbolized a veil of secrecy.Morgen, 124. Throughout their early years, feminist health centers struggled to uphold their ideals while simultaneously meeting the needs of their clients and their employees. Feminist scholars Myra Marx Ferree and Patricia Yancey Martin argue, ‚ÄúFeminist organizations are an amalgam, a blend of institutionalized and social movement practices. [‚Ä¶] A movement organization is not a contradiction in terms, but it is, by definition, in tension. It is always a compromise between the ideals by which it judges itself and the realities of its daily practices.‚Äù Ferree and Martin, 7-8. Many clinics realized that change was necessary for their continued operations ‚Äì for example, many feminist health centers began as collectives. While many activists believed that collective decision-making promoted egalitarianism, most clinics found that reaching a consensus took too much time, especially as organizations grew to include more personnel and began to serve more clients.Morgen, 110. While most clinics found ways to resolve, or at least maintain, the tension between ideals and practice, some refused to compromise. The Women's Community Health Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts is an example of a clinic that maintained an unyielding commitment to its political values. The women who ran the center were unwilling to rely on outside funding, feeling that outside support could coopt their mission.Morgen, 97. Unfortunately, their refusal to seek external financial support led to a short shelf life for the clinic ‚Äì the Women's Community Health Center was only open from 1974 until 1981, and was plagued by financial troubles and internal disputes throughout its existence. In addition to facing internal conflicts, many feminist health centers faced external opposition to their existence. The desire of feminist health activists to alter the delivery of health services alienated many physicians, who saw feminist health centers as offering both criticism and competition to their mainstream practices. Most feminist health centers did cooperate with the medical establishment somewhat, due in large part to state laws requiring physicians to be a part of clinic staff or to perform abortions. Although many feminist health centers initially sought female doctors to join their ranks, the exclusion of women from medical schools meant that most feminist health centers had male physicians on staff.Morgen, 92. However, not all clinics had a cooperative relationship with medical professionals. The Tallahassee Feminist Women's Health Center had to recruit out-of-town doctors to perform abortions at their clinic because the center's founder had given a newspaper interview criticizing the local medical community, thereby causing their staff physicians to quit and antagonizing other area doctors. Feminist health centers also faced (and continue to face) frequent attacks, criticism, and protests, primarily relating to their role as abortion providers. Many clinics have been attacked by arsonists and subject to bombings, with some clinics undergoing multiple attacks. Clinic workers and patients also faced harassment from anti-abortion protestors. During the 1980s, the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue was often a fixation outside of many clinics. In 1988, during the Democratic National Convention held in Atlanta, the Feminist Women's Health Center was bombarded with hundreds of protestors outside its doors, making it difficult to continue clinic operations. The Operation Rescue protests in Atlanta resulted in hundreds of arrests. Differences from mainstream health clinics Although most feminist health centers are abortion providers, not all of them are. For example, the Chicago Women's Health Center has remained committed to the principles of self-help and informed consent, and strives to provide care to underserved populations, but does not provide abortion care. Conversely, not all abortion providers are feminist health centers ‚Äì in fact, most are not, just as most providers of women's health care are not feminist. The women's health movement has succeeded in changing mainstream health care in several ways, including mandating the practice of informed consent and implementing the discussion of multiple treatment options. Thus, some practices that were once deemed radical and found primarily in feminist health centers have become routine in medical facilities throughout the country. However, feminist health centers remain distinct from their mainstream counterparts in important ways. Feminist health centers continue to see health care as a political issue ‚Äì they believe that improvements in women's health come not only from advances in medicine, but also from society making inroads against injustice and inequality.Morgen, 237. Feminist health centers will not shy away from controversial topics, including abortion, which most centers are committed to providing as a critical component of comprehensive women's health care.Morgen, 150. Furthermore, feminist health centers maintain a commitment to reaching underserved populations that is largely unseen in other medical providers. Feminist health centers provide services to minorities, immigrants, refugees, the LGBTQI community, and the uninsured.Morgen, 151. To meet these needs, clinics usually offer sliding scale or reduced fees for services, and offer free health care to those who cannot afford to pay. In addition to reaching these oft-neglected populations, feminist health centers try to provide sensitive and respectful health care, recognizing health disparities in underserved groups and tailoring their services to the needs of the communities in which they operate.

Although more than fifty such health care providers once existed, today fourteen clinics remain in operation. FAN was formed in 2006 to promote information-sharing, cross- organizational strategizing and improve the overall efficacy and reach of the member clinics. History Most of the FAN member clinics were founded in the mid- to late-1970s and were inspired by the self-help movement .See Morgen and Kline. All of the clinics opened after the decision of the Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade, which ruled that women had the constitutional right to access abortion. In addition to providing abortions, these clinics were committed to providing their clients with the knowledge necessary to participate in decisions about their own health care. Some of the clinics were even borne out of groups of women practicing self-help health care, using mirrors and speculums to examine their own cervixes. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the member clinics and activists throughout the country participated in the women's health movement, changing the way that women receive health care services in the United States. The women's health movement has been credited with changing the health care landscape in a number of ways, including: * Making pregnancy tests available over-the-counter * Requiring informational package inserts on all prescription medications (including oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy) * Allowing a partner or support person to be present during a medical appointment as the patient's advocate * Expanding and advocating for the practice of informed consent Despite the many gains of the women's health movement, independent abortion clinics have faced myriad struggles throughout their existence. Many FAN clinics have been firebombed, clinic employees have been threatened, clients have been harassed by protesters, and high-profile murders of abortion providers such as Dr. George Tiller have created challenges and fears for abortion providers. In addition to security concerns, many independent clinics face financial struggles because they provide abortion services to all women who seek them. Some of these costs are offset by abortion funds, but many clinics still struggle to remain operational. Independent clinics may also face competition from larger abortion care providers, such as Planned Parenthood. When the Yakima branch of the Cedar River Clinics closed its doors in 2010 after thirty years of operation, it cited the expansion of the Yakima Planned Parenthood's services to include first- and second-trimester abortions as playing a critical role in their inability to remain open. In addition to the ongoing struggles that the FAN clinics have faced since the 1970s, many states and state legislatures are currently hostile to abortion rights. In recent years, legislators across the fifty states have been introducing legislation that would restrict abortion access at an unprecedented rate. In 2011 alone, legislators across the country introduced over 1,100 reproductive rights-related provisions. One hundred and thirty five of these provisions passed in 36 states, exceeding the 89 provisions passed in the previous year and the 77 passed in 2009. The FAN member clinics remain committed to staying open, despite the challenges, because they believe that they offer an important alternative to \\"standard\\" healthcare. Kudra MacCalleich of the Concord Feminist Health Center framed the need for feminist health centers in terms of biodiversity: \\"Why is biodiversity so crucial? Because we know there are significant negative consequences when a species is lost, and that once we lose it, there is high improbability that we will ever get it back. I think there is a critical role to be played by the diverse and distinct types of providers we still have in our 'health care ecosystem' and that we should consider what might be the consequences of their disappearance and absorption into the corporate conglomerate.\\" In the decades that they have been open, many of the FAN clinics have expanded their services beyond abortion and gynecological care. Many, such as the Blue Mountain Clinic in Missoula, Montana, now offer services to men, ranging from STI testing to more comprehensive health care services. Others, such as the Feminist Women's Health Center in Atlanta, continue to offer health care only to women, but have expanded their services with fertility treatments, trauma survivor sensitive care, and gynecological health care for trans men. The Women's Health Specialists of California offer a \\"Teen Care-A-Van\\" that travels throughout Sacramento County to provide STI testing services and information regarding sexual health to local youth. In an interview with reproductive health news source RH Reality Check, two women from FAN member clinics (Kudra MacCaillech of the Concord Feminist Health Center and Joan Schrammeck of Cedar River Clinics) discussed the formation of the consortium. MacCaillech says of the initial idea, \\"I can't say what inspired the \\"click\\" to connect, but that's exactly what it felt like. It was exciting, but also very focused and coordinated. Initially, we were brainstorming ways to collaborate on projects and funding; projects that had not only the potential to impact the clinics in our own states and communities ‚Äì but every FWHC across the entire country.\\" Member clinics would be non- profit, independent, have a feminist philosophy and be committed to providing abortions. Before forming FAN, the women conducted a survey to find out how many feminist abortion care providers still existed ‚Äì and were alarmed by the number that had closed. Since forming FAN, two more feminist clinics have closed: Aradia Women's Health in Seattle, WA and A Woman's Choice Clinic in Oakland, CA. Goals of FAN Today The self-stated goals of the consortium are: * Exposing fake abortion clinics (also known as crisis pregnancy centers) * Overturning the Hyde Amendment * Retaining a commitment to providing women with abortions, regardless of financial status or insurance * Continue to work with allied organizations, such as NARAL, Feminist Majority Foundation, and the National Abortion Federation * Participate in health care reform implementation to ensure that women's needs are being met * Continue to engage with allied social justice movements, such as domestic violence prevention Member Clinics Listed in alphabetical order: * Blue Mountain Clinic in Missoula, Montana * Cedar River Clinics in Renton and Tacoma, Washington * Concord Feminist Health Center in Concord, New Hampshire * Emma Goldman Clinic in Iowa City, Iowa * Feminist Women's Health Center in Atlanta, GA * Joan G.

The book, composed of two volumes, was published in 1703, originally in French as Nouveaux Voyages de Mr. le Baron de Lahontan dans l‚ÄôAm√©rique Septentrionale. An English edition was produced the same year. The book is considered to be the best 17th century work on New France for its detailed descriptions of the environment as well as North American native society. Lahontan‚Äôs work includes descriptions of the two winters he spent hunting with a group of the Algonquin people. Lahontan expresses his opinions of New France and the natives as well as European society through his dialogue between himself and a fictional native, Adario, based on the Huron chief Kondiaronk. Though fictional, this dialogue gives insight into his opinions of the native New France and Europe. Both volumes provide valuable knowledge and information on the lands of New France from the perspective of a soldier in the French army as well as an explorer who explored the landscape, native peoples and developing economic, social, and political ties between the native peoples and French explorers. The importance of the book is expressed by Gordon Sayre: ‚ÄúLahontan takes a secular perspective throughout his writing which differentiates his works from those of the Jesuits that published during the same time he did‚Äù. This book is an exploration narrative that tells an explorer's stories but also serves as a historical source for examining the American Indians in the New France region and the connections between the explorers and native peoples. Volume I Volume I has two sections: Lahontan's letters to a friend and his memoirs. Both provide descriptions of his journeys. The letters document his interactions with natives as well as superior French figures in Quebec, Montreal, and Sault Ste. Marie while the memoirs provide more in depth descriptions of geographical locations, detailed descriptions of the wildlife and lists of native vocabulary. Letters Lahontan writes twenty-five letters to an ‚Äòold, bigoted relation‚Äô for whom he promises to describe his travels and discoveries. They take place within the span of nine years from November 1683 to January 1692.https://www.wdl.org/en/item/15514/ The letters are lengthy descriptions that begin with one dated November 8, 1683 which tells of his voyage from France to Canada, in which he details a good trip with the exception of a storm that took place. They arrive in the bay of St. Lawrence and finally Quebec. Lahontan is particularly taken aback by the abundance of crops and land for growing as well as the existence of brothels in Quebec, which the French brought with them. He speaks of Quebec as the metropolitan of New France, containing upper and lower cities, the latter for the merchants and their homes and the former for the rest of the populace. The city is well built with lots of homes, six churches, a Cathedral in the upper city and a Jesuit in the lower and it is in letter three that he makes his first commentary on the native people ‚Äì that he has heard they travel thousands of leagues in bark canoes. In June 1684, Lahontan writes about the Iroquois, who he describes as ‚Äúbarbarians‚Äù who are independent, consider themselves sovereign, and are constantly waging war. Lahontan discusses the peace talks the Canadians had with the Iroquois and the importance of bringing them into their commerce system of trade in order to stabilize the peace. The natives around Quebec were the Algonquin and Iroquois, the French quickly developed trade with them as Lahontan observes, it is made of largely of trading beaver skins for axes, arms, kettles, and knives. The beaver was an important feature of Algonquin life, especially for the fur and pelt trade but also in the everyday lives of natives as a source of food and warm clothing. (New Voyages to North America, 1703) The waterways of Canada are essential for this trade to function because the native peoples' main mode of transportation used canoes, which could carry their furs for trade and allowed for them to navigate the St. Lawrence River. Lahontan notes that the natives are incredibly agile at navigating the waters. He spends a winter hunting with the Algonquin ‚Äúin order to develop a more perfect knowledge of their language‚Äù while the city of Montreal is fortified to be protected against attacks. Lahontan writes that the way the Indians fought was comical, with their ‚Äúbows and arrows and stark nakedness.‚Äù Montreal was the city of merchants, some traveling only once a year there to sell their goods such as wine. The governors spent their winters there as well, hence the need for fortifications. During the winter Lahontan is introduced to the native way of hunting elk, the use of ‚Äúrackets‚Äù (or snow shoes) which he finds to be useful. He observes that hunting is a huge part of native culture for survival, unlike in France where hunting is a sport for the wealthy. In the winter of 1689 Lahontan went elk hunting with a group of Algonquins. These snow shoes or \\"rackets\\" are what they wore when hunting. (New Voyages to North America, 1703) In May 1689, Lahontan is issued with orders to march from Fort Michilimackinac to the Great Lakes and explore the waterways. During this journey, he has encounters with the Hurons at Fort St. Joseph. Lahontan continues his travels around the Great Lakes region describing the country around Michilimackinac, specifically detailing his trip down the ‚ÄúRivi√®re Longue‚Äù (some scholars argue that he had discovered the Missouri River, while others consider this a fanciful tale).Lanct√¥t, Gustave. The Oakes Collection. Ottawa: J.O. Patenaude, 1940. 13; Paul Mapp, The Elusive West and the Contest for Empire, 1713-1763. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2011, 197 Lahontan includes various descriptions of beavers and his own personal creation of maps of the region. After a final altercation with a group of Iroquois that ended in their deaths by burning, Lahontan heads back to France in October 1692. From Nantes, in 1693, Lahontan writes that he has been given Lieutenancy of the Newfound Land as well as an independent company and in January 1694 he departs for Portugal. Memoirs The memoirs are an expansion on the descriptions presented in the letters. Lahontan expands further on the geography of New France. He describes his journeys down into Lake Superior and then further south into Lake Huron and Lake Erie. While geographically situating these bodies of water he discusses what can be found on the shores of the lakes, citing the native peoples that live there as well as the animals that are present. He continues on with specific descriptions of the wildlife, fish in particular as well as the environment. He also provides vocabulary lists of native terminology. This map drawn by Lahontan depicts the geographical area of New France he traveled most notably the Lake of the Hurons (Lake Huron) and the River St. Laurence (St. Lawrence River) (New Voyages to North America, 1703) Volume II Lahontan's second volume contains discourses on various topics of native life including: habits, temperament, customs, beliefs, love and marriage, diseases and remedies, hunting, military art, Coats of Arms, and hieroglyphics. The second half of volume II is a dialogue between the author and Adario, a fictional native Lahontan created, and lastly an appendix giving details about Lahontan's other voyages to Portugal and Denmark as well as maps and pictures. The discourse provides information that is easily visible in this drawing, information on child rearing tactics, native dress for various activities, and village plans. (New Voyages to North America, 1703) Dialogue Between Lahontan and Adario The dialogue is a conversation between Lahontan and a Huron, whom he describes as \\"a noted man among the savages\\". The two discuss the fundamental differences between themselves, Lahontan as a French man, and Adario as a Huron. *First Meeting: They begin by debating whose is the greater god. Lahontan is a fierce defender of Jesuit teachings and the Christian God, while Adario speaks of the Great Spirit and the tyrannical nature of God for creating a man who seems to live in misery. Adario then comments on how the English and French each have their own god, and each believes that their own is the best. He continues by speaking negatively about Christians' use of scripture. He goes through the commandments Christians claim to believe and finds a negative example for each. He notes that the French trade on the Holy Days, they do not offer their most valuable goods as sacrifice to God, they lie and slander friends, and speak or take snuff during mass, all of which suggest the French to be infidels to their faith. Lahontan refutes Adario's attacks on the documents of the Jesuit teachings by pointing out that it takes strength to succeed in truly living up to the professions the French make about their faith, although he acknowledges Adario's statements as just. Lahontan finds fault in the sexual relations between unmarried Huron men and women, which Adario defends in terms of the Hurons' ability to explore and choose partners liberally. Adario continues with the argument asking Lahontan to refer to the behaviors of the \\"French man\\" and not \\"men\\" in general as he does not believe that all men act as the French do especially with reference to clergy in France, that teach purity but do not practice it. Lahontan defends the French clergy by stating that a few black priests are not representative of the institution as a whole. *Second Meeting: Lahontan describes the importance of the Jesuit teachings of God, and Adario responds that those teachings are confusing and that the Jesuits may baptize as many Hurons as they wish but that they should never expect the Hurons to understand the significance of baptism. Along with the criticism of baptism he notes that the black devil he speaks of is not the soul but rather in France and French laws. Lahontan explains that the importance of law is not in the laws themselves but the judges that judge with virtue, in front of which a monarch is a slave. Adario still does not seem to understand and tells an anecdote in which he talks about a journey between Rochel and Paris during which he saw a man condemned to the gallows for \\"having a bag of salt on him\\" which seems totally absurd to him as well as the French laws against hunting game. Lahontan explains that hunting is a privilege for the landlords who have certain rights, however Adario simply views these laws as prison-like and would be of no use to the Hurons. *Third Meeting: Adario explains that the more he thinks about the French, the less happiness he finds among them due to their interest in money and the importance of it in their society. However, Lahontan quickly assures Adario that Europe could not live without riches, gold and silver, and without money Europe would become chaos. Adario supports the Huron way of life, living in huts and shooting arrows, while Lahontan questions his commitment to truly believing that the Huron way of life of boiled meals and beaver skins is satisfying. Adario questions the French lifestyle and calls upon Lahontan to think about how his ancestors lived, to which Lahontan replies that Adario must \\"relish too much the savage strain.\\" After a discussion on the tranquility of the mind, Adario suggests that Lahontan should become a Huron in order to prolong his life. Lahontan's response consists of worry for the risk such an act would engender in France as well as his questions about being able to subsist on the Huron diet, to which Adario proclaims Lahontan prefers slavery to liberty. *Fourth Meeting: Lahontan comes to Adario offering sympathies for Adario's grandfather who is ill. Adario promptly blames the French medical methods for the deaths of others he knew and his discontent for the fact that men are dying that should have lived much longer. In this discussion Lahontan and Adario express their views concerning medicine. The dialogue concludes here with a reiteration of both Adario's and Lahontan's perceptions of French and Huron society: Lahontan compares the savage to a clown, and Adario claims that the French are as foolish as the natives. Interpretations=Les Sauvages Am√©ricains Les Sauvages Am√©ricains by Gordon Sayre describes 17th century New France and North America by exploring both what Lahontan was writing about as well as Lahontan himself in order to create a picture of how European were interacting with the Native Americans and how both parties felt about each other. Sayre writes that Lahontan‚Äôs ‚Äútext both analyzes Indian life for insights into European culture and imposes European categories on Indian culture.‚Äù Sayre also points on that unlike others at the time who interpreted the actions of the natives from a religious and moral perspective Lahontan used one of enlightenment, which puts him ahead of the times. This is especially true with reference to native customs, which he believed that ‚Äústrong passions such as love and jealousy were contrary to reason, and led to pointless strife and violence.‚Äù The work is significant in Sayre's opinion for its ethnographic fieldwork. Lahontan‚Äôs letters though incredibly knowledgeable in providing information about his travels in New France could be limited by ‚Äútime and experience‚Äù suggests Sayre whereas the memoirs stem from a large collection of documents leaving some inconsistency. The details are valuable for learning the facts about the fur trade, pelt prices, beavers, geography and the Algonquin customs among others. Lahontan‚Äôs dialogue is a noted literary work for his ability to transform his writing into a secular work that took opinions from both parties with considerable amount of satire that adds to the dialogues meaning and allows for varying interpretations. Lasting Impressions Lahontan‚Äôs book remains one of the most influential in exploring the native life of New France in the 17th century. The book contained a vast vocabulary that Lahontan carefully noted. One such notation was omitted in the published translation of the book. It was Lahontan‚Äôs comments that instead of peasants or ‚ÄúBoors‚Äù one should say habitants, and today the Quebecois have pride for the nickname habitants, which they use for themselves and hockey team.

Mais was born in Westbury on Trym, Bristol, England, the son of Henry Mais (1805‚Äì1888), engineer, and his wife Amelia Jane, n√©e Coathupe (1803‚Äì1868). Mais junior was educated at Bishop's College, Bristol, and was articled for seven years to W. M. Peniston, one of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's chief engineers, working on English railways. At Birmingham, Mais made steam engines and superintended the building of locomotives at Swindon, in 1850 he worked on the Port of Hull docks. Mais migrated to Australia, intending to start an engineering business arriving in Sydney in December 1850. However, he found unsettled conditions and became acting engineer for the Sydney Railway Company. Later he worked as assistant engineer for City Commissioners' Department on the water and sewerage works. In January 1857 a select committee accused him of inexcusable errors and 'gross misconduct'. Mais then went to Victoria and worked for the railway contractors Cornish & Bruce on the Sandhurst-Melbourne line.

It is a German-Russian- Ukrainian co-production. The film was released on August 9, 2011, at the Locarno Film Festival. The official slogan is: \\"Sometimes the border goes not between ‚Äúthem‚Äù and ‚Äúus‚Äù, but between good and evil\\".  Plot  It is one of the last days before the capitulation of Nazi Germany in May 1945. The setting is the Baltic coast in Pomerania. A unit of the Soviet Army, comprising seven men and led by a captain nicknamed \\"Gorynych\\" (\\"dragon\\") (Alexei Guskov) by his companions, has left for reconnaissance and observation of the movements of the retreating Germans. The group is housed in a large building, a shelter for orphaned girls. A German Army detachment is situated close by, awaiting transport for evacuation by sea to Denmark, where they plan to surrender to the British. Both parties understand that the war is almost over; they do not want to engage each other and choose to wait things out. But resistance is not over for a teenage orphan Peter (Paul Wenzel), who was indoctrinated in the \\"no surrender\\" tradition of National Socialism. Soviet intelligence officers disarm him and patiently try to neutralize his youthful aggression. On May 8, 1945, Victory in Europe Day, a Soviet major who is commander of the division that includes the reconnaissance unit, arrives with Red Army troops. He was drunk on the occasion of Germany's capitulation. The major tries to rape one of the German girls, but the captain disarms him and stops the attempt. Wishing to eliminate witnesses of his indecent behavior, the major said that the enemy, in disguise, infiltrated the building, and began an assault by his unit. The German detachment did not surrender but came to rescue the children. Then they made provisions for the safe withdrawal of the orphans on a fishing launch to Denmark.  Cast  * Paul Wenzel as Peter * Alexei Guskov as Captain, commander of the reconnaissance * Ivan Shvedoff as Trubitsin, scout * Andrew Merzlikin as Gray, the scout * Sergei Legostaev as Ivanov, a scout * Merab Ninidze as Major *Gerald Alexander Held as Colonel Wald * Martin Brambach as Lt. Wendt * Angelina Henchy as Anna * Petra Kelling as patroness of the shelter  Reliability  Alexei Guskov, the producer and the lead actor, based the screenplay on a work by Dmitry Faust. The author, telling the story of Marshal of the Soviet Union, K. Moskalenko, described the reported case of German troops coming to the aid of the small Soviet reconnaissance unit. Scouts prevented the drunken major - a tank officer - from raping a German girl. The plausibility of the story was supported by its publication in the prestigious Russian historical illustrated magazine Rodina. However, the same journal contained an article by Boris Sokolov, in which he called into question the authenticity of the political report quoted by Dmitry Faust. Later, other historians argued that the story was totally fictional, unsupported by archival documents. In particular, the Russian historian Alexei Isaev said Faust had actually written about the \\"brotherhood of the weapon\\" on the island of R√ºgen.

It operated between 1973 and 1989. History=Early years It was founded in October 1972 by several entrepreneurs who included Humberto Arbel√°ez and Jorge Yarce. It was a non- profit corporation. It began operations in 1973, with its first major success Dialogando, a docu-drama. Though it was new it came out of the licitaci√≥n of 1973 with what was then one of Colombian television's prized timeslots: 8pm Thursdays on Primera Cadena. Dialogando was so successful it would remain on the air until 1989. In the licitaci√≥n of 1976 Promec received 3.5 hours of programming a week, including its first venture into foreign programs. Other early programs were Las Se√±oritas Guti√©rrez, a comedy written by Mar√≠a Victoria de Restrepo and whose family would found its own programadora in 1979. It competed against Caracol's mainstay S√°bados Felices. Also in 1979, with a new licitaci√≥n and four hours a week, it would enter the world of telenovelas, producing shows such as El √Ångel de la Calle and Entre Primos. Promec was one of the first programadoras to bring Japanese anime to the country; it also created a space in 1982 known as Grandes Series Mundiales, in which various foreign programs were presented. Promec would further expand its output to 4.5 hours a week after the bidding cycle of 1981. Promec: much more than a programadora Beginning in 1979, Promec had been loaning out equipment and services to other programadoras, including Producciones Eduardo Lemaitre, and producing programs such as Revivamos Nuestra Historia, Valores Humanos and Todos contra Todos. It founded the Colprensa news agency in 1981, edited and produced Arco magazine, and founded Producciones Promec, an independent concern that made available the company's production and post- production services, including commercial production. This arm would outlast the programadora, changing names in 1992 to Innovisi√≥n Video S.A. In 1972, before Promec, Arbel√°ez had founded Procol, a talent cooperative which included actors, directors, and producers. Procol also created and produced shows for other programadoras, such as Pecados de Ayer in 1974 for Colombiana de Televisi√≥n. In the news business In 1983, Promec bid for and received a newscast as part of its six hours a week of programs. Noticiero Promec aired at the weekends at 8pm on Cadena Uno, quickly finding a rival in Producciones Cinevisi√≥n's Noticiero Cinevisi√≥n, newly moved from weekdays in the licitaci√≥n of 1983. Gustavo Ni√±o Mendoza, Jota Mario Valencia and Julio Nieto Bernal hosted the program during its four-year run. Promec did not bid again for a newscast, as Cinevisi√≥n won the ratings war. In 1984, Promec for the first time bid for the special programming on holidays (festivos), becoming a pioneer in programming movies on those days along with Producciones Eduardo Lemaitre. 1987-91: Decline and forced closure The licitaci√≥n of 1987, unlike others before it, did not treat Promec well. Though it now had 6.5 hours a week, a minor increase over 1983, most of the awarded timeslots were not of significant quality, located in the late mornings and later at night. They were seen as slots that were hard to commercialize. Large debts to Inravisi√≥n, low ratings, and program failures such as those of El rebusque and S√°bados de Locura. In 1989, Promec handed over its spots to be programmed by Jorge Bar√≥n Televisi√≥n until the end of 1990. In 1991 they were operated by Luis Fernando Duque y Compa√±√≠a. Also in 1991, it was recommended to Inravisi√≥n by the Consejo Nacional de Televisi√≥n (CNTV) that Promec be placed under administrative expiration for its debts.\\"Promec saldr√≠a de la televisi√≥n.\\" El Tiempo 26 January 1991:link The CNTV lamented this recommendation, as it considered Promec a serious programadora that had done good work. In June 1991, it returned its spaces to Inravisi√≥n, which were awarded to other programadoras, such as PUNCH, RCN and Colombiana de Televisi√≥n, in a smaller minilicitaci√≥n in May 1991.\\"19 de septiembre, plazo m√°ximo para adjudicar licitaci√≥n de TV.\\" El Tiempo 25 April 1991: link It was one of four companies that disappeared in the period 1987-91; the other three were Jorge Enrique Pulido TV (after the death of its proprietor), Multimedia Televisi√≥n and Cromavisi√≥n, the latter two for the same reason as Promec.\\"Cromavisi√≥n saldr√≠a de la televisi√≥n.

Late 1920s or early 30s O'Gorman Coachbuilders was an Irish coach building company that traded under various names from the 1920s to the 1940s. History John Francis O'Gorman (4 February 1875 ‚Äì 27 December 1943) and his brother James (6 February 1877 ‚Äì 23 October 1963) came to Clonmel, County Tipperary, Ireland in 1899, shortly before the death of their father. They worked as apprentices at Cleary's Coachbuilder in Anglesea Street, Clonmel. John F.O'Gorman completed his learning in London and was appointed by the Department of Agricultural and Technical Instruction, to teach the Theory of Road Carriage Building. He first traded as O'Gorman Bros, Address: 12 Wellington Street, Clonmel.http://www.failteromhat.com/kelly1915/9.pdf and advertised 'Motor Bodies of every description built on the premises'. They were special Agents for Austin, Humber and Ford cars. Shortly after the First World War, John F. O'Gorman went to Germany and captured the first main dealership in Ireland for Mercedes-Benz cars. The 'O'Gorman' Coachbuilding business grew around 1920, when John F. O'Gorman bought and built a factory located at Prior Park, Clonmel, County Tipperary, Ireland. He also bought the stately 'Prior Park' house, which doubled as a store area, for the company. Together with his brother Jim, they made various horse-drawn two and four wheel vehicles. They also manufactured traps, gigs, landaus, jaunting carts, carriages, floats and dray carts. The main business however, was building bus, coach, van and lorry bodies.Drohan, Michael. \\"Memories of an Apprentice coach builder\\", The Nationalist, Tipperary, 3 September 1988.

The firm was engaged on several Government contracts, including building two limousines for a high official.

O'Gorman Brothers, employed over 100 men on one of their biggest bus orders.WHEELS OF INDUSTRY.  3 July 1928  The Commercial Motor Archive =1928 - Coachbuilders seek protection= The Irish Free State Tariff Commission considered the application for the Imposition of a Protective Tariff. Details of Coachbuilding in the Irish Free State was provided by J.F.O'Gorman. He said very few bodies for motor vehicles were made in the Free State in 1927. If they obtained a tariff they would be quite capable of providing all the commercial vehicle bodies required for the Free State. He also said there was some difficulty in procuring skilled men, many of them having been attracted to England by higher wages.IRISH COACHBUILDERS SEEK PROTECTION.  14 August 1928  The Commercial Motor Archive =1929 - Tariffs on imports= J.F. O'Gorman called on the Government to place an effective tariff on the import of coachwork and motor bodies. He said there had been an exodus of highly skilled labour from the bodybuilding industry and the industry is capable of dealing with the country's requirements.Personal Pars.  26 March 1929  The Commercial Motor Archive 1930s The chassis for the vehicles in the 1930s, were assembled in County Cork and collected by the firm's mechanics. The Clonmel factory was the largest such establishment in the South of Ireland at the time and one of the most modernly equipped factories in the country. The first mechanical paint sprayer outside Dublin and Cork was installed at O'Gormans. The factory was renowned for its strict discipline. O'Gorman Brothers were the Ford Motor Company main dealers for all County Tipperary, Waterford City and portion of County Waterford. A number of O'Gorman Brothers single decker buses were built for Irish Omnibus Company. Several of them are listed in 1932 and 1934, on the Classic Irish Buses website.The Classic Irish Buses website - Great Southern John F. O'Gorman voiced a complaint in the D√°il √âireann, Section 554 - 25 February 1931,D√°il √âireann - Volume 37 - 25 February 1931 - Rejection of Coachbuilders' Tariff Application. - Motion of Disapproval about the ease and amount of ash being exported (the principal raw wood material for the industry). Messrs O'Gorman, were also quoted by Se√°n Lemass during a D√°il √âireann debate, Volume 45 - 22 December 1932 (Finance (Customs Duties) (No. 4) Bill, 1932‚ÄîFrom the Seanad √âireann), where they claimed: the works had been occupied during the civil war, by not merely members of the Republican Army, but also by members of the National Army (The National Army was questioned by Patrick McGilligan) and that the damage done during that period had not been adequately compensated for by the Government. (See Section 1071 - 1074) The O'Gorman Coach building business continued trading until J.F. O'Gorman's death in 1943 and went into liquidation, following a downturn during the Second World War. During its operation, the company traded variously as 'O'Gorman Brothers' (to 1933), 'O'Gormans', 'John O'Gorman & Sons', 'J.F.O'Gorman (1933) Ltd' then 'J.F.O'Gorman Ltd' (until J.F.O'Gorman's death in 1943). Prior Park factory and house Around 1920 the stately Prior Park house and grounds were bought by J.F. O'Gorman (who owned the garage in Parnell Street). Much of the finance for this purchase, came from his first wife Margaret. On part of the grounds near Clonmel railway station, a large factory was built, to make bodywork for road vehicles.

Phoebe encountered the distinctive word while reading and Callie believed it to be easy to remember. All four members were born and raised in Nashville. Callie and Phoebe, daughters of Christian artist Morgan Cryar, sang background vocals on Music Row from a young age. Taylor and Bruno had grown up influenced heavily by their father's music collection, which included everything from gritty southern rock to soul. The two sets of siblings met each other at a mutual friend's campfire. In May 2009, the four came together and played for the first time, originally just playing songs that the Cryar sisters had written. \\"Things progressed in a way that none of us really could have predicted,\\" says Callie. \\"We knew that it was an intriguing sound, and we liked what was happening,\\" adds Bruno. By the following winter, they made their first record, Tell Your Mama, and released it in March 2010. The record was received with critical acclaim. It is \\"a blend of bluegrass, folk, & alternative music all held together tightly by Callie & Phoebe‚Äôs angelic harmonies & Taylor & Bruno‚Äôs hypnotic rhythms.\\" They spent the next two years on tour, performing \\"anywhere people would let [them]\\". In the beginning of 2011, they began to think about their next record, writing most of their songs while on the road. They recorded the new music in two pieces, during breaks from touring in May and August 2011, with the help of producers Anderson East and Daniel Scobey. This second record, The Fourth Wall was released on April 3, 2012.

There are two approaches to investigate the rumor spreading process: the microscopic models and the macroscopic models. The macroscopic models propose a macro view about this process are mainly based on the widely used, i.e. DK model and MK model. Particularly, we can view rumor spread as a stochastic process in social networks. While the microscopic models are more interested more on the micro intereactions between individuals.  Rumor propagation Models  In the last few years, there has been a growing interest in rumor propagation in Online social networks problems where different approaches have been proposed to investigate it. By carefully scrutinizing the existing literature, we categorize the works into macroscopic and microscopic approaches.  Macroscopic models  The first category is mainly based on the Epidemic models Daley, D.J., and Kendal, D.G. 1965 Stochastic rumors, J. Inst. Maths Applics 1, p42. where the pioneering research engaging rumor propagation under these models started during the 1960s. = Epidemic models= A standard model of rumor spreading was introduced by Daley and Kendall,Daley, D.J., and Kendal, D.G. 1965 Stochastic rumors, J. Inst. Maths Applics 1, p42. which is called DK model. Assume there are N people in total. And those people in the network are categorized into three groups: ignorants, spreaders and stiflers, which are denoted as S, I, and R respectively hereinafter: *I: people who are ignorant of the rumor; *S: people who actively spread the rumor; *R: people who have heard the rumor, but no longer are interested in spreading it. The rumor is propagated through the population by pair-wise contacts between spreaders and others in the population. Any spreader involved in a pair-wise meeting attempts to ‚Äúinfect‚Äù the other individual with the rumor. In the case this other individual is an ignorant, he or she becomes a spreader. In the other two cases, either one or both of those involved in the meeting learn that the rumor is known and decided not to tell the rumor anymore, thereby turning into stiflers. One famous variant is Maki-Thompson(MK) model.Maki, D.P. 1973 Mathematical Models and Applications, With Emphasis on Social, Life, and Management Sciences, Prentice Hall. In this model, rumor is spread by directed contacts of the spreaders with others in the population. Furthermore, when a spreader contacts another spreader only the initiating spreader becomes a stifler. Therefore, three types of interactions can happen with certain rates. ::which says when a spreader meet an ignorant, the ignorant will become a spreader. ::which says when two spreaders meet with each other, one of them will become a stifler. ::which says when a spreader meet a stifler, the spreader will lose the interest in spreading the rumor, so become a stifler. Of course we always have conservation of individuals: : N=I+S+R The change in each class in a small time interval is: : \\\\Delta S \\\\approx - \\\\Delta t \\\\alpha IS/N : \\\\Delta I \\\\approx \\\\Delta t [{\\\\alpha IS \\\\over N} - {\\\\beta I^2 \\\\over N} - {\\\\beta IR \\\\over N}] : \\\\Delta R \\\\approx \\\\Delta t [{\\\\beta I^2 \\\\over N}+{\\\\beta IR \\\\over N}] Since we know S, I and R sum up to N, we can reduce one equation from the above, which leads to a set of differential equations using relative variable x=I/N and y=S/N as follows : {dx \\\\over dt} = x \\\\alpha y - \\\\beta x^2 - \\\\beta x(1-x-y) : {dy \\\\over dt} = - \\\\alpha xy which we can write : {dx \\\\over dt} = (\\\\alpha + \\\\beta)xy - \\\\beta x : {dy \\\\over dt} = - \\\\alpha xy Compared with the ordinary SIR model, we see that the only difference to the ordinary SIR model is that we have a factor \\\\alpha + \\\\beta in the first equation instead of just \\\\alpha. We immediately see that the ignorants can only decrease since x,y\\\\ge 0 and {dy \\\\over dt}\\\\le 0. Also, if :R_0={\\\\alpha +\\\\beta \\\\over \\\\beta} >1 which means :{\\\\alpha \\\\over \\\\beta}>0 the rumour model exhibits an ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù even for arbitrarily small rate parameters. = Epidemic models in social network = We model the process introduced above on a network in discrete time, that is, we can model it as a DTMC. Say we have a network with N nodes, then we can define X_i(t) to be the state of node i at time t. Then X(t) is a stochastic process on S=\\\\\\\\{S,I,R\\\\\\\\}^N. At a single moment, some node i and node j interact with each other, and then one of them will change its state. Thus we define the function f so that for x in S,f(x,i,j) is when the state of network is x, node i and node j interact with each other, and one of them will change its state. The transition matrix depends on the number of ties of node i and node j, as well as the state of node i and node j. For any y=f(x,i,j), we try to find P(x,y). If node i is in state I and node j is in state S, then P(x,y)=\\\\alpha A_{ji}/k_i; if node i is in state I and node j is in state I, then P(x,y)=\\\\beta A_{ji}/k_i; if node i is in state I and node j is in state R, then P(x,y)=\\\\beta A_{ji}/k_i. For all other y, P(x,y)=0. The procedureBrockmann, D. 2011 Complex Networks and Systems, Lecture Notes, Northwestern University on a network is as follows: We would expect that this process spreads the rumor throughout a considerable fraction of the network. Note however that if we have a strong local clustering around a node, what can happen is that many nodes become spreaders and have neighbors who are spreaders. Then, every time we pick one of those, they will recover and can extinguish the rumor spread. On the other hand, if we have a network that is small world, that is, a network in which the shortest path between two randomly chosen nodes is much smaller than that one would expect, we can expect the rumor spread far away. Also we can compute the final number of people who once spread the news, this is given by r_\\\\infty=1-e^{-({\\\\alpha +\\\\beta \\\\over \\\\beta})r_\\\\infty} In networks the process that does not have a threshold in a well mixed population, exhibits a clear cut phase-transition in small worlds. The following graph illustrates the asymptotic value of r_\\\\infty as a function of the rewiring probability p.  Microscopic models  The microscopic approaches attracted more attention in the individual's interaction: \\"who influenced whom.\\" The known models in this category are the Information cascade(IC) and the linear threshold (LT) models [1] D.

The variety that exists in human nature makes their decision-making ability pertaining to spreading information unpredictable, which is the primary challenge to model such a complex phenomenon. Hence, this model considers the impact of human individual and social behaviors in the spreading process of the rumors. The HISBmodel proposes an approach that is parallel to other models in the literature and concerned more with how individuals spread rumors. Therefore, it try to understand the behavior of individuals, as well as their social interactions in OSNs, and highlight their impact on the dissemination of rumors. Thus, the model, attempts to answer the following question: \`\`When does an individual spread a rumor? When does an individual accept rumors? In which OSN does this individual spread the rumors?. First, it proposes a formulation of individual behavior towards a rumor analog to damped harmonic motion, which incorporates the opinions of individuals in the propagation process. Furthermore, it establishes rules of rumor transmission between individuals. As a result, it presents the HISBmodel propagation process, where new metrics are introduced to accurately assess the impact of a rumor spreading through OSNs.

History The TDOS was established in 1939 by the Tennessee General Assembly to exercise authority over the THP. Over the decades, the agency has evolved to meet new challenges, such as drug trafficking, the issuance of drivers' licenses, and terrorism. Therefore, the DOS currently comprises three divisions: the THP, the Driver License Services division, and the state Office of Homeland Security (OHS). The current commissioner of the Department of Safety is Jeff Long, who has been serving since January 2019 after being appointed by Governor Bill Lee. He is assisted by deputy and assistant commissioners, including the director of the Tennessee Highway Patrol, Col. Dereck Stewart. Functions The DOS manages the THP, OHS, and the Driver License Services division. The THP is the highway patrol agency for Tennessee, which has jurisdiction anywhere in the state. The Office of Homeland Security was created in April 2003 by an executive order by then-Governor Phil Bredesen in the aftermath of September 11, 2001. The Driver License Services division issues various kinds of identification cards, including hardship licenses for minors, graduated drivers licenses, regular driver licenses, commercial driver licenses, and state identification cards.

The case involved a claim by Tasmanian for customs tariffs collected in Victoria prior to the Commonwealth Customs Tariff coming into force. While the transitional nature of the Constitutional provisions mean that their interpretation has no ongoing significance, the case is important in that the High Court established that correct approach to the interpretation of the Australian Constitution should employ the ordinary rules of statutory interpretation.  Background  The case concerned customs and excise duties in the transition period following the federation of Australia on 1 January 1901. The intention of the Constitution was that uniform customs duties would be imposed within two years after federation. Uniform duties of customs. and that once uniform customs duties were imposed, trade, commerce, and intercourse among the States shall be absolutely free. The Constitution recognised this would take some time to implement and addressed that transition in 3 periods. The first period was from federation \\"until the imposition of uniform duties of customs.\\" Payment to States before uniform duties. The second period was from the imposition of uniform duties for 2 years Trade within the Commonwealth to be free. The third period was between 2 and 5 years from the imposition of uniform duties. Payment to States for five years after uniform tariffs. On 8 October 1901 the Commonwealth had imposed uniform customs duties. The Commonwealth had collected customs duties on goods imported into Victoria and excise duty on goods manufactured in Victoria during the first period. During the second period those goods were transported to Tasmania for consumption. The Commonwealth paid the net revenue to Victoria said to be pursuant to section 89 of the Constitution. Tasmania claimed the Commonwealth should have paid the net revenue to it.Tasmania v Commonwealth (1907) 1 CLR 329 at 337-338. It was in effect a contest between Tasmania and Victoria and while the Commonwealth was represented at the hearing, it did not present any argument.Tasmania v Commonwealth (1907) 1 CLR 329 at 336.

During a lengthy shootout that followed, Deputy Alfred O. Lund killed an outlaw named Dick Ainsley while the other outlaw, Ben Cravens, was badly wounded and captured. Background Ben Cravens and Dick Ainsley were petty thieves and or cattle rustlers, although the latter had also developed a reputation as a gunman. Little is known about their lives before 1896, except that Ainsley also went by the name of \\"Buck\\" McGregg or \\"Diamond Dick,\\" the latter because he had a diamond ring and three of his fingers shot away during a gunfight with Lincoln County policemen. On November 27, 1896, Ainsley and Cravens rode into Blackwell to purchase supplies and to case the town bank for a robbery. After completing their tasks, they then rode out of town to a small one-room shack next to a wooded ravine called Lost Creek. The location was about three and one half miles northwest of town. Because the creek was dry and the site lacked a well, Cravens went to ask the neighbor, Bert Benjamin, for some drinking water. During the conversation that followed, Cravens asked Benjamin several questions about the inside of the bank, which revealed his true intentions for being in the area. Benjamin did, however, reply casually and, on the following day, he went to tell the police about what had happened. The sheriff's deputy, J. R. Cox, was certain that Ainsley and Cravens were responsible for a recent robbery at a store in Hewins, Kansas, but, instead of organizing a posse immediately, he told Benjamin to go home and report back to him if he saw anything more of the bandits. So, on December 3, 1896, after sighting Ainsley and Cravens again, Benjamin reported back to Cox, who then raised a posse of six men, including himself. The other possemen were Alfred O. Lund, Bill Sherr, John Hunter, Jay McClain, and Richard Clarke. Lund, who became a lawman as result of the shootout, had always been interested in law enforcement, although he was beaten in past elections to determine the new city marshal and town constable of Blackwell. He was the owner of a livery stable, but the presence of Ainsley and Cravens gave him an opportunity to pursue a career in law enforcement, without having to be elected. At about midnight, the posse took up positions along a riverbank outside of town so they could ambush the outlaws when they rode in. Their plans were thwarted though when Bert Benjamin arrived and told them that Ainsley and Cravens were sleeping at the shack near his home. Because there was a risk of civilians being harmed in the event of a gunfight in the town's streets, Deputy Cox asked Benjamin to lead him and his men to the hideout. By 3:00 am, on December 4, 1896, the posse had made it to the wooded ravine, but found that the shack was being surveilled by a guard dog. Now that surprising the outlaws was no longer an option, Cox decided to split his men up to surround the place and wait until daylight to demand a surrender. Lund, Benjamin, Sherr and McClain then maneuvered through some brush to a point that covered the front door and window of the shack while Cox, Hunter, and Clarke went around back to watch the backside of the building and a small barn, where the outlaws had left their horses. Gunfight At sunrise, Dick Ainsley was spotted by the posse when he went outside the front door of the shack with a Winchester rifle in his hands. Ainsley first had a look around and then he leaned his rifle up against the shack to wash his hands. A moment later, Ben Cravens appeared at the front of the cabin, also with a rifle in hand. This was the chance Cox was waiting for. With both of the outlaws in view, Cox stood up from his hiding place and shouted: \\"You're surrounded, throw up your hands!\\" But, instead of heeding to the sheriff's demand, the outlaws raised their weapons and began firing. After the first shots, Bert Benjamin fired both barrels from his shotgun and then headed for home, apparently in fear, leaving Alfred Lund alone at his position in front of the shack. From there Lund had a good vantage point and could see how ineffective the rest of the posse's fire was, being that they were armed mainly with shotguns, which did not have the necessary range. Cravens was the first to be wounded. He was running for the corner of the shack when a rifle bullet broke his collar bone. Although seriously hurt, Cravens survived the initial shock and continued to fight on. Sometime later, Lund spotted Ainsley's rifle barrel protruding out from behind the corner of the shack. He then opened fire with his rifle and forced the bandit to retreat to some cottonwood trees in the dry creek. There Ainsley displayed some \\"fast hip shooting\\" before moving behind a fallen tree, where he waited for any of the lawmen to advance, hoping to outflank and ambush them. Lund was one step ahead of him though and, while Ainsley was waiting in ambush, Lund got the drop on him and proceeded to sneak forward to force a surrender. Before he could say anything, however, Ainsley spotted the advancing lawman and went for his gun. Lund then fired and struck Ainsley in the chest, but he did not die immediately and Lund wasn't sure if his shot reached its target. Also, the bullet that struck Ainsley passed straight through his body and killed a cow about fifty yards further up the ravine. Meanwhile, the rest of the possemen were going after Ben Cravens, who was trying to escape through some tall grass on the eastern side of the creek. At the same time Ainsley was wounded, Richard Clarke struck Cravens in the side with a load of buckshot and he fell to the ground, concealed in the grass. It took some time before the possemen were able to find where the outlaws had fallen and relieve them of their weapons. During the search, Cox and his men heard the wounded McGregg groaning and mistook him for Lund. They called out to him to see if he was okay, but the real Lund did not reply because he was afraid that it was a trick by Cravens. It was not until Lund overheard the possemen talking about where they had found Cravens that he knew who they were. Lund then ordered one of the men to find Ainsley and take his guns while he went to the eastern side of the creek to find Cravens. When he arrived in the area, Lund had one of the others fire towards the concealed Cravens, causing him to put his hand up above the grass and identify himself. The posse demanded that Cravens show both of his hands, but, after sneaking closer, they found the outlaw badly hurt, his other hand being used to hold his wounds. Aftermath Once Ainsley was dead and Cravens was in custody, Deputy Cox sent Lund into Blackwell to telephone his superior, Sheriff H. C. Master, the county attorney, Dave Weir, and the coroner from Ponca City. Ainsley's body was taken to the Blackwell Hotel and Cravens was held in a third-story room of the same building. During the following interrogation, Cravens refused to give out any information about his dead partner, except to say that his name was Dick. This made authorities believe they had killed \\"Dynamite Dick\\" Clifton, a member of the Wild Bunch, who was also missing three fingers like Ainsley. The real \\"Dynamite Dick\\" was killed in November 1897 by Chris Madsen. Because of the confusion, the United States Marshals office in Guthrie was informed and Marshal Evett Dumas Nix led five deputies to Blackwell, one of whom was Frank M. Canton. When they arrived, the marshals were taken to see Ainsley's body and the first thing Nix said was \\"I don't know this man, but he isn't Dan Clifton.\\" When they entered Cravens' room, the outlaw looked up and asked: \\"What do you want?\\" Canton replied: \\"The name of the dead man.\\" Cravens then began coughing up blood so Canton asked if there was anything that could be done. Cravens responded, saying: \\"Yes, get my father here because Im real bad and the doctors said I might not make it.\\" Canton agreed and Cravens' father arrived from Iowa two days later, however, Cravens would survive his wounds and Canton never received an answer. Even though Marshal Nix was sure that Ainsley was not Dan Clifton, there remained some speculation for a while afterward. People who viewed Ainsley's corpse claimed that he was \\"Skeeter Dick\\", \\"Three Fingered Dick\\", or some other desperado of little repute. Eventually, however, Cravens spoke up and confirmed that his partner was, in fact, Dick Ainsley, or Buck McGregg. Also, Ainsley's mother arrived in Blackwell, escorted by two Lincoln County sheriffs, and claimed the body of her son to take him home for burial. While the outlaws were in the Blackwell Hotel, rumors began circulating through town that their friends would attempt a rescue. Therefore, local citizens were deputized, armed, and positioned in the streets for defense. Although no rescue attempt was made, two \\"female bandits\\" arrived in town and began asking questions about Ainsley and Cravens. A December 11 edition of the Kildare Journal said the following: \\"Two rough and rugged females who arrived in Blackwell Monday [December 7, 1896] armed to the teeth, threw the town into spasms of excitement by their strange behavior and their suspicious inquiries concerning Cravens and \\"Dynamite Dick\\" [Dick Ainsley], the outlaws. The females were duly arrested and searched. Certain ladies who were deputized to do the searching came near to fainting away from fright. Blackwell citizens paraded the streets armed with Winchesters, anxiously on the lookout for a raid from friends of the outlaw. The females claimed to be from Guthrie.\\" Cravens was taken back to Kansas under the custody of a Deputy Powell and, in January 1897, the judge presiding over his case sentenced him to twenty years at the Kansas State Penitentiary in Lansing. Three years later, however, on November 16, 1900, Cravens escaped with a fake gun, made out of a piece of wood and some tin foil from tobacco packages. He evaded a posse, stole a horse, and was soon back in the Osage Nation committing crimes. He also convinced a young horse thief named Herbert Welty to join him. On March 18, 1901, the two bandits robbed a company store in Red Rock and killed the manager, Alvin Bateman. Cravens was disguised as a farmer and Welty posed as his wife. The trick did not work so well though because Batemen discovered their true identities and was shot down when he tried to draw his sidearm. After stealing about $1,000 and some other items, Cravens and Welty escaped on a wagon, but, somewhere just outside town, their vehicle overturned and Welty was shot in the face by his partner's shotgun. It remains uncertain if it was an accident or an attempted murder committed by Cravens, who may have wanted all of the loot for himself. Cravens left Welty for dead, but he survived his wound and walked ten to fifteen miles to a home along Black Bear Creek, where he was arrested. Welty later received a life sentence in prison for the death of Bateman. Cravens fled to the home of a friend, Isom Cunningham, a few miles south of Pawnee, where he was surrounded by a posse. He did, however, manage to shoot his way out of what was described as \\"a perfect hailstorm of bullets,\\" killing a deputy sheriff named Tom Johnson in the process. Another lawman, Deputy Jack Murray, said the following: \\"The rapidity with which he [Cravens] worked his artillery was such that the firing made a continuous sheet of flame.\\" Darlene Platt wrote: \\"Cravens emptied his rifle, fell to the ground, reloaded, came back up and emptied it again followed by his revolver.\\" At this point, Cravens disappeared and the reward offered for him went from $1,000 to $10,000, making him one of the most wanted outlaws in the territory. He resurfaced though in November 1908, when he was arrested in Missouri for stealing either a horse or some hogs, depending on differing accounts. At the time, Cravens was using the name Charles Maust and said he came to Missouri from Oregon in 1902. He had worked as a farmer for six years, married, and was considered a respectable citizens, at least until his arrest. Nobody recognized him at first so he was sentenced to four years at the prison in Jefferson City. However, not long before he was to be released, a prison barber recognized Cravens and informed his superiors. A trial was then held in Guthrie, Oklahoma and, because Cravens refused to give his real name, the authorities began assembling more than 200 witnesses, many of whom were known outlaws. Among the witnesses were Marshal Alfred O. Lund, who was days away from retiring, and Herbert Welty, Cravens' old associate. Also, Cravens was defended by Al Jennings, a reformed outlaw who was pardoned by Theodore Roosevelt. Both Lund and Welty identified Maust as Ben Cravens so he was sentenced to life in prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas on January 29, 1912. Lund's involvement in Cravens' final conviction was significant in that he was the first lawman in Oklahoma history to have both begun and ended his career confronting the same criminal.

The wedge plow forces snow to the sides of the tracks and therefore requires a large amount of force due to the compression of snow. The wedge plow is still in use today in combination with the high-maintenance rotary snowplow. Function Three features are required for optimum performance: * 1st: The plow has a smooth surface so snow will slide over the plow face rather than accumulating to be pushed along as an increasing mass.Jones, p.333 Wooden plows were carefully constructed of individually fitted boards and painted frequently to maintain a smooth surface. Steel plows can be sprayed with water in sub- freezing temperatures to form a smooth layer of ice on the plow surface. * 2nd: The plow has a horizontal wedge to lift snow above the level of snow accumulation beside the track. A cutting edge low above the rails usually employed a cast iron or steel leading edge for durability against ice and for weight to discourage the tendency of the wedge to climb over hard-packed snow causing derailment by lifting the wheels off the rails. Under most conditions, the tendency to climb was reduced by weight of snow on the upper side of the wedge, and by downward reaction force accompanying upward acceleration of lifted snow. However, this downward snow loading may be absent when a plow first strikes a snow drift or packed snow face where the plow train has previously stalled. Before making a running start against such conditions, prudent crews would dig into the lower edge of the drift or snow face creating a notch to receive and guide the leading edge of the horizontal wedge. * 3rd: The plow has a vertical wedge to push the snow horizontally away from the track. The vertical wedge may be less acute than the horizontal wedge, but often included a cast or sheet metal cutting edge on wooden plows. Pushing snow horizontally off the track may create an unbalanced horizontal force where asymmetrical snow accumulation is encountered. (such as snow drifting into one side of a cut) This unbalanced force may derail the plow. The leading edge of the horizontal wedge is typically forward of the vertical wedge so stabilizing downward snow loading precedes horizontal loads. Well-designed wedge plows work best at speeds which accelerate the snow first upward and transitioning to a horizontal acceleration casting the snow far enough from the track to avoid creating high, vertical snowbanks which would leave the cleared track a sheltered deposition site for wind-blown snow. History Four locomotives plow deep snow in February, 1869.Early roads were often rolled rather than plowed to compact accumulated snow into a surface suitable for sleighs drawn by draft animals. Rail transportation brought the requirement for snow removal by plows. In the 1840s railway companies began using bucker plows to remove snow from railways. The first incarnation of the wedge plow was the Bucker Plow which were made of wood.http://www.trainweb.org/mccloudrails/Miscellaneous/RotaryPlows.html Because of the amount of capital invested in railroads, the railways were required to be functional year-round. Because of this, snow needed to be cleared from the railways in an efficient manner. The Wedge Plow was patented by Charles Lowbaert to keep railways functional during the winter. The wedge plow typically required several locomotives to propel the plow with enough force to push through the snow. High speeds of up to were required to achieve an adequate propulsion for the removal of snow.http://www.american- rails.com/railroad-snow-plows.html Sometimes, as many as 14 locomotives were used in the process. In the case where snow was tightly packed or frozen, manual labor might still be used to clear the tracks. The process of 'ramming' through snow was accounted by historically as follows. > \\"The pushing and backing of the engines made a din unequalled since the > blacksmithy of the Cyclops. By some hocus pocus the seven engines were made > to pull togethers. After three hours of toil-there was a tremendous jerk, a > forward movement of a few moments and we were abreast of the station.\\" Henry David Thoreau also noted in his poems the \\"steady and cheerful valor of the men who inhabit the snow-plough for their winter quarters...and [to] behold the ploughmen covered with snow and rime, their heads peering above the mould-board.\\" Plowing was therefore a dangerous job with the chance of derailing the train in the process. Wedge plows are still currently used by railways as a less expensive method for clearing snow drifts from the tracks. During heavier snow conditions, rotary snowplows are used.

It was established on 1 April 1961 with the formation of the Parachute Battalion. After 1998 this unit was renamed to Parachute Training Centre. It was the first battalion within 44 Parachute Brigade until 1999 when the brigade was downsized to 44 Parachute Regiment The battalion has performed many active operations in battle ‚Äì producing many highly decorated soldiers in the South African Border War from 1966 to 1989. Their best known action was the controversial Battle of Cassinga in 1978. The unit's nickname \\"Parabat\\" is a portmanteau derived from the words \\"Parachute Battalion\\".  History =Origin In 1960 fifteen volunteers from the SADF were sent to England at RAF Abingdon, the majority to train as parachute instructors, some as parachute-packers and one SAAF pilot in the dropping of paratroopers. These men together with an older unit called 2 Mobile Watch formed the nucleus of 1 Parachute Battalion at Tempe in Bloemfontein in April 1961. UDF era 2 Mobile Watch Shoulder title The first paratroopers were Permanent Force men, but soon the training of Citizen Force (similar to the National Guard of the United States) paratroopers commenced. First Action Members of 1 Parachute Battalion were the first S.A. Army men to see action after World War II when, in 1966, they participated, with the South African Police, against insurgents in S.W.A. (South-West Africa, now Namibia).44 Parachute Brigade 1997 ‚Äì Col Skillie van der Walt In 1966, members of 1 Parachute Battalion participated in the first action in the war in South West Africa during a heliborne assault on an insurgent base. Thereafter, they were involved in operations in SWA/Namibia, Angola, Zambia, Mozambique and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and elsewhere on an almost constant basis for over 20 years. Organisation under the SADF 1 Parachute Bn. was organised as follows: *Permanent Force: ** Bn H.Q., ** H.Q. Coy and **A and B Coy's; *Citizen Force: ** C Coy Cape Town, ** D Coy Durban, ** E Coy Pretoria and ** F Coy Johannesburg Development of Sister Units Further battalions were added: 2 Para Bn in 1971 and 3 Para Bn in 1977. Border War In 1974 and 1975 1 Parachute Battalion operated along the Angolan border with S.W.A; along the Caprivi Strip; a platoon jumped near Luiana (September 1975), Angola to relieve a group of \\"Bushmen\\" trapped by a SWAPO force; and 3 platoons Joined Operation Savannah at S√° da Bandeira the day after the airport was taken (October 1975). The two platoons withdrew in February/March Operation Savannah during the Angolan Civil War in July 1975 when 1 string of 1 Parachute Battalion were flown to Ondangwa and travelled by Unimog to Ruancana on the northern border of SWA at Ruacana and Santa Clara in Angola to relieve two Portuguese communities trapped by the MPLA. The Para Brigade With the coming of 44 Parachute Brigade in April 1978, under the leadership of Brigadier M J du Plessis and Colonel Jan Breytenbach, a co-founder of the brigade. it became a powerful force. The first large airborne exercise of the Parachute Battalion Group took place in 1987 in the Northwestern Transvaal (now North West Province). With the eventual disbanding of 44 Parachute Brigade its full-time personnel were moved to Bloemfontein and incorporated into the 1 Parachute Battalion Group. New Techniques In 1986, the unit embarked on its first HALO/HAHO (High altitude Low Opening/High Altitude High Opening) course in Bloemfontein. This would enable the troops to drop into enemy territory from aircraft following commercial routes. Under the SANDF In 2001 battalion personnel formed the spearhead of the South African Protection Support Detachment deploying to Burundi.http://www.saairforce.co.za/news-and-events/140/south-african- In 2012, 1 Parachute Battalion participated in the South African military assistance to the Central African Republic operation, where the unit suffered 13 killed, with 27 injured and one missing in action in an ambush conducted by S√©l√©ka rebels.http://mg.co.za/article/2013-03-26-sandf-releases-names-of-sa- soldiers-killed-in-car In 2014 it was announced that 1 Parachute Battalion would receive Battle Honours for this operation. In 2013, the battalion contributed one company, under command of Major Vic Vrolik, to the FIB which fought a number of engagements in the DRC.  Training  Qualification Jump 1 Parachute Battalion is the sole military parachute training institution in South Africa, with its parachute School being responsible for all training. The school has had only four fatalities in its existence. 1 Parachute Battalion is a full-time unit which in addition to parachute training also conducts force training to recruits inducted into the unit and other units in the South African Army. The average age ranges in the mid-twenties. The selection and training of paratroops is rigorous to ensure a standard of combat efficiency is retained at a high level. Recruitment Members of 1 Parachute Battalion visit the various battalions each year early in the training cycle to look for volunteers. These must then pass a physical test at their unit prior to appearing before a selection board, which examines their character and motivation. Initial evaluation To give would-be members the endurance and the fitness they will need for operations in the harsh African conditions, the instructors of 44 Parachute Brigade place particular emphasis on basic physical training. Soldiers volunteering for service with the parachute forces first undergo a battery of medical tests ‚Äì similar to that for flying personnel ‚Äì before setting off on a timed run. Before they can recover their breath, they tackle the second test: run in which each man carries a comrade on his back. The applicants are then put through various psychological and physical tests ‚Äì though these are usually well within the reach of anyone with sufficient motivation and willpower. The real ordeal will then start: for four long months, the recruits Bats will endure forced marches, physical exercises, shooting sessions and inspections ‚Äî all this barracked by the screams of their eagle-eyed instructors. The South African paratroop instructors, like their British counterparts, enforce strict discipline. For example, trainees always take their grooming kit along with them on marches and at dawn, when back at the base with aching bones, devote whatever little time is left they have to rest to 'spit and polish'. Those who are accepted are then transferred to 1 Para, where they first complete the normal three-month basic training course, with some differences: PT three times a day, no walking in camp under any circumstances and a run to end each day. runs carrying tar poles; car tyres attached to the candidates by a long rope; or the dreaded concrete slab that has to be carried everywhere the candidate goes. Some 10 to 20 percent drop out during this phase, returning to their original units. All this builds up to what is called the koeikamp ('cow camp'). It is 3 days of the ultimate challenge of physical and psychological endurance. The would-be paratroops get a 24-hour ration pack or \\"rat pack\\" for the duration of the selection. During these days, they are given several tasks to perform in an allocated time: Several Night marches/runs with bergens, boxing, stretcher run over , digging trenches and the carrying of artillery canisters over during a timed run are just a few of the tasks that has to be completed. On top of all this the candidates are out in the African bush with no showers, hot meals or beds after each gruelling day. Each year the sequence of what \\"tests\\" will be done to get the strongest out of the \\"wannabees\\" changes, so it comes as quite a surprise each year. Due to lack of sleep, hunger and extreme physical tasks many of the men give up. After all the above tests, the few remaining soldiers head back to camp where they have to complete an obstacle course called the \\"Elephant\\". Some foreign Elite soldiers claimed this to be one of the hardest bone breaking obstacle courses ever. Again, this is a timed exercise, which has to be completed several times, it is also done with full battle kit. Again the instructors are looking for any hesitant students during the high obstacles and underwater swim through a narrow tunnel. At the end of the \\"Elephant\\" several more students drop out due to injury or not completing the course in the required time. At this point the course has been completed. However, there is always the 'bad surprise\\" which has historically become part of the Selection Phase. After a six-month ordeal, the selected few (about 40% of the original intake), make the 12 jumps required to obtain their wings. During this time, the chances of being disqualified are still very high. This phase is followed by some advanced individual training, during which such subjects as advanced driving, demolitions, tactics and patrolling, unarmed combat, survival skills, escape and evasion, aspects of guerrilla warfare, tracking, raiding, counter- insurgency operations, fast rope skills, ambush and anti-ambush techniques and foreign weapons and techniques are covered. Their instructors, however, always find that something is left to be desired with the inspection which invariably follows. To harden their muscles, trainees are made to carry a telegraph pole for two days, at a rate of daily. Back at base, the 'marble', a stone weighing about which the soldier must carry wherever he goes, is used as a substitute for the same purpose.

He is a visual artist. His main focus is more in the ideology of painting itself rather than in expanding the field of painting. He represents the younger generation of artists, who problematise the field of painting through the use of media image and a free relationship with various technological processes. He deconstructs the social role of painting and the position of the viewer. The theme of his paintings is often media, especially film, which continues to shape his perception most today. In 2003, at the Venice Biennale he hung his paintings in the homes of temporary owners and the paintings had built-in cameras that transmitted images to the gallery in real time.

After persecution of Eastern Orthodox believers started, he left the city and made a home at the seashore. Once, when he was standing on a stone and praying, a storm started, lifted the stone and in two days moved it along the sea to the city of Novgorod. Anthony, who did not speak Russian, was informed by a Greek merchant that he was in Novgorod, met with Saint Nikita, the bishop of Novgorod, and obtained a permission to found the monastery at the site his stone arrived to the shore. It has been reported that the monastery church was consecrated by Anthony not in 1119, but that he was made hegumen only in 1131/32, immediately after Niphont was installed as the Bishop of Novgorod. This long delay is unclear; presumably it was related to some frictions between Novgorod church hierarchs. Anthony died in 1147 and was buried in the monastery.
