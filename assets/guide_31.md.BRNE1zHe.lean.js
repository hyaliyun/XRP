A special case of the Sitnikov problem was first discovered by the American scientist William Duncan MacMillan in 1911, but the problem as it currently stands wasn't discovered until 1961 by Sitnikov.  Definition  The system consists of two primary bodies with the same mass left(m_1 = m_2 = tfrac{m}{2}right), which move in circular or elliptical Kepler orbits around their center of mass. The third body, which is substantially smaller than the primary bodies and whose mass can be set to zero (m_3 = 0), moves under the influence of the primary bodies in a plane that is perpendicular to the orbital plane of the primary bodies (see Figure 1). The origin of the system is at the focus of the primary bodies. A combined mass of the primary bodies m = 1, an orbital period of the bodies 2pi, and a radius of the orbit of the bodies a = 1 are used for this system. In addition, the gravitational constant is 1. In such a system that the third body only moves in one dimension ‚Äì it moves only along the z-axis.  Equation of motion  In order to derive the equation of motion in the case of circular orbits for the primary bodies, use that the total energy ,E is: :E=frac{1}{2}left(frac{dz}{dt}right)^2 - frac{1}{r} After differentiating with respect to time, the equation becomes: :frac{d^2z}{dt^2}=-frac{z}{r^3} This, according to Figure 1, is also true: :r^2 = a^2 + z^2 = 1 + z^2 Thus, the equation of motion is as follows: :frac{d^2z}{dt^2} = -frac{z}{left(sqrt{1+z^2}right)^3} which describes an integrable system since it has one degree of freedom. If on the other hand the primary bodies move in elliptical orbits then the equations of motion are :frac{d^2z}{dt^2} = -frac{z}{left(sqrt{ rho(t)^2+z^2}right)^3} where rho(t) = rho(t+2 pi) is the distance of either primary from their common center of mass. Now the system has one-and-a-half degrees of freedom and is known to be chaotic.  Significance  Although it is nearly impossible in the real world to find or arrange three celestial bodies exactly as in the Sitnikov problem, the problem is still widely and intensively studied for decades: although it is a simple case of the more general three-body problem, all the characteristics of a chaotic system can nevertheless be found within the problem, making the Sitnikov problem ideal for general studies on effects in chaotic dynamical systems.

Ravenna founded by a group of businessmen and lovers inspired by Giuseppe Brusi, it landed in A1 at the end of the eighties, continuing a tradition that makes the city one of the \\"cradles\\" of Italian volleyball.

Robur, won five league titles at the turn of the forties and fifties, and Casadio, who was born on the initiative of the Fire Department, and he served in A1 and A2 from the sixties then. In 1987 Giuseppe Brusi and a consortium of local businessmen took over the Casadio and the right to participate in the Series A2 and changed its name to Porto Ravenna Volley. In the nineties, with the sponsorship of the Ferruzzi Group, the team took the name \\"il Messaggero\\" Volley, and won a league title, an Italian Cup (1991), three consecutive European Champion Cups (1992, 1993 and 1994), two European Super Cups and the Club World Championship. In the 1990‚Äì91 season (training Vullo, Timmons, Kiraly, Margaret, Gardini, Masciarelli) with coach Daniele Ricci the team won, with a high standard of play, the league and the Italian Cup. Among the players who dressed then the white-yellow-red jersey of the company includes those Brazilian Renan Dal Zotto and Giovane G√°vio, the great Russian Fomin, also the Italians Vigor Bovolenta and Andrea Sartoretti. Porto Ravenna Volley also boasts success in the field of youth. From 1990 to 2000 the club won four times the Junior League, three league titles Under-18, Under-16 two league titles, one Scudetto under 14 and a Boy League. The youth activities (which over the years Il Messaggero was coordinated by the Polish Olympic champion Alexander Skiba) led to the formation of the players who dressed the national team and that still tread the fields of Serie A. The Italian Under-16 title won on June 4, 2000 with victory in the final against Sisley Treviso, remains to this day the last championship of volleyball Ravenna. With the financial crisis of the industrial group Ferruzzi-Montedison and the death of the entrepreneur Raul Gardini in July 1993, the sports club gradually lost subsidies needed and went to meet a decline or loss; it continued its work (summarizing the name Porto Ravenna Volley), winning one more European title in 1997, the CEV Cup combined with several sponsors that allowed her to continue trading in Serie A until 2000. In that 'year, due to financial problems, the rights to participation in the championship of A1 were transferred to Trento. The activities of Porto Ravenna Volley continued at youth level, and in the 2009‚Äì2010 season, with the presidency of Vanni Monari came the return to a national championship: stravincendo the series C, was achieved promotion to Serie B2. The following season, immediately gets the promotion to Serie B1. In the 2012‚Äì13 season, after reaching the play-off promotion to Serie A2. At the end of the season now it merges with Gruppo Sportivo Robur Angelo Costa, going to create the Gruppo Sportivo Porto Robur Costa.

The first of these discussions resulted in a truce with Scotland in March. Indeed, this embassy also took the role of providing an escort back to Scotland for the newly married James I who had recently married the king's cousin Joan.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI, Berkeley 1981, pp. 156 The second resulted in a further- tenuous- extension to the truce, a not insignificant achieving in view, as one historian has put it, of the fact that Greystoke and his fellow negotiators ran the gauntlet \\"whilst on Scottish soil.\\"Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI, Berkeley 1981, pp. 158 Service to the crown was not however confined to the border; in 1430-1 he acted, at the behest of the royal council, as a royal commissioner to collect loans amounting to ¬£400 to assist in the prosecution of the French wars.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI, Berkeley 1981, pp. 119-20 He acted as an adjudicator in local gentry quarrels, alongside peers such as the earl of Northumberland.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI, Berkeley 1981, pp. 130 Wealth and regional influence In the Income Tax of 1436, he was assessed at an income of ¬£650 p.a,Gray, H.

Although traditionally the Greystoke family had been retained by the Percies, Earls of Northumberland, by the 1430s John had come within the sphere of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury.Harriss, G.L., Shaping the Nation: England 1360‚Äì1461, Oxford 2005, p. 535 He was known for his piety, bequeathing valuable items to his father's clerical college, including vestments, ornaments, \\"and lead to repair the choir.\\" Personal life Greystoke was married to Elizabeth Ferrers, though the date of their union is unknown. She was born in 1393, a daughter of Joan Beaufort, a cousin of the king, by her first marriage to Sir Robert Ferrers. They had a son, Ralph, who later succeeded to the barony.

Early life  Paul Gregory was the son of a butcher and graduated from Lincoln High School in Des Moines, Iowa in 1938.  Career  Gregory went to Hollywood where he worked as an assistant for clients like Horace Heidt and Carmen Cavallaro. He became friends with actor Charles Laughton and organized a successful lecture tour which Laughton made through the United States between 1949 and 1950. They earned $200,000 during this reading tour, the money worked as the basis for other projects. Gregory afterwards produced 17 Broadway plays during the 1950s and 1960s, among them The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial, The Marriage Go-Around and Lord Pengo. Gregory read the novel The Night of the Hunter by Davis Grubb and bought the film rights of Grubb's book. He then produced the thriller The Night of the Hunter (1955), directed by Laughton. While not a success in the 1950s, the film is today considered by many film critics as a masterpiece in whose making Gregory played an important role. His second and last movie as a producer was The Naked and the Dead (1958). As a television producer, he won an Emmy Award in 1955 for Best Television Adaptation for his television adaption of The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial. Gregory was also responsible for starting the acting career of his friend James Garner. He gave Garner his first acting role in his production of The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial.  Personal life  In 1964, Paul Gregory married former film star Janet Gaynor. Afterwards, he gradually retired from show business and raised cows, hogs, and pigeons at the large ranch of his wife. Paul Gregory and Gaynor were involved in a very serious car accident in 1982; two years later Gaynor died as a result of her injuries in this accident. In 1998, Gregory married art gallerist Kathryn Obergfel, who died three years later. Paul Gregory lived in his retirement in Desert Hot Springs, just north of Palm Springs, California. Gregory died in December 2015 at the age of 95 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. A friend stated that Gregory \\"died the way he wanted\\" and called his failing physical health and the death of most of his friends as probable reasons for the suicide. His death was only reported in November 2016.

The oldest of the stronghold's fortifications come from the fifteenth century. In 1443 Duke Wac≈Çaw I of Cieszyn sold the town and the castle to Krak√≥w's bishop Zbigniew Ole≈õnicki. The Bishops of Krak√≥w expanded the castle and its fortification walls. The castle began to crumble in the seventeenth century, and Swedish raids quickened its deteriorating. After The Deluge the castle was rebuilt by that didn't stop it from deteriorating and turn into a ruin. The last resident of the castle, Feliks Pawe≈Ç Turski, left the residence in 1800.

He has been noted as one of Belgium‚Äôs contemporary dance innovators and reformers. He left Mexico as a teenager to study theater and dance in Paris and Brussels, after dancing and doing choreography with several companies, Besprosvany began his own in 1986, which has had at least one production each year since its inception. In the late1990s, Besprosvany revamped his choreography to the current dominant style, which blends various arts and media, with themes focusing on the relationship of dance and narrative along with non-European cultures. His productions have toured various European countries and have performed in Mexico as well, twice at the Festival Internacional Cervantino. Life Besprosvany was born in Mexico, a second-generation Mexican whose Russian Jewish grandparents immigrated to country. In 1978, at age seventeen, he left Mexico to find better opportunities in the arts in Europe, first to France then Belgium to study theater and dance. He has lived in Belgium since. He first studied mime, movement, acting and mask play in Paris under Jacques Lecoq, at his school, then moved onto Brussels to study modern dance under Maurice Bejart at the Ecole Mudra. One of his main influences at Mudra was musician and teacher Fernand Schirren. Besprosvany continues to live in Brussels and speaks French, English, Spanish and Hebrew, with some Dutch and Italian. Career After finishing at the Mudra School, Besprosvany danced with Bejart's 20th Century Ballet for two years, from 1981 to 1983. He left to focus on a choreography career, and in this capacity has collaborated with the Mossoux-Bont√© Company, and those of Pierre Droulers, Mich√®le Noiret and Mich√®le-Anne de Mey. In 1986, he founded the Compagnie Jos√© Besprosvany, which since then has produced at least one production every year, and has toured in various European countries and Mexico. The first productions of this company include Momentum (1984), Evento (1986), and Temp√©raments (1988), along with Von Heute auf Morgen (1989), Apollon la Nuit (1990), and Retours (1992). In 1992 he created the choreographies for two operas for the Th√©√¢tre Royal de la Monnaie: Henry Purcell‚Äôs Dido and Aeneas and Pascal Dusapin‚Äôs Medeamaterial. More recent works include a retelling of the story of Oedipus, which premiered in Belgium in 2013, then toured Paris and Cyprus before becoming his second production at the Festival Internacional Cervantino in Mexico. The first was Cuarteto in 1995. Besprosvany has also worked in theater and film. He played the part of a dance professor in the movie Just Friends by Marc-Henri Wienberg as well as a number of roles in films by Marie Andr√©. As a director he has worked on projects such as Elles (1996) by Nicole Malinconi, Les Indiff√©rents by Odilon-Jean Perier (1996), L‚ÄôInvisible by Philippe Blasband and Prometheus Bound adapted by Henry Bauchau (1998), In 1992, he created a dance video called Andr√©s for television, which received recognition at the II Coreografo Electronica in Italy, at the Bert Leysen Prijs in Belgium and at the Danscreen in Germany. He directed a short film called Le Dession (2004) which premiered at the Molodist Festival in Kiev, winning a Prix du Meilleur for short film at the Salento Finibus Terrae Festival. The work La Princesse de Babylone (2004) received an award for best show and Oedipe (2013) received a nomination for best staging from the Francophone Community of Belgium. Apropos de Butterfly (2007) received the Audience Choice Award and the New Art Forms Award at the Rainbow Festival in Russia. Artistry Besprosvany began his career studying both theater and dance as he considers them complementary arts. His first productions such as Momentum (1984), Evento (1986), and Temp√©raments (1988) were minimalist. These were followed by productions that questioned the relationship between modern and classical languages, Von Heute auf Morgen (1989), Apollon la Nuit (1990), and Retours (1992). Besprosvany's work with his company focuses on two themes: exploring the relationship between narrative and dance and exploring non-European cultures. Early works of the former include Cuarteto (1993), Hombre Alado (1995) and Lara (1996), with Cuarteto, based on a text by Marguerite Duras, performed by two dancers, a cellist and an actress. In 1997 he directed L‚Äôinvisible, a story about an uprooted foreigner. Other works in this vein include Belle √† mourir (1999) based on the life of Mam√© Alan. The works Triptico (2002) and 9 (2005) . The 2013 production Oedipe shows influence from Asian shadow puppetry. In the late 1990s, Besprosvany decided that his choreography was still to conventional, and began the development of the style that dominates today. One element of this work is the blending of various artistic elements, starting with Dos y Dos (1999), which combined contemporary dance with live flamenco music. More recent works have incorporated puppetry such as La Princesse de Babylone (2003) along with Butterfly(2004), La Belle au bois de Dandaka (2007) Prom√©th√©e enchain√© (2010) and R√©citations (2009). The 2013 production of Oedipus, a version adapted by Olivier Kemeid, includes speech, music, video and choreographed movement. He uses multimedia in his production to create a concept called ‚Äútotal spectacle,‚Äù stating that he has become bored with only one means of expression, and has an interest in exploring how the various arts can work together. However, he states that this is not easy in Europe where the arts are strongly separated. Besprosvany's work shows an interest in updated version of classical texts, stating that their themes remain relevant today. He has done several versions of the story of Prometheus, and Oediper includes references to current social issues.

Olowu works in bronze, a traditional material for her people (see Benin Bronzes), and is known as the first female bronze caster in Nigeria. Her sculptures have a traditional flow as well as a freshening modern and feminist perspective. She is the aunt of DJ P Tee Money (born Thompson Iyamu), and her daughter is the artist Peju Layiwola. Early life and education As a child, Olowu worked alongside her mother, learning to sculpt items related to palace life and ritualistic needs. Her father encouraged her education and interest in sculpting despite local superstitions discouraging women from entering bronze foundries. Olowu attended Holy Child College, where she developed a love for reading. She continued her education at the Federal Emergency Science School where she majored in botany, chemistry, and zoology, which she later taught at the Anglican girls' grammar school. At age 18 she married her high school friend, Babatunde Olowu, and had her first child in 1964. In 1966 she continued her education by enrolling in the University of Nigeria, however she was persuaded to leave the school after finishing her first year. She continued teaching once home and regularly organized art shows for her female students, which eventually attracted the attention of the director of University of Benin‚Äôs Creative Arts department, who invited her to join the Fine Arts program. In 1979 she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts, and by the year 1981 she had begun to work on her post-graduate study, which included her thesis on ‚ÄúAn Investigation into Benin Cire Perdue Casting Technique.\\" This accomplishment made her the university's first female recipient of a Master of Fine Arts and the first Nigerian woman to cast bronze.In 1985 she received the Bendel State Award for Art and Culture and was later recognized by the Young Women‚Äôs Catholic Association for her contribution to uplifting the status of women in her country. She now continues to work at the Benin University where she takes care of her own bronze foundry. Career As a female artist, Elizabeth Olowu's main desire is to \\"liberate womenfolk from the shackles of men, deprivation and taboos\\".In 1979 she sculpted an autobiographical sculpture of a young girl sitting at a desk while engrossed in a book. This sculpture was one of the first from her culture that depicted an individual female figure. The year 1983 was also an important year of her life. She explored, in depth, the themes of power from an emotionally diverse perspective. Some distinguished sculptures from this year include The Oba and Christ Bearing the Sins of Humanity. The Oba depicts her father, who was instrumental in facilitating her career and her education. The statue is made personal by bearing her handprint as a robe design. Christ Bearing the Sins of Humanity is over seven feet tall and shows a geometric Christ figure hunched underneath the weight of the cross.

By his marriage to Elizabeth, daughter of William, Lord FitzHugh he formalized the long-standing alliance that had existed between the two families for some time. Biography Ralph was the eldest son of John de Greystoke, 4th Baron Greystoke by his second wife, Elizabeth Ferrers, daughter of Robert Ferrers, 3rd Baron Ferrers of Wem. At age 22, he succeeded his father in the barony after the latter's death in 1436. A resident of Greystoke Castle in Cumberland, he was frequently called upon to the king's service in matters concerning the English-Scotland border. He was summoned to parliament in 1436, 1439, 1441, and 1485. In 1444, Greystoke escorted the king's new bride, Margaret d'Anjou back to England, as part of the duke of Suffolk's embassy. Wars of the Roses In July 1447, Greystoke sealed an indenture with Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury promising to ride with the earl \\"in time of peace and of war.\\" When the Earl of Salisbury allied with Richard of York against the duke of Somerset's regime in February 1454, as a royal councilor Greystoke aided Richard, Duke of York to gain permission to open parliament, and become Protector. He again supported Salisbury that summer, being part of a commission of Oyer and Terminer which investigated Percy adherents from the previous year's feud between the Percies and the Nevilles. Later that year he was instructed by the Yorkist government to raise troops in Yorkshire to assist in crushing disorder that had broken out in neighbouring Lancashire. However, in a political reversal not uncommon for the period, after the rout of Salisbury and York at Ludlow in October 1459, and their self-imposed exiles in Calais and Ireland respectively, he apparently swore an oath of fealty to the Lancastrians at the Parliament of Devils which in October attainted the Yorkists. He may have fought for the king at the Battle of Wakefield the next year, which resulted in the deaths of York and Salisbury, and also on the victorious Lancastrian side at the Second Battle of St Albans in early 1461. However, it has been suggested that as he was probably absent from the decisive Battle of Towton two months later, which led to the accession of York's eldest son as King Edward IV of England, this possibly demonstrates that his loyalties to the Nevilles had never diminished, and that in spite of Wakefield and St Albans, \\"he had been playing a double game\\" since Ludford. Marriage and issue Effigy of Elizabeth Talbot (n√©e Greystoke, died 1490) in St John the Baptist Church, Bromsgrove. He married Elizabeth FitzHugh, daughter of the fourth Baron FitzHugh. They had several children, including: # Elizabeth (died 1490) who married firstly Thomas Scrope, 5th Baron Scrope of Masham, and secondly, Sir Gilbert Talbot of Grafton, KG (died 1517/18). Her second husband was the lord of the manor of Grafton Manor in Worcestershire. # Sir Robert Greystoke (-1483), who married Elizabeth Grey, daughter of Edmund Grey, 1st Earl of Kent. Sir Robert had one daughter, also named Elizabeth, who succeeded her grandfather in the barony as Elizabeth, 6th Baroness Greystoke. She in turn married Thomas Dacre, 2nd Baron Dacre, transferring the Greystoke titles and lands into the Dacre family. # Margaret (or Margery), married Sir Thomas Grey of Chllingham (d. 16 August 1498). Their daughter Anne married three times: (1) Sir John Delaval of Seaton-Delaval, Sheriff of Northumberland (d. 4 February 1498); (2) Thos. Hopton; and (3) Phillip Dacre.

The district extends along Mena Street between Port Arthur and Gillham Avenues, extending a short way to the south on Sherwood Avenue, opposite the railroad tracks for which the town's existence is responsible. Mena was founded as a major railroad service town for the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad, as its site was located midway between Port Arthur, Texas and Kansas City, Missouri. The railroad located a major service yard here, and the town grew up around it. Most of its commercial center was developed between 1896 and 1940, with a variety of one and two-story commercial brick buildings in typical early 20th-century styles. The district, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009, includes four properties previously listed separately: the railroad station, Mena City Hall (a repurposed 1917 post office building), the former Elks Lodge, and the former Studebaker Showroom.

She was the niece of eminent landscape painter John Ford Paterson. Paterson grew up around artists, actors, and other creatives, and lived next door to Annie and Frederick McCubbin. She began her education at Oberwly School, St. Kilda. At age thirteen, Paterson studied painting at the National Gallery of Victoria School from 1907 to 1912. Career Silk and lace, 1926, William Beckwith McInnes Paterson was publishing her illustrations while still at school with work featured in The Woman in 1908 and cartoons appearing in the Sydney Bulletin throughout 1912. This led to regular appearances in Melbourne Punch, the Argus, and other papers and journals. Her work saw her labelled by the Sun as \\"Melbourne's Poster Girl.\\" Her first book of sketches \\"Aussie Girls\\" was published in 1918 by Melbourne Publishing Company. It conveyed her ability to analyse the customs and values inherent in Melbourne society at the time. This was followed by her second book \\"'Me': a page from my diary\\" in 1919. Her talent in both illustration and poignant writings led to collaboration with writers Ethel Turner and Mary Grant Bruce, and acknowledgement from editors and publishers. Paterson had bylines as a freelance journalist with pictorial essays in publications such as Table Talk, Home, and the Weekly Times. Paterson nurtured the artistic talent of her younger sister Betty, who had trained as a musician at the Marshall Hall Conservatorium. Betty's drawings of babies and young children led to her also becoming a cartoonist for Punch, and the sisters even exhibited their works together. An exhibition of pictures by Esther and Betty was opened in 1922 at the Queen's Hall by then Prime Minister of Australia Billy Hughes. While the pictures were described as a \\"sometimes frivolous quality of humour\\", Esther was commended for her portraits of \\"Inez\\" and \\"The Purser.\\" They were also active in helping charities during the Second World War, selling their pencil sketches at a fete in aid of Women Artists' National Service, held at Ola Cohn's East Melbourne studio. Her work as a published illustrator was to become more prolific upon her marriage to George Hermon Gill.

Organizing action of prenatally administered testosterone propionate on the tissues mediating mating behavior in the female guinea pig. Endocrinology. 1959;65:369‚Äì382. It was found that when female controls, gonadectomized (removal of gonads) females, hermaphrodites, and castrated males were injected prenatally with testosterone propionate, the mean number of mounts increased. This increase in male-typical reproductive behavior shows that prenatal androgens have a masculinizing effect. Moreover, the organizing effects of hormones can have permanent effects. Phoenix et al. found that females injected with testosterone propionate while pregnant, instead of neonatally, did not have any effect on lordosis. This demonstrates that when testosterone is given postnatally in females, there may not be lasting effects as compared to prenatally administered testosterone. The data from this study supports the organizational hypothesis that states when androgens are given prenatally there is an organizing effect on sexual behavior, permanently altering normal female mating behavior as adults. Phoenix CH, Goy RW, Gerall AA, Young WC. Organizing action of prenatally administered testosterone propionate on the tissues mediating mating behavior in the female guinea pig. Endocrinology. 1959;65:369‚Äì382.  Mechanisms in sexual differentiation  Sexual behavior in rats is organized prenatally and activated with steroids hormones in adulthood. Nelson, R. An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology (4th ed.). Sunderland, Mass.: Sinauer Associates. 1995. Print. In males high levels of testosterone produced by testes and travel to the brain. Here, testosterone is aromatized to an estradiol and masculinizes and defeminizes the brain. Thus, estradiol is responsible for many male-typical behavior. In females, the ovaries produce large amounts of estrogen during gestation. Rats have alpha- fetoprotein that binds to the estrogen before it can reach the brain. The estrogen is eventually metabolized in the liver. This protein has a low affinity for androgens. Therefore, testosterone can reach the brain without being taken up by alpha-fetoprotein. Due to fact that males have different levels of androgens in the brain, this can lead to organizing effects from androgen exposure with the expression of masculine behaviour.  Main points of organizational-activational theory  The organizational-activational theory has three main components.Arnold A. (1985) ‚ÄúOrganizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.‚Äù Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015 #Organizational effects are permanent.Arnold A. (1985) ‚ÄúOrganizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.‚Äù Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015 A study by Gomes et al. showed that organizational effects can last a lifetime. Newborn female mice were exposed to either endured one minute of the neonatal handling stress procedure for the first ten days postpartum or were not handled at all. As adults, sexual receptiveness was recorded and handled female mice showed less lordosis than non-handled female mice and had less serum progesterone. Gomes C. (2012). ‚ÄúNeonatal handling induces alteration in progesterone secretion after sexual behavior but not in angiotensin II receptor density in the medial amygdala: implications for reproductive success.‚Äù Life Sciences. 2867-2871. Web. 24 Mar. 2015. Neonatal handling not only affected reproductive behavior, but also affected sympathetic nerve activity and glucocorticoid levels into adulthood, indicating that emotional stress during developmentally sensitive periods can permanently change behavior. Nugent BM. (2012). ‚ÄúHormonal Programming Across the Lifespan.‚Äù Hormone and Metabolic Research. 577‚Äì586. Web. 24 Mar. 2015. #Organizational effects occur just prior to or after birth, but before neural tissues have matured. Arnold A. (1985) ‚ÄúOrganizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.‚Äù Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015 Gorski et al. demonstrated the importance of the timing of hormonal influence in a study involving rats and the size of their medial preoptic nucleus (MPON). MPON size is a sexually dimorphic trait in that the MPON of male rats is larger than the MPON of female rats. But when male rats were castrated neonatally, their MPON was significantly smaller than male rats that were castrated after their brains were sexually differentiated. Despite both groups of males being castrated, the timing of the castration affected MPON size, indicating that organizational effects occur prior to maturation of neural tissues. Gorski R. (1978). ‚ÄúEvidence for a morphological sex difference within the medial preoptic area of the rat brain.‚Äù Brain Research. 333‚Äì346. Web. 24 Mar. 2015. #Organizational effects take place during a critical period.Arnold A. (1985) ‚ÄúOrganizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.‚Äù Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015 Results from studies indicate that organizational effects are maximized during sensitive periods of brain development. One critical period is weeks 8-24 of gestation. Another sensitive period shortly after birth may exist with a peak in testosterone in male infants during postnatal months 1-5. Arnold A. (1985) ‚ÄúOrganizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.‚Äù Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015 Auyeung et al. tested for an association between fetal and postnatal testosterone and autism in children. The results supported the idea that there is a critical period during which organizational effects occur. Fetal testosterone levels (taken from amniotic fluid during second trimester amniocentesis) and postnatal testosterone levels (from 18- to 24-month-olds' saliva) were compared with the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT), a measure of autistic traits in children. The authors found that only fetal testosterone was positively associated with Q-CHAT scores, signifying that fetal testosterone exposure during the critical period for sexual differentiation of the brain is associated with the development of autistic traits whereas postnatal androgens are not. Auyeung B. (2012). ‚ÄúPrenatal versus postnatal sex steroid hormone effects on autistic traits in children at 18 to 24 months of age.‚Äù Molecular Autism.17. Web. 25 Mar. 2015.  Criticism  There is evidence that organizational effects are not always permanent. In canaries, only the males produce song. Brain regions associated with bird song, including the hyperstriatum ventrale pars caudale (HVc) and nucleus robustus archistriatalis (RA), are larger in male canaries. However, the HVc and RA grow significantly larger in gonadectomized female canaries if given testosterone at 11 months of age and these females even begin to sing. These two brain regions change morphologically due to testosterone, indicating that neural tissue can be changed due to steroid hormones despite being organized to react to sex hormones in a female- or male-specific way. Nottebohm F. (1980). ‚ÄúTestosterone triggers growth of brain vocal control nuclei in adult female canaries.‚Äù Brain Res.429-436. Web. 24 Mar. 2015. Evidence   Facts of 2D:4D ratio  Finger ratio has been examined in relation to a number of physical traits that show sex differences and evidence suggests it is influenced by the prenatal environment, although there is no direct evidence for the latter. Arnold A. (1985) ‚ÄúOrganizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.‚Äù Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015 Studies in men have been motivated by two conflicting hypotheses. On the one hand, homosexual men were hypothesized to be exposed to high levels of testosterone in utero, which would be associated with a lower 2D:4D ratio than that found in heterosexual men. On the other hand, homosexual men have been hypothesized to have low prenatal testosterone exposure, and data from two studies are consistent with that hypothesis, showing homosexual men to have a higher finger ratio (on both hands) than heterosexual men. Arnold A. (1985) ‚ÄúOrganizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.‚Äù Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015  Ovulation and gonadal secretion  The hormonal control of ovulation is also related to the organizational/activational hypothesis. Nelson, R. An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology (4th ed.). Sunderland, Mass.: Sinauer Associates. 1995. Print. Both males and females rats exhibit luteinizing hormone (LH) pulses in which LH is released from the anterior pituitary due to the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. Females, however, show an increase in LH pulse frequency around ovulation due to the positive feedback mechanism. When estrogen is increased in the blood, the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) of the hypothalamus causes the release of GnRH. The GnRH surge brings about a surge in LH and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Since females have a cyclic gonadal function, there may be a sexual dimorphism in the gonadal secretion. When female rats are injected with testosterone there is no positive feedback occurring and no LH surge. Moreover, castrated males will exhibit LH surges, similar to female cyclic gonadal behavior.

His father, Mikhail Yefimovich Lobashev, was a professor of physiology and genetics and head of the Department of Genetics at Leningrad State University. Vladimir Lobashev graduated high school in 1952 with a silver medal. He earned a degree in physics at Leningrad State University in 1957. He defended his graduate thesis in 1963, and his doctoral thesis on the non-conservation of spatial parity in the gamma decay of nuclei in 1968. Career From 1957 to 1971, Lobashev worked as a laboratory assistant and as head of the Ioffe Physical-Technical Institute in Leningrad, collaborating also with the Leningrad Institute of Nuclear Physics. In 1972, Lobashev became head of the Department of Experimental Physics at the Institute for Nuclear Research in Moscow. In 1970, he was elected a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (later the Russian Academy of Sciences). He was awarded full membership in 2003. Research Lobashev's main areas of research were in P and CP invariance, and neutron and neutrino physics. He discovered a new effect in quantum electrodynamics, the rotation of the plane of polarization of gamma rays in the medium of polarized electrons. His work on small effects of the non-conservation of spatial parity contributed to proving the universality of the weak interaction, and earned Lobashev the Lenin Prize in 1974. Lobashev found the most accurate limit then known on the electric dipole moment of the neutron, critical to the interpretation of CP violation. In experiments with polarized thermal neutrons, Lobashev demonstrated left-right asymmetry of fission neutron capture. With P.E. Spivakom, Lobashev proposed a new method for measuring the mass of the neutrino; this experiment placed a new lower limit on the mass of the electron antineutrino. Lobashev, along with physicist Rashid Djilkibaev, proposed the MELC experiment to search for lepton flavor violation, which influenced the later Mu2e experiment at Fermilab in the US. Lobashev was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour in 1984, the Bruno Pontecorvo Prize in 1998, the Markov prize in 2004, and the Alexander von Humboldt Senior Researcher Award.

The publisher specializes on books about art and cultural history, architecture and historic preservation.  History  Deutscher Kunstverlag was founded in 1921 in Berlin. Founders were the publishing companies Insel Verlag, E. A. Seemann, Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt, Julius Hoffmann, G. Grote, Julius Bard, and Walter de Gruyter, as well as the bank . Some book series appeared already in 1925, which to this day still partially determine the publishing profile. In addition to scientific publications, DKV publishes art books and exhibition catalogs. After the Second World War, the publisher moved its headquarters to Munich. Since the 1990s, the owners have frequently changed. In early 2007, Gabriele Miller purchased DKV and was the sole shareholder. The head office of the publishing house was then moved back to Berlin. In October 2010, the daughter of the main shareholder, Stephanie Ecker, took over the commercial management of the publishing house. In January 2011, she and Gabriela Wachter, owner of Parthas publishing, became managing co-partners of the Deutsche Kunstverlag.  Profile  An important series published by the DKV is Das Handbuch der Deutschen Kunstdenkm√§ler (Handbook of German Art Monuments) from Georg Dehio. This book series has been published by the publishing house since 1929 and is constantly updated. In the art guide series DKV-Kunstf√ºhrer (formerly Gro√üe Baudenkm√§ler) individual publications are published in brochure form, mainly as a source of information onsite of the monuments. Also museum guides and art post cards for museums, collections, and art monuments are included in the publisher's program. The series Antiquit√§ten-F√ºhrer, and the successful title Kunst & Krempel (Art & Stuff), 3 volumes for the Bayerischer Rundfunk Television broadcast with the same name, served as a reference for collectors and fans.

Life Mostly referred to as \\"Tom Cooke\\", he was born in Dublin, the son of Bartlett Cooke, an oboist in the theatres of Smock Alley and Crow Street, and co-founder of the Irish Musical Fund (1787), also the owner of a music shop at 45 Dame Street and a music publisher. Thomas S. Cooke studied both with his father and with Tommaso Giordani, and displayed an early musical talent ‚Äì his first benefit concert took place at age nine on 14 February 1792 at the Exhibition Room, William Street, Dublin, when he performed on the violin and sang.Ita Beausang: \\"Cooke family\\", in: The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland, ed. Harry White and Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), p. 237‚Äì240; . In 1797, he became leader of the orchestra of Crow Street Theatre and became its music director not long afterwards. At another benefit concert in 1804, he performed a \\"concertante\\" on eight instruments, the flute, violin, viola, cello, piano, clarinet, harp, and trumpet, a feat he often repeated with various instruments.Beausang (2013), as above. In 1805 he married the actress and singer Fanny Howells; their eldest son was Henry Angelo Michael Cooke (1808‚Äì1889), later a well-known musician in London. The Cooke family became friendly with the celebrated soprano Angelica Catalani, after Cooke had led the orchestra at her first Dublin visit in 1807. In 1813, Cooke changed from the orchestra pit to the stage when he first appeared in a tenor role as Saraskier in Stephen Storace's opera The Siege of Belgrade (a role originally created by Cooke's compatriot Michael Kelly in 1791). Later in the same year he performed the role at the English Opera House in London, where he decided to stay for the remainder of his life. On 15 September 1815, Cooke performed for the first time at the Drury Lane Theatre (as Don Carlos in Thomas Linley's The Duenna) and remained its leading tenor for the next 20 years. He had a particular talent for seafaring characters, which gave rise to the phrase \\"in the style √† la Tom Cooke\\".Beausang (2013), as above. He was also involved in productions at Lyceum and Haymarket theatres and at Covent Garden. Cooke was music director of the Vauxhall Gardens concerts (1828‚Äì30) and the principal tenor at the chapel of the Bavarian embassy in Warwick Street until 1838. Having published a singing tutor in 1828, he also became a much-demanded singing teacher, numbering among his pupils later celebrities including Elizabeth Rainforth, John Sims Reeves, John Templeton, Margaretta Graddon, Maria Tree, and others. Cooke died at his home in Great Portland Street in 1848 and was buried at Kensal Green. Music Cooke was a prolific composer from early adolescence. In Dublin he had composed a number of orchestral overtures to theatrical performances and many songs. An early success was the comic opera The First Attempt, or The Whim of the Moment to a libretto by Sydney Owenson (Lady Morgan). In this work and in the later Thierna-na-Oge, or The Prince of the Lakes (1829), Cooke clearly referred to Celtic-Irish legends.Axel Klein: \\"Stage-Irish, or the National in Irish Opera, 1780‚Äì1925\\", in: Opera Quarterly 21.1 (2005), p. 39. On the whole, Cooke was not known to be particularly original; he mostly collaborated with others in his compositions, including Henry Bishop, C.E. Horn and David Braham. As such he is associated with over 50 productions at Drury Lane. He also adapted (\\"Cooke'd\\") works by Auber, Boieldieu, Hal√©vy, H√©rold, and Rossini in a manner he thought more fit for the British stage.

He has published extensively on global poverty, inequality and economic development including ten books. His research is at the interface of development studies and development economics, with a particular focus on middle-income developing countries and the analysis of poverty and inequality within the processes of economic development and structural transformation. His research has been cited by non-governmental organisations (NGOs), by international development agencies such as the World Bank and UN agencies, and by media including The Economist. He has also been asked to contribute expertise to various policy- related processes such as the Select Committees of the House of Commons, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and a Lancet Poverty Commission, and he has been listed in US magazine Foreign Policy‚Äôs ‚ÄòTop 100 Global Thinkers‚Äô, and in the Huffington Post‚Äôs ‚ÄòMost Influential Voices‚Äô. Sumner is a Professor in International Development in the Department of International Development, King's College London which he set up with Peter Kingstone. He holds associate positions at the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative, University of Oxford, the Center for Global Development in Washington, D.C, UNU-WIDER and Padjadjaran University, Indonesia. Sumner is director of the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Global Challenges Strategic Research Network on Global Poverty and Inequality Dynamics and a member of the ESRC Peer Review College. He was co-director of the Department of International Development, King's College London from 2012 to 2016. Prior to King's he was a research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex. From 1998 to 2014 Sumner served as council member of the Development Studies Association (DSA) and from 2008 to 2014 he was UK representative and vice president of the European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI). Sumner is deputy editor and an editorial board member of the journal Global Policy. He is also a board member of the Journal of International Development, and of the European Journal of Development Research and book series co-editor for Palgrave Macmillan‚Äôs 'Rethinking International Development'. Work Sumner's contemporary research focuses on: # global poverty and inequality; # inclusive growth and structural change in Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand); # the relationship between poverty, inequality and economic development. A central theme of his work is the persistence of poverty in middle-income countries and the implications of national inequality for poverty and theories of poverty. His research seeks to reconnect the analysis of poverty and inequality with the study of economic development and structural transformation. Sumner‚Äôs research has had an impact on the understandings of, and approaches to global poverty and inequality in terms of their understandings of where much of the world's poverty is located, theories of the cause of poverty, and the growing importance of national inequality in understanding absolute poverty. His is particularly known for his research that focused on the fact that about a billion people or three-quarters of the poor live in middle-income countries which he termed the ‚Äúnew bottom billion‚Äù. This finding raised questions about the distributional patterns of economic growth, the divorce of much foreign aid from world poverty and about the dominant country analytical categories. It has contributed to a changed understanding of global poverty. His work argues that absolute poverty is a distributional outcome of specific patterns of economic development and welfare regimes. Together with Alex Cobham he proposed a new measure of inequality linked more closely to poverty, the Palma ratio based on the work of Gabriel Palma. This new measure of inequality is now reported annually as a standard measure in the statistical databases of the OECD, the UNDP and the UK Office of National Statistics. His work has been discussed in media outlets such as The Economist, The Guardian, the Voice of America, BBC News and The Washington Post. Publications Selected books *Sumner, A.

Born on November 25, 1901 in St. Edward, Nebraska, he moved to Los Angeles in his mid-20s, and entered the film industry in 1929, first as a grip, and then as a stuntman and actor. He doubled for many famous actors, including Jimmy Stewart and Gary Cooper. His film and television career spanned forty years, during which time he appeared in hundreds of films and television shows, either as an actor, stuntman or body double. After his career in front of the camera ended in 1969, Mapes became an advocate for animal safety in films, working as an observer on sets for the American Humane Association. Early life Born John Tylor Mapes, he grew up on the farm and ranch owned by his father. At some point in his mid-20s, he moved to Los Angeles, where he worked for a moving company. When he was on a job moving John Barrymore's affects off the Samuel Goldwyn studio, he learned that studio grips were making twice his rate of pay. Shortly after he became a grip, working on film crews for the next five years. Film and television career While working as a grip on the 1935 Christy Cabanne film, One Frightened Night, he received his first bit role, that of a masked killer. His first official role came later that year, in the drama, The Silent Code. While he would be cast in almost 70 films over the next 25 years, most of those roles were in smaller roles. Mapes spent the rest of the 1930s acting in several film serials, including The Great Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok (for which he also did stunts), which is considered by some as the finest serial ever shot at Columbia Pictures; The Lone Ranger Rides Again, Dick Tracy's G-Men, Zorro's Fighting Legion, Son of Zorro, Adventures of Captain Marvel, and Adventures of Red Ryder. Mapes was up for the lead in Red Ryder, but the role eventually went to Don \\"Red\\" Barry. After being in numerous serials at Republic Pictures, he also found his way into feature films as well, the first of those being The Ranger and the Lady, starring Roy Rogers and Gabby Hayes. Other notable films in which Mapes performed include: Red River Valley, again starring Rogers and Hayes; My Pal Trigger, once more with Rogers and Hayes, but this time also starring Trigger and Dale Evans; the Bob Hope and Jane Russell comedy, The Paleface (1948); Cecil B. DeMille's epic, Samson and Delilah (1949); The Gunfighter (1950), starring Gregory Peck; Winchester '73, starring Jimmy Stewart, Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, and Stephen McNally; The Far Country, again with Stewart, this time also starring Ruth Roman, Corinne Calvet, and Walter Brennan; and once again in a Stewart film, the classic 1959 romantic comedy, Bell, Book and Candle, also starring Kim Novak. In addition to his acting, he also became involved as a body double, due to his stunt work. He doubled for many actors, including Charles Starrett, but was more well known for his stand-in work for Jimmy Stewart and Gary Cooper. He was Cooper's stand-in for 17 films (almost half) which Cooper shot between 1943 and Cooper's death in 1961. The first film was 1943's For Whom the Bell Tolls, and the last was The Naked Edge, a thriller released in 1961. Sometimes he would also have a small role in Cooper's film, as in 1948's Unconquered. During this time he also began doubling for Stewart. With the advent of television, Mapes would appear in dozens of shows, including Hopalong Cassidy, The Cisco Kid, Studio 57, Bat Masterson, Wagon Train, Gunsmoke, and The Virginian. His final performance would be in a small role in the musical, Hello, Dolly!, directed by Gene Kelly.

Its purpose was to work for the introduction of reformed laws in favor of women's equality with men. The association was founded with the goal to reform the marriage laws regarding the guardianship of men over their wife, and to make it possible for married women to handle their own economy. However, despite the name, they also worked for legal reform in other issues within women's rights. It is regarded as the first women's rights organisation in Sweden. History The association was co- founded by Anna Hierta-Retzius and Ellen Anckarsv√§rd in 1873, while it was formally headed by the male parliamentarian Gustaf Fridolf Amlquist. The association is regarded to have been foremost an association for women of the upper classes and male liberal intellectuals. Among their members were Amanda Kerfstedt and Ellen Key. The association worked to affect public opinion in order to introduce legal reform regarding gender equality. Its first purpose, which gave the association its name, was to give married women control over their own property. This was a controversial subject: married women were legally minors under the guardianship of their husbands, and thus had not control over their own property, unless there had been a prenuptial agreement. What the association actually wished to achieve was, therefore, to abolish the guardianship of a husband over his wife. In 1874, a legal reform introduced the right for a professional married woman to control the money she earned after marriage. In 1884, a new reform allowed married women control over their inheritance and property. The same year, a reform declared unmarried women of legal majority at the same age as men: 21. However, these victories were not complete, as the guardianship of husband's over their wives were kept. The association worked for many other issues regarding reform in women's rights except for their main issue. During the 1880s, they had a campaign to increase the participation of women voters in the elections: since 1862, women of legal majority (unmarried, divorced and widowed women) had the right to participate in municipal elections if they met the property qualifications, and the association encouraged them to use this right: in the 1887 municipal election, the female voters participation consisted of 10-15 percent. In 1896, the association was absorbed by the Fredrika-Bremer-F√∂rbundet and dissolved.

Several politically significant events took place in the castle during the Middle Ages. In 1648, the castle saw damage when it was besieged by soldiers loyal to the Holy Roman Empire , but it was renovated later during the same century (1663-65). Another renovation was carried out in 1705, when the clock tower was repaired. Later during the 18th century, Frederick the Great converted the castle into a prison, a role which it would keep until 1956. Until 1821, it also housed an asylum for mentally ill. After 1888, the hitherto all-male prison became an all-female prison, and stayed in this capacity until 1945. During World War II, it was used as such also by the German authorities who among others imprisoned several French women here. A memorial commemorating them has been erected in the castle courtyard.

The castle, together with a network of fortresses was used as a defense line between the Duchy of Jawor and the Kingdom of Bohemia. In the sixteenth century Grodno Castle was expanded by a gatehouse, on which there is precious sgraffito, and a sundial clock from 1716. The castle was devastated in battles against the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War, slowly falling into ruins. In the nineteenth century the tower had collapsed.

It consists of eight irregular stones of red granite arranged at approximately equal intervals to form a circle of diameter, enclosing the same number of small cairns. The cairns are characterised by outer kerbs or rings of stones, with a double ring surrounding the central cairn and a single ring in the others. All but one of the cairns have eleven ringstones, with the last having nine. The whole circle sits on a patch of gravel which forms the end of a low gravel ridge linking the site with Leuchar Moss. It is regarded as \\"a later development from the recumbent stone circle\\", Internet Archive. though its layout with kerbed cairns within the circle makes it unique. Diagram of the layout of Cullerlie stone circle (Logan, 1820) At the time that the circle was built in the second millennium BC, the surrounding landscape was characterised by wet bogs, and the stones were transported to the site from higher ground some distance away. The tallest of the stones marks the north side of the circle. They vary in height from to . A 2004 survey of the site discovered that several of the stones had been carved with previously unnoticed cup marks. Excavations carried out in 1934 by H. E. Kilbride-Jones on behalf of the Ministry of Works, showed that the circle was built in stages. The entire site had first been cleared, leveled and burned by setting fire to piles of willow twigs. Then came the outer stones, with their bases shaped into points to make them more stable in their gravel bed. They have been somewhat eroded over time by acidic peat eating away the lower portions of the stones. Oak and hazel were burned within the stone rings, leaving charcoal behind, and cremated human bones were deposited in the ashes within five of the rings. They were then filled with smaller stones to create the cairns visible today. The circle may once have had several companions. In 1820 James Logan wrote: \\"The small Circles contained in the larger present a curious singularity; and it is also remarkable that, at a short distance to the southwest, are nine others of similar dimensions.\\" However, when the site was excavated in 1934, no trace of these satellite circles could be found.

As her previous focus was primarily illustration, early issues of her work on Batgirl were sketched out by Cameron Stewart, and then passed over to Tarr to color, add details to, and enhance.http://womenwriteaboutcomics.com/2014/12/09/zooming-in-on-badass- ladies-interview-with-babs-tarr/ Since then, Tarr has illustrated and done the covers for other DC Comics series, such as Black Canary and Gotham Academy.http://www.dccomics.com/talent/babs-tarr She has also worked for Hasbro, Disney, Boom! Comics, The San Francisco Chronicle, The Boston Globe, and Brand X. Her manga-inspired style has become more popular after Batgirl's popularity in the comic book industry, and it has found its way into other comics that Tarr has worked on. Tarr's Sailor Moon Motorcycle Girls illustration (found on her personal page) became very popular and ultimately inspired Cameron Stewart and Brenden Fletcher to write two villains for Batgirl #36 based on Tarr's illustration. In 2016, Tarr stopped working on Batgirl and moved on to work on Image Comics' Motor Crush series where she worked as an artist and writer. In 2019, Tarr began co-hosting the weekly Internet show Pub Draw on the Critical Role Twitch and YouTube channels. Each week, Tarr would teach co-host Marisha Ray and occasionally a guest how to draw characters from Critical Role, on which Ray is a star.

The program was designed to be both modular, by its plugin strategy and efficient, by it multithreading strategy. It incorporates different transformations (Global, Elastic, Local), optimizing strategy (Gauss-Newton, Steepest descent), Global and/or local shape functions (Rigid- body motions, homogeneous dilatations, flexural and Brazilian test models)... Theoretical background Context In solid mechanics, digital image correlation is a tool that allows to identify the displacement field to register a reference image (called herein fixed image) to images during an experiment (mobile image). For example, it is possible to observe the face of a specimen with a painted speckle on it in order to determine its displacement fields during a tensile test. Before the appearance of such methods, researchers usually used strain gauges to measure the mechanical state of the material but strain gauges only measure the strain on a point and don't allow to understand material with an heterogeneous behavior. One can obtain a full in plane strain tensor by derivation of the displacement fields. Many methods are based upon the optical flow. In fluid mechanics a similar method is used, called Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV); the algorithms are similar to those of DIC but it is impossible to ensure that the optical flow is conserved so a vast majority of the software used the normalized cross correlation metric. In mechanics the displacement or velocity fields are the only concern, registering images is just a side effect. There is another process called image registration using the same algorithms (on monomodal images) but where the goal is to register images and thereby identifying the displacement field is just a side effect. YaDICs uses the general principle of image registration with a particular attention to the displacement fields basis. Image registration principle YaDICs can be explained using the classical image registration framework:S. Klein, M. Staring, K. Murphy, M. A. Viergever, and J. P. W. Pluim, \\"Elastix: a toolbox for intensity-based medical image registration,\\" Medical imaging, IEEE transactions on, vol. 29, issue 1, pp. 196‚Äì205, 2010 Image registration general scheme The common idea of image registration and digital image correlation is to find the transformation between a fixed image and a moving one for a given metric using an optimization scheme. While there are many methods to achieve such a goal, Yadics focuses on registering images with the same modality. The idea behind the creation of this software is to be able to process data that comes from a ¬µ-tomograph; i.e.: data cube over 1000¬≥ voxels. With such a size it is not possible to use naive approach usually used in a two-dimensional context. In order to get sufficient performances OpenMP parallelism is used and data are not globally stored in memory. As an extensive description of the different algorithms is given in. Sampling Contrary to image registration, Digital Image Correlation targets the transformation, one wants to extracted the most accurate transformation from the two images and not just match the images. Yadics uses the whole image as a sampling grid: it is thus a total sampling. Interpolator It is possible to choose between bilinear interpolation and bicubic interpolation for the grey level evaluation at non integer coordinates. The bi-cubic interpolation is the recommended one. Metrics =Sum of squared differences (SSD)= The SSD is also known as mean squared error. The equation below defines the SSD metric: SSD(mu,mathcal{I_F},mathcal{I_M})=dfrac{1}{left  Omega_F right } sum_{x_i in Omega_F} left( mathcal{I_F}(x_i) - mathcal{I_M}({T}_{mu}(x_i))right)^{2}, where mathcal{I_F} is the fixed image, mathcal{I_M} the moving one, Omega_F the integration area left  Omega_F right  the number of pi(vo)xels (cardinal) and {T}_{mu} the transformation parametrized by Œº The transformation can be written as: T_{mu}(x)=x + left {Phi(x)right }^{t} left {mu right }. This metric is the main one used in the YaDICs as it works well with same modality images. One has to find the minimum of this metric =Normalized cross- correlation= The normalized cross-correlation (NCC) is used when one cannot assure the optical flow conservation; it happens in case of change of lighting or if particles disappear from the scene can occur in particle images velocimetry (PIV). The NCC is defined by: NCC(mu,mathcal{I_F},mathcal{I_M})=dfrac{sum_{x_i in Omega_F} left( mathcal{I_F}(x_i) - overline{mathcal{I_F}}right) left( mathcal{I_M}({T}_{mu}(x_i)) - overline{mathcal{I_M}}right)}{sqrt{sum_{x_i in Omega_F} left( mathcal{I_F}(x_i) - overline{mathcal{I_F}}right)^{2}sum_{x_i in Omega_F} left(mathcal{I_M}({T}_{mu}(x_i))- overline{mathcal{I_M}}right)^{2}}}, where overline{mathcal{I_F}} and overline{mathcal{I_M}} are the mean values of the fixed and mobile images. This metric is only used to find local translation in Yadics. This metric with translation transform can be solved using cross-correlation methods, which are non iterative and can be accelerated using Fast Fourier Transform . Classification of transformations There are three categories of parametrization: elastic, global and local transformation. The elastic transformations respect the partition of unity, there are no holes created or surfaces counted several times. This is commonly used in Image Registration by the use of B-Spline functionsJ. R√©thor√©, T. Elguedj, P. Simon, and M. Correct, \\"On the use of nurbs functions for displacement derivatives measurement by digital image correlation,\\" Experimental mechanics, vol. 50, iss. 7, pp. 1099‚Äì1116, 2010. and in solid mechanics with finite element basis.G. Besnard, F. Hild, and S. Roux, \\"Finite-element displacement fields analysis from digital images: application to portevin-le ch√¢telier bands,\\" Experimental mechanics, vol. 46, iss. 6, pp. 789‚Äì803, 2006.J. R√©thor√©, S.

The global transformations are defined on the whole picture using rigid body or affine transformation (which is equivalent to homogeneous strain transformation). More complex transformations can be defined such as mechanically based one. These transformations have been used for stress intensity factor identification by R. Hamam, F. Hild, and S. Roux, \\"Stress intensity factor gauging by digital image correlation: application in cyclic fatigue,\\" Strain, vol. 43, iss. 3, pp. 181‚Äì192, 2007.F. Hild and S. Roux, \\"Measuring stress intensity factors with a camera: integrated digital image correlation (i-dic),\\" Comptes rendus m√©canique, vol. 334, iss. 1, pp. 8‚Äì12, 2006. and for rod strain by.F. Hild, S. Roux, N. Guerrero, M. Marante, and J. Fl√≥rez-Ll√≥pez, \\"Calibration of constitutive models of steel beams subject to local buckling by using digital image correlation,\\" European journal of mechanics - a/solids, vol. 30, iss. 1, pp. 1‚Äì10, 2011. The local transformation can be considered as the same global transformation defined on several Zone Of Interest (ZOI) of the fixed image. =Global= Several global transforms have been implemented: * Rigid and homogeneous (Tx,Ty,Rz in 2D; Tx,Ty,Tz,Rx,Ry,Rz,Exx,Eyy,Ezz,Eyz,Exz,Exy in 3D) * Brazilian F. Hild and S. Roux, \\"Digital image correlation: from displacement measurement to identification of elastic properties ? a review,\\" Strain, vol. 42, iss. 2, pp. 69‚Äì80, 2006. (Only in 2D), * Dynamic Flexion, =Elastic= First-order quadrangular finite elements Q4P1 are used in Yadics. Local Every global transform can be used on a local mesh. Optimization The YaDICs optimization process follows a gradient descent scheme. The first step is to compute the gradient of the metric regarding the transform parameters begin{array}{lcl}dfrac{partial SSD(mu,mathcal{I_F},mathcal{I_M})}{partial mu} &=&dfrac{2}{left  Omega_F right } sum_{x_i in Omega_F} left( mathcal{I_F}(x_i) - mathcal{I_M}({T}_{mu}(x_i))right)dfrac{partial mathcal{I_M}( {T}_{mu}(x_i)}{partial mu}  &=& dfrac{2}{left  Omega_F right } sum_{x_i in Omega_F} left( mathcal{I_F}(x_i) - mathcal{I_M}({T}_{mu}(x_i))right) left( dfrac{partial {T}_{mu}(x_i)}{partial mu} right )^{t} dfrac{partial mathcal{I_M}( {T}_{mu}(x_i))}{partial x} end{array} =Gradient method= Once the metric gradient has been computed, one has to find an optimization strategy The gradient method principle is explained below: mu_{k+1}=mu_k+alpha_k d_k The gradient step can be constant or updated at every iteration. d_k=-gamma_k dfrac{partial mathcal{C}(mu,mathcal{I_F},mathcal{I_M})}{partial mu}, gamma_k allows one to choose between the following methods : * gamma_k Longrightarrow steepest descent, * gamma_k=left [ dfrac{partial mathcal{C}(mu,mathcal{I_F},mathcal{I_M})}{partial mu}dfrac{partial mathcal{C}(mu,mathcal{I_F},mathcal{I_M})}{partial mu}^{t} right ]^{-1} Longrightarrow Gauss-Newton. Many different methods exist (e.g. BFGS, conjugate gradient, stochastic gradient) but as steepest gradient and Gauss- Newton are the only ones implemented in Yadics these methods are not discussed here. The Gauss-Newton method is a very efficient method that needs to solve a [M]{U}={F}. On 1000¬≥ voxels ¬µ-tomographic image the number of degrees of freedom can reach 1e6 (i.e: on a 12√ó12√ó12 mesh), dealing with such a problem is more a matter of numerical scientists and required specific development (using libraries like Petsc or MUMPS) so we don't use Gauss-Newton methods to solve such problems. One has developed a specific steepest gradient algorithm with a specific tuning of the Œ±k scalar parameter at each iteration. The Gauss-Newton method can be used in small problems in 2D. Pyramidal filter None of these optimization methods can succeed directly if applied at the last scale as the gradient methods are sensitive to the initial guests. In order to find a global optimum one has to evaluate the transformation on a filtered image. The figure below illustrates how to use the pyramidal filter to find the transformation.T. S. Yoo, M. J. Ackerman, W. E. Lorensen, W. Schroeder, V. Chalana, S. Aylward, Dimitris Metaxas, and R. Whitaker, \\"Engineering and algorithm design for an image processing api: a technical report on itk - the insight toolkit,\\" , pp. 586‚Äì592, 2002. Pyramidal process used in Yadics (and ITK). Regularization The metrics is often called image energy; people usually add energy that comes from mechanics assumptions as the Laplacian of displacement (a special case of Tikhonov regularization A. N. Tikhonov and V. B. Glasko, \\"Use of the regularization method in non-linear problems,\\" USSR computational mathematics and mathematical physics, vol. 5, iss. 3, pp. 93‚Äì107, 1965.) or even finite element problems. As one decided not to solve the Gauss-Newton problem for most of cases this solution is far from being CPU efficient. Cachier et al.P. Cachier, E. Bardinet, D. Dormont, X. Pennec, and N. Ayache, \\"Iconic feature based nonrigid registration: the PASHA algorithm,\\" Computer vision and image understanding, vol. 89, issue 2?3, pp. 272‚Äì298, 2003. demonstrated that the problem of minimizing image and mechanical energy can be reformulated in solving the energy image then applying a Gaussian filter at each iteration. We use this strategy in Yadics and we add the median filter as it is massively used in PIV. One notes that the median filter avoids local minima while preserving discontinuities.

A Republican Party member and former civil society activist, she was appointed as Georgia's Minister of Defense on 1 May 2015, becoming the country's first ever female defense minister. She resigned on 1 August 2016, after her party decided to leave the ruling Georgian Dream coalition. Khidasheli is married to David Usupashvili, the former chairman of the Parliament of Georgia.  Education and early career  Born in Tbilisi, Tina Khidasheli graduated from Tbilisi State University with a degree in international law in 1995. She became a Master of Political Science at the Central European University in Budapest in 1996. She was a human rights fellow at the Washington College of Law, and World fellow of Yale University. Having worked for several governmental and international organizations in Georgia, Khidasheli assumed presidency of the influential human rights group Georgian Young Lawyers' Association (GYLA) from 2000 to 2004. At the same time, she served as member of the State Anti-Corruption Council from 2002 to 2004. One of the vocal critics of the government of the-then President of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze, Khidasheli was energetically involved in protest movement which brought about Shevardnadze's resignation in the Rose Revolution in November 2003. She, however, distanced herself from the new government led by Mikheil Saakashvili, her ally in the political struggle against Shevardnadze.  Later career  After a brief tenure as a Chairperson of the Board of Open Society Georgia Foundation (Soros Foundation) from 2004 to 2005, Khidasheli joined the Republican Party of Georgia, led by her husband, David Usupashvili. She served as that party's secretary for international affairs from 2005 to 2009. She was elected to the Council of Tbilisi in 2010 and entered the Parliament of Georgia after the Georgian Dream coalition, of which the Republican Party was member, defeated Saakashvili-led United National Movement in the 2012 election. She chaired the parliamentary committee on European integration. In May 2015, Khidasheli succeeded Mindia Janelidze as Georgia's Defense Minister. During her tenure, Khidasheli sought close cooperation with NATO and the United States. She also announced an intention to the end of compulsory conscription as part of military reforms. After the Republican Party decided to leave the Georgian Dream coalition ahead of the scheduled October 2016 parliamentary election, Khidasheli filed resignation and was succeeded by the former security official Levan Izoria. Khidasheli herself criticized the government's choice of her successor.

Education  Thalhammer was born in Florissant, Missouri. She first studied art at St. Joseph's Academy while working as a waitress at her family's truck stop. She attended the Chicago Institute of Art at the age of 16, for an art program that focused on figure drawing and realized she wanted to pursue art professionally. She received, with honors, her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in painting with a double minor in Women's Studies and Art History from the University of Kansas and studied abroad at Staffordshire University in England. She moved to Washington D.C. in 2004.  Career  Thalhammer's work has been covered by publications including U.S. News & World Report, the Washington Post, and the Washington Blade. The Blade featured her on its cover in 2008 and nominated her for \\"best visual artist\\" in 2013. Thalhammer has been influenced and inspired by Artemisia Gentileschi. Thalhammer has exhibited her works at several galleries in Washington D.C. such as the Transformer Gallery and G-Fine Arts Gallery. In 2013 she had a solo show called Intimate Network at The Fridge Gallery in Washington, which included 13 pieces of portraiture and abstract work. In 2010, she collaborated with another Washington artist, Sheila Criter, to create a window mural at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center called Butterfly Speeches.  Art and activism  Lisa Marie Thalhammer uses her artworks as part of political actions to communicate positive messages of equality, persistence, empowerment and love.  LOVE  Thalhammer's LOVE design made its debut in the 2016 Capital Pride Parade as float banners. In January 2017 Thalhammer created posters with her LOVE artwork, advocating for an end to hate while protesting the United States presidential inauguration. She has since carried her LOVE poster art in many political protests in Washington D.C. including the People's Climate March, the Native Nations March, the March For Our Lives and the Capital Pride 2017 & 2018 Parades. In January 2018, Thalhammer's original 10 foot wide LOVE painting on paper was exhibited at Into Action, a social justice art festival in Downtown LA.  Strong Woman  As part of an organized effort of multiple artists from Washington and Los Angeles, Thalhammer used her artwork to participate in the 2017 inaugural Women's March on Washington. A racially diverse team of women carried Thalhammer's 24 foot diameter painting titled ‚ÄúStrong Woman: LOVE for All‚Äù which features a multiracial women flexing her arms wearing camouflaged pants in front of a rainbow colored background. The artwork was later displayed at the 2018 United State of Women Summit in Los Angeles, CA.Thalhammer's Boxer Girl mural, located at 73 W Street NW, Washington D.C.  Notable murals   Boxer Girl  \\"Boxer Girl\\", Thalhammer's first public mural, was installed over Memorial Day weekend in 2009 and is located at 1st and W Streets NW in Washington. It was inspired by the women in Thalhammer's life and her observations of women's interactions with male peers in her community, and also by her athletic experiences and appreciation for team sports. The mural sparked some controversy as members of the neighborhood had mixed reactions to it. In a neighborhood committee meeting, a police officer reported that after installation of the mural, crime in that area had decreased by 55 percent. The DC Commission of Arts and Humanities awarded Thalhammer a grant to create Boxer Girl. Thalhammer decided to paint Boxer Girl in her own neighborhood, Bloomingdale, on the side of the home of a long-time supporter and friend, Veronica Jackson.  LOVE mural  Thalhammer painted her \\"LOVE\\" mural in the Blagden Alley Shaw neighborhood of Washington D.C. in August 2017 on four steel gates. It has since become popular among Instagram users and photographers. The mural has appeared in Washingtonian Magazine, a Destination DC Date Night commercial, and the Netflix series \\"Stay Here.  Mural controversy  In 2016 Thalhammer collaborated with fellow artist Aja Adams on the design of a mural which Thalhammer completed in summer 2017; it is located in the alley next to 57 O Street NW in Washington, D.C. The project received a $50,000 grant from the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities. Adams was not paid the amount she expected for her contributions. In response to her complaint, the commission initially threatened to pull the grant, but later stated that it was simply a contractual disagreement.  Involvement in the LGBTQ community  In February 2017 the Washington Blade, covering the LGBT Community since 1969, listed Lisa Marie Thalhammer as one of the city's \\"Most Eligible Singles\\". The Blade also nominated her \\"best visual artist\\" in 2013. In August 2017 Thalhammer gave a eulogy at the memorial for Cassidy Karakorn, a 39-year-old executive with the LGBT civil rights advocacy group Human Rights Campaign who was killed in a traffic collision. Awards and honors Thalhammer was voted Best Artist by the Washington Blade Reader's Choice Awards 2018.

The castle is located in Otmuch√≥w (68 km south-west of Opole), Opole Voivodeship; in Poland. History Courtyard Arcades The history of the Castle in Otmuch√≥w dates back to the twelfth century, when Pope Hadrian gave authority to the land to the Bishop of Wroc≈Çaw, including the castle. Throughout the next centuries the castle gained its significance, when Bishop Preczlaw of Pogarell called Otmuch√≥w the capital of the Duchy of Bishops. The castle changed its architectural style to that of the Renaissance during reconstruction work in the seventeenth century. In 1810 the partially devastated south-eastern wing of the residence was deconstructed. Currently two wings of the castle survive, both having four levels. After the secularisation in 1810, the castle was left in ruins, while the lands were given off to the powerful House of Humboldt; the Duke of Humboldt used the material from the former, other two wings to repair the currently standing reconstructed wings. In the location of the former wings, the owner built a small castle-garden, while his brother Alexander von Humboldt sent in exotic trees, such as the smoketree, ginkgo, or the Canadian lime tree.

Prior to serving as the President of Morgan State University, Dr. Richardson served as Assistant to the President of the University System of Maryland, and Executive Assistant to the Chancellor, Director of Career Planning and Placement and Acting Director of Admissions and Registration at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. Early life and career Earl Stanford Richarson was born on September 25, 1943 in Westover, Maryland, an unincorporated community in Somerset County on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Maryland State College. Afterward, he earned a Master of Science degree and a Doctor of Education degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Richardon also served in the United States Air Force from 1965 to 1969. Dr. Richardson became a Fellow at the Ford Foundation and the W. K. Kellogg Foundation where he conducted extensive research on critical problems in higher education relevant to racial autonomy, desegregation and integration. He wrote several articles on the implications of proposals to merge historically Black institutions with white institutions and on inter-institutional cooperation in higher education. President of Morgan State University Dr. Richardson presided as President of Morgan State University from November 1, 1984 to June 6, 2010. During this period, the University went through a rebirth throughout the campus. This time period is considered to be a renaissance period and the third \\"Era of Progress\\" for the University. Dr. Richardson‚Äôs vision was to create an environment for students to receive the best education possible. A fundamental part of that vision was providing Morgan students a quality academic information resource center, strengthening academic programs, improving fiscal management, stabilizing student enrollment, and renovating the University‚Äôs buildings and infrastructure. During his presidency, the University added modern, state-of-the-art facilities resulting from over $200 million in capital improvements. Additionally, upgrades included the renovation and construction of classroom and research buildings, residence halls and other auxiliary buildings, totaling nearly $400 million. The expansion of the campus included three adjacent complexes (Montebello Complex, the Pentridge Apartments, and a portion of the Northwood Shopping Center) and a satellite Estuarine Research Center in Southern Maryland. The construction of a new fine arts center (the Carl J. Murphy Fine Arts Center) was also constructed on the southern portion of the campus. Moreover, the size of the student body increased by over 40% under his tenure. As the student body continued to grow, the academic achievements of the student body also increased (as measured by the high school GPA and SAT scores). Morgan also experienced growth in its academic programs, adding Bachelor's degree programs in civil, electrical and industrial engineering, hospitality management and finance. Also, adding Master's degrees and Doctorate degrees in engineering, history, Business and Public Health. During Dr. Richardson‚Äôs tenure, Morgan led Maryland colleges and universities in the overall production of African American baccalaureates, and in the number of undergraduates in mathematics, science and engineering. Thirty-six percent of the graduates pursued advance study compared to the State average of twenty-six percent. Post-President of Morgan State University Dr. Richardson keeps active in civic and community organizations. He serves as a member of LifeBridge Health, the National Institutes of Health, the American Council on Education‚Äôs Commission on International Education, President‚Äôs Board of Advisors on HBCUs.

Structure Gesundes Kinzigtal GmbH is run in cooperation with a network of physicians (Medizinischen Qualit√§tsNetz √Ñrzteinitiative Kinzigtal e.V) and the healthcare management company OptiMedis AG. This attempt to overcome the traditionally fragmented German health care system has attracted international attention because it appears to have improved the health of the population and reduced demands on healthcare, when in most of the developed world trends are in the other direction. \\" If the evaluation of Gesundes Kinzigtal Integrated Care provides sufficient evidence of a significant improvement in effectiveness and/or efficiency of health services under conditions of a Kinzigtal type system, Gesundes Kinzigtal Integrated Care could become a role model for many similar regions in Germany.\\" As of 2020, Gesundes Kinzigtal has affiliate membership in the International Network of Health Promoting Hospitals, an international network of hospitals, health institutions, and other organizations who work to support health promotion. Integrated care It operates a regional integrated care system. This population-based integrated care approach is unusual in Germany. It works with two statutory health insurers, AOK Baden-W√ºrttemberg (the biggest health insurer in the region) and Sozialversicherung f√ºr Landwirtschaft, Forsten und Gartenbau (a specialist insurer which is only available to farmers and their families). Long-term contracts were agreed with the insurers for their insured populations, covering all age groups and care settings, at the beginning of the project. If the sickness funds spend less on health care than the population budget, Gesundes Kinzigtal shares the benefits. Programmes The first programmes initiated in 2006 were a smoking prevention scheme, a program for patients with osteoporosis, and one for elderly people. It now offers gym vouchers, dance classes, glee clubs and aqua-aerobics courses to encourage people to stay active. There are health promotion programmes in schools and workplaces, and ‚Äòpatient university‚Äô classes to offer health advice to support prevention and self-management. These are largely run by existing community organisations and local government agencies. In October 2014 all members were offered two ten-euro Boomerang Vouchers. One was for their own use in the programme, the other to benefit a social institution in the region. 1400 members made use of it, and the organisation matched the funding so 26,000 euros were collected. The most popular beneficiary was B√§renkind in Hausach. Second place went to the Kindergarten St. Josef in Oberwolfach. Clinicians are trained in shared decision-making so patients are actively involved in their own care when they do require input from health services. There are targeted programmes for high-risk population groups, such as older people, those living in nursing homes, people with long-term conditions, and people with high body mass index. There is a system-wide electronic health record so information about patients is available across providers. This enables effective co- ordination of care across different settings. Consultations with doctors are longer. \\"my consultations changed from an eye wink to an average of 15 minutes,... it needs more time to explain to patients what I'm doing and why.\\" In 2016 there were also access to different sports and nutrition advice as well as screening programmes to reduce loneliness. Evaluation Evaluation by independent research institutions is coordinated by a separate coordination agency, EKIV, in the department of medical sociology at Freiburg University. EKIV designs calls for tenders relating to research questions which have been agreed by the partners. The agreed basic research questions: *Does an integrated care system enhance patients‚Äô self-management? Does it stimulate a shared decision-making of doctors and patients more than ‚Äúnormal care‚Äù? *Does this system contribute to an increase in population health? Is such a system more effective than \\"normal care‚Äú? *How satisfied are physicians and other providers with the integrated care system? *Does the new integrated care system stimulate a more intensive interdisciplinary cooperation as compared with \\"normal care‚Äú? *Is this system more efficient than normal care? If so, does the Kinzigtal system provide at least the same service quality as normal care? *Does the new integrated care system lead to a better service quality and if so, does it increase service quality across all care sectors and health indications or only in a few sectors and/or indications? *Does the new integrated care system contribute to reduce over-, under-, and misuse of health services which is a feature of Germany's health service system? Evaluation by the PMV Research Group of the University of Cologne shows that this approach improves health outcomes and helps reduce health care costs. OptiMedis claims that the actual cost of the insured were almost 7% lower than expected costs. The researchers found a decline in over-, under- and misuse of healthcare in the region, and an increase in healthcare quality. Between 2006 and 2010, the project reduced costs by 16.9% against the population budget for members of one of the sickness funds, compared with a group of its members from a different region. This was chiefly because emergency hospital admissions only increased by 10.2% for patients in Kinzigtal, compared with the 33.1% increase in the comparator group. Overall, by 2017, the project reported a reduction of 6% in healthcare expenditure compared with that expected for the population. . Impact OptiMedis AG has established a similar operation in Leiden, OptiMedis Nederland BV. The majority shareholder is Adstrat Consulting BV. This is also based on the Triple Aim approach advocated by Donald Berwick - better patient care, a healthier and happier population and thereby lower output increases for health insurance.

Plot Lobby cards Using Alice Guy-Blach√®'s adapted screenplay from the Edgar Allan Poe short story, Alice built upon the lucid and dream-like piece of fiction by adding a significant amount of narrative structure to her adapted screenplay. Rather than having unexplained pain and trauma inflicted upon the films protagonist, Guy built a narrative surrounding the Spanish Inquisition and the film's protagonist fear. The first reel begins with a young and pretty girl named Isabelle (played by Blanche Cornwall) sitting upon a hill. It is then that she is attacked by Pedro (played by Fraunie Fraunholz). And following the common thematic trajectory of the time, Isabelle is then rescued by the kind and brave medical student who spends his time as a minister for the poor, Alonzo (played by Darwin Karr). Pedro is insistent on revenge and applies to the local monastery where Alonzo works in order to frame him. He hopes to frame him for the mysterious and sudden disappearance of the church's jewels. The frame ends immediately after Pedro plants the jewels in Alonzo's home and the monks are quick to punish Alonzo and Isabelle. Production The gruesome quality of the film proved to be a challenge for not only Guy-Blach√®, but the entire cast and crew. There was a large number of rats used throughout filming and they proved to be an ongoing burden throughout the shoot. In Guy Blach√®'s memoir she recalls Darwin Karr's difficulty with working with the rats. In order to get the rats to chew on a rope that ties down Karr's character in the film's later reels, they smeared food on the ropes to hold the rats position for the camera. However, they quickly grew tired of the food smeared on the rope and began sniffing Karr. Once Guy-Blach√® shouted \\"cut\\", Karr immediately quipped back in protest and would not agree to do another take. Following the wrap of the film there was the discussion about what to do with the rats. They isolated the majority of the rats and threw a cat in that immediately jumped back out. They then decided the second best course of action was to throw in a bulldog. But the bulldog proved just as futile as he was attacked by the rats. The only way they were able to finally put in an end to the rats was through cudgeling them. Critical reception A lot of critics had a difficult time with the film's gruesome qualities. The New York Dramatic Mirror was one of the many publications that took issue with the film: \\"There are terrible details in plenty, such as showing rats crawling over the body of a man strapped to a plank that should cause shudder quite as effectually as even's Poe's descriptions\\". Moving Picture World said \\"the sets are remarkably realistic and this is especially true of the dungeon filled monastery, into which the luckless hero is dragged and in which, before he is released, he is tortured with fiendish ingenuity. Film recovery The film was initially believed to be completely lost to time; however, there is one surviving reel at the Library of Congress.

It is one of the most important centers of the Peruvian archeology and features a vast necropolis of the pre-Hispanic era, with countless funerary sites. Permanent occupation in Ancon is documented throughout all periods of Andean history. The oldest evidence of human occupation dates back 10,000 years ago to the preceramic period. Location The beach resort area of Ancon is located 42 km north of Lima. Historically, it is known as the place where the peace treaty between Peru and Chile (Treaty of Anc√≥n) was signed in 1883. The archaeological site extends north of the Bay of Ancon and west of the Pan-American Highway. El Para√≠so, Peru is another important site in the area. Timeline Ancon is one of the few archaeological sites in the Andean region that boasts an ongoing cultural occupation throughout all periods of history, from the Andean Lithic Period (8000 BC) to the Late Horizon ending with the period of the Incas (1500 AD).Archaeology in Ancon - Ancon Museum The colonial and republican history of Peru is also attested. Studies Rectangular tapestry panel with stylized humans, Peru, Central Coast Wari at Ancon, c. 1000-1470 AD, cotton, alpaca wool - Krannert Art Museum, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign - Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, USA. Hjalmar Stolpe in Anc√≥n, Peru, 1884 during the Vanadis expedition. In 1870, during the construction of the railroad from Ancon to Pasamayo, the first large ancient tombs were discovered here. In 1875, German scholars Wilhelm Reiss and Alphons Stubel visited in the area, and made several excavations in and around the area of the necropolis. As a result, a three-volume study with good lithographs and drawings were published in Berlin in 1880-1887.English Translation: The Necropolis of Ancon in Peru: A Contribution to Our Knowledge of the Culture and Industries of the Empire of the Incas, 3 vols, 1880-1887 : vol. 1, vol. 2, vol. 3 The joint work of Reiss and Stubel is considered by some as the precursor of scientific archeology in Peru, although not yet applied stratigraphic methods. Further research was conducted by Max Uhle (1904) who was the first to record the large shell midden of Las Colinas. Other archaeologists working on this site include Paul Berthon (1907), and Ale≈° Hrdliƒçka (1913). In 1941, Gordon Willey and Marshall T. Newman conducted additional research, including in the area of Las Colinas. Given the announced development of the area of Miramar, a series of rescue investigations by Julio C. Tello were conducted between 1945 and 1950. Within the framework of this project, an area of 2000m by 200m was investigated, which revealed 1,570 tombs with 14,055 excavated objects. This work was published by (1951). Synthesizing the knowledge acquired up to then, Carrion noted the following: > ‚ÄúIn Ancon, there are remnants of three distinct periods: (1) a very old > period represented by elements of Chavin and sub-Chavin cultures; these are > found in the hills of Cerro San Pedro, in the southern part of the bay; (2) > an intermediate period represented by elements of the Wari Culture, with > local Ancon variations: and (3) the recent period represented by elements of > the Chancay and Inca cultures.‚Äù In 1959, Jorge C. Muelle, based on his excavations in Las Colinas area, located a preceramic layer below the Chavin remains, thus moving back the prehistory of Ancon several thousand years. The archaeologist Federico Kauffmann Doig also worked in the area of Miramar. Also, Peter Kaulicke published a 1997 work on Ancon funerary contexts. Description From the archaeological point of view we can distinguish the following areas: *Ancon I ('Las Colinas' and 'El Tanque'): ancient middens and refuse areas * Three walls in the western area that Uhle named \\"Fortaleza\\". * Ancon II or Necropolis, also known as 'Miramar'. * The Air Base * Cerro Pasamayo * A series of lithic period camps in the plains/pampas of Ancon and Piedras Gordas. Preceramic Ancon The archaeological evidence indicates human presence at Ancon from the lithic period onwards, i.e., from about 10,000 years ago at the pampas of Ancon and Piedras Gordas. Bifacial projectile points of Paijan type were found ‚Äì the type also present elsewhere along the Peruvian coast. In the Archaic period, sedentary fishermen and collectors of seafood and shellfish lived in the Bay of Ancon; this is evidenced by the presence of large middens, specifically in the area of Las Colinas. The arid soil explains the specialization of these peoples in the use of marine resources; nevertheless, they obtained additional resources through the exchange with the agricultural groups further inland. Site Museum Opened in 1993, the Ancon Site Museum houses more than 2,500 pieces excavated in the archaeological area, including pottery, textiles and mummies.

Design and development In 1917 Paul Deville was developing a twin engine observation aircraft when it became clear it would be underpowered and it was therefore not built during World War I. After the war the design, now called the C.21, was completed as a four-seat passenger aircraft. It was a three bay biplane, with fabric covered, constant chord, unswept wings ending at angled tips. The upper wing, which carried the ailerons, had an 8% greater span and a smaller chord. There was no stagger, so the sets of parallel interplane struts were vertical; flying wires braced each bay. Pairs of V-form engine struts, supporting the two Le Rh√¥ne 9C rotary engines above the lower wing, defined the inner two bays. There were short, parallel cabane struts from the upper fuselage. The C.21's fuselage was almost flat sided, with a vertical knife edge at the short nose. It had an open cockpit starting in the extreme nose and seating the three passengers in tandem; the pilot's cockpit was under the trailing edge, with a deep cut-out for better upward vision. At the rear a straight edged, long and low fin carried a straight edged, balanced rudder that extended down to the keel. An angled tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage had elevators with a cut-out for rudder movement and it had a tailskid undercarriage, with pairs of mainwheels on axles attached to longitudinal bars fixed under the engines on N-form struts. Operational history The date of the C.21's first flight is uncertain but it was before February 1919. On 10‚Äì11 February it gained publicity with four flights between Paris and Brussels, a distance of covered in about 140 minutes. They were flown by Chanteloup, accompanied by designer Deville, to retrieve the passengers from a Caudron C.23, modified into a passenger transport, which had broken a tailskid at Brussels. The C.21 was advertised in the Caudron catalogue at a price of FF 30,000. It seems only one example was built but its layout was repeated in Caudron's successively larger and more powerful C.22 and C.23 night bombers.

Its main campus is in Aix-en-Provence, France, and offers satellite programs throughout Spain, Morocco, and the United Kingdom. Established in 1957, IAU was one of the first American-style, English language, liberal arts educational institutions in Western Europe. It is chartered by the Regents of the State University of New York and is recognized by the Rectorat of Aix-Marseille University and by the French Ministry of Education as a private higher education institution. IAU is often considered the oldest and largest study abroad program in Europe and the first institution to offer a study abroad program to those studying programs other than French language. History Manning Hall houses IAU's School of Humanities and Social Sciences. IAU was founded in 1957 by academics and former diplomats such as Dr. Herbert Maza, who also served as its first President., Dr. Evron Kirkpatrick, Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, and others who wanted to provide a platform for Americans interested in studying diplomatic relations with related interests and careers in the foreign service and the State Department. It was founded under the authority of Aix-Marseille University and offered a study abroad program, providing for transfer credit to those willing to live and study in France for one year. With its inception, it became the first institution to offer study abroad programs to students with majors other than language. By 1966 the Institute had an enrollment of approximately 150 students and in 1976 it incorporated The Marchutz School of Fine Arts (founded by Leo Marchutz) into the program. The program grew and as of 2015 has served more than 700 colleges and universities with over 20,000 undergraduates, and an annual enrollment of over 700. Programs and locations IAU College Dean, Dr. Leigh Smith, leads students through the Borghese Gallery in Rome as part of IAU's January Term/Intersession programs. IAU's main campus is located in Aix-en-Provence in the southern region of France where its programs of study are provided in French and English. The Aix campus is home to IAU's School of Humanities and Social Sciences, the Marchutz School of Fine Arts, the School of Business and International Relations, and the 'Centre d'Etudes Fran√ßaises'.

Mosby is an American politician in Baltimore, Maryland. He was first elected to serve on the Baltimore City Council. at the age of 32. Mosby served on the Baltimore City Council from December 2011 to December 2016 passing major pieces of legislation like the most progressive form of Ban the Box in the country, addressing proliferation of liquor establishments in high crime and impoverished communities, and working to comprehensively evaluate outdated zoning designations. In January 2017, Mosby was appointed to serve as a member of the Maryland General Assembly in the Maryland House of Delegates representing Baltimore City's 40th District. He was equally successful as a Delegate passing legislation eliminating the draconian practice of selling liens of residents homes for unpaid water bills, developing tax credit programs to strengthen endowments of Maryland's Historically Black Colleges and Universities, requiring the state to allow GED recipients access to over $83 million annual dollars in state higher education scholarships, and passing Ban the Box statewide. Prior to public service, Mosby worked as an electrical engineer managing large scale telecommunication system projects and building multi-million dollar state of the art video cloud storage and computing data centers. Mosby is a 1997 graduate of the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute and has a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from Tuskegee University. Mosby is a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity, having been initiated at the Pi Omega Chapter in Baltimore. Political career Baltimore City Council Mosby defeated two-term incumbent Baltimore City Councilwoman Belinda K. Conaway by a double-digit margin. This surprising political upset shocked the political establishment and received a lot of attention because it was the first time in almost thirty years where a political challenger beat a seated member of the Baltimore City Council. As a Councilman, Mosby organized over 60 Enough is Enough marches, working with police and community groups to reduce crime and violence in West Baltimore. Seeing how poor health was harming his community, Mosby started the \\"Get Fit with Councilman Mosby\\" Challenge, partnering with close to 30 personal trainers, fitness organizations and chefs, the American Heart Association and Y of Central MD to provide free access to fitness and cooking classes. Mosby has long fought for criminal justice reform. As Councilman, he developed and ran a mentoring program for juveniles awaiting trial as adults in the Baltimore City Detention Center. He introduced a law that was passed banning the requirement of criminal records on job applications, which enabled ex- offenders to have a fresh start. He also introduced a law that was passed stopping liquor stores from selling merchandise to children. Mosby arranged for the donation of school supplies for thousands of children, and organized free cultural enriching trips for thousands of children in West Baltimore. In 2012, Mosby appeared on the reality show Kitchen Nightmares, presenting Cafe Hon owner Denise Whiting a Baltimore City resolution. =2015 Baltimore Uprising= During the 2015 Baltimore protests following the death of Freddie Gray, Mosby said that the unrest was \\"unproductive\\" but also the result of decades old of lack of investment and socio-economic decline. Mosby's unscripted comments in the middle of the street with protestors, burning buildings, and looters quickly went viral and garnered over two million views in a little over a day. During the interview Mosby also pointed out how the media was quick to call the incident a \\"riot\\" but consistently failed to do the same when compared to other incidents, like the 2015 riots in Lexington, Kentucky, after the Kentucky Wildcats lost to the Wisconsin Badgers. That interview would later be used by communication organizations and colleges as an example of staying on message despite surroundings and rapid fire questioning from reporters. Mosby represented District 7 on the Baltimore City Council, where most of the civil unrest occurred. Bid for mayor On October 26, 2015, Mosby announced that he was running for mayor of Baltimore. He dropped out of the race on April 13, 2016., Baltimore Sun, 2016 When he announced his bid for the mayoral election, Mosby decided to forego a bid for re-election to his seat on the council. On November 8, 2016, Leon F. Pinkett won his vacated seat on the council. Electoral history Personal life Mosby is married to Marilyn (n√©e James), the state's attorney of Baltimore City. They have two children together. He is Catholic. In October 2020, a $45,000 tax lien was filed against the property of Nick Mosby and his wife, Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby, for three years of unpaid federal taxes (2014, 2015, and 2016).

From 1892 to 1893, he was able to study in Paris, thanks to a scholarship and, in 1894, with Mucha's assistance, gave a showing at the Salon. His first major exhibition in Prague came in 1897. He was married in 1899 and, shortly after, bought a small house in Hroznov√° Lhota, which he used as a studio. In 1904, it was transformed into a two-story villa, inspired by folk architecture, with a design by Du≈°an Jurkoviƒç. It soon became a popular meeting place for many notable Czech artists, writers and composers. The following year, however, his wife's mental condition, which was always poor, took a turn for the worse and it was necessary to place her in the mental hospital at Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ. She stayed there until her death in 1959. After this time, he largely turned away from painting to do etchings. From 1922 to 1937, he lived in a castle in Ilava and maintained a studio in the Slovakian countryside, where he went for inspiration. In 1928, he visited Dubrovnik, where he observed the local customs. His folk paintings received a major showing in Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ at the \\"V√Ωstava Slov√°cka 1937\\".

Mahala Problem, officially Problem oHG, was a cigarette company from Berlin, popular and successful before and after the First World War. The company was founded on March 25, 1889, by Szlama Rochmann in Berlin, and later bought in 1932 by Reemtsma.  History   Company Creation  The Jewish cigarette manufacturer Szlama Rochmann (17 June 1857‚Äì17 December 1925) founded in 1889 Cigarettenmanufaktur Mahala-Problem (Cigarette manufacturer Mahala-Problem) at Alexanderstra√üe 13/22 (Alexanderhof) in Berlin. This was after his brother, Baruch Rochmann (1863‚Äì1926), had taken over the family cigarette manufacturing company \\"Namkori-Ph√§nomen\\" from his father Israel Jacob Rochman (22 June 1837‚Äì31 July 1881) in 1881. At the turn of the 20th Century, Szlama hired commercial artists such as Louis Oppenheim, Ernst Deutsch-Dryden, Lindenstaedt, Lucian Bernhard to create advertisements. The German commercial artist Hans Rudi Erdt created the famous Fez wearing Moslem as the brand image for the Problem-Cigarettes. In 1914, after the 25th anniversary of the company, Szlama acquired the grounds of 212-213 Greifswalder Stra√üe in Berlin from Gustav Magnus (not to be confused with Heinrich Gustav Magnus), to turn it in the headquarters for manufacturing of their cigarette brands. Between 1914 and 1929, the Jewish architect Moritz Ernst Lesser and Ernst Ludwig Freud (Son of Sigmund Freud) were commissioned to build the factory for production and storage. The Rochmann family with four children were also living at the building. After the death of Szlama in 1925, his two sons Heinrich Rochmann and Carl Rochmann took over the father's business, still headquartered on the Greifswalder Stra√üe. The tombstones of Szlama, his parents and his brother are located at the Jewish graveyard of Berlin-Wei√üensee.  Downfall  After a bad harvest of Turkish tobacco, increased taxes for the storage of tobacco, as well as the onset of the Great Depression, the family sold first the brand Problem-Cigarettes (1930), and then the entire company (1932) to the Hamburg based company Reemtsma. Szlama's wife (Hanna) and their sons moved to the west Berlin, while their daughter Erna lived with her husband in Central Berlin (Prager Platz). The production halls were then rented out by Reemtsma from 1935 to the Reichsarbeitsdienst and were converted into sewing halls. With the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany, Heinrich Rochmann (son of Szlama) was successful in emigrating to England in 1934. Carl Rochmann and his wife Else were murdered in 1942 after being deported to Auschwitz during World War II. The family house was auctioned in 1943.
