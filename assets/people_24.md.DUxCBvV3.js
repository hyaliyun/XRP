In 2008. The Slovenes Kleemar, David, and Jernej joined the band rendering the group Croatian-Slovenian in its composition. Lollobrigida band members * Ida Prester – vocals * Petra Cigoj – vocals * Kleemar (Matej Končan) – keyboards * Jernej Šavel – bass guitar * Ivan Levačić Levi – drums Early history As a duo, Lollobrigida performed for the first time at a bigger public concert in June 2003 in the student club KSET, as an opening band for German trash-style musician Mambo Kurt, attracting immediately a pronounced interest within Zagreb's underground-music audience. In the original lineup there were Ida Prester and Natalija Dimicevski singing and playing bass-guitar on top of their computer-generated music matrix. In February 2004 the duo performed as a sole band at the crowded concert in Zagreb's Studentski centar; after that they signed a contract with the Slovenian label Menart Records/DOP Records. In June 2004 Lollobrigida performed at the third Zagreb Pride. Lollobrigida's first single, \\"Party\\", was released in September 2004 soon becoming a pretty well-accepted hit, rendering the underground phenomenon into a name known to many, first in Croatia and latter on in the neighboring countries. Sizeable covering in Croatian media, involving print, radio, and television, release of an anti-holiday single \\"Unhappy Christmas\\", and a performance at the big rock-concert Fiju Briju in Zagreb all enabled Lollobrigida to keep a high level of interest in the audience till the release of their debut album Cartoon Explosion, in May 2005. The girls have promoted the album in the club KSET again. The introductory band at the latter concert was a hip-hop duo Bitcharke na travi from Serbia, Beograd. VIS Lollobrigida In 2006 Lollobrigida transformed to some extent their musical and stage-performing concept. Natalija left the band. Several instrumentalists, playing keyboards, guitar and bass, joined the band adding a new sound quality to the electronic matrix background. Unlike Ida, the band founder and the Lollobrigida constant, other band members were changing rather frequently. The prefix VIS has been also added to the band name. (A sort of sentimental homage to pop-rock music of socialistic times). During that year Lollobrigida started working on their new album, 'Lollobrigida Incorporated', finally released in May 2008, following the promo-concert taken place in Zagreb club Tvornica. In 2005 the single 'Bubblegum boy' was released. Soon after, the accompanied video spot was broadcast by MTV Adria and many other local TV-networks. In 2006 the band increased its popularity by releasing the single and video spot 'Moj decko je gay' (meaning 'My boyfriend is gay'). In 2008, a few months before a release of the new album, the single (and a video- spot) 'Miss Right and Mrs. Wrong' was launched, reaching the top positions on many Croatian musical top-lists. In June 2009. the single and the video spot 'Volim te' was released reaching the top position on the 'Pure MTV Adria Chart list'.Pure MTV Adria Chart list, 30.08.2009. The English version of the spot 'Volim te' was promoted on MTV Adria in November 2009. In 2010. Lollobrigida released the single and videospot 'Bivša djevojka' ('Ex-girlfriend') and in 2011. the singles and videospots 'Kompjuter' and 'Sex on TV, sex on the radio'. In numerous interviews in Croatian media Ida Prester announced in 2011 work on the third band's album. Immediately before its promotion the single 'Malo vremena' was released. The third album by Lollobrigida, 'Pilula', was premièred on 21. January 2012 at the concert held in the club Tvornica, Zagreb. On 18.6.2012. single and the video 'Ja se resetiram' ('I'm resetting') was released, immediately attracting some international attention. Musical style and performances Band Lollobrigida at the streets of Zagreb in one of their concert outfits. Lyrics, music and stage performance appear to be equally important elements of the way that Lollobrigida band communicates with its audience. By insisting on honesty, simplicity and originality Lollobrigida keeps distance from standard musical and textual stereotypes, choosing instead a sort of genre indeterminacy. At variance with the latter elements, the perfection of their musical and vocal interpretations is not particularly cultivated. Ida Prester authors the lyrics of all the songs being simultaneously, taking into account the whole opus up to now, a leading author of all music as well. Critics have expressed variety of opinions about Lollobrigida; some are denying any value and/or musical importanceexamples may be found at Cartoon Explosion) while there are also those remarking '...Lollobrigida is the biggest thing that Croatia gave to the international music scene in the past years...'.announcement of the invited participation at the Budapest Sziget festival 2008, http://www.budapestinfo.hu/en/calendar_of_events/sziget_festival_2008 Time Out (magazine), in its edition focusing life in Croatia, inserted band Lollobrigida on the list of 115 most prominent acts/individuals/places of contemporary Croatian culture.http://www.timeoutcroatia.com/culture/ Since their start-up Lollobrigida was performing at numerous concerts in Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Hungary and Macedonia. On 1 September 2009 MTV Adria nominated Lollobrigida for the Best Regional Act Award, together with four bands from Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia.

The award was handed over to the band in the course of MTV Europe Music Awards 2009 show, which took place on 5 November 2009 in Berlin, Germany in O2 World hall. Among their live performances one can especially single out a sequence of six well-accepted performances, from 2005 on, at EXIT (festival), Novi Sad, Serbia. There, Lollobrigida became a sort of a trademark of the festival's 'Elektrana' Stage. In 2009.

The formation is more commonly referred to as the Raider Forces (), and a soldier belonging to the Brigade a Raider (). History=Sacred Squadron= The nucleus of the Raider units was the Sacred Squadron (Ieros Lochos), a Free Greek unit of commandos attached to the Allied 1st Special Air Service (1 SAS) Brigade during the Second World War. Its members consisted of mainly officers and NCOs who had fled to North Africa after the fall of Greece to Axis forces. After its formation in 1942, the Sacred Squadron, along with a unit of Free French troops and British commandos, formed the basis of L Detachment, a component of the SAS which specialised in hit-and-run raids on Axis airfields, ports and fuel dumps throughout North Africa. The Sacred Squadron was later transferred to the Greek theatre of operations, where they recaptured several eastern Aegean islands from Axis forces. After the liberation of Greece from German occupation, a proposal was made for the reformation of the Hellenic Armed Forces under British guidance. This proposal included the establishment of a small, highly trained, special warfare unit. =Mountain Raider Companies= When the Greek Civil War broke out in 1946, the Greek Government formed a special warfare unit, primarily to help Greek royalist capture territory which was still in the hands of communist-inspired guerrillas. Mountain Raider Companies (LOK) (, Lochoi Oreinōn Katadromōn), were formed on 20 January 1947 and began operations almost immediately in Greece's mountainous terrain. The Beta Raider Squadron was formed at Vouliagmeni, Athens in August 1947 and took part in civil war operations in Thessaly, Central Greece, Epirus, West Macedonia and Euboea. The Delta Raider Squadron was established at the port city of Volos, Thessaly in December 1947 and operated in all regions of Greece during the Civil War. The Epsilon Raider Squadron was formed in April 1949 and took part in Civil War operations until December 1949. By 1949, the LOK squadrons were so successful against the communist insurgents that the Raider Forces Command was expanded to two brigades. Gamma Raider Squadron, also formed in 1949, was redesignated as an amphibious-capable unit in 1963, while Alpha Raider Squadron, disbanded at the end of the Civil War, was reactivated in 1968, and later re-formed as an amphibious unit in 1974, after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. In the late-1960s, the Greek Central Intelligence Service (KYP), and the CIA became secretly involved with training and arming the Lokatzides. A tool of the KYP and CIA, a LOK detachment played a part in the 1967 Greek coup d'état by storming and securing the Army General Staff buildings at Cholargos, Athens. =Raider Forces= After the fall of the Papadopoulos regime, and the establishment of a democratic republic in 1975, the LOK were dismantled and re-formed as the Raider Forces (), and placed under the command of the Hellenic Army's Special Forces Command (). A further restructuring of the Greek Army in 1996 saw the amalgamation of all Raider Forces regiments into the current brigade formation.  Uniform and unit insignia  1st Paratroopers Brigade soldiers wear the standard-issue 'Greek Lizard' camouflage battle dress uniforms (BDU) of the Hellenic Army. Members of the Special Paratrooper Unit (ETA) and Z' MAK may occasionally wear non- standard issue BDUs depending on mission requirements. All members of the brigade wear the unit insignia depicting a winged sword, representative of the \\"deadly, silent and swift\\" nature of special forces operations. A scroll runs across the sword and wings with the motto \\"Who Dares Wins\\" ( - O Tolmon Nika), a tribute to the Free Greek Special Forces that served with the 1 SAS Brigade during World War II. The unit flash is emblazoned with ΔΥΝΑΜΕΙΣ ΚΑΤΑΔΡΟΜΩΝ (Raider Forces). While on operations, low-visibility patches are worn. All Raiders wear the green beret with the national emblem on the left.

It was served by trains on the main line between York and Thirsk. From 1891 to 1957 it was the junction of the Easingwold Railway which connected the main line to the town of Easingwold. The station was north of York Station. History Opened by the Great North of England Railway. It became part of the London and North Eastern Railway during the Grouping of 1923, passing on to the Eastern Region of British Railways during the nationalisation of 1948. It was then closed by the British Transport Commission. In 1930, a third track was added at Alne and in 1959 fourth track was laid down. The station buildings were demolished in 1964 and since then, the line between York and Northallerton has been four tracks - two up lines and two down lines. Bradshaws Railway Timetable of 1922 indicates that there was eight trains per day in each direction on the Easingwold line. Accidents and incidents *In 1877 the boiler of a locomotive exploded whilst it was hauling a freight train. Fragments were thrown up to away.

The work was composed in Italy c. 1650-51, and first published in 1664.Alfred Harbage, Thomas Killigrew, Cavalier Dramatist 1612-83, Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1930. Genre and source Like the majority of Killigrew's plays -- stage plays or closet dramas -- Cicilia and Clorinda is cast in the mode of tragicomedy, with its highly colored elements of romance, and limited realism. The play may be more interpreted and judged in the romance tradition than in the dramatic; the work is \\"a means of providing the matter of romance in an alternative form.\\"Dale B. J. Randall, Winter Fruit: English Drama 1642-1660, Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, p. 343. Killigrew employed the closet-drama form to work with material that would have met strong resistance on the public stage of his time. Cicilia and Clorinda is in part an exploration of the idea of the Amazon or \\"warrior woman\\" (he coined the term \\"Heroickess\\").Karen L. Raber, \\"Warrior Women in the Plays of Cavendish and Killigrew,\\" Studies in English Literature, 1500-1900, Vol. 40 No. 3 (Summer 2000), pp. 413-33. When Killigrew wrote the work, women were not yet allowed to appear onstage in England. In writing the work, Killigrew was influenced by Artamène, ou Le Grand Cyrus, by Madeleine and Georges de Scudéry.Harbage, pp. 204-5. His characters Amadeo, Lucius, and Manlius are versions of the French novel's Aglatidas, Artabes, and Megabises (Part 1, Book 3). Publication Both parts of Cicilia and Clorinda were first printed in Comedies and Tragedies, the collected edition of Killigrew's plays issued by Henry Herringman in 1664. The collected edition specifies that Part 1 was written in Turin, and Part 2 in Florence, during Killigrew's years of exile in the English Commonwealth period. Part 1 is dedicated to Lady Anne Villiers, Countess of Morton, and Part 2 is dedicated to Lady Dorothy Sidney, Countess of Sunderland. Carew and Crofts Killigrew includes the Thomas Carew poem \\"Song of Jealousy\\" in Cicilia and Clorinda Part 2, Act V scene ii, where it concludes the play. According to Killigrew, Carew wrote the poem in 1633, in response to a dispute between Killigrew and Cecilia Crofts, then a maid of honor to Queen Henrietta Maria and later Killigrew's first wife (1636-38). Carew also wrote a poem, \\"The morning stormy,\\" in celebration of the Killigrew/Crofts wedding. In addition to Cicilia and Clorinda, Killigrew employs his first wife's name for the heroine of his early play The Princess. Critical scrutiny Often neglected by critics and readers, English closet dramas of the 17th century began to claim a greater share of critical attention toward the end of the 20th century. Margaret Cavendish has been the main beneficiary of this shift in focus, though writers like Killigrew and works like Cicilia and Clorinda have also benefitted.Karen L.

Life As the youngest son of Thomas Yates, a tobacco manufacturer, of Thames Street and Russell Square, Frederick was educated at a preparatory school at Winchmore Hill and at Charterhouse School (at the former meeting John Reeve, whom he would later work with) before joining the commissariat department. In that job he was with Wellington in the Peninsular War and possibly at the battle of Waterloo. When peace came, he met Charles Mathews at a fancy ball before accompanying him on a trip to France in winter 1817/18 and becoming an actor on his advice (his first stage appearance was in Boulogne during the trip). He then appeared at Edinburgh before making his London debut on 7 November 1818 at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, where he remained until 1824/25. Through his marriage he was related to the Robertsons who ran the Lincoln and Stamford theatrical circuits, it was not long before he was able to take productions on tour. James Rodwell, who was the lessee of the Adelphi Theatre, died in 1824 or 1825, and the lease passed to his brother George Herbert Buonaparte Rodwell; it then came on the market, and Yates with Daniel Terry bought it, at a price of £30,000. They opened it on 10 October 1825 with Killigrew, for which they both were in the cast: it included also Benjamin Wrench, John Reeve, and Fanny Elizabeth Fitzwilliam. Yates put on a three-act production of Yates Laughable Entertainments at Stamford Theatre on 13 and 14 June 1827 and Popular Entertainments on 25 and 26 June in Lincoln theatre. In 1829 he brought over a female elephant from Paris to star in the Adelphi theatre and she brought in crowds, its debut in The Elephant of Siam and the Fire Fiend was reported as one of the most successful ever with the walls of the theatre actually shaking from the thunders of applause. Yates took it on tour in 1830 when in August in Newcastle the elephant killed one of its keepers and seriously injured the other. In 1833 he brought with him Harriet Waylett to perform at King's Lynn theatre. Yates managed the Adelphi until his retirement from management in 1842 (seven years after his patron Mathews' death in 1835). He also co-managed the Caledonian Theatre, later renamed the Adelphi, on Leith Walk in Edinburgh (with William Henry Murray, 1830–31), the Colosseum in Regent's Park (with John Braham, 1835) , and the Royal Pavilion Theatre in Marylebone (with Thomas Gladstone, 1838). He was still acting until the time of his death on 21 June 1842, having just arrived at Euston-square by train , he was buried at St Martin in the Fields. Family Yates married the actress Elizabeth Brunton (21 July 1799 – 30 August 1860) daughter of John Brunton, manager of the Exeter theatre on 7 December 1823. Their son Edmund Hodgson Yates become a journalist, playwright and novelist.

The Road Traffic Offenders Act route via Section 20 certification is a clear advantage over the unapproved equipment route to court. The Type Approval of devices that meet the definitions or more accurately \\"prescriptions\\" of types of devices in Statutory Instruments (forms of secondary legislation) is administered by the Home Office Road Crimes Section with the scientific scrutiny now performed by The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) in conjunction with accredited technical laboratories. The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC)https://www.npcc.police.uk/ oversee a secretariat who coordinate police and laboratory testing of equipment in the process. Only when DSTLhttps://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and- technology-laboratory scrutiny, laboratory testing and road testing is completed, and the equipment fully meets the specifications in the relevant Home Office Speedmeter Handbook will the equipment be recommended to the Secretary of State to be awarded UK Type Approval. Once recommended an administrative process takes place between the Home Office and the UK manufacturer or distributing agent in which a contract (Type Approval Agreement) is exchanged and agreed between both parties. When that contract is signed then a Type Approval Certificate is signed by a minister at the Home Office; the equipment can then be used to produce certifiable evidence, evidence of speeding that is admissible in UK courts without the support of a witness. There is no requirement to place the Type Approval Agreement or Certificate of Type Approval before Parliament because the Statutory Instrument defining the \\"type\\" of equipment has already been fully ratified by both Houses of Parliament. The accuracies required to meet HOTA, as laid out in the Speedmeter Handbooks, are agreed internationally. They are not particularly challenging to meet for modern digital equipment however, HOTA requirements extend beyond accuracies; it is often the requirement that an instrument must not cause a violation record to be made when no violation exists that is the most difficult to meet. The Speedmeter Handbooks are freely and openly available to view, they provide guidance to manufacturers and the accredited test laboratories in the general requirements. DSTL and the Home Office may vary the requirements at any time and may adapt them depending upon the equipment that is to be assessed, the Handbooks being \\"guidance\\". http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100408155424/http://scienceandresearch.homeoffice.gov.uk//hosdb/publications/road- policing-publications/15-05-Speedmeter-Handbook12835.pdf?view=Binary Unlike Approval systems in most countries no equipment is Approved without a police input into the testing. Rather than simply testing speed accuracy, the systems are all tested in real traffic situations some of which are created specifically to test a perceived weakness in the systems. Track and real road testing is always conducted so that all kinds of vehicles and traffic situations are used to stimulate the systems. Roadside equipment such as fixed cameras must pass environmental testing before deployment in road testing. The period used for road testing ensures that the systems are tested in all weathers. If one detection is made that is outside of the accuracy parameters or if one violation record is produced when no violation existed during any test, then the device will fail its Approval until that error is rectified to the satisfaction of the Home Office and DSTL. When rectification is demonstrated testing may recommence.

Born in Warsaw, he worked and taught in France, Germany (where he was active in the Berlin Secession movement) and his native Poland. His oil painting relied on the use of heavy impasto and was in style closely related to Impressionism. In Munich in 1894 he embarked upon an affair with Franziska, Gräfin (i.e. Countess) zu Reventlow (Fanny zu Reventlow). She was pregnant with Herstein's child when in 1895 she married the politician Walter Lübke. The pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. An engraving of his, called 'The Standard Bearer', is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), New York. There are two works from the years 1914-5 held by the Brooklyn Museum, New York. In the years 1904–1911 he was the owner of a private school of painting in Warsaw. One of his pupils was Roman Kramsztyk. Herstein died in Berlin.

History ARN began their broadcasting activities in 1967 and has since then provided affiliates in Arkansas top news headlines, agriculture business news, sports, and specialty programming. The Network started as the Delta Farm Network, an early morning program by KARK Farm Director Bob Buice, who also appeared on KARK-TV. Known for his velvet- like voice, he also did a weekend program on the Network for many years called \\"Uncle Bob's Stories from the Bible\\". The network later expanded to include the \\"AP&L; (Arkansas Power and Light, later Entergy) Live Better Electrically Hour\\", a program of music played in the late morning and broadcast over KARK- FM's 100 kW signal. Ted Snider purchased KARK AM-FM from Mullins Broadcasting and founded the Arkansas Radio Network with newscasts provided by KARK-TV Newscasters (Don Corbett and Les Bolton) and Sportscaster Jim Elder. KARK was distributed by KARK-FM or by relays through other FM stations (KNBY-FM in Newport to KRLW-Walnut Ridge as an example). ARN's growth came in the early 1980s, when distribution moved to satellite, and the number of affiliates grew into the 70s. ARN was a staple across the state in the 1980s and 1990s, with the newscast broadcast at :55 minutes past each hour.

In the early 1930s, the \\"Imperial Hatworks\\" located in heritage buildings called the Hatworks Boulevard (150 years old history), at No. 32, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, used to make the \\"pretied Mysuru peta\\" for the Maharajah of Mysuru. This place was owned by Manackjee who had set up shop after studying hatmaking in the UK. But this shop closed down a few years after Manackjee's death in 1959. The old-world ambiance of the Hatworks Boulevard has been restored as a minor tourist place with a boutique, French spa, cafe-and-pastry shop, an art gallery (through a tie-up with Crimson Art Gallery), a home furnishing store, an art costume jewellery store and a shop selling custom-made marble pieces.Adapting to preserve beauty  Social and religious tradition  Dolls in Kodava attire of Kodagu The people of the Mysuru district and the Kodagu district feel proud to wear turbans called Mysuru peta. In Kodagu district, it is part of the traditional dress worn on special occasions such as weddings. Men wear a turban during religious ceremonies to portray respect and reverence towards the Supreme Being. Distinguished people are honoured by the award of a Mysuru peta in formal functions.Cultural India: Indian Clothing: Turban University Convocation cap Convocation caps are adorned by students and faculty during convocation ceremonies. This practice has been changed by the Inter-University Board (IUB) of Karnataka, which has ruled that students passing out of the nine universities in Karnataka shall no longer wear the traditional black cap - the mortarboard (as it was considered a British legacy) - during their proud moments. Instead, universities have been given the option of using the traditional Mysuru peta. The academic cap or square, commonly known as the \\"mortarboard\\", a symbol of the academia is a flat square hat with a tassel suspended from a button in the top centre of the board. The tassel is made of a cluster of silk threads, which are fastened by a button at one end and fixed at the centre of the headpiece. In Karnataka University Convocation, students have now the option to wear the Karnataka's traditional Mysuru peta, a turban made of silk or cotton cloth with jari tied to the head in a traditional way (tied Mysuru petas or turbans are readily marketed for the purpose in most major cities of the state).http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1670080.cms Mysore peta in, graduation cap out See also * Kodagu * Mysuru * Culture of Mysuru References Culture of Karnataka Indian headgear Kingdom of Mysore ","title":"Mysore peta"},{"id":"18552589","text":"Elise Valmorbida (1961—) is an Italian Australian writer and creative writing tutor who lives in London, England.

It was founded in 1897 as an infantry division and has fought in all major conflicts in which Greece has been involved. During the Balkan Wars, it acquired the sobriquet \\"Iron Division\\" (). It is currently headquartered in Veroia, Macedonia. Despite its title, it is no longer a conventional infantry division, but a formation comprising the various special forces of the Hellenic Army - a role similar to that once held by the now disbanded 3rd Special Forces Division. History=Greco-Turkish War of 1897= The 1st Infantry Division was established in Larissa on 19 March 1897 before the outbreak of, and in response to, the Greco-Turkish War. Formed, predominantly, from personnel recruited from Thessaly, it originally comprised two infantry brigades (1st and 2nd) and three Evzone battalions, and was tasked with the defence of the frontier from the Thermaic Gulf (near the Tria Platania heights) to the Bogazi pass, near Tyrnavos. Its first commander was Major General Nikolaos Makris. Evzones of the 1st Infantry Division at breakfast, Larissa 1897. Based in Rapsani, on the division's right flank, was the Nezeros Detachment (Απόσπασμα Νεζερού), consisting of the three Evzone battalions and two companies from the 5th Infantry Regiment. The left flank, from Godoman to Bogazi, was controlled by the 2nd Infantry Brigade, based at Tyrnavos. The 1st Infantry Brigade was kept in reserve at Larissa. Divisional Command, under Major-General Nikolaos Makris, was also based in Larissa. On 4 April 1897, an exchange of fire between soldiers from opposing outposts at Bairaktari gradually escalated to skirmishes along the frontier in the Rapsani sector. The next morning, the Nezerou Detachment launched a major attack, captured most of the Turkish outposts and forced a retreat along the line. Turkish counter-attacks were held back on the flanks, but the three Greek battalions defending the center were soon overwhelmed by twenty-two Turkish battalions and five artillery batteries. Greek forces quickly retreated to Mati, leaving the Melouna Pass undefended. As a result, the 2nd Infantry Brigade was also forced to retreat to Mati. Panoramic view of the battlefield at the Melouna Pass on the Greco-Turkish border, with Greek positions in the foreground and the advancing Turks beyond, 1897. The Nezeros Detachment was again forced to abandon its positions near Mati on 9 April 1897 and retreat towards the Pineios River. The battle at Deleria on 11 April 1897 resulted in a defeat for the division, which continued their retreat towards Larissa. The 1st Infantry Division, beaten and demoralized, marched towards Farsala where on 23 April 1897, the Turkish Army attacked the Greek 1st and 2nd Brigades on the northern outskirts of the town. In danger of being cut-off and surrounded, the division was able to regroup and retreat to Domokos where they formed a defensive line on the right flank of the Greek Army. Led by the 3rd Infantry Division, the Turkish offensive on the right flank of the Greek 1st Infantry Division on 5 May 1897 forced a Greek retreat, again, towards Vouzi. The division's center, under attack by the Turkish 6th Infantry Division, also retreated. However, on the left flank, the Greek units were able to defend successfully against the Turkish 2nd Infantry Division. Another Turkish attack on the left flank on 6 May 1897 was repelled, but the 1st Infantry Division was ordered to retreat to, and hold the line, at Lamia. A ceasefire was agreed at midday on 7 May 1897. The 1st Infantry Division had lost 232 killed and 842 wounded. Greece's defeat in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 had highlighted the many deficiencies of the Greek military. Through the efforts of Georgios Theotokis and Eleftherios Venizelos plans were put in place to modernize and improve the capabilities of the Greek Army, eventually leading to French involvement and the adoption of the triangular division. =First Balkan War= At the outbreak of the First Balkan War, under the command of Major- General Emmanouil Manousogiannakis, the 1st Infantry Division was attached to the Army of Thessaly. The division comprised the following units: *2nd Infantry Regiment, based at Lamia *4th Infantry Regiment, based at Larissa *5th Infantry Regiment, based at Trikala *1st and 2nd Squadrons from the 1st Field Artillery Regiment, based at Larissa *Engineer Company, based at Larissa *Support Squadron consisting of field hospital, ambulance, convoy and ordnance troops, based at Larissa On 5 October 1912, the division moved to, and recaptured, the Melouna Pass. The engagement resulted in the first casualties for the newly reorganized division (9 killed, 20 wounded). Ordered to defend the Tyrnavos-Kazaklar sector while the rest of the Greek Army mobilized, the 1st Division was reinforced by four Evzone battalions. On 6 October 1912, the division attacked well-entrenched Turkish positions on the northern outskirts of Elassona. The battle was hard-fought, with victory for the Greeks secured when forces on the division's right flank captured Turkish positions on the Tsaritsani heights. The Turks were soon forced to abandon their positions around the town. The 1st Division then marched toward Sarantaporo, arriving in the area on the night of 8 October 1912. The Ottoman VIII Corps, ordered to halt the Greek Army's advance north, had retreated and regrouped around the town. On 9 October 1912, during the Battle of Sarantaporo, the 1st Infantry Division, along with the 2nd and 3rd divisions, began a full frontal assault on Turkish positions. Withstanding heavy casualties during their advance, primarily due to accurate Turkish artillery barrage, the 1st Division managed to capture a shoulder and two nearby hillocks. On the division's right wing, the Konstantinopoulos Evzone Detachment (Απόσπασμα Ευζώνων Κωνσταντινόπουλου) was able to advance and capture Turkish positions at Livadi. The Greek 4th Infantry Division, in the meantime, had broken through Turkish lines on the western flank and captured the Porta Pass.The Hellenic Army during the Balkan Wars 1912-1913, Volume 1, p. 60, (Hellenic Army General Staff, Army History Directorate, Athens 1988) On the night of 9 October 1912 Turkish forces, taking advantage of the bad weather, retreated and escaped encirclement. A Turkish battalion remained, facing the Konstantinopoulos Detachment's positions at Livadi, oblivious to their comrades' retreat. On the morning of 10 October 1912, the Evzones attacked the Turks, forcing them to retreat to Neochori. The two-day battle had cost the 1st Infantry Division 53 killed (5 officers and 48 enlisted) and 399 wounded (12 officers and 387 enlisted). =Second Balkan War= The 1st Infantry Division was ordered to the area between Lake Volvi and Lake Langada, east of Thessaloniki, at the outbreak of the Second Balkan War. On 19 June 1913, the division assaulted Bulgarian positions at Ossa, taking the town the same day. The assault cost the division 9 killed and 79 wounded. The following day, with the arrival of the 6th Infantry Division, which had just lost 530 men in the successful capture of the Dichalo-Klepe line, two divisions marched north to engage the Bulgarian Army, which had heavily entrenched itself around Lahanas. The 1st Infantry Division assaulted and captured Vertiskos, then joined its left flank with the 6th Division’s right, which had arrived from the west. The 1st Infantry Division attacking Bulgarian lines during the Battle of Lachanas, 1913 On 20 June 1913 the two divisions attacked the main Bulgarian defensive lines at Lachanas while encountering a heavy barrage from well-positioned Bulgarian artillery. The Bulgarians tenaciously defended their positions, repelling Greek attacks until night, when there was a break in the battle. On the morning of 21 June 1913, the 5th Infantry Regiment was ordered to detach and prepare to move to assist Greek forces engaged at Kilkis. The Bulgarians, observing the Greek 3/5 Battalion’s withdrawal, launched an attack on the 1/5 Battalion’s positions near the town of Kydonia, forcing it to retreat with heavy losses. The commander of the 5th Infantry Regiment, seeing the town fall, took personal command of the 2/5 Battalion and launched a successful counter-attack on the advancing Bulgarians. On the afternoon of 21 June 1913 the two Greek divisions, in coordination with artillery, launched an assault on the defensive lines of the Bulgarians, forcing their disorderly retreat towards the River Strymon. The 1st Infantry Division lost 11 officers and 180 enlisted soldiers killed in the engagement, including the commander of the 4th Infantry Regiment – Colonel Ioannis Papakyriazis. The wounded were 30 officers and 836 enlisted soldiers, with 211 missing in action. Soon after the battle, the 1st, along with the 6th and 7th divisions, were formed into an Army Section with the purpose of discovering and eliminating Bulgarian forces in the area around Sidirokastro. Commanded by Manousogiannakis, the section began its mission on 26 June 1913, fighting its way towards Sidirokastron and eventually taking the town. However, the Bulgarian 3rd Infantry Division managed to escape capture by retreating through the Rupel Pass. The two-day battle cost the 1st Division 4 killed, 75 wounded and 36 missing. Bulgarian forces regrouped at Kresna Gorge to avoid encirclement with orders to hold the line along Ruggen, Kresna and Pirin. Greek GHQ ordered four divisions, including the 1st, to find a way to break through the Bulgarian line. During the Battle of Kresna Gorge, the 1st Infantry Division managed to drive back the Bulgarian rear-guard and capture a foothold at the southern end of the Kresna pass. The Bulgarian 2nd and 4th Armies, recently arrived from the Serbian front, ambushed Greek forces but were soon beaten back. The 1st Division advanced towards the stronghold of Simitli, which it captured after a two-day battle and the loss of 42 killed and 349 wounded. =Post-Balkan Wars period and World War I= In August 1913, the division was subordinated to the newly formed I Army Corps at its peacetime garrison at Larissa. During the National Schism, the division was demobilized and effectively disbanded in 1916. In 1917, when Greece joined World War I on the side of the Entente Powers, the division was reconstituted as part of I Corps, and fought in the Macedonian Front. =Asia Minor Campaign= On the afternoon of 11 May 1919, the commander of the 1st Infantry Division, Colonel Nikolaos Zafeiriou, received orders to mobilize the division for deployment at the port of Kavala. As a component of the I Army Corps, the division consisted of the following units: *1/38 Evzone Regiment *4th Infantry Regiment *5th Infantry Regiment *a Cavalry half-company *1st and 2nd Squadrons from the 1st Field Artillery Regiment *Two Engineer Companies. On 15 May 1919, the division landed at Smyrna. The 1/38 Evzone Regiment was forced to land north of where it was to be stationed and had to march southward, past the Ottoman Konak and Turkish barracks. A shot was fired by Turkish journalist Hasan Tahsin, killing the Greek standard-bearer and resulting in the Greek troops attacking the Konak and barracks, whose troops surrendered and were subsequently escorted to a prison ship. The incident was the catalyst for an outbreak of violence and disorder in the city, which lasted for days. The first phase of the Asia Minor Campaign had begun. The 1st Infantry Division was soon ordered to occupy the Vilayet of Aydin in the Menderes River (Meander) valley (including the towns of Aydın, Manisa and Turgutlu). On 27 June 1919 a Greek patrol, from one of the two Greek regiments based at Aydın, was attacked by irregular Turkish forces of Yörük Ali Efe at Malgaç train station, south of the town. In retaliation, surrounding villages were burned by Greek detachments but they were soon repulsed and pushed back towards Aydin. Surrounded and under heavy attack by the Turks, Greek soldiers evacuated on 30 June 1919, allowing Yörük Ali's irregulars to take control of the town. With the help of reinforcements sent by General Nider, the Greeks recaptured Aydin on 4 July 1919. Most of the casualties in the Battle of Aydın were civilians, both Turkish and Greek, victims of atrocities by Greek soldiers and Turkish irregulars, respectively. Between March and June 1920 the 1st Division had moved to the northern edge of the Smyrna Zone in preparation for a major offensive on 10 June 1920. Units of the Greek I Army Corps began their attack on Turkish forces, the 1st Division advancing towards the Ovacik-Keles-Chaous Dag line. The offensive, which inflicted heavy losses on the Ottoman Army, saw Greek forces advance and secure the area as far east as Alaşehir. Less than a week after the Treaty of Sèvres, the Greek I Army Corps advanced to Uşak, with the 1st Division establishing its headquarters at Buladan. Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos was voted out of power on 1 November 1920, forcing his withdrawal from politics. With the recall of King Constantine I on 6 December 1920 by a plebiscite, the anti-Venizelists took the opportunity to dismiss many experienced, yet pro-Venizelist, officers from their commands in Asia Minor, replacing them with inexperienced, but politically reliable, officers. =Greco-Italian War= Following the Italian invasion of Greece from Albania on 28 October 1940, the 1st Division, under Major General Vasileios Vrachnos, was one of the first Greek units sent to confront the invasion. The division played a crucial role in the Battle of Pindus, defeating the elite 3rd Alpine Division Julia, and again during the repulsion of the Italian Spring Offensive of March 1941, at the Battle of Hill 731. After the German invasion of Greece and the capitulation of the Greek army, the division was disbanded. =Post- war period= The 1st Division was reconstituted at Lamia in March 1948, and took part in the operations of the final year of the Greek Civil War. Between 1950 and 1954, it was moved to Konitsa, Tyrnavos, and Katerini, before being disbanded and converted to a reserve cadre formation, based at Larissa and later at Volos. The division was mobilized in 1974, during the crisis around the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, and placed under the command of II Army Corps, moving its headquarters to Giannitsa. On 4 March 1998, the division was converted to an operational headquarters for II Corps, moving on 30 June 2003 to Agia Varvara, Imathia. Greek IFOR soldiers safeguarding elections in Bosnia, 1996 In the 1990s and 2000s, the 1st Division oversaw the training and deployment of Greek peacekeeping forces in the Balkans: in Bosnia (IFOR–SFOR), Albania during the Albanian Civil War of 1997 (Operation Alba), and Afghanistan (ISAF). Following a major reorganization of the Hellenic Army in 2013, the division moved to Veroia and took over most of the operational responsibilities of II Corps, which was disbanded, and took under its command the Army's special forces, marines, and air-mobile forces. As a result, 1st Division has no specific geographic area of responsibility, but is an elite intervention force under the operational control of the Chief of the Hellenic National Defence General Staff. The division continues to be responsible for many of the Hellenic Army's international obligations: the 71st Airmobile Brigade, the 1st Army Aviation Brigade, and II Raider Squadron form part of the NATO Response Force under NRDC-GR headquarters, while the 71st Airmobile Brigade participates in the Balkan Battlegroup, and the 32nd Marines Brigade in the Spanish–Italian Amphibious Battlegroup.

History The fort was established in the 18th Century and substantially modernised in the late 19th – early 20th century with the installation of 12 inch guns in concrete casemates. There is an outlying fort called Seraya Loshad (Grey Horse) containing smaller guns. The fort was armed with: * 8 11 inch howitzers * 8 10 inch guns * 6 6 inch Canet type guns * 4 12 inch guns in concrete casemates * 4 12 inch guns in armoured turrets The work was completed in 1914. During the Russian Civil War the fort helped defend the city of Petrograd. In June 1919 the garrison mutinied against the Bolshevik regime but the revolt was suppressed. Though the Estonian Army and the British Royal Navy actively supported the White Russian Northern Corps in the area their attacks were not able to aid the mutineers. Later in autumn 1919 the forts were unsuccessfully attacked by the 1st Division of the Estonian Army, supported by bombardment by HMS Erebus.Jaan Maide (1933) Ülevaade Eesti vabadussõjast Kaitseliit publishers, Tartu In 1921 the guns of the fort bombarded Kronstadt during the rebellion. During World War II the fort played a vital part in defending the Siege of Leningrad and maintaining the Oranienbaum Bridgehead. The fort was decommissioned in 1960 and partially demolished.

Historically South Petherton was a market town, but these days is regarded to be a small town with many of its ancient functions having ended by around 1870.South Petherton Village History (South Petherton History Society) History The village's name may come from the Old English word Pared meaning boundary and the Saxon word ton meaning settlement, forming ’Paredton’. A site on Lightgate Road, north of the present village, has produced Iron Age occupation material, though archaeological evidence of any structures have not yet been discovered. Roman material, mostly consisting of coins, has also been discovered locally and, as it is only from the Fosse Way, Roman occupation is likely, although it may have been abandoned between the 4th and 8th centuries. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle of 680 refers to a major battle on the site of the village and the Saxon Ine of Wessex of the Kingdom of Wessex built a palace on present day Silver Street. A large royal estate of South Petherton was created and the Saxon settlement, Sudperetone (the southern tun on the Parrett), included a minster church, a royal palace and a short-lived 11th century mint. Most of the royal estate passed directly to William the Conqueror and was still a possession of the Crown in 1086. The parish was part of the South Petherton Hundred. Part of the estate was also held by Bruton Abbey from the 12th century until the Dissolution of the Monasteries, then becoming known as the manor of Hele. In 1213 a royal warrant by King John was granted for a market and fair, but by 1243 the main manor had been granted away from the Crown under Henry II and by 1243 South Petherton manor was owned outright by the Daubeney family, who continued to hold it until the late 15th century, the family dying out after Henry Daubeney acquired the earldom of Bridgwater and then failed to produce an heir to succeed him. The manor reverted to the Crown in 1553, before passing into the ownership of Charles Arundell (d. 1587), who left it to his brother Matthew Arundell, in whose family it remained until 1792, when it was sold to John Baker Edmonds. Edmonds also acquired the rectory estate of South Petherton (known also as the manor of Hele), which had had a complicated history of ownership, including purchase in 1753 by Henry Hele, a successful physician from Salisbury.\\"Parishes: South Petherton\\", Victoria County History, A History of the County of Somerset, Volume 4 (1978), at pages 170-198 Another estate (known as the Manor of Wigborough) was shared by members of the Brome Family from 1581 to 1615, when it passed to the family of Hele of Flete (unconnected to the Henry Hele referred to above) who held it for most of the 17th century. During the English Civil War troops from both sides occupied the town during 1644 and 1645. The town also had a role in the Monmouth rebellion of 1680 and two townsmen were among those who prosecuted in the Bloody Assizes. It was also recently discovered that South Petherton was, during the 17th century, one of the main centres of bronze cauldron and skillet production. These cooking vessels were used all over the UK. Governance As a civil parish, South Petherton has its own parish council with responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village is part of the South Somerset local government district within the wider Somerset County Council. Yeovil is a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. The constituency covers the towns of Yeovil, Chard, Crewkerne and Ilminster in Somerset. The current MP is Marcus Fysh, a member of the Conservative Party. An electoral ward in the same name exists. Although South Petherton is the most populous area the ward stretches to Shepton Beauchamp and Seavington St. Mary. The total ward population at the 2011 census was 4,866. Residents of South Petherton also form part of the electorate for the South West England constituency for elections to the European Parliament. Geography South Petherton is situated between the Devon hills to the west, the flat wetland area of the Somerset Levels and Moors to the north, and the hills of Dorset to the south. It lies on low lying undulating land of Yeovil Sands at the foot of a limestone ridge, which has been quarried for Petherton stone, and for sands and clays suitable for brick and tile making. =Climate= Along with the rest of South West England, South Petherton has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west. Economy Agriculture has traditionally been an important local industry, although South Petherton has also been a centre for glove making, cider production and other cottage industries at various points in its history. Cloth manufacture, continued into the late 18th and 19th century although this was largely replaced by sailcloth and then leather working. The importance of this industry can be seen by the number of mills which remain including; the former flax mill or granary in Hayes End, Joylers Mill, Shutlers Mill, and the former flax mill immediately north of Flaxdrayton Farmhouse. Landmarks Wigborough Manor House The David Hall In Silver Street is a 14th-century manor house. It was restored in the 19th century and nicknamed 'King Ina's Palace'. The 15th or 16th century Wigborough Manor House was never completed to its original plans and has subsequently been modified many times. Approximately from South Petherton is East Lambrook Manor Gardens created by Margery Fish who was known as the 'Leading Lady of Gardening' from the 1950s until her death in 1969. It holds the national collection of geraniums, and a collection of snowdrops. The \\"David Hall\\" (located in the old United Reformed Church) is a local social centre run by the Petherton Arts Trust, a non-profit making organisation formed in 1986 and registered as a charity in 1990. There is also the \\"Blake Hall\\" which has a social club downstairs and a hall upstairs where a market is held on the first Sunday of every month, as well as various other activities. Health and Education During 2007 Somerset Primary Care Trust consulted local residents about proposals for the redevelopment of South Petherton Community Hospital, which provides Out Patient Assessment and Reablement services. In March 2012, the new hospital was opened by Sophie, Countess of Wessex.http://www.thisisthewestcountry.co.uk/news/9593677.The_Countess_of_Wessex_to_visit_South_Petherton_hospital_next_week/ Education is provided within the village by two nurseries for pre-school children, an infants’ school (ages 5–7) and a junior school (ages 7–11). The nearest secondary schools are in Stoke-sub-Hamdon (Stanchester Community School), Crewkerne (Wadham) and Huish Episcopi (Huish Episcopi School). Transport South Petherton is located close to the A303 main road, and the nearest railway stations are in Crewkerne and Yeovil. Formerly there were closer stations at Martock and Ilminster, but both of these were closed in the 1960s. Religious sites The Church of England Church of St Peter and St Paul has Saxon origins. It retains a 13th-century crosswing, with the remainder of the buildings dating from the 15th century, however it underwent major restorations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. The tower is an irregular octagon on plan, wider on east-west axis, which is believed to be the tallest octagonal church tower in the UK. It houses a ring of twelve bells. Methodist Church The Coke Memorial Methodist Church was built in 1881–82 to replace an earlier chapel of 1809. It was named after Thomas Coke, who was curate of the village 1772-76 and important, along with John Wesley, amongst the founders of Methodism. A United Reformed Church was built in 1863. This is now the 'David Hall' and hosts various public events. Sports The South Petherton Walking Group is aimed at the over 50's and aims to encourage this healthy, social activity amongst residents and visitors. The Recreation Ground provides pitches for football and cricket clubs and there are also facilities for tennis and bowls and a children’s play area. The football pitch is particularly large for the standard of football that the club compete in, being over 120 yards long and 90 yards wide. South Petherton Football Club were relegated from the Premier Division of the Perry Street & District League in 2013 after a highly successful run in recent years, but gained promotion at the first attempt and have since competed well back in the premier division.

Bajaj auto alleged that TVS had copied its patented DTSi (digital twin spark ignition) technology in the new bike. TVS clarified that TVS FLAME used a three-valve engine based on CCVTi (Controlled Combustion Variable Timing Intelligent) technology. TVS further filed a Rupees 250 Crore defamation suit against Bajaj Auto in the Madras High court to counter Baja’s patent infringement suit.

The Bulgarians were victorious and captured the city.  Prelude  After the youngest of the three Asen brothers, Kaloyan, was crowned Emperor in early 1197 he immediately showed his resolution to continue the war with the Byzantines by all means and liberate all Bulgarian lands. In the next year Kaloyan even allied with Ivanko, the murderer of his eldest brother, Ivan Asen.  The siege  At the turn of the new century he seized the strong castle of Constancia (near modern Simeonovgrad) and then struck in the opposite direction and besieged the last Byzantine stronghold to the north of the Balkan mountains, Varna. Varna was defended by a large garrison including western mercenaries who were known to be the bravest soldiers in the Byzantine army.Andreev, J. The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars (Balgarskite hanove i tsare, Българските ханове и царе), Veliko Tarnovo, 1996, p. 161 To take the fortress the Bulgarian engineers constructed an enormous siege tower which was wider that the outer moat. With the help of the siege equipment the Bulgarian army was able to cross the moat and reach the walls of the city and on the third day of the siege, on 24 March 1201 the Bulgarians made a breakthrough. According to the Byzantine historian Nikitas Choniates Kaloyan did not hesitate to kill all defenders despite the fact that it was Easter. The Byzantines were thrown in the moat and buried alive. After that he destroyed the city walls and returned to the capital Tarnovo.  Aftermath  By the end of the year Bulgaria and Byzantium started negotiation which ended with a peace treaty in the beginning of 1202. The Bulgarians secured their new gains and now were able to face the Hungarian threat to the north-west. After several battle in the valley of the Morava river, the Hungarians were defeated.

It is usually a small tree with an open canopy, papery bark and spikes of cream, yellow, green or red flowers. Description Melaleuca viridiflora is a shrub or small tree usually growing to tall, sometimes twice that height, with white, brownish or grey bark and an open canopy. Its leaves are long, wide, thick, broadly elliptic and aromatic. The flowers are cream, yellow, yellow-green or occasionally red and arranged in spikes on the ends of branch which continue to grow after flowering and sometimes also in the upper leaf axils. Each spike contains 8 to 25 groups of flowers in threes and is up to long and in diameter. The petals are long and fall off as the flower matures. There are five bundles of stamens around the flower, each with 6 or 9 stamens although the stamens are only weakly joined in bundles. Flowering can occur at any time of the year but most commonly happens in winter. Flowering is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long, scattered along the stem, each containing numerous fine seeds. Yellow-green form of M. viridiflora Red-flowered form of M. viridiflora Foliage and capsules of M. viridiflora M. viridflora bark Distribution map of M. viridiflora Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca viridiflora was first formally described in 1788 by Daniel Solander, the description published by Joseph Gaertner in De fructibus et seminibus plantarum including a carefully drawn figure of the stamen bundle and fruiting capsules. The description was made during the forced stay of the Endeavour on the banks of the Endeavour River, at the site of the present-day Cooktown, during the first voyage of James Cook. The specific epithet (viridiflora) is from the Latin viridis meaning \\"green\\" and flos meaning \\"flower\\" referring to the most common flower colour of this species. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs in tropical areas of Australia, including as far south as Maryborough in Queensland, northern parts of Western Australia south to the Dampier Peninsula district, and the northern half of the Northern Territory. It is also found in the southern part of West Papua in Indonesia and southern Papua New Guinea It grows on the margins of gallery forest, in forest, woodland and swampy plains in a variety of soils. Ecology Melaleuca viridiflora forests provide habitat for orchid species including the rare, threatened or endangered Calochilus psednus, Pachystoma pubescens, Eulophia bicallosa and Cardwell midge orchid (Genoplesium tectum). Individual trees often host the epiphytic ant-house plant, (Myrmecodia beccarii). Plants distributed in south-eastern Florida in 1900 under the name Melaleuca viridiflora have been subsequently identified as Melaleuca quinquenervia. Uses=Traditional uses= Melaleuca viridiflora is used by Aboriginal Australians for multiple uses. The bark is peeled off in layers and is used for shelter, bedding, containers, storing and cooking food, fire tinder, watercraft, fish traps and wrapping corpses. In traditional medicine, an infusion from leaves was drunk, inhaled or used for bathing to treat coughs, colds, congestion, headache, fever and influenza.Brock, J., Top End Native Plants, 1988. =Essential oils= Different populations of this species yield different oils but there are two distinct groups. One is rich in terpenic oil but otherwise highly variable with three distinct chemotypes. Another population is rich in methyl cinnamate with two chemotypes. =Horticulture= Melaleuca viridiflora is a useful and adaptable small tree in cultivation, with the red-flowered form being preferred. It is suitable for tropical and subtropical areas where there is high summer rainfall, especially in heavy clay soils. Its open canopy makes it a useful host tree for epiphytes such as Dendrobium.

History =First World War= No. 58 Squadron was first formed at Cramlington, Northumberland, on 8 June 1916 as a squadron of the Royal Flying Corps from a nucleus split off from the Home defence 36 Squadron, equipped with Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c and B.E.2e aircraft and serving as an advanced training unit. The squadron converted to Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2bs in the night bombing role at Dover in December 1917 and prepared for deployment overseas, moving to France on 10 January 1918, and flying its first operational mission, a bombing attack on an airfield at Rumbeke on the night of 2/3 February 1918. The squadron attacked German road and railway targets during the German Spring Offensive in March–April 1918 to disrupt the German advance. In August 1918, the squadron flew nightbombing missions in support of the Allied offensive at the Second Battle of Bapaume. In September 1918 the squadron replaced its F.E.2s with the much larger twin-engine Handley Page O/400, although its airfield at Alquines was not ideal for the large bomber, having poor operating surfaces and awkward approaches. It flew its first mission with the O/400 on the night of 20–21 September, and discarded its last F.E.2s on 3 October. By the end of the First World War the squadron had dropped 247 tons of bombs and fired over 400,000 rounds of ammunition while strafing ground targets. In 1919 the squadron moved to Egypt, with the move completed by 2 July. It started to reequip with Vickers Vimy bombers, but was renumbered as No. 70 Squadron before it disposed of all its O/400s. =Between the wars= 58 Squadron was reformed on 1 April 1924 as a heavy bomber unit equipped with the Vimy at RAF Worthy Down on training duties. From December 1924, it replaced its Vimys with Vickers Virginia bombers and in 1925 it was commanded by Squadron Leader Arthur Harris, later Air Marshal \\"Bomber\\" Harris. The squadron, still equipped with the Virginia, moved to RAF Upper Heyford on 13 January 1936 and to RAF Driffield on 31 August that year. Steps finally began to be taken to replace its obsolete Virginia biplanes in February 1937 when it received a few Avro Ansons to prepare its crews for more modern monoplanes with retractable undercarriages. It moved to RAF Boscombe Down on 24 March 1937 and began to re-equip with Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys in October that year (although shortages of Whitleys resulted in it temporarily receiving a few Handley Page Heyfords in April 1939. =Second World War= Armourers prepare 500-lb GP bombs for Armstrong Whitworth Whitley of 58 Squadron at RAF Linton-on-Ouse At the start of the Second World War 58 Squadron was based at RAF Linton-on-Ouse flying Whitley bombers as part of No. 4 Group RAF in RAF Bomber Command, flying its first mission of the war, a leaflet raid on the Ruhr, on the night of 3/4 September 1939. From October 1939 until February 1940 it was based at RAF Boscombe Down attached to Coastal Command carrying out convoy escort patrols. The squadron then returned in February 1940 to Linton-on-Ouse as part of Bomber Command and remained there for the next two years, undertaking its first bombing raid on the night of 18/19 April 1940, when three Whitleys set out to attack Fornebu airfield, Oslo, with one aborting and two attacking the target. In April 1942, the squadron transferred to Coastal Command. The squadron flew a total of 1,757 sorties in 227 operations (219 bombing raids and 8 leaflet raids) during its time in Bomber Command, losing 49 aircraft on operations. The squadron was based at RAF St Eval and flew anti-submarine patrols over the Western Approaches as part of No. 19 Group RAF. On 23 June 1942, a Whitley of 58 Squadron attacked the German submarine in the Bay of Biscay, badly damaging the submarine. At the end of August 1942 the squadron moved to RAF Stornoway in the Western Isles. On 15 September 1942 a 58 Squadron Whitley sank the German submarine near the Rosemary Bankwest of Scotland. In December 1942, the squadron moved to RAF Holmsley South in Hampshire, converting to the Handley Page Halifax in January 1943. On 11 May 1943, a Halifax of 58 Squadron spotted the German submarine in the Bay of Biscay and attacked with depth-charges. The submarine was subsequently attacked by the sloop and sunk, with the Halifax and Fleetwood being jointly credited with sinking the U-Boat. On 15 May another 58 Squadron Halifax caught a U-Boat on the surface in the Bay of Biscay, sinking . In October 1944 the squadron switched from anti-submarine duties to anti-shipping duties, carrying out attacks on German shipping off the coast of Norway. It was disbanded on 25 May 1945. =Post-war operations= 58 Squadron Canberra PR.7 at RAF Finningley in 1969. It wears the Squadron's Owl symbol on its fin tip. In October 1946, No. 58 Squadron reformed at RAF Benson in the photo-reconnaissance role, mainly operating Mosquitoes. In March 1953, the squadron moved to RAF Wyton operating Mosquitos. Late in 1953 the squadron was re-equipped with the English Electric Canberra PR.3. In 1953/54, the Canberras made a record breaking flight from Wyton to New Zealand via Egypt, India & Singapore, completing the journey in 24 hours. Two aircraft also made the trip to USA for the 50th anniversary celebration of the Wright brother's flight. These were replaced by Canberra PR.7s in 1955 which took part in the Operation Grapple hydrogen bomb tests at Christmas Island in the Pacific, and also were deployed to British Honduras to face a threat by Guatemala to overfly the country during an official visit by Princess Margaret. During the Suez Crisis, No. 58 Squadron forward deployed to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus. On 6 November 1956, Canberra PR.7 WH799 departed from Akrotiri to overfly Syria to assess the build up of Soviet equipment in the country. While over Syria, WH799 was intercepted and was shot down by a Syrian Air Force Gloster Meteor, killing the navigator while the pilots ejected and safely landed in Lebanon. The squadron disbanded on 30 September 1970. It was lastly reformed at RAF Wittering in 1973 as a ground-attack training unit equipped with Hawker Hunters before being finally disbanded in 1976.

It is performed by the protagonist, Rusty, a young steam locomotive and his true love, the observation car, Pearl.  Overview  \\"Only You\\" is the second version of the show-stopping love song at the key moment in Starlight Express. In the Original London production, Pearl sang a solo \\"Only He\\", a passionate power ballad originally performed by Stephanie Lawrence. At the end of this solo Rusty came to find Pearl, and together they sang a very short reprise of the song, \\"Only You\\". \\"Only He\\" proved to be a highly demanding song, coming shortly after the performers have raced at up to 30mph on roller skates, and it was found this song in this context was too demanding for most performers to sing. \\"Only You\\" is essentially Pearl's solo \\"Only He\\", as opposed to the reprise version in the original, re-arranged as a duet between Pearl and Rusty, with the most demanding octave leap passages removed. It replaced \\"Only He\\" in London in 1987. This simplified duet version was used in all productions from Broadway until the 1992 London re-vamp. This version is in nature sweet and reflective, less of a show-stopper but more in keeping with the character's journeys. Only You was, in turn, replaced by \\"Next Time You Fall in Love\\", a new song written as part of the 1992 London production revamp, then used in following productions. \\"Next Time\\" is a re-working of Lloyd Webber's song \\"The Ballad of Billy Macaw\\" from Cats. Musically it is near identical, with replacement lyrics by Don Black. The lyrics of \\"Next Time\\" make very little sense within the context of the show, however at the time it was released as a chart single. \\"Next time\\" was added to the German production in 2003, replacing \\"Du Allein\\" (direct translation of \\"Only You\\"). The German lyrics resolved the issue of lacking context, the song was titled \\"Allein im Licht der Sterne\\" (Alone, in the Starlight). At the same time the 2003 US Tour replaced \\"Next Time\\" with the second version of \\"Only He\\", a duet version that included the octave leaps from the original song, in a very rich, dramatic arrangement, aided by the use of pre-recorded instrumentation. This version has now found its way to the 2009 New Zealand tour. In 2008 the second version of \\"Only He\\" was included in the German production, now titled \\"Nur Mit Ihm\\" (Only with Him) to distinguish from the earlier \\"Du Allein\\". Pearl singing 'Only He' in the London Production. = Context = Rusty's journey through the story of Starlight Express shows him, in his darkest hour, calling to the Starlight Express for help. The Starlight Express answers telling him \\"Only You have the power within you...\\". Rusty gains belief in himself, and goes on to race in the final. During the race, Pearl, who is racing with Greaseball, is injured by Electra and disconnected at full speed. She is sure to crash when Rusty leaves the race to rescue her. He then goes on to win the race, but has lost Pearl. He wants to declare his love openly to her, but first he must find her. Meanwhile, Pearl, injured and alone far from the finish line, realises how she has been blind to her own love for the little Steam Train who would do anything for her. Only He actually cares for her, the other engines left her to die. The song is used for the moment when Pearl realises that Rusty is her true love, and when Rusty reiterates for the umpteenth time his love for her.  Music  The music was composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The key is dependent on the production;, in London it was D major (Only he was in C Major); Germany, A major, later B major; Broadway, C Major; Australia/Japan, A major; and in the UK tour B Major. It later transposes up a tone twice in all versions but London. The tune is also used in the 'Starlight Sequence', along with the Starlight Express theme. The \\"Only You\\" theme represents discovery; of Rusty's self belief, of Pearl's love. Underneath the tune is a very simple chord sequence. Variations on the sequence have been used within songs such as Our Last Summer by ABBA, Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft by Klaatu, Don't Walk Away from Xanadu and Easy Like Sunday Morning by Lionel Richie (similar to 'Poppa's Blues', which uses a traditional blues chord sequence and bassline). The sequence (in Roman Numerals) is as follows; ::::::I – III – IV – V – I – III – IV – V – III – VI – II – IV – V – I Lyrics The Lyrics for \\"Only He\\" and \\"Only You\\" are by Richard Stilgoe. The commonly known opening verse of \\"Only He\\" – \\"look at me, a woman, calm and in control/ No silly girl whose head's always turning\\" is in fact from the single release version of the song, and are obviously out of context when sung by Pearl, who is exactly a silly girl whose head is turned by each attractive male that passes her. The stage production used significantly different lyrics, more appropriate to the context: \\"known him for a lifetime, known him not at all/ Thought there was nothing special about him\\". \\"Only You\\" cuts this first verse, Pearl starting at the chorus \\"Only You/ have the power to move me\\" The second version of \\"Only He\\" has lyrics re- worked from the original. The alterations are not credited to David Yazbek, who worked on re-vamping the show for the 2003 US tour. The lyrics are predominantly Richard Stilgoe's original work altered slightly, but include lyrics such as Rusty's singing \\"You are my Starlight\\" to Pearl. Earlier on, Rusty looked for 'the Starlight Express'. For romantic purposes of this number, he suggests that Pearl is 'his Starlight', 'Starlight' being a metaphor of Rusty's motivation. Obviously he cannot mean it literally, as the Starlight Express, heard onstage a few scenes previously, was definitely not Pearl! The most glaring contextual nonsensities in the show have appeared at this point in the plot, including Don Black's \\"Back then was when we touched the Starlight\\". Rusty and Pearl have a minimal relationship at the beginning of the show, they have no significant past other than a tentative agreement to race together. And while (in the London staging) Rusty did touch the Starlight Express, Pearl was clearly not with him. = Spoken Lines = This song is one of the few from Starlight Express to have spoken lines, acting as a bridge passage in the music between Rusty's first verse and the first chorus sung as a duet: ;;Rusty: Pearl, I had to find you. Are you okay? ;;Pearl: Rusty, I'm fine thanks to you. But I made you lose the race! ;;Rusty: No, you didn't make me lose, you made me win! ;;Pearl: You won? ;;Rusty: We won! Come on...  Choreography/Blocking  Choreography and blocking is, of course, entirely dependent on production and the capabilities of the set. In London, as the other characters cleared the stage to follow Poppa looking for Rusty and Pearl, a scene change was suggested by Pearl, sat on a railway buffer, pushed onstage behind them. From this perch she started singing. As the passion in the song built, she stood and skated around. In other productions without mobile set pieces, Pearl kneels to start her song. At Rusty's entrance, Pearl turns away from him, she can't immediately face him from shame at how she's hurt him. But the spoken lines give her the confidence to turn to face him, and to skate with him, before finishing with their fisted hands touching, to show that they are 'coupled'.

It was originally formed as the 39th Guards Rifle Division of the Workers and Peasant's Red Army. It was formed during the German-Soviet War as part of the 62nd Army and assigned to the defense of Stalingrad, officially arriving in the theater in August 1942. In September the division fought through German forces which were attempting to encircle the city, and was assigned to defend the 'Volga Corridor,' the last supply line remaining for Soviet units in the city.  Defense of the Red October Steel Works  Soviet troops in the ruins of the Red October Steel Factory, October 1942 From September 30, 1942, the division, which could muster only roughly half its original strength, was assigned to defend the Red October steel works. From that date until February 2, 1943, the division was involved in almost constant combat with numerically superior German forces. On October 14, 1942, the 39th repulsed a major German counterattack involving three Infantry divisions, two Panzer divisions, and 3,000 combat sorties by the Luftwaffe. For five months the 39th Guards maintained their tenuous hold on the Red October factory, holding an area only 3000 yards wide and 1000 yards in depth. Along with similar pockets at the Dzerzhinsky tractor factory and the Barrikady gun factory, Red October represented one of the last viable defensive positions on the west bank of the Volga River. Soviet troops fought major battles from building to building and room to room, with success often measured in mere yards. As the Germans desperately tried to eliminate these pockets they poured more and more troops into the city, weakening their flanks and wasting men and materiel in what was becoming a meat-grinder for the Wehrmacht. These factors contributed directly the successes of the Soviet counter-offensives of November and December (see Operation Uranus and Operation Saturn), and the subsequent encirclement and eventual surrender of Gen. Friedrich Paulus's 6th Army.  Refit and Ukraine, 1943  Combat path of the 39th Guards Rifle Division Following the victory at Stalingrad the remnants of the 62nd Army, including the 39th Guards, was placed in reserve and became the basis for the newly formed 8th Guards Army, receiving the honorific 'Guards' in honor of their heroic defense of Stalingrad. The army remained under the command of Lieutenant General Vasily Chuikov, its commander in Stalingrad. Through 1943 the 8th Guards Army fought across Ukraine, crossing the North Donets River, establishing a bridgehead south of Isyum, and in cooperation with adjacent armies, advanced on the Don Basin and ultimately liberated it. They fought across the Don, through Dnepropetrovsk, continuing to Zaporozhe, and participated in the fighting on the Zaporozhe bridgehead across the Dnepr on October 10–14.  1944  The division turned south and fought for the liberation of Nikolayev in March 1944, and liberated Odessa in April. Turning north into Moldavia the division liberated Kovel before participating in the Lovov-Sandomir Operation, which began on July 13 and lasted until August 29. On July 20, they crossed the Bug River and crossed into Poland. On July 24, the 39th Guards liberated Lublin and continued to advance on Warsaw, establishing a major bridgehead on the Vistula River which was the key for the Soviet advance towards Silesia, central Poland and the German border. They encountered furious counterattacks by German units, with the 8th Army losing 17,000 men in the process.  1945 and the Battle of Berlin  On January 12, the 39th Guards participated in the Vistula-Oder Offensive, which lasted 23 days and saw the division advance 500 km through Poland. They crushed the German defenders (including the elite \\"Großdeutschland Division\\") as they liberated the towns of Lodz and Posnan, finally arriving at the Oder River just north of Frankfurt on February 3. They stormed the Kustrin Fortress and established a bridgehead over the Oder, within 60 km of Berlin. They attacked the city from the east, pushing through the area of Karlshorst, across Tempelhof Airport and Landwehr Canal, destroying the 11th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Nordland and then the 17th Panzer Division just south of the Reichstag. The 39th Guards Rifle Division pushed north and fought through the Tiergarten, ending their war along Charlottenburger Chaussee at the Brandenburg Gate, meeting units from the 207th and 150th Rifle Divisions just 250 yards from the Reichstag. The final banner of the division, which had served from the center of Stalingrad to the center of Berlin, read: \\"39th Barvenkovskikh Guards Order of Lenin, Twice Order of the Red Banner, Order of Suvorov Second Class and Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky Second Class Rifle Division.\\"  Cold War Service  Parade of divisional soldiers, 1968 Along with the rest of the 8th Guards Army, from 1949 the division was stationed in Ohrdruf, Gotha and Meiningen, East Germany (the GDR).Burg Ohrdruf - Historisches and book \\"100 Jahre Truppenübungsplatz Ohrdruf. 1906-2006 \\", Germany, 2006, and / print.php? nid = 8491 A Brief History of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany.

At different times (up to the 1980s), some regiments and separate battalions changed their garrison and placed in other cities of Thuringia - Arnstadt and Saalfeld. It was opposite the strategically vital Fulda Gap, and the U.S. V and VII US Corps in NATO's Central Army Group. The distance from the locations of parts of the division to the state border with Germany was about 5 kilometers. Withdrawal from Germany began about October 28, 1991.

He rose to become maréchal de camp, hero of the Battle of Rocoux and governor of Les Invalides. Military career De Virot was appointed as a second lieutenant in the régiment de Montmorin on 16 July 1735. Commissioning and promotion by purchase was common practice in the pre-revolutionary Royal Army. He reached the rank of captain on 20 May 1745 and that of lieutenant colonel of the régiment Royal-Corse in 1758. After distinguishing himself in the field and holding various garrison commands in peace-time France, de Virot was appointed governor of the Invalides in Paris on 16 December 1786. While his command consisted only of veteran pensioners no longer considered suitable for active military service, de Virot was also responsible for the safeguarding of large stocks of weapons stored in the building complex. French Revolution On 14 July 1789, widespread disturbances in Paris led to the seizure of the Hotel de Invalides and the Storming of the Bastille. Demands had been made to Sombreuil by the newly organised electors militia for the handing over of the thirty thousand muskets stored in the cellars of the Invalides. The governor delayed by responding that he would need approval from Versailles; while ordering his unenthusiastic pensioners to begin to disable the weapons held.Simon Schama, p. 388 Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution, Unlike Bernard-René Jourdan de Launay, the governor of the Bastille, Sombreuil subsequently accepted the revolutionaries' demands to surrender his garrison without attempting armed resistance. He thereby avoided the fate of de Launay, who was seized and killed by the mob.Hampson, Norman, 1963. A social history of the French Revolution. P.74-75 Sombreuil was promoted to lieutenant-general, in what was still nominally the Royal Army, on May 20 1791. He participated in the defence of the Tuileries Palace on August 10 1792, when the monarchy was finally overthrown. Imprisoned in the Abbey Prison six days later, he survived the September massacres, before being moved to two other prisons between December 1793 and May 1794. His daughter Mademoiselle Marie-Maurille de Sombreuil (born 1768) had demanded to be imprisoned with him. Sombreuil was finally sentenced to death on 29 Prairial Year II (June 17, 1794) by the Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris under Fouquier-Tinville. The charges against him included that of being an accomplice in a planned prison uprising and of conspiring to assassinate Collot d'Herbois, a representative of the people. =Execution= Together with his son Stanislas, Sombreuil was guillotined at the Place du Trône Renversé on 17 June 1794. Because of the d'Herbois charge, the general was obliged to wear a red blouse marking him as an accused would-be parricide. The bodies of the two Sombreuils were amongst fifty-three victims of the guillotine buried in a mass grave in what is now the Picpus Cemetery. =Fate of family= His youngest son Charles Eugène Gabriel de Sombreuil was one of the commanders of an emigre counter-revolutionary force that made an abortive landing at Quibero in 1795. Charles was amongst 750 royalists prisoners subsequently executed by firing squad on 28 July, at the orders of Lazare Hoche.

He attended the 1840 conference on Anti-Slavery in London where he made a stand against the exclusion of female delegates. In 1843 he was with Frederick Douglass on a lecture tour in Indiana when they were attacked. Lydia Maria Child wrote with regard to his work on anti-slavery that he had \\" a high place among the tried and true.\\" Biography Bradburn was born March 4, 1806 to James and Sarah Bradburn in Attleboro, a small town in Massachusetts. After his mother died, he was brought up by his half sister Fanny. He first took a trade as a machinist until he decided to pursue further studies at the age on nineteen. He continued his education at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire. After studying with Hosea Ballou (the 2nd) he attended the Harvard Divinity School. His first ministerial position was in Nantucket in 1831, but oddly, his church was sold while he was away and his congregation was later disbanded in 1834. While in Nantucket he met and married his first wife, Lydia, but within a year of marriage she had died, and his only daughter died a year later. This cast a \\"shadow over his whole life.\\" Moreover, Bradburn had begun to lose his sense of hearing. However, he was well regarded and was elected by the Whigs to serve as the Massachusetts Legislature in 1839 for three years.Letters of Lysader Spooner , accessed July 20, 2008 He became associated with the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1839 and he brought forward related radical legislation. He led a movement which repealed a marriage law. After this change, \\"People in Massachusetts, wishing to marry, are under no necessity of comparing complexions\\" in 1842. =The year of the \\"World's Convention\\"= In 1840, a woman's right to serve on an American anti-slavery committee was established when Abby Kelley became a full member of the business committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society at their annual convention. This was not without cost, and some of the members left the meeting, but others who were known as the \\"Garrisonian wing\\" believed in equal rights of all Americans, irrespective of gender. So when an invitation was received for the World Anti-Slavery Convention on June 12, 1840 in London, it was not surprising that Massachusetts decided to not only send William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips and Bradburn, but also Lydia Maria Child, Harriet Martineau and Maria Weston Chapman. Bradburn travelled first class on the ship Roscoe on the May 7, 1840. Other anti-slavery delegates aboard the ship were James and Lucretia Mott, Emily Winslow and her father Isaac, Abby South, Henry Grew his daughter Mary Grew and Elizabeth Neall.Mary Grew, Abolitionist and Feminist, 1813-1896, accessed July 19, 2008 After they arrived many took the opportunity to tour England. Bradburn was able to visit various places including Blenheim Palace, Eaton Hall, Stratford on Avon, Oxford University and Warwick Castle. He was later able to call on these experiences in lectures later in life. Just before the World's Anti-Slavery Convention opened, the British organiser Joseph Sturge explained that female delegates would not be allowed. This \\"insane innovation, this woman-intruding delusion,\\" was rebuked by the leading English Anti-Slavery members. Some of the male delegates from America sided with the women, including George Bradburn, Wendell Phillips, James Mott, William Adam, Isaac Winslow, J. P. Miller and Henry B. Stanton. William Lloyd Garrison, who was not there until the 17th, refused to take his seat until there was equality in seating.Massachusetts in the woman suffrage movement.

Not only was the equality of the sexes debated, but Bradburn said that \\"introducing any such words as 'Christian,' 'Religious,' and the like, by which persons of any religion whatever, or of no religion whatever, should be excluded from the Anti-Slavery platform. The Collected Works of Lysander Spooner, by Charles Shively, © 1971 by M&S; Press, accessed July 19, 2008 The portrait of Bradburn which is shown at the top of this article and in Haydon's picture of the 1840 World Anti-Slavery conventionThe Anti-Slavery Society Convention, 1840, Benjamin Robert Haydon, 1841, National Portrait Gallery, London, NPG599, Given by British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society in 1880 was completed in a small room at the Freemasons hall where the convention was held. Bradburn commented that he felt that he had been given \\"too much severity or sharpness,\\" but Haydon assured him that he looked \\"revolutionary\\" when giving his speeches. Bradburn made time after a visit to France to complete a third sitting on August 3, 1840. Bradburn then visited Newcastle, Scotland and Ireland, visiting people he had met at the convention including the Irish Nationalist leader Daniel O'Connell and Lady Byron, the mathematician (and the poet's estranged wife). 100 conventions In 1843 Bradburn accompanied Frederick Douglass and William A. White on a lecture tour organised by the American Anti-Slavery Society and called \\"100 conventions.\\" This was not a tour preaching to the converted and he was, subsequently, attacked. Douglass was attacked and his hand broken so badly that he never recovered its full use.The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass: From 1817-1882, written by himself; with an Introduction by the Right Hon.

From 1846 to 1849, Bradburn edited the, \\"Pioneer and Herald of Freedom\\" in Lynn, Massachusetts. Douglass told a group in Ireland of a story about how Blackburn, who now was nearly completely deaf, was challenged for assuming that ministers could adopt the abolitionists message as they \\"must live.\\" Bradburn said, \\"I deny any such necessity — I dispute your premises.

Vol. I. =1850= In later life In 1850 in Boston, Bradburn married Frances H. Parker. Although she later would become an invalid and prevent him from taking up overseas positions, she was the one who eventually completed his memoirs.A Memorial of George Bradburn, Frances H. Bradburn, 1883 That year he was working for the Boston Chronotype and he attended the two-day National Woman's Rights Convention which was held in Brinley Hall, Worcester. The convention was called to order by Sarah H. Earle, and chaired by Paulina Wright Davis of Rhode Island on October 23, 1850. There were 268 delegates, but the vast majority were from Massachusetts. The news of the convention was widely reported, but frequently in a disparaging way. Only four local newspapers were thought to deal with the subject well and one of those was the Lynn Pioneer (which was edited by Bradburn). In 1851, George and Frances moved to Cleveland, Ohio where Bradburn helped to edit the True Democrat, a daily newspaper. After two years he went on lecture tours where he would sometimes speak every night for 26 days. His lectures at this time were not only political but drew on his experiences in Europe in 1840. He was able to use his trip to London as the basis of entertaining and informative lectures. In 1859, he occupied the pulpit of a Unitarian church in Athol, Massachusetts and resided there for another two years. He made good friends there and returned to visit ever summer for the next twenty years. He took a job in a customs house which had been organised by his friend Samuel Chase, but he sadly missed his ability to work. At the end of his life he called out to William A. White, who his wife remembered as a friend from his time lecturing to thousands. Death At Bradburn's funeral in 1880, Lysander Spooner read a eulogy and was a pallbearer. His wife published his biography in 1883. Lydia Maria Child wrote \\"Surely in this country, and within this century, no other cause has so tested the moral natures of men and women, as did the anti-slavery cause in its early days: and no one who knew George Bradburn at that time will doing question his right to a high place among the tried and true.\\" References 1806 births 1880 deaths American abolitionists Members of the Massachusetts General Court Harvard Divinity School alumni Phillips Exeter Academy alumni People from Attleboro, Massachusetts 19th-century Christian clergy American Unitarian clergy 19th-century American politicians ","title":"George Bradburn"},{"id":"18553061","text":"Charles Eugène Gabriel de Sombreuil (11 July 1770 – 28 July 1795) was a French Royalist commander during the French Revolution.

An additional $65 million will go toward pollution control technologies and to help low-income families pay their energy bills. In addition to the $500 million fund, the bill creates a Consumer Energy Program that is funded at $15 million for the next 3 fiscal years, then gradually decreases to $8 million by the 2015–2016 fiscal year, for a total of $100 million. Of that, $92.5 million will support loans, grants, and rebates for up to 25% of the cost of energy efficiency improvements to homes and small businesses, while $5 million will support low-interest loans for energy efficiency improvements to homes. An additional $50 million will be available over the next 8 years to support tax credits for 15% of the cost of alternative energy projects, capped at $1 million per year for each project.

Most of Postcomm's role involved regulating Royal Mail (for letter delivery and to guarantee a universal postal service) and its two subsidiaries, Post Office Ltd and Parcelforce. Postcomm was also charged with the licensing of the UK's postal operators. It was set up alongside a 'sister' organisation, Postwatch, an independent watchdog for postal services. Postwatch became part of Consumer Focus on 1 October 2008. In May 2008, Postcomm called for the part- privatisation of Royal Mail to safeguard the universal service. Following the Hooper Report into the future of the postal services industry, in October 2010, Business Secretary Vince Cable confirmed plans for the privatisation of up to 90% of the business and the possible mutualisation of the Post Office. Any purchasing business will be required to retain the universal service of collection and delivery of mail six days a week at affordable prices. Royal Mail staff are to be offered the remaining 10% shares with the Government to take on the group's pension liabilities. The changes were enabled by the Postal Services Act 2011. As part of the plans, the roles fulfilled by Postcomm were absorbed into the communications regulator Ofcom from 1 October 2011.

Currently, it can be found in the following states: USA (AL, AR, CT, GA, IA, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO, MS, NC, ND, NE, NJ, NY, OH, OK, PA, SD, TN, VA, VT, WI, WV), CAN (ON, QC) S. perfoliatum is listed as a threatened species in Michigan. Whereas S. perfoliatum is listed as a prohibited, highly invasive plant species in New York State.New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Regulation 6 NYCRR Part 575 Prohibited and Regulated Invasive Species Express Terms = Morphology of the plant = The typical height of S. perfoliatum plant ranges from . The stem is stout, smooth, slightly hairy (glabrous) strongly 4-angled square, like mint plants. The leaves are opposite, toothed and ovate. The petioles are widely winged and fused around the stem, forming a cup. The first flower develops on the tip of the main stem, then more flowers develop on side branches. = Morphology of the flowers = The flowers, which appear from midsummer to autumn (fall), look very similar to sunflowers, but are a lot smaller; measuring about 2.5 cm in diameter, with golden yellow ray florets. In the middle of the flower there are small, sterile, tubular disk florets, which are structurally bisexual, but the stamens are the only fertile part, and they do not produce seeds. The corollas are tubular, 5-toothed, and the style is undivided. = Generative reproduction = Seed head and seeds – MHNT The ray florets have female characteristics, and eventually develop to become thin brown achenes with a marginal wing utilized for wind dispersal. Insect pollinators including bees, butterflies, and skippers help to cross-fertilize flowers to produce seeds. 20 to 30 seeds are created in each flower head. Each seed is about 9 to 15 mm long, 6–9 mm wide, flattened in shape, with a thickness of 1 mm. = Vegetative reproduction = S. perfoliatum is able to establish colonies due to its central taproot system and shallow rhizomes. A multi-rhizomed clone originating from a single seed is believed to be 15 years old. The roots found in botanical gardens have been estimated to be more than 50 years old. S. perfoliatum has an extensive root system and does not transplant well except when very young. = Further information = S. perfoliatums metabolic pathway is the C3 carbon fixation. This plant is highly adapted to endure extreme weather and inhospitable conditions. For example, during the winter, the roots remain dormant and can survive temperatures as low as . Its optimal growing temperature is .  Uses =Use as energy crop= S. perfoliatum is considered a potential energy crop plant, especially because it has low demands on the climate, the soil and previous crop and produces high amounts of biomass. Based on the results of the Thuringian State Institute of Agriculture the plant can be an alternative plant for biogas production. The annual biomass yields are very different according to the present literature: In the second cultivation year S. perfoliatumcan grow from 13 to 20 tons of biomass per hectare, an experiment done in Thüringen, Germany even showed that 18 to 28 tons of dry weight per hectare are possible.K. Arnold, J. von Geibler, K. Bienge, C. Stachura, S. Borbonus und K. Kristof: Potenziale der Bioenergie. Chancen und Risiken für landwirtschaftliche Unternehmen, DLG-Verlag, Band 204, S. 158–159,  Cultivation  In Germany, the arable cultivation of S. perfoliatum is becoming increasingly widespread for biogas production. Its invasive potential for Mid European countries is considered as low, but a spread through wind, birds and harvesting machines is possible. One has to be especially careful when growing S. perfoliatum near moving bodies of water, so that it cannot spread and germinate on river banks like Buddleja davidii does. This could be a potential problem, because these ecosystems are very sensitive. Landwirtschaftliches Technologiezentrum Augustenberg (2011), Erste Versuchsergebnisse mit der Durchwachsenen Silphie (Silphium perfoliatum L.) in Baden-Württemberg =Sowing and planting= Due to low germination rate of 15-20% with untreated seeds S. perfoliatum is usually planted as seedling. This is the reason for high investment costs in establishing the crop. Furthermore, there is no yield in the first planting season as S. perfoliatum is only harvested from the second year on.B. Janzig: “Praktiker ebnen der Silphie den Weg”, Biogas Journal, Band 6, S. 43-45, 2015 In Germany, seeding time to obtain an acceptable seedling development is in the beginning of May. The highest biomass yield is achieved with 10 cm × 50 cm (within-row spacing: 10 cm; distance between the rows: 50cm). In European climate conditions the planting of seedlings is typically carried out at the end of May, or the beginning of June with planting machines from the vegetable and gardening industries. Low plant density (50 cm × 75 cm, 75 cm × 75 cm) can give a higher yield in the first harvestable year compared to the higher plant densities (50 cm × 50 cm). In the second harvestable year, they are similar, regardless of the plant density. In order to avoid reduced yields in the first year a possible solution could be sowing S. perfoliatum in combination with corn. Three quarters of usual corn yields can be achieved in the first year and S. perfoliatum can establish after corn harvest, achieving its full potential in the following year.Deutsche Biogasbranche wirbt für US-Pflanze. In: Bizz Energy, 17. August 2016. Retrieved 10. November 2019. =Fertilisation= The fertilisation of S. perfoliatum should take place as early as possible in the year. This minimizes damage to the lap shoots from driving over them. S. perfoliatuma needs about 1 kg N to form 1 dt of dry matter. Depending on the expected yield, the fertilization per vegetation period is 130 - 160 kg N/ha. The fertilization of the following nutrients also depends on the expected yield. With an expected yield of 150 dt/ha, S. perfoliatum requires the following quantities of nutrients:Anbauanleitung für die Durchwachsene Silphie. Dezember 2012, Retrieved 10. November 2019.  Phosphorus: 25 kg/ha  Potassium: 150 kg/ha  Magnesium: 50 kg/ha  Calcium: 200 kg/ha Other tests show that fertilization is no longer necessary from the second year onwards. This shows that fertilization depends strongly on the expected yield. With a higher weighting of the ecological effects of the crop, the fertilization can be omitted. When used as an alternative to corn (biogas production), the aim is to achieve the highest possible biomass yield and fertilization is therefore necessary.muss nicht länger missbraucht werden. 13. September 2016, Retrieved 10. November 2019.  Disease and herbivory  S. perfoliatum are known to be disease and herbivory resistant, although established plants can be affected by the fungus Sclerotinia. However, this depends on the size of the area it is grown on, the growing conditions as well as the crop grown before the cup plant. Crops which are very susceptible to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and therefore should not be cultivated previous to S. perfoliatum are rape seed and sunflowers. Even if S. perfoliatum show signs of Sclerotinia, they can recover from the fungus infection the following year. The university of Bayreuth does not mention any relevant fungal of bacterial infections at all in their research on the cup plant. Eggs of the gall wasp are deposited within the stems of this plant. Consequently, the developing larvae feed within the stems. American Goldfinches feed on the seeds of S. perfoliatum and drink the water collected by the “cups” on the stems. As cup plants are able to form dense colonies, they provide a good shelter for birds. Herbivores such as cattle and sheep will eat the leaves of the plant, especially those of young plants.  Advantages of cultivating S. perfoliatum instead of corn as an energy crop = Ecologically = * After the first year of cultivation, there is no need for herbicides anymore and the dense root mass protects the soil from erosion.Neuer Rohstoff: ausdauernde Pflanzen, Pressemitteilung der Universität Bayreuth vom 29. September 2009 * There is little or no fertilizer required from the second year of cultivation.Mais muss nicht länger missbraucht werden. In: Wirtschaftswoche, 13. September 2016. Retrieved 10.

They do not obstruct the new shoots in spring and do not have to be removed like corn stems. * Regrown vegetatively reestablished cup plants tolerate light frosts. Thus they are less vulnerable to early or late frosts than corn. * The cultivation of cup-plants reduces risks in years of unfavourable weather conditions for corn (like wet and cold spring, summer drought). * Cup plants may be harvested over a relatively long period, which attenuates work peaks. * Long use of established stands (high saving potentials) Some farmers are hesitant to grow this plant, because S. perfoliatum can not be harvested in the first year of cultivation. This issue can be solved by intercropping it with corn in the first year, which can be harvested for biogas production too or for animal feed. Also, S. perfoliatum should be cultivated for at least 5 years to amortize the initial costs. Potential invasiveness if cultivated as an energy crop Although in North America it is a native plant, the cup plant has been declared invasive in several States in the US . Therefore, its invasiveness is in active discussion, especially when considering it as a potential biofuel crop. To establish potential invasiveness, there is the Weed Risk Assessment (WRA), which can be modified for the local environment and be used to evaluate the potential invasiveness of species proposed as biofuels and to evaluate whether the traits selected for in biofuel species might predispose them to be invasive. There is the Australian- and the US-WRA. The cup plant, S. perfoliatum, has not been assessed yet. However, desirable traits for biofuels tend to overlap with those of invasive species, such as high productivity, low input requirements, and wide habitat breadth (Raghu et al., 2013). S. perfoliatum fits these criteria, but because generatively reproduced seeds have low germination rates, one could hypothesize that the potential invasiveness is relatively small and that the spread of S. perfoliatum can be contained. Furthermore, one could harvest before the seeds reach their full maturity. =Use as animal fodder= Although its use as an energy crop prevails, S. perfoliatum can also be used as a fodder plant thanks to its ingredients. S. perfoliatum contains amino acids, carbohydrates (inulin in rhizomes), L-ascorbic acid, terpenes with essential oils, triterpene saponins, carotenoids, phenolic acid, tannins, and flavonoids. The cup plant is considered to have a high feed value for meat and milk producing farm animals because of its longevity and high protein levels. S. perfoliatum can be stored as silage. It is recommended to harvest the plant twice a year. Otherwise, the stem gets too tough due to the high content of fibre. The high water content at the first cutting in June is not a problem when letting the plant wilt shortly. The blooming period of S. perfoliatum takes eight or more weeks. The long blooming period and abundance of flowers provides a rich source for bees and the cultivation of honey. The honey is rich in fructose and crystalizes therefore only slowly. 150 kg honey per hectare and year are reported as a possible yield from a cup plant field. = Use for medical purposes = Silphium perfoliatum – Orto botanico di Pisa S. perfoliatum produces a resin that has an odor similar to turpentine. The plant contains a gum and resin; the root has been used medicinally. The resin has been made into chewing gum to prevent nausea and vomiting. Native Americans would cut off the top of the plant stalk and collect the resinous sap that was emitted from the plant. The resin was used for a chewing gum to freshen the breath. The Winnebagos Tribe believed that a potion made from the rhizome would provide supernatural powers. The people belonging to the tribe would drink this potion before hunting. The people of the Chippewas tribe used the root extract for back and chest pains, to prevent excessive menstruation, and to treat lung hemorrhage. During the spring, the tender young leaves were cultivated as an acceptable food source by cooking or a salad. The powdered form of S. perfoliatum' has diaphoretic and tonic properties. It can help alleviate the symptoms of fevers, dry cough, asthma, spleen illness, heart and liver disease. The extract from the leaves of the plant has shown to lower cholesterol and triglycerides levels in blood. Studies show that the presence of phenolic acids is responsible for the species’ antiseptic activity to stimulate generation of IgG and IgM antibodies. In addition, it stimulates bile production of the gall bladder. =Use as pollinator and bird-friendly ornamental garden plants= The flowers of S. perfoliatum make it an attractive plant for many pollinators, the seeds along with the \\"cups\\" of water, formed along the stems, are attractive to birds as a food and water source. During the 1750s, the species was introduced to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, and has been prized as an ornamental plant since. It was named in 1759 by Carl Linnaeus. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. S. perfoliatum is sold by a good number of native plant nurseries and some specialty nurseries in the US and Canada; rarely in conventional nurseries. It is often used in prairie and native meadow restorations and in native, naturalistic landscapes and gardens; only infrequently in conventional landscapes and gardens by landscape designers and architects that know of it as a unique looking perennial. A large patch was planted at Millennium Park in Chicago, Illinois, near the Lurie Garden, in 2010. In gardening and landscaping it is best used in groups and not individually, as it is so vertical and the flower stalks are more likely to fall over when grown singularly.

He took part in the American War of Independence, and later in the Chouannerie uprising against the Republic during the French Revolutionary Wars. He was the grandson of Antoine Le Prestre de Vaubanhimself Antoine was nephew to the military architect Vauban.  Biography  Entering military service in 1770, he was Rochambeau's aide-de-camp during the American War of Independence and was sent back to France with the general's dispatches in 1782. He became colonel and second in command of the régiment d'Agenors, and shortly afterwards, the duc d'Orléans, whose chamberlain he was, made him colonel in command of the régiment d'infanterie that took his name and knight of the order of Saint- Louis on 13 June 1784. Like most other officer of his corps, he emigrated around the time of Louis XVI's flight to Varennes, going to Ath, then Koblenz, where the comte d'Artois made him his aide-de-camp. He accompanied him in this role during the campaign of 1792 and on his trip to Russia in 1793, where they were well received by Catherine II of Russia. He then went to England, and in spring 1795 joined the Quiberon expedition. Tasked by Joseph-Geneviève de Puisaye with commanding a unit of Chouans charged with attacking the rear of the Republican army, he was prevented by the forces of Hoche and, tricked by false signals, forced to retreat. He fulfilled several different missions to the Vendée and the île d'Yeu, with the comte d'Artois. Returning to London, he hastened to return to Russia but arrived there at the moment of Catherine's death, fell victim (like most French Royalists in Russia) to Paul I's changeability and was soon forced to leave. He returned to France and stayed for a time in Paris, with police consent, until he was arrested in 1806 and held prisoner for a long while in the Temple.

Applications exist in research and development, laboratory, quality, production and field environment. There are two kinds of force gauges today: mechanical and digital force gauges. Force Gauges usually measure pressure in stress increments and other dependent human factors. Mechanical force gauges A common mechanical force scale, known as the spring scale, features a hook and a spring that attach to an object and measure the amount of force exerted on the spring in order to extend it. Another example is the mechanical strain gauge. Digital gauge An example of a digital force gauge is a load cell (this is often combined with software and a display). A load cell is an electronic device that is used to convert a force into an electrical signal. Through a mechanical arrangement, the force being sensed deforms a strain gauge. The strain gauge converts the deformation (strain) to electrical signals. The software and electronics of the force gauge convert the voltage of the load cell into a force value that is displayed on the instrument. Test units of force measurements are most commonly newtons or pounds. The peak force is the most common result in force testing applications, this can be used to determine if a part is good or not. Some examples of force measurements include door latch, quality of spring, wire testing, and strength. More complicated tests can also be performed such as peeling, friction, and texture.

Red-lipped batfish are closely related to rosy-lipped batfish (Ogcocephalus porrectus), which are found near Cocos Island off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. This fish is mainly known for its bright red lips. Batfish are not good swimmers; they use their highly adapted pectoral, pelvic and anal fins to \\"walk\\" on the ocean floor. When the batfish reaches maturity, its dorsal fin becomes a single spine-like projection (thought to function primarily as a lure for prey). Diet The species is a piscivore / invertivore, mainly feeding on other small fish and small invertebrates including shrimp, crabs, worms and mollusks. Body The body color of the red-lipped batfish is light brown and a greyish colour on its back, with white countershading on the underside. On the top side of the batfish there is usually a dark brown stripe starting at the head and going down the back to the tail. The snout and horn of the red-lipped batfish is a brownish color. As the name of the fish states, the batfish has bright, almost fluorescent, red lips. The color of the squamation of the red-lipped batfish is shagreen-like with a relatively smooth texture. The bucklers are concealed by a layer of fine spinules. Ogcocephalus darwini body plan When compared to the porrectus, the red-lipped batfish has a shorter disk perimeter but higher fibre pectoral fin ray count. Regarding the number of scales along the lateral like, there are four to nine subopercular scales, six to nine on the cheek, usually. The red-lipped batfish has around 19-20 vertebrae. The red-lipped batfish reaches up to 40cm in length. Hall On the top of the batfish's head there is a special body part that extends outward called an illicium. After the red-lipped batfish fully matures, its dorsal fin becomes a single spine-like projection that comes out of the top of the head. The batfish uses the illicium as a way to lure prey near them.Factspod At the top of its illicium is an esca. The esca emits a bright light and since these fish dwell in deep waters, the light lures other fish to where the batfish is positioned. The esca lures the prey to the batfish which then allows it to eat those small creatures which fall into its trap. Red-lipped batfish have extremely bright red lips, which allows people to distinguish them from other batfish. Marine biologists believe that the bright red lips of the red-lipped batfish may be used to enhance species recognition during spawning. It is also believed that by exposing their lips can attract sexual tension within the species. Habitat Red-lipped batfish can be found at depths of , in the Pacific Ocean around the Galapagos Islands and off Peru. It has been noted before that a few specimens of red-lipped batfish were found in fish nets in California, but all these type of sightings are extremely rare, and could very well be another type of batfish. They are bottom dwellers, so they are usually found within the sand or ocean floor. Although they are considered shallow water forms, they occasionally come to the surface over deep water. They tend to associate themselves with the edges of reefs up to about 120 m deep.Lea =Predators= The Red-lipped batfish has no known direct threats. However, rising sea temperatures and coral bleaching could pose a threat, as it would alter the natural habitat and may cause a decline in the availability of a natural food source.

In practice, specialized broadband/full- spectrum film captures visible and near infrared light, commonly referred to as the \\"VNIR\\"., Definition of VNIR. Modified digital cameras can detect some ultraviolet, all of the visible and much of the near infrared spectrum, as most digital imaging sensors are sensitive from about 350 nm to 1000 nm. An off-the-shelf digital camera contains an infrared hot mirror filter that blocks most of the infrared and a bit of the ultraviolet that would otherwise be detected by the sensor, narrowing the accepted range from about 400 nm to 700 nm. Replacing a hot mirror or infrared blocking filter with an infrared pass or a wide spectrally transmitting filter allows the camera to detect the wider spectrum light at greater sensitivity. Without the hot-mirror, the red, green and blue (or cyan, yellow and magenta) elements of the color filter array placed over the sensor elements pass varying amounts of ultraviolet and infrared which may be recorded in any of the red, green or blue channels depending on the particular sensor in use and on the dyes used in the Bayer filter. A converted full-spectrum camera can be used for ultraviolet photography or infrared photography with the appropriate filters. Uses of full-spectrum photography include fine art photography, geology, forensics & law enforcement, and even some claimed use in ghost hunting.  History  Full-spectrum photography has its roots in spectral imaging, both multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, which began as early as the late 1950s and early 1960s as means for geological and military remote sensing. Wideband panchromatic film has been available in various forms since the 1920s, when some UV and IR sensitivity remained in commercially available emulsions. The earliest color films sometimes included wider band color than recent commercial photographic emulsions, and can be recognized by the more reddish and or limited color tones of early color prints (not to be confused with print fading). In the late 1990s enthusiastic photographers began shooting infrared with digital cameras, necessitating either long exposures or the removal of the internal hot mirror. Most replaced the hot mirror with an infrared pass filter of the same optical thickness (to retain focus) and pass only infrared light to achieve results seen with infrared B&W; film. Around 2000, electro-optical engineer David Twede, already engaged in VNIR and infrared spectral remote sensing, ventured into Full-spectrum photography art, using a modified digital camera to explore broader spectral imaging and developing an artistic style using it. Around 2003, forensics photographers using engineered cameras for specific purposes began modifying off-the-shelf digital cameras to acquire less expensive tools. Full-spectrum photography is used by enthusiasts of ghost hunting, though no claims of actually photographing psychic phenomenon with Full-spectrum or infrared photography have been substantiated. Today, there are a few places that will modify digital cameras to pass broad, full-spectrum light for full spectral imaging. A few DSLR cameras such as the Fujifilm FinePix IS Pro are purpose-designed for full spectrum use and respond from approximately 1000 nm (IR) to 380 nm (UV).  Basics  Comparison of images taken with different spectral responses. Digital sensors and photographic films can be made to record non- visible ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) radiation. In each case, they generally require special equipment: converted digital cameras, specific filters, highly transmitting lenses, etc. For example, most photographic lenses are made of glass and will filter out most ultraviolet light. Instead, expensive lenses made of quartz must be used. Infrared films may be shot in standard cameras using an infrared pass filters, although focus must compensate for the infrared focal point. A converted digital camera usually requires that the infrared hot mirror be removed and replaced by a wideband, spectrally flat glass of the same optical path length. Typical glass types used include Schott WG-280 and BK-7, which transmit as much as 90% from around 300 nm to past 1000 nm. Removing the hot mirror is tedious and may require special tools and clean rooms., Tedious instructions on modifying a Nikon D50. Once the camera is sensitive to the full-spectrum, external filters can be used to selectively filter portions of the UV, visible and infrared to achieve various effects. For example, a standard red #25a can be used to include red light and infrared light together, yielding particularly strong two-toned color images of a reddish nature except where the infrared is high and shows as cyan. Another example, using UV/IR filters such as the 18A or U-330 yield a two or three toned image in which blues and yellows dominate. Less common filters have been claimed to give a variety of color effects ranging from diverse pastel foliage and deep blue skies to surrealistic effects of the sky and ground, though digital image processing is likely required to achieve the full effects. One issue with full-spectrum photography in either film or digital photography is the chromatic aberration produced by the wideband information. That is, different spectra, including the ultraviolet and infrared, will focus at different focal points, yielding blurry images and color edge effects, depending on the focal length used. There are specialized lenses such as the Nikon 105mm f4.5 UV-Nikkor which are designed to eliminate this chromatic aberration. It is important to note that while the converted camera sensor is capable of recording in both the ultraviolet and infrared region, when mixed light hits the sensor it will be the longer infrared waves that will predominate in the recording. Little or no shortwave ultraviolet light may be recorded unless selective filtering is applied to cut some or all of the infrared light. The longwave infrared light may also wash out a considerable amount of the visible light in the blue and green areas in a full spectrum photograph. Similarly if infrared light is entirely blocked, the visible light can overwhelm the recording of the ultraviolet light. So there is no truly full-spectrum photograph that can be made. Full-spectrum photography achieves various effects and surrealistic colors from the interaction of reflectivity (UV, visible, IR) of nature and man made materials and the specific spectral transmission of the red, green and blue filters on the camera. The addition of external filters will reduce and emphasize different interactions, yielding different effects.  Applications = Art = Full-spectrum photography is being used for art photography and can yield colors similar to visible color film, but with a brightness and tonality of infrared photographs. Most full-spectrum art is of landscapes. A movement is also building for artistic human photography with full-spectrum photography, that captures a real person interacting with a surreal landscape. Full- spectrum photography art is displayed at galleries in Colorado and Florida. = Science hobbyists = Hyperspectral and most multispectral cameras are expensive and difficult to operate, requiring a computer acquisition and laborious post-processing. Modified digital cameras with the proper filtering avail some limited spectral sensing for geology/mineralogy, agriculture and oceanographic purposes. Most consumer cameras retain the red, green and blue micro-filters, thus limiting their usefulness in scientific imaging. = Forensics = Forensics imaging often uses Full-spectrum cameras to emphasize non-visible materials which have more diverse reflectivities in the ultraviolet and infrared. Applications include non-visible inks (uv & ir), disturbed soil (uv & ir), gunshot residue (ir), body fluids (uv), fibers, etc. Analogous to forensics, Full-spectrum cameras are being explored to enhance photographic recordings of archeological findings.

People who have a medical condition which impairs control of their defecation use bowel management techniques to choose a predictable time and place to evacuate. A simple bowel management technique might include diet control and establishing a toilet routine. As a more involved practice a person might use an enema to relieve themselves. Without bowel management, the person might either suffer from the feeling of not getting relief, or they might soil themselves. Bowel control is often a challenge for children who are born with anomalies in their anus or rectum, Hirschsprung's disease, and/or spina bifida. Medical providers can help anyone with long term bowel problems to develop a routine in such cases to assist children in managing their bowels so that they can otherwise live normally.  Overview  Bowel management is achieved mainly through a daily enema which empties the colon to prevent unwanted and uncontrolled bowel movements that day.Peña A, Guardino K, Tovilla JM, Levitt MA, Rodriguez G, Torres R Bowel management for fecal incontinence in patients with anorectal malformations Pediatr. Surg. 33:1 133–7 1998 Some patients also use laxatives and a controlled diet as part of their bowel management regimen. Another alternative is transanal irrigation. Transanal irrigation of the rectum and colon is designed to assist the evacuation of faeces from the bowel by introducing water into rectum via the anus., Consensus review of best practice of transanal irrigation in adults A V Emmanuel et al. Spinal Cord 2013. By regularly emptying the bowel using transanal irrigation, controlled bowel function is often re-established to a high degree in patients with bowel incontinence and/or constipation. This enables the users to develop a consistent bowel routine by choosing the time and place of evacuation. An international consensus on when and how to use transanal irrigation for people with bowel problems was published 2013. The article offers practitioners a clear, comprehensive and simple guide to practice for the emerging therapeutic area of transanal irrigation. Determining the appropriate regimen to achieve successful bowel management is done under medical supervision. Care is tailored to suit each child and often requires a trial and error approach over the course of a week. The patient has an X-ray taken which is reviewed by their doctor. The doctor then recommends a course of action (e.g. enemas, laxative, and/or controlled diet). The next day, the process is repeated with modifications to help the child achieve a completely empty colon. After the course of this week the doctor can determine the precise amount and combination of what the child needs to achieve bowel management. From then on the patient can continue the regimen on their own. Bowel management does not cure fecal incontinence, but can greatly increase quality of life. With successful bowel management, a child may be more apt to establish independence in normal daily life. Children with severe incontinence may also be able to attend school and participate in activities they otherwise would never be able to. Depending on the prognosis, some patients will continue using these techniques for life while others may gain some degree of bowel control and become \\"potty trained\\". Children who practice bowel management often become unhappy as they age, especially at puberty, due to feeling that the administration of enemas is an intrusion on their privacy, especially as it is difficult for them to administer the enema themselves. An operation called a continent appendicostomy or Malone procedure is available. This allows a person to give themselves an enema by inserting a catheter into a small orifice at the navel.Levitt MA, Soffer SZ, Pena A. Continent appendicostomy in the bowel management of fecally incontinent children. J Pediatr Surg. November 1997;32(11):1630-3  Fecal incontinence  The medical definition of fecal incontinence is the incapacity to voluntarily hold feces in the rectum. There are two subgroups to those with fecal incontinence: real fecal incontinence and pseudoincontinence.Levitt MA, Soffer SZ, Pena A. Continent appendicostomy in the bowel management of fecally incontinent children. J Pediatr Surg. November 1997;32(11):1630-3 =Real fecal incontinence= For a child with real fecal incontinence, the normal mechanism of bowel control is not working. An alteration of the muscles that surround the anorectal canal along with poor sphincters (those muscles which control the anus) are responsible for fecal incontinence in children operated on for anorectal malformations with a bad prognosis. Some patients operated on for Hirschsprung's disease have this anatomic problem as do those with spinal problems. The supply of nerve connections of these muscles is important for their correct function. A deficit of nerve connections occurs in anorectal anomalies as well as in other conditions. In cases of spina bifida, or following spinal cord injury, the contraction and relaxation of the muscles, as well as sensation, are deficient. The presence and the passage of feces and the perception of the difference between solid and liquid feces and gas are limited. = Pseudoincontinence = In cases of pseudoincontinence, a child is believed to suffer from fecal incontinence. However, investigation shows that he or she suffers from severe constipation and fecal impaction. When the impaction is treated and the patient receives enough laxatives to pass stool, he or she becomes continent.  Candidates for bowel management  Children who suffer from fecal incontinence after the repair of an imperforate anus are usually those born with a bad prognosis type of defect and severe associated defects (defect of the sacrum, poor muscle complex). However, such children can still achieve a good quality of life when treated with the bowel management program. Children operated on for imperforate anus and who suffer from fecal incontinence can be divided into two groups that require individualized treatment plans: Children with constipation (colonic hypomotility): No special diet or medications are necessary for children with colonic hypomotility, a type of constipation. Their tendency towards constipation helps them to remain clean between enemas. The real challenge is to find an enema capable of cleaning the colon completely. Soiling episodes or \\"accidents\\" occur when there is an incomplete cleaning of the bowel. Children with loose stools and diarrhea (colonic hypermotility): This group of children has an overactive colon. Rapid transit of stool results in frequent episodes of diarrhea. This means that even when an enema cleans the colon rather easily, stool keeps on passing fairly quickly from the cecum to the descending colon and the anus. To prevent this, a constipating diet and/or medications to slow down the colon are necessary. Eliminating foods that further loosen bowel movements will help the colon to slow down. Those who experience hypermotility may have to follow a constipating diet and avoid laxative foods. The diet is rigid and includes food such as banana, apple, baked bread, white pasta with no sauce, boiled meat, and others, while fried foods and dairy products are avoided.

Thomson was discouraged from acting by her experiences and returned to her hometown of Auckland to focus on friends and family. Drawn back to stage, she ended up performing outdoor Shakespeare, as part of The University of Auckland's long-running Summer Shakespeare tradition.

A hurrier and two thrusters heaving a corf full of coal as depicted in the 1853 book The White Slaves of England by J Cobden. Mines and Collieries Act 1842 (c. 99), commonly known as the Mines Act 1842, was an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Act forbade women and girls of any age to work underground and introduced a minimum age of ten for boys employed in underground work. It was a response to the working conditions of children revealed in the Children's Employment Commission (Mines) 1842 report. The Commission was headed by Anthony Ashley-Cooper, Member of Parliament, who was styled Baron Ashley at the time, a courtesy title, and would succeed his father as the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury in 1852. At the beginning of the 19th century methods of coal extraction were primitive and the workforce, men, women and children, laboured in dangerous conditions. In 1841 about 216,000 people were employed in the mines. Women and children worked underground for 11 or 12 hours a day for smaller wages than men. The public became aware of conditions in the country's collieries in 1838 after an accident at Huskar Colliery in Silkstone, near Barnsley. A stream overflowed into the ventilation drift after violent thunderstorms causing the death of 26 children; 11 girls aged from 8 to 16 and 15 boys between 9 and 12 years of age. The disaster came to the attention of Queen Victoria who ordered an inquiry. In 1840 Lord Ashley headed the royal commission of inquiry, which investigated the conditions of workers (especially children) in the coal mines. Commissioners visited collieries and mining communities gathering information sometimes against the mine owners' wishes. The report, illustrated by engraved illustrations and the personal accounts of mineworkers was published in May 1842. Victorian society was shocked to discover that children as young as five or six worked as trappers, opening and shutting ventilation doors down the mine, before becoming hurriers, pushing and pulling coal tubs and corfs. Lord Ashley deliberately appealed to Victorian prudery, focussing on girls and women wearing trousers and working bare-breasted in the presence of boys and men, which \\"made girls unsuitable for marriage and unfit to be mothers\\". Such an affront to Victorian morality ensured the bill was passed. Lord Londonderry, a coal-mine owner, opposed the Bill in the House of Lords and pushed through amendments that watered it down. The bill passed the House of Lords at its third reading on 1 August 1842.  Results of the act  *No females could be employed underground *No child under 10 years old was to be employed underground *Parish apprentices between the ages of 10 and 18 could continue to work in the mines http://www.historyhome.co.uk/peel/factmine/minesact.htm References 1842 in labor relations Coal mining in the United Kingdom Coal mining law Health and safety in the United Kingdom History of mining in the United Kingdom Occupational safety and health law United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1842 United Kingdom labour law Women in mining ","title":"Mines and Collieries Act 1842"},{"id":"18553713","text":"Ivanas Stapovičius (born July 14, 1980 in Vilnius) is a retired boxer from Lithuania.

Background  The Ottoman Empire suffered several major defeats at war with the Holy League which significantly contributed to development of the crisis which resulted with the deposition of sultan Mehmed IV to advance into Ottoman territory. The Holy League decided to use this crisis to attack the Ottoman Empire. One of the main goals was the capture of Belgrade, one of the strongest Ottoman strongholds in Europe at that time.  Prelude  The forces of Holy League advanced toward Belgrade from two directions. The forces that advanced along river Sava were under the command of the emperor Leopold I while forces that advanced along river Danube were under the command of the elector of Bavaria, Maximilian II Emanuel. According to the initial Ottoman plan, Yeğen Osman's forces moved from Belgrade to Šabac and further to Gradiška with the task not to allow the Leopold's army to cross to the right bank of Sava, while Hasan Pasha, Ottoman serasker of Hungary, stayed in Belgrade waiting for money and military reinforcements from Asia before advancing toward the enemy. After receiving the news that Leopold's army had already crossed Sava and captured Kostajnica, Gradiška and the region around the river Una, Yeğen Osman returned to Belgrade.  Forces and commanders  Max Emanuel (1662–1726) by Joseph Vivien. The forces of the Holy League were led by Maximilian II Emanuel with Prince Eugene of Savoy as one of his commanders. In this battle they had 98 companies of infantry, 77 and a half escadrons of cavalry, and artillery forces of 98 canons. The Austrians were also accompanied by Serbian volunteers and members of Serbian Militia under the command of Jovan Monasterlija. The Ottoman forces were commanded by Yeğen Osman who was shortly before this battle appointed to the position of governor of Belgrade. In early 1688 Yeğen Osman went to Belgrade with his forces and forcefully deposed serdar Hasan Pasha and captured his camp on the Vračar hill. Total number of forces under his command in Belgrade was 25-30,000.  Battle  Belgrade in 1684, one of the strongest Ottoman strongholds in Europe at that time. Maximilian began with movement of his forces on 30 July 1688 when they captured Ottoman outpost near Titel. Yeğen Osman positioned his troops around Belgrade to prevent the fleeing of its garrison and population. Supported by the Christian population of Ottoman Serbia, his forces landed on Ada Ciganlija, a river island near Belgrade's suburb Ostružnica. On 7 August they positioned pontoon bridges between Ada Ciganlija and the right bank of river Sava. The first group of 500 Austrian soldiers crossed the bridge under fire of Yeğen Osman's artillery. When they established a foothold on the right bank of Sava, 10,000 forces joined them. Yeğen Osman attacked them with the bulk of his forces, but the Austrians repelled his two attacks, captured more land on the right bank of Sava, and brought additional forces. They besieged the city and subjected it to cannon fire for nearly a month. A day after the army of the Holy Roman Empire crossed Sava, a letter written by the emperor Leopold I was brought to Yeğen Osman and offered him Wallachia to desert the Ottomans and switch to their side. On 10 August, Yeğen Osman gave a letter with his answer to the Austrian envoy and dispatched him from his camp. Since Yeğen Osman requested the whole of Slavonia and Bosnia, they did not make an agreement. When Yeğen Osman realized that his forces were outnumbered, he burned his camp and both Serb populated Belgrade suburbs on Sava and Danube. He then retreated to Smederevo and spent two days looting and burning it. Yeğen Osman left Smederevo and went to Niš via Smederevska Palanka. From Niš, he wrote reports about the siege to the Ottoman government requesting urgent military and financial support necessary to defend Belgrade. He recommended annihilation of the rebellious rayah. Sublime Porte sent him 120 bags of gold and decided to mobilize the Muslim population of Rumelia to deal with the rebelling population of Belgrade pashalik. Upon refusal of his offer to accept the Ottoman garrison's surrender, Maximilian ordered an assault on 6 September. At first the Imperial forces wavered, but Maximilian, accompanied by Prince Eugene of Savoy, rallied the forces and drove the garrison from the walls. Maximilian's forces lost 4,000 men in the assault, while the Turks lost 5,000. During the two-year period of Habsburg rule, the Belgrade fortress and town were rebuilt. In 1690 the Ottomans returned to besiege it and re-captured it.

Description \\"A Letter to a Royal Academy\\" was composed in response to a call for scientific papers from the Royal Academy of Brussels. Franklin believed that the various academic societies in Europe were increasingly pretentious and concerned with the impractical. Revealing his \\"bawdy, scurrilous side,\\" Franklin responded with an essay suggesting that research and practical reasoning be undertaken into methods of improving the odor of human flatulence. The essay was never submitted but was sent as a letter to Richard Price, a Welsh philosopher and Unitarian minister in England with whom Franklin had an ongoing correspondence. The text of the essay's introduction reads in part: The essay goes on to discuss the way different foods affect the odor of flatulence and to propose scientific testing of farting. Franklin also suggests that scientists work to develop a drug, \\"wholesome and not disagreeable\\", which can be mixed with \\"common Food or Sauces\\" with the effect of rendering flatulence \\"not only inoffensive, but agreeable as Perfumes\\". The essay ends with a pun saying that compared to the practical applications of this discussion, other sciences are \\"scarcely worth a FART-HING.\\" Copies of the essay were privately printed by Franklin at his printing press in Passy. Franklin distributed the essay to friends, including Joseph Priestley (a chemist infamous for his work on gases).

The main product of the software suite is the CODESYS Development System, an IEC 61131-3 tool. Introduction CODESYS is developed and marketed by the German software company CODESYS GmbH located in the Bavarian town of Kempten. The company was founded in 1994 under the name 3S-Smart Software Solutions - it was renamed in 2018 and 2020. Version 1.0 of CODESYS was released in 1994. Licenses of the CODESYS Development System are free of charge and can be installed legally without copy protection on further workstations. The software suite covers different aspects of industrial automation technology with one surface. The tool is independent from device manufacturers and thus used for hundreds of different controllers, PLCs (programmable logic controllers), PAC (programmable automation controllers), ECUs (electronic control units), controllers for building automation and other programmable controllers mostly for industrial purposes.  Integrated use cases  The tool covers different aspects of industrial automation: =Engineering= The five programming languages for application programming defined in the IEC 61131-3 are available in the CODESYS development environment. * IL (instruction list) is an assembler like programming language (Is now deprecated but available for backward compatibility) * ST (structured text) is similar to programming in Pascal or C * LD (ladder diagram) enables the programmer to virtually combine relay contacts and coils * FBD (function block diagram) enables the user to rapidly program both Boolean and analogue expressions * SFC (sequential function chart) is convenient for programming sequential processes and flows Additional graphical editor available in CODESYS: * CFC (Continuous Function Chart) is a sort of freehand FBD editor. Other than in the network-oriented FBD editor where the connections between inputs, operators and outputs are set automatically they have to be drawn by the programmer. All boxes can be placed freely which makes it possible to program feedback loops without interim variables. Integrated compilers transform the application code created by CODESYS into native machine code (binary code) which is then downloaded onto the controller. The most important 16-, 32- and 64-bit CPU families are supported, such as TriCore, 80x86/iX, ARM/Cortex, PowerPC, SH, MIPS, BlackFin and more. Once CODESYS is connected with the controller, it offers an extensive debugging functionality such as variable monitoring/writing/forcing by setting breakpoints/performing single steps or recording variable values online on the controller in a ring buffer (Sampling Trace) as well as core dumps during exceptions. CODESYS V3.x is based on the so-called CODESYS Automation Platform, an automation framework device manufacturers can extend by their own plug-in modules. The CODESYS Professional Developer Edition offers the option to add components to the tool which are subject to licensing, e.g. integrated UML support, a connection to the Apache Subversion version control system, online runtime performance analysis (\\"Profiler\\"), static code analysis of the application code or script based automated test execution. The CODESYS Application Composer serves to create applications by using existing modules. The user composes, parameterizes, and connects the required modules to form a complete application. This configuration does not require knowledge of PLC programming and can therefore be done by technicians without programming experience. Internal generators create complete, well-structured IEC 61131-3 applications including the I/O mapping and visualizations. The Application Composer requires a license to develop and to compose modules. Furthermore, there are freely usable modules (i.e. Persistence Manager, Device Diagnosis), which can be used without a license. =Runtime= After implementing the CODESYS Control Runtime System, intelligent devices can be programmed with CODESYS. A charged-for toolkit provides this runtime system as a source and object code. It can be ported to different platforms. Since the beginning of 2014 there is also a runtime version for the Raspberry Pi. However, this does not guarantee hard real time characteristics. The Raspberry Pi interfaces, such as I²C, SPI and 1-Wire are supported in addition to the Ethernet-based fieldbuses. Furthermore, SoftPLC systems under Windows and Linux are available, which turn industrial PCs and other well-known device platforms from different manufacturers such as Janztec, WAGO, Siemens or Phoenix Contact into CODESYS compatible controllers. =Fieldbus technology= Different field busses can be used directly in the programming system CODESYS. For this purpose, the tool integrates configurators for the most common system such as PROFIBUS, CANopen, EtherCAT, PROFINET and EtherNet/IP. For most of the mentioned systems, protocol stacks are available in the form of CODESYS libraries which can be loaded subsequently to the supported devices. In addition, the platform optionally supports application-specific communication protocols, such as BACnet or KNX for building automation. = Communication = For the exchange of data with other devices in control networks, CODESYS can seamlessly integrate and use communication protocols. These include proprietary protocols, standardized protocols in automation technology, such as OPC and OPC UA, standard protocols for serial and Ethernet interfaces as well as standard protocols of web technology, such as MQTT or https. The latter are also offered in the form of encapsulated libraries for simplified access to public clouds from AWS or Microsoft (Azure). =Visualization= An integrated editor helps the user create complex visualization masks directly in the programming system CODESYS and animate them based on application variables. To simplify the procedure, integrated visualization elements are available. An optional toolkit enables the user to create his own visualization elements. The masks created are, among others, used for application tests and commissioning during online operation of the programming system. With optional visualization clients, the created masks can also be used to operate the machine or plant, e.g. on controllers with integrated display (product name CODESYS TargetVisu), in an own portable runtime e.g. under Windows or Linux (product name CODESYS HMI) or in an HTML5-capable web browser (product name CODESYS WebVisu). For simplified use, a free Android app is available for Codesys WebVisu (product name CODESYS Web View). =Motion CNC Robotics= An optional modular solution for controlling complex movements with an IEC 61131-3 programmed controller is also completely integrated in the programming system CODESYS. The modular solution includes: * Editors for motion planning, e. g. with CAMs or DIN 66025 CNC descriptions *An axis group configurater for multiple robot kinematics * Library modules for decoder, interpolator, for program execution, e. g. according to PLCopen PLCopen MotionControl, for kinematical transformations and visualization templates =Safety= To reach the safety integrity level (SIL) required after a risk analysis, all system components have to comply to this level. Pre-certified software components within CODESYS make it much easier for device manufacturers to have their controllers SIL2 or SIL3 certified according IEC 61508. Therefore, CODESYS Safety consists of components within the programming system and the runtime system, whereas the project planning is completely integrated in the IEC 61131-3 programming environment. Users of control technology use the safety functions with devices that have already implemented CODESYS Safety. In addition, an add-on product is available with which the certified EtherCAT Safety Terminals from Beckhoff can be configured within the CODESYS Development System. = Automation Server = For the administration of compatible devices, an industry 4.0 platform is available, which allows, for example, the storage of projects in source and binary code via web browser and their download to connected devices. The platform is hosted in a public cloud. The communication between the cloud and the controllers is done through a special software Edge Gateway, whose security features have been rated A+ by SSL Labs. This connection can thus be used to communicate securely with devices integrated in the Automation Server without the need for additional VPN tunnels or firewalls, e.g. for displaying web visualizations or for debugging/updating the application software on the device.  Additional sources of information and assistance  Since 2012, the manufacturer has been operating an online forum in which users can communicate with each other. In 2020 it was transferred to the Q&A; platform \\"Codesys Talk\\", which is also used as an open platform for development projects (\\"CODESYS Forge\\"). An Android app is available to simplify the use of the platform (\\"CODESYS Forge\\") With the CODESYS Store, the manufacturer operates an online shop in which additional options and products are offered. The majority of the product offerings are free sample projects that make it easier to try out features and supported technologies. Similar to an \\"App-Shop\\" platform, users have the possibility to search and install the offered products and projects directly from the CODESYS Development System without leaving the platform. Industrial usage Over 400 device manufacturers from different industrial sectors offer intelligent automation devices with a CODESYS programming interface. These include devices from global players such as Schneider Electric, Beckhoff, WAGO or Festo, but also niche suppliers of industrial controllers. Consequently, more than 100,000 of end users such as machine or plant builders around the world employ CODESYS for all sorts of automation tasks. In the CODESYS Store alone, there are far more than 100,000 verified users registered (as of 01/2020). Due to its high degree of distribution, CODESYS can be called the market standard among the device-independent programming tools according to IEC 61131-3. For example, numerous educational institutions (commercial schools, colleges, universities) around the world use CODESYS in the training of control and automation technology.

History Based at Paya Lebar Air Base, 149 Squadron was inaugurated on 1 June 1985 as one of the RSAF's fighter squadrons operating in the interceptor role. The squadron initially operated the supersonic F-5E/F Tiger II fighter aircraft, before converting to the improved F-5S/T Tiger-IIs fighter aircraft in the early 1990s, these were retrofitted with new state-of-the-art avionics giving the aircraft capability of carrying out both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. On 5 April 2010, the squadron was re-inaugurated by Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean in an RSAF ceremony at Paya Lebar Air Base, with the arrival of five F-15SG strike fighters flown back the week before from Mountain Home Air Force Base in the United States. Information The tail is adorned with a beige checkered tailband. The squadron's logo is centered with the serial number on the base of the tail. Achievements The squadron found itself actively involved in several major multilateral exercises such as Exercise Bersama Shield and Bersama Lima under the ambit of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA), and Exercise Cope Tiger with the US and Thailand air forces in 2007. The squadron has also won the Best Fighter Squadron award in the Singapore Armed Forces Best Unit Competition eight times, in 1986, 1988, 2002, 2004, 2008, 2011, 2013 and 2018.

The film was released by Paramount Pictures and starred Joan Fontaine, Arturo de Córdova, Basil Rathbone, Cecil Kellaway, and Nigel Bruce. Filmed in Technicolor, it was directed by Mitchell Leisen. The musical score was by Victor Young, who incorporated the main theme of French composer Claude Debussy's Clair de Lune as the love theme for the film. The film is a mostly faithful adaptation of the novel, taking place during the reign of Charles II in the mid-17th century, mostly in the Cornish region of England.Frenchman's Creek (1944) Fontaine was under contract to independent producer to David O. Selznick, who loaned out his contract players to other studios. In this case, Fontaine was loaned to Paramount for this lavish production. She later complained about her work with director Leisen and some of her costars.Self-Styled Siren: Frenchman's Creek (1944) The film's budget of $3.6 million made it Paramount's most expensive production up to that time. Cast members Rathbone and Bruce were known for appearing together as Holmes and Dr. Watson, respectively, in the Sherlock Holmes films by Universal Studios. Frenchman's Creek was their only on-screen collaboration besides the Holmes films.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/75670/Frenchman-s- Creek/articles.html The film was released as an on demand DVD August 28, 2014 (Amazon); and has been shown on American Movie Classics and Turner Classic Movies. Plot summary Set in 17th century Cornwall and London, Joan Fontaine stars in the swashbuckling adventure Frenchman's Creek. As a beautiful, learned Lady of means, Dona St. Columb (Fontaine) had it all – wealth, nobility, children ... and a loveless marriage. After years of being royally subjected to mistreatment, she retreats with her most prized possessions – her two children – to a secluded manor overlooking Britain's Atlantic shoreline. Once there, she is enthralled with the tall tales of a scoundrel of a pirate, who has been plundering nearby coastal villages. Full of adventure and fueled by years of neglect, she sets forth to seek him out, and it is not long before she finds him ... to be quite an irresistible gentleman. She is soon swept into his arms, and out onto a seaborne adventure where she chances death to protect her children from a vengeful father, who is out to reclaim what he had never known and to destroy something he had never shown – love. Earning Academy Awards for both Art Direction and Set Design, movie lovers will delight in this lavish Technicolor example of golden age Hollywood escapism.

The list includes all commonly accepted genera, but also genera that are now considered invalid, doubtful (nomina dubia), or were not formally published (nomina nuda), as well as junior synonyms of more established names, and genera that are no longer considered amphibians. Modern forms are excluded from this list. The list currently includes 454 names. Naming conventions and terminology Naming conventions and terminology follow the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Technical terms used include: * Junior synonym: A name which describes the same taxon as a previously published name. If two or more genera are formally designated and the type specimens are later assigned to the same genus, the first to be published (in chronological order) is the senior synonym, and all other instances are junior synonyms. Senior synonyms are generally used, except by special decision of the ICZN, but junior synonyms cannot be used again, even if deprecated. Junior synonymy is often subjective, unless the genera described were both based on the same type specimen. *Nomen nudum (Latin for \\"naked name\\"): A name that has appeared in print but has not yet been formally published by the standards of the ICZN. Nomina nuda (the plural form) are invalid, and are therefore not italicized as a proper generic name would be. If the name is later formally published, that name is no longer a nomen nudum and will be italicized on this list. Often, the formally published name will differ from any nomina nuda that describe the same specimen. *Nomen oblitum (Latin for \\"forgotten name\\"): A name that has not been used in the scientific community for more than fifty years after its original proposal. *Preoccupied name: A name that is formally published, but which has already been used for another taxon. This second use is invalid (as are all subsequent uses) and the name must be replaced. As preoccupied names are not valid generic names, they will also go unitalicized on this list. *Nomen dubium (Latin for \\"dubious name\\"): A name describing a fossil with no unique diagnostic features. As this can be an extremely subjective and controversial designation, this term is not used on this list.

Membership is open to all health care providers committed to improving the care of patients with serious or life-threatening illnesses. AAHPM has more than 5,200 members; 82 percent are physicians, 12 percent are nurses or other health care providers and 6 percent are residents or students. AAHPM started a patient website to help educate the public on the importance of hospice and palliative care.  Background  AAHPM was founded in 1988, with 250 charter members, as the Academy of Hospice Physicians (The Academy). Josefina B. Magno, MD, president of the International Hospice Institute and Gerald Holman, MD, director of St. Anthony's Hospice and Life Enrichment Center met to discuss the formation of The Academy. During the next few years, members worked to build the association by educating people on the importance of hospice care through newsletters and position statements. The Academy worked on publishing a quarterly newsletter and a physician self-study series. In 1994, The Academy was awarded a grant from the National Cancer Institute to develop a book series. The American Board of Hospice and Palliative Medicine was incorporated by the Academy in May 1996. They offered their first certifying exam later that year. The Academy gained approval from the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), which allowed it to provide CME to physicians. The Academy also changed its name to the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM). By the turn of the century, AAHPM's membership grew, and it secured a seat in the American Medical Association (AMA) House of Delegates. AAHPM's strong presence and position on highly controversial subjects has made the Academy a prominent voice in hospice and palliative care. In 2003, AAHPM was able to develop its infrastructure and establish the College of Palliative Care with a $1.2-million grant from Open Society Institute's Project on Death in America.  Position statements  AAHPM tracks critical issues and provides members with the information, tools, and training required to be effective advocates for their patients and their practice. In recent years, AAHPM has promoted policies that would increase the number of palliative medicine specialists, expand support for research, and improve access to palliative care services for patients with serious illness and their families.  Publications  The Academy publishes a variety of resources for hospice and palliative care professionals, including: UNIPAC Self-Study Program: A Resource for Hospice and Palliative Care Professionals, Primer of Palliative Care, Hospice Medical Director Manual, and online practice tests: HPM PASS, HPM FAST and HMD PREP. Educational offerings AAHPM, together with the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association (HPNA), sponsors an educational conference each year. The Annual Assembly provides disease updates and sessions on the latest advances in clinical research, cultural, ethical and legal, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of care for physicians, nurses, social workers, pharmacists, and others who practice hospice and palliative care.

The Montagnards were a member of the Federal Amateur Hockey League (FAHL), set up as a rival to the CAHL from 1904 until 1908. The club had little success in its first two seasons. In 1906-07, the Montagnards were leading the FAHL league, but after the Cornwall team used two professionals from the Montreal Shamrocks, the club protested the game. The protest was lost and the Montagnards resigned from the league to protect their amateur status. The team would return to the league for one final season, the next season. At the end of the 1907-08 FAHL season, the FAHL became a professional league and the Montagnards left the league to continue as an amateur team.

Stephen Moore, 3rd Earl Mount Cashell (20 May 1792 – 10 October 1883), styled Lord Kilworth until 1822, was an Anglo-Irish aristocrat and politician who spent much of his life in what is now Canada. Background and education Lord Kilworth was born in Dublin, Ireland, the son of Stephen Moore, 2nd Earl Mount Cashell and Margaret King, daughter of Robert King, 2nd Earl of Kingston. His mother's views on the education and treatment of children had been formed by her time as a pupil of Mary Wollstonecraft. He was a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge. Career Lord Mount Cashell spent some time in Switzerland and married in 1819 Anna Marie Wyse/Wyss (c. 1793-1876) of Berne. The couple then lived for a time in Frankfurt, Germany and would have four daughters and three sons. In 1826 he was elected an Irish Representative Peer and was able to take a seat in the House of Lords.leighrayment.com Representative Peers - Ireland In 1833 the family left Europe for British North America and settled in Lobo Township in the London District, Upper Canada (later Lobo Township in Middlesex County, Ontario). Using the services of an agent Lord Mount Cashell purchased from the estate of the late Captain John Matthews, an Upper Canadian politician and former officer in the Royal Artillery who had come to British North America in the retinue of Governor-General Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond. Settling on the former Matthews' estate Mount Cashell built – by Upper Canadian standards – a large home for his family and servants. During his time in Upper Canada (later Canada West and then Ontario) he sometimes ran foul of local authorities by asserting his rights as an elected representative peer in the Irish Peerage. Local folklore indicates that Mount Cashell had a propensity to use a pistol to shoot at flies who infiltrated his home. On October 1, 1865 Mount Cashell's lawyer, H.C.R. Becher, based at nearby London, Ontario, confided in his diary that \\"The Earl of Mountcashell dines with me often. He is a troublesome client, rather amusing as a guest at first, but in the main a bore.\\" Various members of the family travelled between Britain and the lands in British North America and Mount Cashell's daughter-in-law, Jane Dance, wife of the Hon.

By 1870 the family had wound up its dealings in the country and returned to Britain. Mount Cashell was said, when between 85 and 90, to have been engaged to marry a Miss Kennedy. He died ín Paddington, London, aged 91 in October 1883 and was succeeded by his son Stephen Moore, 4th Earl Mount Cashell (1825–1889) who was in turn succeeded by his younger brother Charles William Moore, 5th Earl Mount Cashell (1826–1898).

The term 'local' means that this prison holds people on remand to the local courts. Elmley once formed part of the Sheppey prisons cluster, which included HMP Standford Hill and HMP Swaleside; it is now a stand-alone establishment. The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. History Elmley is a purpose built prison opened in 1992, and is one of six Bullingdon design prisons in England. A new Category C Unit was opened at the prison in 1997, making Elmley the largest of the three prisons within the Sheppey Cluster. In 2000, Elmley Prison had a serious infestation of fleas, affecting both inmates and staff at the prison. In a 2001 investigation, Elmley prison was employing drug dealers to smuggle large amounts of cocaine into the prison. In a 2003 report Elmley Prison was praised for making noticeable improvements, despite being overcrowded. However the report also raised concerns about the number of prisoners who were being held two together in cells designed for one. The report also highlighted the lack of resources for dealing with foreign nationals in the prison. The problem of overcrowding at Elmley Prison was highlighted again in 2004 in a report from the Independent Monitoring Board. The report also criticised Emley for its staff shortages which meant that prisoners had less time out of their cells. Overcrowding was identified as a key concern again in a report in 2007 on Elmley Prison. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons report stated support for prisoners in the early days of custody in Elmley was \\"seriously compromised\\" because of \\"acute population pressures\\" In June 2014, three prison officers were assaulted, two receiving serious injuries which required hospital treatment. In November 2014, a prisoner at the prison had been found dead on the day a damning report highlighted staff shortages and overcrowding at the jail. His death was the seventh in custody at the Kent jail that year. On 3 December 2014, another prisoner was found dead in his cell at the prison – the third in as many weeks. The prison today Elmley Prison holds unsentenced and sentenced adult men and unsentenced male young offenders from all of the courts in the county of Kent. Accommodation at the prison comprises five House Blocks holding between 183 and 240 prisoners each in single, double and treble cells. A sixth House Block has recently opened and houses the remaining 282 prisoners. Education at the prison concentrates on improving key and basic skills as well as Information Technology, Art, ESOL and Employment skills courses. The PE department offers a range of qualifications and in conjunction with Charlton Athletic F.C., offers a range of football qualifications. In addition the prison works with the local primary care trust to offer Health trainer Qualifications and Social Care NVQ. Daily employment is also available at Elmley in horticulture, environmental services and recycling, production workshops, laundry, industrial cleaning and catering. Vocational training qualifications are offered in virtually all work areas. There is a staffed visitors centre at Elmley Prison. Facilities include an unsupervised children's play area and a canteen. Canteen facilities also available in visits room.

While there, Hilali enrolled in Al-Azhar University only to drop out after being disappointed with the curriculum. Instead, Hilali spent time under the tutelage of Rashid Rida,Interview with Dr. Taqi ud-Din al-Hilali with The True Call, official magazine of the Moroccan Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs. 26 Rajab, 1429 Hijri.Dr. Mohammed Amrani Hanchi, How I came to know Dr. Al-Hilali? at Civilizationist Dialogue.

Responding to a call by Muslim Brotherhood founder Hassan al-Banna for Muslim intellectuals of Morocco to share ideas with those elsewhere, Hilali wrote a number of letters to the organization's magazine which were intercepted by authorities of the French colonial empire. Arrested and held for three days without charge, Hilali's release was secured and he fled Morocco. Shortly after he escaped the country, he was sentenced to death in absentia for subversive activity against the French protectorate of Morocco. =In Asia and Europe= After performing the pilgrimage to Mecca, Hilali moved to India in order to pursue Hadith studies. While there, he worked as head of Arabic studies at Darul-uloom Nadwatul Ulama in Lucknow. After completing his study in India, Hilali spent three years in Iraq before being personally invited by first King of Saudi Arabia Ibn Saud to teach in the Muslim holy land. Hilali taught and led the prayer in Medina at Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, Islam's second holiest site, for two years and taught in Mecca at Masjid al-Haram, Islam's most holy site, for one more year. After finishing his duration of teaching in Mecca, Hilali enrolled in Baghdad University; he also served as an assistant professor while there. Hilali returned briefly to India for a second time, and enrolled in the University of Lucknow as both a student and a teacher, the most prominent of his own being Abul Hasan Ali Hasani Nadwi. Shakib Arslan, who was a close friend of Hilali, went through a contact at the German Foreign Office and helped Hilali enroll (again, both as a student and a teacher) at the University of Bonn.Fifth page of the biography from Hilali's official website. =Return to Morocco, then Iraq, then Morocco, then Saudi Arabia, then Morocco= Toward the end of World War II, Hilali left Germany for French Morocco, which was rocked with calls for independence. He returned to Iraq in 1947, once again taking up a teaching position at the university in Baghdad. After the 14 July Revolution, Hilali returned to a now-independent Kingdom of Morocco one more time. He was appointed to a teaching position at Mohammed V University in Rabat in 1959 and later at a branch in Fes. In 1968, Saudi Arabian Grand Mufti Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz wrote to Hilali requesting that he take up a teaching position at Islamic University of Madinah, of which Bin Baz was the president. Hilali accepted, living in Saudi Arabia for one more time between 1968 and 1974. In 1974, Hilali permanently retired from teaching, moving to Meknes initially and later to Casablanca, where he owned a house. Hilali died at June 22, 1987 (25th of Shawal in the year 1408 AH).Biography of Taqi ud-Din al-Hilali on Subul as-Salam He was buried in the neighborhood of Sbata. Reception Views on Hilali within the Muslim world itself - specifically within Sunni Islam- have been positive. Algerian national hero Abdelhamid Ben Badis, in particular, considered Hilali to be one of the most knowledgeable Muslim clerics of their era. Hilali was criticized by a number of Muslim scholars and Western academics due to his translation of the Qur'an. Dr. Ahmed Farouk Musa, an academician at Monash University, considered the Hilali-Khan translation as being a major cause of extremism and a work of propaganda distributed by Saudi religious authorities with money from its oil- rich government. Similarly, Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, head of Bethesda's Minaret of Freedom Institute, has claimed that the translation is a Wahabi rendering of the Qur'an and is not accepted by Muslims in the US. Additionally, Khaled Abou El Fadl and Khaleel Mohammed criticized Hilali's translation as being a distortion of the meaning of the Qur'anKhaled Abou El Fadl: Corrupting God's Book, in Conference of the BooksKhaleel Mohammed: Assessing English Translations of the Qur'an A number of academics have also criticized the Hilali-Khan translation on stylistic and linguistic grounds. Dr William S. Peachy, an American professor of English at College of Medicine, King Saud University at Qasseem considered the translation \\"repulsive\\" and rejected by anyone outside of Saudi Arabia. Dr. Abdel-Haleem, Arabic Professor at SOAS, London University, noted that he found the Hilali-Khan translation \\"repelling\\". The Director of King Fahd International Centre for Translation, King Saud University, Riyad, Dr. A. Al-Muhandis, expressed his dissatisfaction with the translation’s style and language, being too poor and simplistic. Works Hilali worked with Muhammad Muhsin Khan in the English translation of the meanings of the Qur'an and Sahih Al-Bukhari. Their translation of the Qur'an has been described as ambitious, incorporating commentary from Tafsir al-Tabari, Tafsir ibn Kathir, Tafsir al-Qurtubi and Sahih al-Bukhari.Brannon Wheeler, Prophets in the Quran: An Introduction to the Quran and Muslim Exegesis, pg. 366. London: Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002. It has also been criticized for inserting the interpretations of the Wahabi school directly into the English rendition of the Qur'an. It has been accused of inculcating Muslims and potential Muslims with militant interpretations of Islam through parenthesis, as teachings of the Qur'an itself. Personal life Hilali was an adherent of the Zahirite school of Islamic law according to his children and students. Administrators of his website edited his biography to remove all references to his adherence to the school, with which modern-day Zahirites took issue. Hilali practiced polygyny, having married five women during his international travel. He married an Algerian woman, two Saudi women while living in Mecca, an Iraqi woman during the first time he lived in Iraq, a German woman whose first husband was Jewish and whom he protected from the Nazis while he lived in Germany, three Moroccan women. He fathered one daughter with his Algerian wife, two daughters with his Saudi wife(s), a son and a daughter with his Iraqi wife and, one son with his German wife. He has no children with his Moroccan wife.

In his most book, The present State of Culture in Egypt, Andil points out that Egyptians have attempted to change their national identity and language as well as their national religion since embracing Christianity in the 1st century AD and again after the Arab conquest of Egypt in 641 AD. Andil claims that Egyptians have Egyptianized both Christianity and Islam and argues that the true Egyptian spirit survived only in the oral culture of the illiterate Egyptians, whose illiteracy has protected them and their national identity from annihilation. Andil also published many articles and books in which he proposed that Modern Masri Egyptian language is nothing but the fourth stage of the languages of the Egyptians and should not truly be considered a variety of Arabic, but rather a linguistic evolution of the Coptic language and the ancient Egyptian language. The grammatical, morphological and phonological differences between the spoken Egyptian language and the Arabic language is sufficiently disparate to categorize them into two distinct groups, and the similarities between the first and its Egyptian ancestors, both Coptic and ancient Egyptian, are strong enough to consider the modern Masri Egyptian language an evolution of ancient Egyptian. Since the 1980s, Andil's work focused on promoting the revival of Egyptian nationalism. Despite Andil's admiration for Taha Hussein, an intellectual of the Egyptian enlightenment movement in the first half of the 20th century, Andil criticised Hussein’s publication, Mustaqbal al-Thaqafa fi Misr or (The Future of Culture in Egypt), as Andil perceived it fell short of adequately defining Egyptian culture.  Celebration of plurality  Andil argued that the culture of a nation is the sum total of the value systems created by its people over the entire course of the nation's history. He believed that Egyptian culture is the outcome of an agriculture-based civilisation and that Egyptian forefathers were the first to establish the solar calendar, the bases of medicine and geometry. In his books delineating the achievements of the Egyptians, Andil quoted James H. Breasted to support his hypothesis that the ancient Egyptians were the first to create a system of writing, in addition to referring to the arguments of linguistics scholar Simon Potter over the leading role of the Egyptian alphabet. Andil focused on plurality as an important dimension of Egyptian culture. Egyptian myths referred to a host of gods. Followers of different gods used to hold festivals to celebrate them. Yet these festivals were universal; the followers of Osiris celebrated Ra and the other way round while followers of Amon sanctified Isis. Cairenes celebrate Mulid al-Sayed al-Badawi of Tanta, while Alexandrians celebrate Mulid Abul-Haggag of Luxor. By the same token, Muslims celebrate the Coptic Mulids such as those held to commemorate the Holy Virgin or St Barsoum al- Erian. Such manifestations of plurality promote the value of recognising and accepting the other. There was no room for such value under Akhnaton, who, by calling for the exclusive worship of one god (Aton), became the founder of the culture of takfir (considering those different in religion as infidels) prevailing in most Arab and Muslim societies. Yet Akhnaton is commonly revered as the father of monotheism.  A gentle people  Among the cultural norms stressed in Andil’s writing was the respect of women. Unlike the region’s other peoples, Egyptians were distinguished by the appreciation of women. The attributes of Sayeda Zeinab, the granddaughter of the Prophet Mohamed—had their source in those of Isis. The same could be said about her brother al- Hussein whose attributes had much in common with those of Osiris. Although Egyptian culture changed in many ways over the ages, certain features survived. The first is tolerance, a characteristic of agriculture-based societies, and the second is plurality which led Herodotus to describe ancient Egyptians as the most pious people. Centuries later, Sigmund Freud conceived of Egyptians as a gentle people, while he considered Semites wild and savage. Plurality in turn led to the promotion of equality between men and women. Yet there was a setback in terms of the status of women with the advent of the Romans and later the Arabs. Andil has a telling story to confirm his view of the inherent gentleness of Egyptians. He heard the story from a Palestinian friend who was living in Gaza during the Israeli invasion in 1956. When Jewish soldiers of Egyptian origin inspected her home, they caused no harm to the family, on the contrary quelling the family’s fears. One of the soldiers gently told her grandmother: “Don’t be afraid, mother, and don’t bother to get up. Stay where you are”. Iraqi Jew soldiers, by contrast, stormed her neighbours’ house and wreaked havoc in their home and committed horrible crimes.  Out of the dark tunnel  Egyptian culture affected Quran tajweed (the way of chanting Quranic verses). Sheikh Mohammed Refaat used the oriental Nahawand scale in the tajweed while Sheikh Mustafa Ismail used the Bayaty scale. Andil was a staunch defender of illiterate Egyptians for the role they played in preserving and transmitting Egyptian culture from one generation to the next. Educated people connived with the Anglo-Americans to Arabise Egypt. Reactionary ideas and values were accordingly promoted and this climate bred millions of terrorists who antagonise those who believe in other religions. Andil concluded that the only way out of this dark tunnel is to revive the Egyptian nationality. Iranians, for instance, accepted Islam, but never accepted Arabism. They are proud of their pre-Islamic heroes, myths and gods. The same could be said about Finnish people who liberated themselves from the Swedish culture thanks to their intellectuals who spared no effort to revive the national heritage of the country. Indians preserved their culture in the face of the Mongols, while the great Spanish people under Queen Isabella liberated their country from the Arab invaders.

The first group of fathers reached Lhasa (Tibet) in 1707 and began Church work there. For nearly 41 years the Capuchin Fathers worked in Lhasa until a religious persecution forced them to give up their mission and move to Kathmandu (Nepal) in 1745. Nepal had seen the Capuchin Fathers working with varying success in Kathmandu since 1715. A new conqueror of Kathmandu valley, Raja Pritvi Narayan, who was not sympathetic to the Fathers stopped all support to them. The Mission of Nepal was also abandoned in 1769, and the Fathers with 62 Nepalese Christians and five catechumens moved to India. The Nepalese Christians and catechumens settled down at Chuhari near Bettiah. The scene of the capuchin Mission shifted now to the Indian soil. Fr Joseph Mary ofm cap, a saintly priest, founded the Bettiah Mission in 1745 after the King of Bettiah, Raja Druva Singh had obtained permission from Pope Benedict XIV. Rome erected the Prefecture of Tibet-Hindustan into a Vicariate in 1812. In 1827 an Independent Patna Vicariate was created, comprising Bettiah, Chuhari, Patna City, Dinapore, Bhagalpur, Darjeeling, Sikkim, Nepal, and adjacent territories. The saintly Anastasius Hartmann, was appointed its first Vicar Apostolic. With a Decree of Pope Leo XIII Patna Vicariate became a part of Allahabad diocese in 1886. The North Bihar Mission with its four stations of Bettiah, Chuhari, Chakhani and Latonah was entrusted to the Tyrolese Capuchins in 1886. In May 1892 the North Bihar Mission was made Bettiah - Nepal Prefecture with Fr Hilarion of Abtei, ofm cap, as its first Prefect. In 1919 this Prefecture was dissolved and joined to South Bihar to form the present Diocese of Patna. Pope Benedict XV by a Decree on 10 September 1919 divided the Diocese of Allahabad into two. The Diocese of Patna was thus created. The Prefecture of Bettiah- Nepal was annexed to the new diocese. The Holy See entrusted Patna diocese to American Missouri Province of the Society of Jesus. Later, on 13 November 1930, after the division of Missouri Province, Patna diocese was entrusted to the Chicago Province of the Society of Jesus. Louis Van Hoeck, a Belgian Jesuit, was ordained the first Bishop of Patna on 6 March 1921. The Third Order Regular (T.O.R.) Franciscan Fathers from Pennsylvania, USA came to Patna diocese to assist the Jesuits in 1938. The mission stations of Bhagalpur, Gokhla, Poreyahat and Godda were assigned to them. In 1956 Bhagalpur was made a Prefecture and in 1965 it was created a Diocese with Msgr Urban Mc Garry, T.O.R., as its First Bishop. The forbidden Kingdom of Nepal was once again open for Fathers in 1951, thanks to the efforts of Fr. Marshall D. Moran, S.J. Nepal was made an independent ecclesiastical unit in 1984 and Fr. Antony Sharma, S.J. was appointed as its First Mission Superior. On 28 March 1980, Pope John Paul II, accepted the resignation of Bishop Augustine Wildermuth S.J., and divided the Patna diocese into two units: Patna and Muzzaffarpur. Fr Benedict J Osta S.J., was appointed Bishop of Patna. The Diocese of Patna comprises in the State of Bihar, the Districts of Patna, Nalanda, Nawadah, Gaya, Aurangabad, Rohtas, Jehanabad, Bhojpur, Bhabhua, Buxar and part of Munger.

It was originally founded in 1919 as the National Morris Plan Bankers Association and changed its name to the Consumer Bankers Association in 1947. Organization The Consumer Bankers Association (CBA) was founded in 1919 and is headquartered in Washington, D.C. The CBA primarily represents retail banks in the U.S. with approximately $10 billion or more in assets. Membership ranges from national banks to regional banks, including both industrial and commercial banks. Corporate member institutions of the CBA account for 1.6 million jobs in America. History The Consumer Bankers Association originated as an association formed to promote Morris Plan Banks. Arthur J. Morris started the Morris Plan Banking system to make bank loans accessible for ordinary people without business affiliation. \\"Morris Plan\\" was a licensed name for “industrial banks”, a term to describe banks with a heavy focus on consumer credit. In 1919, the National Morris Plan Bankers Association formed with the aim of promoting the banks. Thomas Coughlin, previously President of Morris Plan Bank of Cleveland, was made the first president of the new association. The organization's name changed to Consumer Bankers Association in 1947. Leadership Joe Belew was president from 1987 until his death in 2009. The CBA named an award after him to present to banks with impactful programs serving consumers. Richard Hunt was selected as president and CEO in May of 2009. Annual conference The CBA holds an annual conference for its members in various cities each spring. Locations have included Washington, D.C., Phoenix, Arizona, and Orlando, Florida. In 2010, the organization created CBA LIVE to combine multiple conferences into a single three-day event. The conference focuses on retail banking with various educational tracks. Activities=Lobbying and regulation= The CBA lobbies on behalf of its members on legislation and policies focused on the banking industry. Its lobbying activities are mainly focused on coordinating regulations of banks and the transparency of federal student loans. The CBA has advocated for the increase of student loans from private banks rather than direct federal loans, as well as tuition loan caps from government issued loans to individual graduate students and parents of undergraduates. The organization lobbied in support of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which included terms to revisit current bank regulations. In August 2018, the CBA announced their support in the revising of the Community Reinvestment Act. The CBA represents consumers and retail banks in discussion of regulation of retail banks and loan products with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In 2018, the CBA criticized the CFPB's public access database of complaints on the basis of consumer privacy. The CBA also urged congress to create a bipartisan commission to manage CFPB. =Educational programs= The Consumer Bankers Association established and operates the CBA Executive Banking School. The school began in 1952 as the School of Consumer Banking with courses focused on consumer credit, and was later known as the Graduate School of Consumer Banking as well as the Graduate School for Retail Banking Management. Classes were previously held in Charlottesville, Virginia at the University of Virginia. The core areas of education offered by the CBA include functional bank management, human resources management, financial statements, consumer banking services, economics, marketing, and thesis preparation. As of July 2008, the CBA and the Bank Administration Institute combined their individual banking schools to create the CBA/BAI Graduate School of Retail Bank Management. The partnership between CBA and BAI ended and, in 2015, the school was renamed CBA Executive Banking School. Classes are held at Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. In 2002, the school established the Tem Wooldridge Award, named for a retired faculty member. The annual award is presented to a graduating senior selected by peers for excellence in integrity, academics and leadership.

Life At the age of seventeen he entered the Society of Jesus (4 Oct, 1657). Till the year 1674, when he pronounced his final vows, his services were in various capacities, particularly teaching. From this date his abilities directed towards preaching and evangelism. Works In the later part of his life he gave himself up almost exclusively to literary activity. The following is a list of his works: *\\"Exercise de la vie spirituelle\\" (Paris, 1701); *\\"De la Présence de Dieu qui renferme tous les principes de la vie intérieure\\" (Paris, 1703, 1709, 1731; Marseilles, 1827); *\\"Méthode de bien prier\\" (Paris, 1710, 1769); *\\"Pratique de la vie intérieure\\", etc. (Paris, 1710); *\\"Instruction sur la Confession et la Communion\\" (Paris, 1710; printed with preceding work in Paris edition of 1713): *\\"Sermon de Norte Seigneur à ses apôtres aprés la Céne, avec des réflections\\" (Paris, 1712); *\\"Nouvelle retaite de huit jours à l'usage des personnes de monde et du cloître\\" (Paris, 1736). To the above, almost all the biographies add another work, a French translation of the influential devotional text The Imitation of Christ by Thomas à Kempis. The first edition of this translation bears the title \\"L'Imitation de Jesus-Christ, Traduction nouvelle: Avec une Pratique et une Piére à la fin de chaque Chapitre (Par. le R. P. de Gonnelieu, de la Compagnie de Jésus, Paris and Nancy, 1712)\\"; but a great majority of the bibliographies, somewhat arbitrarily, deny that Traduction (translation), as distinct from the secours (helps) at the end of each chapter, is by de Gonnelieu. The opinion of the negative critics seems to be based mainly on the statement of Calmet (op. cit. below) that \\"the translation is by John-Baptiste Cusson [printer at Nancy], and the rest by P. Gonnelieu\\".The most approved form of this theory is that which attributes the rendering , as made originally, to Jean Cusson, printer at Paris, and clerk to the Parliament, who, in his version published in 1673, had availed himself largely of the celebrated translation by Sacy. John-Baptiste Cusson, a man of culture and fine literary sense, after thoroughly revising and improving his father's work, had issued the amended version at Nancy in 1712. Gence, author of a notice on the principle French translations of \\"Imitation\\" (Journal des curés, Sept. 1810), substantially maintained this view; see also Barbier and Brunet (op cit, below). The \\"Journal des Sçavans\\", on the other hand, in a review written within one year after the publication of the work, whilst praising the zeal and piety of the translator, says expressly that the version is by P. Gonnelieu; and adds that \\"Sieur Cusson (one time printer of the Journal) has enriched this first edition by many copper-plates\\".The testimony of the \\"Mémoirs de Trévoux\\" (see below) for August, 1713, is almost identical with the preceding; and in the same notice it is stated that \\"the name of P. de Gonnelieu was a 'préjugé infallible' in favour of the excellence of the work\\".

Overview Barsad is a turncoat, English con-man, and spy and partner of Roger Cly. In the pay of the Marquis St. Evremonde, he initially frames the Marquis' nephew, Charles Darnay by planting evidence on him on a voyage across the English Channel to England. Roger Cly, also revealed to be a spy, fakes his death and flees England, but Jerry Cruncher discovers the fraud when he attempts to 'resurrect' Cly's body for the purpose of selling the body to doctors. Cruncher initially blames his wife's praying and thinks Roger Cly has been removed through spiritual means. When Carton discovers Barsad in Paris much later (and revealed to be Miss Pross' long-lost brother Solomon), he enlists Barsad's aid by blackmailing him to get into the prison to rescue Charles Darnay by changing places with him leading to Carton's eventual execution by guillotine. Barsad then brings Darnay out of the prison and back to his family. He is genuinely dumbfounded by Carton’s sacrifice - though not enough to change his own ways. In the final prophetic chapter, Barsad, along with many others, is revealed to die by the guillotine sometime in the future. Analysis Barsad is described in Book 2, Chapter 3 of A Tale of Two Cities as \\"one of the greatest scoundrels upon the earth since accursed Judas-which he certainly did look rather like.\\" This is a direct reference to Judas Iscariot, the man who betrayed Jesus Christ in the Bible, and is explaining that Barsad is a very untrustworthy man.

History With a land area of 11,348 square kilometers, the Archdiocese of Pondicherry- Cuddalore extends over the Pondicherry and Karaikal civil districts of Puducherry union territory and the civil districts of Cuddalore and Viluppuram of Tamil Nadu state. In 2001, the total population of the area was 6,151,891. Ethnic groups in the territory include the Tamils and French. =The Mission of The Capuchins And The Jesuits = French Capuchins were the first missionaries to Pondicherry in 1632. But they established the first Christian stable mission only in 1674. The great ancestor of this Archdiocese is the Carnatic Mission, which was started around the year 1700 as Mission sui iuris. This Carnatic Mission was known as Missions of the Coromandel Coast and also as the Malabar Mission. Before the establishment of the Carnatic Mission in 1700, the Jesuit Fathers of the Madurai Mission, especially John de Britto, entered the Gingee kingdom after 1660, and preached the Gospel up to the Palar River, south of Madras. Members of various religious orders, looked after the spiritual needs of the European communities in their trading centres along the coastal areas, including Cuddalore and Porto Novo. The French Capuchins first settled in Pondicherry in 1674 and the French Jesuits, expelled from Siam also took refuge with the Capuchins in Pondicherry in 1688. But, in 1693, the Dutch chased away all the religious groups from Pondicherry, and they were only able to return in 1699. While the Capuchins were looking after the Europeans in Pondicherry, the French Jesuits organized the Carnatic Mission for the Indian people. =The Boundaries Of the Carnatic Mission= The boundaries of the Carnatic mission were as follows: * To the south and west, the Pennaiyar River, beyond which were the Madurai and Mysore missions * To the east, the Bay of Bengal * To the north, Kurnool, including the Krishna and Godavari areas near the coast. =Jesuits Replaced By Foreign Mission Fathers= The continual wars in the 18th century, the ruin of Pondicherry town in 1761 and the suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773, badly hit the vast Carnatic Mission. In 1776, the French Jesuit fathers were replaced at the order of Rome by the foreign Mission French Fathers. Although the Bishop of these new missionaries had all the power of jurisdiction, he was not given the title \\"Vicar Apostolic\\", but instead called the \\"Superior of the Mission of the Coromandel Coast.\\" Rome successively gave him the jurisdiction over the Madurai, Coimbatore and Mysore areas, affected by the suppression of the Society of Jesus. By 1800, the extent of the Carnatic Mission was immense, but the labourers were very few. =The First Vicar Apostolic And The First Archbishop= The Carnatic Mission was reorganized when new apostolic vicariates were created: Madras in 1832, Madurai in 1836, and the vicariates of Visakhapatnam, Mysore and Coimbatore in 1845. Pondicherry became an apostolic vicariate of the Coromandel coast, on 1 September 1836, with Mgr. Bonnand as its first vicar apostolic. This apostolic vicariate was raised to an archbishopric on 1 September 1886, with Mgr. Laouenan as the first archbishop. Subsequently, subdivisions of the archdiocese took place, creating the new dioceses of Kumbakonam in 1899 and Salem in 1930. In 1928 a great part of the present diocese of Vellore was separated from Pondicherry and attached to the archdiocese of Madras and Mylapore. On a reorganisation of the archdiocese by Rome in 1969, the Madurantagam taluk of Kanchipuram district was transferred to Madras, and Tiruvannamalai taluk to Vellore . =The Final Formation= As the archdiocese of Pondicherry extended over the Pondicherry union territory and the South Arcot district of Madras State, on 7 August 1953 it was given a new title by Rome: the \\"Archdiocese of Pondicherry and Cuddalore\\". Originally, the archdiocese included the former French settlements of Pondicherry, Karaikal, Chandannagar, Mahe, and Yanam. Another ex-French settlement was also looked after by the MSFS Fathers in Visakhapatnam. Chandannagar was re-allocated to the archdiocese of Calcutta, now Kolkata, and Mahé to the Kerala diocese of Calicut, now Kozhikode, in 1949. The present archdiocese of Pondicherry and Cuddalore extends over the Pondicherry and Karaikal districts of Puducherry and the Cuddalore (excluding Chidambaram and Kattumannarkoil taluks) and Viluppuram districts of Tamil Nadu.

Two Point Stencil Example The two point stencil for the first derivative of a function is given by: f'(x_0)=\\\\frac{f\\\\left(x_0 + h\\\\right) - f\\\\left(x_0 - h\\\\right)}{2h} + O\\\\left(h^2\\\\right) . This is obtained from the Taylor series expansion of the first derivative of the function given by: \\\\begin{array} {l} f'(x_0)=\\\\frac{f\\\\left(x_0 + h\\\\right) - f(x_0)}{h} -\\\\frac{f^{(2)}(x_0)}{2!}h - \\\\frac{f^{(3)}(x_0)}{3!}h^2 - \\\\frac{f^{(4)}(x_0)}{4!}h^3 + \\\\cdots \\\\end{array}. Replacing h with -h, we have: \\\\begin{array} {l} f'(x_0)=-\\\\frac{f\\\\left(x_0 - h\\\\right) - f(x_0)}{h} + \\\\frac{f^{(2)}(x_0)}{2!}h - \\\\frac{f^{(3)}(x_0)}{3!}h^2 + \\\\frac{f^{(4)}(x_0)}{4!}h^3 + \\\\cdots \\\\end{array}. Addition of the above two equations together results in the cancellation of the terms in odd powers of h: \\\\begin{array} {l} 2f'(x_0)= \\\\frac{f\\\\left(x_0 + h\\\\right) - f(x_0)}{h} -\\\\frac{f\\\\left(x_0 - h\\\\right) - f(x_0)}{h} -2\\\\frac{f^{(3)}(x_0)}{3!}h^2 + \\\\cdots \\\\end{array}. \\\\begin{array} {l} f'(x_0)= \\\\frac{f\\\\left(x_0 + h\\\\right) - f\\\\left(x_0 - h\\\\right)}{2h} - \\\\frac{f^{(3)}(x_0)}{3!}h^2 + \\\\cdots \\\\end{array}. \\\\begin{array} {l} f'(x_0)= \\\\frac{f\\\\left(x_0 + h\\\\right) - f\\\\left(x_0 - h\\\\right)}{2h} + O\\\\left(h^2\\\\right) \\\\end{array}. Three Point Stencil Example For example, the three point stencil for the second derivative of a function is given by: \\\\begin{array} {l} f^{(2)}(x_0)= \\\\frac{f\\\\left(x_0 + h\\\\right) + f\\\\left(x_0 - h\\\\right) - 2f(x_0)}{h^2} + O\\\\left(h^2\\\\right) \\\\end{array}.

Replacing h with -h, we have: \\\\begin{array} {l} f'(x_0)=-\\\\frac{f\\\\left(x_0 - h\\\\right) - f(x_0)}{h} + \\\\frac{f^{(2)}(x_0)}{2!}h - \\\\frac{f^{(3)}(x_0)}{3!}h^2 + \\\\frac{f^{(4)}(x_0)}{4!}h^3 + \\\\cdots \\\\end{array}. Subtraction of the above two equations results in the cancellation of the terms in even powers of h: \\\\begin{array} {l} 0= \\\\frac{f\\\\left(x_0 + h\\\\right) - f(x_0)}{h} +\\\\frac{f\\\\left(x_0 - h\\\\right) - f(x_0)}{h}  2\\\\frac{f^{(2)}(x_0)}{2!}h - 2\\\\frac{f^{(4)}(x_0)}{4!}h^3 + \\\\cdots \\\\end{array}. \\\\begin{array} {l} f^{(2)}(x_0)= \\\\frac{f\\\\left(x_0 + h\\\\right) + f\\\\left(x_0 - h\\\\right) - 2f(x_0)}{h^2} - 2\\\\frac{f^{(4)}(x_0)}{4!}h^2 + \\\\cdots \\\\end{array}. \\\\begin{array} {l} f^{(2)}(x_0)= \\\\frac{f\\\\left(x_0 + h\\\\right) + f\\\\left(x_0 - h\\\\right) - 2f(x_0)}{h^2} + O\\\\left(h^2\\\\right) \\\\end{array}.

Jarvis Lorry is a character in Charles Dickens' 1859 novel, A Tale of Two Cities. Overview Jarvis Lorry is one of the oldest employees of Tellson's Bank, and he frequently deals with the bank's offices in London and Paris. He is a confirmed bachelor and a man of business, describing himself as not much else than a speaking machine. He nevertheless shows an awkward sympathy towards Dr. Alexandre Manette and his daughter Lucie. While serving in Tellson's Paris office, Lorry takes the infant Lucie to safety in London after her father is imprisoned in the Bastille. When the novel begins in 1775, the 60-year-old Lorry receives a message from Jerry Cruncher, another Tellson's employee, informing him of Dr. Manette's release. He escorts the now-adult Lucie to reunite with her father in Paris, but is troubled by what they will both find on their arrival, and brings them back to London. Five years later, when Charles Darnay is arrested on suspicion of treason against the British Crown, Lorry arranges for the barristers Stryver and Sydney Carton to defend him. Following Darnay's acquittal, Lorry becomes an intimate friend of the Manettes, and of Darnay when he marries Lucie. In 1792, with the French Revolution ongoing, Lorry travels to Paris in order to look after the Tellson's branch there and remove important documents for safekeeping. When Darnay separately travels to Paris and is arrested as a fugitive aristocrat, Lorry remains there and begins working to free him, as well as providing assistance to the Manettes. He gradually softens toward Carton and is deeply touched by the latter's decision to sacrifice his life so Darnay can escape. Carton's final, unspoken thoughts before his execution mention his belief that Lorry will die peacefully in ten years' time and leave his estate to Darnay, Lucie, and their family. Cinematic and Theatrical Portrayals In the 1935 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film adaptation, Jarvis Lorry is portrayed by Claude Gillingwater.

A former outfielder and longtime manager in minor league baseball, he also spent three years (1989–91) as a coach with the Red Sox. As a player, Berardino batted and threw right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Berardino was a three-sport star at Watertown, Massachusetts, High School. He graduated from the College of the Holy Cross in 1959 after leading the Crusaders to the 1958 NCAA District One baseball championship. Upon graduation, he signed with the New York Yankees and batted .378 in his first professional season, with the Modesto Reds of the Class C California League. He reached Triple-A for three seasons (1962–64), playing for the Richmond Virginians, Indianapolis Indians and Spokane Indians, but never broke through to the Major League level. All told, Berardino appeared in 812 minor league games, and batted .272 with 702 hits and 70 home runs.Baseball Reference Berardino compiled a record of 753 wins and 858 losses (.467) with two championships in 21 seasons (1966–67; 1971–85; 1987–88; 1997–98) as a minor league manager. Nineteen of those 21 seasons were spent in short-season leagues. Berardino managed two full-season Class A clubs, the Greensboro Hornets of the South Atlantic League in 1987, and the Lynchburg Red Sox of the Carolina League the following season. His managing career began in the Yankee organization, where he handled Rookie-level clubs in the Gulf Coast and Appalachian leagues. In 1968, Berardino joined the Red Sox organization as a minor league coach, and marked his 50th consecutive year with Boston. From 1971 through 1985, he spent 15 consecutive seasons as the manager of the Red Sox' Short Season Class A New York–Penn League farm clubs, the Williamsport Red Sox and the Elmira Pioneers (also known as the Red Sox and Suns during his 13-year tenure there). Berardino returned to the NY-PL a dozen years later, in 1997–98, as manager of the Lowell Spinners. In addition to his minor league managerial and coaching assignments, and his three years as bullpen and third-base coach on the Major League staff of Joe Morgan in Boston, he also has served the Red Sox as spring training coordinator, assistant field coordinator of minor league instruction, and roving outfield and baserunning coach. Berardino's grandson, Ryan Berardino, was drafted by the Red Sox in the 34th round of the 2019 Major League Baseball draft out of Bentley University.

Battle on the Yangtze On the river Yangtze near Nanking, the capital of the Southern Tang, a major naval battle took place in 975 between the Song empire and the Southern Tang.line 2line 3 Forces Southern Tang The Tang had a fleet of ships that were ten decks highline 6 and equipped with multiple flamethrowers. There were at least 150,000 soldiers and sailors under the command of Zhu Lingyun.line 5 Song The admiral for the Song was Cao Bin.line 19. The Song ships were smaller,line 7 but the crew on board were better archers. The ships had flamethrowersline 23 and were filled with bundles of reed soaked in oilline 20 to be thrown at the enemy ships. Battle The Song ships attacked ferociously, firing so many arrows that soon, the Tang ships were studded with them.lines 8-9 Zhu Lingyun then ordered the flamethrowers to be fired.lines 9-10 Normally, any attacker would be destroyed, however the wind blew in the opposite direction of the flamethrowers so the burning oil flew back onto the Tang.lines 10-12 At that moment, the Song started throwing the bundles of burning reeds into the wind to cause more damage.line 21 The Song may have started using their own flamethrowers at this stage.lines 22-23 About 150,000 Tang soldiers and sailors were killed in the fire and Zhu Lingyun committed suicide by jumping into the flames.lines 12-14 Analysis of battle Considering the position of Nanking in China, where the imperial capital would have been, and the above \\"evidence\\", it can be assumed that there was a strong westerly wind on the day of that battle. The attackers would have had the advantage of having a good wind behind them, their ships would have travelled much faster, and their arrows, \\"burning bundles\\" and burning oil would have had extra propulsion. However, the defending side would have had the exact opposite to this. Considering the claimed size of the defenders ships, Zhu Lingyun would have probably been inside the ship and may have not been aware of what the weather was like, which would have led him to make the mistake of ordering the flamethrowers to be fired. On a technological note, we know that the Wujing Zongyao, written in 1044 (although the oldest edition is from around the 1560s), describes the flamethrowers oil being lit by fire drug (a flammable, quasi explosive compound that would in later cultures and generations be refined into gunpowder) and we know that fire drug was invented as a medicine sometime in the 9th century, but whether this battle did use gunpowder is speculative.  Aftermath  Li Houzhu, the emperor of the Southern Tang, was more interested in poetry than ruling, and soon after this battle the Southern Tang were absorbed into the new Song Empire. He was captured and sent to the Song capital, one of his wives raped and he was eventually poisoned.

It was a conventional design, with its most notable feature being its obsolescent autofrettaged bronze (so-called steel-bronze) barrel, necessary because Austria-Hungary still had trouble making steel of the proper quality. Its development was quite prolonged as the Austrians took years to decide on the proper recoil system and type of breech. Even then production difficulties prevented its introduction into service until 1907.Ortner, p. 201-202  Users  In addition to being used by Austria-Hungary during World War I the M.5/8 was widely used by its successor states after the war. Guns captured by Italy were used in both World War I and World War II as the Cannone da 77/28 modello 5/8 and Cannone da 77/28 CA (contraereo). Weapons captured by Nazi Germany were used under the designations 7.65 cm FK 5/8(ö), 7.65 cm FK 5/8(t), 7.65 cm FK 5/8(j) or 7.65 cm FK 300(j), 7.65 cm FK(i) and 7.65 cm Flak 268/1(i).  Variants  The M.5 was adapted for use in narrow mountain paths as the M.5/8 and could be disassembled into 3 loads. The base of the barrel was given lifting grips to speed its removal from the carriage and the carriage itself was modified to allow it to be disassembled. It is also worth noting that later M.5/8 barrels were made out of steel and full length axles of cast steel were available for use in its field gun configuration as found on an example rescued from a Dutch barn. This gun was also fitted with German army standard wooden wheels the differ from Austrian military standard through the lack of metal lugs on the spoke ends. In addition to its field gun and mountain gun roles the M.5/8 was also adapted to an anti-aircraft role by placing the gun on a high-angle pedestal mount with 360 ° traverse and called the 8 cm Luftfahrzeugabwehr-Kanone M 5/8 MP. The Italians also had an anti-aircraft version of the M 05/08 called the Cannone da 77/28 CA (contraereo). Despite its obsolescence it was deployed by Italian home guard units during World War II for static anti-aircraft defense and those captured by Germany after the Italian armistice in 1943 were given the designation 7.65 cm Flak 268/1(i). There were also anti-aircraft versions of the M.5/8 in use with Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. Photo Gallery File:8 cm FK M5 cannon 1.jpgAn 8 cm FK M5 cannon. Note the seats for the gunners.

He is a right-handed batsman, who used to play for Essex. Mickleburgh is in the Essex 1st team squad for the first time during the 2008 season. He has also played Minor Counties cricket for Norfolk & Suffolk. Mickleburgh also spent the 2007/2008 Australian season with the Newtown and Chilwell Cricket Club playing in the Geelong Cricket Association, where he was warmly welcomed.http://www.echo- news.co.uk/sport/3698390.Jaik___s_not_a_bad_bloke_for_a_Pom__/ Not a bad bloke for a Pom Mickleburgh learnt much of his cricket playing for Horsford CC where the senior pros, Paul Newman, the ex-Derbyshire player, and Chris Brown from Lancashire, helped nurture him. He came through the Essex academy, playing Minor Counties cricket with Norfolk, and made his first-team debut in September 2007 in the Twenty20 Floodlit Cup. Mickleburgh made his first appearance for Essex in the non-first-class Pro ARCH Trophy in September 2007 against the PCA Masters XI. He made his first-class debut in August 2008 against Leicestershire, he scored 60 as Essex won by an innings.Leicestershire v Essex, CricketArchive, Retrieved on 7 September 2008 After his debut Mickleburgh's efforts resulted in the youngster getting a call-up to the England Under-19 squad over the winter, for whom he toured South Africa in the New Year. On 15 and 16 April 2010 Mickleburgh scored his debut first-class century of 174 off 388 balls including 13 fours and a six against Durham. With James Foster this helped to set a record 5th wicket partnership for Essex of 339. Mickleburgh has spent two summers in Australia, the first as a 17-year- old with the Newtown and Chilwell Cricket Club, the second attending the Darren Lehmann academy in Adelaide. He spent the 2012-13 winter playing for Mid West Rhinos in Zimbabwe, with limited success, looking to reinvigorate his game after three years as a first-team regular while averaging in the twenties. Another overseas spell followed with North Sydney where his captaincy potential was held in high regard. There was talk from some he was Essex captaincy material, but he failed to provide the runs needed to become a serious contender. One of his brightest seasons at Essex came in 2013. Despite having started the season out of the side, due to the signing of Rob Quiney as overseas player, he finished that summer as Essex's leading Championship run- scorer with 829 at an average of 41.45. When he played against an England XI ahead of the 2013 Ashes, he also made 90 and 58 (the match had its first-class status removed), and went on to have his most productive spell in county cricket, including a career-best 243 against Leicestershire. He failed to press on the following season, however, managing just one half-century as the emergence of another young opener in Nick Browne cost him his place in the Championship XI and his star never really rose again. Mickleburgh helped Essex win the County Championship Division Two title in 2016 with Essex to play in Division One in the 2017 season. At the end of the domestic 2016 season it was announced Mickleburgh was not being offered a new contract which ends his 9 year affiliation with Essex leaving him as a free agent. For the 2017 season, Mickleburgh played for Copdock & Old Ipswichian Cricket Club and Suffolk.

He was later principal of the Civil Service College. Early life Born in Yorkshire, on 25 November 1928, Moore was the son of a monumental mason. Schooled at Penistone Grammar School, he went up to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge on a scholarship to read modern languages, graduating in 1950. During his time at Cambridge he won a half-blue for chess, and developed what would be a lifelong interest in the history and culture of Europe. University was followed by National Service, a period in the ranks was followed by a commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Army Educational Corps. Civil service Moore entered the Post Office in 1952 in the grade of assistant principal. He initially retained an army commission in the Territorial Army, transferring to the Intelligence Corps on 26 November 1952. He was promoted to lieutenant on 16 February 1953, acting captain on 1 June 1954 and substantive captain on 25 November 1955. He transferred to the TA reserve of officers on 2 May 1956. He was promoted to the grade of principal in 1957. Moore began his association with decimalisation in 1961 when he was appointed secretary to the British Committee of Inquiry on Decimal Currency, chaired by John Giffard, 3rd Earl of Halsbury. From 1966 he played the same role for the Decimal Currency Board, chaired by Lord Fiske, effectively giving him day-to-day responsibility for managing the transition to decimal currency. Despite the scale of the project, it encountered few problems, and the changeover was largely free from problems. His 1973 book, The Decimalisation of Britain’s Currency is considered the definitive account of the changeover. With the successful conclusion of decimalisation, Moore transferred to the Civil Service Department in 1972, with the grade of under secretary. He was much concerned with improving management in the civil service, ultimately serving as principal of the Civil Service College in Sunningdale from 1981–86. Retirement Following Moore's retirement in 1986 he continued to be in demand as an advisor to the European Union on how to manage the transition to the Euro. He also advised the Bank of England for an exhibition marking 25 years since the introduction of the decimal currency. With his wife, Mary, whom he had married in 1954, he was a regular volunteer at an Oxfam shop in Brentwood. Mary died in January 2008. Moore died of a brain tumour on 30 May 2008, leaving two sons, David and Richard.

It encompasses an area that was in the 18th and 19th centuries a port facility on the Taunton River for the town, including three 18th-century wharves and four houses of early to mid 18th- century construction. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description The town of Dighton, located on the west bank of the Taunton River in central Bristol County, Massachusetts, was settled by European colonists in the 1670s and incorporated as a town in 1712. It became significant as a maritime shipping endpoint in the 18th century because seagoing vessels were unable navigate further up the river. As a result, shipyards and wharves were built in several places on the banks of the river. This district is located in the south-central part of the town's waterfront, just south of Muddy Cove, where there was also at one time a ferry service across the river. The area declined in importance as a shipping center due to the ascendancy of Fall River as a deep-water shipping destination. The district runs along Pleasant Street, which runs close to the river, and includes four houses on the west side of the road, and three wharves that jut into the river. At the southern end of the district stand the house and wharf of Darius Perry, a ship's captain who sailed to the West Indies. His house, built about 1720, is a 1-1/2 story Cape that has repeatedly been enlarged and extended over the following centuries, but its basic form is still recognizable and its interior has been preserved. His wharf is about wide and a similar length, and was hand-built out of dry-laid stone, as were the other two wharves. North of Perry's house stands the Eddy House (2320 Pleasant Street), a 3-story Georgian style house, which was built about 1730 and given extensive Italianate styling about 1870. This house, along with the two remaining houses, were all built by Elkanah Andrews, another West Indies merchant who built one for himself and the others for two sons. It was acquired by Darius Perry in 1825 for his daughter and son-in-law, Captain William Eddy. A guest house once stood on the premises from the 1870s to mid 1900s behind the Eddy House. The guest house fell into great disrepair in the early-mid 1900s due to neglect and lack of use by the owners. In the late 1900s, the guest house was dismantled and transported to Brewster, where it now stands. In the early 1900s, the Eddys operated a function hall out of the guest house, along with a full farm with livestock in the large barn. People would arrive by train, trolley, ferry, or stagecoach to visit the Eddy House and its estate. As all three houses were built by a ship’s captain, many shipbuilding techniques of the time were employed in the construction of the houses. Large wooden pegs take the place of steel bolts, as the house was, in essence, constructed as a ship. The Eddy House sits at the highest part of the district, preserving over 240 years of history. The next house was Andrews' own house (2308 Pleasant Street), was built about 1740, and is an imposing 2-1/2 story structure. It was restyled about 1830 with an elaborate Greek Revival treatment. Andrews was probably responsible for the construction of the Spooner Wharf, which stands opposite this house, and the Andrews Wharf to its south. The Andrews Wharf is similar to that of Perry, while the Spooner Wharf is the longest of the three, at . Andrews' house was purchased in 1803 by Captain James Spooner, a wealthy Rhode Island ship's captain. At the northern end of the district stands the \\"Old Customs House\\", built by Andrews for his son Thomas about 1770. Between 1809 and 1834 it was owned by members of the Williams family, who acted as local customs collectors, and had one of the house's rear rooms outfitted as a small customs office. History In 1765, shortly after the renewal of the Molasses Act, the Dighton wharves were the site of the \\"Molasses Affair,\\" a protest of British taxes on molasses similar to the more famous Boston Tea Party. A local ship reported a cargo of 63 casks of molasses to the British custom officials, but the ship actually contained twice that number. The customs official ordered the ship's cargo impounded while he departed for Newport for assistance. While he was gone, forty local men with blackened faces stole the cargo, ran the ship aground, and drilled holes in the hull to protest British tax policies.

Ronnie Ross had died, so the brass section had to be reorganised as well, giving the record a different timbre.

In the league Katsabis featured in 23 matches and scored 2 goals. In his last season for the PAOK he played in 25 matches and scored 2 goals helping the club to achieve its 6th consecutive UEFA Cup qualification. =Iraklis= After his successful spell with PAOK Katsabis signed a contract with Iraklis Thessaloniki. He has proved himself indispensable for the club, as he is an automatic first team choice, in all nine years he plays for Iraklis. He featured in at least 22 matches each season (out of 30 possible) totaling over 200 appearances for the club, almost all as a starter. He debuted for Iraklis in a 3–0 victory against OFI in the 1st matchday of the 2002–03 season. His first goal was scored in the 16th minute of a match against Egaleo. It was the second goal of the team in a match that found Iraklis victorious by 2–0. From the 2006–07 season till his retirement he captained Iraklis.

The sand spit on the west side of Netarts bay is part of Cape Lookout State Park. The bay is approximately 5 by 1.5 miles (8.0 by 2.4 km) and totals 2,325 acres (9.41 km2) in area, making it Oregon's seventh largest bay.Advisory Committee to the State Land Board (July 1972). \\"An Inventory of Filled Lands in Netarts Bay Estuary\\" (pdf).

It experiences a maximum tidal range of 9 feet (3 m). The bay is part of a watershed of 13 square miles (34 km2) that is fed by at least 16 small creeks. From north to south, there is Fall Creek, Hodgdon Creek, O'Hara Creek, Rice Creek, two unnamed creeks, Yager Creek, three unnamed creeks, Whiskey Creek, an unnamed creek, Austin Creek, two unnamed creeks, and Jackson Creek. Physical characteristics = Tidal dynamics = Like other estuaries along the Oregon Coast, Netarts Bay experiences semi- diurnal tides (two high tides and two low tides per day).

Contrasting that with that a mean higher high tide volume of approximately 450 million cubic feet, the bay's tidal prism is about 33 million cubic feet. The tidal range varies between 1.5 and 3 meters(5 – 9 feet), which can vary the amount of water (40–90%) flushed out of the estuary during each tidal cycle. With a mean tidal period of 745 minutes,Glanzman, C., Glenne, Bard, Burgess, Fred, & Oregon State University. Engineering Experiment Station. (1971).

Horizontal mixing is limited, although vertical mixing is strong. Little to no vertical variations in temperature and salinity prevent density-driven current velocities, indicating that Netarts Bay is a well-mixed estuary. This has been further corroborated by water quality and dye studies. http://www.dfw.state.or.us/mrp/shellfish/seacor/findings_netarts_bay.asp = Sediment input and erosion = Rates of sedimentation average to the bay average nearly 2500 tons annually. An observed 10% decrease in mean high water volume between 1957 and 1969 in conjunction with high sedimentation rates suggests that the bay is gradually filling with sediment over time.Dicken, S., Hanneson, Bill, & Johannessen, Carl L.

Waves propagating from the southwest erode the southern portion of the spit and transport sediment northward, resulting in northward movement of the bay inlet. This erosion-deposition pattern is amplified by rip currents that create erosional \\"hot spots\\" along the spit. Cape Lookout State Park, situated within one of these hotspots, is subject to this intense erosional forcing. = Geology = Within the last 5 million years, differential erosion patterns on the neighboring Cape Meares and Cape Lookout headlands formed the embayment in which Netarts Bay now sits. Sediment cores obtained from within the bay have provided geological evidence for the existence of large, regularly occurring megathrust earthquakes throughout northwestern Oregon and the larger Cascadia Subduction Zone. Carbon-14 dating of the sediments suggest recurrence rates for these earthquakes to be between 400 and 600 years, and that at least 4 major quakes occurred within the last 3000 years. Sharp sand- layer contacts in the sediment record (deposited by earthquake-generated tsunami waves) indicate post-quake sinking of the marsh. This phenomenon, known as coseismic subsidence, provides strong geological evidence for the regular occurrence of major earthquakes occurring within the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Remnants of fire hearths from Native American settlements along nearby Nehalem and Salmon Rivers provide additional evidence of land subsidence (1–2 meters) resultant from subduction-zone earthquakes.  Biology = Shellfish = Olympia oyster on the half shell Olympia oysters are the only native oyster to the West Coast of North America. The establishment of a commercial fishery in the 1860s confirms a historical population within Netarts bay, with evidence of harvesting along the West Coast of North America by humans going back 4000 years. Due to over harvesting, increased consumption, and the export of adult oysters to San Francisco Bay, oyster populations declined in the late 1800s and the commercial fishery collapsed. The last known naturally occurring population of Olympia oysters in Netarts was surveyed in 1954. Subsequent field surveys in 1979 and 1992 did not find any Olympia oysters within the bay. Potential factors preventing population recovery post fishery collapse include: habitat degradation, sedimentation by increased motorized boat use, suffocation by burrowing shrimp, pollution, predation by invasive Japanese oyster drill and parasitism by non-native flat worm After their 1992 survey, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife began a large scale restoration attempt in Netarts, setting out 9 million spat between 1993-1998. Olympia oyster populations did not return to historical levels, but surveys in 2004 detected low populations of transplanted oysters in the bay. Anecdotal observations from residents also suggest small pockets of naturally occurring oysters subsist in the southwest corner of the bay. Juvenile oysters planted on adult oyster shell as substrate demonstrated that Olympia oysters can grow and reproduce in the bay. Small scale, investigative restoration projects run by The Nature Conservancy were undertaken in 2005 and 2006 to rebuild populations of Olympia oysters in Netarts Bay by adding shell cultch with set Olympia oysters to the bay in hopes of increasing settlement substrate and broodstock. Early monitoring of these sites found reproductive tissue and brooded larvae in adults and recruitment of larvae on shell substrate, but monitoring of the site ceased in 2007. Restoration interests are driven by culinary interest in Olympia oysters, the potential economic benefits of a commercial fishery, and the significant ecosystem services that Olympia oysters provide, including filtering the water and providing substrate for other organisms. Four species of bay clam are also found in Netarts Bay. = Marine flora = The main primary producers of the bay are eelgrass (Zostera marina, a type of seagrass), microscopic diatoms, and sea lettuce (Ulva enteromorpha, a type of macroalgae). Most of these species are found on mudflats, which account for about two-thirds of the total area of Netarts Bay.McIntire, C.D., Davis, M.W., Kentula, M.E., Whiting, M. (1983). Benthic Autotrophy in Netarts Bay, Oregon. Report prepared for Environmental Protection Agency, Corvallis, OR, USA. Eelgrass bed (Zostera marina) Eelgrass beds are found in the intertidal and subtidal mudflats, and biologically interact with oyster beds in a few ways: The pseudofeces and feces of bivalves have been found to fertilize seagrass by increasing bioavailable macronutrients such as ammonium and phosphate in sediments. Bivalves also filter phytoplankton from the water column, a process which reduces water turbidity, allows more light to penetrate through the water column, and reduces the number of epiphytes living on seagrass leaves. Eelgrass is important as food for waterfowl, habitat for juvenile fish, and as physical shapers of the bay.Stout, H. (1976). The natural resources and human utilization of Netarts Bay, Oregon. Corvallis: Oregon State University. The growing season is from April to October. Diatoms are found in benthic and pelagic environments of the bay, and also as epiphytes living on other marine plants. There is a total of 336 diatom taxa identified in the bay, 50 of which are planktonic, 123 of which are epiphytic, and 282 of which are benthic (about 111 taxa overlap the epiphytic and benthic categories). Benthic diatom assemblage distributions correspond to sediment type, grain size, and wave energy. Sea lettuce, a macroalgae otherwise known as green nori, grows usually only in the summer. Seasonal upwelling along the Pacific North American coast has been correlated to increased sea lettuce productivity and decreased eelgrass productivity. Japanese eelgrass (Zostera japonica) is an introduced species found in bays and estuaries ranging from Oregon to British Columbia, Canada. It was likely brought over by Pacific oyster seed shipments that began in the early 20th century used by commercial shellfisheries along the Pacific northwest coast.  Native Americans and Netarts Bay  Netarts Bay and sand spit are within the historic territory of the Tillamook Indians, which ranged from Tillamook head in the north to the Nestucca River in the south and from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Coast Range summit in the east.Bonacker, G., Martin, Robert C., Frenkel, Robert E., & Oregon. Natural Area Preserves Advisory Committee. (1979). Preserve analysis : Netarts Sand Spit. Salem, Or.: Oregon Natural Area Preserves Advisory Committee. Cape Lookout State Park contains 13 suspected archaeological sites, including 6 on Netarts sand spit representing at least one and perhaps up to three major villages. Archaeological excavations of Netarts Sandspit Village (35-TI-1) show evidence of a major Tillamook village that was occupied at least three separate times between 1300–1700 A.D.Newman, T. (1959). Tillamook prehistory and its relation to the Northwest coast culture area. University of Oregon. Excavations revealed semisubterranean cedar plank structures with single pitched roofs, numerous hearths and fire pits, and middens around all house pits. The village contained at least 13 house pits and may have contained up to 30–40 house pits. It has been described as \\"the most impressive house pit site on State Park lands along the Oregon Coast.\\" Numerous artifacts were found during excavation of 35-Ti-1 in the 1950s. Some of the bone and antler objects found include: wedges, adzes, awls, needles, bi-pointed pins, blades, harpoon barbs, chisels, digging stick handles, and bone carvings with faces, perhaps from clubs or wand handles. One house pit included whalebone objects including a 1.5m x 0.3m (~5 ft x 1 ft) seat and a possible whale vertebrae seat surrounded by fire pits. Numerous stone artifacts were also found at the site, including: projectile points, blades, scrapers, gravers, core choppers, modified flakes, double pitted cobbles, hammerstones, and whetstones. The most recent occupation layer also contained trade goods including: rusted iron (perhaps knife blades), a copper pendant, and many sherds of Chinese porcelain. Closer examination of the middens surrounding major house pits identified middens that were up to 1.3m deep, and in some cases over 2m deep. Over 67,000 vertebrate specimens, in total, of at least 59 species have been recovered from test pits at the site including bones from birds, fish, shellfish, sea lions, sea otters, seals, porpoises, whales, elk, deer, and beavers. Initial attempts to describe midden composition determined a rough 50:50 split between shells of blue clams and cockles, with butter clams and bent-nosed clams making up the rest. However, future investigations found over 14,000 Dungeness crab fragments in roughly 4m3 of excavated midden sediment. It was determined that Native Americans harvested a large size range of Dungeness crabs, including many juvenile crabs, from the bay. It is suspected crabs were collected along with cockles using a rake-like tool during low tide. It seems all major shellfish species found in the middens could be harvested throughout the course of a tidal cycle.  Early European settlement  It is suspected that contact between Europeans and Indians became more numerous and consistent in the late 1700s. By the time Lewis & Clark arrived in 1806, Indians had firearms and metal implements. The first European settlers arrived in Netarts Bay in 1865, and records suggest native Olympia oysters were abundant in the bay. In fact, there are indications oyster harvests by European settlers began as early as 1868 and that at least some of these oysters were exported to San Francisco.Shabica, S. et al. 1976. The natural resources and human utilization of Netarts Bay, Oregon. (An interdisciplinary student -originated study funded by the NSF under Grant No. EPP 75- 08901). Oregon State Univ., Corvallis. Historic accounts indicate a shanty town, named Oysterville, was present in the bay during this time, and the bay was sometimes called \\"Oyster Bay.\\" By 1903 virtually all shore line of the spit was claimed and occupied. Despite early claims, residential use of Netarts sand spit had mostly disappeared by 1920 and subsequent growth concentrated in Netarts along the northeast bay. A commercial oyster cultivating industry was present from 1930-1957; however, the accidental introduction of the Japanese oyster drill led to the collapse of this industry in 1957.  Ocean acidification  The oyster industry along the West Coast of North America relies almost exclusively on the Pacific Oyster, Crassostrea gigas. There are only three locations on the West Coast of North America where natural recruitment of C. gigas takes place: Willapa Bay, WA, Hood Canal WA, and British Columbia, Canada. Recruitment elsewhere is limited by cold water temperatures that inhibit spawning and low residence time of water that flushes out larvae, making the oyster industry dependent on hatcheries to raise larvae. Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery, located in Netarts Bay, is one of the largest providers of larvae for the industry.Gilles, N. (2013). The Whiskey Creek Shellfish Acid Tests. Confluence, 3–8. Retrieved from http://seagrant.oregonstate.edu/sites/seagrant.oregonstate.edu/files/confluence/confluence-2-1-web.pdf In the late summer of 2007, the hatchery saw massive die offs in larvae, resulting in zero production for multiple months on end. Similar die offs and production failures occurred at other Pacific Northwest hatcheries and oyster farms. Water samples from Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery tested positive for a bacteria, Vibrio tubiashii, and this pathogen was suspected to be the cause of the mortality. However, after installing a new system to clean the water, another round of die-offs occurred. Oyster at Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery. Photo by Oregon State University. Researchers from Oregon State University and Hatchery employees were able to work together to make the connection between early larval mortality and upwelling conditions that negatively impacted the entire west coast shellfish industry. Using Hatchery records of larval performance and monitoring of incoming tidal water from Netarts Bay, low aragonite saturation states at the time of spawning were correlated with the high levels of larval mortality that heavily reduced hatchery production and negatively impacted the west coast oyster industry Further research from OSU, supported by Whiskey Creek, helped to identify the first 48 hours of larval life, in which the initial shell is built, as a window of vulnerability to ocean acidification due to the rapid rate of calcification and limited energetic budget. Experiments decoupling PCO2, pH demonstrated that aragonite saturation has the greatest impact on shell development of early bivalve larvae. These conclusions supported buffering of incoming water and chemical monitoring approach used by Whiskey Creek Hatchery to improve survival of larval oysters. Research at Whiskey Creek Hatchery contributed to the body of knowledge around ocean acidification and the immediate impacts it has on calcifying organisms. = Water quality monitoring systems = Real-time water quality monitoring systems now exist to help shellfish farmers, scientists, and others invested in oyster aquaculture track changes in aragonite saturation state, pCO2 and pH. An online portal with this information was funded by the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), and regional ocean observing systems continuously contribute to the data stream. One such regional system, the Northwest Association of Networked Ocean Observing Systems (NANOOS), aims to develop predictive data products for use by local and national stakeholders in shellfish aquaculture, as well as the general public. Water quality data are provided by analytical gas monitoring systems known as \\"burkolators,\\" named for the OSU researcher who invented them, Dr. Burke Hales. Burkolators resolve PCO2 and TCO2 (total dissolved carbon dioxide) measurements within water samples at high spatial resolution, allowing for accurate calculations of total alkalinity. Initially implemented as a scientific tool, burkolators are now used at 5 shellfish hatcheries along the U.S. West Coast to monitor incoming water quality. Live feeds of burkolator data at the hatcheries can be found on the NANOOS website. = Impact on shellfish industry = Most shellfish growers have observed effects of ocean acidification on their businesses. In a survey of 86 shellfish growers located in California, Oregon, and Washington, 85% identified ocean acidification as a problem affecting them today, and 95% identified ocean acidification as a problem that will affect future generations.Mabardy, R. A., Conway, F. D. L., Waldbusser, G. G., Olsen, C. S. (2016). & Oregon State University. Sea Grant College Program, issuing body. (2016). The U.S. West Coast Shellfish Industry's Perception of and Response to Ocean Acidification: Understanding an ocean stakeholder (ORESU-S ; 16-001). Corvallis, Oregon: Oregon Sea Grant. Bivalve larvae are generally more susceptible than adult bivalves to decreased pH and saturation states, so early stages of oyster seeding may be more vulnerable the bioenergetic stress of ocean acidification. Spatial and temporal variations in ocean chemistry require continual adaptation, and shellfish growers are subject to greater uncertainty in the face of climate change.

During this period the Jansenists were active in Belgium, both in attacking the Jesuits and in opposing the papal decrees condemnatory of Jansenism. All of Father Stephens's published works were occasioned by these attacks. Works In \\"Specimen doctrinæ a Jesuitis in Seminario Leodiensi traditæ\\" the Jesuits were accused, among other things, of corrupting faith and morals by their teaching. In answer to these accusations Stephens published a set of theses, \\"Conclusiones theologicæ miscellaneæ\\" (Liège, 1702) and had them publicly defended by one of his pupils. In answer to another Jansenistic work known as the \\"Epistola Leodiensis de formula Alexandri VII\\", he published his \\"Vera defensio authoritatis Ecclesiæ\\" (Liège, 1707). The Jansenist, Henry Denys, thereupon defended the \\"Epistola\\" in an anonymously published work which called forth Stephens's \\"Author epistolæ Leodiensis denuo confutatus\\" (Liège, 1709). His other works are the \\"Dissertatio theologica de Condemnatione Libri Janseniani\\" (Liège, 1710) and the \\"Consilium pacis adversariis propriis inter se disputantibus\\" (Liège, 1710). In all these works his name appears in the Latinized form of Stephani.

It contains articles pertaining to health, sex, ecology, technology, nutrition, psychology and human life. Its content has the capability to answer all the basic doubts a person might have about the world they live in. The magazine was created in Spain by the Hachette Filipacchi publisher. It was released in Spain in 1995. Its first director was Oscar Becerra and the art director was Pancho Guijarro. Aside from Becerra and Guijarro, Juan Caño, vice president editor of Hachette, was highly involved in the creative development of the publication. A few months later Grupo Zeta released CNR in Spain, a magazine whose similarities to Quo were extraordinary. Hearst Magazines bought Hachette Filipacchi's Spanish magazines in 2011. In 1997 the Mexican edition was started, published by Editorial Televisa and directed by Gabriel Sama. The first art director for the Mexican edition was Julio Carrasco; Rodrigo Xoconostle and Soledad Aguirre were members of the original reading team. During its first years Quo had editions in the Czech Republic, Portugal and France aside from the Mexican version. The Mexican edition went from Editorial Televisa publisher to Grupo Expansión about five years after its first appearance in Mexico. The French edition was discontinued. Sections The magazine is composed of six different sections in which articles of interest and science are reviewed. Below is a small description of each of the sections: =Quonectados= \\"Space at your entire disposal. Or almost\\" The section of the magazine that contains answers to questions made by readers of Quo. Includes: *Agenda for the month. A summary of a series of events about science, technology and gossip to occur over the month of the magazines publishment. *Smart advice. On this section a group of experts from diverse cultural areas help the magazine by providing trustworthy and accurate information. *Mail. Where the reader's main questions are published along with a concrete response. *Expert opinions. Experts express their points of view to a specific topic. = Portfolio = Section of the magazine that contains interesting articles accompanied by high quality images and information with high levels of interest. = Prágmata = This section is the most broad and extensive on the publication. Prágmata is probably the section of most interest since it goes over common questions about the world using diverse areas of study and analytical thinking. The sections content is divided on the following areas. *Entertainment *Mind *Human *Nature *Technology *Automobiles *Sex *Sports *Quality of life *Art = Portada = Main section of the magazine since it covers the topic present on the cover of the magazine. An interesting section that contains exclusive information, high quality images and in occasions is accompanied by tables and graphs that complement the content on an efficient way. = Reportajes = Section that contains diverse topics pertaining to current events. This sections varies according to the articles considered on that months publication, still the information is considered entertaining by readers. In February 2008 Quo published an article about Wikipedia in which 15 experts analyzed 30 articles from Spanish Wikipedia. = Qplus = \\"Our planet in motion.\\" It works as an information supplement, since it contains its own sections of interest. The sections included on Qplus are: *Expediente. Where every month the magazine includes a historical article and relates it to the modern day. *Atlas Quo. In which you can find geographic information fundamental to learn details about a specific place on the planet. *Ágora.

The design was for four Winton Engine Corporation four cylinder diesel engines each direct connected to 75 kilowatt, 125 volt General Electric generators that could be coupled to develop 350 horsepower on the propulsion motor at 300 revolutions and, when on station, could singly handle the entire ship's electrical load even under adverse conditions. Two 7.5-kilowatt Cummings diesel generating sets were provided for auxiliary and in-port power and an oil-fired boiler provided heating. Service history Lightship No. 114 left Portland on 15 July 1930 for Astoria, Oregon from which she departed 5 August under Captain Jacob Nielsen for her first station at Fire Island, New York with stops at San Francisco, San Pedro, Balboa, Panama, Navassa, Charleston, and Portsmouth to arrive at New York 20 September—the first lightship to make the transit from west to east. The distance of was accomplished in 31 days, 12 hours, 49 minutes with actual running time of 756.5 hours for an average speed of and maximum speed of . The ship served as the Fire Island lightship until 1942. From 1942 to 1945 she was armed for wartime service with a single 6-pounder gun and placed into 3d District service as an examination vessel at Bay Shore, New York. Her log reports how real the threat to shipping on the east coast was as the log for Christmas Day 1941 mentions flares from a German U-boat being spotted. Following the war, LV 114 was reassigned to Diamond Shoals off Cape Hatteras. She served there for two years before becoming a Relief lightship. For the next eleven years she served on relief duty until assigned to Pollock Rip station in 1958. When the Pollock Rip station was discontinued, LV 114 was moved north to Portland, Maine where she served for the final two years of her career. She was put out of service in 1971. The Coast Guard originally planned to use LV 114 as a museum but those plans fell through. Instead, she was awarded to the city of New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1975. In 1976 the lightship received a cosmetic overhaul and played a starring role in the city's bicentennial celebrations. In 1990 LV 114 was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, but little was done to preserve or promote her after the Bicentennial, and in 2006 she sank at her pier. Shortly after her sinking, LV 114 was refloated and the city of New Bedford tried to auction the ship off. The starting bid was $25,000, but no one bid on the ship. Even after the city reduced the starting bid to $10,000 no one stepped forward to bid. After the failed attempts to sell the lightship, the city had historical artifacts removed from her, then placed the ship on eBay. After four days, the ship sold for $1,775 to Sea Roy Enterprises. The city however decided not to dispose of LV 114 for such a small amount. Eventually, Sea Roy Enterprises agreed in May, 2007 to pay the city $10,000 for the lightship. The following month she was broken up and her remains sold to salvage yards.

The oldest portion of this house is estimated to have been built around 1680, making it the oldest structure in Rehoboth. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, where it is listed at 96 Davis Street. Description and history The Kingsley House is located in southernmost Rehoboth, in a rural-residential area. It is set on the north side of Davis Street, just west of its junction with Meadowlark Drive, on a lot fronted by low fieldstone wall. It is a 2-1/2 story timber frame structure, with a gable roof, central chimney, and shingled exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, but there are deviations from symmetry, including only one window on the second floor left side. The rear of the main block is extended by a shed-roof extension down to the first floor, giving it a saltbox profile, and there is a single-story gabled ell extending to the main block. The construction date of this house is not known, but it seems likely that the oldest portion of the house was built about 1680 by John Kingsley, as a three- bay \\"stone ender\\" house. This is based on the presence of a basement only under the eastern three bays. Differences in roof construction and window placement on either side of the central chimney indicate different construction periods, although both parts of the main block exhibit First Period construction methods, including heavy timber framing, chamfered beams, and gunstock posts. The stairs of the staircase were made by splitting square- cut timbers diagonally in half, and there is a chimney tree consisting of a single square-cut oak beam in thickness. The rear leanto section was added before 1785, and the western ell is of 19th century construction. The house is probably the oldest in Rehoboth, and is one of its best-preserved 17th-century houses.

History NFT was pioneered in 1965 by Allen Cooper at the Glasshouse Crops Research institute in Littlehampton, England. In an ideal system, the depth of the recirculating stream is very shallow, little more than a film of water, hence the name 'nutrient film'. This ensures that the thick root mat which develops in the bottom of the channel receives adequate air exposure. Description A properly designed NFT system is based on using the right channel slope, the right flow rate, and the right channel length. The plant roots are exposed to adequate supplies of water, oxygen and nutrients. In earlier production systems, there was a conflict between the supply of these requirements, since excessive or deficient amounts of one results in an imbalance of one or both of the others. NFT, because of its design, provides a system wherein all three requirements for healthy plant growth can be met at the same time, provided that the simple concept of NFT is always remembered and practiced. The result of these advantages is that higher yields of high-quality produce are obtained over an extended period of cropping. A downside of NFT is that it has very little buffering against interruptions in the flow, such as a result of a power outage. But, overall, it is one of the more productive techniques. The same design characteristics apply to all conventional NFT systems. While slopes along channels of 1:100 have been recommended, in practice it is difficult to build a base for channels that is sufficiently true to enable nutrient films to flow without ponding in locally depressed areas. As a consequence, it is recommended that slopes of 1:30 to 1:40 be used. This allows for minor irregularities in the surface, but, even with these slopes, ponding and waterlogging may occur. The slope may be provided by the floor, or benches or racks may hold the channels and provide the required slope. Both methods are used and depend on local requirements, often determined by the site and crop requirements. Flow rates As a general guide, flow rates for each gully should be 1 litre per minute. At planting, rates may be half this, and the upper limit of 2L/min appears about the maximum. Flow rates beyond these extremes are often associated with nutritional problems. Depressed growth rates of many crops have been observed when channels exceed 12 metres in length. On rapidly growing crops, tests have indicated that, while oxygen levels remain adequate, nitrogen may be depleted over the length of the gully. As a consequence, channel length should not exceed 10–15 metres. In situations where this is not possible, the reductions in growth can be eliminated by placing another nutrient feed halfway along the gully and reducing flow rates to 1L/min through each outlet., Hydroneeds.com.au Care needs to be taken to maintain hygienic conditions and to avoid heavy metal contamination of NFT systems by using mainly plastic or stainless steel pumps and components., GVHI.co.nz  Potato minitubers  Most potato varieties are maintained in plant tissue culture and micropropagation methods are used to increase the amount of planting material. Since tissue culture plants perform poorly when planted into field soil, they are instead planted into greenhouses or screenhouses to generate tubers, which are referred to as minitubers. In many countries, it is common for NFT or aeroponic systems to be used for production of minitubers from tissue culture plantlets. The minitubers are planted into the field 6 to 14 months after harvest to grow a crop of potatoes. This first crop of field-grown potatoes is typically replanted to generate more potatoes rather than consumed. Controversy A leading proponent of NFT was Dr. Allen Cooper, a scientist at the Glasshouse Crops Research Station in England who published the book The ABC of NFT. NFT systems were used by a significant proportion of commercial growers in the UK through the 1980-1990 period but were only used for lettuce in Europe. Dutch growers particularly rejected NFT because of the perceived high risk of disease spread by the recirculating solution. NFT ensures that plants have unlimited access to water at all times, but it is now recognized that fruiting crops can benefit from carefully limited water supplies. Leafy crops like lettuce benefit from unlimited water supplies and are still widely grown using NFT, but now most commercial greenhouse crops of tomatoes, capsicums and cucumbers are grown hydroponically using some kind of inert media, with rockwool being the most important medium worldwide. NFT remains a very popular system for home use.

It is the primary civilian intelligence agency of Sri Lanka and is responsible for both internal and external intelligence-gathering. It comes under the purview of the Ministry of Defence. The agency was originally named National Intelligence Bureau. History Until 1984, the Sri Lanka Police were responsible for internal intelligence functions, first under the Special Branch, and later under the Intelligence Services Division. The perceived failure of the Intelligence Services Division during the riots of July 1983 led the J.R. Jayawardene Government to re-evaluate the nation's intelligence network, and in 1984 the President set up a National Intelligence Bureau. The new organization combined intelligence units from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Police.SRI LANKA - A Country Study It was renamed the State Intelligence Service in 2006. LTTE agents successfully infiltrated Sri Lankan government and military organisations resulting in the assassinations of several high-ranking military personnel, including Major Tuan Mutalif and Colonel Tuan Meedin both of the Directorate of Military Intelligence, putting Sri Lankan intelligence services in a desperate condition. Under the Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa the intelligence agencies that were in desperate condition built-up a cohesive apparatus, which achieved significant success, including anti-LTTE operations overseas and the SIS played huge role in the Fourth Ealam war.http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20100517_02 In January 2015 the Director of the SIS, Chandra Wakista, resigned following the Presidential election, amid allegations of phone tapping of opposition politicians. In March Nilantha Jayawardena was appointed as the SIS Director. In December 2019 the newly elected president Gotabaya Rajapaksa appointed Brigadier Suresh Sallay the former head of Directorate of Military Intelligence as the head of SIS after his predecessor Maithripala Sirisena and then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe weakened the intelligence agencies allowing the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings to happen. Sallay is the first director of the SIS to come from the Military Intelligence instead of the Police.

They are sometimes known as the Central American toads or Middle American toads and are found in southern USA, Mexico, Central America, and northern Pacific South America (Colombia and Ecuador). They are an ecologically and biogeographically diverse group of toads, including micro-endemic species such as Incilius spiculatus that are restricted to undisturbed cloud forests, and widespread lowland species such as Incilius valliceps that predominantly occur in disturbed habitats. Taxonomy and systematics This genus was first described in 1863 by Edward Drinker Cope who designated the type species as Incilius coniferus. This proved unpopular and these toads were known under the genus Bufo until the early 2000s. The current delineation of the genus follows Mendelson et al. (2011) who brought Cranopsis/Cranophryne/Ollotis and Crepidius/Crepidophryne into synonymy with Incilius, while providing evidence for removing Rhinella from Incilius. Taxonomy and systematics of the toads now considered to be classified in this genus had seen many changes after Incilius was resurrected to split Bufo in the less than a decade before this 2011 paper. I. coniferus went through some five name changes in less than a dozen years. However, the monophyly of Incilius continues to be threatened by Incilius bocourti, which might be the sister taxon of Anaxyrus. Another discussion has been the taxonomic level at which the genus is recognized. Incilius did not see wide recognition before the large-scale revision of amphibian systematics by Darrel Frost and colleagues in 2006, then under the name Cranopsis, including the former \\"Bufo valliceps group\\" and some related species. However, others have argued that Incilius should be treated as a subgenus of Bufo. Species There are at present 39 species: The AmphibiaWeb recognizes Incilius intermedius (Günther, 1858) as a valid species, whereas the Amphibian Species of the World considers it a synonym of Incilius occidentalis (Camerano, 1879).

Life He entered the Society of Jesus in 1817 and after teaching for eleven years at the Jesuit College at Brieg, Switzerland, he became in 1840 a missionary and catechist in Köthen, Germany. With Father Rohe, S.J., he established at Lucerne in 1845 the academy of St. Charles Borromeo. In 1847 he left Switzerland, which had become hostile to Jesuits. After that he was chiefly engaged in giving missions in Germany. Works As a catechist in Köthen he felt the lack of a good catechism, and was encouraged by his superior, Fr. Devis, to compose one. As a model he took the Mainz catechism of 1842 and made use also of other good textbooks, notably of Bossuet's catechism. He completed his first catechism, called \\"Katholischer Katechismus oder Lehrbegriff\\" in 1847. In 1848 it appeared anonymously at Ratisbon and immediately won approval. Bishop Blum of Linsburg introduced it officially into his diocese the same year; the following year the bishops of Trier and Hildesheim did likewise for their dioceses. In 1850 the Bavarian bishops resolved to introduce a common catechism for the entire kingdom, and accepted Deharbe's catechism, which was then introduced in 1853.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005 and designated a city of Detroit historic district in 2016. History The area surrounding Cass Park was originally laid out as part of a French ribbon farm extending from the Detroit River. Lewis Cass, the park's namesake, purchased the farm in 1816 when he moved to the area. He constructed a house on Larned Street between First and Second Avenues, and in 1840 a larger house on the northwest corner of Fort and Cass Streets. Starting in 1836, Cass began subdividing his land, platting lots between Larned and the river. Over the next 30 years, Cass platted more northerly sections of his claim. The area that now encompasses the Cass Park Historic District began to be sold as lots after 1859. In 1860, Cass deeded a section of land to the city of Detroit, bounded by Second, Ledyard, Cass and Bagg (now Temple), to be used as a public park. In 1863, the Detroit City Railway Company began streetcar service Along Woodward Avenue, only a few blocks away from Cass Park. The streetcar service spurred development northward along Woodward, including the Cass Park area. The area soon became a fashionable suburb of the city. In 1875, the city landscaped Cass Park, planting a number of new trees. By the 1880s, some of Detroit's most prominent citizens lived along the park, including James Vernor, E. W. Voigt, and John H. Avery. Avery's house at 457 Ledyard is the only residence remaining from this period within the district. The Cass Park area continued to be a fashionable address into the 1900s. However, the 1890s saw the introduction of upscale apartment buildings. In 1895, the Alhambra Flats at 100-112 Temple was constructed, followed in 1905 by the Cromwell Flats at 2942 Second, and in 1908 by the Ansonia Flats at 2909 Second. As Detrtoit continued developing, apartment buildings with smaller but more numerous units began to appear, including the Manhattan Apartments at 2966 Second in 1905, and the Altadena Apartments at 2952 Second in 1911. This marked a transformation of the Cass Park area, as the single family homes surrounding the park were replaced with apartment buildings to house the city's expanding population. By 1925, a number of new apartment buildings had been constructed. In addition, by the early 1920s, the business development of the city center reached into the Cass Park area, with businesses constructing their headquarters near the park. The first one of these was the Standard Accident Insurance Company, who built their headquarters at 640 Temple in 1921. Also by 1920, the city's Freemasonry had purchased a plot of land on what is now Temple Avenue to construct a new building, replacing the lodge on Lafayette which the organizations had outgrown. Construction on the Detroit Masonic Temple, the largest building in the district, began in 1920 and was completed in 1926. The Knights of Pythias followed suit, building a headquarters adjacent to the Masonic Temple in 1926. In 1927, the S. S. Kresge Corporation built its World Headquarters along the park. Smaller businesses located along the more heavily traveled Cass Avenue near the Park. A number of structures were constructed in this area, including a commercial buildinghousing the Lasky Corporation at 146-166 Temple in 1923, the Will Mar Garage at 131 Temple in 1924, and a film exchange building at 479 Ledyard in 1936. During World War II the city's exploding population caused apartment owners in the area to subdivide their units to house the influx of workers. After the war, the Cass Park area declined economically, with the apartment buildings being further divided into substandard units. Many buildings fell into disrepair or were abandoned. During the 1950s-1970s the Cass Park area became one of the most economically depressed neighborhoods of the city, and a number of charitable organizations moved into the area. In 1955, the Episcopal Diocese of Detroit constructed the Mariners Inn at 445 Ledyard as a shelter and treatment center for alcoholic sailors. The construction of Interstate 75 in Michigan, cutting off the park from downtown, hastened the decline of the neighborhood. Businesses moved into the suburbs, and the buildings left behind were taken over by nonprofit organizations, abandoned, or razed. Description Cass Tech from across Cass Park The Cass Park Historic District includes Cass Park, a formal square with angled paths and scattered statues,Kelli B.

It is usually white to very pale pink, inedible, and grows with birch trees. It is commonly known as the birch brittlegill. Taxonomy The specific epithet betularum \\"of the birches\\", refers to its association with birch (Betula species). Some sources regard it as a variety of the sickener (R. emetica). Description The cap is convex to flattened, and often has a central depression. On expansion the margin becomes furrowed, and bears low warts. It is in diameter, and the cuticle may be peeled off completely. The cap ranges in colour from white to pale pink, to deep pink, and can even be pale buff. Although more often it is white with a pale pink blush, turning pale yellow ochre in the centre. The stem is typically longer than the diameter of the cap, and is cylindrical or slightly club-shaped. It is white, and very fragile. The gills are also white, and well spaced, and the spore print is white. The flesh is white and tastes hot. It might be confused with Russula fragilis (Pers.) Fr. which can be pale in colour, and occur in the same habitat. However, the cuticle of the latter species is only three quarters peeling, usually darker at the centre, and with purplish tones. It also has marked serrations on the gill edges. Distribution and habitat Russula betularum appears in summer and early autumn. It is widespread in Britain, Europe, and Scandinavia, and is probably mycorrhizal with birch trees. It often grows in damp places in woodlands. Edibility This mushroom is inedible, and has a hot 'peppery' taste. Many bitter tasting red-capped species can cause problems if eaten raw; the symptoms are mainly gastrointestinal in nature: diarrhoea, vomiting and colicky abdominal cramps. The active agent has not been identified but thought to be sesquiterpenes, which have been isolated from the related genus Lactarius and from Russula sardonia.

In November, she was definitely at Kossol Roads in the Palau group because she reported sighting a submarine at 0858 on the 19th while she was laying torpedo nets at the west entrance to the roadstead. She indicated that the submarine submerged and surfaced three times in the space of two minutes and then moved off before auxiliary motor minesweeper USS YMS-33 belatedly got underway to investigate. That submarine probably was RO-37, which and sank later that day about 20 miles north of the west entrance. =Supporting the Okinawa invasion= While it is conceivable that she was in the neighborhood of the Ryukyu Islands for the preliminary occupation of the roadstead at Kerama Retto, no hard evidence supports the conclusion. In any event, she was off Okinawa on 1 April 1945, D-day for the invasion of that bitterly contested island. By the 7th, she had moved to Ulithi. Winterberry was back at Okinawa by 28 May. At 0730 that day, an enemy plane attacked the ships assembled in Buckner Bay. Winterberry opened fire, but the enemy succeeded in crashing into one of the attack transports. =Attacked by aircraft= Fifteen minutes later, three more dive bombers raided the anchorage. They dove in from the sun and immediately drew antiaircraft fire. Winterberry opened up with her guns and assisted in bringing down two of the three raiders. At the height of that melee, a Japanese \\"Val\\" swooped on the anchorage. Winterberry could not fire on this enemy because friendly ships were in her line of fire, but the other ships brought him down. During the early afternoon of 3 June, she again assisted in downing a kamikaze. At 1912 on the 11th, she joined the antiaircraft barrage when a single \\"Val\\" swooped down out of a heavy cloud cover. Oblivious to the curtain of gunfire, he dove at dock landing ship . He overshot the dock landing ship, climbed, did a wingover and entered his second suicide dive. This time, he chose a victory ship; but the antiaircraft fire, which he had ignored so contemptuously, cut his mission short. Winterberry's guns combined with those of the other ships in the area to splash the kamikaze but a scant few yards short of his intended victim. =End-of-war operations= During the waning months of World War II, Winterberry continued to serve at Okinawa. On 5 August, she departed the Ryukyus, bound for Saipan where she arrived on the 11th. The cessation of hostilities on 15 August found her still at Saipan. However, on the 20th, she got underway for Iwo Jima. The net-layer reached her destination three days later and operated in the Volcano Islands—at Iwo Jima and at Chichi Jima—until late in October. On 24 October, she departed Iwo Jima to return to the United States. Post-war disposition After stops at Saipan, Eniwetok, Johnston Island, and Pearl Harbor, she entered San Diego, California, harbor on 29 November and reported to the Commandant, 11th Naval District, for disposal. She was decommissioned at San Diego on 15 February 1946, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 26 February 1946. The former net-layer was subsequently transferred to the U.S. Maritime Commission for final disposition. She was sold to Joe Medina Enterprises, of San Diego, California, on 31 March 1947. Honors and awards Winterberry earned one battle star for World War II.

It was a Carlist victory. Carlist forces were led by Tomás de Zumalacárregui, who ambushed Isabeline (Liberal) troops under Manuel O'Doyle. Background The Isabeline (Liberal) army under José Ramón Rodil, after a disastrous campaign during the summer of 1834, had attempted to destroy Zumalacárregui's army and arrest Infante Carlos, Count of Molina. However, Rodil's forces had been reduced by the Carlists by September 1834. Rodil was forced to give up command to Manuel Lorenzo. Rodil marched towards Madrid, taking with him as escort, as he approached Vitoria-Gasteiz, a division led by O'Doyle, which had belonged to the Liberal Army of Navarre. Rodil, without authorization, placed O'Doyle's troops under the command of Joaquín de Osma, commander-general of the Basque Provinces and who was based at Vitoria. The Isabeline troops of Navarre, thus reduced, were unable to keep up with the rapid movements of Zumalacárregui's army. Zumalacárregui approached the Ebro with the intention of attacking the Riojan place known as Ezcaray, 40 km south of the river. Ezcaray was the site of important factories producing cotton cloths; Zumalacárregui wanted this cloth in order to create winter uniforms for his troops. Zumalacárregui's scouts explored this area to carry out this plan. Zumalacárregui meanwhile received information on October 20, 1834 that a convoy of arms was traveling from Burgos to Logroño and that it would use the nearby royal road (camino real) as it neared the Ebro. Zumalacárregui attempted to pursue the convoy on October 21 with four battalions and three squadrons, and he crossed the Ebro at Tronconegro. However, the convoy by now had passed. Zumalacárregui rapidly marched in pursuit of the convoy, but he was stopped at Cenicero by the urban militia there, which supported the Liberals and who were stationed at the church of Cenicero. Zumalacárregui was forced to go around the town and his cavalry managed to reach the convoy, which was in sight of Logroño. Zumalacárregui captured this rich booty, burned down the church of Cenicero, crossed the Ebro on October 22 at Tronconegro, and marched towards Navarre. His troops were then stationed in towns in the valley of Berrueza. On October 21, at the last minute, the Liberals at Vitoria received news of Zumalacárregui's incursion, and Osma ordered O'Doyle to march on the Ebro with his division, composed of the Queen's First and Second Regiments, the First African Regiment, the First and Second Regiments of Carabiniers, and the battalion of Bujalance. O'Doyle was ordered to march on the Ebro at Peñacerrada to cut Zumalacárregui off. O'Doyle reached Peñacerrada on October 22, during the afternoon, and learned that the Carlists were north of the Ebro. O'Doyle marched the next day through the valley of the Ega River, and his troops rested for the night at Lagrán. On the 24th, the Liberals reached Maeztu. The Liberal troops, exhausted and short on supplies, rested for a full day, the 25th. On the 26th of October, the troops left Maetzu, crossed the ridge of Andia, and after marching for 22 km, reached Alegría de Álava. Osma then ordered O’Doyle to disperse the Liberal divisions; the only troops that should remain at Alegría de Álava would be the Queen's First Regiment, First African Regiment, some of the cavalry, and two pieces of artillery, with the rest of the troops cantoned at Guevara (Gebara), Arroyabe, and Ullíbarri-Gamboa (Uribarri-Ganboa), locations that were 6, 12, and 13 km north of Alegría de Álava, respectively. Ullíbarri-Gamboa. O'Doyle disagreed with this order, and consulted his regimental captains, who also thought it was a bad idea. But they carried out the order, abandoning Alegría de Álava and occupying the aforementioned villages. O'Doyle wrote a letter to Osma, expressing his concern with the order. Letter from Manuel O'Doyle to Joaquín de Osma. October 26, 1834. In the letter, O'Doyle expresses his concerns about the orders he has received from Osma to abandon Alegría de Álava. Back of the letter. Zumalacárregui, meanwhile, was in the valley of La Berrueza, 48 km south of Alegría de Álava, and had in his sights, the Liberal troops at Los Arcos of General Lorenzo, who was waiting for reinforcements coming from Cirauqui led by Marcelino de Oraá Lecumberri. Zumalacárregui's aduaneros (customs officers) were watching the movements of the Liberal troops, and thus Zumalacárregui was well informed. The aduaneros were also watching O'Doyle's movements, and when O'Doyle's troops left Alegría de Álava, the aduaneros notified Zumalacárregui, who received this news in the afternoon. However, Zumalacárregui did not have sufficient forces to face an entire Liberal division –but he did have enough to face a few battalions. He thus decided to head for Álava and engage with Liberal troops who were headed for the various aforementioned villages. At nighttime, Zumalacárregui left a few men behind to keep the campfires going and took his troops to Campezo, Zúñiga and Orbiso--a village in the Maeztu area)--where they spent the night. Now Zumalacárregui was 35 km from Alegría de Álava. The Liberal general Lorenzo, seeing the campfires that had been left going at Berrueza, believed that Zumalacárregui's troops had remained there. The battle On October 27, Osma arrived at an early hour at Alegría de Álava, explaining to O'Doyle his reasoning behind his order for the dispersal of the Liberal troops: Osma had received news that the pretender to the throne, Carlos, was at Oñate. O'Doyle's divisions, now arranged as four columns, would depart from the town that same afternoon towards the north, marching at night, to reach Oñate by various routes and apprehend the pretender. The Carlist army meanwhile, fired by a ration of aguardiente given to them by Zumalacárregui (as was his custom before going into battle), was divided into two columns. One of the columns was under the command of Manuel Iturralde, and consisted of the Third, Fourth, and Sixth Battalions of Navarre and the Second Battalion of Guipúzcoa, and had orders to climb the mountains from Saseta. The other column, commanded by Zumalacárregui, consisted of the Guías de Navarra, the First Battalion of Navarre, the Third Battalion of Álava, and the lancers of Navarre, and would advance from Ullíbarri-Gamboa (Uribarri-Ganboa). As they traveled, the Carlists apprehended anybody they came across, such as people working in the fields, and placed them in an enclosure guarded by two soldiers; this they did to avoid anyone from alerting the Liberals of the presence of the Carlist troops. The Carlists soon came across no one around or in the fields, which they intuited signified the nearness of the Liberal army. Zumalacárregui received news that Lorenzo was still not aware of the Carlist advance; Lorenzo remained at Los Arcos. Zumalacárregui would send a small number of troops to attack Salvatierra (Agurain), 10 km east of Alegría de Álava. Zumalacárregui would remain hidden with his troops, meanwhile, in the forest of Chinchetru (Txintxetru), where they would wait for O'Doyle, who presumably would leave his HQ to defend Salvatierra. Iturralde meanwhile would descend from Saseta, hide in the woody mountain slopes south of Alegría de Álava, and, once O'Doyle departed towards Salvatierra, Iturralde would march in parallel. Once Zumalacárregui began the attack at Chinchetru, Iturralde would attack from the right against the Isabelines. As it happened, circumstances favored Zumalacárregui. When the Carlist general marched towards Chinchetru, he came across the governor of Salvatierra who was headed towards Vitoria with some prisoners. At 4:00 PM, O'Doyle's troops began to leave Alegría de Álava, heading towards the north, when the sound of gunfire erupted at Chinchetru. Zumalacárregui increased the overall sounds of gunfire by having his soldiers also fire into the air. Then, he hid in the forest north of the town of Alegría de Álava. O'Doyle stopped heading north and headed towards the east instead, through the hills, a shorter route towards Chinchetru. The terrain was difficult; these foothills towards the range of Andía were woody and not suited for the passage of regular troops. Furthermore, the setting sun caused the weapons of the Liberals to glint brightly; this allowed Zumalacárregui to spot the Liberals easily from Chinchetru. Zumalacárregui ordered the Guías de Navarra to leave the forest and ordered them to the plain between Chinchetru and these hills. The Isabeline vanguard, led by O'Doyle on horseback, was composed of mountain troops (cazadores) and thus marched much faster than the main body of Liberal troops. The Liberal troops soon came across the Guías de Navarra, who were wearing their signature red berets, and were surprised to see the Carlists there. O'Doyle ordered an attack but the Liberal cazadores were quickly pushed back by the Guías de Navarra. When the rest of the Liberal troops arrived, Zumalacárregui ordered the rest of his troops into battle and fierce combat ensued. One source writes that: Meanwhile, the Carlist Iturralde also appeared, attacking the Liberal rearguard and its right flank. The Liberal troops, suffering from confusion, were unable to organize themselves in such a small space, and after having fired an initial volley, were unable to defend themselves from a fierce Carlist bayonet attack. The Liberal troops began to surrender. Meanwhile, the din of battle reached the local villages Guevara, Arroyabe, and Ullíbarri-Gamboa, where the remaining Liberal troops had been stationed. These Liberal troops began to march towards Chinchetru. But soon they encountered Liberal troops who had fled from what was amounting to a massacre, who informed them of what was happening. Thus, the retreating Liberal troops and the troops that had been stationed at these three villages fled to Vitoria, which they reached by nighttime. Aftermath During the night, the Carlists searched the forests between Chinchetru and Alegría de Álava for Liberal troops who had survived the battle and were now hiding. Liberals who were discovered were bayoneted or shot on sight. The Carlists captured the two pieces of artillery that had belonged to the Liberal army, along with corresponding munitions, supplies, and the regimental banner of the Liberal Regiment of Africa. O'Doyle, O'Doyle's brother, and other officers surrendered, and were executed by firing squad the next day. 400 Liberal troops were taken prisoner. However, 250 Liberal troops and their officers maintained order and reached Arrieta by forced march, 3 km away from the field of battle, and they fortified themselves in the church at Arrieta. There they fought against the Carlists who pursued them all during the night. News of this action at Arrieta led Osma to the decision to send soldiers to the rescue of the troops at Arrieta, which would lead to the Battle of Venta de Echávarri (October 28, 1834).

His family escaped the ravages of post-WWII Russian occupation by moving to the United States when he was very young.https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/personality- neuroscience/article/tribute-to-jaak- panksepp-19432017/70DD188254356D1219051A7A1FCEB58C He studied initially at University of Pittsburgh in 1964, and then did a Ph.D. at the University of Massachusetts.https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/discover-interview-jaak- panksepp-pinned-down-humanitys-7-primal-emotions Research Panksepp conducted many experiments; in one with rats, he found that the rats showed signs of fear when cat hair was placed close to them, even though they had never been anywhere near a cat. Panksepp theorized from this experiment that it is possible laboratory research could routinely be skewed due to researchers with pet cats. He attempted to replicate the experiment using dog hair, but the rats displayed no signs of fear. In the 1999 documentary Why Dogs Smile and Chimpanzees Cry, he is shown to comment on the research of joy in rats: the tickling of domesticated rats made them produce a high-pitch sound which was hypothetically identified as laughter. Panksepp is also well known for publishing a paper in 1979 suggesting that opioid peptides could play a role in the etiology of autism, which proposed that autism may be \\"an emotional disturbance arising from an upset in the opiate systems in the brain\\". In his book Affective Neuroscience, Panksepp described how efficient learning may be conceptually achieved through the generation of subjectively experienced neuroemotional states that provide simple internalized codes of biological value that correspond to major life priorities . Temple Grandin draws extensively on Panksepp's work in describing how an appreciation of the primal emotions of 'PLAY', 'PANIC/GRIEF', 'FEAR', 'RAGE', 'SEEKING', 'LUST' and 'CARE' and what triggers them can improve human care of stock animals and the welfare of companion animals. Death Panksepp died on April 18, 2017 from cancer at his home in Bowling Green, Ohio at the age of 73. Books *Panksepp, J., and Davis, K. (2018).

His solo work differed substantially from Test Icicles and was often produced in a lo-fi manner. He received little critical notice in his lifetime, a Dazed Digital editor commented, however, \\"Mehran possessed an incomparable talent that belied his relatively low public profile.\\"  Career  Mehran,along with Rory Attwell, founded Test Icicles in 2004. The band was active until 2006, when it broke up. Mehran began releasing music under the alias Outer Limits Recordings in 2010, which was immediately associated with the era's loose-knit, early hypnagogic pop and chillwave scene. He described himself being influenced mostly by Ariel Pink, R. Stevie Moore, and \\"basically most music that was recorded before 1990.\\" Music journalist Paul Lester characterized OLR as \\"heavenly hooks and catchy choruses\\". Marc Masters of The Wire compared his Foxy Baby album to Ariel Pink's \\"AM pop blender\\", and described the Matrix Metals album Flamingo Breeze as a \\"mini-masterpiece of sub-disco loops\\". OLR issued numerous cassette tapes and limited edition vinyl discs, and according to Mehran, the project lasted until \\"somewhere in the spring of 2011\\". Its first LP release was the compilation Singles, Demos and Rarities (2007-2010), released on April 15, 2013, and was intended to be its only album. A follow-up, Birds, Bees, Babys, Bacteria, was issued on cassette later that year. After OLR, Mehran co-wrote and co-produced Katie Rush's Law of Attraction (2014). He then produced Puro Instinct's Autodrama (2016) and Samantha Urbani's Policies of Power (2017). His last work released before his death was his co-writing and co-production of Ssion's O (2018). Prior to his death, he was working on co-writing and production of Katie Rush's second and third albums, and a debut EP with Marion Belle (also known as Fatal Jamz). The second Katie Rush album Stage Life was released postmortem in April 2019, and his album with Belle was released in August 2019. Death On the morning of July 29, 2018, Mehran was found dead by suicide in his Hollywood home. News of his death was broken by collaborator Zak Mering through social media, who also said that Mehran had just completed work on a planned solo album.

Afonso of Lancaster was the second son of Álvaro, 3rd Duke of Aveiro, and he received this ducal title as a reward for supporting the Spanish Crown. Bernardo de Carvajal y Moctezuma, 2nd Count of Enjarada, is an ancestor of the Dukes of Abrantes, thereby making them descendants of Doña Isabel Moctezuma and the Aztec Emperor Moctezuma II. This ducal family formerly owned the Palacio de los Toledo-Moctezuma at Cáceres in Spain. The Habsburgs were deposed from the Portuguese throne in 1640, two years before this dukedom was created.

It is about an unhappy married couple who are given the chance to understand each other by discovering, quite literally, what they would do \\"if I were you,\\" in the same manner as the novel Turnabout by Thorne Smith. Background This play was one of several attempts Alan Ayckbourn made to write a play involving swapping bodies. In 1990, Body Language was premiered, where a fat woman and a thin woman swap bodies from the neck down following a botched operation. And in 2002's The Jollies, a young boy is transported into an adult's body whilst his mother is transported into a young girl's body. The play was written in January 2006, initially with the title If I Were You, which was then altered to I to I before reverting to the original. However, there were no plans to produce the play that year, as the Stephen Joseph Theatre already planned to produce revivals of Intimate Exchanges and Woman in Mind.Interview with Janie Dee at broadway.com However, on 21 February 2006, Alan Ayckbourn suffered a stroke. As a result, directorship of Intimate Exchanges passed to Tim Luscombe, and the production of Woman in Mind was eventually dropped altogether. Whilst in hospital, Ayckbourn decided to use his latest play as a goal to work towards. I to I was scheduled for the autumn slot vacated by Woman in Mind in June, rehearsed at the rehearsal studio at his home, and the play was announced to the public, now retitled as If I Were You, in July.BBC News, 31 July 2006 It has been argued that If I Were You is part of a trend of Ayckbourn's adult plays taking inspiration from his family plays (in this case, The Jollies, which also deals with the adjustments and insights of being someone else) – the first example being Improbable Fiction and its derivation from The Boy Who Fell into A Book and My Very Own Story. Characters There are five characters in the play. They are: * Mal Rodale, husband, father, and manager at furniture showroom * Jill Rodale, wife of Mal, now full-time housewife and mother * Chrissie Snaith, Mal and Jill's married daughter * Sam Rodale, Mal and Jill's school-age son * Dean Snaith, Chrissie's husband and colleague of Mal When Mal and Jill swap bodies, the actors continue playing their original body. (In other words, the actor who starts playing Mal later plays Jill in Mal's body, and vice versa.) This is in contrast to Body Language where the two actresses continued playing themselves in new bodies. Setting The stage is split into three sections, each a room of the Rodales' house: Mal and Jill's bedroom, the kitchen, and the living room. Like the setting used in Bedroom Farce and Private Fears in Public Places, scene changes are controlled by switching the lighting from one area of the stage to the other. However, in a setting unique to this play, the whole stage is also used to represent the showroom floor at Mal's place of work. The original production at the Stephen Joseph Theatre was staged in the round,Production details on official Ayckbourn website but the productions on the tour were staged in the Proscenium. The play takes place over two consecutive days, one day for each act. The tones of the two acts are very different: the first act is amongst the darkest drama found in Ayckbourn plays, whilst the second act is almost farcical with a happy ending. Synopsis Act One begins as the alarm in Mal and Jill's bedroom goes off, and Mal reaches for it. They rise for breakfast, and Sam, their son, tries to get Jill to sign a permission form for an after-school drama group without Mal knowing, but Mal finds the form and rips it up. It is unclear what Mal does not like about it, other than claiming acting is men prancing around in tights. Sam is openly contemptuous of his father, whilst Mal is openly disappointed with his son, unlike his daughter, Chrissie, who worked hard at school, found her man, got pregnant and got married (in that order). Mal's prized son-in-law, Dean, arrives at the house, and prior to setting off for work together, Dean speaks of how successful his marriage is (his proudest example being his wife making him cooked breakfast every day apart from Sunday when he makes her breakfast). At work, Mal faces a number of problems involving customers and staff and handles them aggressively. He also tries to fend off calls on his mobile from a woman he has been having an affair with on lunch breaks. Meanwhile, at home, Jill confides with Chrissie, her daughter, that she knows of Mal's affair. Chrissie talks of her marriage in a far less positive light than her husband gave earlier, wondering if she has gone frigid after giving birth. Jill notices that Chrissie keeps rubbing her arm, and finds out that Dean sometimes hits her. After school, Sam's news that he got the part he wanted (in spite of no signed form) is little cheer to Jill. Mal and Dean return home having been out drinking, and Dean insists on driving Chrissie and the baby home in spite of Chrissie's pleas not to. Jill and Mal also argue, with Jill clearly regretting not having worked for fifteen years. In a moment left on her own, Jill weeps and says \\"God help us\\". She and Mal go to bed. In the morning, the alarm goes off again, and this time, it is Jill who reaches for the alarm – except that she only reaches as far as Mal would have reached for it. In fact, Jill and Mal have sometime swapped bodies, and the act ends as they make this discovery. At the start of Act Two, Mal and Jill hastily agree not to tell anyone what has happened and to act out each other's lives as normal. Sam notices something is strange – Jill (in Mal's body) daintily and meticulously cleans the kitchen surface, whilst Mal (in Jill's body) slouches and wears the most ghastly choice of clothes but ignores it. Jill goes to work and, to Dean's astonishment, sets to work cleaning the furniture in the shop. She also defuses the problems that Mal created the previous day, although going a little over the top in dealing with a stressed member of staff. Meanwhile, Mal has the chance to get to know his children better as they open up to him, believing him to be their mother. Mal is deflated to learn from Chrissie that Jill knew about his affair all along, but is horrified to discover what Dean has been doing to her. When Sam returns home, he reads out a passage to Mal (as Francis Flute playing Thisbe in A Midsummer Night's Dream), almost moving him to tears. When asking Sam about acting, Mal gives the game away that he is worried his son might be gay. When he learns the real reason Sam acts – that he has a crush on his female drama teacher – Mal proudly says \\"That's my boy!\\" When Dean returns home, Mal punches him on sight. Jill uses the opportunity to end Mal's affair by telling his mistress over the phone that it is too dangerous, pointing out that Jill has just attacked her son-in-law. Jill makes Mal a sandwich, giving Sam a chance to bond with his father. Sam puts his parents' strange behaviour down to aliens. Mal and Jill retire to bed, and Jill says that if they ever get their own bodies back, she must start working again. In bed, in the middle of the night, they find they are back to normal. They agree not to forget what has happened and talk about it in the morning, and the play ends as they sleep in each other's arms. Productions The original production at the Stephen Joseph Theatre had its first performance on 12 October 2006, and an opening night on 17 October 2006.Plays at a glance (Scarborough) on official Ayckbourn website featured the following cast: * Jill Rodale – Liza Goddard * Mal Rodale – John Branwell * Chrissie Snaith – Saskia Butler * Dean Snaith – Andrew Brookes * Sam Rodale – David Hartley The production team were: * Director – Alan Ayckbourn * Design – Roger Glossop * Lighting – Mick Hughes * Costumes – Jennie Boyer In 2007, the production toured, with Richard Stacey replacing Andrew Brookes as Dean and Dominic Hecht replacing David Hartley as Sam. The other three roles were reprised, apart from the first three weeks where Terence Booth played Mal, temporarily replacing John Branwell, who was taken ill. In 2010, Bill Kenwright mounted a new production of If I Were You, directed by Joe Harmston and starring original cast member Liza Goddard.

In many of the reviews, attention was shared between the play itself and Alan Ayckbourn's decision to return to the theatre following his stroke. Those reviews which did so applauded Ayckbourn's decision.Reviews on official Ayckbourn siteThe Daily Telegraph review, 19 October 2006 The comments on the play itself were equally positive in most of the reviews. Credit was given for the scene where Sam moves his father with his Shakespearian speech,The Times review, 19 October 2006 the effective switch between the home and the furniture showroom,The Stage review, 18 October 2006 and the ability of the two leading actors to switch roles halfway through the play.British Theatre Guide review, February 2007 The only major review with a negative slant came from Alfred Hickling of The Guardian, who was critical over the lack of explanation for the body-swapping.The Guardian review, 19 October 2006 However, other reviews were positive about the low-key way the switch was done. Perhaps the most positive comment was made by Dominic Cavendish of The Daily Telegraph: \\"If I were him, I'd take it easy for the next few months.

It was part of the Irish campaign of Edward Bruce, brother of Robert Bruce, king of Scotland. The site of the battle was Skerries near Ardscull in County Kildare. The battle Edward Bruce, earl of Carrick, had landed in Ireland in May the year before, and been proclaimed king of the island in June. Bruce continued on his march south, when on 26 January 1316 the Scottish army was advancing from Castledermot it encountered the English. The Hiberno-Norman forces, summoned by the justiciar of Ireland, consisted of men such as John FitzThomas FitzGerald, Maurice FitzThomas FitzGerald, Thomas FitzJohn, John and Arnold Poer, Maurice de Rocheford, and Miles and David de la Roche. Though these forces heavily outnumbered those of Bruce, internal strife broke out in the Anglo-Irish ranks, a fact that Bruce could take advantage of. Though suffering heavy losses, the Scots held the battlefield, effectively winning the battle.  Aftermath  The official English account of the battle blamed unfortunate terrain and bad luck for the government forces' loss, not an entirely convincing explanation. The same account also claims that the Scots lost many of their greatest men, while their opponents only lost one man. After the battle the Scots plundered the nearby town of Athy\\"Historical Notes on the Town of Athy\\", Journal of the Co.

Here John Hotham, the king's envoy to Ireland, made a great effort to ensure the loyalty of the Irish nobles. By May, however, Bruce had returned to his safe base in Ulster, while Hotham had returned to his new position in England as Bishop of Ely.

Instead, Tom Higgenson revealed his ultimate goal: that he would rather the band \\"reflect back onto The Beatles to 'bring that back- the real songs, the classic kind of feel.'\\" Both producers decided to let the \\"ambiance of the room fill out the recording rather than layer the performances.\\" To produce this kind of sound, the album was recorded in one room with the P.A. monitors and wedges, and no headphones. They even decided to use live drum recordings, rather than fiddling with the artificial sounds of an electric set. Promotion The clothing store Aéropostale started selling the album.

Early life and education  Beaumont was born in 1947 to a large Catholic family in Maastricht. She studied dentistry in the United States in at Forsyth Dental Center and Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusettes but returned to Europe, to start a family in Belgium. Beaumont began her artistic studies in 1977 at the Braine-l'Alleud School of the Arts (Académie de Braine l'Alleud). She received her first solo exhibition in 1983. Beaumont continued her education at La Cambre, Brussels from 1983 - 1985, followed by studies at Hogere Rijksschool van beeldende Kunsten, Anderlecht from 1985 - 1988.  Career  280x280px Beaumont began working in clay and gradually moved into finalizing the work in bronze and cast iron. In 1994, she was honored with a major award from the Centre International d'Art Contemporain, Château Beychevelle, St. Julien, France for her terracotta sculpture group Le Courage. Shortly after, she participated in the second Exposiciòn Internacional de Esculturas en la Calle, organized by the Colegio de Arquitectos de Canarias, in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain, where her work was permanently installed. Since 2005, various museums have held retrospectives of Beaumont’s art, among which the Beelden aan Zee museum in the Hague, the Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Vero Beach Museum of Art and the Baker Museum in Florida, and the Copelouzos Family Art Museum in Athens, Greece. In Brussels, she is widely recognized for her monumental installations, namely Stepping Forward (2008) installed in front of the European Union Council, Le Courage at the entrance of the Erasmus hospital, the public work Le Départ (1996) at Brussels Airport, and Interaction & Self- Protection in Ganshoren. Present in numerous public and private collections, Hanneke Beaumont has an international reputation and her art is exhibited worldwide. Many other public and private collectors have manifested great interest in her work. She now enjoys an international reputation with exhibitions in the US, UK, Canada, Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, The Netherlands, and Switzerland. In the United States, she has held several solo shows at the Contessa Gallery in Cleveland, Ohio. In the United Kingdom, her work has been exhibited in a series of solo shows at Robert Bowman Modern in London. Beaumont has said that she identifies as a \\"clay person”, and many of her finished works retain the marks made in that material, with surfaces left somewhat rough and unrefined. She began working from live models early in her career but later abandoned this. Her forms have been described as androgynous. Beaumont’s sculptures represent ‘Man’ in the broader sense, she addresses grand issues of the human condition. Many of Beaumont’s figures appear neither male nor female, neither young nor old. They do not appear as portraits of particular individuals, nor are they modeled after idealized human forms. Physically, they are approximations of human beings, and as such, they provide a way to consider, from a distance, general ideas about the nature of the human race. In 2014, Beaumont moved her home and studio from Brussels to the Netherlands. She spend her studio time working in Pietrasanta, Italy and Middelburg, the Netherlands, where in early 2015 she acquired an 18th century warehouse as studio.

He played hurling with his local club Rathnure and with the Wexford senior inter-county team in the 1970s and 1980s. Playing career=Club= Quigley played his club hurling with the famous Rathnure club and enjoyed much success. He won his first senior county title with the club in 1971. It was the first of a famous four-in-a-row as further county titles were annexed in 1972, 1973 and 1974. These wins were converted into Leinster club titles in 1971 and 1973. Quigley won further county medals in 1977, 1979 and 1980. He continued his club hurling well into the 1980s, winning both county and Leinster titles in 1986. =Inter-county= Quigley first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Wexford minor hurling team in the 1960s. He won a Leinster title in this grade in 1967 before later lining out in his first All-Ireland final. Cork provided the opposition on that occasion and went on to claim a 2–15 to 5–3 victory. Quigley won second Leinster minor medal in 1968 before lining out in a second All-Ireland final. Cork were the opponents once again, however, the result was the same as 'the Rebels' took the title with a 2–13 to 3–7 win. In 1969 Quigley moved up to the under-21 grade. In this grade he won a Leinster title in 1969 before later lining out in the All-Ireland final. A Cork team that he was well used to provided the opposition on that occasion and won the game by 5–13 to 4–7. Quigley added a second Leinster under-21 title to his collection in 1970 before later playing in his second consecutive All-Ireland final. Once again Cork provided the opposition, however, the game ended in a draw. The replay proved more conclusive as 'the Rebels' trounced Quigley's side by 5–17 to 0–8. In 1971 Quigley was appointed captain of the under-21 team. That year he collected a third consecutive Leinster medal before lining out in the All-Ireland final. For the fifth year in-a-row Quigley faced Cork in a championship decider and, unfortunately, Cork made it five out of five with a 7–8 to 1–11 victory over the Leinster men. By this stage Quigley had already made his debut on the Wexford senior team. He won a senior Leinster medal in 1970 as All-Ireland champions Kilkenny fell in the provincial final. Galway were defeated in the penultimate game of the championship, setting up an All-Ireland final meeting with Cork, Quigley's bête noire an underage levels. For the first time ever the final would be contested over eighty minutes instead of the usual sixty. The game itself was an exciting affair with a record sixty-four scores and eleven goals in all. After a free-flowing game Cork emerged victorious by 6–21 to 5–10. Quigley played in his next Leinster final in 1971. The Kilkenny team of that era, a team often described as the greatest of all time, provided the opposition on that occasion. In fact, it was the first of five successive defeats at the hands of Kilkenny in Leinster finals for Wexford; however, Quigley missed the 1972 decider. In spite of a lack of success in the championship Wexford reached the final of the National Hurling League in 1973. On that occasion Limerick were the opponents, however, victory went to Wexford giving Quigley his first major title at senior level. 1976 saw Wexford and Kilkenny battle it out in the Leinster final for the seventh year in succession. 'The Cats' were going for a provincial six in-a-row and an All- Ireland three-in-a-row, however, Wexford shocked the reigning champions by 2–20 to 1–6. It was a trouncing that nobody expected and it gave Quigley his second Leinster medal. Wexford's championship campaign nearly came unstuck in their next game against Galway. A high-scoring game ended in a 5–14 to 2–23 draw and a replay was forced at the newly opened Páirc Uí Chaoimh in Cork. The second game was just as tense an affair, however, Wexford emerged victorious by 3–14 to 2–14. Their opponents in the All-Ireland final were Cork, a team looking for their first championship title since 1970 when they defeated Wexford. Quigley's side got off to a great start and led by 2–2 to no score after just six minutes, however, Cork settled down and were spurred on with an inspirational display by Pat Moylan. The sides were level at the interval; however, the second-half developed into what was arguably the finest final of the decade. Cork hung on to win by 2–21 to 4–11 as Quigley was left on the losing side. In 1977 Wexford maintained their provincial dominance with another defeat of Kilkenny. It was Quigley's third Leinster medal and the defeat for 'the Cats' brought the curtain down on Eddie Keher's inter-county career. Victory in the provincial final allowed Wexford to advance directly to the All-Ireland final. For the second year in-a-row Cork provided the opposition and another classic looked likely. Wet and windy weather severely hampered both teams, however, the game was still a close affair. For the second year in-a-row Quigley ended up on the losing side as Cork claimed a 1–17 to 3–8 victory. In 1978 Kilkenny were back as champions of Leinster and Wexford had to go back to the drawing board. A new force in the province also emerged as Offaly won their first Leinster titles in 1980 and 1981. Quigley continued playing hurling well into the 1980s, however, after several defeats in the provincial championship he retired from inter-county hurling in 1988. =Provincial= Quigley also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He first played for his province in 1973 as Leinster defeated Munster to take the Railway Cup. Quigley added further Railway Cup medals to his collection in 1974, 1975 and 1977. Post-playing career Towards the end of Quigley's playing days the Gaelic Athletic Association celebrated its centenary year in 1984. Throughout the year a series of special events were held while special team selections were also named. While a special GAA Hurling Team of the Century was named, a special team of players who never won an All-Ireland medal was also selected. Quigley's contributions as a player were recognised when he was picked in the left centre-forward position on that 'fantasy' team.

History Veith House's history dates back to the 1800s. The Halifax Protestant Orphanage (also known as the Protestant Orphan's Home) was in existence from 1857 to 1969. The orphanage was founded by Reverend Robert Fitzgerald Uniacke (rector of St. George Church) in 1857 and was previously located on North Park Street. This became home to a countless number of children, both girls and boys. Among those who worked there as staff during the 1890s was matron Lucy Anne Rogers Butler, an educator and social worker who had spent her early 30s documenting her 1870s travel experiences with her sea captain husband.Laidlaw, Toni Ann. \\"Rogers, Lucy Anne Harrington\\", in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 13.

This region is in northern Bavaria, Germany. The DDM was founded in 1977.  Facilities  The museum is in the former locomotive shed (Bahnbetriebswerk) at Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg station.250 It comprises a 15-road roundhouse, a turntable, water cranes, a coaling facility and a Ruge coal crane in a newly built 'old fashioned' working coal yard.  History  The locomotive shed was built in 1895 by the Royal Bavarian State Railways and extended in 1923 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn. Amongst others, pusher locomotives e. g. DRG Class 95s (ex-Prussian T 20s) and Class 96s (ex-Bavarian Gt 2x4/4 Mallet locomotives) were stationed there. One example of a Class 95 may be seen in the museum.

Although ceramic technicians have long understood many of these relationships, the advent of computer software to automate the conversion from batch to formula and analysis has brought this science within the reach of many more people. Physical properties of glazes in fired products (like thermal expansion, hardness, index of refraction, color and melting temperature or range) are directly (but not solely) related to the chemistry. Properties of glass melts like viscosity and surface tension are also principally products of chemistry. Technicians in the ceramic tableware, artware, , sanitaryware, glass, fiberglass, bottle glass, optical and related industries all use this science. In ceramic chemistry, fired glazes are viewed as composed of oxides (examples are SiO2, Al2O3, B2O3, Na2O, K2O, CaO, Li2O, MgO, ZnO, MnO, Fe2O3, CoO). Each oxide is known to contribute specific properties to the fired glass. Many materials suppliers publish chemical analyses of their products that cite percentages of these oxides as well as volatile components (components that burn away during firing giving off gases and fumes such as H2O, CO2, SO3). For example, in traditional ceramics here are some examples of what the application of ceramic chemistry can accomplish. * Fix glaze defects like crazing, blistering, pin-holing, settling, clouding, leaching, crawling, marking, scratching, powdering. * Substitute frits, incorporate better, cheaper materials, or replace no-longer-available ones. * Adjust glaze melting temperature, gloss, surface character and colour (in ceramics colour is a matter of chemistry). * Identify weaknesses (e.g. proximity to volatile firing zones, use of unreliable materials) in glazes to avoid problems. * Creating and optimizing base glazes to work with difficult colours or stains and for special effects dependent on opacification, crystallization or variegation. * Create glazes from scratch and use native materials in the highest possible percentage. In ceramic bodies the physical properties of the final fired product are often more related to the firing curve, the physical properties (e.g. particle size and shape, decomposition history) of the ingredient materials and the mineralogy and interaction between the different particle types.

It is the first lift to join the two side-by-side mountains. It held the world record for the longest free span between ropeway towers—3.03 kilometres (1.88 miles) until 2017 when the Eibsee Cable Car exceeded it by 189m. It is still the highest point above the ground—436 metres (1,430 feet.) (A temporary aerial tramway in Switzerland used between 1979 and 1986 had larger span.) The Peak 2 Peak Gondola was built by the Doppelmayr Garaventa Group in 2007 and 2008 at a cost of CDN$51 million. The Peak 2 Peak Gondola is the first Doppelmayr \\"3S\\" tri-cable lift in North America; there are four similar but smaller lifts in Europe which were built in 1991, 1994, 2002, 2004 and 2010 in Switzerland, Austria, France and Germany. Whistler- Blackcomb has touted the gondola as an iconic attraction and uses it to transport skiers in the winter months as well as sightseers year round. History and planning Whistler Mountain was opened by the Garibaldi Lift Company in 1965 and Blackcomb opened under separate ownership in 1980. It wasn’t until 1997 when Intrawest, the owner of Blackcomb Mountain, bought Whistler Mountain and brought both mountains together on a single lift ticket. Ever since, many skiers wanted a way to be able to ski both mountains in one day without having to ski down to the village and ride multiple lifts to get back to the alpine. In 1997, Whistler-Blackcomb's Director of Mountain Operations, Hugh Smythe, and Paul Mathews, president of Ecosign Mountain Resort Planners, took a trip to Zermatt, Switzerland. After seeing the number of lifts connecting resorts around the Matterhorn, they got the idea of connecting Whistler and Blackcomb Mountains with a ropeway. A number of problems prevented a connection for years. Fitzsimmons Creek and the steep faces on either side were unsuitable as ski terrain and are protected land. A traditional chairlift or gondola would have had to go all the way down one mountain, across Fitzsimmons Creek, and up the other side, resulting in a long lift ride and environmental impacts. A gondola that could cross the valley without going to the bottom was the best option. Whistler-Blackcomb had to consider the extremely high cost of building such a lift. The resort conducted research that indicated 92% of winter visitors and 86% of summer visitors would use the gondola at least once. HSBC Bank Canada and Scotia Capital agreed to provide Intrawest with financing for the project, allowing it to move forward. Intrawest announced the gondola project to employees and the Municipality of Whistler’s Council on September 19, 2005, and held a community open house shortly thereafter. At the time, construction was expected to start in the summer of 2006 and continue for 2 years for an opening for the 2007-2008 ski season. On March 30, 2006, it was announced that construction would be delayed by one year. Whistler Blackcomb announced on April 17, 2007, that groundbreaking would occur in May 2007. Construction The Peak 2 Peak Gondola's Blackcomb Terminal under construction in July 2008. The Peak 2 Peak Gondola's Whistler Terminal under construction in July 2008. Whistler- Blackcomb broke ground for the Peak 2 Peak Gondola in a ceremony on May 21, 2007. The Doppelmayr Garaventa Group would supply the gondola itself and Timberline Construction was the general contractor and Glotman Simpson were the Consulting Engineers. Fatzer AG of Switzerland would make the four track cables and one haul rope that would carry the gondolas across the valley while CWA, also of Switzerland, would build the 28 gondola cabins. 80 workers from Whistler Blackcomb, Doppelmayr Garaventa, Timberline Construction and North Construction worked throughout the summer of 2007. Work completed on the Blackcomb side by that summer included the relocation of the top terminals of the Solar Coaster Express and Catskinner chairlifts on Blackcomb, excavation of both terminal locations, foundations for both terminals, foundations for all four intermediate towers, and steel erection of towers 2 and 3. Construction stopped for the winter in November 2007. During the winter, the remaining two gondola towers and each terminal’s machinery were built at the Garaventa factory in Goldau, Switzerland and the Doppelmayr factories in Wolfurt, Austria and St. Jerome, Quebec. Fatzer AG manufactured the four track cables and haul rope that would suspend the gondola cabins. The five spools of cable left Europe by ship on April 10, 2008. By the time construction started again in the spring of 2008, ten feet of snow still covered the mountains and concrete had to be transported up the mountain by helicopter. Towers 4 and 1 were completed in early spring using mobile cranes. The five cables arrived in the Port of Vancouver, Washington, USA on June 9 and were shipped to Whistler via train, arriving on June 16. Vancouver, Washington was used because it owns the largest mobile harbour crane on the West Coast of North America. To handle the 90-tonne reels, a German-made Goldhofer heavy-haulage trailer and tractor made its way from Montreal, QC to Whistler to take care of the transport from the train yard up the mountain. The Goldhofer trailer has four sections with six axles, each. Each axle has eight wheels. The trailer also features a hydraulic sliding system, which enabled the reels to be unloaded from the railcars in Whistler without a crane. Since there is no crane to lift each reel onto the truck, this trailer features sliding steel plates that essentially scoop the load from the train and set it onto the trailer deck. The five cables were trucked up Blackcomb Mountain for pulling across the valley starting June 19. Their entire journey from Switzerland to the top of Blackcomb Mountain was coordinated by OmniTrans Corporation. Each track cable was winched down Blackcomb Mountain to the valley floor, then up Whistler Mountain. While the cables were pulled for twelve straight weeks, terminal construction continued with the gondola machinery being mounted on concrete foundations. The drive terminal on Whistler Mountain had the gondola’s motors installed in an underground vault. After the gondola machinery was installed, steel enclosures were constructed and covered with a blue, translucent material. On August 29 and 30, the two ends of the haul rope were spliced together in a braid to form a continuous loop that could pull the cabins. The splice was performed by Norm Duke of Wyoming, who is one of only a few splicers in North America. The splicing process took 14 workers from Whistler- Blackcomb and Doppelmayr Garaventa over 15 hours to complete. The 28 sky cabins arrived in Whistler starting on August 26. The first twelve cabins crossed the span on September 19, 2008 with a single Doppelmayr engineer, Mathias Zudrell, aboard. The remaining cabins were put on line and the system underwent extensive testing until its Grand Opening on December 12, 2008. Criticism Inside the Peak 2 Peak Gondola's Blackcomb Terminal The impact of such an expensive project on lift ticket prices was always a concern, especially because the gondola would not open any new ski terrain. When the project was announced in 2005, residents were promised that Peak 2 Peak access would be an optional add-on to a lift ticket or season pass. In a 2005 open house, the resort estimated the additional cost on a season pass would be CDN $59. At the time, Whistler-Blackcomb was attempting to secure a tax exemption from the municipality of Whistler for the increased assessments caused by the new terminal buildings. When season pass prices were announced for the Peak 2 Peak’s inaugural season in August 2008, only early bird passes were allowed to decline the Peak 2 Peak option. Whistler-Blackcomb said it was \\"not specific\\" about the Spirit Pass when it had said the Peak 2 Peak access would be optional. In May 2007, Whistler-Blackcomb announced the naming rights to the gondola were for sale for an undisclosed price, however the gondola has retained the Peak 2 Peak name. Features=Statistics= * Length: 4.4 km/2.73 mi * Capacity: 4,100 people per hour * Line Speed: 7.5 metres per second (16.8 miles per hour) * Ride Time: 11 minutes =Cables= The cables were manufactured by Fatzer AG, a Swiss company that develops, manufactures and markets wire ropes worldwide. The Peak 2 Peak cables include four stationary track ropes, two in each direction, which act like railroad tracks for the cabins. Each track rope weighs approximately 90 metric tonnes. There is a single haul rope which moves in a continuous loop and pulls the cabins. This cable weighs more than 80 metric tonnes. There are a total of of cable on the Peak 2 Peak Gondola. =Terminals= The Peak 2 Peak Gondola terminal buildings are the two largest lift terminals in the world. To create the concrete footings, platforms, masts, and columns, of concrete had to be trucked and helicoptered up the mountains. The Whistler terminal, which houses the drive motors and backup engines in an underground vault is 26 metres (85 feet) wide and 42 metres (138 feet) long and has 228 tonnes of steel. The Blackcomb Terminal is 26 metres (85 feet) wide and 48 metres (158 feet) long and contains 279 tonnes of steel. The Blackcomb terminal can house 15 cabins, the Whistler terminal 13 cabins in a cabin parking area when the system is not in use. =Towers= The second tower on the Blackcomb end of the gondola There are four intermediate towers, two on Whistler Mountain and two on Blackcomb Mountain that support the cables, which range in height from 30 to 65 metres (100 to 210 feet). Combined, they contain 400 metric tonnes of steel. =Cabins= One of the 28 carriers on the Peak 2 Peak Gondola The 28 CWA-manufactured gondola cabins hold 28 people each, with 22 seated and 6 standing. Twenty-six of the cabins are painted red and while, while the remaining two are painted silver, and have glass floors. =Safety systems= The Peak 2 Peak Gondola has a number of unique safety systems beyond what a normal ski lift features. The gondola has high wind stability and is designed to operate in winds up to 80 km/h. Whistler-Blackcomb has called the Peak 2 Peak Gondola the most wind tolerant lift on Whistler Blackcomb. Testing at other Doppelmayr 3S installations have measured sustained winds at 120 km/h (75 mph) with no decrease in performance. The lift is powered by an electric motor on Whistler Mountain; however an auxiliary diesel engine can take over in the case of primary engine failure or if there is a power outage. The lift also has a redundant braking system. Both bullwheels have emergency brakes to stop the gondola if there is a primary braking system failure. In the event of a catastrophic failure, an evacuation can be performed. For cabins that are near the terminals, passengers are lowered down by rope from the cabins. For cabins that are too high off the ground for a rope evacuation, cabins are winched along the track cables to towers 2 and 3 where passengers are then lowered to the ground by rope by Ski Patrol members. In addition, the gondola is equipped with a state of the art Obstacle Collision Avoidance System that uses radar to alert aircraft of the gondola as an obstacle. Strobe lights and loud noises over all radio frequencies are used to alert pilots who come too close to the gondola. In the media The grand opening ceremony on December 12, 2008 featured Steve Podborski as emcee and Red Bull Air Force members BASE jumping from the middle of the gondola. The Peak 2 Peak Gondola was the subject of a 2009 Discovery Channel documentary. Crews began filming the project during groundbreaking in May 2007. The documentary aired at 9 pm on December 23 and at 2 am on December 24, 2009, on Discovery Channel Canada. It was titled \\"Peak 2 Peak: Building the Worlds Biggest Gondola\\". The gondola was also featured in the History Channel's show Modern Marvels in the episode \\"Winter Tech,\\" which showed the technology behind the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games. On February 6, 2014, Graham Dickinson carried out an illegal BASE jump from the highest point of the Peak 2 Peak Gondola and landed safely in the valley below. In order to exit the gondola, Dickinson and a female accomplice (Kathleen Adams) had to pry open the doors causing an estimated $10,000 worth of damage. They posted a video of the jump on YouTube as a tribute to Shane McConkey. On February 13, 2014, the RCMP announced that they had arrested the woman and recommended charges of obstruction and mischief over $5,000. One day later, BASE jumper Mike Douglas condemned the stunt saying \\"This guy seems to have gone about it in all the wrong ways. He caused a lot of damage in the process which I think is not cool.\\" See also * List of spans References Ski lifts Sea-to-Sky Corridor ","title":"Peak 2 Peak Gondola"},{"id":"18555552","text":"Ali Cimen is a Turkish journalist currently working in France.

During the French Revolutionary Wars she served in the West Indies, the Channel, and the Mediterranean. During the Napoleonic Wars she first served in the Americas, but from early 1811 on, she was armed en flute and served as a troopship until she was broken up. Design and construction Mermaid was one of the eight-ship Active class, designed by Edward Hunt. She was initially ordered from the shipwright George White, of Woolwich Dockyard Shipwright on 27 August 1778, and laid down in September 1778, but the order moved to John Jenner in April 1779. On 21 March 1782 the order was canceled and moved instead to Thomas Pollard, at Sheerness Dockyard, and the frigate was again laid down, on 29 July 1782. She was launched on 29 November 1782, and commissioned for the ordinary on 30 December 1784. She was commissioned again between June and August 1790 for sea duty. She had cost £12,854 to build, with another £2,539 paid for her fitting out in 1790. The Woolwich work had cost £1,807. Early career Mermaid was commissioned under Captain Cuthbert Collingwood in June 1790 during the Nootka Crisis. She sailed to the West Indies, but returned in April 1791 and was then paid off. French Revolutionary Wars She was again fitted out, this time at Portsmouth for £3,446, between February and May 1793, commissioning in March that year under Captain John Trigge. She was assigned to the Mediterranean, departing Britain on 22 May 1793. On 27 May she and captured the 20-gun privateer Général Washington, and on 30 May 1793 Mermaid and captured the 16-gun privateer Angélique. Mermaid also captured a 14-gun privateer in June that year. Mermaid then joined Admiral Samuel Hood's fleet at Toulon. =The Caribbean= She came under the command of Captain Henry Warre in June 1794, and then sailed to the Leeward Islands on 5 May 1794. There on 10 October 1795 Mermaid captured the 10-gun off Grenada. However, the brig's crew of 50 men, together with some 120 troops, were able to get ashore before Mermaid could capture them. Brutus had been in the company of a ship that temporarily escaped. On 14 October Mermaid was able to find and capture the ship after a fight that cost Mermaid one man killed and three men wounded. The French ship was the ; she was armed with eighteen guns and had some 250–260 men aboard at the start of the action, one of whom was a French general on his way to take command of Grenada. In the action, the French lost 20 men killed and some wounded. shared by agreement. The Royal Navy took Republicaine into service as HMS Republican. On 30 October 1795 Robert Waller Otway received promotion to post-captain; he took command of Mermaid the next month at Grenada.Marshall (1823), Vol. 1, Part 2, p.691-701. In February 1796 Mermaid briefly came under the command of Captain Charles Davers, but by April Otway had returned. At the time Grenada and several of the other islands were in a state of insurrection, with the slaves joining the French inhabitants under the leadership of Julien Fédon in opposition to the British. Mermaid was off Labaye, in company with , when a British blockhouse came under attack from a battery that the rebels had erected. Otway led a landing party of seamen and marines that stormed the battery and destroyed it. Soon after, a large contingent of British troops landed near Labaye. At the same time two French vessels, under British colours, arrived with French troops from Saint Lucia. The British general wished to withdraw, but Otway declined to permit him to do so. Instead, Otway rode up a hill on which there were some field guns that he ordered to fire on the French vessels. The battery commander did so, with the result that the French vessels withdrew, having failed to land their troops. Favorite pursued the French vessels but could not keep up after losing her topmast. The British troops then attacked and captured Pilot Hill. On 22 July Mermaid and Favorite recaptured the sloop Two Sisters. Then on 8 August, Rear-Admiral Pole, in , was lying at The Saintes with several British vessels, including Mermaid, when a strange vessel was sighted. Pole dispatched Mermaid to investigate. The vessel turned out to be the 40-gun . An engagement ensued in which Mermaid managed to inflict heavy casualties although Vengeance outgunned her. When the 40-gun British frigate came up Vengeance retired, taking refuge under the batteries in the roads of Basse-Terre. Mermaid suffered no casualties, but later reports were that the French had lost 12 men killed and 26 wounded. Mermaid and , on 10 December 1796, captured the French brig-corvette Général Leveau, of 16 guns and 80 men, off San Domingo. On the south side of the island Mermaid also captured a Dutch brig that was carrying several thousand dollars and a cargo of dry goods, and a Spanish schooner, which was carrying raw hides. Mermaid then captured the privateer Liberté Générale on 7 March 1797. On 20 April 1797 Mermaid formed part of a squadron under Captain Hugh Pigot in the 32-gun frigate , that also included , the 14-gun brig , and the cutter . The squadron cut out nine ships at Jean-Rabel without suffering any casualties.Clowes (1897–1903), pp. 334 & 335.James (1837), Vol. 2, p.100-1. Most of the ships the British were able to cut out were actually British merchant vessels that French privateers had captured. =English Channel and the Mediterranean= James Newman-Newman took command of Mermaid around mid-1797. Mermaid captured \\"sundry prizes\\" between 28 December and 1 January 1798, and 16 January and 28 February. She also shared in s capture or recapture of Aventure, Hazard, and Daphne, and with Phaeton and a number of other vessels in the capture or recapture of the chasse maree Marie Perota, the Sea Nymphe, the Mary, and an unnamed French sloop. Additionally, on 19 February Mermaid, Phaeton, and , , and recaptured Lighthorse. Two days later, Mermaid and Sylph met up with Phaeton, having captured the American vessel Eliza, which had sailed from Batavia for Amsterdam via Boston, where she had changed her papers but not her cargo. Phaeton sent Sylph into port with Eliza and the French privateer Legere, which Phaeton had captured. In addition to Mermaid, Phaeton, and Sylph, Anson and Nymphe shared in the proceeds of the capture of both vessels. The same squadron shared in the recapture, on the next day, of the Danish Indiaman Graff fon Bernstoff. On 21 May Mermaid captured the Two Brothers; and the hired armed cutter Cygnet shared in the proceeds of the capture. While patrolling off the Penmarks on 29 June 1798 Mermaid, , and came across the French frigate , which was bound for Lorient.James (1837), Vol. 2, p.219. At the Action of 30 June 1798, The British squadron manoeuvred to cut Seine off from land, but Mermaid soon lost contact, leaving Pique, under Captain Milne, and Jason under Captain Charles Stirling, to chase down the Frenchman. The chase lasted until 11 o'clock at night, when Pique was able to range alongside Seine and fire a broadside. The two exchanged fire for several hours, with the lighter Pique suffering considerable damage to her masts and rigging. Jason then arrived and Captain Stirling called upon Milne to anchor, but Milne did not hear. Determined to see Seine captured, Pique pressed on but suddenly ran aground. Jason too ran aground before she could swing way. Furthermore, Seine was observed to have grounded and to have lost all her masts in the process. As the tide rose Seine was able to swing into a position to rake the two British ships. With difficulty the sailors of Jason dragged several guns to the bow in order to exchange fire, while Pique was able to bring her foremost guns to bear. Already under fire from both British ships, the appearance on the scene of Mermaid convinced the French to surrender. Jason had lost seven killed and 12 wounded, while Pique sustained casualties of one killed, one missing, and six wounded. Seine however had 170 killed and 100 wounded. Mermaid was next involved in the capture of the in the aftermath of the Battle of Tory Island. Mermaid was detached to operate off Corunna and together with Sylph, captured the Spanish packet Golondrina on 24 March 1799 after a 15-hour chase. Golondrina was pierced for 20 guns but was carrying only four. She was under the command of Don Juan El Busto and was 39 days out of Havana on her way to Corruna with a cargo of sugar, cocoa, and indigo. Newman described her as being of 200 tons burthen, coppered, and a remarkably fast vessel. In April 1799 Captain Robert Dudley Oliver, replaced Newman-Newman in command of Mermaid off France and Italy. Thereafter Mermaid appears to have spent much of her time patrolling the coasts and intercepting coasters. On 4 December Mermaid captured the Portuguese vessel Voador. On 10 and 11 January 1800, Mermaid captured the French privateers Redoubtable, General Massena, and Vengeur. A month later, on 10 February, Mermaid recaptured a Neapolitan brig that was on her way from Palermo to Leghorn with a cargo of \\"locusts\\". Mermaid was in sight but too far away to render assistance when , of 24 cannons, captured the brig , of 16 cannons, and drove the ship Cerf, of 14 guns, and the xebec Joliet, of six guns, on shore. The whole action took place under the guns of two shore batteries and so close to shore that Peterel grounded for a few minutes. On March 10 and 11, Mermaid captured three French merchant vessels: *ketch Bagnolese, which was sailing from Port Maurice bound to Marseilles with a cargo of oil; *a Tartane; and *a Settee, in ballast. Between March 15 and 16 Mermaid captured seven merchant vessels: *French tartane Francesco Xaviera, which was sailing from Louano to Marseilles with a cargo of oil; *French settee Agriculture, carrying deals; *Genoese gondola Signora della Latera, sailing from Cabic to Genoa with wheat; *Genoese brig Ligurier, sailing from Genoa to Cette with oil; *French settee sailing from Cannes to Marseilles with oil and soap; *Spanish brig Nostra Senora del Carmen, sailing with oil; and, *Genoese tartan Annonciation, sailing from Arrache to Marseilles with a cargo of oil. Between 2 and 6 April, Mermaid captured and destroyed nine merchant vessels that were carrying grain and wine to French forces at Genoa. The vessels had taken refuge under the guns of a fort in the small islands off Cape Croisette, south of Marseilles. One evening Oliver anchored Mermaid within grapeshot of the fort, which he cannonaded for an hour while two boats went in and cut out six vessels. The British suffered no casualties. On 11 May, Mermaid captured the settee St Joseph, which was selling from Sardinia to Marseilles in ballast. Four days later Mermaid captured the Genoese settee Nostra Dame de Rosario, which was carrying wheat from Marseilles to Genoa. Four days after that Mermaid captured a settee, in ballast. Then on 1 June about 12 leagues southward of Les Hières Mermaid captured , which was eight hours out of Toulon. Cruelle was a brig of six guns, four of which she had thrown overboard during the chase, and had a crew of 43 men under the command of Ensigne de vaisseau Francis Xavier Jeard. She had been a bomb vessel but had left her mortar at Toulon. She was carrying supplies for Malta when Mermaid intercepted her. The British took Cruelle into service under her existing name. In the month between 19 July and 20 August, Mermaid captured ten vessels, five of which she burnt or scuttled. Four were the French settee Bien Venue, which had been sailing from Fréjus to Marseilles with deals (long wooden planks), the French settee San Antonio, which was sailing from Oneglia to La Silva with a cargo of snuff, the French settee Saint Pierre, which was sailing from Bandol to Marseilles with firewood, and an unnamed Spanish settee carrying barilla. Mermaid ran one French settee, which was carrying wheat, ashore and scuttled her too. The three vessels Mermaid kept were the Spanish sloop Saint Juan Baptiste, which was sailing from Cette to Genoa with wine, an unnamed Spanish settee carrying barilla, the French settee Sainte Barbe, which was sailing from Marseilles with wheat, the French ketch Notre dame de la Providence, which was sailing from Marseilles to Genoa with wine and flour, and the Genoese settee Conception, which was sailing from Bandol to Genoa with wine. On 11 October Mermaids boats cut out from La Vendour four vessels carrying wine and flour. On 18 February 1801, Mermaid and captured the ship Esperanza (or Esperance), which had sailed from Tunis with a cargo of silk, cotton, and other merchandise. Three days later, Mermaid captured the Genoese settee Beato, sailing from Selloa to Port Maurice with wine. The next day, Mermaid captured three settees: *St. Christe, carrying oil and almonds; *Vierge de Carmo, carrying wine; and *Rhone, carrying oil and rice. Then on 17 May Mermaid captured the French transport brig Barthelemy, which was sailing from Toulon to Cartagena. After the signing of the Treaty of Amiens, which ended the war between Britain and France, Mermaid returned to Britain where in August 1802 she was paid off and placed in ordinary at Woolwich. Napoleonic Wars Mermaid was fitted out again between June and September 1803, commissioning in August that year under Captain Aiskew Hollis. She spent the period between 1804 and 1807 at Jamaica. During the first half of 1804 Mermaid recaptured the British ship Stranger. Mermaid was at Havana in October 1804 when war with Spain was declared. Hollis successfully brought some British merchant ships in the harbour out and then convoyed them to safety.Gentleman's Magazine, October 1844, p.429. She was then on the Halifax Station. On 6 July 1806 Mermaid and captured the American brig Jennet. Mermaid was paid off again on 20 August 1807. Mermaid returned to service after being refitted at Woolwich between September 1808 and March 1809. She was recommissioned in February 1809 under Captain Major Henniker. She then sailed on 12 June 1809 with a troop convoy bound for Portugal. She was recommissioned as an 18-gun troopship in January 1810, and was fitted out as a troopship at Chatham Dockyard between October 1810 and February 1811. She came under the command of Commander William Henry Percy in 1811. Percy and Mermaid then transported troops between Britain and Iberia for the Peninsular War. By April 1812 Mermaid was under Commander David Dunn, serving in the Mediterranean. In October 1813 she participated in the attack on Trieste. On 30 November, , and Mermaid embarked 1,000 men of the Italian levy, under the command of Lieut-Colonel Catanelli, at Milazzo. and joined them. They sailed the same evening and, accompanied by and Imperieuse, landed them at Viareggio. Some 600 cavalry and infantry from the Livorno garrison attacked the troops, who routed them, capturing two field pieces and a howitzer. From the prisoners they learned of the weak state of the garrison and asked to be re-embarked to be taken to Livorno. Boats of the squadron towed them off the shore in country vessels and the ships towed the whole to the Livorno roads. The troops and marines landed on the evening of 13 December and they occupied the suburbs of the town. Some 700 cavalry and infantry attacked the marines, who opened to let the cavalry pass through them, killing all but 14 men and two officers. Of these, the Italian Levy killed all but one officer. The marines charged and routed the remainder, killing, wounding or taking prisoner between 250 and 300 men. Edinburgh had three marines wounded. The 1000 men of the Italian Levy marched inland and captured Lucca. They then returned to Via Reggio. There was further fighting around Pisa and Via Reggio before the expedition re-embarked aboard the British warships. In early 1814, a British squadron, consisting of , , , Mermaid, , and joined a force of 1500 Austrians to capture Trieste and its 80 guns. Fate Mermaid was first offered for sale at Plymouth on 9 August 1815. The buyer had to post bond of £3000, with two sureties, that he would not resell her and that he would break her up within 12 months from the date of sale. She was broken up at Plymouth in November 1815. Notes, citations and references=NotesCitationsReferences= *Clowes, W. Laird, et al.

City officials, agencies, and organizations cooperate with rural farmers to grow food more locally, as well as protect waterways in the New York metropolitan area. The New York City Department of Education operates a school-time and summertime breakfast/lunch program. However, New York City is also deprived of supermarkets in several neighborhoods, and the city has combatted this issue by allowing extra street vendors to operate in the city. To encourage food safety, New York City also has a restaurant-grading system that it introduced in 2010. Because of its various food programs, New York City has become a model for food systems internationally. Watershed protection and local food Most of the city's water comes from the Catskill Mountains watershed Government officials, labor organizers, non-profits, community advocacy groups, and residents have a great dependency on rural farmers who develop New York City's local food shed. The process of linking agriculture with New York City's urban markets has been largely built upon the fact that New York City's water supply comes from the protected Catskill Mountains watershed in Upstate New York. New York City's water supply system, the largest surface storage and supply complex in the world, yields of water daily, with most of this water originating upstate. This water is unfiltered, and a filtration system would require $8–10 billion in construction as well as $1 million in daily maintenance. Instead, New York City's watershed is protected by severe New York City Department of Environmental Protection restrictions that prevent pathogens and nutrients from entering the water supply. As a result of protection of the watershed, New York is one of four major cities in the United States with drinking water that is pure enough to not require purification by water treatment plants. However, the implementation of such stringent regulations is costly to New York State farmers. = Greenmarket = The Union Square Greenmarket To protect the water supply from runoff and promote regional agriculture, rural and urban New Yorkers developed an alliance called the New York City Watershed Whole Farm Program, which promotes sustainable agriculture in New York State. With financial assistance from the city, upstate farmers reduce pathogen, nutrient, sediment, and pesticide runoff. Meanwhile, New York City's urban population serves as a local market for upstate farmers, particularly through Greenmarket, a farmer's market founded in 1976 by the Council on the Environment of New York City. Upstate farmers sell their products at Greenmarket locations. Greenmarket provides regional small family farmers with opportunities to sell their fruits, vegetables and other farm products at open-air markets in the city. The program expanded to 45 markets in 2006—the largest expansion in its then-30-year history—but the resulting Greenmarket expansions were too small or too infrequently patronized to be profitable. The most famous Greenmarket location is the Union Square Greenmarket, held four days a week throughout the year. In 2003, 250,000 customers a week purchased 1,000 varieties of fruits and vegetables at the market. =School lunches= New York City provides over 40,000 meals a day to children through the SchoolFoods program. Most of the fruit served in New York City Department of Education-operated public and charter schools is local. A project to bring New York State apples to New York City school cafeterias has also increased fruit consumption among school children. , policy work was focused on the task of bringing more local food to school lunches to give children healthy meals while supporting agriculture in the region. However, there is no plan to expand the program . The NYCDOE also has a summer-meals program operated by SchoolFoods, which offers free lunches to children under 18. These summer lunches are distributed at over 1,100 parks, pools, libraries, schools, and shelters every year. Over 7 million lunches were distributed in summer 2012. Supermarket crisis Inside a supermarket in East Harlem New York City faces a supermarket shortage in several neighborhoods that is closely linked to health epidemics. At the request of the Mayor's office, the Department of City Planning studied supermarket need in the city. As a result, in April 2008, the Department found a widespread shortage of supermarkets, identifying several \\"food deserts.\\" It identified food deserts as a key factor in why over 700,000 people in New York City had diabetes, over 1.1 million New Yorkers were obese, and another 2 million were overweight. Health problems are especially prevalent in minority communities. For instance, supermarkets in predominately-minority Harlem are 30 percent less common than on the predominately-white Upper East Side; while 20 percent of Upper East Side bodegas carried leafy green vegetables, only 3 percent of those in Harlem did so. Three million New Yorkers live in neighborhoods with high need for grocery stores and supermarkets, such as Harlem and Washington Heights in Manhattan; Bushwick, East New York, and Sunset Park in Brooklyn; Corona, Jamaica, and Far Rockaway in Queens; the South Bronx, Williamsbridge, Wakefield, and Pelham Parkway in the Bronx; and St. George and Stapleton in Staten Island show the greatest need for full-line supermarkets. In February 2008, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn announced the creation of a Statewide Supermarket Commission that would identify state and local policy solutions to expand supermarkets and keep them open. The Commission would be led by the Food Trust and the Food Bank for New York City, in partnership with the City's Food Policy Coordinator and the Food Industry Alliance. Simultaneously, the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1500, which represents grocery store workers, worked to create healthy food options for all New Yorkers through supermarkets, community-supported agriculture, urban agriculture, and farmers' markets. =Green Cart program= As part of an ongoing effort to increase access to healthy foods, the city created 1,000 new \\"Green Cart\\" permits in 2008. These permits were meant for street vendors who exclusively sell fresh fruits and vegetables, which must be raw and whole. These permits can be used only in neighborhoods where 15% or more of the population reported having consumed zero servings of fruits or vegetables in the previous 24 hours. Local businesses initially opposed the initiative, but a reduction in the number of permits allowed the program to be signed into law. After the program was approved, the city received funding and support from several partners to help further the program. A 2014 study by the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs showed that although there were only 166 Green Carts in operation, these green carts were instrumental in raising exposure to healthy foods in poorer neighborhoods in Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. The same study found that of these Green Carts, there were none on Staten Island.  Restaurant grading system  Big Daddy's Diner in Manhattan with an \\"A\\" grade displayed in the window A grading system for New York City's 24,000 restaurants was launched in July 2010. Restaurant inspectors show up unannounced to the restaurant to inspect its hygiene, then give a ranking of A, B, or C depending on how many code violations the restaurant has. An \\"A\\" grade is considered the best grade (with 0 to 13 violations), with the highest standard for cleanliness; a \\"B\\" grade indicates 14 to 27 violations; and a \\"C\\" grade, the worst grade, indicates at least 28 violations. Restaurants then receive placards containing the restaurant's grades and post them in a prominent location. Each placard is embossed and tagged with a number as an anti-counterfeiting measure. Restaurateurs who get a \\"B\\" or \\"C\\" could request a re-review of their restaurants, getting \\"Grade Pending\\" placards in the meantime. As part of the launch, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene hired 23 inspectors, bringing the total number of inspectors to 180. It also raised the number of annual visits from 60,000 to 85,000. Michael Bloomberg, the then- mayor of New York City, stated that the practice was meant to reduce the number of foodborne illnesses and improve food safety. However, some restaurants avoid being regulated by registering as supermarkets or warehouses. Within 18 months of the grading system's implementation, salmonella infections dropped by 14%, but the total amount of the fines issued rose more than 145%, prompting large criticism. In 2014, the grading system was restructured to reduce fines. In 2016, ninety-three percent of restaurants got an \\"A\\" grade, the highest percentage in the history of the grading system.  International model  Because of the way in which urban and rural New Yorkers have cooperated to create a protected ecosystem that brings healthy local food and clean water to a large urban population, New York City has become an international food systems model. The United Nations invited New York farmers, workers, retailers, and NGOs to act as representatives to the UN's Commission on Sustainable Development at its headquarters in New York City. The city hosted the UN's City and Farm Linkages Showcase in May 2008 to show New York State's urban–rural partnership to international leaders.

It serves approximately 820 students in grades 5 and 6. It is located in the Loma Portal neighborhood of Point Loma. It draws students from all six elementary (K-4) schools in the \\"Point Loma Cluster\\", as well as accepting students on a space- available basis from throughout the district under the District's Volunteer Enrollment Exchange Program (VEEP) and Open Enrollment Program.Dana School website History Dana is named after Richard Henry Dana, Jr., author of the book Two Years Before the Mast which described the San Diego and Point Loma areas in the 1830s. Before the opening of Dana, students in grades 7-12 attended Point Loma Junior-Senior High School, now Point Loma High School. The dates of Dana's opening are not entirely clear. A review of Point Loma High School yearbooks suggests that Dana opened in 1941 for 7th-graders only, served grades 7-8 from 1942 through 1945, and became a full 7-8-9 junior high school in the fall of 1945.Aerial photographs from c. 1941 show a partially completed school, but with some of today's wings missing. Review of Point Loma High School yearbooks of the era shows all six grades present at Point Loma HS through 1941. The 1942 Point Loma HS yearbook shows no seventh grade, which implies that the 1941-42 seventh graders were at Dana. The 1943, 1944, and 1945 yearbooks show only grades 9-12, so presumably Dana functioned as a grades 7-8 middle school in those academic years. Starting with the 1946 Point Loma HS yearbook, only grades 10-12 appear, so from 1945-46 onward, Dana evidently served grades 7, 8, and 9, with Point Loma HS serving grades 10-12. This format was retained until Dana's closure in 1983. During the 1940s-1950s the school doubled as a Cold War era bomb shelter. In 1983, the school was closed as part of sweeping changes occasioned by declining enrollment. Prior to the realignment, two area junior high schools (Dana and Collier) served grades 7-9, and fed Point Loma High School which served grades 10-12. After the realignment, Dana was closed; Collier was renamed after artist Steven V. Correia and restricted to grades 7-8; and Point Loma High became a four-year school serving grades 9-12. In the wake of the closure, the school district clashed with local residents. The district sought to lease or divest the Dana site; community activists, led by Ann Tripp Jackson (then president of the Point Loma Association), lobbied for its reopening as a school. Jackson's efforts led, among other victories, to the school site's being permanently rezoned for educational use.Dana Times: About Ann Tripp Jackson; 11/7/2007 During the protracted battle, however, the site stood vacant for 10 years. Finally, it was reopened in 1993 to serve as a school district office building.\\"By July, Dana Junior High a nuisance no longer\\", San Diego Union Tribune, October 11, 1992 Community support for returning Dana to its use as a school remained strong. In 1998, state-mandated school occupancy guidelines provided the final impetus for reopening Dana as a school.\\"Board votes to revive Dana campus\\", San Diego Union-Tribune, October 29, 1997 Another major realignment of local schools took place, with local elementary schools becoming K-4, and Dana reopening as a central school for all local 5-6 graders: 1998-1999 for grade 6, expanding to grade 5-6 in 2001-2002. This alignment -- one middle school for grades 5-6 and one for grades 7-8 -- is unique in the district. The school's auditorium was christened the Ann Tripp Jackson Auditorium to honor Jackson and others who led the successful preservation effort. In October 2011 the school district proposed closing Dana and a dozen other district schools as a cost-saving measure. The proposal would have sent Point Loma area fifth graders back to elementary school, while combining grades 6, 7 and 8 at Correia Middle School. However, the district withdrew the proposal after a community outcry, including a \\"save our schools\\" rally at Dana attended by 600 people. Campus The campus includes a softball field and a baseball field; the latter is the home field for Point Loma High School baseball. It is named for Major League pitcher David Wells, a PLHS alumnus. In 2014 the school district approved a plan proposed by Wells to replace the grass at Wells Field with artificial turf and perform other upgrades. The upgrade was completed and dedicated in December 2014. Wells now serves as head baseball coach at PLHS.

Education is considered a right in order to achieve a goal of serving \\"… society by developing the full potential of all citizens as free, creative, thinking and acting human beings and there- fore to serve society by helping achieve equality of the essential conditions of human living.\\" Structure With its head office located in Ottawa, Ontario, the NUS/UNE had a democratic structure in which elected delegates put forward, debated and decided policy through an Annual General Meeting held between April 30 and May 15 of each year. AGM locations were held in each province on a rotational basis. The Union recognized individual student unions and provincial organizations as members pending a two/thirds majority vote by Central Committee. Each member organization elected one delegate to represent on Central Committee which was made up of three national directors, one treasurer, one executive officer, one chairperson, one women's commissioner, one bilingual member-at-large, one representative of the Association of Student Councils’ Board of Directors, and up to ten provincial representatives. Regional or provincial organizations elected their representatives to Central Committee and all other Central Committee members were elected by the membership at large at each AGM. In addition to the Central Committee there were several standing committees and a caucus: Budget Committee (oversaw finances and controlled where dues were spent), Women's Caucus, and a Small Institutions Caucus. Creation and initial development NUS/UNE was created by students in 1972 as a response to looming post secondary education cuts from the federal government. The federal government instituted a ceiling on Post Secondary Education matching grants to provinces and territories. The prospect of reduced federal transfers for universities, increasing costs, and an all-loan student aid plan proposed by the Council of Ministers of Education, compelled students to reorganize where the Canadian Union of Students had left off in 1969. During 1972, in the province of Ontario, the Ontario Federation of Students (OFS) was organized in response to fee deregulation and tuition increases. A member local of OFS was the University of Windsor Students' Administrative Council, which was pressing for the reorganization of a national student group. In May 1972 an inaugural conference was hosted at University of Windsor in which 26 Canadian university student unions attended. This conference laid the foundation and set the priorities and objectives of a new national student organization, which was very similar to the priorities and objectives of the Canadian Union of Students (NUS/UNE's predecessor organization of the 1960s). On 3–5 November 1972, the National Union of Students/l'Union nationale étudiants was officially formed in Ottawa by 51 delegates representing student councils and unions from across the country. Notably absent from the NUS/UNE at this time were Québec students and Atlantic Canadian students as their delegates were reported to have walked out. Between 1973 and 1976, initial policy was formed and finances were organized and solidified in order to consolidate the national student movement. During these years the office was moved from University of British Columbia's Alma Mater Society in Vancouver, British Columbia to Ottawa, Ontario. In 1976/1977 the NUS/UNE was more fully organized and financially stabilized with the Atlantic Federation of Students, British Columbia Federation of Students, Alberta Federation of Students and Ontario Federation of Students, as affiliates, however, their partnership relationship with l'association nationale des étudiants du Québec (Aneq) was tenuous. The national office of the NUS/UNE employed three staff people and several campaigns were launched. By the end of 1976, NUS/UNE was on firm organizational and financial ground and had by this time launched several nationally coordinated campaigns that involved grass-roots participation at the campus level. Campaigns The National Union of Students and its provincial affiliates were engaging in campaigns across the country to oppose government funding cuts to universities and colleges. Tuition levels, which had been frozen in the later half of the 1960s and early 1970s, were on the rise starting in 1972 and throughout the rest of the 1970s. The years 1977 and 1978 were years in which nationally coordinated student actions against tuition increases, organized by the NUS/UNE and affiliates, were held across the country. In 1977, 1978, and 1979, the British Columbia component of NUS/UNE was actively protesting against tuition increases. The NUS/UNE also planned a National Student Day (which BCFS participated in) to protest increasing barriers to post -secondary education.\\"National student protest set for fall\\".

Also, in 1977 Newfoundland students at Memorial University, St. John's, were on the offensive, in coordination with NUS/UNE, in response to fee increases announced by the University on March 13. Aside from education accessibility issues, student housing, women's equality, and student employment were seen as important issues on which to lobby the government. During its time, the NUS/UNE received criticisms from students that the Union did not address other issues such as poverty, war, and environmental degradation. Some student leaders saw the NUS/UNE as too narrowly focused on lobbying government officials over \\"bread and butter\\" issues and not enough on issues \\"more important than free tuition.\\"\\"BCSF and NUS seek $2 student levy\\" The Ubyssey, 16 November 1976. Accessed March 4, 2008 Amalgamation and transition 1978-1981 In 1978 the NUS/UNE and the Association of Student Councils (AOSC—the predecessor to Travel Cuts), formed in 1975, were affiliated and \\"cooperative relations\\" were established with Québec students through L’Association nationale des étudiants du Québec. By 1980 student leaders sought to better solidify the working relationship between AOSC and NUS/UNE and as a result discussions occurred at the May AGM in Halifax, Nova Scotia—, to work towards consolidating what had been organized to that point. A joint AOSC-NUS/UNE plenary was held in which debate and planning occurred. Delegates at the conference discussed creating a cooperative services program and building a framework for a federation that recognized and supported provincial components as well as supported a federal organization. Meetings were held that summer between several provincial organizations and NUS/UNE. The Winnipeg conference in October 1980 approved plans to create a new federation. During 1980 campus-wide referenda were held in 23 campuses in which individual students voted yes or no for the new organization. The pro federation side won 21 out of 23 referenda by wide margins. The following year another 20-25 referenda were held, with most being successful. A conference held in Lethbridge in May 1981 and a Carleton University conference in October that year produced the constitution, formally creating the Canadian Federation of Students. Women students and the women’s movement in the NUS Nigel Moses focused his study on young women's activism in the (Canadian) National Union of Students. He starts with the reforming of the national student organization in 1972 to the signing of the National Union of Students’ (NUS) Declaration of the Rights of the Woman Student in 1979. He examines the issues NUS engaged such as violence against women and abortion rights, to sexism and outright hostility toward feminists at meetings. Moses describes the development of the women's committee and caucus and shows how women's activism and support for NUS was central to the survival of the organization. Moses asserts that NUS would not have survived the right-wing attack on NUS in the mid-1970s (a referendum-based withdrawal campaign) had it not been for the widespread support of women students on individual campuses. Moses is critical of the historiography of the Canadian women's movement in the 1970s because it completely ignores the role of youth and women students in the women's movement. Contrary to all accounts of the women's movement in the 1970s, Moses shows convincingly that women students and young educated women were a major animating force of white feminism in NUS, on campus, and in local communities.

Sid Haig is the executive producer and is featured on the cover artwork. He also provides the introductory narration on the track Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde. Their third recording, Sins of The Past., was released in 2011 and included saxophones. In 2015 VH1 listed The Young Werewolves as a defining band within the Horror Rock genre.

It is located off First Parish Road in Scituate Center, Massachusetts, United States. Built in 1902 to enclose a steel water tank, it is a major local landmark. The Scituate Water Company stopped using the tank in 1988. The tower is listed as both an American Water Landmark and in the National Register of Historic Places. It has become a popular tourist site, featuring sweeping views of the South Shore, Old Scituate Light, Minot's Ledge Light and the nearby First Trinitarian Congregational Church. Description and history The tower is a steel frame structure standing in height, its tank and steel superstructure enclosed in a stylistically eclectic wooden shell. It is shingled to the top of the enclosed tank, where there is a band of bracketing. Above this are two circular chambers, one to house bells and the other a clock. The tower is covered by a conical roof. The steel water tank was built in 1900 by the Scituate Water Company, the local municipal water supplier. At the same time, Thomas W. Lawson, a wealthy Boston businessman, was building his \\"Dreamwold\\" estate next door. Upset by the view of the utilitarian tank, Lawson negotiated with the company to enclose it. Lawson commissioned the Meneely Bell Foundry of West Troy, New York, to install ten bells at the top of the tower. These bells range in size from three hundred to three thousand pounds. This chime system was originally designed to be played either from the bell room eighty feet above the ground or on the console of the clavier room. The tower is equipped with an internal sprinkler system, after a similar wooden water tower in East Boston was destroyed by fire in the early 1900s.New England Water Supplies – A Brief History, M.

The film was entered into the 21st Berlin International Film Festival. The film is loosely based on the 1848 short story \\"White Nights\\" by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Plot The film begins in Paris with Jacques, an unidentified young man, trying to hitchhike a ride. He travels to the countryside with a family and spends the day walking alone. He whistles and rolls somersaults. The scene cuts back to traffic at night in the city, and the opening credits appear. The next scene is of Marthe, standing at a bridge, at the brink of suicide. Jacques is walking by and stops her. He urges her back onto the street, indicating a police car stopped nearby. They sit by the bridge and chat about their lives. The scene cuts to flashbacks. Marthe is a young woman who lives with her mother in a flat. To make ends meet, her mother rents a spare bedroom to male boarders, the most recent of which is a graduate student. In one scene during the flashback, Marthe stands nude in front of her mirror, either scrutinizing or admiring her body. While doing this, she hears the boarder knocking on her wall. She ignores him at that point, but eventually Marthe and the boarder become lovers, without her mother knowing. Sadly, immediately after their affair begins the boarder has to move to the United States to study at an American university for a year. The lovers promise to be faithful to one another and reunite at the end of the year. At the present time, Marthe has learned that her lover returned to Paris several days ago and has made no attempt to contact her, leading to her despair and suicide attempt. Jacques' story is also told in flashbacks at this time. He is a young artist who lives alone in a desolate little flat that doubles as his studio. In the present time, Jacques comforts Marthe and advises her to write to her lover. Marthe says she will, but she asks if Jacques might take the letter for her to friends of her lover and return with his response the following night. When Jacques wonders how the letter could be procured so quickly, Marthe pulls her letter, addressed and ready, out of her pocket. During the daytime scenes of the movie, Jacques works on his paintings. Part of his artistic process involves recording himself on a tape recorder telling the story of meeting Marthe and loving Marthe. He also records himself repeating Marthe's name. While he paints, he plays his recordings. He also listens to the recordings while delivering Marthe's messages and, in one scene, while riding a bus, scaring two middle-aged women. Jacques' canvases are large, around 6 ft by 4 ft. He paints with them flat on the floor, crouching over them. He uses broad strokes and primary colors. Jacques acts as messenger between Marthe and her lover. The lover never writes back to Marthe, and she is devastated. But by the fourth night, she professes her love for Jacques, who loves her as well. They kiss, and he buys her a red scarf. Marthe and Jacques are walking down the street, arm-in-arm, when they run into Marthe's former lover. Marthe runs to her lover and kisses him. Then she runs back to Jacques and kisses him. Finally, she returns to her former lover, and they walk off together, leaving Jacques alone. Jacques returns to his flat and paints, listening to his recordings.

Opened in 1924, it became one of the leading theatre clubs in London. History Café de Paris first opened in 1924 and subsequently featured such performers as Dorothy Dandridge, Marlene Dietrich, Harry Gold, Harry Roy, Ken Snakehips Johnson and Maxine Cooper Gomberg. Louise Brooks made history when she worked there in December 1924, introducing the Charleston to London. Much of the early success of the Café de Paris was due to the visit of the then Prince of Wales who became a regular guest, often dining with notables from high society across Europe.Cafe de Paris Shady Old Lady's Guide To London. Retrieved 6 February 2011 Cole Porter was a regular, as was the Aga Khan. =World War II= On the outbreak of World War II, the venue lowered its entry prices. It became less socially exclusive and attracted a more mixed clientel, including many members of the armed forces on leave. On 8 March 1941, the café was bombed soon after the start of a performance and at least 34 people were killed and around 80 injured. Two bombs fell into the basement ballroom down a ventilation shaft and exploded in front of the stage. The victims included 26-year-old bandleader Ken \\"Snakehips\\" Johnson, his saxophonist Dave \\"Baba\\" Williams, other band members, staff and diners. =Post-war= The venue did not reopen until 1948 but re-established itself as one of the leading theatre clubs in London, playing host to Judy Garland, Josephine Baker, Frank Sinatra, Ava Gardner, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, James Mason, David O. Selznick, Jennifer Jones, Tony Hancock and Grace Kelly. In the 1950s Noël Coward often performed cabaret seasons at the Café de Paris as did Marlene Dietrich. It was also used in the 2006 music video for I Think We're Alone Now by Girls Aloud. In the 1980s the venue experienced a revived popularity, hosting scene locations for films including Absolute Beginners and The Krays. Today the venue is used regularly for film location, and has been used for scenes in The Queen's Sister (based on the life of Princess Margaret) and in The Edge of Love (based on the life of Dylan Thomas). =21st Century= Brian Stein and his Maxwell's Restaurants Group purchased the venue in 2002. The Café de Paris, which hosts regular cabaret shows on Friday and Saturday nights, has a dress code for its club and dining room, which states: In fiction The 1941 bombing of the Café de Paris is described in a chapter of The Attenbury Emeralds by Jill Paton Walsh. The bombing and its aftermath have a considerable bearing on the investigation carried out by Lord Peter Wimsey in that book. The café, and the 1941 bombing, are major plot devices in the 2011 novel Moon Over Soho by Ben Aaronovitch. Disguised as the Café Madrid, this event is also featured in a scene in The Soldier's Art, Anthony Powell's eighth novel in his A Dance to the Music of Time series, on which several of the characters in the series are killed when \\"a bomb hit the Madrid full pitch.\\" The Café de Paris and its 1941 bombing are discussed in the episode \\"Safest Spot in Town\\" in the BBC 4's Queers, a series of monologues in response to the fiftieth anniversary of the Sexual Offences Act 1967 and are mentioned in the novel Transcription by Kate Atkinson. The bombing of the Café de Paris is a main plot point in Matthew Bourne's production of Cinderella which is set during WW2 in London. It is the location of the main ball/party at the heart of the fairy tale. Act 2 begins with the cafe having just been bombed, destroyed and full of dead bodies. Then an Angel (the fairy Godmother equivalent) reverses time and brings the cafe fully to life. There is a passing reference to the air-raid in Barbara Pym's A Few Green Leaves.

The shortage began when many supermarkets left mixed-income central city neighborhoods after civil disturbances in the late 1960s and 1970s.Ferguson, Bruce and Barbara Abell. \\"Attracting Supermarkets to Inner-City Neighborhoods: Economic Development Outside the Box.\\" Economic Development Commentary. Winter 1998, pp. 6-14. By 1984, store openings exceeded closings nationally but the opposite held in cities and the trend continues. The reluctance of large chains to open in urban areas is termed by some activists, \\"supermarket redlining.\\" Studies suggest that 21 of America's largest cities experience a grocery gap characterized by fewer stores and less square footage per store.Cotterill, R.W. and A.W. Franklin. 1995. The Urban Grocery Store Gap. Food Marketing Policy Center Dept. of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of Conn. The poorest neighborhoods typically have about 55% of the grocery square footage of the best-off neighborhoods. The migration of supermarkets to the suburbs contribute to the creation of so-called food deserts. Simultaneously, there is a lower prevalence of independently owned grocery stores in low-wealth and predominantly black neighborhoods and a greater proportion of households without access to private transportation in these neighborhoods.Morland et al. \\"The Contextual Effect of the Local Food Environment on Residents’ Diets,\\" American Journal of Public Health. November 2002, Vol. 92, No. 11 Supermarkets generally provide food at cheaper prices than the bodegas and pharmacies that service inner-city areas. A study that compared supermarkets, neighborhood groceries, convenience stores, and health food stores in San Diego, California found that supermarkets had twice the average number of 'heart-healthy' foods compared to neighborhood grocery stores and four times the average number of such foods compared to convenience stores.Morland et al. \\"Neighborhood Characteristics Associated with Location of Food Stores and Food Service Places.\\" American Journal of Preventive Medicine. 2002. Vol. 22, No. 1. pp. 23-29. Therefore, less supermarkets can mean less easy access to healthy foods, high prices for healthy foods that are available at smaller stores and health problems that result from a consequent unhealthy diet. Causes Grocery stores typically have only 1-2% profit margins,Goldstein, Amy. \\"In Cities, Healthful Living Through Fresher Shopping.\\" The Washington Post. (Maryland Edition) Oct. 15. 2006. so the difficulties involved in running an urban supermarket are often seen as too costly in an already-risky business. A combination of other factors make urban neighborhoods seem less-than-ideal for grocery store executives. =Market= Urban stores in low-income neighborhoods generally have less demand for the profitable luxury goods that are more popular in suburban stores. Also, people who shop with food stamps usually buy fewer nonperishable items like toiletries and impulse items, the things that bring stores their highest profits. Instead, urban stores must stock a variety of lower-volume items geared to multiethnic tastes.Eckholm, Eric. \\"In Market, Hopes for Health and Urban Renewal.\\" The New York Times. May 25, 2007. Compounding the problem, chain stores are generally unfamiliar with ethnic preferences. Chains tend to develop a formula that works for their core market, which consists of middle- class, white suburbanites. One obstacle to supermarket growth is that developers tend to overlook the market potential of urban communities. Underserved, urban neighborhoods tend to be composed of populations with lower incomes on average, but the density of an urban environment also means that city neighborhoods tend to have more income per acre than suburban areas. Studies by the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City in Boston found that \\"nearly 8 million people who live in the nation's poorest urban communities have a combined $85 billion in retail spending power, which is far greater than all of Mexico.\\"Fletcher, Michael A. \\"More Retailers Are Sold on Cities.\\" The Washington Post. March 5, 1999. pp. E01 =Stereotypes= Prejudices have biased marketing research and prevented supermarkets from seeing the potential of urban locations. National marketing firms have provided grocery store executives with statistics derived from flawed modeling techniques. These statistics include erroneous information about population decline, the perpetuation of stereotypes about the people who live in urban communities, and miscalculated income information.Pawasarat, John and Lois M. Quinn. \\"Exposing Urban Legends: The Real Purchasing Power of Central City Neighborhoods.\\" The Brookings Institution, 2001. Meanwhile, media portray urban areas as poor and dependent, contributing to supermarket executives' skepticism. In fact, urban areas usually consist overwhelmingly of working households with a substantial share of middle-income people. =Security= A problem in urban and suburban stores alike, shoplifting is 6% to 8% of supermarket revenues. Fear of crime also acts as a big deterrent for investors, but some cities interested in developing new grocery stores have placed police stations near development sites in order to allay developers' fears. =Land= The expense and scarcity of land in urban environments pose some of the greatest problems for supermarket developers.Jones, Charisse. \\"Cities bring markets to the needy.\\" USA Today. Nov. 9, 2006. Finding sites for urban development also involves fees, complexity, length, and unpredictability. Today's suburban supermarket model requires more space than older, urban facilities can accommodate, meaning that urban supermarket development often requires the construction of new facilities. And, while suburban supermarkets are typically , urban supermarkets are only on average. This means that urban supermarkets can sell significantly fewer products than suburban stores, which contributes to fewer profits. Community issues A grocery store's 24-hour lighting \\"does a lot for the sense of safety and community in the neighborhood,\\" because supermarkets can be a safe haven. Citizens feel a \\"dramatic change in atmosphere,\\" after new supermarkets are built. In addition, new supermarkets can be used as location of community programs—health exams, nutritional education, eye exams, voter registration, birthdays for children, Western Union wire transfers so immigrants can wire remittances, selling event tickets, having Driver’s License renewal facilities, and providing phones for discount international calls. Besides contributing to a community’s overall well-being, such services make a grocery store more appealing to urban consumers: developing the services that urban citizens desire is a crucial way to make new supermarket development work. By engaging with local organizations, supermarkets can create a link with a community that will contribute to security, reduction in shrinkage, and provide for better selection and effectiveness of employees. Organizations (such as churches) can help in hiring decisions, and security guards can come from the community. These make security more effective, bring jobs to communities, and make customers brand-loyal. Grocery should also confer with local religious officials about religious diets. Stores should also keep in mind the shopping habits of urban consumers, who often rely on monies distributed to them at the beginning of each month. Stores may want to \\"staff to accommodate strong demand in the first two weeks of the month, slack purchases in the last week, and heavier traffic that purchases less per customer in general,\\" according to the shopping habits of urban consumers. Grocery stores should consider developing diversity departments within supermarket administration to identify minority-owned suppliers and potential employees.Purvis, Kathleen. \\"Lack of transportation compromises health.\\" Charlotte Sun. Feb. 09, 2003. Racial issues Of 216 US census tracts studied, the ratio of supermarkets to residents for predominantly white areas is 1:3816 versus 1:23,582 for predominantly black neighborhoods. Only 8% of black Americans lived in a census tract with at least one supermarket; 31% of Whites live in a census tract with at least one supermarket. In fact, aside from region and economic health, studies find that proportion of blacks in the population can affect an area's likelihood of having a supermarket. Case studies Many cities and states across the US have recognized the urban supermarket gap problem and have developed plans to address the issue of food access. Additionally, the U.S. federal government established the Healthy Food Financing Initiative. The initiative provided more than $400 million in funding from the Treasury Department, USDA and Department of Health and Human Services to promote expanding access to nutritious foods, including developing and equipping grocery stores and other small retailers to sell healthful food in low-income rural and urban communities that currently lack this option. =Pennsylvania= In April 2003, Pennsylvania passed the nation's first statewide economic development initiative aimed at improving access to markets that sell healthy food in underserved rural and urban communities. The legislation devoted $100 million to agriculture projects, including the development of grocery stores and farmers' markets, and $40 million to support the development of 10 new stores in underserved communities across Pennsylvania.Flournoy, Rebecca and Sarah Treuhaft. \\"Healthy Food, Healthy Communities: Improving Access and Opportunities Through Food Retailing.\\" PolicyLink and the California Endowment, 2005. The resulting Fresh Food Financing Initiative was a public-private partnership in association with The Food Trust started in 2004 with state seed funds. The program encouraged the development of new supermarkets by providing grants of up to $250,000 or loans of up to $2.5 million per store to defray the infrastructure costs of developing a new store. Up to 2009, $41.8 million in grants and loans have funded 58 stores. Success of the initiative led to the creation of similar programs in at least seven states and cities, like the New York City Food Retail Expansion to Support Health (FRESH) program. =New York City= Like many other cities in the US, New York City faces a supermarket shortage that is closely linked to health epidemics. At the request of the Mayor’s office, the Department of City Planning studied supermarket need in the city and, in April 2008, found a widespread shortage of supermarkets. This shortage causes a lack of healthy, fair-priced food options for many New Yorkers who live in a food desert. Food access issues are partly responsible for the facts that diabetes now affects over 700,000 people in New York City, over 1.1 million New Yorkers are obese, and another 2 million are overweight.\\"Going to Market: New York City's Neighborhood Grocery Store and Supermarket Shortage Health problems are especially prevalent in minority communities, and statistics indicate a racial dimension to the crisis: Supermarkets in Harlem are 30% less common than on the Upper East Side, and while 20% of Upper East Side bodegas carried leafy green vegetables, only 3% of those in Harlem could say the same.New York City Council - The Council of the City of New York Three million New Yorkers live in neighborhoods with high need for grocery stores and supermarkets. Neighborhoods such as Central and Spanish Harlem and Washington Heights in Manhattan; Bushwick, Bedford Stuyvesant, East New York and Sunset Park in Brooklyn; Corona, Jamaica and Far Rockaway in Queens; areas of the South Bronx, Williamsbridge/Wakefield and portions of Pelham Parkway in the Bronx; and St. George and Stapleton in Staten Island show the greatest need for full-line supermarkets.Socioeconomic & Housing - Going to Market: New York City’sNeighborhood Grocery Store andSupermarket Shortage In February, 2008, Speaker Christine Quinn of the City Council announced the creation of a Statewide Supermarket Commission to identify state and local policy solutions to encourage new supermarket development and prevent supermarkets from closing. The Commission was led by the Food Trust and the Food Bank for New York City, in partnership with the City’s Food Policy Coordinator and the Food Industry Alliance. Simultaneously, the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1500, which represents grocery store workers, is working to create healthy food options for all New Yorkers through supermarkets, Community- supported agriculture, urban agriculture, and farmers' markets. The FRESH program attempts to increase access to full-service grocery stores in designated \\"underserved\\" areas with help in zoning incentives, abatements of land and building taxes for 25 years and other tax subsidies such as sales tax exemptions on building materials. =California= In Oakland's flatlands, the development of low-income communities, lowered real estate values, zoning restrictions, land parcel sizes and property taxes discouraged supermarkets and other full-service food retailers. Corner stores, convenience stores and liquor stores took root where commercial parcels were too small to accommodate a grocery store. Overall, supermarket penetration largely drove down the number of grocery stores in West Oakland from 137 in 1960 to 22 in 1980. By the 1990s, many supermarkets in the flatlands also closed their doors to invest in more profitable areas. By 2005, The California Endowment and its then-$26 million initiative California FreshWorks set out to increase availability of healthy food options by investing in grocery stores in low- income and minority communities. As of 2014, about $264 million had been raised from a variety of investors. =Illinois= The Illinois Fresh Food begun with a $10 million state grant was set up to finance full-service grocery stores in neighborhoods with little access to fresh foods. Chicago's Retail Chicago Program is outreach program for retailers, brokers, and developers to introduce them to the many community retail development opportunities in Chicago and expedite their entry into these new markets by serving as a \\"One Stop Shop\\" to assist them during their site selection process.Retail Chicago Program =Other states= Similar programs created after Pennsylvania's initiative include the New Jersey Food Access Initiative and Colorado Fresh Food Financing Fund ad at the city level with New Orleans Fresh Food Retailer Initiative and Cincinnati Fresh Food Financing Fund. Economic effects Besides causing a lack of access to healthy foods, the urban supermarket gap also means that inner city neighborhoods lack the jobs and tax revenues that grocery stores provide. Strategies Where supermarket developers have neglected some urban neighborhoods, city governments and non- profits can work together to market the potential of inner city areas to grocery store executives. Chicago’s planning department provided an information guide with a database of suitable land parcels to executives at a grocers’ expo in 2005. Many of Oakland’s existing food retail businesses are located within Redevelopment Areas, allowing them to qualify for redevelopment fund assistance.Unger, Serena. Wooten, Heather. A Food Systems Assessment for Oakland, CA: Toward a Sustainable Food Plan. Oakland Mayor’s Office of Sustainability, University of California, Berkeley, Department of City and Regional Planning. June 21, 2006 The Food Systems Assessment Report for Oakland suggested the creation of Food Retail Enterprise Zones, whereby food retailers that provide nutritious foods in poor neighborhoods are exempt from Oakland business taxes. It also suggested programs, like the Green Business certification program could award “Green and Healthy Oakland” certification to retail establishments that stock food or offer menu items conforming to specific criteria (fresh, nutritious, local, etc.) Market leaders close urban stores, even if they are showing a profit, to focus on the most productive stores in the suburbs. But \\"operators in second and third place in a metro area may seek to expand their core clientele outside the highly contested, white suburbs to other areas and groups, such as the mixed-income neighborhoods and ethnic clients in the central city.\\" Baltimore initially attracted \\"low-level\\" chains and \\"now, upscale, full-service stores wants to locate in areas they had previous ignored.\\" Executives’ fears of security costs may be easily abated: Rochester clinched the deal with a Tops supermarket by offering to locate a police station at the development site. Hiring locals as security guards helps decrease security issues and losses to shrinkage. Criticism Despite the widespread efforts to address supermarket shortages and food deserts, not all researchers are convinced that such areas are common. At least one medical review and a later government report have suggested that food deserts are relatively rare. Nevertheless, their purported existence continues to drive significant public health expenditures.

He graduated at the Hungarian School of Theatrical- and Film Arts in 1950. At the time he was already a familiar face in studios. He was a successful screenwriter during the 1950s before beginning to direct films a decade later. He made his first feature film, Nyáron egyszerű in 1963. He made his most famous film, A tanú (The Witness) in 1969, but it was banned at the time and wasn't released until 1979. The film became a cult classic in Hungary; it is a political satire about the early-1950s Communist regime. Bacsó later continued to make mostly political and satirical films, for a wider audience. He made various genre films, trying his hand in musicals, comedies, etc. He continued filmmaking up to his later years, however his last two films were generally dismissed by critics and the public alike as badly written and low quality works. His 2001 film Hamvadó cigarettavég (Smouldering Cigarette) was a biopic of Hungarian actress and singer Katalin Karády.

It is one of the first municipal creations of the town after its incorporation in 1871, and is the resting place of many of its early and prominent residents, including Amory Maynard, founder of the Assabet Woolen Mill and namesake of the community. The cemetery was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NR#04000425) on May 12, 2004. Description and history Glenwood Cemetery is located at the northeast corner of Parker Street (Massachusetts Route 27) and Great Road (Massachusetts Route 117), a short way south of the town center. It has entrance is on Great Road, roughly midway between Parker Street and Old Mill Road, and on Parker Street, nearly opposite Walker Street. The cemetery has two distinct sections, reflecting its growth over time. The oldest portion of the cemetery is in size, and was purchased by the town in 1871, the year of its incorporation out of portions of Sudbury and Stow. This area was laid out in a version of the style of the then-fashionable rural cemetery movement, with a circular lane at the entrance and a series of parallel lanes behind. At the center of the circle there was originally a gazebo, which was to be a focal point of the cemetery. It was destroyed in the New England Hurricane of 1938. The main gate (image) is not the original. It replace an earlier cast iron gate in 1928. The majority of the trees in the cemetery are sugar maples, planted after the hurricane to replace downed trees. About two dozen burials pre-date the official creation of Glenwood Cemetery, suggesting that it was functioning as a privately owned cemetery before the land was purchased by the town. East of this original portion is the \\"new cemetery\\" section laid out in the 1930s, using labor funded by the Works Progress Administration. It has a series of concentric lanes in a roughly ovoid shape, and is joined to the old section by a single lane. The Maynard family crypt in Glenwood Cemetery (Maynard, MA) The Maynard family crypt is a prominent feature on the north side of Glenwood Cemetery, within sight of passers-by on Route 27. Amory Maynard (1804-1890) started a woolen mill on the Assabet River in 1846. In 1871 the village of mill workers and other residents officially became the Town of Maynard. The crypt is an imposing earth-covered mound with a granite facade facing the road. The mound is 90 feet across and about 12 feet tall. The stonework facade is approximately 30 feet across. The ceiling of the crypt has a glass skylight surmounted by an exterior cone of iron grillwork. The granite lintel above the door reads \\"MAYNARD.\\" Chiseled above the lintel are the year 1880 and the Greek letters Alpha and Omega entwined with a Fleur-de- lis Cross. Amory Maynard, his wife, Mary, their third son, Harlan, and nineteen other descendants were interred in the crypt. Oldest son Lorenzo Maynard and his family were buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Second son William was buried at Hope Cemetery, Worcester, Massachusetts, along with his wife and four of their seven children.

At the commencement of the post-Civil War period, the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics cooperated heavily towards the industrialisation of China, which had experienced decades of ceaseless warfare. During this period of Sino-Soviet friendship, Chinese factories, with the assistance of Soviet blue-prints and technical assistance, began mass- producing Soviet-designed weapons such as the Type 50 submachine gun, Type 54 pistol, Type 56 carbine and the Type 56 assault rifle. Two such blue-print given to China from the Soviet Union was the German Walther PPK pistol and the Soviet Makarov PM pistol, which the Chinese manufactured under the designations 'Type 52 pistol' and 'Type 59' pistol, respectively. Following the Sino-Soviet split of the late 1950s to the 1960s, the Soviet Union withdrew its support for the Chinese Communist Party, leaving China to develop its arms industry itself. Beginning in 1960, Chinese engineers began designing a new, indigenous pistol for military officers and police based on the Type 52 and 59 pistols. By 1964 a final design had been developed, and was subsequently named the 'Type 64 pistol' although it would take until 1980, two decades after beginning of its development, to reach production due to Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution which consistently hampered the Type 64s development and production. With its introduction in 1980, the Type 64 became the first indigenously developed firearm created by the People's Liberation Army. With the introduction of newer, more modern pistols, such as the QSZ-92 in the 1990s, the Type 64 has been slowly been phased out of PLA service and is now only used by civilian police forces, who also intend to phase out the Type 64 within the coming years with a new, yet-unnamed 9mm revolver which was introduced in 2006. ;China Astronaut Survival gun China Astronauts have a pistol for survival from Shenzhou 5 in 1999杨利伟当年为何上太空带手枪 这用途99%的人都不知道 新浪军事. Design details The Type 64 pistol is a small, pocket-sized pistol, and was designed specifically for the parallelly developed 7.62×17 mm Type 64, a rimless pistol cartridge which is loosely based on the commonly found .32 ACP pistol round. The Type 64 pistol was the first pistol to use the 7.62×17 mm pistol round. The Type 64 uses the PPKs straight blowback, open bolt, single action while also incorporating the PMs safety system where the operator pushes the safety lever down before firing. After the first round is discharged, the hammer is cocked; firing and cycling recocks the hammer for subsequent firing. The Type 64 is a rather small pistol and issues around the weapon's ergonomics and accuracy during semi-automatic firing had been issues since its inception. Issues over the use of the Type 64 round have also been called into question; some believe the 7.62×17 mm round is too powerful for police work, where the objective is to capture the criminal, while others believe the round is not powerful enough to properly protect police officers. Variants The sole variant of the Type 64 pistol is the M-64 pistol. The 'Type 64 silent pistol' is a similarly named, but unrelated Chinese pistol. =M-64= The M-64 (Model 64) pistol is a variant of the Type 64 pistol.

As the construction is still in progress, the district is not formally recognized as such, and its area is still referred to as being part of Rogoredo and Taliedo. The area where Milano Santa Giulia is being built is a wide former industrial zone, where Montedison and Acciaierie Redaelli facilities used to be. For this reason, the district is also nicknamed Montecity, after Montedison. The leading architect of the Milano Santa Giulia project is Norman Foster (UK), and the developer is Risanamento.\\"Viva! Norman; UK architect Norman Foster is helping create a new town at the heart of Italys capital of style, says David Spittles.\\" Evening Standard (London). March 12, 2008.

The ex-Montedison area (bordering on Taliedo) is intended to become been a luxury residential area, with a prestigious shopping mall (nicknamed \\"Montecity Avenue\\"), congress facilities, and a church designed by Peter Zumthor. The district will accommodate up to 60,000 residents and comprise retail stores as well as leisure areas. Hotels, offices, a conference center, a school, and a church are planned, surrounding a large central green area. Public art in the area has been commissioned to sculptor Anish Kapoor. The district will be connected to Milan by the Paullese as well as the Tangenziale Est ring road. The nearby Rogoredo railway station, and Milan Metro station, will also serve the new district. The development of a tramway from the railway station across the whole district is also part of the plan. Current situation Construction in the ex-Montedison area has experienced both financial and legal problems, and has been suspended. In 2010, the authorities have confiscated the area on the basis that the groundwater is polluted, an issue that is still being debated, with the Milan Metro trustees upholding that the drinking water aquifers are safe.Inquinamento della falda, sequestrata l'area ex Montedison a Santa Giulia (in Italian)Sigilli a Santa Giulia: falde inquinate (in Italian) In the ex- Redaelli area, bordering on the Rogoredo district, residential and office buildings have been constructed, including the headquarters of the Sky Italia satellite television provider.

They were active between 1994–1998, and released two EPs and a 10\\" single. Influences Initially heavily influenced by the likes of Faith No More, Tool and Pearl Jam, Wallflower soon acquired a considerably wider range of more progressive and eclectic influences, including Nick Drake, Robert Fripp, Tortoise, Slint and Tom Waits, and also took influence from many aspects of contemporary art and poetry. The band's later work took a somewhat more experimental turn, with many experiments with song structures, alternative instrumentation (including using AM radios, various percussion instruments, steel pans, and more usage of effects processing) and live improvisation. Members * Andrew Cannon - vocals, percussion, keyboards * James Hounsell - guitar * Russell Wark - bass guitar * Jon Steele - drums and percussion The band was originally formed in 1992 under the name Jesus Freaksign. After multiple lineup changes, the band consolidated their lineup and changed their name to Wallflower in 1995. Live performances The band became regulars as such London venues as the Hope & Anchor in Islington, The Dublin Castle in Camden, The King's Head in Fulham and The Orange in West Kensington, as well as playing shows further afield, including support slots with Imogen Heap, Breed 77 and The Crazy Gods Of Endless Noise. The band also played at the Marxism '96 event at the University College London ULU. Their live show was notable for the inclusion of much live improvisation, performance art and occasional use of projections. Recordings The band recorded the \\"Spooning Music\\" demo in 1994 (tracks included \\"Blackbird\\", \\"Cover Girl\\" and \\"Grace\\"), and followed it up with the \\"Uncovered\\" EP in 1995 (featuring the tracks \\"Underlay\\", \\"Yield\\", \\"She Steers, She Guides Us\\" and \\"The Way She Moves\\"). This EP was widely distributed among London's underground rock scene, and brought the band considerable recognition, including a review in the NME. \\"Airmailed\\" EP In 1997, the band recorded the \\"Airmailed\\" EP - this was released on 10\\" vinyl through the band's own Room Four Music imprint.

Most banknotes have traces of cocaine on them; this has been confirmed by studies done in several countries. In 1994, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals determined that in Los Angeles, out of every four banknotes, on average more than three are tainted by cocaine or another illicit drug. Additionally, paper money in other parts of the world show a similar drug contamination, and studies indicate that they might even serve as a vector of disease, though researchers disagree over how easily diseases are transmitted this way. Part of the US$207 million seized from alleged drug trafficker Zhenli Ye Gon. Several theories have been suggested to explain this contamination beyond the predictable contamination due to handling during drug deals and the use of rolled up notes for snorting drugs. After the initial contamination, the substance is \\"infected to\\" other notes in close contact, often stacked together, in enclosed environments common in financial institutions. In the United States In a study reported in Forensic Science International, A.J. Jenkins, at the Office of the Cuyahoga County Coroner (Cleveland, OH), the author reports the analysis of ten randomly collected one-dollar bills from five cities, and tested for cocaine, heroin, 6-acetylmorphine (also called \\"6-AM\\"), morphine, codeine, methamphetamine, amphetamine and phencyclidine (PCP). Bills were then immersed in acetonitrile for two hours prior to extraction and subjected to Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Results demonstrated that \\"92% of the bills were positive for cocaine with a mean amount of 28.75 ± 139.07 micrograms per bill, a median of 1.37 μg per bill, and a range of 0.01-922.72 μg per bill. Heroin was detected in seven bills in amounts ranging from 0.03 to 168.5 μg per bill: 6-AM and morphine were detected in three bills; methamphetamine and amphetamine in three and one bills, respectively, and PCP was detected in two bills in amounts of 0.78 and 1.87 μg per bill. Codeine was not detected in any of the one-dollar bills analyzed\\". The study confirmed that although paper currency was most often contaminated with cocaine, other drugs of abuse may also be detected in bills. Another study, conducted at Argonne National Laboratory, found that four out of five dollar bills in Chicago suburbs contain traces of cocaine. Previous studies have found similar contamination rates in other cities. But the Argonne study is the first to demonstrate that if you handle contaminated bills, you won't wind up with drugs on your hands. \\"It's virtually impossible for cocaine to rub off\\", Argonne chemist Jack Demirgian said. This estimate of contamination could be as high as 94%, according to Bill and Rich Sones of the Chicago Sun-Times. This was confirmed by Ronald K. Siegel in his book, Intoxication: Life in Pursuit of Artificial Paradise, who noted the figure as well. Another study by the Journal of Analytical Toxicology is more conservative, noting a still substantial contamination of 80% of US currency by cocaine. It was uncovered in the Sacramento Bee that while the initial source of the contamination comes from money used in the Illegal drug trade in circulation, the U.S. Federal Reserve unwittingly spreads the substance to clean currency by mixing the notes together. The Journal of Analytical Toxicology confirms this assessment, noting that counting machines (in addition to simple proximity) are the agents of transfer. The discovery that cocaine is so prevalent in U.S. banknotes has a legal application that reactions by drug-sniffing dogs is not immediately cause for arrest of persons or confiscation of banknotes. (The drug content is too low for prosecution but not too low to trigger response to drug-sniffing dogs.), though this has been contested legally in a number of U.S. states as a standard of what constitutes 'unusual' levels of contamination remains to be achieved (see below). In addition to traces of illicit drugs, a recent study of currency within New York City have shown that various contagious microbes from skin and oral commensals are also transferred onto paper bank notes, including Cutibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus. Other microbes detected not associated with humans included Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus, microbes typically associated with dairy production and fermentation. The study went on to prove that viable microbes could be isolated and cultured from paper currency. An earlier study conducted in western Ohio, in which \\"One-dollar bills were collected from the general community in western Ohio to survey for bacterial contamination. Pathogenic or potentially pathogenic organisms were isolated from 94% of the bills. These results suggest a high rate of bacterial contamination of one-dollar bills.\\" In the United Kingdom Forensic scientists have said that around 80% of all British banknotes contain traces of drugs. A 1999 study found even higher levels of contamination in the London area; of 500 notes tested, only four had no traces of cocaine. Most of the banknotes showed only low levels of contamination, suggesting they had merely been in contact with contaminated notes, but 4% of the notes in the study showed higher levels, which the researchers suggested was the result of either being handled by people under the influence of cocaine (which is excreted in skin oils), or by being used directly to snort the drug. There are drug levels above which banknotes need to be taken out of circulation, and over £15 million worth of notes are destroyed annually for this reason. The destruction is more often done as a precaution than because the money poses a serious health hazard. Cocaine is the drug most commonly found on banknotes. Heroin and ecstasy are found less often, though the frequency of ecstasy contamination rose in the years leading up to 2002. Joe Reevy of Mass Spec Analytical, a company which analyses confiscated banknotes for the police, pointed out that heroin and ecstasy degrade more rapidly than cocaine, and that a single note which had been used to snort cocaine could subsequently contaminate many others when placed in a sorting machine, to explain the frequency of cocaine contamination. Money recovered from police raids on the drugs trade are often heavily contaminated. In one raid in 2002, £465,000 was found which had been stored in a room where heroin was being prepared, and was so heavily contaminated that officers were advised not to touch it without protective equipment. Prior studies found that the level of contamination - i.e., the concentration of the contaminants - was different between those notes suspected to be used in the drug trade and those of proximity transfer levels. Subsequent tests have confirmed this determination, and serve as the basis for court cases against drug dealers, since the basic level of drug contamination remains fairly constant throughout the UK, despite factors that might immediately be thought to affect levels, like rural or urban environments, rich or poor or areas with high or low crime rates. =Hepatitis-C contamination= The contamination of paper money is not limited to simply that of cocaine and other illicit drugs. Health officials in the UK warn that a silent Hepatitis-C epidemic could be brewing. Drug users with hepatitis who share with others the rolled paper note (or straw) used to snort cocaine can facilitate the transfer of the disease to thousands. As drug users are frequently impaired, they can easily fail to notice small traces of blood on these rolled banknotes. This is considered to be of particular concern, as eight out of ten carriers are unaware of their status (as hepatitis can lie dormant for decades), and have little in the way of access to regular healthcare . This higher risk for contracting hepatitis-C has also been noted by the American National Institutes of Health (NIH). Without treatment, hepatitis-C can lead to chronic liver disease. The British Department of Health estimates that there are over 200,000 people infected with hepatitis C in Britain, but the number might be much higher. Charles Gore, the chief executive of the Hepatitis C Trust, said: \\"Estimates show that around 5,000 new cases of hepatitis C are diagnosed every year - but they are mainly through chance. Because so many are undiagnosed we can't tell what kind of problem we are looking at. When 5,000 banknotes were tested in London in 2000, 99% of them had traces of cocaine on them. That tells us that there is potentially a massive problem in diagnosis and people's awareness of how easily hepatitis C can be contracted.\\" Professor Graham Foster, of St Mary's Hospital, London, said: \\"Sharing banknotes or straws is a significant risk factor that people need to be more aware of. Although the risk of contracting hepatitis C through snorting is lower than through sharing a needle, it is still there.\\" Eurozone Similar contaminations have been found on euro banknotes from Ireland, Spain, and Germany with the cocaine concentration being almost 100 times higher on the Spanish banknotes than on the German. Additionally, Germany had noted the unusual occurrences of German euros cracking and disintegrating after being withdrawn from ATMs, later explained as being caused by the sulfates used in the production of methamphetamine mixing with human sweat to form sulfuric acid, which breaks down the paper the euros are printed on. Most of the crystal methamphetamine present in Germany comes from Eastern Europe, and has a high level of sulfates. Elsewhere in the world The longevity of most modern currency has also given rise to various fallacies regarding the transmission of bacteriological agents with paper banknotes. In early 2003, China placed banknotes under quarantine amid fears that SARS could be spread by the notes. Notes were held for 24 hours—the presumed lifespan of the virus. No evidence indicates that banknotes were an infection vector in the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak. Contamination of bills is one factor that influenced Australia to introduce polymer banknotes for general circulation in 1992. Australia now also prints polymer currency for almost two dozen other countries, including Israel, Malaysia, Mexico and Romania.

In 1995, Rinearson co-founded a nine-person digital design company, Raster Ranch, that focused on 3D modeling for television, games, and the Web.History of Alki Software. Two years later, Rinearson spun off from Alki a subsidiary, Intype, which created Babynamer.com, which had 300,000 monthly visitors.Editor & Publisher column by Steve Outing, May 4, 1998. But the primary initiative of Intype was to build and market a Web-publishing platform that would enable a web site to offer a blend of professional and community created content. (This was before the word \\"blog\\" existed.) Rinearson believed that the economic principle called network effects would catapult to dominance publishers who owned the primary places where people congregated online to create and consume their own content. Intype was an attempt to get the newspaper industry, where Rinearson had started his career, to embrace community content before Web startups gained a strong foothold. The Newspaper Association of America used Intype's technology,\\"Self-publishing tools will open doors for community groups,\\" a report by Marion J. Love of \\"The Cole Papers,\\" Sept. 1998. but when no newspapers followed suit Rinearson sold Intype to Oxygen Media in 1999. Executive With the sale of his company, Rinearson became a senior vice-president at the Oxygen television network, where he led software development and program management teams in New York, San Francisco, and Seattle. He moved from Oxygen to Microsoft, where as a corporate vice president he was on the five-person senior leadership team of the Information Worker business unit, which published Microsoft Office and other productivity software. His teams developed Office-based software solutions for industry partners, and incubated potential products (including the forerunner of desktop search). Rinearson supervised Microsoft's corporate intranet, libraries, archive, and Center for Information Work. He also had certain marketing responsibilities. After Microsoft, Rinearson returned to his entrepreneurial roots, where he undertook projects that converged into Intersect.com, a service he founded that launched in December, 2010 and closed in 2013.Biographies of members of the Intersect team, including that of CEO Peter Rinearson.

This was a year before Facebook introduced its timelines, and when Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook's forthcoming feature in 2011, Rinearson downplayed its importance. “As best we can tell, Facebook offers you only one timeline, it doesn’t appear to let you borrow content from other people, it doesn’t have Intersect’s interesting and entertaining ways of exploring time and place, and it doesn’t let you discover lives and stories that intersect with yours,” he said.https://www.geekwire.com/2011/intersect- ceo-facebook-timeline-falls-short/) Facebook timeline falls short, Geekwire. Intersect was a success technologically but, despite Rinearson's initial confidence, could not gain traction against Facebook.

By 2018, Rinearson was a member of the advisory board of Athira Pharma, a Seattle company developing a potential therapy for chronic, progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The drug was in clinical trials in the United States and France.

Crandall gave his name to several typewriters, and he was also involved in the development of various machines, such as the project to produce the Hammond design at the Remington factory, or later the International typewriter. Early life Born in Portlerane, Broome County, New York, Crandall was a descendant on his mother's side of Joseph Warren. He served as a private for three years during the American Civil War, surviving twelve major battles without injury. Career In 1873, Crandall was employed as a salesman by James Densmore and George W. Yost of New York. Densmore and Yost had licensed Christopher Sholes and Carlos Glidden's patents and had established a contract with E. Remington and Sons to manufacture them. They gave Crandall the necessary tools and set him to work to perfect the typewriter. Crandall soon worked out an oscillating typebar which he obtained a patent for; this prints capital and lowercase characters by shifting the platen, and was later used in Remington typewriters. Crandall assigned half of his patent to Densmore and Yost. After leaving the company and inventing his own typewriter, he started negotiations with E. Remington and Sons for the sale of the other half of his patent. Densmore learned of this, and wrote a letter to Remington denouncing Crandall as a \\"liar, scoundrel, a dishonest and immoral man\\". Crandall then brought an action against Densmore for defamation of character, claiming $100,000 in damages, saying that the letter had caused his negotiations with Remington to fail. Densmore's defense was that the charges made in his letter were all true. In 1875, Crandall received a patent for a typewriter for blind users and in 1879 was granted a patent for a downstrike typesleeve machine, much like the one that he introduced in 1884 and set up the Crandall Typewriting Company. Typewriters Crandall New Model typewriter, 1880s, USA =The Crandall Typewriter= The Crandall Typewriter was patented in 1881 and manufactured by the Crandall Machine Company of Groton, New York. The Crandall used a type sleeve, as opposed to typebars, inked by a ribbon. It also used a non standard two-row keyboard. It has been called \\"the first American visible and practically useful typewriter.\\" The type sleeve, which could easily be swapped out, had six rows of characters and was mounted obliquely on the first model. A key press rotated it and moved it along its axis to select the corresponding letter, bringing it down to the platen and locking it by temporarily engaging a pin in a hole. The typist shifted to capitals with the \\"CAPS\\" key, which raised the type cylinder by two rows; the \\"F&P;\\" key raised the cylinder by four rows, and was used for typing figures and punctuation. The lever between these two keys served as a shift lock; by pushing it backwards, one could type in capitals only. One special feature was that the period and comma each had their own key, and can always be typed regardless of the shift. =New Model= A reworked machine named the New Model appeared in 1885. It was produced in Groton from 1887, and sold in Europe from 1886 onwards by an agent in Amsterdam. The most significant changes from the previous machine were the slightly curved, two-row keyboard with 28 keys, and the vertical type cylinder which had 6 rows of 14 characters. Later examples of this model were ornately decorated with inlaid mother of pearl, painted roses and gold scrollwork, one of the most extravagantly decorated typewriters ever manufactured. Collectors often call the New Model Crandall the most beautiful of all typewriters. This reputation is fully justified by the somewhat overdone yet elegant effect of the painted flowers with inlaid mother-of-pearl above the keyboard, the filigreed golden pinstripes, and the flower motifs that are found even on the back of the frame.Kerschbaumer =Universal Crandall No. 3= This model was first marketed in 1893, and was built on the same principles as the New Model. It added a straight three-row QWERTY keyboard, and as Model No. 4 it also offered a two-color ribbon. The elaborate decorations had by now given way to a comparatively sober design. =Improved Crandall= The Improved Crandall of 1895 was completely different from the previous machines, and it is debatable whether it ever entered production.

History 144 Squadron was formed in 1979 as one of the RSAF's fighter squadrons operating in the interceptor role, catapulting the RSAF into the supersonic era upon delivery of the original F-5E/F Tiger. The squadron initially operated the supersonic F-5E/F Tiger II fighter aircraft, but has been operating the locally modified & improved F-5S/T Tiger-IIs fighter aircraft since the early 1990s, these were retrofitted with new state-of-the-art avionics giving the aircraft capability of carrying out both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. 144 Squadron has since been disbanded after the retirement of the F-5S/T Tiger-IIs in September 2015. Achievements The squadron clinched the coveted Best Fighter Squadron award (Singapore Armed Forces Best Unit Competition) in 1995, 2005, 2009, and 2015. It first won the title in 1995. It is regarded by many as the best fighter squadron in the RSAF, having dominated many local and international exercises. Operating the oldest fighter platform in the RSAF ORBAT requires superior skills, capability and professionalism, thus the squadron handpicks the top pilot graduates to join the team. Mascot The Blackite is 144 Squadron's adopted mascot. The Squadron's “Dare to Excel” motto amplifies the Blackite character; a mysterious bird that is unpredictable and deadly, but strikes her prey with precision and readiness at all times.

He was captured by Algerian pirates and sold into slavery. By successfully working as a slave servant to the Bey of Constantine, he eventually obtained his freedom from captivity. Life Hark Olufs was born as son of a nautical captain named Oluf Jensen on either July 17 or 19 in 1708 on the North Frisian island of Amrum, which then belonged to Denmark. In 1721 he became a seaman on the Hoffnung, a ship belonging to his father. In 1724, on a voyage from Nantes to Hamburg, Olufs’ ship was seized by Algerian pirates and he, and his two cousins, were taken hostage. Olufs' family could not afford the high price which was demanded in ransom by the Barbary slave traders for his release. Because the ship had been sailing under Hamburg colours, the family's request for a loan from the slavery fund of the Danish Kingdom was rejected. Subsequently, Olufs was sold as a slave on Algiers' slave market. From 1724 to 1727/28 he was a slave servant of the Bey of Constantine and advanced in responsibility to become the Bey's treasurer. Between 1728 and 1732 he was made Commander of the Life Guards. In 1732 he became Agha ed-Deira, Commander in Chief of the local cavalry. In 1735, he took part in the conquest of Tunis by the Algerian army during the disposal of Al-Husayn I ibn Ali. As a reward, Olufs was released on October 31 and was allowed to return to Amrum. In 1747 he published an autobiography in Danish, which was translated into German in 1751. Hark Olufs died on October 13, 1754, in Süddorf on Amrum.

The Superintendent of State Prisons had control over the hospital. Early history In 1886, a New York State legislative commission recommended the purchase of the Dates Farm in the village of Matteawan for $25,000. The site was rural, yet accessible by rail and offered good tillable land, pure water and pleasant scenery between the Hudson River and the Fishkill Mountains. Architect Isaac Perry, known for finishing work on the New York State Capitol, was hired to design the main hospital building with \\"an abundance of light and ventilation\\" to accommodate 550 patients.Yasinac, Rob. \\"Matteawan State Hospital\\" at Hudson Valley Ruins In April 1892, the Asylum for Insane Criminals, with 261 patients, was relocated from Auburn to its new site.

Dannemora would hold male convicts who became insane while serving their sentences, and had the power to retain them if they remained insane at expiration of their sentences. Matteawan would hold unconvicted males as well as females in both categories. Except for tighter security, Matteawan functioned the same as the state's civil hospitals. Doctors prescribed a program of \\"moral treatment\\" developed in the early 1800s. It consisted of kind and gentle treatment in a stress-free, highly routine environment. Patients who were capable were assigned to a work program: cooking, maintenance, and making baskets, rugs, clothing and bedsheets. Like all institutions of its time, Matteawan included extensive acreage for farming to feed its residents. Up to were devoted to vegetable and fruit cultivation, a dairy farm, a piggery and pasture land for the animals. Barns and other farm buildings were built down the hill from the asylum. These included a tool shed built in 1900, a greenhouse (1919), a large residence hall for male patients and staff assigned to work the farm (1932) and a horse stable (1933).\\"Beacon Correctional Facility\\" at Prison Talk, October 16, 2004 =First U.S. female officer killed= In 1906 head attendant Nellie Wicks was killed when she was stabbed by inmate Lizzie Halliday who had been placed there after committing several murders and arsons.

By 1949 the facility, originally built for 550, housed almost 1,500 men and 250 women. =Closing of farm= The Matteawan \\"colony farm\\" was closed in the mid-1960s when the director decided that farming was not relevant training for a patient population drawn principally from New York City.

The park protects more than of rugged terrain boasting deep canyons, rivers, waterfalls, and scenic mountain peaks, including the Cerro de la Silla (\\"Saddle Mountain\\"), part of Monterrey's famous skyline. The park was created in 1939 under president Lázaro Cárdenas to protect the native flora and fauna against the spreading urbanization of the city of Monterrey. The cool pine-oak forests with winding trails through the mountains make this park a popular escape from the nearby metropolis. History There are numerous indigenous paintings and stone carvings throughout the park that have proven humans have inhabited the area for thousands of years. Before the Spanish colonial period, different groups of Chichimeca inhabited the present area of Cumbres de Monterrey. Many of the different tribes in the region united for years in efforts to avoid Spanish rule. Monterrey became the first European settlement in the area when it was founded on September 20, 1596. Cumbres de Monterrey National Park was established on November 24, 1939, by president Lázaro Cárdenas. The park was decreed to encompass , which at the time was the largest area to be declared protected by the Mexican government as a national park. By decree on November 17, 2000, Cumbres de Monterrey National Park was reduced to an area of . Geography Karstification is a powerful force that has created caves and spectacular rock formations throughout the park The most accessible portion of Cumbres de Monterrey is Chipinque on the edge of Monterrey, about from downtown. At the visitor's center, park officials provide information and maps of several hiking paths varying from easy to moderately difficult. Chipinque is an ecological reserve within the park that allow visitors easy access to much of the flora and fauna found in the park. The park is located in the northern portion of the Sierra Madre Oriental, which was formed by rock folding of marine based sedimentary strata during the Eocene epoch in the Laramide orogeny period. The marine sedimentary rock rose over the years to an elevation of above sea level. The highest peaks in the park include: * Pinar: above sea level * Cerro de la Silla: above sea level * La Ventana: above sea level * La Antenna: above sea level * M Este: above sea level * Copete de las Águilas: above sea level The main sedimentary rock that constitutes the mountains in the park was formed during the Cretaceous period. Most of the sedimentary rock features extensive karstification that happened over millions of years, creating several underground systems such as subterranean rivers, caves, and aquifers. Grutas de García (García Caves) is one of the largest cave system in Mexico and one of the most popular attractions within the park. García Caves were hidden for millions of years until being discovered in 1843. Marine fossils have been discovered inside these caves because the lining of the caves mainly consists of oceanic sedimentary rock. The porous sedimentary rock in the park allows water to filter into subterranean rivers that replenish underground aquifers, which provide one of the primary sources of water for the city of Monterrey. Pozo del Gavilán (Eagle's Hole), the only cenote known in northern Mexico is located in the southern tip of the park; it is another prime example of karstification. Pozo del Gavilán is a popular site to rappel and is subterraneously connected to Laguna de Labradores (Labradores Lake). Cascada Cola de Caballo Cañón de la Huasteca, the most famous of the many canyons found in Cumbres de Monterrey, accounts for about of the park. The walls of Cañón de la Huasteca are marked with a significant number of prehistoric glyphs created thousands of years ago by the ancient inhabitants of the region. Another popular canyon is Matacanes Canyon where there are several waterfalls, of which Cascada de Chipitín (Chipitín Falls) is the most famous. Throughout the park there are numerous waterfalls, and there may be more to be found because there is an extensive cave system with large amounts of water not drained by surface streams and rivers but rather by subterranean ones. The two most famous waterfalls are Cascada Cola de Caballo (Horsetail Falls) and Cascada de Chipitín. Easily accessible by a trail, Horsetail Falls is one of the highlights of the park with a spectacular drop; the water pours over large rounded boulders in a way that resembles a horse's tail. Chipitín Falls is not easily accessible and requires a difficult hike, some rappelling, and swimming; the waterfall has an impressive drop. In addition to the many surface streams and rivers there are many ponds and small lakes. The best known lake is Laguna de Labradores. Climate The climate throughout the park changes drastically depending on the elevation and the location of the terrain. According to the Köppen climate classification there are several climates within the park. The following climates are listed by elevation in the park. Elevation : North tip of the park has a (BWh) desert climate with an average annual temperature of and an annual precipitation of . The southeast corner and central east portion of the park has a (Awh) Tropical Savanna climate with mild winters, summer-autumn monsoon, annual precipitation of , and an average annual temperature of . Elevation : North tip and the southwest corner of the park has a (BSk) Steppe Climate with an average annual temperature . Central portion of the park has a (Cwa) Humid Subtropical climate with an average annual temperature of and an annual precipitation of . Elevation : Western side of the park has a (Cwb) Oceanic climate with an average annual temperature of and an annual precipitation of . Flora and fauna Smooth-bark Mexican pine (Pinus pseudostrobus) The Cumbres de Monterrey National Park is home to a great variety of ecosystems due to the geography of the park where there are many microclimates allowing a greater variety of flora and fauna to flourish. Agave, Dasylirion, and Rhus species are found in many areas of the park. The forest is made up mainly of the following tree species: * Spruce: Picea martinezii, Picea engelmannii * Yucca: Yucca carnerosana, Yucca filifera * Douglas fir: Pseudotsuga lindleyana, Pseudotsuga flahualti * Fir: Abies vejarii, Abies hickelii, Abies hidalgensis, Abies durangensis * Oak: Quercus fusiformis, Quercus greggii, Quercus hipoxlanta, Quercus laeta, Quercus saltillensis * Pine: Pinus ayacahuite, Pinus cembroides, Pinus greggii, Pinus hartwegii, Pinus pinceana, Pinus pseudostrobus, Pinus rudis, Pinus teocote'' The pine and oak forests and steppe are home to many animals. The park has one of the most diverse ecosystems in the northern part of Mexico. There is a large variety of fish that can be found in the park, but most species are endangered. Among the fish species present in the park are Astyanax mexicanus, Campostoma anomalum, Cichlasoma cyanoguttatum, Cyprinella lutrensis, Etheostoma grahami, Gambusia affinis, Macrhybopsis aestivalis, Notropis amabilis, Notropis braytoni, Notropis stramineus, Poecilia mexicana, Puntius conchonius, and Xiphophorus couchianus. Even though there are many species of fish, the following are the only known endemic species: Cyprinella rutila, Dionda melanops and Moxostoma albidum. A significant number of Cyprinodon species still exists but many are endangered or have gone extinct. The park hosts a large variety of bird species, including Accipiter striatus, Aquila chrysaetos, Circus cyaneus, Falco columbarius, Falco mexicanus, Falco peregrinus, Rhynchopsitta terrisi, Speotyto cunicularia, and Spizella wortheni. The park's mammals include Puma concolor, Ursus americanus, Canis latrans, and Odocoileus virginianus.

Situated on the Danube and the border with Serbia, part of the mountainous area known as Clisura Dunării, Coronini holds several archeological sites, which trace its history back to the Bronze Age. The locality is home to a medieval fortress built by rulers of the Hungarian Kingdom, but was re-founded during the Banat colonization of the 1790s, and officially in 1858. A center for immigration from the Czech lands in the early 19th century, Sfânta Elena is among the traditional places founded by and associated with the Czech-Romanian community. Coronini as a whole was transformed by 20th century political changes, industrialization and economic fluctuations: Coronini village became a center for the mining industry, while Sfânta Elena was heavily affected rural-urban migration, and eventually by voluntary resettlement in the Czech Republic. During the 1990s, the commune became ill-famed as a hub for contraband in petroleum products. Location and demographics The Coronini commune is located on the foothills of the Southern Carpathians, where these meet the Danube, and in proximity to the Clisura Dunării and Iron Gates areas. Facing Serbia on the right bank of the Danube, it is also close to a canyon formed by the Alibeg River.Pătroescu & Rozyłowicz, p. 110 The Sfânta Elena area is located on a karstic plateau, which groups sinkholes and limestone pavements, features also present in neighboring areas (Berzasca, the Mudavița Seacă Valley, etc.).

Coronini was also the site of Halstatt funerals, probably related to those found on Moldova Veche sites. The Roman period itself is attested by a denarius issued under Emperor Alexander Severus, under whose reign a Roman road was begun.Moisi, p. 9 In the 9th century, what is now Coronini may have been included in the lordship of Ajtony.Cerović, p. 5 The medieval period, when Banat was part of the Kingdom of Hungary, left several traces on Coronini's landscape. The location houses the 15th century Saint Ladislaus (Hungarian: Szentlászló; historical Hungarian: Zenthlázlówára) fortress, part of the historical sites in the Iron Gates Natural Park area.Pál Engel, The Realm of St. Stephen: A History of Medieval Hungary, 895–1526, pp. 237–238. London: I.B. Tauris, 2005. Archeological investigation carried out in 1970–1973 found that it was built on top of Dacian fortifications and newer walls erected in the 6th or 7th centuries, and that the Hungarian building was probably erected in the 15th century. The decision to construct Saint Ladislaus is thought to have come directly from King Sigismund, whereas other Banat fortresses from the period were inaugurated by his vassal Pipo of Ozora. The ramparts were first used in 1396 by Sigismund and Stephen Rozgonyi to block the Ottoman advance following defeat at Nicopolis.Mih. Drăghicescu, Istoricul principalelor puncte pe Dunăre dela Gura Tisei până la mare și pe coastele mării dela Varna la Odesa, p. 65. Monitorul Oficial, Bucharest, 1943 The loss of Golubac, over the river, probably contributed to the urgency of building Saint Ladislaus, used as a base during the 1428 attacks.Grivu, pp. 207–208 The medieval period also produced new cave paintings and traces of habitation in the caves, some of which are superimposed over their Basarabi culture predecessors. Also then, the village came to house a quarry. A cemetery, attesting a larger Hungarian habitation, was accidentally discovered in central Coronini in 1896.Moisi, pp. 7–8 The fortress, which became known as Lászlóvára, was destroyed by the string of Ottoman–Habsburg wars. At various intervals during the campaigns, Ottomans controlled the whole region as Temeşvar Eyalet. Coronini is the presumed site of Saint Michael Monastery, linked to Wallachian Orthodoxy and attested in Ottoman documents during the rule of Murad III (later ransacked). Săpături arheologice la Coronini, Radio România Regional release, July 3, 2013 Turks left their mark in place-names: the cliffs of Babacaia were reportedly the site of an honor killing by an agha, and named after the victim; Alibeg River is named after a Şehzade.Moisi, pp. 3, 5 The area was eventually secured for the Habsburg domains under the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718), and then transmitted to the Austrian Empire. It became the newest of Banat's ethnic Romanian colonies.Moisi, pp. 4, 7 Its population of woodcutters and agriculturists had originated in Oltenia, having first settled in the Banat in the 1640s. Newer waves arrived in 1716–1739, when Austria had direct control over Oltenia. Immigrant patriarchs included fugitives from the law, such as Ion Bălean, who had killed an Ottoman tax collector in the 1780s. They had first settled Moldova Nouă, where they were known as bufeni, possibly from bufă (\\"owl\\"): their indentured labor, servicing the Military Frontier, sometimes required them to work at night, but spared them from conscription.Moisi, pp. 4–5 Reestablishment In 1798, a branch of the bufeni moved to the Alibeg area, having been contracted by the forestry tycoon Ion Margelia (or János Magyarly) of Oravița.Moisi, pp. 5–6 In 1832, Alibeg was formally designated a part of the Military Frontier, and its borders were drawn up.Moisi, pp. 6–7 In 1858, Johann Baptist Coronini- Cronberg, Governor of Banat, ordered the entire village to relocate on the Danube shore, and, from 1859, it became known as Koronini or Coronini, in his honor. According to oral history, the bufeni resented recolonization, as it striped them of good arable land (which was then assigned to an Austrian officer), and because it was done without proper arrangements. They were also ordered to invest in stone houses, renouncing their cheaper bordeie. During the following decades, the village was modernized, with road paving, river engineering and new works on the fortifications, and the introduction of gas lighting; however, its population was plagued by modern infections—syphilis and tuberculosis were brought in by visitors and foreign workers.Moisi, pp. 8–9 Assigned to the Hungarian component of Austria-Hungary in 1867, by 1900 Coronini was also included in Krassó-Szörény County. That year, it had 901 inhabitants, of whom 872 were ethnic Romanians.Negru, p. 37 Late in World War I, and following the Aster Revolution, the village experienced administrative confusion: in November 1918, two Romanian women, Anușca Băloi and Drăgălina Țundrea, organized the populace and chased out the Hungarian Gendarmes. Koronini subsequently fell into the area of Banat disputed between the Kingdom of Romania, Yugoslavia, and, nominally, the Banat Republic. Claimed during the Romanian union process of 1918–1919, it was instead part of an area of occupation by the Royal Yugoslav Army, extending eastward to Orșova, then included in a buffer zone occupied by the French Danube Army.Suciu, pp. 1101–1104.

Arheologie—Istorie, Vol. XIX, 2011, pp. 449–456; Cerović, p. 156 For a few weeks, the area was included in \\"Lugoj County\\", set up and managed by the 11th Colonial Infantry Division.Suciu, p. 1103 On August 6, 1919, the last Yugoslav troops withdrew and Coronini was taken by the Romanian Army—then recognized, under the 1920 Treaty of Trianon, as being part of Greater Romania. In 1922, it was visited by the deposed Hungarian King Charles IV, and, the following year, by the King of Romania, Ferdinand I. By 1924, the Romanian land reform had resulted in a controversial liquidation of the Military Frontier garrison assets, with debates opposing landless peasants to Grenz infantry veterans; most available land was also divided into individual plots, but proved highly unsuitable for cultivation.Moisi, p. 8 In 1934, at least 9 inhabitants left as colonists to Caliacra County. Known primarily as Coronini, the village was included in Caraș County and Moldova Nouă plasă. By the time of World War II, it had 969 inhabitants.Negru, pp. 35–36 Modernization continued in the 1930s, when some work was performed on the road connecting Orșova to Socol. It was designed as part of the a thoroughfare linking Bucharest to Belgrade. During the late stages of World War II, Clisura area saw activity by Yugoslav Partisans and was briefly governed by a council, led by Triša Kojičić.Cerović, pp. 162–163 It was subsequently restored to Romania. Re-designated as Pescari in 1968, Lege nr.35 din 18 mai 1996 pentru modificarea Legii nr.2/1968 privind organizarea administrativa a teritoriului României, at the Romanian Chamber of Deputies site; archived September 23, 2015 Coronini came to rely on the copper industry throughout the communist period, a factor which prevented its population from migrating into Timișoara and other towns.Rieser, pp. 168–169, 251 It was, with Moldova Nouă, one of two only spots in Clisura Dunării area not to register a significant loss in population.Rieser, p. 168–169, 251–252 Following the 1989 Revolution and the onset of Romania's transition, Pescari became the center of public attention during the 1990s embargo imposed by the United Nations on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (see Yugoslav Wars). Profiting from this situation, it became a main hub for a clandestine Romanian traffic with oil products, which were transported over the border and into present-day Serbia. Mălin Bot, \\"Monstrul din Dunăre\\" , in Adevărul, September 27, 2008David Turnock, Aspects of Independent Romania's Economic History with Particular Reference to Transition for EU Accession, p. 77. Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing, 2007. Allegedly, the Pescari villagers made regular nightly trips with such items, meeting their Serb counterparts on the middle course of the Danube. After the end of the conflict, the population came to rely on subsistence agriculture, ecotourism and fishing for income. The commune, renamed back to Coronini in May 1996, again made the news in 2008, when a German tourist to Coronini captured a giant catfish, weighing in at almost 100 kilograms. =Sfânta Elena= Panorama of Sfânta Elena The village of Sfânta Elena (\\"Saint Helen\\"; ; ) was founded by Czech settlers in 1824, during the Imperial Austrian rule over the region (see Czechs of Romania). It is the oldest Czech settlement in the region, and the only such locality in Romania to hold both a Lutheran and a Roman Catholic church side by side.Nicolae Dolângă, \\"The Land of Nera\\", in Plural Magazine, Nr. 27/2006 Like the bufeni, the first Czechs (known locally as Poemi) to settle southern Banat were invited there by Margelia.Moisi, p. 5 Svatá Helena - Z historie, at the Sfânta Elena official site; retrieved August 20, 2009 Their decision to leave Bohemia was motivated by the poverty the region faced upon the end of the Napoleonic Wars. First arrivals came from towns in and around the Bohemian Forest (Plzeň, Klatovy, Domažlice), followed later by families from Beroun, Čáslav, Chrudim, Hořovice or Příbram. The original village they founded was named Svatá Alžběta (\\"Saint Elisabeth\\") and located some 2 kilometers away from the present-day locality; founded in 1823, it was disestablished in 1847 for lack of water. Both villages had been named after Margelia's two daughters, marking the Czech community's good relationship with its employer, but, in 1827, the latter abruptly ended the business venture, and left with all the tools used in forestry. Although the village was incorporated in 1832, alongside Alibeg,Moisi, p. 6 Margelia's departure left Sfânta Elena's inhabitants faced with a dire situation: some took their families back into the Czech lands, others joined the Grenz. Others still worked on road projects, some as far afield as Serbia. With time, the local Czech group became religiously distinct from other communities: more than half of the population discarded Lutheranism in favor of Baptist denominations (see Baptist Union of Romania).Ian Willoughby, \\"The Czech Ethnic Minority in Romania\\", Radio Prague release, December 29, 2004 This was allegedly a reaction against the ethnic Hungarian Lutheran clergy, perceived as enforcers of Magyarization policies, with the churchgoers opting instead for a Slovak Baptist preacher. Known by 1900 as Szent-Helena, and by 1910 as Dunaszentilona, the village was assigned to Krassó-Szörény County.Negru, pp. 37, 38 It and the rest of Banat were united with Romania upon the end of World War I, after going through the same stages of Yugoslav and French occupation as Coronini. Between 1830 and 1930, the population had increased from 338 to 916 people. In 1924, a textile factory was set up by a Czech businessman, and it employed most of the female Czech workforce before closing down in 1938. By the time of World War II, Sfânta Elena, still administrated separately, was slightly more populated than Coronini, and ranked as the 11th-largest locality in Moldova Nouă plasă. Agriculture declined under the communist regime, when most men were employed in industrial fields (primarily at the mines opened near Moldova Nouă). After the December Revolution toppled Romanian communism (and the Velvet Revolution emancipated Czechoslovakia), many inhabitants of the village left Romania and settled in what became the Czech Republic—with population numbers dropping back to 350 persons. A new Czech-language school was opened in 1998, but attendance had fallen from 150 to 70 pupils in the space of 6 years. The mines employing Sfânta Elena's population were closed down in 2004, as part of Romania's economic transition. After that date, the village continued to face economical and social problems, including lack of plumbing and sewage facilities.

His total area is 64 ha having as neighbors Teregova to the north, Rusca to the northwest, Cornereva to the east, Cornea to the south, Mehadica to the southwest and Luncavița to the west. The distance between Domașnea and the county administrative center, Reșița, is 90 km. The other important cities are Caransebeș at 45 km and Băile Herculane at 25 km. Domașnea name comes from the Latin word \\"domus\\", plus the Latin suffix [(n)ia], meaning \\"the place with big houses\\". The Slavonian \\"domas\\" is a corrupt form of the same Latin word, and has the same meaning (house, domestic). After the great migrations period, according to a document published by the Hungarian historian Frigzes, Domașnea was mentioned for the first time in 1436. However, some new evidence, especially those made by Dr. Dimitrie Roman, bring up to light a document which indicates the fact that a group of houses were certainly located on the border of the village from 159 BC. This document it is a military Certificate issued on the name of a Celtic soldier named Ivornecus by the Rman emperor Hadrianus, on 27 September 159 A.D.

Invasion  Donald Dubh Cameron, XV Chief of Clan Cameron, died, leaving an infant son, Allan, at the head of the clan. The chief of Clan MacKintosh, leading 200 men, invaded the Cameron lands near Loch Arkaig. A bloody battle ensued.  Battles  Though outnumbered, the Camerons had the high ground and soon there were many dead and injured from the MacKintoshes. MacKintosh led his men in retreat around the head of Loch Eil to the Ardgour shore and rallied his men. The Camerons were in swift pursuit and a second engagement took place, with similar results as the first. In the midst of this action, the chief of MacKintosh is believed to have been killed by Donald 'Taillear Dubh na Tuaighe' Cameron (son of the XIV Chief of Clan Cameron), with a fearsome Lochaber axe. MacKintosh's followers took their stricken chief and fell back to Bun Garbhain (Bun Garvan). Both sides met once again for an indeterminate time, before disengaging for the night. The MacKintoshes made camp in a small hollow called Cuil nan Cuileag, and thought that they were safe. However, the Camerons stormed the encampment and killed every MacKintosh.  Aftermath  The mother of Allan Cameron, the infant chief of Clan Cameron, was in fact a MacKintosh. After the battle, Taillear Dubh came to give her an account of the fighting. Enraged with the news of all the dead MacKintosh, she tried to kill her son, but Taillear Dubh intervened in time. Allan Cameron was safe, but his mother was banished from Lochaber forever.

It is run by the Armed Forces of Bangladesh and is under the Ministry of Defense of Bangladesh. A Major General of Bangladesh Army's Medical Corps is the Commandant of the college. It has two types of students: Medical Cadets (AFMC cadets) and Army Medical Corps Cadets (AMC cadets). AFMC cadets can become civilian doctors after completing the MBBS course, but AMC cadets should join the Army Medical Corps (AMC) of the Bangladesh Army. Campus of AFMC The college is listed in the AVICENNA Directory for Medicine (previously known as the WHO World Directory of Medical Schools). History The academic activities of the Armed Forces Medical College commenced through induction of 56 medical cadets on 20 June 1999. The college is affiliated to Bangladesh University of Professionals and recognized by Bangladesh Medical & Dental Council (BMDC). So far 20 batches of a total of 1700 (approx.) students have been inducted. The students of the first 15 batches are now doctors and the 14th batch has completed their internship training in the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Dhaka. Remaining batches are progressing as per the academic schedule. The admission is based on merit, keeping in conformity with the Government order published vide AFMC instruction -1/2003 Aims and objectives AFMC aims to train its students for five academic years in accordance with the syllabus laid down by the Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council (BMDC) for the MBBS degree, so as to train a group of quality doctors for the Armed Forces and the nation. The objectives of Armed Forces Medical College (according to the official website) are: *To teach biomedical sciences traditionally required for medical graduates to meet the responsibilities of providing preventive as well as curative health care to the people of Bangladesh. *To produce well disciplined, self-motivated and dedicated doctors imbued with the spirit of devotion of duty, kindness, tolerance, patience and compassion. *To impart those aspects of basic military training as are required to turn each cadet into a highly disciplined, physically and mentally fit, morally and ethically upright and professionally dedicated medical graduates capable of providing health care services in adverse physical and psychosocial environment both in and outside the country and during war and peace. *To instill a wide knowledge of the social and economic condition of Bangladesh with a view to imbuing them the beliefs, values and ideals of the nation. *To inspire development of essential character qualities, strong sense of righteousness and a basic desire to serve the suffering humanity. Dormitories AFMC is a residential institution, with the students viewed as 'medical cadets'. It is compulsory for cadets to stay in the dormitories as provided by the college authority. The cadets must follow all rules and regulations regarding customs and etiquette, decorum and decency of the dormitory living as framed (or will be framed from time to time) by the college authority. There are separate dormitories for male and female medical cadets near the college campus. The scenery AFMC has been gifted is picturesque. The cadets are provided with messing and allied services including laundry facilities. The messing, laundry and allied charges are paid by the cadets. On arrival to the college, the medical cadets are issued with the necessary uniforms and other supporting items, the costs of which are included in the fees. The boys' dorm and the girls' dorm are identical in structure. Each dormitory is composed of two blocks and eight floors with a total of 160 rooms (80 rooms in each block) that hold two cadets each, so a potential total of 320 students can stay in each dormitory. The bathrooms are shared between two rooms and consist of two toilet-and-shower rooms and two sinks. There is also a TV room, a prayer room, a waiting room (for parents and guardians), a common room for indoor games, a barber shop and a tailors' shop on the first (ground) floor, as well as a dining room on the second floor. Male dormitory A & B block, Intern dormitory (From front to behind) Female dormitory A & B block After passing the final exam, interns must move out of the student dorms and thereafter they may choose whether to go to work from home or from the internee dormitory; it's not compulsory for interns to stay in the internee dormitory as it is for cadets. The internee dormitory itself is different in structure - there are no separate buildings for the boys and girls but rather a single building with a demarcation in between i.e. no connection between either sides of the dorm. The boys' side and the girls' side of the dorm are mirror images of each other: each side has six floors, the top five floors having six rooms on each floor, so a total of 30 rooms for each side and a potential total of 60 boys or girls can be housed (120 interns in total). The internee dorm rooms are larger than their student counterparts and also contain a separate bathroom in each room. There is also technically a dining room, living room and kitchen on the ground floor. Subjects and examinations Like any other medical college in Bangladesh, the five-year course is divided into three parts (the first part being preclinical), with each part leading up to a professional examination (or 'prof') and consisting of subjects specific to that prof. The First Professional Examination (done in the second year) consists of: *Anatomy *Biochemistry *Physiology The Second Professional Examination (done in the third year) consists of: *Community Medicine *Forensic Medicine The Third Professional Examination (done in the fourth year) consists of: *Microbiology *Pathology *Pharmacology The Final Professional Examination (done in the fifth year) consists of: *Gynecology *Medicine *Surgery AFMC is the only medical college in Bangladesh affiliated with the Bangladesh University of Professionals (until recent years it was affiliated with the University of Dhaka).Medical Cadets in a classroom The internship that follows completion of the course is carried out for a year at the nearby Combined Military Hospital (CMH). Internship there is compulsory, though foreign students are not paid. Extracurricular activities Music, dance, basketball, football and cricket.

Born in Erith, Kent, on 27 March 1906 to Albert Victor Downton (1873 - 1925; an engineer) and Flora Edith (1875 - 1962; née Mitchell) both of Wiltshire, Downton drew well from an early age. He was educated at Erith Convent, followed by Erith Grammar School. At the age of fifteen he won the youth silver medal of the Royal Drawing Society. He was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge (1925–1928), first in English and then in Art History, and then trained as a painter at the Slade. Downton played the violin all his life, was often invited to give performances, and always participated in the fortnight-long Grittleton Summer School of Music in Malvern, Worcestershire. He also wrote books, such as The Death of Art (1937) and Craftsmanship, Art and Criticism (1993). But it is his paintings for which he is now chiefly remembered. He travelled regularly around Europe, and was particularly happy in northern Italy. His main subject was young girlhood, rendered in the manner of the Italian old masters and with the tempera technique that had been revived by the Birmingham Group. Both his subject matter and his techniques were deeply unfashionable during most of his adult life, and he ceased to exhibit after the start of the Second World War, during which he was a conscientious objector, working on the land in Shropshire and Pitlochry, Scotland. He had two sisters: Hilda (1901 - 2005) and Mary (1903 - 1989). Hilda, who lived to 104, was a talented artist. Her painting of Ightham Mote is owned by the National Trust, and it was she who established the John Downton Award in 2000. Her legacy also provided for a specialist music room at Walthamstow Hall School in her brother's name. John Downton's portrait of Hilda was gifted to the Hull Museum Collection He never married, and lived mostly in Cambridge. On his death in 1991, all his work passed to The Downton Trust. A major retrospective exhibition and catalogue was produced in 1996, and the exhibition toured the UK. His three main masterpieces are: The Battle (1935, now in Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery); Portrait of a Girl (1938, now in The Tate); Nora Russell (1935, which was gifted to the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery, Bournemouth, in 1998). There is an annual John Downton Award for Young Artists, given to those attending secondary schools in the county of Kent.
