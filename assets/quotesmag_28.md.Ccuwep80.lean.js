Beneke chaired the American Board of Bioanalysis (1968‚Äì2004), he lived in Florida and died in 2010 at the age of 91. He made contributions to the field of human mycoses. Study and work background Beneke graduated from Miami University (Ohio) in 1940. After getting a PhD from University of Illinois in 1948, he became a faculty member of Michigan State University (MSU), from which he retired in 1987. Beneke had two major research interests. The first study was about species in the puffball genus Calvatia, particularly Calvatia gigantea. In 1964, he researched human fungal pathogens in Brazilian soil. Afterwards, he discovered some particular traits of mycology for medical and became expert of human mycoses. Especially Candida and candidiasis were his concentrations. Numerous books were published by Beneke and his partner Alvin Rogers; these publications set fundamental criteria for the later studies. When Beneke was in MSU, he taught medical mycology for the students of physicians, microbiologists and veterinarians at MSU with Rogers, and at the Medical School of the Federal University of Mina Gerais, Belo Horizontal Brazil during the summers.

He qualified as a physician in London and later became a medical researcher who published the first double-blind scientific trial on chlorpromazine to treat schizophrenia. He is regarded as the father of modern neuropsychopharmacology and directed the first experimental psychiatric Uffculme Clinic in Birmingham, UK. He was responsible for the setting up of international organisations and university departments to further the investigation of the effects of psychopharmacy. He spent the latter part of his career endeavouring to bring higher levels of humanity, compassion and ethics to medical training. Early life Elkes was born of Jewish parents Elkhanan and Miriam in the city of K√∂nigsberg (now Kaliningrad).(BB) His father served in the Russian Army as a medical officer during the Russian Revolution of 1905 and World War I. The family fled to Kovno (now Kaunas) in the newly formed Lithuanian Republic. Elkes attended Schwabe's Gymnasium, a Hebrew Jewish high school, with a Zionist orientation. Elkes was an outstanding student graduating with honours and developing an interest in chemistry. He hoped to become a \\"scientist serving medicine\\". This was born from the fact that he had a close relationship with his father whom he viewed as a great example of physicianship and a good person. Following his education at the Gymnasium he spent a year in a German language school in K√∂nigsberg where he graduated at the top of his class. This was followed by four months at Lausanne University Hospital attending lectures as a run-up to medical training. At this time Elkes' father was physician to the British Ambassador in Lithuania and the ambassador encouraged Elkes to go to England to undertake medical training, providing a letter of recommendation for him. In 2011 in a talk to the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology Elkes identified three people who had inspired him: Einstein in physics, Erlich for his work on neuro-receptors, and Goethe for his rare combination of humanism, scientific creativity and spirit. Career In 1930 Elkes enrolled in the St Mary's Hospital Medical School, Paddington in London where he was tutored by such medical luminaries as Charles Wilson, 1st Baron Moran, Almroth Wright, Alexander Fleming and Aleck Bourne, whose daughter Elkes would later marry. Here he met Professor Alistair Frazer and in 1939 he, Frazer and Steward (a student colleague) had a paper on fat absorption published in The Journal of Physiology. The Second World War broke off his family connections and support. He found it difficult to support himself and his sister Sara but was offered a post by Alistair Frazer in the newly formed Transfusion Service where he met Charmian Bourne. Elkes graduated in 1941 and was invited by Frazer to join him as a research fellow in pharmacology at Birmingham University. In 1945 he was promoted to lecturer and in 1948 to senior lecturer and acting director of the department. His research output at this time was considerable, resulting in 16 publications. Elkes' experimental work involved the investigation of the physical chemistry, constitution and structure of biological membranes, the lipoproteins. > Suddenly I realised the nervous system was full of lipoproteins. It was > myelin, a beautiful paracrystalline structure ubiquitously distributed > throughout the nervous system. Elkes work continued with a collaboration with a Ph.D crystallography student, Bryan Finean. Together they developed a technique for the X-ray diffraction of a living frog's sciatic nerve in response to temperature and chemicals. This led Elkes to study the anticholinesterases and the action of acetylcholine. Concurrent with his laboratory work Elkes, together with his wife Charmian, (a general practitioner) started training at the City Hospital, Birmingham and carrying out trials on patients with catatonic schizophrenia using amobarbital, amphetamines and mephenesin. The results showed different responses and demonstrated the possible distribution of different controlling cells with the brain. This work, carried out between 1945 and 1950, brought the Elkes to the attention of the mental health milieu in the UK. In the early 1950s Elkes researched LSD and remained interested in the substance for some time, forming a friendship with pioneering LSD therapist Ronald Sandison in the mid 1950s, and in 1965 inviting Czech LSD therapist Stanislav Grof to come to Baltimore to research LSD as a clinical and research fellow at the Henry Phipps Clinic and in the Research Unit of Spring Grove State Hospital.Elkes, C., and Elkes, J.

Albion Dreaming: A popular history of LSD in Britain. Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd. In 1950 Elkes was awarded a Fulbright Travelling Fellowship in America where he worked at the New England Baptist Hospital in Boston and at Norwich State Hospital, Connecticut. On his return to Birmingham he was appointed chairman and professor of a new mental health department which he called The Department for Experimental Psychiatry. Elkes continued his work on anticholinesterase, acetylcholine blockers and amphetamines and their action on the activity of the brain and thus behaviour. At this time there was a chance discovery in France of a drug called chlorpromazine and in a double blind trial Elkes demonstrated the efficacy of this drug in controlling the symptoms of schizophrenia. By the mid-1950s Elkes had established himself as the leader in the developing field of psychopharmacology. In 1954 he instigated the first international Neurochemical Symposium in Oxford, England, and in 1957 he arranged the first World Health Organization group on psychotropic drugs. In the same year he was invited to set up an experimental psychiatry programme, the first Clinical Neuropharmacology Research Centre for the National Institute of Mental Health in Washington, D.C. He published a collection of academic papers and became one of the first to suggest the important role of chemicals in the functioning of the brain. Following his move to Washington he resided permanently in the United States. Elkes regarded the centre as an academic \\"greenhouse\\" in which he toiled as \\"a good gardener\\". In 2011 he described those time thus: > It was a wonderful heady time in the middle of a very chronic mental > hospital. There were people coming from virtually all over the world and > there were talks and discussions and excitement. At the same time there was > always and always, which is what we had hoped, the presence of the patient. > For example, you go to the canteen and there's a patient with schizophrenia > hallucinating under a tree. You're never very far from the problem that > bought you here. And, gradually there developed a sense of place, of > belonging. Gradually, I realised that, my God, together we created something > pretty wonderful. In 1963 Elkes took a post as chairman of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. He renamed his department the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences and worked toward integrating psychiatry with the physical medicine disciplines. His educational innovations attracted a number of other medical luminaries to his department. Among them were Sol Snyder, Joseph Coyle, Ross Baldessarini and Joseph V. Brady. Elkes was the founder and first Chairman of the Board of Fellowship House, a residential intermediate-care rehabilitation facility for people with mental illness which still exists in a developed form to the modern day. Elkes left Johns Hopkins in 1974 and took a named professorship in McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, where he developed ideas about the need for self-awareness in physicians and the necessity to humanise medical education and training. He was also Emeritus Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Louisville, Kentucky, where he continued to develop his ideas of incorporating social, ethical and psychological dimensions with the biological foundation he had already created. He married Josephine Rhodes, and while living in Canada he returned to painting, a long-standing hobby. His summer home in Prince Edward Island, Canada, offered plenty of opportunity for this. It was also in their summer home on Prince Edward Island he completed his memoir on his father, Elkhanan Elkes.

Family life His father, Elkhanan Elkes, an eminent Lithuanian physician, was interned in 1941 in Kovno's ghettos where the Nazi military appointed him leader of the Jewish internees. In 1944 the ghetto was attacked and the occupants shipped to concentration camps where Elkhanan, three uncles, an aunt and nieces and nephews all died. Elkes' mother survived the Landsberg-Dachau concentration camp and came to London. She later emigrated to Israel with her daughter, Sara, where she died in the 70s. In December 1944 Elkes married Charmian Bourne. They had a daughter, Anna and later a granddaughter, Laura. Towards the end of his tenure in Johns Hopkins University (about 1974) he and Charmian divorced. Charmian died in 1996. He married his second wife Josephine Rhodes in December 1975, she died in 1999 During his time in Ontario Elkes wrote a memoir about his father. At his death he was married to Sally Lucke Elkes, an arts educator of Sarasota who encouraged him in his later water colour art work and arranged exhibitions of his work.

Born in Xinhui, Guangdong Province of China, he moved to Hong Kong in 1957, and began to study sculpture. He joined the Chinese Contemporary Artists' Guild in 1960. He is also a member of Hong Kong Visual Arts Society, Hong Kong Graphic Society and Hong Kong Sculptors Association. Specialized in woodblock print, paper relief and sculpture, his versatility marked his unique characteristics. He liked to use harmonious colors and simple compositions to reveal everyday objects in natural environments, such as autumn foliage, wilting leaves and discarded ropes with special attention to tonal balance and textural treatment. Primarily known as a sculptor and printmaker, Ha Bik Chuen had parallel practices of photographing exhibitions he attended, and collecting materials including illustrated magazines and artist portraits which he also used in the construction of book collages. Ha‚Äôs entire collection has been stored in his Hong Kong studio in To Kwa Wan since his passing in 2009 until its relocation to Fo Tan in 2016. Among the collection are over 100,000 photographs, 3,500 contact sheets, exhibition ephemera, periodicals collected by Ha from 1960s onward, which are important resources for the construction of Hong Kong art history.  Ha Bik Chuen archive  In 2013 the Ha family invited Asia Art Archive (AAA) to launch a pilot project to map, assess, and selectively digitise Ha‚Äôs archive. Made available to a wider audience for the first time, the archive consists of a vast selection of Ha‚Äôs collage books, exhibition documentation, and exhibition catalogues. In 2016, due to the deteriorating conditions of Ha's To Kwa Wan studio, his archive was relocated to a new space in Fo Tan by AAA. The relocation took place in the month of July, with the materials indexed by zones to preserve their original locations in the studio. Up to 500 boxes of materials were transferred from the 700 sq feet studio to its current new home in Fo Tan. The collection is currently housed in an industrial building in Fo Tan, its storage system is specially designed by Sky-Yutaka design studio. The relocation was part of a three-year project (2016 ‚Äì 19) fully funded by Hong Kong Jockey Club to process and selectively digitise the materials. The digitised materials are part of AAA online collection and the physical materials are gradually made available for public access. This three-year project aims to open up and develop discourses and new knowledge with practitioners from in and outside art and art historical fields through research, curatorial residencies, workshops and fellowships. It also collaborates with schools and universities to open up Ha's archive for educational purposes. By facilitating the circulation of the materials and bringing attention to their art historical values, this project aims to find a permanent home for the collection, to preserve it for the future construction of Hong Kong art history.

The exhibition stemmed from ongoing research into the archive of Ha Bik Chuen, and shed light on Ha‚Äôs idiosyncratic system, dating back to the 1960s, that he used to organise the collected materials. A selection of original and reproduced materials from Ha‚Äôs To Kwa Wan studio were exhibited including collage books, ephemeral materials, magazines, contact sheets and photos. The Hong Kong based photographer and filmmaker Luke Casey produced a new video as part of the exhibition. The exhibition display system was designed by the architects Sarah Kwok Yan Lee and Yutaka Yano, and their students from Chinese University of Hong Kong also collaborated on the project. Based on an exhibition documented by Ha in 1977, the students reconstructed the exhibition in miniature architectural model as a way to activate the historical photographs. The local cultural practitioner Lau Kin Wah also organised public programmes in relation to the exhibition.  Walid Raad: Section 39_Index XXXVII: Traboulsi  Exhibition view of Walid Raad: Section 39_Index XXXVII: Traboulsi at Asia Art Archive Library in 2016 The media artist Walid Raad was introduced to the work of Ha Bik Chuen during his 2014 residency at the Asia Art Archive. Raad immediately realised Ha's affinity to one of his fictional collaborators, Suha Traboulsi. A fictional collaboration was forged between Traboulsi and Ha, which resulted in the exhibition Section 39_Index XXXVII: Traboulsi in 2016 at the AAA library, > ‚ÄòBetween 1967 and 2009, Hong Kong-based artist Ha Bik Chuen collaborated > with the Beirut-based artist Suha Traboulsi on a number of projects. Most of > these remained out of view until 2010, after Ha's death, when his archives > were unpacked and studied. The two met in 1962 when Traboulsi travelled to > Hong Kong to research Chinese calligraphic practices. They struck an > immediate friendship that soon turned into an artistic collaboration from > afar: Ha in Hong Kong and Traboulsi in Beirut. For Section 39_Index XXXVII: Traboulsi at the AAA Library, works from two collaborative series are on display: 'Editor‚Äôs Introduction' (1972‚Äì1980) and 'Notes' (1983‚Äì2009).'Editor's Introduction' consists of several 'sculptural spaces' built by Traboulsi and inspired by Ha's ephemera-laden collage books. 'Notes' consists of Traboulsi's reproductions of canonical modern paintings by Arab artists: Inji Efflatoun, Abdel Hadi el-Gazzar, Hamed Nada, Ibrahim el- Salahi, Marwan, Seta Manoukian, among others. The Traboulsi reproductions were scattered among several of Ha's collaged notebooks. Traboulsi never revealed where her productions were strewn, and it has taken several years of painstaking archival research to reassemble some of her paintings shown here.‚Äô ‚Äì Walid Raad  Selected exhibition records = Solo Exhibitions  1979 Shaw Rimmington Gallery, Toronto, Canada 1979 Printmakers Art Gallery, Taipei 1981 Photographs Thinking of Sculpture, Hong Kong Arts Centre 1983 Hui Arts Gallery, Minnesota, United States 1986 Alisan Fine Arts, Hong Kong 1991 Hanart T Z Gallery, Taipei 1992 Hong Kong Artists Series : Ha Bik-Chuen, Hong Kong Museum of Art 1994 Hanart T Z Gallery, Hong Kong 1997 Ha Bik-chuen- Sentient Beings: Solo Exhibitions of Relief Prints, China Oil Painting Gallery, Hong Kong  Group Exhibitions  1969,1972,1975 Contemporary Hong Kong Art Exhibition, City Museum and Art Gallery, Hong Kong 1976, 1978, 1980 Norwegian International Print Biennial, Norway 1976 Urban Council Fine Arts Award Winners Exhibition, Hong Kong Museum of Art 1977 Contemporary Hong Kong Art Exhibition, Hong Kong Museum of Art 1978 The 6th International Biennial of Graphic Art, Firenze-Prato, Italy 1979-1983,1989 Contemporary Hong Kong Art Biennial Exhibition, Hong Kong Museum of Art 1984 Contemporary Open Air Sculpture, The Pizza of the Hong Kong Coliseum 1985 The Sculpture Show, Hong Kong Exchange Square 1991 The 5th International Biennial Print Exhibition, Taipei Fine Arts Museum 1992 The 10th Norwegian International Print Triennale, Norway 1997 Reunion and Vision - Contemporary Hong Kong Art 1997, Hong Kong Museum of Art 1997 Hong Kong Art 1997, National Museum of Fine Arts, Beijing; Guangdong Museum of Art, Guangzhou  Awards  1975 Urban Council Fine Art Awards (Sculpture and Print) 1978 First Prize Winner at the Aberdeen Centre Sculpture Design Competition, Hong Kong 1991 The Artist of the Year Awards 1991 (Printmaker of the year) 1993 Bronze medal, The 1st Print Exhibition, Xi'an 1996 Lu Xun Prize of Print, Chinese Print-makers Association 1997 Fellowship for Artistic Development, Hong Kong Arts Development Council  External links  * Ha Bik Chuen Archive at Asia Art Archive * Excessive Enthusiasm: Ha Bik Chuen and the Archive as Practice * Walid Raad: Section 39_Index XXXVII: Traboulsi * Ha Bik Chuen at Hong Kong Art Archive *ËóùË°ìÂ•á‰∫∫Â§èÁ¢ßÊ≥â Áïô‰ΩèÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÂçä‰∏ñÁ¥ÄËÆäÂπª: Ming Pao References Hong Kong artists 1925 births 2009 deaths Hong Kong photographers ","title":"Ha Bik Chuen"},{"id":"48592419","text":"The St. Croix Boom Company House and Barn is a historic residence in Stillwater Township, Minnesota, United States, built circa 1885. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 for having local significance in the theme of industry. It was nominated as the only known standing building associated with the St. Croix Boom Company, which operated a log boom critical to Minnesota's logging industry from 1856 to 1914. Description The St. Croix Boom Company House and Barn is located directly across Minnesota State Highway 95 from the St. Croix Boom Site, north of the city of Stillwater. The house has two stories while the barn has one and a half. Both are sided with clapboard and sport decorative spindlework on their gables. The house has a one-story wraparound porch. Originally built on a simple rectangular plan, the house has been modified with additions to the south and west, plus a dormer on the west. History The house and barn were built around 1885 for W. Frank McGray, who served as the superintendent of the boom site for 34 years, from 1871 to 1905. McGray and his family had been living on a farm on the Wisconsin side of the St. Croix River until his employer built him this official residence on company property adjacent to the boom site. McGray purchased the house from the Boom Company in 1895 and continued to live in it from his retirement in 1905 until he sold the property in 1919. McGray had worked for the Boom Company since its founding in 1856, and he reportedly sent the first log through on opening day. When the log boom closed on June 12, 1914, the 80-year-old retired superintendent was honored by being the one to send the last log through as well.

Justin Woodward Harding (1888‚Äì1976) was a former lawyer, judge, and member of the Bar of the state of Ohio. He was an alternate judge at the Judges' Trial, part of the massive Nuremberg Trials.  Life  Judge Harding was born in 1888 in Franklin, Ohio son to Clarence Henry (Larry) Harding, the manager of the Harding Paper division of the American Writing Paper Company. He attended Franklin High School (Ohio) and graduated in 1906. After leaving Franklin he attended law school at the University of Michigan, graduating in 1914.

Characters=Main characters ; : :Yato is the titular stray god of the series (Noragami) who wants to build his own shrine. In the past, he was a . He wears a tracksuit and scarf and refers to himself as \\"Yato God\\" (Yatogami). He calls himself a and often writes his cell number in public areas in case someone needs his help. He usually charges five yen (about five cents in U.S. currency), which is what Japanese people usually give when praying at a shrine. Yato is gullible and often wastes his money on scams and good-luck charms that allegedly bring happiness. As he \\"stopped\\" being a god of calamity due to his dislike of violence, he is forgotten by most humans. This results in Yato developing athazagoraphobia (the fear of being forgotten). Hiyori, a human girl, and Yato's current Regalia (weapon), Yukine, are the two closest people to him, and he is protective of both. He shares a fatherly relationship with Yukine, calling Yukine his child at one point, and becomes extremely attached to Hiyori; romantic feelings are hinted at. Yato also shares a close relationship with Kofuku, the God of Poverty, who is there for him when he is in need of help. Yato's actual name is Yaboku, \\"Yato\\" being a name that a previous Regalia mistakenly gave him due to a kanji mix-up. He has been using the name ever since. ; : :Hiyori is a human girl in her third year (9th grade) of middle school, and a high school first-year (10th grade) starting from chapter 25 of the manga. After saving Yato from a bus accident, she becomes a Half-Phantom, involuntarily falling asleep due to her soul slipping out of her body. She is somehow stuck between the human world and the afterlife, something she asks Yato to fix. Because of this, she starts spending more time with him, and he becomes the closest person to her, to the point where she is able to recognize him by scent. Despite it being her best chance to return to normal, Hiyori refuses to have her bond to Yato cut, as it means she will forget him. It is hinted that she has feelings for Yato, as she feels jealous when he almost drunkenly kisses Bishamon, the God of War. Hiyori shares a sisterly relationship with Yukine and tutors him when he expresses a desire to learn. Hikyori Iki is also the main character and narrator of the story, especially so in the manga. ; : :Yukine is Yato's current Regalia. His Regalia name is . His Regalia form is a katana. Yukine died at a young age, making him miss normal life as a teenager. Every time he sins in any way, Yato suffers injuries. Even though Yato is his master, Yukine does not really show Yato respect as much as how he actually respects him. After being saved by Hiyori and undergoing an ablution, he becomes more obedient and extremely loyal to Yato, wanting to be a proper Regalia for him. Like Yato, Yukine treasures Hiyori's existence and fears that Hiyori will forget them when she grows up. Yukine later evolves into a Blessed Vessel when he saves Yato from certain death, proving his loyalty to him, and takes the shape of twin katanas. Gods Gods in Noragami are gods according to the Japanese belief, who are categorized into several aspects, like war and poverty. They are those who grant human wishes, usually after receiving a prayer and a monetary offering. Their existence depends on humans' faith in them. Gods with shrines do not really die when killed. They are simply reborn, taking the same appearance, but usually growing up from a child form first. ; : :He is the god of academics. He has several Regalia and has his own shrine (where Yato often passes the night), much to Yato's envy. He sometimes assumes human form to intervene if Yato goes out of control playing around. A the beginning, his Regalia were Mayu, Tsuyu, Ayu, Nayu, Miyu y Moyu,Norigami season 1 episode 3 but Miyu is cast out and exiled after becoming corrupted by Yukine's darkness and Tsuyu was (temporarily) murdered by the heavens in a trial against Yato.Norigami season 1 episode 10 ; : :She is a , posing as Ebisu. She is energetic and gentle, but can be fierce and stands up to even Bishamonten if needed. Her regalia is Daikoku. Later, Kofuku and Daikoku take Yato and Yukine in, allowing them to live at their temple. ; : :Bishamonten, whose name is often abbreviated to Bishamon and also nicknamed Veena, is the god of combat, taking the form of a woman with long blonde hair. She has many Regalia due to her being unable to abandon spirits attacked by Phantoms, and forms a large group over time, causing her trouble as she cannot tend to all of them properly. She has a strong hate for Yato, as he killed her previous clan of Regalia in the past. Later on in the manga, it is revealed Yato eliminated her Regalia on Kazuma's request to save her life. An argument over who stung Bishamonten resulted in all the other Regalia getting into a massive fight that caused them to develop into a massive phantom. She stops hunting Yato after learning the truth. Despite this, they continue to have a stormy relationship. :She has many Regalia that live at her palatial home,Noragami Aragoto episode 1 though the ones she uses most often are Kazuma, Akiha, Karuha, Kazuha, Kinuha, Tsuguha and Yugiha.

He then corrupts Aiha and many of her Regalia are devoured by a Phantom invoked by Kugaha.Noragami Aragoto episode 5 She later revokes Kugaha for his betrayalNoragami Aragoto episode 6 but saves Aiha by undergoing an ablution. ; : :Rab≈ç is an enigmatic character and appears only in the anime, although he also appears in the manga special Awase Kagami. He is often seen conversing with Nora and has been known to be able to control Phantoms. He is also known as a god of calamity, similar to Yato, and having worked together with him, and seeing him being what he is now making him wanted to bring back the old Yato. After his defeat at the hands of Yato, it is suggested that Rab≈ç simply wanted Yato (his fellow calamity god) to kill him. He is known to kill humans, Regalia, other gods and Phantoms, not caring what the job is, as long as he was wished to do it. ; : :One of Seven Gods of Fortune, who offers to buy Yukine from Yato after he becomes a Blessed Vessel, or even use him as a Nora. He dresses like a businessman, and is rather harsh with his words. Unlike most gods, he has no problems with using Nora. Having been abandoned by his mother Izanami, he views himself as an outcast, and thus sympathizes with them. He plans to use Phantoms as Regalia, and his constant failures in that cause him to reincarnate frequently. ; : :Another of the Seven Gods of Fortune, who also goes by the name of . He is a close friend of both Bishamonten and Ebisu. He appears as a big and gruff man with blonde hair who is constantly wearing sunglasses, combined with traditional Japanese clothes. Despite his appearance, however, he is very friendly and fond of rabbits. He is capable of turning into a monstrous spider and is said to be so dangerous even without a Regalia that he was once sealed. Regalia :A Regalia is a divine weapon possessed by gods. They are former humans that died for a reason against their will (e.g. not through suicide). Regalia change their shape into a unique weapon when their gods called their Regalia name. Usually, each god has a naming scheme to serve as proof that the god wants a specific type of Regalia, and also as an affirmation of a familial bond. Certain Regalia will evolve after they risk their name to protect their gods into a better shape, which is called a . ; : :She is Yato's former Regalia, and currently one of Tenjin's Regalia. Despite her harsh attitude toward Yato, she does appear to hold a considerable amount of respect and concern for him. An example of this is when she volunteers to be a part of the ablution required to save Yato's life despite the risks involved. When she was still Yato's Regalia, she was given the name and transformed into a small dagger. As Tenjin's Regalia, she transforms into a smoking pipe. ; : :He is one of Bishamonten's Regalia and exemplar. His name as Regalia is , whose shape was originally a nail earring, but because of his close bond with Bishamonten and will to protect her, he became a Blessed Regalia and transformed into a cherry blossom shaped earring who is capable of tracking enemies and also to guide other Regalia in combat. He regards Yato as his benefactor, despite Yato being enemies with Bishamonten. ; : :Daikoku is Kofuku's somewhat overprotective Regalia. He regards himself as Kofuku's husband, and once raised a child Regalia with her. His name as Regalia is , whose form is a fan. ; : :One of the main antagonists of the series. She is Yato's former Regalia. \\"Nora,\\" meaning \\"stray,\\" is how the gods call any Regalia who has many masters and thus many names. Because of this, Nora have bad reputations and are the target of prejudice by the gods, but are nevertheless used for tasks that they do not want their own Regalia to be used. Nora was named by Yato, her Regalia name being , and she still offers herself to be used by him, though he always resists. She causes a lot of trouble, going so far as to destroy Yukine's faith in himself. In the anime, she first tries to kill Hiyori with Phantoms and, when that fails, she erases Hiyori's memory of Yukine and Yato. It is noted that, had she been summoned in the ablution ceremony, she would have killed Yukine. In the manga, it is revealed that she had been Yato's Regalia since he was a child and was Yato's childhood companion. ; : :Kuraha is Bishamonten's Regalia. His Regalia form is a male lion with a scar on his right eye. His name as Regalia is . ; : :A main antagonist of the second season. Kugaha is Bishamonten's former Regalia. He was Bishamonten's doctor, but betrayed her because he wanted to reincarnate Bishamonten and become her new exemplar. His Regalia form is a balance scale. He is actually a Nora and his name \\"Kuga\\" was revoked. His name as Bishamonten's Regalia was . ; : :Aiha is Bishamonten's Regalia. She was manipulated by Kugaha to help her reincarnate Bishamonten and was severely blighted. Her Regalia form is a silver knight armor used in combat. ; : :Akiha is Bishamonten's Regalia. His name as Regalia is , whose form is a dagger. ; : :Karuha is Bishamonten's Regalia. Her name as Regalia is , whose form is a revolver. ; : :Kazuha is Bishamonten's Regalia.

Others ; : :Tsuyu is the spirit of a plum tree who has lived with Tenjin for 1,000 years. She is not a Regalia, but rather stays with Tenjin out of a lasting love. Because she is a tree spirit, she is able to communicate with other trees. ; : :Yato and Nora's \\"father\\", A third year student at Hiyori's school, and one of the main antagonists of the series. Fujisaki is actually the name of the youth possessed by Yato and Nora's \\"father\\", a human conjurer who lived centuries ago, and has survived the ages through possessing the bodies of other humans. The conjurer is the sole creator of Yato, having done so through wishing for the cull of humanity, with the purpose of helping him destroy the gods. He is also Yato's lifeline, due to being the only human who clearly remembers the nameless god, which is how Yato has been able to survive these past centuries without followers. The conjurer had been to and returned from Yomi, taking with him the first Phantom Brush (Koto no Ha). He seems to be connected to a woman with freckles, as Izanami uses this woman's looks during his time in Yomi. However, at some point in time, the woman died and this appears to have become his primary reason for loathing gods and, therefore, the wish that created Yato. This seems to be further proven by the fact that in chapter 61, Nana shows sympathy for the conjurer, saying he must have had someone he loved who was killed by the heavens because he wouldn't have called them lowly Gods otherwise. ; : :A female student who gets bullied by her classmates. She only appeared in the first chapter of the manga and for a brief moment in the first episode of the anime.

He was the father of Kan≈ç Tan'y≈´, one of the most prominent painters of the school. Life and career Takanobu was born in Kyoto on the 25th day of the 11th month of the 2nd year of Genki.

When Kan≈ç Naganobu (1577‚Äì1654)‚ÄîEitoku's brother‚Äîmoved at the behest of the recently ascendent Tokugawa shogunate to its new administrative capital of Edo (modern Tokyo) around 1610‚Äì15, Takanobu remained in Kyoto, where the commissions he received indicate he was a favourite of the court. At the time only Takanobu and Naganobu had sufficient skill to head branches of the school. With financial backing from the Tokugawa shogunate, Takanobu conceived and oversaw the painting to be done for the new palace of Emperor Go-Mizunoo, work which was finished in 1614 with Takanobu applying the final touches to many of the sliding panels there and in surrounding buildings. The twenty panels depicting thirty-two Chinese sages in the throne room of the shishin-den are attributed to Takanobu.

The book focuses on the culture of medicine and societal views on psychosomatic illness, physical symptoms that stem from the mind. It's All in Your Head was first published by Chatto & Windus in 2015 and won the Wellcome Book Prize in 2016.  Background  Suzanne O'Sullivan became a doctor in 1991, training in both neurology and clinical neurophysiology, at Trinity College Dublin. She works as a consultant neurologist in the national hospital for neurology and neuroscience in London since 2011. The title of the book was created in an ironic sense since patients with psychosomatic illnesses cannot stand being told by medical professionals that their symptoms are all in their head, which gives the impression that it is not real.  Synopsis  In this book, O‚ÄôSullivan recounts her most memorable interactions of patients with severe physical symptoms that she found to come from their mental state in a total of twelve chapters. She starts the book introducing herself and providing information on her medical career and her passion for neurology and mental disorders. The story is not sequential, instead each chapter depicts a different memory of her interactions with her patients. Each patient displays different symptoms varying in severity, but O‚ÄôSullivan comes to the same diagnosis and conclusion that these physical symptoms are actually psychosomatic disorders.  Themes = Societal View on Psychosomatic Illness  Society perceives mental illnesses with a negative connotation bringing many difficulties for those diagnosed within that category of illnesses. O'Sullivan mentions that despite this stigma, psychosomatic illnesses are very common and there is insufficient methods of treatment. The negative view by society causes discrimination towards those who have a mental illness, making it harder to improve their condition. This stigma also makes patients more reluctant to accept their diagnosis and even medical professionals tend to display negative views.  Culture of Medicine  The culture of medicine has caused medical professionals to become insensitive to a patient's mental health and dismiss their physical symptoms by claiming it's all in their head. The book discusses the difficulty of diagnosing those with psychosomatic illnesses since most doctors direct their focus on the physical symptoms and test results. O'Sullivan addresses in her book that doctors must become more empathetic and improve interactions between them and their patients. She also points out her concern that the current standards of treatment for mental illnesses are ineffective or slow to take effect therefore, more importance should be placed on finding more effective treatments.

He was awarded the Prix de Rome (Second Place) in 1873. From 1874, Siberdt commenced exhibiting at all the important Belgian salons with success. He was a successful portrait painter and became the Official Royal Portraitist. The little gamblers Siberdt was appointed a professor at the Antwerp Academy in 1883. Eugene Siberdt, Farewell Dear France at the Knohl Collection Vincent van Gogh started to attend drawing classes after plaster models at the Antwerp Academy on 18 January 1886. Here van Gogh quickly got into trouble with Charles Verlat, the director of the Academy and teacher of a painting class, because of his unconventional painting style. Van Gogh had also clashed with the instructor of the drawing class Franz Vinck. Van Gogh finally started to attend the drawing classes after antique plaster models given by Siberdt. Soon Siberdt and van Gogh came into conflict when the latter did not comply with Siberdt's requirement that drawings express the contour and concentrate on the line. When van Gogh was required to draw the Venus of Milo during a drawing class, he produced the limbless, naked torso of a Flemish peasant woman. Siberdt regarded this as defiance against his artistic guidance and made corrections to van Gogh‚Äôs drawing with his crayon so vigorously that he tore the paper. Van Gogh then flew into a violent rage and shouted at Siberdt: 'You clearly do not know what a young woman is like, God damn it! A woman must have hips, buttocks, a pelvis in which she can carry a baby!' According to some accounts this was the last time van Gogh attended classes at the Academy and he left later for Paris. On 31 March 1886, which was about a month after the confrontation with Siberdt, the teachers of the Academy decided that 17 students, including van Gogh, had to repeat a year. The story that van Gogh was expelled from the Academy by Siberdt is therefore unfounded.Jan Lampo, In het Spoor van de Academie ‚Äì persbericht Governor baron Edward Osy de Zegwaart About ten years after the incident with van Gogh, Siberdt was involved in a conflict with Eugeen Van Mieghem, another student who did not wish to submit to the academic rigour of the Antwerp Academy. This also led to Van Mieghen leaving the Academy.Eugeen Van Mieghem (1875-1930) ‚Äì een kunstenaar van het volk at the Eugeen Van Mieghem Museum Work Eug√®ne Siberdt was a typical representative of the late-Romantic style as developed in Belgium by pupils and teachers of the Antwerp Academy. In particular, the influence of Henri Leys remained paramount at the Academy throughout the second half of the 19th century in style as well as subject matter.'Contradicties: 350 jaar Koninklijke Academie voor Schone Kunsten Antwerpen : 1663-2013'; 2013 The teachers at the Academy encouraged their students to study the antique, draw precisely and stick to the sober and somber palette typical of 19th century academic painting.Ensor's palette at the KMSKA website The conflict between Siberdt and van Gogh is best seen as a conflict between van Gogh's unconventional view of art and the academic view represented by Siberdt. As a typical representative of the academic tradition of the Antwerp academy, Siberdt painted subjects such as genre scenes often of a sentimental nature such as The sad omen, stories from the glorious national artistic history such as The meeting between Erasmus and Quentin Matsys or international historic events such as Martin Luther translating the bible. The historic scenes were typically set in the 16th and 17th century, de period during which Antwerp enjoyed its cultural and commercial heyday. Stories from Goethe's Faust were also a recurring theme.Eugene Siberdt, 2 works: The pact between Faust and Mephisto; Martha and Margaret with a jewelry box, at Mutual Art Siberdt further created history paintings with biblical subjects such as The Prophet Nathan rebukes King David.The Prophet Nathan rebukes King David by Eug√®ne Siberdt at Mayfair Gallery Siberdt painted many Orientalist compositions. These often depict Roma women or harems such as The jewels of a Harem. The latter painting also reflected the contemporary interest in the theme of the harem and the odalisque in Orientalism.Lynne Thornton, Women as Portrayed in Orientalist Painting, www.acr-edition.com, 1994, p. 16 Siberdt was a capable portrait painter who was sought after by private and official patrons.

He later realizes that unbeknownst to him, Totsuka had taken a video moments before his death, which clearly showed Yashiro as the culprit - even though he cannot remember performing murder at all. He later convinces Kuroh to believe him, which he does, and tries to unravel the mystery behind that murder, and the strange events that surround it in this psychic war between the Kings. After enduring a life threatening situation, he finally remembers everything and reintroduces himself as Adolf K. Weismann, the first king and a former researcher of Germany who experimented with the Dresden Slate. Despite his silly, carefree persona, Yashiro is actually extremely clever, and manages to trick even the Blue King, Munakata, in his deceit and guile, and even manipulate Scepter 4 to his advantage using a simple phone call. In K: Return of Kings, he came back to defeat Nagare and his clansmen by using Weismann Down to destroy the Dresden Slate. After the Dresden Slate was destroyed, his soul went back to his original body. In the epilogue, he came back as a teacher at Ashinaka High School. ; : :Known as the as a title, by Yashiro or by Neko, he is a highly skilled swordsman on a mission to hunt down the next \\"Colorless King\\" - whom he believes to be Yashiro - on behalf of his late King and master, Ichigen Miwa. Even though he has a cold exterior, he is a good man who allowed Yashiro a chance to prove his innocence, cooked meals for him and helped around in the festival as an apparent transfer student. For the first few episodes, Kuroh was convinced through the video that Yashiro was evil as he killed Totsuka in cold blood, and sought to kill him as per his master's request. However, he agrees to give Yashiro the benefit of doubt, and now closely monitors his actions. He slowly grows attached to both Yashiro and Neko. ; / : :Neko is a Strain with heterochromia eyes.

She has a strong love and affection for Yashiro and will go to great lengths in order to keep him safe. She refers to him as \\"Neko's Shiro.\\" Later it was also revealed that she also has the ability to manipulate people's memories as well, which is why Yashiro was misled into thinking that he was an ordinary high school student at first. Like Nagare, she was also a survivor of the Kagutsu incident who had gained new powers. Since then, she was forced to manipulate her own memories and live under a new identity as a cat. In the epilogue, she became a student at Ashinaka High School. ; : :The youngest and only female member of HOMRA, she is also a Strain who dresses in gothic lolita fashion.

But he escapes after receiving a phone call from Totsuka's murderer, which he was angered into searching for. According to Kuroh, he has 'ties thicker than blood' with the members of his clan. He is much more insecure about his power than he may seem. He has known Totsuka since his high school days, and Izumo for even longer.

He wears glasses, and has a calm, elegant demeanor. He likes puzzles in his spare time. He is shown to be extremely worried about Mikoto's safety despite them being enemies, and was immensely frustrated by how Mikoto does not seem to appear to care about his own life at all. As a King, he is strong and powerful as he easily overwhelmed Kuroh without drawing his saber, but the full extent of his power is yet unknown. He is also shown to have no malice towards other clans, or Strains, even going out of his way to rescue Anna Kushina from an attack by the Green Clan in K: Missing Kings, and taking in a Strain baby in K: Days of Blue.

Later he also does his best to support Anna and reconciles with Fushimi. ; : :One of the first members of HOMRA, along with Mikoto and Izumo. He has a personality that attracts people, and he was the mood-maker of HOMRA. According to Izumo, he was the weakest member. However, he was also one of the few people Mikoto was dependent on.

He was Yata's friend since middle school and they joined HOMRA together. After joining, Yata became more distant from him. Unlike Yata, Fushimi never felt comfortable in HOMRA.

Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, French police identified Abdelhamid Abaaoud as the suspected mastermind of the attacks. After learning that a relative of Abaaoud might be located in Saint-Denis, police organised surveillance of and ultimately an assault on the location. The raid occurred in the morning of 18 November 2015, five days after the Paris attacks. Police fired nearly 5,000 rounds during the raid, and French soldiers were reported to have used high-powered munitions on the apartment building, located on rue du Corbillon in Saint-Denis. Abaaoud, a woman named Hasna A√Øt Boulahcen, and Chakib Akrouh, reportedly a perpetrator in the Paris attacks and suicide bomber in Saint-Denis, were killed, and five people were arrested. Operation In the early morning of 18 November 2015, French police, including Research, Assistance, Intervention, Deterrence (RAID), backed up by military units, launched an offensive in Saint-Denis against a building presumed to be the location of alleged Paris attacks mastermind Abdelhamid Abaaoud. The target was a building at 8 rue du Corbillon, less than from the Stade de France where three suicide bombings took place on 13 November. Police said a tip from Morocco had confirmed that Abaaoud was in France. They were aware that Hasna A√Øt Boulahcen, also of Moroccan origin and well-known to them as a suspect in a drug ring investigation during which her telephone was tapped, was an associate. They followed her to the rue du Corbillon apartment building on 17 November and viewed Abaaoud entering with her. At 4:20 am the next morning, police launched the full-on assault of a second-story apartment in that Saint-Denis building, believing that Abaaoud was hiding there with at least five accomplices. The initial offensive was repelled by the militants. Explosives laid by police at the entrance were ineffective as the door was armoured, allowing the militants inside time to arm themselves and respond. At 5:55 am, several trucks arrived with reinforcements from France's military along with ambulances to treat the wounded. Deputy Mayor of Saint-Denis St√©phane Peu warned residents to stay indoors and that the explosions were a military operation. At 6:27 am, two police helicopters arrived on the scene to support forces on the ground. At 6:55 am, additional police reinforcements arrived. Around 7:20 am, heavy gunfire erupted and multiple explosions, presumed to be police grenades, were heard by residents nearby. It was later reported that one of these explosions was a suicide bomber who had lured police to the building in an attempt to draw them into blast range. Riot police began to clear the streets of civilian onlookers who had gathered. At 7:45 am, at least 20 residents of nearby buildings were evacuated. Aftermath The siege ended by 8:20 am. French officials then announced that at least two militants, including a suicide bomber, were killed and eight were captured. They said five police were injured and a Belgian shepherd police dog named Diesel was killed. Diesel had worked for the RAID unit for five of her seven years, and was the first RAID dog killed on duty. She was due to retire the next spring. It was not announced what caused these casualties. The building's third story collapsed due to the explosions, leaving the scene structurally unsafe for investigators. According to Paris prosecutor Francois Molins, police fired nearly 5000 rounds during a gun battle that lasted about an hour. On 19 November, the Paris prosecutor's office announced that Abaaoud was among those killed in the raid, and that he had been positively identified using fingerprints. According to some reports, police located Abaaoud by tracking A√Øt Boulahcen's mobile phone once they determined through intelligence that the former was still in France. During police surveillance, they were observed entering the building on rue du Corbillon together on the evening before the raid. The Belgian state broadcaster RTBF incorrectly reported that the suicide bomber was Hasna A√Øt Boulahcen, who was Abaaoud's cousin according to some reports, and claimed that this was the first incident of a suicide bombing by a female in France. (in French) Subsequently, numerous media reports continued to indicate that A√Øt Boulahcen had died when she triggered a suicide bomb. On 20 November, however, the Paris prosecutor announced that the suicide bomber was an unidentified man, based on forensic examination of the remains. (in French) A√Øt Boulahcen died when the suicide bomber triggered the explosive vest. She had been a fan of Hayat Boumeddiene, a suspected accomplice of Boumeddiene's common law husband Amedy Coulibaly. Coulibaly was the main suspect for the Montrouge shooting in which municipal police officer Clarissa Jean-Philippe was shot and killed, and was also the hostage-taker and gunman in the Porte de Vincennes siege, where he killed four hostages and was himself killed by police. A√Øt Boulahcen had lauded Boumeddiene on Facebook. According to one of her friends, A√Øt Boulahcen was first cousin of Abaaoud and was smitten with him. She had helped Abaaoud after the Paris attacks and rented the Saint-Denis apartment the night before the raid. French authorities later identified the suicide bomber as Chakib Akrouh based on DNA evidence. Akrouh, a Belgian-Moroccan dual citizen, had been one of the three perpetrators of gun attacks on cafes and restaurants during the Paris attacks. Later reports concluded that the individuals in the building had only a handgun, not assault weapons as was originally reported, and that the terrorists had fired a total of 11 shots.Assaut de Saint-Denis : les terroristes n'ont tir√© que... 11 coups de feu [archive], Le Point, 1er f√©vrier 2016.

Their initial moniker was the Four Barrels, named after the type of carburetor, and their original membership consisted of Walter Buchanan (vocals), Justin Brown (lead guitar), Steve Wood (rhythm guitar, keyboards, and vocals), and Bill Looney (rhythm guitar, later bass), and Mark Porter (drums). By 1965 the band had changed their name to the Penthouse 5, an idea recommended by bassist Bill Looney, to imply that they were \\"top of the heap.\\" Their lead singer Water Buchanan departed, but Mark Porter introduced the band to Rob Graham, who replaced Walter on vocals. They played regular gigs at the Rocket Roller Rink, as well as teen clubs such as the Pit, the Studio Club, the 3 Thieves, the Panther Club, the Fantasmagoria, and Louann's, and won several battles of the bands including their first which as held at Broadway Skateland competing against local acts The Gentlemen and the Untouchables. After winning another contest they secured a spot on a local Channel 11 TV show, Hi-Ho-Shebang, in November 1965. The band played beyond the Dallas/Fort Worth area throughout Texas and Louisiana. Bass payer Bill Looney's father, an attorney, was the band's manager and would represent other Dallas area bands such as Kempy and the Guardians, as well as start Solar Records, the label for whom the group would record their first single, the Rob Graham-penned \\"Bad Girl\\" b/w \\"Don't Mess Around With My Dream,\\" written by fellow Dallas musician Ron Price. It was recorded at Sellers Studio and Summit Studio, produced by Edwin Greines. In late 1966, singer Rob Graham was fired by Looney's father the band's manager, a decision that drove Brown and Porter out of the band's lineup as well. They were replaced by Jon Williams (vocals, keyboards, harmonica), who had played with the By Fives and the WordD, Richard \\"Lurch\\" Keathley (lead guitar, vocals), who had also been a member of the WordD and Mike Echart (drums). The band shortened their name to the Penthouse, and recorded another half dozen records with producer Edward Greines for the Solar and Hawk labels. Their sound retained some of its prior Beatles' influence in songs such as \\"You're Gonna Make Me,\\" which was previously recorded by the WordD and released as a single on the Hawk label, backed with \\"Don't Mess Around with My Dream,\\" but became heavier and more serious. They also sometimes performed under the name Dr. William‚Äôs Soul Emporium as a soul group with a horn section consisting of Larry Hullett on trumpet and Scott Sanford on saxophone. Dale Hawkins, who had written \\"Suzie Q,\\" worked with them as the A&R; man during recording \\"Don't Mess Around.\\" In late 1967, the band broke up when Steve Wood moved to California, where he came to lead a band called the New Life, and later played with The Pointer Sisters and Kenny Loggins. The rest of the group's members ceased to be active in music. In the years since their breakup, the Penthouse 5's work has come to the attention of garage rock enthusiasts and collectors and has been included on several compilations such as The Penthouse 5 ‚Äì The WordD Is Love!, released on Collectibles Records, which includes all of their recorded work, along with that of fellow Dallas cohorts, the WordD, and Texas Punk 1966 Vol.4 - Dallas Psychedelic Gold From The 60's.

Unlike most major streets originating in Toronto and continuing into the \\"905\\" suburbs, only a short portion is located in Toronto and the street is strongly Mississauga- centric. Also, although Burnhamthorpe is commonly seen as the latter city's main east-west street, the parallel arteries of Dundas Street and Eglinton Avenue are (with the notable exception of the Mississauga City Centre area) busier and have heavier commercial uses along them overall. The north side of the right-of-way on the street's eastern half through Mississauga is unusually wide as the result of being reserved for a potential light rail transit line that was never built. The reserve was converted into a bicycle trail, with another transit facility (the Mississauga Transitway) being constructed farther north instead. In Mississauga, the street, unlike most other arterial roads in the regional municipalities surrounding Toronto proper, is not a regional road. However, in Oakville it is signed as Halton Regional Road 27 as far west as Neyagawa Boulevard. History Burnhamthorpe Road was originally laid out in 1806 as the first concession road north of Dundas Street in Toronto Township (now Mississauga). It is named after a former hamlet in Mississauga, which in turn was named by settler John Abelson for his hometown of Burnham Thorpe, England.http://heritagemississauga.com/page/Burnhamthorpe In Toronto, the road was a tolled plank road built in the 1840s running west from the former Village of Islington though Etobicoke Township and was referred to as Mono Sixth Line Road.http://365etobicoke.com/history-of- etobicoke/ It was informally also as the Back Line, Adamson Sideroad, and Rogers Road in Toronto Township west of the Credit River, and Back Concession Road in Halton County (present Region) until 1966.http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2497237/page/11?n= The \\"Back\\" in these earlier names referred to the practice of backing 200-acre (81 hectare) rectangular farm lots onto the road, while having their access fronting onto the adjacent Dundas Street and what is today Eglinton Avenue. Until the 1980s, the street was broken by the Credit River, when a high-level bridge was constructed across its deep and wide valley. Further west, to facilitate the crossing of the smaller Mullet Creek ravine by a new alignment, the street deviated southward from its original course, parts of which make up three residential streets; Fifeshire Court, Burbank Road, and Rogers Road (the latter being a historic name) today. Route description Burnhamthorpe begins at Dundas Street in the Islington neighborhood in Toronto's west end and heads west, crossing and interchanging with, Highway 427. At Renforth Creek there road was re-routed resulting in a stub to the north that runs as Old Burnhamthrope Road. After crossing the Etobicoke Creek, it enters Mississauga and is designated Burnhamthorpe Road East. At Hurontario Street, it passes by the iconic Absolute World condominium towers, enters Mississauga City Centre, and changes to a West designation. A linear park, lined with residential towers, runs along the south side of the street through here. Landmarks located in the City Centre on or near Burnhamthorpe include Square One Shopping Centre; the Living Arts Centre; and Mississauga Celebration Square; with the Mississauga Civic Centre situated just to the north. Continuing west past the city centre area, it traverses a mixed commercial and residential zone, before crossing over the wide Credit River valley on a high- level bridge, and entering the leafy Erin Mills district. Just west of Winston Churchill Boulevard, it narrows to two lanes, crosses over (but has no interchange with) Highway 403, enters rural northern Oakville, and after approximately another 8 kilometres (5 miles), breaks at Highway 407-ETR and the Sixteen Mile Creek. It resumes briefly west of the creek, and terminates at Tremaine Road. Its course is continued west by the Number 1 Side Road. Bus routing controversy Burnhamthorpe Road was a relatively minor artery through Toronto's west end until traffic increased due to the growth of Mississauga. Much of this new traffic consisted of a growing number of MiWay (then known as Mississauga Transit) city buses travelling to and from the Toronto Transit Commission's Islington subway station. By the late 1990s, the number of buses had gotten so high that residents with homes on the street began complaining, and demanded that the MiWay buses use Highway 427 and Dundas St. to access Islington station. They even occasionally blockaded buses in what became known as the Battle of the Buses. The councils of both cities got involved and the TTC eventually banned MiWay buses from using the bus bays at the subway station. But by 2001, the ruckus died down and MiWay's buses began fully using the station again.

It was formerly the Semaphore Institute, Semaphore Town Hall, Ozone Theatre and Semaphore Cinema. It was listed on the South Australian Heritage Register on 1 September 1983, and was also listed on the Register of the National Estate. It was built as the Semaphore Institute, an early mechanics institute, and opened on 15 March 1884. It was designed by architects Wright and Reed, and built by Williams & Cleave. It was a stone building with an iron roof, with a main hall and stage, entrance room, library and reading room on the ground floor, and offices for the local municipality, the Corporate Town of Semaphore, and a gallery on the second floor. In 1889, it was sold to the municipality to be used as the Semaphore Town Hall. The municipality merged with the adjacent Corporate Town of Port Adelaide in 1900, but it continued to be rented out for community events by the Port Adelaide council. From 1910, the hall was used as a temporary cinema by a number of organisers, while continuing to be used for other community functions. In 1929, Ozone Amusements leased the hall from the Corporate Town of Port Adelaide and converted the hall into a permanent cinema to a design by Chris A. Smith, adopting a range of Art Deco features. Smith was a prominent architect of the period, designing many theatres and cinemas, and a number of public buildings including a refurbishment of the Brighton Town Hall. The company later became Ozone Theatres, and would become one of the two major movie chains in South Australia. In 1951, Hoyts bought out the Ozone company, and in 1952 undertook a complete refurbishment of the Semaphore cinema, reopening on 20 November. However, box office takings suffered from the introduction of television, and Hoyts closed the cinema on 21 May 1960. The ground floor was used by the Semaphore Youth Club from 1966 to 1978, and in 1977 a smaller cinema, the Semaphore Cinema, was opened in what had been the upstairs dress circle by Alan and Fran Hall, operating until its closure in 1985. The building was vacant from 1985 to 1993, when the City of Port Adelaide restored the building as the Semaphore Library, which it has operated as ever since. The building remains substantially intact from its previous uses, and its state heritage listing notes that \\"enough interior elements of both periods [as a cinema] remain for it to be quite a significant representative of suburban cinemas in their heyday.\\" References Cinemas in South Australia Libraries in South Australia Town halls in South Australia Buildings and structures completed in 1884 Lefevre Peninsula South Australian Heritage Register South Australian places listed on the defunct Register of the National Estate ","title":"Semaphore Library"},{"id":"48593178","text":"The Ghost Goes Wild is a 1947 American comedy film directed by George Blair and written by Randall Faye.

Stocks later got a job in Birmingham, where she married Frederick Alfred Pickworth.Memoir: Jenny Pickworth Glusker. ACA History, American Crystallographic Association. Abgerufen am 11. August 2014. During her school years, Pickworth developed an early enthusiasm for chemistry, due largely to her chemistry teacher and her mother's textbooks. Her parents wanted her to study medicine. She agreed with her father that she would attend the Medical School of the University of Birmingham if she was rejected from Somerville College of the University of Oxford. She successfully completed her entrance exam in Oxford, receiving her bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1953 and later earning her doctorate under Dorothy Hodgkin. By the end of 1955, she was involved in the X-ray structural analysis of corrin ring from vitamin B12, for which Hodgkin was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Chemistry; Glusker earned her doctorate in 1957. During her undergraduate studies, she met the American chemist Donald L. Glusker, who had secured a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford. They married in 1955 in the United States and went together as post-doctoral researchers to Caltech, where Jenny Glusker worked in the laboratory of Linus Pauling. In 1956 she moved with her husband to Philadelphia where she became a research fellow and research associate with Arthur Lindo Patterson at the Institute for Cancer Research (ICR; now Fox Chase Cancer Center). She initially worked only part-time in order to raise her three children. After Patterson died in November 1966, Glusker eventually took over his lab and became a junior faculty member at the Institute for Cancer Research. She became a Member of the Institute for Cancer Research of the Fox Chase Cancer Center in 1977 (equivalent of associate professor) and a Senior Member (equivalent of full professor) in 1979, until her retirement in 2003. She remains a professor emerita of the Fox Chase Cancer Center.Curriculum Vitae: Jenny Pickworth Glusker. American Crystallographic Association. Abgerufen am 12. August 2014. At the ICR, Glusker initially examined the structure of small molecules of the citric acid cycle, in particular aconitase-catalyzed citrate, and its conformation as a ligand to iron atoms of the iron-sulfur cluster of aconitase, which led to a better understanding of the three-dimensional structure and mechanism of the enzymes (ferrous-wheel mechanism). Later her laboratory performed crystallographic analyses of anti-tumor agents and, amongst others, the structure and conformation of estramustine and acridine. They further tested carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as well as the structure of the enzyme xylose isomerase. In 1972 Glusker and structural biologist Helen M. Berman reported on the crystal structure of a nucleic acid-drug complex as a model for anti-tumor agent and mutagen action.

It lies on the Maniototo, a wide, high plain stretching from the end of the Strath-Taieri valley. Kyeburn stands at the junction of State Highways 85 (\\"The Pigroot\\") and 87, some east of Ranfurly, on the Kyeburn Stream, a minor tributary of the Taieri River.Wise's New Zealand guide (1969) Dunedin: H. Wise & Co. pp. 129‚Äì130. The stream's name, from which the settlement gets its name, is one of those within \\"Thomson's Barnyard\\", an area dotted with northern English farmyard animal names, all given by early Otago surveyor John Turnbull Thomson. The area was, in its early years of settlement, called Cows Creek. (\\"kye\\" is a Northumbrian term for cows).Reed, A.W. (1975) Place names of New Zealand. Wellington: A.H. & A.W. Reed. pp. 123 and 219 The area around Kyeburn was a busy mining location during the latter part of the Otago Gold Rush, with the mining settlement of Kyeburn Diggings (sometimes called Upper Kyeburn) located some 10 kilometres to the north of Kyeburn itself.  The Murder of Mary Young  Kyeburn would be flung into national and international infamy at the beginning of the 1880s when long-time resident Mary Young was murdered on 3 August 1880. This murder was shocking to many residents and garnered media attention during the trial that followed. Young died from the injuries that were inflicted on her with large stones from her garden before any definite culprit could be found. Because of this, the police struggled to find a motive, let alone the identity of the culprit. The only lead they had initially was discovered through talking to Young before she died, as she indicated that the person that attacked her was of Chinese origin. Because of the lack of evidence, a lengthy trial would find a Chinese man by the name of Ah Lee guilty. He was a miner who had only been in the area for a short period of time and was indicted based on largely circumstantial evidence. Although he was convicted and executed, a lot of people believed that Lee was not guilty, after many fallacies in the prosecution came to light, including the fact that the interpreter who the police used did not fully understand the type of Chinese. The interpreter was a Seyuip Cantonese and Lee of Panyu origin, resulting in about a 40% understanding between the two.

He is a supporter of the recovery of painting techniques from these periods and its learning and development in modern art in Mexico. The work of Virgilio Ruiz encompasses different thematic and technical periods, from portraits, landscapes (specially of Central Mexico high plateau and surroundings sceneries and Mexican coastlines) and allegorical, mythological and biblical themes and personages, using specially the tempera and oil techniques on canvas and wood in small and big formats. The approach of indirect painting and glaze techniques are extensively used to highlight the luminous content, deepness of planes and volume of the represented objects and figures, on one hand, and the emotional and expressive aspects of the characters and contexts thus depicted. The development of the oeuvre of Virgilio Ruiz Fern√°ndez has as common thrust the recovery of art as a spiritual activity aimed at representing and expressing nature and human life on the basis of the technical achievements of the classical painting, mainly in Europe (between the Renaissance and Romantic periods) and making the most of them for aesthetical purposes and subjective expression, as opposed to other ‚Äúmechanical‚Äù representative techniques such as the photography.  Biography  Virgilio Ruiz Fern√°ndez was born in Madrid and emigrated from Spain together with his family after the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936. The family settled down in Mexico City in 1941, where Ruiz Fern√°ndez attended university and developed his studies of painting and drawing techniques. The influence of exiled Spanish intellectuals and artists during the 1950s proved to be essential for his career, especially on the evocative aspect of it. He established further contact with representatives of the Mexican historicist schools of La Esmeralda and the Academy of San Carlos in Mexico City. In 1975 he opened his own academy, where students and professional painters alike learnt and refined their pictorial skills and techniques, especially tempera and oil. He lives in Mexico City.http://www.reocities.com/SoHo/Lofts/2652/VRUIZ.HTM  References  Spanish painters Mexican painters ","title":"Virgilio Ruiz Fernandez"},{"id":"48593255","text":"College of Professional Studies or School of Professional Studies may refer to: *George Washington University College of Professional Studies *New York University School of Professional Studies *Marquette University College of Professional Studies *CUNY School of Professional Studies *Goodwin College of Professional Studies *Metropolitan School of Professional Studies *Northwestern University School of Professional Studies *San Diego State University College of Professional Studies & Fine Arts *Saint Louis University School for Professional Studies See also *University of Professional Studies, Accra, Ghana *Master of Professional Studies *Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies ","title":"College of Professional Studies"},{"id":"48593270","text":"This is a list of electoral district results for the 1947 New South Wales state election.

It established for the first time the unified orthographic rules of the Albanian language which are still in use today. Background The efforts of establishing unified orthographic rules for the Albanian language had started in 1916 with the Literary Commission, in Shkod√´r, which aimed mainly in establishing a literary standard and established an \\"as phonetic as possible\\" approach of the future set of orthographic rules. After World War II, the differences and divergences between writing from within Albania and its adjacent Albanian populated regions were becoming visible. With the establishment of the University of Prishtina and the spread of Albanian literature in Yugoslavia, the unification of orthographic rules became crucial. Serious attempts were made in the '60s toward the standardization, starting with the publication Rregullat e drejtshkrimit t√´ shqipes (Rules of Albanian language orthography) by a joint project of the University of Tirana and the Institute of Linguistics and Literature led by Androkli Kostallari.Rregullat e drejtshkrimit t√´ shqipes : projekt A conference was held in Pristina in 1968, the Linguistic Conference of Pristina (Alb: Konsulta gjuh√´sore e Prishtin√´s), where the literary standard used so far in Albania and based in the Tosk Albanian dialect was adopted by the Albanians of Yugoslavia at the expense of the Gheg dialect. Event Photo from one of the sessions, November 1972 The congress took place in Tirana from 20 to 25 November 1972. Its moto was \\"One nation, one language\\". It was organized by the Institute of Linguistics and Literature (Instituti i gjuh√´sis√´) and the University of Tirana. 87 delegates from Albania, Yugoslavia, and Arb√´resh√´ participated. The congress issued a resolution which established the rules and principles of the standard Albanian orthography as developed up to that time. The conclusions of the congress were further elaborated by a post-deployment commission (Androkli Kostallari, Eqerem √áabej, Mahir Domi, Emil Lafe) which published and distributed the volumes Orthography of the Albanian language (Alb: Drejtshkrimi i gjuh√´s shqipe) of 1973WorldCat - Drejtshkrimi i gjuh√´s shqipe and Orthographic dictionary of the Albanian language (Alb: Fjalor drejtshkrimor i gjuh√´s shqipe) of 1976. The standard established by the congress is still in place today with very few changes by other recent Albanian language-related conferences. Notable participants The following list of notable participants were signatories of the decision adopted by the congress of the new orthographic standards: Importance The congress was a milestone event in the history of the Albanian language. The unification of orthography was crucial for the identity of the Albanian language. It was considered a big success the encompassing of the Yugoslavia-based literature and press under the umbrella of the linguistic authorities of Tirana, thus contributing in a stronger unified Albanian identity. Criticism Arshi Pipa, was one of the strongest critics of the time toward the congress and the rules that came out if it, due to the deprivation of Gheg element in favour of the Tosk one. Similar discussions continue as to date. In addition to the limitations induced by the young age of the academic institutions in the Albanian world, deep concerns were raised due to the delegate selection criteria in order to meet the communist political agenda, participation of simple elementary school teachers without any academic background, low number of academic titles of the delegates in overall, as well as non-specific Albanian language concentration of the ones that did have academic titles. Concretely, 72 out of 85 did not have a scientific degree, out of 15 others 5 of them had scientific degrees in other fields (not linguistics). Out of 5 linguists with scientific degrees, one was on Russian language (Kostallari). For the rest, over 2/3 of the delegates had the only foreign language the Russian language or the Serbo- Croatian one. 37 of the delegates did not make it to enter the Albanian Encyclopedic Dictionary (Alb: Fjalori Enciklopedik Shqiptar). Many other researchers and albanologists have reacted in favor of the congress's decisions, sending petitions to Prime Minister Edi Rama that the standard should not be revised. Kristo Frash√´ri, Albania's main personality in the field of history, rejected any criticism. According to Frash√´ri, \\"the language is not a monopoly of the linguists, it belongs to all those who speak the language, the standard has incorporated many aspects of the Gheg dialect as well, and that two orthography standards would lead to two separate nations, just like Croats and Serbs\\".

The position of these bands vary seasonally, moving north in the northern summer and south in the northern winter, and ultimately controlling the wet and dry seasons in the tropics.NWS JetStream ‚Äì Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone. Srh.noaa.gov (5 January 2010). Retrieved on 28 March 2013. These regions appear to have experienced strong warming, at a mean rate of 0.26 degrees Celsius per decade, which coincides with a global rise in temperature resulting from the anthropocentric inputs of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Studies have also found that precipitation has declined and tropical Asia has experienced an increase in dry season intensity whereas Amazonian has no significant pattern change in precipitation or dry season. Additionally, El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events drive the inter-annual climatic variability in temperature and precipitation and result in drought and increased intensity of the dry season. As anthropogenic warming increases the intensity and frequency of ENSO will increase, rendering tropical rainforest regions susceptible to stress and increased mortality of trees and other plants.

Structure As with tropical rainforests there are different canopy layers, but these may be less pronounced in mixed forests, which are often characterised by numerous lianas due to their growth advantage during the dry season.Ya-Jun Chen, Kun-Fang Cao, Stefan A.

It has many synonyms, including Ischnocolus jerusalemensis. Common names used include black furry, black tarantula and Middle East gold.  Range and habitat  The species is found in Cyprus, Turkey, Sudan, Egypt and the Middle East. It is very common inside homes in Israel.  Description  The body length is approximately 2.5 cm for adult males and 5 cm or larger for females. pp. 21‚Äì22 Until the discovery of the species Cerbalus aravaensis in the Sands of Samar it was considered the largest furry spider in Israel. The color varies between black, gray and brown dark; they tend to be paler in the cooler more forested regions of their range and darker in the southern more arid areas. The body is covered with tiny hairs and is shiny and velvety. There are variations in appearance and size throughout the range. Their food consists of insects and even small mice and young lizards. The species is sexually dimorphic: the female is larger than the male.  Behavior  Black furry, Jerusalem, 20151105 The species is active mainly at night. In the wild they can be found hiding under rocks or bark, but may reach human-occupied areas during migrations. When the spider feels threatened, it lifts its front torso, swinging its feet to expose a red stain on its mouth and claws. If the threat continues the spider will turn and look for a place to hide. C. olivaceum has been reported as living in large colonies and this has been observed in the burial caves around Jerusalem and reported from dried up wells in the Jordan Valley.  Relation to humans  This spider is not considered dangerous to humans and helps eliminating pests such as cockroaches. It is black, furry, fast and aggressive with respect to other types of tarantulas. Bites are unpleasant but mild. They are sometimes kept as pets. Predators In Israel two species of spider wasp, Hemipepsis brunnea and Pseudopompilus humboldti, have been recorded as predators on Chaetopelma olivaceum.

He built likewise five churches: La Natividad and La Visitaci√≥n, in Moratalaz; San Juan de √Åvila, in Usera; La Merced, in Los Pe√±ascales and Nuestra Se√±ora de la Pe√±a, in Vallecas. In parallel to such a number of projects and to the dedication to his numerous relatives and friends, Laorga was always committed to multiple social initiatives of diverse scales and in different fields. For example, father Llanos explains how Laorga took him to the Pozo del T√≠o Raimundo and built for him the first ‚Äòchabola‚Äô,shack,.LAMET, Pedro Miguel. ‚ÄúJos√© Mar√≠a de Llanos. Azul y rojo‚Äù Editorial La Esfera de los Libros. Madrid. 2013. During the 50s and 60s he developed many other works in the Pozo: classrooms, a school, a cinema or a nursery. In the 70s Laorga abandoned the big scale, with very few exceptions, and focused in single family houses, most of them for relatives or friends, until 1981, when a stroke resulted in a hemiplegia that made him quit architecture definitely. He displayed a very personal language in all his projects. He begins with total rationality in the disposition of uses and elements of the programme, and then, with constructive and structural rigour, employs a variety of materials and solutions. It is a sober but expressive, fresh and frugal way of doing architecture. Those are projects with a strong character, in which the different layers are articulated with each other with simplicity, from the adaptation to the place, scale and uses, to the comfort of the users. The rigour of calculating every detail and the greatest economy of means result, however, in comfortable and homely projects. This is so thanks, to a great extent, to how the materials and their disposition characterize the construction. Every project has a unique personality, even though they are developed with similar strategies and comparable programmes. All of them have been drawn with formal freedom, which presents itself, above all, in the details and the singular elements of the programme.

Known for his abstract, minimalist sculptures, he uses black granite and basalt as his main mediums of expression. His primary themes explore the tension between movement and stillness as well as the timeless potential of art. Early life and education Agop was born Armen Guerboyan to Armenian parents living in Cairo, Egypt. Raised between these two cultures with ancient roots, Agop was drawn to the endurance of historical art and artifacts, and he was also affected by the dry landscape of Egypt, saying, \\"It was in the desert, where there seems to be nothing, that's where I learned to see\\". By the age of 13 Agop was a student of Simon Shahrigian. He finished the Faculty of the Fine Arts at Helwan University in Cairo. After graduating, he received an assistant researcher scholarship. Career In 2000, Agop was awarded the Prix de Rome, the State Prize of Artistic Creativity in Egypt. After staying in Rome the first year on sponsorship, he moved to Pietrasanta, Italy where he continues to live and work today. In 2013, he was awarded the Premio Sulmona, Rassegna Internazionale D‚ÄôArte Contemporanea, Presidential Medal of the Italian Republic. His works are represented in the Egyptian Modern Art Museum, Egypt, Villa Empain/Boghossian Foundation in Belgium, Giardino di Piazza Stazione in Barge, Italy, and Coral Springs Museum of Art in Florida, USA. Agop is known for an ascetic approach to abstract sculpture, mainly using black granite and basalt. In his own words on minimalism, \\"Simplicity is very complicated\\". Agop's work has also often been described as \\"Contrasting Art\\" where the contemporary and the ancient meet; his artistic presence springs from his cross-cultural philosophy. \\"The ancient and the contemporary may seem very different, but I think the essentials are the same\\", he said in Art Plural: Voices of Contemporary Art (2014).  Touch  The Touch series consists of sculptures that are activated by the viewer's touch, causing them to rock or sway. Agop invites the viewer to move beyond visual observation into physical interaction, rejecting the sacredness of art.  Sufic  The title of this series refers to Sufism, a simple life of prayer, reflecting Agop's own meditative process. In pursuit of one central form that balances stillness and movement, Agop also sculpted these works to sway at a slight touch, yet appear solid and unmoving.  Transcontemporary  In 2015, Agop used the term \\"Transcontemporary\\" to describe the tension between past and future in art that is referred to today as contemporary.[] \\"Contemporary\\" is an ever- changing term, as what is now considered ancient was once contemporary. So, Agop mixes the 'ancient' with the 'contemporary' by sculpting durable stone without obvious references to modern times, creating an ultimate work that rejects categorization.

Palaeoarctic Siberian Asia Expeditions Following assignment by Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve as a field expedition astronomer (1849-1853) to study the Amur River, astronomer Schwarz led (1854-1862) the East Siberian Expedition of 1855 which extensively explored unknown and unmapped territory in Eastern Siberia, such as the Turan Range.Kropotkin, p. 563. The Siberian expedition went into central Asia, southeastern Asia, and northern China. Some of the routes travelled were as long as 10,000 miles. Utilizing his prior Amur field knowledge of astronomy he would determine geographical positions of certain points (geodesy) for preparation of geographical maps. The information would later be used in planning the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway systems and others in southeast Asia. The volumes reporting the results of the expedition were published in 1864. The separate tomes concerning the vegetation and wildlife reports were prepared by the expedition's botanist and zoologist Gustav Radde.

It was built in two phases by SunPower using its Oasis Power Plant system. The project is co-located with several other large solar power projects in the Eldorado Valley. Facility details The 100 MW Boulder Solar 1 began construction on 600 acres in December 2015, and went online in mid-December 2016. It uses 288,000 tracker-mounted panels manufactured by SunPower. It has an expected annual production of about 280 GWh and will provide Boulder City with $20 million in land lease payments over the 20-year term. Southern Power purchased a controlling (51%) interest in Boulder Solar 1 in November 2016. New Energy Solar purchased the remaining 49% interest in February 2018. The electricity is being sold to NV Energy under a 20-year power purchase agreement. Along with geothermal power and numerous smaller solar energy installations throughout the city, Boulder Solar 1 allowed Las Vegas to operate all municipal services with renewable energy sources starting at the end of 2016. The 50 MW Boulder Solar 2, also constructed by SunPower, entered service in January 2017 with an expected annual production of 140 GWh. It is owned by American Electric Power and is also selling its electricity to NV Energy.

The Telegraph. 23 July 2015. is an Indian political strategist and politician. He joined Janata Dal (United) in September 2018. He was expelled from the party on 29 January 2020 for criticizing party head, Nitish Kumar's, supportive stand on Citizenship Amendment Act (2019). Initially trained in public health, Kishor has worked for the United Nations for eight years before entering into Indian politics. Kishor has worked as an election strategist for BJP, INC, AAP, AITC and DMK. His first major political campaign was in 2011 to help Narendra Modi, then Chief Minister of Gujarat get re-elected to the CM Office for a third time in the Gujarat Assembly Elections 2012. However, he came to wider public attention when Citizens for Accountable Governance (CAG), an election-campaign group he conceptualised, helped the Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) win an absolute majority in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. In a 2018 interview, Karan Thapar recalled having been told by Pawan Verma that Kishor had shown Modi his famous broken off interview with Karan Thapar 30 times, to train him on how to answer difficult questions. Personal life and career Kishor belongs to Konar village of Rohtas district but his father Shrikant Pandey, a doctor, shifted to Buxar in Bihar. There, Kishor completed his secondary education. Reportedly working pro bono, and without holding any office in the BJP or Gujarat Government, Kishor became one of the major strategists in the BJP's pre-election campaign. He joined Janata Dal (United) political party on 16 September 2018. CAG and the 2014 general- election campaign In 2013, Kishor created Citizens for Accountable Governance (CAG), a media and publicity company in preparation for the May 2014 general election of India. Kishor was credited with formulating an innovative marketing & advertising campaign for Narendra Modi‚Äî the Chai pe Charcha discussions, 3D rallies, Run for Unity, Manthan and social media programmes. Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, author of 'Narendra Modi: The Man, The Times' said Kishor was one of the most important people in Modi's team driving strategies for months before 2014 elections. Kishor parted ways with Modi, converted the (CAG) into a specialist policy outfit, Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC). I-PAC and the 2015 Bihar Assembly election campaign In 2015, Kishor and other CAG members regrouped as I-PAC to work with Nitish Kumar, in a bid to win a third term as Chief Minister of Bihar in Assembly Elections. The claims were that Kishor dramatically influenced the strategy, resources and alliances for the campaign. I-PAC, named after the US based lobbying groups which are designated as PAC designed a cycle carrying the message of the CM's seven commitments, with the slogan ‚ÄúNitish ke Nishchay: vikas ki guarantee\\" (Nitish's vow: development guaranteed). Upon winning the Bihar elections, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar named Kishor as his advisor for planning and programme implementation, with a brief look for ways to implement the seven-point agenda that was promised during Kumar's election campaign.  Punjab Assembly Election 2017  In 2016 Kishor was hired by the Congress for Punjab Assembly Elections due in 2017 to help Amarinder Singh's campaign in Punjab after losing two consecutive Assembly elections for the Congress. This win in Punjab has been credited by TV channels like Zee News to Kishor and his team. Several Congress leaders like Randeep Surjewala and Shankersinh Vaghela came on record to openly credit Kishor with the win. Singh tweeted, \\"As I have said many times before, PK & his team and their work was absolutely critical to our victory in Punjab!\\".  Uttar Pradesh Assembly Election 2017  In 2016 Congress employed Kishor for the 2017 UP Elections. However, these elections were a failure for the Congress and Kishor as BJP won more than 300+ seats and Congress could only manage 7 seats. Kishor‚Äôs decision to side with the Congress in UP was deemed ill-advised by analysts and politicians alike for the party had been out of power in the state for 27 years. It was alleged that Kishor faced difficulty in getting his ideas and suggestions implemented and him and his organisation, at best, were supporting the campaign from the sidelines. Sankarshan Thakur in the Telegraph said, ‚ÄúIt was never the party, mind you, that wooed, or even wanted, Kishor; it was always the party‚Äôs first family. And that might be central to why the going for Kishor has been so uncertain, unproductive, unnerving.\\" Andhra Pradesh Assembly Elections 2019 Kishor was appointed as political advisor to Y. S.

Spurling is the wife of a descendant of Fettiplace who had inherited the manuscript. The book provides a direct view of Elizabethan era cookery in an aristocratic country house, with Fettiplace's notes on household management. The book was well received by critics as revealing previously unknown aspects of Elizabethan household life. Spurling was praised for testing the recipes, a challenging task. The historian Elaine Leong cautioned that the homely title could obscure the complex history of the text's authorship and ownership. Context The Fettiplaces were an aristocratic English family of Norman descent, who lived in Berkshire and Oxfordshire. Elinor (n√©e Poole) was the wife of Sir Richard Fettiplace, who lived at Appleton Manor in what is now Oxfordshire (formerly in Berkshire). Born in around 1570 in Gloucestershire, she married Sir Richard in 1589 at the age of 19, and became part of an ancient land owning family that had acquired large debts and mortgages, having originally become wealthy from wool. The 'Book of Receipts', dated 1604, contained a relatively small collection of recipes that she had collected and annotated over the years. Her choice of subjects illustrates both her interests and needs, such as to preserve fruit, and her relationships with other women of her standing. Some of the recipes show the influence of Jean Li√©bault's La Maison Rustique, which was translated into English in 1616. Fettiplace's manuscript is written in \\"fine, clear, cranky Shakespearean English\\". Many corrections are visible in the manuscript, from simple proof-reading to the addition of ingredients, changes to quantifies and preparation times, and alternative methods. The tone is practical and down-to-earth. Apart from Elinor's recipes, the book contains marginal notes, and additional recipes by up to eight different hands, indicating that it grew over more than one lifetime. Its plain appearance without decoration is typical of private works of the period, and is in marked contrast to professionally-produced books. Such books functioned as receptacles \\"for personal creativity and ingenuity... ...and a legacy for female inheritance\\". In 1647 Elinor left the manuscript to her niece, Anne Horner, \\"desyring her to kepe it for my sake\\". More recipes were added later in that century. The book then passed down in the family until it reached Hilary Spurling's husband. The manuscript was not published in Fettiplace's time. It remained a private working document, not intended for readers outside her family. The book was passed on to other women in the family, who would have copied it for their own use, and added other recipes that they liked, as was customary. Such personal preference leads to what Spurling calls \\"curious omissions\\": no pork, ham, or bacon dishes except broth for a person with consumption; no duck, goose, or venison; no carrot or parsnip, \\"and only one mention of onion\\", for stewed oysters. The manuscript was originally copied out from Fettiplace's notes by Anthony Bridges. The recipes, by Fettiplace and others, were in no special order until Spurling arranged them for publication. The manuscript was not illustrated. However it was made to look elegant, being copied out in a careful handwriting on high-quality paper and bound in leather covers. The front cover is embossed in gold with the Poole family's coat of arms. The endpapers are made from fragments of medieval manuscripts written by monks. The social historian Janet Theophano suggests that Fettiplace began the collection at her mother's request, writing that she \\"most probably began recording recipes for sweetmeats and preserves under her mother's supervision. At the time of her marriage and her move to Appleton Manor‚Ä¶ she brought with her some sort of receipt book.\\" Editing and commentary The introduction in the book includes an historical account of the Poole family, the Fettiplace family and Elizabethan life and times. The main text of the book is structured into 12 chapters, each one devoted to a month of the year. In all, the book contains over 200 recipes, largely as originally written, and commented and interpreted in detail by Hilary Spurling. Each recipe is presented first in Fettiplace's text, under its original heading. This is immediately followed by an account of the recipe by Spurling, with quantities mentioned as the need for them arises, rather than being listed separately. She then discusses the recipe, sometimes comparing suggestions made by contemporary cooks like Gervase Markham (author of The English Huswife), indicating similar dishes, and situating the recipe in the tradition of English cuisine. Spurling describes the text as being clear and simple: to preserve the Elizabethan feeling of the recipes, she limits her interventions to making the minimum of corrections necessary to avoid confusion. She notes that some terms in Elizabethan usage do not have their modern meanings; the term boyle means to simmer (gently) rather to boil vigorously. She leaves the spellings almost entirely in their original form, testing and annotating the recipes to enable readers to understand and cook from them. Publication The book was published in 1986 by The Salamander Press in association with Penguin Books. It was then published in paperback by Penguin in 1987.Fettiplace, Elinor (1987) Elinor Fettiplace's Receipt Book; [ed. by] H. Spurling. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books; p. iv The book includes an image of one page of the manuscript. The compilation gives a detailed view of Elizabethan era cookery and domestic life in an aristocratic country household. Editions include: * Elisabeth Sifton Books, Viking, London and New York, 1986. * Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, 1987. * Faber and Faber, London, 2008. Recipes Elinor Fettiplace provides recipes for various forms of bread, such as buttered loaves; for apple fritters; preserves and pickles; and a celebration cake for 100 people. New ingredients such as the sweet potato, which had arrived from the New World, feature in the book. The following recipe for dressing a shoulder of mutton calls for the use of the newly-available citrus fruits: it also illustrates the nature of Fettiplace's spellings and her individual style of writing: Fettiplace included a recipe for \\"White Bisket Bread\\", nowadays called meringue, using one and a half pounds of sugar, a handful of flour, and twelve beaten eggwhites. The recipe is older than Fran√ßois Massialot's 1692 work Nouvelle instruction pour les confitures where meringues first appear in French cuisine. Critical reception Paula Deitz, writing in The New York Times, quotes Spurling's claim that the book describes \\"many aspects of Elizabethan household life about which historians had no knowledge\\". The Oxford historian A. L. Rowse described the book as \\"a fascinating find\\", and wrote that it deserved \\"to taste of the Victorian Mrs. Beetons success as a best seller\\". The novelist Lawrence Norfolk, writing in The Guardian, described the book as containing \\"recipes, remedies and preserving methods ... gathered over many years, almost like annotations in a family Bible\\". He praises Hilary Spurling for testing the recipes, \\"a heroic undertaking in a modern kitchen\\", only baulking at testing Sir Walter Raleigh's \\"Syrup of Tobacco\\" which was then widely grown in the West of England. He mentions especially \\"delicate cat's tongue biscuits\\", light sauces, and \\"liaisons whisked up\\" and describes Fettiplace's recipes as \\"a sophisticated cuisine but presented as typical of the time.\\" The historian Elaine Leong describes the effect of the modern title of this and similar books such as \\"Lady Sedley's Receipt Book\\" and \\"Ladie Borlase's Receiptes Booke\\" as \\"conjuring up a homey picture of the lady of the manor collecting all sorts of household information as part of her housewifely duties\\". Leong cautions that while the modern editors of these books \\"no doubt based their titles on ownership notes inscribed in the manuscripts ... these titles obscure the rich and complex stories of authorship and ownership connected with the texts.\\" NotesReferencesSources  1986 non-fiction books Elizabethan era History of English cuisine ","title":"Elinor Fettiplace's Receipt Book"},{"id":"48593963","text":"Achampet or Achampeta or Atchampeta may refer to: *Achampet, Nagarkurnool district, a village in Telangana, India **Achampet (SC) (Assembly constituency), a SC (Scheduled Caste) reserved constituency of the Telangana Legislative Assembly *Atchampet, Andhra Pradesh, a village in Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh, India *Atchampeta, Prakasam district, a village in Racherla mandal, Prakasam district, Andhra Pradesh, India *Atchampet mandal, Guntur district a mandal in Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh, India *Achampet, Nizamabad district, a village in Nizamsagar mandal of Nizamabad district, India ","title":"Achampet"},{"id":"48593969","text":"P'ukru (Quechua for hole, pit, gap in a surface, hispanicized spelling Pucro, erroneously also spelled Pusro) is a mountain in the Andes of Peru, about high.

Overview  Common cowslip (Primula veris) is a frequent plant species in European grasslands. If the environmental conditions are suitable, but the cowslip is missing from studied grassland patch, it belongs to the dark diversity for given grassland. Dark diversity is part of the species pool concept. A species pool is defined as set of all species that are able to inhabit particular site and that are present in the surrounding region or landscape. Dark diversity comprises species that belong to a particular species pool but that are not currently present at a site. Dark diversity is related to \\"habitat-specific\\" or \\"filtered\\" species pool which only includes species that can both disperse to and potentially inhabit the study site. For example, if fish diversity in a coral reef site has been sampled, dark diversity includes all fish species from the surrounding region that are currently absent but can potentially disperse to and colonize the study site. Because all sampling will also miss some species actually present at a site, we also have the related idea of 'phantom species' -- those species present at a site but not detected within the sampling units used to sample the community at that site. The existence of these phantom species means that routine measures of colonization and extinction at a site will always overestimate true rates because of \\"pseudo-turnover.\\" Dark diversity name is borrowed from dark matter: matter which cannot be seen and directly measured, but its existence and properties are inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter. Similarly, dark diversity cannot be seen directly when only the sample is observed, but it is present if broader scale is considered, and its existence and properties can be estimated when proper data is available. With dark matter we can better understand distribution and dynamics of galaxies, with dark diversity we can understand composition and dynamics of ecological communities.  Habitat specificity and scale  Dark diversity is the counterpart of observed diversity (alpha diversity) present in a sample. Dark diversity is habitat-specific in respect that the study site must contain favorable ecological conditions for species belonging to dark diversity. The habitat concept can be narrower (e.g. microhabitat in an old-growth forest) or broader (e.g. terrestrial habitat). Thus, habitat specificity does not mean that all species in dark diversity can inhabit all localities within study sample, but there must be ecologically suitable parts. Habitat-specificity is making the distinction between dark diversity and beta diversity. If beta diversity is the association between alpha and gamma diversity, dark diversity connects alpha diversity and habitat-specific (filtered) species pool. Habitat-specific species pool only these which can potentially inhabit focal study site. Observed diversity can be studied at any scale, and sites with varying heterogeneity. This is also true for dark diversity. Consequently, as local observed diversity can be linked to very different sample sizes, dark diversity can be applied at any study scale (1x1 m sample in a vegetation, bird count transect in a landscape, 50x50 km UTM grid cell).  Methods to estimate dark diversity  Region size determines likelihood of dispersal to study site and selecting appropriate scale depends on research question. For a more general study, a scale comparable to biogeographic region can be used (e.g. a small country, a state, or radius of few hundred km). If we want to know which species potentially can inhabit study site in the near future (for example 10 years), landscape scale is appropriate. To separate ecologically suitable species, different methods can be used. Environmental niche modelling can be applied for a large number of species. Expert opinion can be used. Data on species' habitat preferences is available in books, e.g. bird nesting habitats. This can also be quantitative, for example plant species indicator values, according to Ellenberg. A recently developed method estimates dark diversity from species co-occurrence matrices. An online tool is available for the co-occurrence method.  Usage  Dark diversity allows meaningful comparisons of biodiversity. The community completeness index can be used: :\\\\log({observed diversity} / {dark diversity}). This express the local diversity at the relative scale, filtering out the effect of regional species pool. For example, if completeness of plant diversity was studied at the European scale, it did not exhibit the latitudinal pattern seen with observed richness and species pool values. Instead, high completeness was characteristic to regions with lower human impact, indicating that anthropogenic factors are among the most important local scale biodiversity determinants in Europe. Dark diversity studies can be combined with functional ecology to understand why species pool is poorly realized in a locality. For example, if functional traits were compared between grassland species in observed diversity and dark diversity, it becomes evident, that dark diversity species have in general poorer dispersal abilities. Dark diversity can be useful in prioritizing nature conservation, to identify in different regions most complete sites. Dark diversity helps to estimate the relative loss of local diversity, but also restoration progress. Dark diversity of alien species, weeds and pathogens can be useful to prepare for future invasions in time. Recently, dark diversity concept was used in to explain mechanisms behind plant diversity-productivity relationship.

After the end of the war, it was converted back into an airborne corps. The corps served at Tula until its 1955 disbandment when the Soviet airborne was reorganized.  History = World War II  The 38th Guards Airborne Corps was formed around 9 August 1944 under the command of Alexander Kapitokhin, part of the Separate Airborne Army. The corps included the 11th, 12th, and 16th Guards Airborne Divisions. On 8 December, the corps became a rifle corps and its divisions were soon converted into infantry divisions. At the same time, the Separate Airborne Army became the 9th Guards Army.Soviet troops during the Vienna Offensive In January 1945, the corps transferred to Hungary with the rest of the 9th Guards Army. The corps first fought in combat on 21 February. On 26 March, Kapitokhin was replaced by Alexander Utvenko in command. It fought during the Vienna Offensive, where its 104th Guards Rifle Division captured Sankt P√∂lten. Its 105th Guards Rifle Division blocked the Vienna-Linz road. For its actions in the Vienna Offensive, the corps was awarded the honorary title \\"Vienna\\". Advancing on the right flank of the 37th Guards Rifle Corps, the corps entered Czechoslovakia and fought in the Prague Offensive, where the 106th Guards Rifle Division captured Znojmo.  Postwar  The corps briefly became part of the Central Group of Forces before it was relocated to Ivanovo in the Moscow Military District in the summer of 1945. The 104th Division was based at Kostroma, and the 105th and 106th were at Teykovo. On 10 June, the corps was converted back into an airborne corps along with the rest of the corps of the 9th Guards Army, which became the headquarters of the Soviet airborne. Its divisions also became airborne divisions. The 689th Separate Communications Battalion was directly subordinated to corps headquarters around this time. The 104th Guards were transferred to the 15th Guards Airborne Corps in Estonia, and the 105th and 106th Divisions moved to Kostroma and Tula, respectively. The corps headquarters was moved to Tula. In July, Lieutenant General Stepan Povetkin became commander of the corps. Lieutenant General Erofey Dobrovolsky took command in August. He would command the corps for the rest of its existence. On 15 October 1948, the 11th Guards Airborne Division was activated from a regiment of the 106th Guards Airborne Division at Ryazan to form a third division in the corps. On 25 April 1955, as part of the reorganization of the Soviet airborne, the corps and its 11th Guards Airborne Division were disbanded. The 105th and 106th Divisions were directly subordinated to the headquarters of the Soviet airborne.

Chen supported Wang Ming and Bo Gu in purging key founders of the Red Forth Army, such as Xu Jishen, Zhou Weijiong and others. In 1935, Chen was tasked to lead the Red Fourth Army on the Long March, and was to rendezvous in July at Xiaojin County, Sichuan. At the rendezvous with Mao Zedong Red First Army, the Fourth Army had far superior personnel numbers in the scale of eight to one. He entered the Politburo for a short period of time in August, but under the orders of Zhang Guotao to divert away from the route of the march, he led the Red Fourth Army and the Red Thirteenth Army Southwards. Due to setbacks in the Xikang region, Chen and Zhang went into conflict with each other. In July 1936, Chen urged Zhang to pursue a northern route, influenced by Zhu De, Liu Bocheng and Xu Xiangqian, and by October Chen's force rendezvoused with the main CCP force in Huining, Gansu.

He made a successful request to be sent to USSR for \\"medical treatment\\" in August 1939. He was involved in the Battle of Moscow against Hitler's forces in 1941 and contributed to the city's rebuilding. From 1943 to 1952, Chen translated and edited works such as The Collected Works of Lenin and The Russo-Chinese Dictionary which became the de facto textbook for all Chinese students who were studying the Russian language. In 1952 Chen returned to mainland China and was appointed deputy dean of the Central Institute of Marxism-Leninism. In 1953 he became the vice director of the Compilation and Translation Bureau.

Space agencies=NASA Buzz Aldrin training at the McDonogh School for his Gemini 12 spacewalk Prior to May 1960, NASA recognized the possibility of underwater neutral buoyancy simulations, and began testing their efficacy. NASA engaged Environmental Research Associates, a company based in Baltimore, to try neutral buoyancy simulations first in a pool near Langley Research Center. Visitors and other issues disturbed those efforts, so they moved the operation to a swimming pool at the McDonogh School in Maryland, where Scott Carpenter was the first astronaut to participate suited. Then, after difficult EVAs through Gemini 11 in mid-September 1966, the Manned Spacecraft Center (later renamed the Johnson Space Center) fully understood the importance of testing procedures underwater, and sent the Gemini 12 crew to train at McDonogh.Levine, Raphael B.: Null-Gravity Simulation.

Roscosmos Following the Voskhod 2 mission, a group at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC) proposed training for EVAs in a pool. In September 1969, GCTC created a working group to further study the idea, and some experiments were performed in their swimming pool near the end of that year. In 1970, cosmonauts Andriyan Nikolayev and Vitaly Sevastyanov visited NASA's new -diameter pool at Marshall. Sevastyanov was even allowed to don a training suit and enter the pool.

It was built in 1992, and is the only neutral buoyancy facility on a college campus. The NBRF is part of the Space Systems Laboratory (SSL) which was originally located at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It split from MIT when the SSL was awarded a grant from NASA to build a dedicated neutral buoyancy pool. Since there was not enough space at MIT for the pool, it was decided to move the SSL to the University of Maryland. The Underwater Astronaut Trainer (UAT) is located at the United States Space and Rocket Center, home of Space Camp and Space Academy, in Huntsville, AL. 30 feet wide and 24 feet deep, it was designed by Homer Hickam, a NASA engineer famous for writing Rocket Boys adapted into the film October Sky. Opened in 1986, it is still active. Neutral-buoyancy training During training exercises, neutral-buoyancy diving is used to simulate the weightlessness of space travel. To achieve this effect, suited astronauts or pieces of equipment are lowered into the pool using an overhead crane and then weighted in the water by support divers so that they experience minimal buoyant force and minimal rotational moment about their center of mass. The suits worn by trainees in the NBL are down-rated from fully flight-rated EMU suits like those in use on the Space Shuttle and International Space Station. Divers breathe nitrox while working in the tank. Training challenges One disadvantage of neutral- buoyancy diving as a simulation of microgravity is the significant amount of drag created by the water. This makes it difficult to set an object in motion, and difficult to keep it in motion. It also makes it easier to keep the object stationary. This effect is the opposite of what is experienced in space, where it is easy to set an object in motion, but very difficult to keep it still. Generally, drag effects are minimized by doing tasks slowly in the water. Another downside of neutral buoyancy simulation is that astronauts are not weightless within their suits, meaning that as divers tilt their suits they are pressed against whatever inside surface is facing down. This can be uncomfortable in certain orientations, such as heads-down. Thus, precise suit sizing is critical.

History The complex is located in Pobbia, once included in the municipality of Moncucco. Pobbia, dates back to 1457, as a farm named Pobia. In 1459, nobleman Francesco Pestagalli, owner of Cascina Pobia, was given a privilege of tax exemption for the farm by the Duchess Bianca Maria Visconti. The mansion, owned by Pestagalli, was built in Pobbia in the first half of the eighteenth century. In the nineteenth century, Pestagalli took over Della Somaglia's finances, and since 1890 the villa became the property of the Balconi family, who still owned the property by the end of the twentieth century. Balconi then commissioned a substantial restoration, with the addition of habitable floors, balconies and dormers. Until the eighties, the house counted with a chapel open to the public, built in 1681 by Anna Crespi Recalcati as help for people with children. It is now in ruins. Architecture Villa Somaglia remains The mansion, with an L-shaped floor plan, was built in the first half of the eighteenth century. Inside, on its larger side, there is a triple portico that leads into the central hall. A staircase leads to the \\"noble\\" floor. Of its Italian garden, which has been much reduced, few traces are visible. Today, crossing Via Marsala one can find the remains of previous constructions, including a long building with two chatelaine-shaped angular towers which are slightly higher than the main building, formerly used as private residences.

Mink'a, Minka, Minga (from Quechua minccacuni, meaning \\"asking for help by promising something\\") also mingaco or Spanish faena, is an Inca tradition of community work/voluntary collective labor for purposes of social utility and community infrastructure projects. It is practiced in several Latin American countries. Mink'a can adopt different ways of expressing community, such as the construction of public buildings and infrastructure, or benefit a person or family, such as needing help when harvesting potatoes or other agricultural products. Usually, the mink'a labor is without salary, such as in the public works projects of Ocra, a campesino community in the Andes. Faenas are seen as a labor tribute to the community or a cash-free form of local taxation. Mink'a is mainly practiced in Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay.  Peru  In Peru, the concept of mink'a is associated with pre-Columbian indigenous cultures. It is practiced in mestizo and campesino communities of the Andes, where the notion of reciprocity (ayni) organizes community work. An example of this type of reciprocity is the development of agricultural activities among a dozen neighbors in traditional productive units, or the building of a community kitchen with personal tools and local materials. During the Inca Empire, mink'a was the basic way in which work was carried out within communities (ayllu) and was also practiced for the benefit of larger territories (mit'a), as part of the services that each ayllu provided to the whole of the society. The families participated in the construction of premises, irrigation canals, as well as helped in the farm operations of the disabled, and cared for orphans and the elderly. Due to the great migration to the cities of the Peruvian coast, mink'a became widespread in the coastal areas of Peru - mostly however within smaller communities where local \\"taxation\\" consisting of labor is more feasible than a monetary tax to realize community projects.

Soldier Wolf's great-grandmother was war chief Pretty Nose who participated in the Battle of Little Big Horn in 1876. In his youth, Soldier Wolf was forced to attend American Indian boarding schools. He stated that the memories of the boarding schools were \\"bad memories, dark stories. They didn't teach us, they trained us. They didn't teach us, they just kept us in line.\\" Years later, he was part of a tribal delegation that participated in the repatriation of the remains of three Native American children who had died at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School. Soldier Wolf was drafted in to the US Marine Corps in 1948. An accident in the Korean War ruptured his eardrum and he was discharged in 1952. Soldier Wolf returned to Wind River where he worked with horses and sheepherding and married Florita, daughter of Richard Brown. Before the Northern Arapaho Tribe had an official historic preservation officer, Soldier Wolf acted as an informal historian for the group, assisted by his daughter Yufna who would later become the director of the Northern Arapaho Tribal Historic Preservation Office. Soldier Wolf provides Arapaho names for people, including all of his grandchildren, which are revealed during the official naming ceremonies. In the documentary Wolf Nation produced by Victoria Costello, Soldier Wolf led the Arapaho members in a traditional wolf dance to welcome the return of wolves to Yellowstone National Park. Soldier Wolf explains the significance of the wolf to Native American cultures in the 2003 documentary Wolf: An Ancient Spirit Returns. He was also a performer in the documentary Celebration! : the Plains Indian Museum powwow.

Plot The story takes place in winter, during World War II, at an isolated, snowed-in area. This area is occupied by Germany but contested by partisans who have Russian backing. One of the local partisans is Anja Kovach (Nicoletta Machiavelli). Her entire family was executed in retaliation for the death of a single German. She survived and, eventually, joined the partisans. She has become renowned as a sniper. She has killed almost half the local German garrison. The German troops live in fear of her. Sergeant Stephen Holmann (David McCallum) is an expert sniper in the German army. Before the war, he worked as a teacher. He attended the 1936 Olympics, an expert in marksmanship and a hunter. He gets reassigned from North Africa, and parachuted into the area, for a special assignment: to capture Anja. He must not kill her, lest she become a martyr. For several days, Stephen and Anja stalk each other through snow and woods. Eventually, Stephen wins: he manages to capture Anja, whilst she is occupied with signalling a Russian supply plane. Simultaneously, a fierce battle erupts between Germans and partisans. The battle moves away, leaving Stephen and Anja alone, without supplies, and surrounded by dead bodies. Stephen, with Anja his captive, is forced to find shelter and food, in hopes that the German forces will prevail and return. As days pass, Stephen and Anja's relationship evolves from adversarial to cooperative. They become lovers. Subsequently, the battle returns to the area. Amidst flying bullets, Stephen returns Anja's rifle to her. They go in opposite directions but a German soldier spots Anja and kills her. Stephen sees this, and kills the soldier. A Russian soldier sees Stephen heading toward Anja and assumes he has shot her, and in retaliation, kills Stephen.

She founded the company von Hoerner & Sulger which produces scientific instruments, notably cosmic dust analyzers used on space missions by European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA. Early life  Hanna von Hoerner was born in G√∂rlitz in 1942. Her father was the astrophysicist Sebastian von Hoerner. With his help and encouragement she repaired radios when she was six and built an oscilloscope at the age of fourteen. In the early 1960s, after finishing her Abitur, (high school or secondary school,) her father moved to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in the US. Von Hoerner completed an electronics education in the United States and worked as a research assistant at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.  Education  In 1965, von Hoerner returned to Germany to study experimental physics at Heidelberg University. In 1971 she earned an undergraduate degree and in 1974 her PhD, both at Heidelberg University.  Career  COSIMA Staubspektrometer - COSIMA dust spectrometer (14237329074) Von Hoerner, in 1973 while still working on her PhD, founded the company von Hoerner & Sulger. Based in Schwetzingen and produces scientific instruments for use in space and medicine.In 1980 von Hoerner & Sulger developed the first mass spectrometer that worked in space In 1979 van Hoerner's company was commissioned by the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research to design a cosmic dust detector for use in the Vega program missions to Venus. In 1999 Von Hoerner & Sulger designed CIDA (Cometary and Interstellar Dust Analyzer), a dust analysis instrument on board the NASA spacecraft Stardust, which launched in 1999. The company is famous for the design of COSIMA (Cometary Secondary Ion Mass Analyser), an instrument on board the Rosetta spacecraft that analyses the composition of dust particles using secondary ion mass spectrometry. Early data included images of dust particles collected in the environment of Comet 67P/C-G from the nucleus approach phase until along with secondary ion mass spectra for some of those particles.

Braunschweig) http://www.uni-magdeburg.de/mbl/Biografien/0416.htm was a German mineralogist and geologist, and came from the aristocratic family of Veltheim. He was known as August Ferdinand Graf von Veltheim from 1798 after acquiring the title of 'Graf'. He attended the Kloster Berge school (P√§dagogium) near Magdeburg between 1756 and 1758. He was introduced to the world of mining by Friedrich Anton von Heynitz, a mining official and later Minister of Industry under Frederick the Great. In 1760 he enrolled for a course on mineralogy at the University of Helmstedt. In 1763 he became financial advisor to the Duke of Braunschweig, and in this capacity made numerous trips to mines and saltworks of the region in the company of his father Friedrich August von Veltheim (1709-1775).http://worldhistory.de/wnf/navbar/wnf.php?oid=12670&sid;= In 1766 he was promoted to Inspector of Mines in the mineral-rich mining district of the Harz Mountains. After the death of his first son and first wife in 1779, Veltheim resigned his post and for some years withdrew from public life.Uarbke Castle on German Wikipedia He was appointed privy councillor to the Duke of Braunschweig, and in 1790 was named general inspector of mines and saltworks in the western extremities of Russia by Catherine the Great. Veltheim still preferred the tranquil life of Harbke, a place to which he soon returned, where, in the grounds of Uarbke Castle, he carried on developing the widely acclaimed public gardens started by his father.http://www.gaerten- parks.de/biografien.html His home became a gathering place for celebrities in the social, scientific and literary worlds. The Castle boasted a large library, cabinets displaying minerals and fossils, and collections of engravings. Veltheim planned to write a treatise on the formation of the earth, but only managed to complete the first part, 'Etwas √ºber die Bildung des Basalts' and which was published in Leipzig in 1787; a second edition appeared in 1789. Historically this was an important work since it correctly attributed granite to arising from volcanic processes. Veltheim broke with the Wernerian doctrine, then popular in German geological science. Veltheim published very few works, and even those had a small circulation. He was awarded an honorary doctorate in science from the University of Helmstedt in 1793. The plant genus Veltheimia was named in his honour by the botanist Johann Gottlieb Gleditsch (1714-1786). Genealogy August Ferdinand's parents were Friedrich August von Veltheim (21 October 1709 Harbke - 19 April 1775 Braunschweig) and Maria Anna Katharina Kameytsky von Elstibors (1709-1760), who had married on 19 November 1732 in Wolfenb√ºttel.

Story Suman and Mahesh have been married for several years, but have not been blessed with any children. Suman prays in the temple frequently and hopes that her prayers will be answered. When she delivers a boy in hospital, a fire breaks out and the baby is switched with another whose mother died after delivery. Mahesh gets furious at this and for the worse, Major Bhagawat Singh enters asking for his son. Unable to identify his son by any means, Mahesh allows Major Bhagawat to stay and raise both kids his way while Suman nurtures both as her own. Surendra and Narendra grow up, behave alike and make matters worse for Mahesh. The latter then takes the help of his friend Sudhakar, who sends his daughter Kiran to stay at his house with a secret mission of studying both sons to identify Mahesh's son. Major finds out and makes her realise the bond between both sons and their mother, in whom she sees her long lost own. Meanwhile, the brothers have become good friends with Kiran, until they overhear the truth about her motive and also her alliance with one of them. Surendra and Narendra inebriate her in order to defame her in the eyes of their mother, but the latter immediately finds out. Kiran is shocked overhearing Surendra's talks of hatred for her and leaves the house on the next morning. Both sons are scolded and ordered by their mother to bring her back, where Surendra apologises first to Kiran and also falls in love with her. Back home, he learns of his brother's love for her and decides to sacrifice his own for him. When Surendra meets Kiran again, he suddenly tries to molest her. When exposed, he makes a scene, breaks his alcohol bottle and threatens Mahesh who subsequently disowns him, and throw him and Major out. The Major talks to him only to find out it was all a farce to give up his love, for which the Major is proud of him. Narendra uses all his efforts to find the two, but to no avail. His marriage is fixed with Kiran, who is not happy with it. Misconceived as the groom at the wedding, Surendra's picture with Kiran was gifted, but Narendra sees it and deduces their relation. He catches Surendra there itself, talks down his truth but happily gives Kiran to him. Suman smartly senses the Major's presence and obligates him to come forth, so that he can let out his and Suman's secret. Shown a photograph of him with his second wife, Mahesh admits after 20 years that due to the inability to bear an heir, he secretly got married again, but ditched his second wife on knowing about the pregnancy of the first. It is then clear that Surendra stays as he is the true heir and Narendra the outsider. The Major, being the brother-in-law of Mahesh gets the latter's apology and Surendra's marriage proceeds happily.

Traditionally, the festival is observed for 10 days in all Indian households but, the actual puja that takes place in the 'pandals' is held over a period of 5 days (starting from shashthi).In India fasting is undertaken by many people on this holy occasion. People also get together on this day to dance 'garba' and wear colourful clothes. This day is also known for 'Astra Puja'(Worshiping Weapons) as on this day the weapons of goddess Durga are worshiped. The day is also known as Vira Ashtami as there are seen to use arms or martial arts on this day. Description The eighth day of Navratri or Durga Puja celebrations is known as Durgashtami, or Durga Ashtami. It is also known as Mahashtami and is one of the most auspicious day according to Hinduism. It falls on bright lunar fortnight Ashtami tithi of Aswina month according to the Hindu calendar. It is believed in some regions, the Goddess Chamunda appeared on this day from the forehead of Mother Durga and annihilated Chanda, Munda, and Rakthabija (the demons who were associates of Mahishasura). The 64 Yoginis and Ashta Shakti or matrikas (the eight ferocious form of Goddess Durga) are worshiped during the Durga Puja rituals on Mahashtami. The Ashta Sati, also known as Eight Shaktis, are interpreted differently in different regions of India. But ultimately, all the eight goddesses are incarnations of Shakti. They are the same powerful Divine Feminine, representing different energies. The Ashta Shakti worshiped during Durga Puja are Brahmani, Maheswari, Kaumari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, Narasinghi, Indrani and Chamunda. Tradition A tradition associated with Durga Ashtami originated in North India is to honor the kanyaka in the home. A group of young, unmarried girls (a group of five or seven) are invited into the home to honor them. The tradition is based on the belief that each of these young girls( kanyaka ), represents the shakti (energy) of Durga on Earth. The group of girls are welcomed by washing their feet (a common ceremonial in India to welcome someone), welcoming them into the home, and then the rituals are done as Alati and Puja. After the rituals the girls are fed sweets and foods and honored with small gifts. The 2019 date is Sunday, October 6.

The troupe, founded by Mr. Manimaran Magizhini in 2007, specializes in one of the Tamil's oldest folk art, Parai Aattam (Parai Music & Dance).Drummer woman makes it big The troupe has a few full-time artistes and many part-time artistes. The troupe has a mix of men and women.  Vision & Mission  The troupe's primary mission is to spread the folk-art (Parai Aattam) across the world and make the same attain a respectable spot among other forms of art.  Performances  The troupe's flagship performance is the Parai Aattam. The troupe is also proficient in other folk art forms like Oyil Aattam, Peria Kuchi Aattam, Sila, Kazhiyalattam and Bommaiyattam In principle, Buddhar Kalaikuzhu performs Parai Aattam to signify and celebrate life but not death. Hence, Parai Aattam is performed by the troupe's artistes on stages in uniforms, for occasions such as birth, puberty, engagement, marriages. Buddhar Kalaikuzhu does not perform for funerals Finding Paraiaattam a better place for various reasons. As Mr.Manimaran explains \\"Performing at funerals would mean that we cannot wear uniforms/anklets nor can we express ourselves. Moreover, the women performers are not allowed in cremation grounds. It is also unfair to negotiate wages during that time\\" It is to be noted that artistes in Buddhar Kalaikuzhu do not touch the Parai with alcohol in their blood. So far, Buddhar Kalaikuzhu has performed across India in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. Apart from the 'on invitation' performances, Buddhar Kalaikuzhu routinely participates in and for social causes.  Spreading Parai  Sensing that the Parai art form is on the decline, Buddhar Kalaikuzhu is striving to find Parai a better place. Apart from holding lectures and demonstrations in colleges & schools, Buddhar Kalaikuzhu is running a few training programs to learn Parai through its Parai Training School. Every year, a three-day training camp ‡Æµ‡Øá‡Æü‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Ææ‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≤‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç ‡ÆÖ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æ™‡Æ±‡Øà is held in Vedanthangal and Chennai during the months of May and December. The participants in the camp learn the basics of Parai at a very nominal cost inclusive of food and accommodation. Buddhar Kalaikuzhu also conducts a one-year certificate course on Parai Aattam in Chennai. The participants are taken through the different stages of Parai music and dance. They also get to learn the history of Parai and are encouraged to contribute to the betterment of Parai. Buddhar Kalaikuzhu's Parai school is the first to introduce a written examination as part of their Parai certificate course, apart from the other routine practical tests.  Awards and Recognitions  In 2012, Buddhar Kalaikuzhu was featured in Vikatan TV Real Heroes of Tamil Nadu: Manimaran In 2014, the troupe was chosen as the Best Art Troupe for People (‡Æö‡Æø‡Æ±‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§ ‡ÆÆ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Øç ‡Æï‡Æ≤‡Øà‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æ¥‡ØÅ) by Kalagam.

He was followed in this mission by Pedro Sainz Rodr√≠guez. He also ran the humour magazine Muchas Gracias.AlbaceteImage Precioso was a Republican by political inclination. As a novelist, he wrote popular (often erotic) fiction for the masses.

A satirical story by Ramon Valle-Inclan had displeased the dictator. Precioso was one of the intellectuals who were part of the \\"Decadentismo\\" movement in Spanish culture. The others were Antonio de Hoyos y Vinent, √Ålvaro Retana and Ram√≥n Mar√≠a del Valle-Incl√°n. Apart from Valle-Inclan, the rest fled to Paris. Precioso was a literary translator as well; he translated from French the works of Emmanuel Bove, Maurice Constantin Weyer and Andr√© Maurois, and from English Volpone by Ben Jonson.

Located on the floodplain of a waterway, it is one of the state's largest Paleo-Indian habitation sites, estimated by the surveying archaeologists to be about . The unstratified (single-layer) site is expected to contribute significantly to what is known about prehistoric human habitation patterns in the area, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994 for this reason.Spiess, Arthur (1994). NRHP nomination for Archeological Site No. 39.1; redacted version available by request from the National Park Service Description Site 39.1 is located in Searsmont, a rural inland community of southern Waldo County, Maine. Its setting is in a floodplain of one of the local waterways, in a hay meadow that had not seen active agricultural use for many years. The site was identified in 1993 during a field survey pursuant to the routing of a communications cable, and was subjected to test excavation that year, and more extensive field work in 1994. The site was determined by the investigating archaeologists to encompass a roughly rectangular area in size. Three major clusters of cultural artifacts were found, as were a number of minor ones; based on the area surveyed to uncover these features, the site was judged to be that of a large seasonal encampment, involving multiple family units. One of the major clusters had a significant number of stone tools, and the byproducts of their manufacture (debitage), suggesting that area was a specialized work area. The other two major concentrations have a broader array of materials, suggesting that they were living spaces. Most of the stone tools recovered were scrapers and other domestic tools; only one projectile point was found, with a style that was ambiguous as to placement in known historical sequences. The stone from which the tools were made came from a diversity of regional sources.

He was principal engineer of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Radiosonic Laboratory in the 1930s. He invented the first practical fathometer, a water depth measuring instrument for ships.  Early life  Dorsey was born in Kirkersville, Ohio on April 24, 1876. His parents were Edwin Jackson and Mary Elma (Grove) Dorsey.  Family  On June 21, 1900, Dorsey married Virginia Rowlett in Palmetto, Florida. Their children were Herbert Grove, Jr. and William Rowlett.  Education  Dorsey received a Bachelor of Science degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1897. He did post-graduate work at Hopkins in 1897 and received a Master of Science honorary degree from Denison University in 1898. He did post-graduate work at Harvard University in 1900‚Äì1901 and earned a Ph. D. from Cornell University in 1908.  Societies  He was a member of Beta Theta Pi.  Career  Dorsey taught physics at the University of Maine from 1898‚Äì1900. He was head of the physics and electricity departments at the University of Florida from 1901‚Äì03 and at the University of Rochester from 1903‚Äì1904. Dorsey was assistant instructor in physics from 1904‚Äì1905, and instructor of physics from 1905‚Äì1910 at Cornell University. From 1910‚Äì1911, Dorsey worked as an electrical engineer in the research laboratory of Western Electric Company. He worked as an inventor at the National Cash Register Company from 1912‚Äì16. He was a physicist for the Hammond Radio Research Laboratory in Gloucester, Massachusetts from 1916‚Äì1921 and for the Submarine Signal Company from 1922‚Äì1925. Starting in 1926, he worked for the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey as the principal electrical engineer, continuing through the 1930s.  Inventions  Some of his patented inventions were an automatic deposit box, 1908; an electric indicating system for railways, 1908; a telephone circuit, 1912; a telephone apparatus improvement, 1912; a device for graphically reproducing sound waves, 1912; a submarine mine, 1916; an electrical credit system, 1916; a safety device for electrical circuits, 1916; a submarine control system, 1918; a telegraphy device, 1921; and an auto chain applicator, 1921.  Fathometer  Dorsey invented the practical fathometer in 1923, which is also referred to as the Dorsey Fathometer by the director of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1934. It worked by sending a high pitched sound through the water. It traveled to the bottom at a known speed and returned an echo at the rate of four pings per second. This could then be measured and calculated as to the depth since sound travels at a precise speed in water. The \\"Fathometer\\" was so named by Dorsey because it measures fathoms. File:Dorsey with Fathometer 1930.jpgDorsey, circa 1930 File:Fathometer.jpgSubmarine Signal Company model File:Brown fathometer.jpgFathometer aboard the Liberty ship . The Dorsey Fathometer instrument was used to get a precise measurement of water depth. It could measure depths from 8 to 3000 fathoms. The accuracy of the instrument was to within three inches and it could be measured in a millisecond. There were different models of the fathometer made initially by the Submarine Signal Company. The indicator of the Dorsey Fathometer was a neon tube on a rotating disc. The instrument looked like a clock and was in the bridge of a ship. The transmitting and receiving electronics were usually below the deckhouse. Before this instrument a ship had slow down considerably or stop to take soundings to get the depth. With Dorsey's Fathometer a ship could go at full speed and get the measurements.

The band was formed in Bamako after being forced to leave their homes during the civil conflict and the imposition of Sharia law. The band released its debut album, Music in Exile, via Transgressive Records on February 23, 2015, while Julian Casablancas' Cult Records partnered with Atlantic Records to release the album in North America in March 2015. The group is one of the principal subjects of the documentary film They Will Have To Kill Us First. Origins In 2012, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) took control of the north of Mali. In turn, they were pushed out by Ansar Dine, a jihadist group which banned cigarettes, alcohol and music. Garba Tour√©, a guitarist from Dir√©, near Timbuktu, was forced to leave, and moved to Bamako, the country's capital, in the south. Together with Aliou Tour√© and Oumar Tour√©, they formed a band \\"... to recreate that lost ambience of the north and make all the refugees relive those northern songs.\\" The three of them, unrelated despite having the same surname, are Songhoy people. The name of the band comes from their ethnicity and the genre of music they play, 'desert blues'. Career Songhoy Blues began playing on the Bamako club circuit, attracting both Songhoy and Tuareg fans. In September 2013, Africa Express, a group of American and European musicians and producers led by Damon Albarn, visited Bamako to record an album of collaborations. The band auditioned successfully and were introduced to Nick Zinner, the American guitarist of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. They worked with Zinner to record \\"Soubour,\\" meaning patience. The track was released in December 2013 on Maison Des Jeunes, the 2013 Africa Express compilation. Following the success of \\"Soubour\\", the band returned to the studio with Zinner and co-producer Marc-Antoine Moreau to work on an album. Their debut album, Music in Exile, was released on Transgressive Records in February 2015 and on Cult Records, via Atlantic Records, in North America in March 2015. It received \\"universal acclaim\\" according to the review aggregating website Metacritic. Robin Denselow, writing for The Guardian, described the album as \\"an impressively varied and rousing set\\", and named Songhoy Blues \\"[a] band to watch\\". In the NME, Kevin EG Perry described the album as \\"a masterpiece of desert blues; blending American guitar licks with Malian groove\\". The band were nominated for \\"Best New Act\\" at the 2015 Q Awards and as \\"Independent Breakthrough Act\\" at the 2015 AIM Awards. They supported Alabama Shakes at the Beacon Theatre in New York, and were subsequently called \\"insistent and determined but also headed for the ecstatic\\" in a review posted by The New York Times They have also supported Julian Casablancas and Damon Albarn and in 2015 appeared at numerous festivals including Glastonbury Festival, Bonnaroo Festival, Latitude Festival, Roskilde Festival, Austin City Limits and Green Man Festival. In 2016 they played at Byron Bay Bluesfest and WOMADelaide in Australia and Green Man Festival and The Great Escape Festival in the UK. At the Royal Albert Hall for Later‚Ä¶ with Jools Holland‚Äôs 25th anniversary, they played two songs with tenor saxophone player Tunday Akintan. On August 5, 2020 Songhoy Blues announced their new album, Optimisme would be released on October 23, 2020 through Fat Possum Records.

'World music' they are not\\". Band member Garba Toure states,\\"We grew up listening to old music by the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix and John Lee Hooker. But our main diet was hip hop and R&B.; We can't stay in the traditional aesthetic of our grandparents; that was another time. Besides, we love electric guitars too much\\". Helen Brown of the Daily Telegraph describes the band's music as \\"Africa-blues-rock\\", stating that Songhoy Blues \\"do owe a musical debt to Ali Farka Tour√© (whose songs they started out covering), but they're definitely etching out their own groove\\". Garba Tour√© is the son of Ali Farka Tour√©'s long-time percussionist.

Generally, it is used for illegal electricity connection. In Karachi, a parallel power supply has been running for years. Electricity shortage throughout Pakistan is a chronic issue. Street protests in Pakistan for electricity shutdown and poor performance are common. However, no proper solution is achieved by the protesters, instead a sweet promise is assured to the victims of electricity supply by the concerned quarters of the locality. Electricity theft Energy theft is a world issue and this white collar crime is committed elsewhere irrespective of economic stability of countries. Electricity theft of 6 billion US dollars per year was reported in 2012-13 alone in the US. A business case from a utility in Canada, BC Hydro, claims that electricity theft cost them at least 850 GWh (gigawatt-hours) or approximately US Dollar 100 million per year. In some countries, energy loss due to theft is estimated at over 35%. Legitimate customers bear the cost of electricity theft, which has grown significantly in the recent decades. The rate of stealing electricity is much higher in developing countries like Pakistan. In 2013 it was placed on record in the Senate of Pakistan, that in the last 5 years Pakistan had lost Rs 90 billion in electricity theft and line losses. Power supply to Karachi K-Electric is a successor to KESC which was its original name for more than 70 years and was operating as a vertically integrated power utility in Pakistan. It is thoroughly integrated in generation, transmission and distribution to the whole Karachi city and its surroundings. Earlier to 1990 KESC was enjoying a good reputation. Suddenly it was placed under WAPDA control at that time company‚Äôs share with its face value in Pakistan Rupees 10/- was selling at Rs.160/- in stock market. WAPDA was ill-reputed for corruption and mismanagement. Under WAPDA control its share was trading below face value. However KESC was privatized later. Urbanization without town planning BBC Delhi correspondent, besides citing different issues, one of the disclosed reasons of electricity theft was that in India poor people buy stolen power because they cannot afford to buy it. In Karachi this reason can also be observed in least developed areas. According to estimates published in 2012-13, there were approximately 483 Katchi Abadies (unauthorized residential colonies) in Karachi prior to 1990, the residents of such localities do not have legal right to have civic facilities and basic living provisions such as electricity/water from government departments. According to Chairman of Standing Committee on Urban Development of the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, now it has grown to over 4,700. This is a main reason, where poor and deprived people are compelled to deal with Kunda Mafia. Monopoly and international competition Electricity theft, particularly in Pakistan, can best be evaluated in the finding/study by Thomas B. Smith Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Zayed University, Dubai, UAE Kunda as a temporary solutions According to disclosing by KESC sources the Daily Times Pakistan writes: Artificial reasons of theft Difference in time of load-shedding: A large number of illegal ‚Äòkunda‚Äô connections are overloading the K-Electric. The use of kunda connections not only a cause of financial losses to K-Electric but also the main reason of frequent tripping. Among many other reasons one of the basis of getting electricity through kunda system is access of consumer to a nearby area where timing of two neighborhoods are different for load shedding. Night Matches Kunda system is also applied in Saturday night matches which is very common in Karachi. They use at least 15-20 of 500-watts bulb rods for lighting a little area of pitch. More consumption versus higher cost One of the reasons for electricity theft is that middle class who due to meager resources could not bear to pay the many units consumed at a higher cost on slab to slab increase. The slabs of units consumed and electricity charges are (2015 slabs and rates): :Pakistan Rupees 10.20 per unit :from 201-300 units Rs.16 per unit :for consumers of 301-700 units Rs.18 per unit (+ General sales tax and other charges) There is strong basis for charging electricity consumption bill according to affordability of consumers (reasonable tariff for 300-500 units - this step will reduce electricity theft), incompetency of people because of resources can be noticed that even they had given no importance to a religious decree issued in 2009 prohibiting theft of electricity. Anti-theft measures by Pakistan and K-Electric In 2014 President of Pakistan has issued an ordinance for defining strict punishments to electricity thieves across the country. The strategy and the action should be based upon a thorough understanding of the specific nature of the theft problem, while implementing the law against electricity thefts so as to technical loss due to pilferage and theft of electricity should not be dealt with combined. K-Electric has introduced a latest technology which will remove ‚ÄúKunda system and electricity theft‚Äù. Under this program Area Bundle Cable (ABC) System has already been installed in Kiamari area and entire city is to be covered with the new technology of ABC. The system makes it impossible to steal electricity and K-Electric can reduce transmission and distribution loss (T&D; loss) remarkably as the ABC project will install special power cables and digital power tariff meters, which are kunda and tampering proof.

According to Oscar Ho, the former exhibition director of Hong Kong Art Centre, he is one of the pioneers to engage in contemporary art in Hong Kong during the early 70s. His artistic uniqueness is best expressed in his creations ‚ÄúFrogtopia‚Äù, which takes over the exhibition space with numerous colourful mixed-media installations and graffiti of his signatured frog icon. In addition to his inexhaustible style, Kwok held a solo multimedia art exhibition representing Hong Kong ‚ÄúFrogtopia-Hongkorucopia‚Äù (ËõôÊâòÈÇ¶‚Ä¢È¥ªÊ∏ØÊµ©ÊêûÁ≠ÜÈ¥â) at the 54th Venice Biennale in 2011. He is currently the director of the Frog King Museum at Cattle Depot Artist Village since 2001. Early Life and education Kwok Mang-Ho (aka Frog King) was born in 1947 in Guangdong, China and grew up in Hong Kong. He began his artistic practice as a traditional ink painter under the guidance of Lui Shou-Kwan, who was known as the ‚ÄúHong Kong New Ink Painting master‚Äù at the time. Thus he was enrolled to the Fine Art programmes at the Grantham College of Education in Hong Kong (now renamed the Institute of Education) from 1967 to 1970. Concurrently, during 1968 to 1973, he further studied in extramural courses at the Chinese University of Hong Kong as well as the University of Hong Kong. After his completion of the programmes, Kwok went to the Art Students League of New York for further education(1980-1984). He spent 15 years in New York City experiencing new art scenes, and eventually returned and settled down in Hong Kong in 1995. Career Apart from his own creative projects, Kwok also engaged himself in the art scenes as administrator or supervisors both in Hong Kong and New York. During 1970 to 1975, he took part as the stage designer at the Experimental Cantonese Opera association of Hong Kong; meanwhile from 1971 to 1976, he was one of the principle art teachers at a local secondary school (New Territories Heung Yee Kuk Yuen Long District Secondary School). In the year 1974, Kwok first time made himself a curator at the Conceptual Art Exhibition in Hong Kong. Since 1977 until 1980, he was committed as the lecturer at the School of Design of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. While spending his time in New York, Kwok further gained professional experiences for being the curator of the Kwok Gallery Community Art Show & Projects (1982‚Äì84), the visual director at Yomoma Art Icl. (1984‚Äì91), and the wearable art designer at the Art Accessories(1985‚Äì91). After his return to Hong Kong, in 2000, Kwok continued taking part in the local creative sector. Since then and now-on, he is the advisor for the Art Focus Joint School Art Exhibition, director of the Museum Project at the Cattle Depot Artist Village, director of the Hong Kong Art Institute and art course teacher at the Student Union of Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Works Kwok 's works enclose a great diversity of media covering calligraphy, sculpture, installation, performance art and photography. Since 1967, he has produced numerous creative projects in over 3,000 art events around the world, including London, New York, Paris, Tokyo, Seoul, Toronto, Hong Kong and Singapore. Some of his most famous works are 9 Million Works(1999), Frog Fun Lum(2007) and Plastic Bags Project(1978). Apart from the above, he also starting numbers of interactive worldwide projects such as the Body Installation Project(1981‚Äìpresent), Froggy Sunglasses 10 Years Project(1989-present), Nine Million Works Project(1999‚Äìpresent) and Frog King Kwok Museum Project(2001‚Äìpresent). The above mixed-media installation and exhibitions are considered part of his Nine Million Works Project. Style During the late 60s, Kwok began on experimenting the possibility of contemporary art. He worked on ready-made objects, mixed media and collage in repeated manner. ‚ÄúTo me, art is life and life is art‚Äù he said. The boundary between art and his life is blurry and interdependent. He is considered to be an eccentric artist whose work is intuitive with chaotic expression and experimental spirit. He emphasizes the spontaneous imagination, improvisation, interaction and participation. During the exhibition of 9 Million Works and Frog Fun Lum, he did some improvisation performances entitled ‚ÄúOne Second Body Installation‚Äù and ‚ÄúOne Second Live Art‚Äù with the audience. The iconic motifs in his works are the graffiti-style frog‚Äôs face and a pair of eyes as the symbol of a bridge or boat, which both represents the perpetuity and the cycle of life. ‚ÄúFrogtopia‚Äù, refers to the Utopia of his artistic space, which is embodied by the construction of his collage, mixed media art and installation. Identification with frogs In an interview with a CNN journalist Doug Meigs, Kwok revealed that his attachment toward frogs had taken a significant part during his growing up. For instance, according to the article, when he was about 5 years old, he usually climbed up a huge rock called \\"Big Froggy Rock\\" in Happy Valley so as to watch the horse races; later in his teenage years, he refereed himself as the \\"Frog Prince\\" when approaching girls. After staying abroad for more than a decade, Kwok absorbed notably western cultures and mindsets. Thus so, he developed a more mature and in-depth perception toward frogs. With the multi-cultural background he has, he relates himself to frogs which are amphibians that could live vividly either in water or on land and explore freely the two different worlds. Artistic experiment with the Plastic Bags Project In the late 1970s, Kwok started using plastic bags as the major medium in his creative projects. The Plastic Bags Project, was first introduced in 1978, which he attached plastic bags in circles to create a 3-dimensional installation in a public space in Toronto. The concept behind was to sculpt air and plastic bags was for him the perfect malleable container. This specific choice of this uncommon elemental material led him the pioneer in Hong Kong art scene. Through this piece of work, Kwok expects to put people‚Äôs garbage, problems, anxiety and those are not to be seen inside the bags. He aimed to turn the use of plastic bags of creating 'air sculpture' into a meaningful act, rather than only as an contention against the unconscious action of concealment; he wanted to it to be a new form of art. After the success, Kwok intrepid art performances of tying plastic bags in Tiananmen Square and Great Wall shocked the conventional contemporaries. This Great Wall plastic bag action, named the Plastic Bag Happenings in China(1979), which is also referred as the Plastic Bag Installation Along The Great Wall, was part of the ‚ÄúKwok in Beijing‚Äù project created during his visit to Beijing in April, 1979. It was his earliest performance art, and was simultaneously the earliest documented performance art in China in the late 70s. He continued to work on the Big Plastic Bag Action collaborating with students from Tsuen Wan Hoi Pa Street Government Primary School.

He is a member of the Club of Hungarian Science Journalists, author of the \\"X-Akn√°k\\" popular science blog, and was co-editor and co-host of the television series of the same name. Hrask√≥ is a scientific and technical consultant for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. Personal life and education He's the oldest son of P√©ter Hrask√≥, renowned physicist, recognised for his research and teaching activities on the field of relativity. Following his high school graduation in 1981, he went on to study biology at the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University, where he finished his studies with a Research master's degree in 1987. After that he worked as a biologist at the Zoology Department of the Hungarian Natural History Museum until 1989, when he moved on to the field of IT.  Career as a skeptic =Science educator G√°bor Hrask√≥ giving a talk on homeopathy at an event organised by the Hungarian Skeptic Society in 2012 His first science education writings were published in 1999 in the Hungarian journal Term√©szet Vil√°ga, in a special column that lasted 3 issues and was given the title Szkeptikus Sarok (translates as 'Skeptical Corner'). This was followed by several other articles, but in 2001 he started his own skeptical blog with the title X-Akn√°k (translates to 'X-Mines', with reference to the then very popular series, the X-Files). G√°bor Hrask√≥ at the 16th European Skeptics Congress in London In 2003 the same title was used for a TV series he co- edited and co-hosted with the Hungarian quiz show host and fellow skeptic Istv√°n V√°g√≥. The show featured lively debates with proponents of pseudoscientific claims and lasted only 11 episodes before it was shut down by the channel (ATV), claiming there had been violent reactions from debated pseudoscientists and negative feedback from viewers. Skeptical activist After the political changes in Hungary in 1990, many different claims of a pseudoscientific nature started to emerge in the country. To provide an organised force against pseudoscience, a group called T√©nyeket Tisztel≈ëk T√°rsas√°ga (\\"Society of the Respecters of Facts\\", also called 'Hungarian Skeptics') was brought to life in 1992. Although this was not an officially existing body, G√°bor Hrask√≥ became a board member and secretary, but after it became obvious that the purely academic style in the skeptic movement was not efficient, he and Istv√°n V√°g√≥ started the preparations to establish an officially existing organisation to coordinate grassroots activism. The future of scientific skepticism is improving, according to Hrask√≥, as popular movies are shifting away from scientists being the \\"bad guys\\" and more movies such as The Martian, Interstellar and Gravity are making the heroes scientists. These movies are featuring good scientific content but still appeal to audiences not normally interested in science. This is a \\"great influence\\" and helping to change views on science. In order to facilitate a love of science, according to Hrask√≥, we need to tell good stories, \\"not to trap... but to explain... people are not rational animals... we have to teach them to become so\\". When asked what advice he would give someone interested in getting involved in the skeptical movement, he said, \\"You do not have to be a scientist or expert on a subject... you will learn as you go\\". Role in the Hungarian skeptic movement In December 2006, the Hungarian Skeptic Society (HSS) was founded, with Istv√°n V√°g√≥ elected president and G√°bor Hrask√≥ to become vice president of the organisation. Then he went on to become COO in 2008 and president in 2009, a position he holds to date. The Hungarian Skeptics originally began with the atheist movement, but they discovered that the two groups had different strategies, Hrask√≥ explains that both are important, but the atheist group is more philosophical and has already reached the conclusion that God does not exist, no need to investigate. Whereas skeptics are more focused on the scientific method. As of the fall of 2015, there are 100 members of the Hungarian skeptic group. Role in the European skeptic movement ECSO holding a meeting in London at the 16th European Skeptics Congress in 2015 (left to right): Tim Trachet, Amardeo Sarma, Michael Heap, G√°bor Hrask√≥ and Catherine de Jong After the HSS had joined the European Council of Skeptical Organisations (ECSO) in 2007, he acted as a chief organiser of the 14th European Skeptics Congress held in Budapest in 2010, hosted by the Hungarian Skeptics. He became vice chairman of the ECSO, then in 2013 he was elected chairman of the organisation at the 15th European Skeptics Congress in Stockholm. There he remained until the end of the 17th European Skeptics Congress, when he left the role and was replaced by Claire Klingenberg. In recent years, he has been attending skeptic meetings across Europe as well as still playing a leading role in the Hungarian movement at large. When asked what the biggest challenges are for Hungary and Europe, Hrask√≥ explained that when they started out in the early 1990s the focus was on UFOs and Astrology. Now the focus has changed to alt med and health scares, also more scientific centered topics like GMO's and global warming are becoming more important.  Other appearances  At the 17th European Skeptics Congress, he chaired a panel on science and religion. Joining him on the panel were Konrad Talmont- Kami≈Ñski, Gerald Ostdiek, Petr Jan Vin≈°, and Leo Igwe.  Public life  He was active in the international green movement at the end of the 80s and beginning of the 90s and was a founding member of the Green Party of Hungary, within which he was responsible for international relations from 1989. It was in this period, when he was chief organiser of the first Eastern European meeting of European Greens in Budapest in 1990. He was also one of the leading members of the GreenWay movement as editor of their newsletter.  Personal life  G√°bor Hrask√≥ is an experienced hiker and an ardent birdwatcher, and also has a passion for flying, something he tries to satisfy with self- education through flight simulators. Asked about his partaking in the 10:23 Campaign in 2010, he said \\"I am a five-year survivor\\". Hrask√≥ is married and has two daughters.

She was one of the first female members of the Communist Party of China, and one of the 28 Bolsheviks trained in Moscow. A high-ranking commander of the Fourth Front Army of the Chinese Red Army during the Long March, she is often considered the only woman general of the Red Army. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, she served as Deputy Minister of Textile Industry. She was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution and committed suicide in 1968. Early life and education Wedding photo of Zhang Qinqiu and Shen Zemin On 15 November 1904, Zhang Qinqiu was born to an affluent family in Shimen, Tongxiang, Zhejiang Province. She entered Hangzhou Girls Normal School (now Hangzhou No. 14 High School) in 1920, before going to Shanghai for further education. In Shanghai she met the famous novelist Mao Dun (Shen Yanbing), who was married to Zhang's elementary school classmate Kong Dezhi, and his younger brother Shen Zemin, one of the earliest members of the Communist Party of China (CPC). In 1924, Zhang entered the sociology department of the left-wing Shanghai University, where Shen Zemin was an instructor and the early Communist leader Qu Qiubai was the department head. Zhang joined the CPC in November 1924, becoming one of the first female CPC members. She married Shen Zemin a year later. Under the leadership of Xiang Jingyu, Zhang and other women students established a night school for women workers in Shanghai, and organized a strike of silk workers in 1924. She also recruited some of the workers into the CPC. In November 1925, the CPC sent more than 100 party members, including Zhang Qinqiu, to study at Moscow Sun Yat-sen University in the Soviet Union. Shen Zemin joined her soon afterwards. In May 1926, she gave birth to a daughter named Zhang Maya (Âº†ÁéõÂ®Ö). In Moscow, Zhang and Shen became members of the 28 Bolsheviks, which included future CPC leaders Wang Ming, Bo Gu, Zhang Wentian, and Yang Shangkun. She became proficient in Russian after two years of study, and worked as an interpreter for the CPC. She also worked in textile mills to learn production and management methods. Military career In 1930, Zhang and Shen returned to China, leaving their daughter in Moscow. In January 1931, when Wang Ming became the leader of the CPC, Shen Zemin was elected to the 6th CPC Central Committee and appointed propaganda chief of the CPC. In 1931, Shen and Zhang went to the Communist base in the border region of Hubei, Henan and Anhui (E-Yu-Wan) Provinces, which was under the leadership of Zhang Guotao. After being attacked by the 200,000-strong Kuomintang forces in the Encirclement Campaigns, the E-Yu-Wan Red Army decided to abandon the base and break out of the encirclement to Sichuan-Shaanxi region in the west. Shen Zemin, who suffered from lung disease, insisted on remaining at the base. He died in November 1933. In November 1932, Zhang Qinqiu was appointed Director of the General Political Department of the Fourth Front Army, the highest war- time position ever held by a woman in the Chinese Communist army. She is often called the only woman general of the Red Army. In March 1934, Zhang was appointed Commander and Political Commissar of the Women's Independent Regiment of the Fourth Front Army, commanding 2,000 women soldiers. In 1935, she joined the Long March under the command of Zhang Guotao. In 1936, she married Chen Changhao, political commissar of the Fourth Front Army and another member of the 28 Bolsheviks. In October, 20,000 soldiers of the Fourth Front Army were split into the Western Route Army and arrived in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province. The Western Route Army was surrounded and defeated by the forces of the Ma clique then in control of Gansu. Zhang, who had just given birth to a baby who had to be abandoned, was captured and sent to the capital Nanjing. After the Xi'an Incident in December 1936, the Kuomintang government and the Communist rebels suspended their civil war and formed the Second United Front to resist the Japanese invasion. Zhang was released and sent to Yan'an, the de facto capital of the Communists. As more people arrived in Yan'an from areas occupied by Japan, the Chinese Women's University was established and Zhang became its dean. Her husband Chen Changhao had in 1938 gone to the Soviet Union for medical treatment, where he later lived with a Russian woman. Zhang divorced Chen in 1943, and married her third husband Su Jingguan, an army doctor. She was a member of the Women's Committee of the Central Committee of the CPC in the 1940s, and attended the Second International Federation of Democratic Women of 1948 in Budapest. People's Republic of China After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Zhang was appointed Vice Minister of Textile Industry, partly because of her earlier experience of organizing textile workers in Shanghai in the 1920s. Her husband Su Jingguan (died 1964) was appointed Vice Minister of Public Health. As a civilian, she did not receive a military rank when the People's Liberation Army first awarded them in 1955, even though many of her former subordinates, including Chen Geng, Xu Shiyou, Hong Xuezhi, and Liu Huaqing, were awarded the rank of general or grand general. When the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, Zhang and her family members were severely persecuted. In April 1968, she committed suicide by jumping from the balcony of her office. Her ex-husband Chen Changhao also killed himself. In 1976, her daughter Zhang Maya committed suicide by drug overdose. After the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, Zhang was posthumously rehabilitated. In June 1979, Marshal Xu Xiangqian, her former comrade in the Fourth Front Army, held a memorial ceremony for her, which was attended by Li Xiannian, Wang Zhen, Yu Qiuli, Chen Xilian and Hu Yaobang.

It examines children's manual labor forced upon them by their exploiters. It was published in August 1843 in Blackwood's Magazine. This was shortly following the report into child labour by the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Children's Employment. Background Browning wrote about contemporary topics, particularly liberal causes of her day.Greenblatt, Stephen (2013) Elizabeth Barrett Browning (pp.1993-1994) For instance, in \\"The Cry of the Children\\", Browning portrays children being underground the majority of their young lives, dragging wheelbarrows, and working long hours. The harsh conditions in which they are made to work can cause their lungs and hearts to rapidly dysfunction. She uses a young lamb bleating in the meadows to represent the young children crying from whatever pains they must endure at the moment. Browning involves young animals to symbolize innocence and being put through both mental and physical pain for the satisfaction of an owner (1842). This encourages the reader to put themselves in that position to better understand how intense the conditions were. Although The Cry of the Children is a 13 stanza poem it does not use the popular terza rima rhyme scheme (ABA BCB CDC DED) but rather an ABAB CDCD EFEF format. This is superior as it makes the poem's main idea straightforward. This leads readers to Browning's key point, the death of children because they are forced to work from a very tender age and they pray to God to be taken before their time of actual death (Beaming Notes, 2015). Browning best describes this in lines 51-52 as the children say ‚ÄúIt is good when it happens, that we die before our time‚Äù and in lines 86-87 the children pray for the absurd noises to come to an end (Browning, 1842).

In his review of the album, Spin's Andrew Unterberger compared the song to the work of synthpop duo Erasure. Speculating on possible influences, the Rolling Stone's Dan Hallman characterised the song as \\"Killers-ish\\". In similar vein, Drowned In Sound's Andrzej Lukowski described the track as a \\"blippy homage to Corgan‚Äôs beloved New Order\\". In contrast, Consequence of Sound's Michael Roffman likened the track to the band's previous album Oceania. Background and recording The song was featured on several preliminary track listings for the album posted on the band's website. The final version that appears on the album seems to be considerably different from its early demo version. In an update on the recording process posted on the band's website on April 14, 2014, band leader Billy Corgan described the song's sound as being more Big Country than The Smashing Pumpkins, with producer Howard Willing criticising the \\"80s drums\\" on the track, triggering a process of \\"deconstruction\\". In a later update on 16 May, Corgan described \\"stripping away previous guitars so that all that was left were [..] drums and [...] bass\\", then adding an \\"arpeggiated figure\\" reminiscent of The Who's \\"Baba O'Riley\\" as well as strings reminiscent of the band's own song Tonight, Tonight. On June 18, 2014, Corgan announced the song as being \\"done\\" in another recording update on the band's website.  Music video Directed by longtime Corgan collaborator Linda Strawberry, the music video features \\"magical orbs, eerie incantations, and mysterious hooded women\\". Strawberry elaborated on the video's narrative: \\"The Magician is symbolic of transition and inspiration, while the protagonist in the video is afraid of who she is about to become, she learns, accepts and then lets go of whatever was holding her back.\\" Reception General critical reception to the song has been mixed. The Guardian's Kitty Empire noted the song \\"glides past appealingly\\" while \\"[crying] out for a Euro-rave remix\\". In similar fashion, Drowned In Sound's Andrzej Lukowski described the song as \\"gorgeous\\". Consequence of Sound's Michelle Geslani even called the song a \\"standout\\" of the album. A number of critics, however, found less praising words in their reviews. NME's Kevin Eg Perry considered the track one of the weaker on the album, calling it an \\"[unsuccessful] stab[...] at synthpop\\". Criticizing its \\"cringe-inducing text-speak title\\", he likened the song to \\"a forgotten 1980s Eurovision entry\\". Stereogum's Michael Nelson called the song \\"skippable\\", while Clash's Mike Diver referred to it as \\"completely tiresome\\" in his verdict.

Capture HMS Phoenix was attached to the fleet under Admiral Adam Duncan, operating in the North Sea.United Service Magazine (1841), 380. On 12 May 1796 at daybreak the 28-gun and the brig-sloop brought Duncan the news that a Dutch squadron consisting of the 36-gun frigate Argo and three brigs had departed Flickeroe, Norway, bound for the Texel. Duncan took his fleet to intercept them, sending a squadron the included Phoenix, the 50-gun , Pegasus, and Sylph northward of the Texel. The British intercepted the Dutch at 5am on 12 May. Phoenix and Leopard chased Argo, while Pegasus and Sylph made after the brigs. Leopard eventually fell some way behind, and consequently it was Phoenix alone that brought Argo to battle at 8a.m. on 12 May. After twenty minutes of fighting Argo struck. Phoenix had one man killed and three wounded; Argo lost six men killed and 28 wounded. HMS Janus Dodgson's double-headed pump as fitted to Janus (1796) The Royal Navy took Argo into service as HMS Janus, and commissioned her in July under Captain James Bissett. He sailed her to Jamaica in December. On 14 April 1797 Janus encountered the French frigate .British dispatches refer to Harmonie as Harmonie but some later writers have suggested that her name was Hermione. It was not. Harmonie, though larger than Janus, did not offer battle but instead turned for the port of Mar√©got. Bissett meanwhile sailed westwards until he encountered Rear-Admiral Sir Hyde Parker's squadron off M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas early on the morning of 15 April. Parker had three ships of the line at his disposal, his own flagship , , and , and he sent Thunderer and Valiant to Mar√©got in search of Hermione, while Queen returned to port for fresh provisions. In the ensuing Battle of Jean-Rabel, Thunder and Valiant fired on Harmonie on the evening of 16 April, but with little effect. They returned the next day when the weather was calmer. Knowing that Harmonie could not escape, her officers drove her aground and set her on fire; eventually her powder magazine exploded, destroying her completely. Later in 1797 Janus returned to Britain as escort to the homeward bound convoy.Marshall (1823), Vol. 1, Part 2, p.608. On 6 October 1797 Janus brought her convoy safe into The Downs. Between November and January 1798 Janus was at Deptford being fitted as a receiving ship. By 1807 she was in Ordinary. Fate The Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy offered \\"Janus, of 32 guns and 700 tons\\", lying at Deptford, for sale on 21 February 1811. Purchasers of Janus or of several of the larger vessels offered for sale had to post a bond of ¬£1000, with two guarantors, that the purchaser would break up their purchase within one year from the date of purchase.

He was a prominent designer of ecclesiastical windows in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Biography  Frederick Wilson was born in Dublin, Ireland to English parents, Charles and Elizabeth Wilson. The family eventually moved to England and Wilson and his six siblings were raised in both Liverpool and London. Although little is known about Wilson's early artistic education, there is evidence that he attended the South Kensington School, which was associated with the South Kensington Museum (now known as the Victoria and Albert Museum). In 1891, Wilson married Mary Gwladys Morgan, and the following year they immigrated to the United States. The couple had three children: Gladys, Sylvia and Beatrice.  Career  Design for beatitude window for Arlington Street Church, Boston, Massachusetts Frederick Wilson's career designing stained glass spanned more than 50 years. He was \\"known and accepted as an important artist in his field\\" during his lifetime, and his work had a major impact on how American ecclesiastical stained glass looked around the turn of the 20th century. Perhaps best known for his work at Tiffany Studios, Wilson also designed windows for at least five other firms, including: Heaton, Butler and Bayne, London, England; Alfred Godwin and Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Gorham Manufacturing Company, Providence, Rhode Island; The Los Angeles Art Glass Company, Los Angeles, California; and Judson Studios, also in Los Angeles. Over the course of his career, Wilson was a member of several professional arts groups, including the Art Club of Philadelphia, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the American Federation of Arts, and the Architectural League of New York. Wilson likely began his artistic career in England in the 1870s. He was heavily influenced by the work of the Pre-Raphaelites, and incorporated ecclesiastical subjects in his designs from a young age. In 1892, Wilson and his wife Mary emigrated to the United States. He soon found employment at Alfred Godwin and Company in Philadelphia. However there are no known Wilson designs executed by the company, and by 1893 he began working for Tiffany Studios.  Tiffany Studios and later career  Wilson was among the most prominent and prolific designers at Tiffany Studios, and was the first in-house designer in the Ecclesiastical Department. He likely joined the firm sometime in 1893, and that same year exhibited one of his designs using Tiffany's name at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Wilson was awarded a gold medal for work under his own name at the Exposition Universelle in Paris, France in 1900. In 1897, Wilson became Tiffany Studio's chief window designer. Two years later, in 1899, he was appointed the head of the Ecclesiastical Department. During this time he maintained his own studio in Briarcliff Manor, New York, and would often work there instead of at the Tiffany Studios factory in Corona, Queens. Wilson left Tiffany Studios in 1923. He moved to Los Angeles to work for Judson Studios. There, he received commissions for his work across the state, including a commission from the Judson family themselves on the death of William Lees Judson, the founder of the College of Fine Arts of the University of Southern California and the father of Judson Studios founder, Walter Judson. Wilson's final commission was for a series of windows to be installed in Garrett Memorial Chapel in, Jerusalem, New York. He completed the designs for the windows in 1931, but did not live to see their installation in 1932. Wilson passed away in March 1932 in Los Angeles.  Selected works  Jennie W. Mitchell Memorial Window, designed by Frederick Wilson for Tiffany Studios, circa 1900. *Windows in the Naval Academy Chapel (1899-1920), Annapolis, Maryland. Wilson designed a number of memorial windows for the chapel, including The Mason Window (1899), the Porter Window (1908), the Sampson Window (1909), and the Farragut Window (1920). *The Righteous Shall Receive a Crown of Glory (1901), originally installed in the United Methodist Church in Waterville, New York. This window was commissioned by Ira and Mary Brainard in memory of Charles Green. It is now in the collection of the Corning Museum of Glass. * The Te Deum (1906), originally installed in First Presbyterian Church, Syracuse, New York. The windows were likely removed around 2008 when the church was purchased by a Tiffany dealer. *Good Shepherd and Landscape (1909), originally installed the Stony Wold Sanatorium chapel in Lake Kushaqua, New York. The window was donated by Mrs. Walter Geer to Stony Wold in memory of her sister, Miss Martha Potter. It is now divided between the collections of the New-York Historical Society and the Neustadt. *The Prayer of the Christian Soldier (1919), installed in First Presbyterian Church (now United Presbyterian Church) in Binghamton, New York. *Anselm and Wycliff, (1920s) Saint John's Chapel at the Episcopal Divinity School, Cambridge, Massachusetts. *Windows in the Garrett Memorial Chapel (1930-31), Jerusalem, New York.

She appeared as a soloist in several volumes of the recording of all cantatas by Johann Sebastian Bach, conducted by her brother-in-law Masaaki Suzuki. A review of volume 5 said about the final duet of Tritt auf die Glaubensbahn, BWV 152, in which she sang the part of the Soul alongside Peter Kooy as Jesus: \\"both singers rise to the occasion, delivering characterization that couldn‚Äôt be rendered with more humility\\". A review of her recording of Was soll ich aus dir machen, Ephraim, BWV 89, notes: \\"She sings with great clarity. Her brief aria contains one of Bach‚Äôs typical, irresistible oboe obbligati. Suzuki matches the oboist‚Äôs delicacy and gives a lovely, poised account of the aria\\". Suzuki was in 1996 the soprano soloist in Handel's Messiah with the Bach Collegium Japan, performing alongside Yoshikazu Mera, John Elwes and David Thomas. She also recorded Bach's St John Passion with the Bach Collegium Japan. In 2000 she was one of the singers who also formed the choir (OVPP, one voice per part) in a recording of Bach's Mass in B minor with the ensemble La Petite Bande, conducted by Sigiswald Kuijken. In 2015 she was the vocalist in a recording La Ciaccona, a collection of early ciacconas from Spain and Italy by composers including Andrea Falconieri, Girolamo Frescobaldi and Salomone Rossi, played by the Japanese Ensemble Anthonello.

It closed in 1936. History The Academy had its origins in the community of British artists working in Rome, which had existed since the late 18th century, although its activities were disrupted by the Napoleonic wars. The Academy initially came into being in 1821 and was put onto a more formal footing in 1823, largely through the efforts of Joseph Severn, an English art student who had arrived in Italy in 1820 in the company of his friend, the poet John Keats, who was dying of tuberculosis. Severn set about raising funds for the new institution from various patrons, including the British Ambassador to Naples, William Richard Hamilton (1777-1859, not to be confused with the famous William Hamilton, at that date already dead), who contributed ¬£100, and advised him to open an \\"Academy investment fund\\". Severn contacted the President of the Royal Academy in London, Sir Thomas Lawrence for assistance. Although Lawrence declined any suggestion that the new body in Rome should be formally set up under the auspices the Royal Academy, he arranged for it to contribute some financial aid, donated to its funds personally and recruited other patrons. He also secured the backing of the king, George IV, who gave ¬£200 and officially approved the use of the name 'The British Academy of Arts in Rome'. The Academy was managed by a committee of seven artists. In its first year, 1823, the committee consisted of Charles Eastlake, Seymour Kirkup, Richard Evans, John Bryant Lane, and Richard Westmacott, Junior, as well as Severn himself. To house the Academy, Severn rented premises, comprising six rooms, at 18 Via Sant' Isidoro, which doubled as his own home and studio. The members of the Academy gathered in the evenings. There were sessions of life drawing, and opportunities to study anatomy. Artists associated with the Academy in its early years included JMW Turner, who stayed with Eastlake when he visited Italy in 1829, and George Richmond, who became involved with it in 1838. The Academy did not attract a great deal of public attention. In 1845 The Art-Union noted that \\"save to those who have resided in Rome, it is not generally known that there exists in that city any British Academy of Art\\", and in 1864 Stephen Watson Fullom wrote > It is a poor substitute for the French Academy, and falls very short of its > effect. That institution has been a home to most of the French artists, who > there were fellow-pupils, and moulded into a brotherhood. But the English > meet only occasionally, and part as strangers or rivals. Political troubles in Italy, began to limit the number of British artists interested in staying in Rome for any length of time, and Severn himself drifted away from the Academy, having become involved in diplomatic activities, eventually becoming British Consul. In 1861 the British Academy of Arts in Rome became the subject of interest to a Royal Commission, set up primarily to inquire into the running of the Royal Academy in London. It approved suggestions that a small branch of the Royal Academy could be set up in Rome, but made no recommendation that the existing Academy in Rome could be incorporated into it. During the later part of the 19th century the Academy, rehoused in an backstreet, fell further into obscurity, until it had something of a revival in 1895, when it moved to premises at 53B, Via Margutta. Under new rules, the British ambassador became, ex officio, the chairman of the Academy Committee. Italian artists were now encouraged to attend, and women were admitted. In 1911 the Academy was sidelined when the British School at Rome was established, funded by the Commissioners of the 1851 Exhibition and developed out of the British School of Archaeology at Rome, which had been set up ten years earlier. For the last 25 years of its existence the Academy's 'Honorary Director' was the Maltese sculptor Antonio Sciortino, who gave lessons in sculpture and headed the Academy unpaid. Amongst his innovations was to involve students from other countries in the British Commonwealth. The Academy was eventually closed due to increasing political tensions between Britain and Italy over the invasion of Abyssinia. In January 1936 all activities were 'indefinitely suspended' as a result of Fascist harassment and a consequent fall in student numbers. A box containing its archives was deposited with the British consulate, but could not later be traced.

Early life Moses was born to a family originating from northern Louisiana that relocated to Washington during the Second World War to work in wartime industries. After the war, Moses and her family moved to southern California. Moses received her associate degree in 1966, and bachelor's degree in sociology in 1968, both from San Bernardino Valley College. Inspired by a meeting with Margaret Mead, Moses chose to pursue anthropology for a doctorate degree, which she received in 1976, from the University of California, Riverside.McFadden Robert D. \\"More a Builder of Bridges Than a Typical Scholar\\" New York Times May 25, 1993 As a student, Moses participated actively in the Civil Rights Movement through the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).Bower, Beverly L.; Wolverton, Mimi \\"Answering the Call: African American Women in Higher Education Leadership\\" Pages 59‚Äì74 Academic career From 1976 to 1993, Moses taught at the collegiate level and conducted research at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona College, and California State University Dominguez Hills. At California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, Moses combined the Women's studies and Ethnic studies programs into a single interdisciplinary Department of Ethnic and Women's Studies. From 1982 to 1989, Moses served as the dean of the Cal State Polytec's College of Letters, Arts, and Social Sciences (CLASS). In 1988, Moses was appointed to the position of vice president of academic affairs at California State University, Dominguez Hills. In 1993, Moses relocated to New York City where she was appointed to the position of the 10th president of City College of New York of the City University of New York. She was the first woman to lead City College, CUNY's flagship campus. She has served as President of the American Anthropological Association (AAA) (1995‚Äì97). Moses has held a senior visiting research appointment at George Washington University in Washington D.C. (2000 to 2004). She co-authored with Carol Mukhopadhyay and Rosemary Henze, the book How Real is Race: a sourcebook on race, culture and biology.(2007, 2014). Since 2007, Moses had held the position of professor in the department of anthropology at the University of California, Riverside and Special Assistant to the Chancellor for Excellence and Diversity. In 2014, she was also a visiting professor at the University of Melbourne's Intercultural and Indigenous Studies Program. Moses' academic research is supported grants from the Ford Foundation, the National Science Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Humanities, for original research, including the Race: are we so different project (2007‚Äì2015). Professional recognition Moses has received The National Donna Shavlik Award for Leadership and Mentoring Women (2007) (ACE). She is a member of the college of fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2009), and a recipient of the Distinguished Research Lecturer Award from UC, Riverside (2015). Moses also received The Franz Boas Award for Distinguished Service to the Field of Anthropology (AAA) as Public Intellectual (2015), and The Dyason Fellowship to Support Collaborative Research and Innovation from the University of Melbourne (2016). City College of New York presidency On May 24, 1993, Moses was selected as the 9th president of City College of New York. At the time, comparisons were made between City College of New York and Dominguez Hills; both were considered inner-city public colleges with large minority and older student bodies. The only CUNY trustee to oppose her appointment was Herman Badillo, who later became the Chair of the CUNY trustees. During Moses tenure, City College continued to report high number of students failing placement tests and teacher certification exams. At the same time, Moses oversaw the renovation of six historic campus buildings, raised admissions standards, and introduced a doctoral program in biomedical engineering. Moses resigned as president of CCNY under pressure from the City University of New York trustees on July 2, 1999. An article in the New York Amsterdam News reported allegations of Moses' negative job ratings, including a failure to establish rapport with College deans, and the reported involvement of New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in her departure. Post- presidency Following her resignation, Moses served as President of the American Association for Higher Education from 2000 through 2003. She currently serves as Professor of Anthropology and the Associate Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Excellence at the University of California, Riverside.

After 1933, as Germany became a one party dictatorship, she and her husband Richard stayed in the country. She died in Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. Life=Early years Johanna Friederike Carillon was born into a family originally of Huguenot provenance in the Sachsenhausen quarter of Frankfurt am Main, on the south side of the river. She attended school locally at the \\"Souchay-Mittelschule\\" between 1882 and 1889, but received no higher education or training. Her father was a master tailor, and until her marriage in 1899 or 1900 Johanna lived \\"at home, helping with the housework\\". Marriage to Richard Tesch, another master tailor, produced in quick succession, three sons. Political engagement Following the birth of her youngest son, Carl, in 1902, Johanna began to engage in political activities, initially at a local level. Her political focus lay with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) which according to some sources she joined in 1902, although others contend that women were not permitted to join political parties in Germany till 1908, and she actually joined the SPD only in 1909. She campaigned for better educational opportunities for working class women and girls: she was co-founder in 1902, together with Lina Heiden and Henriette F√ºrth, of the \\"Education Association for Working Class Women and Girls\\" (Bildungsvereins f√ºr Frauen und M√§dchen der Arbeiterklasse‚Äù) From 1904 she also worked as a cashier at the Trades Union Office that had recently opened in Frankfurt's \\"All Saints Street\\" (\\"Allerheiligenstra√üe\\") to provide organisational support for union activities and to operate as a labour exchange. Another focus of her interest was the plight of the many female domestic servants working in Frankfurt: these often suffered from long hours and arbitrary working conditions. In addition, domestic servants were not permitted to join a trades union. In 1906 Tesch founded and became the first Chairwoman of the Frankfurt area \\"Association of Domestic and Office employees\\" (\\"Frankfurter Ortsgruppe des Zentralverbandes der Haus- und B√ºroangestellten\\"). Later that year, in November, Henrietta Tesch also founded the \\"Association for Female Domestic Employees\\" (‚ÄûVerein f√ºr weibliche Hausangestellte‚Äù), campaigning for the abolition of Germany's prescriptive Laws on Domestic Service and the introduction in the sector of free work contracts. In 1908 she took on the role of cashier, for which she was paid a salary, and in 1911 she took over from Mala Rudolph as Chairwoman of the Association. War Johanna Tesch lost her eldest son in the war that broke out in July 1914, but this was not the only reason that during the war she devoted her energies to providing support for the families of war victims. For four years between 1916 and 1920 she worked at the city's welfare office for war widows and orphans, and she also engaged in fund raising for the bereaved. In addition, it is recorded that in 1916 she became a member of the \\"Municipal Deputation for Lunatics and Epileptics\\" (\\"St√§dtische Deputation f√ºr Irre und Epileptische\\") National politics The revolutionary year that followed military defeat was marked by widespread social and political unrest, as well as the abdication of the emperor. 1919 also saw the birth of what came to be known (albeit not till 1929 when Adolf Hitler coined the term as an expression of contempt) as the Weimar Republic. Johanna Tesch moved from regional activism into national politics. She won a mandate to represent the electoral district of Hesse-Nassau (\\"19. Wakhlkreis\\") at the Constitutional Convention which met at Weimar between February and June 1919, producing a new Constitution (\\"Die Verfassung des Deutschen Reichs\\"). Her name was again included on the SPD party list for the national election in June 1920: although the SPD lost a third of its seats, it remained the largest party in the national assembly, and Tesch's name was high enough up on the party list to ensure her membership of the Reichstag between 1920 and May 1924, again representing a Hesse-Nassau electoral district(\\"21. Wakhlkreis\\"). Parliamentary records show that she contributed to debates on matters that included household welfare legislation (\\"Haushaltshilfengesetz\\") and the 1923 budget. The party lost further ground in the election of May 1924, and Johanna Tesch lost her seat in the chamber. By this time she had established a strong reputation as a public speaker, however, and for the next few years she gave public presentations on behalf of the SPD on matters such as housing poverty, taxation policy, educational questions and, ever more, on matters specific to women. Nazi Germany Johanna Tesch was a couple of months short of her sixtieth birthday when the Nazis took power early in 1933. Membership of political parties (other than of the Nazi Party) quickly became illegal, and Richard Tesch, her husband, as well as her youngest son, Carl, lost their jobs at the trades union printing works when the SPD party newspaper, \\"Volksstimme\\" (\\"People's Voice\\") was closed down in March 1933. In October 1935 Carl Tesch, who had engaged in (now illegal) trades union training work, was obliged to emigrate to Switzerland. Richard and Johanna Tesch lived on in retirement at their home in Frankfurt's recently built Riederwald quarter. Her former trades union colleague, Paul M√ºller, had fled to Switzerland in 1934, and later recalled that during 1938 Johanna travelled to visit her son in Switzerland, where she stayed for some months. During this time she was able to have meetings with a number of exiled German trades unionists and with leaders of the Swiss Social Democratic Party. This did nothing to endear her to the German government. But eventually she returned home to Nazi Germany. Death On 20 July 1944 an assassination attempt was made against Adolf Hitler. The dictator survived, but the leadership were badly unnerved: the r√©gime had already prepared a list of several thousand names of political adversaries, many of them surviving former left wing politicians from the Weimar era, to be used in the event of an escalation in political tension on the home front. The name of Johanna Tesch was on it. She was arrested on 22 August 1944 and taken to the concentration camp at Ravensbr√ºck. By this time her second son, Wilhelm Tesch, had already been killed in the war. Fellow inmates recalled that from the concentration camp she was permitted to write to her family regularly, using her letters, which were naturally subject to SS censorship, to reassure them that she was well. Nevertheless, she had been suffering from serious heart and kidney illness at the time of her arrest and her husband had been struggling, without success, to obtain her release on grounds of her poor health. Roughly 6 months later, on 10 March 1945, fellow inmates got hold of a pen and paper for her, and Johanna Tensch started to write her fare-well letter. Three days later she died, probably from a combination of the medical conditions from which she had been suffering at the time of her arrest and the malnutrition which was endemic in the concentration camp.

Built about 1850, it is the only known entirely unaltered district schoolhouse in the state, and is probably the only surviving municipal building from the tiny community, which was disincorporated in 1937. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The former town of Somerset is located in western Windham County, high in the Green Mountains. It is north of Searsburg, with its principal thoroughfare, Somerset Road, running north from Vermont Route 9 up the Deerfield River valley. The schoolhouse is located on the east side of this road in a small clearing, well north of the road's crossing of the river, and of the town cemetery. The building is a small rectangular wood frame structure, its gable roof perpendicular to the road. Its walls are finished in wooden clapboards, and the street-facing facade has an off-center door as its only significant element. The other sides of the building have simple sash windows with plain surrounds and vertical- board shutters. The building is set on 20th-century poured concrete piers, which are obscured by fieldstones placed around them. The interior consists of an entry area that includes a small cloakroom and an area that was probably used to store firewood, with most of the building taken up by the classroom. It is finished in wainscoting and plaster. At the time of the building's National Register listing, its interior was in a half-restored state, the result of an incomplete 1964 restoration attempt. When this school was built about 1850, the town's population was about 300, and most lived in a narrow strip of arable land on the east side of Mount Snow, that in 1869 became part of neighboring Dover. The school building survived Vermont's call for improved standards in schools in 1904 without any alteration, and was never fitted with electricity or plumbing. The town population suffered a significant decline in the early 20th century, due in part to the construction of Somerset Reservoir, and was disincorporated by the state in 1937.

The market was named after a type of coarse barley, called bigg, that was widely sold from the stalls. Other nearby markets included the Cloth Market and the Groat Market. The Bigg Market is located close to Newcastle Cathedral. Newcastle's old Town Hall, which was built between 1858 and 1863 was located in St Nicholas Square (between the Bigg Market and the Cloth Market) and served as the meeting place of Newcastle City Council between 1863 and 1968. More recently the Bigg Market has become known for its drinking culture and disorderly behaviour. It has more than 20 bars and restaurants housed in its 31 buildings, many of which are listed buildings in a state of some disrepair. In February 2015 the business improvement district company for Newcastle city centre received initial support of ¬£202,800 from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Approximately ¬£2.9M of combined funding is expected to be used to reinvigorate the Bigg Market by recreating the historic area in a commercially sustainable manner.

The guns were numbered '1' to '3' from front to rear. The ships carried two above- water twin sets of torpedo tubes; one mount was in the well deck between the forward superstructure and the forward gun and the other between the aft funnel and aft superstructure. In 1940, Aoi was converted into a patrol boat.

Her legal practice, Gartner & Associates Animal Law, is the first law firm in Canada to focus exclusively on animal law and the mediation of animal law disputes. Gartner serves as the Chair of the Ontario Bar Association‚Äôs Animal Law Executive Committee. She is a past member of the Ontario Bar Association‚Äôs Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Executive Committee. She sits on the Board of Advisors for Animal Justice Canada. Gartner is also a member of the Jackman Humanities Institute (JHI) working group, ‚ÄòAnimals in the law and Humanities‚Äô at the University of Toronto. Gartner is a member in good standing with The Law Society of Upper Canada.  Early Life and Animal Welfare  Gartner‚Äôs journey into animal welfare began as a shelter volunteer. In 2010, a chance encounter led her to an abandoned dog at a Toronto municipal shelter. She regularly walked him, but as days passed, and no one came to claim or adopt him, she realized the implications. She convinced her mother to meet him and that day, he was adopted and found a home. Saving this one life was her impetus to commit to change the legal system, and work to put an end to the killing of adoptable companion animals. In 2013, Gartner completed her Master of Laws degree in ADR at Osgoode Hall Law School. Her research combined ADR methods with the field of animal law, and she coined the term, ACAP, Acceptable Companion Animal Philosophy, a balanced approach that recognizes the inherent value and sentience of companion animals, and proposes consensus building as a strategy to amend animal legislation towards ending the plight of homeless companion animals.  Career  From 2009-2010, Gartner worked for the Ontario Ministry of Labour, in the Dispute Resolution Services Branch, as a mediator intern. In 2014, Gartner launched Gartner & Associates Animal Law, a law firm that represents clients with animal-related disputes, focuses on protecting animals‚Äô interests, and advancing the field of animal law. Gartner continues to lobby provincial and federal governments to amend animal legislation to improve the conditions for animals across Canada and abroad.

The 15-19 age group is the largest in Mongolia; in 2009 about 40% of the population was under 19 years old. Estimated population growth rates as of 2014 were reported as increasing by 1.37%. The steady increase in youth will enlarge the already large proportion of working-aged individuals and create new opportunities to build human capital and facilitate economic development. Young Mongolian women prepare for an archery shootIn order to address Mongolia's economic future, Mongolia's Parliament adopted the State Population Development Policy in 2004 to confront development issues facing Mongolian youth. This policy and the Mongolia National Programme on Adolescents and Youth Development defined youth as those from ages 15 to 34 years and aims to provide opportunities and services that build youth into well developed citizens. Mongolia is in the process of transitioning from its status as a developing country to a nation with a developing economy. According to the Human Development Index, conditions in Mongolia have been improving in recent years, but its ranking on the Human Poverty Index has dropped further due to the privatization of the economic sector. Mongolia's political structure has changed frequently since its founding in 1206. In the most recent transition to democracy in 1992, Mongolia incorporated policies directed towards youth. Mongolia became one of the first countries to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990 and signed the second and third optional protocols in 2000 and 2013 respectively. Many of Mongolia‚Äôs laws and policies attempt to protect and better the lives of Mongolian youth. The legal age of majority occurs at 18, wherein Mongolian young adults are able to vote and assume legal authority. The transition from a Soviet satellite state to a sovereign nation in 1992 fueled major structural changes in Mongolian youth lives. Access to education, employment, and health care has increased.  Education  The transition to a market based economy has impacted the Mongolian education system and labor market. The formal school system comprises pre-school, primary, secondary and higher education. Based on Soviet models, the Mongolian education system requires 10 years of schooling.The current system has a 4+4+2 structure; four years of primary education, four years of basic or incomplete secondary education, and complete secondary school for the final two years. The Mongolian Constitution, Education Law, and the Law on Primary and Secondary Education dictates that eight years of compulsory education are free.  Males verse Females  Before 1990, education attainment was higher than the current rate. Rural and urban boys are prone to dropping out of school to obtain low skill and low wage employment. The World Health Organization found in 2007 that 8,775 school-aged children were not in school. Of these 8,775 children, 59.1% of drop-outs were boys and of this percentage 91.3% were boys from rural areas. Rural boys are two times more likely to receive no education at all or have below compulsory education over girls due to the need for boys to help their family herd cattle. The gender parity index has revealed that more boys are enrolled in primary education (GPI=0.97) but more girls are enrolled in secondary (GPI=1.08) and tertiary education (GPI=1.54). Parents are more inclined to send young girls to school in order to secure their futures whereas young boys are more likely to inherit family property by surviving in harsh working conditions.  Urban verses Rural  Multiple disparities exist between educational attainment in rural and urban settings. In rural areas, 6.4% of youth receive no education, which is three times higher compared to urban youth. The transition to a market system is the cause of higher illiteracy and drop out rates because many poor, rural households experienced economic hardships after the closure of cooperative farms. Regional constraints affect the availability of education, most commonly in rural areas. Statistical analysis has found a high correlation rate between parents and children‚Äôs educational attainment. Human capital gained and transferred from the educational level of parents is directly correlated with that of their children. Youth with vast human capital are able to move to larger aimag centers to continue their studies. Most higher secondary education and colleges are only available in large city‚Äôs like Mongolia‚Äôs capital Ulaanbaatar.  Labor and employment  Rural young men tend to their horses before herding cattle. Under the Labor Law and the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor, Mongolian youth can legally work when they are 15 years old with parental permission, and those aged 14 can begin vocational training and employment. Labor codes dictate that the working week is 40 hours and 36 hours for those under 18. Culturally appropriate jobs are rarely found by Mongolian youth, which translates into high youth unemployment rates in urban areas and very low productivity in rural areas. Private sector growth has been slow after the transition to capitalism, which has increased youth unemployment in urban areas and consequently many households resort to youth leaving school and taking employment in the agricultural sector. The 2006 School-to-Work Transition Survey revealed that of the youth surveyed 22.8% were unemployed and were registered with the employment office. In the same survey 66.1% of youth were employed as unpaid family workers, 23.9% had paid work and 8.3% were self-employed, 0.9% had a part-time job and 0.9% were employed but absent from work. Only one out of two jobs are wage paying jobs and are more commonly held by urban youth. Young women are more likely to be self-employed in urban areas, whereas young men are more frequently self-employed in rural locations. Gender gaps in employment opportunities are present, in which young men have a higher unemployment rate compared to female counterparts. Women at younger ages have lower unemployment rates due to higher educational attainment, and consequently higher rates of long-term unemployment. Academic training is preferred over technical education and vocational skills which has resulted in unfilled positions in trades. In total, unemployment rates were 15.3% lower for youth with vocational degrees compared to 11.6% of youth with tertiary degrees. Underage employment is common in rural communities particularly in the herding and mining sectors. Underage urban youth may work in poor working conditions generally in informal markets such as manufacturing. In 2009 56,000 5-17 year olds were engaged in child labor, 43,000 were below the minimum working age of 15 and 13,000 15-17 year olds were involved in hazardous work.  Health  Issues related to sexual and reproductive health, tobacco and alcohol usage, infectious disease and environmental related health issues are major concerns for Mongolian youth. All medical and hospital services are free and health care is under the control of state. The World Health Organization established and supports nine adolescent-friendly clinics around Mongolia. The clinic staff is trained on the adolescent orientation package which promotes preventive messages on psychosocial, nutritional, diseases prevention and sexual aspects of health. Although the clinics were youth friendly, the clinics lacked space, were not easy to reach, and were not open during convenient times for youth to access. The WHO 2002 reports show that 34% of youth surveyed were afraid that the health services received at these clinics were inadequate, 57.3% of the same youth surveyed reported that health care workers were inattentive to their health concerns and problems as well as giving poor services.  Sexual and Reproductive Health  The 2008 Reproductive Health Survey revealed that 16.7% of 15-19 year olds surveyed responded that they had had sexual intercourse. 5.0% had their first sexual intercourse between 14 and 16 and 11.7% between the ages 17‚Äì19. This is in contrast to the Reproductive Health Survey of 2003, no adolescents reported having sexual intercourse for the first time between the ages of 11 and 13. The average age of first sexual intercourse for males was 16.8 and 18.9 for females. These results were similar for youth in both rural and urban areas. The World Health Organization surveys found that youth's knowledge about contraceptives was high while use was low. Of the 1044 youth surveyed between the ages of 15 and 19 reported that 92.7% had knowledge of any modern method, 3.7% were currently using male condoms, IUDs and pills, and 33.5% knew that contraceptives were distributed without charge. The usage of contraceptives among females who reported having sexual intercourse during the month before the survey reported that 31.8% used condoms, 56.8% of those who were never married used condoms, and 39.7% of urban females used condoms compared to 16.7% of rural females. Legislation regarding youth sexual and reproductive health is prominent as seen by the Criminal Code of 2002 and the Health Act of 1998. Criminal Code of 2002 states that sexual intercourse with a minor under the age of 16 is punishable and abortion in nonmedical conditions or abortion by a nonprofessional is punishable. According to the Health Act of 1998 \\"abortion performed only in medical conditions that meet requirements and by licensed medical specialists as specified in the Law\\" are permitable.  Tobacco and Alcohol  The 2010 Global School based Student Health Survey report found that 82.9% of males and 70.5% of females students age 13-15 had smoked cigarettes before the age of 14. 64.2% of those sampled in the same survey had been exposed to second-hand smoke at home. Of current youth smokers, 86.5% wanted to stop smoking while 65.3% of these same youth had received help to do so. The same survey found that 80% of youth agreed that smoking should be banned from public places. Under the new Tobacco Law of 2005, adolescents are forbidden from buying and selling tobacco. Legislation governing alcohol was amended in 2000, banning the sale of alcohol to minors under the age of 21. The 2005 Global School based Student Health survey and the 2000 Adolescents' Needs Assessment Survey reported 15-19 year olds had the highest mean alcohol consumption wherein urban adolescents drank twice as much alcohol as rural adolescents. The 2010 Global School based Student Health Survey revealed that 79.4% of youth had consumed alcohol once a month or less. Of the respondents aged 15‚Äì19, 70.8% of males and 86.7% of females had not drunk in the last year, which had dropped significantly since the 2005 report.  Infectious Disease  The World Health Organization has classified Mongolia as a low-prevalence STI country, yet the risk environment is increasing. Roughly half of the population is under the age of 23, which makes sexually active youth the most vulnerable population. The United Nations Volunteer program, STI & HIV/AIDS Prevention among Vulnerable Groups in Mongolia 2007-2009, reports that prevention and awareness methods were not tailored to target sexually active youth. The main goal of this project was to reduce risky sexual behavior and develop programs that address issues of prevention for youth. The 2010 United Nations General Assembly Special Session reports found that over half of the adolescents reported that they felt that they did not have any risk of contracting HIV and one fourth considered themselves to be at low risk.  Environmental Health  The Systematic Review of the Impact of the Environment on Health in Mongolia revealed that poor environmental management and behaviors have increased Mongolian children's exposure to environmental risk factors and adverse health outcomes. The results from the study indicate that respiratory diseases and neurodevelopment disorders among youth are common due to significant exposure to outdoor and indoor air pollution, metals, tobacco smoke and other chemical toxins.  Ethnicity  Mongolia has been ruled by various nomadic empires, the Qing dynasty and the Soviet Union. The blending of many cultures has influenced youth identities with their ethnicities and traditional nomadic lifestyles. The transition to a market economy has brought about rapid urbanization and a change in modern-day youth identities. Mongolia's demographics reveal that Mongol groups make up approximately 95% of the population. There are over 20 different subgroupings of Mongol ethnicities and tribal affilications. The largest ethnic group is composed of Khalkha, Buryats and Oirats Mongols. After the dissolution of Soviet control, nearly half of Mongolian Kazakhs youth and their families left Mongolia to find new sources of economic livelihood. Many of these youth were traditional livestock herders and were expected to conform to gender roles; the move to Kazakhstan proved to be dismal and by 2000 over one third that migrated came back to Mongolia. Steven Harrell's book, Cultural Encounters on China's Ethnic Frontiers, reveals identification with Mongol heritage differs for rural and urban youth. Pastoral rural Mongol youth identify their nomadic way of life was a basic foundation of Mongolian identity. Boundaries between non-monogols and the Han were created by rural youth through identification with the Mongolian language. Urban youth viewed and required ethnic education as a way to create a cultural space and to understand their common mythical history and family ties to the Mongolian population as a whole.

The film's sets were designed by art director Ben Carr√©. Plot In France, a beautiful young model named Trilby meets three Bohemians (Little Billee, the Laird, and Taffy) and they all become friends. Trilby and Billee fall in love, but their happiness is thwarted by an evil mesmerist named Svengali, who becomes obsessed with having Trilby for himself. On the night Little Billee is to propose to Trilby, Svengali kidnaps her via hypnotism and takes her away with him to England where he uses his supernatural powers to turn her into a talented singer. Svengali must use all his will power to maintain a hold over the girl, and the stress begins to take a toll on his heart. When he suffers an attack, Trilby appears to become her old self again, but when he recovers, she lapses back into zombie mode. Svengali finally dies, and Trilby's voice reverts to her former gruff form, and the audience boos her off the stage (in the redone ending). Trilby returns to normalcy and the last scene shows her reunited with her friends with a smile on her lips. The title card reads \\"A promise of good old times again\\". The original version of the film had Trilby dying during the last scene (as it occurs in the novel), and this version premiered in New York City at the 44th Street Theatre on September 6, 1915. It went into general release on September 20, 1915, with her death scene intact. In 1917, when the film was re-released, the ending was altered with newly filmed footage so that Trilby remained alive in the film's finale. So technically, two different versions of this film existed. Cast * Wilton Lackaye as Svengali * Clara Kimball Young as Trilby O'Ferral * Paul McAllister as Gecko * Phyllis Neilson-Terry * Chester Barnett * James Young Reception Advertisement promoting the film's nudity despite it only shown using long shots on two intertitles The film did not receive great reviews. Variety said Wilton Lackey's performance as Svengali was \\"a distinct disappointment\\", opining that the actor \\"ludicrously underplayed\\" the role and was too overweight for the part, a fact made even more obvious by the producers putting him in clothes that were too small for him. They also felt Clara Kimball Young was too old for the part (she was 25 at the time). Critics over the years have regarded the 1923 film version to be superior, according to author and critic Christopher Workman. Censorship Consistent with the novel, the film shows Trilby while modeling in the nude, but only from the back in two long shots shown as stills on intertitles. In other modeling shots, her nudity is implied, an artist's easel blocking direct views. Although nudity in film in 1915 was rare, often sensational, and typically cut by censors, the National Board of Motion Picture Censorship passed the film. As the Board's decisions were nonbinding, censorship boards in cities and states with stricter rules were still free to cut these scenes.

It stars Brendan Fehr, Holly Dignard, Jodelle Ferland, Ryan Grantham and Rob LaBelle. Set primarily in Alaska, the film follows the members of a family caught amidst a natural disaster. As the permafrost thaws, subterranean rivers of liquid methane and disastrous earthquakes are unleashed, threatening to lead the Earth to a catastrophic end.  Plot  Ice Quake is an action film about the Alaskan landscape Under the permafrost, organic materials have been rotting for thousands of years and the compound is very deadly to the planet. As the permafrost thaws, volatile liquid methane and gases are released which causes a succession of destructive earthquakes. A family ends up going to this Alaskan landscape on the hunt for a Christmas tree, hoping to have fun, and unfortunately finds out firsthand how deadly this can be. As they are exploring these mountains, their dog runs away for an unknown reason and soon after there is an explosion of gas from underneath the ice that ends up causing an avalanche. The family has to run for their lives. The father takes charge and tries to lead them to safety when suddenly another tremor occurs. This time, it causes the ground to split open, creating a deep ravine dividing the family apart - the parents on one side and two children on the other. They cannot group back together as there is dangerous gas flowing out the ravine so the father tell them to go to the summit and wait for rescue. The children head up to top to then find out there is a storm on their way causing more concern. The younger brother suggests they keep moving until they can stop at a safe place As this chaos is going on, the military based around the mountain are investigating the tremors. At first believed the tremors were being caused by earthquakes but then discover that there have been no tectonic movements and nothing has showed on the Richter scale. They then thought it could have been a volcano eruption causing this but also ends up to be false. It is a race against time to stop these harmful liquids and gases before it leads to a catastrophic explosion that threatens the planet.  Production  Ice Quake is the Syfy Cable television company's own holiday TV movie production. The filming of the movie took place in three different locations. * Maple Ridge, British Columbia, Canada * Agassiz, British Columbia, Canada * Hemlock Valley, British Columbia, Canada In the production and post-production other companies helped with Syfy's work. Movie Central was one of the main companies that helped with this production of this film. Northwest Digital worked with the production teamto create a quality visual experience, along with The Exile Visual Effects Studio who provided the visual effects to create the perfect atmosphere for a holiday disaster. Pinewood Sounds was in charge of the movie's sound effects and recording.  Characters and Casting = Characters  * Michael Webster, played by Brendan Fehr, is a loving husband, father and a scientist studying the effects of the Alaska landscape. He is a geologist who works for the military and is a specialist in his field. He is also the husband of Emily and the father of two children, namely Tia and Shane. * Emily Webster, played by Holly Dignard, is the beautiful wife of Michael and the loving mother of Tia and Shane. * Colonel Bill Hughes, played by Victor Garber, is Michael's superior in the military, and works with Michael and his family to prevent a methane explosion from wiping out planet Earth. * Tia Webster, played by Jodelle Ferland, is the teenage daughter of Michael and Emily and the sister of Shane. * Shane Webster, played by Ryan Grantham, is the young son of Michael and Emily, and the brother of Tia. * Bruce Worthington, played by Rob LaBelle * Ram, played by Nicholas Carrella  Music  The movie has two credited soundtracks. As a holiday TV movie both of the songs are traditional Christmas carols. In the movie, we can listen to them as a performance by the Occidental Glee Club. Standard listing= Reception  The film's opening scenes has been mentioned in many reviews due to their weird nature: \\"The opening of the movie (and first couple of deaths) has a man for no reason at all doing geological research dressed in full Santa gear. Cue Santa to then get blown up in an ice geyser. It‚Äôs not as great as it sounds I‚Äôm afraid but it‚Äôs certainly a startling opening.\\" \\"The opening of \\"Ice Quake\\" is either going to make you smile or grimace as we see Santa on a snowmobile! It turns out Santa is actually party of a military geologist team who was meant to be playing Santa at a community event but has had to head up to the mountain to place some sensors with another man. But there is more because lo and behold a crack forms in the snow between them, something which you may have seen in a ton of other disaster movies but we get a bit of a switch up on the obvious, a frankly predictable one as one of the men leaps across the crevice. The thing is that these opening scenes are indicative of \\"Ice Quake\\" as the movie is predictable but with some entertaining twists.\\" From a film-lover's point of view, the movie has received mixed ratings: \\"Ice Quake isn‚Äôt quite the disaster of a movie compared with other Syfy made-for-TV movies but it‚Äôs still not very good. It was more interesting to see Victor Garber‚Äôs lack of interest than even those whom seemed to actually try. The Blu-ray doesn‚Äôt have much to offer with average video and audio transfers.\\" \\"Drastic shifts in the Alaskan permafrost have begun to cause earth-shattering quakes and ice geysers, trapping an archaeologist and his family out in the cold during their winter retreat. For what it is, ICE QUAKE stacks up against other low-budget, made-for-television disaster pictures like ARCTIC BLAST or METEOR STORM in delivering cheap thrills and moderate effects on a meager budget. Disaster is always the operative term here, since the plot inconsistencies, stagnant characters, and poor computerization have become characteristic of the genre, but director Paul Ziller has done everything he can to try and make this passable entertainment. The sequence of events are predictable and contrived as always, but this keeps the action moving at a decent pace throughout. TV's Brendan Fehr and Victor Garber both do what they can to attach some emotionality to the characters. These low-budget mockbusters wouldn't continue to be made if there was not already a built-in audience, so fans of THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW or ARCTIC BLAST should enjoy!\\"  Release  Ice Quake was first shown on the Syfy channel on December 11, 2010 in the U.S. and was released on DVD on July 2, 2012. Since then it has been shown on television and released on DVD in numerous countries including the UK, Germany and Italy. It has also been released on Blu-ray.

The museum complex, situated in the heart of the tourist centre of Ghent, comprises an imposing 18th-century mansion and a modern wing. The museum possesses a comprehensive and trend-setting collection of Belgian design, supported by international top-class objects. Its collection includes everything from the Art Nouveau of Henry van de Velde to contemporary avant- garde design.  History  Stairs in the 1992 building of Design Museum Gent Design Museum Gent originates from a private initiative of a group of industrials and art lovers who united themselves in 1903 in the ‚ÄòUnion des Arts Industriels et D√©coratifs‚Äô and created a ‚ÄòMus√©e des Mod√®les‚Äô. Initially, the collection consisted of some hundred fine examples of furniture, complemented by extensive subcollections of ceramics, copper and bronze, furniture fragments and a large textile collection. These models were housed in the Ghent municipal academy, situated in the Sint-Margrietstraat. Owing to purchases in the various pavilions during the Ghent 1913 World Exhibition and further extension of the collection, a new accommodation became a necessity. In 1922 the museum moved to Hotel de Coninck on the Jan Breydelstraat, which the city of Ghent had bought a couple of years earlier. In 1951, under the leadership of a new director, Adelbert Van de Walle, three shows called the National Salons for Modern Social Furniture were organised. These took place in 1955, 1956, and 1957. They invited local manufacturers to exhibit their furniture showcased in rooms as fictitious domestic environments and to take orders placed by visitors, thus facilitating the distribution of modern, affordable design. By 1958, the financial burden had become too much for the Association of Industrial and Decorative Arts, and the city of Ghent took over the administration and management of the museum. Between 1958 and 1973, the museum was closed due to renovation works. Its reopening was followed by an expansion plan, ensuing in the inauguration of a new wing in 1992, which accommodates both a selection of the modern and contemporary design collection and temporary exhibitions. The new extension was designed by architect Willy Verstraete and was officially opened in May 1992. In the modern part of the building, a huge hydraulic lift in the central section can be used to make the floors adaptable. The current policy of the museum puts greater focus on Belgian design from 1970.  Collection  The museum collection has evolved from 17th and 18th century applied arts towards modern and contemporary design from 1860 till now. The objects prior to 1860 provide the historic basis on which modern and contemporary design are engrafted. Design Museum Gent prefers to use a broad definition of design, based on a series of criteria that can - to a more or lesser degree - be found in a design product: contemporaneity, innovation, ergonomics, durability and aesthetic relevance. Both serial products and unique objects can comply with these requirements. Innovation can relate to form, function, material and production techniques. Purchases and exhibitions are focused on 20th century and contemporary creations. Extension of the collection The collection of Design Museum Gent took shape in three phases: * ln a first phase, between 1903 and 1930, the museum possesses a collection and a corresponding library in view of a 'Mus√©e des Mod√®les', paying close attention to a large variety of furniture types dating back to 1600 - 1800 and some particular subcollections such as Art Nouveau, Asian objects, textile and French Art Deco. * Between 1930 and 1974, the museum collection is barely extended, not in the least owing to its closure between 1958 and 1973. * The third and final phase between 1974 and 2013 is characterised by an impressive expansion of the international design collection with major purchases and donations. From 1977 onwards, the then museum curator (and later museum director) Lieven Daenens acquires significant Belgian Art Nouveau ensembles designed by Henry van de Velde, Victor Horta and Paul Hankar. ln 1987, interior and furniture designer Pieter De Bruyne bequeaths his archives as a designer and lecturer, along with a comprehensive library and various furniture. ln the same year, the passionate collector N.F. Havermans legates his rich collection of Art Nouveau and Art Deco glassware, ceramics and silver. Between 1980 and 2000, the collection is significantly expanded with national and international designers. The Italian radical design by the designer collectives Alchimia and Memphis (including Mendini, Branzi and Sottsass) constitutes a major extension of the museum collection. The appointment of Katrien Laporte (2013 -) as new museum director initiates a catching-up process with regard to the 1970 onwards collection of Belgian design. Profile of the collection In the period starting from 1975, the collection has been expanded to nearly 22,000 objects. The collection includes applied arts and design dating from 1450 to present, is regionally, nationally and internationally diversified and highly consistent. It is the only collection in Belgium to display an intelligible and coherent image of trend- setting design starting from Art Nouveau. Moreover, it includes several unique top-class objects of national and international design. The historic subcollection (1450-1900) stands out because of its broad range of 18th century furniture. The proto-design from 1860 onwards is the step-up towards the modern design collection, which is initiated by the impressive Art Nouveau collection and continues till today. The collection mainly includes Western European design, with a distinct presence of Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Scandinavia and Italy. The collection focuses especially on interior-oriented design from private residences and offices. =Proto-design= The museum possesses a small collection of objects designed by Christopher Dresser. The furniture of the Vienna furniture companies Thonet and Kohn are at the dawn of modern design as well. =Art Nouveau= Design Museum Gent is internationally praised for its excellent collection of Belgian Art Nouveau made by Paul Hankar, Gustave Serrurier-Bovy, Victor Horta, Henry van de Velde, Philippe Wolfers and Alfred William Finch. These Belgian designers are accompanied by foreign top designers such as Louis Majorelle, Emile Gall√©, Ren√© Lalique, Daum, Richard Riemerschmid, Josef Hoffmann, Otto Wagner and Georg Jensen. =Art Deco= Next to French glassware by Daum, Lalique, Marcel Goupy, Maurice Marinot, Jean Sala, Charles Schneider, Gabriel Argy- Rousseau and copper vases by Jean Dunand and Claude Linossier, the museum also possesses ceramic vases of Llorens Artigas, Fernand Rum√®be and services by Jean Luc and Georg Jensen. Quite peculiar is the rich furniture collection conceived by the unsurpassed Ghent architect Albert Van huffel, designer of the renowned Koekelberg Basilica. The museum also hold his archives. Another remarkable collection item is the ‚ÄòGioconda‚Äô service designed by Philippe Wolfers in 1925 for the exhibition ‚ÄòExposition des Arts D√©coratifs et lndustriels‚Äô in Paris. Services of the companies Wolfers and Delheid belong to the top-class of Belgian Art Deco silverware. =Modernism= The modernism of Le Corbusier, Alvar Aalto, Marcel Breuer, Christa Ehrlich, Poul Henningsen and Wilhelm Wagenfeld is diametrically opposed to the sumptuous Art Deco. The Flemish architect-designers Gaston Eysselinck and Huib Hoste are worthy companions among this select international party. =Organic Design= The collection also includes a fine selection of modern design dating from the period 1945 - 1965 with furniture of Belgian designers such as Willy Van der Meeren, Alfred Hendrickx, Emiel Veranneman, Pieter De Bruyne, Jules Wabbes and Christophe Gevers, of American designers Charles and Ray Eames and Florence Knoll and of the Scandinavian designers Arne Jacobsen, Hans Wegner, Verner Panton, Yrj√∂ Kukkapuro and Kristian Vedel. The Netherlands and Scandinavia are well represented by glassware of the companies Royal Leerdam Crystal (Andries Dirk Copier), Orrefors (Sven Palmqvist), Venini and Iittala (Tapio Wirkkala). Henning Koppel (Georg Jensen), Carlo Scarpa (Cleto Munari) and Lino Sabattini (Christofle) put elegant silverware on the table. The Belgian headquarters of Tupperware Europe, with chief designers Bob Daenen and Vic Cautereels, are responsible for countless solid kitchen objects. =Anti-Design= The museum possesses an extensive ensemble of the Italian Anti-Design collectives Studio Alchimia and Memphis, represented by Ettore Sottsass, Alessandro Mendini, Michele de Lucchi, Matteo Thun, Marco Zanini and Nathalie Du Pasquier. =Postmodernism= The first postmodern piece of furniture, the 1975 Chantilly cupboard designed by Pieter De Bruyne, is an icon in the Belgian design collection. Reputed foreign designers such as Michael Graves, Bo≈ôek ≈†√≠pek, Richard Meier, Hans Hollein and Aldo Rossi make the picture complete. =International design= Renowned designers such as Ron Arad, Toyo Ito, Hella Jongerius, Peter Opsvik, Barbara Nanning, Marc Newson, Philippe Starck, Marcel Wanders and Frantisek Vizner give an international allure to the collection. =Modern and contemporary Belgian design= Design Museum Gent boasts a range of more recent and contemporary Belgian designers such as Maarten Van Severen, Hans De Pelsmacker, Lachaert & d'Hanis, Marc Supply, Xavier Lust, Pol Quadens, Quinze & Milan, Fabiaan Van Severen, Weyers & Borms and Dirk Wynants. Ceramics in the contemporary collection are by Piet Stockmans, Tjok Dessauvage, Arthur Vermeiren, Rik Vandewege and Ann Van Hoey. Glassware is coming from the ovens of the Antwerp collective L'Anverre and Carine Neutjens. Silverware is designed by Jean Lemmens and Siegfried De Buck, Nedda El-Asmar and David Huycke. Samsonite (designer Erik Sijmons), Hedgren and Kipling (designer Xavier Kegels) luggage is also included in the collection. Recent acquisitions of the younger Belgian generation, represented by Muller Van Severen, Maarten De Ceulaer and Ben Storms, cast a glance at the future.

Worshippers inside the synagogue became aware of the attack when a man covered in blood staggered into the room and someone shouted, \\"There's a terrorist.\\" Some worshipers assisted the wounded man while the other men who had been praying rushed to close the door, leaning against it to prevent the attacker from entering. When the terrorist ceased attempting to shove the door open, they rushed out with makeshift weapons to try to subdue him.

He founded Theatre Arts Workshop in 1966, and Bhartendu Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1975 and the repertory company of Bhartendu Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1980. He has blended artistic concepts of the East and the West, and the traditional and the modern.  Life  Raj Bisaria was born in Lakhimpur Kheri, Uttar Pradesh, on 10 November 1935, the son of the late P.L. Bisaria and Leelavati Singh. He was educated at Colvin Taluqdars' College and Lucknow University, Lucknow, and retired as a senior professor of English Literature from Lucknow University. In 1969, Bisaria married the Kiran Kuchawan; the couple have a daughter, Rajina. The initiative was taken by his University Theatre Group formed in 1962. Four years later, Raj Bisaria founded the Theatre Arts Workshop (TAW) in 1966 and Bhartendu Academy of Dramatic Arts, Government of Uttar Pradesh, in 1975, and the repertory company of BNA in 1981.http://bna.noetic.in/english/founder_director.htm My affair with theatre continues He is the first man from Uttar Pradesh to have been awarded a Padma Shree for work in modern theatre and his contribution towards the growth of theatre in India. Raj Bisaria tried to infuse a new sense of consciousness with regard to the dramatic and performing arts and aesthetic awareness of the performing arts in northern India. Bisaria was removed as the honorary director of Bhartendu Academy of Dramatic Arts, and he was assaulted twice, first in 1988 and then in 1995.  Theatre training  External theatre training for Raj Bisaria included an invitation by the British Council, London, to visit the UK and train at the British Drama League (now the British Theatre Association) as a producer, drama instructor, and adjudicator, in 1969.  Director and designer  Raj Bisaria is also a stage director with a grounding in both the western classics and contemporary dramatic works. Raj Bisaria tried to ensure that the dramatic and performing arts conform to a professional discipline and communicate through a new aesthetic medium. His plays are concerned with men-women relationships and social issues of special concern to him. Through the productions of European and Indian plays since 1966, Bisaria presented a wide spectrum of contemporary world drama as director and designer. Largely using his own devices and creative expression he began his work in English and then to use Hindustani as the spoken medium of expression from 1973. He has encouraged folk theatre in the Uttar Pradesh local genre known as the Nautanki. In 1972, he took a major shift in his emphasis from modern Euro-American productions to plays in Hindi of modern Indian playwrights: Mohan Rakesh, Badal Sircar, Adya Rangacharya, Dharamvir Bharti, Shesh and Mohit Chatterjee. Over the years, Raj Bisaria produced and directed over 75 theatre productions. In addition he supervised, produced/directed a large number of productions in the Bhartendu Academy of Dramatic Arts from 1975 to 1986 and later on; and also in National School of Drama and for its Repertory Company. His major productions have included Maxwell Anderson's Barefoot in Athens; Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Macbeth, Othello, King Lear; George Bernard Shaw's Candida; Harold Pinter's The Caretaker; Sartre's In Camera; Ionesco's The Lesson; Strindberg's Father, Jean Anouilh's Antigone; and various plays of Chekhov, Ionesco, Tennessee Williams, Shaffer and others. His major productions of Indian plays have included Dharamvir Bharati's Andha Yug, Badal Sircar's Baqi Itihas, Adya Rangacharya's Suno Janmejaya, Elkunchwar's Garbo, Mohan Rakesh's Aadhe-Adhure and Mohit Chatterjee's Guinea Pig. Problems Critics found Ann Jellicoe‚Äôs The Knack revolting and Sartre‚Äôs In Camera and Ionesco‚Äôs The Lesson too demanding. The TAW team has a group of permanent actors, with other interested parties for different productions. Lack of men and material compelled Raj Bisaria to stage Othello with only four characters. And yet it was a memorable performance. The persistent efforts of Raj Bisaria have yielded results.  Actor  As an actor of stage, radio, television and films, Bisaria was known since 1978 as a major actor of the Doordarshan. As a theatre actor Raj Bisaria did significant roles in several of TAW's English and Hindi stage productions, films and television. He played leading roles in at least two dozen plays in English and Hindi, such as: * Sheridan's The School for Scandal * Pirandello's Right You Are (if you think so) * Shaw's Candida * Coward's Nude With Violin * Sartre's In Camera * Shaffer's Black Comedy * Tom Stoppard's The Real Inspector Hound * Osborne's Look Back in Anger * Orton's Loot * Chatterjee's Guinea Pig * Badal Sircar's Baqi Itihas * Elkunchawar's Garbo * Matkari's Akela Jeev Sadashiv * Shakespeare's King Lear directed by Amal Allana * Biwi Natiyon Wali * Mai Wo Nahi directed by Sushil Kumar Singh * Manno Bhandari's 'Apka Banti' directed by Amal Allana * Kamleshwar's 'Ret Pe Likhe Naam' * Badal Sircar's Pagla Ghoda directed by Rajan Sabbarwal *'Raj Se Swaraj' directed by Amal Allana * Muzzaffar Ali's Aagman * Govind Nilhani's Aaghat  Impresario  As impresario Raj Bisaria's widening interests had led to the introduction of Irshad Panjatan's mime in 1967 and next year the presentation of the Murray Louis Dance Company of USA. This broadening activity and involvement with the performing arts also saw a classical dance performance by Sonal Mansingh, in 1970, the d√©but of Om Shivpuri's Dishanter group in 1972, a painting exhibition of R.S. Bisht's miniature in 1973, Richard Schechners' environmental theatre presentation of Mother Courage and Her Children from New York in 1976, and the Annapolis Brass Quintet in 1981 - all arranged at the initiative of Raj Bisaria's TAW.  Educationalist  As a dramaturge his primary concern was an effort to resolve the problem of creative reinterpretation of the classical and theatrical art of his region to find itself in contemporary social relevance. He structured Theatre Training Programmes in U.P. through workshops and certificate and diploma courses in North India from 1966. He founded in 1975 for the Government of U.P. India's second school of drama: Bhartendu Natya Akademi-Bhartendu Academy of Dramatic Arts. Raj Bisaria is interested as an actor, director and theatre teacher in the system of Konstantin Stanislavski and Bertolt Brecht. The Russian theatre practitioer provides the core of Raj Bisaria's directing and pedagogy in contemporary Indian theatre. Later, he developed his own system of holistic acting, which produced three generations of actors and directors.  Theatre Arts Workshop  In December 1963, ten members organized a theatre play and put through a programme ‚Äì An Evening with Young Actors ‚Äì which included Edna St. Vincent Millay‚Äôs Aria da Capo, scenes from Twelfth Night and Macbeth, The Valiant and a dramatized reading of Hamlet, and a dramatisation of T. S. Eliot's poem \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.\\" Raj Bisaria produced and directed all the play, and he decided to register a theatre group with a managing body, using local talent. The theatre group was bilingual (English and Hindi), and concerned itself with encouraging interest in theatre-craft and developing a greater awareness of theatre, an ability to appreciate drama, and a firmer grap of ideas and technique. By the winter of 1965, his plans had been finalized. No financial help was forthcoming yet. Finally, he staked a large part of his personal fortune on the project, selected members for the committee, picked out a likely group of four English actors and of helpers, and established what has since then been called Theatre Arts Workshop ‚Äì a theatre for enthusiasts in drama and allied arts. Thus in 1966, Theatre Arts Workshop (TAW) was founded by Raj Bisaria, as a president and artistic director, with the aim of creating interest in dramatic arts among the young, and help them to develop an insight into acting, direction and allied arts. The name 'Theatre Arts Workshop' is unit for theatre and allied performing arts; its members are to be exposed to workshop methods of representation. TAW was to be a training organization and then a performing group, with its motto training before performance. Its philosophy is \\"your right is to work only, but never the fruit thereof. Let not the fruit of action be your object, nor let your attachment be to inaction.\\" ‚Äì Sri Krishna to sorrowing Arjuna (The Bhagvadgita, chapter II - 47) =English theatre= Raj Bisaria started his venture in English language with Shakespeare‚Äôs Othello in 1966, Christopher Fry's poetic play A Phoenix too Frequent and Eug√®ne Ionesco‚Äôs absurd play The Lesson in 1967. The selection of these two plays; diametrically opposite in their form and content, in a single show was an experiment by Raj Bisaria. It was a box office failure. In 1967 a significant advance was made when Raj Bisaria decided to produce and direct Jean-Paul Sartre's existential In Camera, Edna St. Vincent Millay‚Äôs Aria Da Capo and Ronald Duncan‚Äôs translation of 12th century classic Abelard and Heloise in a three-bill presentation, in November, 1967. These were crucial productions as TAW‚Äôs audience wavered between shocked admiration and shocked disgust. Four hours of continuous drama was considereda bit too much. =Hindi and Urdu theatre= Raj Bisaria was aware from the very beginning that any worthwhile theatre activity had to find its moorings in Hindi and other Indian languages. He sought the co-operation of the then existing theatre groups to realize his plans to establish a bilingual theatre in Lucknow. But his effort failed to elicit any response from them. He even brought the production rights of Mohan Rakesh‚Äôs well known play, Adhe-Adhure, which he could not stage for want of a suitable cast. In his bid to switch over to Hindi drama, he invited Delhi groups to produce, under TAW‚Äôs auspices, plays in Hindi with a view to making local groups conscious of the potentialities and challenges of Hindi Theatre. TAW‚Äôs first Hindi play was Baqi Itihas, a translation of Badal Sircar‚Äôs Bengali play on a thrust stage. It was a non-realistic presentation, using giant slides and specially designed music, the first production of the kind in the country. Baqi Itihas was followed by a wide range of plays in translation from English, Bengali, Marathi, Kannada, in addition to those originally in Hindi; Andha Yug, Suno Janmejaya, Adhe-Adhure, The Cave Dwellers, Antigone, Garbo, Candida, Father, Sleuth, Barefoot in Athens, The Caretaker etc. TAW is considered the protagonist of theatre art, from the classical to the experimental plays . TAW mounted on stage the European and American playwrights; its repertoire including Shakespeare, Shaw, Sartre, Ionesco, Fry, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, No√´l Coward, Ronald Duncan, Rattigan, Harold Pinter, Ann Jellicoe, Peter Shaffer, Edward Albee, Jean Anouilh, Maxwell Anderson and Orton. According to The Pioneer, The dynamism of TAW productions, their stylistic experimentation and directorial subtlety, were never in doubt on either side of the proscenium. But TAW's plays proved too radical in the context of existing provincial attitudes.  Bhartendu Academy of Dramatic Arts  As a theatre educator as early as 1973, Raj Bisaria suggested to the State Government that he should start a semi-professional repertory theatre in Uttar Pradesh, in 1974 the State Government went a few steps further and requested him to evolve a scheme for establishing a drama school, which would function as a full-fledged academy of dramatic arts. Bhartendu Natya Akademi (BNA): Bhartendu Academy of Dramatic Arts (BADA), when it was founded in 1975 became the first of its kind in the large Hindi belt of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The only other being the Delhi-based National School of Drama. From 1975 to 1986, in an honorary capacity, he had the responsibility of teaching acting and direction (aspects both theoretical and practical) western drama, from the Greeks to modern times; theatre criticism and adjudication and aesthetics of light, and set design. He worked again as, director of the academy as well as the director of its Repertory Company from 1989 to 1992, 1995 to 1997. As theatre administrator with minimal facilities, poor funds and negligible infrastructure, he has developed and consolidated the viability and status of a school of theatre beginning initially as an elementary agency for dissemination of theatrical know-how in 1976 to a professional academy of dramatic arts in 1981.

It was made through a collaboration between software developer Macphun and HDR photographer Trey Ratcliff.http://www.stuckincustoms.com/trey- ratcliff/ HDR image editing techniques are designed to overcome difficult lighting situations where highlights and shadows are prevalent in the same image, but have also been used to create highly processed, fanciful images as well. By automatically aligning and merging multiple exposures of photos, Aurora HDR can create a single tone-mapped image. A collection of powerful editing and processing tools also allow for layered compositions and targeted areas of photo and graphic processing.  Versions and plug-ins  Aurora HDR comes in five different versions for two different operating systems. Versions, previous and current, include: Aurora HDR (optionally sold on the Mac App Store); Aurora HDR Pro; Aurora HDR Pro + training, Aurora 2017; and Aurora 2018. The software runs as a standalone or as a plug-in to host applications like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, Adobe Photoshop Elements, and Apple Aperture. In early 2016, Aurora HDR was updated with support to run as an editing extension for Apple Photos for Mac. In 2016 Macphun released the next version of Aurora HDR - Aurora HDR 2017 along with a Windows version. In 2018 Skylum released Aurora 2018 for Mac and Windows operating systems. http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/graphics- and-media-software/image-editing-software/macphun-aurora- hdr-2017-1329760/review  Key Aurora HDR functionality = Initial merging  Aurora HDR works on single images or multiple exposures, and initial merging options change depending on the number of images loaded. If a single image is provided to the software, only the \\"Chromatic Aberration Reduction\\" option is available. If multiple exposures are selected, \\"Alignment\\" and \\"Ghost Reduction\\" options are revealed. Alignment should be checked if the multiple images were recorded while holding the camera by hand vs. a tripod. Ghost Reduction relates to minimizing the effects of moving objects in a multi-exposure merging process.https://www.slrlounge.com/school/motion-blur- vs-ghosting-the-difference-between-these-2-artifacts/ If you have moving objects, choose this function.  Interface  The user interface of Aurora HDR consists of the following: * Large preview window * Open & Export/Share * Zoom & navigation controls * Comparison controls * Undo/Redo * Cropping tool * Move (hand) tool * Brush * Layers * Histogram * Presets * Advanced tools  Presets  Presets are pre-installed one-click controls that apply a specific \\"style\\" to the tone-mapped image. This style is created entirely by the use and modification of the Advance tools containing in the software. The Preset panel in Aurora HDR Pro contains 7 separate categories applicable to all types of photos: Trey Ratcliff's Signature presets, Basic, Realistic HDR, Dramatic, Landscape, Indoor, Architecture, each of which contain thumbnail graphics representing several or dozens of styles. In addition, users may designate a preset as a \\"favorite\\" or create their own.  Tools  Aurora HDR comes with an extensive list of tools and functionality designed to help photographers edit their images using HDR techniques. The tools range from those that can help reproduce a natural, realistic look to those that enhance images towards a more fantasy-like direction. Each tool listed below has a unique set of controls to modify its effects.http://www.photographyblog.com/reviews/aurora_hdr_2017_review/ * Tone Mapping * Tone * Structure * HDR Denoise * Image Radiance * Color * Details * Glow * Top & Bottom Lightinghttp://www.nikonusa.com/en/learn-and- explore/article/gjcxf6bn/when-to-use-graduated-neutral-density-filters.html * Tone Curve * Color Filter * Color Toning * Vignette  Layers, brushes and masking  Aurora HDR Pro features the ability to create up to 9 layers (4 in the Mac App Store version), and provides brushing and masking functionality common in many image-editing software programs. Layers can be automatically loaded with either (a) the previous layer, (b) a custom texture, (c) the original tone-mapped image, or (d) any one of the exposures in the bracketed set. Brushes and masking, including Gradient Masking are used to selectively apply or erase effects from the image. An advanced feature of the Pro version of Aurora HDR is to designate a layer as one that contains \\"Luminosity Masking.\\"  Opening, file formats and exporting  Aurora HDR opens a variety of popular image file formats, including RAW camera files that are the native to specific camera manufacturers (e.g. Nikon's NEF and Canon CR2). It saves in a native file format (.mpau) which allows for the resumption of editing after saving and closing the file. The software exports in the following file formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, JPG-2000, TIFF, Photoshop, and PDF, and can also transfer images directly into Macphun's Creative Suite for further editing.  Sharing  The software permits sharing to image galleries like 500px, Smugmug and Flickr, plus social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Additionally Aurora HDR can send images via email or Apple Messages.

She became a widely respected authority, lectured in many institutions, and at one time was a judge in the International Court of Justice. Life Suzanne Marie Berthe Basdevant was born in Rennes, Brittany, on 15 August 1906. Her father was Jules Basdevant, a professor at the Rennes faculty of law. She was the oldest of seven children. In 1918 the family moved to Paris, where Jules Basdevant taught public international law. Suzanne studied at the Lyce√© F√©nelon in Paris, then began to study law. Basdevant obtained a doctorate in law in 1930 for a thesis on international civil servants. This was the first major work on this subject. It has come to be viewed as a standard work. She defined an international civil servant as a functionary appointed and directed by representatives of several states, or by an organization acting in their name following an inter-state agreement, who acts under special legal rules exclusively in the interests of these states. Basdevant stated that the most appropriate basis for the contract between international public servants and the body that employs them is public administrative law. This theory has since been upheld many times. In 1932 Basdevant was third in the concours d'agr√©gation for public law, and the first woman to join the Faculty of Law. She taught public international law and other subjects at the Lyon faculty of law from 1933 to 1946. Basdevent married Paul Bastid in 1937, a professor on the Paris law faculty. Bastid was Minister of Commerce at the time of their marriage. They had three daughters and a son, who died. She remained in Lyon during World War II (1939‚Äì45), and taught international law at the √âcole Libre des Sciences Politiques, which had moved to Lyon from Paris. During the German occupation her husband was a member of the National Council of the Resistance. In 1946 Suzanne Bastid was appointed to the faculty of law at the University of Paris. She taught international law there and at the Paris Institute of Political Studies until 1977‚Äì78, when she retired. She became well known as an authority on international law, and was invited to lecture in various leading institutions around the world. She was a member of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) from 1948 to 1966 in the section of political and juridical studies. She founded the CNRS journal L'Annuaire fran√ßais de droit internationale publique in 1955, and was the journal's chief editor. Bastid stated in public that she was against the European Defence Community (EDC) treaty. For this reason, she was replaced at the Stresa congress on the European Coal and Steel Community in May‚ÄìJune 1957 by Ren√© Roblot. Bastid taught in New York and Beijing, and undertook missions in Egypt, Poland, Portugal, Uruguay, Morocco, Lebanon and Taiwan. She was a member of the French delegation to the General Assembly of the United Nations from 1949 to 1957. She sat on the administrative tribunal of the United Nations, and was a judge at the International Court of Justice in a dispute between Tunisia and Libya in 1982. Paul Bastid died on 29 October 1974 at the age of 82. Suzanne Bastid died in Paris on 2 March 1995 at the age of 88.

Typical examples are liquids in porous media or liquids in solvation shells. Confinement regularly prevents crystallization, which enables liquids to be supercooled below their homeogenous nucleation temperature even if this is impossible in the bulk state. This holds in particular for water, which is by far the most studied confined liquid. Liquids under sub-millimeter confinement (e.g. in the gap between rigid walls) exhibit a nearly solid-like mechanical response and possess a surprisingly large low-frequency elastic shear modulus, which scales with the inverse cubic power of the confinement length.

The field developed in response to a perceived shortage in the education labor market in the 1990s. Teacher attrition is thought to be higher in low income schools and in high need subjects like math, science, and special education. More recent evidence suggests that school culture and leadership has the most significant effect on teacher decisions to stay or leave.  Factors= Schools  Researchers and policy makers have identified some commonalities across schools and districts that affect teacher retention. Some school factors are \\"push\\" factors that push teachers to leave their current school or the profession. Other school factors are \\"pull\\" factors that encourage teachers to stay in their current school. = Push factors = Certain factors are linked to teachers leaving schools or leaving the profession before retirement. Researchers have used data from school districts and national surveys of teachers and schools to demonstrate that there are common factors that push teachers to either leave their schools or leave the profession. The most significant factors include low salary, student behavior issues, lack of support from school administration, and inability to participate in decision-making. Teachers may also be more likely to leave if they are resistant to using prescribed curriculums or are discouraged from modifying their instruction. Over time, individual school environments affect teacher attrition more than district measures like teacher salary, student demographics, or urban settings. = Pull factors = Other factors encourage teachers to stay at their current school. Teachers are more likely to stay in elementary schools than middle or high schools.Raue, K., Gray, L., & O‚ÄôRear, I. (2015). Career Paths of Beginning Public School Teachers. Retrieved from http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2015/2015196.pdf Teachers who earn at least $40,000 per year are most likely to stay through their fifth year at the same school. Teachers stay longer in schools that have missions in alignment with the teacher's personal mission. One of the most successful strategies used to retain teachers includes mentoring and teacher teaming. Others point to the importance of teachers being treated as professionals who are trusted and collaborate with one another to meet student needs. These professional practices can include individuality, creativity, high expectations for students, and community building with mentors or peers. Teachers are also more likely to stay when they report being satisfied with their school. School location and student demographics are not major factors in either pushing teachers away or pulling them in.  Teacher factors  Researchers and policy makers have also collected information about teacher demographics to better understand teachers' choices to stay or leave their schools. Most studies include research on teacher age and gender as well as teacher qualifications. = Age and gender = Teachers are most likely to stay in their schools if they are between the ages of 30‚Äì50. Teachers under 30 are more likely to move schools within districts, move districts, or move to other states to teach. Younger teachers often still have preliminary credentials which allows them more flexibility within states as states often have their own standardized licensure and testing requirements that discourage teachers from moving. Younger teachers are also less likely to be vested in their pension systems and more likely to move districts before choosing a district which may offer a higher salary or better benefits and retirement options.Goldhaber, D., Grout, C., Holden, K. L., & Brown, N. (2015). Crossing the Border? Exploring the Cross-State Mobility of the Teacher Workforce. Retrieved from http://www.caldercenter.org/sites/default/files/WP%20143.pdf Salary increases can draw younger teachers to particular districts with the promise of higher payment for teaching in the long term.Imazeki, J. (2005). Teacher salaries and teacher attrition. Economics of Education Review; 24, 431‚Äì449. The relationship between life cycle events such as marriage or having children and teacher attrition can be difficult to measure, but teachers who leave the profession are more likely to have recently had children.Boe, E. E., Bobbitt, S. A., Cook, L. H., Whitener, S. D., & Weber, A. L. (1997). Why didst thou go? Predictors of retention, transfer, and attrition of special and general education teachers from a national perspective. The Journal of Special Education, 30(4), 390‚Äì411. Teachers with children under 5 are increasingly likely to leave the profession. Gender also plays a role in this trend: young female teachers are more likely than young male teachers to leave. Women who leave the profession are also more likely to return to teaching than men. Teachers over 50 are also more likely to leave the profession, but this is generally explained by teachers who are closer to retirement. = Qualifications = Researchers are examining teacher preparation in relation to retention, including the quality of higher education curriculum and student teaching experiences. Mentorships and inductions have been shown to help early-career teachers and other educators adapt and stay in the job. Teachers with better academic qualifications including grades, test scores, graduate degrees, and undergraduate college selectivity are more likely to leave the profession. There is no major retention difference between teachers who completed traditional preparation programs and teachers who completed alternative certification programs, like Teach for America. Teachers are more likely to stay when students are high achieving.Boyd, D., Grossman, P., Lankford, H., Loeb, S., & Wyckoff, J. (2008). Who leaves? Teacher attrition and student achievement. National Bureau of Economic Research. Retrieved from http://www.nber.org/papers/w14022 Teachers with certain teaching qualifications and teaching assignments are more likely to leave their schools or the profession. Special education teachers are not more likely to leave teaching, but they are more likely to transfer to positions as general educators.Boe, E. E., Bobbitt, S. A., & Cook, L. H. (1997). Whither didst thou go? Retention, reassignment, migration, and attrition of special and general education teachers from a national perspective. The Journal of Special Education, 30(4), 371‚Äì389. Elementary teachers are more likely to stay than middle and high school teachers. Teacher who feel effective in their jobs are also more likely to continue teaching.  Retaining teachers of color  Retaining teachers of color is an important element of teacher retention. Students of color perform better with race congruent teachers of color and American students are increasingly non white. In 2014 50.3% of American public school students were Latino, Asian, and African-American with demographic data suggesting that the percentage of students of color will continue to grow. Some evidence suggests that teachers of color have higher attrition rates than white teachers and other evidence suggests the opposite. Teachers of color are more likely to stay in a school in which they are led and supervised by administrators of color. Overall, 84% of white teachers have a race matched principal while only 44% of Black teachers have a race matched principal and 8% of other races have a matched principal. Teachers with a race matched principal are more likely to report earning additional pay, feeling autonomy, and experiencing additional support, all of which are linked to overall teacher retention. Race matched teachers are also more likely to report being satisfied with their jobs.Grissom, J. A., & Keiser, L. R. (2011). A supervisor like me: Race, representation, and the satisfaction and turnover decisions of public sector employees. Journal of Policy Analysis & Management, 30(3), 557-580. Race matching also affects exits from the profession more than transfers to another school. Also, white men are more likely to leave the profession when there are more students of color. In contrast, teachers of color have higher exit rates overall but are less likely to leave when they have more non white students.  Retaining effective teachers  Federal policy initiatives during the Obama Administration have emphasized the importance of retaining effective teachers, rather than just working to retain all teachers. This is partly due to President Obama and the United States Department of Education‚Äôs Race to the Top initiative which granted money to states pledging to institute policies which retained and released teachers based in part on their evaluations. The measurement of teacher success is often based on ‚Äúvalue added‚Äù determinations based on student standardized test scores. Value-added measurements assess the effect of a teacher on student test scores by quantifying teacher ability. These measurements are seen by some as ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù and only partly a measure of teacher performance, but still useful.Winters, M. A., & Cowen, J. M. (2013). Who would stay, who would be dismissed? An empirical consideration of value-added teacher retention policies. Educational Researcher, 42(6), 330-337. The American Education Research Association cautions against using value added models in most situations due to scientific and technical limitations. The Race to the Top incentives represented a major shift in how districts and administrators evaluated and retained teachers. Prior to Race to the Top, teacher effectiveness had been determined by years of experience and years of graduate study. Now, in many states, value added modeling is used alongside principal evaluations of teacher observations and teacher progress on student learning outcomes. One controversial use of value-added teacher evaluation was in Washington D.C. under the leadership of Michelle Rhee.Dee, T., & Wyckoff, J. (2013). Incentives, selection, and teacher performance: Evidence from IMPACT. Paper presented at the Economics of Education, Munich. The D.C. program was unique in rewarding high performing teachers with higher salaries and bonus pay while also threatening to dismiss low performing teachers. Teachers in D.C. under threat of dismissal made greater gains in their teaching practice than teachers who stood to gain financially. The dismissal threat also increased voluntary attrition of lower performing teachers by 50%. Statistics suggest that having a top performing teacher rather than a low performing teacher ‚Äúfour years in a row would be enough to close the black-white test score gap.‚Äù Teacher effectiveness has also been linked to how often teachers move schools. Overall, leavers are less effective than movers. More effective teachers are more likely to stay in the same schools, unless they being their careers in lower performing schools. Teachers with low performing students are more likely to leave their schools in the first 1‚Äì2 years. Low performing teachers are more likely to move to schools that are similar to the schools they currently teach in, while higher performing teachers will move from low performing schools to higher performing schools. This evidence indicates that some teacher attrition may be beneficial to students.  Retention of Early Career Teachers  A Canada-wide survey revealed that most cases of teacher attrition occur within the first five years of teaching, with 50% of cases occurring within the first two years. It is therefore important to consider a) the factors that lead to early career teacher attrition and b) viable interventions that aim to retain beginning teachers. One study found factors that contribute to early career teacher attrition to include: a difficulty with balancing work and home life and the time constraints involved, issues in classroom management and students' challenging behaviours, strained relationships with parents, staff and/or administration, and feeling incompetent in one's role as a teacher. Another study considered teacher perceptions' of the workplace environment, and how these perceptions play a role in motivating teachers to stay or leave their current positions. School climates that were perceived to be nurturing were characterized as open to both collaboration and differences in instructional preferences, uplifting, and supportive. When aspects of this environment were perceived to be missing, teachers more often noted their negative experiences in the workplace environment.. An Australian study suggested that decisions to leave the profession are influenced by the quality of mentoring and induction programs in a school, as well as relationships with other teachers and school leadership. Organizational-level interventions aimed to retain early career teachers can involve the monitoring of workload amounts, mentorship programs that help early career teachers create a better work-life balance, guidance from administration and/or mentors in navigating the specific socio-cultural environment of the school, mentor modeling of effective teaching practices, and providing feedback on teaching practices. It is also important to consider interventions at the individual-level. One might investigate how early career teachers in remote schools manage negative aspects of their workplace environment. One study noted that in the absence of professional or organizational supports, teachers may still develop resilience by relying on \\"personal\\" supports, such as relationships with family and friends and the construction of a teaching identity. Future research in the area of the retention of early career teachers may therefore look at how the construction of a teaching identity affects one's likelihood to stay or leave his or her teaching post.

It is located heritage town region of the city. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is a storehouse of Chola architecture. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple has a five-tiered rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower. The temple is originally believed to have been built by the Cholas during the 11th century, with later expansion from the Pandyas. The temple follows Vaikasana Agama tradition of worship. Four daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the ten-day annual Brahmostavam during the Tamil month of Chittirai (April - May) and five-day Pavitrotsavam during Avani (August - September) and 25-day Ramar festival during chittirai being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India as a protected monument. History Hindu legends inside the temple The temple is originally believed to be built by the later Cholas and subsequently by the Pandyas from the 12th century. The regions changed hands from British to French colonial Empire during the 17th century. Most temples in the place were destroyed during the French invasion, but the temple was spared. The temple housed the images of the Vedapureeswarar Temple during the destruction by the French troops during 1748. The temple was also guarded by the invading Muslim troops. The images of Rama, Sita, Hanuman, Navaneethakrishnan, Santhanakrishnan and Venugopalan were dug out from Vaithikupam in 1902 and subsequently housed in the temple. It is believed that Vasantha Mandapam was built by a Muslim. Architecture Entrance of the temple The five-tiered rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower, is tall. The sanctum houses the image of Varadaraja Perumal in standing posture is made of granite sporting four arms. Two of his arms hold the conch and Chakra, while the other two sport Abayamudra and Kadahasta. The images of Sridevi and Bhudevi are located on either of his sides. The festive image is called Srinivasan and the image has identical features as that of the presiding deity. The Ardha mandapa is guarded by two Dwarapalas on either sides. There is a separate shrine of Perundevi in the second precinct, which also houses the festival image. There is a mirror hall in the temple adjacent to the sanctum. There are paintings done in modern days around the walls of the precinct showing the 108 Divya Desams. There are separate shrines for Vaishana Gurus like Nikamanda Mahadesikan and Manavalamamunigal. The temple has 83 springs in the temple tanks and 12 bodies of water. The water in the temple tank is considered to be medicinal and devotees take a dip to cure themselves of common ailments. Festival and religious importance Temple ceiling The temple does not differentiate between Thenkalai and Vadakalai sects of Vaishnavite tradition and follows Pancharathra aagama. In modern times, the temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m., and Sayarakshai at 8:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Varadaraja Perumal and Perundevi. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The major festivals in the temple are the ten day annual Brahmostavam during the Tamil month of Chittirai (April - May) and five day Pavitrotsavam during Avani (August - September) and 25 day Ramar festival during chittirai. During the Ramanavami festival, the festive images of Rama, Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman are taken around the streets of the temple in the temple chariot drawn by thousands of devotees. Annaprasanam, a practise of making the infants write their first alphabet in a plate of rice, is a ritual practised in the temple by devotees.

He was born in Lu'an, Anhui Province. In 1919, he participated in the May Fourth Movement. In 1920, he went to Anqing. In April 1921, he joined the Communist Youth League of China. In 1923, Xu left Anhui for Shanghai, enrolling in Shanghai University. In 1924, Xu entered the Whampoa Military Academy and joined the Communist Party of China. He quickly rose through the ranks from platoon commander to deputy company commander to company commander, ultimately rising to the rank of major. After the Zhongshan Warship Incident, he was made a battalion commander under Ye Ting. During his participation in the Northern Expedition, he was wounded due to the actions of Xia Douyin. Chinese Civil War After the breakdown of the alliance between the communists and the Kuomintang, Xu left the National Revolutionary Army. In March 1930, he went to the border region of Hubei, Henan and Anhui Provinces, where he was made commander of the Red 1st Army. Under his command, the Red Army inflicted 7,000 casualties on the Kuomintang forces. In December 1930, the Kuomintang launched their first offensive on the area. Xu's forces defeated 3 Kuomintang regiments totalling 3,000 troops. In January 1931, Xu's command was downgraded to divisional with the merging of the Red 1st Army into the Red 4th Army. Xu was able to defeat a Kuomintang brigade and take 2,000 prisoners. A later offensive resulted in the capture of a Kuomintang general (a descendant of Song Dynasty general Yue Fei) and 5,000 soldiers. In April 1931, Chiang Kai-shek ordered another offensive on the area, with He Yingqin in direct command. Ji Hongchang, one of the generals in this campaign, refused to fight the communists and attempted negotiations instead. Using this to frame Xu as collaborator with the Kuomintang, Zhang Guotao ordered his execution, which took place at Guangshan County, Henan.

Its stated mission is to \\"support the American public and media about issues related to Palestine and its rich cultural and historic heritage.\\" AMP holds conferences and training sessions for coalition building and legislative advocacy, such as hosting annual Palestine Advocacy Days, that provide workshop panels and encourage attendees to meet with American Congress members. AMP works with Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow to bolster Palestine solidarity campaigns.  History  AMP was founded in 2006 by Palestinian-American UC Berkeley professor Hatem Baizan, who is also the co- founder of Students for Justice in Palestine. The organization opened its first office in 2009 in Palos Heights, Illinois.  Policy positions  AMP supports the BDS movement's call for a boycott of Israel in order to put pressure on the country to comply with international law and human rights. The group hopes that a boycott will put an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, grant full equality to Arab Israelis and promote the right of return for the Palestinian refugees. AMP does not take a position on one-state solution or two-state solution as a resolution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. AMP categorically opposes \\"all forms of racism and bigotry, including Islamophobia, anti-black racism, anti-immigrants, anti-Semitism, and other forms of bigotry directed particularly toward people of color and indigenous peoples everywhere.\\"  Campaigns  AMP co-signed a letter with Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) in 2012 calling on the University of California system to protect student civil liberties from efforts to censor Palestine- related activism. AMP has organized several billboard and bus advertisement campaigns in New York City and Washington DC to end United States' foreign aid to Israel.Pollak, Susan. \\"Conflict Apparent on Public Transit.\\" Washington Jewish Week, [S.l.], 17 abr. 2014. v. 50, n. 16, p. 5. During the 2014 Gaza war, in which over 2,000 Palestinians were killed, it organized protests against Israel's conduct. In 2015, it ran a bus advertisement campaign in advance of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to a joint session of Congress which called on members of Congress to boycott the speech. In December 2016, AMP hosted an event endorsed by 15 other Syrian advocacy and relief organizations in support of the Syrian resistance at Aleppo in the Battle of Aleppo by encouraging attendees to lobby Congress. Later that month, AMP hosted a protest with Council on American‚ÄìIslamic Relations and JVP calling on Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner to reverse the moratorium on resettling Syrian refugees. In 2017, JVP, US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, the social justice movement Code Pink, and AMP organized a letter campaign signed by 32 Democratic congressman urging United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to assist Palestinian protester Issa Amro who was facing criminal chargers in Israel. During the 2017 Temple Mount crisis, AMP organized a protest called \\"Aqsa Under Attack\\" in front of the Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C. During the 2018 Gaza border protests, AMP's local chapter in New Jersey protested outside the offices of Senators Cory Booker and Bob Menendez, calling them to instigate an investigation on Israel using the Leahy Law.  Reactions The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), has criticized the AMP for allegedly promoting extreme anti-Israel views and allegedly providing a platform for antisemitism under the guise of educating Americans. In 2013, ADL released a report in which it described AMP as one of the most \\"influential and active anti-Israel groups\\" The AMP has said that pro-Israel groups like the ADL deliberately use \\"false anti-Semitism charges\\" as a way to limit the free speech, silence political activism, and intimidate vocal pro-Palestinian activists. Middle East historian Asaf Romirowsky says that it \\"grew out of the network of Muslim Brotherhood organizations in America\\" and having an Islamist view on the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. According to AMP director Kristin Szremski the organization \\"typically ignores these smear campaigns because they're aimed, in part, to detract us from our work.\\" A national board member of AMP was prevented entry to Israel as part of an interfaith delegation in 2017. In 2018, Israel officially barred members of AMP from entering Israel due to its support of the BDS movement that calls for a global boycott of Israel.

In March 2015, in recognition for her research on vegetation in the Arctic tundra, she received an International Rising Talent Fellowship, one of the L'Or√©al-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science. Biography Normand became interested in natural history as a child when her grandfather, a biology teacher in Esbjerg, took her for walks through the woods, fields and marshes surrounding the family summerhouse in the little seaside resort of Bl√•vand in south-western Jutland. She learnt the Latin names of the various plants and creatures, remembering them by creating rhymes. She attended a boarding school where biology was a constant interest and, after finishing high school in Denmark, spent a year experiencing nature and outdoor life while at a folk high school in Norway. On her return to Denmark, Normand studied biology at Aarhus University graduating in 2004. She earned a master's degree in 2006 and a doctorate in 2010 under Jens-Christian Svenning concentrating throughout on the distribution and diversity patterns of European flora. Unlike many of those who earn their doctorates, Normand was keen to continue her research and travels. Despite being married (to the Swiss biologist Urs A. Treirer) and having a baby, she travelled with her family to America and Switzerland where she was able to complete her Post Doc at the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research in 2014. During her four years in Switzerland, her husband was able to find work as a teacher. Normand was awarded the L'Or√©al-UNESCO prize for her research into changes in the vegetation of the Arctic tundra, especially those caused by the effects of global warming on the flora of Greenland. Until recently, knowledge in the area was based primarily on satellite imaging or field studies but Normand was able to provide a much more detailed picture by making use of photography from the low-flying drones she guided over the regions investigated.

Due to flooding, the Belmont settlement was moved across the river adjoining the Webster settlement. Belmont was first to file an application for a post office. The Belmont application was denied as another Kansas town had previously been granted the name. Instead, Webster was granted a post office in 1879. Webster, named for Daniel Webster, was surveyed, platted and filed in 1885. The town was never incorporated. In 1888, Webster had two doctors, two churches, a school and 24 businesses.

They were originally built as desirable properties, such as the townhouses for the nobility around Regent's Park in central London, and the Georgian architecture in Bath. The design became a popular way to provide high-density accommodation for the working class in the 19th century, when terraced houses were built extensively in urban areas throughout Victorian Britain. Though numerous terraces have been cleared and demolished, many remain and have regained popularity in the 21st century. Definition The layout of a typical two-up two-down terraced house, including a yard and outside lavatory. Terraced houses, as defined by various bye-laws established in the 19th century, particularly the Public Health Act 1875, are distinguished by properties connecting directly to each other in a row, sharing a party wall. A house may be several storeys high, one or two rooms deep, and optionally contain a basement and attic. In this configuration, a terraced house may be known as a two-up two-down, having a ground and first floor with two rooms on each. Most terraced houses have a duo pitch gable roof. For a typical two-up two-down house, the front room has historically been the parlour, or reception room, where guests would be entertained, while the rear would act as a living room and private area. Many terraced houses are extended by a back projection, which may or may not be the same height as the main build. A terraced house has windows at both the front and the back of the house; if a house connects directly to a property at the rear, it is a back to back house. 19th century terraced houses, especially those designed for working-class families, did not typically have a bathroom or toilet with a modern drainage system; instead these would have a privy using ash to deodorise human waste. Origin The Circus at Bath is a classic example of a Georgian terrace. Terraced houses were introduced to London from Italy in the 1630s. Covent Garden was laid out to resemble the Palazzo Thiene in Venice. Terraces first became popular in England when Nicholas Barbon began rebuilding London after the Great Fire in 1666. The terrace was designed to hold family and servants together in one place, as opposed to separate servant quarters, and came to be regarded as a \\"higher form of life\\". They became a trademark of Georgian architecture in Britain, including Grosvenor Square, London, in 1727 and Queen's Square, Bath, in 1729. The parlour became the largest room in the house, and the area where the aristocracy would entertain and impress their guests. 17th and 18th-century terraced houses did not use as sophisticated construction methods compared to later. Building materials were supplied locally, using stone where possible (such as Bath stone in the eponymous city), otherwise firing brick from clay. The house was divided into small rooms partly for structural reasons, and partly because it was more economical to supply timber in shorter lengths. The London Building Act of 1774 made it a legal requirement for all terraced houses there to have a minimum wall thickness and a party wall extending above the roofline to help prevent fire spreading along the terrace along with other specified basic building requirements. However, these requirements did not extend elsewhere, and towns had varying requirements until the mid-19th century. 19th century Waterloo, London Terraced houses were still considered desirable architecture at the start of the 19th century. The architect John Nash included terraced houses when designing Regent's Park in 1811, as it would allow individual tenants to feel as if they owned their own mansion. The terraced house reached mass popularity in the mid-19th century as a result of increased migration to urban areas. Between 1841 and 1851, towns in England grew over 25% in size, at which point over half the population lived in urban areas; this increased further to nearly 80% by 1911. Terraced houses became an economical solution to fit large numbers of people into a relatively constricted area. Many terraced houses were built in the South Wales Valleys in the mid to late 19th century owing to the large-scale expansion of coal mining there. In the Rhondda, the population increased from 4,000 in 1861 to 163,000 in 1891. Because of the imposing local geography, containing narrow river valleys surrounded by mountains, terraced houses were the most economic means of providing sufficient accommodation for workers and their families. Many terraced houses were built in the Rhondda in the mid to late 19th century, as they could accommodate migrants within the mountainous landscape. Nationwide legislation for terraced housing began to be introduced during the Victorian era. The 1858 Local Government Act stated that a street containing terraced houses had to be at least wide with houses having a minimum open area at the rear of , and specified the distance between properties should not be less than the height of each. Other building codes inherited from various local councils defined a minimum set of requirements for drainage, lighting and ventilation. The various acts led to a uniform design of terraced houses that was replicated in streets throughout the country. This design was still basic, however; for example, in 1906, only 750 houses out of 10,000 in Rochdale had an indoor WC. Sanitation was handled, imperfectly, by outhouses (privies) shared between several dwellings. These were originally various forms of \\"earth closet\\" (such as the Rochdale system of municipal collection) until legislation forced their conversion to \\"water closet\\" (flush toilet). Terraced houses were as popular in working-class Northern Ireland as in Britain. The Bogside in Derry is composed mainly of traditional Victorian terraces and their overcrowding in the mid-20th century was a key trigger for the Troubles. Though many working-class people lived in terraces, they were also popular with middle classes in some areas, particularly the North of England. In 1914, despite the introduction of newer housing, terraces still catered for 71% of the population in Leeds. In some areas, these terraces contained 70‚Äì80 houses per acre. Houses were generally allowed to be used for commercial purposes, with many front rooms being converted to a shop front and giving rise to the corner shop. By the 1890s, larger terraces designed for lower-middle-class families were being built. These contained eight or nine rooms each and included upstairs bathrooms and indoor toilets. 20th century A row of terraced houses being demolished in Scunthorpe Terraced houses began to be perceived as obsolete following World War I and the rise of the suburban semi-detached house. After new legislation for suburban housing was introduced in 1919, Victorian terraces became associated with overcrowding and slums, and were avoided. Terraced houses continued to be used by the working class in the 1920s and 30s, though Tudor Walters state owned houses, such as those in Becontree, became another option. Developers built \\"short terraces\\" of only a few contiguous houses, to resemble semi-detached housing. Back to back housing, popular for 19th century low-class homes throughout Northern England, was outlawed in most towns by 1909, finally becoming obsolete in Leeds by 1937. Although the worst slums deemed \\"unfit for human habitation\\" were demolished, progress on removing terraced estates was slow. The criteria of what constituted a \\"slum\\" gradually rose during the early 20th century, such that by the 1950s it was applied to houses that had been previously considered perfectly acceptable. The Housing Act 1957 set a new mandatory set of requirements for houses, including running hot water, inside or \\"readily accessible\\" toilet, and artificial lighting and heating in all rooms, which required modernisation of Victorian terraces. Since the 1950s, successive governments have looked unfavourably on terraced houses, believing them to be outdated and attempting to clear the worst slums. Between 1960 and 1967, around half a million houses deemed unfit were demolished. Tower blocks began to replace terraces in working class areas, though public opinion began to change against them following incidents such as the collapse of the Ronan Point tower block in 1968. By the 1970s, traditional urban terraces were being upgraded by fitting modern bathroom and heating systems, and began to become popular again. Residents in Leeds began to protest against the blanket demolition of back to back houses, saying they were perfectly acceptable accommodation for the elderly and low-income households. 21st century In 2002, the Labour government introduced the Housing Market Renewal Initiative scheme, which would see many terraced houses demolished and replaced with modern homes, in order to attract middle-class people into area and improve its quality. The scheme was controversial and unsuccessful, as many of the terraces that had survived the 1960s cull were well-built and maintained, and has led to many derelict terraces in urban areas. In 2012, 400 homes in Liverpool were planned to be demolished; a small number were saved, including the birthplace of the Beatles' Ringo Starr in the Welsh Streets. Despite their association with the working class and Victorian Britain, terraced houses remain popular. In 2007, a report by Halifax Estate Agents showed prices of terraces had increased by 239% over the past ten years, with an average price of ¬£125,058. By 2013, the average price for a terraced house had exceeded ¬£200,000. Conversely, Wales Online reported in 2011 that a terraced house in Maerdy, Rhondda, was one of the cheapest on the market at ¬£7,000. In 2015, the television show DIY SOS filmed a group project to rebuild a street of derelict terraced houses in Newton Heath, Manchester, as homes for retired war veterans. Because few terraced houses are listed, they are easier to convert as planning permission is either unnecessary or simpler, with English Heritage describing them as being 60% cheaper to maintain on average. By 2011, a fifth of new houses built in Britain were terraced, and recreations of classic Georgian terraces have been built, such as at Richmond Lock.

He is best known for creating stained glass windows for the Washington Memorial Chapel in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania; the Nipper Building in Camden, New Jersey; the Loyola Alumni Chapel of Our Lady at Loyola University Maryland; the Folger Shakespeare Library and Washington National Cathedral, both in Washington, D.C. Biography He was born in Torricella Peligna, Italy, into a family of artists, metalworkers and armor makers.D'Ascenzo catalogue (1973), p. 4. His immediate family emigrated to the United States in 1882, and settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Working as a mural painter while in his teens, he attended night classes at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. He attended and then taught at the Pennsylvania Museum School, where he met his wife, fellow instructor Myrtle Dell Goodwin (1864-1954). They married in 1894, and moved to Italy, where he studied at the Scuola Libera in Rome. The couple returned to Philadelphia in 1896, where he worked as a portrait painter and opened D'Ascenzo Studios, initially an interior decorating firm.Sandra L. Tatman, \\"Nicola D'Ascenzo (1871-1954),\\" from Philadelphia Architects and Buildings. Horn & Hardart, Times Square (1912), New York City. D'Ascenzo Studios created Art Nouveau interiors (and later stained glass facades) for Horn & Hardart restaurants, a chain of about fifty automats that began in Philadelphia in 1902.Horn & Hardart, 11th & Ludlow Sts., Philadelphia, from PAB. The company's flagship restaurant in New York City (1912) was on Broadway at Times Square.Horn & Hardart, Broadway Stained glass D'Ascenzo dabbled in stained glass on his own for several years, and studied the craft at the New York School of Design, sometime around 1900.D'Ascenzo may have worked under stained glass designer John Lafarge, although Weilbacker was unable to find evidence confirming this. See: Weilbacker, p. 31. He completed his first stained glass commission in 1904.Weilbacker, p. 31. Initially, he bought glass from local manufacturers, but soon began making his own. Beginning in 1911, he spent his summers in Europe, making a comprehensive study of stained glass in cathedrals. In 1921, he was granted permission to set up scaffolding inside Chartres Cathedral for several weeks, to sketch and examine the windows up close. The following summer he did the same at Leon Cathedral in Spain.Weilbacker, pp. 34-35. Architect Milton Bennett Medary assembled an extraordinary team of collaborators for his Washington Memorial Chapel (1914‚Äì17) in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania - built on the grounds of the Continental Army's 1777-1778 winter encampment. D'Ascenzo Studios created thirteen stained glass windows; Samuel Yellin created wrought iron gates, hardware and locks; Edward Maene created oak reredos, choir stalls and church furniture; and sculptors Franklin Simmons, Alexander Stirling Calder, Bela Pratt, and Martha Maulsby Hovenden created statues and other works. The Reverend W. Herbert Burke, who led the decades-long effort to build the chapel, celebrated its completion: > The glowing imagery of stained glass associated with perpendicular Gothic is > seen in full perfection. In this respect the chapel is comparable to the > famous Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, but surpasses the European masterpiece in > warmth and delicacy of execution as well as in symbolic appeal.Rev. W. > Herbert Burk, \\"Valley Forge Miracles: A Sermon Preached in the Washington > Memorial Chapel, 13 October 1929\\", quoted in \\"The Churches at Valley Forge,\\" > from National Park Service. For the bell tower (completed 1953), D'Ascenzo Studios created a mosaic bust of George Washington and a Rose Window: Washington at Prayer. In 1916, the studio completed four 14 ft (4.27 m)-diameter roundel windows for the tower of the Victor Talking Machine Company in Camden, New Jersey. Each depicted the company's logo - \\"His Master's Voice\\" (also known as \\"Nipper\\") - a dog listening quizzically to a gramophone. At night, the windows were illuminated, and the west-facing window was visible from Philadelphia, on the opposite side of the Delaware River. The original windows were removed in 1969 and the studio manufactured identical replacement windows which were installed in the tower in 1979. The current tower windows are 2003 reproductions made by another firm. The Camden County Historical Society and the Wolfgram Library at Widener University each possess one of the original windows.His Master's Voice, from Encyclopedia of Philadelphia.A Memento of Recording History, Widener Magazine, October 26, 2010. Perhaps D'Ascenzo Studios' most varied commission was for Rodeph Shalom Synagogue (1927) in Philadelphia. The Moorish Revival building was designed by architects (and brothers) Grant and Edward Simon, and nearly every surface in its sanctuary was covered with decoration. The studio designed its murals, twenty stained glass windows (including the glass ceiling of the dome),Census of Stained Glass Windows in America - Rodeph Shalom, lighting fixtures, carpets, and even the bronze ark for the Torah. The studio also created the mosaics on the synagogue's fa√ßade, whose colors remain vibrant after nearly ninety years.Congregation Rodeph Shalom, from Philadelphia Public Art. For the Cathedral of the Air (1930) - a memorial chapel dedicated to World War I aviators, at Naval Air Station Lakehurst in New Jersey - the studio created a set of fifteen stained glass windows depicting the history of aviation. These ranged from Leonardo da Vinci's sketches of flying machines to Charles Lindberg's 1927 flight over the Atlantic Ocean (only three years earlier).Weilbacker, pp. 65-66. Lakehurst was later the site of the 1937 Hindenberg disaster. In three pairs of windows (1940) for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City, D'Ascenzo drew parallels between Biblical scenes and contemporary life. The \\"Press Bay\\" features Christ preaching and a modern minister at his pulpit; but also a printing press, Samuel Morse and his telegraph, a radio broadcast, and the invention of television. The \\"Sports Bay\\" features Samson slaying the lion and Jacob wrestling with the Angel; but also baseball, football, basketball, bicycle racing and other sports. The \\"Labor Bay\\" contrasts ancient occupations with modern ones.Weilbacker, pp. 66-67. Awards and honors \\"Doubting Thomas\\" door (1928), Christ Church Cranbrook, Michigan.

Written by Frederik Pohl, it appeared under the pseudonym \\"Ernst Mason\\". The article is written from the point of view of an anthropologist studying the extinct culture of Mars. Among the artifacts discovered by explorers from Earth were many items that resembled umbrellas. The writer explains that this was due to the Martian interpretation of the Milky Way and related constellations of their southern sky, which was visible from the places where their civilization arose. They came to believe that one constellation near their South Celestial pole was a malevolent being they called \\"Old Grabby\\" and that the visible portion of the galaxy represented his hands and arms. The Magellanic Clouds looked like eyes and were known as \\"The Peepers\\". The bright stars Canopus and Achernar represented horns on Old Grabby's head. The Southern Cross represented a manacle on one wrist, and the other hand was trying to reach across and break the manacle. When this happened, they believed, Old Grabby would descend and destroy them. The superstition became so strong that Martians carried umbrellas to shield themselves from the sky. In time, their civilization moved north to a point where Old Grabby was no longer visible, and they ceased to carry the umbrellas. However, they could not help but notice the resemblance of the constellation Cassiopeia to the mouth of Old Grabby. Martians had a cleft jaw which gave their mouths a characteristic \\"W\\" shape which they naturally transferred to their mythical beings. Not far away was the Martian North pole star, Delta Cephei, which is a variable star. Its changing brightness was likened to the breathing of a Sleeper. Nebulae such as the Orion Nebula were likened to wounds suffered in some battle. However, centuries before human explorers arrived, the supernova known as Tycho's Star occurred just above Cassiopeia, looking to Martians like an opened eye. From their point of view, the Sleeper was awake, Old Grabby or a relative had found them, and they were doomed. Effectively, their entire culture committed suicide.

Etymology The word Tahlil is the verbal noun of the form 2 verb Hallala () which literally means '\\"to praise\\" or \\"to acclaim\\". History Traditionally, the utterance of the sentence is part of Shahada performed by somebody converting to Islam. Later on, it becomes tradition especially in sufism as one of its rituals, such as an event remembering a dead muslim. Tahlil as a ritual to remember the dead is considered a bid'ah by Salafi muslims. In Indonesia and Malaysia, ritualized repetitive chanting of the Tahlil is done in a tradition called Kenduri, especially during death rituals. This practice is more common among muslims that are followers of the tradionalist Nahdlatul Ulama. Hadith Narrated by Abu Huraira: The Messenger of Allah said, \\"He who utters a hundred times in a day these words: \`La ilaha illallahu, wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu, wa Huwa \`ala kulli sha'in Qadir (there is no true god except Allah.

Al- Tirmidhi related on the authority of \`Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-Aas that the Messenger of Allah said: (The best thing I and the Prophets before me have said: (there is no true god except Allah.

It was subsequently used for a number of purposes, including as an insurgent command base, an official residence, a museum depository and a school. It currently houses the Ministry for Sustainable Development, the Environment and Climate Change. History Grandmaster's Palace in Valletta. The Old Parish Church is seen in the background. Casa Leoni was built in 1730 as a summer residence for Grand Master Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena, and it was originally called Palazzo Manoel. The building is located close to the Wignacourt Aqueduct, in an area that was originally in the limits of ƒ¶amrun but which later became the separate locality of Santa Venera. It was designed by the French architect Charles Fran√ßois de Mondion. During the French blockade of 1798‚Äì1800, Casa Leoni served as a command base for the Maltese insurgent National Congress Battalions. A grenadier company known as the Granatieri was set up specifically to guard this headquarters. Casa Leoni subsequently became a residence for the Governor of Malta, and later for the Lieutenant-Governor. In the 1820s the Whitemore family owned the building with its gardens and around that period have welcomed the Hastings family at the building during the local feast of the old parish of Santa Venera. It was occasionally the host of theatre productions during the stay of Harry Luke and his wife Joyce Fremlin between 1930 and 1938.http://www.holobooks.co.uk/MaltaItineraryChapter20.pdf Entire fa√ßade of Casa Leoni After World War II, it was used as a depository by the Museums Department. The building was converted into a museum in 1952, but the project was unsuccessful and it closed down soon afterwards. While serving as a museum, two gibbets from Villa Frere in Piet√† were transferred to Casa Leoni. It later served as a government primary school until 1968. The building was restored between 1977 and 1978, and it was briefly converted into a guest house for prominent visitors to Malta. It subsequently housed various government departments and ministries, including the Ministry for Education and Culture. It currently houses the Ministry for Sustainable Development, the Environment and Climate Change. The building was included on the Antiquities List of 1925. It is now a Grade 1 national monument, and it is also listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. Architecture=Palace and front garden One of the four lion statues from which Casa Leoni gets its name Casa Leoni is an example of Maltese Baroque architecture, with a simple but elegant design. Its fa√ßade contains an arched doorway at the centre of the ground floor, with a balcony above it. The door and balcony are flanked by several wooden louvered windows surrounded by mouldings. Casa Leoni has a small front garden, and its entrance consists of an ornamental arched gateway decorated with the coat of arms of Grand Master Vilhena. Two rooms are located on either side of the gate, and carved stone lions holding an escutcheon with Vilhena's coat of arms are found on the roof of each room. The name Casa Leoni is derived from these carved lions. Back garden Romeo Romano Gardens The palace also contains a large back garden, which is similar to that at San Anton Palace but on a smaller scale. It is the second largest Hospitaller-era garden in Malta after San Anton. A water lifting apparatus () was installed in the gardens in the 19th century for irrigation purposes. Since 1977, most of the garden has been open to the public as Romeo Romano Gardens (). Stables and other gardens Manoel Foundation stables with Latin inscription Around the same time as Casa Leoni was constructed, the Manoel Foundation (a foundation responsible for the upkeep of Fort Manoel) also purchased plots of land in the areas of il-ƒ¶amrija and Santa Veneranda, close to the Old Church of Santa Venera, and converted them into gardens. A stable building was also constructed near the rear of Romeo Romano Gardens, and it has the following inscription above its entrance: Today, the gardens no longer exist but the stable building still stands.

The Public Promenade () was a park in Lisbon, Portugal, that was located where the Avenida da Liberdade is currently laid. Built after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, the Passeio become an important fixture in the Lisbon landscape in the 19th century and was a meeting point for the upper echelons of Portuguese society. Its borders soon attracted the finest homes of Lisbon personalities, leading to the eventual destruction of the park in order to construct a grand boulevard that would become the Avenida da Liberdade. History=Pombaline era After the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, which resulted in the almost-total destruction of the city, Sebasti√£o Jos√© de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal, the prime minister of King Jos√© I, managed the reconstruction of the city in a new enlightened plan, in what would become Pombaline style. The Marquis ordered the demarcation and construction of the Passeio, to be at the northern edge of his newly constructed city. Management of the park's design and construction was given to royal engineer Reinaldo Manuel dos Santos, and construction lasted between 1764 and 1771.Instituto Cam√µes - Do Passeio P√∫blico ao Parque da Liberdade Although it was given the name of Passeio P√∫blico, the park was not open to the public. It was walled and gated for the exclusive use of members of the Portuguese nobility. However, for about the first 50 years of the park's history, most aristocracy avoided the park, as they deemed it as lacking in ornamentation and poorly landscaped.P√∫blico - Lisboa, n√£o sejas francesa Aristocratic favour Passeio P√∫blico c. 1870s. The Passeio's failure to attract the interests in the upper classes resulted in a successive series of works to improve the park's quality and popularity. The first of which was in 1821, when King Jo√£o VI ordered that the walls surrounding the Passeio be torn down and that the park be open to people of all classes. In 1835, the most noteworthy reformulation of the park was initiated by Malaquias Ferreira Leal, architect for the Municipality of Lisbon.Academia - Malaquias Ferreira Leal, arquitecto da cidade na primeira metade de Oitocentos Ferreira Leal's plans completely rearranged the fountains within the park, introduced the iconic allegorical statues of the Tagus and Douro rivers, and saw the construction of the Passeio's most iconic landmark, its cascade. Following Ferreira Leal's rearrangement of the park, the Passeio quickly become a social meeting place for the aristocracy of Lisbon. For the next couple decades, the park would be the center for the follies of the rich and powerful of Lisbon. For the next few decades, the park grew in its statuary and amenities and, by 1851, the park became completely illuminated.SIPA - Jardins da Avenida da Liberdade Avenida da Liberdade By the latter half of the 19th century, Lisboners grew discontent with the outdated format of the Passeio and with the triviality of all the activities that took place there. In 1863, the first idea of creating a grand passage way through the park first arose, but it was only in 1873 when the Municipality of Lisbon took the decision to construct a great avenue through the Passeio. Demolition work of the Passeio, including the park's trees and its famed cascade, began in 1879 and works lasted until 1886, when Jos√© Greg√≥rio da Rosa Ara√∫jo, Mayor of Lisbon, unveiled the new Avenida da Liberdade (Avenue of Liberty), the new central thoroughfare in Lisbon.

During this time African slaves were sold to Dutch and Portuguese Jewish merchants. The Atlantic slave trade to Brazil refers to the period of history in which there was a forced migration of Africans to Brazil for the purpose of slavery. It lasted from the mid-sixteenth century until the mid-nineteenth century. African, Portuguese, Dutch, British, and Brazilians dominated a trade that involved the movement of more than 3 million people. It was divided into four phases: The Cycle of Guinea (16th century); the Cycle of Angola (17th century) which trafficked people from Bakongo, Mbundu, Benguela and Ovambo; Cycle of Costa da Mina, now renamed Cycle of Benin and Dahomey (18th century - 1815), which trafficked people from Yoruba, Ewe, Minas, Hausa, Nupe and Borno; and the Illegal trafficking period, suppressed by England (1815-1851). During this period, to escape the supervision of the British ships, the slave traders began to seek alternative routes to the routes of the West African coast, turning to Mozambique. Early History  The slave trade had already a strong presence in Africa for thousands of years, at the time of the European Age of Discoveries. The Portuguese began contact with the African slave markets to rescue civilians and military captives since the time of the Reconquista. At this time, the Alfaqueque was the one who had the mission to negotiate captives rescue. When Catherine of Austria authorized the slave trade to Brazil, the slave trade from Africa, which was previously dominated by Africans, started also to be dominated by Europeans.Francisco F√©lix de Souza (1754-1849), the most famous Brazilian slave trader The lists of enslaved captives for ransom and freed during the reign of John V of Portugal reveal that even Brazilians were captured and sold in African markets. The slave trade to Brazil was not exclusive to European and Brazilian white traders, but it was an activity in which pumbeiros, who were mestizos, free blacks and also former slaves, not only dedicated to the slave trade as controlled trade coastal - in the case of Angola, also part of domestic trade - also played the role of cultural mediators in the Atlantic slave trade of Africa. See Francisco F√©lix de Sousa, freed at age 17, the largest Brazilian slaves trader.  The motive of trafficking - the sugar economy  From 1530, with the knowledge gained in the manufacture of sugar in the islands of Madeira and S√£o Tom√©, and then with the creation in 1549 of the General Government to Brazil, the Portuguese Crown sought to encourage the construction of sugar mills in Brazil. But the settlers found great difficulties in recruitment of manpower and lack of capital to finance the installation of sugar mills. The various epidemics that, from 1560, decimated the Indian slaves at an alarming rate, caused that the Portuguese Crown to create laws that prohibit, partially, the slavery of Indians, that is, \\"forbade the enslavement of converted Indians and only allowed the capture of slaves only through war against the Indians that they fight or devour the Portuguese, or Allied Indians or slaves; this war should be enacted by the sovereign or the Governor General.\\" Other adaptations of this law came later. The subsequent lack of a forced and free manpower for colonial exploitation meant that colonists began looking for ways to introduce labor from other sources.Rugendas - N√®gres a fond de cale As for the Dutch, from 1630, they began to occupy the sugar producing regions in Brazil, and to address the lack of slave labor, in 1638 embarked on the conquest of Portuguese warehouse of S√£o Jorge da Mina , and 1641, organized the take over of Luanda and Benguela in Angola. It is argued that the survival of the first gadgets, the planting of sugarcane, cotton, coffee and tobacco were the decisive elements in the metropolis sent to the Brazil the first African slaves, coming from different parts of Africa, bringing their habits, customs, music, dance, cuisine, language, myths, rites and religion, which has infiltrated the people, forming, next to the Catholic religion, the two largest religions in Brazil.  The first slaves and the legalization of slavery  The Portuguese crown authorized the slavery with papal blessing, documented in the inserts of Nicolau V Dum diversos e Divino Amorecommuniti, both of 1452, which authorized the Portuguese to reduce Africans to the condition of slaves with the intention of Christianizing. The regulation of slavery was legislated in Manueline ordinances: the adoption of slavery had been thus try to overcome the serious lack of manpower, that there was also all over Europe due to the recurrence of epidemics, many of them from Africa and the East. Until the first half of the fifteenth century, the Portuguese population was constant. As for African governments, whether they were of religious Muslim or other native religions, as practiced slavery long before the Europeans engage in trafficking. Several African nations had their dependent economies of the slave trade and saw the slave trade with the Europeans as another business opportunity. The earliest record of sending African slaves to Brazil dates from 1533 when Pero de Gois, Captain-Mor da Costa of Brazil, requested the King, the shipment of 17 black for his captaincy of S√£o Tom√© (Para√≠ba do Sul / Maca√©). a slave market in Rio de Janeiro by Edward Francis Finden in 1824 Then, by Charter of March 29, 1559, Mrs. Catherine of Austria, regent of Portugal, authorized each plantation owner of Brazil, with a statement by the Governor General, to import up to 120 slaves.  How Africans became slaves  When the Portuguese arrived in Africa, they found an African market widely implemented and quite extensive slaves. Africans were enslaved for various reasons before being acquired: * because they are prisoners of war; * attachment: people were pledged as collateral for the payment of debts; * abduction individual or a small group of people in attacking small villages; * exchange of a member of the community for food; * how to pay tribute to another tribal chief. Even when they were in Africa, it is estimated that the African death rate in the path that made from the place where they were captured by the merchants of local slaves to the coast where they were sold to Europeans was greater than that which occurred during the Atlantic crossing .BoaHen, Albert Adu \\"Hist√≥ria Geral da √Åfrica; Vol. VII ‚Äì √Åfrica sob domina√ß√£o colonial\\" UNESCO 2010 P√°ginas 541-42 Visualiza√ß√£o no Google Livros During the crossing, the mortality rate, although lower than on land, until the late eighteenth century remained daunting, with greater or lesser effect depending on the epidemics of riots and suicides carried out by the enslaved, the conditions prevailing on board, as well as the mood of the captain and crew of each slave ship.Rediker, Marcus \\"O Navio Negreiro\\" Ed. Companhia das Letras 2011  British pressure to abolish the slave trade  As a condition of its support for the Empire of Brazil's independence from Portugal, the United Kingdom demanded that Brazil agree to abolish the importation of slaves from Africa; as a result the British-Brazilian Treaty of 1826 was agreed, by which Brazil promised to ban all Brazilian subjects from engaging in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, commencing in the year 1830. However, Brazil largely failed to enforce this treaty; in response, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the Aberdeen Act of 1845, authorising British warships to board all Brazilian flagged vessels and detain those found to be carrying slaves. This British action was highly unpopular in Brazil, and was widely viewed as a violation of Brazil's sovereignty; however, the Brazilian government concluded that they could not afford a war with Britain over the issue, hence in September 1850, new legislation outlawing the slave trade was enacted, and the Brazilian government began to enforce it.

Their purpose was to convey minerals to market from the outcropping coal deposits that had encouraged industrial activity in the area from an early date. Several waggonways were built: the Fordell Railway, the Elgin Railway, the Halbeath Railway and others, with the objective of connecting collieries and quarries with harbours on the Firth of Forth. The Elgin Railway carried passengers from 1833 and formed the core of the Charlestown Railway and Harbour company, and finally in 1856 the West of Fife Mineral Railway was founded to build new lines. The Charleston and West of Fife companies combined to form the West of Fife Railway and Harbour. All the lines have ceased to exist, except that a short section of the Charlestown line forms part of the Inverkeithing to Dunfermline line. Background, limestone and coal The Dunfermline coalfield in 1847Coal deposits had been worked in the area close to the Fife coast for centuries. Coal had been important in the manufacture of lime, and of salt, both of which required huge quantities of coal.Bruce Lenman, An Economic History of Modern Scotland, 1660 - 1976, B T Batsford Ltd, London, 1977, Transport of heavy minerals before the era when roads had been properly made was expensive, and most minerals were carried on the backs of pack horses. The expense of even a short transit hugely increased the cost of the product. Proximity to water enabled boat transportation, and therefore mineral deposits close to the Firth were favoured, and were exploited first. Coal outcrops were worked since the fourteenth century, in shallow pits but as these were worked out, the workings had to move further away from water and transport became more difficult. In the eighteenth century much of the limestone from the area around Dunfermline was exported through Brucehaven, near Limekilns, but as the agricultural revolution gathered pace the demand for lime to improve land also accelerated.Duncan McNaughton, The Elgin or Charlestown Railway, privately published, Dunfermline, 1986, Before the era of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in the 1830s, many collieries used wooden waggonways to move the mineral. By the eighteenth century these had achieved a degree of sophistication with proper guidance systems, and flanged wheels on the waggons had become widespread, although not universal. These waggonways were developed principally on Tyneside, and in Shropshire, and the technology was disseminated at first from those places.M J T Lewis, Early Wooden Railways, Routledge and Keegan Paul, London, 1974, 0 7100 7818 8 Early Dunfermline mineral railwaysThree large waggonway networks were established by landowners to exploit coal and limestone deposits in their estates during this period; their systems were each referred to as railways, and they all continued into the modern railway era. The Fordell Railway The Fordell Railway had an unbroken operational existence of 180 years. It ran to St David's Harbour, about a mile east of Inverkeithing, from pits and quarries north of the harbour, and it was eventually extended northwards nearly to Cowdenbeath.J C Inglis and F Inglis, The Fordell Railway, The Munro Press Ltd, Perth, 1946 The Henderson family had owned extensive lands in the area since time immemorial, and coal had been worked since the sixteenth century. It was dug from outcrops at the surface, and was taken away by boat. As the outcrops became exhausted, overlying strata further from the coast had to be worked, and transport of the mineral to market was a significant challenge. The coal was carried in panniers on pack horses to a gathering point near Fordell Castle, and there by a coal road to Inverkeithing Harbour. In 1752 Sir Robert Henderson, the fourth baronet, acquired lands on the Firth of Forth about a mile east of Inverkeithing, and he constructed a harbour there. It became known as St David's harbour. Salt pans were established there and the coal road was extended to St David's. Vessels up to 600 tons could berth there. About 1770 Henderson had a wooden waggonway built to connect the pits and quarries to the harbour. It was four miles in extent. The waggonway followed the design principles of the Tyneside waggonways.John Thomas and David Turnock, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 15, North of Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1989, The track gauge was 4 ft 4inBertram Baxter, Stone Blocks and Iron Rails, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1966 and the gradients were steep: as much as 1 in 13 near Vantage. The wooden permanent way was laid with two timber beams making a rail, fir underneath and beech above; wood sleepers were at two-feet intervals. The rails were 10 to 11 feet in length, secured to each other and the sleepers by oak pins. The line was a single line throughout.This form of construction was often referred to as \\"the double road\\", referring to the two layers of timber, not the modern connotation of double track. John Henderson succeeded to the baronetcy on 19 October 1781 and he continued to improve the coal workings, constructing a prodigious drainage channel to drain the workings. He purchased the mineral rights to lands at Cuttlehill, further north in 1798, and extended the waggonway to pits there. In 1798 the cost of construction was thought to be ¬£450 per mile, and the maintenance cost ¬£560 for the entire 4.25 miles annually. The 48 cwt waggons required two horses to draw them. In December 1817 Henderson died and his daughter Anne Isabella inherited the estate, and in time she became the second wife of Sir Philip Calderwood Durham. From 1823 coal was exploited from Prathouse by the Halbeath Company, which had its own railway network. However they were unable to connect their new pit to their own network, so they leased the pit to Sir Philip Durham and the Fordell system was extended to reach it, from West Moss pits. The line was opened in 1841 - 1842. St David's Harbour was progressively improved in the nineteenth century as volumes of coal handled increased. It was deepened in 1826 and again in 1832 together with an extension to the pier. In 1844 an improved siding layout was installed, together with coal hoists. In March 1832 the mine manager, William L Gofton, submitted a plan for upgrading the line, which was agreed upon. A new pit called Lady Anne was sunk south of Cuttlehill in 1833 and the upgrading of the line started at the same time. There was a short tunnel under the Crossgates ‚Äì Donibristle road. There were to be two inclined planes; one at Colton (332 yards with a gradient of 1 in 24) and one at Fordell House, known as the Vantage incline. Vantage was 1148 yards long with a gradient of 1 in 23.75. At Hillend an extra horse was stationed to assist waggons up the incline. The inclined planes used a large wheel round which the rope (later a wire rope) passed and there was a brake on the drum enabling a man to control the speed of the movement; it was worked on the balanced system: four loaded waggons descended and hauled four empties up. The upper part of the inclined plane had three rails and the lower half was single track, with a passing loop at the mid point. Robert Hawthorn of Newcastle was asked to comment on the technical changes, and he proposed a further tunnel at Hillend bridge, under the Inverkeithing road, and a third inclined plane near St David's ending near the south pier. It was 480 yards long on a gradient of 1 in 28. The gauge of the new iron railway line was the same as the wooden railway and it was 4.6 miles in length, falling continuously from Lady Anne pit 440 feet above the track on the pier at St David's. The rails were 28 lbs per yard fish-bellied, procured from the Bedlington Iron Company. They were held in 9 lb iron chairs secure to whinstone block sleepers by two iron pegs. The joint sleeper blocks were double width and there were no fishplates. Between the inclines trains of four waggons were pulled by two horses. The cost of operation was thought to be about one-third of that with the wooden track system, and 50,000 tons were carried annually, considered to be double the maximum possible on the old track. The pit known as Wellington, renamed William in 1843, was also operating from 1843; coal was brought down from it to Lady Anne by a separate self-acting inclined plane. In 1847 no. 9 Pit was sunk, near to Lady Anne. Light parallel iron rails were used in the short branch connection. In 1850 the George Pit was sunk on the north of Cuttlehill; a standard gauge waggonway was built to connect to the nearby Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway. Up until this time all the output of the collieries (except a small amount of land sale) went for coastal and export shipping through St David's. However as the railway extended northwards, it now came close to the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway Dunfermline branch line near Crossgates, and in 1853 a separate short waggonway was built connecting the George Pit with the EP&DR.; This seems not to have diminished the volumes passing through St David's, due to the continuing expansion of the trade. The extensive trackwork at the Alice exchange sidings (near Crossgates) were all of mixed gauge. Trouble was experienced with the mixed gauge points, and some were converted to a type where the approach rails were shifted to meet the lead rails, so that there were no switch rails at all. From 1867 locomotive operation was planned on the line. The existing track was not strong enough to carry the loads of locomotives and relaying with steel rails was started from the St David's end, with some realignment to improve gradients. The Colton and Vantage inclines were reduced to single track, and the locomotive working started on 2 April 1868, a locomotive named St David's being the first to work. It was an 0-4-0 well tank built by Hawthorn & Co of Leith. It was brought in to St David's Harbour by boat. The relaying took place progressively, and the locomotive was restricted to the sections that had been dealt with. Some of the extremities were left with fish-bellied rails on stone sleepers and horse traction was used on them. In 1871 a second locomotive, St George, was obtained, also arriving by boat. St George was an 0-4-0 saddle tank. In 1880 Alice Pit was sunk near the main line of what was now the North British Railway (formerly the EP&DR;). For some considerable time the pit was not used, but it was decided to extend the waggonway across Moss Morran from William Pit to Alice Pit and then round to George Pit. Moss Morran was a difficult bog, and large quantities of brushwood were dropped into it to stabilise it. The extension was complete by 1895: the Fordell Railway was now 5.75 miles in extent. The line between the George Pit and the NBR main line was laid in mixed gauge track, so that the output of George Pit and Alice Pit could be sent either to St David's or to the main line railway. A third locomotive named Alice was obtained in 1880 from Grant, Ritchie & Co of Kilmarnock. It was an 0-4-0 saddle tank. This time the engine arrived by rail, at Crossgates, and was then drawn through the streets on temporary rails, drawn by horses. About 1870 the waggons began to be fitted with brakes. This enabled greater loads to be taken by the locomotives, as controlling the waggons on the downward run was the limiting factor. When the Forth Bridge was being completed, a new main line route from Inverkeithing to Burntisland was constructed, opened in 1890. At the point where its route intersected the Fordell Railway, the latter was lowered by 9 feet, and this resulted in a section of 814 yards on which there was a gradient against the load, of 1 in 464. The first two locomotives (St David's and St George) were scrapped about the end of the nineteenth century, and two new engines were acquired from Andrew Barclay, Sons & Co of Kilmarnock: they were named Fordell, arrived in 1901, and Lord Hobart in 1912. They had steam brakes (unlike the previous engines which had hand brakes only), and spring buffers for the main line rolling stock. Volumes of coal mined and carried on the line continued to increase, and a peak was reached in 1911 when 87,111 tons were mined and all of that output was carried on the Fordell Railway. The First World War reduced the volume of trade enormously, and after the cessation of hostilities, the trade at St David's never recovered, as shippers preferred to use nearby harbours which were better suited to handling larger vessels. That process accelerated to 1945, when the now-obsolete coal handling equipment at St David's was an insuperable limitation. During World War II the Admiralty was the only customer, it was agreed that the coal output would all be taken north to the Alice Pit (a little to the east of the George Pit, and adjacent to the former ED&PR; line) and taken away by main line railway. The last load of coal went to St David's on 10 August 1946. The line between Fordell Village and Alice Pit (and the connection to the main line there) continued in use. At the time of closure there were 190 waggons of the original pattern, all of them without springs and opening at one end only. Elgin Railway The Elgin Railway ran from several collieries and quarries north and north-west of Dunfermline to Charlestown harbour, west of Queensferry.Many contemporary accounts spell the place Charleston. Charles, the fifth Earl of Elgin owned collieries to the north and north-west of Dunfermline, and two harbours on the Forth: Charlestown and Limekilns. Both of these had limestone quarries nearby, and impressive arrays of lime kilns. Bruce extended limestone quarries near Broomhall, and built new kilns, before 1760. He constructed a harbour which he called Charlestown in 1761, and the works included a village with cottages for workers and ships' crews waiting for a tide. Lime burning required large quantities of coal, but nothing suitable was available on the Broomhall estate, and Elgin was dependent on supplies from workings at Pitfirrane and Urquhart. The road transit was difficult, and he attempted to interest his neighbouring landowners, Sir John Wedderburn of Gosforth, now of Pitfirrane, and Robert Wellwood of Garvock and Pitliver, in improving transport facilities; in 1762 he was corresponding with them over a possible waggonway, but little was done. Lord Elgin gradually acquired land to the foot of the Pittencrieff Coal Road with a view to construction of a waggonway. In 1765 George Chalmers of Edinburgh tried to persuade the Earl to grant a wayleave for a waggonway to replace the road transport. He had been to great trouble to discover the best Newcastle method, and wrote: \\"I suppose we can have people from Bo'ness or Carron who can make the waggons of a proper size and probably one which will hold 2¬Ω tons of coals may be sufficient for about 3 tons of limestone.\\" He said he would consult William Brown of Throckley. In 1769 Chalmers wrote to Ralph Carr of Newcastle saying that a five-mile waggonway over rough terrain had been surveyed but that he wanted Mr Brown's advice. Chalmers' ambitions were partly realised when a short line was built at Limekilns to serve the kilns themselves, and a wooden waggonway was built from limestone quarries and coal pits at Berrylaw (west of Dunfermline) to the coast at Limekilns. Some time between 1765 and 1780 a small network of lines to Charlestown was built, with an incline on a gradient of 1 in 6.7 on the final approach to Charlestown. Thomas Pennant in 1772 called in during one of his tours, and noticed that the limestone is conveyed into the kilns by \\"a variety of railroads\\". The waggonway from Berrylaw coal pits to Limekilns, a distance of three miles, was laid between 1772 and 1775.Baxter (page 232) treats this as a separate network, the Limekilns Railway. In 1777 the Pitfirrane pits and later those at Balmule and Urquhart to the north-east of Berrylaw were linked to Limekilns by a lengthy branch built by a Newcastle engineer, George Johnson. Perhaps by 1777 and certainly by 1792Lewis, probably derivative; Thomas and Turnock say maybe not until 1812. Charlestown kilns had waggonways too. Another branch was put in to Charlestown in 1801. Though the original Berrylaw - Limekilns waggonway survived for a time, most of it was finally removed, thus converting the two branches into the main line. This was probably done by 1812. The gauge of Elgin's lines was 4 ft 3in. The waggon capacity increased from 50 cwt to 60 cwt between 1784 and 1796. The waggons had two iron wheels and two plain wooden wheels, and were drawn by two horses. In 1794 Elgin's successor built a new line from Limekilns to recently acquired coal mines around Baldridge and Rosebank. The main flow on the second line was to Charlestown harbour. It is not certain when the line was relaid with edge rails, but it may have been completed in 1841. The system was expanding with branches to Netherton in 1812, Lady Elgin in 1823, to Francis and Bruce pits in 1826 and to Wellwood pit about 1840. Hunter and Tom pits were connected in 1850 and Balmudo pit about 1857. The track gauge was 4 ft; sleeper lengths of 5, 6 and 7 feet were used. In 1796 the system 8,230 yards of main line, 2,800 yards of bye way (i.e. sidings and passing loops) and 1,370 yards of check rails. About 1810 the track was converted to the use of iron edge rails. The waggon capacity was 50 cwt in 1784, increased to 60 cwt by 1796. In the early 1820s Elgin waggonway had spring catch points with iron rails, worked by remote control. In 1824 Alexander Scott described the line in a technical paper: > The railway on Lord Elgin's works, between Dunfermline and Limekilns in > Fife, for design and execution, is inferior to none. On this line of railway > there are two inclined planes, executed with all the requisite machinery, > for the loaded waggons drawing up the empty ones; the longest of these is > about 511 yards, with a declivity of about one in twenty. Between the two > inclined planes, the ground had been originally nearly level to some extent: > an ingenious advantage is taken of this level, by commencing, at a short > distance from the foot of the upper inclined plane, and cutting out a track > for a railway, with an easy slope in the line of the main descending railway > for the loaded waggons, by banking up the earth, and facing it with a stone- > wall; another railway is formed with a similar slope, but in a contrary > direction, towards the foot of the upper inclined plane. In this manner the > two railways are carried forward until they reach the top or bank-head of > the under inclined plane, where the difference of perpendicular height > between the two appears to be about 10 feet; the one-half of this height > gives a declivity to the loaded waggons to proceed downwards; and the other > half a declivity to the empty waggons, to proceed to the foot of the upper > inclined plane: the brake or drag of the loaded waggons has only to be > attended to, for regulating their motion to the place where they start on > the inclined plane. > By forming the two railways upon the original level line, in the manner > above described, the bank-head of the empty waggons is several yards from > the bank-head where the loaded waggons start: this distance is got the > better of, by means of an additional piece of rope or chain, that is hooked > off and on, as occasion requires.

Lewis points out that > Scott is referring to a back-to-back dimension; original drawings of 1821 - > 1823 show the gauge as 4ft. the weight of each of the waggons, when loaded, > is between 2 and 3 tons. From 100 to 200 tons of coal pass down this line > daily.Alexander Scott: Mr. Scott's Account of Railways, in Prize-Essays and > Transactions of the Highland Society of Scotland, volume vi, Edinburgh, 1824 The railway was later realigned; improvements may have been made by 1821 by the engineer Landale. Further improvements were made in the Coalbridge area in the 1830s to improve sharp curves, and there was a realignment at Merryhill in 1851 to meet the requirements of the Turnpike Trust. There was also a branch to Nethertown in Dunfermline, opened in 1833, and it was used for general freight traffic and passengers. This changed its nature from a purely mineral line and it became known, informally at first, as the Dunfermline and Charlestown Railway. The passengers were conveyed from 31 October 1833 from a \\"depot\\" at the foot of the Nethertown incline to Charlestown. A surprising number of the passengers travelled to Charlestown for the purpose of sea- bathing, which had become a popular craze. The extension to Nethertown itself was opened on 10 March 1834; this \\"Nethertown\\" was a little north of the 1812 branch terminus. Quick explains the first passenger operations: > Dunfermline was provided with a link to the Forth steamers. Towards the end > of 1833 a service was advertised from the junction of the coal road to > Charlestown, just short of the harbour. From 1834 it ran from the > Dunfermline station at Netherton (sic).

Quick states that the passenger service ended in September 1863.M E Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England Scotland and Wales‚ÄîA Chronology, The Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2002 Chalmers described the situation on Lord Elgin's railway: > His Lordship's coal is conveyed to his limeworks and shipping at Charleston > (sic) by a railroad, the two inclined planes of which, near the town of > Dunfermline, are much admired, and were executed, on a change of the line of > the rail-road in 1821, at very great expense, under the direction of the > late ingenious Mr Landale of Dundee.

As the changeover took a few days during which the line was closed, and an early railway replacement bus service was operated in substitution for the passenger trains, operated by John Croall and Co of Edinburgh. About 1850 a connection was made at Colton to the standard gauge line of the Stirling and Dunfermline Railway. Steam traction was adopted on the Elgin line. In 1852 Chalmers published a second volume, in which he described the adoption of steam engines: > Steam was for the first time introduced on the Railway to Charleston in > February 1852, whereby that seaport is brought within 10 or 12 minutes of > Dunfermline. There is one large railway carriage, able to accommodate about > 50 passengers... There are two inclines on the railroad near to the town of > Dunfermline and a third at the shore.

Halbeath Railway The Halbeath Railway ran from Sampson Lloyd's collieries near Crossgates and Dunfermline to the Forth at Inverkeithing where coal was exported, and also used in salt pans. A line of five miles in length was opened in 1783, using wooden track. In due course connections were made to other industries, including limestone quarries at Sunnybank, freestone quarries at Bonnyside and Rosebank and distilling at Borland. The construction costs had been estimated at ¬£750 per mile including the waggons. There were passing places on the single track at intervals of 550 yards. Traffic developed sufficiently to justify improvement of track with iron capping of the wooden rails by 1798. Iron edge rails were installed in 1811. The track gauge was 4 ft 4in. In 1841 a branch opened from Guttergates to Townhill collieries. (below) In the 1846 Parliamentary session the Bill for the Edinburgh and Perth Direct Railway was rejected. The North British Railway had hoped to expand northwards by an alliance with this company, and the NBR Board had decided to commit up to ¬£25,000 to the purchase of the Halbeath Railway, as it was anticipated that the route of the Halbeath would be used for a future main line north. ¬£10,000 was put down as a deposit. This caused an uproar at a shareholders' meeting as the Board was already under fire for committing the company's money to speculative schemes, and the shares in the Halbeath line that had been purchased were subsequently sold. When the Edinburgh and Northern Railway obtained authorisation for its line, the exact alignment of the Dunfermline branch left ambiguous the question of the intersection with the Halbeath Railway. When the time came to make the crossing, the E&NR; understood that a flat crossing was to be made, but the rival Edinburgh and Perth Direct Railway provisional committee still owned the Halbeath line, although it was moribund by this time. The E&PDR; committee still harboured thoughts of promoting their northward line, notwithstanding the earlier setback. Accordingly the Halbeath directors, prompted by the E&PDR;, refused to agree to a flat crossing of their line, and the completion of the Dunfermline branch was frustrated: it terminated for the time being at Crossgates in 1848. Negotiations with the Halbeath people failed to reach any sensible compromise, whether underbridge, overbridge, or anything else. It was only when the E&PDR; scheme was obviously doomed that the matter was resolved, and the Dunfermline branch was completed, making a flat crossing with the Halbeath line after all, and opening in 1849. The Halbeath line was abandoned as an operational railway in 1867. Nonetheless by now the NBR had acquired the entire company, and over several years when its utility as a springboard for a Perth line was gone, the NBR tried to sell it. In January 1869 the NBR noted that it was \\"a very bad investment, but we cannot get rid of it\\": no-one would buy it. In 1871 the entire Halbeath line was closed down and some of its track removed. In 1877 part of the trackbed was used for the Inverkeithing Harbour branch, an offshoot of the Dunfermline and Queensferry Railway, which had been taken over by the NBR. In 1882, 43 tons of scrap, probably rails, were sold from the line by the NBR, and by July 1896 all the rails had been lifted and sold except for 300 yards to Inverkeithing brickworks, and 377 yards at the northern end.David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, Townhill waggonway The town of Dunfermline owned the Townhill colliery, but found it difficult and expensive to transport its output to harbours on the Forth. After a long period during which road transport was used, a waggonway to join the Halbeath line at Guttergates was built; it opened in September 1841 from North Engine (Townhill No 1 Pit) with a short branch to Humbug. There was a fall of 100 feet to the junction with the Halbeath line, but an initial section of the route rose (against the load) to Bellyeoman before falling at 1 in 32. Venturefair waggonway There was a pit called Venturefair near the Town Loch: writing in 1879 Ebenezer Henderson said: > Early in the year 1812, Mr Syme completed a railway between his colliery at > Venture-Fair ... and Knabbie Street, where his town coal depot was situated. > This coal depot which was situated about the middle of Knabbie Street, north > side, at the back of the houses, has been disused for about fifty > years.Ebenezer Henderson, The Annals of Dunfermline and Vicinity: From the > Earliest Authentic Period to the Present Time, A.D. 1069-1878, Dunfermline, > 1879, quoted in Brotchie The line was a little over a mile long, and included a viaduct of four arches 30 feet high. The track was probably cast iron rails on stone sleepers. Townhill branch extension The Townhill branch was extended to connect with the Elgin system about the year 1856, and also to reach Wellwood colliery, which had lost its link with Charlestown by this time. Traffic on the Townhill line and its various connections then became dominant and the line to Halbeath had closed by 1850. In the end all the traffic from the Townhill area was routed to the NBR at Charlestown by the Elgin Railway and the link with Inverkeithing closed by 1867. Main line railways In 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened for traffic, and with its predecessor lines showed what a modern railway would be like: steam locomotives replaced horse traction, and waggons ran coupled together in trains. Speeds faster than a trotting horse were now taken for granted; and passengers were conveyed. The transition did not take place overnight, and for a long time purely mineral concerns did not associate themselves with the concept of a modern, relatively high speed railway. Moreover for several critical years, money was very tight. However the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway was authorised in 1838 and opened its main line in 1842, and the race was on to construct lines to connect with the emerging English railway network, and to form a Scottish system too. In 1845 a prodigious number of railway schemes were authorised, and not all of them were to be successful. However the Edinburgh and Northern Railway was constructed, and by an accident of railway politics the authorisation included a branch line from Thornton to Dunfermline, opened to Crossgates in 1848. The E&NR; reached Dunfermline in 1849. (It changed its name to the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway in 1849 also.) The other main line railway to enter Dunfermline at this time did so from the west: it was the Stirling and Dunfermline Railway, sponsored by the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway. It opened in 1849 and made an end-on connection with the E&NR; branch line. Together the two lines formed a continuous west to east line through the area. In fact after the battle in which the Halbeath Railway was used to obstruct the E&NR; line's construction, , the E&NR; was allowed to make a connection with the Townhill tramway and open up a standard gauge connection with the Townhill colliery by addition of a third rail. The same method was used to reach the Halbeath colliery. The Dunfermline and Charlestown Railway The Dunfermline branch was added to the Elgin system in 1834, before the arrival of the two main line railways. Passengers and general goods were conveyed from Dunfermline to Charlestown Harbour, which became an important ferry port for transport to Edinburgh. This changed the character of the Elgin Railway network from a simple mineral line to a general railway, and the route soon became known informally as the Dunfermline and Charlestown Railway. The entire network was 6 miles long between Wellwood, Baldridge and Charlestown Harbour. In the 1850s a line was added running eastwards across the north side of Dunfermline to join up with the Halbeath Railway system, giving access to the Halbeath collieries.John Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 1, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, Charlestown Railway and Harbour Company The Charlestown Railway and Harbour Company was incorporated on 8 August 1859, with capital of ¬£72,000. The Act empowered the new company to take over some of the network of the Elgin Railway, between Charlestown and a junction with the West of Fife Mineral Railway at Dunfermline (Townhill Junction), and to improve the harbour at Charlestown. Authorised capital was ¬£72,000.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 The Elgin lines that became part of the Charlestown Railway were already working co-operatively with the new West of Fife Mineral Railway (below), and the co-operation continued. West of Fife Mineral Railway The West of Fife Mineral Railway systemAs the extractive industries of West Fife developed, increasing numbers of pits needed a railway connection, and on 14 July 1856 the West of Fife Mineral Railway was authorised, to build a line between Dunfermline and Killairnie, on the way to Saline. Good quality blackband ironstone and limestone were known to be available as well as coal. The Dunfermline starting point was to be at or near the Elgin Railway Junction (which became Whitemyre Junction), and the termination was to be \\"at a Point in a Field or Enclosure on the Estate of Killairnie, adjoining the Junction of the Turnpike Road from Redcraigs to Saline, with the New Road leading there from to North Steelend\\". There was to be a branch to Kingseat. Authorised capital was ¬£45,000, and passenger operation had been mentioned in the prospectus and was authorised in the Act, although passengers were never actually carried. It opened as far as Steelend on 25 June 1858. The opening of the West of Fife, which was a railway of standard gauge using modern wagons, offering direct transit onward to the main line network, changed the nature of the mineral lines in the area, and the old waggonway lines suffered. By a further Act of 27 July 1859 the West of Fife was authorised to extend to Roscobie, and finally an Act of 23 July 1860 to extend the Kingseat branch to Beath. Construction of the line to Loch Fittie (the Kingseat branch) was delayed owing to a dispute over mineral rights. Additional powers, the West of Fife Mineral Railway (Kingseat Extension) Act of 23 July 1860, were needed for the line when it was finally built; it was completed after the end of the independent existence of the company. It served new workings south of Loch Fitty; development of these deep pits allowed the life expired Halbeath pits to be abandoned. The terminal point of the Kingseat branch was close to the end of the Kinross-shire Railway, and the lines were connected by the Kinross- shire Railway when the West of Fife line was built. The Kingseat branch became the West of Fife main line with a greater volume of traffic than the Steelend line, where collieries were much slower to develop. The West of Fife wanted to get access to the harbour at Charlestown: > The West of Fife Railway Company have just completed an arrangement, about > which there has been of late considerable negotiation, whereby they acquire, > at a cost we believe of ¬£62,000, the Charlestown Railway from the Right Hon. > the Earl of Elgin. The Charlestown Railway embraces the line from > Dunfermline to Charlestown Harbour... There will, we understand, be > considerable alterations effected by the new proprietors on the gradients of > the Charlestown line, so as to make the railway more available than hitherto > for passengers as well as for mineral traffic.Dundee, Perth, and Cupar > Advertiser, Tuesday 25 September 1860 On 1 August 1861 the West of Fife company merged with the Charlestown Railway and Harbour Company, and also the Elgin Railways, to form the West of Fife Railway and Harbour Company. Formal absorption was discussed in October 1858 and was formalised from 1 October 1861. West of Fife Railway and Harbour Company The West of Fife Railway and Harbour Company started its existence in a satisfactory financial position; at a shareholders' meeting on 13 September 1861 a 5% dividend was announced for Charlestown shareholders and 4% to West of Fife shareholders.Dunfermline Saturday Press, Saturday 14 September 1861 However since 1858 the West of Fife company had feared an incursion by the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, which had proposed a line from North Queensferry; if successful, such a line would seriously reduce the profitability of the West of Fife company, and consideration was given to a merger with the North British Railway. In North British Railway hands Accordingly, the independent existence of the new company did not endure long: by Act of 29 July 1862 the West of Fife Railway and Harbour Company was vested in the North British Railway. The former Elgin railway system declined rapidly in importance after the NBR takeover, when the company wished to make direct connection with its own standard gauge wagons, and parts of the network soon closed. On 27 October 1862 a new locomotive-worked incline down to the harbour at Charlestown was opened, replacing the rope worked incline. Improvement works were also carried out at the harbour itself. The new line was a single- track deviation at a gradient of 1 in 50, leaving the old line at Broadhills. The old line closed on 25 October 1862: at this time the passenger service was in operation and the new deviation had not been inspected by the Board of Trade inspector for approval for passenger operation, so a temporary station was built at Merryhill, the lowest point on the original line. Passengers had to walk the last half mile to Charlestown, and passenger usage immediately declined substantially. The passenger service ceased from 30 September 1863. Getting access to Charlestown from the main line railway network involved the use of the exchange sidings at Colton, west of Dunfermline. However the former Elgin line running south from there to Charlestown used the Pittencrieff incline, which was still rope-worked. The North British Railway Act of 1863 authorised a new line by-passing it. The new line left the Nethertown line at Liggar's Bridge (at a junction called Elbowend Junction) and continued eastwards, passing round the south and then northwards past the east side of Dunfermline, turning east again to join the Dunfermline to Cowdenbeath line at Townhill Junction. This new line opened during the first half of 1865. The Pittencrieff incline continued in use nonetheless, serving Baldridge Pit, until 1875. The new line was the basis of the later Dunfermline and Queensferry Railway approach to Dunfermline, but at this stage it was a mineral railway only. The West of Fife line had been engineered by Thomas Bouch, who had made a name for himself building low-cost railways, avoiding expensive and‚Äîhe argued‚Äîunnecessary engineering features. From 1875 the North British Railway found it necessary to regrade and reconstruct much of the original sections of the West of Fife line. On 1 June 1880 the NBR opened a connection from Lilliehill Junction to Townhill Junction, providing a more convenient connection to the West of Fife mineral lines. The Dunfermline and Queensferry Railway had long been proposed, and it was finally opened on 2 November 1877, leaving the Charlestown line at Charlestown Junction. It had been conceived as an alternative route for ferry passengers crossing the Forth at Queensferry. It was promoted independently, and the North British Railway had promised financial support, but as it became increasingly likely that a Forth Bridge would soon be built, the NBR lost interest, and the little company had to fall back on its own resources. It used a Comely Park passenger station in Dunfermline (later renamed Dunfermline Lower in 1890) and Townhill Junction at Dunfermline faced eastwards. Until 1890 there was no Forth Bridge: the east and north of Fife were reached from Edinburgh by crossing the Firth of Forth by ferry to Burntisland. Alternatively, Perth could be reached by way of Falkirk, crossing the Forth at Stirling. During the planning and construction of the Forth Bridge, the North British Railway set about designing the network of lines needed to reach it directly. On the south side a new line was built from Saughton Junction to South Queensferry. On the north side the 1877 Dunfermline and Queensferry line led to the approaches to the bridge. In the Dunfermline area, a new south-to-west curve was built at Touch Junctions, enabling trains from the Forth Bridge to turn west to the original Dunfermline (Upper) station. Comely Park station in Dunfermline was renamed Dunfermline Lower. Burntisland had become a major port for the export of coal from the Fife coalfields. A direct line from Inverkeithing to Burntisland was needed, enabling trains crossing the Bridge to turn east and reach Burntisland, Kirkcaldy and the coastal towns. The junction at Inverkeithing was made a triangle so that coal trains from west and north of Dunfermline could run direct to Burntisland. These lines all opened in 1890. On 1 September 1894 a new passenger service was instigated on the Charlestown line; it continued until 1 November 1926. Four southbound and three northbound services are shown in the 1895 Bradshaw, supplemented by one Mondays only return working and four Saturdays-only trips. Journey time from Dunfermline Lower was 10 to 15 minutes.Bradshaw's General Steam Navigation and Railway Guide, 12th mo, (December) 1895, reprinted by Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2011, An intermediate passenger station on the Charlestown line was opened early in March 1916; it was named Crombie Halt, and was provided for munitions workers at the Royal Ordnance Depot. It was later opened to public use on 1 March 1921, renamed Braeside. It closed with the line in 1926. Bruce comments on the sharp curves and steep gradients of the branch, which had four intermediate siding connections.William Scott Bruce, The Railways of Fife, Melven Press, Perth, 1980, Freight traffic continued to use the Charlestown line until 1964 serving a Royal Navy Armaments Depot. In 1906 the North British Railway opened a connecting line towards its Kincardine branch, joining the former Charlestown route at Elbowend Junction. A lengthy three mile extension beyond Steelend on the West of Fife line was built by the North British Railway in 1909 for, and at the expense of, John Wilson MP, who had plans for mining on the western side of Saline hills. The line was called the Sheardrum branch; Wilson's expectations were not well fulfilled, and the branch and the mines were not successful, and the extension closed in 1935. St David's harbour was placed under naval control during World War I, as the important Royal Navy Dockyard of Rosyth was close by. The closure to commercial business meant that after the war, most customers had taken their business elsewhere. A platform was constructed on the Charlestown branch for the use of workers at Crombie Depot. Work started in December 1915 and it opened on 25 May 1916. It was for the use of workmen employed at the depot only. However the station was opened to the general public as Braeside on 1 March 1921; this was the last station to be opened by the North British Railway. Closure The passenger service to Charlestown was withdrawn at the beginning of November 1926, possibly 1 November 1926, although Crombie depot continued to receive a considerable goods traffic, up to twenty wagons daily. The Kincardine line passenger service was withdrawn from 7 July 1930. Braeside Halt had closed on 1 August 1926.Gordon Stansfield, Fife's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing, Catrine, 1998, By the end of World War II the geological reserves of the Dunfermline coalfield were nearing exhaustion, and the mineral railways were dependent on the coal mining for their own survival. The decline continued and by 1963 nearly all of the West of Fife mineral lines had closed. The West of Fife Railway section from Gask Junction to Steelend closed on 7 June 1951, and the West of Fife line to Gask Junction and Lathalmond depot closed on 5 July 1951. The Nethertown goods branch from Elbowend Junction closed on 3 August 1959, and the Whitemyre Junction to Lilliehill Junction main line closed on 2 September 1963. Lilliehill was still reached directly from Townhill Junction until that route too closed on 31 December 1976. Meanwhile Charlestown goods closed on 24 February 1964. From February 1964 the Charlestown line to Crombie Depot was leased to the Admiralty, but that closed in December 1990. In fact all that remained were two lines. The route from the Forth Bridge to Dunfermline Lower and Townhill Junction continued as an important passenger and goods route, and this remains in use at the present time. The second was the Kincardine Line, which connected with the Charlestown branch at Elbowend Junction. This had lost its passenger service in 1930, and was sustained by two coal fired power stations. One has since closed and the other will have closed by March 2016. Re-opening of the line to passenger traffic has been proposed; it is not clear at present (2015) whether this is viable.

It was authorised in 1873 and its promoters had obtained informal promises from the larger North British Railway that the NBR would provide financial help, and also operate the ferry and the necessary railway on the southern side of the Firth of Forth. In fact the NBR realised that the Forth Bridge would be built before long and that money spent on the Queensferry line would be wasted. They withdrew their support and the little company tried to build its line alone, but it soon ran out of money and had to sell out to the NBR. The NBR completed the line and opened the south-side connecting line, but the opening of the Forth Bridge in 1890 reduced the Queensferry line to a minor branch line. History For centuries there have been a number of places where ferries took passengers and goods across the Forth, and one of these was at the narrow part of the Firth of Forth at Queensferry. When the Scottish railway network began to take shape from 1845, the two main northward routes authorised were to cross the Forth in Stirling, or to cross it directly opposite Edinburgh. The former course was taken by the Scottish Central Railway, which connected Castlecary on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway with Perth via Stirling. The latter course was adopted by the Edinburgh and Northern Railway, which built its line from Burntisland to Perth and Tayport,The E&NR; used the name Ferryport-on-Craig at first, and then the spelling Tay-Port. opposite Broughty, east of Dundee. The SCR route was considered a large detour by way of Falkirk and Larbert, but the E&NR; route involved a significant ferry crossing, and a second one to cross the Tay to reach Dundee. The E&NR; later introduced roll-on roll-off train ferries for goods and mineral wagons, avoiding transshipment.John Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 1, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, First railways authorised The Edinburgh and Northern railway and the Scottish Central Railway were authorised in the 1845 Parliamentary session. The Edinburgh and Northern proposal had been controversial, and in particular a rival scheme, the Edinburgh and Perth Direct Railway, came a close second. The E&PDR; wished to cross the Forth at Queensferry, thence running northwards through Dunfermline. For a time it looked as if the E&PDR; scheme would be approved, but in fact it was eventually rejected by Parliament and disappeared from the scene. The railway through Fife to the north would cross at Burntisland. These railways were substantially complete by 1849, and they were extremely popular and commercially successful. Nonetheless other routes continued to thrive, and the ferry at Queensferry was one such. It was encouraged by the fact that the railway route from Dunfermline to Edinburgh was extremely circuitous. There were two railways serving Dunfermline, a branch of the Edinburgh and Northern Railway (which had by now renamed itself the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway), and the Stirling and Dunfermline Railway. Reaching Edinburgh with the former involved travel by way of Thornton before turning south, and then enduring the ferry crossing. The latter also involved a large detour, through Stirling and Larbert. The difficulty of these indirect routes rankled with the citizens of Dunfermline, who many times petitioned the EP&DR; and its successor, the North British Railway for a direct railway route. Many promises were given but the perception in Dunfermline was that the promises were worthless.John Thomas and David Turnock, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 15, North of Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1989, Connecting Dunfermline by rail to Edinburgh The Dunfermline and Queensferry Railway systemIn 1861 the possibility of a Queensferry route seemed to have been revived, and three Bills went to Parliament to authorised such a line. One was the EP&DR;'s own line, to run from Dunfermline; an independent line was to run from Dunfermline to join the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway; and the E&GR; itself proposed a line from its own main line to Dunfermline. These three lines were essentially similar, and they all involved a ferry crossing at Queensferry. The ferry might involve roll-on roll-off arrangements as at Burntisland, and maybe there might even be a bridge, crossing from Blackness to Charlestown, a little to the west. The North British Railway had absorbed the EP&DR; in 1862, and brought considerable additional financial power to the matter, yet seemingly without decisive action. Thus in 1864 the Fife Herald reported that: > As yet, there is no preparation for laying the trunk line between Edinburgh > and Dunfermline and northwards to Perth. It appears that the North British > Company are contemplating the abandonment of the route by the Queensferry, > and the adoption of another higher up the Firth by means of a bridge. The > report of the Directors says, \\"Another cause has dictated caution in the > commencement of the expensive works on the southern portion of the > Dunfermline Railway. The conviction has gradually become stronger, that a > bridge over the Firth of Forth, at no great distance from Queensferry, might > be erected without extravagant cost... In the present [Parliamentary] > session, two bills have passed the second reading in the House of Commons, > each containing application for power to erect a bridge... with this > advantage, that the northern terminus of each of these bridges would abut > upon the company's railway at Charleston, [sic] and this [would] open > immediate communication with Edinburgh and Glasgow from Fife by means of its > existing lines from Perth and Dundee via Dunfermline...\\" > Every one who reads this will easily spell out its real meaning--the > abandonment of the Queensferry route--and the consequent abandonment of the > whole design of an Edinburgh, Dunfermline and Perth railway, although it has > received the sanction of Parliament. A bridge across the Firth at > Charleston! Such an undertaking as this would cost a million of money,The > Forth Bridge actually cost ¬£3.2 million. and would be an act of folly very > unlikely to be perpetrated by a covey of sharp-witted railway directors.Fife > Herald: Thursday 17 March 1864 The NBR firmly committed itself to the Forth Bridge at Charlestown in 1865, but the project was still on the back burner as the company gave the Tay Bridge priority. Thomas Bouch had designed the crossing, which was to involve two suspension bridge sections. But when the Tay bridge suffered a partial collapse in the Tay Bridge disaster in 1879, Bouch's work was naturally suspended. In 1882 the authorising Bill was passed in Parliament for the Forth Bridge that is in place today.David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, The Dunfermline and Queensferry Railway The pressure in Dunfermline for a better route to Edinburgh led to an excess of enthusiasm, encouraged by incautious hints from NBR directors, and it was supposed that a rail and ferry route via North Queensferry and Port Edgar, a pier opposite on the southern shore, was feasible. A Dunfermline and Queensferry Railway was put forward for the northern shore, and the NBR were understood to have promised a railway on the south side, connecting Port Edgar. Even better: a roll-on roll-off ferry, as at Burntisland, might be installed. The Dunfermline and Queensferry Railway obtained Parliamentary authorisation by Act of 21 July 1873; there was to be an improved pier at North Queensferry for the ferry. The North British Railway was involved with the company financially and in the Board of the D&QR;, but by now it had become obvious within the NBR that the way forward was a Forth Bridge. The expenditure on that scheme would be huge, and any money diverted to connecting the Queensferry route would be wasted. The NBR nominees on the D&QR; Board were instructed to do all they could to slow the rate of progress of the planning and construction of the railway. In June 1874 the NBR prevarication came to a head when the D&QR; directors re-issued the company's prospectus, and decided to go it alone without the promised NBR financial support, which was obviously not going to be made available. This was not going to be easy as the available capital was scarce, but the first sod was cut on 3 April 1875. However only a part of the necessary capital was subscribed, and with their railway partly built, the Company had to accept that they had run out of money, and construction was halted. Realistically there was only one way out: a sale at a low price to the North British Railway. The Falkirk Herald reported the shareholders' meeting at which the painful truth was made known: > At an extraordinary meeting of the shareholders of the Dunfermline and > Queensferry Railway, held at Dunfermline on Thursday [15 February 1877], the > directors submitted the terms of amalgamation with the North British > Railway. These they spoke of as disappointing, but stated that, under all > the circumstances, and keeping in view the unexpected increases in the cost > of constructing the railway, they had reluctantly come to the conclusion > that they had no alternative but to recommend their acceptance. The > amalgamation is to date from 31st July. The North British are to be entitled > to all the assets and assume all the liabilities of the company; the fully > paid-up share capital to become North British Preference Stock, bearing a > fixed dividend of 3 per cent. per annum from 1st February 1878, with a lien > on the line; they are to provide the necessary passenger accommodation at > Port Edgar, and open the route from Edinburgh to Dunfermline via Queensferry > without delay. After a lucid explanation of the state and prospects of the > company, the Chairman, the Earl of Elgin, who said he had not the smallest > possible trust in the promises of the North British directors, moved the > approval and confirmation of the memorandum of amalgamation... [and] > ultimately the heads of agreement were, by a majority, approved of.Falkirk > Herald: Thursday 22 February 1877 Elgin's view was hardly balanced: shareholders got 3% preference shares, and the NBR took the whole of the escalated debt of the D&QR.;E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 The NBR now hastened the completion of the D&QR;, and it opened on 2 November 1877.Thomas, volume 1, page 242, says 1 April 1878; Brotchie and Jack say 1 November 1877. At the same time a short branch to Inverkeithing Harbour was built, partly on the trackbed of the Halbeath Railway. There was a station in Dunfermline called Comely Park; it was renamed Dunfermline Lower on 5 March 1890. By the time the railway opened (by the NBR), local newspapers had decided that the NBR was the villain of the piece: > Opening of the Dunfermline and Queensferry Railway: Unaccompanied with > ceremony of any kind, the new railway connecting Dunfermline with Edinburgh, > by way of Queensferry, was opened on Thursday [1 November 1877]. The new > line is six miles in extent...

This, of course, necessitated a long and vexatious delay, which was > the more inconvenient considering that the coach conveys the mails.Falkirk > Herald: Thursday 6 December 1877 On 2 June 1890 the Forth Bridge opened. Main line and local traffic could cross the Firth of Forth by the bridge, and ferry alternatives were immediately closed. The Dunfermline and Queensferry line continued in use, but was now a minor branch line. The approach to the Forth Bridge from Dunfermline used the original Dunfermline and Queensferry Railway route as far as Inverkeithing, and this was now converted to double track. Rosyth dockyard A short connection off the Queensferry line to Rosyth Dockyard was opened on 1 January 1918, during World War I. Twenty trains daily ran from Edinburgh to the dockyard, carrying workmen and naval personnel. The dockyard connection remained in use after the end of the war, and although only sporadically used, is still available at the present day. North Queensferry itself closed to goods traffic in October 1954. After closure In 2018 the tunnel at the North Queensferry end of the line was found to be degrading. The tunnel lies under the approach roads for the Forth Road Bridge. It was filled with polystyrene blocks and sealed off. The blocks can be removed in the future if the tunnel is ever re-opened.

Description This fish grows to a maximum standard length of , but a more usual length is . The jaws are of equal length and the mouth slopes obliquely downward; the front row of teeth are large and flattened, and are tipped with brown. The body is laterally compressed and moderately deep. The dorsal fin has twelve or thirteen spines and nine to eleven soft rays. The anal fin has three spines and nine to ten soft rays. The colour is silvery with four to six dark longitudinal stripes which do not extend onto the caudal fin. There may be a dark patch behind the head and another in front of the dorsal fin. The caudal fin may be either pale or dusky. Distribution and habitat Pelates quadrilineatus is native to the western Indo-Pacific region. Its range extends from the eastern coast of Africa and the Red Sea to northern Australia, New Guinea and Japan. It also occurs in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, having passed through the Suez Canal as a Lessepsian migrant. It occurs on reefs in coastal waters at depths down to about , often being found in estuaries and brackish water. The juveniles also occur in seagrass meadows and among mangroves.

Housed in the Phuktal Gompa, it is the only centre of learning for the remote villages located in the Lungnak Valley, which is cut off from the rest of the Ladakh region and has no direct vehicular connectivity. People ferry supplies on horses, donkeys, and mules in the warmer months, and in the frozen winters, they are transported through the frozen Zanskar River. No fees are charged from the students, and the monastery bears the cost for the room, board and study materials of the students, with help from sponsors. A lot of the students are children from the local farming families in the Lungnak Valley, which are extremely poor and least educated. The older generations are nearly totally uneducated. While they understand the importance of education, they can't afford to send their kids away, outside the Zanskar Valley. Hence, a school like Phuktal Monastic School offers the best of both worlds, by imparting quality education, for free, and without the students having to leave the valley. History The school was set up in 1993, at the behest of Geshe Lharampa Nagri Choszed (1920‚Äì1998), a native of Tibet, who came to Phuktal in 1959 after the Chinese invasion of Tibet. Nagri Choszed brought with him a high level of Buddhist philosophical education and training, to which the isolated Phuktal monks had had virtually no access for several centuries. He restored the ancient tradition of learning and scholarship at Phuktal and instructed the monks in philosophy, traditional ritual systems, and moral discipline. He also sent out many monks to for the purpose of advance learning at other institutions, who returned to Phuktal and began to teach. In 2014, the Phuktal Monastic School facility was completed. The new facility had student accommodation and housing, multiple classrooms, staff quarters, offices, a library, the Sowa-Rigpa medicine centre, a kitchen, a dining hall, and a prayer-assembly hall. This helped the school increase its enrolment significantly. Curriculum and Student life Complete education is provided, which involves a mix of traditional learning, which ensures preservation of the unique Zanskari cultural and spiritual heritage and the spread of dharma, and modern curriculum, which readies them for the world. The school currently provides primary (grades 1 to 4) and middle school (grades 5 to 8) education, after which students take a transfer to other higher or secondary schools. By that age, the students are older and more mature to leave the valley by themselves. The school has an integrated curriculum and includes natural sciences, social sciences, Hindi, English, and written Tibetan (Bhodi). It also includes traditional Tibetan subjects such as Tibetan Buddhist philosophy and Sowa-Rigpa medicine, the Tibetan science of natural medicine. The Phuktal Gompa maintains a Traditional Tibetan medical clinic and makes many of the natural medicines itself. As future members of the Gompa, the students are trained in all aspects of monastic life and life as a monk, including prayers, rituals, festivals, hymns, among other things. The day of the student begins early, with prayers at sunrise followed by exercise, and then learning. Classrooms are often open to the air. The teaching faculty of the Phuktal Monastic School consists of Geshes, the Tibetan Buddhist equivalent of a master's degree, and is an academic degree for monks and nuns. Geshes are responsible for not only imparting education to their students on subjects in the curriculum, but also all aspects of dormitory life, since students often live at the Monastery during their school life. At present, there are three Geshes at the school. Phuktal River Blockade and Floods On 31 December 2014, a landlisde occurred between the Shun and Phuktal villages. This caused the formation of a landslide dam on the Phuktal River. It was first noticed due to the recession in the water level of the Nimoo Bazgo Hydroelectric Plant down the river. The lake formed behind the dam increased in length and height as compared to the height of the blockade. In May 2015, the Phuktal River flooded and washed away the entire school campus. The building, equipment, materials, and stores were all destroyed. The monastery has applied to the Jammu and Kashmir State Government and the Central Government for grants and financial aid to help rebuild the school and monastery and undo the damage of the flood.

It was designed by the architect Norman Shaw, who built some of the houses in that area. The church was consecrated in 1880. It is constructed in what has been described both as Queen Anne revival style and as Perpendicular Gothic style modified with English domestic features. Its services are Anglo-Catholic. History=Construction The South front, on to Bath Road St Michael and All Angels began as a temporary building on Chiswick High Road opposite Chiswick Lane, some distance from its present site, in 1876. The present church at the corner of Turnham Green Terrace and Bath Road, near Turnham Green tube station, was designed by the architect Norman Shaw. He was the Estate Architect for Bedford Park, designing some of its earliest houses in red brick and white-painted woodwork, known as Queen Anne revival style. Although this style was considered novel but not particularly ecclesiastical by the architect G. E. Street at the time, Shaw decided to use a similar style for the church. The red bricks, as used for Bedford Park houses, were made locally. The architectural writer James Stevens Curl describes the style as \\"Perpendicular Gothic with seventeenth- and eighteenth-century domestic features\\". cited by Victorian Web. He also notes that the wooden features of the church were originally painted pale green. The foundation stone was laid on 31 May 1879. The church was consecrated on 17 April 1880. A churchwarden of St Nicholas Church, Chiswick, the brewer Henry Smith of Chiswick's Fuller Smith & Turner objected in writing to the Bishop of London, raising controversy about the high Anglo-Catholic form of service used in the church. The poet and writer on English architecture John Betjeman called it \\"a very lovely church and a fine example of Norman Shaw's work.\\" This is based on In 1887 Shaw's vision for an additional North aisle was realised by the church's first churchwarden, the architect Maurice Bingham Adams. At the same time he added the church hall on the north side, its red brick harmonising with the church, the font, and the pulpit. Adams added the Chapel of All Souls in a more Gothic style than the rest of the church in 1909. War memorials There are two war memorials, both dedicated to parishioners who died in the First World War. One is beside the main rood screen. Its design, by a \\"Mr. Robinson of Westminster\\" was announced in the Parish magazine of September 1917 to \\"take the form of Cavalry in oak over the choir screen\\", at a planned cost of around ¬£100. The rood screen memorial was unveiled on 28 September 1918, on the eve of the Patronal Feast of St Michael and All Angels. The bronze plaque with the names of the 91 fallen was completed in 1919. The other memorial is just outside the church, by the church hall. It is in the form of a semi-circular stone bench, and is Grade II listed. Dedicated to the local victims of the First World War, it was designed by Inigo Triggs and completed around 1920. In the 1960s, the original nameplates were stolen, and when the memorial was re-sited in its current position, engraved stone replacements were installed. Restoration The church's roof and stained glass windows were seriously damaged by a Second World War bomb which destroyed the nearby Chiswick Polytechnic. The East Window was filled with new stained glass by Lawrence Lee in 1952. The church's exterior and roof were restored in 1980. In 2013 the bishop of London celebrated the completion of a 5-year project to replace the church organ. The new organ, which has 1667 pipes and 25 stops, was made by the Swiss company La Manufacture d'Orgues St Martin. Present day On 11 July 1951, the church was designated a Grade II* listed building. The church is within the Anglo- Catholic tradition of the Church of England.

It was found in the Karowe mine, (formerly called AK6) in Botswana on 16November 2015. British jeweller Graff bought the rough diamond for $53 million in 2017. By April 2019, Graff had cut it into one large emerald cut diamond, the Graff Lesedi La Rona, weighing and 66 smaller stones.  Description  The Lesedi La Rona is a colourless/white, type IIa diamond. It weighs and measures . In comparison, the Cullinan, discovered in 1905 in South Africa, weighed . The Lesedi La Rona was mined using Large Diamond Recovery (\\"LDR\\") XRT machines, and is the largest diamond recovered using machines for automated diamond sorting. It is estimated to be over 2.5 billion years old. It was found on 16November 2015, in the South Lobe of the Karowe mine about below the surface, and the find was announced on 18November. A day after the discovery, two more diamonds weighing were found in the mine. Since the AK6 pipe was opened 18 months earlier, it has yielded over of diamonds. The stone was too big for the company's scanners.  Name  The diamond was first given a generic name after the mine (Karowe) and the pipe (AK6) where it was found. On 18January 2016, Chief Executive Officer William Lamb of Lucara Diamond announced a competition, open to all Botswana citizens, to name the stone. In addition to naming the diamond the winner would receive P25,000 (about $2,170). On 9February 2016, Lucara Diamond announced that the stone had been named Lesedi La Rona which means \\"Our Light\\" in the Tswana language. The winner of the competition who named the diamond was Thembani Moitlhobogi from Mmadikola. He stated that his reason for the name was that \\"the diamond is a pride, light and hope of Botswana\\". During the competition Lucara Diamond Corporation received 11,000 emails and 1,000 SMSs with name suggestions.  History  Diamond mines and kimberlite fields in Botswana The diamond was found in the south lobe of Canadian company Lucara Diamond's Karowe Mine about north of Gaborone in Botswana. The mine is located in the Letlhakane region, where three other diamond-producing kimberlite fields have mines named Orapa, Letlhakane and Damtshaa, with the Debswana Diamond Company Ltd. The first diamond from the mine was retrieved in 2012. Botswana, South Africa and Namibia are the world's three top producers of mined diamonds. In the months after its discovery the diamond was exhibited in a world tour in Singapore, Hong Kong, New York, and Antwerp, a major centre of the world diamond trade.  Value, first auction and sale  The exact value of the stone cannot be determined until it is decided how it will be cut and more details about its colour are known. Former diamond-mining geologist Phil Swinfen estimates, based on other similar sales, that the stone could be sold for $40‚Äì60 million. The process of selling and cutting the diamond \\"will likely take years to complete\\". In May 2016, Sotheby's in London announced that the Lesedi La Rona diamond would be offered in a stand-alone auction on 29 June 2016. It was expected to sell for around $70 million. After closer examination, the diamond was presented at the auction as weighing 1,109 carats. The highest bid for the diamond was $61 million. However, this bid fell short of the undisclosed reserve price and the stone was not sold. The bidding opened at $50 million and the auction lasted for less than 15 minutes. In June 2016, Lesedi La Rona was insured for $120 million. It was sold in September 2017 for $53 million to British jeweller Graff Diamonds.  Cutting  On 10 April 2019, jeweller Graff presented the stones cut from Lesedi La Rona. It was divided into one large and 66 smaller diamonds. Due to the size of the rough stone, Graff had to custom-build a new scanner with new imaging software to analyze it for the cutting. The main stone, named the Graff Lesedi La Rona, is the world's largest emerald-cut diamond. It is a D-color (totally colorless), high-clarity stone weighing . According to Graff, the stone is the \\"largest highest clarity, highest color diamond ever graded by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA)\\". The other 66 stones cut from the original Lesedi La Rona range in size from to below . Each stone is inscribed with ‚ÄúGraff, Lesedi La Rona‚Äù and a specific GIA number.  Technology  The diamond was recovered by a TOMRA large diamond recovery (LDR) machine utilizing X-ray transmission sensors. In May 2015, the operation at the Karowe Diamond Mine replaced their Dense Media Separation (DMS) technology with six TOMRA XRT sorters for sorting material in the -60+8 mm size range. The X-ray transmission (XRT) sorting technology was selected following a suite of tests. Each sorter can sort up to of material per hour, after that the concentrate goes directly to hand sorting.

It is the third bridge at this location: the original timber bridge burned in 1875 and was replaced by an iron bridge, which lasted until 2017. Previous bridges The first bridge, a wooden trestle, in 1864 The Erie Railroad Company built a wooden trestle bridge over the Genesee River just above the Upper Falls in the mid-1800s. Construction started on July 1, 1851, and the bridge opened on August 14, 1852. At the time, it was the longest and tallest wooden bridge in the world. In the early morning hours of May 6, 1875, the bridge was destroyed in a tremendous fire. The bridge was a total loss, leaving only the stone bridge abutments. Immediately after the fire, officials of the Erie Railroad Company moved quickly to replace the wooden bridge with one built of iron and steel. Construction began on June 8, 1875, and the bridge opened for traffic on July 31, 1875. The bridge was long and high. This bridge was used until December 10, 2017. Despite the weight restriction, the 400-ton Nickel Plate 765 passed over the bridge with passenger coaches as part of a heritage excursion in August 2015. left Popular local rumor contends that the Portage Bridge was used for a famous scene in the 1986 movie Stand By Me. In reality, the bridge used in the movie is the Lake Britton Bridge in McArthur-Burney Falls Memorial State Park near Redding, California. Current bridge On November 29, 2011, Norfolk Southern Railway announced plans to build a new bridge approximately to the south of the 1875 bridge. Norfolk Southern offered the 1875 bridge to the State of New York, but the State declined it. A steel arch design for the new bridge, estimated to cost $71 million, was approved in late 2014. Construction started on October 27, 2015. Following the normal seasonal closing of the Portageville entrance for the winter in 2015, it will remain closed until completion of the project, expected to be in 2018. By late 2016, surveying work for the foundation of the new bridge was underway. In March 2017, construction of the main arch began. On December 11, 2017, the first train crossed the new bridge. The last of the 1875 bridge was demolished on the morning of March 20, 2018. Norfolk Southern formally named the new bridge the \\"Genesee Arch Bridge\\" on May 24, 2018.

In July 2015, Petroleum Development Oman and GlassPoint Solar announced that they signed a $600 million agreement to build the 1 GWth solar field. The project will be one of the world's largest solar field measured by peak thermal capacity. The plant uses large mirrors to focus sunlight and convert oilfield water into steam, which is then used to extract viscous or heavy oil from the ground. This method is used as an alternative to steam generated from the burning of natural gas.  Overview  An aerial view of the Miraah facilityMiraah will be one of the world's largest solar plants, with a solar thermal capacity of 1,021 MW. Construction on the project began in October 2015, with first steam produced in November 2017. A few months later, in February 2018, the facility was officially inaugurated. The project has a daily steam output of up to 6,000 tons, translating into annual gas savings of and annual CO2 emission savings of 300,000 tons. The 1 GWth project will reduce the amount of natural gas used to generate steam for thermal enhanced oil recovery (EOR). In thermal EOR, steam is injected into an oil reservoir to heat the oil, making it easier to pump to the surface. Miraah will generate an average of 6,000 tons of solar steam each day, providing a substantial portion of the steam required at the Amal oilfield operated by Petroleum Development Oman (PDO).A look at the curved mirrors used at the Miraah facility The enclosed trough solar field uses curved mirrors to focus sunlight ‚Äì rather than using heat from burning natural gas ‚Äì onto a pipe filled with water. The concentrated sunlight boils the water to create steam, which is fed directly to the oilfield's existing steam distribution network. In November 2017, GlassPoint and Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) completed construction on the first block of the Miraah solar plant safely on schedule and on budget, and successfully delivered steam to the Amal West oilfield.

It is in the southern Brahmic family of scripts. Due to its script family, it has similarities to the Burmese alphabet, Mon alphabet, and Chakma alphabet. Origin The Tanchangya alphabets were introduced recently in 2012 by adopting a manuscript in Rakhine State as stated by Rupak Debnath.Rupak-Debnath (2008): 167 Though both Chakma and Tanchangya have been using the present Chakma alphabet for a long time, it is still unconfirmed who the alphabets originally belonged to and who introduced it. John M. Clifton in his ‚Äò‚ÄôDialects, Orthography and Society ‚Äò‚Äôopined that ‚Äòthe Tanchangya community decided to base their alphabet on the Chakma to show they were related to the Chakma. However, they systematically changed the alphabet to show that they were different from the Chakma they were not simply a part of the larger Chakma community.‚Äô Work Papers of the Summer Institute of Linguistics, (1988). Moreover, in order not to cause misunderstanding between two communities, Tanchangya has introduced these alphabets which are yet to develop into Unicode font. For the time being, it is just created as True Font. Writing system It is written from left to right, similarly to Brahmi scripts, unlike the Kharosti, which were used to write from right to left. 200px Vowels There are five independent vowels such as A (a:), I(i), v( ä), E(e), and O a(o ä). The other five vowels are dependent namely, Aa(…î) , AA( å), Ii(i:), and Uu(u:). 200px Consonants There are thirty-one consonants letter found in Tanchangya alphabets. They are classified into group consonants and miscellaneous consonants. Arrangement The alphabets seem to be derived from ancient Brahmic scripts, which inherited the vowel sound within the consonants. If not an independent derivation, it should have derived from Burmese or Mon due to their dwelling with Mon and Burmese from 9th Century B.C (in Tagong the ancient civilisation of Burma to until the 15th century Common Era (during the 15th Century, they were attacked by the Rakhine king and brought them to Arakan in 15th Century from Micchagiri, present Thaye in Magwe Division to Arakan) (Dhanyawady Aye Daw Bung, 4).

During a racing career which lasted from November 2010 until September 2014 he won eleven of his twenty-eight races and competed in seven countries, namely Britain, Germany, Ireland, France, Australia, the US and the UAE: he would have raced in an eighth, Canada, but bolted before the start of the Canadian International Stakes. He attracted media attention both because of his racing achievements and because he was bred and owned by the England footballer Michael Owen. After winning his only race as a two-year-old he won two minor races in the spring of 2011 before recording his first notable success in the King George V Stakes at Royal Ascot and went on to finish second in the St Leger. In 2012 he won the Pontefract Castle Stakes and finished a close third in the Irish St. Leger. As a five-year-old he won a second Pontefract Castle Stakes and recorded his biggest win up to that time when winning the Goodwood Cup. In the following season he had his most successful campaign, winning the Ormonde Stakes, Henry II Stakes and Irish St. Leger. He recorded his final victory in the Dubai Gold Cup in March 2015. He was fatally injured in the Irish St. Leger on 13 September 2015. Background Brown Panther was a bay horse with a small white star bred by Owen Promotions Ltd, a company owned by Michael Owen. Owen has said that his interest in horse racing came from his father, who placed a small combination bet every Saturday and allowed the 11-year-old Owen to choose one of the three horses involved. He was sired by Shirocco who won four Group One races including the Breeders' Cup Turf and was voted German Horse of the Year. Apart from Brown Panther, Shirocco's most successful offspring has been the hurdler Annie Power. Brown Panther's dam Treble Heights was a successful racemare for Owen, winning the Listed Aphrodite Stakes and finished second in the Group Two Prix de Pomone in 2003. She was descended from Marie d'Ecosse, whose half- sister Glen Line was the dam of Our Babu and the Eclipse Stakes winner King of the Tudors. Throughout his racing career, Brown Panther was owned by Michael Owen in partnership with Andrew Black (the co-founder of Betfair) and was trained at Malpas, Cheshire by Tom Dascombe. Racing career=2010: two- year-old season Brown Panther made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over seven furlongs on the synthetic fibresand surface at Southwell Racecourse on 11 November 2010. Ridden as in most of his races by Richard Kingscote, he started at odds of 9/2 and took the lead in the last 50 yards to win by a length from Flying Power and eight others. 2011: three-year-old season Michael Owen, who bred and owned Brown Panther In the early part of 2011, Brown Panther competed in handicap races, beginning with a fourth place at Kempton Park Racecourse in April. He was then moved up in distance to one and a half miles and won minor races at Chester and Haydock Park in May. In June he was sent to Royal Ascot and was made 4/1 joint favourite in an eighteen- runner field for the King George V Stakes. Carrying 125 pounds he raced behind the leaders before Kingscote sent him into the lead approaching the final turn. In the straight Brown Panther drew away from his opponents and won by six lengths despite being eased down by Kingscote in the final strides. After the race a visibly emotional Owen said \\"The problem with racing is you've got no control whatsoever. I don't get nervous playing football because I can do something about it. Racing, you're just in the lap of the Gods... I was screaming, steady on Richard, I was worried that we'd got there too soon\\". Brown Panther was moved up in class to contest Group races in the second half of the year. In July he was sent to Germany and started favourite for the Deutsches Derby at Hamburg but after leading for most of the way he was overtaken in the last 400 metres and finished fifth behind Waldpark. In the following month he ran in the weight-for-age Geoffrey Freer Stakes at Newbury Racecourse and finished second to Census, a colt he had beaten easily at Ascot. Kieren Fallon took over from Kingcote when the colt was one of nine three-year-olds to contest the classic St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 10 September. Commenting on the decision to replace Kingcote, Dascombe said \\"it was a tough decision, but on this occasion we've decided to go for a more experienced jockey... you don't get too many chances to win a Classic\\". After racing towards the rear of the field Brown Panther made steady progress in the straight and finished second to Masked Marvel with Sea Moon, Blue Bunting and Census among the other beaten horses. 2012: four-year-old season Brown Panther made no impact on his four-year-old debut as he finished a distant last of four behind Memphis Tennessee in the Ormonde Stakes at Chester in May. He was then dropped in class for the Listed Pontefract Castle Stakes at Pontefract Racecourse and recorded his only victory of the season as he won easily by seven lengths from three opponents. After the colt finished seventh in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in July, Kingscote regained the ride from Fallon, and partnered the horse in all of his subsequent races. He finished second in the Geoffrey Freer Stakes again (beaten by Mount Athos) and then travelled to Ireland for the Irish St. Leger at the Curragh Racecourse in September. He produced what was probably his best effort of the season as he finished third in a \\"blanket finish\\", beaten a head and a short head by Royal Diamond and Massiyn. Brown Panther ended his third season by finishing unplaced in the Prix Royal Oak on heavy ground at Longchamp Racecourse in October. 2013: five-year-old season Brown Panther in September 2014. Brown Panther did not begin his fourth season until the 23 June when he won the Pontefract Castle stakes for the second year in succession, beating Souviens Toi by three and a half lengths with Main Sequence in fourth place. On his next appearance he was moved up in class and distance for the Goodwood Cup over two miles on 1 August and was made 13/2 third favourite behind Mount Athos and the John Gosden- trained Caucus. The other runners included Colour Vision (winner of the 2012 Ascot Gold Cup), Altano (later to win the Prix du Cadran), Saddler's Rock (winner of the race in 2012) and Cavalryman (Grand Prix de Paris, Dubai Gold Cup). Brown Panther tracked the leaders before forcing his way through the pack to take the lead two furlongs out. He quickly accelerated clear of his rivals and won by three and a half length from Ahzeemah with Altano taking third. Owen commented \\"There is a lot of heritage in this race and it's a fabulous race to win. He's full of stamina\\" before suggesting the Melbourne Cup as a future target. Dascombe said \\"We probably haven't done as well as we should have done with him by now. I think the horse is helping us because he's maturing. We've taken our time and tried to pick races this year. We've tried to get him spot-on for each day and it seems to be working a bit better than it was. This was the plan, this was the target. Hopefully we'll move on if he's all right after this\\". Brown Panther was brought back in class and distance for the Listed Foundation Stakes over ten furlongs at Goodwood in September, and led for most of the way before being outpaced in the closing stages and finishing fifth behind the favourite Grandeur. On his final appearance of the year he was sent to Australia for the Melbourne Cup in which he carried 121 pounds and started at odds of 19/1 in a field of 24 runners. He raced prominently until the straight but faded in the closing stages and finished eighth behind Fiorente. He sustained a \\"nasty gash\\" to his leg in the race and missed projected runs in the Japan Cup and the Hong Kong Vase. 2014: six-year-old season Tom Dascombe, who trained Brown Panther Brown Panther's first appearance as a six-year-old came in the Ormonde Stakes on 9 May in which he faced three opponents headed by Hillstar, the winner of the 2013 King Edward VII Stakes. He started slowly but took the lead three furlongs out and stayed on well to win by two and a quarter lengths from Hillstar. Kingscote commented \\"We went a nice even gallop and he's growing up, it makes my life a lot easier\\". Three weeks later the horse started 2/1 favourite for the Henry II Stakes over two miles at Sandown Park Racecourse, with his opponents including Tiger Cliff (Ebor Handicap), Girolamo (Preis von Europa), Seismos (Grosser Preis von Baden), Menorah (Supreme Novices' Hurdle) and Camborne (Arc Trial). Brown Panther raced in second place before taking the lead approaching the final furlong and drew way to win \\"decisively\\" by three and a half lengths from High Jinx. He then started second favourite for the Ascot Gold Cup on 19 June and finished fourth behind Leading Light but was promoted to third after the disqualification of the runner-up Estimate. In July he finished second when favourite for the Prix Maurice de Nieuil at Longchamp and then finished third to Cavalryman and Ahzeemah when attempting to repeat his 2013 success in the Goodwood Cup. On 14 September, Brown Panther made his second attempt to win the Irish St. Leger and started a 14/1 outsider in an eleven-runner field. Leading Light was made the odds-on favourite whilst the other contenders included Royal Diamond, Encke, Pale Mimosa (Lonsdale Cup) Willing Foe (Aston Park Stakes) and Pallasator. Racing on good to firm ground Brown Panther settled in second place behind Leading Light's pacemaker Eye of the Storm as the pair drew many lengths clear of the field. He took the lead two furlongs out and quickly went clear, winning easily by six and a half lengths from Leading Light, with Encke a head away in third. There was some criticism of the other jockeys in the race, who were seen as having allowed Brown Panther to get too far ahead before the race began in earnest. Dascombe said\\" It's just worked out today. We have been having a real lean time. We didn't manage to have a winner last week and I was close to pulling him out, but there aren't too many Irish St. Legers so you have to run. The horse never lets us down\\". In late autumn Brown Panther was sent to North America for what was intended to be a two race campaign, starting with the Canadian International Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack on 14 October. He was withdrawn from the race however, after becoming agitated in the preliminaries, throwing off Kingscote and then bolting when the jockey remounted. In his absence, the race was won by Hillstar. Kingscote commented \\"the horse got wound up and unfortunately he got me off. When I got back on, I tried to keep him relaxed and as soon as I let go he bolted. There wasn't much I could do after that. He's never done that before. He sometimes dances about and gets on his toes, but he's never been that extreme\\". On his last appearance of 2014 he was brought back in distance for the Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa Anita Park on 1 November but was outpaced in the closing stages and finished eleventh of the twelve runners behind Main Sequence. 2015: seven-year-old season On his debut as a seven-year-old, Brown Panther was sent to the United Arab Emirates for the Dubai Gold Cup over two miles at Meydan Racecourse on 28 March. Kingscote took the ride despite not having fully recovered from a very serious injury sustained in a fall in November which left him with a fractured left elbow, forearm and wrist and right collar-bone. He started the 4/1 favourite with his fourteen rivals including horses from Britain, the UAE, South Africa, Qatar and France. After racing in second place he took the lead three furlongs from the finish and won \\"comfortably\\" by three and a quarter lengths from the South African gelding Star Empire. The winning time of 3:18.84 was a record for the race. After the race, Kingscote commented on his injury, saying \\"It sometimes aches, especially after he took a grip with me on Thursday morning, but it's never painful and I‚Äôll go back and have the plates out at the end of the season. It helps to have a goal of a horse like this\\". On his return to Europe he started favourite for the Yorkshire Cup in May but was beaten half a length by Snow Sky, to whom he was conceding five pounds. The winner went on to win the Hardwicke Stakes by almost four lengths. He was expected to run in the Ascot Gold Cup in June but was withdrawn after sustaining an injury to his left foreleg. =Final race and death= After an absence of almost four months, Brown Panther returned on 13 September to run for the third time in the Irish St. Leger at the Curragh. He started the 13/2 joint fourth-choice in the betting behind Order of St George (Irish St. Leger Trial Stakes), Forgotten Rules (British Champions Long Distance Cup) and Agent Murphy (Geoffrey Freer Stakes). Brown Panther disputed the early lead before settling in second place but began to struggle at half-way and was pulled up by Kingscote six furlongs from the finish. A veterinary examination revealed a double fracture of the right hind leg and the horse was immediately euthanised. Owen described the day as the saddest of his life and commented on his blog \\"The toughest, most honest, most brilliant horse I will ever set eyes on passed away today doing the thing he loved most. I was with him when he was born, shared an experience for seven years that will never be repeated and gave him his last kiss goodbye. What an honour to own and breed him. I love you Panther. Life will not be the same without you\\". Writing on Facebook Dascombe described the public response to the horse's death as \\"overwhelming\\", adding \\"it is touching to know that complete strangers and many people within our industry share in our despair. It is apparent that many people saw Brown Panther as their horse not just ours... He died at the scene of his greatest triumph, doing what he loved best. No matter how heart-breaking this is for us, Brown Panther was happy and cared for by everyone right up until the moment he was put down\\".

The , renamed Group Fortifications of Aisne by the French in 1919, is a fort of the second fortified belt of forts from Metz, in Moselle. This group fortification, built in the municipalities of Pournoy-la-Grasse and of Verny, controlled the valley of the Seille. It had its baptism of fire in late 1944, when the Battle of Metz occurred.  Historical context  During The Annexation, Metz oscillated between a German garrison of 15,000 and 20,000 men at the beginning of the periodRen√© Bour, Histoire de Metz, 1950, p.227 and exceeded 25,000 men just before the First World War,L‚ÄôExpress, no2937, du 18 au 24 octobre 2007, dossier ¬´ Metz en 1900 ¬ª, Philippe Martin gradually becoming the first stronghold of the German Reich.Fran√ßois Roth: Metz annex√©e √† l‚ÄôEmpire allemand, in Fran√ßois-Yves Le Moigne, Histoire de Metz, Privat, Toulouse, 1986, (p.350). The ' completed the Second fortified belt of Metz composed of Festen Wagner, Crown Prince (1899 - 1905), Leipzig (1907-1912), empress (1899-1905), Lorraine (1899-1905), Freiherr von der Goltz (1907-1916), Haeseler (1899-1905), Prince Regent Luitpold (1907-1914) and Infantry-Werk Belle-Croix (1908-1914). The fortress of Metz was part of a wider program of fortifications called the \\"Moselstellung\\" and encompassed fortresses scattered throughout the Moselle valley between Thionville and Metz. To this end, the two cities were specially served by the Kanonenbahn Berlin - Metz, a strategic railway line. The aim of Germany was to protect against a French attack trying to take Alsace-Lorraine from the German Empire. From 1899, the Schlieffen plan of the German General Staff designed the fortifications of the Moselstellung as like a lock for blocking any advance of French troops in case of conflict.Donnell Clayton, The German Fortress of Metz: 1870-1944, Oxford, Osprey, 2008. p. 24. This concept of a fortified line on the Moselle was a significant innovation compared to the Syst√®me S√©r√© de Rivi√®res developed by the French. It later inspired the engineers of the Maginot Line.Donnell Clayton, The German Fortress of Metz: 1870-1944, Oxford, Osprey, 2008, pp. 10-13.  Construction and facilities  The Group Fortifications of Aisne had to protect the Seille valley, not far from Verny. This mission was to be facilitated by a defensive flood, thus locking the entire southern front of Metz. Built between 1904 and 1910 the fortified structure was renamed ', in tribute to Julius Wagner, the German general responsible for the A.K.O. belonging to the forts of Metz. The fort is part of the second-generation works. It was able to benefit from the latest innovations, both in the field of armaments, and also of living conditions. It offered great comfort for the time -- central heating, toilets, a bread oven, an electric plant, a telephone and running water. Its firepower was matched only by its rugged durability, thanks to its new and massive use of concrete and steel. A network of tunnels provided connections between the various points of the fortified group, covering an area of over 40 ha.Donnell Clayton, The German Fortress of Metz: 1870-1944, Oxford, Osprey, 2008, p. 24. The artillery fort could take up to two tons of shells per minute, thanks to its artillery pieces of 5.3 cm, 10 cm or 15 cm wide. The four fortified barracks could accommodate four Infanteriekompanien, two MG-Kompanien, two Artilleriebatterien, three Pioneer- sections for a total of 1,250 men. The fort had 15 observation cupolas and 51 lookout posts, and no less than 1,950m of tunnels connecting the various stations of the fort. The Group Fortifications had 2,200 m3 of water. Finally, seven diesel engines, each 30cv, provided the energy needed for its operation.  Successive assignments  From 1890 the garrison relief was guaranteed by the Corps XVI, stationed at Metz and Thionville. During World War I, the fort only took a support role for the front, and did not see any combat. Its artillery was effective. Its rear base position enabled it to be decorated with superb frescoes, still visible today. In 1919, like all the forts of Metz, it surrendered to the French army. Its comfort and its technological prowess impressed the French General Staff, who drew valuable lessons from it for the construction of the future Maginot Line. Between the wars, the fort served as t was before being plundered in the 1970s. Since 1982, the Association pour la d√©couverte de la fortification messine (ADFM) has managed the site.Fort de Verny sur fort-de-verny.org. Fort Verny is currently the only fort of the fortified belt to be open to the public.Un circuit touristique √† l‚Äôassaut de sept forts sur republicain-lorrain.fr (article publi√© le 23/01/2014).  Second World War  During the Second World War, the Group fortifications of Aisne was used by Nazi Germany. Its underground galleries provided an ideal refuge in case of air attack. From June 1942, a thousand skilled workers took shifts turns in the fort, which quickly became a true underground factory. These Eastern workers, Eastern country workers, machined and mounted aerial and marine torpedoes. These torpedoes are then routed to a depot of the German Navy, located in the woods of Cattenom.Ren√© Caboz, La bataille de Metz, √âditions Pierron, Sarreguemines, 1984 (p. 151, note 14). When the Battle of Metz happens, the former stronghold is declared fortress Reich by Hitler, and must be defended to the last by German troops.Ren√© Caboz, La bataille de Metz, √âditions Pierron, Sarreguemines, 1984, p. 132. The defense is thus organized around the Group Fortifications of Aisne and the other forts of Metz. But the US offensive, launched September 7, 1944 on the west line is cut short. American troops will eventually stop on the Moselle, despite taking two bridgeheads south of Metz. The forts were better defended than they had thought, so US troops are now figuratively out of breath. General McLain, in agreement with the General Walker, decided to suspend the attacks, pending new plans of the General Staff of the 90th Infantry Division.Hugh M. Cole: The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950 (p 176-183) When hostilities resumed in October after a month of rain, the soldiers of the 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division still firmly hold their positions even if the supplies are more difficult, because of the artillery and the frequent bombings.Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 256. On November 9, 1944, the Air Force sends no less than 1,299 heavy bombers, B-17s and B-24s, and drops 3,753 tons of bombs, and 1,000 to 2,000 books on the fortifications and strategic points in the combat zone of IIIrd army.G√©n√©ral Jean Colin, Contribution √† l‚Äôhistoire de la lib√©ration de la ville de Metz ; Les combats du fort Driant (septembre-d√©cembre 1944), Acad√©mie nationale de Metz, 1963, p. 13. Most bombers, having dropped bombs without visibility at over 20,000 feet, miss their military objectives. In Metz, the 689 loads of bombs destined to strike the fort Joan of Arc and six other forts, identified as priority targets, merely cause collateral damage, proving once again the inadequacy of the massive bombing of military targets.Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 424. The fort Jeanne-d‚ÄôArc was the last of the forts of Metz to disarm. Determined German resistance, bad weather and floods, inopportunity, and a general tendency to underestimate the firepower of the fortifications of Metz, have helped slow the US offensive, giving the opportunity to the German Army to withdraw in good order to the Saar.Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 448. The objective of the German staff, which was to stall the US troops at Metz for the longest possible time before they could reach the front of the Siegfried Line, is largely achieved.

He made several notable Broadway and Off Broadway theatrical performances, but was best known for the numerous roles he performed on the daytime Gothic horror soap opera Dark Shadows, most notably that of the warlock Nicholas Blair. Early life and career Astredo was born on April 4, 1929, in Pasadena, California to Humbert Allen and Bess Houston ( Alley) Astredo. His early childhood was spent in Pasadena, before the family moved to San Francisco. His mother taught him to play the piano, and he often performed at parties hosted by friends. His father took him sailboating, hunting, and fishing, and inculcated in him a passion for the arts. From an early age, his nickname was \\"Bud\\". After graduating from high school, Astredo studied law at the University of San Francisco, but dropped out after discovering he hated public speaking. He then sold home-care products for the Fuller Brush Company door-to-door. A woman he'd contacted during a sales pitch suggested he go into acting. She arranged for him to meet a talent agent, who took him on a tour of the 20th Century Fox studio. The tour convinced Astredo that acting was something he wanted to do, and in 1950 he enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse. Astredo was drafted into the United States Army during the Korean War, and served in the Special Services of the Eighth United States Army, an entertainment unit. Astredo became well known in the Army for his acting, song, and dance skills, particularly for his comedy routines. He left the military after the war ended, and returned to Los Angeles to take up acting. In 1957, he helped co-found the Hollywood Center Theatre there. He later managed the Los Angeles Repertory Theater Company from 1962 to 1963. Broadway and Dark Shadows Astredo made his Broadway debut in the role of Cassio in Othello at the Off-Broadway Martinique Theater in 1964, in which James Earl Jones played the title role. He then studied at the Actors Studio under Lee Strasberg. His big break came in June 1967, when he played Sergius in Joseph Papp's Shakespeare in the Park production of Arms and the Man. Later that same year, he appeared Off-Broadway with Gene Hackman in Murray Schisgal's comedy Fragments at the Cherry Lane Theater. Astredo auditioned for the highly popular Gothic soap opera Dark Shadows in either December 1967 or January 1968. The producers didn't hire him for the role he tried out for, but were so impressed with him that they decided to write a bigger part for him to play. On June 25, 1968, Astredo made his first appearance on Dark Shadows, performing the role of the warlock Nicholas Blair. He appeared in 99 episodes, also appearing as the character Charles Dawson (who lived, in the show's timeline, in the 1840s) and as the character Evan Hanley (who lived, in the show's timeline, in the 1890s). His last appearance on the series was on January 25, 1971. During his time on Dark Shadows, Astredo was known for his backstage wit, and he became close friends with his co-star, Lara Parker. Astredo played the role of \\"Dr. Forbes\\" in the 1970 Dark Shadows feature film, House of Dark Shadows. While continuing to appear on Dark Shadows, Astredo also performed the role of the Belgian doctor in Lorraine Hansberry's Les Blancs, produced on Broadway at the Longacre Theatre, and starring James Earl Jones, Lili Darvas, and Earle Hyman. It was a triumphant performance for him. Theater critic Walter Kerr called Astredo's performance \\"impressively dimensional, rich in overtone\\". Critic Clayton Riley praised his performance as \\"the finest work among the secondary players\\", and \\"splendidly conceived and executed\\". At the end of the year, Kerr named Astredo as the \\"Most Promising Newcomer on Broadway\\". After Dark Shadows After leaving Dark Shadows (the series left the air on April 2, 1971), Astredo appeared in Gore Vidal's An Evening with Richard Nixon on Broadway in May 1972 at the Shubert Theater as the Vidal-like character, for which critic Clive Barnes had positive remarks. Throughout the 1970s, Astredo appeared in a number of television commercials and stage productions throughout the country, as well as short runs in various roles in the daytime soap operas Another World, The Edge of Night, The Guiding Light, Love of Life, and Loving. He made his West End debut in London in 1982 at the Victoria Palace Theatre in The Little Foxes, playing \\"William Marshall\\" and appearing with Elizabeth Taylor. He had played the role with Taylor on Broadway in 1981. In 1985, Astredo performed the role of Dr. Abraham Van Helsing in the national touring company production of Dracula, opposite Martin Landau in the title role. Retirement and death Astredo continued acting in plays on Broadway, Off Broadway, and in regional productions until his retirement in 1990. After leaving acting, he indulged his passion for boating by sailing up and down the East Coast of the United States for several years before retiring in 2000 to a home in Guilford, Connecticut. Humbert Allen Astredo, Jr. died in Guilford on February 19, 2016, at the age of 86. Personal life Astredo married some time between 1953 and 1960. He and his wife divorced about 1964.

The surficial geology in its vicinity consists of Wisconsinan Till, alluvium, bedrock, and fill. A number of bridges have been constructed over Kennedy Creek. The watershed of the creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. The creek flows through Lackawanna State Park in its lower reaches. It is crossed by two trails in the park and is utilized for canoeing. Course Kennedy Creek begins in a small wetland in Scott Township. It flows north for a few tenths of a mile alongside Pennsylvania Route 347 before crossing Pennsylvania Route 632 and turning north-northwest. After a few tenths of a mile, it receives an unnamed tributary from the left and turns north-northeast, flowing close to Newton Hill and Weatherby Hill. After several tenths of a mile, the creek turns north-northwest and then west, crossing Interstate 81. The creek then turns north for a short distance before turning northwest, crossing Pennsylvania Route 524 and entering North Abington Township. Here, it turns southwest, crossing Pennsylvania Route 524 again, before turning northwest for a few tenths of a mile and receiving one unnamed tributary from the left and one from the right. Kennedy Creek then turns west- northwest for a few miles, flowing through a valley alongside Pennsylvania Route 524. In this reach, the creek passes by Sarnoski Hill and receives two unnamed tributaries from the right. It then turns west for several tenths of a mile, passing by Turkey Hill and receiving another unnamed tributary from the right. The creek then turns northwest for a few tenths of a mile, crossing Pennsylvania Route 524 and heading away from it. It then turns west and enters Lackawanna Lake, where it reaches its confluence with South Branch Tunkhannock Creek. Kennedy Creek joins South Branch Tunkhannock Creek upstream of its mouth. Hydrology Kennedy Creek is not designated as an impaired waterbody. In June 2006, trace concentrations of trichloroethylene were found in Kennedy Creek at the Interstate 81 overpass. However, in September 2006, the creek was found not to contain trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, or DCE. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Kennedy Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. The mouth of Kennedy Creek is located at the Kennedy Creek Inlet. An \\"exceptionally scenic\\" ravine with hemlock trees occurs at this inlet. The surficial geology along much of Kennedy Creek consists of alluvium. However, the surficial geology in the creek's valley as a whole consists mostly of a till known as Wisconsinan Till. There is also a patch of bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale at the creek's mouth and a patch of fill where the creek crosses Interstate 81. Watershed The watershed of Kennedy Creek has an area of . The creek is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Dalton. The mouth of the creek is located at Carpenter Town. The designated use for Kennedy Creek is aquatic life. The creek is one of several major streams to drain Scott Township. History Kennedy Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1178368. A steel stringer/multi- beam or girder bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 347 over Kennedy Creek was built in 1938 and repaired in 1955. It is long and is located in Scott Township. Two bridges of the same type, but carrying Pennsylvania Route 524, were built over the creek in 1939 in North Abington Township and are long. The first of these two bridges was repaired in 1955. A concrete slab bridge carrying State Route 4007/Craig Road across the creek was built in 1962 in North Abington Township and is long.

Zamora Linmark and published in 1997. Rolling the R's, set in the 1970s in Hawaii, follows several adolescent Filipino characters as they grapple with the difficulties of fitting in as immigrants, discovering their sexualities, and deal with the social structure of in their community. The novel is written from a variety of perspectives, switching between main characters' perspectives in order to develop individual narratives. Linmark draws partially on his own experience as a Filipino-American immigrant to guide the plot. Linmark frequently references pop culture (Charlie's Angels, Donna Summer, and countless other unmistakable cultural relics of the 1970s), demonstrating his characters' awareness of mainstream American culture. Narrated in Pidgin English, Linmark develops his characters across various settings including the home, school, and the streets of Hawaii. The story is told in non-linear progression, presenting the young, queer characters across settings to show how they all stray from typical depictions of pre-teen protagonists. Throughout the novel, Linmark shows how racism and ethnic prejudice, conflicts over language, social norms regarding sexuality outside of marriage, and prejudice against gay men and boys govern the lives of his young protagonists. The novel was well received, prompting a 20th anniversary reprinting in 2015. Linmark also adapted his novel into a play by the same name set to be performed in Honolulu, Hawaii in late 2018.  Author background  R. Zamora Linmark is a Filipino-American novelist, poet, and playwright who was born in 1968 in Manila, Philippines. Linmark moved to Hawaii in 1978 at the age of 10 and became an immigrant student in the Hawaiian school system. He often addresses Filipino/a stereotypes in his writing, drawing from his own experience. His other works include multiple collections of poetry and his 2011 novel Leche, which also tells the story of Filipino immigrants. He has received fellowships from the Japan-United States Friendship Commission, the National Endowment for the Arts and the Fulbright Foundation.  Synopsis  R. Zamora Linmark presents the story of Rolling the R‚Äôs in a series of vignettes, offering readers glimpses into the lives of young people exploring their sexuality, education, assimilation into mainstream American society, and other aspects of their identity. The protagonists of the story are a group of fifth grade students living in Kalihi, Hawaii during the 1970s. There is no clear plot line, but there are specific character developments throughout the story. Edgar becomes more confident about his sexuality and gains more control over the ways he uses his body. With Edgar's help, Vicente also begins to accept his queer sexuality. The recent immigrants (Florante, Mai Lin, Vicente) become more comfortable with their language usage, consequentially also becoming more confident in their ethnic identities and racial histories. Examples of racial and ethnic prejudice between groups, and the stress caused by their teachers' demands that they speak standard English in the classroom rather than pidgin, become more pervasive throughout the novel. These experiences cause the characters to gain self-confidence and strengthen their friendships in order to maintain their sense of well-being in Kalihi.  Characters  Edgar Ramirez: A young gay Filipino student in the Kalihi school system who often speaks in Pidgin English. His sexuality is often the target of ridicule, exhibited by the opening vignette \\"Blame It On Chachi\\" in which the homophobic epithet \\"faggot\\" is hurled at Edgar from an unspecified narrator. Edgar's flamboyant demeanor and love for pop culture helps guide the plot of the vignettes. His story most evidently reflects the rupture of childhood innocence as he explicitly describes his sexy escapades with Mr. Campos, the school janitor. Florante Sanchez: A recent immigrant from the Philippines who attends school with Edgar, Katrina, Vicente and the other children. He comes from a family of writers and has a talent with the English language which sets him apart from the majority of his friends who communicate in creole languages, Tagalog, or Ilocano. Florante is praised by his teachers for his intelligence, but despite their discouragement, he remains a part of Edgar, Katrina, and Vicente's friend group. Katherine \\"Katrina-Trina\\" Cruz: A Filipino-American student who attends school in Kalihi and is one of Edgar's best friends. Trina is sexually active, yet again breaking the expectations of childhood innocence. She and her mother are often the subjects of gossip around town as they are known to be promiscuous. They also receive criticism for their non-traditional family structure‚ÄîTrina's parents were not married when she was born, and her mother is apparently a single parent‚Äîbut Katrina seems unbothered by the criticisms she receives, demonstrating her perseverance. Vicente De Los Reyes: a recent Filipino immigrant growing into his queer identity. Vicente is an artistic, kind, and thoughtful young boy, by far the most quiet of the friends in the main character group. He is respectful and understanding, demonstrating his family's commitment to respectability. Ms. Takara: teacher of immigrant students in the Kalihi school district. Ms. Takara is a Japanese-American who teaches corrective pronunciation to the recent immigrants in order to help the students learn how to speak standard English. The immigrant students are removed from class regularly and taken to a small room on the opposite side of the school for lessons in how to speak standard English. Mrs. Takemoto: another Japanese-American teacher in the Kalihi area. Trina's mom sleeps with her husband, and Mrs. Takemoto is apparently aware of this, which creates an antagonistic relationship between Trina and Mrs. Takemoto in the classroom. Da Manong Gang: a group of first and second generation Asian immigrants who have formed a violent and somewhat mythical gang within the school. This group symbolizes the physical embodiment of all of the negative stereotypes about Filipino immigrants. Their violence and vagrancy terrifies the teachers and students.  Historical context  The Philippines have a long colonial history, dating back to 1521 when they were colonized by Spain. The Spanish remained in the Philippines until the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898. In fact, the title Rolling the R's refers to the tendency of Filipino immigrants to roll their r's while speaking in English, a linguistic hold-over from Ilocano, a Filipino language which is rooted in Spanish influence. Spanish rule ended in 1898 but the Philippines experienced 48 more years of outside domination by the United States and Japan before they gained independence in 1946. Though this colonization and subjugation lies in the past, it continues to affect relations between countries and between peoples in the modern day. Colonial history has produced a ‚Äú‚Äòcolonial mentality‚Äô, an aspiration to be like the colonizer or remain in a dependant, colonized state in order to inhibit development. Though Rolling the R's does not take place in the Philippines, the colonial history of the Philippines has traveled to the US with Filipino immigrants for over a century. Filipino men were originally imported to Hawaii in the early 1900s to work on Hawaii's plantations following annexation of the Philippines by the US. Almost all were illiterate because the plantation owners assumed the illiterate farm workers from rural areas would not organize or challenge their working conditions. As the years went on, Filipinos retained this subjugated identity as manual laborers with Japanese-Americans, Chinese-Americans, Portuguese-Americans and Caucasian-Americans in positions of dominance over them (even through the 1980s). From 1893 to 1954, Hawaii was ruled by a white oligarchy that was almost completely separate socially and politically from the rest of the population, and native-Hawaiians and Asian immigrants were expected to accept white rule. Between 1911 and 1944, 80% of people hanged for murder in Hawaii were Filipino though they only made up 1/6 of the population, representing a wave of immense violence against Filipino- Americans. Japanese-Americans gained political power in 1954 and created a somewhat more democratic system of governance in Hawaii, but they also joined the existing Caucasian ruling class at the top of the power structure. Through 1980, this pattern of hierarchy remained, resulting in a preponderance of Filipino-Americans in Hawaii who had lower paying jobs, less education, and a lack of political power despite constituting a significant portion of the Hawaiian population. Since Rolling the R's takes place in the 1970s, these historical inequalities are essential to understanding the mindset of the characters and the motivation behind their actions.  Themes = Education  The education system has played a role in determining the economic and social status of Filipino-Americans since they first arrived in Hawaii in the beginning of the 20th century. The first Filipino-American immigrants were illiterate adult men who were not expected to go to school and who did not need to speak English in order to work on the plantations. In the 1920s, authorities created a system of 'tracking' with 3 levels which were created to afford special attention to Caucasian children and any others who were fluent in English. Filipinos disproportionately filled in the lower levels of this tracking system and as grades ascend, the performance levels of Filipinos actually declined. Until the mid 1970s, students who did not speak English had no right or access to bilingual or native language instruction at school, propelling them into the lower strata of the education system. As of 1984, one quarter of Hawaiian schools remained racially segregated according to federal standards although this was due to geography rather than educational policies. The educational environment, especially that which surrounds linguistic education, in Rolling the R's reflects these historically ingrained educational hierarchies. In Rolling the R's, Mrs. Takemoto's immense surprise upon discovering Florante's English language talent reflects the low expectations n Filipino-American students. Additionally, the linguistic discrimination present in the educational environment mirrors the racial hierarchy established in greater Hawaii. Though Filipino dialects hold power within the immigrant community, they often represent weakness in interactions outside of Filipino communities. The teachers and administrators at the protagonists‚Äô schools recognize a distinct and immovable hierarchy of languages which places ‚Äòproper‚Äô English at the top, pidgin English below it, and non-English languages at the bottom. She and Ms. Takara repeatedly discourage the use of pidgin English in favor of the mainstream \\"standard English\\" spoken in the larger community; this discourages some Filipino- American students' effective learning and social growth. This lack of encouragement or pride in Filipino languages, culture, or history promotes educational complacency and disinterest among Filipino-American students, which can lead to poor performance and lack of engagement.  Gender and sexuality  The issues of gender and sexuality permeate the book. From Edgar's label as \\"faggot\\" to Katrina's descriptions of sex with her boyfriend, R. Zamora Linmark urges readers to recognize the depths of children's experiences with these subjects, whether they want to accept it or not. Homophobia and transphobia among Asian and Asian-American populations is actually a vestige of late 19th and early 20th century European colonialism in Asia, which brought the conservative Western opinions of sexuality and gender to the continent. As a result, most LGBT Asian Americans find it difficult to come out to their Asian and Asian-American peers due to the sentiment that LGBT people are largely ignored or repressed in the broader Asian and Asian- American cultures. These same LGBT Asian-Americans, however, also often report feeling excluded from the LGBT community as a result of their racial and ethnic identities. The shame and stigma surrounding issues of sexuality in Rolling the R's draws on the shame and stigma experienced by LGBT Asian- Americans in the real world. However, Asian-Americans also report higher rates of acceptance and openness about sexuality among friends, coworkers, and employers than their Asian counterparts. For LGBT Filipino-Americans, there are specific controlling images which influence the way that they are viewed by the larger Filipino-American community. The term \\"bakla\\" is used throughout Rolling the R's to describe Edgar and other characters who perform gender outside of their assigned male role through homosexuality or gender exploration. Bakla has no specific meaning, but rather refers gays to gay men, cross-dressing men or transgender people assigned male at birth. The term tomboy serves a similar purpose for women, labeling those with non-traditional gender or sexual practices as lesbians or too masculine in manner or dress. LGBT Filipino-Americans often report feeling as if coming out, especially to family, would be unsafe, excessive, and shameful. This shame and fear is reflected in Vicente's hesitance to explore his LGBT identity or be flamboyant. His father abuses him physically when he acts outside of his assigned male role and he receives verbal reinforcement of stereotypes from the gossip on the island which follows Edgar and other openly LGBT characters. It is evident that stereotypes within the broader Asian-American community and the Filipino-American community in the novel effect the ways in which the protagonists understand gender and sexuality.  Immigration and racism  Because many of the main characters in Rolling the R's are first or second generation immigrants, R. Zamora Linmark addresses immigrant identities and issues often. For example, both Filipino men and women experience exoticization in the US as a result of their distinctive phenotypical traits. In a 2009 study of phenotypical traits and discrimination, researchers found that darker skin was associated with lower income and poorer physical health for both females and males. More ethnic features also seemed to heighten income disparity only for female participants, meaning that immigrants of any generation must navigate racial prejudice while also adjusting to life in the US. Strong ethnic phenotypical features and traditions often leads to tokenization of Filipino identities and customs, exhibited plainly in the vignette \\"They Like You Because You Eat Dog\\" which addresses the stereotypes and tokenism associated with features of Filipino culture. Ethnic identity, however, also serves as one of the strongest mediating factors to combat the effects of racial discrimination. A great deal of the racial discrimination which Filipino immigrants must face stems from the historical colonial relationship between the US and the Philippines. Following annexation, Filipinos were framed as racially and intellectually inferior in order to justify continued US involvement in the region. Filipinos were described like children: emotional, maladjusted, and unable to make decisions or contribute meaningfully to society without significant guidance Additionally, most Filipinos in Hawaii prior to WWII were young men without wives in the state and who were unemployed due to the depression, leading to a high rate of crime among Filipinos often attributed to inferior culture rather than biased demographics. In 1965, just before the setting of Rolling the R's, Congress passed the US Immigration and Nationality Act which allowed for the reunification of families, meaning that Filipino wives and children who had been left behind could finally come join their male family members in the US. Following the passage of the act, the proportion of immigrants in the broader Filipino-American skyrocketed, making Filipinos far more prone to stereotyping as a result of nativism and backlash. Consequently, the same stereotypical qualities which were applied to the prototypical plantation workers adapted to fit both Filipino men, women, and children well beyond the plantation fields, as demonstrated by the racial tension threaded through much of Rolling the R's.  Critical reception  The novel received praise for its imagination, creativity, authenticity, and commitment to storytelling from LGBT and Asian American authors and academics. The novel received a special 20th anniversary reprinting from the original publisher, Kaya Press, in 2015.

According to Santopietro, Sinatra was a \\"lifelong sympathizer with Jewish causes\\". Sinatra participated in Hollywood protests and productions supporting Jews during the Holocaust and the formation of the State of Israel. He actively fund-raised for Israel Bonds, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center, and helped establish two intercultural centers in Israel which bear his name. Due to his support of Israel, his recordings and films were banned by the Arab League and by Lebanon. Personal relationships with Jews Sinatra became friendly with Jewish individuals in his youth. His Jewish neighbor, Mrs. Golden, often babysat him while his mother was out working. She spoke to him in Yiddish and served him coffee cake and apples. For many years Sinatra wore a mezuzah charm that Mrs. Golden had given him. In 1944 Sinatra insisted on a Jewish friend, Manie Sacks, serving as godfather at his son's baptism over the vociferous protests of the priest. According to Swan, Sinatra despised racial prejudice and was quick to put a stop to it. Sinatra said: \\"When I was a kid and someone called me a 'dirty little Guinea', there was only one thing to do - break his head...Let anyone yell wop or Jew or nigger around us, we taught him not to do it again\\". Once he heard a reporter call someone a \\"Jew bastard\\" at a party and punched out the speaker. When Sinatra heard that some golf clubs restricted Jews from membership, he became the second non-Jew to join a club with a majority Jewish membership. Holocaust era Sinatra's support of religious freedom found expression in support for Jews being persecuted during the Holocaust. In 1942, when the first reports of Nazi brutality against Jews reached the United States, Sinatra ordered hundreds of medallions struck with an image of Saint Christopher on one side and the Star of David on the other, and had them delivered to U.S. soldiers stationed in Europe as well as friends, business associates, and policemen who had provided security at his concerts. In 1943 he joined the national tour of We Will Never Die, a four-month, six-city dramatic pageant staged by Ben Hecht to focus public attention on the Holocaust. In 1945 Sinatra starred in The House I Live In, a ten-minute short film about antisemitism and religious tolerance that won an Honorary Academy Award and was added to the National Film Registry in the Library of Congress in 2007. Support of Israel Ben- Gurion Like many of his contemporaries, Sinatra supported the establishment of the State of Israel. In September 1947, when the United Nations was weighing ratification of its Partition Plan for Palestine which would create a Jewish state, Sinatra performed at an Action for Palestine rally at the Hollywood Bowl that drew 20,000 supporters. Sinatra was personally involved in a clandestine operation in New York City in March 1948 on behalf of the Haganah, Israel's pre-state paramilitary organization. The Haganah had established a base in New York to smuggle arms to Palestine over a U.S. embargo. The Haganah was headquartered in the Hotel 14, located on the same premises as the Copacabana nightclub, and was under continual surveillance by Federal agents. Haganah representative Teddy Kollek saw Sinatra at the Copacabana bar and enlisted his help for an undercover operation. According to Kollek: > \\"I had an Irish ship captain sitting in the port of New York with a ship > full of munitions destined for Israel. He had phony bills of lading and was > to take the shipment outside the three-mile limit and transfer it on to > another ship. But a large sum of money had to be handed over, and I didn't > know how to get it to him. If I walked out the door carrying the cash, the > Feds would intercept me and wind up confiscating the munitions. > \\"I went downstairs to the bar and Sinatra came over, and we were talking. I > don't know what came over me, but I told him what I was doing in the United > States and what my dilemma was. And in the early hours of the following > morning I walked out the front door of the building with a satchel, and the > Feds followed me. Out the back door went Frank Sinatra, carrying a paper bag > filled with cash [estimated at $1 million]. He went down to the pier, handed > it over, and watched the ship sail\\". Sinatra told his daughter Nancy, \\"It was the beginning of a young nation. I wanted to help, I was afraid they might fall down\\". According to Lehman, Sinatra \\"believed Zionism was a righteous cause\\". Visits to Israel Sinatra in Nazareth in 1962 In 1962 Sinatra visited Israel for the first time as part of his multinational World Tour for Children. The tour, which raised over $1 million for children's charities around the globe, had stops in Japan, Hong Kong, England, France, Italy, Greece, and Israel. In Israel, Sinatra gave seven concerts in six cities. His visit coincided with the country's annual Yom Ha'atzmaut (Independence Day) celebrations. Sinatra sang at the official Independence Day event in Tel Aviv and was seated beside Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and General Moshe Dayan on the reviewing stand during the Israel Defense Forces parade. He also performed for troops at the Tel Nof Airbase and delivered a speech in Jerusalem \\"urging people all over the world to support Israel\\". A 30-minute short film, Sinatra in Israel, was later released with highlights of the visit. In 1975 Sinatra performed at the Jerusalem Convention Center; this concert was released as the album Sinatra: The Jerusalem Concert. According to George Jacobs, his valet, \\"We often returned to Israel, which Mr. S decided was his favorite country\\". In 1995 Sinatra marked his 80th birthday with various celebrations, including a trip to Israel on his private plane together with several close friends, including Lee Iacocca and Walter Matthau. An entourage of some 100 participants spent time with him in Eilat, after which they toured Jordan and Egypt. Frank Sinatra Centers During his 1962 concert tour, in Nazareth, Sinatra purchased a lot near Mary's Well for the establishment of an intercultural youth center for Arab and Israeli children, to be built by the Histadrut trade union. He donated the $50,000 profit from his Israeli concerts to the project. He returned to Israel in 1964 to attend the dedication of the Frank Sinatra Brotherhood and Friendship Center for Arab and Israeli Children. Returning to Israel in 1965 to film a cameo role in Cast a Giant Shadow, he gave his entire $50,000 salary from the film to the center. In 1967 he made another $100,000 contribution to the Center. In 1976 a Hollywood banquet honoring Sinatra, hosted by the American Friends of Hebrew University, raised $1 million toward the construction of a student center on the university's Mount Scopus campus. In 1978, the university named the Frank Sinatra International Student Center in his honor. On July 31, 2002, the center's cafeteria was the site of a terrorist bombing by Hamas. Nine were killed and nearly 100 injured. Fund-raising Sinatra planting a tree in Histadrut Forest of Jerusalem Sinatra raised significant funds for Jewish causes. In the wake of the Six-Day War in June 1967, he and other Hollywood entertainers pledged a total of $2.5 million to Israel at a cocktail party hosted by Jack L. Warner; Sinatra personally contributed $25,000. In 1972 Sinatra raised $6.5 million in bond pledges for Israel, and in 1975 announced he was personally giving $250,000 to Israel Bonds \\"in memory of my parents' neighbor, Mrs. Golden, in Hoboken\\". He raised significant money for the Hebrew University of Jerusalem as well, including a 1976 Hollywood fundraiser that netted $1 million for a new student center, a $10,000 per couple reception in Chicago in 1977, and a $5,000 per couple trip to Israel in 1978. Sinatra met Simon Wiesenthal for the first time in 1979, telling the Nazi hunter that \\"he had been his hero for many years\\". When he found out that the Simon Wiesenthal Center was trying to produce the documentary Genocide, Sinatra told them, \\"Although I'm not Jewish, the Holocaust is important to me\\", and offered $100,000 to the project. He also became a member of the Center's Board of Trustees. In ensuing months, Sinatra made four appearances on behalf of the Center, bringing in $400,000 in funding for the film, which won the 1981 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.

In a statement, the Arab League said it had conclusively determined that Sinatra \\"participates in the distribution of Israel bonds and that he exerts efforts for the collection of funds to be sent to Israel\\". With the signing of the 1979 Egypt‚ÄìIsrael Peace Treaty, this ban was voided. In 1964 Sinatra was officially barred from entering Lebanon due to his \\"moral and material support of Israel\\". In 2014 NBC News reported that a collection of Sinatra CDs were on display in the March Lebanon office in Beirut, with the note that they were banned for \\"Zionist tendencies\\". Sinatra's banned recordings are also posted on the group's website, the Virtual Museum of Censorship. Despite the ban, Sinatra albums and films still circulate in Lebanon. In 1964, at the same time the country announced it was barring Sinatra, one of his films was showing in Beirut. In 1966 Billboard reported that the ban was having its effect on Middle East sales of Sinatra's international number-one single, \\"Strangers in the Night\\", but the disc was still being delivered to Lebanon from other countries. The Virtual Museum of Censorship website acknowledges that despite the ban, Sinatra recordings are available in Lebanon.

He killed 3 people, and wounded 5. The attack took place during the 2015‚Äì2016 wave of violence in Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Attack The attack took place at around 4:35 P.M. The gunman fired an Uzi submachine gun at cars stuck in traffic, and, when his car crashed, stepped out of the vehicle to continue shooting. The attacker was immobilized by a driver, Yuval Lasri, who told reporters that, \\" I didn‚Äôt shoot at him because I wasn‚Äôt sure that he was the terrorist, but then I saw the gun next to him and understood that he was.‚Äù Context This attack shocked the nation coming, as it did, after a period of calm, free of terror attacks. Together with the stabbing at a synagogue in Tel Aviv that occurred only a few hours earlier, it was, \\"the bloodiest day in Israel since this latest round of Palestinian violence began back in September.\\" Victims * Ezra Schwartz (18), an American from Sharon, Massachusetts who was studying abroad.

The trade-to-GDP ratio is an indicator of the relative importance of international trade in the economy of a country. It is calculated by dividing the aggregate value of imports and exports over a period by the gross domestic product for the same period. Although called a ratio, it is usually expressed as a percentage. It is used as a measure of the openness of a country to international trade, and so may also be called the trade openness ratio. It may be seen as an indicator of the degree of globalisation of an economy. Other factors aside, the trade-to-GDP ratio tends to be low in countries with large economies and large populations such as Japan and the United States, and to have a higher value in small economies. Singapore has the highest trade-to-GDP ratio of any country; between 2008 and 2011 it averaged about 400%. Worldwide trade-to-GDP ratio rose from just over 20% in 1995 to about 30% in 2014.

He served as the governor of Hims from 862 until he was killed during a revolt in 864.  Career  Al-Fadl was the brother of Mazyar ibn Qarin,; who had been the ruler of Tabaristan until an unsuccessful rebellion in 839, and his own nisbah of \\"al-Tabari\\" suggests an origin from that province. In 860 al-Fadl participated in the raids against the Byzantine Empire; commanding twenty vessels, he undertook a naval expedition and attacked the fortress of Attaleia in southwest Anatolia. Two years later he was appointed by the caliph al-Musta'in as governor of Hims, following a revolt which had resulted in the flight of its previous governor Kaydar ibn 'Abdallah al-Ushrusani. Upon arriving in the district he was approached by the local residents, who explained that their actions had been prompted by Kaydar's misrule, and he was able to enter the city of Hims without opposition.; Despite the peaceful start to his governorship, al-Fadl soon learned of a fresh plot by the people of Hims to rebel against him. He therefore rounded up a group of alleged leaders of the revolt, beheading some of them and sending one hundred notables to the caliph in Samarra. He also dismantled the city walls and ordered that the street pavements be removed. These measures, however, failed to stifle the unrest, and eventually the people of Hims and a group of the Banu Kalb united under the leadership of one 'Utayf ibn Ni'mah al-Kalbi and revolted against al-Fadl. The latter barricaded himself in the palace of Khalid ibn Yazid ibn Mu'awiyah, but was betrayed by his followers and handed over to the rebels who, after robbing him of his money and wives, killed him and hung his body on the city gates. Following his death, Hims remained in a state of rebellion until it was again pacified by the general Musa ibn Bugha al-Kabir.; ; ;  Notes  References   * 864 deaths 9th-century Iranian people Governors of the Abbasid Caliphate Abbasid people of the Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars Admirals of the Abbasid Caliphate Qarinvand dynasty ","title":"Al-Fadl ibn Qarin al-Tabari"},{"id":"48598903","text":"Mudrov () is a Slavic masculine surname, its feminine counterpart is Mudrova.

RESTHeart is dual licensed under the AGPL and a business friendly commercial license. Starting from release 4.0, commercial editions were rebranded as RESTHeart Platform while the simple name RESTHeart keeps referring to the open source edition. RESTHeart Platform editions offer additional features such as support Amazon Web Service DocumentDB and Azure Cosmos DB, Multi-documented transactions, Change streams and enhanced Security features.  Motivations and architecture  RESTHeart connects to MongoDB and exposes a simple REST API to read and write data via plain HTTP requests leveraging MongoDB's document-oriented nature and creating an automatic mapping between data and HTTP resources. It implements the HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) model of interaction where the state of an application is driven by HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc. RESTHeart naturally fits an architecture where there is the need to invoke document-oriented data services on top of MongoDB via HTTP, but programmers don't want to waste time by building repetitive CRUD logic by hand. > Imagine the following scenario: you want to develop a Web application on top > of a data model, following simple CRUD operations. Data can be modeled as a > hierarchy of documents, and MongoDB is a perfect fit for the job, or you > already have some data in a MongoDB instance and you want to quickly build a > user interface for it. RESTHeart allows to deploy and run specialized, independent micro-services and it's already available via Docker containers.  Technical implementation  RESTHeart it's fully implemented in Java and embeds Undertow, the non-blocking HTTP server which is one of the core components of the Wildfly Application Server. > Undertow is a flexible performant web server written in java, providing both > blocking and non-blocking API‚Äôs based on NIO. Undertow has a composition > based architecture that allows you to build a web server by combining small > single purpose handlers. The gives you the flexibility to choose between a > full Java EE servlet 3.1 container, or a low level non-blocking handler, to > anything in between. Undertow is designed to be fully embeddable, with easy > to use fluent builder APIs. Undertow‚Äôs lifecycle is completely controlled by > the embedding application. Undertow is sponsored by JBoss and is the default > web server in the Wildfly Application Server. The multi-threaded process connects to a MongoDB server and exposes its data as operations, via a RESTful interface over the HTTP protocol, so that data clients can interact with the DataBase Management System without the need of a low level database driver. MongoDB resources such as databases, collections, documents are automatically represented with the Json variant of the Hypertext Application Language. RESTHeart inherits the same Undertow's pipeline architecture, where specialized handlers are chained together to serve the requests. In order to provide additional logic, custom plugins can be added. RESTHeart also supports MongoDB's GridFS and allows for storing and retrieving large binary files via HTTP. Sitting in between the client and the database, RESTHeart also provides gateway services, such as Authentication and Authorization, data Transformation and Validation. Starting from version 4.0, RESTHeart is split in two modules clued together in a micro-service architecture in order to minimize code complexit: restheart-core that handles the REST API and restheart-security that is responsible of enforcing the security policy acting as a reverse proxy for restheart-core.

For centuries, with Piazza della Frutta, it was the commercial center of the city. In the two squares is one of the largest markets in Italy. Unlike Piazza dei Signori, the civic theater of celebrations, Piazza delle Erbe was the site of the folk festivities. The square is dominated by the imposing Palazzo della Ragione.  History  Piazza Erbe, Padua, on 1817 The area was active in pre-Roman times. By the time of Imperial Rome, homes gave way to businesses. Its present design is from the tenth and eleventh centuries. The space was occupied by a number of shops and stalls selling all kinds of goods, from the edible to luxury goods. With the construction of the Palazzo della Ragione in the early thirteenth century that areas were assigned to specific types of goods. In the hall sellers of fabrics and furs. At the foot of the staircases around the building were the awnings for iron (Scala del Feri, to the east) and wine (Scala del Vin, to the west) and sellers of grain and leather. Under the Palazzo del Podesta were the workshops of goldsmiths. In 1302 they expanded the space with the demolition of a warehouse, which is now the fountain. The square took the shape that it now has. as you see it now, especially with the prominent location of the Palazzo del Podesta. In the eighteenth century the medieval houses on the southside were standardized with the porches. In 1874, the Palace of Debite replace the prisons on the west. In the square, under the Palazzo del Podesta was an ancient well. In August 1785 it was covered with the well structure that had been in the Piazza dei Signori, when that well was sealed. This well was sealed under a manhole ‚Äì visible on the pavement ‚Äì in 1930, when it was built the current monumental fountain. The square, paved in the Middle Ages, was paved in several occasions during the eighteenth century and dramatically in 1867. On the day of St. James, the square hosts the Palio Race \\"Ludi Carrara\\", first started by citizens in 1382 [1] to celebrate the lordship Carrara and commemorate the rise to power of James I of Carrara, which occurred June 28, 1318, the feast day of St. James. The rider who first arrived in the square ‚Äì party race from Voltabarozzo ‚Äì would win the pallium, a precious piece of silk fabric, while the second goose youth, the third an owl.  Executions  The square was the scene of executions since the Middle Ages, with Piazza Castello. It has been called 'Justice Square' and a statue of Justice with sword and scales is placed above the Tower of Elders. The stage for the executions was under the windows of the Palazzo del Podesta. Here were also lodges the Palace of Reason and the scale of Feri ‚Äì or Justice. There is a second statue of Justice here. The condemned were tended to by the confraternity of the Scuola di San Giovanni. Some historical executions: * On 13 January 1374 Alvise Forzat√® and his son Philip were beheaded on charges of treason. * In 1387 Albertino From Peraga was publicly beheaded on poggiuolo of the building towards the square of corn for having sided with Gian Galeazzo Visconti. * In 1615 Giulio from Naples, convicted of theft committed sacrilege in Anguillara, was taken on a cart from the Palazzo della Ragione to Porta Santa Croce where they cut off his right hand. Returned to the square with the severed hand around his neck, he was hanged and burned.  Description  The square has an irregular trapezoidal shape. In the morning of each business day the square hosts the fruit and vegetable market. In the afternoon, numerous bars occupy the space with chairs and tables and are occupied by Padua and tourists to the ritual of animating the square until late evening. On the west is the Palace of Debite and the entrance of the ancient contr√† Beccherie (now via Manin) running towards Piazza Duomo. To the east is the Moschini and the entrance to the Contra ≈†kocjan and the Canton del Gallo. Past the medieval houses on the south, the square leads to the ghetto streets of Fabbri (once called Ebrerie) and the ancient road of Caneve (now Via Squarcione) where there were many wine to good.

The townhouse was originally built as a family home, but has undergone adaptive reuse several times to fit the changing needs of the local population. The building was first constructed to be the primary home, and later vacation home, of the architects who designed it. During the British period, it served as the Lieutenant's House (Dar -il Kmand), serving a post for the administration of regions in Malta. It would later serve as the first police station in Naxxar and the first police headquarters of the region. The building was also used as the first primary school of Naxxar. An air raid shelter was constructed in the house during World War II and used by the local community when Malta was bombarded; the shelter hosted a maternity ward for an underground hospital. The recent renaming of the townhouse as Palazzo Nasciaro could be misleading as its layout shows it is not a palace. The renaming is probably used for romanticism.\\"Baroque Naxxar Townhouse\\", Times of Malta, 2012. The townhouse is claimed to have rococo architecture a type of baroque architecture. Location Palazzo Nasciaro was built on a strategic hill overlooking the three villages of Malta region consisting of Attard, Balzan and Lija. Today, the surroundings are developed, and the villages are now towns. The building is close to the main piazza, Victory Square, near the core of Naxxar. The street on which it stands was previously known as Strada Reale. It was renamed Main Street (Triq il-Kbira) when Lord Gerald Strickland Anglicanised many Maltese street names in the 1920s. In modern times, the street still leads directly to the main piazza, but it is no longer the main street to Valletta due to more recent building developments. It is found next to the house of the Naxxar parish priest. Naxxar is a village on a hill,MacGill, Thomas (1839), \\"A handbook, or guide, for strangers visiting Malta\\", pp.120, while at the same time the palace is elevated from the street. It is built on two floor with a large underlying shelter. It originally looked over the three villages.Exceptional 18th century Palazzo, Malta. History Baroque fa√ßade Sammut Family Palazzo Nasciaro was built during the Order of St. John and designed by architect Francesco Sammut (born. 1755), with some alterations by his son Giovanni Sammut.Zammit, Andre (2009), \\"200-year-old History in an old musty archive\\". The Malta Independent. Retrieved February 22, 2016. Francesco Sammut designed the townhouse to be his official residence and then his son Giovanni inherit it from him. Both Franceso and Giovanni are well known architects but most of their work is still archived. The townhouse is also known in history to have belonged to the Amato family. Lieutenant's House Palazzo Nasciaro was the Lieutenant's house during the British period. This position was held as a form of administrative area not just of Naxxar but of the surroundings that at the time extanded till St. Paul's Bay. The Lieutenant was known among the few residents at the time in the Italian language as 'luogotenente'. At the time there was a language problem and the rise of polictical activism for the first time in Malta. Several nobles, including Giuseppe Scicluna, were pro-Italian while at the same time Britain kept the teaching of education at the hands of the Maltese noble classes until the nineteenth century with the teaching of Italian. In Naxxar the residents were mainly noble families, pro-Italian and for this reason even referred to the Lieutenant in Italian. The palace was referred to either Casa del Luogotenente or Casa Nasciaro. Naxxar Primary School Palazzo Nasciaro was probably the first public, and free, school in Naxxar. The school was opened after education boosted with education initiatives by the British government in Malta, at the same time when several other schools in Malta have been opened. Palazzo Nasciaro addressed a social need in Naxxar; a secondary school was built a throw-stone away, in the same street, within the former gardens of the palace. School toilet rooms were built and added to the palace when it was a school and are still part of the palace today.\\"Mepa schedules a range of properties\\", Times of Malta, 2012.\\"Naxxar, four walks to discover a village\\", Din l-Art Helwa, p. 20. Elisa Scicluna was given a transfer as a headmistress from Msida to Naxxar in 1904, in order to open this public school.Catania, Paul (2010), \\"A village at the turn of the twentieth century - Naxxar\\", Melita Historica, Volume XV, no. 3:303-326, ISSN 1021-6952, p. 311. Naxxar Police Station Plaque saying \\"Palazzo Nasciaro\\" Palazzo Nasciaro is still known among the locals as the \\"old police station\\". The Local Council of Naxxar and the local residents refer to the building as the old police station as it still was a police station at the end of the twentieth century, before it was abandoned for more than twenty years. Despite this gives it recent notability within the Police Force of Malta, and the Local community in general, further notability is for the fact that it served as a police headquarters of a large region in the north of Malta during the British and the beginning of the force. The traditional Maltese tinber balcony, that stood for two centuries on the fa√ßade together with the baroque-designed balcony, had been removed when the building was a police station.\\"War time air raid shelter sign presented to FWA\\", The Malta Independent, 2015. The lower half of the balcony, made of Maltese limestone, is retained. This half has intricate stone carvings and gives an interesting character to the building. The carvings start from the main archway entrance, where the door stands, and goes up to the balcony. This gives the lower and upper floor continuous harmony in terms of architecture. Shelter and underground maternity hospital During World War II Malta had direct involvement in the war receiving bombardments from Italy and Germany. For safety measures several war time shelters have been built mainly near the cities within the fortifications of the Order of St. John. In the villages such as Naxxar only few shelters were excavated in private homes by families who permitted them. The most known war time shelter are the one found at Palazzo Parisio and the one at Palazzo Nasciaro, specifically because they were both opened for public when time called and both were used as temporal underground hospitals. Palazzo Nasciaro has two shelters on different levels underground, with one dug and starting at street level used as a maternity hospital. The shelters were excavated by hands in the form of labyrinth. The \\"Air Raid\\" plaque, that was displayed at the entrance of Palazzo Nasciaro, is today to be found at the Malta at War Museum. Modern In modern contemporary restoration took place to be used as a private residence by Paul Golding. Restoration and modernization has taken place from 2007 after the townhouse fell in disuse for about twenty years, and took another seven years to finalise. The owner has developed a studio apartment on the first floor at the back of the house and added an indoor swimming pool. The original upper part of the balcony that was made of timber, which existed on the front fa√ßade, is not scheduled to be rebuilt. The house is now fitted with furniture and other movable property from established firms and designers. It is currently for sale. Architecture Palazzo Nasciaro Exterior The palace has an imposing Baroque and symmetrical front fa√ßade. The fa√ßade was initially designed by Franceso Sammut but was then redesigned by his son Giovanni as a gift of love to his wife. Matching but newly designed terrace columns were fixed to the decor after renovation instead of the former iron bars. The facade features three floors at street level. At the lower level there is access to the shelter while to access the main house there are two flight of stairs on both sides leading to the main door. Interior The interior has adopted similar architecture with a Maltese traditional courtyard. It has baroque-designed archways in the entrance and siderooms. Most of the building is modest in architecture. Today the palace is kept in the form of a home and modernization went underway. However many features have been kept such as exposition of limestone to give the sense of grotesque place and the history behind it. The palace has high ceiling, wooden apertures, original stone slabs and more. The upstairs was given more colour and modernization while preservation was still kept in mind. The palace has three indoor flight of stairs. Decorative fittings were brought from UK and France. Outdoor=Former gardens The large gardens, that the building once had, were opened for the public as Gnien il-Kmand (Commander's Gardens) named for the Lieutenant. It was the Lieutenant that knowing that there was lack of recreative areas in the surroundings he decided to make use of the gardens by opening them to the public. However the gardens were later developed into modern housing. Central courtyard and backyard The central courtyard still retains some of the original features of the building, with minimal modifications. In the courtyard there are some plantations such as Cestrum nocturnum and Star Jasmine giving the palace a romantic appearance day and night. At the courtyard a small but decorative fountain features at a wall. Most rooms on the groundfloor touching the courtyard have direct portal access to the courtyard. From the large backgardens there is now a side backyard. Cultural Heritage The Palazzo at night The townhouse, at 31 Triq il-Kbira, is listed as a grade 2 national monument by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA).\\"PROTECTION GRANTED TO A FURTHER 29 BUILDINGS AND SITES \\"22 historic properties scheduled\\", The Malta Independent, 2012.\\"The Malta Government Gazette\\", 2012.

Her pupils included several prominent opera singers, actors, and entertainers, including sopranos Ren√©e Fleming, Renata Tebaldi, Anna Moffo, tenor Anthony Dean Griffey, and actors Madeline Kahn, Kevin Kline, Constance Towers, and Juilliard voice professor Cynthia Hoffmann among others. Music critic Anthony Tommasini wrote that \\"Johnson was particularly valued by students for a keen ability to find individual solutions to their problems.\\" Life and career Born Beverley Peck in Portland, Oregon, Johnson was the daughter of Hartwig O. Peck and Cecilia W. Peck. She grew up in Walla Walla, Washington, and earned degrees in both speech and drama from the Ellison-White Conservatory of Music in Portland. Shortly thereafter she moved to New York where she began studies in piano with Andre Kostelanetz, and was soon active as an accompanist for singers and ensembles in NYC. Peck studied voice with one of the singers she accompanied in NYC, tenor Hardesty Johnson, who became her husband. Her husband was a faculty member at the Juilliard School and she served as his studio accompanist during lessons and for masterclasses. She often performed in joint recital with her husband as both a pianist and a soprano vocalist. She accompanied other well known singers as well in concerts during her career. Hardesty Johnson died in 1952. In 1960, Johnson joined the voice faculty of the School of Sacred Music at the Union Theological Seminary where she taught until 1965. She joined the faculty at the Juilliard School in 1964 where she taught until her death 37 years later. She concurrently worked on the faculty of the Aspen Music Festival and School; as an adjunct professor at the Conservatory of Music at Brooklyn College; and as a professor at the Manhattan School of Music from 1982‚Äì1989. In addition to working as a University professor, Peck taught out of a private studio. One of her notable pupils was actor Kevin Kline who began studying with her to prepare his voice for the music in the 1983 film version of The Pirates of Penzance. Kline stated in an interview that Peck \\"was very, very strict about protecting the voice\\", and that he must choose between cigarettes and her if he was a smoker. Peck's other private students included Sarah Atereth, Ara Berberian, Blythe Danner, Mignon Dunn, Tammy Grimes, Madeline Kahn, Evelyn Lear, Rita Shane, Renata Tebaldi, Constance Towers, Giorgio Tozzi, and Theodor Uppman. Johnson also had a widely known reputation of helping voices experiencing distress. She was hired to assist President Lyndon B. Johnson in his post-operative recovery from the surgical removal of vocal fold nodules while he was in office. She was also sought by Anna Moffo when the renowned soprano began experiencing vocal difficulties in the 1970s. In a 1977 interview with The New York Times, Johnson said following about her work with Moffo: > Anna's voice has been there all the time. It's just that somebody along the > way forgot to tell her that you can't run a Rolls-Royce without gas in it. > She has one of the really natural beautiful voices, like Tebaldi. But she > never had any true physiological technique to fall back on. She had no > breath support; there was no resonance in the lower or middle voice. Only > air was coming out. So what we tried to do for the past two years is wash > away the crud and build up her stamina. A singer, like an athlete, has to > have every workable muscle trained. Death Johnson died in Manhattan in 2001 at the age of 96. At the time leading up to her death she was closely administered by her pupils Anthony Dean Griffey and Ren√©e Fleming. Fleming described Griffey as \\"like a surrogate son to Beverley\\", and recounted how her final lesson with her teacher was just a month before Johnson's death. Some of her pupils became celebrated voice teachers and accompanists in their own right, including Shane, Robert White (tenor), Margot Garrett, Ken Noda, Cynthia Hoffmann, and Brian Zeger. Adamantly opposed to having her photo taken, The New York Times was unable to locate or obtain a photo of her at the time of her death.

As a result, Trinidadians do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship, cultural identification with the islands as whole, or either Trinidad or Tobago specifically. Although citizens make up the majority of Trinidadians, there is a substantial number of Trinidadian expatriates, dual citizens and descendants living worldwide, chiefly elsewhere in the Anglosphere. Population The total population of Trinidad and Tobago was 1,328,019 according to the 2011 census,Trinidad and Tobago 2011 Population and Housing Census Demographic Report an increase of 5.2 per cent since the 2000 census. According to the 2012 revision of the World Population Prospects the total population was estimated at 1,328,000 in 2010, compared to only 646,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 20.7 per cent, 71 per cent was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 8.3 per cent was 65 years or older. Ethnic groups The ethnic composition of Trinidad and Tobago reflects a history of conquest and immigration.\\" While the earliest inhabitants were of Amerindian heritage, since the 20th century the two dominant groups in the country were those of South Asian and of African heritage. Indians-South Asian Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonians make up the country's largest ethnic group (approximately 37.6 percent). They are primarily descendants from indentured workers from South Asia, brought to replace freed African slaves who refused to continue working on the sugar plantations from other Islands. Through cultural preservation residents of Indian descent continue to maintain traditions from their ancestral homeland. Sub-Saharan African Afro-Trinidadians and Tobagonians make up the country's second largest ethnic group, with approximately 36.3 percent of the population Afro-Trinidadians were the descendants of emigrants from other islands of the Caribbean, especially Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Vincent and Grenada. Other Afro-Trinidadians trace their ancestry to American slaves recruited to fight for the British in the War of 1812 or from indentured labourers from West Africa. Other origins There are also significant minorities of Douglas (mixed Indian and African ancestry), Mulattoes (mixed African and European ancestry), Europeans, Chinese, Arabs, Venezuelans, Zambos-Maroons (mixed African and indigenous Amerindian ancestry), Cocoa panyols-Pardos (mixed African, European, and indigenous Indian ancestry), Anglo-Indians (mixed Indian and British ancestry), and Jews, residing in Trinidad and Tobago. Emigration Emigration from Trinidad and Tobago, as with other Caribbean nations, has historically been high; most emigrants go to the United States, Canada, and Britain. Emigration has continued, albeit at a lower rate, even as the birth-rate sharply dropped to levels typical of industrialised countries. Largely because of this phenomenon, as of 2011, Trinidad and Tobago has been experiencing a low population growth rate (0.48 per cent).

The newly redeveloped venue opened to the public in October 2015. It has a 1,000 capacity, however this is only reached up to six occasions per annum. The development includes 30 live/work units that are due for completion in Spring 2016. History Central Tram Depot and Central Workshops in 2013 Tramshed is located in the refurbished Cardiff Tram Depot and Central Workshops, in the suburb of Grangetown. The Grangetown tram depot was one of six in Cardiff (though three of these closed in 1902/3). Its red brick buildings date from 1902, were extended in 1925 and served as the terminus for Cardiff's trams to the west of the city, from 1902 until 1946. They were used for the trolleybus service until 1953. They became Grade II listed in 1997, as a \\"rare surviving large building from a major tramway system\\". The main street fa√ßade consists of eleven brick gables, each with a louvred oculus and two semi-circular windows at high level. In later years the buildings became the maintenance workshops for Cardiff Council's vehicles. In 2002 and 2003 the buildings were first proposed as a site for a ¬£3.5 million arts centre (named The Depot) as part of Cardiff's bid to become European Capital of Culture 2008. Cardiff failed in their bid and the arts centre idea didn't go any further at the time. 2010s redevelopment The Tramshed looking west along Pendyris Street In the Spring of 2013 the council's vehicle maintenance centre moved to a new location and the old buildings were put on the market. Several options were being considered for its future use. In November 2014 Cardiff Council revealed they were in \\"advanced negotiations\\" with a buyer to transform the buildings into an arts centre which would include a gallery, dance studios, work units and conference facilities. The developers, TShed, put their proposals forward for planning approval in March 2015. The architects were Ellis Williams Architects (who had previously redesigned a flour mill to become the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Newcastle). An open day was held for the public to consult the plans. Plans now included a 1000-person capacity music venue and possibly a micro-brewery. The first element of the transformation, the 1,000 capacity music venue opened in late October 2015, though the first scheduled concert (UB40) on 24 October had to be moved to Cardiff University Students Union because of a delay in completion.

He was fond of painting since childhood and visited an art school. He also produced hand-made cartoons by drawing humorous scenes from the life of his neighbours on a transparent filmstrip and demonstrating them to a great success. In 1951, Popov was employed by Soyuzmultfilm; for the next ten years he had been working as an animator with Ivan Ivanov-Vano, Alexandra Snezhko-Blotskaya, Leonid Amalrik and other leading directors. Since 1960, he had been directing films together with Vladimir Pekar, also acting as an art director. Their most popular work of that time was Umka (1969), a traditionally animated short about a little polar bear loved by generations of children, along with the lullaby song performed by Aida Vedishcheva.Facts about polar bears article at Arctic.ru, 11 March 2016 Since 1975, Popov had been working alone. Among his popular films were adaptations of Nikolay Nosov's Bobik Visiting Barbos (1977) and Yuri Koval's The Adventures of Vasya Kurolesov (1981). Yet his biggest success was the Three from Prostokvashino trilogy produced in 1978‚Äî1984 and based on the comedy fairy tales by Eduard Uspensky.

He is an elected fellow of the American Physical Society, a fellow of the Society of Rheology, as well as a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Education and career Brady was educated in chemical engineering at the University of Pennsylvania (B.S. 1975), the University of Cambridge, England (Certificate of Postgraduate Study, 1976), and Stanford University (M.S. 1977 and Ph.D. 1981). He completed his dissertation entitled Inertial effects in closed cavity flows and their influence in drop breakup advised by Professor Andreas Acrivos. Following his Ph.D, Brady was a NATO post-doctoral fellow at the Ecole Superi√©ure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles, Paris, France (1980‚Äì81). John F. Brady at California Institute of Technology Following his research in France, Brady joined the faculty in chemical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an assistant professor in 1981. He moved in 1985 to the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology, which has been his academic home since.  Research contributions  Brady is an expert in the theory and simulations of fluid mechanics, rheology, and transport phenomena. He has made significant research contributions in the understanding of active matter and suspensions. Among his many accomplishments is the creation of Stokesian dynamics with Georges Bossis. The Stokesian dynamics method allows the accurate and rapid simulation of the dynamics and rheology of suspensions of spherical particles at low Reynolds number. The technique has been used by researchers world-wide to model suspensions and understand a variety of physical systems. Brady and collaborators discovered the micromechanical \\"swim pressure\\" that contributes to the unique self-assembly and phase separation in a broad class of active matter. Brady was an associate editor of the Journal of Fluid Mechanics (1990-2004) and the editor of the Journal of Rheology (2005-2012).

She worked for the Paran√° State department of water and energy. Marques graduated in civil engineering in 1945 at the Federal University of Paran√°, becoming the first black woman engineer in Brazil.  Biography  Enedina Marques was born in Curitiba, Paran√°, to Paulo Marques and Virg√≠lia Alves Marques, who came to the city in the 1910s. According to sources the family established at the Ah√∫ or Port√£o neighbourhoods, where Dona Duca, as Virgilia was known, worked as a washerwoman. In the 1920s, Dona Duca worked for the family of police officer and major Domingos Nascimento Sobrinho, who had a daughter, Isabel, of the same age as Enedina. He paid Enedina's education in private schools. Between 1925 and 1926, Marques was alphabetized. The following year she entered the Normal School, where she graduated between 1932 and 1935. Together with Isabel, Enedina worked as a teacher in several cities of the state of Paran√°, including Rio Negro, S√£o Mateus do Sul, Cerro Azul, and Campo Largo. Between 1935 and 1937, Marques came back to Curitiba to study Madureza, a preparatory course for teachers, at the Novo Ateneu. She taught classes in a school at the Juvev√™ neighborhood. In 1940, she entered the University of Paran√°'s School of Engineering, from where she graduated in 1945, becoming the first female engineer of Paran√° and the first black woman engineer in Brazil, at the age of 32. Before her, two black people graduated in engineering at the institution ‚Äì Ot√°vio Alencar (1918) and Nelson Jos√© da Rocha (1938). In 1946, Marques left teaching, and became engineering assistant at the State Secretary of Transport and Public Works. The following year she was transferred by Governor Mois√©s Lupion to the State Department of Water and Electric Power. She was employed in the state's hydroelectric plant and worked on the harnessing the waters of rivers Capivari, Cachoeira and Igua√ßu.( She was also an instructor at the Col√©gio Estadual do Paran√° and the CEU ‚Äì Casa do Estudante Universit√°rio de Curitiba. In 1958, major Domingos Nascimento Sobrinho died, leaving Enedina as one of his beneficiaries in his will. In 1961, the sociologist Oct√°vio Ianni interviewed Marques for the UHNESCO-funded research \\"Metamorfoses do escravo\\". In 1962, she retired as a civil servant and was acknowledged by Governor Ney Braga with a decree that guaranteed her a retirement income equivalent to the salary of a judge. In 1981, Marques died of a heart attack at the Lido Building, in downtown Curitiba. She had no immediate family and it took time for her body to be found. Di√°rio Popular, a city's tabloid, depicted her as if she were a complete unknown, causing outrage of the faculty and students of Instituto de Engenharia do Paran√°. After the case, the press published various articles highlighting her achievements. In 1988, a street was named after her in Vila Oficinas in the Cajuru neighbourhood, and her name was added to the Memorial √† Mulher Pioneira, a place built by the Soroptimists ‚Äì an international human rights organization of which she was member.

The film was released as a biography genre documentary originally on March 15, 2015 at South by Southwest. After that, the film was made available through various streaming platforms, including Netflix, iTunes and Freeform. In September 2016, the network ABC bought a comedy based on the Twinsters documentary from the creators responsible for Funny or Die. Background Ana√Øs Bordier is a French student studying in the UK. She is sitting on a London bus when a friend sends her a still picture from a YouTube video. She is amazed by the physical similarity of the American woman in the video to herself, but fails to find more information. Some weeks later, she receives the trailer of the film 21 & Over, which features the same woman. After some research, she finds that her doppelg√§nger is actress Samantha Futerman, who like her was born in South Korea and adopted as a baby. She is also shocked to find that they have the same date of birth, so she reaches out to her potential twin via Facebook. Plot The film opens with Futerman explaining to the audience that she wants to share the crazy story that happened to her a few days previously. It introduces her family and explains that she received a friend request on Facebook from a stranger, and when she looks at the account's profile picture she sees her own face looking back at her. She accepts the friend request, and receives a message from Bordier hinting strongly that they may be twins and asking her for more details of her birthplace. The two women then text back and forth and agree to speak to each other on Skype. After the two women experience their first video call, they can confirm that they do in fact bear a striking resemblance to each other, and from that point set out to prove whether they are sisters, and furthermore if they are in fact twins. Futerman visits twin expert Dr. Nancy Segal and the two women take DNA samples together while using Skype. A trip to London is organized and using friends as buffers, the women finally meet. That evening, they both speak to Dr. Segal over Skype who confirms it is beyond doubt that they are identical twins. The film documents their further experiences, including Bordier's visit to Futerman in California, and the twins' subsequent trip to Seoul for the International Korean Adoptee Associations Conference. All along, they have pursued their birth mother, who denies having the twins. At the end, they compose a message to this woman, to thank her for giving them life.  Impact  The movie first premiered on March 15, 2015 at the South by Southwest Film Festival, where the film was well-received and got special jury recognition for its editing. The film was also met with praise at the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival in which the film then later received the recognition as the best documentary through the grand jury prize. Following the success of the movie, the twins, Futerman and Bordier were able to publish a book, Separated @ Birth: A True Love Story of Twin Sisters Reunited, recounting their story and process of adapting to life with the knowledge of each other, as well as their experiences adjusting back to normal life after they parted ways. The book served to give some more minuscule details of the twins' conversations and life after meeting each other, and gave more context on their situation from the perspectives of each woman. In the following years after the premiere of the movie, Futerman has served as an adoption advocate with Jenna Ushkowitz, a fellow actress known in the public to be a Korean adoptee and star of Glee. The two worked together to cofound a company dedicated to providing a resource online for adoptees to learn about options for travel, support, and translation, if they should choose to attempt to reunite with their birth families. The organization, Kindred: The Foundation for Adoption, aims to help adoptees with varying needs and issues, as well as their families, in trying to reconnect and reestablish their lives together.

In fact, the Union of the Centre (UdC) refused to accept the candidacy of incumbent governor, Nichi Vendola, a democratic socialist. UdC's leader, Pier Ferdinando Casini, proposed to the PD the candidacy of Emiliano, who initially refused. However, after a few days, under pressure from party's bigwigs like Massimo D'Alema and Pier Luigi Bersani, Emiliano was forced to accept the candidacy. Emiliano agreed to carry out primary with Vendola, but he refused to resign as Mayor of Bari, asking the Regional Council to change a regional law, which prevented incumbent mayors to run for regional governor while in office. Faced with the unavailability of the Regional Council to amend this law, Emiliano withdrew his candidacy and asked to the regional secretary of his party to directly appoint Vendola as centre- left candidate. Nevertheless, the Democratic Party nominated Francesco Boccia to the primaries, where he was defeated by Vendola. Boccia's defeat led to the break-up of the electoral alliance in Apulia between UdC and PD.

At that time, it included 41 contributing buildings, six other contributing structures, and eight non-contributing buildings. West Liberty was established in the Iowa Territory as Wapsipinoc Settlement after near-by Wapsipinoc Creek. The town itself was platted when the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad was built here in 1855. The railroad later became the Chicago, Rock Island, and Pacific. The town was first incorporated on January 1, 1868. By the early 1870s the Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Minnesota Railroad was also built through town. It became part of the Rock Island system in 1903. The presence of the railroads led to the town's prosperity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Most of the buildings in the district were built by 1922. Four of the infill buildings were completed in the 1940s, and largely replaced older buildings that were lost to fire. Two more buildings were built in the 1970s and the 1980s. Most of the buildings are masonry construction, and a majority of those are brick, with only a couple of frame buildings. Structures with Italianate and Neoclassical features predominate in the district. Generally, the buildings are two stories in height, with none taller than three stories. Large corner buildings anchor each block. Most of the buildings have housed retail establishments, but others housed banks, fraternal halls, a movie theater, and an opera house. There are also a few houses in the district on West Fourth Street. Five of the contributing structures are the streets that were paved with brick in 1915. There is a small portion of Calhoun Street near the railroad tracks that is now asphalt with the original bricks being removed. The sixth contributing structure is the grain elevator that anchors the southwest corner of the district. It is of an older crib style construction.

At the creation of a special school of industrial design and weaving by the Ghent city council in 1852, Sunaert was appointed to teach the second part of the course. He was sent to Paris and Lyon in France to learn the specialist technical knowledge. When the school was merged with the Industrial School in 1857, Sunaert became professor of the spinning course. Young woman on a market On 8 August 1857 Sunaert was appointed professor at the Academy of Fine Arts of Ghent. He taught algebra, geometry, stone cutting and perspective. He drafted two course books in the Dutch language, one on perspective entitled Doorzichtigheid of perspectief (1855) and one on geometry entitled Meetkundige bepalingen en begrippen met toepassingen bestemd voor de leerlingen der klas van lijntekening (1871). He also wrote in collaboration with L. Debaudt a bilingual French-Dutch manual on designs for doors and windowns entitled Recueil de 24 planches de mod√®les de portes et fen√™tres (1875). One of Sunaert's students was the painter Gustave den Duyts who studied spinning and weaving with him.Rik van Daele, Zes Reynaertschilderingen in het huis van Max Rooses, in: Tiecelijn 25 Jaarboek 5 van het Reynaertgenootschap, vzw Reynaertgenootschap, Pr. Jos. Charlottelaan 48, B-9100 Sint-Niklaas, 2012, p. 110-159 In 1870 Sunaert prepared a detailed catalogue of the collection of the local museum of fine arts, which was published in French as Catalogue descriptif du Mus√©e de la ville de Gand. A year later, Sunaert, who was a supporter of the cause of the Flemish (Dutch) language in Belgium, published a Dutch-language version of the catalogue the next year. His catalogue provided a detailed description of the works in the museum collection with very careful attributions of the works and received abundant praise. The city council of Ghent was of the opinion that the local museum did not receive a sufficient number of visitors. It entrusted Sunaert in 1871 with the task of designing a reorganization of the museum. In his report Sunaert advised that the works of the Flemish artists Gaspar de Crayer and Nicolas de Liemaker be given prominence and that all the works in the collection be presented chronologically. Sunaert's proposals would require some adjustments to the museum building and was rejected by the city council.Liesbet Nys, 'De intrede van het publiek: museumbezoek in Belgi√´', 1830-1914 Universitaire Pers Leuven, 2009, p. 223, 239 The Ghent city council also gave Sunaert the task to write a report on the state of all the holdings in the city's art collection located in the civil buildings and churches in the city. His report was issued in 1672 and commenced a tradition of annual inspections of the city's collections. Sunaert was able to recover some objects for the city council and was entrusted to restore others. From 1675 he was a member of the city's local commission of monuments. Sunaert was active in the 'Liberale Associatie' ('Liberal Association'), the political organization of the liberal party in Ghent. He was co-founder in 1846 of the 'Vlaamsch Gezelschap' ('Flemish Society'), an organization pursuing the emancipation of the Flemish people in Belgium and the recognition of Flemish (Dutch) on an equal footing with the French language in the country. He later joined the Willemsfonds, a cultural organization promoting the Dutch language and Flemish culture.

John Lambton was raised to the peerage as Baron Durham in 1828, whereupon Master Lambton became The Honourable Charles William Lambton and heir to his father's title and estates. However, Charles died young at Brighton on 24 September 1831, aged 13 from tuberculosis.

Charles's younger brother D'Arcy thus became the heir. After John Lambton was further created Earl of Durham in 1833, D'Arcy inherited the titles on the death of his father in 1840. Early history The portrait of seven year old Charles William Lambton was painted for the subject's father by Sir Thomas Lawrence for the price of 600 guineas (about ¬£46,000/$57,000 in 2014) and was completed in 1825.Lawrence H. Officer and Samuel H. Williamson, \\"Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1270 to Present,\\" MeasuringWorth, 2015 William T. Whitley's Art of England 1821-1837 (1930) states a contemporary writer in News of Literature and Fashion reported that Lawrence had originally painted the boy's clothes in yellow, despite the latter's father being called the \\"yellow dandy\\". John Lambton tormented Lawrence \\"on the score of the unfitness of the colour, until he got it blotted out by the crimson.\\" Whitley also mentions that when the painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1825, the Hanging Committee of George Jones, Alfred Edward Chalon and Thomas Phillips chose the painting to be hung high up in the School of Painting, away from the Great Room. Lambton believed this to be due to him being a Whig and declared he would never buy another picture from a Royal Academician.William T. Whitley, Art of England 1821-1837 (1930), Read Books, 2007 However, D. E.

The vineyard is located in the cool climate of Moonambel (Victoria, Australia). Moonambel is a sub-region of Victoria's Pyrenees wine region, which was pioneered by the vineyards of Taltarni, Warrenmang, Redbank (Sally's Paddock) and Dalwhinnie. During the early ‚Äì mid 1970s Ewan Jones (an Architect based in Ballarat) began clearing 35 acres of land in Moonambel; which would be the site of the main Dalwhinnie vineyard in years to come. After the planting of Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon in 1976, Ewan's wife Betty named the site 'Dalwhinnie' as a homage to her Scottish heritage. In 1983, David Jones (Ewan's oldest son) took over the management of the vineyard and the brand. Over the subsequent 18 years David, and wife Jenny, continue to plant vines; adding Chardonnay and Pinot Noir to the varietal mix. Dalwhinnie has a unique microclimate that is vastly different from their direct neighbours. With an elevation around 550 metres above sea level and an amphitheatre shaped topography, any cool air funnels away from the vines, making the vineyard almost impervious to frost. The soil is sedimentary and relatively infertile, and the grapes are hand- harvested between February and April; depending on the variety and the attributes of the vintage. Dalwhinnie is the only winery within the greater Pyrenees region to have two listings within the Langton's Classification of Australian Wine consisting of 'Outstanding' for The Eagle Shiraz, and 'Excellent' for the Moonambel Shiraz.Langton's 2015 Classification www.langtons.com.au/classifications Their wines' have continued to achieve worldwide acclaim from experts such as Robert M.
