Francione. The basic premise of the book is that there is a fundamental difference between those that call for animal welfare reform and those that call for the complete abolition of animal use (called 'welfarism' and 'abolitionism'), and that animals have a fundamental right to not be exploited. Abolitionism, welfarism and new welfarism Francione argues that the animal rights movement only emerged in the late 1970s and 1980s. Until that time, concern for animals was limited to ensuring that animals were well cared for during their exploitation.Francione, Rain Without Thunder, pg 1 The animal rights position calls for the total abolition of animal use and exploitation, as \\"animals, like humans, have inherent value that must be respected\\".Francione, Rain Without Thunder, pg 2 Francione also describes a third category, which is that of the ‚Äònew welfarist‚Äô. New welfarists are those that argue the best path to animal rights or abolition is through welfare reform and believe that welfare reform will make humans more receptive to inherently valuing animals. Francione argues that new welfarism does not work, and actually prolongs animal exploitation. Francione describes the welfarist or new welfarist movement as simply advocating for \\"longer chains for the slaves\\". Francione describes the differing philosophies of Peter Singer and Tom Regan toward animal use. He criticises heavily the utilitarian position of Singer, who believes that animal use is acceptable so long as their interests are given equal consideration to humans, and praises Regan‚Äôs deontological position of giving all animals rights. Francione argues that most animal rights groups are too passive in their approach, and have diluted their messages in the hopes of gaining cultural acceptance. The only group which has not done this, according to Francione, is Animal Liberation Front, which performs rescues for animals, often of a dangerous or illegal nature. Does welfare reform work? One of the key criticisms that Francione makes of welfarists and new welfarists is that welfarism reform simply doesn‚Äôt work, and in fact is harmful to the cause as welfare reform is argued to make people more comfortable with animal exploitation, and therefore less likely to stop using animals. Welfare reform is also claimed to make the animal exploitation industry more efficient.Francione, Rain Without Thunder, pg 12 Carcass damage occurs when food animals are improperly slaughtered and bruise themselves in their deathroes. Welfare reform to slaughter animals more humanely reduces the likelihood of this occurring, improving profits and public image for animal slaughterers. Francione argues that advocating for welfare reform does nothing to challenge the ‚Äòresearch establishment‚Äô, and in fact that the livestock industry already advocates welfare reform. The Animal Welfare Act, passed in 1966 and amended in 1985, is heralded as a victory by welfare advocates, but is useless according to Francione, and is indistinguishable from the status quo. Francione claims that the methodology of new welfarists in pursuing welfare reform cannot result in the abolition of their legal property status, which he argues is what matters most. Further, he argues that the short and long term goals of new welfarism are in direct conflict. He also argues that it is wrong to surrender the rights of animals today in the hopes of achieving rights for animals sometime in the future. Criticism Rain Without Thunder and the views depicted within have been criticised by those within the animal movement. One criticism is that Francione depicts a purist ideal and does not care for incremental approaches to animal welfare, but wants the end of animal use now and is not interested in discussing the practicality or methodology to make this happen. Francione heavily criticises utilitarianism, particularly through its main modern proponent, Peter Singer. The book is criticised, however, for not stepping into the active debate between consequentialism and deontology, instead taking it for granted that deontology and a rights approach are correct. In praising Tom Regan, he also ignores the fact that Regan himself is an advocate of a hierarchy which allows the killing of some forms of life but not mammals. The style of the book itself is criticised as being long-winded and repetitive, with excessive detail that would only be of interest to an insider of the movement.

Eleanor Lyon Duke (April 12, 1918 ‚Äì November 1, 2013) was a professor of biology at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), known for her 78-year association with the school and for her sex-discrimination lawsuit against the university. In 1974 she was named UTEP's \\"Outstanding Ex\\". Family Mary Eleanor Lyon was born in Marfa, Texas, to William L. Lyon Sr. (1890‚Äì1977) and Eleanor Ida McCamant Lyon (1895‚Äì1991). She was the great- granddaughter of Georgia Supreme Court jurist Richard F. Lyon. The family moved to El Paso, Texas, when she was a young child, where her grandmother Lucinda Nelson McCamant (1876‚Äì1968) was one of the first Realtors. Her father and mother had met when Lyon Sr. was in West Texas as part of Pershing's Pancho Villa Expedition. Eleanor Lyon married Jack Duke in 1939, the year she graduated from Texas College of Mines (which later became Texas Western College and then UTEP), and lived with him in Louisiana where he worked as a revenuer for ATF before he joined the Army and served in China as a military police during World War II. After the war they lived in El Paso, where he worked as a border agent and she went to work for the college in 1948. With no children of her own, Duke was close to her seven nephews and three nieces ‚Äì 9 children of her brother William L. Lyon Jr., plus Jack Duke's sister Louise Duke Cross's daughter, all raised in El Paso. Professional Duke was known by multiple generations of biology students at UTEP, before, during, and after her Ph.D. research and degree which was awarded in 1967 for her dissertation \\"Production Study of a Thermal Spring\\". Among her works was a 1973 study showing that toxic effects of marijuana injection, observed in more than a few servicemen, was due to contaminants, not to THC toxicity. In 1979 Duke filed a sex discrimination lawsuit against UTEP \\"as a class representative of all female faculty members, alleging that UTEP‚Ä¶ discriminated against her and other female faculty members in pay, promotion, and teaching opportunities\\", which she ultimately won, compelling the system to change their policies and procedures. She retired in 1985, and died in 2013 at the age of 95.

He was the First Chairman of the Executive Committee of that city (equivalent to mayor). He was killed when Stavropol was falling to the Czech Legion during the Russian Civil War. Early life and medical career Banykin was born on in the village of Bektyashka in the Sengileyevsky Uyezd of the Simbirsk Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Sengileyevsky District, Ulyanovsk Oblast, Russia). Banykin's father was an unskilled laborer, and his parents hoped for him to become a saddle maker, but he decided to become a doctor. in 1904 Banykin was graduated from the Stavropol city secondary school with good to excellent marks. From 1904 to 1908 he studied at medical school in Samara, on a scholarship provided by the Stavropol zemstvo (local government). From 1908 to 1910 Banykin worked as a medical assistant during an epidemic in Bugulminsky District and later in Hryasch—ëvke in Stavropol District where he helped fight a cholera epidemic, for which he was given an award by the Stavropol zemstvo. In 1910 Banykin enrolled in the medical school at the University of Tartu, but only studied for four semesters, as his father died and he was left without means. He applied to the Stavropol zemstvo for a subsidy, on the grounds that he had fought skillfully against the Stavropol cholera epidemic, asking for a stipend of 180 rubles to be repaid after he began practicing medicine. However, his application was rejected because he had only served in Stavropol for one year. Banykin then returned to Stavropol, where he was employed as a medical assistant in the district hospital, where he worked until 1917. Political rise Even before the Russian Revolutions of 1917 Banykin had become a member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party (SR Party). After the split of the party, Banykin adhered to the \\"Left SR\\", the more radical and pro-Bolshevik wing. Stavropol District Executive Committee, 1918; Banykin is second from the right On 5 May 1917 Banykin became First Chairman of the City Council of Stavropol. He actively promoted the Left SR program (land declared national property, urban merchants assessed with high taxes, sharp criticism of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk). From the very beginning of his term in office, the city introduced the eight hour workday, and spent the money seized from merchants on the creation of kindergartens in the villages of the district and to build a playground in Stavropol as well as hospitals and schools. Largely due to Banykin's influence, the November 1917 elections to the Russian Constituent Assembly saw a result of 86,131 votes for the Socialist Revolutionary Party against 3,983 for the Bolshevik Party. Banykin's main achievement was the formation of an entirely new apparatus of power. He achieved unification of purpose of the City Council and with the Council of Peasant Deputies. He participated in the chartering of the first worker's cooperatives in the district. While he used political force to some ends ‚Äì dissolving the city zemstvo duma (council) and some parish soviets (township assemblies) ‚Äì under his administration there were no shootings and no political arrests. On 6 March 1918 Banykin was elected Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Stavropol District, thus becoming the administrative and political chief of an area containing almost a quarter of a million people. Death After the Revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion, anti-revolutionary Legion troops advanced on Stavropol, and Banykin supervised the evacuation of the populace and removal of state property and valuables. Banykin's family was evacuated to Sengiley on the ship Hope () where they were to hide with relatives. However, Banykin himself did not make the evacuation as he was shot dead on 15 June 1918; the exact circumstances are disputed. A few days later Banykin was buried along with others killed that day. Two weeks later, his family had him reburied in a private grave. Banykin's wife Barbara returned to Stavropol after learning of her husband's death. She was arrested and imprisoned until the capture of the city by the 5th (Kursk) Regiment of the 24th (Simbirsk) Division of the Red Army on 6 October 1918. After Soviet power was thus restored, an investigation of Banykin's murder was immediately started, which investigation lasted until March 1919. Disputed versions of Banykin's Death In 1934, in the Stavropol town council received a statement from Theodosia Evgrafovna Sokolova, widow of Stavropol Executive Committee Chairman A. M. Sokolov, who had died in 1918 on the \\"train of death\\". Theodosia Sokolova accused Banykin of having been in league with the counter- revolutionary Volunteer Army. Sokolova maintained that this had not come out earlier only because Banykin had been killed, and demanded that Banykin Red Guards street be renamed. Eyewitnesses were interviewed. Their testimony indicated that the killer was a local resident, Mikhail Krasnov, who after the restoration of Soviet power had gone to Siberia, where he lived on forged documents under the name of ≈Ωilcov. In 1927 he had been arrested for the murder of Banykin and was imprisoned and then exiled. According to eyewitnesses, Banykin's corpse was abused by a merchant, Shishkin, driving a water cart twice over the body and by having its eyes poked out with a cane. All this has led to the emergence of a number of different legends and versions concerning the details of the death of Banykin. Soviet propaganda portrayed Banykin as a brave fighting Communist, who fell in the thick of the battle, in the detachment covering the evacuation of public treasures and Communist families. According to another version, Banykin was not involved in any fighting. The local Tolyatti historian Alexander Turaev wrote in the 1960s that Banykin just went out of town and on the outskirts was shot dead by a \\"local White Guard\\". A third version, described in a book by Tolyatti journalist Sergey Melnik, is that Banykin's death was an accident. Referring to the recollections of eyewitnesses, Melnik concludes that Banykin was accidentally shot dead by a security guard of a warehouse of the district consumer's union, without intention and without any political motivation. Personal life and family In 1909 Vasily Banykin married teacher Barbara Ivanovna. In 1910 they had a daughter (Barbara), in 1912 a son (Nicholas), and in 1915 a son (Vasily) who died in 1921. After the death of her husband, in 1921‚Äì1922 Barbara Banykin lived in Stavropol with her daughter. During the famine she repeatedly appealed for help to the executive committee, and was allocated food and shoes for her daughter. Barbara Banykin remarried to a Bolshevik named Yakushev, and died in 1924. Banykin's nephew Victor Banykin (1916-1986) was a writer and author of many books. His niece Anna Agureeva worked as a teacher at a school in the village of Lower Sancheleevo. Memorialization Memorial stele honoring Banykin Banykin died when the Left SRs were still in coalition with the Bolsheviks, and therefore could not be declared an enemy of the people. Instead, he was declared by the Soviets to have been an active Bolshevik, not just a prominent public figure but a prominent member of the Communist Party. References to Banykin as a Bolshevik appeared in newspapers and books. Only after 1980 did documents surface showing that Banykin was never a Communist. Tolyatti's Obelisk of Glory where Banykin is memorialized Banykin is one of the four martyrs immortalized on one of the faces of the Obelisk of Glory in Liberty Square in Tolyatti. The other three are a soldier, a sailor, and an airman of World War II. Also in honor of Banykin there is a plaque on the house where he lived, and a memorial stele on Banykin's grave, in a memorial complex on the banks of the Volga. A street was named after him in Stavropol; when Stavropol was submerged and relocated to the present Tolyatti, a small street in a residential sector was named for him. By decree number 647/31 of the Executive Committee of the Council of People's Deputies of Tolyatti on 1 November 1967, he was described as one \\"who fell at the hands of the enemy in the line of duty\\" and given a more important street as a namesake. In the same resolution City Clinical Hospital Number 2 of Togliatti was named for Banykin. One of the training ships of the Tolyatti Young Sailors Club was named Vasily Banykin.

Mass marketed public health messages reach large populations, encourage HIV testing, communicate the routes of infection, and explain how to protect oneself from infection; but they do not explore the intimate contexts that aggravate the spread of HIV. It is difficult for a thirty-second PSA to convey the intense contradictory emotions a woman or man, may feel when faced with the decision to use a condom in the heat of the moment. Likewise, it is unfair to assume that a thirty-minute sitcom with an HIV theme can provide comprehensive education on HIV. Again, the focus tends to be on testing and the routes of infection, which makes it easy for the viewer to tune out if it‚Äôs information they have previously heard or read. The Punany Poets, however, perform the intimate contexts. Their work speaks to women who maintain romantic relationships for financial security, in spite of continually contracting sexually transmitted diseases from their partners. Their work explores how childhood sexual abuse can potentially lead to self- destructive behavior like substance abuse. They show how to make condoms a seductive, fun part of the sex act. They address HIV by depicting the various socio-cultural, emotional, physical, and spiritual issues around it. The Punany Poets perform HIV interventions by specifically encouraging women to be proud of and take control of their sexuality, which is different from merely protecting yourself from a man. In the Punany paradigm, women are active agents, while public health messages tend to position them as passive ones,\\" Author Raquel Monroe writes.

Critical reception A reviewer in Freeman's Journal was underwhelmed by the book noting it is \\"described as 'a novel with a purpose.' Masters of the craft of bookmaking like Dickens also wrote novels with a purpose, the moral of which ran in a thin red line of tragedy carefully woven into a healthy story in which comedy had its share.' In The Devastators the purpose is the whole plot; and, however excellent it may be to hold up the mirror to ill-chosen marriages for the instruction of others, the result is rather dismal to the reader in this case.\\"\\"The Bookman's Corner\\", Freeman's Journal, 1 March 1902, p28  Notes  In her autobiography Thirty Years in Australia published in 1930, Cambridge made the following confession: \\"When I wrote a novel called The Devastators I knew that I was laying down a rule contradicted in my own circle by two glaring exceptions. This bright and beautiful woman is one of them; the other is a person still nearer to me. I had to apologise to both of them when that book came out. From their childhood they have been exposed to flatteries that should have spoiled them utterly; both have proved unspoilable. In the case of one of the pretty faces, it does not even care to look at itself in the glass; the mere ordinary vanity of the ordinary female is lacking. So that to this large extent my theory of the effect of physical charm upon its possessor is discredited. While I am glad to state the fact, I am sorry to remain of the opinion that such exceptions are exceptions, and that the rule is still the rule.\\"Thirty Years in Australia by Ada Cambridge, p144 See also * 1901 in Australian literature References 1901 Australian novels Novels about marriage ","title":"The Devastators (Cambridge novel)"},{"id":"51062561","title":"Barewal Dogran"},{"id":"51062563","text":"Biester is a surname.

In the Kinki proportional representation block, the Restoration Party received 30.8% of the vote, entitling them to ten of the block's 29 seats. However, Shimizu's relatively large margin of defeat in his district meant he finished twelfth amongst his party's candidates and missed out on a seat in the House of Representatives. Shimizu then turned his attention to the House of Councillors election scheduled for July 2013. He contested the two-member Hyogo at-large district for the Restoration Party and finished second in the vote, defeating Democratic Party incumbent Yasuhiro Tsuji by more than 11%. During his first term in the House of Councillors, Shimizu's role has included serving on the House's audit committee, economy and industry committee, and the special committee on the abduction of Japanese citizens by North Korea. =Party membership= In June 2014 the Restoration Party split due to disagreement between the party's leaders concerning a proposed merger with the Unity Party. Shimizu remained with the Restoration Party, led by Osaka mayor Toru Hashimoto, which completed the merger with the Unity Party in September 2014, creating the Japan Innovation Party. In August 2015 the Innovation Party suffered a split over policy issues, and Shimizu again sided with the Hashimoto-led faction that left the Innovation Party to form the Initiatives from Osaka party in October 2015.

Eppinger became a Servant of God on 30 August 2005 and was declared Venerable on 19 December 2011 after Pope Benedict XVI confirmed her life of heroic virtue. Pope Francis confirmed a miracle attributed to her in 2018; the beatification was celebrated in Strasbourg on 9 September 2018. Life √âlisabeth Eppinger was born in France on 9 September 1814 as the eldest of eleven children to poor farmers. She suffered from various ailments during her childhood and was noted for her ardent faith in God. Her parish priest Jean-David Reichard (1796‚Äì1867) knew of her desire to establish a religious congregation and aided her in finding companions for her project. In 1846 she saw a vision of Jesus Christ and this began a series of ecstasies and she soon became known as \\"the Niederbronn Ecstatic\\". But Reichard also learned of her ecstasies and felt obligated to inform his bishop of this. The Bishop of Strasbourg Andreas Raess heard of her from Reichard and met her in July 1848 in order to conduct tests and interviews with her while being convinced of her intentions to serve the ill and the poor. Raess also believed that God had called Eppinger for a special mission. Father Claude Ignatius Busson published a series of writings on her ‚Äì three sets ‚Äì from 1849 until 1853 in response to these ecstasies. On 28 August 1849 she founded the Sisters of the Divine Redeemer after renouncing her dream of joining the Sisters of Ribeauville; she became the congregation's first superior. Her order received diocesan approval around that time. She made her religious vows on 2 January 1850 in the religious name of \\"Alphonse-Marie\\". Eppinger placed her order under the patronage of Alphonsus Maria de' Liguori. The congregation received the decree of praise from Pope Pius IX in 1863 and received full pontifical approval in 1866; the order had 700 sisters in 83 houses in 1863. It had received the imperial approval of Napoleon III in 1854 while during the cholera pandemic of 1854 used her order to tend to victims. Eppinger died in 1867 in the same week as Reichard. Cardinal Willem Marinus van Rossum ‚Äì in August 1931 ‚Äì said: \\"You have a foundress who is a saint!\\" Her remains were exhumed on 8 November 1950. Her order expanded to nations such as Argentina and in Angola gained 150 religious in 19 communities. Beatification Beatification Mass held in Strasbourg on 9 September 2018. The beatification process opened in Strasbourg in an informative process that commenced on 29 January 1951 and concluded its business on 12 January 1955 while theologians voiced approval to her spiritual writings on 6 July 1963. The cause remained inactive for several decades while a decree from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 30 August 2005 resumed the cause and granted \\"nihil obstat\\" ('nothing against') to the continuation of the cause while giving her the posthumous title of Servant of God. A second process opened on 7 June 2006 and closed on 25 June 2007 while the C.C.S. validated the process in Rome on 29 February 2008. A relator to the cause was appointed on 7 May 2008. The postulation submitted the Positio in two parts in 2009 and in 2010 while historians voted in favor of the cause on 1 December 2009 and consulting theologians did so as well on 29 January 2011; the C.C.S. approved the cause also on 18 October 2011. Pope Benedict XVI ‚Äì on 19 December 2011 ‚Äì proclaimed her to be Venerable after acknowledging her heroic virtue. The miracle required for her beatification was scrutinized in the place it occurred in and received C.C.S. validation on 10 October 2008. Pope Francis later confirmed this miracle in 2018. She was beatified in Strasbourg Cathedral by Congregation for the Causes of Saints Prefect Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu on 9 September 2018.https://www.vaticannews.va/it/chiesa/news/2018-09/beata- alfonsa-maria-eppinger-estatica-niederbronn.html Following her beatification, Pope Francis openly applauded and praised Eppinger's life during his weekly Sunday Angelus in the Vatican around the same time that the beatification Mass was being celebrated.https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis- dont-make-a-show-of-doing-good-38974 The current postulator for this cause is Sister Katharina Maria Kristofova.

The festival establishes a direct dialog between the solo actor and the viewing audience. The festival takes place annually during the Jewish holiday of Passover, usually in April. Its main event is a contest, to which's finals few monoactors manage to reach. The festival's name is a mix of the Hebrew words theatron (meaning theater) and netto (meaning only, just). The name emphasizes the essence of the festival, which is exposing the audience to monologues, the rawest and of the oldest forms of theater, and testing the actors' verbal delivery abilities and presenting the monologue as an enjoyable and crowd-swaying story and play. Some of the finest actors in Israel have performed on the festival's stage and have promoted the difficult form of monologue in Israeli theater.

Girls, from left to right: Ann, Xiaoqiong, Amelia and Nana. The K.R.T. Girls () are four anime-styled characters that serve as mascots for the Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit, a rapid transit system which covers metropolitan Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The girls consist of Xiaoqiong (), who is depicted as a station worker at Yanchengpu Station; Amelia (), a half-Taiwanese, half-German girl who works as a train driver; Ann (), a train mechanic; and Nana (), a Vocaloid-powered train announcer. Drawn in the \\"moe\\" art style popular throughout the region and Japan, the first of the girls was introduced in November 2014. They have since been the focus of various promotional efforts by the metro system, through the mediums of songs, posters, merchandise, as well as social media. A light novel and visual novel featuring the girls have also been produced. Riders of the system, as well as internet commentators, have reviewed the characters positively, with many finding them to be cute. Designed to be iconic representations of animated comics, the girls have brought in revenue of NT$2 million (US$61,576) in just seven months to the KMRT through merchandising.  The girls  The K.R.T. Girls are composed of four mascots. By order of their date of introduction, they are: *Xiaoqiong, also spelled Siaociong (), who is depicted as a station attendant at Yanchengpu Station, located on the KMRT Orange Line. She was debuted at a two- day event for independent comic and video game creators in Kaohsiung in November 2014. Her official biography lists her as being tall, with a weight of . Xiaoqiong also sports a unique hair accessory, which is inspired by the famous \\"Dome of Light\\" at Formosa Boulevard Station, a station ranked one of the most beautiful in the world by Metrobits.org. Xiaoqiong has a native Kaohsiung Mandarin accent, with the KMRT wanting her voice to sound \\"approachable\\" and \\"down to earth\\". *Amelia, also spelled Emelia(ËâæÁ±≥Ëéâ‰∫û), a blonde half-Taiwanese, half-German girl who works as a train driver for the KMRT. She was revealed in December 2014 and was received positively by Taiwanese netizens. Rocket News 24 pointed out similarities between Amelia's character design and that of Atago from Kantai Collection. A life-size cut-out of the character was shown on display at Kaisyuan Station on the KMRT Red Line. *Ann, also spelled Jie'er (), a \\"young-looking but fully grown\\" girl who works as a train maintenance engineer and mechanic. *Nana, also spelled Nainai (), a Vocaloid-powered girl who works as a train announcer and customer service employee.  Conception and creation  The first of the K.R.T. Girls, Xiaoqiong, debuted in early November 2014 at two-day event for independent comic and video game creators hosted in Kaohsiung. They were created through a joint effort between the transport company and a team of animated artists to promote the subway and increase revenue. Following popular and positive reception from commuters, the other characters were later revealed independently at different dates. They were created to be \\"iconic representations of animated comics\\", and, according to the n chairperson of theKaohsiung Rapid Transit Corporation,Hao Chien-sheng (), this was as the company sought only to \\"transport passengers to their destinations, but also aspires to be mobile platforms of cultural creativity.\\" The characters are drawn with a \\"moe\\" art style, which is becoming increasingly popular across Taiwan and Japan. The K.R.T. Girls have been positively reviewed by Japanese netizens as well. Even before the mascots debuted in 2014, the Taiwan Railways Administration had already been incorporating \\"moe\\" mascots into its promotional efforts, through five anime girl characters dubbed the \\"Miss Taiwan Railway\\". This is reflective of the phenomenon to use anime-styled characters to promote products in East Asia, such as Hikaru Aizawa for Microsoft Silverlight; Simon, the company which conceptualized the K.R.T. Girls, had worked on such \\"moe\\" characters before in the past, such as Xuanying () of Pingtung County, and Air (also spelled Ai'er)(), who was created for an advocacy campaign by the Vehicle Engineering Faculty of the National Pingtung University of Science and Technology. The promotional campaign, titled \\"Go ahead! K.R.T. Girls!\\" (), has been commercially very successful. According to Focus Taiwan, the girls have brought in additional revenue of NT$2 million (US$61,576) in just the first seven months of 2015, and have also drawn the interest of a local video game firm and Japanese publishers. The KMRT has also stated that revenue from official K.R.T. Girls merchandise could reach NT$4 million by the end of 2015.  Promotion and popularity  The girls have featured in various promotional efforts and official merchandise of the Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit. This includes PSA posters for subway etiquette, lifesize cardboard cutouts, as well as being temporarily plastered over trains on the Orange Line, which has been likened to \\"itasha carriages\\" by the Taipei Times. These special carriages feature three distinct art themes to allow travelers to \\"interact\\" with the girls, and have attracted several fans and cosplayers, including ones from Japan. The timetables for the carriages are posted on the company's website and updated daily. An song featuring Xiaoqiong, titled Next Station. With You () has also been released. Containing a \\"vibrant\\" and \\"happy\\" vibe, the song talks about traveling together with a loved one on board the Kaohsiung's MRT, with the Formosa Boulevard, Sizihwan, Weiwuying, and Cingpu stations being featured. Various products featuring the K.R.T. Girls have been released. These include objects such as shopping bags, backpacks, fans, postcards, bookmarks and badges with images of the four fictional women, which have been sold in collaboration between the metro operator and the National Pingtung University of Science and Technology. A serial light novel featuring the K.R.T. Girls has been published online by GA Bunko in Japanese since September 2015, with printing beginning at the end of the year. There is also an official Facebook page for the girls. As reported by the Taipei Times, an online video featuring Xiaoqiong had amassed more than 10,000 Facebook likes in one day, as well as generating a long discussion thread. The Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corporation said that it considers online discourse and responses about the characters to be positive, as different opinions and perspectives allow them to better understand their fanbase. A visual novel featuring the K.R.T. Girls, titled Go ahead! K.R.T. Girls Initiating Station () was released on January 30 in Taiwan. A song album, titled K.R.T.

The idea was proposed by Karl Gegenbaur in 1878, sometimes termed the gill septum hypothesis and it consisted of a series of rays, one ray large with the remaining small ones attached to the sides of the large one. Gegenbaur based this idea on the fin of Ceratodus and its similarity to the gill-region in Elasmobranchs. He suggested that the pentadactyl limb of modern tetrapods was derived from one side of the archipterygium. Thomas Huxley examined the idea and argued against it. He suggested that the tetrapod limb or cheiropterygium differed in its origins from that of the lungfish and that the two may have diversified from a true ancestral archipterygium. An alternate origin for tetrapod limbs was identified in the lateral fins by Francis Balfour. These were followed by several other modified hypotheses.

The Museum‚Äôs collection (numismatic or notaphilic items) reflects the history of money circulation in Ukraine from the ancient times to nowadays. The museum is housed at the National Bank of Ukraine in Kyiv. Location: 9 Instytutska Street (Entrance 5).  History  The decision to establish the Museum of Money was taken in late 1988. The exhibits of the Museum of the Ukrainian Branch Office of the State Bank of the USSR, which was founded in 1981, formed the basis for the collection. In accordance with Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No. 1766 of 29 November 2000 the NBU Museum of Money is listed as a museum whose collection and exhibits are state property and form part of the State Museum Fund of Ukraine. The NBU Museum of Money officially opened its doors to the public on 24 March 2004. The museum was launched to mark the tenth anniversary of the printing of first banknotes of independent Ukraine at the NBU‚Äôs Banknote Paper Mill. The Museum was launched by NBU Governor Serhiy Tihipko, who was in office at that time. Mr. Tihipko, along with 10th grade students from Kyiv International Relations Lyceum 51, joined an excursion to the Museum.  Collections The museum's exposition is arranged in chronological order, starting from primitive commodities that served as money to the national monetary unit of Ukraine ‚Äì the hryvnia. The museum's exhibits reflect over thousand-year-long history of the hryvnia and other monetary units that were in circulation at different times in the territory of Ukraine. The Museum of Money contains the following exhibits (both originals and replicas): * Coins of the Northern Black Sea Coast inhabited by the Greeks; * Coins of the Roman Empire in Ukraine (1st and 3rd centuries AD); * Dirhams of the Caliphate and coins of the Byzantine Empire in the Ukrainian land that circulated during the period when trade flourished with Byzantium and other eastern countries; * First coins of Kyiv Rus ‚Äì gold and silver coins (zlatnyky and sriblianyky); * Coinless Period of the 12th-14th centuries, silver hryvnia ingots as a means of payment; * Coins of Western Europe of the 15th ‚Äì 17th centuries; * Kopiykas of the Tsardom of Moscovy, metal and paper money of the Russian Empire; * Money of the Ukrainian People's Republic (1917‚Äì1920); * Russian rubles and Ukrainian karbovanets that circulated during the first years of Ukraine's independence; * Hryvnias of independent Ukraine (1996‚Äì2016); * Full collection of commemorative and jubilee coins of Ukraine; * Monetary units of other countries. The colorful stained-glass windows of the museum feature the most important milestones in the history of Ukraine that are reflected in the numismatic exhibits displayed in the museum showcases. These include pre-monetary forms of money (the Bronze Age and the Trypillya culture), money of Kyiv Rus, the Kozak epoch, the Ukrainian People‚Äôs Republic of 1917‚Äì1920 and present-day Ukraine.  Present  Financial training New and old hundred hryvnia The modern Museum of Money not only offers visitors an opportunity to view the valuable exhibits, but also raise the level of financial literacy among its visitors. Special trainings on savings, the protection of deposits, banknote security features are arranged for schoolchildren and students. These trainings are intended to provide a grasp of basic financial awareness. Training sessions end with interactive learning which offers visitors an opportunity to strike a coin using a manually operated a coin-minting press and a hammer, a minting technique similar to that used in the Middle Ages. Visitors are encouraged to pre-register for excursions online through the NBU‚Äôs website. The pre- registration procedure involves filling in an application form. The excursion schedule is compiled based on the submitted applications. The museum‚Äôs collection can be viewed online by taking a virtual tour, available on the NBU‚Äôs official website. The 3D virtual tour offers viewers an opportunity to explore all the showcases.

One-term incumbent Governor Ezenwo Nyesom Wike of the People's Democratic Party was eligible to run for re-election. He won in 2015 with 87.77% of the vote. Vote counting after the elections was suspended after widespread violence in the state. On April 3, the INEC declared that incumbent Wike won re-election, as the total number of voters in areas where elections were cancelled or did not hold was not enough to give his opponent victory. Background Ezenwo Nyesom Wike previously served as Minister of State for Education prior to becoming governor. He was also Chairman of the 2016 PDP National Convention Committee. Wike considered running for a second term as the state's chief executive, and 51 years old at the time of the election in 2019. There had been reports of a rift between members of the All Progressives Congress Dakuku Peterside and Ibim Semenitari. The state party chairman, Davies Ikanya has, however, denied this.

It was established and includes the Japanese Cemetery and grave of the Hon. John Douglas. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Thursday Island Cemetery was established , ten years after the formation of a permanent settlement on the island. It contains hundreds of graves, including between 600 and 700 Japanese (mostly pearl-shell divers), entrepreneurs and fortune hunters of all nationalities, Torres Strait pilots, sailors and ships' passengers drowned at sea, as well as generations of Thursday Islanders. The Hon. John Douglas, a former Premier of Queensland and long-term Government Resident on Thursday Island, is buried in the cemetery. Thursday Island (Indigenous name: Wai-ben) is located within the Prince of Wales (Muralag) group, just off the northwest tip of Cape York Peninsula. Although one of the smallest of the Torres Strait Islands, Thursday Island is the principal port and administrative centre for the district. It is also Queensland's and Australia's most northern town. The original inhabitants of the Muralag islands, the Kaurareg people, shared some cultural characteristics with Cape York Aborigines and spoke the same basic Australian language, Kalaw Lagaw Ya. However, they were a maritime people who lived from harvesting the sea, shifting camp sites regularly. Wai-ben (meaning 'the dry island') had no permanent water supply, and no permanent Kaurareg settlement was established there. During the first half of the 19th century British shipping began to make regular use of Torres Strait, entering into a passing trade with the Islanders. Colonial occupation commenced in the 1860s and 1870s with the arrival of beche-de-mer crews, pearl-shellers, Protestant missionaries from the southwestern Pacific, and government officials. Queensland had no jurisdiction over the Torres Strait until its annexation in 1872 of the islands of the southern half of the Strait, a measure intended largely to protect Queensland interests in the pearl-shelling and beche-de-mer fisheries in the Strait and along the Great Barrier Reef, and to regulate the employment of South Sea Islanders in these enterprises. At annexation, Torres Strait Islanders acquired the same official status as mainland Aborigines. The official Queensland Government settlement at Somerset on Cape York was established in 1864, but was moved in 1877 to the newly surveyed town of Port Kennedy on the southern side of Thursday Island. The new location provided a sheltered, deepwater anchorage, and was more centrally located along the main shipping route through the inner channel of Torres Strait - the principal trade route to Asia and the northern route to England. The first sale of crown land at Port Kennedy was held in April 1878. Although only sections 1-3 at the southwest end of the town (closest to the government buildings) were offered for sale, allotments in these sections were eagerly purchased by Queensland entrepreneurs. In 1879, at British Colonial Office direction, Queensland jurisdiction was extended to the islands of the northern half of the Torres Strait. This enabled Britain to secure the Torres Strait shipping channel without having to annex New Guinea. By 1884 Port Kennedy was the principal port for cargo and passengers being trans-shipped to Normanton, and was the hub of the pearl-shell and beche-de-mer fisheries in the Torres Strait. The town had a permanent population of about 70, and served a district of nearly 700 inhabitants. In addition, within from 3 to of Thursday Island pearl-shell and beche-de-mer fishing stations were employing about 1500 people of all races (including significant numbers of South Sea Islanders, Japanese and Filipinos). In late 1884, for example, about 100 Japanese divers were recorded at Thursday Island. At this period about 800 or 900 tons of shell were exported annually to New South Wales, Britain and other places, and the Queensland Government was collecting substantial revenue from licenses. A local census taken identified over 300 persons resident on Thursday Island, comprising \\"whites\\" (approximately 45%), Malays, Manilla, Chinese, Japanese, East Indian, Arabs, and \\"natives\\". Further successful sales of crown land at Port Kennedy were held in January 1885 and September 1888, and by 1890 the island's population had grown to 526, composed of Europeans, Chinese, Torres Strait Islanders and Aborigines, South Sea Islanders, Malays, Filipinos, Japanese, Singhalese, Indians, and a few Thais, Arabs and Africans. This ethnic and cultural mix characterised the communities of the Torres Strait prior to the Second World War. With the expansion of non-government settlement on Thursday Island, the provision of a public cemetery became a necessity. It has not been established where the earliest burials on the island took place, but the earliest section of the present Thursday Island Cemetery - 8 acres along Summers and Blackall Streets, on a high ridge in the centre of the island - had been identified as a suitable site for a cemetery by January 1887. It was proclaimed as a permanent cemetery reserve on 8 July 1887, and in September cemetery Trustees were appointed. The trustees were drawn from amongst the town's principal \\"white\\" entrepreneurs. By the time the cemetery reserve was officially surveyed in February or March 1888, several interments had taken place and a track off Summers Street into the cemetery had been established. The trustees employed the same surveyor to survey the cemetery into denominational and/or nationality divisions at this time, but no record of this survey is known to have survived. In February 1888 the Trustees formed regulations and by-laws for the effective operation of the cemetery, and in mid-1888 paid nearly ¬£100 for the construction of wire fencing on the reserve. By the end of 1889 a sign-board had been erected, and work had started on the formation of paths within the cemetery. During 1893, the Trustees had shade trees planted and further work on clearing and making cemetery paths was undertaken. The Trustees soon found that much of the reserve was unsuitable for burial purposes, being too steep and rocky, which escalated the cost of burials and made drainage of the site difficult. In the wet season, the cemetery paths became gullies, and had to be repaired on a yearly basis. In the mid-1890s, as the population of Thursday Island increased rapidly, the Trustees requested two extensions to the cemetery reserve. On 11 July 1894 the reserve was doubled in size to 16 acres, with the addition of a strip of land about half the width of the existing cemetery reserve, which extended north to the military track (now Aplin Road) along the foreshore. This included more level, less rocky land, and also provided access along the foreshore road to the hospital on Point Vivien, in the southwest corner of the island. The reserve was expanded yet again on 29 April 1896 to 26 acres 1 rood 4 perches, when the northern boundary of the eastern half of the reserve was also extended as far as the military road. These extensions encompassed the area now known as the Japanese (Divers') Cemetery, near Aplin Road. Japanese divers made a significant contribution to the development of the pearl-shell industry in the Torres Strait. Europeans who established the industry in the Strait in the late 1860s and early 1870s relied initially on South Sea Islander labour, who tended to dominate (often violently) the Torres Strait Islanders. In the 1870s boats equipped with helmeted apparatus for divers appeared, and in the 1880s the pearl-shellers turned to a more skilled, often more daring, and less confronting labour supply - Japanese divers (often ex-sailors) recruited principally from Hong Kong and Singapore. In the 1880s the proportion of Japanese divers in the Strait was no greater than any other ethnic group, but from 1891, when the Japanese Government removed its ban on emigration, numbers increased significantly. By 1893 the Japanese were the largest ethnic group in the Torres Strait pearl-shell industry, and completely dominated the industry between 1900 and 1940. By 1900 all the luggers built at Thursday Island were crafted by Japanese, and a \\"Japanese town\\", with boarding houses, a public bath, stores and a brothel, had been established at the eastern end of Port Kennedy. This was destroyed during the Second World War by American troops, who reputedly utilised the building materials for barracks. The pearl-shell industry came to a halt during the Second World War when Naval authorities requisitioned most of the luggers. After the war there was a brief resurgence of the industry, but pearl-shelling declined dramatically in the 1960s when competition from the booming post-war plastics industry usurped traditional uses for pearl-shell, such as buttons and knife handles. Pearl-shell diving was a hazardous occupation and fatalities were high. One source suggests over 1,000 divers lost their lives in Torres Strait to \\"the bends\\", from drowning or through shark attack. Thursday Island Cemetery contains between 600 and 700 graves bearing Japanese names. One authority records that most Japanese divers professed to be Anglicans, so that they could be buried at the Divers' Cemetery within the Thursday Island Cemetery. Certainly there was a strong Japanese presence within the Anglican community on Thursday Island. A Japanese school had been established by the Japanese community on the Anglican church precinct in Douglas Street by 1900, and the Japanese contributed to fund- raising for building the Church of England Parish Institute (1902‚Äì03) and various additions to the Quetta Memorial Cathedral Church in the 1890s and early 1900s. Japanese memorial adjacent to Japanese graves, 2001 In 1979, the Monument Building Committee of Japan erected a memorial/shrine in the Thursday Island Cemetery, to honour the hundreds of Japanese who worked, lived and died in the Torres Strait between 1878 and 1941. A resident of Japan established a trust of about $100,000 to ensure the future maintenance of the Japanese gravestones. With the expansion of the Torres Strait pearl-shell industry in the early years of the 20th century the town of Thursday Island (formerly Port Kennedy) also grew, and a further extension to the Thursday Island Cemetery was made on 9 January 1913, with the addition of about 5 acres of mostly flat, less rocky land along Aplin Road to the west, bringing the area of the reserve to 31 acres 2 roods 9 perches. This remains the current extent of the Thursday Island Cemetery reserve (12.77 hectares). The extension was intended to accommodate mostly \\"pagan\\" burials, which constituted a large proportion of burials in the Thursday Island Cemetery at this period. (Prior to 1973, all non-Christian interments were recorded as \\"pagan\\", despite the large number of other religions represented on the island including Shinto, Buddhism and Islam.) From 1912 until after the Second World War, Torres Strait Islanders were prohibited from residing on Thursday Island, which accounts for the smaller proportion of Islander graves of this period in Thursday Island Cemetery. One of the more significant graves in the cemetery is that of the Hon. John Douglas, CMG, (1828-1904), pastoralist, Liberal politician 1863-1879 (serving as Premier of Queensland 1877-79), and administrator (Government Resident on Thursday Island 1885-86 and 1888-1904), who died on the island on 23 July 1904. He was deeply involved in developing the settlement on Thursday Island. He was an active warden in the Church of England and on 24 May 1893 laid the foundation stone of the Quetta Memorial Church. He served on various local committees, and was a Cemetery Trustee from 1889 until his death. He won the respect of the Torres Strait Islanders, who in the early 1900s funded construction of the west aisle of the Quetta Memorial Cathedral Church, dedicated in 1913 as the Douglas Memorial Chapel. Although Thursday Island Cemetery contains hundreds of burials, the earliest of which date to at least 1887, there is no surviving record of interments prior to 1939. The Register of Interments held by Torres Shire Council starts on 31 March 1939. There are no entries between 22 July 1940 and 11 February 1948. Most Thursday Island civilians were evacuated in 1942 and did not return until 1946 or later. Thursday Island was administered by military authorities during 1942-45, and from mid-1946 to February 1948, Thursday Island Cemetery was managed by the local stipendiary magistrate. When local trustees were re-appointed early in 1948, they found that the cemetery was in poor repair, no maintenance having been carried out since 1940, and claimed ¬£315 from the War Damage Commission to effect necessary repairs. They also discovered that the Minute Book, Cash Book and Cemetery Register to 1939, which in 1942 had been left on the island in a locked safe, were missing. It took the Trustees some years, but by 1952 they reported that the cemetery was in good order, with fences, gates and roads repaired. The greatest difficulty was in securing grave-diggers. In the early 1960s the Trustees attempted to persuade the Thursday Island Town Council to take on the management of the cemetery, but eventually, Queensland Government officials and local priests took on the role of trustees. Despite the establishment of municipal government on Thursday Island as early as 1912, the cemetery remained the responsibility of community trustees for over a century. In 1991 Torres Shire Council assumed control of the reserve and new by-laws were gazetted. The cemetery contains the Commonwealth war graves of four service personnel, two Royal Australian Navy sailors of World War I (in Church of England sections) and two Australian Army soldiers of World War II who are buried in adjacent graves (Nos. 1528 and 1529, Presbyterian Plot).  Description  Thursday Island Cemetery is a 12.77 hectare reserve located on the central northern side of the island, bounded on the south by Summers Street, from where the land slopes north/northwest down to Aplin Road. A track winds down a gully from Summers Street to Aplin Road, providing access to graves on either side. The main entrance is now from Aplin Road. The terrain varies from steeply sloping in the southern section to flat in the northern section. The ground consists of clay and granite, and the surface is extremely rocky. Vegetation is predominantly indigenous, with Eucalypts and other native trees providing light tree coverage throughout the reserve, most densely along the eastern ridge. Native grasses provide a dense ground cover over most of the reserve, restricting access to the graves, particularly during the wet season, when the grass is long. In addition, some areas on the western side of the track are overgrown with bean tree (Leucaena sp.), which prevents access at any time of the year. The newer sections of the cemetery have a few specimen trees and shrubs such as frangipani (Plumeria rubra), Hibiscus (Hibiscus sinensis) and Crotons (Codiaeum variegatum). The grave furnishings in the cemetery are diverse in design and materials - the latter including timber, polished granite, marble, sandstone, early cast iron, and later concrete and tiles. The variety of materials used in grave marking reflect social attitudes to death, the availability of materials, cultural and religious backgrounds, and the changing socio-economic conditions of local residents. Early headstones in the cemetery were imported from well known monumental masons in southern centres, mostly from Melrose and Fenwick (Townsville), but also from firms such as John Petrie and J Clements of Brisbane. Designs include columns, obelisks, desks and upright slabs, generally with the more elaborate decoration found on early Catholic graves. There is also a range of Christian cross designs. Some of the earlier graves have iron railing grave surrounds, or evidence of where this was used. The majority of graves, both marked and unmarked, retain their numeric metal cemetery markers. Most of the early graves face east, as is traditional in European burial grounds. However, graves in the Japanese pearl-divers' section and most of the more recent graves, tend to face west. More recent graves have elaborate decorative tiling on a concrete base, and are extremely colourful. Placing a permanent photograph of the deceased on the headstone is also very popular. These graves are illustrative of a genre of grave marking which has emerged from the unique ethnic and cultural mix to which the Torres Strait islands have been subject since the 1870s. Although most Islanders are Christians, they have incorporated what is believed to be a traditional (pre-1870s) mortuary rite, the tomb-opening ceremony, within their current religious practices. This ceremony occurs 12 months or more after a burial, at which time the grave markings are installed. Throughout the year there is evidence of tombstone openings in the form of decorations remaining after opening, tombstones wrapped and covered awaiting opening, or newer graves with wooden roofing constructed over them awaiting opening. Early graves appear to be grouped according to religion or ethnicity, but a clear picture of the original cemetery layout is not possible. Little early documentation survives, parts of the site are inaccessible, and much of the remainder is so overgrown that the identification of graves, iron markers and headstones is difficult. A conservation plan for the Thursday Island Cemetery, completed in May 2000, identified 21 distinct groupings of graves (Areas A-T), but there were sections of the reserve which were inaccessible at time of survey, and unable to be recorded. From what can be discerned, the original layout of Thursday Island Cemetery reflects the social structure and hierarchical patterns established on Thursday Island in the late 19th century, with the most influential social groups located at the top of the hill near Summers Street, and the least influential located near Aplin Road on the flats. Grave of John Douglas, 2001 The southern and highest end of the cemetery was the earliest section of the reserve to be established. On this section, at the top of the hill adjacent to Summers Street and overlooking Ellis Channel (Area L), are the graves of some of Thursday Island's early European \\"elite\\", including the Hon. John Douglas, Premier of Queensland 1877-79 and long-term Government Resident on Thursday Island 1885-86 and 1888-1904, who died on the island in 1904. His grave is marked by a tall obelisk in polished blue granite. All the graves in this area face east. On the southern and western slopes of this hill, closer to Summers Street, is the original Protestant section (most likely mainly Anglican), which includes the earliest metal cemetery plot marker (Area M). There were burials in this section from at least 1887, and the earliest marked graves date to the late 1800s and early 1900s. Also in this section of the cemetery is an early monument to seven pilots in the Queensland Pilot Service who died in the Strait between 1894 and 1917. Some of the graves on the western slope of this hill face west, and those on the southern slope mostly face south. The conservation plan records evidence of a track leading west around the hill and providing access to graves in the area, which is now overgrown and inaccessible. The early Catholic burial ground is located a little further down the hill, to the west of the cemetery track, in the steep southwest section of the cemetery (Area N). Graves here face east. Most have concrete grave surrounds, and many also have metal railings embedded in the concrete. Most have marble headstones, crosses or cairns. Much of this section is overgrown and access is difficult, but at the crest of the hill are the graves of at least three Catholic nuns, and these appear to have been specially maintained. A marble memorial to William Conroy, a Senior Constable of Police who died in the line of duty in 1895, has also been maintained. Two of the most prominent and decorative of the Catholic headstones are those marking the graves of Thomas and Ellen McNulty, who established the Thursday Island Hotel in 1879, and who were important in the establishment of the Catholic Church on Thursday Island in the 1880s. On the steep slopes east of the cemetery access track, still in the southern part of the reserve but north of the Protestant section near Summers Street, are a large number of overgrown graves, mostly of Japanese origin (Area K). Some have granite cairns engraved with Japanese lettering. Still on the eastern side of track, but further toward the centre of the cemetery and closer to the track, are the graves of Muslim Indonesians and Malays, and some Torres Strait Islanders (Areas I-J). These are on relatively flat land and are generally well maintained. Wherever Muslim or Shinto burials have taken place, there are likely to be offerings of food and toys. Graves in the central section of the cemetery, on flatter but still elevated and sloping land, and on both sides of the access road, are predominantly Christian, both European and Islander (Areas E-G, O-Q). There are no immediately discernible denominational divisions, but family groupings are evident. Area P is inaccessible due to an infestation at bean tree (Leucaena sp.). Area H, adjacent to the Christian graves on the eastern side of the access track in the central part of the cemetery, contains a small grouping of graves which appear to be of Islamic origin. Two early graves in this section face east. Closer to the northern end of the cemetery reserve, on gently sloping land east of the access track, is a section of mainly early 1900s European graves (Area D). The denomination is not evident. Two substantial stone cairns have been built here in memory of two servicemen. These have concrete grave surrounds with artillery shells standing at each corner. The majority of graves in this section retain their metal cemetery marker. North of this area, still on the eastern side of the track, is a section of older European graves mixed with later mostly Islander graves (Area C). All graves face west. The graves in the southern and eastern sections of this area are inaccessible due to an infestation of bean tree (Leucaena sp.) To the north of Area C is a grouping of more recent, mostly Torres Strait Islander Christian graves. This area is very well maintained. At the northeast end of the reserve, on the flat land beside Aplin Road, is the Japanese pearl- shell divers' burial ground (Area A). This area is reasonably well maintained. Most of the graves in this section have raised mounds covered with stone, concrete, or a combination of both. Many are marked with granite or concrete columns, usually consisting of three sections, and a few have European-style marble and concrete headstones. Graves without such markers are marked either with wooden posts painted white with Japanese characters lettered in black; or with unpainted timber posts with engraved inscriptions of Japanese characters. A few graves remain as mounds but are otherwise unmarked. On some of the Japanese graves are small concrete birdcages, housing food for the spirits of the departed divers, and on some graves, frangipani (Plumeria rubra) have been planted. The majority of graves in this area contain a metal cemetery grave marker. To the northwest are the graves of mainly Torres Strait Islanders (Areas R-T). The most recent graves are located here, in Area B and in some of the central sections of the reserve, and generally are well maintained. However, there is a dense infestation of bean tree (Leucaena sp.) in Area S, on the western side of the access track.  Heritage listing  Thursday Island Cemetery (incorporating the Japanese Cemetery & the Grave of the Hon. John Douglas) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Thursday Island Cemetery, established and still open for interments, is important in illustrating the rich diversity of culture and custom on Thursday Island and in the Torres Strait in general, which is one of the most ethnically diverse parts of Queensland. The cemetery contains the graves of hundreds of people from many nationalities, cultures and religious backgrounds (including Christianity, Buddhism, Shinto and Islam). The large Japanese (Divers') Cemetery within the reserve is illustrative the role of the Japanese in the development of the pearl-shell industry in the Torres Strait, the dangerous nature of this work, and the close cultural and economic connections which the people of the Torres Strait have had with the sea and maritime industries. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Thursday Island Cemetery is significant as a unique historical record, illustrating important aspects of the island's history including its pearling industry, the First and Second World Wars, its social structure from the late 19th century, and attitudes towards religion and burial practices. The names on the headstones in the cemetery illustrate the high degree of ethnic intermarriage in the Strait since the 1870s. The degree of cultural diversity and the existence of a substantial and early Japanese Cemetery within the reserve is rare in Queensland. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The place has potential to reveal further information about the history of this most northern part of Queensland, and of late 19th century cemetery layouts, particularly if the ground cover were cleared to reveal the full extent and diversity of burials and burial customs. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place has strong aesthetic appeal, engendered by the variety and detail of the headstones and other grave markers which range from the 1880s to the present day (contemporary Islander graves are particularly colourful and dynamic), and the romantic island setting, with views to the water from most parts of the reserve. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place is highly valued by the community of Thursday Island and by those outside of the community who have relatives buried in the cemetery. It is also a popular tourist destination. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The place is significant as the resting place of a former Queensland Premier and Government Resident of Thursday Island, the Hon. John Douglas (1828-1904), whose grave is located at the top of the highest hill in the cemetery, overlooking Ellis Channel and the islands of the southern Torres Strait. The cemetery contains a number of other significant memorials, including a large monument to the Japanese, and an early memorial to Torres Strait pilots who lost their lives in the execution of their duties.

Wei also sampled different battle music from the game series and included them into the song. Since he was young, Wei has been an avid player of Xuan-Yuan Sword series. When Wei knew he had the opportunity to write the theme song for the game, he was extremely excited. The song is believed to be written from the perspective of Yuwen Tuo, a major character from the game. Lyrically, the song discusses that there are no heroes or villains in troubled times. In order for there to be peace, bloodshed is often inevitable. Music video The music video was directed by Howard Kuo and Allan Shen.

He worked for Esquire, Look, Life, Glamour, Town and Country and The New York Times Magazine, before shooting extensively for Harper‚Äôs Bazaar. Eileen Ford, founder of Ford Models agency, described him as an ‚Äúearly visionary on a path that others were to follow‚Äù.  Early life and education  Gleb Derujinsky was born in New York City in 1925, and named after his father Gleb W. Derujinsky, an immigrant of Russian nobility who became a successful sculptor. The Derujinsky family served the Russian tsars as far back as Peter the Great, and relatives include the composer Nikolai Rimsky- Korsakov and the painter Mikhail Vrubel. Derujinsky‚Äôs mother, the classical pianist Alexandra Micholoff Derujinsky, died in the late 1950s. Derujinsky‚Äôs first languages were Russian and French, and he went on to learn English while enrolled at the Trinity School in New York. In 1942, Derujinsky became a corporal in the army and stayed until after the end of World War II. His language abilities and negotiation skills contributed to his being promoted to Staff Sergeant halfway through his tours, and learned Morse Code in just 30 days.  Career  Upon his return to New York City, he opened his first photography studio with his veteran loan. By February 1948, he landed his first cover with Collier‚Äôs magazine. Shortly thereafter, he began working for Harper‚Äôs Bazaar Jr., an offshoot of Harper‚Äôs Bazaar aimed towards college-age women that became a supplement of Harper‚Äôs Bazaar. Derujinsky was retained as a freelance photographer, working alongside Richard Avedon, Lillian Bassman, and Louise Dahl-Wolfe for editors Carmel Snow and Diana Vreeland and art director Alexey Brodovitch. Citing the great photographer Horst P. Horst as a key influence, Derujinsky photographed the Paris Spring collections from 1953-1963 and was known for his outlandish ideas and travel images taken in remote locations all over the world at time when travel, especially by air, was far from common. Derujinsky also freelanced for Look Magazine, Town and Country, The New York Times Magazine, Ladies‚Äô Home Journal, Esquire, Glamour, Seventeen, Life, and Good Housekeeping. Working extensively with Carmen Dell‚ÄôOrefice and his then-wife Ruth Neumann-Derujinsky, his work also featured many of the era‚Äôs top models, from Jean Patchett and Jean Shrimpton, to Nena Von Schlebr√ºgge and Iris Bianchi. In 1957, to commemorate the inauguration of Pan Am‚Äôs Boeing 707, Derujinsky, dubbed ‚Äúthe White Russian,‚Äù travelled around the world with Ruth Neumann and Nena Von Schlebr√ºgge, photographing the former in 11 countries in the space of 28 days. His photographs of the Paris collections of the same year became a 25-page spread in Harper‚Äôs Bazaar. In 1968 he began shooting television commercials for Union Carbide, Dolly Madison, Johnson & Johnson, Texas Instruments, and Revlon, going on to win several awards at Cannes and Venice.  Personal life and death  Derujinsky married four models in his lifetime and had Andrea Derujinsky with his third wife and cover girl Ruth Neumann. In 1972, a few years after his divorce from Ruth Neumann, he married Wallis Fairfax Gault with whom he remained for 42 years until their deaths in 2011 in a car accident in Durango, Colorado, where they had lived for nearly 30 years. In Durango, Derujinsky opened a jewelry studio, One of a Kind, making and designing his own pieces. He turned his love of skiing into a career when he qualified as an instructor in nearby Purgatory, and taught in the children‚Äôs division for over a decade. He earned an instructor‚Äôs license as a glider pilot and was instrumental in starting the Durango Soaring Club at La Plata airport, now known as Animas Air Park. Other achievements later in life include building a carbon fiber bicycle, whose patented design was one of first to be used in an air tunnel test, as well as being used at the 1984 Olympic trials in Los Angeles.

Voikovskaya station is named for Pyotr Voykov, a Soviet revolutionary who was involved in the murder of the Tsar's family in 1917. The controversy over the name led to an effort to rename the Voykovskaya Metro station that was ultimately unsuccessful after a public survey. Despite this, the concern over naming a new station after Voykov remained. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin indicated in 2016 that the decision on the station was still an open question and that the issue would be put to citizens via a separate survey. A survey conducted by the city in July 2016 only showed support for the name Voykovskaya at 19% out of over 173,000 responses.

It was built from to . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 December 1998.  History  Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Church at Thursday Island was erected by French and Italian priests of the Mission of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, who had arrived on the island in October 1884. On Thursday Island they established the first Catholic mission in the Torres Strait, erecting there a small church . If this is the existing church (which is not substantiated), it is the oldest surviving building on Thursday Island. Photographic evidence suggests that by , the church had acquired its present form and concrete footings. Queensland had no jurisdiction over the islands of the Torres Strait until annexing them in 1872, largely to protect Queensland interests in the pearl-shelling and beche-de-mer fisheries in the Strait, and to regulate the employment of South Sea Islanders in these enterprises. With annexation, Torres Strait Islanders acquired the same status as mainland Aborigines, and the official Queensland Government settlement at Somerset on Cape York Peninsula (established 1864) was moved in 1877 to Port Kennedy at Thursday Island. The new location provided a sheltered, deepwater anchorage, and was more centrally located along the main shipping route through the inner channel of Torres Strait ‚Äì the principal trade route to Asia and the northern route to England. The island was known to the Kaurareg, a maritime people who inhabited the off-shore islands near Cape York, as Wai-ben. By early 1884 Port Kennedy had emerged as the principal port for cargo and passengers being trans-shipped to Normanton, and was the hub of the pearl-shell and beche-de- mer fisheries in the Torres Strait. The permanent population was about 70, and it serviced a district of nearly 700 inhabitants. In addition, within from of Thursday Island pearl-shell and beche-de-mer fishing stations were employing about 1500 people of all races (including significant numbers of South Sea Islanders, Japanese and Filipinos). At this period about 800 or of shell were exported annually to New South Wales, Britain and other places, and the Queensland Government was collecting substantial revenue from licenses. The Mission of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart had been founded in France by Fr Louis Andre Navarre, Dean of Bourges, in the 1860s, and was approved of as a religious congregation by the Holy See in 1869. In March 1881 Pope Leo XIII requested that the Sacred Heart Fathers establish a mission in New Guinea, within the Vicariate Apostolic of Melanesia and Micronesia. Like the protestant evangelists who had arrived in the Torres Strait in the early 1870s, the Sacred Heart Fathers decided to facilitate their entry into New Guinea by establishing a mission in Torres Strait, to serve as a stop-over station and link between the Society's missions on the Australian mainland and their proposed mission in New Guinea. On 24 October 1884 the first three Sacred Heart missionaries ‚Äì Fr Louis Andre Navarre, Fr Ferdinand Hartzer, and Br Giuseppe de Santis ‚Äì arrived at Thursday Island, soon to be joined by two more fathers and three young Italian brothers. Initially, Sunday Mass was held at McNulty's Hotel (later the Federal Hotel), the congregation comprising mostly Filipino pearl-shell fishers (Manila Men). At Christmas the Filipinos came in the hundreds to attend Mass and seek confession. In January 1885 Frs Navarre and Hartzer purchased allotment 4 of section 4 () in Port Kennedy for , at the first sale of crown land on Thursday Island. By February 1886 they had erected a small church and a dwelling house. By December 1886, Our Lady of the Sacred Heart mission at Thursday Island comprised three buildings, all constructed by the Italian brothers: a small, unpretentious iron church, some little distance up the hill, to one side of this a small convent accommodating four religious sisters, and to the other side a presbytery which also served as a sanatorium for fever-stricken and debilitated priests from New Guinea and other islands. It is not clear whether the church is the existing church. From 1884 to 1889 Our Lady of the Sacred Heart mission at Thursday Island was the point of departure for all the Catholic missions ‚Äì French, German, Swiss and other nationalities ‚Äì in British New Guinea and New Britain. After 1889 the German Missionaries went directly to New Britain but the French continued to stop over at Thursday Island before going to their New Guinea mission headquarters at Yule Island. Later they went via Port Moresby. The first Sisters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart arrived at Thursday Island in January 1886 and a year later opened a small school on the verandah of the convent. Not until was a purpose-designed schoolhouse erected. In the late 1880s the Sisters also established Thursday Island's first and only hospital, until a government hospital was constructed . In 1889 the Sacred Heart missionaries also erected St Henry's Roman Catholic Asylum, a charitable institution conducted by the Sacred Heart Sisters, who offered board and education to children of every race and denomination within the Vicariates of New Guinea and New Britain. This was closed in 1942, reopened briefly in 1948, and in 1961-62 was converted to house Our Lady of the Sacred Heart School, the school building being abandoned. In 1973 a new Sacred Heart school was constructed. In 1889 the Vicariate Apostolic of Melanesia and Micronesia was divided into the Vicariates of British New Guinea (later Papua), New Britain and Gilbert Islands. Thursday Island was placed under the Vicariate Apostolic of British New Guinea, Fr Louis Andre Navarre being appointed the first Vicar Apostolic and consecrated Bishop. Archbishop Navarre devoted the remainder of his life to his work in the Vicariate Apostolic of British New Guinea. Owing to age and ill health he resigned his position in 1908, Father Alain Guynot de Boismenu succeeding him. By the time of his death in January 1912 (at Townsville, en route south from New Guinea) the New Guinea Mission of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart was served by 25 missionaries, 21 lay brothers, and 38 sisters; they had opened 38 schools and two orphanages; 28 stations had been established, each provided with churches, schools and residences; and from the central station on Yule Island, 78 villages were regularly visited and instructed. The work of the Sacred Heart missionaries on Thursday Island was expanded in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1927 Father J Doyle was appointed Parish Priest on Thursday Island. He obtained permission from the Queensland Department of Native Affairs to establish a mission on Hammond Island (then without a resident population) to service the pearl-shell divers and their families in the area, and this was opened in 1929. In 1935 a mission church was erected on Naghir Island, about from Thursday Island, but this had been demolished by white ants by the early 1940s. In 1935 David Sing, born at Thursday Island in 1911, painted the trompe l'oeil murals on the rear wall of the sanctuary of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Church, and on the front of the altar. David became a lay missionary at the age of 17, and painted religious works in Catholic churches at Thursday Island, Port Moresby and Tully. (The Tully work, a painting on canvas hung behind the altar, no longer survives.) He studied with JS Watkins in Sydney, and was early influenced by the French Impressionist School, before entering the Trappist Order in the United States, where he studied at the Chicago Art Institute. About 1949 he entered the Carthusian Order in Italy ‚Äì the first Australian to be ordained into the Order ‚Äì and studied art in Paris and Rome. His paintings proved an important source of income for the Carthusians, and were collected by persons as prominent as Jaqueline Onassis and Patricia Nixon. In the late 1970s, during a 3-year visit to Australia, he painted portraits of a number of prominent Australians, including author Xavier Herbert and thalidomide researcher Dr William G McBride (both these portraits were entered in the Archibald Prize competition of 1977). Sing also held an exhibition of landscapes, still-life, and portraits in Sydney in 1978. In 1938 the Sacred Heart Mission in the Torres Strait was transferred from the Vicariate Apostolic of Papua (formerly British New Guinea) to the Diocese of Darwin, becoming a Mission of the Australian Province. It remained within the Diocese of Darwin until transferred to the Diocese of Cairns in 1967, after which the parish was no longer staffed by Sacred Heart priests but by Cairns Diocesan clergy. Since 1968, Sacred Heart school on Thursday Island has been run by Sisters of Mercy from Cairns. With the transfer to the Cairns Diocese in 1967, Weipa and Bamaga on Cape York Peninsula were annexed to the Thursday Island Mission, although Bamaga had been serviced from Thursday Island for some years prior to this. In 1982 Weipa separated from Thursday Island parish, which currently comprises the missions at Thursday Island (Waibene), Hammond Island (Kiriri), Horn Island (Nurupai), and Bamaga. In 1983 the flat-iron spire of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Church on Thursday Island was replaced with a fibreglass copy as the first phase of a centenary renovations programme. The roof was reclad in 1992.  Description  Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Church, circa 1905 Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Church is a substantial timber building with a gabled roof clad with galvanised iron, and concrete foundations. It is sited prominently in Douglas Street on the slope leading up to the east-west ridge which runs the length of the island, and from the water approach is a conspicuous element in the Thursday Island townscape. It sits within a precinct which includes the Catholic presbytery, Our Lady of the Sacred Heart convent and school, and teacher's residence. The building is rectangular in shape (no transepts) with a small front porch and side verandahs, and rear vestry. The timber frame is lined with single-skin chamferboards on the side walls, but the front wall, which is exposed to the weather, has an exterior weatherboard cladding. The vestry has been clad externally with fibrous-cement sheeting. The church is raised above the ground on concrete piers, and the undercroft is enclosed with concrete walling. The front elevation faces south-east, and is distinguished by a fibreglass spire ‚Äì a copy of the original. The centrally located front door, the windows either side of the door, and the window in the gable infill, all have Gothic arches. Similarly shaped windows are located along each side wall. All the windows are multi-paned and have bright red and blue glass in the arch infill, and the windows and french doors nearest the sanctuary also have large panels of green glass. One of the front windows has panes of bright yellow glass. The grounds are terraced with rubble stone retaining walls. Four flights of concrete steps lead from the lower terrace to the upper terrace and up to the front door of the church. Internally, the building comprises one large rectangular space divided into nave and sanctuary, with chamferboard ceiling and walls. At the rear of the nave above the front entrance is a choir loft, accessed from a staircase in the southern corner. The choir loft has a decorative cast-iron railing and fine timber work. A painted timber confessional is located at the rear of the nave, to the right of the main entrance. On either side of the nave, close to the sanctuary, is a set of french doors opening onto the side verandahs. The ceiling is lined with chamferboards. The floors are of timber, that of the sanctuary being raised about above the floor of the nave, and accessed by two steps running the width of the floor. The railing which once separated sanctuary from nave has been removed. The sanctuary has a fine carved timber altar. The whole of the rear wall of the sanctuary is lined with sheeting and has a painted trompe l'oeil mural painted in 1935. There is similar trompe l'oeil work on the front of the altar. Above the altar in the rear wall is a circular window with painted glass. Two doors in the rear wall, one either side of the altar, lead to the vestry at the rear.  Heritage listing  Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 December 1998 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Church at Thursday Island, erected in the late 19th century, survives as important evidence of early European missionary activity in the Torres Strait. It also offers important evidence of the development of the island as the hub of the Torres Strait and gateway to New Guinea in the late 19th century. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The place has potential to reveal valuable information about the early work of Thursday Island-born artist, David Sing, who achieved international status with his traditionalist oil paintings. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building remains substantially intact and is a good example of a late 19th century timber church with decorative Gothic elements and (less commonly) side verandahs. It retains many early fittings and fixtures, including the choir loft, pews, altar, decorative fretwork, the 1930s painted trompe l'oeil murals on the sanctuary wall and altar, and statuary which integrates with the wall mural to re-inforce the three- dimensional effect. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The exterior with its decorative verandahs, porch and spire is aesthetically pleasing, and the place is a prominent landmark in the Thursday Island townscape. The place has a strong and special religious significance with a mainly islander community for cultural and spiritual reasons. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has a strong and special religious significance with a mainly islander community for cultural and spiritual reasons. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It has a close association with the work in the Torres Strait and New Guinea of the Order of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, a Catholic congregation founded in France in the 1860s, and in particular with their founder, Fr Louis Andre Navarre; and with the early work of artist David Sing.

His father was a classicist and kept a school in Edinburgh; he was brought up at home with his first cousin, Alice Gaunter, who married James R. Jackson. MacColl entered Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1862, but migrated next year to Downing College, and was elected a scholar there in 1865. His coach Richard Shilleto encouraged outside reading, and he took a second class in the classical tripos of 1866. He was in 1869 elected a fellow of Downing, having won the Hare Prize in 1868.

MacColl ventured into society comparatively little, but occasionally visited Westland Marston's Sunday parties. He went in later life to the Athen√¶um Club, was one of Leslie Stephen's \\"Sunday Tramps\\", and played golf. He travelled on the Continent in his vacations, making one Spanish tour.

In 1838 he co-founded the Paris Medical Society and served as its first Vice President. He won the Medical Society of London‚Äôs Fothergill Gold Medal in 1846 for his lecture \\"On the Pathology and Treatment of Scrofula\\". Some 5 years prior to James Young Simpson‚Äôs use of chloroform on human patients in 1842 Glover discovered its anaesthetic qualities on laboratory animals.http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/anaesthesia59_394_400_2004.pdf He is sometimes called \\"the true discoverer of chloroform\\". In an ironic twist of fate he died from a chloroform overdose. Life He was born in South Shields on 2 November 1815 to Catherine and William Glover, a merchant. In 1829 he was apprenticed to Thomas J. Aitken TRCSE of 31 Nicolson Street in Edinburgh.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1829-30 He began studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh the following year, and was clerked to Prof James Syme at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. In 1834 he travelled to Geneva in Switzerland to study under Prof Lombard. In 1835 he was elected a member of the Medical Society of Edinburgh. In 1837 he received his licence to practice medicine and travelled to Paris, founding the Paris Medical Society the following year and serving as its first Vice President. He returned briefly to Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1839 before again heading to Edinburgh in 1840. This was to defend his thesis \\"On the Physiological and Medical Properties of Bromine and its Compounds\\" from which he then received his doctorate (MD). He then returned to Newcastle to stay with his brother William Glover who was also a doctor, operating from 12 Northumberland Street. He joined the Newcastle School of Medicine and Practical Sciences, serving as Chairman of the Department of Chemistry and Head of the Department of Materia Medica and Therapeutics. In 1842 he won the Gold Medal of the Harveian Society for his thesis on the properties of chloroform and bromine, including the first description of the anaesthetic effects of chloroform (injected into the neck of a dog). The paper acknowledged the potential effects upon the heart (including potential death). He omitted to spot its potential use during surgery. Glover later wrote to James Young Simpson, decrying Simpson's failure to credit his own contributions. Simpson answered that he did not follow \\"animal experiments\\". However, as Simpson was one of the university assessors of Glover's thesis (which contained the same theories) this claim seems a little hollow. Simpson should have read his thesis even if he claimed he had not. Simpson's use on humans is generally described as \\"the first\\" and this is technically correct, if perhaps obfuscating other factors. It equally belittles the contribution of Simpson's dentist neighbour, Francis Brodie Imlach, who used chloroform in clinical conditions to extract a tooth (perhaps its safest use) on 11 November 1847, and equally deserves more recognition.Dental History Magazine: Vol 2 Issue 1 p.14 Glover's findings were confirmed by Dr Robert Halliday Gunning in May 1848, also disproving Simpson's theories on the reasons for the effects of chloroform.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/research_awards/prizes/prize_lists/gunning_victoria_history.pdf In 1848 Glover assisted Prof John Fife at Newcastle Infirmary in the autopsy of 15 year old Hannah Greener, who had died under the effects of chloroform whilst having an infected toenail removed. She was the first human death from chloroform.http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/anaesthesia59_394_400_2004.pdfBlessed Days of Anaesthesia by Stephanie Snow 2009 In 1850 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Sir Robert Christison. In the summer of 1851 the Newcastle School of Medicine was dissolved following various arguments over rent owed to the North Eastern Railway Company and moves to be absorbed by Durham University. Glover and Dawson set up a new school, whilst the majority of teachers ran a rival school under the umbrella of Durham University. The two factions reunited in 1857 after Glover had left Newcastle. Late in 1854 he appears at the Royal Free Hospital in London under the name of Mortimer Glover, living at 2 Tavistock Place off Russell Square. Here he worked with Frederick James Gant and Thomas Wakley. He was reprimanded for failure to receive his London licence to practice (LRCP) and being slack in clinical duties. He asked for a leave of absence in April 1855. Together with Gant he volunteered to join the medical staff in the Crimea, also attracted by the very large stipend of ¬£1500 per annum. On 25 April 1855 they sailed on HMS Candia reaching Scutari on 26 May 1855. Gant and Glover were amongst the five civilian surgeons working at the Barracks at Scutari. Glover caught dysentery here and began taking doses of opium and chloroform to deal with this. Civil surgeons and military surgeons did not mix well and the civil surgeons were dispensed of prior to the end of the war. Gant and Glover left in January 1856 having been of little practical purpose. Gant returned to the Royal Free Hospital but Glover did not, neither did he resign. His name disappears from their records in 1856. In July 1856 he at last passed his LRCP. His health deteriorated after his time serving in the Crimean War at which point he became addicted to both opium and chloroform. Destitute and unable to work, he took lodgings with a Mr Walter Rochfort a pharmacist, at 1 Kensington Park Gardens in Notting Hill, London. Sadly Glover died from an overdose of chloroform at 1 Kensington Park Road in London, taken on 9 April 1859. His friend Frederick James Gant and Mt Rochfort were with him when he died the following day, 10 April. Setting aside Horace Wells‚Äô chloroform- assisted suicide, he was the first professional to die purely from the use (or abuse) of chloroform.http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/anaesthesia59_394_400_2004.pdf His friend Gant performed an autopsy on 11 April, a horrible task on a friend. He found 4 pints (2 litres) of bloody mucus in his guts, smelling of chloroform. He was estimated to have taken a liquid dose of 2 to 5 ounces of pure chloroform (60-150ml). His enlarged liver indicated long-term abuse predating Crimea.http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/anaesthesia59_394_400_2004.pdf Thomas Wakley oversaw the inquest of his death, acting both as a former friend and coroner of Middlesex at the time. He was also editor of The Lancet at the time. His brother William Glover attended as did Gant, Hopton and a J. Millar. A verdict of \\"accidental death by excessive use of chloroform taken as a sedative\\" was found, it being concluded not as a deliberate suicide. He was buried in Hanwell Cemetery in an unmarked grave on 14 April 1859.

This was Britain's largest mental asylum, and she had been there for seven years for \\"violent and dangerous behaviour\\". She was also from Newcastle and they had met through her friend Rochfort. As she was described as \\"lunatic as himself\\" (himself meaning Glover) this attests to Glover's mental state in his final months. They honeymooned for a week at a hotel at 30 Charles Street in Westminster before she was recaptured and escorted back to Colney Hatch.

Wetlands are ubiquitous and they may briefly be defined as transitional spaces between land and water. In a more detailed sense, according to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, wetlands are defined as: :\\"areas of marsh, fen, peat land or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres [‚Ä¶..] and may incorporate riparian and coastal zones adjacent to the wetlands, and islands or bodies of marine water deeper than six metres at low tide lying within the wetlands\\". The Ramsar Classification of wetland types includes 42 types which can be broadly divided into: * Marine and coastal wetlands * Inland wetlands * Human-made wetlands Among the richest ecosystems in the world, wetlands have an exceptional value, but are also the most threatened. In the Mediterranean, they support high concentrations of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrate species that cannot be found anywhere else in the world. Key figures on biodiversity in Med region Furthermore, these ecosystems insure directly ‚Äì and for free ‚Äì services for millions of people. As natural infrastructures, they play a number of roles in the environment, principally water purification, flood control, carbon sink and shoreline stability. Unfortunately, wetlands continue to be among the world's most threatened ecosystems; 50% of the Mediterranean wetlands disappeared during the 20th century, and those that remain have been degraded or artificialized. There are 15 to 22 million hectares of wetlands in the Mediterranean Region, a fourth of which are artificial, such as dam reservoirs and fish-farming ponds.Mediterranean Wetlands Outlook 2012 The Mediterranean region is also a hotspot of global biodiversity, but the greatest direct threat to that biodiversity is the disappearance of these ecosystems. Plants and animals combined, one out of three Mediterranean wetland species is endangered.First thematic report - Biodiversity: status and trends of species in Mediterranean wetlands A scientific survey of 314 Mediterranean coastal wetlands shows that human activities, such as agriculture, have converted 71% of Mediterranean natural coastal wetland habitat into farmland, 21% by artificialization, and 8% by urban expansion.Second thematic report: Land cover spatial dynamics in Mediterranean coastal wetlands from 1975 to 2005. One of the greatest threats to the Mediterranean wetlands is water extraction. Irrigated agriculture is the greatest water consumer in the region, accounting for 2/3 of total consumption. Rivers flow rates are falling due to water extraction, retention by dams, and the effects of climate change. Types of Mediterranean Wetlands Wetlands lie at the interface between land and water, and are thus very diverse. The Ramsar Convention classified wetlands into three main types: * Marine/coastal ** Brackish lagoons ** Estuaries and deltas ** Chotts ** Sebkhas ** Dayas ** Garaet * Continental ** Salt and brackish marshes ** Freshwater marshes ** Natural lakes ** Temporary pools ** Riparian woodlands ** Peat-bogs ** Wadis ** Gueltas * Artificial ** Saltpans ** Fishponds ** Reservoirs ** Temporary pools ** Ricefields ** Oases Regions in the Mediterranean Basin The Mediterranean region is unique because of its special type of climate and its very long history of human use. Wetlands in the Mediterranean Basin are varied, and there are many different types in every country. For example: * Africa ** Algeria (Chott Ech Chergui) ** Egypt (Wadi El Rayan Protected Area) ** Libya (Ain Elzarga) ** Morocco (Oasis du Tafilalet) ** Tunisia (Chott El Jerid) * Asia ** Israel (Hula Nature Reserve) ** Jordan (Azraq Oasis) ** Lebanon (Palm Islands Nature Reserve) ** Syrian Arab Republic (Sabkhat al-Jabbul Nature Reserve) * Europe ** Albania (Lake Shkodra and River Buna) ** Bosnia and Herzegovina (Livanjsko Polje: Livno Karst field) ** Bulgaria (Belene Islands Complex) ** Croatia (Lonjsko polje and Mokro polje including Krapje Dol) ** Cyprus (Larnaca Salt Lake) ** France (Camargue) ** Greece (Messolonghi lagoons) ** Italy (Valli residue del comprensorio di Comacchio) ** Macedonia (Lake Prespa) ** Malta (Ghadira) ** Monaco (R√©serve sous-marine du Larvotto) ** Montenegro (Skadarsko Jezero) ** Portugal (Estu√°rio do Sado) ** Serbia (Gornje Podunavlje) ** Slovenia (Lake Cerknica & its environs) ** Spain (Do√±ana) ** Turkey (Lake Burdur) Values of Mediterranean Wetlands Man benefits from wetlands' natural functions and services, which help to meet the needs of millions of people ‚Äì to cultivate soil, to fish for food, to cut trees for building, to hunt the waterfowl for leisure activities, to organize ecotourism programs in remarkable sites, to use their water for our domestic or agricultural needs, etc. * Cultural value Some cultural values developed in wetland areas are non-material and have become part of the life cycle and livelihood of local residents, such as rituals, beliefs, the seasonal work calendar, and different traditional techniques. * Ecological value The Mediterranean wetlands have a high percentage of endemic species. They not only provide breeding and wintering for millions of birds, they also play a role as a stopping place for an even larger number of birds during migration periods. * Economic value Environmental economics assumes that by giving a monetary value to nature, it would allow us to better take into account its importance in development choices. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment gave wetlands a value of US$15 trillion in 1997. * Hydrological value Wetlands greatly influence the flow and quality of water, thus providing benefits to humans. They store and slowly release surface water, rain, snowmelt and flood waters, maintaining soil humidity during dry periods. But the most important service is the supply of clean water for drinking, agriculture, and industries. Scientists have estimated that a 2,500 acre wetland in Georgia saves $1 million in water pollution control costs annually (OTA 1993). Pressures on the Mediterranean Wetlands Despite all the services they provide to human societies, Mediterranean wetlands continue to face many pressures from human activities. Their loss and degradation, started centuries ago, are often considered to be an unfortunate but unavoidable effect of the human development process and needs. These negative impacts result from a number of pressures such as agriculture, urbanization, industry, fishing, tourism development, energy, transport and hunting. Each kind of pressure may impact several types of wetland services. For example, agricultural development may impact wetland surfaces, hydraulic regimes, water quality, and wetland types/ landscapes. The Ramsar Convention and the Mediterranean Wetlands Initiative The Convention on Wetlands, called the Ramsar Convention, is an intergovernmental treaty concerning the wetlands. Ramsar's 15 regional initiatives support cooperation and capacity-building on wetland-related issues in specific regions or sub-regions. There are two types of regional initiatives: Ramsar Regional Centres for training and capacity building, and networks for regional cooperation. In 2016 there are 15 Ramsar Regional Initiatives covering regions of the Mediterranean, Asia, Africa and South America. Those regional networks provide a platform for collaboration between governments, technical experts, international NGOs, local communities and private companies. The Mediterranean Wetland Observatory (MWO) was established in 2008 at the request of the Mediterranean Wetlands Committee (MedWet/Com) as a multi-partner project coordinated by Tour du Valat (TdV), the Research Institute for the Conservation of Mediterranean Wetlands, based in Arles, France. Founded more than 50 years ago by Luc Hoffmann, the Tour du Valat has since then developed its research activities for the conservation of Mediterranean wetlands with a major mission: \\"Better understanding of wetlands for better management\\". The main objective of the MWO is to act as a wetland management tool serving the MedWet Initiative's countries. The ultimate aim of this regional tool, in collaboration with MedWet, is to help to improve political decisions regarding the conservation and sustainable management of wetlands, particularly in terms of legislation, governance and best practices.

Life Ye was born in 1881. He first served under Long Jiguang. After Long's fall, he served with Chen Jiongming. After the fall of Yuan Shikai, amid China's Warlord Era, Sun Yat-sen's Nationalist rival government in Guangzhou vied for legitimacy with the Zhili Clique's Beiyang government in Beijing. With Ye's assistance, Chen Jiongming had restored Sun's government through the Yuegui Wars with the Old Guangxi Clique but by 1922 they were of two minds about whether to remain a regional power or to press towards a reunification of China through a northern expedition. Under Chen's regime, Ye oversaw Guangzhou (then known as \\"Canton\\"), which he had recovered on Chen's behalf. Sun was unable to dismiss Chen but threatened General Ye, saying he had \\"8-inch guns with poisonous shells capable of entirely finishing off sixty battalions in three hours\\", and ordered him to withdraw his men from Guangzhou within ten days. In response, Ye assaulted the Presidential Palace on 15 or 16 June 1922. Sun had already fled but his wife narrowly escaped shelling and rifle fire before meeting him on the gunboat Yongfeng. where they were soon joined by Chiang Kai-shek. They hid it among the Whampoa anchorage's foreign ships, which Chen could not risk striking, and held out for about 50 days, shelling Chen's positions and attempting to restore Sun to power. Conceding his lack of support, they reached Hong Kong on a British ship and then took a steamer to Shanghai. Sun then summoned the aid of members of the New Guangxi Clique, who drove Chen and Ye into eastern Guangdong. Ye died of an illness in late January, 1925.

More often than not bond tests are destructive and samples are scrapped after testing. In aerospace and medical applications, non destructive testing is common, whereby the bond is loaded up to a point to reveal nonacceptable bonds while avoiding damage to acceptable bonds. Electrical and thermal bonds are such an integral part of electronic and semiconductor construction that they may often be taken for granted. Modern electronic assembly methods employ a myriad of bonding processes, each one a vital step in the manufacture of the final product. A typical consumer product such as a laptop computer may contain hundreds of thousands of bonds yet if one fails it will probably result in a system breakdown. For an automatic test PC controlled moving table allows any number of bonds to be tested automatically from a stored program. Results can be analysed and output immediately or exported in a number of data base formats for subsequent analysis as desired. Powerful extended capabilities enable measurements such as force/time or force/distance curves to be made and deliver more data about the quality of the bond tested. The most common test types performed on a bond tester are the wire pull test, which generally puts an upward force on a gold/aluminum/silver/copper wire, and the die shear test, which generally comprises loading a die from the side. When equipped with tweezers, bond testers may also perform cold bump pull tests. During such a test, a solder ball down to 50 ¬µm in diameter is reform it to the shape something like a mushroom and then pulled off the surface. Modern bond testers can perform a wide variety of tests with high precision, because automation eliminates human influence on the measurement. Two industry leaders are Nordson DAGE and XYZTec.

The film is both a stand-alone sequel to and remake of the 1990 film of the same name, and stars Ellen Page, Diego Luna, Nina Dobrev, James Norton, and Kiersey Clemons. It follows five medical students who attempt to conduct experiments that produce near-death experiences. Sony Pictures released the film in the United States on September 29, 2017. It was negatively reviewed by critics, who generally remarked that it repeated the problems of the original in failing to do justice to its interesting premise, but it was a moderate box office success, grossing $45 million worldwide on a $19 million budget. Plot A medical student, Courtney, is obsessed with the idea of the afterlife. She invites fellow students Jamie and Sophia to join her in an experiment, in an unused hospital room: using defibrillation to stop her heart for sixty seconds while recording her brain. She assures them they would not be held responsible for any accidents. Sophia is against this, but Jamie does it anyway. After sixty seconds, they are unable to revive her. Fellow student Ray helps them resuscitate her. Marlo, a rival of Ray, arrives and learns of the experiment. Courtney begins to recall memories of past events such as her grandmother's recipe for bread. Courtney experiences increased intelligence and euphoria, being suddenly able to play the piano after 12 years and answer questions in class perfectly. Envious, Jamie flatlines, but has a disturbing near-death experience as he meets his ex-girlfriend. Marlo and Sophia follow suit and flatline, for an increasing number of minutes. During Sophia‚Äôs turn they are nearly caught and flee the hospital and arrive at a party. Courtney and Jamie start seeing visions of past mistakes, but do not tell the others. Those who flatlined experience visions: Courtney is haunted by her sister Tessa, who died in a car crash she caused because she was using her phone. Jamie is haunted by the baby of his ex-girlfriend who he got pregnant and begged to get an abortion. Marlo is haunted by a man named Cyrus who died when she accidentally mixed up his medication, and Sophia is haunted by a girl named Irina whose life she ruined out of jealousy by hacking her phone and sending out her nudes. This allowed Sophia to become valedictorian. Courtney, traumatised by her visions, records a message apologising for the consequences and admitting that her interest in flatlining was due to the death of her sister, not for scientific discovery. She falls to her death from the fire escape of her apartment building after her sister's ghost pushes her off. The others are devastated when they learn of Courtney‚Äôs death, and realize they may be implicated if anyone discovers their experiments. After attempting to remove all notes and evidence from Courtney‚Äôs apartment, Marlo is sent to the morgue to find Courtney‚Äôs phone. She is once again haunted by visions. On his boat, Jamie again hears the cries of a baby and a woman weeping. He falls out of his boat and swims to the dock where a figure stabs him in his hand. The group watches Courtney's recording and find out that she had encountered similar hauntings. They come clean to the mistakes they made and come to the conclusion that the hauntings they're experiencing are hallucinations because of guilt from their sins, not paranormal beings. The only one who didn't flatline, Ray, initially disbelieves what's happening. The group takes action to stop the hallucinations by fixing their past mistakes. Sophia visits Irina to apologize, which Irina accepts. Jamie visits his ex-girlfriend and discovers she didn't get an abortion, but kept the baby; he apologizes and promises to provide for his son. Ray and Marlo get into a fight when Ray finds out Marlo covered up the real reason Cyrus died and she refuses to come clean. Marlo hallucinates being suffocated while driving and crashes her car. Tired of being haunted by her hallucinations, Marlo flatlines on her own in the hope of asking forgiveness of Cyrus. Ray, Sophia and Jamie rush to stop her. They resuscitate Marlo after she sees an apparition of Courtney, who tells Marlo that she needs to forgive herself. Marlo, Ray, Sophia and Jamie reminisce about Courtney and celebrate their friendships in the little restaurant they hang out at, where there is a performance of the piano piece that Courtney played. Jamie proposes a toast, honoring Courtney. Cast * Ellen Page as Courtney Holmes * Diego Luna as Ray * Nina Dobrev as Marlo * James Norton as Jamie * Kiersey Clemons as Sophia Manning * Kiefer Sutherland as Dr. Barry Wolfson / Nelson Wright * Beau Mirchoff as Brad * Madison Brydges as Tessa Holmes * Miguel Anthony as Cyrus Gudgeon * Jenny Raven as Irina Wong * Charlotte McKinney as Girl on Bicycle * Wendy Raquel Robinson as Mrs. Manning * Steve Byers as Marlo's Brother * Janet Porter as ER Doctor * Jeremiah Sird as Dr. Velez Production In October 2015, Ellen Page was cast in the film. In February 2016, Diego Luna was added, with Nina Dobrev joining in April. In May 2016, Kiersey Clemons and James Norton signed on for the film. In July 2016, it was announced that Kiefer Sutherland, who starred in the original, would return in the new film. Sutherland later disclosed that he was reprising his role from the original film, adding that the new film is actually a sequel rather than a remake. Despite the announcement, Sutherland played a character with a different name than in the original, with no reference to the specific events of the previous film. In July 2016, Charlotte McKinney also joined the cast. Principal photography began in early July 2016 in Toronto, Ontario primarily at Cinespace Film Studios' Kipling Avenue facility, and concluded on September 7. The film went into post-production on October 4. Nathan Barr composed the film score. The soundtrack was released by Sony Classical. Release =Box office= Flatliners grossed $16.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $28.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $45 million, against a production budget of $19 million. In North America, the film was released alongside American Made and 'Til Death Do Us Part, as well as the wide expansion of Battle of the Sexes, and was projected to gross $8‚Äì12 million from 2,552 theaters in its opening weekend. It ended up debuting to $6.6 million, finishing 5th at the box office; even before factoring in inflation, the number was lower than the $10 million opening of the original film in 1990. In its second weekend the film dropped 42%, grossing $3.6 million. =Critical response= On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 4% based on 76 reviews and an average rating of 3.53/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Flatliners falls flat as a horror movie and fails to improve upon its source material, rendering this reboot dead on arrival.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 27 out of 100 based 20 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 66% overall positive score and a 46% \\"definite recommend\\". Criticizing the repetitiveness of the scenes and lack of tension, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called the film \\"even more witless and stupefyingly dull than the original.\\" He gave it one star. Ryan Porter gave it one-and-a-half stars in The Star, saying that like the original, it takes a solid premise and fails to develop it in an interesting or exciting way. He said the film's one positive is the unintentional humor which results from the stupidity of several scenes and the earnestness with which the actors approach them. Matt Zoller Seitz similarly said that \\"[the] premise [of the original Flatliners], which could have opened the door to a visionary work of sci-fi horror, settled into a sort of gothic self-help drama groove, with the medical students realizing that the seemingly supernatural goings-on triggered by their experiments in 'flatlining' were manifestations of their past misdeeds. Director Niels Arden Oplev's remake ... sticks to that template, changing key details here and there while embracing a style that stirs every current horror movie visual cliche into a jagged paste.\\" He also remarked that the obvious effort given by the entire cast could not overcome the contrived and clich√©d scares and melodrama. Both Travers and Porter derided the visual effect of the afterlife scenes as cheap-looking and silly. =Home media= Flatliners was released on Digital HD on December 12, 2017, and on Blu-ray and DVD on December 19, 2017 in Canada, and on December 26, 2017 in the United States.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Architecture and history The Vinalhaven Public Library stands near the eastern end of Vinalhaven's commercial downtown area, at the junction of Carver, Chestnut, and Main Streets. The building is a single-story structure, built out of quarry-faced granite and covered by a hip roof. The roof has extended eaves with exposed rafters, with a chimney rising near the left wall. The main entrance is in the center of the facade facing Carver Street, recessed under a round arch in a projecting section topped by a flat parapet. A high stringcourse runs beneath a narrow band of square windows on either side of the entrance. The interior has a central librarian's desk with flanking reading rooms, and original wooden shelving on the walls. with Vinalhaven's public library originated in 1887, when Governor Joseph R. Bodwell, owner of one of Vinalhaven's granite quarries, made a pledge to provide space for a library if funds were raised to establish one. A private circulating library was added to this early collection in 1890, and was established in Vinalhaven's Memorial Hall in 1895. The present building was constructed in 1906, funded in part by a grant from Andrew Carnegie. It was designed by the firm of George A. Clough and Herbert L. Wardner, and is the only Prairie School library design in the state.

A native of N√∏rre Vram, Sk√•ne (now in Bjuv Municipality, Sweden), his boyhood was affected by the Northern Seven Years' War, some of his older siblings and his mother fell victim to the epidemics which accompanied the war. After the war, he was schooled in Herrisvad convent school. His earliest known period in Danish and Latin was composed at the age of 20. He studied at Rostock university under David Chytraeus. He spent several years in Germany, possibly studying at the university at Wittenberg. In January 1587 wrote a letter of recommendation for Lyschander to Frederick II. Lyschander was made pastor of Herf√∏lge and S√¶dder parishes, one of the more prestigious positions in Zealand, where he replaced Jon Jakobsen Venusinus whom he later also succeeded as Royal Historian. Lyschander married in 1588 and was appointed dean at Bj√¶verskov Herred (Pr√¶st√∏ County). He published several historiographical works in verse form between 1608 and 1623. He was appointed Royal Historian (kongelig historiograf) by Christian IV in 1616, charged with compiling a national historiography of Denmark \\"after Saxo\\" (i.e. covering the 13th century onward). The work was scheduled for six years, but Lyschander laid out a plan of 116 volumes. Maybe because it seemed unlikely that Lyschander was able to complete the national history within the appointed time, royal chancellor Christian Friis appointed Johan Isaksson Pontanus with the same task as Lyschander, but Lyschander was allowed to continue to work on his own project. In 1619, Lyschander presented a draft version of his Synopsis Historiae Danicae, which was published in 1622 (now known under the title of Danske Kongers Sl√¶gtebog \\"Genealogy of the Danish kings\\").

He was a friend and student of Giles of Rome and served as Prior Provincial of the Abruzzi branch of the congregation. The recognition of his \\"cultus\\" (or popular following) allowed for Pope Leo XIII to preside over his beatification on 20 December 1888. Life Angelo da Furci was born in 1246 to Adalitto and Albazia. The couple was childless and begged for the intercession of Saint Michael the Archangel for a son. During his childhood he was sent to a Benedictine convent where his maternal uncle served as the Abbot. He received his education there at the convent of Cornaclano until the death of his uncle in 1264, which prompted him to return home; he completed his philosophical and literary studies with high results. Adalitto fell ill in 1265 and revealed to his son the truth about the circumstances of his birth while suggesting that his son become a member of the Order of Saint Augustine; his father died not long after. The death of his father solidified his decision to do so but he did not seek admission straight after since he remained at home with his aging and despairing mother in order to care for her. In 1266 he left his home and requested permission to join the order while starting his period of novitiate and making his profession. He underwent theological studies until 1270 when he was ordained to the priesthood. He was then sent to Paris in 1271 for further studies where one of his teachers was Giles of Rome - the latter became a close friend as well. The priest earned a Lector's Degree in 1276 and then taught theological studies back in Abruzzo for 5 years. Officials made the unanimous decision in a meeting of 1287 to elect him as Prior Provincial of the Abruzzese branches of the order and he refused at first before Clement of Osimo required him to accept the nomination. He proved competent and became well-known for his evangelic zeal and his uprightness as well as being noted for his gentleness of spirit. He was also a skilled orator. The priest also renounced episcopal appointments to the sees of Melfi and Acerra that Pope Nicholas IV offered to him. He retired at the age of 81 due to his declining health and died not long after in 1327. His remains were later transferred in August 1808. Beatification His beatification received the approval of Pope Leo XIII on 20 December 1888 in approval of the \\"cultus\\" (or popular devotion) to the late priest.

He was hailed as a reformer of the order. The recognition of his \\"cultus\\" (or popular following) allowed for Pope Clement XIII to preside over his beatification in 1761. Life Clemente da Osimo was born in Osimo in 1235. He belonged to the Congregation of Hermits of Brettino though exited the order and instead entered the Order of Saint Augustine in Brettino in 1256 at the Grand Union. Clemente was later chosen as the Provincial of the Marche province of the order in 1269. He was twice made Prior General and served his first term from Pentecost of 1271 until 1274 when he resigned though he was later re-elected in 1284 (in a unanimous verdict) and held that position until his death. In his first term he visited houses on the Italian peninsula as well as in the Kingdom of France. He participated in the Second Council of Lyons in 1274 that Pope Gregory X convoked which gave the order a fear of suppression that festered over the next few decades; it was at the order's 1274 general chapter that he resigned from his first term. The re-elected Clemente was given the task of revising the constitutions of the order in 1284. He and Blessed Augustine of Tarano helped to revise the Regensburg Constitution of the order in response to this call and this was completed in 1290. He also encouraged formal studies for priests and founded a total of five schools while also promoting the foundation of order houses that were designed for women. He died on 8 April 1291.

He was born on the island of Ven as the son of the local pastor, Jakob Jonsen. The father was transferred to Landskrona in 1563, where Jon Jakobsen assumed the surname Coronensis, which he changed to Venusinus after the island of Ven became widely known due to the observatories built there by Tycho Brahe. He visited the school at Frederiksborg, and later studied in Copenhagen and Rostock. In 1579 David Chytr√¶us recommended him to Frederick II, who granted him an annuity to support his studies. Venusinus spent some years travelling in Europe, visiting Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy, and completed a master's degree in Wittenberg. Returning to Denmark, he was made parish priest in Herf√∏lge and S√¶dder and dean of Bj√¶verskov Herred in 1584, a position in which he was succeeded by Claus Christoffersen Lyschander in 1587. Venusinus married Agathe, the daughter of professor John Sascerides in 1585, and after the death of his first wife in 1589 he married Karine Dankertsdatter, widow of canon Hans Leiel in Roskilde. It appears that both marriages remained childless, but he adopted the son of his second wife, Dankert Leiel. The position in Herf√∏lge was one of the most lucrative in the country, but Venusinus appears to have preferred life in the capital, and he moved to Copenhagen in 1587 where he was made pastor of the Church of the Holy Ghost. He was accused of holding Crypto-Calvinist sympathies, due to his refusal to perform baptismal exorcism, and he was suspended from office in 1588. He petitioned Christian IV to abolish baptismal exorcism; his request was not granted, but in a partial success for Venusinus, the king himself had one of his children baptized without the ceremony. Although Venusinus was not on good terms with the Copenhagen academy, he was appointed professor of physics (i.e. natural sciences) \\"by royal command\\" in 1600, under which title he undertook the construction of a botanical garden. He was among the first at Copenhagen University to accept the Copernican worldview and he held lectures on magnetism. After the death of Niels Krag in 1602, he was also appointed Royal Historian. In 1603 he switched from the chair of physics to that of rhetoric and held lectures on Danish antiquity (Antiquitates rerum Danicarum). In 1606 he accompanied Christian IV to England on the king's visit to his brother-in-law James I of England, where his erudition attracted considerable attention. In 1607, Venusinus was endowed with Soro Abbey, which allowed him to retire from all paid academic work, and he intended to focus on compiling a history of Denmark, but he died, around the age of fifty, on 30 January of the following year.

The movie had its world premiere on October 25, 2011 at the Kansas International Film Festival where it won the Audience Award for Best Narrative Film. M√ºller-Dorn initially came up with the idea for the film in 2006 after reading an article about a shelter for abused men in Hamburg. Since it turned out to be difficult to find abused men who were willing to talk about their experiences, the research phase took a lot longer than M√ºller-Dorn expected and the screenplay of Emancipation was finished in early 2010. Principal shooting took place in Berlin and Guxhagen in Northern Hessia in July and August 2010. Cast *Urs St√§mpfli as Dominik *Frances Heller as Angela *Michael Schwager as Holger *Roland Avernard as Gregor *Anna G√∂rgen as Belinda *Sandy Hor√°kov√° as Denise *Peer Alexander Hauck as Lukas *Jan Marc Kochmann as Andreas *Hans Ulrich Laux as Horst *Yannik Burwiek as Dylan Synopsis Dominik Liebmann is a man at the end of his rope. He has seemingly lost all he had: his job, his house, his wife, his son, his fortune and even his dignity. Without a penny in his pocket he enters Berlin's only shelter for battered men. He meets Holger, the head of the 'M√§nnerhaus' and its members. After a psychiatric evaluation by the youth welfare office, he is ordered to engage in the group therapy session of the men's shelter so he can get custody for Dylan, his son. After an initial reluctance Dominik participates and talks about his past: While on a holiday in Northern-Hessia Dominik meets Angela: a 19-year old blonde, pretty face and a direct but charming demeanour. The sympathy grows into passion and they become a couple. When visiting Berlin later Angela announces to Dominik that she is pregnant, so he proposes. But the marital heaven turns rapidly to marital hell. Angela becomes loud, abusive, addicted to alcohol and starts to blow Dominik‚Äôs money while he is busy providing for his family. He tries to talk to Angela about her behaviour but to no avail. He just tries to avoid her progressively violent moods and her extreme rage. Angela‚Äôs violent behavior escalates. Angela leaves Dominik and takes their son Dylan with him. In these sessions Dominik describes the marital abuse he suffered, but he still justifies and defends Angela's cruel behavior. At Holger's insistence Doninik decides to sign up for karate class. There he meets Belinda a divorced lawyer with two daughters. They start to date, but Domink has difficulties opening himself up, is avoiding uncomfortable truths of the past and keeps on justifying his wife‚Äôs abusive behaviours. Dominik finally manages to break out of his own vicious circle of denial: realizing Angela‚Äôs behavior was indeed abusive, but more importantly that he allowed himself to be victimized and that he added to the violent dynamics with passivity and his lack of taking responsibility. With Belinda's help Dominik gets the custody of his son, gets his old job back and moves out of the men‚Äôs shelter to start a new life with his son, Belinda and her kids. Reception Critical reception for Emancipation has been mostly positive. Robert Butler of butlercinamescene.com considers it one of the best films of the KIFF. Erin Tuttle compares the visual style of the film to Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Amos Lassen praises the performances as \\"wonderful\\" and calls it \\"a film that really opens our eyes\\".

Early life and education The daughter of the concert singer Anders Lauridsen Brems (1877‚Äì1974) and the pianist Gerda Emilie Rasmussen (1880-1967), Else was born in Copenhagen on 16 July 1908. She was raised in a musical family. Her maternal grandfather, Peter Rasmussen, was an organist and composer, her uncle Alfred Rasmussen a French hornist, and her father, initially a clarinettist, later became known as a singer, premiering many of Carl Nielsen's songs. It was her father who first taught her to sing, assisted by her mother, who accompanied her on the piano. When Brems was 17, she decided to become a professional singer. Her father took her to Rome to study under the celebrated baritone Mattia Battistini who was delighted to instruct her. She then went to Paris where she acquired the authentic accent which can be heard in her French-language performances. Career She was only 20 when she first performed in Copenhagen. Thanks to her successful d√©but, she went to Berlin to be trained by the American opera singer Sara Cahier, famous for her Carmen performances. After perfecting her Carmen role in French, when she was 22 Brems returned to Denmark to appear as Carmen at the Royal Danish Theatre. Her reputation was firmly established as she performed under the direction of Johannes Poulsen and the German conductor Leo Blech. In 1933, she sang at a private concert in Chicago where she received high acclaim, one critic commenting that she would be \\"the world's greatest Carmen\\". She went on to study in New York under Enrico Rosati who had trained Beniamino Gigli. After performing in concerts in New York and Chicago, she returned to Europe where she played Carmen over 100 times in Copenhagen alone. In Vienna, she performed the role in German under Bruno Walter, in London in English, and in Prague, Budapest, Warsaw and Stockholm in French. In 1940, she married the Icelandic tenor Stef√°n √çslandi with whom she frequently performed. She spent the war years in Scandinavia, performing in Denmark and Sweden. One of her most appreciated roles in Copenhagen during the war was as Bess in Gerschwin's Porgy and Bess in which the actors blackened their faces, a feature which was not welcomed by the German occupying forces. Following the liberation of Denmark in 1945, Brems contributed to the celebrations by playing Elisabeth in the patriotic Elveh√∏j. After the war, she toured mainly in Denmark but also performed as Carmen in Covent Garden in 1948. Brems also performed in many other roles while at Copenhagen's Royal Theatre. These included Orpheus in Gluck's Orpheus and Eurydice (1939), Lola in Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana (1946), Cornelia in Handel's Julius Caesar (1947), Cherubino in The Marriage of Figaro (1948), and Lucretia in Benjamin Britten's The Rape of Lucretia (1955). Her last role at the Royal Theatre was that of the mother in Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann in 1961. In addition to opera, Brems was a successful concert performer, singing works by Bach and Handel and frequently appearing as an acclaimed lied singer, interpreting works by Schubert and Brahms. She also sang songs by Ravel and Debussy and by the Danish composer Peter Lange-M√ºller. After officially leaving the theatre in 1962, she worked as a singing coach until her retirement in 1978. Until 1967 she was dean of Det Jyske Musikkonservatorium after which she joined Copenhagen University's Musikvidenskabeligt Institut where one of her most successful students was the soprano opera singer Elisabeth Meyer-Tops√∏e. Else Brems died on 4 October 1995 in Copenhagen and is buried in Garnisons Cemetery. Awards In addition to receiving the Tagea Brandt Travel Scholarship in 1945, Brems was elevated to the status of Royal Court Singer by Christian X in 1946. In 1953, she received Denmark's highest award for artists, writers and performers, the Ingenio et Arti.

The stadium is proposed, in part, to allow Greenland to participate in FIFA and UEFA as the organizations' strict guidelines on stadiums are a barrier to admittance. It is expected to seat several thousand spectators and be fully enclosed with heating. The stadium is expected to be completed by 2020. Danish architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) and its renowned architect David Zahle designed the stadium as part of the larger proposed cultural center. In 2016 the firm was paid 380,000 dk for planning and design work, with the majority going toward feasibility studies. History When former FIFA president Sepp Blatter visited Greenland in 2010, he stated that there were only two factors preventing Greenland from becoming members of the organization: full independence and an acceptable venue. Blatter stated that the stadium would need to be covered and contain an artificial surface. At that time, the 3,000 seat stadium was expected to cost 83 million dk. In May 2015 the Parliament of Greenland allocated one million dk. in its budget to create a project plan for the construction of a new national football stadium in Nuuk. The plan was due to be presented to parliament by autumn 2016. In June 2016, it was expected that the plan would be presented very soon. The largest hurdle to the construction of the stadium is funding. Although the GBU and Danish DBU entered into an agreement in 2015 to grow football in Greenland and work towards FIFA and UEFA membership by 2020, the partnership does not provide funding for the creation of such a facility. General Secretary of the GBU Nike Lyberth-Berthelsen has stated that building the national stadium will provide financial resources for football in Greenland by enabling the organization to charge for tickets to matches, something that can not be done at the open-air and seatless Nuuk Stadium. In February 2017 the Parliament of Greenland indicated that the stadium was unlikely to be built in the foreseeable future, with a lack of public funds again being mentioned as the main obstacle. At that time it was stated that the stadium designed by BIG would cost 304,000,000 dk and 454,000,000 dk for the stadium with an adjacent hotel. In June 2017 a working group was created to locate external investors which were seen as necessary for the project to move forward.

Biography  After he had presented, in collaboration with Henri Crisafulli, his regular collaborator, a certain number of plays many of which enjoyed a great success, Devicque was better known as a playwright than as a novelist. He made his debut in theatre in 1855 with the drama C√©sar Borgia, which offered the distinction of having been received, learned and mounted in eight days ; Of all his plays, the one was the most successful. Then came the historical drama Marie Stuart en √âcosse, the popular drama Deux faubouriens, le Roi Lear, Girofl√©-Girofla, a drama which, despite the emotional role that was created by Mme. Doche was little appreciated by the public. Finally, the comedy Esther Ramel, where Ana√Øs Fargueil played the lead role, was a miserable failure, and the play disappeared from the bills almost immediately after the premiere. The complete failure of Esther Ramel, succeeding promising successes, probably discouraged Devicque from theater. It is from this time that, despairing of addressing popular theaters, he began writing novels. When he died, he left many manuscripts to Henri Crisafulli.

It was designed by Harold Barker and built in 1938. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005.  History  This two stored masonry and stucco building was constructed on Thursday Island for the Australian Government's Customs Department in 1938. It was designed by the head architect of the Commonwealth Department of Works, Harold Barker, and replaced an earlier customs house built in 1885. Thursday Island can lay claim to unique long-term historical, cultural and strategic links with the nation's heritage. The island was first known as \\"Waiben Island\\" to the indigenous people of the region, who did not permanently inhabit the island to any great extent. Europeans first visited the area in March 1606, in the Dutch ship \\"Duyfken\\". A Spanish voyage visited soon after, followed by Captain Cook, Bligh and Flinders in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The islands in the Torres Strait were annexed by the colonial government of Queensland in 1872. The northernmost town on the mainland at the time was Somerset, established in 1861. This settlement was abandoned in 1877 in favour of a settlement on Thursday Island. There was great hope for growth of this settlement as it was a vital link in the shipping routes between Australia and Asia and England, and served the pearl-luggers and the beche-de-mere harvesters which thrived in the area. There is also evidence that the settlement was established to provide a government presence in the region to stall imperialist tendencies of the Germans and the French in the late nineteenth century. It was of strategic importance at this time, for the colonial government (and later the Federated colonies) to establish a chain of customs control points at all the main harbours along the coastline. The customs service was responsible for the collection of duties in Australia, which provided funds for the necessary infrastructure in the early settlements. Each of the colonies were furnished with a Customs service upon responsible government from the 1850s and onwards, which provided an important source of revenue, including the imposition of duties on goods traded between colonies. The collection of Customs was consequently central to the development of the colonial governments, and was an important mechanism by which the colonies conducted their affairs. Upon Federation the collection of Customs became a Commonwealth responsibility. Customs service records indicate that in 1877 a \\"Port of Entry and Clearance\\" was gazetted at Thursday Island on 24 November. Mr H.M. Chester was appointed Customs Sub-Collector and Harbour Master in 1877 and by 1884 the port was gazetted as a warehouse facility. \\"The port flourished in its early years and a staff of up to six officers was necessary. In 1885 the first Customs House was erected at a cost of ¬£797. In 1890 the Sub-Collectors residence was built at a cost of ¬£1,076.\\" The building was constructed of timber on a platform on short stumps. It was single storeyed, with a verandah on all sides and contained a public counter and \\"long room\\" office, a private Sub-Collectors office and a public office with cashiers window. This Customs House was located on the corner of Douglas and Hastings streets. Accommodation for a growing staff was provided by removing four cottages from Sea Hill near Rockhampton to Thursday Island in 1895. A Tidewaiters cottage was built in 1897. The main activity in the port was pearl handling. There were numerous Asian and Japanese pearl luggers active in the waters of Torres Strait and it was the customs officers' duty to track and control these and the many trading vessels which stopped at Port Kennedy to refuel with coal, trade and bring immigrants. The ports activities can be gauged from the fact that revenue for the financial year 1879/80 was ¬£2,493 while twenty years later in 1899/1900 it had grown to ¬£19,411. After World War I, the pearling industry quickly returned to its former activity level with sixty luggers active in the Strait. Customs records show reference to \\"... the important port of Thursday Island, with its timber Customs House, provided a major gateway to Australia, often being the first port of call for ships from Asia.\\" Customs House, possibly during construction in 1938 In 1938 the importance of the port was confirmed once again when a new two storey Customs House was erected. Built of brick and concrete, its ground floor served as the customs office while the second storey served as the sub- collectors residence. The building cost ¬£9,860 and was one of the most prominent landmarks on the island. It was located on the land directly beside the original timber customs house which was then removed. Shortly after construction of the new customs house in 1939, war was declared. At the end of January 1942, Thursday Island was evacuated of its non-essential inhabitants. Stores were closing and the Customs officers now had to \\"do our own cooking, housework, washing, messages if we require anything, nothing is delivered.\\" Gauld reported that \\"the office work has fallen to practically nil and will probably remain at that from now on.\\" Late in 1942 the military, now in command of the Torres Strait, took control of the Customs House and used it as the residence for the Commander of the Torres Force for the remainder of World War II. The Customs House returned to the Customs Service in 1946 when military control of Thursday Island was relinquished. The building had stood empty for some months since the Torres Force Commander left it in 1945. Early in 1946, the Sub-Collector for Cairns, M.J. Ryan, visited Thursday Island to inspect the buildings and general situation. He noted, \\"[a] number of indentured Malay people continue to live in Thursday Island and the place is often an open door to the East.\\" He was also of the opinion that an officer should be detailed for duty at Thursday Island to look after the Customs interests, perform immigration duties and provide facilities under the Navigation Act and Merchant Shipping Act. Over the years the Customs Service on Thursday Island has been involved in the various Customs duties as determined by the Governments of the day. During the years since the military's occupation of the building in World War II, the Customs House was used continuously by the Australian Customs Service until it passed out of Commonwealth ownership. The building remains a landmark on the island, being one of the few non-timber buildings constructed there.  Description  Side view of the Customs House Thursday Island is one of the many tropical islands in the region known as Torres Strait, lying between the northern tip of Cape York and the New Guinea coast. The Thursday Island Customs House occupies a prominent site in the township of Thursday Island, located on the southern coastline of the island. The Customs House is a two stored masonry building, located fronting Victoria Parade, and bordered by Hastings and Jetty streets. The Government Jetty and Engineers Jetty lie nearby. The building remains a landmark on the island, being one of the few non timber buildings constructed there. The former Thursday Island Customs House follows the Neo-Georgian style of the 1930s. The double-storey rendered masonry building has projecting balconies at the front and back and a hipped terracotta tile roof, executed on a domestic scale. The windows have timber shutters, a common tropical motif. The plan form of this building is typical of the customs houses of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century period in Queensland. The focus of the building was the Long Room where business was transacted. This is located in the centre of the ground floor which is entered through the front of the building. Smaller offices are located around this room, including an office for the sub-collector, the person in charge of the operations at the port. On the first floor was the sub-collector's residence, with bedrooms, living areas, and other rooms. The arcades and balconies fulfilled further purposes apart from satisfying the symmetry and formality desired. Upstairs, the balcony provided a protected yet airy living space, necessary in the tropical climate. Double doorways from the internal rooms often opened onto the balcony, admitting cool breezes. Timber shutters to the openings of the balcony have been installed in the Thursday Island Customs House. Stripped Classical was a style that retained the important classical elements such as symmetry of massing and elevations, while acknowledging the effect of modernism in design. The buildings of this style were recognisably classical buildings which were however stripped of much of the ornament usually associated with this type of building. Where ornament was applied it was often in the form of Art Deco. The extent of grounds around the three street frontages of the Customs House allows uninterrupted views of the substantial building, enhancing the status and presentation of the building in the streetscape. The grounds are predominantly flat, comprising open lawns with a few mature trees and a line of tall palms giving added distinction to the substantial building. A concrete path extends from the front entry porch steps straight to a gate in the boundary fence. There is a path along the front of the building. Garden beds fill the space from the base of the walls to this path. The path extends to a small square of concrete paving in the eastern lawn in which a flag pole and small cannon have been placed. Paths extend from the two side entrances to gates at the boundaries. In massing and proportion, the Thursday Island Customs House is similar to the Cairns Customs House.  Heritage listing  Thursday Island Customs House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Thursday Island Customs House is important in illustrating the evolution of Queensland's history as it is evidence of an official government activity in a remote location such as Thursday Island. It has further significance as a site of strategic importance to colonial and national governments. The Customs House is also a reflection of the importance of the island as a \\"gateway\\" to the colony of Queensland, and later the Commonwealth of Australia. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The place is a good example of the stripped Classical style of institutional architecture pursued by the Commonwealth Department of Works in the interwar period. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Thursday Island Customs House has aesthetic significance for the quality of its design, in particular the way it accommodates the climate of North Queensland; and for its contribution to the Thursday Island environment as one of the largest buildings, and as one of the few non-timber buildings on the island. The aesthetics of the Thursday Island Customs House is strengthened by its settings, including tropical plantings.

Since 2014, she has been the Archdeacon of Dorchester in the Diocese of Oxford. French was educated at a United Reformed Church boarding school, studied theology at St David's College, Lampeter, and trained for ordination at St Stephen's House, Oxford. She served as a parish deacon in the Diocese of Portsmouth (1991‚Äì1994), and as an assistant curate in the Diocese of Coventry (1994‚Äì1997). She was a Vicar in the Diocese of Oxford from 1997 until her appointment as Archdeacon; during this incumbency, she also served as Area Dean of Chipping Norton (2007‚Äì2012). In 2012, she was made an Honorary Canon of Christ Church Cathedral. Early life and education French was born on 18 November 1960 in Portsmouth, Hampshire, England. She spent her childhood living in England, Kenya and the Middle East, as the family moved during her father's career as a telecom engineer. Her mother was a Sunday school teacher. She was educated at an English \\"boarding school that was originally set up for the daughters of United Reformed Church ministers\\". She therefore originally attended a URC church with her school, but soon began attending the local Church of England church. She was confirmed at the age of 14, having attended the church near her grandparents‚Äô home in Portsmouth for preparation. After finishing school, French moved to Portsmouth where she began working as an accounts clerk at an insurance firm. She became a member of the church she was confirmed at which was a \\"middle of the road church with an Anglo-Catholic vicar\\". She joined its parochial church council (PCC) at the age of 19. After completing a history A-Level at night school, French became the first member of her family to attend university when she took up a place to study theology at St David's College, Lampeter in Wales. During her time at Lampeter, the university chaplain was a woman and there had been female deacons in the Church in Wales since 1980. She felt the call to ordination while at university. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1989. She was selected for ordination in the Church of England, and matriculated into St Stephen's House, Oxford, an Anglo-Catholic theological college, in 1989.

Built in 1797, it is one of Vermont's small number of surviving Georgian style houses. It was built by the son of one of the area's early settlers, and originally served as a tavern. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history The Jeffrey House stands just north of Chester's Stone Village, set back about from the east side of Vermont Route 103. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and wooden shingle siding. It is set in the side of a shallow hill, and its basement, partly rubblestone but finished on the west side in brick, is entirely exposed on the front facade. It is covered by a hip roof, with two interior chimneys. The front facade is five bays wide, with a former entrance at the center of the basement level (now boarded over) flanked by sidelights. Windows in the outer bays are sash, with simple surrounds, while the windows above the entrance are Palladian three-part windows with rounded centers. The interior follows a typical Georgian central hall pattern, with a center hall flanked by two rooms on each side on the ground floor. It varies from the pattern with a large ballroom extending in front of the chimneys on the second floor. with The house was built in 1797 by Jabez Sargent Jr., whose father was one of Chester's first settlers. Chester was incorporated as New Flamsted in 1763, and was in 1766 designated the county seat of Cumberland County, New York (Vermont then being disputed territory between the Province of New York and the Province of New Hampshire). Local oral tradition holds that the house is built on the site of the county's first courthouse and jail. The house originally served as a tavern, situated on one of the major routes between Boston and Montreal. It is one of Vermont's few Georgian buildings, a style that was at the time of its construction already fading in fashion. Although it is built to a large size (befitting its use as a tavern), it lacks many of the high-style features often found in large Georgian houses.

Born in the Hulme area of Manchester, Williams spent some time as a pupil-teacher before following his father by becoming a musician, finding work as a clarinetist at the Comedy Theatre. Concerned about working conditions in the industry, in 1893, he founded the Amalgamated Musicians' Union (AMU).Cyril Ehrlich, \\"Williams, Joseph (Joe) Bevir\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.IX, pp.284‚Äì288 The union's first members were Williams' own colleagues, with forty attending the first meeting. Shortly afterwards, Williams' mother, Kate, recruited a group of musicians in Birmingham and, within a year, branches had been set up in a large number of provincial cities. As general secretary of the union, Joe successfully argued that part-time musicians should be permitted to join, but that members of military bands should not earn extra pay by working as civilian musicians in their spare time. Williams became was elected to Manchester City Council in 1904 as the Labour Representation Committee candidate for Openshaw, with the backing of Manchester and Salford Trades Council. However, two years later, he was declared bankrupt and therefore was excluded from the city council. In 1907, he was elected to the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), later serving on its successor, the General Council of the TUC, and as President of the TUC in 1923.Musicians' Union, \\"JB Williams\\" Williams' son, also Joe, served in World War I and was killed aged just eighteen. Despite this, he supported the war and, frustrated with the Labour Party's anti-war stance, he was one of the proposers, in 1917, that a new trade union labour party should be created. After many years of negotiations, in 1921, Williams persuaded the AMU's main rival, the National Orchestral Union of Professional Musicians, to merge into it. He remained general secretary of what was now remained the Musicians' Union until he retired in 1924; although only in his early fifties, he was in poor health following years of extremely long hours of work. He moved to Veyri√®res in France, where he died in 1929.

History The club initially participated in the Murray Ranges Football Association, temporarily shifting for one season (1925) to the Murray River Football Association before returning and in 1930 were renamed to Sedan Cambrai. In 1936 the club went into recess until after World War II, when in 1947 it reformed and joined the Barossa & Murray Valley Football Association, lasting for four seasons before going into recess again in 1951. In 1955 the club reformed again and returned to the Barossa & Murray Valley Association. Sedan Cambrai had a short affiliation with the Gawler and District Football Association's AII competition from 1957-1958 before shifting to the Torrens Valley Football Association AII competition in 1959. When the TVFA merged into the new Hills Football League in 1967, Sedan Cambrai joined the Northern Division and then were placed in the Division 2 competition when the Hills League was restructured in 1972. In 1975, Sedan Cambrai merged with the Mount Torrens Football Club to form the Mount Torrens Cambrai Football Club. This merger would only last for ten years before the club split back into Sedan Cambrai and Mount Torrens in 1986. The reformed Sedan Cambrai entered the Mid Murray Football Association and played in that competition until it disbanded at the end of the 2009 season when they returned to the Hills Football League Country Division (Division 2).

It focuses on winners of the principal three-year-old Classic races, as these have long been used to evaluate a stallion's success, and the highest quality races for older horses based on International Federation of Horseracing Authorities rankings. A few other highly prestigious races from around the world have been included as well. Northern Dancer's first major winner was Nijinsky, who swept the English Triple Crown in 1970. Nijinsky in turn established himself as a leading sire, as did several other of Northern Dancer's sons, especially Danzig, Storm Bird (through his son Storm Cat) and Sadler's Wells. Modern descendants of Northern Dancer's sire line include American Triple Crown winner Justify (2018) and the majority of recent English Classic winners including the undefeated Frankel. Although not covered by the following list, Northern Dancer's influence is magnified in modern pedigrees by the success of several of his male descendants as broodmare sires. Triple Crown winner American Pharoah and leading sire Tapit are just two examples of horses who descend from Northern Dancer in an indirect line. Races included and number of winners The following races were selected based on notability (for example, the English Classic and American triple crown races), quality (as measured by the IFHA ranking of the top 100 G1 races), and geography (to sample racing from around the world).

She is the Head of the Melbourne School of Population of Population and Global Health. She continues to maintain her appointment as Professor of Surgery in the Department of Surgery and the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation at the University of Toronto. She is a scientist with the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute and is a Senior Scientist in the Cancer Theme Group with the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). Baxter has achieved board certifications through the American Board of Surgery (2000) and the American Board of Colon and Rectal Surgery (2002). She is a Fellow of both the American College of Surgeons and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. thumb She served as the Associate Dean, Academic Affairs at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health from 2016 through 2020. She was Provincial GI Endoscopy Lead for Ontario at Cancer Care Ontario from 2013 - 2020.  Biography  Baxter was born in South Porcupine, Ontario. She obtained her medical doctorate (1990) and PhD in Clinical Epidemiology (1998) from the University of Toronto. She completed her general surgery residency training at the University of Toronto from 1991‚Äì1999, followed by a fellowship in colorectal surgery at the Mayo Clinic in 2001. From 2002 to 2005, she held the rank of assistant professor of surgery at the University of Minnesota and a staff position as a colorectal surgeon at the University of Minnesota Fairview Hospital. Baxter relocated back to Toronto in 2006 with the academic rank of assistant professor at the University of Toronto and staff colorectal surgeon at St. Michael's Hospital. She was promoted to the rank of associate professor of surgery in 2008. In 2013 she was selected as the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Traveling Fellow to Australia and New Zealand (ANZ). She has been a full professor at the University of Toronto since 2015. In September 2016 Baxter was inducted as a Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences. Fellows are elected to the Academy by their peers for their \\"contributions to the promotion of health science (based on) demonstrated leadership, creativity, distinctive competencies and a commitment to advance academic health science.\\"  Research  Baxter's primary research focus as a clinical epidemiologist and health services researcher is the effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening, long-term survivorship of cancer survivors and quality of surgical care. She also applies the use of linked health administrative data and cancer registry data to evaluate long-term consequences of cancer care for adults. She has published more than 200 peer- reviewed publications in journals such as New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), Journal of Clinical Oncology, Annals of Internal Medicine, British Medical Journal and the Canadian Medical Association Journal. In 2008 Baxter led a study that found colonoscopy was less effective at finding cancers on the right side and therefore reduced mortality only from left-side tumors. In 2014 the Canadian Cancer Society announced funding for a project led by Baxter to create a clinical decision-making tool designed to help young cancer patients make choices about preserving their fertility after cancer treatment. In 2015 Baxter led a study that showed that patients having elective surgery during the day fare no better or worse if the doctor operating has worked the night before. A 2016 study led by Baxter showed that organ transplant recipients have a higher-than-average risk of dying from cancer, possibly warranting increased prevention and screening measures.

In 1982, she was elevated as the first woman to serve on the Oklahoma Supreme Court and between 1995 and 1997 was the first woman Chief Justice. Wilson was honored by many awards in her lifetime including induction into the Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame, the Oklahoma Hall of Fame and was named Appellate Judge of the Year in both 1986 and 1989. Early life Alma Bell and her twin sister Wilma were born on May 25, 1917 in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma to Anna and William R. Bell. From age eight, Bell had decided to become a lawyer and after graduating as valedictorian of the class of 1935 from Pauls Valley High School, she attended Principia College in Elsah, Illinois, completing her BA degree. Bell then attended Oklahoma City University where she obtained her Bachelor of Laws before enrolling at the University of Oklahoma College of Law. She was one of six women in a class of 100 students, who graduated with a juris doctorate in 1941. Career After completing her law degree, Bell returned to Pauls Valley and began her practice as a tax attorney. After World War II ended, she met a veteran, who was also a practicing attorney in Pauls Valley. She and Bill Wilson married in 1948 and had their daughter Lee Ann in 1951. After taking a few years to raise Lee Ann and earn her pilot's license, Wilson returned to the court in 1960 with an eye to pursuing a judgeship. Her first appointment was as a municipal judge in Pauls Valley, but she also continued to practice law in both Oklahoma City and Pauls Valley. In 1969, when the Oklahoma Court System was reorganized and both county judges and justices of the peace were abolished in favor of a district trial system, Wilson was appointed as the Special Judge in charge of minor cases for Garvin County. In 1975, she was appointed as the second woman District Judge in the state, when Governor David Boren appointed her to serve for the 21st District, encompassing Cleveland, Garvin, and McClain Counties. Judge Margaret Lamm McCalister, of Tulsa County was the first female district judge and simultaneously with Wilson's appointment, Judge Patricia M. Hoebel was appointed for District 15, which included Pawnee and part of Tulsa Counties. Wilson also served on the Court of Tax Review for six years and was an appointee by the governor to the Commission on the Status of Women. Wilson was appointed by Governor George Nigh in 1982 as the first woman justice on the Oklahoma Supreme Court, becoming the first female chief justice in the state in 1995. She served until 1997 as chief justice and also served the presiding judge of the Appellate jurisdiction of the judiciary. Though she was involved in many notable cases, like the Southwestern Bell rate refund case, legislative appropriations and school funding, one of Wilson's special interests was juvenile justice. In 1998, she co-founded the Seeworth Preparatory Academy in Oklahoma City to help 6th- through 9th-graders, overcome issues like poverty or dysfunctional family situations which impact children's ability to learn. Wilson died after a short illness at her home in Oklahoma City, on July 27, 1999. Legacy Wilson received numerous awards and honors both during her lifetime and posthumously. In 1974, she received the Guy Brown Award to recognize outstanding alumni from the University of Oklahoma and the following year inducted into the OU Hall of Fame. She was inducted into the Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame in 1983 for her service as president of the Oklahoma Association of Women Lawyers, as well as her appointment to the Oklahoma Supreme Court. Wilson was recognized with the Pioneer Woman award in 1985 and named Appellate Judge of the Year in both 1986 and 1989. In 1994, she was named Woman of the Year and in 1996 she was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame.

Scott Castillo, Jr. It follows two groups of people lodging at a mountain resort who are stalked by a mysterious killer potentially linked to a supernatural entity in the mountains. Shot in 1980 in Big Bear, California, Satan's Blade was released on VHS in 1985, and later received Blu-ray releases by Olive Films in the United States in 2015, and by Arrow Films in the United Kingdom in 2016. Plot A pair of female bank robbers make off with $50,000 after they kill two bank tellers in cold blood. They lay low at a snowy mountain cabin resort while waiting to rendezvous with their partner, George. As they wait, one of the robbers gets greedy and shoots the other. She plans to do the same to George when he arrives, but she doesn't get the chance, as she's stabbed in the back by an unseen assailant while dragging her ex-partner's body. Ben, the local sheriff, and another officer arrive at the cabin after gunfire is reported, and discover the bodies. The next day, two married couples arrive at the resort to celebrate one of the men's (Tony) graduation from law school and passing of the bar examination. Simultaneously, a group of college girls also arrive with a friend whose father has recently died. Despite being told of the murders and a local legend about a murderous mountain man who comes from the bottom of a nearby lake, the college girls decide to take the cabin, which is right next door to where the married couples are staying. During the night, one of the young women has a nightmare of a man murdering her and everyone else. The following day, one of the college women, Stephanie, meets Tony on the lake, and the two talk. Stephanie ends up spending the afternoon with Tony, while her friends stay back at their cabin. That night, an unseen killer enters the girls' cabin and systematically stabs each of them to death. Stephanie returns to the cabin later in the evening and discovers all of her friends have been murdered. She retreats to Tony and his friends' cabin, which the killer eventually breaches, murdering everyone inside except for Stephanie, who hides under a bed. The following morning, she emerges from the cabin and meets Sheriff Ben, who embraces her before stabbing her in the stomach. When she asks him why, he admits that he simply wanted the money stowed in the cabin, and that he didn't want to hurt anyone; however, he alternately explains that he is possessed and brandishes a knife that is a talisman. Stephanie flees back into the cabin, but Ben follows, chasing her up the staircase, where he tackles her to the floor and stabs her to death. Afterwards, Ben throws the knife in the lake. Later, a hand emerges from the lake and throws the knife back out, the blade sticking in the side of a tree. A man hiking through the woods notices the knife and dislodges it from the tree bark.

Scott Castillo, Jr. years to finish and get released. The film was shot in Big Bear, California in the spring of 1980 over a period of 33 days. Release Satan's Blade was released on VHS in the United States by Prism Entertainment in October 1985. Diabolique Magazine stated that following the film's release, it \\"mostly existed as a forgotten relic of the VHS era.\\" Olive Films released Satan's Blade on Blu-ray in the United States on May 12, 2015. This release of the film runs 82 minutes in length. In the United Kingdom, the film was submitted for approval by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) in 2016. This version approved by the BBFC was cut at 79 minutes. There, it subsequently received a Blu-ray and DVD combination release from Arrow Films, which runs approximately 83 minutes. Reception In his book The Gorehound's Guide to Splatter Films of the 1980s, Scott Aaron Stine stated that \\"despite cut-rate acting, stilted dialogue, and sometimes-tedious direction, Satan's Blade is surprisingly engaging.\\" His review concluded that the film was \\"pretty typical B-grade slasher fare, even though it's more representative of '70s horror than '80s fare.\\" In Legacy of Blood: A Comprehensive Guide to Slasher Movies, Jim Harper notes: \\"Despite the promise of legendary creatures and supernatural goings-on, this is standard stalk'n'slash stuff, with plenty of point-of-view shots to (unsuccessfully) obscure the killer's identity.\\" Joe Yanick of Diabolique Magazine wrote: \\"Satan's Blade is firmly entrenched in a genre of so-bad-their-good films and it's hard to see how many would flock to this movie without a heavy veneer of irony. This is where the film is the most charming, however, because the film's many failures work in the viewer's favors.\\" On a scale of 1 to 10, HorrorNews.net awarded the film a rating of 6/10. The reviewer noted the film's poor acting, audio, lighting, and film quality; but further stated, \\"unless you are a fan of old school low budget slasher films, this may not be the film for you. otherwise, it is a good example of the genre and the time period.\\" Hysteria Lives! rated the film a negative 1.5 out of 5 stars, stating that although the film had its moments, it was essentially a zero budget copy of the first two Friday the 13th films.

He was born into a Jewish family in Cologne. When he was six, his father died; Carsen was adopted by his stepfather, a lawyer. He went on to study law. In 1938, he moved to London to avoid persecution by the Nazis; his parents fled to the Netherlands but were later sent to their deaths at Auschwitz. Although a refugee, he was arrested as an enemy alien by the British and sent to a prison camp in Canada. Carsen avoided talking about this time in his life. In 1943, he got a job grinding optical lenses in Toronto. Later that year, he married Clementine Nahm. He volunteered to join the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, at which time he adopted the surname Carsen; his original surname is not known. In 1945, he started a distribution business for cameras and optical equipment. In 1949, he became the Canadian distributor for Olympus. The company became the largest independent supplier in its field in Canada. Carsen sold the business in 1962 but continued to be involved with real estate, property development and other investments. Carsen and his wife had two children: Johanni and Robert. In 1975, he separated from his wife; the couple never divorced. Carsen was a major support of the National Ballet of Canada, the Shaw Festival and the Art Gallery of Ontario. He contributed to the ballet's Walter Carsen Centre and the gallery's Walter Carsen Reading Room, which were named in his honour. He also helped finance the ballet's Dancer Transition Resource Centre and the National Ballet School's artist-in- residence program. He supported 12 new productions for the ballet and its 1991 For the Glory of Mozart dance festival. Carsen also supported art galleries in Hamilton, Windsor, St. Catharines and Oshawa and the Canadian Opera Company. In 2001, he established the Canada Council for the Arts' Walter Carsen Prize for Excellence in the Performing Arts. He also established the Walter Carsen Fund for the Homeless through the United Way Toronto and York Region. In 1993, he was awarded the Montblanc de la Culture Arts Patronage Award. In 2002, he received the International Society for the Performing Arts Foundation Angel Award. In 2000, he received the Ramon John Hnatyshyn Award for Voluntarism in the Performing Arts.

Her sister was lyric soprano Natalia Semyonovna Youshkevitch. The family left Russia in 1921, settling in Paris where they became French citizens. Youshkevitch trained with former ballerinas of the Mariinsky Theatre Olga Preobrajenska, and Lubov Egorova, and with French choreographer and ballet master Leo Staats. She also studied at the √âcole du Louvre; and graduated in piano from the Conservatoire de Paris. Youshkevitch was a protegee of Bronislava Nijinska, who in 1930 brought her into the corps de ballet of the Op√©ra Russe √† Paris. Staats also employed her in works that he staged for the summer season on the C√¥te d'Azure, including ballets on a floating, open-air stage; and in the Walpurgisnacht ballet in Faust, at the Nice Opera. In 1934, Youshkevitch joined the Th√©√¢tre de la Danse Nijinska where she made her debut as La Dame en Bleu in the ballet Les Biches; performed as the Bride in Le Baiser de la F√©e; and danced en travesti among the men in Nijinska's Bolero. Along with other members of Nijinska's company, Youshkevitch went on to join the Ballets Russes for its 1934 Monte Carlo season. There she danced the Waltz in Les Sylphides, and appeared among the Amazones and Russian peasants in Nijinska's Variations. Youshkevitch was a principal dancer on the Ballets Russes' first tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1936-1937. Here she starred as the Princess in Nijinska's ballet Les Cent Baisers, as Odette in Le Lac des Cygnes, and as Aurora in Aurora's Wedding. She danced the role of the Principal Nymph in Vaslav Nijinsky's L'Apr√®s-midi d'un faune; appeared as Action in L√©onide Massine's Les Pr√©sages; and played leading roles in Massine's Les Contes Russes and in Michel Fokine's Carnaval and Les Sylphides. British dance critic Arnold Haskell, who accompanied the tour, wrote of her: \\"As a dancer the most astonishing was Nina Youchkevitch...she has an unusual sense of music and the grand manner that made her performances in Aurora's Wedding and The Swan Lake absolutely unforgettable...Among the younger dancers of this company she is the one obvious hundred percent classical ballerina.\\" She followed her mentor, Nijinska, to Poland in 1937, where the latter founded the Balet Polski aka Les Ballets Polonais aka The Polish Ballets. In this company, which won Grand Prix for performance and for choreography at the Exposition Internationale in Paris that year, Youshkevitch created principal roles in the ballets Concerto de Chopin, Apollon et la Belle, and Le Rappel. The troupe went on to perform in London and in Berlin. Youshkevitch remained with the company after Nijinska's departure, performing with them at the 1939 World's Fair in New York City. Narrowly escaping from Poland before the Nazi invasion, Youshkevitch returned to Paris. Nijinska invited her to reprise her role in Chopin Concerto at the Hollywood Bowl in 1940. Though Nijinska's telegram did not reach her until the concert had already taken place, it enabled Youshkevitch to receive a visa to travel to America; and she performed again in Chopin Concerto at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in 1942. In the United States, she toured with the Polish company of Felix Sadowski; and performed with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet. She appeared as Aurora in The Sleeping Beauty, sponsored by the San Francisco Russian Opera and Ballet Association in 1945. Billed as the first full-length production of Petipa's ballet in the United States, in three acts and a prologue; it was the first full-length Sleeping Beauty on the West Coast. After retiring from the stage because of an injury, Youshkevitch began teaching at Nijinska's Hollywood Dance Studio; and at the Carnegie Hall studios in New York. She founded her own concert group called The Nina Youshkevitch Ballet Workshop, in New York City. After her marriage, she taught for 13 years at Wayne State College, in Wayne, Nebraska. She opened her own dance school, also called the Nina Youshkevitch Ballet Workshop,in New York City in 1978; and continued to teach there until shortly before her death. Among her students was Jennie Somogyi, later a principal with New York City Ballet. In 1990, Youshkevitch assisted Irina Nijinska, in reviving the Bride's Variation from Le Baiser de la F√©e, at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. In 1995, working from notations, Youshkevitch revived Bronislava Nijinska's ballet Bolero for the Oakland Ballet, in California. She went on to revive Chopin Concerto for the students of Goucher College, in Towson, Maryland, in 1995-1996; and staged the ballet's second movement pas de deux for the Oakland Ballet in 1997. She was preparing to stage the full Chopin Concerto for the Oakland Ballet when she died. She married Robert Johnson, and they had one son, who in 1998 was dance critic for The Newark Star-Ledger.

Two species were named as type species for the genus in separate publications by the same authors in the same year (1974). The first paper named Misikella longidentata, while the second named Misikella posthernsteini. Most species assigned to Misikella have a Norian-Rhaetian distribution and a bimembrate conodont apparatus, including M. posthernsteini. On the other hand, M. longidentata has a Carnian-Norian distribution and a tetramembrate apparatus. F√•hr√¶us & Ryley (1989) retained the name Misikella for only M. longidentata, placing the rest of the species into the new genus Axiothea. However, other conodont specialists utilize the name Misikella primarily in the context of M. posthernsteini and other bimembrate species, rather than M. longidentata.  Use in stratigraphy  The top of the Norian (the base of the Rhaetian, stages of the Upper Triassic) is close to the first appearance of several species of Misikella, as well as Epigondolella mosheri. In 2010, the Norian-Rhaetian boundary was defined by the first appearance of Misikella posthernsteini.

It is based on the scientific method and combines experiential learning with the three building blocks of a successful lean startup: Alexander Osterwalder's \\"Business Model Canvas\\", Steve Blank's \\"Customer Development Model\\", and Agile Engineering. Students of Lean LaunchPad propose and immediately test business hypotheses. They get out of the building to talk with prospective customers and partners, using this customer feedback acquired in these interviews to refine their product or service; ensure their product or service meets a customer need or solves a customer problem; and validate that they have created a repeatable, scalable business model.  Methodology  Lean LaunchPad pedagogy combines three elements: a Flipped Classroom, Experiential learning and Team-based learning. During the course, students interview potential customers in order to validate or invalidate their hypotheses, as expressed in the Business Model Canvas. Students listen to recorded lectures and presentations before each class, and use class time to present what they learned from customer interviews the previous week. Students present their findings which creates the basis for discussion, critiques, and brain-storming by both professors and students. As of 2016, the Lean LaunchPad is taught in more than 200 universities worldwide and more than 300,000 people have signed up for a free online version of the class.

Labienus Parthicus Imp.\\" The horse on the reverse alludes to Labienus' Parthian cavalry.Eckhel, vol. V, p. 146. The gens Labiena was a plebeian family at Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned during the final century of the Republic.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 696 (\\"Labienus\\"). Origin The Labieni were long supposed to have been part of the Atia gens, of which Labienus was supposed to be a cognomen. This first seems to have been proposed by the Ciceronian scholar Paulus Manutius, but his conjecture is not clearly supported by any ancient author, nor is there any other evidence that the Labieni were part of another gens.Spanheim, vol. II, pp. 11, 12. Notwithstanding the lack of evidence, many other scholars have continued to regard the Labieni as a family of the Atii.Orelli, Onomasticon Tullianum. Members * Quintus Labienus, one of the supporters of the tribune Lucius Appuleius Saturninus, who took refuge in the Capitol when Appuleius was declared a public enemy, and was stoned to death, along with Appuleius and his other supporters after their arrest.Cicero, Pro Rabirio, 5, 7. * Titus Labienus, as tribune of the plebs, accused Gaius Rabirius of perduellio at the urging of Caesar, and helped repeal a law of Sulla, clearing the way for Caesar to be elected Pontifex Maximus. He served as Caesar's legate during the Gallic Wars, but was afterward seduced by the Pompeian party, and fought more with malice and cruelty than with ability, until he fell at Munda in 45 BC. * Quintus Labienus Durus, a military tribune killed during Caesar's second expedition to Britain, is a mistake for Quintus Laberius Durus, whose name Orosius confused with that of Labienus, Caesar's legate. This error was followed by Bede and Geoffrey of Monmouth.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 696 (\\"Q. Laberius Durus\\"). * Quintus Labienus T. f., a supporter of Brutus and Cassius after the murder of Caesar. Following the Battle of Philippi, he obtained the aid of Orodes II of Parthia, and took control of much of Anatolia, before he was defeated and put to flight by Publius Ventidius, the legate of Marcus Antonius. He was apprehended in Cilicia and put to death.Cassius Dio, xlviii. 24‚Äì36, 39, 40.Livy, Epitome, cxxvii.Florus, iv. 9.Velleius Paterculus, ii. 78.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Antonius\\", 30, 33.Appian, Bellum Civile v. 65, 133.Justin, xlii. 4. * Titus Labienus, the historian, was probably the son or grandson of Caesar's legate. He was a skilled orator, and an ardent opponent of Augustus, who did little to hinder his activities, although Labienus carefully avoided publishing materials that the emperor might deem libelous. Eventually the Senate decreed that all of his works should be burnt, and rather than suffer this indignity, he shut himself in his family's tombs, and perished. * Labienus, who had taken part in the proscriptions of Sulla, was proscribed by the triumvirs in 43 BC. Rather than going into hiding, he sat in front of his house, and waited for his assassins.Appian, Bellum Civile, iv. 26. * Labienus, likewise proscribed, concealed himself from the triumvirs. His freedmen refused to reveal his hiding place, even under torture.Macrobius, Saturnalia, i. 11.

From scene to scene, it manages to maintain a certain tone and build up the tension. But it‚Äôs all in service of a narrative that doesn‚Äôt have any thematic follow-through. The film builds so much moral ambiguity, and there‚Äôs so much left to dissect as the film raises the volume on the music and jumps to its conclusion. This is a sharp piece of filmmaking, but what it ends up saying through its abandonment of its complexity is questionable at best.\\" Nazamel Tabares of Movies Philippines rated the film 4 stars out of 5 and wrote that \\"Dukot might not be as thrilling or as meaty as the themes it tackles, but it is a well-made suspense thriller that doesn‚Äôt come often in Philippine cinemas. It lacks power in its narrative even though it hints some every now and then, but the shots are tastefully done and the story is decent enough that you get to feel the tense of the situation and what the characters are going through emotionally. Well, some of it.\\" Rey de la Cruz Jr. of FHM Philippines rated the film 7.5 out of 10 describing the film as \\"a well-directed suspense thriller about a real-life kidnapping. Nice to see an actor like Enrique Gil finally show off his acting skills.\\" Oggs Cruz of Rappler in a less positive review wrote that \\"the film‚Äôs failure really lies in its misdirected ambitions. It only provokes partially, quickly retreating from its hefty provocations just when the opportunity to get darker and more vicious opens up. Again, it‚Äôs all interesting in premise. Everything else is just too safe.\\" Kevin Tan of Film Police Reviews rated the film 3 stars out of 5 and wrote that \\"Dukot can be commended on injecting fresh ideas into the local mainstream industry, and it shows Soriano‚Äôs maturity in his craft. However, the script lacks the guts to deliver a story as dark and gritty as its visuals. Dukot holds back on depicting hostility and violence that could have rendered audiences more upset and unsettled about today‚Äôs reality the moment they exit theaters.\\" Full Cast & Crew *Starring: Enrique Gil, Ricky Davao, Shaina Magdayao, Bing Pimentel, Christopher de Leon, Candy Pangilinan, Bangs Garcia, Ping Medina, Alex Medina, & Dindo Arroyo *Directed by: Paul Soriano *Produced by: Paul Soriano, Charo Santos-Concio, & Malou Santos *Music by: Robbie Factoran & Ricardo Juco *Written by: Mark Victor & Jaqueline Franquelli (as Jaqueline V.

The attacker's mother praised her son as a martyr defending Jerusalem and the al-Aqsa Mosque and hoped others would follow in his path.Watch: Mother of Kiryat Arba terrorist proud of 'martyr' son Ari Soffer, 30/06/16 Israel National News A banner with pictures of Tra'ayra and the late Yasser Arafat was hung outside a building in the West Bank village of Tra'ayra's family, and the family is eligible for $350 a month from a Palestinian fund for martyrs.Israel puts Palestinians on defensive over 'martyrs' fund' July 11, 2016 Aftermath =Consequences for Palestinian communities and perpetrator's family= According to the Los Angeles Times, in direct response to this murder, Israel launched \\"a clampdown on hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in nearby Hebron and its surrounding villages, the likes of which hasn‚Äôt been seen in years.\\" According to the New York Times, in response to this and other attacks, Israel announced that it would \\"deduct from the tax revenues it collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority an unspecified amount equivalent to what the authority pays in stipends to the families of people who carry out terrorist acts.\\" The Israeli army locked down Tra'ayra's hometown, and \\"sealed off\\" roads leading to Hebron for a time in response to this and other attacks that occurred within a brief time span. His father was arrested and two of his siblings, Tamer and Lara Tra‚Äôayra, were detained while proceedings were underway for charging them with incitement on the grounds that they had posted messages favoring \\"martyrs\\" on social media.Arrangements were made to demolish his family's home. =Political impact= Following the attack the Israeli government appropriated $12.9m to \\"strengthen\\" the settlement of Kiryat Arba and the Israeli settlers in nearby Hebron. The funds will be used for social projects, education and for increased security. The money will be paid from the budgets of several Ministries. The plan features the construction of 42 new homes in Kiryat Arba. The Palestinian Authority was put \\"on the defensive\\" over its policy of paying a monthly stipend of $350 to the family of Hallel Ariel's killer, as it does for the families of all Palestinian \\"martyrs\\", drawing on the Palestinian Authority Martyrs Fund, which is dedicated to that purpose. Prime Minister Netanyahu calls the payments \\"an incentive for murder\\". The Israeli government, describing the payments as glorifying terrorism, responded to this attack with an announcement that it will deduct the value of \\"Martyr\\" payments from the tax revenue it pays to the Palestinian Authority. The Fund, established in 1967 by the Palestinian Liberation Organization makes payments to 35,000 families, including the families of suicide bombers, from an annual budget of $170 million in 2016. =Official responses= * : Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu paid the bereaved family a visit of condolence. * : The French foreign ministry condemned \\"the horrific murder of a young Israeli girl,\\" and extended \\"heartfelt condolences to her family.\\" Legacy Three years after the murder, Hallel Yaffa's mother, Rena Ariel, and her aunt, Tziporah Plitz, published a graphic biography in Hebrew and English editions.

Location The Apu√≠ Mosaic is divided between the municipalities of Apu√≠ (91.85%) and Novo Aripuan√£ (8.15%) in the state of Amazonas. It covers an area of . The mosaic is accessible by air to Apu√≠, by land via the BR-230 Trans-Amazonian Highway or by boat via the Madeira River to the city of Novo Aripuan√£ and then to the conservation units via the Aripuan√£ River. The mosaic contains the Guariba and Sucunduri State Parks; Bararati and Aripuan√£ sustainable development reserves; Guariba Extractive Reserve; and Sucunduri, Aripuan√£, Apu√≠ and Manicor√© state forests. The mosaic, together with the Juruena and Campos Amaz√¥nicos national parks, forms a contiguous block of of protected areas known as the Southern Amazon Ecological Corridor, which covers parts of southern Amazonas, northern Mato Grosso and southwestern Par√°. These are areas with strong deforestation pressure due to expansion of the agricultural frontier into the Brazilian Amazon. History The Apu√≠ Mosaic was created by decree 55 of 12 March 2010 under the responsibility of CEUC in the border region between the states of Amazonas, Mato Grosso and Par√°. The advisory board was created by the same decree. The management plan was approved on 22 September 2010. The plan was treated as the plan for each of the nine conservation units as well as for the mosaic as a whole, on the basis that the units represented a pre-zoning of the mosaic into areas with different objectives and types of use. The integrated plan would help correct errors in delimitation of the units as better information was obtained, and would prevent actions in one unit having negative effect on another unit. Environment The mosaic includes terra firma forest, flooded forest, campos rupestres, campina and campinarana. It contains the headwaters of the Acari and Sucunduri rivers. The Monte Cristo rapids and the Falls (Saltos do Rio Sucunduri) are well-known attractions. The region has more than 13 endemic species of primates. Surveys of the west of the mosaic have identified 850 tree species, 46 mammals, more than 300 birds, 27 reptiles, 30 amphibians and almost 100 species of fish.

Life George was born on 8 September 1758, the son of Thomas Ryves, of a long-established Dorset family, by his second wife, Anna Maria, daughter of Daniel Graham. He received his early education at Harrow, and in February 1774 was entered on board the Plymouth guard ship . In April 1775 he joined , going out to the West Indies as flagship of Vice-Admiral James Young, and shortly after arriving on the station was appointed to command the tender Tartar, carrying eight guns and a crew of thirty-three men. In her he had the fortune to capture upwards of fifty prizes, some of them privateers of superior force. In May 1778 the Portland returned to England, and in May 1779 Ryves joined , the flagship of Vice-Admiral Mariot Arbuthnot, who in September appointed him acting-lieutenant of the armed ship . His lieutenant's commission was confirmed on 18 November 1780, and in December he was appointed to on the Jamaica station. In her he returned to England in 1782, and early in 1783 he was appointed to , which sailed for the East Indies; but, having been dismasted in a gale in the Bay of Biscay, was obliged to put back and, consequent on the peace, was paid off and Ryves placed on half-pay. In the armament of 1787 he was appointed first lieutenant of the frigate , and in January 1795 to on the coast of France. On 4 July 1795 he was promoted to the command of , then in the West Indies, and went out to her as a passenger in . On arriving at St. Lucia, in the absence of the Bulldog, Ryves volunteered for service with the seamen landed under the command of Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian for the reduction of the island, and rendered important assistance in the making of roads and the transporting of heavy guns. He afterwards joined the Bulldog, in which he returned to England in September 1797.

In the following year the Agincourt was one of the fleet with Lord Keith on the coast of Egypt, and in March 1802 Ryves was sent with a small squadron to receive the cession of Corfu. Afterwards, on intelligence that the French were preparing to seize on the island of La Maddalena, he was sent there to prevent the encroachment. The intelligence proved to be incorrect; but while waiting there Ryves carried out a survey of the roadstead, then absolutely unknown, and by his chart Nelson, in the following year, was led to make it his base, calling it, in compliment to Ryves, Agincourt Sound. In May 1803 Ryves was moved to , in which he remained in the Mediterranean, under Nelson's command, till the summer of 1804, when the Gibraltar, being almost worn out, was sent home and paid off.

It is a large brick building whose construction started in 1230, and whose architecture influenced the development of the Gothique m√©ridional (Southern French Gothic) style. The relics of Thomas Aquinas are housed there. In the two centuries following the dissolution of the Dominican Order at the time of the French Revolution, it served various different purposes before undergoing major restoration in the 20th century. In the early 21st century, it was partially converted into a museum. Name The name Jacobins is the nickname that was given to the Dominican Order in the Middle Ages. Their first convent in Paris was located in the rue Saint-Jacques, (Latin Jacobus), and that name came to be attached to the order itself.Le couvent des Jacobins History =First church= In Languedoc in the early 13th century, Catharism, which the Catholic Church considered a heresy, was strong and growing.\\"Cathar country\\", \\"About France\\" In 1215, the future Saint Dominic founded in Toulouse a small community of monastic preachers to combat the heresy, and starting in 1230, the friars began the construction of a small church in which to preach. Full text at archive.org Built entirely of pink Roman brick, this first building was half as long and half as high as the present church, and very simple in design, in line with the order's vow of poverty. It consisted of a double nave, one side for the friars, and one for the congregation, separated by pillars and screens. =Expansion= The \\"Palm Tree\\" Over the next century, as congregations grew, the church was enlarged and embellished. Between 1245 and 1252, it was extended with the addition of a choir with side chapels. Between 1275 and 1292, the height of the choir was increased, and a vaulted roof constructed. In response to the technical difficulty posed by creating a vaulted roof for the new space, the builders installed one oversized column in the centre from which the ribs radiated outwards in all directions. This feature has come to be known as Le Palmier des Jacobins, the palm tree of the Jacobins. Between 1275 and 1315, the height of the choir was increased, and high windows created above the chapels. The seven-storey bell tower was also added at this time. Starting in 1325, a new, higher vaulted roof was constructed for the nave in order to bring it into line with the choir. The last component of the century-long expansion of the church was the construction of the chapel of Saint Antonin (separate from the church itself), between 1335 and 1341. =Relics= The reliquary of Thomas Aquinas Thomas Aquinas, author of the Summa Theologiae and canonised in 1323, was a member of the Dominican order. In 1368 Pope Urban V decreed that his remains be transferred from Italy where he died to the Jacobins, the mother church of the order. When they arrived in 1369, they were placed in a stone reliquary beside the altar. After being moved to Saint Sernin at the time of the Revolution, they were returned to the Jacobins in 1974 when the restoration of the church was complete.Les reliques de Saint Thomas D¬¥Aquin =Dissolution= Following the French Revolution of 1789, the Dominican order was banned, and the friars forced to leave. In 1804 the conventual complex including the church became the property of the city of Toulouse, and in 1810 the emperor Napoleon requisitioned the church and converted it into a barracks. Floors were installed to create upper storeys for dormitories, while stables and an armoury occupied the ground floor. During the period the building served as a barracks, the stained glass windows were destroyed, and the medieval paintings in the choir were painted over with whitewash. Un monument en peril; la p√©riode noire =Monument and museum= Citizens who were appalled at the destruction succeeded in 1861 in convincing the army to move to new barracks. In succeeding years, the building housed an exhibition of Arts and Industries (1865), served as a playground for the pupils of the nearby Lyc√©e Fermat starting in 1872, and as a place to safely store treasures from the museums of Paris during World War I. Several periods of restoration work were undertaken over the course of the 20th century. In 1905 the floors installed by the army were removed; starting in 1923 blocked windows were uncovered and stained glass installed; between 1953 and 1963 the chapels were reconstructed; and between 1965 and 1974 the whitewash covering the medieval murals was removed. Today the building functions as a museum. Architecture The round arch at the base of the south side is a vestige of the original romanesque church, while the three solid buttresses correspond to the double- nave layout of the interior which was retained as the church grew. Otherwise the Jacobins is considered a leader in the development of the Gothique m√©ridional (Southern French Gothic) style. One of the most typical characteristics is the fact that it is constructed entirely of brick. Also characteristic is the style of the south wall between the buttresses. Each section consists of a tall Gothic ogival (pointed) arch with a small rose window at the top, and below that a lancet window. The spaces between the buttresses of the nave also show the same ogival arch, in which is set a tall, narrow triple-lancet window. There is hardly any decoration, which is considered to have been a conscious choice aimed at differentiating this church from the highly elaborate Gothic of northern France.Toulouse √âglise des Jacobins de Couvent des Jacobins de Toulouse, Historique The nave also served as a model in the development of Southern French Gothic architecture in presenting a very unified space. The double-nave layout, however, one side for the friars and the other for the congregation, turned out to be inconvenient and was not imitated, whereas the choice of columns to support the Gothic vaulted roof was. Each slender column, only 1.4 metres (4 feet 7 inches) in diameter for a height of 28 metres (92 feet), including 22 metres for the stone shaft (72 feet), supports eight of the ribs of the vaulted ceiling, and the six columns divide the nave into six bays. A seventh column continuing the same line supports the 22 ribs of the vaulted roof of the choir, the famous Palm Tree. This masterpiece is considered a precursor to the complex structures of the later Gothic. Jacobins-05(1).jpgSouthern French Gothic architecture (13th c.)

He was the owner of the journal La Grande Revue and manager of the Th√©√¢tre des Arts and the Paris Opera.  Biography  He was born to a Protestant family. His father, Eug√®ne, was a mathematician who devised what is now known as Rouch√©'s theorem. After studies at the √âcole Polytechnique and the Institut d'√©tudes politiques de Paris, he worked for several different ministries and was appointed head of security at the Exposition Universelle (1889).\\"Jacques Rouch√© (1882), homme de th√©√¢tre et de musique\\" by Dominique Garban @ La Jaune et la Rouge. He always had a passion for the theater and began writing comedies while still in school. In 1891, he travelled to Vienna, Budapest and Bayreuth to get a first- hand look at the workings of professional theaters. In 1893, however, his career took an unexpected turn when he married Berthe Piver, heiress to the perfumery, and he soon became an entrepreneur.Brief biography @ Forum Op√©ra. First, he worked to modernize the company by holding a competition for young chemical engineers who would later develop some of the first synthetic fragrances. He then introduced scented sample cards and slowly expanded the company, opening branches as far-flung as New York, Buenos Aires and Hong Kong. Eventually, half the company's product was exported. After he had amassed a small fortune, he became a patron of the arts. Th√©√¢tre des Arts, now the Th√©√¢tre H√©bertot In 1907, he acquired La Grande Revue, a legal publication founded in 1897 by Fernand Labori (who had been defense counsel for Lucy Dreyfus and √âmile Zola) and turned it into a cultural journal. He published essays, critiques, short stories and theatrical pieces by Gide, D'Annunzio, Shaw and many others. His regular contributors included Maurice Denis and George Desvalli√®res (painting), Jacques Copeau (theater), Romain Rolland (music), Andr√© Suar√®s (literature) and Gaston Doumergue (politics). It was published bimonthly until 1940. = Th√©√¢tre des Arts = In 1910, he rented the Th√©√¢tre des Arts (now the Th√©√¢tre H√©bertot) for three seasons. Although a novice, he quickly assembled a troop; presenting ballets and operas as well as drama and comedy. He also applied his theories of set decoration, which he had described in his long essay L‚ÄôArt th√©√¢tral moderne, by engaging painters who had never worked in the theater before; notably Maxime Dethomas, Andr√© Dunoyer de Segonzac, Charles Gu√©rin and . One of his greatest successes was an adaptation of The Brothers Karamazov, created by Jacques Copeau, Charles Dullin and Louis Jouvet. The 1912 season was devoted to dance, featuring works by d'Indy, Schmitt, Dukas and Ravel. = The Paris Opera = Palais Garnier, home of the Paris Opera His work attracted the attention of officials in the French government who were looking to replace Andr√© Messager as head of the Paris Opera. When his appointment was announced in the Journal officiel of November 1913, it was greeted with some derision. A few critics claimed that he was chosen simply because his wealth would help the Opera overcome its chronic deficits. In fact, during the thirty years of his tenure, he contributed over 20 million Francs of his own money to keep the Opera functioning and came close to resigning over the issue in 1932. In 1914, he undertook a tour of the major European opera halls, meeting with managers, directors, engineers, designers and composers to seek their advice. He formally took office in September 1914, when the Palais Garnier closed its doors due to the war and remained closed for eighteen months. After much difficulty, he was finally able to present a short ballet by Igor Stravinsky called The Bees. During the war, he presented several Baroque operas that met with little success. After the war, he turned to contemporary works by French and foreign composers, such as Honegger, Poulenc, Strauss and Prokofiev. In 1924, he was elected to a seat at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts and named a Commander in the Legion of Honor.Documentation @ the Base L√©onore. Following the dissolution of the Ballets Russes, he obtained the appointment of Serge Lifar as master of the Paris Opera Ballet in 1930, restoring dance to its former place of importance there.\\"La modernit√© √† l‚ÄôOp√©ra\\" @ BnF Chroniques. Despite Rouch√©'s best efforts, the deficits continued to worsen and, by 1936, it was clear that major reforms were needed. In 1939, at the suggestion of Jean Zay, the French government created the \\"\\" (RTLN), which combined the Paris Opera with the Op√©ra-Comique and made them government agencies, relieving them from the need of trying to make a profit. Rouch√© became the overall administrator of the new organization with Philippe Gaubert directing the Opera and Henri B√ºsser managing the Op√©ra-Comique. = The occupation and after= During the Occupation, the Vichy Government sought to control the Opera, while Rouch√© and his associates fought to retain some independence. Most of the members of the company and the orchestra had sought refuge in Cahors, but were ordered back to Paris in July 1940. Rouch√©, already past retirement at 78 years old, wanted to give up his position but was convinced to stay by his staff, who feared that a Nazi administrator might replace him. During this time, he focused on operas from the classical French repertoire (Berlioz, Massenet, Gounod and the like) but had to placate German authorities; offering appearances by the Berlin Philharmonic and presentations of Wagnerian operas. He also fought a constant battle to keep the Jewish members of his staff, paying their wages himself after they were officially dismissed. Following Liberation, he was called upon to explain his actions during the war because they were considered to have been too conciliatory. Although his staff and various union members testified on his behalf, he was relieved of his position in January 1945. He remained active in cultural affairs and, in 1951, was rehabilitated; becoming the honorary Director of the RTLN. He died at his mansion in 1957, aged ninety-five. In 2007, the Biblioth√®que nationale de France organized an exposition in his honor, called \\"La modernit√© √† l‚ÄôOp√©ra : Jacques Rouch√© (1914-1945)\\".

It has been used for staining cell nuclei either as a part of the classical Unna- Pappenheim stain, or as a nuclear counterstain ever since. In recent years, its fluorescent properties when bound to DNA have positioned it useful for far-red imaging of live cell nuclei. Fluorescent DNA staining is routinely used in cancer prognosis. Methyl green also emerges as an alternative stain for DNA in agarose gels, fluorometric assays and flow cytometry. It has also been shown that it can be used as an exclusion viability stain for cells. Its interaction with DNA has been shown to be non- intercalating, in other words not inserting itself into the DNA, but instead electrostatic with the DNA major groove. It is used in combination with pyronin in the methyl green‚Äìpyronin stain which stains and differentiates DNA and RNA. When excited at 244 or 388 nm in neutral aqueous solution, methyl green produces a fluorescent emission at 488 or 633 nm respectively. The presence or absence of DNA does not effect these fluorescence behaviors. When binding DNA under neutral aqueous conditions, methyl green also becomes fluorescent in the far red with an excitation maximum of 633 nm and an emission maximum of 677 nm.

The song is composed in time and the key of A minor, with a driving beat tempo of 120 beats per minute and a chord progression of F(add2)‚ÄìAm‚ÄìC/G. Lipa's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of D5. The track begins slowly, with Lipa vocally whispering. It builds up to where Lipa is enunciating every lyric. The chorus is mostly instrumental, featuring electronic sounds and a dance beat. The middle eight contains a breakdown, where Lipa vocally hits her high notes. The track has a contemporary dance-heavy production with house synth chords and a bassline rumble. Lyrically, the song contains Tumblr-inspired lyrics about an intense relationship that could crash at any second. Release and promotion \\"Last Dance\\" premiered on 8 February 2016 via Annie Mac's BBC Radio 1 show. The song was released for digital download and streaming the following day through Lipa's independent record label, Dua Lipa Limited, as the third single from her eponymous debut studio album. It was serviced to contemporary hit radio stations in the United Kingdom on 4 March 2016. \\"Last Dance\\" also received remixes by Coucheron and Stefan Ponce. The song was intended to be the second track on the album but was ultimately removed from the standard track listing and included as the closing track on the deluxe edition, released 2 June 2017. In 2018, the song was included in an advert for Lipa's campaign with Jaguar, titled \\"Join The Pace\\".

Kim Taylor Bennett of Vice compared the song to the works of Rihanna, calling it \\"ballsy\\" and \\"beautiful.\\" She went on to praise Lipa's vocal flexibility, writing her voice is \\"powerful one minute and a magnetically vulnerable the next.\\" Writing for Pulse Media, Jessica Boyle also compared the song to Rihanna and categorized the lyrics as \\"standalone,\\" and Lipa's voice as \\"smokey.\\" She concluded that it would sound nice with a club remix. In The Irish Times, Ailbhe Malone praised the song's production and lyrics mix, while comparing the breakdown in the middle eight to Cashmere Cat. Idolator's Bianca Gracie called \\"Last Dance\\" a \\"flirty [tune]\\" that will \\"immediately hit you at your waistline,\\" courtesy of Lipa's \\"sultry and bold\\" vocals. She went on to call the production \\"fluttering\\" and the song as a whole a \\"solid future festival staple.\\" For A Bit of Pop Music, Michiel Vos praised Lipa's vocal abilities and compared the chorus to Justin Bieber's Purpose (2015), and Major Lazer.

He was a part of the team's ownership for just one season, selling in his share in 1968. Block rejoined the ownership group in 1971, though, and kept his stake until the team went bankrupt in 1975. He relocated to California in the mid-1980s to start a business venture and died on December 13, 2015 at his home in Santa Monica from cancer. Pittsburgh Penguins Block and Jack McGregor, a Republican Pennsylvania State Senator from Pittsburgh, came up with the idea for the club in 1965, during a car trip along the Pennsylvania Turnpike when they heard the NHL planned to expand from six to 12 teams. Block stated to McGregor that in order for Pittsburgh to be a true sports town, in needed to have an NHL team. The two men, who were classmates at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, gathered together a group of investors, that included HJ Heinz II, Art Rooney, and Richard Scaife, and made their successful proposal to the NHL. Pittsburgh was awarded a franchise and McGregor and Block each owned a 12.5 percent share of the team. According to McGregor, Block initially laughed to him for McGregor's wife, Carol, coming up with the name \\"Penguins\\". Block argued against the name and favored naming the club the Hornets, from Pittsburgh's long-time and successful affiliate in the American Hockey League. Block, and several other Penguins' investors, also purchased a second professional franchise in 1967, the Pittsburgh Phantoms, a soccer team in the non-FIFA sanctioned National Professional Soccer League. The club played for just one season folded before the 1968 NASL season due to poor attendance, drawing only an average of 3,122. The Phantoms' financial losses also tapped out Block and many of the Penguins' investors. Aside from his ownership duties, Block was also the team's vice president and chief operating officer during the season. At end of the team's inaugural season, Block relinquished his share in the team. However he rejoined the ownership group in 1971. During his ownership tenure, Block would bring his stepchildren to the team Christmas party, and his wife, Ida, even gave guitar lessons to former Penguins winger Bob \\"Battleship\\" Kelly. At the end of the Penguins' 1974-75 season, the team filed for bankruptcy. The ownership group had been negotiating a plan to keep the team while beginning to pay $532,000 in overdue withholding taxes, however a local management change in the team. On June 12, 1975, IRS agents walked into the Pittsburgh Civic Arena and placed a tax lien against the Penguins. Meanwhile Equibank, the Penguins' largest creditor, had filed a $5 million suit against the club. Penguins were eventually sold for a mere $3.8 million to a group that included Wren Blair, ending Block's stake in the team. When the Penguins declared bankruptcy again in the late 1990s, Block expressed hope that the Pens would be rescued stating \\"It's very, very scary to see this happening to the Penguins again, after all, it was my idea and I want to see it succeed forever\\". Personal Block was survived by his wife, Donna, and their daughter, Jennifer. He was also survived by his ex-wife Ida and three stepchildren.

Significant features of the Typhoon H may be summarized as follows * Ready to fly * 3-axis anti-vibration gimbal camera with full 360¬∞ rotation, up to 4k resolution * Retractable landing gear * Front facing ultrasonic collision detection with optional INTEL REALSENSE collision avoidance * Folding rotor arms * Remote control incorporating built in 7\\" Android Tablet * 22 minutes flight time * Choice of 5.8 GHz or 2.4 GHz radio transmission * ST16 radio transmitter with built in video streaming feed directly from Typhoon H * CGO3+ 4K lens camera * Autonomous flight with way points, orbit mode, follow me mode, and tracking mode * GPS (Global Positioning System) * Return to home feature which enables the pilot to press return to home and the Typhoon H will fly and land back at its starting point * Altitude and position holding * 5 rotor mode which enables the pilot to land safely if one motor is damaged during flight * Durable and quality carbon fiber/hard plastic material The Typhoon H is considered an upgrade to the DJI Phantom 3 and 4 and Spreading Wings model line as well as the DJI Inspire Pro and is designed specifically for aerial photography and cinematography. An upgraded version of the Typhoon H that includes a vision based collision avoidance system called 'Intel RealSense' was demonstrated at the CES 2016 trade show. A key reason why the Typhoon H has been successful in the aerial cinematography world and is often preferred to models like DJI's Phantom and Inspire, is because of the built in Android Tablet to the 2.4ghz transmitter. This provides built in telemetry and direct camera streaming. The drone is also known for its unusually high camera quality out of the box which companies such as DJI have lacked. Although the range on the Typhoon H is not as far as the DJI Phantom lineup, many professional cinematographers have said they prefer the low latency transmission http://www.rcmodelreviews.com/what_is_latency.shtml which DJI does not offer. Both drones do operate with full control well beyond eyesight.

The album was recorded in Los Angeles at the same time that Armstrong filmed his brief appearance in the film Hello, Dolly!. Disney Songs the Satchmo Way featured Armstrong's last trumpet recordings. Armstrong had been personally asked by Walt Disney to make the album in 1966, although it was not completed until after Disney's death. The Disney music executive Jimmy Johnson recalled that \\"The dates with Louis were among the happiest I can remember. He had been quite ill but had gone on a rigorous diet. He was very thin but looked well and was full of energy\\". Armstrong later wrote to Camarata to say that \\"This goldarned \\"Wish Upon a Star\\" is so beautiful and more than that, man ‚Äì I listen to that tune three or four times a night. Man, did you know I'm a doggoned long-time wishing cat? Well, I am man...I haven't enjoyed anything better than our recording sessions since ‚Äì well I can't remember when\\". Reception Scott Yanow reviewed the reissue of the album for Allmusic and wrote that these \\"One may not expect much from such songs as \\"Zip-A-Dee-Doo- Dah,\\" \\"Whistle While You Work,\\" and \\"The Ballad of Davy Crockett,\\" but Armstrong's joyful vocals and occasional emotional trumpet really uplift the material.

Early life He was born on 28 August 1805 at East Cowes, where his father, John Ward, was collector of customs. His mother Martha was a sister of Thomas Arnold of Rugby. As a young man he associated with Arnold, Richard Whately and other liberals. In 1831 Ward edited with Arnold the short-lived weekly The Englishman's Register, of which Arnold was the proprietor. He gave up the law, for which he had been trained, on his appointment in 1837 to an inspectorship of prisons. The following year, after some months as private secretary to John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham, became through his influence secretary to the New Zealand Colonization Company. Diplomat Early in 1841 Ward was appointed British commissioner for the revision of the State tolls. In 1844 he was sent to Berlin as British commissioner for the settlement, through the arbitration of Frederick William IV of Prussia, of the so-called Portendic claims on France, arising out of a blockade by French ships of part of the African coast. In summer 1845 Lord Aberdeen appointed Ward consul-general at Leipzig, with a commission to visit places in Germany where conferences of the Zollverein would be held. At the end of 1850 Lord Palmerston instructed him to act as secretary of legation at Dresden during the diplomatic conferences held in there, and he saw the results achieved by the policy of Austria, represented by Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg. In 1854 he attended the Munich exhibition of arts and manufactures, and wrote a report on the state of technical instruction in Bavaria. In 1857 he was charged with a political inquiry into Schleswig-Holstein; but his report was left unpublished by Lord Clarendon. In 1860 Ward, after being made a C.B., was nominated charg√© d'affaires and consul-general for the Hanse Towns and the surrounding parts of Germany. Negotiating in 1865, with Lord Napier and Ettrick, a commercial treaty with the Zollverein, he was in 1866 raised to the rank of minister-resident. Later life In 1870, after the abolition of direct diplomatic relations with the Hanse Towns when they joined the North German Confederation, Ward left Hamburg. The rest of his life he spent in retirement, at Dover and in Essex, writing his Reminiscences. Ward died at Dover on 1 September 1890. Works Ward published in 1839 an account of the resources of New Zealand, for New Zealand Colonization Company. He wrote articles on both home and foreign affairs in the Edinburgh Review and British and Foreign Review. Experiences of a Diplomatist (1872) was based on three decades of diaries from his time in Germany. Family Ward married Caroline, daughter of John Bullock, rector of Radwinter, Essex, who survived him until 1905. Their second son was Adolphus William Ward.

Early life Johanna L√∂vinson was born on January 13, 1874 in Berlin, Germany. She was the youngest of the seven children of realtor and businessman Siegfried L√∂vinson and Rosalie Hirschberg. Johanna was 17 when she first attended a teachers' seminary. At the age of 19, she moved to Italy in order to work as a governess. She returned to Berlin and took ‚Äúdramatic lessons‚Äù, learning from actor Max Pohl. Johanna then took ‚Äúvoice and breathing lessons‚Äù, and learned German literature. She taught students in fishing schools proper diction and literature. Frequently, she taught German language to foreign people, directed amateur plays, and organized a book club. The year 1896 was Johanna's first ‚Äúpublic performance, a charity event for needy children‚Äù. This was her first of many performances for charity, as she continued this for more than thirty years. Personal life Johanna married businessman Eugen Meyer (who was 12 years older than her) in 1901. Hildegard (the couple's first child) was born in 1902, but died of influenza shortly after being born. The couple's son, Paul, was born in 1904, and their daughter, Leonore, in 1911. Johanna's children had emigrated to the U.S. and lived in Chicago, Illinois by 1938. Johanna joined her children that year (her children had obtained a visa for her), and lived in an apartment that they had bought for her in Chicago. She had joined Leonore the following year in Reading, Pennsylvania, where Leonore was a kindergarten teacher. Johanna began to study English and took \\"Americanization classes.\\" Johanna and her daughter then moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1943. When World War II ended in 1945, Johanna learned that the majority of her family in Europe had perished in the war. Johanna was hospitalized in 1956, and died on April 29, 1957. Career Shortly after Paul's birth, Eugen's business fell through, and Johanna resumed teaching students in schools. She also gave voice projection lessons; lectured on Jewish subjects; and read children's stories (occasionally in costume and with music) \\"in rented halls\\". This opened the door for Johanna to perform \\"readings of literature for more organizations and events\\". Through these jobs, Johanna became acquainted with famous writers like Ernst Toller, Stefan Zweig, and Georg Hermann. Johanna became \\"a successful and prolific reciting artist\\", and occasionally travelled to perform. Sometimes, she invited the authors of her book club books to join her in her reading circles. In 1923, the first German radio station opened in Berlin, and Johanna joined the station in 1924. She read children's literature, and gave \\"lectures on women's issues\\". Johanna became a famous speaker, \\"and she was often requested at cultural events in various cities\\". When the Nazis took power in 1933, Johanna lost her radio position, yet she resumed performing \\"dramatic readings and lectures for the J√ºdischer Kulturbund\\". In 1946, Johanna started modeling for art students at multiple art schools in Philadelphia. She was required to \\"dress in costume, and to project her personality\\". She also taught German at the Junto school in Chicago, where she continued to teach until 1956. In 1950, Johanna played the role of a patient's mother in a brief educational film about mental health produced by the Pennsylvania Department of Welfare. She worked for German- language radio stations in the United States. In Chicago and Philadelphia, she co-hosted radio programs that had sponsorship from the International Institute, which wanted to help new immigrants familiarize themselves with America and its customs. Johanna co-hosted a radio program, commemorating Goethe's 200th birthday, on the newly created radio station, WFLN, of Philadelphia. By 1956, Johanna resigned from being an art model. And after she was hospitalized in 1956, she stopped teaching.

Later military career After the peace with the Dutch he was for several years employed in the Mediterranean, and more especially against the Algerine pirates. On 8 April 1681, whilst in command of , he engaged one of these corsairs named the Golden Horse, a vessel larger, more heavily armed, and with a more numerous ship's company, The fight was long and bloody; both ships were much shattered, but neither could claim the victory, when a stranger came in sight under Turkish colours. She proved, however, to be the English ship , commanded by Captain Francis Wheler, and to her the Golden Horse at once submitted without further resistance. A somewhat acrimonious dispute afterwards arose between the others and men of the two ships as to their relative share in the capture, which also involved John Benbow, Captain Wheler assuming all the honour to himself, and claiming the whole profit of the prize. The question was referred by Booth to the admiralty, who, without any evidence beyond Booth's partial statement, directed the commander-in-chief to \\"cause the colours of the Golden Horse to be delivered to Captain Booth as a mark of honour which we Judge he hath well deserved\\", and also an appointed share of the value of the prize.British Museum Addl. manuscript 19872, f. 67 In 1683 he commanded ; in September 1688 he was appointed to the 70-gun ; and in the following February, having given in his allegiance to King William, he was knighted and appointed Commissioner of the Navy. It would appear that his profession of allegiance was but a blind to enable him the better to act as agent to the exiled James; for on 16 March he went down the river to the Pendennis, then lying at Sheerness, and endeavoured by his personal influence and promises of money to persuade the lieutenants to agree with him in carrying over the ship to France; the plot also involved carrying over the fireship , commanded by Captain Wilford, who seemed to acquiesce. But Wilford got too drunk to act the part designed for him, and the lieutenants refused to have anything to do with it, or to let the Pendennis go; on which Booth, conceiving that he had gone too far, and that the affair could not be kept secret, fled to France.

Biography Theo Wanne was born in 1967 in California, US. From 1980 to 1986, Wanne was an apprentice of Joel Jensen of Da Da Bicycles in Bellingham, WA. He designed and hand-built custom bicycle frames, developing metal-working skills. In 1987, he attended Macalester College for a year, where he studied music composition. He then travelled to Thailand, staying in a Buddhist monastery, and studied meditation in India. Upon his return to the US, he studied at Western Washington University, followed by California Institute of the Arts where his focus was jazz studies on the saxophone. From 1987 to 1997, Wanne bought and sold vintage musical instruments to finance his schooling. He also studied the history and repair of saxophone mouthpieces with the help of Randy Jones of Tenor Madness in Iowa, and Bob Carpenter from Seattle, WA. In 1997, he graduated from the Naropa Institute, completing a BA in Musical Improvisation. In 1998, Wanne relocated to Philadelphia, PA and repaired musical instruments with master repairman Bret Gustafson of Gustafson Music. At the same time, Wanne bought and sold hundreds of his own custom mouthpieces though his Internet store, Saxophone Mouthpiece Heaven. In 2007, he began manufacturing his own line of mouthpieces alongside his brother, Tom Wanne. They incorporated as Wanne, Inc., doing business as Theo Wanne. Saxophone Mouthpiece Heaven became inactive, its database moved to his current website. In 2009, he released his first fully machined mouthpiece using aerospace CAD CAM technology. He has five patents/patents pending. In 2013, Tom Wanne left Wanne Inc. to pursue other business opportunities. In 2012, Wanne's first tenor saxophone, the MANTRA, was released. In 2013, the MANTRA Soprano saxophone was released. In 2014, Wanne moved his company to new facilities to enable further development and innovation in mouthpiece design. A full re-design of his mouthpiece line came in at the beginning of 2015, with the introduction of the DURGA3, followed by the GAIA2, SHIVA2, AMBIKA2 in 2016.  Saxophone Mouthpiece Heaven  Wanne bought and sold hundreds of his own custom mouthpieces, leading to the inception of his store, Saxophone Mouthpiece Heaven, in 1999. Saxophone Mouthpiece Heaven became the world's most comprehensive resource for information on the design and history of saxophone mouthpieces, and Wanne's mouthpiece work was becoming acclaimed around the globe. Paul Haar, of Jazz Times Magazine said, \\"Wanne's web site was and is a historian's vault filled with information.\\" Wanne worked with many musicians here, such as Joshua Redman, Chris Potter, Eric Alexander, Jan Garbarek, and Tim Price, and quickly became known as the leading expert in his field.

In addition, various artists have made comic book versions of parts of The Book of Mormon. Early woodcuts from the 1840s depicted Mormons negatively in anti-Mormon literature. In the latter half of the 19th century, political cartoons satirized Mormon issues and events like the Mountain Meadows massacre, polygamy, and the death of Brigham Young. In these political cartoons, Mormons were often portrayed as an ethnic minority. Beginning in 1898 when B.H. Roberts was elected to congress and continuing through Reed Smoot's election to Senate, political cartoons focused on these politicians' ties to Mormonism and polygamy. After Smoot's hearing ended in 1904, cartoons about Mormons were less frequent. 20th-century Mormon comics have some references to Mormons, usually in passing as a cultural reference. Contemporary comics like Salt City Strangers and Stripling Warrior focus on the experiences of Mormon characters. Various artists have depicted parts of The Book of Mormon in comic book form. In 1947, John Philip Dalby and Henry Anderson both published comics summarizing Book of Mormon stories. Ric Estrada's \\"Peace with Honor\\" fill-in story of Coriantumr was published in GI Combat #169 and his illustrations appeared in the LDS church's New Testament Stories in 1980. Mike Allred published three volumes of The Golden Plates in 2004 and 2005, which also summarizes events in The Book of Mormon. Other artists have attempted similar projects. Several events from LDS church history are also depicted in comics. Portrayal of the early LDS Church in comic art Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), also referred to as Mormons, have long been a subject of satirical humor. Illustrated anti-Mormon books and newspaper columns were commonplace throughout the United States during the 19th century. =Woodcuts= Some of the earliest forms of illustration used to poke fun at the LDS faith were the woodcuts done by Eber D. Howe. He used these cuts published in 1834 to depict tall tales surrounding the account of Joseph Smith's acquisition of the golden plates. The next major anti-Mormon publication was done in 1842 and was an expos√© turned book called History of the Saints, written by ex-Mormon John C. Bennett with woodcuts by F.E. Worchester and an illustration by Reverend Henry Caswall. In 1842, Sidney Roberts published Great Distress and Loss of American Citizens in which two prints, \\"A Partial View of the Massacre of the Mormons\\" and \\"Mormon's leaving the city of Nauvoo, February 1st, 1846\\", depicted the plight of the Mormons. Soon after, more ex-Mormon publications appeared, such as An Authentic History of Remarkable Persons. As the woodcuts were not used as often, by 1847 caricatures had become more prevalent and were used to portray the Council of the Twelve Apostles in a book written by ex-Mormons Maria and Increase Van Deusen. Their book went through twenty-three editions during an eighteen-year period and focused on aspects of temple worship and ceremonies sacred to the Mormons and included a detailed, fold-out illustration with color.

The Spiritual Wife.jpgPrint from an early anti-Mormon book with the subtitle \\"The Spiritual Wife.\\" Key to the mysteries.pngAnti-Mormon illustration of the inner workings of the early Mormon temple from the Deusens's Spiritual Delusions. =In newspapers 1857‚Äì1898= 1882 illustration by W. Jarman, an ex-Mormon priest, depicting women walking into a skull labeled \\"Utah\\" In 1857, the first Mormon serial cartoons, later known as comics, emerged as part of Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper and bridged the subject of how women in the Mormon militia would affect the outcome of the Utah War. Other comics published that year focused on the Mountain Meadows massacre, depicting Mormons as people who were ignorantly obedient to a cruel prophet. The following year another serial cartoon appeared in Nick Nax and portrayed the family and gender dynamics in the Mormon community. The most prevalent topic for Mormon criticism in the media during this time period surrounded the newly adopted practice of plural marriage. The illustrations entitled \\"Brigham Young the Great American Family\\" in Frank Leslie's Budget and \\"The Family Bedstead\\" in Roughing It, published in the 1870s, both satirised Mormon polygamy. In 1872 a ten-panel serial cartoon in Leslie's Weekley depicted a scene in which many Mormon women sought a Japanese ambassador's hand in marriage, entitled \\"The Adventures of the Japanese Ambassador in Utah\\". Animalistic depictions of polygamy were also common. One example is The Lantern's depiction of a rooster surrounded by many hens with the caption \\"A foul (fowl) piece of Mormonism\\". Young's announcement of the implementation of the United Order in 1874 gave rise to another wave of satirical cartoons. Most of these were related to the illustrated periodical entitled Enoch's Advocate printed by anti-Mormons in Utah. The Beecher-Tilton Scandal Case of 1875 inspired a resurgence of Mormon-related comics. Although this adultery case was not directly related to Mormonism, for a few years following Young's death in 1877, the magazine Puck and other print sources related that Beecher was qualified to be his successor as president of the LDS Church. During the rest of the 1870s and continuing during the 1880s, most of the comics relating to Mormonism had ties to politics. One example depicts the many difficulties that the newly elected President Cleveland would face during his presidency in the comic from Puck entitled \\"Foes in His Path.-The Herculean Task Before Our Next President.\\" These problems were illustrated and the typical personification of Mormonism, which included an old bearded man with the word Mormonism written around his waist and some depiction of his many wives, was shown among them.

Affairs at Salt Lake City.jpg1858 cartoon depicting fictional officers in the Mormon army.

The Adventures of the Japanese Ambassador.jpg1872 cartoon of the Japanese ambassador visiting Utah meeting Young's wives and children. =Mormons and racial minorities= In 1879, The Wasp introduced the comparison of the Mormons with other groups such as Chinese, blacks, Native Americans, and Irish peoples in a cartoon portraying Uncle Sam kicking said groups out of his bed. Many similar cartoons depicting Uncle Sam and his annoyance with the diverse religious and ethnic groups that resided in the United States were created during this period. Another way in which the media portrayed Mormons was by combining aspects of the Mormon and Catholic faiths, such as dressing a Mormon man in the religious clothing of the Catholic faith. Many times blacks were portrayed in Mormon polygamist families. According to historian W. Paul Reeve, by the early 1900s, with the intense media coverage of the Reed Smoot hearings, such images became \\"part of an effort to trap Mormons in a racially suspect past even as Mormon leaders attempted to shape a whiter future.\\" Mormons were keenly aware of the racial slight: Political cartoon from 1896 showing a Utah man with 16 wives to exaggerate the kind of people who supported the Free Silver movement. =In newspapers 1898‚Äì1909= Between 1905 and 1909, The Salt Lake Tribune included over 600 cartoons relating to Mormonism. Related images were beginning to be produced in not only newspapers and magazines, but in pamphlets, periodicals, and more illustrated books. The Mormon leader and politician B. H. Roberts was elected to Congress in 1898, which put the LDS church in the spotlight once again and the fact that Roberts practiced polygamy caused many problems for him, his family, and the other Mormons still engaged in polygamist relationships. The Salt Lake Tribune and many other media outlets had a field day after discovering that one of Roberts' plural wives had just given birth to twins. Reed Smoot is shown fleeing two volumes of the Journal of Discourses in a 1906 comic. Protestants used quotes from the volumes of teachings of the prophets when asking Smoot questions about his religion. A similar reaction occurred in the press when Reed Smoot was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1903. For the next three years, many cartoons and comics were created surrounding Smoot's office. One of the most iconic of these sketches was \\"What They Expected at Washington\\" created by the cartoonist Lovey, which shows a train with one car for husbands, many more cars for wives, and then continuing off into the distance are the train cars full of Mormon children. The anti-Mormon sentiment in The Salt Lake Tribune was fueled by its owner, Republican senator Thomas Kearns. Although Kearns and Smoot were initially friendly, according to Michael Paulos, Smoot's political success came a cost of Kearns's, and Kearns hired ex-Mormon Frank J. Cannon to edit the Tribune. Cannon's extreme anti- Mormonism, as reflected in the Tribune at the time, was noted sarcastically by non-Mormons: \\"How proud we Gentiles are of our self-constituted champions in the fight the Tribune is making on the Mormons!\\" An 1898 anti-Mormon political cartoon by Charles Nelan In 1904, after Smoot was officially seated in the Senate, the national media's intense interest in Mormonism slowly declined and because of new forms of communication and transportation people were able to learn more about the Mormons on a personal level instead of relying on the information provided in the comics of the daily newspaper. Many popular comic depictions included Mormon women who were impoverished, uncultured, hideous, unfaithful, overbearing, and overworked slaves to their husbands. They were also often depicted as being members of a harem and being part of a lustful marital lifestyle. During this time in history most women were portrayed in a negative light in the media, but because of the controversy of polygamy in Mormon culture, the amount of ridicule that Mormon women received was far worse than that received by their non-Mormon counterparts. Mormon characters in comics 1950s‚Äìtoday Comic book adaptations of Sherlock Holmes's A Study in Scarlet were among the first portrayals of Mormons in comics. The first comic book adaptation of A Study in Scarlet was in Classic Comic's 33rd issue, drawn by Louis Zansky. Zanksy's adaptation did not feature Mormons prominently, but the 1953 version of the story by Seymour Moskowitz did. A 1995 adaptation by Ricard Longaron Une etude en rouge and a 2010 adaptation by Ian Edgington and N. J. Culbard also depict Mormons as manipulative. Mormons are also negatively portrayed in Chick Publications's small 1984 comic booklet \\"The Visitors\\" in which two Mormon missionaries fail to convert their investigator when the investigator's niece asks them about more controversial Mormon doctrines. The popular Italian comic book series Tex Willer, set in the American West, mentions Mormons, Danites, and the Mountain Meadows massacre. Other portrayals of Mormons in comics are references to current events or places. Published in the 1970s, issue #23 of Howard the Duck contains a duo who parody Don and Marie Osmond called the Dearth Vapors, who suffocate their opponents with the sweetness that comes out of their mouths. \\"Godzilla, King of Monsters\\" #13 depicted Godzilla and another monster leaving the Salt Lake temple in ruins on the cover. In the actual comic, the temple was not destroyed. In a Captain America comic book published in 1980 in issue #246, Joe Smith seeks revenge on Martin Harris for the death of his son, Joseph Smith Jr. While Joseph Smith Sr. never tried to kill Martin Harris, the names and situation are inspired by Mormon history. Some characters in comic books are Mormon to add interest to their character. A Kickstarter-funded comic, Salt City Strangers, follows five superheroes who explore Mormonism in different ways; none of the creators themselves are Mormon. The series draws on local history and legends, with characters like \\"the gull\\" (a reference to the Miracle of the gulls) and \\"Den Mother\\" (a name for a women who leads cub scouts). Stripling Warrior's superhero is a gay Mormon. Artist James Neish said he wanted \\"to show that a gay character is every bit as worthy in the eyes of God as any heterosexual one.\\" Writer Brian Anderson said that the series was based on his own experiences as a gay Mormon. In the alternate-history Captain Confederacy comic, Dr. Deseret is a Mormon who boldly contradicts polygamous Mormon men and suffers from an addiction to performance-enhancing drugs. A Mormon police detective, Jacob Raven, appears in Spider-man: The Lost Years. Mallory Brook, a Mormon lawyer in the same law firm as She-Hulk, is a prominent character in the series. Comics by Mormon artists =Versions of the Book of Mormon in comics= John Held Sr. (father of John Held Jr.) contributed illustrations to the 1888 The Story of the Book of Mormon. John Philip Dalby published an unfinished comic version of the Book of Mormon published in the Deseret News starting in 1947. Strips filled a full newspaper broadside. Publication was sporadic after 1948, and the last strip was published in 1953. Dalby followed the Book of Mormon chronologically; he started his series in Ether and covered 1 Nephi through 3 Nephi 16. Herald Publishing House, owned by the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, also published a pictorial version of the Book of Mormon in 1947. The book by Henry Anderson was called The First Americans and summarized the Book of Mormon. Ric Estrada wrote a fill-in story for DC's GI Combat in #169 called \\"Peace with Honor,\\" which recounted a Book of Mormon story where Shiz and Coriantumr battle to the death. Mormon missionaries used a page from the story to teach potential converts about the gospel, and in 1980, Estrada illustrated New Testament Stories for the LDS Church. In the 21st century, several artists have tried their hand at adapting Book of Mormon stories to comics. In 2004 and 2005 Mike Allred created and published The Golden Plates, a three-volume, twelve-part comic book series that covers the Book of Mormon events from First Nephi to the Words of Mormon. His wife Laura Allred colored the comics. The series is unfinished and out of print. A unique aspect of these comics is the presence of Mormon women who are portrayed as being hard-working and intelligent. Nephi's wife is shown at his side during most of the text, which gives her a clearer role than that shown in the Book of Mormon itself. In 2009, Micah Acker published a comic book volume Nephite Nation, which contains the story of Ammon. Stephen R. Carter, editor of Sunstone and artist Jett Atwood published two volumes of Book of Mormon comics in 2012 and 2015 respectively, telling stories from the Book of Mosiah. Also in 2012, Michael Mercer published From the Dust, the beginning of what was to be an ambitious retelling of the Book of Mormon, but the project was halted in 2014 due to a lack of marketing funds. =Mormon history in comics= In 1948, Deseret Book Company published Blazing the Pioneer Trail with text by Floyd Larson and illustrations by Forrest Hill. The comic booklet contained a faithful account of the Mormon migration in 1847. Eileen Chabot Wendel also published comic book episodes from the Book of Mormon in her Stories from the Golden Records. Ric Estrada wrote and illustrated Mormon material for DC Comics in his story \\"The Mormon Battalion\\" in No. 135 of Our Fighting Forces. Sal Velluto, an artist who has worked for DC and Marvel, was an art director for The Friend. In his Blammo #7, published in 2011, Noah Van Sciver portrays the First Vision, the Angel Moroni visiting Smith, and the publishing of the Book of Mormon.

He had considerable prestige, claiming royal descent. As he was part of the Lancastrian affinity, the retainers of John of Gaunt, he received considerable royal favour under Henry IV. He represented Shropshire twice in the House of Commons of England. However, he regularly attracted accusations of violence, intimidation and legal chicanery. Towards the end of his life he fell into disfavour and he died while awaiting trial in connection with a murder. Background John Cornwall was the son of Brian de Cornwall (died 1391) of Kinlet, Shropshire, second son of Edmund de Cornwall of Thonock, Lincolnshire,Blakeway, p. 84-5. and Maud Le Strange, daughter of Fulk, 1st Baron Strange of Blackmere.Blakeway, p. 115-6. Edmund de Cornwall, John's grandfather, was the eldest son of Sir Richard of Cornwall, an illegitimate son of Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, a very wealthy brother of Henry III who was also for a time King of the Romans.Marshall, p. 225-6 Hence the entire Cornwall line could justly claim descent from King John.Blakeway, p. 114. Before the Cornwalls, their chief manor of Kinlet had belonged to Brian Brampton,Feudal Aids, volume 4, p. 246. who died late in 1294.Eyton. Antiquities of Shropshire, volume 4, p. 252. His inquisition post mortemInquisitions Post Mortem, volume 3, p. 189-90, nos. 290-1. revealed a considerable portfolio of estates in the counties of Shropshire and Herefordshire in the Welsh Marches. Edmund took custody of the Brampton estates during the minority of Brian de Brampton's daughters and heiresses, Margaret and Elizabeth, under a grant made by Edward I on 2 January 1305, which called him the \\"king's yeoman and kinsman\\".Foljambe and Reade, p. 56. This source gives the year as 1304, presumably adopting Old Style.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1301‚Äì1307, p. 308. However, it seems the grant was only in confirmation, as Cornwall had levied scutage on the Brampton estates in 1300.Eyton. Antiquities of Shropshire, volume 4, p. 254. He acquired Kinlet by marrying Elizabeth, the younger of the two heiresses: she was born on 16 December 1294, probably after her father's death.Eyton. Antiquities of Shropshire, volume 4, p. 244. This Brampton inheritance included other estates, like Ashton in HerefordshireFeudal Aids, volume 2, p. 328. and Idbury in Oxfordshire.Feudal Aids, volume 4, p. 160. and p. 164. Edmund served his cousin the king in the First War of Scottish Independence, perhaps with some distinction and cost to himself, as the fact is mentioned in a royal licence to fell and sell 100 oaks in the Wychwood.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1301‚Äì1307, p. 461. After his death in 1354, his estates passed initially to his eldest son, also called Edmund, said variously to be 30 or 40 or more years of age,Inquisitions Post Mortem, volume 10, p. 138-9, no. 158. whose only son predeceased him sine prole. Brian, as second son, had been recorded as tenant of Idbury, along with Robert Harley, the husband of his aunt Margaret Brampton,Foljambe and Reade, p. 57. as early as 1346.p. 184. He was granted a collection of Shropshire estates by his mother,Foljambe and Reade, p. 65. and ultimately inherited also those in Herefordshire and Oxfordshire, but not Thonock. He had already proved himself in battle, going to France in 1346 in the retinue of John, 2nd Baron Strange of Blackmere, under the overall command of Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel. There he fought in the Battle of Cr√©cy and the Siege of Calais, winning valuable exemptions from tax and future services.Le Strange, p. 314-5. At some point he married John Le Strange's sister, Maud,Foljambe and Reade, p. 66. and John was their eldest surviving son, born around 1366. John had three brothers, Henry, Brian and Thomas, who all died without issue. He also had a sister, Isabel. In 1383 she married John Blount of Sodington,Marshall, p. 229 who twice served as MP for Worcestershire Landowner Brian Cornwall died in 1391. The date is variously given as 5 May, and 18 August:Blakeway, p. 116. the inquisition held at Standlake, Oxfordshire, in early September recorded it as the Friday after the Assumption and stated that John, his heir, was 24 and more years of age ‚Äì the best evidence for his birth date. It noted that his estates in the county included the manor of Asthall-under-Wychwood, which was held in chief: this was a property that went back to Richard of Cornwall himself, who was granted it in 1227 by his brother, Henry III.Rotuli Litterarum Clausarum In Turri Londinensi Asservati, volume 2, p. 198. There was also Idbury, held of the Earl of March.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, volume 16, no. 1102. The inquisition taken at Bridgnorth the following day recorded the manor of Kinlet, also held of the Earl of March, as worth nothing beyond outgoings.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, volume 16, no. 1103. It also listed various pieces of land in the vicinity of Kinlet, including a small estate at Catsley. At Leominster an inquisition recorded Brian's moiety of Ashton as held in joint feoffment with his wife Maud, who had survived him.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, volume 16, no. 1104. The succession posed few legal issues and on 25 September the escheators were ordered to hand over to John Cornwall all his lands held in chief.Calendar of Fine Rolls, 1391‚Äì1399, p. 14. Three years earlier, John had agreed to allow his mother two thirds of Ashton for her lifetime, which was over and above her dower.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1385‚Äì1389, p. 622. Maud had omitted to present her proofs of ownership at Idbury and the inquest had left open the question of the terms on which it was held. In November the king, Richard II, gave her extra time to complete the formalities, promising not to penalise the escheator for the resulting deficient accounts.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1389‚Äì1392, p. 510. As Ashton was not held in chief but of the Earl of March, the king gave orders on 8 February 1392 to have it released to Maud without delay.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1389‚Äì1392, p. 443. The whole question of Maud's dower now appeared settled, with the escheator of Oxfordshire ordered to take her oath and release the property on 30 April, and his counterpart in Shropshire simply to assign the dower.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1389‚Äì1392, p. 460. However, further delays did actually occur, perhaps as a result of the handover to a new escheator in Oxfordshire, who was ordered to meddle no further with the Idbury estate in May 1393.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1392‚Äì1396, p. 60. In addition to the lands revealed by the inquisitions, John Cornwall inherited small estates close to the Welsh border, including a moiety of Worthen, which had been listed among Edmund Cornwall's holdings and took in an area of the Forest of Caus. Richard II. Although he inherited several estates, John Cornwall was not left with great wealth. His mother took the proceeds of well over a third of the estates while she lived. Moreover, Kinlet, the Shropshire seat seems to have been especially unprofitable, producing no surplus. Cornwall did not even acquire the advowson of Kinlet church with the lordship: it was heldEyton. Antiquities of Shropshire, volume 4, p. 255. and exercised by the abbot and convent of Wigmore Abbey.Registrum Roberti Mascall, p. 183. The dire situation here was not unusual, as 14th century had been a time of great suffering in the countryside, with a major agrarian crisis in 1315-22, note anchor 4. and the onset of the Black Death in 1349., note anchor 13. In the worst times, Shropshire inquisitions declared estates worthless or nearly so,Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, Edward III, Volume 11, File 179, no. 537. and landowners sometimes struggle to meet even modest rents,Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, Edward III, Volume 11, File 166, no. 233. mainly because it was hard to find tenants or labour in the depopulated countryside, although this placed the survivors in an advantageous bargaining position. Landlords tended to suffer from the falling value of their estates until at least the 1370s, note anchor 26. but there was then an upturn and the last decades of the century were a time of growing, if modest, prosperity. Cornwall also acquired control of the manor of Eastham, Worcestershire by marriage to Joan Wasteneys or Westneys., note anchor 41. Before Joan's father, Sir William Wasteneys there had been a fairly rapid succession of manorial lords at Eastham, where the advowson belonged to the lord of the manor,, note anchor 131. allowing a succession to be traced through the details of presentations to the rectory in the episcopal registers. In June 1349, just after the onset of the Black Death, it was Thomas de Doverdale who presented to the churchRegistrum Johanis de Trillek, p. 176. but in May 1357 it was Joan de Carru.Registrum Johanis de Trillek, p. 189. In 1361, a peak plague year, John de la More and John Fyman, chaplain, were described as \\"lords of Eastham\\" when presenting William de la More to the church.Registrum Ludowici de Charltone, p. 63. Walter Hewet, grandfather of Cornwall's wife, appears in 1368, alongside the priest William de la More, among a group who obtained a licence to enlarge their park at Eastham by 300 acres.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1364‚Äì1367, p. 295. By 1381 Sir William Wasteneys was in charge, approving an exchange of clergy.Registrum Johannis Gilbert, p. 123. However, another exchange took place on 28 October 1395.Registrum Johannis Trefnant, p. 189. and this time the patron was not Sir William, but his wife Dame Alice.Registrum Johannis Trefnant, p. 180. Not until January 1405 does Sir John Cornwall appear as the patron, jointly with his son-in-law William Lichfield and chaplain John Leye.Registrum Roberti Mascall, p. 170. It seems that he had to wait some time before effective control at Eastham. Moreover, the value of the manor was not high, given as just 20 marks in a Chancery inquisition of 1431 after the death of Roger Corbet, who married Cornwall's granddaughter.E-CIPM 23-489: Roger Corbet, Esquire at Mapping the Medieval Countryside. During Cornwall's time Eastham was held of Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick. Political and military career John of Gaunt. France at the truce of 1389, which prevailed largely until the time of Henry V. Coronation of Henry IV. =Active service and royal favour= Cornwall formally entered the Lancastrian affinity on 12 March 1395 at Saint-Seurin in Bordeaux through an indenture with John of Gaunt.Walker, p. 299. This was at a time of truce in the Hundred Years' War, with Richard II's effective power confined to very small enclaves along the west coast of France. Cornwall was still an esquire and the indenture is unusual in giving him both wages and bouche of court ‚Äì a privilege reserved for knights.Walker, p. 293. He promised to serve Gaunt tant en temps de pees come de guerre al terme de sa vie ‚Äì alike in times of peace and war to the end of his life. He was bound to turn out for war mounted and arrayed in a way suitied to his station in life. In return he was assigned an annuity of 20 marks, drawn from the revenues of the manor of Aldbourne in Wiltshire.Walker, p. 300. The payment would rise to ¬£20 when he was knighted. Simon Walker's study of the Lancastrian affinity lists Cornwall as plain John, beneath Sir John Cornwall, also a long-serving member of Gaunt's retinue who received the ¬£20 appropriate to a knight.Walker, p. 267. Cornwall of Kinlet is recorded as receiving his 20 marks up to 1399. On 9 June 1397 John Cornewale, knight, was listed as one of those granted royal protection for the expedition to Ireland, commanded by Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, the king's Lieutenant.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1396‚Äì1399, p. 146. Mortimer was overlord at Kinlet and Ashton, and medieval records are fairly imprecise about knightly status, which makes it quite probable this Cornwall was the subject of this article. However, there is a strong possibility that it was actually his namesake, who later became Baron Fanhope. As an established part of the Lancastrian affinity, Cornwall benefited from the overthrow of Richard II in 1399 and was in immediately in favour with Henry IV. He was knighted and was made Sheriff of Shropshire on the first day of the new reign. His annuity was also confirmed. However, his good standing with the new r√©gime was soon threatened by allegations of criminality. =Withiford rustling case= Cornwall was accused of cattle rustling at Wytheford (also rendered Withiford) in Shropshire in April 1401.Wrottesley (1894), p. 102. Cornwall claimed, through his attorney, that he had been acting on behalf of John de Knyghteley. In support of this he offered a long and complex supporting narrative, starting with the death of Thomas de Charlton, who had held the estate until 1388, and whose heirs were minors.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1385‚Äì1389, p. 484. The king had sold their marriages and the custody of their estates to speculators, who in turn sold them to Knyghteley. However, the custody had itself now descended to a minor, and Cornwall claimed to be acting in his interests to reclaim arrears. The case affected the king's interests, as the plaintiffs, who were demanding ¬£100, alleged that their cattle had already been taken into the custody of the county escheator when Cornwall removed them.Wrottesley (1894), p. 103. By the time the case came up for trial in 1402, John Darras was Sheriff of Shropshire. Darras could be relied upon to assist Cornwall as he was both a personal friend and had been married to Joan Corbet, his first cousin. In April 1402 he was one of four local gentry who made mainprise (essentially similar to bail) at Westminster for Cornwall that he would keep the peace,Calendar of Close Rolls, 1399‚Äì1402, p. 555. creating a conflict of interest. The case was moved to the Shrewsbury assizes by a writ of nisi prius and there the plaintiffs claimed that Darras had allowed Cornwall to nominate the panel of jurors. Consequently, the jury was dismissed, the case adjourned, and Darras ordered to summon new jurors for the next assizes. Darras was also the returning officer when Cornwall was elected to Parliament. =Member of Parliament, 1402= Manorbier Castle, Pembrokeshire, viewed from the south west. King Henry V. Cornwall was returned as a Member of the House of Commons of England, with Sir Adam de Peshale. During the course of the parliament he accused Maud Copel, also known as Knyton, of being a spy for Owain Glynd≈µr, leader of the Welsh rebellion. Maud was imprisoned on his accusation but doubts seem to have arisen fairly quickly and on 17 October the king ordered her release, on the grounds that there were credible witnesses to the contrary.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1402‚Äì1405, p. 20. =The Welsh rebellion= The Glynd≈µr Rising now loomed large in Cornwall's career. In September 1403 he was ordered by the king to garrison and to hold Manorbier Castle. Presumably he did this efficiently as he was next given a major organisational task. Instructions given to Cornwall, John Burley and Thomas Young, at the Parliament of 1404, which took place in Coventry, but they were embodied in a formal commission on 24 March 1405.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405‚Äì1408, p. 6. They were to supervise the musters of troops in Shropshire and Cheshire and to report back on numbers, as Prince Henry had been appointed the king's lieutenant in North Wales and needed 500 men-at-arms and up to 3000 archers for a punitive expedition. Both of Cornwall's collaborators, Burley and Young were key members of the Arundel affinity. The FitzAlan earls of Arundel were the richest and most important landowners in Shropshire,, note anchor 46. and had long been so. Richard II had executed Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel, one of the Lords Appellant, in 1397. His brother, Archbishop Thomas Arundel, and his dispossessed son, Thomas FitzAlan, 12th Earl of Arundel, were supporters of Henry IV in his bid for power. The restored young earl dominated the politics and parliamentary representation of Shropshire through his extensive network of retainers, which included soldiers, landowners, lawyers and clerics. Cornwall's friend John Darras was a member of the Arundel affinity, valued by the earl and the king for his service in Wales. Arundel himself was closely involved in mobilising and commanding troops for the Welsh campaigns. On 7 October 1405, Cornwall, Burley and Roger Haldenby, a cleric, were commissioned to raise troops for him to garrison castles in North Wales and Shropshire.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405‚Äì1408, p. 147. On the same day Cornwall, Arundel and Burley were issued a commission of oyer and terminer to hunt down people in Shropshire who were secretly supplying the rebels. In January 1406 Prince Henry was commissioned to extend his operations to South Wales, while Cornwall, Burley and Haldenby were commissioned to raise further troops in the Welsh Marches.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405‚Äì1408, p. 156. In June of that year, perhaps in connection with the campaigns and investigations, the king issued a pardon to one of Cornwall's servants from Worcestershire.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405‚Äì1408, p. 183. =Member of Parliament, 1407= Cornwall was knight of the shire for Shropshire again in 1407, returned alongside David Holbache, a man of Welsh origins, a close aide and lawyer to Arundel. =Keeper of Morfe and Shirlett= Cornwall's friend, John Darras hanged himself at his own manor of Neenton in 1408, the first notice of the suicide being a commission from the king, issued on 30 March, to four Shropshire gentry to investigate possible concealment of the deceased's goods.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405‚Äì1408, p. 485. Darras had been keeper of Morfe and Shirlett, areas of Royal forest on either side of the Severn in Shropshire, a post his he held in recognition of his military service in the Welsh campaigns.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405‚Äì1408, p. 296. Soon after his suicide, on 2 April, the king conferred the office on Cornwall, described as a \\"king's knight.\\"Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405‚Äì1408, p. 424. The grant made clear the value of the appointment, \\"with all wages, fees, profits and commodities as John Darras, deceased, had while he lived.\\" This was a rectification of previous confusion, as the keepership seems to have been promised to one Nicholas Gerard. Cornwall seems to have been a trusted man at this point, as on 5 April he and Burley were among those commissioned to investigate a murder in Shropshire.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405‚Äì1408, p. 474. Such judicial tasks continued, with Cornwall delivering writs and making arrests for the king.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1408‚Äì1413, p. 66. However, Cornwall proved himself overbearing and vexatious in office. In March 1410 the king ordered Arundel and his legal team, John Burley, David Holbache and Thomas Young, with the addition of Lord Furnival, one of Arundel's rivals, to investigate breaches of customary manorial and grazing rights at Worfield in Morff Forest,Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1408‚Äì1413, p. 182. made by Arundel's brother-in-law, William de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Bergavenny. Beauchamp's complaint did not cite Cornwall by name but mentioned only \\"certain evildoers.\\" He alleged he had been hindered in his view of frankpledge and in holding his biannual court leet and that both he and his tenants were not able freely to enjoy their customary common pasture, both within and without the royal forest. It was reckless of Cornwall to challenge a man so powerful on his own account and so closely connected to Arundel. However, there had been similar complaints from William Ferrers, 5th Baron Ferrers of Groby. Clearly Cornwall was not deterred by aristocratic and royal concern, as Joan Beauchamp, Arundel's sister made an almost identical complain about Cornwall in late 1411 or early 1412, after she was widowed,Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1408‚Äì1413, p. 377. and the same team was once again commissioned to investigate. The following year the king received a complaint from John Marshall, Dean of his royal free chapel at Bridgnorth, this time naming Cornwall clearly as the culprit.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1408‚Äì1413, p. 477. Marshall alleged that he and the king's tenants at Claverley were being forced to pay an annual fine to access their time-honoured common grazing for sheep, pigs and other animals. Even before sending in Arundel's lawyers to investigate, the king secured Cornwall's resignation and on 13 February 1413 installed Roger Willey, Darras's old business partner, as keeper of Morfe and Shirlett in his place.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1408‚Äì1413, p. 465. =Murder charge and death= In April 1413 a group of Midlands gentry, led by William Lichfield, Cornwall's son-in-law, made mainprise of ¬£100 for him at Westminster and he undertook, under a pain of ¬£500, to do no harm to anyone. This was a prelude to a case tried at Court of King's Bench at Shrewsbury in Trinity term. Henry V was present in person,Fletcher, p. 390. along with William Hankford, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench, in response to complaints about the prevalence of bad governance and murder in Shropshire made at the Fire and Faggot Parliament in Leicester, earlier that year. The business was dominated by the aftermath of large-scale violence between the Arundel affinity and the followers of Lord Furnival in 1413. However, Cornwall was accused of procuring Henry Cornwall of Catsley, possibly his own illegitimate son, to commit a murder and of harbouring him after the event.Fletcher, p. 393. Henry seems to have had a reputation for violence, as he was also accused of a serious assault on a cleric in 1412. The murder had taken place in August 1413 at Sir John Cornwall's own manorial court in Kinlet, emphasising the likelihood of his complicity. Before the case against him could proceed further, Cornwall died on the Thursday after the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, which was 3 July 1414.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, Henry V, volume 20, no. 253: C 138/10, no. 45. Family =Marriages= Sir John Cornwall is known to have married twice By 1390 Cornwall had married Joan Wasteneys, the daughter of :*Sir William Wasteneys of Eastham :*Alice, daughter of Walter Hewet. The marriage seems to have produced two daughters, although only Elizabeth was involved in the succession. Cornwall's first wife seems to have died after a few years and by 1397 he had a second wife called Maud. =Succession= An inquisition at Much Wenlock on 23 September 1414, recording his Shropshire lands as consisting of only an acre at Great Meaton. It is possible he had already settled his estates on his successors, giving the reversion of the Shropshire estates to his sister's family.Blakeway, p. 117. The inquisition also recognised that the heir to Cornwall's estates was his daughter Elizabeth, about 24 years of age at Sir John's death. She had married William Lichfield, who took his name from the cathedral town of Lichfield in Staffordshire and became wealthy through both marriage and inheritance.

The switch is in Sabbath Mode, and may be used, since a green status light is visible. The KosherSwitch ( \\"Kosher Switch\\", \\"Shabbos switch\\", \\"Shabbat switch\\") is a wall switch marketed to the observant Jewish market and institutions servicing this market, as a means of controlling electricity on- demand on Shabbat and Jewish holidays in a manner that is permissible according to some Orthodox authorities, though many reject it. It is manufactured by KosherSwitch Technologies headquartered in New York City and was invented by Andy Menashe Kalati. Halakha of electricity on Shabbat According to Orthodox halakhic authorities, the use of electricity on Shabbat is forbidden in most situations. Work-arounds include devices such as the Shabbos timer (since a person programs the timer before Shabbat, they are not doing a forbidden act on Shabbat), and the Kosher Lamp (where the lamp is constantly lit, but can be covered so no light is visible). The KosherSwitch seeks to improve upon existing innovations by allowing light fixtures to be triggered on or off as needed by a person acting on Shabbat. According to the manufacturer, the switch is based upon \\"un-grama\\" (non grama). The basic idea is that the switch activates only sometimes, and only after a delay, making the action indirect and uncertain. Several Orthodox poskim have ruled as thus makes the device permissible for general consumer use. Others, however, have reached the opposite conclusion. Launch In April 2015, the KosherSwitch group launched an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign seeking to raise US$50,000 in support of their product. The campaign was successfully concluded with $70,715 total funding, and several thousand KosherSwitch units pre-ordered. Their launch video, featuring founder Andy Menashe Kalati, went viral among Jewish viewers and had received over half a million views within the first few days post-launch. In October 2015, the company announced that all pre-orders had been shipped and that sales of the product would shift to retailers and Amazon. Debate and controversy Shortly after the KosherSwitch launch on Indiegogo, fervent halakhic debate ensued. Many rabbis have issued rulings against use of the switch, or have ruled in favor of its use for exigent purposes only, while others continued to back its use for general consumer use. Yet others encouraged a less emotional and more calculated analysis of this invention. The KosherSwitch group also faced allegations of misrepresenting rabbinic positions by doctoring their letters of endorsements and/or their endorsement videos. KosherSwitch group has denied this and stated that they present letters and videos unedited and in their entirety. In response KosherSwitch has accused several rabbis of spreading misinformation and blatant lies. Several rabbis who had initially endorsed or offered their blessings for the product later retracted their original endorsement. Those retractions have also been published by KosherSwitch on their website. Adding to the confusion, in some cases these retractions seem self-contradictory, and such behavior has been decried by impartial bystanders. * R. Rabbi Noach Isaac Oelbaum states in his original unedited video endorsement, ‚ÄúI have seen the KosherSwitch, which is produced by Reb Menashe Kalati, and have read the kuntres [collection of KosherSwitch responsa & endorsements]. And all of the detail which is mentioned in the kuntres, and as far as the switch has been demonstrated, it is clear that it is not a grama [not indirect causation]. Mi‚Äôtzad [with respect to] Hilchos Shabbos, there is no question of any melakha [forbidden act] being done by using that switch. Mi‚Äôtzad sheini [on the other hand] I recommend that anyone asks their own Rav to find out whether it is within the spirit of Shabbos, although there is no real melakha, but ask your own Rav regarding the actual, practical usage.‚Äù However, accusations of misrepresentation and wrong-doing followed: ‚ÄòMrs. Helen Oelbaum, however, said that her husband [R. Oelbaum] never gave his stamp of approval to KosherSwitch. ‚ÄúHe did not endorse it and they misrepresented what he said,‚Äù said Mrs. Oelbaum.‚Äô * R. Chaim Tzvi Shapiro‚Äôs original endorsement responsum concludes, ‚ÄúTherefore, there is absolutely nothing forbidden relating to it, and not even Gram Kibuei [indirectly caused extinguishing], and it is permitted on Shabbos, l‚Äôchatchila [ab initio] according to all Halachic opinions, as was analyzed and clarified above.‚Äù However, his retraction claims that his endorsement was meant for exigent uses only.

They are a popular hiking and climbing area. An educational trail runs through the region which has an area of about 35 hectares.  Location and surrounding area  The M√ºhlsteinbr√ºche are located south of Jonsdorf at a height of 480 to 560 metres. To the southwest they are adjoined by the Jonsdorfer Felsenstadt. About 600 metres to the south is the border with the Czech Republic.  Geology  Drei Tische (\\"Three Tables\\") The sandstone in the M√ºhlsteinbr√ºche region was formed in the geological age of the Middle Turonian and, based on its formation, belongs to the Bohemian Cretaceous Basin. It is characterised by several special features. For example, the sandstone, which was formed by sedimentation, has been breached multiple times by basaltic and phonolitic intrusions as a result of contact with occurrences of Tertiary volcanism in North Bohemia. Often, in these cases, the rock has been exposed to thermal changes (contact with magma and hydrothermal fluids), which has led to vitrification of the rock (a melting of mineral grains at their grain boundaries). The sandstone retains its porosity, is hardened by the strength of its grain structure and thus its abrasion resistance is increased. Schwarzes Loch (\\"Black Hole\\") The area of M√ºhlsteinbr√ºche has as additional geological feature: its pronounced columnar sandstone. Its best known rock formation is the Gro√üe und Kleine Orgel (\\"Great and Little Organ\\"), whose appearance is easily confused with that of columnar basalt. The columns, which are completely atypical for sandstone, have a diameter of up to 15 centimetres and are bundled vertically on a solid, non- columnar sandstone block. They have been formed by thermal processes as a result of contact with magma. In 1852 Alexander von Humboldt sent an artist and two geologists here to study this phenomenon.  History  The use of sandstone in the Zittau Mountains for the production of millstones was already under way from the 16th century. The Jonsdorf M√ºhlsteinbr√ºche were one of more than 40 quarrying sites in the surrounding region. In 1560, quarrying began in Jonsdorf itself. Over 350 years, sandstone was quarried here and made into millstones with a diameter of up to 2.70 metres. To do this, the millstones were initially hewn out of one piece of rock. From about 1850, millstones were assembled from several pieces as there were no longer any sufficiently large and homogeneous sandstone blocks being quarried. Production was maintained until 1918. The main markets were in Russia and England. Moscow and Saint Petersburg had their own offices for the millstone trade. In the 1950s, a nature trail was laid out by friends of nature and local history. From 1990, a restoration of the quarries was begun in order to make them accessible. In 2002, a demonstration workshop was built in the Schwarzer Loch (\\"Black Hole\\"). Today the M√ºhlsteinbr√ºche are a major attraction in the Zittau Mountains.

The game is a variant on the Fox and Geese theme, and is commonly played in Germany, France, and England. Rules Asalto is an asymmetric game in which the players take on two very different roles: the rebels and the officers. The rebels' objective is to capture the two officers, surround them so that they cannot move, or occupy all of the points within the \\"fortress\\". The officers' objective is to capture enough rebels that these tasks become impossible. =Setup= Asalto board diagram including fortress (blue) with rebel pieces (green) and officers (red) in their starting positions Asalto is played on a grid of 33 intersection points in the shape of a cross, with a specially denoted arm known as the fortress at the top of the board. The total number of pieces in an Asalto game is 26, composed of 24 rebels and two officers. Before play begins, the rebels are arranged so that they sit on the 24 intersection points outside the fortress, while the officers may be arranged at the player's discretion inside the fortress. The game begins once the rebel player takes the first turn. = Movement and capturing = On their turn, a player may only move one piece, although the rules governing movement are different for each player. Rebel pieces may move one space along any line on the board, but only in the direction of the fortress. Rebel pieces cannot capture directly, but may do so through huffing. Officers may move one space along any line on the board in any direction. To capture a rebel piece, an officer may jump over it into an empty space beyond. This action can only occur along a straight, marked line. The officer may jump multiple times in one turn, but may not jump the same piece twice. Officers may not change direction in midair, but may change direction in between jumps. Officers may not jump over each other. =Variations= When playing German Tactics, the rebel pieces may not move along any horizontal lines except those at the top of the arms of the cross.

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is the basis for the design of the YouTube copyright strike system. For YouTube to retain DMCA safe harbor protection, it must respond to copyright infringement claims with a notice and take down process. YouTube's own practice is to issue a \\"YouTube copyright strike\\" on the user accused of copyright infringement. When a YouTube user gets hit with a copyright strike, they will be required to watch a warning video about the rules of copyright and take trivia questions about the danger of copyright. When a YouTube user has three copyright strikes, YouTube terminates that user's YouTube channel, removes all of their videos from that user's YouTube channel, and prohibits that user from creating another YouTube channel. YouTube assigns strikes based on reports of copyright violations from bots. Some users have expressed concern that the strike process is unfair to users. The complaint is that the system assumes guilt of YouTube users and takes the side of copyright holders even when no infringement has occurred. YouTube and Nintendo were criticised by Cory Doctorow, a writer for the blog Boing Boing, due to them reportedly treating video game reviewers unfairly by threatening them with strikes. Reasons for strikes = Disagreements about what constitutes fair use= Fair use is a legal rationale for reusing copyrighted content in a limited way, such as to discuss or criticize other media. Various YouTube creators have reported receiving copyright strikes for using media in the context of fair use. =Suppression of criticism= YouTube creators have reported receiving copyright strikes on videos which are critical of corporate products. They assert that copyright violation, in this context, has been used as a strategy to suppress criticism. =Strikes for posting own work= Copyright strikes have also been issued against creators themselves. Miracle of Sound's channel was hit with multiple copyright strikes as a result of automated strikes by the distributor of their own music. =Strikes for works in the public domain= In a similar incident to such strikes, though in another forum, Sony issued an automated copyright strike against James Rhodes for a video on Facebook of him playing part of a piece by Bach, on the grounds that they owned the copyright on a similar recording, and when the strike was challenged, asserted that they owned the rights to the work, before finally admitting that Bach's compositions are in the public domain. =Strikes for unknown reasons= Some publishers on YouTube report not understanding why they have received strikes. This may relate to the fact 99.95 percent of DMCA takedown notices are actually sent at random URLs that could have existed (valid format) but is not actually used at all at the point in time the takedown notice is sent. This is the work of bots having no valid claims to any copyright, trying to carpet bomb DMCA notices for various illegal reasons such as trying to ruin a competitor.

Its mission is to expedite solutions that transform energy by advancing renewable energy science, engineering, and analysis through research, education, and industry partnerships. RASEI benefits from the strengths of its partner institutions. CU-Boulder is a premier institution for research and education, and its broad spectrum of capabilities and disciplines contributed to its placement of eight in research citation output among U.S. institutions of higher learning (Science, Nov. 2010). NREL is the only national laboratory solely dedicated to advancing renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies from concept to commercial application. RASEI's Four Goals Create Integrated Energy Campus: Create a world-leading venue for energy research and education that benefits from the concentration of academic institutions, federal research laboratories, and businesses involved in the green economy along Colorado‚Äôs Front Range. Perform Innovative Research: Develop a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to research that meets the scientific and institutional energy challenges of the 21st century. Educate Energy Leaders and Workforce: Provide programs, lectures, and opportunities that prepare students to become the energy leaders of the future. Develop Industry Partnerships: Engage industry partners in comprehensive programs involving energy research, education, policy, and technology development. Understanding the Scale and Complexity of the Energy Challenge We face an unprecedented global energy challenge. Demand for energy is projected to double within the next few decades and continue to grow through the end of the century. To meet this ever-growing demand, energy industries of the 21st century need an entirely new infrastructure that produces more energy at a lower cost, uses energy far more efficiently, improves the security of supply by relying more on domestic and stable sources, and produces far fewer greenhouse gas emissions. The scale and complexity of the energy challenge and the intense competition in the energy marketplace necessitate a comprehensive approach for developing new energy industries. A measured investment from the public and private sectors and new models for public-private partnerships are required. Understanding the dynamics of this new marketplace and the factors governing a sustainable energy system are crucial for emerging energy industries to succeed. These systems must meet multiple requirements such as scaling to a terawatt, using readily available resources for manufacturing, and having a sustainable lifecycle. http://www.colorado.edu/rasei/about-us Notable people Arthur Nozik  Related News  The Renewable and Sustainable Energy Institute today announced its inaugural group of RASEI Fellow appointments and plans for future faculty hires to form one of the world's leading university and federal laboratory partnerships in the development and commercialization of renewable energy technologies. RASEI, a new joint institute between the University of Colorado at Boulder and the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, made the announcement at CU-Boulder's Annual Energy Research Symposium taking place today in Boulder. \\"NREL and CU-Boulder, along with research colleagues from Colorado State University and the Colorado School of Mines, are already working together on a variety of critical energy technologies that will help to ensure a clean and sustainable energy supply for our nation's future,\\" said Robert McGrath, NREL deputy laboratory director for science and technology, and one of RASEI's chief architects. \\"The newly established RASEI significantly strengthens the structural platform enabling CU-Boulder and NREL researchers to take full advantage of the complementary strengths resident within each institution.\\" A national search will be conducted for RASEI's director. In addition to creating the resources to attract a top candidate to lead the new institute, CU-Boulder plans to designate as many as 10 new faculty hires to RASEI over the next several years, with exact levels of support contingent upon the Colorado economy and the university's budget. Institute management and decision-making will be coordinated by the new director, a private-sector Leadership Board and a set of prominent research fellows appointed from NREL and CU-Boulder. The initial 34 RASEI fellows named today include 18 from CU-Boulder and 16 from NREL. \\"CU has a long history of joint institutes with national laboratories that attract the highest caliber leadership and scientific talent,\\" said CU-Boulder Chancellor Philip P. DiStefano. \\"With this initiative, CU is fostering an invaluable working relationship with an important partner, and opening up new opportunities for CU researchers to collaborate with Stanford, MIT and other major American Association of Universities research institutions focusing on the development of new energy solutions.\\" RASEI will operate much like CU-Boulder's other independent research institutes, including JILA, which collaborates with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, which collaborates with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. According to McGrath, \\"RASEI will expand and build upon the work already initiated under the Center for Revolutionary Solar Photoconversion, the Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels, the Center for Research and Education in Wind and other research centers affiliated with the Colorado Renewable Energy Collaboratory.\\" The Collaboratory's partners include CU-Boulder, CSU, the Colorado School of Mines and NREL. \\"Colorado's new energy economy is leading America toward a new energy future, and collaborations between our universities and national laboratories such as RASEI are leading the way,\\" said Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter. \\"RASEI is poised to attract the best and brightest new research talent to the state of Colorado, which will also bring good jobs and advance clean energy technologies.\\" And with ConocoPhillips, a member of RASEI's industry- driven Leadership Board, building a new global technology center and corporate learning center at the Sun Microsystems/StorageTek site in Louisville, the new institute will spur greater overall investment in new energy development in Colorado, now seen as a national hub for clean energy technology creation. The new ConocoPhillips center will handle research and development of renewable energy and high-tech carbon fuels recovery. \\"One of the key reasons ConocoPhillips plans to locate its new global technology center and corporate learning center in Colorado is the exceptional research talent pool in close proximity to our proposed campus,\\" said Stephen Brand, ConocoPhillips' senior vice president for technology. \\"As a long-time collaborator with CU-Boulder, and member of the RASEI Leadership Council, ConocoPhillips is committed to making this new institute a world-class success.\\" References University of Colorado Boulder Renewable energy in the United States ","title":"Renewable and Sustainable Energy Institute"},{"id":"51067370","text":"The 2000‚Äì01 League of Ireland First Division season was the 16th season of the League of Ireland First Division.

The marque was created from the merged ranges of Alldays & Onions and Enfield and the Enfield Autocar Co Ltd. History Prior to World War I Alldays & Onions had produced a range of cars and in 1908 took over the short lived Enfield Autocar Company based in Redditch which had been formed to take over the car making interests of the Enfield Cycle Company. The Enfield designed cars were phased out before World War I leaving them as badge engineered Alldays. Following the armistice in 1918 the companies were rationalised and in 1919 became Enfield-Allday Motors Ltd based in Sparkbrook. All the old designs were dropped and a new 10 hp car called the Bullet was designed by A,W. Reeves who had been at Crossley Motors. This radical design had an air cooled, five cylinder, sleeve valve, radial engine of 1247 cc mounted at the front of a tubular steel lattice frame. The drive to the rear wheels was via an inclined shaft to a central 3 speed gearbox and then another shaft to the rear axle. Suspension was by transverse cantilever springs. A three-seat body was fitted. When announced a price of ¬£295 was advertised but by the time the car was exhibited later in the year at the London Motor Show this had risen to ¬£350. A. C. \\"Gus\\" Bertelli of the Grahame-White Aviation company was called in to give an opinion on the car and reported that a lot of development was required and the price was uneconomic and should be raised to ¬£550. This was too much for the market and probably only 5 reached customers. A 15 hp sleeve valve car with a six cylinder in-line engine had also been announced but it seems never to have reached production. Enfield-Allday 10/20 based racing car With a great deal of money spent on development and no sales to show for it something had to be done quickly and Bertelli was appointed Works Manager. He designed a conventional car with an in-line four cylinder 1488 cc engine with three speed transmission which was launched as the 10/20 hp. The coachwork was built by Gus's brother Enrico \\"Harry\\" Bertelli who would later built bodies for Aston Martin. An entry was made in the 1924 Tourist trophy race without success. The car was however too expensive with a chassis- only price of ¬£500 and complete cars from ¬£575. In 1923 the engine was enlarged to 1750 cc and a four speed gearbox fitted and the name changed to the 12/30 at a lower price of ¬£450. Only about 100 cars were made before the company went into liquidation in January 1923.Enfield Autocar Company Limited. The Manchester Guardian 18 Jan 1908: 11The liquidator offered the goodwill, tools and finished and unfinished parts for the following motor vehicles: ; _Enfield Allday_ :10/20 touring car :12/30 touring car (new Model) :10/30 sports model car :25/30 2=ton lorry ;Chassis only: : _Allday_ :8/10 :12/14 :16/20 :25/30 :2-ton lorry and tractor :3-ton lorry and charabanc :5-ton lorry source=The Manchester Guardian 07 July 1923: 4. ;Chassis only: : _Enfield_ :8/10 :14.3 :18.3 :24.8 This was not the end as the company was re-organised and moved to smaller premises in Small Heath, Birmingham from where the 12/30 was offered with a very wide range of coachwork from the Warwick 2-seater at ¬£575 up to the Hereford limousine at ¬£720 and Stratford saloon at ¬£795. Before the new range could get established, even if they could be sold at the very high prices, parent company Alldays & Onions collapsed in 1924.

History =Early history (19572000)= The Aztec Inn's various apartment buildings were constructed on the property in 1953, 1954, and 1956. The motel structure was constructed in 1957, and operated as the Sun N Shine Motel. Additional rooms were added in 1958 and 1960. The motel became the Sunshine Motel during the 1980s, and was later renamed as the Mojave Meadow Motel. In 1991, a casino was built and opened as the Aztec Inn. The motel's office was demolished to make room for the casino. During the 1990s, the property was owned by Gerald D. Brinkman, Gary Vause, Donald Dombrowski, and Paul Kellogg III. In 1994, officials from the Stratosphere project under construction north of the Aztec Inn entered an agreement with the city's Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency to have the Aztec Inn's parking lot condemned through eminent domain and turned over to the Stratosphere. The Aztec Inn's owners had spent $700,000 on renovations and feared that the loss of their parking lot would end the business. In June 1995, a judge ruled that the agreement was unconstitutional. The city chose not to appeal the decision. By April 1996, the Aztec Inn settled with the Stratosphere and agreed to sell its parking lot for an undisclosed amount. Darrin Race, an Elvis Presley impersonator, regularly performed in front of the Aztec Inn during the 1990s. In December 1998, Brinkman, who owned a 25-percent interest in the Aztec Inn, sued Kellogg and Vause, accusing them and Dombrowski of making numerous high-interest loans to the Aztec Inn and later having the casino repay the loans against Brinkman's objections. Brinkman alleged that the loans violated the Aztec Inn's limited partnership agreement, which required unanimous consent of all loan transactions. Brinkman alleged that the Aztec Inn had lost $1.7 million since its opening in 1991, as a result of the loans. The lawsuit claimed that the casino had lost $217,000 in 1996, $418,000 in 1997 and $474,000 through the first ten months of 1998. Michael Mushkin, an attorney defending the Aztec Inn's owners, claimed, \\"Mr. Brinkman has also made loans and received the same rate of interest on loans as these partners have.\\" Brinkman requested a judge to place the Aztec Inn into receivership to recoup his investment money. Mushkin doubted that the casino would be forced into receivership. Aztec Inn's general manager, Bill Maxwell, criticized Brinkman, saying, \\"The three partners are supporting the company. The fourth partner is not.\\" In March 1999, Maxwell was approved for a four-percent interest in the Aztec Inn. That month, Brinkman was in negotiations with the other co-owners to settle the lawsuit. =Recent history (2000present)= At approximately 3:50 a.m. on May 10, 2000, a 33-year-old woman was driving south on South Las Vegas Boulevard when another driver cut her off. The woman swerved, lost control of her Mercedes-Benz, smashed through the Aztec Inn's glass doors, and crashed into the casino and bar area. Five people were injured. At least 15 slot machines each one costing approximately $8,000 were damaged. Four touchscreen slot machines each one costing approximately $12,000 were also damaged. One slot machine was hit hard enough by the woman's vehicle to be thrown across the casino, smashing into a wall. The casino's floor was covered in coins and glass shards. Paul Lybarger, the shift manager at the time, said, \\"I'm still surprised that no one was killed.\\" The motel remained open, while the bar and slot machine area were expected to be reopened by early June 2000. In January 2001, a flash fire occurred in one of the motel rooms and injured two people. In June 2004, Maxwell was approved to sell his four-percent stake to Dombrowski and Vause for $100,000. In January 2005, the casino agreed to correct discrepancies after being warned of violations in its internal control accounting procedures. In June 2005, state agents found repeated violations, which included underreporting slot machine winnings by $38,218. Other violations included improper recording of supply purchases, an improperly tested coin counter, and the allowance of a bartender to have a $2,000 bankroll to make gaming payouts that were not recorded in the casino's accounting system. A fire forced the evacuation of the motel on June 22, 2005, at approximately 11:45 p.m. The fire was confined to a closet in a motel room, and was extinguished with no injuries. Another motel fire, involving a flaming mattress, occurred in July 2005. On the night of August 3, 2005, a three-alarm fire broke out on the western portion of the Aztec Inn, on the second floor of the two-story wood-frame motel, located on Baltimore Avenue. The casino was evacuated. Firefighters arrived at approximately 11:38 p.m. More than 100 firefighters spent 45 minutes to get the fire under control. Traffic on South Las Vegas Boulevard, between Sahara Avenue and St. Louis Avenue, was diverted to make way for firefighters. The fire was mostly located inside the motel's attic. Aside from the attic, two motel rooms and a stairwell were also damaged by the fire, which caused an estimated $200,000 in damages. The motel was vacant prior to the fire, as it was undergoing renovations. It was the worst of the three fires that the Aztec Inn suffered that year, although officials determined that they were unrelated to each other. Fire investigators wanted to determine if renovations on the building were related to the fire. Smoke clouds drifted south along the Las Vegas Strip into the early morning hours. In May 2006, the Aztec Inn was fined $5,000 after Dombrowski admitted to the accounting violations from the previous year.

Synopsis Sex counselor Mok Tai-hung (Eddie Cheung) and sex therapist Lam Ching-yee (Sharon Chan) have been dating for five years. The two love each other very much and want to take their relationship to the next step by getting married. But Ching-yee's strict and conservative mother Liu Doi-lam, is highly against them being together due to Tai-hung's financial status, him being a bit older than her daughter and also him having a son from a previous relationship. Tai-hung puts up with Ching-yee's mother bias of him and hopes she will come around one day. After the two are married they still find roadblocks in their relationship as Tai-hung constantly has to put up with his new mother in-law to show he is the perfect son in-law. While Ching-yee has to adjust to life at Tai-hung's family home and tries not to offend her mother in-law who overly tries to be helpful but only makes matters worst. Tai-hung's immature friend Kam Cheung (Louis Yuen) once lived an affluent life, until he was swindled out of his inheritance. Now he lives a desolated life in a small rundown apartment where he can't even afford to pay his electric bill. When he cons Tai-hung's equally immature younger sister Mok Siu-tou (Elena Kong) into lending him money to start his underwear business, he didn't expect her to cling onto him until he repays her. Tai-hung helps Cheung repay his debt to Siu-tou, Cheung does not learn his lesson and uses Siu-tou's identity as a co- signer when he takes out a loan from loan sharks. Meanwhile, Ching-yee's uncle Liu Chun-cheung (Benz Hui), who is in his late middle age is getting married for the first time. His much younger newly wed wife Tong Tim-tim (May Chan) just immigrated to Hong Kong from mainland China, not long after marrying Chun-cheung. Ching-yee's mother Liu Doi-lam, who has taken care of her dependent older brother all her life does not trust Tim-tim and is afraid that Tim-tim will con her brother, even when the entire family tells her, Chun- cheung doesn't have anything worth conning. The problem with Chun-cheung and Tim-tim's marriage is, he finds himself unable to keep up with his wife's sex drive as she wants to have intimacy every night. Even with the help of his friends in helping him avoid having sex with his wife each night, Chun-cheung finds himself unable to resist Tim-tim when she is in costume for foreplay. At Ching-yee's younger sister's high school, extreme conservative literature teacher To Tak-kee (Sammy Sum), feels that all the students should be like him, remain a virgin until marriage. When he sees students from his ultra conservative all girls school mingle with the opposite sex from another school he goes as far as to stalk them after school and then telling them to stop seeing the male students from the other school or else he will tell their parents. When Tak-kee finds out that fellow teacher Emma Chung (Grace Wong) lives a promiscuous life outside of work he threatens to tell the school principal. Emma won't allow him the chance to tell the principle about her secret lifestyle, when she tries to seduce him and then uses that against him.

The fifth named storm of the busy 2016 Pacific hurricane season, Darby originated from a low pressure area that developed in the Eastern Pacific well southwest of Mexico during July 2016. It gained sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression on July 11, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Darby the next day. Further intensification ensued, and Darby became a hurricane on July 13. Over the next three days, Darby slowly strengthened to Category 3 status on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale, becoming a major hurricane. Cool waters and dry air caused Darby to weaken over the next three days, although Darby managed to restrengthen slightly on July 21 before weakening once again as the storm neared Hawaii. Just after midnight on July 24 (UTC; 2:00 p.m. on July 23 HST), Darby made landfall on the Big Island, and weakened into a remnant low two days later. Darby was the second tropical storm to make landfall in Hawaii in two years. Before landfall, tropical storm watches and warnings were issued for all of Hawaii, and were only discontinued after Darby weakened to a tropical depression on July 25. Over the period of July 23 to July 25, Darby brought heavy rain and widespread flash floods to the windward sides of the Hawaiian Islands, with storm rainfall totals exceeding on the Big Island and in Oahu. This resulted in some road closures, sewage spills, numerous flight cancellations, and minor property damage. Overall, no fatalities occurred during the passage of Darby. Meteorological history In the first two weeks of July, a series of low pressure areas formed off the coast of Mexico. The fourth of these was spawned by a tropical wave several hundred miles south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico, first noted by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) on July 9. Amid favorable conditions, convection associated with the low developed and increased in organization, and a tropical depression formed on the afternoon of July 11 centered 290 mi (465 km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. Despite moving over sea surface temperatures of at least 82¬∞F (28¬∞C), moderate northeasterly wind shear hindered development; however, the depression soon obtained sufficient organization to be upgraded to a tropical storm and given the name Darby. On July 13, the shear decreased, and as a result Darby began to intensify quickly, strengthening into a hurricane 30 hours after becoming a tropical storm. At that time, Darby was located about 570 miles (920 km) south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. Tracking steadily west-northwestward along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge, Darby continued to intensify albeit at a slower rate due to its proximity to dry air. On July 15, Darby became a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Despite decreasing ocean temperatures, Darby intensified further to attain winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). Strengthening was no longer expected as Darby moved over sea temperatures of less than 79¬∞F (26¬∞C), but on July 16, Darby managed to develop an annular structure. Convection became more symmetric, outer rainbands dissipated, and the 25 mile- wide (35 km) eye became increasingly well defined. Darby reached its peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 958 mbar (hPa; 28.29 inHg). However, twelve hours later, Darby weakened back to a Category 2 hurricane as convection deteriorated. Embedded in cool sinking air and moving over decreasing sea surface temperatures, Darby began a gradual weakening trend, degrading to a Category 1 hurricane by July 18. Despite warming cloud tops, Darby exhibited a well- defined circulation and a ragged eye feature, remaining a minimal hurricane through the rest of the day. However, Darby finally weakened to a tropical storm on July 19. Darby continued to degrade as it crossed 140¬∞W into the Central Pacific, and entered the jurisdiction of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) on July 20 with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Soon after, Darby turned west-southwestwards as it continued to weaken, but the shear diminished slightly on July 21, allowing Darby to restrengthen to winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). The reprieve was short-lived, however, as an approaching upper-level low once again increased shear over the system the next day. Darby began to curve back to the west on July 23 as it approached a weakness in the aforementioned subtropical ridge, all the while weakening slowly. Just after 00:00 UTC on July 24 (2:00 p.m. HST on July 23), Darby made landfall on the Big Island near the village of Pahala in the Ka ª≈´ District, with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). This marked one of only six occurrences of a tropical cyclone of tropical storm intensity or higher making landfall on one of the major islands in the state of Hawaii since record keeping began in 1949. The others were an unnamed tropical storm in 1958, Hurricane Dot in 1959, Hurricane Iniki in 1992, Tropical Storm Iselle in 2014, and Tropical Storm Olivia in 2018. After crossing the Big Island, Darby began to accelerate northwestwards in earnest while maintaining as a minimal tropical storm. On July 25, Darby weakened into a depression, and degenerated into a remnant low on the next day 265 mi (425 km) west-northwest of Honolulu. Preparations and impact Infrared satellite loop of Darby making landfall in the Big Island on July 23 As Darby approached Hawaii on July 21, a tropical storm watch was issued for Hawaii County and Maui County. These were modified to tropical storm warnings by noon the next day. A tropical storm watch was issued for Oahu late on July 22 as Darby continued to move closer to Hawaii, and was modified to a tropical storm warning the next morning. Eventually, after Darby made landfall in Ka ª≈´ District in the afternoon of July 23, the tropical storm warning was extended to all islands in the state of Hawaii. The watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Darby weakened and moved away from the islands, with none remaining by July 25. In advance of the storm, Governor of Hawaii David Ige declared a state of emergency, calling for people to \\"follow emergency instructions, prepare for the storm and take steps to protect your families, employees and property\\". Flights to and from the region were delayed or cancelled; Island Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Hawaiian Airlines, and United Airlines waived change fees for affected customers. The Oahu Hawaiian Canoe Racing Association cancelled its championship due to be held on July 24. Both the Hawaii and Maui campuses of the Kamehameha Schools were closed over the weekend, and athletic events due to be held there were cancelled or postponed. In Hawaii County and Oahu, all state parks and campgrounds were closed until July 25; Maui and Kauai counties suffered partial closures instead. Radar image of Darby a few hours after landfall on July 24 Despite not being hit by a named storm in decades, the Big Island was directly hit twice in a three-year period with Tropical Storm Iselle making landfall 23 months prior to Darby, doing so in almost the exact location. Heavy rainfall occurred along the windward slopes within the range of , peaking at near the Kawai Nui Marsh. Flash flooding occurred in the South Kohala, Kau, and Hamakua districts which forced the closure of numerous roads. However, Hilo, located between these heavily impacted districts, recorded a relatively modest 1.77 inches of rain on July 23 and 24. After passing over the Big Island, Darby proceeded northwestward via the Kauai Channel, while resulting in heavy rains over southern slope of Haleakala on Maui. These rains forced the closure of Highway 11, as well as parts of Interstate H-1 and the Kamehameha Highway. Island-wide, a peak 24-hour rainfall total, , was measured in Wailuaiki. In Oahu, rainfall, sometimes at rates of per hour, caused flash flooding in several areas within the urban core of Honolulu and along windward slopes. A stream in Kalihi inundated several properties and spilled over a bridge located further downstream. Several sewage spills occurred on Oahu due to the heavy rain, including 42,000 gallons (160,000 litres) at the Kailua Wastewater Treatment Plant and 4,100 gallons (15,500 litres) from a private residence on Liliha Street. This resulted in the issuance of a brown water advisory. In all, peak storm totals on Oahu during the night of July 24 exceeded , including in Kaneohe. Across the entire state of Hawaii, there was no loss of life during the passage of Tropical Storm Darby, and overall the islands experienced only minimal impacts from the storm.

Life and work Shelest was born in Smolensk, Russia and accepted to the Leningrad Choreographic Institute (now known as the Vaganova Academy). Her early training was by Yelisaveta Gerdt but when she was older, she studied with Agrippina Vaganova. After her graduation in 1937 (where she made a huge impact dancing in the ballet Katerina by Leonid Lavrovsky), she was accepted into the Kirov Ballet and started dancing lead soloist roles almost immediately. She became known as a consummate dramatic ballerina. During World War II, to escape the Nazi siege of Leningrad, much of the Kirov Ballet, including Shelest, left for Perm in 1942. It's there where she was to dance many of her leading roles for the first time, including her first Aurora in The Sleeping Beauty, Street Dancer in Don Quixote, and one of her greatest roles, the fiery Zarema in The Fountain of Bakhchisarai. In all these roles, she was greatly influenced by the dramatic theories of Stanislasky and acclaimed for introducing a form of realistic acting to the ballet stage. After the war, Shelest was also at the forefront of the developments in Russian dance. She performed in the new works by Zakharov, Bourmeister, Sergeyev, and Yakobson, having an incredible success in 1956 as Aegina in Yakobson's Spartacus due her innate sense of drama and character development. Her first Giselle in the same year broke new ground in offering a more realistic approach to the drama and was considered a revelation at the time. Tombstone in St. Petersburg In the 1950s, she married choreographer Yuri Grigorovich and danced in many of his creations, both Katerina and Mistress of the Copper Mountain in The Stone Flower, and also Mekhmene Banu in The Legend of Love, which was later to be her farewell performance, 26 years to the day after her graduation. They later divorced and Grigorovich went on to marry Bolshoi ballerina Natalia Bessmertnova. Shelest made relatively few foreign tours but, in 1953, she was allowed to perform in England with a small troupe of dancers. She created a sensation during her five-week stay, but didn't leave the Iron Curtain countries for the rest of her career. Shelest was often described as having a \\"stage feud\\" with Kirov star ballerina, Natalia Dudinskaya which often impacted her standing in the company especially when Dudinskaya's husband, Konstantin Sergeyev, was the Artistic Director. Shelest had a profound impact on many Soviet ballerinas of the 1950s-70s including Maya Plisetskaya, who considered her the greatest dancer she had ever seen. In 1953 she became an Honored Artist of the USSR and, in 1957, a Peoples' Artist. After a retirement and a post-dancing career as a choreographer, regional company director and instructor at the Vaganova Academy, Shelest died in St. Petersburg on December 7, 1998.

The type species is Gualicho shinyae. Gualicho lived in what is now northern Patagonia, on what was then a South American island continent split off from the supercontinent Gondwana. The fossils were found in the Huincul Formation, dating to the late Cenomanian-early Turonian age of the upper Cretaceous Period, around 93 million years ago. Discovery Digits of the left hand On 13 February 2007, Akiko Shinya, preparator of the Field Museum of Natural History, east of the Ezequiel Ramos Mex√≠a Reservoir at the Rancho Violante, discovered the skeleton of a theropod new to science. In 2016, the specimen was named and described by Sebasti√°n Apestegu√≠a, Nathan D. Smith, Rub√©n Ju√°rez Valieri and Peter J. Makovicky. The generic name is derived from the gualichu, a demon of local folklore. The specific name honours Shinya as the animal's discoverer. The holotype, MPCN PV 0001, consists of a partial skeleton lacking the skull. It contains four vertebrae of the back, three vertebrae of the middle tail, ribs, a basket of belly-ribs, the left shoulder girdle, the left forelimb, the right lower arm, the lower ends of both pubic bones, the right thighbone, the lower end of the left thighbone, the upper ends of the right shinbone and calf bone, elements of both metatarsi and three toes of the right foot. Most bones were uncovered in their original anatomical position but much of the skeleton had been destroyed by erosion. Gualicho has been suggested to be synonymous with the megaraptoran Aoniraptor, also known from Huincul Formation and uncovered at the Violante site in view of similarities in their caudal vertebrae. Description Restoration Estimated size compared to a human Like the well-known Tyrannosaurus, to which it has been compared, the Gualicho possesses reduced arms and possibly two fingered hands, although a 2020 study suggests enough of the third metacarpal is present for a third finger. The finding of Gualicho indicates that carnosaurs may have been subject to the same evolution of limb-reduction as tyrannosaurids and abelisaurids, provided that Gualicho is a carnosaur in the first place. Classification Life restoration Phylogenetically, Gualicho presents two possibilities; that megaraptorans and neovenatorids were carnosaurs, or that megaraptorans and neovenatorids were a grade of theropods more closely related to coelurosaurs than to carnosaurs. The cladogram below follows a 2016 analysis by Sebasti√°n Apestegu√≠a, Nathan D. Smith, Rub√©n Juarez Valieri, and Peter J. Makovicky. The cladogram below follows the strict consensus (average result) of the twelve most parsimonious trees (the simplest evolutionary paths, in terms of the total amount of sampled features evolved or lost between sampled taxa) found by Porfiri et al. (2018)'s phylogenetic analysis. Although the results are different, the methodology analysis was practically identical to that of Apesteguia et al. (2016), only differing in the fact that it incorporated Tratayenia and Murusraptor, two megaraptorans not sampled in the analysis of Apesteguia et al.

In 1956, she was the first African-American be named head coach of the U.S. Olympic Women's Track and Field Team. She also served as the head coach in the 1972 Olympic Games.  Early Life  Nell Jackson, born to Burnette L. Jackson and Wilhemina G. Jackson, was the only daughter of three. Education Jackson earned her college degree from Tuskegee Institute in 1951, a master's degree from Springfield College in 1953, and a Ph.D. at the University of Iowa in 1962. Athletics In 1944, at the age of 15, Jackson competed in the US national championships. In 1945, she competed in the AAU indoor and outdoor championships, placing second each time to Stella Walsh in the 200 meters. While she attended Tuskegee Institute, she was a member of the 1948 US Olympic team. Lead by Tuskegee's Hall of Fame head football coach Cleveland Abbott, Jackson won two national collegiate titles in 1950, in the 200 meters and the 400 meter relay. She competed at the 1951 Pan-American games, placing second in the 200 meters and first as a member of the US 400 meter relay team. Jackson set the American record for 200 meters in August 1949, running 24.2 seconds.Multiple sources note this time as an American record, though American Helen Stephens appears to have run 24.1 seconds in 1936. Jackson was inducted into the US National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1989, a year after she died. =Championship results= *1945 AAU: 200 m (2nd) *1945 AAU Indoors: 200 m (2nd) *1951 Pan-Am Games: 200 m (2nd) *1951 Pan-Am Games: 400 m relay (1st) *1950 NCAA: 200 m (1st) *1950 NCAA: 400 m relay (1st) Coaching and athletics administration In 1953, Jackson returned to Tuskegee to work as the women's track and field coach, later also serving as the first men's swimming coach after creating the Tuskegee swimming program in 1958. She subsequently coached track and field at four universities: Iowa, Illinois State, Illinois, and Michigan State.

Biography Her father, Carl Emil Mundt, was a Professor of mathematics at the Sor√∏ Academy. Her mother died when she was three and her father moved the family to Copenhagen.Brief biography @ KVInfo. As a child, her home was filled with political and philosophical discussions, as her father was also a member of (Constitutional Assembly) and her uncle, , was the Mayor of Copenhagen. Emilie Mundt (c.1860) She and her sister, Jacobine, received their basic education at N. Zahle's School and, in 1861, she took an exam to become a private tutor. However, her drawing teacher, Frederik Helsted was impressed with her artistic talent so, after graduation, she became a drawing and writing teacher at the school. At the age of thirty, she finally set out to become an artist and enrolled at the \\"Painting School for Women\\", operated by Vilhelm Kyhn. It was there she met her life partner, Marie Luplau. In 1875, she unsuccessfully sought to gain admission to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts so, following the advice of Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann, she and Luplau went to Munich to continue their studies with Eilif Peterssen.Biographical notes @ Kunstindeks Danmark. During a later period of study in Paris at the Acad√©mie Colarossi (1882-1884), she was influenced by the works Jules Breton and Jules Bastien-Lepage. Their depictions of the lives of poor people inspired her to create a series of paintings on the lives of poor children, many of which were done at a local orphanage. In 1886, she and Luplau set up their own painting school for women in Frederiksberg, which was in operation until 1913. They were also diligent campaigners for women's suffrage and, in 1890, adopted a young girl named Carla. In 1916, she became one of the first members of the Kvindelige Kunstneres Samfund (Women's Art Society). In addition to paintings of children, she is known for scenes of peasant life; many created during a stay at the art colony in Pont-Aven, Brittany. A major retrospective of her works was presented at the Women's Museum, Aarhus in 2007.

He was born in Danzig in 1928 (Gdansk, Poland) and graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1952. From 1952 until 1960, Stephen was employed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, as a research staff member. In 1960 he received an offer of Associate Professorship from the Physics Department of the University of Minnesota, and in 1961 he moved to Minnesota where he stayed for the rest of his life. In 1963 he was promoted to full Professor. Gasiorowicz published over 100 papers on high-energy physics, and several well-known textbooks on the theory of elementary particles, quantum mechanics, and other subjects. Best known are Gasiorowicz‚Äôs contributions to quark models of hadrons, theory of glueballs, and QCD confinement. Gasiorowicz was one of the founding fathers of William I. Fine Theoretical Physics Institute. From 1979 to 1986 Gasiorowicz was Vice-President of the Aspen Center for Physics, Aspen, CO, and in 1987-89 the Acting Director of FTPI. Biography Stephen Gasiorowicz was born on May 10, 1928 into a Jewish family in Danzig (now Gdansk, Poland). Between 1920 and 1939 Danzig was a semi-autonomous city-state populated to a large extent by ethnic Germans. Stephen‚Äôs father was a merchant. With the rise to power of Hitler and Nazis in Germany in 1933 persecution of non-Germans in Danzig increased, and Gasiorowicz‚Äôs family had to move to Warsaw. On September 1, 1939, the Second World War began with the invasion of Poland by Germany. The Gasiorowiczes had to flee immediately; the only open route was to the East of Poland, to Lemberg (currently Lviv, Ukraine). A few dozen miles before Lviv the Gasiorowiczes were met by a detachment of the Soviet Army, which occupied the eastern part of Poland. Stephen Gasiorowicz‚Äôs journey to freedom started in 1939 in occupied Poland ended in 1946 in the United States. It lasted for seven years; through the USSR, Romania, Turkey, Iraq, and India. It was not until he was in India (at that time controlled by Britain; the Polish Government in exile was its ally), that the Gaziorowiczes obtained residence permits. He got his education there; first in a Catholic school and then in a Liceum. In 1946 the Gasiorowiczes were notified that their application for immigration to the U.S., which they filed before the Second World War, was finally approved. The same year Stephen Gasiorowicz sailed from Calcutta, India to San Francisco, California. He was admitted to UCLA as a physics major; he received his BA degree in 1948 and PhD in 1952. His PhD adviser was Robert Finkelstein, and the topic of his PhD thesis was A non-linear model for the composite œÄ-mesons. In the 1960s, 70s and 80s Stephen Gasiorowicz acquired a reputation as an excellent lecturer, and was sought after as a visiting professor by major research centers, such as NORDITA (Denmark), DESY (Germany), the University of Tokyo. Gaziorowicz‚Äôs legacy in physics education spread worldwide. Generations of physics students studied using the textbooks written by Gasiorowicz, which include Elementary Particle Physics, Quantum Physics, and Physics for Scientists and Engineers. He was a PhD adviser to several prominent physicists, including Stanley Brodsky of SLAC and William A. Bardeen of the Fermilab.

The school has 500+ alumni from 50 countries and has launched 280+ startups that have raised $51M+ in funding from venture investors. Draper University teamed up with Arizona State University (ASU) in 2013 to offer students 15 course credits for a sixteen-week Semester program. Prior to the partnership with ASU, the school was unaccredited. History Draper University was established in 2012 by venture capitalist Tim Draper, co- founder of Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ). The university building was formerly the Hotel Benjamin Franklin. The school's first session had 40 students. Since then the school has grown to offer Fall, Spring and Summer programs for both students as well as executive education for CEO's and governmental officials. In April 2015, a reality program called Startup U featured Draper University's seven-week program in a 10-episode series. The show included Miss USA 2013, Erin Brady, who joined the series to help develop and find investors for her company, Romeo in a Box. Draper University announced a partnership with Arizona State University and Global Silicon Valley in May 2016 to launch an entrepreneurial program combining Draper's innovations in education with ASU's curriculum and large student body. Dubbed the ASU Draper GSV Accelerator, the program includes the Draper University entrepreneurial boot camp with a network of experts. Six scholarships were given to ASU students to attend the program. Since then, Draper University has launched a new partnership, teaming up with ASU to offer 15 college credits and a certificate of entrepreneurship for the Fall 2017 program. =Hotel Benjamin Franklin= Hotel Benjamin Franklin, vintage postcard Before Draper purchased the building in 2011, the Hotel Benjamin Franklin was a downtown San Mateo landmark since it opened on June 28, 1927. The Benjamin Franklin (named not for the American statesman but as a portmanteau of the original owners' names, A.C. Franklin and Benjamin Getz) succeeded the Peninsula Hotel, which was converted from Alvinza Hayward's mansion but had burned in 1920, as San Mateo's finest hotel. The building was designed by local architect W. H. Weeks and constructed at a cost of . It is nine stories high, exceeding at the flagpole. Churrigueresque decorative details can be seen around windows on the second, eighth, and ninth floors. Notable guests at the Benjamin Franklin have included Ginger Rogers, Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, Friend Richardson, and Masanori Murakami. Hero City is across the street from the former Hotel Benjamin Franklin The Benjamin Franklin had a longstanding relationship to provide temporary housing for United Airlines employees, which began in 1946 and lasted until 2003, when the airline filed for bankruptcy. In 1955, the hotel was purchased by the Max Best family, which ran it until it was sold to Westin in 1985. Westin in turn sold it to The Empire Group in 1989. The building was largely vacant aside from a ground-level bar and restaurant after United moved out, and was part of a larger property transfer from the Lembi Group to UBS AG in 2009 after Lembi fell behind on loan payments. Draper purchased the building in 2011 with the intent to redevelop it under a mysterious project entitled \\"The Heart of San Mateo\\". Nearly a year later, Draper revealed his plans for Draper University, billed as \\"a boarding school for entrepreneurs that will draw students from around the globe\\" in a letter to city officials. Draper had also acquired a two-story property across the street, intending to use it as classroom space. Program The Draper University runs a five to seven-week program with four sessions each year, but will begin its 16-week semester long program in Fall 2017. The program is aimed at 18 to 28 year-olds, and has 500 alumni. In addition to the program, Draper includes a co-working business incubator space called Hero City, VCx, a one-week program teaching early stage investment, and a one-week program aimed at executives adding innovation to corporations. Draper also offers online courses. Demographics Draper's spring 2016 class was 45 percent female. The school previously offered scholarships for women including the Meera Kaul Foundation, Women Who Code, and SoGal. 45 percent of students are international.

History  A Hittite inscription in Luwian hieroglyphs found during excavation of the area indicates that the structure was dedicated to the Hittite goddess ·∏™epat. This goddess was honoured by Puduhepa, the wife of Great King Hattusili III, who called herself the goddess' servant. From a cuneiform document it is known that her son, Tudhaliya IV, who succeeded Hattusili, had ten dams built in the Hittite empire around 1240 BC after a period of drought.Yasemin Ku≈ülu, √úst√ºn ≈ûahin: \\"Water Structures in Anatolia from Past to Present\\" Journal of Applied Sciences Research, vol. 5, no. 12 (2009) pp. 2109‚Äì2116 From this it may be concluded that the G√∂lpƒ±nar dam is the work of Tudhaliya. It provided irrigation water and possibly drinking water to the inhabitants of Alaca H√∂y√ºk.G√ºnther Garbrecht, \\"Historische Wasserbauten in Ost-Anatolien\\" In Christoph Ohlig (ed.): Wasserbauten im K√∂nigreich Urartu und weitere Beitr√§ge zur Hydrotechnik in der Antike pp. 90 GoogleBooks The dam was first discovered and partially exposed during the Turkish archaeologists H√¢mit Z√ºbeyir Ko≈üay and 's excavations at Alaca H√∂y√ºk in 1935.Remzi Oƒüuz Arƒ±k: Les fouilles d'Alaca H√∂y√ºk entreprises par la Soci√©t√© d'histoire turque. Rapport pr√©liminaire sur les travaux en 1935. Ankara 1937 p. 10 Between 2002 and 2007, the dam was fully excavated, repaired and placed back in active use by the Turkish archaeologists Aykut √áƒ±naroƒülu und Elif Gen√ß in collaboration with the Turkish State Hydraulic Works (Devlet Su ƒ∞≈üleri). As a result, a lake of around a million cubic metres was created, which can be used to irrigate around 20 hectares of farmland.  Location and structure  The dam is located in a hilly area about 1.5 kilometres southeast of the hill settlement of Alaca H√∂y√ºk in the of Alaca in √áorum province on the road to Karamahmut and the town of Alaca. The nearly rectangular reservoir measures around 110 metres from west to east and around 100 metres from north to south. Three sides of the reservoir are edged with rubble, while the dam at the western end forms the fourth side. With a depth at the centre of 2.5 metres, the pool had a capacity of 27,500 cubic metres. It was fed by several springs within the reservoir, the most important of which lay in the southwest of the basin. In front of the dam was a 130 metres long spillway basin, flanked by two canals. At both ends of the dam were sluices, for overflow which it was possible to put back into partial use. The total thickness of the dam is around 15 metres, it rises more than two metres above the water level. The dam structure is composed of roughly fist-sized stones, which were made waterproof using clay. The base of the spillway is also covered with clay. West of the dam there was a wall with three pedestals made of sandstone, limestone and andesite respectively. In the pool, at the crest of the dam, a pedestal with the aforementioned inscribed stele in honour of ·∏™epat came to light.

It was built from 1919 to 1938. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The first Christian missionary, representing the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG), arrived at the newly established settlement of Somerset, Cape York Peninsula, on 15 March 1867. Rev F.C. Jagg came with his family. A young English schoolteacher, W.T. Kennett, funded by the Queensland Government to establish a school at Somerset, accompanied Rev Jagg and started a mission school on 1 October 1867. A lack of funding, lack of support from the government administration, and dismay at the brutality of the police resulted in the mission being closed by June 1868. In 1871 representatives of the London Missionary Society arrived in the Torres Straits on the vessel , after the French Government had demanded their removal from the Loyalty Islands and New Caledonia in 1869. They decided to expand into the Torres Straits and New Guinea. They were represented by two Englishmen, Revs S. MacFarlane and A.W. Murray, and eight Lifu (Loyalty Islander) evangelists: Tapeso, Elia, Mataika, Guchong, Kerisidui, Wauaded, Sevine and Josaia, and their wives. The missionaries reached Erub (Darnley Island) on 1 July 1871, an event that came to be known as the \\"Coming of the Light\\". Dabad, one of the tribal elders of the island, met them at Kemus Beach. Dabad befriended the missionaries and introduced them to Amani, another tribal elder, and the rest of the Erub Islanders. His role in the bringing of Christianity to the Torres Straits is memorialised by Dabad's Monument at Badog. The inscription reads \\"In loving memory of Dabad 1871: A man who denied his tribal laws and accepted the good news of salvation\\". South Sea Islanders had an important role working in the beche-de-mer and pearl farming industries in the Torres Straits and had established trading relations with the islanders long before the arrival of HMS Surprise. Rotuma Islanders working there, who had encountered Christian missions at Rotuma and believed the missionaries to be cruel, evil and capable of selling people into slavery, reportedly warned the people of Erub against them. Thorngreen, a European man, was living on Erub and accompanied Darnley Islanders on board HMS Surprise the following day. As it was a Sunday, the missionaries held a service in Lifu language. This was the first recorded service in the Torres Straits (although Rev Jagg would have undoubtedly held services during his 12 months at Somerset). Two native evangelists, Mataika and Guchong, and their wives, were left on Erub on 5 July. HMS Surprise went on to Tudu (Warrior) Island. The missionaries were welcomed at Tudu by Captain Banner, who had an established pearl shell fishery on the island. John Joseph, one of his employees, travelled with the missionaries as an interpreter to Dauan Island on 6 July. Finding that most of the islanders were away on Saibai Island, they were taken to Saibai by Nudai, the chief of Dauan. Two Lifu evangelists, Josaia and Sevine, were left at Saibai and Dauan, respectively. It was 1881 before the first substantial building for Christian worship was constructed at Saibai. In the early 20th century, it was replaced by the Holy Trinity Church, on which construction began about 1919 and was completed by about 1938. Additional Lifu evangelists were left on Yorke and Yam Islands. With the English clergy still aboard, HMS Surprise sailed to the newly established settlement at Somerset. The London Missionary Society (LMS) established temporary headquarters at Somerset, from where they could expand their operations into other Torres Strait Islands and the mainland of New Guinea. Between 1871 and 1878 at least 131 Pacific Islander teachers, mainly from the Loyalty Islands, Cook Islands, Niue, Society Islands and Rurutu, taught in the Torres Straits and New Guinea, along with their wives and families. Only four European missionaries taught in the same period. In 1872 the LMS revisited selected islands in the Torres Straits. They reported that the missionaries who had been left on Dauan and Saibai had been accepted into the local tribes and had been given land by the local chiefs. They reported weekly services were being held at Erub (Darnley), and were conducted in a pidgin form of the local language, Kala Lagaw Ya. Eventually a full creole language developed in the Torres Strait Islands. The Queensland Government annexed the islands of the Torres Straits within of the mainland in 1872, followed by the remainder of the islands in 1879. It feared that rival colonial powers could take control of what had become an important shipping route. Annexation also gave the government control over the increasingly lucrative beche-de-mer and pearl shelling economies and, in particular, regulating the use of Torres Strait and South Sea Islander labour in these industries. The government moved its administration centre from Somerset to Thursday Island in 1877. But the lack of government resources, such as a regular patrol boat, meant that effectively administration of the islands was conducted by the London Missionary Society. The Society established the Papuan Institute on the island of Mer as a theological facility to train Torres Strait Islanders as Episcopal priests. The Society selected the students. It closed the Institute in 1888, but by then a number of local priests had been trained who were familiar with both formal missionary teaching and the local Islander customs. By 1890 the London Missionary Society began to reduce its operations in the Torres Straits. Conversion on the islands had been successful, and they considered Papua their next area of endeavour. A full-time superintendent on the islands was no longer deemed necessary. The incumbent priest, Rev J Chalmers, moved to Saguane in the Fly River in New Guinea. The Queensland Government appointed teacher/supervisors on various islands. In 1904 the Protector of Aborigines assumed comprehensive control of Islanders' lives under the Queensland Aboriginals Protection Act of 1897. Worship on various islands was led by the Islander priests who had been trained at the Papuan Institute. Annual inspections were made by LMS representatives travelling from New Guinea. In 1914 the secretary of the London Missionary Society requested that the Bishop of Carpentaria, Gilbert White, take over the missionary work in the Torres Strait due to financial pressure. The Australian Board of Missions in November 1914 accepted this and the Anglican Church assumed responsibility for the Torres Strait Mission. All the leases granted to the LMS, including the buildings, were transferred to the Anglican Church. Soon after this transfer, the Anglican Church instituted annual \\"Coming of the Light\\" celebrations, as a tribute to the London Missionary Society and perhaps as a way of ensuring continuity of worship. This anniversary continues to be celebrated annually by Torres Strait Islanders, both in the Strait and in Torres Strait Islander communities on the Australian mainland. Kemus Beach, on Erub, is a particularly important center for these Coming of the Light celebrations. This was the site of the first contact between Torres Strait Islanders and representatives of the London Missionary Society. That event is memorialized by a Coming of the Light monument, consisting of a high white cross standing in a ship named Surprise as its base. Church, 1934 In 1919 the All Saints Church was constructed at the former site of the original London Missionary Society mission house and school. Locally produced lime from burnt coral and basalt was used and the work was done under the direction of Manai, an Erub Islander, and Ware, a South Sea Islander. It was originally known as the Ziona church. In 1963 the Church of England, now the Anglican Church, remodelled this building with limestone from surrounding coral reefs. The roofline was raised and internal walls extended. Erosion of the beach over time has threatened the preservation of the building. In 1976 a stone sea wall was constructed approximately from the building in an effort to protect it from erosion from the strong tides.  Description  Church, 1996 All Saints Church is a mass concrete structure with a timber framed red corrugated asbestos cement and galvanized steel roof, located from Badog Beach on the south west side of Erub (Darnley) Island in the Torres Straits. The area of the building is about , featuring a central nave with side wings. Walls, constructed of concrete, vary in thickness from and are plastered internally and externally. Internal walls between the nave and the wings of the building are rendered white and feature columned arches. The floor is concrete. The facade of the building, facing east, is decorated with a niche, projecting columns and beams, frieze and other architectural features. The main entrance is on the southern side of the side of the building, through one of the side wings. External walls of the side wings are buttressed at the corners and intermediary points. The sanctuary is at the western end of the building with a vestry extending to the southern side of it. The building is located on a small level area between the beach and the north east headland of Badog Beach. The vegetation includes mature coconut palms and a natural forest setting.  Heritage listing  All Saints Anglican Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. All Saints Church, Erub (Darnley) Island, survives as important evidence of the development of missionary activity in the Torres Straits and serves as a focus for the annual July 1 \\"Coming of the Light\\" festival that celebrates the arrival of the London Missionary Society in the Torres Straits in 1871. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The substantial building, constructed in 1919 mainly of locally acquired materials including burnt coral and basalt, forms a prominent landmark in the architecture of Erub (Darnley) Island. It has aesthetic significance through its prominent siting on Badog Beach and as an example of the vernacular architectural style of churches in the Torres Straits that includes projected corners and beams and buttressed corners and cement construction material. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Erub (Darnley Island) has a strong and special religious significance with Torres Strait Islander Christians as the first place of contact between Torres Strait Islanders and London Missionary Society missionaries.

Tony convinces Ste to get clean for his children. Tony is dancing to a song on the radio where Ste comes in after his shower with clothes that don't fit him. Ste then breaks the piggy bank that belongs to Tony's twins when Harry won't give him the money that he stole from the Roscoe's. Tony threatens to call the police but Harry convinces him not to. Harry follows Ste outside where Ste punches him and Harry lands on the ground. Ste immediately regrets punching Harry. Tony, Harry and Ste go back to the flat, Harry overhears Ste telling Tony that he isn't a domestic abuser anymore. During the night, Ste demands the key to the door but Harry refuses.

Harry promises Ste that he will stick by him. Tony tells Ste a story that stuck with him at church (The Footprints) Tony and Harry hug Ste as the episode ends. Production The episode was first publicised by Kieron Richardson. He was being interviewed by Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy at the British Soap Awards 2016. He said that the episode would only feature the characters of Ste, Harry and Tony; a special constructed episode dubbed a \\"three hander\\". This was the show's second \\"three hander\\" stylised episode, the first airing in 2011, which focused on the characters of Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper), Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) and Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan). Richardson had revealed that the three-hander would feature his character, going cold turkey. Richardson had stated, \\"We were filming for four days, mainly in Tony's flat, and I had to show Ste in a frantic comedown state, so it was pretty exhausting.\\" Richardson said in an interview with What's on TV, \\"It‚Äôs very exciting and intense. We filmed a special episode with just Ste, his boyfriend, Harry [Parry Glasspool] and friend Tony [Nick Pickard] and it was so powerful. I made myself feel poorly for real. It‚Äôs unlike any episode of Hollyoaks you‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs a bit of a nod to the film Trainspotting. Harry and Tony are trying to fight for Ste‚Äôs life. They lock him in the flat to try and stop him getting more drugs and the comedown is horrific. The audience goes through it all with Ste.\\" In an interview with Radio Times, Richardson was worried about the topic being controversial for the show's timeslot, he said \\"I am scared. I'm thinking that there might be reshoots because it's too extreme. I've literally gone for it\\". Reception \\"Episode 4429\\" appeared in an article published via Digital Spy. It compiled ten unmissable soap storylines airing the week the episode was broadcast. Their reporter, Kilkelly, warned that viewers could expect harrowing scenes in the episode. Richardson received a considerable amount of praise via the social networking website Twitter. His performance mostly drew an emotional reaction from viewers conversing on the platform. Duncan Lindsay of Metro said \\"Hollyoaks is often regarded as the underdog of the soap world ‚Äì without much justification ‚Äì but continually proves that it can deliver high octane and powerful drama as well as its rivals. The three hander on E4, led by emotive performances from Kieron Richardson, has shown, once more, that it deserves far more credit.\\" Lindsay went on to say \\"the episode flew by and left us gripped from start to finish.\\" While he added \\"The effective episode has revealed that Hollyoaks deserves the credit it gets but also highlights that living in the shadows of its equally strong counterparts remains the biggest injustice in the soap world.\\" Lindsay had earlier stated \\"With secrets from the past coming out, big decisions made and Ste at an all time low, it‚Äôs an unmissable visit to Hollyoaks that will answer the following questions. Will Ste come out the other side? Will Harry stand by him? Will the truth about Cameron‚Äôs involvement come out?\\" Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy stated \\"Bravo to Hollyoaks trio Kieron Richardson, Nick Pickard and Parry Glasspool, who pulled some of their most powerful performances out of the bag in their special episode tonight (July 13).\\" Carl Greenwood of Daily Mirror stated \\"Hollyoaks has made history with its first three-hander episode.\\" Greenwood also reported that \\"fans praise 'incredible' Kieron Richardson after emotionally powerful performance moves them to tears.\\" He also stated, \\"Actor Kieron Richardson knocked his performance out of the park as Ste as he veered from begging for help and viciously attacking his loved ones for trying to keep him from getting his next fix.\\" The episode has been described as \\"a very emotional and hardhitting episode [sic].\\" A reporter for Attitude said that \\"Things get even darker for 'Starry' in tonight's special episode of the Channel 4 soap.\\" Inside Soap included the episode in their \\"pick of the day\\" feature, with their writer describing \\"very disturbing scenes\\" and branding it an unmissable episode. They wrote about the episode \\"It‚Äôs a very special episode of Hollyoaks tonight, with only three actors involved. Tony and Harry spend a night trying to help Ste through his drug withdrawal ‚Äì so prepare yourselves for some very disturbing scenes as Ste lashes out at the people who love him. You really mustn‚Äôt miss this!\\" Rachel McGrath of Huffington Post wrote \\"In one of the most emotionally-charged scenes, Ste - spurred on by desperation to feed his habit - attacked Harry, which brought back memories of the violence he put his ex Amy Barnes through.\\" References Hollyoaks Hollyoaks episodes 2016 British television episodes Three-handers Soap opera episodes Television episodes about drugs ","title":"Episode 4429"},{"id":"51068323","text":"Vivi Laurent-T√§ckholm Vivi Laurent-T√§ckholm (7 January 1898, DanderydRotemannen, CD-ROM, Sveriges Sl√§ktforskarf√∂rbund/Stockholms Stadsarkiv (2012). ‚Äì 3 May 1978)Begravda i Sverige, CD-ROM, Version 1.00, Sveriges Sl√§ktforskarf√∂rbund. was a Swedish botanist and children's book author, active in Egypt.

Duncan and Jack get advice from Duncan's younger brother, Freddie, and download the Blindr app to get girls, they find a match with Amber and Violet and they meet at a restaurant 30 minutes later. At the restaurant, Amber walks in and claims she is one of the girls they matched with from the Blindr app. She buys Duncan and Jack drinks, drugging both of them when they are not paying attention, knocking them out. She kidnaps the duo and brings them to her boyfriend Goose. Goose's mother forces him to eat dinner with her and Duncan, Jack, and Amber are forced by Goose to join him. Kaylee calls Jack to tell him about what she was going to wear to Tucker's party, unaware that Jack does not have his phone. In response to this, Goose impersonates him and calls her a bitch. Duncan is forced to leave with Goose and they go to a liquor store and Goose tries to deposit a large amount money from its ATM. The man behind them talks trash to Goose and Duncan for taking too long. Duncan is doing this purposely to try and escape. Goose talks trash back, but is knocked out by the man.

On their way to the party, Duncan and Jack get into an argument and end their friendship because of everything that happened. Duncan is granted into the party by exchanging Goose's watch. Meanwhile, Jack sneaks in through Tucker's bedroom window but accidentally lands on Tucker's cat, Mr. Pickles, who has 10 million subscribers on YouTube, which was why the party was being thrown. Tucker then discovers Mr. Pickles dead while Jack is hiding. Jack discovers Kaylee and attempts to talk to her. To his dismay, she wants nothing to do with him because she thinks that he had called her a bitch on the phone earlier. During this, Duncan meets a party-goer named Digby who believes that the way to get girls is by insulting them. Jack tries to talk to Kaylee again but Tucker sees this while performing, he confronts him and pushes him to the ground, causing a scene. This angers Kaylee because she wanted to handle the situation herself. Tucker calls her a bitch and Jack angrily defends her, calling Tucker a bitch in response. Tucker's friend, Topher, discovers Jack killed Mr. Pickles and shows video evidence of Jack doing so when he denies it. An enraged Tucker wants to fight him for this, but they are interrupted by gunshots and Goose arrives, confronting Jack about his belongings. Tucker knocks out Goose for crashing his party, but still has his intention to fight Jack. As Tucker approaches Jack, Duncan comes from behind and knocks Tucker out by smashing glass on his head. Jack and Duncan admit their mistakes during their fight earlier, apologizing and befriending each other once again. Kaylee takes Jack to Tucker's room to talk and apologize for being mean to him. Jack finally expresses his feelings with a kiss, telling her that he accepts her apology, and they have sex. Duncan spots Scarlett and she reveals that she is Tucker's sister. Duncan immediately apologizes, but Scarlett reveals she is not mad at Duncan for hitting him, saying that he had it coming. She offers to have sex with him because their session was cut short, which he gladly accepts. Jack and Duncan get home in the morning after joyfully screaming as they ride through the streets on a Segway that they are no longer virgins. They quickly pack their bags so they can leave on time for their flight. The final scene shows Jack and Duncan at the airport saying their final goodbyes and Duncan reveals he took their phones from Goose.

Flora Alberta arrived in the fishing grounds on April 18 and fished for three days. On April 20, 1943, British steamer Fanad Head left Halifax, Nova Scotia alongside a convoy of eight ships heading to the United Kingdom. Fanad Head had a length of 420 feet and a net registered tonnage of 3002 tons. On April 21, 1943 at approximately 5:20 a.m. (ADT), the Flora Alberta was hit on the starboard side by the Fanad Head in dense fog. The incident occurred approximately 140 kilometers southeast of Halifax. The Flora Alberta was sliced in two by the collision and sank within a few minutes. Most of the Flora Alberta crew were sleeping at the time of the collision and did not have time to escape the sinking ship. Twenty-one of the twenty-eight crew members aboard the Flora Alberta died. The Fanad Head crew put three lifeboats in the ocean immediately after the collision and rescued the surviving crew members. The deaths of 21 crew members left 46 fatherless children. The local MLA, John James Kinley interceded on behalf of the widows and obtained pensions for the families, based on the sinking being a \\"wartime incident\\". Adams & Knickle immediately decided to build a replacement vessel. In September 1943, the keel of the new vessel was laid and on May 23, 1944 the Frances Geraldine was launched into Lunenburg Harbour. History Television's documentary series, Disasters of the Century, aired an episode on the incident. =Casualties= Most of the 21 crew members killed were from Lunenburg County, however four were originally from Newfoundland. =Lawsuit= The owners of the Flora Alberta claimed $100,000 in damages from the Fanad Head. Justice Carroll, District Judge in Admiralty for the Nova Scotia Admiralty District of the Exchequer Court of Canada, found that the Fanad Head was at fault and gave judgment for the owners of the Flora Alberta. The case went to the Supreme Court of Canada, which apportioned one third liability to the Flora Alberta and two thirds liability to the Fanad Head.

Despite being an easier crossing, these features pushed the majority of travellers to take the route of the old Roman road (the ) which crossed the mountains of Cantal. After the breakthrough of the Lioran tunnel, the first tunnel of France and the longest in the world when built, the pass has become more frequented. With the birth of the ski station of Le Lioran, the col is again popular and, in the early 1950s, the Font-de-C√®re buron was built, which was a holiday site of the city of Le Mans for some years. Activities A restaurant can be found at the col. =Cycling= The col is crossed by a paved road, known as imperial road, connecting Font d'Alagnon to Font-de-C√®re. It is a climb averaging 4.9%. The route was used during Stage 5 of the 2016 Tour de France, classified as a Category 3 climb, with Greg Van Avermaet winning the stage. =Walking= The col is an important place of passage for hikers during the summer, as it is located on the GR 4 (linking Royan to Grasse), and the GR 400 (Cantal Mountains route) leading to the Puy Mary. =Winter sports= In winter, the site is part of the ski station of Le Lioran and is frequented by followers of winter sports (skiing, snowshoeing, crosscountry skiing, etc.).

Construction  HMHS Letitia was built as SS Letitia at the Scott¬¥s Shipbuilding & Engineering Co. shipyard in Greenock, Scotland in 1912. She was launched on 21 February 1912, and completed by May of the same year. The ship was long, had a beam of and had a depth of . She was assessed at and had 2 triple expansion engines driving double screw propellers. The engine was rated at 962 nhp and the ship could reach a maximum speed of 14 knots.  Early career  The SS Letitia made her maiden voyage from Glasgow to Quebec and Montreal and kept sailing on that line until the outbreak of the First World War. She had place to accommodate 1.387 passengers and crew and she sometimes also carried mail as cargo.  World War I  After the start of The Great War, SS Letitia was commandeered by the British Admiralty on 18 November 1914 for service as a Hospital Ship or Ambulance Transport and placed under the command of the Royal Canadian Naval Medical Services. she was retrofitted to provide the latest in medical care and comfort for her patients. She had a full complement of medical and nursing staff with access to all of the equipment available in a state-of-the-art hospital. All Hospital ships were distinctively painted in white with a green stripe down the side and three red crosses on each side as well, this was done to differentiate these \\"non- combatant\\" vessels from other shipping. But sometimes even these non- combatants became targets of enemy submarines. Letitia earned the prefix HMHS, which stands for His Majesty's Hospital Ship, for her new service as a hospital ship. The HMHS Letitia first served with distinction in the Mediterranean and even came under fire while evacuating wounded troops near the Dardanelles. The Hospital ship conducted her first rescue at sea when she came across the sinking SS City of Birmingham on 27 November 1916 some south east of Malta. The cargo liner had been torpedoed by the German Submarine SM U-32 and later sunk with the loss of four lives. The HMHS Letitia picked up all the survivors and sailed back to safety. The Letitia was relocated from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic in 1917 and her new task consisted of bringing wounded Canadian soldiers stationed in the United Kingdom back to their homes in Canada. The hospital ship made a total of five voyages from Liverpool, United Kingdom to Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, bringing a total of 2,600 wounded Canadian soldiers back home. = Sinking = HMHS Letitia set sail from Liverpool for the ninth time and had a full crew of 137 men, 74 hospital staff (including 12 nurses) and 546 wounded Canadian soldiers onboard. By now it was the end of July 1917 and the Letitia had been in service as a hospital ship for nearly three years. The crossing was made without incident until the morning of 1 August 1917, when fog appeared off the coast of Nova Scotia. The visibility was reduced to near zero, but Captain William McNeil continued on his course and posted several crew members to listen for the various whistles like buoy bells or foghorn blasts, which warns ships of the dangerous shoals that threaten the entrance to Halifax Harbour. 280px The captain used the navigational method of dead reckoning to estimate his position when he heard a whistle of an approaching pilot boat. The pilot came aboard to guide the Letitia through the fog, between the unseen buoys and into the harbour. The pilot continued the course, but he hadn't realized that the captain had incorrectly estimated the ship's position. Ten minutes after the pilot boarded the ship, the captain saw a dark object coming closer and ordered the ship full astern. The order however, came too late and the Letitia was forcefully stopped when she ran aground on Portuguese Cove in Halifax Harbour. Captain McNeil tried to reverse the engines in order to free the ship from her stricken position, but the holds were perforated and the ship was in danger of breaking up, sliding off the shoal and sinking beneath the waves with all of the wounded men still onboard. After the grounding, the Captain immediately called for assistance to help with the evacuation of all passengers. All the soldiers were disembarked without incident onto nearby ships that had rushed in to help. The captain and crew stayed on board until the next morning, when the ship began to list and the captain ordered to abandon ship. The Letitia split in two in the months following the grounding and her stern sank into deeper waters. Legal salvagers and looters removed much of her equipment before the ship sank completely.  Aftermath and wreck  All passengers and medical staff were saved, but there was one fatality among the crew, a stoker was accidentally left on the ship and he drowned when he tried to swim to shore. At the subsequent inquiry, Captain McNeil testified that he had fully trusted that the pilot knew where the buoys were, particularly because the pilots were in charge of moving the buoys to protect the harbour during wartime. The pilot was found guilty of a gross error of judgment and demoted. The wreck of the Letitia is still resting on the floor of the approach to Halifax Harbour just south of Portuguese Cove at a depth of and is a popular recreational dive site. The wreckage is scattered over the bottom and is lying on a steeply sloping shelf, with a sudden drop off. When looking down, you can see a boiler and a section of the stern. Some members of the crew were repatriated on the SS Athenia which was torpedoed on 16 August 1917; relatives were required to travel to Donegal to identify the bodies.
